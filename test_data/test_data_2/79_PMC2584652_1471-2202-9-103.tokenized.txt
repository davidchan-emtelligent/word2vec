background transcranial direct current stimulation ( tdcs ) is a non - invasive technique that has been found to modulate the excitability of neurons in the brain .
the polarity of the current applied to the scalp determines the effects of tdcs on the underlying tissue : anodal tdcs increases excitability , whereas cathodal tdcs decreases excitability .
research has shown that applying anodal tdcs to the non - dominant motor cortex can improve motor performance for the non - dominant hand , presumably by means of changes in synaptic plasticity between neurons .
our previous studies also suggest that applying cathodal tdcs over the dominant motor cortex can improve performance for the non - dominant hand ; this effect may result from modulating inhibitory projections ( interhemispheric inhibition ) between the motor cortices of the two hemispheres .
we hypothesized that stimultaneously applying cathodal tdcs over the dominant motor cortex and anodal tdcs over the non - dominant motor cortex would have a greater effect on finger sequence performance for the non - dominant hand , compared to stimulating only the non - dominant motor cortex .
sixteen right - handed participants underwent three stimulation conditions : 1 ) dual - hemisphere - with anodal tdcs over the non - dominant motor cortex , and cathodal tdcs over the dominant motor cortex , 2 ) uni - hemisphere - with anodal tdcs over the non - dominant motor cortex , and 3 ) sham tdcs .
participants performed a finger - sequencing task with the non - dominant hand before and after each stimulation .
the dependent variable was the percentage of change in performance , comparing pre - and post - tdcs scores .
results a repeated measures anova yielded a significant effect of tdcs condition ( f ( 2,30 ) = 4.468 , p = . 037 ) .
post - hoc analyses revealed that dual - hemisphere stimulation improved performance significantly more than both uni - hemisphere ( p = . 021 ) and sham stimulation ( p = . 041 ) .
conclusion we propose that simultaneously applying cathodal tdcs over the dominant motor cortex and anodal tdcs over the non - dominant motor cortex produced an additive effect , which facilitated motor performance in the non - dominant hand .
these findings are relevant to motor skill learning and to research studies of motor recovery after stroke .
background techniques that stimulate the brain non - invasively hold the promise of revealing causal relations between brain regions and brain functions [ 1 ] .
furthermore , these techniques may also facilitate skill acquisition , learning and neural plasticity [ 2 - 4 ] .
because it is portable , relatively inexpensive , and free from any major side - effects , transcranial direct current stimulation ( tdcs ) is ideally suited for use in stroke recovery therapies [ 5,6 ] .
tdcs modulates regional brain activity by altering the membrane potential of neurons [ 7,8 ] .
the effects of tdcs on a population of neurons are determined by the polarity of stimulation - anodal stimulation increases excitability and cathodal stimulation decreases excitability .
changes in excitability induced by tdcs are mediated by activity in sodium and calcium ion channels in the membranes of neurons , and by the efficiency of receptors for nmda neurotransmitters [ 7,9 ] .
applying tdcs over the motor cortex has the potential to facilitate improvements in motor functioning .
research with healthy participants revealed that applying anodal tdcs over the motor cortex can improve performance for the hand contralateral to the stimulated hemisphere [ 10 - 12 ] .
stroke - recovery research has also explored the potential benefits of using tdcs , or tdcs in combination with physical or occupational therapy .
for example , studies have reported that applying anodal tdcs to the stroke - affected motor cortex improved motor functioning ; the tdcs may have stimulated preserved areas of the motor cortex to enhance synaptic efficiency along the corticospinal tract .
it may also be possible to improve motor ability by applying cathodal tdcs to the motor cortex ipsilateral to the performing hand ; this may have a beneficial effect in stroke patients by diminishing maladaptive inhibitory projections from the undamaged hemisphere onto the damaged motor cortex [ 5,6,13 - 15 ] .
in our previous studies , we found that cathodal tdcs over the dominant motor cortex had a facilitative effect for the non - dominant hand [ 4,12 ] ; presumably , the cathodal tdcs modulated inhibitory projections between the motor cortices of the two brain hemispheres to achieve this effect .
the predominant mode of interhemispheric interaction between primary motor cortices is inhibitory [ 16 ] , and there is an asymmetry in this interhemispheric inhibition ( ihi ) , with stronger inhibitory projections originating in the dominant motor cortex [ 17 - 19 ] .
therefore , decreasing excitability in the dominant motor cortex may release the non - dominant motor cortex from inhibitory suppression , and thereby increase excitability in the non - dominant motor cortex .
this could explain why applying cathodal tdcs over the motor cortex of the unaffected hemisphere facilitates motor recovery for stroke patients , particularly when the damage is to the non - dominant hemisphere [ 15,20 ] .
it is possible that the ideal montage for catalyzing motor improvement may involve stimulating both motor cortices simultaneously , with an appropriate combination of anodal and cathodal tdcs .
the aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that dual - hemisphere stimulation ( simultaneously applying anodal tdcs to the non - dominant motor cortex and cathodal tdcs to the dominant motor cortex ) would improve finger - sequence performance for the non - dominant hand more than uni - hemisphere stimulation ( applying only anodal tdcs to the non - dominant motor cortex ) .
results of this study are relevant to the use of non - invasive brain stimulation for facilitating motor recovery after stroke .
methods participants sixteen healthy adults ( mean age : 27.6 , s.d. : 3.6 ) took part in the experiment after giving their informed written consent following protocol approved by the irb of the beth israel deaconess medical center ( bidmc ) .
all participants were right handed , as determined by the edinburgh handedness inventory [ 21 ] with laterality quotients ranging from 80 - 100 , and were naive as to the purpose of the study .
procedure participants underwent three stimulation sessions - one for each condition ( dual - hemisphere , uni - hemisphere , and sham tdcs ) - while sitting in an office chair .
each stimulation session was conducted on a different day , such that consecutive stimulation sessions were separated by at least 24 hours .
the ordering for the stimulation conditions was counterbalanced across participants as completely as possible .
due to the number of participants ( n = 16 ) , it was not possible to divide them evenly into the six possible orderings for the stimulation conditions .
notably , the uni - hemisphere condition occurred first slightly more often than the dual - hemisphere condition .
one saline - dampened electrode ( oval in shape , with area = 16.3 cm2 ) was positioned over the left motor region , centered on c3 of the 10 - 20 international eeg system , and another over the right motor region , centered on c4 .
neuroimaging studies have confirmed the correspondence between the primary motor cortices of the left and right hemispheres and c3 and c4 , respectively [ 22,23 ] ; our own pilot study ( n = 5 ) with high resolution mri ( 1 mm3 voxel size ) provided further support .
a third electrode ( rectangular in shape , with area = 30 cm2 ) positioned over the left supraorbital region served as a reference electrode in the uni - hemisphere stimulation condition .
for the dual - hemisphere condition , the electrode over the right motor area was used as the anode , and the electrode over the left motor area was the cathode .
for the uni - hemisphere condition , the electrode over the right motor area was the anode , and the electrode over the left supraorbital region was the cathode ; this location for the cathodal electrode has been shown to be functionally ineffective in experimental designs [ 11 ] .
the sham electrode montage varied randomly between that for the dual - hemisphere and uni - hemisphere conditions .
due to the size of the electrodes centered on m1 of the right and left hemispheres ( 16.3 cm2 ) , the stimulation may have extended beyond primary motor cortex into nearby premotor and anterior superior parietal areas .
a battery - driven , constant current stimulator ( phoresor , iomed inc. , salt lake city , ut ) delivered the electrical current from anode to cathode .
for both the dual - hemisphere and uni - hemisphere conditions , the tdcs current ramped up over the first few seconds to a maximum of 1 ma , and then remained on for the remainder of the 20 - minute stimulation period .
this resulted in a total current density of . 07 ma / cm2 over the motor cortices , and of . 03 ma / cm2 over the left supraorbital area .
the sham control condition was identical to the dual - hemisphere and uni - hemisphere conditions , except that the experimenter reduced the current to zero after 30 seconds ; the current then stayed at zero for the remaining time period .
participants reported a tingly or itchy sensation at the start of the stimulation , which typically faded away after a few seconds .
this sensation was present for both real and sham tdcs .
gandiga and colleagues [ 24 ] found that naive participants were not able to distinguish between real and sham tdcs , as employed in a manner similar to the present study .
participants read a book or magazine during the stimulation periods .
task instructions for a single trial were to place the index , middle , ring , and little fingers of the left hand over the numbers two through five on a standard keyboard , and to repeat a uni - manual pattern of five sequential keystrokes as accurately and quickly as possible for 30 seconds .
subjects were shown which numbers of the numeric keypad corresponded to their fingers .
during the task , the number sequence was displayed on a computer screen placed in front of the participant .
the task interface did not provide any feedback about errors .
the keyboard was plugged into the experiment computer by means of a usb cable .
the subjects were asked to position the keyboard in a manner that was most comfortable , and to keep the same position throughout the experiment .
prior to any testing there were two warm - up trials .
for testing , participants performed three trials of the uni - manual finger sequence task with their left hand before and immediately after each tdcs stimulation period .
task performance for all three trials lasted approximately two minutes including short breaks between the 30 - second trials .
participants were tested with a different keystroke pattern for each stimulation condition .
within any one stimulation condition , the pre - and post - stimulation sequences were always the same .
keystroke patterns of equal difficulty were identified with pilot testing , and were randomly counterbalanced in ordering across participants and stimulation conditions .
the keystroke patterns all started and ended with the same number , with the other three numbers appearing once .
the following three keystroke patterns were used : left hand - 35243 , 34523 , 32453 .
to summarize the experimental procedure and task , the participant began with a short warm - up , including two practice periods .
the finger sequence used for the warm - up was not the same as any finger sequence used for experimental testing .
during a stimulation session , participants performed three finger - coordination trials .
stimulation was then applied for 20 minutes , after which participants again performed three finger - coordination trials .
data analyses we calculated the dependent variable as the percentage of change , from pre - tdcs to post - tdcs , in the sum of correct sequential keystrokes over three trials .
a participant could score up to four points per iteration of a sequence .
for example , if the sequence were 35243 , the participant scored one point for typing 3 - 5 , two points for 3 - 5 - 2 , three points for 3 - 5 - 2 - 4 , and four points for 3 - 5 - 2 - 4 - 3 .
a preliminary analysis of the entire dataset showed that there were trials across subjects and conditions that had many errors .
in order to avoid skewing the analysis with these outlying data , we developed a very conservative regimen for eliminating outliers .
outliers were identified as 30 - second trial periods for which the number of errors was greater than two standard deviations above the mean number of errors across all 30 - second trial periods .
if a trial was identified as an outlier , we not only removed that particular trial from further analyses but also the corresponding pre - or post - stimulation trial .
for example , if the first 30 - second period in a pre - stimulation trial set was an outlier , we also removed the first 30 - second period in the corresponding post - stimulation trial set .
across all 16 participants , we removed trials for eight outlier periods in total , out of a total of 288 trials .
the maximum number of outliers within an experimental condition was three , out of 96 trials per condition .
the maximum number of outliers for a participant across all conditions was two , out of a total of 18 trials per participant .
using spss 11 , the data were entered into a one - way repeated measures anova , with three levels for tdcs condition ( dual - hemisphere , uni - hemisphere , sham ) .
planned post - hoc analyses , with two - tailed paired - samples t - tests , directly compared the effects of dual - hemisphere , uni - hemisphere and sham tdcs ; though we had developed predictions based upon our previous findings [ 12 ] that would warrant using 1 - tailed tests , we used two - tailed tests to adjust for the fact that each independent set of data ( e.g. , data for left - hand performance with anodal stimulation over the right motor cortex ) was included in two post - hoc comparisons .
results and discussion all 16 participants completed the experimental procedures .
data for the three stimulation conditions are shown in figure 1 .
the values for the dependent variable for the three stimulation conditions were the following : sham ( mean = . 12 , sem = . 03 ) , uni - hemisphere ( mean = . 16 , sem = . 02 ) , dual - hemisphere ( mean = . 24 , s.e.m. = . 04 ) .
a repeated measures anova yielded a significant within - subjects effect of tdcs condition ( f ( 2,14 ) = 4.468 , p = . 037 ) .
this result shows that the effects of tdcs depended upon the stimulation montage .
post - hoc analyses with two - tailed paired - samples t - tests revealed significant differences between the effects of dual - hemisphere stimulation and uni - hemisphere stimulation ( t ( 15 ) = 2.58 , p = . 021 ) , and between dual - hemisphere stimulation and sham stimulation ( t ( 15 ) = 2.24 , p = . 041 ) .
the data for uni - hemisphere and sham tdcs were not significantly different , though there was a trend towards greater improvement with uni - hemisphere stimulation ( p > . 05 ) .
the significant effects were not due to differences in baseline scores across conditions ; a one - way anova with three levels ( sham , uni - hemisphere , dual - hemisphere ) comparing the number of points per trial at baseline yielded f ( 2,133 ) = . 30 , p = . 75 .
these results show that dual - hemisphere stimulation improved motor performance for the left hand significantly more than both uni - hemisphere and sham stimulation .

error bars signify the standard error of the mean ( sem ) .
dual - hemisphere tdcs improved finger - sequence coordination for the left hand significantly more than uni - hemisphere or sham stimulation .
further analyses explored which aspects of finger - sequence performance contributed to significant changes in performance .
using the proportion of change in the rate of keystrokes and the absolute change in the number of errors as dependent variables , we applied one - way anovas and post - hoc paired - samples t - tests ( two - tailed ) to compare the effects of dual - hemisphere stimulation with uni - hemisphere and sham stimulation .
the anova comparing the proportion of change in the rate of keystrokes across tdcs conditions ( sham , uni - hemisphere , and dual - hemisphere ) yielded f ( 2,14 ) = 4.96 , p = . 029 .
the improvement in performance for dual - hemisphere stimulation relative to uni - hemisphere stimulation was associated with an increased rate of keystrokes ( t ( 15 ) = 3.133 , p = . 007 ) , as was the improvement in performance for dual - hemisphere stimulation relative to sham tdcs ( t ( 15 ) = 2.371 , p = 0.032 ) .
the anova comparing the absolute change in the number of errors across tdcs conditions yielded f ( 2,14 ) = . 44 , p = . 53 .
though it did not reach significance , there was a trend for decreased errors for both uni - and dual - hemisphere stimulation relative to sham .
therefore , the tdcs may have its strongest effect on the rate of keystrokes , as opposed to accuracy of keystrokes .
we found evidence that dual - hemisphere stimulation ( simultaneously applying anodal tdcs over the non - dominant motor cortex and cathodal tdcs over the dominant motor cortex ) improved motor performance for the non - dominant hand significantly more than uni - hemisphere stimulation ( applying anodal tdcs over the non - dominant motor cortex ) , and also more than sham stimulation .
these data support our hypothesis that dual - hemisphere stimulation facilitates motor improvement for the non - dominant hand significantly more than uni - hemisphere stimulation .
we hypothesize that ihi mediated the additional improvement in finger - sequence performance for dual - hemisphere compared to uni - hemisphere tdcs .
the dual - hemisphere condition was identical to the uni - hemisphere condition , but for the addition of cathodal tdcs over the dominant motor cortex .
( the direction of current over the right motor cortex may have differed slightly between uni - and dual - hemisphere stimulation , because the location of the cathodal electrode was different for the two conditions ; however , miranda and colleagues [ 25 ] found with modeling techniques that the current density on the cortical surface remains relatively homogeneous across different electrode placements. ) we hypothesize that by decreasing excitability in the dominant motor cortex with cathodal tdcs , the stimulation dampened inhibitory projections from the dominant onto the non - dominant motor cortex , which released the non - dominant motor cortex and augmented the excitatory effects of anodal tdcs there .
increasing the excitability of neurons in a motor region may promote improvements in performance for the contralateral hand by facilitating long - term potentiation between activated neurons [ 7,26 ] .
practicing motor behaviors , such as finger movements , naturally heightens motor - cortical excitability [ 27,28 ] .
therefore , increasing excitability with tdcs , whether directly or indirectly , may provide a means of inducing a physiological state that supports acquiring motor skills .
it is notable that there was a trend for uni - hemisphere stimulation over the non - dominant motor cortex to improve motor performance for the non - dominant hand compared to sham , though it did not reach significance .
in our previous study [ 12 ] , we found an analogous trend when applying anodal , uni - hemisphere stimulation over the dominant hemisphere , and measuring performance for the dominant hand .
these data , therefore , provide further evidence that contralateral effects are analogous for both hemispheres .
further research is needed to determine whether ipsilateral effects are also analogous between the two hemispheres , or if there is an asymmetry in the ipsilateral effects on motor performance [ 4 ] .
we chose to focus on performance for the non - dominant hand in the present study for two primary reasons .
firstly , evidence suggests that the non - dominant hand has a greater potential to improve with practice compared to the dominant hand .
boggio and colleagues [ 10 ] found improvements in contralateral motor performance when applying anodal tdcs to the non - dominant motor area , but not to the dominant motor area .
they posited that the dominant hand already performed at a ceiling level prior to stimulation , whereas the less - adept non - dominant hand had room to improve .
in our previous studies [ 4,12 ] , we too found larger improvements for the non - dominant hand , which suggests that the positive effects of different stimulation conditions may be most apparent in the non - dominant hand .
secondly , interhemispheric inhibition between motor cortices appears to be asymmetric , with stronger inhibitory projections originating in the dominant hemisphere [ 17 - 19 ] .
further evidence suggests that ihi from the dominant motor cortex has a greater impact on motor performance [ 29 ] .
in light of these findings , it is unclear whether decreasing excitability in the non - dominant motor cortex would cause a corresponding increase in excitability in the dominant cortex .
in future research , it would be valuable to explore asymmetries in the behavioral and physiological effects of applying tdcs over the motor areas of the two hemispheres , and to conduct a complementary study to the present study that focuses on performance for the dominant hand .
there are two important points regarding the limitations of this study .
the first point is that the measures only revealed effects on behavior .
we did not use methods to collect data on neural excitability directly , such as measuring motor - evoked potentials ( mep ) with transcranial magnetic stimulation ( tms ) or by studying interhemispheric interactions using paired - pulse techniques and by testing the ipsilateral silent period [ 30 ] .
future research will be necessary to explore the neurophysiology underlying the behavioral effects found in the present study .
secondly , we did not test the effects of uni - lateral stimulation with cathodal tdcs over the dominant motor cortex .
for this reason , we cannot determine how much of the improvement in the dual - hemisphere condition can be accounted for by the cathodal tdcs .
this too needs to be addressed by future research .
neuroimaging research has shown that sequential finger movements engage primary motor , pre - motor , and supplementary motor areas in the brain [ 31,32 ] .
our results reveal that stimulating a region of cortex centered on m1 , in particular , can significantly influence complex motor performance .
non - invasive brain stimulation over m1 is known to affect basic motor behaviors such as speed , accuracy , and force of movement [ 33 - 35 ] .
post - hoc analyses in the present study revealed that the significant effects of stimulation were largely due to changes in the speed of keystrokes .
therefore , modulating processes that are most likely mediated by m1 , such as accuracy and speed , can have a significant impact at the level of a complex behavior .
these findings concur with previous research studies that have found significant effects on finger - sequencing performance due to modulating neural excitability in m1 [ 11,36 ] .
notably , the finger - sequencing task involves a life - relevant behavior - typing - which would be an ideal target for motor - recovery therapies .
the results of the present study may be relevant to clinical research on motor recovery after stroke .
researchers have utilized non - invasive brain stimulation ( tdcs and transcranial magnetic stimulation ) to promote motor recovery for stroke victims by either modulating excitability in the motor cortex of the damaged or the undamaged hemisphere [ 5,13 - 15,20,37 - 39 ] .
our results point to the possibility that stimulating both hemispheres simultaneously , with cathodal tdcs over the unaffected hemisphere and anodal tdcs over the affected hemisphere , may be an ideal montage for catalyzing motor recovery .
granted , the relevance of translational research with healthy subjects to treatments for stroke patients may be limited , due to differences in the mean age of study participants and stroke victims , and differences in brain function for the healthy and the damaged brain .
however , this paper opens the way for future clinical research along these lines .
a methodological issue with dual - hemisphere tdcs deserves some attention .
the tdcs technique involves the application of two kinds of stimulation - anodal and cathodal .
because of this , excitability always increases in one area of the brain ( underneath the anode ) and decreases in another area ( underneath the cathode ) .
this unique attribute of tdcs may be seen as a disadvantage if the aim of a study is to determine the effect of modulating excitability in only one part of the brain .
researchers have made attempts to work around this in two ways : 1 ) by placing an " active " electrode over the area of the brain that is the focus of the study , and a " reference " electrode over a different area that may be assumed to have no influence on the measured behavior [ 11 ] ; 2 ) by increasing the size of the reference electrode in order to reduce its current density , with an aim to decrease the effect of the reference electrode on neural excitability [ 40 ] .
however , some applications of tdcs utilize the potential for the technique to simultaneously apply anodal and cathodal stimulation .
for example , tdcs has been employed to treat depression by simultaneously increasing excitability in the left pre - frontal cortex with anodal stimulation and decreasing excitability in the right pre - frontal cortex with cathodal stimulation , which may be ideal for stabilizing mood [ 41 ] .
similarly , the results of our study suggest that dual - hemisphere tdcs over the motor cortices may improve motor performance in the non - dominant hand more than uni - hemisphere tdcs , with just anodal stimulation over the non - dominant motor cortex .
conclusion in conclusion , we found that dual - hemisphere stimulation ( with a combination of cathodal tdcs over the dominant motor cortex and anodal tdcs over the non - dominant motor cortex ) led to significantly greater improvements in finger - sequence performance for the non - dominant hand , compared to uni - hemisphere ( with anodal tdcs over the non - dominant motor cortex ) and to sham stimulation .
these results are relevant to motor skill learning and to experimental treatment strategies for facilitating , and potentially enhancing , motor skills in patients with motor impairments .

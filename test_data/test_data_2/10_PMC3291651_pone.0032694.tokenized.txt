placental malaria is a common clinical complication during pregnancy and is associated with abortion , premature delivery , intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight .
the present study was designed to delineate the underlying mechanism of placental pathology during malarial infection with special reference to oxidative stress and apoptosis .
experimentally , pregnant balb / c mice were infected with plasmodium berghei infected red blood cells on gestation day 10 .
the presence of malarial infection in placenta was confirmed by histopathological studies .
it was observation that infected placenta had plugged placental sinusoids with parasitized red blood cells and malarial pigments .
interestingly , we found significant increase in the level of malondialdehyde , the index of oxidative stress and decreased activity of catalase , the antioxidant in infected placenta .
furthermore , in infected placenta the oxidative stress mediated apoptosis was determined by dna fragmentation assay , ethidium bromide / acridine orange staining and caspase activity .
it was observed that oxidative stress begin after second day of malarial infection .
interestingly , it was observed that there was down regulation of anti - apoptotic protein bcl - 2 and up regulation of pro - apoptotic protein bax in infected placenta , suggesting the involvement of mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis which was further confirmed by activation of caspase 9 .
however , no change in the expression of fas gene and caspase 8 activity , indicated the absence of death receptor pathway .
thus , it can be concluded that the placental pathology during malarial infection is mediated by mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis occurring due to augmented lipid peroxidation which may in turn jeopardise the materno - fetal relationship .
introduction malaria causes about 2.7 million deaths annually worldwide , most of which are in children and pregnant women [ 1 ] .
despite all the efforts made to control malaria among pregnant women in endemic areas , malaria remains a significant cause of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity .
in sub - saharan africa , the world hardest hit area by malaria , the infection is estimated to cause 4,00,000 cases of severe maternal anaemia and about 2,00,000 infant deaths [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
malarial infection particularly caused by plasmodium falciparum is more severe and frequent in pregnant women than in non - pregnant women .
it is primigravidae who are more susceptible to the infection than multigravidae [ 5 ] .
malarial infection during pregnancy results in a wide range of adverse effects like anaemia , fever , hypoglycaemia , cerebral malaria , pulmonary oedema , puerperal sepsis , haemorrhage and even maternal death [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
moreover , maternal malaria often leads to premature delivery , still birth , intra uterine growth retardation and low birth weight [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
the symptoms and complications of malaria during pregnancy differ according to the intensity of malaria transmission in a particular area .
the non - immune , primigravidae are usually the most affected in areas of high transmission where 20 - 40 % of all babies have a low birth weight whereas , in areas of low transmission primigravidae and multigravidae are equally affected [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
placental malaria is mainly characterized by sequestration of parasitized red blood cells ( prbc ) , malarial pigment and infiltration of monocytes within the intervillous spaces of the placenta along with perivillous fibrinoid deposits , thickening of trophoblastic basement membrane , cytotrophoblastic proliferation , syncytiotrophoblastic damage , excessive syncytial knotting and fibrinoid necrosis [ 7 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
it is believed that all these pathological alterations alter the materno - fetal exchange system and result into intra - uterine growth retardation and low birth weight [ 15 ] .
sequestration of prbc in the placenta relies on the ability of p. faciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 ( pfemp1 ) present on the surface of prbc to adhere to chondroitin sulfate a ( csa ) and hyaluronic acid ( ha ) , glycosaminoglycan receptors found throughout the extracellular matrix of placenta [ 5 ] .
recently , it has been proposed that the strain of p. falciparum implicated in maternal malaria do not bind to cd36 , a nearly universal characteristic of p. falciparum [ 16 ] .
however , the exact mechanism underlying pathophysiology of materno - fetal organ , the placenta during malarial infection remains unexplored and warrants further study .
therefore , the present study was designed to provide a better insight into the functional impairment of the placenta during malarial infection particularly with respect to oxidative stress and apoptosis .
materials and methods parasite plasmodium berghei ( nk 65 ) was employed in the study and maintained in mice by serial passage of infected blood .

discussion oxidative stress has been implicated in pathogenesis of many diseases including malaria [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
during malarial infection , the antigenic stimulation activates the immune system of the body thereby causing release of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
in addition to host 's immune system , malaria parasite also produces ros resulting into haemoglobin degradation [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
however , oxidative stress during malarial infection is beneficial to the patient to combat the intra erythrocytic parasite .
excessive production of ros by recruited monocytes and neutrophyls at vascular lining , damage the cells and tissues [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] .
in the present study , high levels of mda , the index of oxidative stress have been found in the placenta of p . berghei infected mice , which correlated well with increase in percent parasitaemia with progression of infection .
this increase in mda level may be due to the inefficient antioxidant defence system , which is evident by decrease in the activity of catalase and unaltered levels of sod and gsh .
kulkarni et al .
( 2003 ) have also found the decreased levels of antioxidants during malarial infection to be responsible for increased oxidative stress [ 35 ] .
however , pabon et al .
( 2003 ) have observed that high oxidative stress during malarial infection is due to increased lipid peroxidation rather than from reduced antioxidant [ 36 ] .
in addition , high levels of mda in malaria infected placenta may also be due to the ros production by infilterated immune cells and infected erythrocytes in placental sinuses which may cause trophoblast cells damage .
in cerebral malaria too ros production by massively recruited and activated monocytes and neutrophils at blood brain barrier has been found to be responsible for endothelial cell lining damage [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
moreover , increased concentrations of tnf - alpha , ifn - gamma and il - 2 in placenta during malarial infection have also been reported to be associated with poor outcomes in human pregnancies .
however , in multigravidae high concentrations of ifn - gamma in placenta are responsible for protection against malaria [ 39 ] .
it seems that recruitment of immune cell in inter - villous spaces of placenta and associated increased tnf - alpha concentration and oxidative stress are responsible for placental pathology and pregnancy outcome during malarial infection .
furthermore , to investigate whether oxidative stress induces apoptosis in placenta , apoptosis markers , such as dna fragmentation , ethedium bromide / acridine orange staining , expression of fas , bcl - 2 ans bax proteins by rt - pcr and activation of caspases were studied .
dna fragmentation assay , ethedium bromide / acridine orange staining and activation of caspase 3 clearly demonstrated the occurrence of apoptosis in placenta that begin after day 2 pi. it is known that apoptosis involve two pathways , either death receptor pathway ( fas mediated ) or mitochondrial pathway [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] whereas mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is mainly initiated by down - regulation of antiapoptotic protein e.g. , bcl - 2 and bclxl and up - regulation of pro - apoptotic proteins e.g. , bax , bak and bid .
pro - apoptotic proteins induce apoptosis by forming pores in mitochondria , releasing cytochrom - c to the cytosol and binding to anti - apoptotic proteins to antagonizing their action [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] .
in the present study , the apoptosis occurring in malaria infected placenta did not involve death receptor pathway as no change in the expression of fas gene and activation of caspase 8 was observed compared with non - infected placenta .
however , the up - regulation of bax expression and down - regulation of bcl - 2 in placenta of p. berghei infected seems to be responsible for inducing mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis .
moreover , the activation of caspase 9 in malaria infected placenta also indicated the occurrence of mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis .
in the present study , increased ros production , oxidative stress and mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in malaria infected placenta are in accordance with earlier studies , where it has been documented that the generation of ros and associated oxidative stress are involved in mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] .
however , the present finding is contrary to the crocker et al .
( 2004 ) study , where no change in apoptosis has been found in placental cells during malarial infection [ 14 ] .
this difference may be due the different parasite strain and host .
moreover , the time when placental pathology was studied is also different in both studies .
in our study placental pathology was studied on gd 16 that is start of 3rd trimester while crocker et al .
( 2004 ) have studied placenta pathology in women after delivery .
based on the present observation it can be proposed that malaria infection in the placenta augments oxidative stress , which in turn activate mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis leading to placental damage .
thereby , suggesting that all these alterations occurring at the materno - fetal exchange system may result into placental insufficiency leading to intra - uterine growth retardation and low birth weight .

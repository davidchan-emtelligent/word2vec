background cryptosporidium spp. , enterocytozoon spp. , giardia spp. and cyclospora spp. are important intestinal protozoan parasites causing diarrhea in humans , livestocks and wildlife and have a significant impact on public health .
no reports exist about simultaneous prevalence rates or genotyping data of these four parasites in outpatients from china .
methods fecal specimens from 252 diarrhea patients in a pediatric clinic ( n = 169 ) and an intestinal clinic ( n = 83 ) of a hospital in shanghai , china , were collected between october 2012 and march 2013 .
all samples were examined for the presence of the four parasites by using molecular methods .
results in total , 76 / 252 ( 30.16 %) patients were positive for at least one intestinal parasite , of which cryptosporidium spp. , enterocytozoon bieneusi and giardia intestinalis were detected by nested pcr in 34 ( 13.49 %) , 34 ( 13.49 %) and 17 ( 6.75 %) of the fecal specimens , respectively .
sequence analysis showed that all cryptosporidium - positive specimens were c. andersoni and that most g. intestinalis - positive patients were infected by assemblage c , which is usually found in canids , while only one sample was from assemblage b. eight patients were co - infected with cryptosporidium spp. and enterocytozoon , while one was co - infected with cryptosporidium and giardia .
conclusions the patients infected with cryptosporidium and enterocytozoon bieneusi had higher infection rates in winter than in spring in this area .
data indicated that c. andersoni is the fourth major cryptosporidium species infecting humans in addition to c. hominis , c. parvum and c. meleagridis .
our study also revealed a short - term outbreak of cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis and sporadic cases of giardiasis that occurred among humans in shanghai , china .
cryptosporidium enterocytozoon giardia cyclospora outpatients genotype background cryptosporidiosis , microsporidiosis , giardiasis and cyclosporiasis are emerging infectious diseases .
cryptosporidium spp. , enterocytozoon spp. , giardia spp. and cyclospora spp. are diarrhea - causing intestinal protozoans of humans ( especially in aids patients ) , livestock and wildlife worldwide [ 1 - 4 ] .
although they are considered opportunistic pathogens , they have caused several outbreaks and emergency responses among humans and animals [ 5 - 9 ] these four parasites pose significant challenges to public health and water authorities , especially in developing countries because of the high prevalence and disease burden of the infections [ 10,11 ] .
furthermore , they exert negative pressure on the growth and cognitive functions of infected children and immunocompromised persons [ 1,12,13 ] .
cryptosporidium and microsporidia infect aids or immunodeficient patients , travelers , children and the elderly. c. parvum and c. hominis are the main human - pathogenic cryptosporidium species , while c. muris and c. andersoni are minor zoonotic species , for which small numbers of human cases have recently been reported [ 14,15 ] .
the prevalent microsporidia species e. bieneusi has been most frequently identified in human clinical fecal samples as well as in wild and domestic animals [ 16,17 ] .
molecular diagnostic tools have been used to trace the source of human infections and transmissions , thus confirming its zoonotic potential [ 18 ]. g. intestinalis is the etiologic agent of giardiasis , a common gastrointestinal disease in humans , livestock and companion animals. g. intestinalis is considered as a complex species and based on genetic analysis has been grouped into eight assemblages ( a - h ) [ 19,20 ] .
both assemblages a and b , which can be transmitted zoonotically , have a wide host range and are responsible for human infections [ 21,22 ] .
assemblages c - g appear to be strictly host - specific : c and d are found largely in canids , e in domestic mammals , f in cats , g in rodents and h in seals [ 1,23 ] .
cyclospora cayetanensis , an emerging human pathogen , causes severe diarrheal disease and has resulted in several foodborne outbreaks in humans [ 2,24,25 ] .
the transmission dynamics of this parasite are still unknown .
in previous studies , feces as well as contaminated water sources were considered as transmission routes [ 26,27 ] .
currently , no reports exist about simultaneous prevalence rates and genotyping data of cryptosporidiosis , microsporidiosis , giardiasis and cyclosporiasis in china .
therefore , this study focused on the prevalence and genetic characterizations of the four diseases in diarrhea outpatients of a pediatric clinic and an intestinal clinic in shanghai and assessed their potential zoonotic transmission .
methods ethical statement ethical clearance for the collection and examination of human feces samples was obtained from the ethics committee of the national institute of parasitic diseases , chinese center for disease control and prevention , china ( reference no. 2012 - 12 ) .
the objectives , procedures and potential risk were orally explained to all participants .
written informed consent was given to , and signed by all participating in the study .
parents / guardians provided consent on behalf of all infant participants .
specimen collection and dna extraction fecal specimens from 252 diarrhea patients in a pediatric clinic ( n = 169 ) and an intestinal clinic ( n = 83 ) of a hospital in pudong , shanghai , china , were collected between october 2012 and march 2013 .
patient details , including their age , gender , address , frequency of diarrhea and consistency of stools , were recorded .
specimens were collected from patients with fecal excretion heavier than 200 g and with no less than three events of diarrhea per day .
the stools consistency was usually thin and mixed with mucus or blood .
sufficient samples were collected for dna extraction and purification using the qiaamp dna stool mini kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) .
the extracted dna was stored at - 30degreesc for polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) .
parasite identification in clinical samples the small subunit ( ssu ) rrna gene of cryptosporidium was identified using a nested pcr [ 28 ] .
the presence of e. bieneusi , g. intestinalis and cyclospora in the specimens was detected using individual nested pcr and sequence analysis of the ssu rrna gene [ 29 ] , the triose phosphate isomerase ( tpi ) gene [ 30 ] and the 18s rrna gene [ 31 ] , respectively .
all primers used in the study are listed in table 1 .
go taq ( r ) green master mix ( containing go taq ( r ) dna polymerase , dntp mixture , green go taq reaction buffer , mgcl2 ; promega ) was used to amplify the genes of cryptosporidium and g. intestinalis , while premix taq ( r ) ( containing taq dna polymerase , dntp mixture , taq buffer , tartrazine / xylene cyanol ff ; takara ) was used to identify enterocytozoon and cyclospora genes .
each 25 mul reaction mixture contained 12.5 mul taq mix , 1 mul of 10 mum sense and antisense primers each , 1 mul dna template and 12.5 mul nuclease - free water .

a second reaction was carried out similarly .
each specimen was analyzed at least three times by pcr with positive and negative controls in each run .
the other amplification conditions varied in annealing temperature and extension time .
for enterocytozoon , the annealing step was at 57.4degreesc , and the extension step was at 72degreesc for 90 s ; the annealing step for giardia was at 57.5degreesc , and the extension step was at 72degreesc for 1 min .
the cycling conditions for cyclospora were as follows : the primary cycle consisted of 94degreesc for 1 min , 35 cycles of 94degreesc for 50 s , 56degreesc for 30 s and 72degreesc for 90 s , followed by 72degreesc for 10 min , and termination at 4degreesc .
the secondary step differed in extension time ( 72degreesc for 1 min ) .
sequencing of each gene secondary pcr products were directly sequenced on an abi 3730 dna analyzer ( applied biosystems , foster city , usa ) using the secondary primers and a big dye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit ( applied biosystems ) .
the sequence accuracy was confirmed by two - directional sequencing and by sequencing a new pcr product if necessary .
statistical analysis contigexpress was used to assemble sequences .
sequences were aligned using the program clustalx 1.83 ( ftp :// ftp - igbmc.u - strasbg.fr / pub / clustalx /) .
all statistical analyses were performed using spss version 17.0 ( spss inc. , chicago , il ) .
the chi - squqre test was used to analyse the data , with p < 0.05 considered to indicate significant differences .
nucleotide sequence accession numbers representative nucleotide sequences were deposited in genbank under the accession numbers kf271440 to kf271519 .
results occurrence of cryptosporidium , enterocytozoon , giardia and cyclospora cryptosporidium spp. , e. bieneusi and g. intestinalis were detected by nested pcr in 34 ( 13.49 %) , 34 ( 13.49 %) and 17 ( 6.75 %) of the 252 fecal specimens , respectively ( table 2 ) .
cyclospora was not detected .
the cryptosporidium - , e. bieneusi - and giardia - positive patients were not restricted to a particular clinic .
polyparasitism was observed in nine of the 252 patients , eight of which were co - infected with cryptosporidium and enterocytozoon , while one was co - infected with cryptosporidium and giardia .
no age - associated differences in the patients involved ( ranging from 1 month to 77 years ) was found in our study .

enterocytozoon infections based on sequence analysis of the ssu rrna gene , the microsporidia - positive outpatients were identified as e. bieneusi .
univariate analysis did not show any significant age - or sex - associated differences in e. bieneusi infection rates .
however , patients showed higher detection rates for microsporidiosis in winter than in spring ( p < 0.05 ; figure 1 ) .
giardia genotyping of the 17 giardia - positive patients , most isolates belonged to assemblage c , whereas only one belonged to assemblage b ; this result differs from previous reports [ 4,21 ] .
in addition , we found no differences associated with age , sex or season .
discussion intestinal parasitic infections remain an important pathogenic factor of diarrhea in developing countries , especially among hiv - positive patients [ 32 ] .
this study reports the epidemiological and genetic characterizations of four opportunistic intestinal parasites of outpatients from the pediatric clinic and intestinal clinic of a hospital in shanghai , china .
using nested pcr and sequence analysis in this cross - sectional study , cryptosporidium ( 13.49 %) , enterocytozoon ( 13.49 %) and giardia ( 6.75 %) were possible etiologic agents in this area .
however , cyclospora was not detected in these patients .
a high proportion ( 3.17 %) of polyparasitism was observed .
the presence of co - infections was supported by the finding that these patients exhibited the most severe symptoms , with diarrhea frequencies reaching eight episodes per day. c. andersoni is primarily found in cattle or in contaminated water [ 33,34 ] , while few studies have reported c. andersoni infection in humans [ 15,35 ] .
however , all cryptosporidium - positive patients in this study were found to be infected with c. andersoni .
the reasons for the occurrence of c. andersoni infection might be attributed to the environment , patient populations and geographic locations .
interestingly , our results were consistent with a recent study , which showed c. andersoni to be the dominant species in source and tap water in shanghai [ 33 ]. through genotyping , the researchers concluded that the contamination of source and tap water originated mainly from animal farms , especially , cattle farms .
similarly , c. andersoni was the most common species in the patients from our study , and sequence analysis suggested that contaminated water or infected cattles might be the possible transmission routes .
in addition , the yangtze river and pudong canal , which run through this area , are used for irrigation , livestock feeding and drinking water for residents .
extensive studies have reported seasonal differences in the distribution of c. parvum and c. hominis in the united kingdom and new england , usa [ 36 - 38 ] .
in shanghai , increased c. andersoni detection rates during winter may have been due to changes in animal breeding , rainfall , travel and recreational activities .
although e. bieneusi is nowadays considered to be an opportunistic pathogen in hiv - infected or organ transplant recipients , e. bieneusi infections have also been found in hiv - negative patients , immunocompetent and other healthy persons [ 39 - 42 ] .
a recent study described a healthy man infected with a novel species of microsporidium [ 43 ] .
in the present study , 11 diarrheal adults ( 13.25 %) and 23 children ( 13.61 %) were detected with e. bieneusi , which suggested that this infection was not correlated with age in the study area ( p > 0.05 ) .
however , humans were more susceptible to microsporidiosis in winter than in spring .
the reason for this might be a reduced immunity and resistance during winter .
studies have reported e. bieneusi to be associated with acute and chronic diarrhea [ 44,45 ] .
the sources of microsporidia infecting humans and its modes of transmission remain unclear .
due to the release of spores into the environment via stool and respiratory secretions , possible sources of infection might be humans or animals infected with microsporidia [ 4 ] .
genotyping results of g. intestinalis indicated that all but one positive specimens belonged to assemblage c , which is usually found in canids [ 46 ] , thus suggesting that dogs may serve as sources of zoonotic transmission of giardiasis in this region .
sequence analyses of the tpi gene revealed that the only specimen from assemblage b had a high homology with an isolate from a primate in japan [ 47 ] .
overall , patients in shanghai were found to be detected with c. andersoni , e. bieneusi and g. intestinalis .
these three intestinal protozoa can be transmitted through the fecal - oral or oral - oral routes , inhalation of aerosols or ingestion of food or water contaminated with fecal material [ 4,48 ] .
therefore , it can be speculated that family members may also be infected , although more questionnaires and comprehensive epidemiological investigations are required to confirm this hypothesis .
it has been reported that contamination of food or water by animals such as cattle or canids are causes of several foodborne and waterborne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis [ 49 - 51 ] .
in order to better understand the source of infection , we will attempt to seek the cooperation of patients involved in future studies to investigate their habits , such as contact with animals , drinking water and water conditions .
in addition , we will continue to monitor the patients from the intestinal clinic and the pediatric clinic to determine whether the observed prevalence rates will persist .
we also aim to extend the investigation to family members to determine the existence of a household cluster outbreak .
conclusions based on our study , intestinal parasites were common among the study population of diarrheal outpatients in this area in shanghai , china , between october 2012 and march 2013 , c. andersoni , e. bieneusi and g. intestinalis ( mainly assemblage c ) were the major parasite species .
the source of these infections remains to be tracked to determine their potential zoonotic transmission route .

using an unbiased structure searching method , a new orthorhombic cmmm structure consisting of zrir12 polyhedron building blocks is predicted to be the thermodynamic ground - state of stoichiometric intermetallic ir2zr in ir - zr systems .
the formation enthalpy of the cmmm structure is considerably lower than that of the previously synthesized cu2mg - type phase , by ~ 107 mev / atom , as demonstrated by the calculation of formation enthalpy .
meanwhile , the phonon dispersion calculations further confirmed the dynamical stability of cmmm phase under ambient conditions .
the mechanical properties , including elastic stability , rigidity , and incompressibility , as well as the elastic anisotropy of cmmm - ir2zr intermetallic , have thus been fully determined .
it is found that the predicted cmmm phase exhibits nearly elastic isotropic and great resistance to shear deformations within the ( 100 ) crystal plane .
evidence of atomic bonding related to the structural stability for ir2zr were manifested by calculations of the electronic structures .
first - principles calculations ground - state structure ir2zr intermetallic mechanical properties 1 .
introduction the platinum - group metals ( pgms ) - - osmium , iridium , platinum , ruthenium , rhodium , and palladium - - are immensely important in numerous technologies , but the experimental and computational data on their binary alloys still contain many gaps .
in contrast to other transition metals [ 1,2,3 ] , interest in pgms is driven by their essential role in a wide variety of industrial applications , which is at odds with their high cost .
the primary application of pgms is in catalysis , where they are core ingredients in the chemical , petroleum , and automotive industries .
recently , the ir - zr binary alloys have become a topic that is currently attracting considerable interest for their potential applications in aeronautics and electronics applications .
like ni - based alloys , ir - zr alloys have a two - phase face - centered cubic ( fcc )/ l12 structure , with the l12 ( ir3zr ) precipitates coherently embedded in the fcc ir matrix , and such an alloy with fcc / l12 interfaces has been found to have higher strength than the single fcc or l12 intermetallic [ 4,5,6,7,8 ] .
moreover , it has been demonstrated that , for a given alloy , some unexpected stoichiometric intermetallics would appear in its microstructure during different heating and cooling processes , which would have a great effect on the properties of the alloys [ 9,10,11 ] .
for instance , it has been reported that the phase transformation of irzr significantly contributes to the great high - temperature shape memory effect for ir - zr alloys [ 10,11 ] .
hence , an insight into the intrinsic properties of the intermetallics , such as their mechanical properties , could be of great practical significance for the design of composite materials .
the ir - zr binary system has been reviewed by okamoto [ 12 ] , where the phase diagram was based primarily on the high - temperature x - ray and thermal analyses conducted by eremenko et al .
[ 13 ] .
six known stoichiometric intermetallics - - ir3zr , ir2zr , irzr , ir3zr5 , irzr2 , and irzr3 - - have been determined , in which ir3zr and irzr melted congruently , and the others were formed by peritectic or peritectoid reactions .
the follow - up studies on their structures , mechanical , thermodynamic , and dislocation properties have evoked significant interest in their potential applications .
it is known that crystal structures are the key for understanding the mechanical properties of materials [ 14,15,16,17,18 ] .
thus , the crystal structures of these six intermetallic compounds have been extensively studied .
except for irzr and ir2zr , consensus has been reached that the intermetallic phases ir3zr , ir3zr5 , irzr2 , and irzr3 adopt cubic cu3au - type ( pm3 m , z = 1 ) , hexagonal mn5si3 - type ( p63 / mcm , z = 2 ) , tetragonal al2cu - type ( i4 / mcm , z = 4 ) , and tetragonal v3s - type ( i4 m2 , z = 8 ) structures , respectively .
for irzr , different room - temperature structures , including tini - type , feb - type , and crb - type , have been proposed , while a new orthorhombic cmcm structure was experimentally characterized to be the most stable phase for irzr [ 15 ] , and was confirmed by the theoretical work in [ 10,16,18 ] .
however , the crystal structure of ir2zr is the subject of continuing debate .
ir2zr was proposed to have the c15 ( cu2mg - type ) structure [ 13 ] , while recently , it was theoretically suggested to be unstable through formation enthalpy calculations [ 18 ] .
compared to irzr , experimental and theoretical investigation of the crystal structures of ir2zr have rarely been undertaken , and there is a lack of confirmed reports on the existence of ground - state structure .
therefore , the peculiarity and the absence of characterized stable structures of ir2zr prompted our endeavor to investigate its structural stability under ambient conditions .
furthermore , the explorations of ground - state structures and related mechanical properties would provide more insights on other ir - based intermetallic compounds .
in order to address these points , we here performed extensive structure searches to explore the potential energetically stable ir2zr phase at ambient pressure using the newly developed crystal structure analysis by particle swarm optimization package ( calypso ) [ 19,20 ] , unbiased by any known information .
this method has been successfully applied to extensive structures that have been confirmed by independent experiments [ 21,22,23 ] .
indeed , an orthorhombic cmmm structure is uncovered to be the best ground - state candidate for ir2zr , and the crystal structures , mechanical behaviors , and electronic structures of this new phase were then fully investigated in comparison with the proposed cu2mg - type phase .
2. computational methods the crystal structure searches for ir2zr were performed based on a global minimization of energy surfaces merging first - principle total - energy calculations as implemented in calypso code [ 19,20 ] , which was designed to predict stable or metastable crystal structures requiring only chemical compositions of a given compound at given external conditions ( e.g. , pressure ) .
here , using the calypso code in combination with vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) [ 24 ] , variable cell structure searches for ir2zr containing 1 - 6 formula units ( f.u. ) in the simulation cell were systematically performed at ambient pressure .
during the structure searches , the 60 % of the structures of each generation with the lowest enthalpies were selected to generate the structures for the next generation by particle swarm optimization ( pso ) operation , and the other structures in new generation were randomly generated to increase the structural diversity .
the following local structural relaxations and electronic calculations were performed using the vasp code , in which the generalized - gradient approximation proposed by perdew - burke - ernzerhof exchange - correlation functional [ 25,26 ] was used for the full optimization of all crystal structures .
the electron and core interactions were included by using the frozen - core all - electron projector augmented wave potential of the metal atoms including d electrons as valence states [ 27 ] .
the cutoff energy of 600 ev for the plane - wave expansions and dense k - point with grid density of 0.03 x 2pi a - 1 ( monkhorst - pack scheme ) [ 28 ] were used in the brillouin zone integration .
the total energy and stress calculations were performed by using the tetrahedron method with bloch corrections and gaussian smearing method , respectively .
the structural relaxation was performed using the conjugate gradient method until total energy is converged to within 10 - 5 ev and the force on each atom is less than 0.01 ev.a - 1 .
the phonon spectra of the cmmm structure was calculated by the finite displacement method , which is based on first - principles calculations of total energy , hellman - feynman forces , and the dynamical matrix as implemented in the phonopy package [ 29 ] .
the independent single crystal elastic constants were determined from evaluation of stress tensor generated small strain ( stress - strain approach ) [ 30 ] , and the polycrystalline elastic moduli including bulk modulus , shear modulus and young 's modulus , as well as poisson 's ratio , were thus estimated by the voigt - reuss - hill approximation [ 31 ] .
3. results and discussion under ambient conditions , the structure searches with the only input being the chemical composition of ir : zr = 2:1 predicted the most stable structure to be the orthorhombic cmmm structure containing four f.u. per unit cell , as presented in figure 1b , together with the previous experimental cu2mg - type phase figure 1a .
compared to the building block ( zrir10 ) in the cu2mg - type phase , each zr atom is surrounded by twelve ir atoms in the cmmm structure , resulting in a different polyhedron building block. by the full relaxations of both lattice constants and internal atomic coordinations , the equilibrium structural parameters of cmmm structure are calculated to be a = 12.477 a , b = 4.012 a , and c = 3.946 a , with four inequivalent atoms zr , ir1 , ir2 , and ir3 occupying 4g ( 0.653 , 0 , 0 ) , 2a ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , 2c ( 0.5 , 0 , 0.5 ) , and 4g ( 0.836 , 0 , 0.5 ) positions , respectively .
figure 1c presents the dependence of the total energy on the f.u. volume for cmmm and cu2mg - type phases ; it can be clearly seen that , for ir2zr , the predicted cmmm structure is energetically far more stable than cu2mg - type structure , and this further confirms our structural prediction .
moreover , by fitting the third - order birch - murnaghan equation of state ( eos ) [ 32 ] based on the calculated e - v data ( figure 1c ) , the zero - pressure bulk modulus ( b0 ) and its pressure derivatives ( b0 ') of cmmm phase is determined to be 235 gpa and 4.691 , respectively .
the dynamical stability of a crystalline structure requires the eigen frequencies of its lattice vibrations be real for all wave vectors in the whole brillouin zone .
as shown in figure 1d , no imaginary phonon frequency was detected in the whole brillouin zone for the predicted cmmm phase , indicating its dynamical stability at ambient pressure .
the formation enthalpy vs. composition plot , called a convex hull , is the set of lines connecting the lowest energy structures , and any structure whose formation enthalpy lies on the convex hull is deemed stable and synthesizable in principle [ 33 ] .
in the ir - zr system , the formation enthalpy of each irxzry intermetallic with respect to the fcc - ir and alpha - zr separate phases is quantified by the formula .
based on the calculated formation enthalpy for each irxzry intermetallic compound , we reconstructed the convex hull line for the ir - zr system , as shown in figure 2 .
one can see that the formation enthalpy of ir - zr intermetallic decreases when x < 0.5 , while the formation enthalpy increases when x > 0.5 .
the cmcm - irzr is the most stable intermetallic compound among all the studied intermetallic compounds , which is in excellent agreement with the previous works [ 18 ] .
the predicted cmmm structure for ir2zr matches evidently with the convex hull curve between the experimental l12 - ir3zr and cmcm - irzr phases , indicating the possible synthesis of this composition in the real experiment .
however , the previously proposed cu2mg - type phase for ir2zr is located above the convex hull line and possesses a higher formation enthalpy , at 107 mev / atom , than that of the cmmm phase , suggesting that the cu2mg - type phase for ir2zr is indeed metastable .
in addition , we suppose that the synthetic conditions of cmmm - ir2zr may be similar to those observed for the formation of ir3zr5 for their similar values for formation enthalpies presented in the convex hull line .
as a new intermetallic phase in the ir - zr system , the mechanical properties of cmmm - ir2zr are important for high - temperature applications .
table 1 and table 2 present the calculated results on the mechanical parameters of cmmm - ir2zr and cu2mg - ir2zr , including the single crystal elastic constants ( cij ) , polycrystalline elastic modulus , and hardness , which are determined from the calculated cij by applying a set of given strains .
under the stress - strain approach [ 30 ] , for a given set of strains epsilon = ( epsilon1 , epsilon2 , epsilon3 , epsilon4 , epsilon5 , epsilon6 ) ( where epsilon1 , epsilon2 , and epsilon3 are the normal strains and others are the shear strains ) imposed on a crystal , correspondingly , one set of stresses sigma = ( sigma1 , sigma2 , sigma3 , sigma4 , sigma5 , sigma6 ) can be determined on the deformed lattice in terms of first - principles calculations ; herein , the elastic stiffness constant matrix c links epsilon and sigma by sigma = epsilon c. based on the obtained elastic constants , bulk modulus b and shear modulus g are evaluated by using the voigt - reuss - hill approximation [ 31 ] , and the young 's modulus e and poisson 's ratio v are derived from the equations of e = 9bg = ( 3b + g ) and v = ( 3b - 2g ) = ( 6b + 2g ) , respectively .
the empirical model of hv = 2 ( k2g ) 0.585 - 3 ( k = g / b ) proposed by chen et al .
[ 34 ] employed here to estimate the hardness of ir2zr .
as listed in table 1 , the three independent cij calculated for the cubic cu2mg - ir2zr are in excellent agreement with the previous theoretical results [ 18 ] , confirming the reliability of the present results and the accuracy of the elastic constant calculations .
the mechanical stability of the predicted cmmm phase satisfies the born - huang criterion for an orthorhombic crystal [ 35 ] : ( c11 > 0 , c44 > 0 , c55 > 0 , c66 > 0 , c11c22 > c122 , c11c22c33 + 2c12c13c23 - c11c232 - c22c132 - c33c122 > 0 ) , thus suggesting that the cmmm phase is mechanically stable under ambient conditions .
in addition , the calculated results for the cmmm phase showed that the cij possess the trend c11 =~ c22 =~ c33 , suggesting that it is nearly the same uniaxial compression resistance along the three main crystal directions .
polycrystalline elastic modulus , another important parameter , also contains information regarding the hardness of a material with respect to various types of deformation .
bulk modulus b measures the resistance of a material to volume change and provides an estimate of its response to a hydrostatic pressure , shear modulus g describes the resistance of a material to shape change , and young 's modulus e measures the resistance against uniaxial tension. from table 2 , firstly , it should be noted that the derived hill bulk modulus b of cmmm phase ( 239 gpa ) agrees well with that obtained directly from the fitting of the birch - murnaghan eos ( b0 = 235 gpa ) , which further demonstrates the accuracy of our elastic constant calculations .
secondly , the calculated values of bulk modulus b , shear modulus g , young 's modulus e , and hardness for cmmm phase are close to those of cu2mg - type phase , indicating their similar polycrystalline mechanical behaviors .
thirdly , according to the pugh criterion [ 36 ] , the intrinsically brittle nature of both cmmm and cu2mg - type structures for ir2zr can be revealed by its b / g ratio of 2.038 and 1.920 , which is larger than the critical value of 1.75 .
the elastic anisotropic property , which is strongly related to the mechanical strength of solid materials , has important implications in engineering applications , such as microcracks , anisotropic plastic deformation , elastic durability , etc .
compared to the reported results of other known intermetallic compounds in the ir - zr system , the studies on the elastic anisotropic behaviors of this new cmmm phase are of great importance for its technical applications in high - temperature environments .
as outlined by panda et al .
[ 37 ] and he et al .
[ 38 ] , executing the appropriate coordinate system transformations for the compliances allows the determination of the variation of bulk modulus b , young 's moduli e , and shear modulus g with crystallographic direction , [ uvw ] , for a given crystallographic plane , ( hkl ) , containing these directions , ( i.e. , b [ uvw ] , e [ uvw ] , and g ( hkl )[ uvw ]) .
for orthorhombic cmmm phase , the bulk modulus b and young 's modulus e can be expressed as : ( 1 ) b - 1 =( s11 + s12 + s13 ) alpha2 +( s12 + s22 + s23 ) beta2 +( s13 + s23 + s33 ) gamma2 ( 2 ) e - 1 = s11alpha4 + s22beta4 + s33gamma4 + 2s12alpha2beta2 + 2s23beta2gamma2 + 2s13alpha2gamma2 + s44beta2gamma2 + s55alpha2gamma2 + s66alpha2beta2 where alpha , beta , and gamma are the direction cosines of [ uvw ] direction , and s11 , s22 , etc. are the elastic compliance constants given by ney [ 39 ] .
the shear modulus g on the ( hkl ) shear plane with shear stress applied along [ uvw ] direction is given by : ( 3 ) g - 1 = 4s11alpha12alpha22 + 4s22beta12beta22 + 4s33gamma12gamma22 + 8s12alpha1alpha2beta1beta2 + 8s23beta1beta2gamma1gamma2 + 8s13alpha1alpha2gamma1gamma2 + s44 ( beta1gamma2 + beta2gamma1 ) 2 + s55 ( alpha1gamma2 + alpha2gamma1 ) 2 + s66 ( alpha1beta2 + alpha2beta1 ) 2 where alpha1 , beta1 , gamma1 , alpha2 , beta2 , gamma2 are the direction cosines of the [ uvw ] and [ hkl ] directions in the coordinate systems , where the [ hkl ] denotes the vector normal to the ( hkl ) shear plane .
the three - dimensional ( 3d ) surface representations showing the variation of the bulk modulus b and young 's modulus e are plotted in figure 3a,c , and the distance from the origin of the system of coordinates to this surface is equal to the b or e in a given direction .
the plane projections ( ab , ac , and bc planes ) of the directional dependences of the bulk modulus b and young 's modulus e are given in figure 3b,d for comparison .
it can be seen that cmmm - ir2zr exhibits a highly pronounced elastic anisotropy , as its 3d picture shows a large deviation from the spherical shape , which qualifies an isotropic medium. from figure 3b,d , the distributions of bulk modulus b and young 's modulus e within the crystal plane bc display the largest and the smallest elastic anisotropy behaviors , respectively .
in more detail , the changes of young 's moduli along different crystal directions within four specific planes ( 001 ) , ( 100 ) , ( 010 ) , and ( 11 0 ) are presented in figure 4a .
for example , the variation of young 's modulus e in the ( 100 ) plane for the quadrant of directions [ uvw ] between [ 001 ] ( theta = 0degrees ) and [ 010 ] ( theta = 90degrees ) , the cmmm phase displays the smallest elastic anisotropy behavior ( as shown in figure 3d ) with a maximum of 254 gpa and a minimum of 240 gpa .
the selected directional young 's moduli along the five principal crystallographic directions are denoted as in figure 4a , and it can be seen that the calculated values for e decrease in the following order : e [ 100 ] =~ e [ 010 ] < e [ 011 ] < e [ 001 ] < e [ 110 ] < e [ 110 ] < e [ 101 ] < e ( 11 0 ) < e ( 11 1 ) .
similarly , figure 4b presents the orientation dependence of the shear modulus along arbitrary shear directions within these four shear planes .
compared to the other three shear planes , the calculations show that the shear modulus for a shear deformation within the ( 100 ) plane is not only nearly isotropic [ gmax = g [ 010 ] = 164 gpa and gmin = g [ 001 ] = 162 gpa ] but also has greater resistance to shear deformations .
to understand the bonding mechanism of intermetallic ir2zr on a fundamental level , the total and partial density of state ( t - dos and p - dos ) of cu2mg - type and cmmm phases at ambient pressure are calculated and presented in figure 5 , where the vertical dashed line is the fermi level ( ef ) .
it is clear that both structures are metal for the finite values of t - dos at the ef. the typical feature of the t - dos for these two compounds is the presence of so - called " pseudogap " ( a sharp valley around the ef ) , a borderline between the bonding and antibonding orbital [ 40 ] .
it has been suggested that the location of ef in the dos profiles can reflect the structural stability of the compounds .
for the cu2mg - type phase , the ef lies to the right of the pseudogap ( i.e. , within the antibonding states ) , suggesting their metastable nature , while for cmmm phase , the ef locates at the left of the pseudogap ( i.e. , within the bonding states ) with relative lower electronic density of state n ( ef ) values , revealing its structural stability .
these findings support the previous results acquired from the formation enthalpy calculations .
the feature of p - doss for both phases indicates that there is strong interaction between ir and zr atoms through d - d hybridization , which can be seen from the hybridization peaks of ir - d and zr - d orbitals plotted in figure 5a,b , signifying the existence of directional covalent - like bonding in ir2zr intermetallic compound .
a careful comparison further reveals that the p - dos of the ir and zr atoms in cmmm - ir2zr are more localized than those in cu2mg - ir2zr , resulting a small bandwidth of p - dos and a lower n ( ef ) .
it is known that for the most stable structure , there is enough room to accommodate all its valence electrons into bonding states , so as to bring the ef to a valley position separating bonding and antibonding states ( pseudogap ) favorable for structural stability .
therefore , the formation of cmmm intermetallic phase is energetically more favorable than the previously proposed cu2mg - type for ir2zr .
4. conclusions in summary , we have extensively explored the ground - state structures of stoichiometric ir2zr intermetallic compound by using the recently developed particle swarm optimization algorithm in crystal structure prediction .
a new orthorhombic cmmm structure was proposed as the best candidate at ground state that is energetically more favorable than the previous experimental cu2mg - type structure , as demonstrated by the total energy and formation enthalpy calculations .
then , the mechanical and electronic properties of this new predicted cmmm phase were fully investigated in comparisons with cu2mg - type phase .
the predicted cmmm phase exhibits nearly elastic isotropic behavior and great resistance to shear deformations within ( 100 ) crystal plane according to the directional elastic moduli calculations .
evidence of atomic bonding related to the structural stability for ir2zr was obtained by calculation of the electronic structures .

the human gastrointestinal tract is colonized by a vast community of symbionts and commensals .
lactic acid bacteria ( lab ) form a group of related , low - gc - content , gram - positive bacteria that are considered to offer a number of probiotic benefits to general health .
while the role of lab in gastrointestinal microecology has been the subject of extensive study , little is known about how commensal prokaryotic organisms directly influence eukaryotic cells .
here , we demonstrate the generation of multipotential cells from adult human dermal fibroblast cells by incorporating lab .
lab - incorporated cell clusters are similar to embryoid bodies derived from embryonic stem cells and can differentiate into endodermal , mesodermal , and ectodermal cells in vivo and in vitro .
lab - incorporated cell clusters express a set of genes associated with multipotency , and microarray analysis indicates a remarkable increase of nanog , a multipotency marker , and a notable decrease in hox gene expression in lab - incorporated cells .
during the cell culture , the lab - incorporated cell clusters stop cell division and start to express early senescence markers without cell death .
thus , lab - incorporated cell clusters have potentially wide - ranging implications for cell generation , reprogramming , and cell - based therapy .

introduction living organisms have been classified on the basis of cell structure into two groups : the eukaryotes and the prokaryotes .
however , genomic analyses have shown that bacteria can be as widely divergent in their evolutionary history as any prokaryote is from any eukaryote .
the prokaryotes comprise two distinct groups that are called the eubacteria and the archaebacteria .
thus , the living world has three major divisions : eubacteria , archaebacteria , and eukaryotes [ 1 ] .
the generation of eukaryotic cells can be explained by the endosymbiotic theory , which was advanced and substantiated with microbiological evidence [ 2 ] .
now , it is widely believed that eubacteria infected archaebacteria , genomic dna was transferred to the archaebacteria , and they evolved into eukaryotic cells [ 1 ] .
humans are in contact with components of the microflora from birth .
thus , a delicate balance exists in the symbiotic relationship between microorganisms and the human host during metabolic activities .
when considering the positive influence of microorganisms on eukaryotic cells , lactic acid bacteria ( lab ) deserve to be studied .
the lab form a group of related , low - gc - content , gram - positive bacteria and occupy important niches in the gastrointestinal tract of humans [ 3 ] .
to exert beneficial effects on human physiology , probiotic lab adhere to the surface of intestinal cells through mucin , extracellular matrix , and lectin [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
although the role of lab in gastrointestinal microecology has been the subject of extensive research , the effect of lab incorporation into the cells is poorly understood because the gastrointestinal mucusal layer provides a protective barrier between the epithelium and the lumen , which contains noxious agents and microorganisms [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
hooper et al. reported the global intestinal transcriptional responses to colonization , suggesting that commensals are able to modulate the expression of host genes that participate in diverse and fundamental physiological functions [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
it is likely that lab contribute to the function of digestive cells in the gastrointestinal tract through epigenetic effects .
thus , we studied the reaction of human fibroblasts , which are far different from digestive cells , when incorporated with lab .
to determine whether lab can directly affect human gene expression in general , we incorporated lab into adult human dermal fibroblasts ( hdfs ) and observed cell clusters similar to embryoid bodies derived from embryonic stem cells .
the lab - incorporated cell clusters expressed a set of genes associated with multipotency and differentiated into cell types of all three germ layers both in vivo and in vitro .
our quantitative rt - pcr analysis showed the higher expression of nanog in lab - incorporated cells than ips cells .
the lab - incorporated cell clusters stopped proliferating and expressed early senescence markers during culture .
gene expression profiling indicated a remarkable remodeling of hdfs , especially increased nanog and a notable decrease in hox genes , showing that the normal skin cells acquired the multipotency .
this study establishes lab - incorporated cell clusters as an accessible human multipotential cell type for a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of cell origins and reprograming .
results incorporation of lactic acid bacteria into human dermal cells to examine whether the incorporation of bacteria into a mammalian cell can reprogram the cell 's characteristics , we incorporated a lab ( lactobacillus acidophilus ; jcm 1021 ) into adult hdfs that were pretreated with trypsin / edta to remove their cell surface proteins .
after 2 - 3 days incubation , cell clusters ( 30 - 100 clusters ; 500,000 cells ) were generated similar to the embryoid bodies formed by human embryonic stem cells ( hescs ) at an early stage ( fig. 1 a - b ) , while no cell clusters were observed from lab - unincorporated adult hdfs ( fig. s1a ) .
the pretreatment of hdfs with trypsin alone produced a similar number of clusters ( fig. s1b ) .
at a certain size ( 50 - 300 microm ) , these cell clusters stopped growing and had a heterogeneous appearance .
direct application of lab onto the hdfs cultured on the dish did not generate any cell clusters ( data not shown ) .
when we used three other strains ( streptococcus salivarius subsp .
thermophilus , jcm 20026 ; lactobacillus sp. , jcm 20061 ; lactococcus lactis subsp .
lactis , jcm 20101 ) for the incorporation , they also demonstrated the ability to generate cell clusters ( fig. s1c ) , but e. coli ( xl10 - gold , stratagene ) failed to form cell clusters ( data not shown ) .
most of these cell clusters were attached to the dish and looked similar to those of hesc - derived embryoid bodies and / or muse cells isolated from stress - tolerant mesenchymal cell populations [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
moreover , these cells were not immortalized but could be maintained more than one month by replacing the fresh es cell culture medium one week after bacterial incorporation .
the lab - incorporated cell clusters were positive for alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) staining ( figs. 1c , s2a - b ) .
we performed rt - pcr using a bacteria - specific 16s ribosomal rna primer set and found this rrna band in lab - incorporated cell clusters ( fig. 1d ) .
further , the ultrastructural analysis indicated the localization of lab in the cell cytoplasm ( fig. 1 e - f ) .
cell clusters were also generated from gfp - expressing mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( mefs ) incorporated with lab ( lactobacillus acidophilus ; jcm 1021 ) ( fig. s3a - c ) .
the lab - incorporated gfp - mef clusters were also alp positive ( fig. s3d ) .

characterization of lab - incorporated cell clusters initially , we examined the expression of pluripotency markers by immunocytochemistry .
the lab - incorporated cell clusters after 14 days of incorporation were positive for nanog ( fig. 2a ) , oct3 / 4 ( fig. 2b ) , sox2 ( fig. 2c ) , and ssea - 4 ( fig. 2d ) , but not for ssea - 3 ( fig. 2e ) or tra - 1 - 81 ( fig. 2f ) .
double staining of lab - incorporated cell clusters showed the heterogeneous expression pattern of pluripotency markers ( fig. s4 ) .
next , we also assessed the expression of pluripotency markers by rt - pcr in lab - incorporated cell clusters after 12 days of incorporation .
as shown in fig. 2g , lab - incorporated cell clusters specifically expressed nanog , sox2 , oct3 / 4 , and tdgf1 , but not gdf3 , fgf4 , rex1 , or ecat15 , while ips cells expressed all of these markers .
to compare the cell characteristic , the mrna expression levels of nanog , oct4 , and sox2 of lab - incorporated cell clusters at 14 days after incorporation and ips cells were examined by quantitative rt - pcr ( fig. 2h ) .
the mrna expression level of nanog was upregulated in lab - incorporated cell clusters , while oct4 and sox2 mrna expression levels were low in lab - incorporated cell clusters compared with ips cells ( fig. 2h ) .
these data suggest that the cell characteristic of lab - incorporated cell clusters is different from that of human ips cells .

three samples were used in each group .
scale bar , 100 microm .
next , to determine the differentiation ability of lab - incorporated cell clusters in vitro , we cultured lab - incorporated cell clusters after 14 days of incorporation and examined the cell differentiation by immunocytochemistry .
when the lab - incorporated cell clusters were cultured in the floating condition for additional 14 days , they showed positive immunostaining for the ectodermal markers neurofilament ( fig. 3a ) and tuj1 ( fig. 3b ) , the mesoendodermal marker vimentin ( fig. 3c ) , the mesodermal marker desmin ( fig. 3d ) , and the endodermal marker alpha - fetoprotein ( fig. 3e ) .
rt - pcr analyses also showed the expression of alpha - fetoprotein , gata6 ( endodermal ) , and microtubule - associated protein - 2 ( map2 ; ectodermal ) in lab - incorporated cell clusters that were cultured in the differentiation medium ( fig. s5 ) .
furthermore , we cultured lab - incorporated cell clusters on poly - l - lysine ( pll ) - laminin - coated cover slips and continued cultivation for another 10 days ; the attached cells showed various morphologies .
immunocytochemistry detected cells that were positive for alpha - smooth muscle actin ( alpha - sma , mesoderm , fig. 3f ) , tuj1 ( fig. 3g ) , glial fibrillary acidic protein ( gfap , ectoderm , fig. 3h ) , and desmin ( fig. 3i ) .
the lab - incorporated gfp - mef clusters were also positive for neurofilament , gfap , alpha - sma , and desmin ( fig. s6a - d ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0051866.g003 figure 3 multiple - lineage differentiation of lab - incorporated cell clusters .
( a , b ) the floating culture for the neural induction produced clusters that expressed the neural markers neurofilament ( nf , a ) and tuj1 ( b ) .
( c - i ) differentiating lab - incorporated cell clusters cultured in the floating condition expressed vimentin ( c ) , desmin ( d ) , and alpha - fetoprotein ( e ) .

besides , we assessed whether the differentiation of lab - incorporated cell clusters could be directed by certain induction media .
for this purpose , the lab - incorporated cell clusters were treated to the conditions that induced differentiation into adipocytes , osteocytes , or chondrocytes .
we observed that osteocytes induction produced cells stained positively with alizarin red s ( fig. 3j ; 3 +/ - 1.2 %) , while adipocytes induction produced cells with lipid droplets that stained with oil red o ( fig. 3k ; 5 +/ - 3.3 %) and chondrocytes induction produced cells stained with alcian blue ( fig. 3l ) .
as shown in figure s7 , it is clear that the cell clusters were crumbled into the single cell and differentiate into adipocytes or osteocytes ( attached condition ) .
for the differentiation into chondrocytes ( floating condition ) , the size of sphere is almost the same during the sphere culture ( fig. s7 ) .
the lab - incorporated gfp - mef clusters also could be differentiated into adipocytes and osteoblasts with the above induction media ( fig. s6e - f ) .
to evaluate the multipotency of the lab - incorporated cell clusters in vivo , we transplanted the lab - incorporated cell clusters into the testicles of adult scid mice ( n = 6 ) .
the injection of lab - incorporated cell clusters into immunodeficient mice failed to give rise to teratomas after 3 months ( fig. 3m and fig. s8 ) .
in lab - incorporated cell cluster - injected testes , cells positive for human mitochondria and for endodermal ( alpha - fetoprotein ) , ectodermal ( neurofilament ) , and mesodermal ( alpha - sma ) lineage markers were detected ( fig. 3n - r ) .
these data demonstrate that lab - incorporated cell clusters can differentiate into cell types of all three germ layers both in vivo and in vitro .
cellular state of lab - incorporated cell clusters during culture we examined the cell growth curves of hdfs , lab - incorporated cell clusters after 12 days of incorporation , and lab - incorporated cell clusters after 12 days of incorporation cultured on the mefs .
as shown in figure 4a , when cells were dissociated into a single cell , there was no difference in cell growth rate among the three groups .
however , when lab - incorporated cell clusters were cultured and kept as cell clusters in human es cell culture medium , they stopped dividing and stayed as cell clusters for one month without any obvious cell death ( fig. s9 ) .
next , to investigate the cellular status during culture , lab - incorporated cell clusters after 12 days of incorporation were stained with sa - beta - galactosidase ( fig. 4b ) .
the cells positive for sa - beta - galactosidase staining were localized in the central region of lab - incorporated cell clusters ( fig. 4b ; 1 +/ - 0.7 %) .
further , the early senescence markers p15 , p16 , and arf were upregulated in lab - incorporated cell clusters after 12 days of incorporation , but not in hdfs or lab - incorporated cell clusters after 6 days of incorporation ( fig. 4c ) .
these data suggest that lab - incorporated cell clusters stop dividing and growing and remain stationary and multipotent .

( c ) rt - pcr analyses on hdfs and lab - incorporated cell clusters at 6 or 12 days after incorporation .
note that the expression of early senescence markers ( p15 , p16 , and arf ) was induced in lab - incorporated cell clusters at 12 days after incorporation .
gene expression profiles in lab - incorporated cell clusters to identify any transcriptional effects of lab incorporation during differentiation , genome - wide expression profiling was performed by comparing lab - incorporated cell clusters after 14 days of incorporation to untreated hdfs ( table s1 ) .
using a whole human genome microarray , we first considered those genes that were differentially expressed ( genes with expression changes of at least twofold ) between the hdfs and lab - incorporated cell clusters at 14 days after incorporation ( fig. 5a and table s2 ) .
unsupervised clustering identified three major clusters of genes ( table s3 ) .
the largest cluster ( cluster ii ) contained mostly genes with either higher or lower expression levels in the lab - incorporated cell clusters versus the hdfs .
accordingly , the most significantly enriched gene oncology ( go ) terms were associated with development in this cluster .
the second largest cluster ( cluster i ) consisted of genes that were high in lab - incorporated cell clusters but low in hdfs .
the analysis also revealed a cluster of genes that were low in lab - incorporated cell clusters but high in hdfs ( cluster iii ) .

( a ) expression profile of whole genes in lab - incorporated cells relative to the respective , untreated hdfs at 14 days after incorporation .
the gene expression profiling was performed in two independent replicates .
the guide at the right side of the figure indicates the expression difference between the samples with green ( indicating lower expression ) and red ( indicating higher expression ) .
( b ) expression profile of 37 selected pluripotency markers in the lab - incorporated cell clusters and hdfs .
we selected 37 genes related to pluripotency and compared them between lab - incorporated cell clusters and hdfs ( fig. 5b and table s4 ) .
the expression of nanog was increased 7.6 times in the lab - incorporated cell clusters , although the expression of other genes did not show significant differences .
as nanog is a highly divergent homeodomain - containing protein commonly afforded a certain position in the transcriptional network of pluripotency [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] and thought to be the gateway to the multipotent ground state [ 14 ] , we conclude that lab - incorporated cell clusters attain multipotency .
we found approximately 800 genes differentially expressed by a factor of 10 or more in the lab - incorporated cell clusters .
the go - based classification revealed that the differentially expressed genes were associated with early development , with a notable decrease in hox gene expression .
the 38 genes that are related to the antennapedia gene of drosophila species are subdivided into four clusters ( hox clusters ) , each containing 8 - 11 genes .
interestingly , 21 hox genes were downregulated in lab - incorporated cell clusters by a factor of 15 or more among 50 genes that had a go term of " development " ( table s5 ) .
these results suggest that lab - incorporated cell clusters lose their positional information and revert to multipotent cells .
discussion this study describes the generation of multipotent cells by incorporating lab into adult hdfs .
the lab - incorporated cell clusters can differentiate into endodermal , ectodermal , and mesodermal cells in vivo and in vitro .
furthermore , the lab - incorporated cell clusters are positive for a set of genes associated with multipotency and alp staining .
moreover , the lab - incorporated cell clusters stop dividing , retaining the cluster structure , and express early senescence markers to exhibit cell differentiation ability .
finally , the microarray analysis demonstrates a notable decrease in hox gene expression in the lab - incorporated cell clusters , indicating the loss of positional information .
these data suggest that the lab or lab - produced material ( s ) convert normal skin cells into multipotent cells .
the microbial colonization of the human gastrointestinal tract is an evolution - driven process that has beneficial effects on immune function , nutrient processing , and a broad range of the host activities .
mucus is secreted by the epithelial surfaces throughout the gastrointestinal tract and provides a protective barrier between the underlying epithelium and the lumen , which contains noxious agents , destructive hydrolases , and microorganisms [ 7 ] , [ 15 ] .
the probiotic lab adhere to the mucosal surface and prevent the growth of putrefactive microorganisms responsible for disease by competitive inhibition , the generation of a non - conductive acidic environment and / or the production of antibiotic - like substances [ 16 ] .
previous studies with germ - free mice have revealed that the microbiota are not functionally insulated from the mucosa , but in contrast , gut bacteria can fundamentally influence epithelial metabolism , proliferation , and survival .
in this study , we treated hdfs with trypsin / edta and exposed them to lab , resulting the incorporation of lab into the cytoplasmic region , as observed by electron microscopy .
depending on the efficiency of lab - incorporation into the cells in each independent experiment , the number and diameter of spheres varied .
although the molecular mechanism of the lab - incorporation is not clear , the cell surface proteins are supposed not to be involved in the incorporation of lab into hdfs .
it would be exciting to see whether the dead lab or extracts of lab also could generate cell clusters with multipotency .
gene expression profiles in lab - incorporated cell clusters demonstrated two interesting issues : the upregulation of nanog , a gene related to pluripotency , and the downregulation of hox genes , which are associated with early development .
nanog is one of the canonical quartets of transcription factors employed to reprogram human fibroblasts and dose - facilitate molecular reprogramming [ 17 ] - [ 19 ] .
furthermore , nanog is expressed in pluripotent embryonic cells and derivative es cells , and forced nanog expression is sufficient to drive the cytokine - independent self - renewal of undifferentiated es cells [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
hox genes encode dna - binding proteins that regulate gene expression and control various aspects of early embryonic development [ 22 ] .
mammalian hox genes are divided into two broad categories : a family of 38 genes that are related to the antennapedia gene of drosophila species , and the other group comprises more distally related genes .
these data suggest that lab - incorporated cell clusters lose their positional information and revert to the pluripotent state .
although many questions regarding the actual molecular processes occurring in lab - incorporated cell clusters remain unanswered , further epigenetic studies will be helpful to characterize lab - incorporated cell clusters .
pluripotent stem cells are able to differentiate into all types of cells in the body and have great potential for applications in regenerative medicine , developmental biology research , and drug development .
es cells , which are derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst , can differentiate into more than 200 types of cells .
however , the fact that the isolation and establishment of human es cell lines involve embryo destruction leads to extensive ethical concerns and debates .
ips cells , from fibroblasts with four yamanaka factors , share a similar gene expression profile and differentiation potential with es cells [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
although the successful derivation of ips cells solves the problems of ethical issues and immunological rejection , there are concerns about the safety of using ips cells for therapeutic applications .
the lab - incorporated cell clusters can avoid the safety issue because we ingest items ( e.g. , milk , yogurt ) that include lab , which have beneficial effects on human health .
further , lab - incorporated cell clusters can be readily generated with lab from patients themselves , thus solving the immunological rejection problem and ethical issues .
although lab - incorporated cell clusters failed to proliferate like es cells and ips cells , the area - specific transplantation of lab - incorporated cell clusters would be possible for safe clinical application .
it would be interesting to examine whether the incorporation of lab or lab - producing materials into cancer cells would induce cell cluster formation and change the cancer cell characteristics .
after the identification of the factor ( s ) produced by lab , the ultimate goal is treatment with patient - specific cancer cells and lab - producing factors .

abstract the present paper provides a description of the male caste and re - description of the worker and queen castes of the poorly known ant species lasius alienoflavus bingham , 1903 .
this species has hitherto been reported only from the himalayas , and the present data are also based on specimens collected in the north - western part of the mountain range .
likewise other himalayan ants , this species also shows restricted distribution , which suggests a rather high degree of endemism ( 45 %) of this group in the himalayas .
keywords ants taxonomy male caste formicidae himalaya introduction the genus lasius fabricius , 1804 is hithrto known to comprise 111 extant species and 3 subspecies ( bolton 2014 ) .
in the himalayas , 17 species have so far been reported , including 13 species from the indian himalaya ( bharti 2008 , bharti and gul 2013 ) .
a revision of lasius was published by wilson ( 1955 ) , where the author placed several species , i.e. lasius flavus ( fabricius , 1804 ) , lasius nearcticus wheeler , 1906 lasius alienoflavus bingham , 1903 , lasius talpa wilson , 1955 and lasius fallax wilson , 1955 forming the flavus - group in a distinct subgenus cautolasius wilson , 1955 , and provided a key to the palaearctic species .
seifert ( 1992 ) revised the subgenus lasius sensu stricto from the palaearctic , describing 17 new species , and updated wilson 's key to the palaearctic species .
other significant contributions form the palaearctic region include : bingham ( 1903 ) - key to indian species ; menozzi ( 1939 ) - key to the species of himalayas and tibet ; collingwood ( 1982 ) - key to the himalayan species ; kupyanskaya ( 1989 ) and radchenko ( 2005 ) - key to the lasius ( dendrolasius ) species of east palaearctic .
bingham ( 1903 ) described lasius alienoflavus bingham , 1903 from the himalayas ( above 8000 feet ) with reports of worker and queen castes .
later on purely morphological grounds wilson ( 1955 ) erected a distinct subgenus cautolasius and placed lasius alienoflavus in it. this subgenus comprises a group of species showing a mixture of characters that put them in a position intermediate between lasius sensu stricto and chthonolasius .
subsequently , collingwood ( 1982 ) discussed the worker and queen caste of lasius alienoflavus and provided a key to the himalayan members of the genus .
in the discussion part he mistakenly assigned the species to the subgenus chthonolasius .
recently bharti and gul ( 2013 ) provided a key for the genus lasius from the himalayas .
here we re - describe the worker and queen castes of lasius alienoflavus based on fresh material and for the first time provide a description of the male caste .
materials and methods the specimens were collected by handpicking .
the morphological analysis was carried on with the aid of a nikon smz 1500 stereo zoom microscope .
all digital images were taken with a mp evolution digital camera and subsequently processed with auto - montage software ( syncroscopy , division of synoptics , ltd. ) and adobe photoshop cs5 .
all measurements were recorded in millimeters using oculometer between 50x and 125x to the nearest 0.001 mm and have been rounded to the nearest 0.01 mm ( as the average recording error was approximately 0.005 mm ) .
specimens have been deposited in pupac , punjabi university patiala ant collection , patiala .
measurement hl - length of the head measured in full face view in a straight line from the middle of the anterior clypeal margin to the middle of the occipital margin .
the head has to be carefully tilted to the position with the real maximum . hw - maximum width of the head in full face view , behind the eyes . el - maximum eye length with eye in full face view . ew - diameter of eye measured perpendicularly to transect in el and across structurally defined ommatidia . sl - maximum straight - line length of the scape excluding the basal neck and the condyle . wl - weber 's length - the length of mesosoma in profile from the margin of neck shield to the posterior margin of propodeal lobes . pw - maximum width of the petiole from above , in dorsal view . gl - the length of the gaster in lateral view from the anterior most point of first gastral segment to the posterior most point ( excluding sting if present ) . hs - head size - the total of head length and head width divided by hundred . nhs - number of standing hairs projecting > 0.02 mm from dorsal profile of scape i.e. the number of hairs visible when looking at the small diameter of scape under transmitted - light conditions .
the always present hairs on distal apex are not counted and the number refers to one scape . nhht - number of standing hairs projecting > 0.02 mm from extensor profile of one hind tibia .
the always present hairs on distal apex are not counted and the number refers to one tibia . tl - the total outstretched length in profile from anterior clypeal margin to the posterior most point of gaster excluding sting . indices cephalic index - ci = hl / hw x 100 eye index - ei = el / hw x 100 scape index - si1 = sl / hl x 100 scape index - si2 = sl / hw x 100 taxon treatments lasius alienoflavus bingham , 1903 lasius alienoflavus bingham , 1903 - bingham 1903 : 341 ( w.q. ) india lasius ( cautolasius ) alienoflavus - wilson 1955 : 111 ; collingwood 1982 : 290 .

distribution the overall distribution of the species is from the himalaya but the specimens used for this study have been collected from the north - west range of himalaya .
all the collection areas were forested mountains surrounded by other mountains .
the nests were very close to the surface with a depth of 3 - 5 inches .
the soil surrounding the nest was mainly moist and covered by herbs .
23 specimens were collected from winkler extraction .
taxon discussion lasius alienoflavus bingham , 1903 is well marked off from other reports of this genus and is a distinct species .
however , it resembles lasius flavus ( fabricius ) but can be readily distinguished from it by having the apical segment of the maxillary palp longer than the preapical one ( vs. preapical segment of maxillary palp longer or equal to the apical segment in lasius flavus ) .

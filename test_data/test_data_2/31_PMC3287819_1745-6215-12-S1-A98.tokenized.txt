these include funding , of intervention costs in particular ; trial implementation in professional and organisational cultures unused to randomised trial procedures , including randomisation , maintaining the counterfactual , recruitment ; and relevance of findings for and translation into policy and practice .
objectives the current npri funded trial of sfp 10 - 14 uk is presented as a case study to discuss these issues , solutions and remaining barriers .
the sfp 10 - 14 uk programme aims to strengthen areas of family life that protect against substance misuse , for example , parenting , communication , and young people 's resilience skills .
the sfp 10 - 14 uk is being delivered by statutory and voluntary agencies in six local authority areas across wales , and is offered to mixed groups comprised of families from the general population , and families who may experience / present challenges within a group setting .
methods the trial aims to recruit 748 families , 374 of whom will be randomised to receive the usual services available to families within their local area .
374 families will receive the sfp 10 - 14 uk in addition to usual care .
families are identified by staff employed within the statutory services and voluntary sectors and referred to embedded research staff for recruitment .
results challenges encountered related to a lack of awareness of the randomised trial as a research paradigm among staff and key referring agencies , related concerns about the ethics of randomisation and the maintenance of the counterfactual among the usual care group , and challenges regarding the maintenance of recruitment and intervention fidelity .
whilst a challenge in itself , partnership working with delivery agencies , programme trainers , and the welsh assembly government at all stages of the development , funding and conduct of the trial has proved an important strategy to overcome these issues .
conclusions this trial seeks to generate evidence on the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the sfp10 - 14 uk which is of direct relevance to policy makers , commissioners and practitioners .
the trial highlights that strategic partnership working , the winning of ' hearts and minds' regarding the ethics and operationalisation of randomisation , and maintaining the balance between internal and external validity are key areas of focus for the successful conduct of pragmatic trials in non - nhs settings .
the lessons learnt from its implementation will be important for future multi - sector / agency policy trials and for role out of the intervention if found to be efficacious .

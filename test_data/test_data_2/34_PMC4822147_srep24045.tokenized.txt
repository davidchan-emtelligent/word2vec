previously we identified ubiquitin - dependent regulation of dmt1 involving the nedd4 family of ubiquitin ligases and the ndfip1 and ndfip2 adaptors .
we also established the in vivo function of ndfip1 in the regulation of dmt1 in the duodenum of mice .
here we have studied the function of ndfip2 using ndfip2 - deficient mice .
the dmt1 protein levels in the duodenum were comparable in wild type and ndfip2 - / - mice , as was the transport activity of isolated enterocytes .
a complete blood examination showed no significant differences between wild type and ndfip2 - / - mice in any of the hematological parameters measured .
however , when fed a low iron diet , female ndfip2 - / - mice showed a decrease in liver iron content , although they maintained normal serum iron levels and transferrin saturation , compared to wild type female mice that showed a reduction in serum iron and transferrin saturation .
ndfip2 - / - female mice also showed an increase in dmt1 expression in the liver , with no change in male mice .
we suggest that ndfip2 controls dmt1 in the liver with female mice showing a greater response to altered dietary iron than the male mice .
iron is an essential element for the normal functioning of cells and for animal survival .
iron uptake and metabolism are complex and highly regulated processes , which involves a number of enzymes , transporters and regulatory proteins1 .
iron levels are tightly controlled , as too little iron results in anemia , whereas elevated iron levels can lead to tissue damage and fibrosis due to the generation of reactive oxygen species .
the divalent metal - ion transporter - 1 ( dmt1 ; also known as dct1 and slc11a2 ) is the primary importer of non - heme iron , and is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body , with highest expression in the proximal duodenum ( main site of iron uptake ) 2 and liver ( main site of iron storage ) 3 .
the importance of dmt1 in the iron regulatory cycle is demonstrated by the fact that mutations in both humans and rodents result in severe hypochromic microcytic anemia4567 .
dmt1 expression and function are regulated by dietary iron availability through transcriptional and post - translational mechanisms , including modification by ubiquitination8 .
ubiquitination is well known for its role in regulating ion channels and transporters9 .
ubiquitin ligases , which catalyse the transfer of ubiquitin to the substrate , confer specificity to the system by targeting specific proteins .
the nedd4 family are members of the hect class of ubiquitin ligases , which bind to their targets directly through ww domains on the ligase interacting with proline - rich ppxy ( py ) motifs on the substrate10 .
members of this family , particularly nedd4 and nedd4 - 2 , are involved in regulation of membrane proteins , including ion channels and transporters10 .
a well characterised example of this is the regulation of the epithelial sodium channel ( enac ) by nedd4 - 2 , where the ww domains of the ligase directly interacts with the py motifs present within the three enac subunits111213 .
in some cases the substrates of the nedd4 family lack py motifs and the interaction can be mediated through adaptor or accessory proteins .
two such adaptor proteins are ndfip1 and ndfip2 , initially identified by us as nedd4 ww domain interacting proteins1415 .
in previous studies , we found that dmt1 is ubiquitinated by the nedd4 family members nedd4 - 2 and wwp2 in vitro , and this requires ndfip1 and / or ndfip281617 .
in mice deficient in ndfip1 we found increased duodenal dmt1 levels and activity , leading to increased iron uptake and storage in liver1618 .
interestingly , ndfip1 is also known to be upregulated in neurons in response to divalent metals , such as cobalt , and protects neurons against metal ion toxicity via nedd4 - 2 - mediated dmt1 ubiquitination and down regulation17 .
furthermore , ndfip1 has been shown to regulate dmt1 - dependent iron levels in the brain and play a role in parkinson 's disease pathology19 .
these studies indicate that ndfip1 plays a critical role in iron homeostasis in vivo .
however , the in vivo function of ndfip2 remains unknown .
in this study we report that in contrast to ndfip1 , ndfip2 is not required for duodenal dmt1 regulation but is likely to play a role in the regulation of dmt1 in the liver , particularly in female mice , which appear to have an increased sensitivity for iron perturbations .
we suggest that both ndfip1 and ndfip2 are required for regulating dmt1 in vivo , but they function in a context and tissue specific manner .
results characterisation of ndfip2 - / - mice the ndfip2 - / - mice used in this study were generated by the european conditional mouse mutagenesis program ( eucomm ) by inserting a targeting vector cassette into intron 2 of the ndfip2 gene ( fig. 1a ) .
this disruption results in a truncated transcript expressing exon 1 and 2 fused to lacz ( fig. 1a ) .
to genotype these mice , pcr was performed using a triplex reaction containing the primers listed in supplementary table 1 .
pcr with primers " a " and " b " produces a 558 bp band , indicating the presence of the wild type ( wt ) locus .
pcr with primers " a " and " c " yielded a band of 329 bp , indicating the disrupted locus ( fig. 1b ) .
immunoblotting confirmed that no detectable ndfip2 protein was produced in the ndfip2 - / - samples ( fig. 1c ) , showing that the knockout results in a null allele .
ndfip2 - / - mice have no developmental defects or gross anatomical abnormalities , and they live to an age comparable to wt mice ( ndfip2 - / - mice were followed up to 24 months ) .
this is in contrast to ndfip1 - / - mice , which develop a severe inflammatory phenotype and do not survive past 14 weeks of age20 .
ndfip2 is not required for dmt1 regulation in the duodenum in vitro studies using cho cells stably expressing myc - tagged dmt1 have shown that overexpression of both ndfip1 and ndfip2 results in lower dmt1 activity16 .
additional studies showed that ndfip1 - / - mice have increased iron deposits in their livers16 and that ndfip1 is important for dmt1 regulation in the duodenum under low iron conditions18 .
however , the in vivo role for ndfip2 has not been investigated .
to determine the importance of ndfip2 in dmt1 regulation in mice , we fed ndfip2 - / - mice either a normal or low iron diet for three weeks .
immunostaining of duodenum of male mice fed a low iron diet showed no difference in dmt1 levels between wt and ndfip2 - / - mice ( fig. 2a,b ) .
to determine whether the effect of ndfip2 on dmt1 regulation in the duodenum was sex - specific , we also stained duodenum from female mice ; these also showed no significant differences between wt and knockout mice ( fig. 2c,d ) .
furthermore , isolated enterocytes did not show any increase in transport activity in ndfip2 - / - mice ( fig. 2e ) .
this is in contrast to the ndfip1 - / - mice , which show an increase in dmt1 staining in the duodenum and an increase in transport activity in isolated enterocytes18 .
taken together , these data suggest that ndfip1 and ndfip2 function differently in regulating dmt1 in vivo .
as perturbations in iron homeostasis often manifest in abnormal hematological parameters , we performed a complete blood examination on wt and ndfip2 - / - mice .
again , unlike in the ndfip1 - / - mice18 , none of the parameters showed a significant difference between the wt and ndfip2 - / - mice in either males or females ( table 1 ) .
interestingly , male mice seemed less affected by the low iron diet than females .
while there was a significant decrease in mean corpuscular volume ( mcv ) , mean cell hemoglobin ( mch ) and red cell distribution width ( rdw ) with a corresponding increase in red blood cell ( rbc ) count in mice on the low iron diet as would be expected in iron - deficient anemia , there was no significant difference in hemoglobin or hematocrit as there is in the females , indicating that male mice are perhaps less sensitive to perturbations in iron levels than females .
ndfip2 maintains iron homeostasis in female mice by regulating dmt1 in the liver to assess the effect of ndfip2 on iron transport and storage , we measured serum iron and transferrin saturation , as well as iron levels in the liver .
in male mice , there were no significant differences between the normal and low iron diet in serum iron or transferrin saturation in either the wt or ndfip2 - / - mice ( fig. 3a,b ) .
liver iron levels were significantly decreased in male wt mice when fed a low iron diet , but ndfip2 - / - mice show no such effect ( fig. 3c ) .
female wt mice showed a significant decrease in serum iron and transferrin saturation when fed a low iron diet , while the ndfip2 - / - mice showed no significant decrease ( fig. 3d,e ) .
further to this , when fed a low iron diet , female wt mice showed no change in liver iron levels , but liver iron levels increased in female ndfip2 - / - mice on a normal diet ( fig. 3f ) .
differences in liver iron levels were confirmed by perl 's staining in liver sections , which demonstrated that male mice have very little iron deposition in the liver regardless of dietary iron levels ( fig. 3g ) , whereas female ndfip2 - / - mice on a normal diet show increased liver iron staining compared to wt mice ( fig. 3h ) .
since ndfip2 did not appear to be required for dmt1 regulation in the duodenum , but seemed to modulate liver iron levels , we next assessed dmt1 regulation in the liver .
total dmt1 levels were increased in liver lysates of female ndfip2 - / - mice ( fig. 4a , quantitation in fig. 4b ) but not in male mice ( fig. 4c , quantitation in fig. 4d ) , and liver sections from female ndfip2 - / - mice showed an increase in dmt1 - labelled puncta compared to wt ( fig. 4e,f ) , with no change in male mice ( fig. 4g,h ) , suggesting that ndfip2 is important for dmt1 regulation in the liver in female mice .
ndfip1 and ndfip2 share 52 % sequence identity and 79 % similarity15 and may function redundantly .
it is also possible that ndfip1 may be upregulated to compensate for the loss of ndfip2 .
we therefore assessed the levels of ndfip1 protein in liver lysates from wt and ndfip2 - / - male and female mice , and found that ndfip1 levels were unaltered in the ndfip2 - / - mice ( fig. 4a,c ) .
as ndfips are known to recruit the nedd4 family of ubiquitin ligases to regulate dmt181617 , we also checked the levels of nedd4 - 2 but found no significant change ( fig. 4a,c ) .
ferroportin ( fpn ) is the primary iron exporter in cells and is responsible for iron export from both enterocytes and hepatocytes2 .
hepcidin is a small peptide produced by the liver in response to altered iron levels21 , and ferritin complexes store excess iron molecules to inhibit their toxic effects and for release when required22 .
to determine whether fpn , hepcidin or ferritin expression was altered in these mice , we measured mrna and protein levels in livers from mice fed either a low iron or normal diet .
while hepcidin responded as expected by decreasing under low iron conditions , neither fpn nor hepcidin mrna levels were significantly different between wt and ndfip2 - / - mice on either diet ( fig. 5a,b ) .
ferritin also responded as expected by decreasing in mice on a low iron diet , but both ferroportin and ferritin protein levels were unchanged between genotypes ( fig. 5c,d , quantitated in fig. 5e - h ) .
discussion our previous work has demonstrated that ndfip1 is an important regulator of dmt1 in mice1618 .
to determine whether ndfip2 is also necessary for dmt1 regulation , we performed the low iron feeding study using ndfip2 - / - mice .
unlike the ndfip1 - / - mice , ndfip2 - / - mice showed no significant difference in duodenal dmt1 expression or any of the hematological parameters measured ; however , hepatic dmt1 levels were increased .
in previous studies both ndfip1 and ndfip2 were found to interact with and ubiquitinate dmt1 in a heterologous in vitro system16 , and ndfip1 was found to be important for dmt1 regulation primarily in the duodenum , but also in the liver18 .
the results reported here suggest that ndfip2 is dispensable for duodenal dmt1 regulation , but it may be required for liver dmt1 regulation .
both ndfip1 and ndfip2 are expressed in the liver ( fig. 4 ) , but the predominance of ndfip2 expression over ndfip1 may , at least in part , explain why ndfip2 appears to be the main regulator in the liver .
dmt1 has four major isoforms , differing at both the 5 ' and 3 ' termini ( designated 1a / b and +/ - ire , respectively ) 8 .
these isoforms are differentially expressed in various tissues , with the 1a /+ ire isoform being predominant in the duodenum8 , and the 1b isoforms being the major ones in the liver323 .
it is possible that ndfip1 and ndfip2 regulate alternative isoforms , which gives rise to their apparent tissue - specific functions .
further studies would be required to test this hypothesis .
interestingly , on low iron diet ndfip2 - / - female mice were able to maintain steady serum iron levels and transferrin saturation , whereas wt mice showed a reduction in these parameters ; this was coupled with an increase in hepatic dmt1 expression in the ndfip2 - / - mice .
hepatic dmt1 is responsible for transporting iron from the endosome into the intracellular space , where it is then able to be either released into circulation or stored bound to ferritin24 .
the higher levels of dmt1 in the liver resulting from the loss of ndfip2 actually place these mice at a competitive advantage over wt mice in that there is more available iron to be released ( as indicated by the reduction in liver iron levels ) to compensate for the reduction in iron taken up from the diet .
the stronger phenotype in the females may reflect a possible increase in sensitivity to iron levels suggested by hematological data , both in our study ( table 1 ) , and in work previously reported25 .
earlier studies have also reported sex - specific changes in iron parameters in mice on both iron - deficient and iron overload diets2627 .
the age of the mice used in this study may also account for the sex - dependent differences we observe , as changes in hematological parameters and tissue iron levels are potentially sex - dependent in young mice2829 .
nevertheless , our data suggest that ndfip2 is playing a role in dmt1 regulation in the liver , which is highlighted in female mice possibly due to an inherent sensitivity to iron perturbation .
male ndfip2 - / - mice seem to be able to maintain liver iron stores , unlike the wt males that show a decrease in liver iron .
this may be due to alterations in iron recycling by macrophages , which has been shown to be affected in cells and mice lacking the dmt1 homologue nramp13031 .
it has also been suggested that both dmt1 and nramp1 are necessary for the efficient recycling of iron by macrophages32 .
therefore , if ndfip2 is also a regulator of dmt1 in macrophages ( including kupffer cells in the liver ) , changes in iron recycling in ndfip2 - / - mice may explain the differences in liver iron stores .
indeed the increased iron deposition in the female ndfip2 - / - mice liver appears to be primarily in the kupffer cells surrounding central veins ( fig. 3h ) .
further experiments to evaluate the effect of ndfips on dmt1 and / or nramp1 in macrophages and iron recycling would be a worthwhile avenue of future study .
in summary , this study suggests that ndfip2 is involved in the regulation of dmt1 in vivo , and that while ndfip1 and ndfip2 function by the same mechanism of recruiting nedd4 family ligases to ubiquitinate and degrade dmt1 , due to their tissue - specific function , loss of ndfip2 alleviates the phenotype associated with loss of dietary iron .
this could have important consequences for the diagnosis and treatment of iron - deficiency anemia and other diseases associated with decrease iron uptake .
materials and methods animals the ndfip2 knockout mice were purchased from the european mouse mutant archive ( emma ) .
these mice were generated in a c57b6ntac background .
the line originated from eucomm embryonic stem cell clone hepd0550 _ 6 _ g09 ( international strain name b6ntac ; b6n - ndfip2tm1a ( eucomm ) hmgu ) .
this targeted mutation was created by the insertion of the l1l2 _ bact _ p cassette into position 105291701 of chromosome 14 , which corresponds with intron 2 of the ndfip2 gene .
the l1l2 - bact _ p cassette in composed of an artificial exon ( en2 ) , a splice acceptor site , and the lacz and neor genes , flanked by frt and loxp sites .
without the presence of flp or cre recombinases , this insertion results in a ubiquitous knockout ( ndfip2 - / - ) mouse .
animals were rederived , bred and maintained in sa pathology animal care facility and the university of south australia reid animal facility .
for iron feeding experiments , animals were fed ad libitum on a standard ( 164 mg / kg iron ) or low iron ( 15 mg / kg ) rodent diet ( specialty feeds , australia ) for 3 weeks immediately following weaning .
the studies were performed on 6 - week - old littermates .
all animal studies were approved by the institutional animal ethics and biosafety committees at sa pathology and the university of south australia , and were carried out according to the national health and medical research council guidelines .
genotyping dna was extracted from tail or ear fragments and pcr was performed using the kapa mouse hotstart genotyping kit ( geneworks , australia ) , according to manufacturer 's instructions .
to genotype ndfip2 mice , a common primer situated at the beginning of intron 2 was used for pcr with one reverse primer against the end of intron 2 and another found within the lacz gene of the trapping cassette ( fig. 1a ) .
primer sequences are listed in supplementary table 1 .
this triplex reaction results in a wt band of 558 bp and a knockout band of 329 bp ( fig. 1b ) .
the absence of ndfip2 protein in the knockout mice was confirmed by immunoblotting ( fig. 1c ) .
antibodies and reagents rabbit anti - dmt1 designed against the fourth extracellular loop of mouse dmt1 was a generous gift from dr michael garrick ( university at buffalo , new york ) 33 .
the production and affinity purification of a rabbit polyclonal against recombinant ndfip1 , nedd4 - 2 and ndfip2 have been described previously141534 .
commercial antibodies and reagents were purchased from the following suppliers : donkey anti - rabbit alexafluor - 488 and calcein - am ( life technologies ) , rabbit polyclonals anti - ferritin ( light chain ) and anti - ferroportin ( abcam ) , mouse monoclonal anti - beta - actin ( clone ac - 15 ; sigma - aldrich ) , donkey anti - rabbit hrp and ecl ( tm ) plex goat anti - mouse cy5 ( ge healthcare ) .
ecl prime ( ge healthcare ) was used as the detection reagent for immunoblotting .
blood and serum analyses blood was collected via cardiac puncture and complete blood count was performed by the department of clinical pathology , sa pathology .
serum was separated from whole blood using a 0.8 ml z serum sep minicollect tube ( greiner bio - one , austria ) with centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min .
serum iron and transferrin saturation were measured using a randox fe / uibc kit according to manufacturer 's instructions .
immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy 1 - 2 cm of proximal duodenum was fixed in histochoicetm ( proscitech ) before being cryoprotected in 30 % sucrose in pbs and then embedded in tissue - tek oct compound .
10 mum frozen sections were mounted on polysine slides , fixed with ice cold acetone for 10 min , air dried , then rehydrated with pbs .
sections were then blocked with 5 % skim milk in pbs for 2 h at room temperature and then stained with rabbit anti - dmt1 overnight at 4 degreesc ( 1:500 in 5 % skim milk in pbs ) .
after washing in pbs , sections were incubated with rabbit alexafluor - 488 ( 1:500 ) for 2 h , washed , counterstained with dapi and mounted in prolong gold antifade ( invitrogen ) .
confocal images were captured using a zeiss lsm 700 confocal microscope using a 40x / 1.30 water differential interference contrast ( dic ) m27 objective and digitized at a depth of 8 bits .
the fluorescence was sequentially acquired for multiple channels to avoid emission spectral bleed - through .
immunoblotting proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were immunoblotted with primary antibody diluted in tbst ( 137 mm nacl , 2.7 mm kcl , 19 mm tris , 0.1 % tween - 20 ) overnight at 4 degreesc , followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) or cy5 - conjugated secondary antibody .
visualization of cy5 signal was carried out on a typhoon fla biomolecular imager ( ge healthcare ) and hrp signals were detected on an imagequant las 4000 ( ge healthcare ) .
blots were quantitated using imagej software35 .
enterocyte isolation and fluorescence quenching assay enterocytes from wt and ndfip2 - / - mice were isolated as previously described18 .
briefly , the proximal duodenum was removed and flushed through then washed with solution a ( 1.5 mm kcl , 96 mm nacl , 27 mm sodium citrate , 8 mm kh2po4 , 5.6 mm na2hpo4 ) .
the duodenum was minced in an enzyme cocktail ( 333 u / ml collagenase , 2.5 u / ml elastase , 10 mug / ml dnase ) in krebs ringer solution ( 120 mm nacl , 24 mm nahco3 , 5 mm hepes [ 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid ] , 4.8 mm kcl , 1.2 mm mgso4 , 1.2 mm kh2po4 , 20 mm glucose , 1 mm cacl2 ) and incubated while shaking at 37 degreesc for 30 min .
cells were filtered through a 40 mum filter and washed twice in dulbecco modified eagle medium ( dmem ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 1 % nonessential amino acids , 50 mum beta - mercaptoethanol , and 100 mum l - asparagine .
to determine the relative transport activity of freshly isolated enterocytes , we used a fluorescence quenching assay as previously described16 .
cells were loaded with 0.25 mum calcein - am ( invitrogen ) for 20 min at 37 degreesc in loading medium ( dmem supplemented with 20 mm hepes ) .
cells were washed and resuspended in transport buffer ( 150 mm nacl , 20 mm 2 - ( n - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid ) and fluorescence was recorded using a bmg fluostar optima microplate reader ( excitation 485 nm , emission 520 nm ) .
readings were taken every 2 seconds for the first 20 seconds to achieve a baseline reading , then every 0.5 second after injection of cocl2 ( final concentration , 100 mum ; ph 6.7 ) for 150 seconds .
transport activity was calculated as the rate of fluorescence quenching ( slope ) observed in a 1 - min period after the injection of metal ions and is displayed relative to wild - type enterocytes .
perl 's prussian blue staining with dab intensification iron deposits in liver sections were visualised using the perl 's prussian blue technique .
sections were rinsed in tbst , then incubated in methanol for 20 min , followed by incubation in perl 's working solution ( 1 % hcl , 2 % potassium ferrocyanide ) for 1 h. staining was intensified using dab peroxidase substrate kit with nickel chloride ( vector laboratories , ca ) following manufacturer 's instructions .
neutral red was used as a counterstain .
rna isolation and quantitative pcr ( qpcr ) rna was extracted from liver tissue using trizol reagent ( life technologies ) , and was reverse - transcribed with a high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit ( applied biosciences ) .
qpcr was performed on a rotor - gene ( tm ) 3000 ( qiagen ) using rt2 real - time sybr ( r ) green / rox pcr master mix ( qiagen ) as per the manufacturer 's instructions , using the following themocycler conditions : 95 degreesc for 10 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95 degreesc for 15 s , 60 degreesc for 30 s , 72 degreesc for 30 s with the primers listed in supplementary table 1 .
expression was normalized to tbp by the 2 - deltadeltact method using rotor - gene ( tm ) 6000 software ( v1.7 , qiagen ) and microsoft excel software .
tissue iron quantitation small pieces of liver tissue were dried for 24 h at 85 degreesc after which they were weighed and digested in 25 % nitric acid in a glass tube at 65 degreesc for 16 h. the samples were then diluted to 1 % nitric acid and analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy ( icp - ms ) by the australian water quality centre at sa water .
values were normalized to dry weight .

blue shows dapi staining of the nuclei .
( e ) dmt1 relative transport activity as measured by the fluorescence quenching assay in enterocytes isolated from wild type and ndfip2 - / - mice fed a low iron diet show no significant difference .
data represented as mean +/ - s.e.m. ; n = 5 .
figure 3 sex - specific changes in serum iron , transferrin saturation and liver iron measurements in mice fed a low or normal iron diet .
( a,d ) serum iron levels and ( b,e ) transferrin ( tf ) saturation in male and female wild type and ndfip2 - / - mice fed a normal or low iron diet .
male mice show no significant differences in serum iron or tf saturation between normal and low iron diet in either wild type or knockout mice .
wild type female mice show a significant decrease in serum iron (## p < 0.0001 ) and tf saturation (## p < 0.0001 ) when fed a low iron diet , but ndfip2 - / - females are able to maintain their levels when challenged .
* represents a significant difference in serum iron ( p = 0.0232 ) and tf saturation ( p = 0.008 ) between wild type and knockout females fed a normal diet .
** represents a significant difference in serum iron ( p = 0.0008 ) and tf saturation ( p = 0.0021 ) between wild type and knockout females fed a low iron diet .
( c,f ) liver iron levels in wild type and ndfip2 - / - mice fed a normal or low iron diet .
wild type males show a significant reduction in liver iron levels when fed a low iron diet (## p = 0.0425 ) , but ndfip2 - / - males are able to maintain liver iron levels .
ndfip2 - / - females show a decrease in liver iron levels (## p = 0.0276 ) .

( g ) liver iron levels in male and ( h ) female mice as measured by perl 's prussian blue staining .
ndfip2 - / - female mice fed a normal diet show significant iron deposits compared to wild type mice , and male mice do not show any significant staining .
figure 4 dmt1 expression is increased in the liver of female ndfip2 - / - mice , and there is no compensation for loss of ndfip2 by ndfip1 or nedd4 - 2 .
( a ) western blot showing levels of ndfip1 , nedd4 - 2 , dmt1 and ndfip2 in female and ( c ) male liver protein lysates .
there is no change seen in the levels of ndfip1 or nedd4 - 2 in ndfip2 - / - samples , indicating no compensation is occurring .
dmt1 levels are increased in ndfip2 - / - female mice , but unchanged in male mice , suggesting that ndfip2 is important for liver dmt1 regulation in females .
beta - actin acts as a loading control .
( b,d ) quantitation of dmt1 expression relative to beta - actin in liver samples from ( a,c ) showing significant upregualation of dmt1 in female ndfip2 - / - mice .

figure 5 ferroportin , ferritin and hepcidin levels are unaffected by loss of ndfip2 .
( a ) ferroportin ( fpn ) and ( b ) hepcidin ( hamp ) mrna levels expressed relative to tata box binding protein ( tbp ) are not significant between wild type and ndfip2 - / - mice fed either a low iron or normal diet .
hepcidin levels significantly decrease as expected in both the wild type and ndfip2 - / - mice fed a low iron diet (* p = 0.0402 , # p = 0.0009 ) .
( c ) fpn and ferritin ( light chain ) protein levels in liver lysates from wild type and ndfip2 - / - female and ( d ) male mice showing no difference in expression between genotypes .
the dotted line in d indicates that the right and left sides of the blots are from different gels .
this is quantitated in ( e - h ) showing no significant difference between genotypes .
* indicates significant differences in ferritin levels between diets as expected ( p < 0.05 ) .

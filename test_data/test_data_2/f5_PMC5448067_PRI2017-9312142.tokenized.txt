objectives immunoglobulin g4 - related disease ( igg4 - rd ) is a multiorgan condition manifesting itself in different forms .
this study aimed to investigate protein expression profiles and to find the possible biomarker for igg4 - rd by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( lc - ms ) using tissue sections in igg4 - rd patients .
methods protein expression profiles in five igg4 - related pancreatitis and three normal pancreatic samples were compared using lc - ms and were validated by quantitative real - time pcr ( qrt - pcr ) , immunoblotting , and immunohistochemistry .
elisa was employed in the serum of 20 patients with systemic igg4 - rd before and during steroid treatment .
results lc - ms indicated that the levels of 17 proteins were significantly higher and 12 others were significantly lower in igg4 - related pancreatitis patients compared to controls .
among these proteins , galectin - 3 levels were 13 - fold higher in igg4 - related pancreatitis ( p < 0.01 ) .
these results were confirmed by immunoblotting and qrt - pcr .
the average number of galectin - 3 + cells in various organs of igg4 - rd patients , including salivary glands , lungs , and lymph nodes , was higher than in controls .
galectin - 3 was detectable in macrophages , dendritic cells , and stromal myofibroblast - like cells , but not in lymphocytes by immunofluorescence staining .
serum galectin - 3 levels were higher in patients with igg4 - rd compared with healthy donors and remained high during steroid therapy .
conclusion galectin - 3 was overexpressed in igg4 - rd and the levels were indirectly related to clinical activity .

introduction immunoglobulin g4 - related disease ( igg4 - rd ) is an autoimmune multiorgan condition , characterized by a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with a high number of igg4 - positive plasma cells and high igg4 levels in serum [ 1 , 2 ] .
the disease has an indolent course and may only be detected after complications dependent on masses [ 1 , 2 ] .
igg4 is synthesized and secreted by plasma cells as a part of an immune - protective mechanism and accounts for less than 5 % of the total igg in the serum of healthy individuals .
igg4 is generally considered as an anti - inflammatory immunoglobulin , because the ability to fix complement and bind activating fc receptors is limited [ 3 ] .
thus , it is unclear if this immunoglobulin links to disease pathogenesis [ 2 , 4 ] .
chronic antigen exposure stimulates igg4 production , leading to a shift in the igg4 : igg1 ratio .
the mechanism driving this switch still remains unclear .
however , th2 interleukins such as il - 4 , il - 5 , and il - 13 can mediate the transition from igg1 to igg4 [ 4 , 5 ] .
th2s in cd4 + t cells and regulatory t cells play a role in the excessive production of igg4 and stromal fibrosis in igg4 - rd [ 6 - 9 ] .
however , more recent studies show an abundance of cd4 + cytotoxic t cells and a paucity of th2 cells in igg4 - rd [ 10 , 11 ] .
about 50 % of igg4 - rd patients have also allergic diseases [ 2 , 12 ] and these conflicting results may come from igg4 - rd with or without a history of atopy [ 13 ] .
nevertheless , the etiology and pathogenesis of igg4 - rd are not well known .
recent advancements in technical procedures and bioinformatic methods improved the sensitivity of mass spectrometry , making proteomic analysis on formalin - fixed paraffin embedded ( ffpe ) tissues possible [ 14 ] .
in this paper , we aimed to investigate protein expression profiles in igg4 - rd and to identify possible biomarkers against this condition using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( lc - ms ) .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( lc - ms ) proteins for lc - ms analysis were extracted from ffpe tissue samples ( five igg4 - related pancreatitis and three normal pancreas tissue ) using the liquid tissue ms protein prep kit ( expression pathology inc , rockville , md , usa ) [ 15 ] .
all cases analyzed for lc - ms were the partial resection for pancreas .
for normal pancreas tissues , negative surgical margins taken at resection for pancreatic cancer were selected .
briefly , after deparaffinization , three 0.4 mum thick tissue sections ( 10 x 10 mm ) were dissected using a needle and solubilized in 20 ul of liquid tissue buffer and protein digestion was performed with trypsin ( promega corp , madison , wi , usa ) for 18 h at 37degreesc .
samples were dried and solubilized in 0.1 % formic acid ( wako , osaka , japan ) and 1 mug aliquots for each sample were separated by nanoflow reversed - phase lc ( nanolc - ultra 2d - plus , eksigent , dublin , ca , usa ) equipped with chiplc nanoflex ( eksigent ) .
eluted peptides were analyzed by a quadrupole - time - of - flight hybrid mass spectrometer ( triple tof5600 + system , ab sciex , framingham , ma , usa ) .
2.2 .
peptides identification and quantification mass spectra were searched against the uniprot / swissprot human proteomic database ( 2014 - 6 release ) from the european bioinformatics institute using proteinpilot version 4.5beta ( ab sciex ) .
false discovery rates ( fdrs ) were determined after peptide / protein identification using proteomic system performance evaluation pipeline provided as a part of proteinpilot ( ab sciex ) .
label - free quantification of peptides was performed using progenesis qi for proteomics ( nonlinear dynamics , newcastle upon tyne , uk ) .
proteins identified by at least two distinct peptides were used for further analysis .
2.3 .
immunoblotting immunoblot analysis was performed for protein extracts from ffpe tissues using the qproteome ffpe tissue kit ( qiagen , venlo , netherlands ) .
the antibodies used were anti - galectin - 3 ( 9c4 , abcam , cambridge , uk , 1 : 1000 dilution ) and anti - beta - actin ( abcam , 1 : 1000 ) .
protein bands were visualized with a chemiluminescence substrate ( chemi - lumi one l , nacalai tesque , kyoto , japan ) , and blots were imaged using ez - capture mg ( daihan scientific co. , ltd. , gangwon - do , south korea ) .
bands were analyzed using the cs analyzer ( atto corporation , tokyo , japan ) .
2.4 .
real - time quantitative pcr ( qrt - pcr ) total rna was extracted from ffpe samples using the nucleospin total rna ffpe kit ( macherey - nagel , duren , germany ) .
cdna synthesis was performed using the revertra ace qpcr rt kit ( toyobo , osaka , japan ) .
amplifications were carried out in triplicate on a 96 - well plate in a 10 mul volume per well using fast sybr green master mix ( applied biosystems , life technologies , carlsbad , ca , usa ) .
these reactions were performed with an applied biosystems 7500 fast real - time pcr machine .
expression was normalized to gapdh , using the 2 - deltadeltact method .
the primer sequences were lgals3 ( forward : 5 ' - gcctcgcatgctgataacaa - 3 ' , reverse : 5 ' - cgtgggttaaagtggaaggc - 3 ') and gapdh ( forward : 5 ' - ggtatcgtggaaggactcatgac - 3 ' , reverse : 5 ' - atgccagtgagcttcccgttcagc - 3 ') .
2.5 .
immunohistochemistry analyzed specimens comprised of ffpe tissues from igg4 - rd patients retrieved from the archive of the department of diagnostic pathology , kyoto university hospital : pancreas ( n = 5 ) , bile duct ( n = 3 ) , retroperitoneum ( n = 1 ) , aorta ( n = 1 ) , kidney ( n = 2 ) , salivary gland ( n = 6 ) , lung ( n = 4 ) , ureter ( n = 1 ) , and lymph node ( n = 6 ) from 29 patients between january 2007 and august 2015 .
paraffin embedded sections from igg4 - rd patients were immunostained with the following antibodies : alpha - smooth muscle actin ( 1a4 , sigma aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa , 1 : 300 ) , cd3 ( f7.2.38 , dakocytomation , glostrup , denmark , 1 : 50 ) , cd11c ( 5d11 , cell marque , rocklin , ca , 1 : 50 ) , cd123 ( 6h6 , ebioscience , san diego , ca , usa , 1 : 100 ) , cd20 ( clone l26 , mouse monoclonal , dakocytomation , 1 : 1 ) , cd68 ( pgm1 , dakocytomation , 1 : 10 ) , galectin - 3 ( 1 : 100 ) , igg ( epr4421 , abcam , 1 : 50 ) , and igg4 ( hp6025 , nichirei biosciences inc. , tokyo , japan , 1 : 1 ) .
the real ( tm ) envision ( tm )/ hrp detection system ( dakocytomation , glostrup , denmark ) was used to detect immunohistochemical signals .
double immunofluorescence staining was performed using the tsa plus fluorescence kit ( perkinelmer inc. , waltham , ma , usa ) .
2.6 .
enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) elisa was used to measure galectin - 3 and igg4 levels in 37 serum samples from 20 patients with systemic igg4 - rd before and during prednisolone ( psl ) treatment ( pretreatment sera were available from 11 patients ) and from five healthy control individuals ( human galectin - 3 quantikine elisa kit , r & d systems , inc , minneapolis , mn , usa , and human igg subclass profile , novex , life technologies , frederick , md , usa , resp. ) .
all experiments were performed in duplicate .
results were compared with samples of patients treated with a tapering dose of psl .
2.7 .
patient consent and confidentiality sample collection and use of clinical records were authorized under the written consent of patients , and the study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the declaration of helsinki .
the ethics committee of kyoto university approved this study ( r0305 ) .
2.8 .
statistical analysis data were analyzed with graphpad prism 6 ( mdf , tokyo , japan ) or r version 3.2.0 .
to compare continuous variables , unpaired student 's t - test or mann - whitney u test and two - way analysis of variance ( anova ) followed by bonferroni 's multiple comparisons test were used .
differences with a p value smaller than 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
3. results 3.1 .
protein identification and quantification lc - ms revealed that 956 proteins were differentially expressed between igg4 - related pancreatitis and normal pancreatic samples ( figures 1 ( a ) , 1 ( b ) , 1 ( c ) , and 1 ( d )) .
among these , 352 were significantly upregulated and 604 were downregulated in igg4 - related pancreatitis samples compared with normal pancreatic tissues ( figure 1 ( e )) .
proteins with high confidence values ( p value < 0.05 ) and showing a twofold difference in their expression between igg4 - related pancreatitis and normal pancreatic samples were selected for further analysis ; the levels of 17 proteins were higher and those of 12 proteins were lower in igg4 - related pancreatitis tissues than in healthy pancreas ( table 1 ) .
we selected galectin - 3 , as it was one of the highly upregulated proteins in igg4 - related pancreatitis ( 13 - fold , p value 0.013 ) .
3.2 .
validation of proteomic data by qrt - pcr , immunoblotting , and immunohistochemistry igg4 - related pancreatitis samples ( n = 5 ) showed a 3 - fold up - regulation of lgals - 3 expression compared with healthy pancreas ( n = 4 ; figure 2 ( a )) .
immunoblotting showed that galectin - 3 protein levels in the same samples as qrt - pcr were 5.1 - fold higher in igg4 - related pancreatitis samples than that of normal pancreas ( figures 2 ( b ) and 2 ( c )) .
immunohistochemical analysis showed that galectin - 3 mostly stained stromal spindle cells , macrophages - like cells , and epithelial cells , but not mononuclear lymphocyte - like cells ( figures 2 ( d ) and 2 ( e )) .
3.3 .
galectin - 3 is highly expressed in different organs with igg4 - rd to measure the expression of galectin - 3 in different organs of igg4 - rd patients , ffpe samples from various organs were stained with anti - galectin - 3 antibodies .
since we focused on immune cells , but not on epithelial cells , we counted galectin - 3 - positive cells in the stroma , including immune and fibroblast - like cells but excluding galectin - 3 - positive epithelial cells , in high - power fields ( hpf ) from each specimen .
the average number of galectin - 3 - positive stromal cells was higher in organ samples from igg4 - rd patients compared with healthy pancreas or lymph node samples .
the differences between healthy pancreas and igg4 - related pancreatitis samples and between healthy lymph node and igg4 lymphadenopathy were statistically significant ( p value < 0.001 for both comparisons ) ( figure 2 ( f )) .
3.4 .
galectin - 3 is expressed in macrophages , dendritic cells , and myofibroblasts immunofluorescence staining showed that galectin - 3 colocalized with cd68 , cd11c , and cd123 , suggesting that galectin - 3 was expressed in macrophage , myeloid , and plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( figures 3 ( a ) , 3 ( b ) , and 3 ( c )) .
notably , stromal myofibroblast - like spindle cells expressed both alpha - smooth muscle actin and galectin - 3 ( figure 3 ( d )) .
galectin - 3 was also visible in the stroma , while we found no galectin - 3 staining in cd3 - positive t cells or cd20 - positive b cells .
3.5 .
galectin - 3 levels in serum of patients with systemic igg4 - rd galectin - 3 levels in serum of igg4 - rd patients were 7.8 +/ - 0.58 ng / ml and 10.7 +/ - 0.58 ng / ml before and during psl treatment , respectively , that is , 2 - and 2.5 - fold higher than 3.8 +/ - 0.46 ng / ml found in healthy donors ( versus donor p value < 0.01 for both comparisons ; figure 4 ( a )) .
we monitored the serum levels of igg4 and galectin - 3 during psl tapering in five patients for an average of 24 months .
while igg4 serum levels markedly decreased after prednisolone ( psl ) therapy , galectin - 3 levels in the serum increased .
inversely , lower psl doses were accompanied by a slight decrease in galectin - 3 levels in serum ( figures 4 ( a ) and 4 ( b )) .
figure 4 ( c ) shows the relative change in galectin - 3 levels for five patients before ( galectin - 3 levels set to 1 ) and after treatment ( first samples from an average of 1 month after treatment ; range 0.3 - 2 months ; last samples from an average of 24 months after treatment ; range , 5 - 59 months ) .
galectin - 3 levels in serum were on average 1.39 +/ - 0.058 - fold higher immediately after the start of the psl therapy ( on average 1 month ) when compared to galectin - 3 levels before the treatment .
galectin - 3 levels in serum were on average 1.37 +/ - 0.15 - fold higher after the last follow - up treatment , on average 24 months after the start of the therapy , compared to relative to the levels before the treatment ( figure 4 ( c )) .
4. discussion we chose the protein galectin - 3 , identified by lc - ms with high confidence and differential expression in ffpe samples of igg4 - related pancreatitis tissues .
galectin - 3 , encoded by lgals3 , is a member of the galectin family and expressed in numerous cells , including epithelium cells of gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and renal tubules , fibroblasts , chondrocytes , osteocytes , and endothelial cells .
this protein has pro - and antiapoptotic activity [ 16 - 18 ] and regulates human monocyte and macrophage , participating in the autophagy pathway [ 19 - 21 ] .
galectin - 3 is also expressed in cells involved in immune responses , such as neutrophils , eosinophils , basophils , mast cells , langerhans cells , dendritic cells , and monocytes and macrophages [ 18 ] .
notably , in resting lymphocytes and several lymphoid cell lines , galectin - 3 is not normally expressed , but it can be induced by various stimuli [ 18 , 22 , 23 ] .
high galectin - 3 expression is observed in many forms of cancer , including thyroid , pancreatic , and colon cancers , and has been linked to cancer progression and metastasis [ 24 , 25 ] .
galectin - 3 is highly expressed in tissues affected by several autoimmune diseases , such as systemic lupus erythematosus , polymyositis , dermatomyositis , rheumatoid arthritis , behcet 's disease , systemic sclerosis , and crohn 's disease .
moreover , galectin - 3 shows higher expression in active than in inactive diseases [ 26 - 28 ] .
galectin - 3 participates in the development of the t helper - 2 ( th2 ) response [ 29 ] .
however , the expression and the role of galectin - 3 in igg4 - rd remains unknown .
this study demonstrated an increase in galectin - 3 expression in igg4 - rd patients .
galectin - 3 was expressed in cells involved in immune response activity , including macrophages , dendritic cells , myofibroblasts , and epithelial cells .
galectin - 3 signal was found in stromal deposition .
dendritic cells are specialized in antigen presentation cells and connect the innate and adaptive immune system [ 30 ] .
they have the distinctive ability to stimulate and polarize naive t cells .
for example , the expressions of il - 12 and il - 10 stimulate t helper - 1 ( th1 ) and th2 activation , respectively [ 30 ] .
th2 response controls the production of igg4 [ 18 ] .
plasmacytoid dendritic cells participate in autoimmune diseases , such as igg4 - related pancreatitis , lupus erythematosus , psoriasis , and contact dermatitis , likely contributing to ifn - alpha production [ 31 , 32 ] .
galectin - 3 secreted by dendritic cells mediates the binding of these cells to lymphocytes and might play a role in cell - cell interactions [ 33 , 34 ] .
galectin - 3 binds integrins , the main membrane molecules involved in cell adhesion , including those present on the surface of macrophages such as alpha1beta1 integrins and the alpha subunit of alphambeta1 integrin ( cd11b / 18 , mac - 1 ag ) , and these integrins are used as receptors [ 18 , 21 ] .
galectin - 3 is also essential for effective phagocytosis by macrophages to remove apoptotic cells and therefore preventing autoimmune reactions [ 35 ] .
in addition , endogenous galectin - 3 has been found to drive a th2 response in both dendritic cells and t cells , while galectin - 3 deficiency resulted in the development of a th1 response [ 29 ] .
recent studies show clonally expanded cd4 + cytotoxic t cells that express granzyme b , perforin , ifn - gamma , and tgf - beta1 are prominent in igg4rd [ 10 , 11 ] rituximab - mediated b cell depletion is associated with a reduction in numbers of disease - associated cd4 + cytotoxic t cells , suggesting that b cells play an important role in the maintenance of disease - associated t cell clone [ 10 ] .
extracellular galectin - 3 directly induces t cell apoptosis in a carbohydrate dependent manner by binding to its cell surface receptors , cd7 and cd29 [ 36 ] .
inhibition of galectin - 3 in vivo skewed the balance toward plasma cell differentiation and increased immunoglobulin production through the up - regulation of blimp - 1 , a transcription factor responsible for b cell apoptosis and essential for plasma cell commitment , in trypanosoma cruzi infection model [ 23 ] .
additionally , galectin - 3 acts as a negative regulator of the differentiation of b - 1 lymphocytes into plasma cells [ 37 ] .
likewise , il - 4 - mediated b cells activation , resulting in their differentiation into memory cells , is accompanied by a significant increase in galectin - 3 expression [ 23 ] .
therefore , galectin - 3 may act as a protective factor against the progression of igg4 - rd since galectin - 3 blocks plasma cell differentiation in b cells and apoptosis of t cells [ 23 , 36 , 37 ] , although this protein has other biological roles [ 18 ] .
in our study , galectin - 3 serum levels in patients with igg4 - rd before and during psl treatment were significantly higher compared with those in healthy donors .
igg4 levels in serum decreased dramatically after psl treatment , while galectin - 3 levels in serum remained high throughout the treatment .
galectin - 3 serum levels increased with psl treatment and gradually decreased with the tapering of psl .
this implies that galectin - 3 cannot serve as a realistic biomarker for igg4 - rd in routine clinical practice .
glucocorticoid therapy could be a bias , because galectin - 3 expression increases significantly in macrophages and lung clara cells after glucocorticoid treatment [ 38 ] .
similarly , mineralocorticoid hormones increase galectin - 3 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells [ 39 ] .
therefore , the induction of galectin - 3 expression after treatment with psl , a synthetic glucocorticoid , may be in agreement with these previous reports .
galectin - 3 expression is higher in sle and systemic sclerosis patients with active diseases than those with an inactive one .
however , galectin - 3 expression is not directly correlated with the disease activity and severity indexes in each sle and systemic sclerosis patient , nor with the duration of the disease [ 28 ] .
in our study , galectin - 3 was present in the stroma and myofibroblasts in igg4 - rd patients .
immune cells subside immediately after steroid therapy , while tissue fibrosis may remain even after treatment [ 40 ] .
it is difficult to assist tissue fibrosis because follow - up biopsy is uncommon after the treatment of igg4 - rd. the only available data come from a recent work by della - torre et al .
[ 41 ] , who found a reduction in the total number of myofibroblasts after rituximab treatment in one patient with cutaneous igg4 - rd. the presence of extracellular galectin - 3 can be a determining factor for prolonged galectin - 3 levels in serum after psl treatment .
it is possible that galectin - 3 seen in patients with igg4 - rd represents the response against inflammation .
to understand the significance of galectin - 3 in relation to the pathogenesis of igg4 - rd , the decreased expression of galectin - 3 in the affected tissues after successful corticosteroid therapy would be important ; however no tissues after therapy were available .
in conclusion , galectin - 3 was overexpressed in igg4 - rd and the levels were indirectly related to clinical activity and treatment .
further studies will need to explore the exact mechanism behind the function of galectin - 3 in igg4 - rd and other autoimmune diseases .

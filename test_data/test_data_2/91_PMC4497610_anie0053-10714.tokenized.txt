2014 this is an open access article under the terms of the creative commons attribution license , which permits use , distribution and reproduction in any medium , provided the original work is properly cited the widespread application of omega - transaminases as biocatalysts for chiral amine synthesis has been hampered by fundamental challenges , including unfavorable equilibrium positions and product inhibition .
herein , an efficient process that allows reactions to proceed in high conversion in the absence of by - product removal using only one equivalent of a diamine donor ( ortho - xylylenediamine ) is reported .
this operationally simple method is compatible with the most widely used ( r ) - and ( s ) - selective omega - tas and is particularly suitable for the conversion of substrates with unfavorable equilibrium positions ( e.g. , 1 - indanone ) .
significantly , spontaneous polymerization of the isoindole by - product generates colored derivatives , providing a high - throughput screening platform to identify desired omega - ta activity .
asymmetric catalysis biocatalysis chiral amines high - throughput screening transaminases the development of broadly applicable catalytic methods for the sustainable production of chiral amines has been identified as a key research priority by the pharmaceutical industry. [ 1 ] the importance of this challenge is highlighted by the numerous active pharmaceutical ingredients ( apis ) , bioactive natural products , and pharmaceutical building blocks that contain chiral amines. [ 2 ] in recent years , the development and application of enzymes as biocatalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines has received considerable attention. [ 3 ] examples of enzyme classes that have been utilized for their synthesis include omega - transaminases ( omega - tas ),[ 4 ] ammonia lyases ,[ 5 ] imine reductases ,[ 6 ] amine dehydrogenases ,[ 7 ] and monoamine oxidases. [ 8 ] increasingly sophisticated techniques for enzyme evolution [ 9 ] have led to the development of engineered biocatalysts , which have been optimized for application in industrial processes. [ 10 ] the structural simplicity and broad availability of prochiral ketones make these structures attractive starting materials for the synthesis of chiral building blocks .
for example , the application of ketoreductases is currently one of the most common strategies employed for chiral alcohol synthesis. [ 11 ] the analogous asymmetric reductive amination of ketones represents a significant challenge in organic synthesis and has been highlighted as an extremely desirable transformation for use in the pharmaceutical industry. [ 1 ] omega - tas are a family of pyridoxal - 5 ' - phosphate ( plp ) - dependent enzymes that require a sacrificial amine donor to mediate the reversible conversion of prochiral ketones into the corresponding optically pure amines. [ 4 ] the broad substrate scope and high levels of regio - and stereoselectivity associated with these enzymes make them ideal biocatalysts for chiral amine synthesis in research laboratories and in manufacturing processes .
this point is highlighted by the recent application of an engineered ( r ) - selective omega - ta in a biocatalytic process for the large - scale production of the anti - diabetic api sitagliptin. [ 10a ] despite the enormous potential of omega - tas , fundamental challenges associated with severe by - product inhibition and with displacing unfavorable equilibrium positions towards product formation have prevented the widespread application of these biocatalysts. [ 12a ] the use of amine donors in large excess combined with the in situ removal of ketone by - products is generally required to achieve high yields of the desired amines ( figure 1 ) .
the most widely employed strategy uses alanine as the amine donor and relies on combinations of expensive , cofactor - dependent enzymes for pyruvate removal ( figure 1 a ).[ 12 ] an elegant alternative strategy was recently described in which the ketone by - product is effectively removed by spontaneous conversion into the more stable phenol tautomer. [ 13 ] unfortunately , the application of these approaches for scalable amine synthesis is limited by the high costs associated with their use .
the preferred method for large - scale production currently involves the use of a significant excess of isopropyl amine donor in combination with the technically challenging removal of the acetone by - product by evaporation ( figure 1 bii ).[ 10a , 14 ] a further challenge that complicates the development of efficient omega - ta - mediated processes is the limited availability of simple high - throughput screening methods to identify new enzymes and to evaluate large libraries of engineered variants for enhanced activity , selectivity , and stability under the required reaction conditions. [ 15 ] herein , we describe the application of a non - chiral , low - cost amine donor that serves the dual function of efficiently displacing unfavorable reaction equilibria towards product formation whilst providing a substrate - independent high - throughput colorimetric screening method to detect desired omega - ta activity .
figure 1 selected examples of widely utilized conditions for small / medium - scale ( a ) and large - scale ( b ) processes that employ omega - tas .
commercially available ortho - xylylenediamine dihydrochloride ( 1 ) was initially evaluated as an amine donor for the biocatalytic amination of ( 4 - fluorophenyl ) acetone ( 2 ) .
using a commercial omega - ta ( ata 113 from codexis ) as the biocatalyst , complete conversion of 2 ( 5 mm ) into 3 (> 99 % , > 99 % ee ) was achieved using one equivalent of the amine donor .
significantly , the reaction could also be carried out at a substrate concentration of 100 mm without compromising the conversion ( scheme 1 ) .
for comparison , the use of structurally related benzylamine ( 1.5 equiv ) or l - alanine ( 10 equiv , no pyruvate removal ) as the amine donor resulted in poor conversion (< 5 %) into the desired product ( table 1 ) .
the success of the xylylenediamine donor can be attributed to the spontaneous conversion of the cyclic imine by - product 4 into the more stable aromatic isoindole 5 , effectively removing this component from the system .
transfer of an amino group from diamine 1 to the plp cofactor to generate the required pyridoxamine - 5 ' - phosphate ( pmp ) intermediate is likely to occur through rapid 5 - exo - trig cyclization of the remaining primary amine onto an aldimine intermediate , although a stepwise hydrolysis / cyclization pathway cannot be excluded .
significantly , the isoindole by - product 5 undergoes spontaneous polymerization resulting in the formation of intensely colored derivatives ,[ 16 ] providing a sensitive and operationally simple method of identifying desired transaminase activity .

to demonstrate the broad utility of this method , biotransformations were carried out with benzaldehyde ( 6 ) and a series of prochiral ketones 7 - 12 using ata 113 and diamine 1 ( table 1 ) .
substrates 6 - 12 were efficiently converted into the corresponding amines with excellent conversion using < 1.5 equivalents of diamine 1. with the exception of 10 , the reactions proceeded with high selectivity (> 99 % ee ) .
benzylacetone ( 10 ) was converted into ( s ) - (+) - 1 - methyl - 3 - phenylpropylamine with 78 % ee using either diamine 1 or l - alanine ( 10 equiv ) in combination with the lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh )/ glucose dehydrogenase ( gdh ) pyruvate removal system , demonstrating that 1 does not influence the reaction enantioselectivity .
regio - and stereoselective amination of diketone 11 was followed by spontaneous cyclization into the corresponding pyrroline as described previously. [ 17 ] the efficient biocatalytic amination of 1 - indanone ( 12 ) represents a significant challenge with existing amine donors because of highly unfavorable equilibrium positions. [ 12a ] impressive conversions of 54 % and 73 % into ( s ) - 1 - aminoindane were achieved using 1.0 and 1.5 equivalents of diamine 1 , respectively .
the corresponding biotransformations using l - alanine ( 10 equiv ) in combination with the ldh / gdh pyruvate removal system resulted in a modest 21 % conversion .
in the absence of pyruvate removal , no conversion was detected using up to 100 equivalents of l - alanine .
combined , these results clearly demonstrate the efficiency and operational simplicity of the biotransformations that use 1 as the amine donor .
a further significant advantage of this system lies in the formation of intensely colored by - products , which presumably arise from spontaneous polymerization of isoindole 5 and offer a simple high - throughput screening strategy to identify desired transaminase activity .
we sought to employ this assay to rapidly evaluate a panel of commercially available omega - tas for their ability to utilize 1 as an amine donor .
this panel included a series of six ( s ) - selective ( figure 2 a ; l2 , l4 , and l6 a - f ) and six ( r ) - selective ( l1 , l3 , and l5 a - f ) omega - tas from the codex ata screening kit v2 , which have been specifically engineered to operate using high concentrations of isopropyl amine donor and are currently the most widely utilized omega - ta biocatalysts for chiral amine synthesis .
in the absence of an amine acceptor , low levels of color change were observed with a number of these biocatalysts following incubation with diamine 1 ( 5 mm ) for three hours ( l1 and l2 ) , which is presumably due to the conversion of enzyme - bound plp into pmp , although the presence of small quantities of ketone impurities in the commercial enzyme preparation cannot be excluded .
the addition of benzylacetone ( 10 ; 5 mm , 1.0 equiv ) as an amine acceptor resulted in significant color changes in a number of the biotransformations after only 15 minutes ( l3 and l4 ) .
following overnight incubation , reactions with all codexis biocatalysts resulted in the formation of intensely colored solutions and significant quantities of dark precipitate ( l5 and l6 ) , demonstrating the broad utility of this amine donor for the synthesis of both the ( s ) and ( r ) enantiomers of chiral amines .
in all cases , significant conversion of 10 into the corresponding amine was confirmed by gc - fid analysis ( see the supporting information , tables s1 and s2 ) , demonstrating the reliability of this simple screening strategy , which provides an ideal high - throughput platform for evaluating panels of omega - ta biocatalysts for their activity towards large libraries of ketone or aldehyde substrates .
in general , higher conversions were achieved with the ( s ) - selective biocatalysts than with their ( r ) - selective counterparts .
comparable levels of conversion of 10 were achieved using the corresponding immobilized omega - ta biocatalysts that were recently commercialized by purolite / codexis .

cells expressing the pf - ata gene turn dark in color after 30 min ( right ) .
cells lacking the pf - ata gene remain colorless ( left ) .
further evidence for the reliability of this colorimetric screening method was obtained by using commercial omega - tas supplied by almac ( l7 a - f ) .
whereas the biotransformations with tam 106 / tam 107 ( l 7a and l 7b , respectively ) proceeded with moderate conversion and gave intensely colored reaction mixtures , the reactions with tam 121 ( l 7d ) and tam 140 ( l 7f ) gave no conversion (< 1 %) , and the wells remained pale yellow .
significantly , low but detectable levels of color change were observed in the reactions with tam 115 ( l 7c ) and ta m125 ( l 7e ) , which were shown to proceed with < 5 % and 5 % conversion , respectively ( see table s3 ) .
aside from providing a high - throughput method to evaluate the activity of commercial omega - tas , the colorimetric screening strategy described above offers an ideal platform for the development of a new generation of omega - ta biocatalysts that are engineered to efficiently utilize 1 as an amine donor .
unfortunately , the protein sequence of commercial biocatalysts is rarely disclosed , necessitating the identification and application of suitable wild - type enzymes as starting points for directed evolution .
we have recently reported the use of a transaminase from pseudogulbenkiania ferrooxidans ( pf - ata ) for the regio - and stereoselective amination of diketones using l - alanine as the amine donor. [ 17 ] we now demonstrate that this wild - type biocatalyst displays modest activity towards diamine 1 ( see the supporting information ) .
significantly , this has allowed the development of a single - enzyme , colony - based assay to identify desired omega - ta activity .
such assays are particularly useful as they allow the rapid evaluation of large libraries of enzyme variants in a high - throughput manner .
in the presence of diamine 1 , e. coli colonies expressing the pf - ata gene rapidly became dark ( figure 2 b ) .
control experiments using benzylamine or diamine 1 in combination with cells lacking the pf - ata gene did not lead to a color change in the colonies .
the success of this assay lies in the formation of insoluble polymeric isoindole by - products , which prevent undesired diffusion .
solid - phase assays based on horseradish peroxidase ( hrp )/ h2o2 mediated polymerization of suitable substrates have previously been successfully exploited to engineer oxidase enzymes with enhanced biocatalytic properties. [ 18 ] the analogous assay for omega - ta activity described herein is suitable for screening genomic libraries and culture collections to identify undiscovered omega - tas and is expected to greatly facilitate the process of engineering enzymes with high activity towards amine donor 1 and with enhanced properties for biocatalytic applications .
in summary , we have developed a simple and highly efficient process for chiral amine synthesis employing omega - ta biocatalysts .
the use of ortho - xylylenediamine 1 serves the dual function of displacing challenging reaction equilibria towards product formation while generating intensely colored by - products , which has allowed the development of liquid - phase and colony - based assays .
this method offers an ideal strategy for screening large substrate panels or libraries of omega - ta variants to facilitate the development of the next generation of omega - ta biocatalysts by directed evolution .

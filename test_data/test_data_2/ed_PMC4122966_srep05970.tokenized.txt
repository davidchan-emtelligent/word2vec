decreased cellular atp levels may contribute to the pathology of this eye disease and other neurodegenerative diseases .
here we describe small compounds ( kyoto university substances , kuss ) that were developed to inhibit the atpase activity of vcp ( valosin - containing protein ) , the most abundant soluble atpase in the cell .
surprisingly , kuss did not significantly impair reported cellular functions of vcp but nonetheless suppressed the vcp - dependent decrease of cellular atp levels .
moreover , kuss , as well as exogenous atp or atp - producing compounds , e.g. methylpyruvate , suppressed endoplasmic reticulum stress , and demonstrably protected various types of cultured cells from death , including several types of retinal neuronal cells .
we then examined their in vivo efficacies in rd10 , a mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa .
kuss prevented photoreceptor cell death and preserved visual function .
these results reveal an unexpected , crucial role of atp consumption by vcp in determining cell fate in this pathological context , and point to a promising new neuroprotective strategy for currently incurable retinitis pigmentosa .
despite recent advances in the development of new drugs , there remain many incurable disorders , e.g. neurodegenerative diseases , ischemic diseases , and chronic inflammation , in which the major pathology in the affected organs is early cell death , which occurs long before the death of the individual .
indeed , currently no drug is available to prevent such early cell death in vivo .
if such drugs were available , many of these disorders , if not all , might be prevented or delayed .
in the 1990s , due to a growing , but still imperfect , understanding of the molecular bases of apoptotic cell death , caspase inhibitors were developed and were heralded as miracle drugs , but they were ineffective in preventing cell death in vivo .
this might be explained as follows : caspases determine how cells die but are unable to affect the commitment to cell death .
thus , drugs that could delay or prevent the commitment to cell death have been actively pursued .
retinitis pigmentosa , which is caused by a gradual degeneration and loss of photoreceptors , is another intractable eye disease , and more than 1.5 million patients suffer from progressive visual deterioration with this disorder .
clinical trials using a neurotrophic factor have been initiated1 .
in retinitis pigmentosa , involvement of endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) stress has been proposed23 .
thus , new drugs or compounds with er stress - reducing activities may prove to be neuroprotective , and are thus worth investigating for the treatment or prevention of retinitis pigmentosa .
we have long been working to elucidate the molecular bases of polyglutamine diseases , as informative models for neurodegeneration .
we and other research groups produced several lines of evidence that implicate valosin - containing protein ( vcp ) , an aaa ( atpases associated with diverse cellular activities ) - type atpase with ubiquitous expression , as a major player causing neurodegeneration .
it is notable that vcp is highly conserved among species ; its amino acid sequences are completely identical among mouse , rat , and human , and 84 % identical between human and drosophila4 .
we first assumed that specific cellular genes are involved in the pathogenesis of polyglutamine diseases , and thus had established drosophila models of polyglutamine diseases for genetic analyses .
mutant screening revealed that ter94 loss - of - function alleles mitigated polyglutamine - induced eye degeneration4 .
conversely , overexpression of wild - type ter94 enhanced the polyglutamine - induced eye degeneration4 .
since the mammalian ter94 ortholog is vcp , these results raised the possibility that vcp is involved in the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative diseases5 .
consistent with this possibility , vcp mutations were identified that are causative for ibmpfd ( inclusion body myopathy associated with paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia ) 6 , a human hereditary disease with dementia , or for rare cases of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) 7 .
in our evaluation , all tested pathogenic vcps possessed elevated atpase activities , as compared with wild - type vcp8 , indicating that the constitutive elevation of its atpase activity may be pathogenic .
these lines of evidence suggested that inhibitors of the atpase activity of vcp could protect neuronal cells .
in addition to its atpase activity , however , many cellular functions of vcp have been proposed91011 , e.g. , proteasome - mediated protein degradation , endoplasmic reticulum - associated degradation ( erad ) , cell cycle control , membrane fusion , maintenance of the golgi apparatus , protein trafficking , autophagy , genomic dna surveillance , etc. , some of which are crucial for cell survival .
indeed , vcp knockdown and overexpression of dominant - negative forms of vcp showed toxicity in cultured cells1213 .
dbeq , a recently reported vcp inhibitor ( in vitro ic50 ( half maximal inhibitory concentration ) 1 mum ) 14 , also showed cellular toxicity .
given that vcp has multiple cellular functions , some of them would require atp hydrolysis and others would not .
thus , it is a challenge to find small compounds that can inhibit or reduce the atpase activity of vcp without incurring the general toxicity caused by loss of crucial cellular functions of vcp .
results kuss inhibited vcp atpase activity but not vcp cellular functions in our search for novel vcp atpase inhibitors , we found that a naphthalene derivative can inhibit the atpase activity of vcp with no apparent toxicity at 10 mum on cultured cells .
based on the chemical structure , about two hundred compounds were newly synthesized and named kuss ( kyoto university substances ) .
some of them , e.g. kus31 , 69 , 94 , 121 , and 187 , clearly inhibited the atpase activity of recombinant vcp in vitro with ic50 values ranging from approximately 100 nm to 1 mum ( fig. 1a ) .
these ic50 values were equivalent to or much lower than that of dbeq14 , whose reported ic50 is 1 mum ( supplementary fig. 1 ) .
it is notable that kuss very mildly inhibited the atpase activity of n - ethylmaleimide - sensitive fusion protein ( nsf ) ( fig. 1b ) , whose structure is most closely related with that of vcp .
we then examined the effect of kus31 , 69 , 94 , 121 , and 187 on vcp functions in cultured cells .
we also used dbeq as a reference compound .
as reported , dbeq induced accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins , er stress , autophagy , and eventually cell death ( fig. 1c and d ) .
surprisingly , these compounds did not induce any of these phenotypes ( fig. 1c and d ) .
these results clearly indicated that atpase inhibition by kus31 , 69 , 94 , 121 , and 187 ( referred to as " kuss " hereafter , for simplicity ) did not interfere with reported cellular vcp functions ( referred to as " vcp functions " hereafter ) , indicating that vcp functions do not necessarily require its atpase activity ( see discussion ) .
kuss protected cells under er stress - inducing conditions additionally , kuss protected cells from several cell death - inducing insults .
for example , when hela cells were cultured under low glucose conditions ( 0.2 g / l of glucose ) , all cells died within several days ( fig. 2a ) .
however , when kuss were present in the media , they prevented cell death ( fig. 2a and b ) .
protective effects were also observed when hela cells were treated with tunicamycin ( tm ) ( fig. 2c ) , or when hek293 cells were subjected to serum - free conditions ( fig. 2d ) .
these protective effects of kuss were dose - dependent , as exemplified by kus121 ( fig. 2e ) .
these data clearly implied that inhibition of vcp atpase activity by kuss could protect cells from several cell death - inducing insults .
tunicamycin treatment and glucose starvation are known to cause er stress and to lead to cell death .
c / ebp - homologous protein ( chop ) is a core mediator of er stress - induced cell death , and is upregulated during er stress15 .
indeed , kuss suppressed the expression of chop in tunicamycin - treated hela cells ( fig. 2f ) .
kuss also suppressed the expression of 78 kda glucose - regulated protein ( grp78 ) , another er stress marker16 , in the tunicamycin - treated cells .
next , we examined akt ( serine / threonine - protein kinase ) activation by examining its phosphorylation at ser473 , which has been reported to be necessary and sufficient for cell survival17 .
the phosphorylated akt signal nearly disappeared in cells treated with tunicamycin , but was clearly detected in cells treated with tunicamycin and kuss ( fig. 2f ) .
these data indicate that kuss could suppress er stress and promote cell survival , which was evidenced by akt being in an activated state .
because vcp is a major atpase in cells , we then examined the contribution of vcp to total atpase activities in clarified whole cell lysates , and found that vcp appeared to contribute to approximately 20 % - 40 % of the total collective atpase activity , depending on the cell types and culture conditions ( an example is provided in fig. 3a ) .
in neuronally differentiated pc12 cells , for example , 100 nm and 1 mum kus121 , as well as kus187 , significantly lowered the total atpase activity ( approximately 20 % and 40 % for both concentrations , respectively ) ( fig. 3a ) .
given that the ic50 values of kus121 and kus187 on recombinant vcp were around 200 ~ 300 nm ( fig. 1a ) , these data implied that the atpase activity of vcp contributed to as much as 40 % of the total soluble atpase activities in the cell lysate .
this estimation was further supported by the observation that 1 mum kus94 ( ic50 is 1 mum ) also showed approximately 20 % suppression of the soluble atpase activities ( fig. 3a ) .
consistent with the inability of kus11 to inhibit the atpase of vcp in vitro ( ic50 is more than 100 mum ) , kus11 did not show any significant inhibition of total atpase activity in the clarified lysates ( fig. 3a ) .
we next examined whether kuss altered cellular atp levels .
at 20 hours after a change to low glucose medium ( 0.25 g / l ) , glucose concentrations in the medium approached zero , and atp levels in the cells ( control cells ) significantly decreased ( fig. 3b ) .
in contrast , atp levels in the cells with low glucose medium plus kuss remained significantly higher than those in the control cells ( fig. 3b and supplementary fig. 2a ) .
in addition , in kus - treated cells , the ratio of atp to adp was higher than in the control cells ( supplementary fig. 2b ) .
these data indicate that kuss suppress consumption of atp in cells under stress conditions .
interestingly , acetyl - coa levels in the kus - treated cells were significantly lower than those in the control cells ( fig. 3c and supplementary fig. 2c ) , suggesting the possibility that kuss may induce a metabolic shift from a glycolytic pathway to mitochondrial pathways to produce atp .
this possibility remains to be clarified .
the low levels of acetyl - coa might also contribute to protect cells from cell death , as reported recently18 .
kuss and exogenous atp both prevented er stress in cultured cells it has long been believed that er stress is induced by the accumulation of misfolded proteins , or protein aggregates , in the er192021 .
we recently identified laminin gamma1 as an aggregation - prone protein in the er. we therefore examined laminin gamma1 as an indicator of er - stress in tunicamycin - treated cells. by immunocytochemical analyses , expression of laminin gamma1 was observed in a diffuse pattern throughout the er in normal cells ( control in fig. 4a ) .
when cells were treated with tunicamycin , laminin gamma1 formed clear aggregates ( dmso in fig. 4a ) .
however , not only 50 mum kuss ( kus69 , 94 , 121 , and 187 ) but also 1 mm atp treatments clearly prevented the aggregation of laminin gamma1 ( fig. 4a ) .
consistent with these results , kuss and atp treatments similarly prevented decreases of atp levels in tunicamycin - treated cells ( fig. 4b ). by contrast , kus11 , which could not inhibit vcp atpase , was unable to prevent the tunicamycin - elicited atp decrease ( fig. 4b ) .
it is notable that the addition of 0.1 mm atp or 3 to 10 mm methylpyruvate ( weakly membrane - permeable pyruvate , which is converted to atp in mitochondria ) were also ineffective in preventing the aggregation of laminin gamma1 ( fig. 4a ) , but could nevertheless dampen the induction of er stress , namely chop induction ( fig. 4c ) .
these results indicated that the er is more sensitive to decreases in atp levels than to the presence of aggregates ( see discussion ) .
kuss mitigated pathologies of rd10 , a mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa as we have long been seeking a new strategy to protect retinal neuronal cells , we were intrigued by the observation that vcp was highly expressed in all types of retinal neuronal cells ( supplementary fig. 3 ) .
furthermore , in retinitis pigmentosa , an involvement of er stress has been proposed23 .
after confirming the neuroprotective efficacy of kus in retinal organ culture ( supplementary fig. 4 ) , we then examined whether the protective effects would be observed in vivo against the degeneration of photoreceptor cells .
for this purpose , rd10 mice were used as a representative mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa22 .
rd10 mice have a mutation in a gene encoding the rod cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cgmp ) phosphodiesterase beta subunit ( pde6b ) 22 , which is also mutated in patients with retinitis pigmentosa .
the mice have been commonly used to test the efficacies of new treatments , including gene therapy , neuroprotectants , and stem cell derived retinal cells .
starting 7 days after birth , kus121 or kus187 was administered daily ( 50 mg / kg ) by intraperitoneal injection .
spectral - domain optical coherence tomography ( sd - oct ) examination showed that at age 21 days , the retinas of the control rd10 mice had begun to degenerate ( supplementary fig. 5a ) .
to test the visual function of the mice , dark - adapted electroretinograms were recorded .
the amplitude of the a - wave , which represents visual function of photoreceptors , was smaller in the control mice than in the kus - treated mice ( supplementary fig. 5b and c ) .
the peak latency of the a - wave , which negatively correlates with visual function of photoreceptors , was delayed in the control mice as compared with the kus - treated mice ( supplementary fig. 5d ) .
at age 25 days , the thinning of the outer nuclear layer ( onl ) was clearly observed in the control mice ( fig. 5a ) .
the outer nuclear layer and the junction line between the inner segment and outer segment ( arrow heads in fig. 5a ) , which is generally considered to be positively associated with visual function2324 , were clearly detected in the kus - treated but not in control mice .
a very small electroretinogram response was observed in control mice , but an almost normal electroretinogram response was observed in most of the kus - treated mice ( fig. 5b ) .
at age 29 days , the photoreceptor layer was barely detected in sd - oct images , and electroretinogram records were almost flat in control mice .
in the age - matched kus - treated mice , the outer nuclear layer , although thin , and an electroretinogram response were still observed ( fig. 5c and d ). by histological examination , at age 33 days , the outer nuclear layer in the control mice consisted of only 1 - 2 rows of cells , but there remained 5 - 6 rows of cells in the outer nuclear layer in the kus - treated mice ( fig. 5e ) .
in kus - treated but not control mice , the outer segment of the photoreceptors was observed ( fig. 5e ) .
the electroretinogram was non - recordable in the control mice , but small b - wave and oscillatory potentials were observed in the kus - treated mice ( fig. 5f ) .
time - dependent changes in total retinal thickness measured on sd - oct images ( fig. 5g ) and in b - wave amplitudes of dark - adapted electroretinogram ( fig. 5h ) showed that kus treatments had the potential to prevent or delay the disease progression .
b - wave amplitudes of dark - adapted electroretinograms in non - treated wild - type mice mostly remained unchanged or slightly increased at the age of 33 days ( supplementary fig. 6a ) .
note that kus administration in adult wild - type mice did not induce any significant change in the amplitude of a - and b - waves ( supplementary fig. 6b and c ) .
when examined by electron microscopy , the outer segment of the control mouse retina was mostly disarranged at the age of 21 days ( fig. 6a and c ) , whereas that of kus - treated mouse retina was regularly arranged ( fig. 6b and d ) .
in rd10 mice , kus treatments apparently suppressed chop expression , as observed in cultured cells ( fig. 5i ) .
discussion we successfully developed novel atpase inhibitors for vcp , with a naphthalene - derived structure in common , and we collectively called them kuss ( kyoto university substances ) .
kuss showed ic50 values from 100 nm to 1 mum for the inhibition of atpase activities of recombinant vcp in vitro .
totally different from known atpase inhibitors for vcp , e.g. dbeq14 , nms - 87325 , etc. , kuss , e.g. kus31 , kus69 , kus94 , kus121 , kus187 , etc. , did not manifest any apparent cellular toxicity , up to 50 mum , on essentially all tested cultured cells ; nor did they elicit any aberrant phenotypes that would be expected from the inhibition of cellular vcp functions .
these results demonstrated that kuss could inhibit vcp atpase activity without inhibiting cellular vcp functions .
aaa atpases might have additional functions that are independent of their atpase activity .
recently , noi et al. analyzed the natural movement of recombinant vcp by high - speed atomic force microscopy and demonstrated that atp - binding mutants of vcp did not display any apparent rotational movement in solution , but wild - type vcp and atp - hydrolysis mutants of vcp were indistinguishably capable of rotational movements26 .
these data are consistent with the idea that , for at least some vcp functions , atp binding is essential but atp hydrolysis is not .
this idea is reminiscent of g proteins and actin , whose functions require guanosine triphosphate ( gtp ) and atp binding , respectively , but not gtp and atp hydrolysis , respectively .
kuss likely inhibit the atpase activity of vcp , but not necessarily vcp functions related to binding of atp .
we thus categorized kuss as " vcp modulators " rather than " vcp inhibitors " .
surprisingly , kuss were able to reduce by approximately 40 % the total atp consumption in whole cell soluble lysates of neuronally differentiated pc12 cells , raising the possibility that vcp accounts for approximately 40 % of the atp consumption among soluble atpases in the non - dividing pc12 cells .
this result led us to speculate that kuss would significantly reduce atp consumption in living cells as well .
indeed , in cultured cells , kuss were shown to maintain atp levels in starved conditions as well as in conditions with enhanced atp consumption , such as in tunicamycin - induced er stress27 .
consistently , and surprisingly , kuss and atp similarly suppressed tunicamycin - induced er stress and eventually cell death .
more surprisingly , kuss ( at 50 mum ) and atp ( at 0.3 to 1 mm ) similarly prevented the aggregation of laminin gamma1 in tunicamycin - treated hela cells .
it is noteworthy that a low level of atp ( at 0.1 mm ) and methylpyruvate ( at 3 to 10 mm ) were not able to prevent the aggregation of laminin gamma1 , but were nevertheless able to reduce the induction of chop , a well - known er stress marker , in tunicamycin - treated cells .
this observation clearly supports the idea that er stress is more directly elicited by a decrease of atp than the presence of aggregated proteins in the er. historically , most er chaperones were originally identified as proteins induced by glucose starvation and thus were named as grp ( glucose - regulated proteins ) 28 .
moreover , it has recently been shown that the binding of er stress sensors , such as prkr - like endoplasmic reticulum kinase ( perk ) and inositol - requiring enzyme - 1 ( ire1 ) , to grp - 78 ( bip ) is atp - dependent29 .
thus , it is likely that a decrease in the atp level in the er induces the dissociation of bip from the er - stress sensors , leading to their self - oligomerization and subsequent activation .
the evidence that kuss could prevent the decrease in atp level in response to several cell death - inducing insults , and eventually cell death , led us to examine the possibility that kuss would function as cell - protecting compounds in pathological conditions , and that the prevention of early cell death could in turn prevent or delay the deterioration of the affected organs .
for this purpose , we chose rd10 , a mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa .
currently , it is very difficult to quantitatively measure local atp levels , and thus we examined whether kuss could prevent neuronal cell death in the affected retinas .
in rd10 mice , in which the rod cgmp phosphodiesterase beta subunit ( pde6b ) 22 is mutated , kuss significantly retarded the progress of photoreceptor cell death , and protected the photoreceptor cells morphologically as well as functionally .
reduction of er stress would be a likely mechanism for kus - mediated protection of photoreceptors , although our current data are not sufficient to exclude other yet - unknown possibilities .
in retinitis pigmentosa , neuroprotective treatment is regarded as an important future therapeutic strategy , and several clinical trials to prolong the viability of the retinal neuronal cells have been ongoing1 .
we are also planning to initiate clinical studies using kuss in the near future .
considering all of the data together , we posit that a reduction of atp levels is a common condition in the affected organs of incurable disorders with early cell death .
because many proteins require atp , a reduction of atp levels would contribute to a functional decline in affected cells or organs in early stages of the disease , which might precede cell death .
reducing atp consumption by way of kuss and / or enhancing atp generation by yet - unknown compounds would be a novel strategy to retard these processes and thus to prevent or retard the progression of clinical manifestations .
recently , the involvement of translational suppression via phosphorylation of eif2alpha has been proposed in the pathogenesis of alzheimer30 and prion diseases31 .
indeed , novel perk inhibitors showed significant efficacies in a mouse prion disease model32 .
given that perk is the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of eif2alpha in er stress , the effect of kuss in these disease models would be worth evaluating .
in conclusion , we showed that kuss , new compounds developed as atpase inhibitors of vcp , have novel functions as " vcp modulators " or " atp regulators " without apparent inhibition of cellular vcp functions .
these new " atp regulators " have strong neuroprotective effects in vivo on retinal photoreceptor cells .
the efficacies were apparently correlated with their abilities to suppress er stress .
to the best of our knowledge , kuss are the first small chemicals that can prevent cell death in an animal model of human retinitis pigmentosa .
given that the major pathology of many other incurable human disorders , e.g. neurodegenerative diseases , ischemic diseases , etc. , is also early cell death , kuss may provide a novel strategy for cell protection in such incurable disorders .

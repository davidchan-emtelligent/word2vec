introduction the occurrence of cytomegalovirus colitis is well known in immunosuppressed patients , such as neoplastic patients following chemotherapy , although its exact etiology remains unclear .
case presentation we present a case of cytomegalovirus colitis occurring in a 77 - year - old man with vomiting and diarrhea 2 weeks after initial systemic chemotherapy consisting of 5 - fluorouracil , leucovorin and irinotecan for a recurrent colorectal cancer .
initial colonoscopy revealed multiple punched - out ulcers in the transverse colon and the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus was based on positive cytomegalovirus antigen detected by indirect enzyme antibody method , although immunohistological examination of tissues biopsied at colonoscopy was negative .
the symptoms ceased under ganciclovir and octreotide treatment , and the patient recovered gradually .
conclusion the most probable cause of the cytomegalovirus colitis in this case was impaired immunity following chemotherapy .
cytomegalovirus infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease in colorectal cancer patients after chemotherapy and , when suspected , the clinician should pursue appropriate diagnostic interventions including colonoscopy .
introduction recently , a number of new treatment options have become available for colorectal cancer ( crc ) patients .
in particular , cpt - 11 ( irinotecan ) , a specific inhibitor of topoisomerase i , has been proven to have efficacy in the treatment of crc .
most recent studies have demonstrated a significant improvement in the addition of irinotecan to 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - fu ) - leucovorin ( lv ) combination therapy ( folfiri ) for patients with 5 - fu - refractory advanced crc .
in contrast , immunosuppression induced by chemotherapy is less well characterized , with opportunistic infections appearing mainly after high - dose treatment or with certain new drugs directly affecting lymphocyte homeostasis .
the occurrence of cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) colitis is well known in immunosuppressed patients , such as neoplastic patients after chemotherapy , although its exact etiology remains unclear .
we describe the case of a 77 - year - old man presenting with an unusual viral complication with cmv colitis diagnosed 2 weeks after a first course of standard chemotherapy for a recurrent crc .
case presentation a 77 - year - old man with known recurrence of colon cancer , which was not previously treated with any adjuvant chemotherapies , was admitted for vomiting and diarrhea 2 weeks after standard folfiri chemotherapy consisting of 5 - fu ( 350 mg / bolus / m2 plus 2300 mg / infuser pump / m2 ) , lv ( 200 mg / m2 ) and irinotecan ( 130 mg / m2 ) .
laboratory examination on admission showed a white blood cell count of 15,300 / mcl and c - reactive protein of 16.4 mg / dl , and he was also slightly anemic .
blood , urine and stool cultures as well as clostridium difficile toxin 33 assay for stool specimen results were negative .
abdominal computed tomography imaging revealed a massive dilatation of the entire colon ( figure 1 ) .
subsequently , a colonoscopy was performed , which revealed multiple punched - out ulcers in the transverse colon ( figure 2a and 2b ) typical for cmv colitis .
following colonoscopy , cmv antigen was detected by indirect enzyme antibody method , also known as antigenemia method , but the biopsy specimens did not reveal cmv inclusion body immunohistologically .
based on these findings , the patient was diagnosed with cmv colitis and was started on intravenous ganciclovir therapy ( 500 mg / day for 2 weeks ) combined with subcutaneous octreotide ( 200 mcg / day for 10 days ) .
the patient gradually improved , and a second colonoscopy 4 weeks after admission demonstrated partial healing of multiple ulcers in the transverse colon ( figure 3 ) .
figure 1 abdominal computed tomography shows massive large bowel dilatation of the entire colon .
figure 2 initial colonoscopy reveals multiple punched - out ulcers of the right transverse colon ( a ) and the left transverse colon ( b ) with minimal granularity in the surrounding mucosa .
figure 3 follow - up colonoscopy demonstrates partial healing of the ulcers in the transverse colon .
discussion although cmv colitis is not frequently encountered , severe cmv colitis has been reported in neoplastic patients after chemotherapy [ 1,2 ] .
the diagnosis of cmv colitis often poses a clinical challenge .
although endoscopic biopsies taken from the mucosa and ulcer bed are a relatively rapid and reliable method for demonstrating cmv colitis , their sensitivity is sometimes limited [ 3 ] .
cmv antigen in the blood may also confirm the diagnosis of cmv colitis [ 1 ] as in this case but may not always be present .
furthermore , the clinical symptoms of cmv colitis are indistinguishable from irinotecan - induced enteritis , another infrequently seen but important cause of severe colitis [ 4,5 ] .
in our case , since the cmv antigen was positive , it is unlikely that the patient 's colitis was directly related to the use of irinotecan , but the high - dose irinotecan may have been the major predisposing factor for the activation of cmv .
moreover , although it has been reported that irinotecan has the potential to induce neutropenia [ 5 ] , our case showed an elevation of the leukocyte count , presumably caused by the colitis itself and the micro - abscesses .
the primary therapy for cmv colitis is the use of antiviral drugs such as ganciclovir .
in addition , previous reports have shown that octreotide also has potential for use against cmv colitis , although its mechanism of action remains unclear [ 2,6 ] .
our case demonstrated a favorable response to these treatments .
despite successful treatment , elective surgery is warranted if intestinal stenosis develops after the punched - out ulcer has healed [ 7 ] .
although the overall frequency of cmv infection in patients with neoplasm after chemotherapy is uncertain , cmv colitis should be ruled out with colonoscopy if the patient is suspected of having atypical enteritis after chemotherapy , as demonstrated in our case .
as the clinical pathological features of cmv colitis and inflammatory bowel disease often overlap , and because of the possible co - existence of cmv colitis with idiopathic colitis , the possibility of cmv infection should always be considered , so that the most appropriate therapy can be instituted for these patients .
conclusion this case demonstrates that cmv colitis appears to be an extremely rare but potentially serious complication for patients with crc following chemotherapy .
therefore , in individuals with crc who do not respond to traditional medical therapy , other diagnoses including cmv should be considered , with early examinations of colonoscopy with biopsy and cmv antigenemia .

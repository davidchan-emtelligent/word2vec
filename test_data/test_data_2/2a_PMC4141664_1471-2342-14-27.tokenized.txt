background thermal ablation of colorectal liver metastases ( crlm ) may result in local progression , which generally appear within a year of treatment .
as the timely diagnosis of this progression allows potentially curative local treatment , an optimal follow - up imaging strategy is essential .
pet - mri is a one potential imaging modality , combining the advantages of pet and mri .
the aim of this study is evaluate fluorine - 18 deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( fdg ) pet - mri as a modality for detection of local tumor progression during the first year following thermal ablation , as compared to the current standard , fdg pet - ct. the ability of fdg pet - mri to detect new intrahepatic lesions , and the extent to which fdg pet - mri alters clinical management , inter - observer variability and patient preference will also be included as secondary outcomes .
methods / design twenty patients undergoing treatment with radiofrequency or microwave ablation for ( recurrent ) crlm will be included in this prospective trial .
during the first year of follow - up , patients will be scanned at the vu university medical center at 3 - monthly intervals using a 4 - phase liver ct , fdg pet - ct and fdg pet - mri .
patients treated with chemotherapy < 6 weeks prior to scanning or with a contra - indication for mri will be excluded .
mri will be performed using both whole body imaging ( mdixon ) and dedicated liver sequences , including diffusion - weighted imaging , t1 in - phase and opposed - phase , t2 and dynamic contrast - enhanced imaging .
the results of all modalities will be scored by 4 individual reviewers and inter - observer agreement will be determined .
the reference standard will be histology or clinical follow - up. a questionnaire regarding patients' experience with both modalities will also be completed at the end of the follow - up year .
discussion improved treatment options for local site recurrences following crlm ablation mean that accurate post - ablation staging is becoming increasingly important .
the combination of the sensitivity of mri as a detection method for small intrahepatic lesions with the ability of fdg pet to visualize enhanced metabolism at the ablation site suggests that fdg pet - mri could potentially improve the accuracy of ( early ) detection of progressive disease , and thus allow swifter and more effective decision - making regarding appropriate treatment .
trial registration trial registration number : nct01895673 radiofrequency ablation liver neoplasms / secondary neoplasm recurrence local liver neoplasms / surgery fdg - pet pet - mri magnetic resonance imaging / methods microwave ablation background thermal ablation techniques , including radiofrequency ablation ( rfa ) and microwave ablation ( mwa ) , are now well - established therapeutic options for the localized treatment of unresectable colorectal liver metastases ( crlm ) [ 1 ] .
although potentially curative in selected cases , these techniques carry a risk of incomplete ablation and can show local tumor progression ( ltp ) rates of up to 30 % , of which > 95 % are diagnosed within one year of ablation [ 2 - 4 ] .
complete tumour clearance , and therefore potential cure , can still be achieved in patients without extensive intra or extrahepatic metastases through re - treatment of a ltp [ 1,5 ] .
imaging plays a key role in diagnosing progressive disease following hepatic rfa and mwa , with post - ablative lesions generally monitored using contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( cect ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .
without proof of lesion growth from consecutive scans , an important weakness of these modalities is the inability to distinguish between reactive tissue surrounding the ablated lesion ( post - ablation effects ) and viable tumour [ 6 ] .
diffusion - weighed ( dw ) mri outperforms cect in the initial detection of small hepatic metastases (< 1 cm ) and is also superior to cect in the detection of crlm after treatment with systemic chemotherapy without radiation load [ 7,8 ] .
due to the visualization of increased glucose metabolism in tumour cells , fluorine - 18 deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( fdg - pet ) is a useful tool in the assessment of treatment response following rfa [ 6,9 ] .
ablated lesions that show focal fdg uptake in or within 1 cm of the ablated area are considered clinically suspect for ltp [ 6,10 ] .
however , as fdg - pet lacks an anatomical reference it is less accurate in determining the exact location of viable tumour tissue .
a solution to this problem was found by combining fdg - pet and ct images to provide fused functional and morphological data [ 11 ] , and pet - ct has since been shown to be superior to cect in the identification of ltp [ 6,9 ] .
integrated pet - mri is a new imaging modality , combining the advantages of fdg - pet with the ability of mri to detect small liver tumours without ct radiation exposure .
recent results show that detection sensitivity for hepatic metastases , through post hoc fusion of fdg - pet images and 1.5 tesla contrast - enhanced ( gadolinium ) mri obtained from two different scanners , is significantly higher than for pet - ct ( 93 % and 76 % respectively , p = 0.02 ) [ 12 ] .
pet - mri appears to offer higher lesion conspicuity and diagnostic confidence compared to pet - ct [ 13 ] , and this additional information can influence clinical management of cancer patients the combined advantages of detection of smaller hepatic tumours with a higher sensitivity and detection of focal fdg uptake suggestive for ltp indicates that pet - mri could provide complementary information and facilitate improved clinical decision making [ 14 ] .
to the best of our knowledge , the effectiveness of integrated pet - mri in rfa or mwa follow - up has not been investigated .
the primary aim of this study is therefore to determine the accuracy of 18 f - fdg pet - mri in ltp detection .
secondary aims will be to investigate whether pet - mri is more accurate than pet - ct and cect in the detection of new intra - hepatic lesions , and to evaluate inter - observer variability , the impact of pet - mri on future treatment and patients' views on both modalities .
we hypothesize that pet - mri will be at least equivalent to pet - ct in the diagnosis of ltp , but superior to pet - ct in the early detection of new intrahepatic lesions and therefore able to positively influence decision making in patients with rfa / mwa - treated crlm .
methods / design design this prospective study has been approved by the medical ethical review board of the vu university medical center .
the study is investigator - sponsored , independent of industry and is registered at clinicaltrials.gov under number nct01895673 .
primary and secondary objectives we will assess the effectiveness of fdg pet - mri in the follow - up of thermal ablation ( rfa / mwa ) of crlm .
our primary aim will be to assess the accuracy of fdg pet - mri in the diagnosis of local progression in the first year after rfa / mwa of crlm .
therefore , all fdg pet - mri images will be compared to fdg pet - ct and 4 - phase liver ct images , which are the current standard of care .
results of different imaging sets will be compared on a per - patient and a per - lesion base .
these results will then be compared to a reference standard : either histological outcome ( if available ) or clinical follow - up. secondary outcomes will include the accuracy of diagnosis of new intrahepatic disease after rfa / mwa .
since only a single 18 f - fdg per combined pet - mri and pet - ct visit will be applied , we will have the opportunity to investigate whether dual - time point pet can increase the specificity of the 18 f - fdg signal and increase diagnostic accuracy [ 15 ] .
the reproducibly and robustness of inter - observer variation will also be determined .
clinical relevance will be studied by recruiting a panel consisting of a radiologist , interventional radiologist , nuclear medicine physician , oncologist , oncological surgeon and a radiation oncologist to retrospectively review pet - mri images and agree on the preferred treatment .
choice of treatment based on pet - mri will then be compared to the treatment that was actually received based on pet - ct and 4 - phase liver ct. finally , patients' preferences will be assessed at one year follow - up using a specifically designed questionnaire that compares both modalities ( table 1 ) .

patients written informed consent will be obtained from all participants .
patients scheduled to undergo either rfa / mwa of crlm , solely or in combination with resection , or rfa / mwa for ltp after previous thermal ablation of crlm , will be recruited at a referral university hospital ( vu university medical center , amsterdam , the netherlands ) and a large community teaching hospital ( gelderse vallei , ede , the netherlands ) .
assessment prior to ablation consists of a full - body 18 f - fdg pet - ct and 4 - phase liver ct or mri of the liver .
increased fdg uptake of the crlm on the pre - operative pet scan is a requirement .
all patients will be discussed by a multidisciplinary liver board prior to treatment and suitability for rfa or mwa will be at their discretion .
treatment will depend , amongst others things , on the number , location and size of lesions .
an open approach using intra - operative ultrasound is preferred as an initial treatment , and a ct - guided percutaneous approach will be used for treatment of recurrences .
technical success , or was the tumor ablated according to protocol , was required before inclusion [ 16 ] .
our protocol defines a complete ablation as the entire size of the tumor plus a 1 cm tumor free margin as seen on ious or ct. this area was calculated during the planning phase of the procedure .
exclusion criteria are chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to the first scan , allergies to contrast media and general contraindications for mri .
patients with an egfr < 60 will be admitted for additional hydration before and after the scans .
if chemotherapy is initiated or if the ablated lesion is resected during the first year of follow - up , participation in the study will be aborted .
study procedure the standard follow - up protocol during the first year after rfa / mwa of crlm in the vu university medical center consists of three - monthly whole - body fdg pet - ct and 4 - phase liver ct , in combination with measurement of serum carcinoembryonic antigen ( only when elevated pre - operatively ) .
for the purposes of this study , liver fdg pet - mri will be added to the routine procedure , using a 3.0 tesla ingenuity tf philips scanner ( philips medical systems , cleveland , oh ) .
this hybrid pet - mri system is characterized by a sequential acquisition mode and has separate scanners with a turntable patient handling system facilitating patient motion between the mri and the pet gantries that are located at a 3 meter distance from each other.at the end of one year follow - up , patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire evaluating their experience with the pet - mri compared to the pet - ct. the study procedure is illustrated in figure 1 .
figure 1 flow diagram of study procedure .
imaging a summary of imaging steps is provided in table 2 .
pet imaging will be conducted according to eanm guidelines [ 17 ] .
18 f - fdg will be administered while the patient is supine on the pet - mri table using mr compatible devices .
the mri will be performed during the period in which fdg distributes throughout the body , and pet will commence approximately 60 minutes after fdg injection .
the pet of the pet - ct will follow 20 minutes (+/ - 5 ) after completion of the pet - mri , followed by a whole body low - dose ct for attenuation and image - fusion and a diagnostic 4 - phase liver ct. this scanning sequence has been chosen to minimize the burden for the patient , to optimize reliability of the dedicated liver mri sequences and to minimize the time between both pet scans .

these images are routinely reconstructed in the coronal plane .
dedicated axial liver imaging is performed : axial t2 - weighted tse ( tr / te 850 / 80 msec ) ; t1 in - and opposed phase gre ( tr / te 180 / 2.3 / 1.15 msec ) and diffusion - weighted imaging ( tr / te 2407 / 53 msec ) using b - values ( 0 , 50 and 800 sec / mm2 ) .
this is followed by a fat - suppressed t1 - weighted gre using iv gadolinium - chelate at 0.1 mmol / kg ( dotarem , 0.5 mmol / ml ; guerbet , gorichem , the netherlands ) in 4 separate phases : pre - contrast , arterial phase ( determined by a bolus tracking method to ensure optimal arterial enhancement , which includes full enhancement of the hepatic artery and only partial enhancement of the portal vein [ 19 ]) , as well as 70 and 200 msec post - injection .
total imaging time for the dedicated liver protocol is approximately 45 minutes .
18f - fdg pet ( pet - mri ) after mri , the pet - mri table is turned and the patient is placed in the pet gantry .
the pet features an 18 cm axial field of view , 9 cm overlap between bed positions and a 5.5 mm reconstructed isotropic spatial resolution .
the scan trajectory covers the skull base to mid - thigh , taking 2 min / bed position .
reconstructed images have an image matrix size of 144x144 , voxel size of 4x4 mm and slice thickness of 5 mm. data are reconstructed by means of a blob - os - tf algorithm .
fusion images are created with the pet sequence and atmri , mdixon axial and coronal whole body and axial t2 liver .
18f - fdg pet ( pet - ct ) the philips gemini tf pet - ct system ( philips medical systems , cleveland , ohio , usa ) is comparable to the pet unit of the pet - mri .
scanning is started with a whole body pet ( skull base to mid - thigh ) , with data being reconstructed by means of a raw action ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm using default reconstruction parameters .
time of flight ( tf ) information is used during reconstruction .
reconstructed images have an image matrix size of 144x144 , a voxel size of 4x4 mm and a slice thickness of 5 mm. the acquisition time per bed position is adjusted for the time interval between the start of pet - ct and fdg injection and will usually be 2 - 3 min / bed position .
low - dose ct this is followed by a low - dose ct for attenuation and image fusion and is collected using a beam current of 30 - 50 mas at 100 kev .
the low - dose ct is reconstructed using an image matrix of 512x512 , resulting in voxel sizes of 1.17x1.17 mm and a slice thickness of 5 mm .
4 - phase liver ct a diagnostic 4 - phase ct of the liver using 100 ml xenetix300 ( guerbet , villepinte , france ) is subsequently performed , using a beam current of 175 - 220mas per slice .
first , a precontrast scan is run , followed by the arterial phase using a bolus - tracking method and a 80 kev scan to ensure optimal arterial enhancement [ 20 ] .
during the venous phase , 70 sec post - injection , the entire abdomen is scanned , followed by a scan of the liver in the late venous phase ( 240 sec post - injection ) , both at 120 kev .
the images are reconstructed using a matrix of 512x512 and a slice thickness of 3 - 5 mm. all images are sent to a digital picture archive and communication system ( pacs ; sectra ab , linkoping , sweden ) .
image analysis only pet - ct and 4 - phase liver ct images will be analysed and used in the context of routine patient care during clinical follow - up. the pet - mri images will not be part of the diagnostic and follow - up process .
for imaging analysis , blinded data sets of all scans will be viewed both separately and independently by two designated , experienced radiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians .
the reviewers will be blinded to the results of the other imaging modalities and to final patient outcome .
a time - interval of at least four weeks will be introduced between the first and second review .
progressive disease will be scored on a per - patient and per - lesion basis , and results of all imaging modalities will be compared .
the criteria for progression on different modalities are defined in table 3 .
each lesion on each modality will be scored on a separate form and results will be scored from 1 - 5 ( table 4 ) and size and location of the lesions will be reported .
a ltp is defined as a lesion located in or within 1 cm of the ablation zone ; a new intrahepatic lesion is defined as a lesion located more than 1 cm distant from the ablation zone [ 6 ] .
on mri , a suspicious lesions has to meet the definition of ltp in at least two different sequences before it is considered positive for progression .

if either resection of a ltp or chemotherapy is indicated , the patient will be excluded from further participation in the study .
if patients are eligible for repeated rfa / mwa treatment of the ltp , study participation will be continued .
patients with new intrahepatic lesions that are eligible for local treatment ( surgery or ablation ) will remain in the study , as long as the initially ablated area remains unaffected ( figure 1 ) .
prior to re - treatment with rfa / mwa , several biopsies will be taken from the suspected area for pathological confirmation .
to minimize the chance of ' track seeding ' , tract ablation will be performed after the procedure .
extra - hepatic disease will be treated as deemed suitable .
if there is any doubt as to whether an imaging feature indicates recurrent disease , the scan will be repeated after 3 months as a confirmation .
sample size calculation sample size estimates are based on the incidence of local site recurrences and new intrahepatic metastases .
previous studies have shown that 25 - 40 % of the patients treated with rfa / mwa develop ltp , of which > 95 % occur within the first year [ 4 ] .
in addition , 30 - 40 % of the patients will develop new intrahepatic metastases [ 2,21 ] .
at least 5 ltp and 5 new intrahepatic lesions are necessary for a meaningful comparison between pet - ct and pet - mri in this observational study .
using the binominal distribution ( with p = 0.35 and n = 20 ) , the chance of finding 5 ltp and the chance of finding 5 new intrahepatic lesions in our population are both 88 % .
this suggests that the study has a satisfactory chance of success with a sample size of 20 patients .
patients excluded during the study period will be replaced by new participants , so that 20 patients will have completed one year follow - up at study completion .
statistical analysis we will determine the accuracy of pet - mri for diagnosing recurrent disease compared to each imaging method ( mri , ct and pet - ct ) and compared to pathology or clinical follow - up. continuous variables will be summarized with standard descriptive statistics including means , standard deviations , medians and ranges when indicated .
categorical variables will be summarized with frequencies .
mcnemar 's test is used to determine agreement between pet - mri and other modalities .
the inter - observer variability will be quantified with cohen 's kappa and proportions of specific agreement .
p - values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant .
statistical analysis will be performed using spss version 20.0 ( spss inc , chicago ) .
discussion accurate staging is the foundation of prognostic outcomes in oncology and has an immediate effect on patient care in every phase of disease .
although the quality of imaging has improved considerably over the past decades , the search for optimized modalities for specific indications continues .
although the recent introduction of pet - mri combines the major advantages of both techniques , the value of pet - mri in staging for the oncological patient still has to be proven .
ours will be the first study to assess the value of pet - mri in the follow - up of thermal ablation of crlm .
early diagnosis of small volume recurrences is the primary goal of intense surveillance strategies following local hepatic tumor ablation .
treatment of these ltp and of new intra - hepatic lesions may allow complete tumor eradication and therefore provide potential cure in patients treated for crlm [ 5 ] .
to detect recurrent disease at an early stage , we advocate a local surveillance protocol with intensive follow - up over the 12 - month period in which most recurrences occur [ 4 ] .
although numerous studies have attempted to define an optimal imaging algorithm after local treatment of liver metastases , the frequency , duration and survival benefit of surveillance have not yet been formally proven and general consensus is lacking [ 22,23 ] .
to the best of our knowledge , no prospective studies comparing follow - up schemes after rfa or mwa have yet been published .
pet - ct has proven value in the imaging - based diagnosis of recurrent disease following rfa / mwa of liver malignancies , and repeat treatment is often initiated solely based on this imaging modality .
the importance of histological proof of malignancy of a recurrence detected by imaging has long been a subject of debate within the thermal ablation field .
we will therefore take multiple biopsies of the suspected area , taking into account the possibility of sampling necrotic tissue rather than active tumor tissue ( sampling error ) .
a sampling error of this type may influence our calculation of the specificity of pet - mri , because false - positive results cannot be completely ruled out .
the reference standard ( in addition to pathology ) for imaging accuracy will be the presence or absence of recurrent disease at clinical follow - up in the first year .
the period between fdg injection and acquisition of the pet - ct in this study is 30 minutes longer than the standard protocol , which might increase our ability to detect intrahepatic malignancies .
background activity in the normal liver parenchyma due to high glucose metabolism and abundant expression of glut - 1 and hexokinase ii can often impede detection of liver lesions .
following a rationale that fdg accumulates over time in malignant cells as compared to healthy or inflamed hepatocytes , several authors have proposed that pet - ct imaging may improve lesion detectability over time through an improvement in the tumor - to - background ratio [ 24,25 ] .
it is known that fdg uptake by a tumor may not plateau before 90 - 120 minutes and peak levels may persist for up to 4 hours after injection [ 26 ] .
using target - liver ratios , we will investigate whether the 30 minutes delay between both pet - scans contribute to an improved differentiation of post - ablation inflammation and residual tumor [ 15 ] .
the study has not been designed to provide semi - quantitative values for fdg uptake as predictors of therapeutic response , generally expressed as the standard uptake volume ( suv ) .
however , the suv can vary considerably and the time lapse between fdg injection and acquisition is a major contributor to this variation [ 27 ] .
follow - up is only worthwhile when patients comply to a physician 's recommendations , and compliance with medical advice has been a challenge since first described by hippocrates [ 28 ] .
numerous factors determine whether a person 's behaviour coincides with medical advice , such as the duration of therapy , the complexity of the regimen and psychosocial factors [ 29 ] .
adherence to follow - up can also be affected by a patients' negative experience of examinations such as discomfort and pain [ 30,31 ] .
these patient preferences may contribute to final decision making on follow - up imaging , especially when modalities are known to be equally effective .
we formulated the hypothesis that pet - mri provides a less favourable experience when compared to pet - ct , as the mri examination may elicit anxiety due to the need to remain immobile and alone while enclosed in the mri tunnel for a prolonged period of time , in addition to the noise associated with the examination [ 32 ] .
in this study , we solely focus on the ability of pet - mri to identify intrahepatic recurrences , since most recurrences after local treatment of the liver reoccur in the liver [ 1,2 ] .
however , a large group of patients will eventually develop extrahepatic metastases or a local recurrence at the site of the primary tumor .
these are important predictors of overall survival since they determine whether local hepatic recurrences can still be treated [ 5 ] .
pet - ct is currently the modality of choice to rule out extra - hepatic disease [ 33 ] , but if pet - mri proves to be effective in local follow - up future studies should focus on extrahepatic follow - up and the ability and feasibility of pet - mri to detect metastatic lesions throughout the body .
in addition , randomised controlled trials should be performed to compare pet - ct and pet - mri , or when one of the techniques has proven to be significantly superior , an intense versus a less intense follow - up protocol after thermal ablation of crlm and the effect on overall survival .
pet - mri is currently only available in highly specialized hospitals .
before general implementation can be pursued , the potential and limitations of this modality need to be thoroughly investigated .
in the current climate , associated costs also play an important role in the implementation of diagnostic and treatment methods in daily patient care .
we are aware of only one study to date that has addressed the cost - effectiveness of pet - ct after rfa of hepatic malignancies [ 10 ] .
these authors showed that pet - ct is more cost - effective than independent use of ct or mri .
however , as no study has yet addressed the cost - effectiveness of using pet - mri , long - term cost - effectiveness , the results of future treatment and the yield of different scan - moments all need to be assessed .
this study will contribute to the search for an optimal follow - up protocol for patients treated with rfa or mwa for crlm .
as minimally invasive procedures become increasingly important in the treatment of the oncologic patient , adequate staging of disease is essential for optimal treatment results .
this study may contribute to improved staging and consequently to the effective treatment of this ever - expanding patient group .

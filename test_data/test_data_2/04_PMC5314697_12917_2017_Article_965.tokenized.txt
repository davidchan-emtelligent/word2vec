background adhesions are a common postoperative surgical complication .
liquid honey has been used intraperitoneally to reduce the incidence of these adhesions .
however , solid barriers are considered more effective than liquids in decreasing postoperative intra - abdominal adhesion formation ; therefore , a new pectin - honey hydrogel ( phh ) was produced and its effectiveness was evaluated in a rat cecal abrasion model .
standardized cecal / peritoneal abrasion was performed through laparotomy in 48 adult sprague - dawley rats to induce peritoneal adhesion formation .
rats were randomly assigned to a control ( c ) and treatment ( t ) group .
in group t , phhs were placed between the injured peritoneum and cecum .
animals were euthanized on day 15 after surgery .
adhesions were evaluated macroscopically and adhesion scores were recorded and compared between the two groups .
inflammation , fibrosis , and neovascularization were histologically graded and compared between the groups .
results in group c , 17 of 24 ( 70.8 %) animals developed adhesions between the cecum and peritoneum , while in group t only 5 of 24 ( 20.8 %) did ( p = 0.0012 ) .
in group c , one rat had an adhesion score of 3 , sixteen had scores of 2 , and seven rats had scores of 0 .
in group t , four rats had adhesion scores of 2 , one rat had an adhesion score of 1 and nineteen have score 0 ( p = 0.0003 ) .
significantly lower grades of inflammation , fibrosis , and neovascularization were seen in group t ( p = 0.006 , p = 0.001 , p = 0.002 , respectively ) .
conclusion phh is a novel absorbable barrier that is effective in preventing intra - abdominal adhesions in a cecal abrasion model in rats .

adhesion formation is a complex process involving cellular , biochemical , and immunological factors .
adhesions can develop when inflammatory responses perturb the equilibrium between fibrin formation and fibrinolysis [ 5 ] .
the most common symptoms are chronic abdominal pain , small bowel obstruction , and secondary female infertility [ 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 ] .
these complications cause significant morbidity and pose a significant economic burden [ 6 , 8 ] .
many potential preventive agents have been investigated , including intra - abdominal barriers , pharmacological agents , and synthetic devices [ 1 , 4 , 9 ] .
at present , physical barriers are considered the most effective treatments for preventing postoperative intra - abdominal adhesion formation [ 10 ] .
there are various types of commercially available anti - adhesion barriers such as hyaluronic acid / carboxymethyl cellulose membranes1 and hyaluronic acid / carboxymethyl cellulose gels2 .
these membranes work by preventing contact between damaged surfaces [ 3 , 5 , 10 , 11 ] .
in recent years , honey has been used for the prevention of postoperative peritoneal adhesions [ 5 , 12 , 13 ] .
honey is a heterogeneous substance that inhibits the growth of both gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria , has anti - inflammatory effects , and promotes healing processes following peritoneal damage [ 5 , 12 , 13 , 14 ] .
because honey has proven effective in preventing intra - abdominal adhesions in liquid form , and since anti - adhesion barriers may be more effective than intraperitoneal solutions , we developed honey - based films that could be used as physical anti - adhesion barriers. by combining some properties of honey such as hygroscopicity , viscosity , and healing effects with the properties of a physical barrier , we hypothesized that an effective means of preventing abdominal adhesions could be developed .
mixing honey with a gelling agent ( pectin ) resulted in the creation of pectin - honey hydrogels ( phhs ) that can be easily applied between damaged organs in the peritoneum .
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of phhs for the prevention of intra - abdominal adhesions .
results macroscopical examination in 48 rats , no wound site infection or presence of intra - abdominal abscess was observed .
presence of adhesions in group c , 17 of 24 ( 70.8 %) animals developed adhesions between the cecum and the peritoneum , while in group t only 5 of 24 ( 20,8 %) did ( p = 0.0012 ) ( table 1 ) .

the difference in the two groups was not significant ( p = 0.517 ) .
in group c , 1 animal developed adhesion between the apex of cecum and the antimesenteric site of the distal jejunum , in group t 1 animal developed adhesion between the apex of the cecum and the side of a portion of mid - jejunum .
in group t 1 animal developed adhesion between the apex of cecum and the median ligament of bladder ( table 2 ) .

median adhesion score for group t was 2 ( 0,2 ) , while for group c was 0 ( 0,3 ) .
the distribution of scores in the two groups was significantly different ( p = 0.0003 ) ( table 3 ) .

discussion the phhs developed in this study showed a local anti - adhesive effect that prevented intra - abdominal adherence in a cecal abrasion model in rats .
in the control group , 17 of 24 rats developed adhesions between the cecum and peritoneum , while in treatment group only 5 of 24 rats did .
the adhesion scores and the extents of adhesions were significant reduced after treatment with phhs without complications related to tissue healing .
histopathological scores with respect to inflammation , fibrosis , and neovascularization were significant lower in the treatment group than those in the control group .
many experimental models exist for studying peritoneal adhesions .
the cecal abrasion model is a very effective way to create peritoneal adhesions because mechanical intestinal damage activates fibrinolysis and fibrinogenesis , leading to adhesion formation .
the cecal abrasion model simulates the clinical situation of the viscera being manipulated to perform surgery .
we modified this model by standardizing the number of passages with the gauze on the cecum and by assign animals to c or t group only after having performed the scraping .
the first modification was made in order to standardize the damage inflicted to the cecal serosal .
the second has been done in order to avoid a possible bias given by knowing in advance the group allocation of the specimen , thus influencing the surgeon toward performing less or more severe lesions .
several researchers have used different scoring systems for grading adhesions [ 3 , 12 , 15 , 16 ] .
many of these studies used swolin 's scoring model , which macroscopically grades adhesions from 0 to 3 according to their severity .
we chose to use this method because it is easy to apply and allowed us to express the results clearly [ 17 ] .
in terms of methods of preventing adhesions , many studies have reported that pharmacological agents are not effective [ 10 , 11 ] .
physical barriers are the most widely used method of adhesion prevention in humans , and have been shown to be effective in preventing intra - abdominal adhesions in animal models [ 10 ] .
during recent years , many commercially available substances have been used to reduce the occurrence of postoperative adhesions .
carboxymethylcellulose bioresorbable membrane is one such material .
some studies have demonstrated that a carboxymethylcellulose - based membrane1 significantly reduces the incidence and extent of adhesions .
however , the therapeutic effect of this membrane may be limited to the site of application , and the material seems difficult to handle in clinical practice [ 3 , 5 , 18 ] .
in response to the need for effective solutions , honey has become increasingly popular and several studies have been published demonstrating its effectiveness in assisting the peritoneal healing process [ 5 , 12 ] .
however , studies regarding its effects on preventing peritoneal adhesions are still limited .
aysan and emre used honey intraperitoneally to reduce postoperative adhesion formation , and reported that the treatment was effective and was associated with no toxic effects [ 5 , 12 ] .
in a preliminary unpublished in vivo test of the pectin - honey hydrogels , we treated three animals with phh produced with 4 g of honey .
all the animals died from ascites caused by the osmotic effect of the phh .
this fact was not reported by aysan and emre , and could have been caused by the presence of pectin in the films , the low content of water in the phh , or the hygroscopicity of honey .
in the second part of the study , we used 2 g of honey for phh construction and none of the animals showed any side effects .
this composition of phh reduced inflammation and prevented adhesions formations without causing any side effects [ 19 ] .
the results of this study demonstrated that phh is effective in preventing the formation of postoperative adhesions .
the material can be easily applied by surgeons and can be placed in deep anatomical sites .
the phhs are biocompatible and rapidly metabolized in contrast with the carboxymethylcellulose - polylactic acid membranes [ 18 ] .
we hypothesize that the mechanical barrier combined with the absorption properties of honey may have played a key role in the inhibition of adhesion formation in the present study .
more studies are needed on this topic , but the intraperitoneal use of phhs does seem to significantly reduce the occurrence of postoperative adhesions at the site of application .
phh are not effective in preventing adhesion at distant sites from application , as demonstrated by the presence of adhesions between other organs other than cecum and peritoneum in treated animals .
this is a limit of antiadhesion barriers , that extends to the product we tried in this study .
the present study was limited in one key way .
we only used one model of adhesion formation , so we cannot be sure if the phhs would behave the same if tested in a range of different models or even in genuine cases .
further , using dry gauzes to create the cecal abrasion , could be a confounding factor , because adhesions could be generated by small pieces of gauze lost during the procedures and acting as a foreign body on the surface of the intestine .
another important limit is given by the use of a rat model .
in fact , many agents that proved effective in rats could n't be demonstrated as effective in humans , and basing from this study we cannot predict phh behaving differently .
conclusions in conclusion , we observed that damaged cecal and abdominal wall surfaces treated with phhs are significantly less likely to develop postoperative lesions .
however , further investigations are needed in order to establish whether these results are transferable to other models and genuine cases , and to establish the true relevance of this treatment modality to the prevention of postoperative adhesions in the peritoneum .
methods preparation of phhs we used a modified version of the preparation method described by walker [ 19 , 20 ] .
briefly , the phhs were prepared from a starting solution ( 1:1 v / v ) of liquid honey3 and sterile deionized water .
half this volume of pectin powder4 was then added gradually and with continuous stirring until the mixture was homogenized to obtain a final mixture of 1:1:1 v / v of honey , water and pectin .
the resulting foam was spread into 2 - mm films and hot - air - dried at 40 +/ - 0.5 degreesc for 6 h. we then cut the hard substance into 3 x 3 - cm squares and further conditioned it in an air drier at 25 +/ - 1 degreesc for 5 d. the films were then collected and vacuum packed in polyethylene .
all membranes were sterilized by gamma - irradiation at 25 kgray by sterigenics international ( sterigenics international lltc , bologna , italy ) [ 19 ] .
surgical procedures all procedures were approved by the bioethical committee of the university of turin and by the italian ministry of health ( protocol number 262 / 2015 - pr on 20 / 04 / 2015 ) .
a total of 48 adult male sprague - dawley rats weighting 225 - 250 g were purchased from charles rivers5 ( italy ) .
all rats were housed in single cages for 7 d prior to the start of the experiment .
the room temperature was set at 23 degreesc for the experimental period and the cages were cleaned daily .
the rats were fed a commercial diet and water was provided ad libitum .
anesthesia was induced by intramuscular administration of 5 mg / kg of xylazine6 and 50 mg / kg of tiletamine and zolazepam7 .
the rats we kept under anesthesia for 1 h , during which the abdomen was shaved and the skin was swabbed three times using an iodopovidone - chlorhexidine scrub .
a 4 - cm midline incision was made in the abdominal wall .
the cecum was exposed , and the apex was abraded with surgical gauze 100 times [ 21 ] .
the left abdominal wall was abraded with a no .
21 scalpel blade 100 times .
the cecum was returned to the abdominal cavity in its proper anatomic position .
the scratching procedure was performed until hemorrhagic points were observed on the surface without perforation .
all surgeries were performed by the same operator ( mg ) .
only after inducing injuries , the rats were randomly assigned to the treatment or control groups .
in the treatment group , the phhs were applied between the injured cecum and peritoneum .
the midline incision was closed in two layers ; the fascia was closed with 3 - 0 - usp glycomer 6318 , while the skin was closed with 3 - 0 - usp nylon8 .
all surgical procedures took approximately 20 min .
during the procedure and shortly thereafter , the rats were placed on a warm plate to avoid hypothermia , and 5 - ml isotonic sodium chloride ( 0.9 %) was administered subcutaneously .
animals were randomly divided into two groups of 24 animals each , using a free online calculator ( www.random.org ) : group c : negative control group .
no treatment applied .
group t : group treated by applying the phhs over the injury .
macroscopical examination after 15 d , euthanasia was performed and the abdominal cavity was inspected through a u - shaped incision in the anterior abdominal wall .
signs of wound site infection or anastomotic abscesses were recorded .
presence of adhesions any macroscopic adhesion in the abdominal cavity , either involving the abrasion site or other organs were identified and recorded .
number of adhesions per group indicated as percentage were compared with a fisher exact test .
adhesions scoring adhesions were scored according to the protocol described by swolin [ 17 ] ( table 5 ) .
scores were then compared between groups with a mann - whitney test .
table 5 the adhesion grading by swolin [ 17 ] grade 0 no adhesions 1 smooth adhesions that split either spontaneously or upon application of weak traction 2 firm adhesions splitting when traction is applied 3 dense adhesions requiring dissection with a blade histopathological evaluation the cecum and abdominal wall were harvested for histopathological examination and the tissue samples fixed in a 10 % formaldehyde solution for histopathological examination .
samples were routinely processed by dehydration and paraffin embedding , and 5 - mum cross - sections were produced .
the samples were examined under a light microscope after hematoxylin - eosin staining and evaluated blindly by two expert pathologists to determine the presence of inflammation , fibroblastic activity , and neovascularization according to scores in accordance with swolin [ 17 ] ( table 6 ) .
table 6 the presence of inflammation , fibroblastic activity , and neovascularization according to adherence scores by swolin [ 17 ] grade inflammatory cell infiltrate fibrosis vascularization 0 absent or normal in number none none 1 slight increase slight one to two vessels 2 moderate infiltration moderate three to nine vessels 3 dense dense ten or more vessels statistical analysis sample size was calculated for the parameter " presence of adhesions " hypothesizing for group 1 75 % and for group 2 25 % of animals with adhesions .
alpha level was set at 0.050 and power at 89 % .
further 4 animals were added to the result to account for possible deaths in the operative or postoperative period .
statistical analyses were performed with graphpad prism 6 software9 .
the normality of the data was evaluated using the shapiro - wilk normality test .
non parametric tests were used for not - normally distributed data .
a p < value 0.05 was considered statistically significant .

hyperpolarized 129xe dynamic mri lung k - space sampling spiral signal - time curves copd epsrc cruk source - schema - version - number2.0component - idmrm26912cover - datemay 2018details - of - publishers - convertorconverter : wiley _ ml3gv2 _ to _ nlmpmc version : version = 5.3.2.2 mode : remove _ fc converted : 05.03.2018 introduction functional pulmonary imaging techniques including hyperpolarized ( hp ) gas ( 3he and 129xe ) mri are a growing field for the non - invasive assessment of regional lung function 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 .
hyperpolarized gas mri enables the evaluation of ventilation and gas diffusion , which is typically carried out in a static imaging fashion during a breath - hold interval , following inhalation of 3he or 129xe , and demonstrates homogeneous signal intensity in healthy lung regions 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 .
regions of absent or relatively low signal are known as " ventilation defects " and correspond to regions of obstructed airflow 9 , 10 .
dynamic ventilation imaging with hp gas mri is possible during a complete breath cycle , including the inhalation and exhalation intervals , using fast non - cartesian k - space sampling strategies 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 .
previously , hp 3he dynamic mri with an interleaved - spiral readout was reported to be sensitive to regional signal - time curves in six healthy volunteers and six patients with lung disease , including severe asthma , emphysema , and cystic fibrosis 16. with wider availability and lower cost than 3he , regional lung function assessment with hp 129xe - mri offers a more clinically viable technique .
in addition , 129xe chemical shift - based spectroscopy and imaging approaches provide a unique opportunity to derive regional functional information about gas transfer and exchange dynamics because of the inherent solubility and chemical shift of 129xe 17 , 18 , 19 .
the purpose of this study was to develop and optimize a multi - slice dynamic hp 129xe ventilation ( dxev ) imaging technique and investigate the feasibility of capturing signal - time curves using an interleaved - spiral k - space sampling strategy during a complete breath cycle .
to capture dynamic gas flow using hp 3he ventilation imaging , a temporal resolution of hundreds of milliseconds is required .
although this has been successfully achieved using echo - planar imaging - based methods , the images contained significant blooming artefacts 20 .
blooming artefacts have been reduced by using an interleaved spiral k - space sampling strategy 16 , 21 , which has the additional advantage of improved temporal resolution over standard cartesian 3he ventilation imaging 22 .
susceptibility artefacts on dynamic 3he ventilation images were reported to be less apparent with a higher number of interleaves 16 , 23 .
a radial acquisition strategy has previously been reported to be superior for susceptibility artifact reduction when a larger number of views ( i.e. , more interleaves ) is used 11 .
however , the larger number of views limited both the snr and the temporal resolution when capturing the dynamics of gas ventilation , because of the use of lower flip angles and gas - inflow effects 24 , 25 , 26 .
the relatively long transverse relaxation time ( t2 *) of 129xe in the gas phase ( t2 * = 52 +/ - 20 ms at 1.5t ) 27 compared to 3he ( t2 * = 27.8 +/ - 1.2 ms at 1.5t ) 28 allows the use of longer readout times per interleave , fewer radiofrequency ( rf ) pulses , and larger flip angles 18 .
the use of fewer interleaves allows for rapid coverage of the whole of k - space , resulting in higher temporal resolution in dynamic gas ventilation imaging .
in this study , we describe the successful application of a multi - slice dxev imaging technique in human lungs .
the feasibility of capturing signal - time curves using dxev imaging during inhalation , short breath - hold (~ 5s ) , and exhalation intervals was determined in healthy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) subjects .
the temporal and spatial resolution of signal - time curves were also investigated in a gas - flow phantom and compared to finite element modelling of gas - flow .
theory dynamics of hp 129xe mr signal the loss of hp 129xe gas signal as a function of a train of rf pulses is modelled as a static system where the total concentration of hp 129xe is constant within a breath - hold interval 29 .
therefore , signal loss from a gas phantom filled with a certain amount of hp gas is proportional to the number of rf pulses , the flip angle , and the longitudinal relaxation time , t1 30 , 31 .
however , in the case of dynamic ventilation imaging , the hp gas signal also depends on the concentration of 129xe gas as a function of time because of the gas - inflow effects , which incorporate 129xe gas convection and diffusion 26 , 32 , 33 .
therefore , the equation governing the loss of hp 129xe gas signal for dynamic ventilation gas imaging is given by : ( 1 ) s = axt ( alpha ( r )) x [ cosn - 1 ( alpha ) xsin ( alpha )] xexp ( - tt1 ) xexp ( - tet2 *) xcxe ( r,t ) .
where a is a scaling constant that is dependent on 129xe polarization levels , coil sensitivity , receive gain , and the point spread function , which depends on the k - space sampling strategy ( i.e. , spiral , radial , cartesian ) 18 , 34 .
t is transmit profile of the rf coil where the flip angle , alpha , changes as a function of the position , r 35 .
the term [ cosn - 1 ( alpha ) xsin ( alpha )] is associated to the rf depolarization because of the excitation of magnetization as a function of the flip angle , alpha and the number of rf pulses , n 18 , 23 .
the first exponential term is longitudinal relaxation where t is the imaging scan time when 129xe gas is within the lungs and t1 is the time constant for the hp magnetization 36 within the lungs to relax to thermal equilibrium .
the second exponential term is the transverse relaxation where t2 * is the transverse relaxation decay time constant and te is the echo time .
cxe is the volume concentration of 129xe gas within a region of interest ( roi ) related to bulk - flow ( i.e. , convection ) and 129xe gas diffusion as a function of time because of the different 129xe gas arrival times to different rois .
the dynamic concentration of 129xe gas , cxe ( r,t ) must be calculated spatially and temporally depending on the gas - flow rate .
methods all images were acquired using a 1.5t mri system ( signa hdx , gehc , milwaukee , wi ) and a flexible vest - shaped transmit - receive rf coil ( clinical mr solutions , brookfield , wi ) .
a commercial polarizer system ( model 9300 , polarean , durham , nc ) was used to polarize 86 % nuclear enriched 129xe gas using a flow rate of 1 l / h .
129xe polarization levels of 10 - 15 % were achieved .
polarization was measured using a commercial polarization measurement station ( model 2881 , polarean , durham , nc ) .
design of the k - space trajectory spiral trajectories were designed to achieve an optimal spatial resolution and signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for each interleave strategy within the limits of clinical slew rates of 200 t / m / s and a gradient amplitude of 50 mt / m. the tread per interleaf and the pixel resolutions are shown in table 1 for 1 - interleaf , 2 - interleaf , 4 - interleaf , and 8 - interleaf spirals ( i.e. , n int = 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 ) .
this choice of spiral interleaved strategy resulted in comparable t2 * blurring artefacts (<~ 10 % of the available spatial resolution ) per interleaf .
dxev images were reconstructed with regridding and density weighting with a line broadening of 5hz as described in wiesinger et al .
37 and schulte et al .
38. design of gas - flow phantom a gas - flow phantom was built to investigate the temporal and spatial resolution of dxev imaging .
simulation geometry and a picture of the phantom are shown in figure 1 .
a gas sampling tube with an internal diameter of 5.8 mm was wrapped around a syringe tube ( 60 ml ) in the form of a helix as shown in figure 1a .
the diameter of the syringe body was 26 mm. the syringe body was wrapped with a 15 - mm thick plastic cover to increase the major diameter of the helix tube to 56 mm. the helix tube diameter and the pitch length may vary +/ - 2 mm compared to the simulated phantom geometry because the tubing and the plastic cover were flexible materials as shown in figure 1c .
129xe gas in the reservoir tube was delivered to the syringe through an extension gas sampling tube ( m11145070 , helsinki , finland , ge healthcare ) using an mri contrast agent power injector ( 92901 - t - 153 rev , medrad , warrendale , pa ) .
the maximum reservoir gas - volume and gas - flow rate of the power injector were 60 ml and 10 ml / s , respectively .
this allowed a gas flow rate within the helix tube at rois from h1 to h5 of ~ 250 ml / s : ( 1 ) similar to the gas - flow rate used in the fem simulation model , and ( 2 ) comparable to the gas - flow within the trachea when a liter of gas is inhaled within 4s 39 .

gas - flow phantom imaging single - slice dxev images of the gas - flow phantom were carried out in a coronal plane with a slice thickness of 10 mm that was selected at the center of the phantom including rois from h1 to h5 ( as shown in fig. 1a ) .
the pulse sequence timing diagram is shown in figure 2a for n int = 2 .
twelve sets of dxev images were acquired with pulse repetition time ( tr ) = 0.5 s for n int = 1 and n int = 2 resulting in temporal resolution of 0.5 s and 1 s for each scan , respectively .
although shorter tr values for single - slice phantom imaging were possible , the temporal resolutions were selected by corresponding to the tr values approximately achievable with in vivo multi - slice imaging .
for each scan , the power injector was filled with 60 ml of hp 129xe gas and started simultaneously with the mr scanner (+/ - 0.5 s ) .
to investigate the spatial resolution , dxev images were obtained with n int = 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 , for a field of view of 15 cm corresponding to voxel sizes of 8 mm , 5 mm , 4 mm , and 2.5 mm , respectively .
the total number of rf pulses used was n = 12 , 24 , 48 , and 96 for n int = 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 to achieve 12 sets of single - slice dxev image , respectively .
therefore , the optimal flip angle , alpha opt , was calculated using a constant flip angle approach for the static system that maximized the snr for the very last image as previously proposed by miller et al .
30 as shown in table 1 .
additionally , for n int = 2 , the interleaved i and ii trajectories as shown in figure 2b were reconstructed as two separate images to investigate increased acquisition efficiency similar to the concept of a spiral - in / - out k - space reconstruction 40 .

experimental signal - time curves experimental signal - time curves from h1 to h5 were calculated by taking the mean signal intensity of rois on dxev images ( as shown in online supporting files ; see supporting fig. s1 ) and then compared to the corresponding simulated signal - time curves .
line profiles from h1 to h5 ( fig. 1a ) were calculated from the images taken at a time of t = 6 s to allow direct comparison of the spatial - resolution between n int = 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 .
the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the line profiles were correlated to the spatial resolution .
numerical modelling of cxe ( r,t ) a simulation geometry was built with similar dimensions to the gas - flow phantom geometry as shown in figure 1a .
this enabled quantitative comparison of signal - time curves between simulated and real images .
the simulation geometry consisted of three components including an extension tube , a helix tube along the line profile ( fig. 1a ) , and the syringe body as described in the methods section .
129xe gas was administered through the extension tube and helix tube , within the imaging field of view along the line profile and syringe body as shown in figure 1a .
cxe ( r,t ) was simulated for the gas - flow geometry in two steps as follows : 1 the velocity field of 129xe , uxe , was calculated from the solution of the navier - stokes equations using the laminar flow regime in the steady state , and 2 cxe ( r,t ) was calculated by means of diffusion and convection equations as a function of time including uxe from the first step 41 .
in step 1 , a gas - flow rate of 250 ml / s within the helix tube was selected corresponding to the flow - rate of gas in the trachea when a liter of gas is inhaled over 4 s. this was achieved by selecting a velocity of ~ 0.4 m / s at the inlet boundary of the extension pipe as shown in figure 1a .
gas flows through the extension tube , then through the helix tube , enters the syringe body , and leaves the geometry through the outlet channel .
in step 2 , the inward flux at the inlet boundary was selected to be 0.45 mol / m2s corresponding to the phantom dxev images .
the laminar flow regime was chosen by calculating the reynolds number to be 599 for the inlet boundary ; considering the inlet velocity to be 0.4 m / s , the density of xenon gas is 5.89 kg / m3 and dynamic viscosity is 2.28 x 10 - 5 ns / m2 42 .
the driving force for the xenon gas was diffusion by fick 's law for a diffusion coefficient of 0.14 x 10 - 4 m2 / s 43 and the convection knowing the uxe .
the solution of step 1 from the laminar flow physics interface was coupled to the solution step 2 transport of diluted species interface in comsol multiphysics software ( version 5.2 , burlington , ma ) and yielded the 3d distribution of cxe ( r,t ) .
simulated signal - time curves simulated cxe ( r,t ) was calculated for a step size of 0.1 s to represent the ideal case and 0.5 s for comparison to the tr that was used in the phantom imaging over a time period of 6 s related to the experimental protocol as explained in the methods section .
to calculate cxe , simulated cxe ( r,t ) was integrated for each roi , h1 to h5 ( as shown in fig. 1a ) , with the volume integral limits set to the slice thickness ( 10 mm ) of the rf pulse used in dxev imaging of the gas - flow phantom. by substituting cxe into eq .
( 1 ) , simulated signal - time curves were then derived from h1 to h5 for n int = 1 , which includes the effects of the number of rf pulses ( n = 1:12 ) , flip angle ( alpha = 19degrees ) , t1 = 200 s 44 , and t2 * = 25 ms 45 in the phantom .
the flip angles , t2 * , and t1 between rois were assumed to be constant in eq .
( 1 ) .
for quantitative analysis of the temporal resolution and gas - inflow effects , simulated signal - time curves were compared to the experimental signal - time curves for n int = 1 .
nonetheless t2 * was not measured and assumed to be 25 ms for the phantom imaging , the effect of exp ( - te / t2 *) term was negligible because t2 * > > te = 50 micros .
in vivo imaging multi - slice dxev images were acquired with an n int = 2 spiral from six subjects , three healthy ( male , 43 , 34 , and 31 years of age ) and three copd subjects to investigate the feasibility of capturing signal - time curves .
patients with copd were recruited as part of a study approved by the nres committee south central ( berkshire , rec reference 11 / sc / 0488 ) , and written informed patient consent was obtained .
summary of copd study population is shown in table 2 .
subjects were instructed to inhale 1 l of hp 129xe gas from a tedlar plastic bag ( jensen inert products , coral springs , fl ) within ~ 3 s during an inhalation period , followed by a 5 - s breath - hold , and then exhale the gas over 3 s during the exhalation period .
dxev images were acquired over a total scan time of 20 s , including a baseline - period of ~ 2 s before the inhalation - period and a flush - interval of 5 s after the exhalation - period .
a gaussian - shaped slice selective rf pulse was used to achieve a 15 - mm slice thickness , which allowed for full coverage of the lungs using 13 coronal slices .
dxev images were obtained using a conventional multi - slice imaging scheme in which all slices within the imaging volume were sequentially collected for each interleaf .
for example , considering trmin was 24 ms as shown in figure 2a , the time required to obtain 13 slices was 312 ms for the i interleaf , resulting in a total scan time of 624 ms at the end of the ii interleaf spiral .
this resulted in a tr of 312 ms and a time delay , td = tr - trmin , of 288 ms between i and ii interleaves as shown in figure 2a for the conventional multi - slice imaging .
this timing approach allowed 32 dxev image volume sets to be acquired during a total scan time of ~ 20 s. alpha ( alpha ) was selected to be 10degrees for in vivo imaging to maximize the signal for the very last image at the end of the breath - hold as explained in the phantom imaging subsection .
in vivo signal - time curves and statistical analysis signal - time curves were then obtained from rois selected in the mid zones of the left and right lung and in the trachea .
the signal - time curves were compared between a selected roi ( slice 2 - left ) and other rois for each subject .
the signal - time curves at rois from left and right were expected to be influenced by the subjects' breathing because each subject may breath slightly differently than each other .
therefore , the roi trachea signal is considered as an input boundary condition representing the effects of the subjects' breathing for comparision across the subjects .
the spearman partial correlation analysis was used to include signal - time curves from trachea to eliminate the difference between patient - breathing efforts .
the signal - time curve from roi ( slice 2 - left ) , other rois , and roi trachea were described as the first , second , and controlling variables , respectively .
therefore , the spearman partial correlation rho values were calculated relative to slice 2 - left for each subject while controlling for roi trachea .
a paired samples t test was used to investigate the statistical difference between rho values across the heathy subjects to investigate whether the signal - time curves are repeatable for the healthy lungs .
the mean of healthy volunteer rho values was then compared to copd subjects to investigate whether the difference between heathy and copd subjects was statistically significant within 95 % confidence interval .
the flip angles were calculated in healthy subjects by fitting the term of rf depolarization in eq .
( 1 ) to the breath - hold data similar to hahn et al .
15 assuming t2 * = 25 ms , t1 = 20 s 46 , cxe ( r,t ) are spatially constant ( i.e. , static regime ) .
results the geometry of the gas - flow phantom that was used to obtain simulated cxe ( r,t ) and dxev phantom images are shown in figure 1a .
a simulated cxe ( r,t ) map is shown in figure 1b for the 3.5 - s time point after the power injector was activated .
129xe gas is shown to travel along the line profile within the helical tube with decreasing concentration from h1 to h5 .
as can be seen , cxe ( r,t ) within h1 , h2 , and h3 have nearly reached the concentration of xenon gas at the inlet boundary and is beginning to enter into the syringe body .
the gas - flow along the central core of the syringe body demonstrates bulk flow into the syringe body resulting in a relatively high cxe ( r,t ) at the center ( fig. 1b ) .
simulated values of cxe from h1 to h5 are shown in figure 3a with a time step size of 0.1 s over a total simulation time of 6 s. the concentrations of 129xe gas at h2 and h5 saturate at ~ 2 s and 4 s , respectively .
the gas arrival time from one roi to the next roi takes ~ 0.5 s. therefore , simulated signal - time curves from h1 to h5 are derived for the n int = 1 spiral from eq .
( 1 ) for n = 1 to n = 5 , respectively , as shown in figure 3b with a time step of 0.5 s over a total simulation time of 6 s similar to the dxev images of phantom .
although the cxe ( r,t ) at h1 and h5 is the same after 4 s , the simulated signal - time curve amplitude at h5 is lower than h1 because of the hp gas at h5 having experienced five rf excitations during the gas transit time .
experimental signal - time curves from h1 to h5 using the n int = 1 spiral are also shown in figure 3c .
as expected , experimental signal - time curves ( fig. 3c ) follow a similar pattern to simulated signal - time curves ( fig. 3b ) confirming that the dimension of the signal - time curves and gas - flow rates used in simulations are in agreement with the phantom imaging .
experimental signal - time curves captured using the n int = 2 spiral approach in ( fig. 3d ) are not as good as the n int = 1 spiral because of the time delay ( t d ) of 500 ms between the i and ii interleaves .
the temporal resolution of the n int = 2 spiral approach can be improved by reconstructing interleaves i and ii independently as shown in figure 3e , but at a cost of decreased spatial resolution .
figure 3f shows the line profile of the helix tube ( fig. 1a ) for n int = 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 enabling comparison of their spatial resolutions .
the average fwhm of all peaks from h1 to h5 are 10.0 +/ - 2.5 mm , 6.8 +/ - 0.6 mm , 6.1 +/ - 0.6 mm , and 5.5 +/ - 0.5 mm for n int = 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 , respectively .
the results indicate that the n int = 2 spiral offers comparable spatial resolution to n int = 4 and n int = 8 spirals , but improved temporal resolution .

figure 4 shows an n int = 2 spiral dxev images successfully acquired from the first healthy volunteer .
dxev images enabled signal - time curves to be captured with a very high temporal resolution ( i.e. , 13 coronal slices within 624 ms ) .
representative coronal dxev images from slices 2 and 3 are shown in figures 4a,b that were averaged over eight time frames during the breath - hold interval corresponding to eight time points in the signal - time curves as shown in figure 4g .
corresponding signal - time curves from roi - left and roi - right are shown in figures 4e,f. slice 2 and slice 3 in figures 4a,b represent two consecutive coronal slices located in the posterior lung regions .
the image intensity distribution is homogeneous in the posterior regions because these are located some distance from the trachea and large bronchioles , resulting in similar signal - time curves trends when roi - l ( fig. 4a ) and roi - r ( fig. 4a ) are compared between slice 2 and slice 3 .
the average of the three central lung slices ( slices 5 , 6 , and 7 ) over eight time frames during the breath - hold interval are shown in ( fig. 4c ) .
the high signal from the trachea in figure 4c and the corresponding signal - time curves at slice 6 from the roi trachea is shown in figure 4g .
hp 129xe gas arrives in the trachea at ~ 2.0 s and saturates at 6.5 s , corresponding to the signal elevation during the inhalation - period .
hp 129xe gas initially saturates within the trachea following a pattern similar to the signal - time curves of the gas - flow phantom because the speed of gas and gas - flow geometry are comparable to that within the helix tube of the phantom .
following saturation within the trachea , the concentration of hp 129xe gradually increases in the left and right lungs reaching a maximum at 6.5 s. during the breath - hold , hp 129xe signal loss occurs as a function of the number of rf pulses applied from 6.5 s to 11 s. the sudden decrease of the trachea signal corresponds to the exhalation of hp 129xe gas during the exhalation period .
although most of the hp 129xe gas is exhaled during the exhalation period , some residual 129xe gas in the lungs may be detected during the flush - interval as a result of the high temporal resolution and use of high flip angle .
signal - time curves from posterior ( slice 2 ) to anterior ( slice 9 ) lung regions are also shown in figures 4d - h. the flip angles were determined to be 10.2degrees , 8.0degrees , and 8.5degrees for roi - l slices 2 , 6 , and 9 , respectively , with an uncertainty of approximately +/ - 0.5degrees for the first healthy volunteer .

dxev images from a copd subject and corresponding signal - time curves are also shown in figures 5a - d,e - h , respectively .
similar to the healthy subject coronal images , the copd subject coronal images were also averaged over eight time frames during the breath - hold interval as eight data points shown in ( fig. 5g ) .
as expected , image intensity in figures 5a - d is not as homogenous as for a healthy subject ( fig. 4a - d ) .
the signal - time curves in ( fig. 5e - h ) are less repeatable and smooth compared to the signal - time curves from healthy volunteers in figures 4e - h. figure 5 representative coronal dxev images of the first copd patient obtained with the n int = 2 spiral approach ( a ) slice 2 , ( b ) slice 3 , ( c ) average of slices 5 , 6 , and 7 for a full coverage of trachea , and ( d ) slice 9 .

to demonstrate proof - of - concept that dxev imaging is sensitive to signal - time curves , signal - time curves were obtained from three healthy and three copd subjects and compared in table 3 the spearman 's correlation coefficient between roi - l - slice 2 and roi - l - slice 3 , roi - l - slice 5 , roi - l - slice 9 , roi - r - slice 2 , roi - r - slice 3 , roi - r - slice 5 , and roi - r - slice 9 was determined for each subject by controlling for the roi - t ( table 3 ) .
as expected , there is not any statistical difference ( p > 0.05 ) in rho values across the healthy subjects .
a strong correlation was observed between the consecutive image slices ( roi - l - slice 2 and roi - l - slice 3 ) for all three healthy subjects .
the correlation was weakest when posterior regions of left lung ( roi - l - slice 2 ) were compared to anterior regions of the right lung ( roi - r - slice9 ) in all healthy volunteers .
the paired samples t test failed to reveal a statistical difference between the mean rho values from healthy subject and each copd subjects ( p < 0.05 ) .
as expected , the correlations were much weaker in copd subjects compared to the healthy subjects as shown in table 3 .

discussion in this study , the temporal and spatial resolutions of dxev imaging in a gas - flow phantom were investigated using the interleaved spiral k - space sampling approach correlating to the finite element modelling of gas flow .
n int = 2 was found to be the most efficient for capturing the signal - time curves , and has been tested for acquisition of dxev images and signal - time curves in three healthy volunteers and three copd subjects .
the rapid dxev imaging approach with an n int = 2 enables full lung coverage ( 13 coronal slices ) within a very short period ( temporal resolution of 624 ms ) .
because a smaller number of views ( i.e. , two rf pulses ) were used to obtain a single slice image , the n int = 2 approach also enabled the use of a high flip angle (~ 10degrees ) , resulting in sufficient snr during the inhalation and exhalation periods when the concentration of 129xe is low .
therefore , both high temporal resolution and flip angle have allowed measurement of signal - time curves during the entire breathing cycle .
the tradeoff between dxev imaging spatial and temporal resolution , including the dependency of interleave numbers on capturing signal - time curves , was analyzed using the gas - flow phantom .
the simulated cxe curves ( fig. 3a ) with time step size of 0.1s correspond to ideal signal - time curves , which does not include hp gas depolarization and relaxation terms in eq .
( 1 ) .
if the tr was defined to be 0.5 s , comparable to the achievable temporal resolution in multi - slice clinical imaging , and if the depolarization and relaxations were included , the simulated signal - time curves ( fig. 3b ) followed a similar pattern to those of measured signal - time curves ( fig. 3c ) .
because the tube diameter and flow - rate were the same between each roi , the amplitude of signal - time curves from h1 to h5 showed a decreasing trend in relation to the number of rf pulses applied .
therefore , accurately capturing the actual signal - time curves simulated with a temporal resolution of 0.1s depends on the number of rf pulses ( i.e. , sampling approach ) and the mr timing parameters ( tr , t d , tread ) because of the gas inflow effect .
t2 * is assumed to be constant for modelling the gas - flow phantom in eq .
( 1 ) , because the xenon gas is saturated in < 1 s at rois as shown in figure 3a .
however , saturation of xenon gas at rois for those taking longer times may result in significant variations of t2 * .
specifically , these variations of t2 * would be expected to take place during the inhalation period of ~ 3 s and may need to be considered when modelling signal - time curves in human lungs .
there are , however , spatial resolution and susceptibility limitations with spiral interleave k - space sampling that play an important role in capturing the signal - time curves .
although the n int = 1 spiral has a 2 - fold higher temporal resolution , the n int = 2 spiral approach achieves better spatial resolution as shown in the gas - flow phantom images .
in addition , the n int = 2 method confers ~ 30 % reduction in susceptibility and blooming artefacts compared to n int = 1 spiral .
the blooming artefact similar to that reported by saam et al .
20 may have caused the discrepancy between the simulated and experimental signal - time curves h1 in figures 3b,c .
h1 to appear larger in the image ( supporting fig. s1a ; t = 4 s ) but to have lower signal intensity ( h1 on fig. 3c ) and broader fwhm ( h1 on fig. 3f ) compared to other rois .
the source of the susceptibility artefacts was not investigated in this study ; bo distortions have been reported to cause the blooming artefact 47 .
although the n int = 4 and n int = 8 sampling strategies offered better spatial resolution than the n int = 2 approach by ~ 20 % and 30 % , respectively , they were not capable of capturing signal - time curves because of their inherent low temporal resolution .
in principle , the n int = 1 spiral was the best approach for capturing the signal - time curves and correlated most strongly with the simulated signal - time curves .
however , application of n int = 1 spiral under clinical conditions proved challenging and impractical because of the associated susceptibility artefacts and limited spatial resolution .
i and ii interleaves may be reconstructed as separate images to further improve the temporal resolution of the n int = 2 spiral approach by a factor of two , while maintaining the spatial resolution for the reconstruction of i and ii interleaves together 40 .
the temporal resolution of signal - time curves obtained from i and ii interleaves following separate reconstruction were visually comparable to the n int = 1 spiral .
however , signal - time curves were limited by the additional noise caused by image reconstruction artefacts because of the reduced number of k - space points from each of the interleaves .
the relatively lower gyromagnetic ratio and consequently longer t2 * of 129xe gas in vivo allows the number of interleaves to be reduced without encountering significant susceptibility artefacts because of bo distortions that were previously reported to be a considerable limiting factor for dynamic hp 3he - mr ventilation imaging 16 .
spatial susceptibility artefacts were shown to reduce as the number of interleaves was increased to 24 , while maintaining a spatial resolution that is comparable to conventional cartesian k - space sampling .
however , the temporal resolution drops significantly for multi - slice imaging of whole lungs using a multi - interleaved spiral .
for example , for a trmin = 23 ms with a n int = 8 spiral covering 13 coronal slices , the total scan time required per volume would be 2.4 s ( table 1 ) .
this would not provide adequate time to capture a sufficient number of dynamic images during the inhalation and exhalation period , each lasting ~ 3 s. although shorter values of tread per interleaf would enable an increased temporal resolution , this would result in both reduced spatial resolution and snr .
this effect has been previously explained using the concept of point spread function ( psf ) and amplitude loss as a function of tread / t2 * 18 .
as expected , a high number of interleaves ( n = 24 ) requires the use of a low flip angle ( alpha < 5degrees ) for dynamic imaging ( for a set of 32 volume images ) because the total number of rf pulses is expected to be very large ( n = 24 x 32 ) .
the use of a low flip angle ( alpha < 5degrees ) would also particularly limit snr for capturing the signal - time curves where the hp 129xe concentration within the lungs during the inhalation and exhalation - period was very low .
signal - time curves have also been influenced by the subjects' breathing , potential regional differences in oxygen partial pressure and xenon concentration , residence time of the gas , and rf pulse history 15 .
the effects of those changes on signal - time curves are to be investigated and measured in a gas flow phantom in corroboration to the 3d gas flow numerical model in future .
in this study , the feasibility of a hp 129xe rapid multi - slice imaging technique was reported using a spiral k - space sampling approach ignoring the effects of t1 and t2 variations , the variations between oxgen partial pressure and xenon concentration , residence time of the gas , and rf pulse history .
conclusions phantom scans in conjunction with gas - flow modelling were carried out to investigate the optimum number of spiral k - space interleaves to achieve sufficient temporal and spatial resolutions .
the two - interleaved spiral ( n int = 2 ) was found to be the most efficient strategy for capturing the dxev images and signal - time curves .
the successful acquisition of dxev images using n int = 2 spiral k - space sampling approaches has been demonstrated in three healthy and three copd subjects .
the n int = 2 spiral approach provided high temporal resolution ( 624 ms for 13 slices ) and used a high flip angle (~ 10degrees ) , to capture signal - time curves from selected rois .
the signal - time curves were repeatable , smooth , and statistically not different between the heathy volunteer subjects ( p > > 0.05 ) .
the signal - time curves from copd subjects associated with obstructive flow were found to be statistically different ( p < 0.05 ) from the normal signal - time curves in healthy subjects .

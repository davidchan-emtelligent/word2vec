apoptosis mediated by bax or bak is usually thought to be triggered by bh3 - only members of the bcl - 2 protein family .
bh3 - only proteins can directly bind to and activate bax or bak , or indirectly activate them by binding to anti - apoptotic bcl - 2 family members , thereby relieving their inhibition of bax and bak .
here we describe a third way of activation of bax / bak dependent apoptosis that does not require triggering by multiple bh3 - only proteins .
in factor dependent myeloid ( fdm ) cell lines , cycloheximide induced apoptosis by a bax / bak dependent mechanism , because bax - / - bak - / - lines were profoundly resistant , whereas fdm lines lacking one or more genes for bh3 - only proteins remained highly sensitive .
addition of cycloheximide led to the rapid loss of mcl - 1 but did not affect the expression of other bcl - 2 family proteins .
in support of these findings , similar results were observed by treating fdm cells with the cdk inhibitor , roscovitine .
roscovitine reduced mcl - 1 abundance and caused bax / bak dependent cell death , yet fdm lines lacking one or more genes for bh3 - only proteins remained highly sensitive .
therefore bax / bak dependent apoptosis can be regulated by the abundance of anti - apoptotic bcl - 2 family members such as mcl - 1 , independently of several known bh3 - only proteins .

introduction the role of bcl - 2 as an inhibitor of cell death was first established in fdc - p1 cells , an il - 3 dependent mouse myeloid cell line [ 1 ] .
these cells undergo apoptosis when growth factor is removed , but when growth factor was removed from cells over - expressing bcl - 2 , they arrested , but did not die .
similar factor dependent myeloid ( fdm ) cell lines have been generated by infecting murine bone marrow or foetal liver cells with retroviruses expressing hoxb8 , and culturing in il - 3 [ 2 - 5 ] .
fdm lines lacking genes for pro - apoptotic members of the bcl - 2 family , such as the multi - domain proteins ( bax and bak ) , or a number of bh3 - only proteins , have been generated in a similar way by using bone marrow or foetal liver from gene deleted mice .
in this way we have obtained il - 3 dependent myeloid lines lacking genes for bax or bak , bax and bak , blk ( bik ) , puma , noxa , bim , bad , bim , bmf and hrk as well as lines lacking both bim and bad , both bim and bid and both puma and noxa .
all of these cell lines remain dependent on cytokines for growth and proliferation .
cycloheximide ( chx ) is an inhibitor of protein synthesis [ 6 ] .
many cell types rapidly undergo apoptosis when exposed to chx .
in fdc - p1 cells , chx - induced apoptosis is mediated by bax and / or bak because it can be inhibited by over - expression of bcl - 2 [ 7 ] .
bax / bak dependent apoptosis is widely believed to be triggered by bh3 - only proteins and that they have an essential and obligatory role in the activation of bax and / or bak [ 8 , 9 ] .
the bh3 - only members such as bik , bid , bim , bad , puma , noxa , bmf and hrk fall into two classes .
the " direct activators " , such as bid , bim and puma , can bind directly to bak or bax to activate them .
members of the other class , the " indirect activators " , which includes bad , bik , bmf , hrk and noxa , act by binding to anti - apoptotic bcl - 2 family members ( namely mcl - 1 , bcl - 2 , bcl - x , a1 and bcl - w ) and thereby prevent them from inhibiting bax or bax [ 10 ] .
to determine which bh3 - only protein ( s ) were responsible for apoptosis of fdm cells in response to cycloheximide , we compared the sensitivity of cell lines mutant for various pro - apoptotic bcl - 2 family members .
we were surprised to find that none of the lines lacking genes for individual bh3 - only proteins were resistant to chx induced apoptosis , and furthermore , lines lacking both bim and bid , and with undetectable levels of puma [ 4 ] , still underwent apoptosis in response to chx .
collectively these results indicate that chx does not induce fdm cell death by activation of bh3 - only proteins , but that activation of bax / bak and apoptosis in this case is caused by a reduction in the abundance of mcl - 1 .
furthermore , they suggest that loss of one or more pro - survival proteins can be sufficient to permit activation of bax / bak , and that in some circumstances bax and bak can be activated in the absence of bh3 - only proteins involvement .
results initially , a dose - response experiment was performed to determine the concentration of cycloheximide ( chx ) that caused fdm cells to die .
chx induced a dose - dependent decrease in viability of wild - type ( wt ) fdm cells for concentrations above 1 mug / ml with greater than 90 % of cells killed at 20 mug / ml by 24 h ( fig 1a ) .
chx induced cell death by this time point was dependent on the expression of bax or bak because bax / bak deficient fdm cells derived from bax / bak double knockout ( dko ) mice were profoundly resistant to chx treatment ( fig 1a ) .
this resistance was confirmed by treating bax / bak dko cells for 96 hours with chx , at which the majority of the cells were still viable , in contrast to the rapid cell death of the wt cells ( fig 1b ) from these experiments a concentration of 20 mug / ml chx was chosen and was used in all subsequent experiments .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0164003.g001 fig 1 chx induces a time and dose - dependent bax / bak - dependent death in fdm cells .
a ) wt and bax / bak dko cells were treated with chx at the concentrations indicated for 24 h before determining cell viability by pi exclusion and flow cytometry .
bax / bak ( b ) and wt ( c ) cells were treated with 20 mug / ml chx for the times indicated before cell viability was determined .
d ) wt cells were incubated with 20 mug / ml chx for the times indicated before being washed and resuspended in fresh media without chx .
cultures were continued before cell viability was determined at 24 h. data presented are expressed as mean +/ - sem from 3 independent experiments .
next , wt cells were treated with chx for varying times to determine how rapidly it induced cell death .
in this experiment , most of the cells had died by 16 h ( fig 1c ) .
to determine whether the effects of chx treatment were reversible , wt fdm cells were treated for between 2 and 24 h with 20 mug / ml chx , and then washed and resuspended in chx - free media , and their viability was measured at 24 h. as seen in fig 1d , incubating cells for less than 2 - 6 h with chx had only modest effects on cell viability measured at 24 h. however , incubating for more than 8 h caused over half the cells to die by 24 h. collectively , these experiments show that cells treated with chx do not die immediately , but when exposed for greater than 8 - 24 h become irreversibly committed to die by a bax / bak dependent process .
in order to determine the requirement for bh3 - only proteins in the activation of bax / bak in this system , we examined the ability of chx to induce death of fdm cell lines derived from mice in which the genes encoding various bh3 - only proteins were deleted .
consistent with the previous results , two independent wt clones of fdm cells were highly sensitive to chx , with a significant loss in viability observed at 24 h post - treatment ( fig 2a ) .
again bax / bak dko cells were highly resistant to chx treatment .
next , fdm cells bearing gene deletions for a single bh3 - only protein were examined for their sensitivity to chx treatment .
remarkably , none of the bh3 - only single knockout ( sko ) cell lines examined exhibited any resistance towards chx ( fig 2b ) .
one of the bid knockout cell lines , bid 1 , showed slightly increased resistance to chx - induced toxicity yet the other bid - / - clone , bid 2 , did not exhibit the same insensitivity .
this suggests that the slight resistance in the bid 1 line is due to clonal variation .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0164003.g002 fig 2 chx induces death in fdm cells independently of several known bh3 - only proteins .
viability of ( a ) wt and bax / bak dko , ( b ) single bh3 - only knockout and ( c ) bh3 - only dko fdm cell lines were determined after 24 h of treatment with 20 mug / ml chx .
( d ) wt , bax / bak and bh3 - only knockout cells were treated with 20 mug / ml chx for the times indicated before cell viability was determined .
data shown is expressed as mean +/ - sem from 3 independent experiments .
the numbers after a cell line 's name refer to independent clonal lines of the same genotype .
next , clones of fdm dko cells containing combinations of bh3 - only protein gene deletions were examined for their sensitivity to chx .
similar to the sko results , none of the dko cells lines examined exhibited any protection towards chx - induced cell death ( fig 2c ) .
it is also worth noting that despite the bid 1 cells exhibiting a slight resistance to chx ( fig 2b ) , neither of the bid / bim dko cell lines showed a similar resistance ( fig 2c ) , further suggesting that the slight resistance observed with bid 1 cells is due to clonal variation .
to rule out the possibility that cell lines lacking bh3 - only proteins might show resistance to chx at earlier time points , we performed a time - course experiment using several knockout cell lines .
consistent with previous data , bax / bak dko lines showed profound resistance to chx ( fig 2d ) .
in contrast , the bad , puma , bim and blk sko lines as well as the bid / bim dko cells lost viability at similar rates to that of wt cells following chx addition .
although our entire panel of cell lines was not tested , these results suggest that the absence of one of more bh3 - only proteins does not prevent or delay activation of bax / bak dependent cell death even at early times following chx treatment .
the uptake of pi into dead or dying cells due to membrane damage is a relatively late event in the apoptotic process .
since the effects of chx that resulted in cell death occurred between 8 - 16 h of treatment ( fig 1b ) , we looked for changes that might lead to activation of bax or bak within 8 h of chx addition .
because the results in fig 2 argued that none of the members of the bh3 - only protein family examined were essential for activation of bax or bak , we looked to see whether addition of chx might trigger apoptosis by causing a reduction in the levels of an anti - apoptotic bcl - 2 family member .
we determined the effect of chx on the levels of the bcl - 2 pro - survival family members in both wt and bax / bak dko cells ( fig 3 ) .
the advantage afforded by the bax / bak dko cells is that changes in protein expression can be determined without confounding effects of cell death , such as caspase activation , which occurred in the wt cells .
levels of bcl - 2 , bcl - xl and bcl - w proteins were not affected by chx in either wt or bax / bak dko cells within the 8 h time course , indicating these are stable proteins with long half - lives ( fig 3a ) .
quantification data is of levels of pro - survival proteins in bax / bak dko cells after addition of chx , only showing the larger , transient band of mcl - 1 .
a1 was not detected in these cells .
unlike the other pro - survival proteins , the abundance of mcl - 1 rapidly decreased in both wt and bax / bak dko fdm lines .
mcl - 1 exists as a doublet , with the smaller band being a more stable form in which the n - terminal tail has been truncated [ 11 , 12 ] .
however , the larger band has a shorter half - life , and in wt cells , this form of mcl - 1 fell to barely detectable levels within 2 h of chx treatment .
in bax / bak dko cells , the abundance of mcl - 1 in untreated cells was much higher than in the wt cells , but the addition of chx caused a rapid decrease in levels of the unstable form of mcl - 1 such that it was barely detectable within 4 - 8 h of treatment .
these results suggest that loss of mcl - 1 may be responsible for bax / bak activation following chx addition .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0164003.g003 fig 3 chx induces the proteasomal loss of mcl - 1 , but not other pro - survival bcl - 2 family proteins .
a ) lysates of wt and bax / bak dko cells treated with 20 mug / ml chx for 0 - 8 h were separated by sds - page , transferred to membranes and immunoblotted with antibodies to mcl - 1 , bcl - 2 , bcl - xl and bcl - w .
293t cells transiently expressing mouse bcl - xl , and fdcp1 cells expressing bcl - w , were used as positive controls for the bcl - xl and bcl - w antibodies .
beta - actin was used a loading control .
b ) densitometry analysis of western blots probed with pro - survival proteins , normalized to 0h timepoint .
mcl - 1 densitometry refers only to the transient form of the protein , in bax / bak dko cells .
results are representative of three independent experiments .
c ) wt and bax / bak dko cells were pre - incubated with or without 20 mum mg132 before being treated with or without 20 mug / ml chx as indicated .
cell lysates were immunoblotted for mcl - 1 and beta - actin as shown .
asterisks indicate cleavage products of mcl - 1 and cross - reactive species .
to examine whether the loss of mcl - 1 in the presence of chx was mediated by the proteasome , wt and bax / bak dko cells were treated with chx for 4 h with or without a 1 h pre - incubation with the proteasome inhibitor , mg132 .
treatment of both cell lines with mg132 caused an increase in the levels of mcl - 1 , indicating that its abundance in resting cells is limited by turnover within the proteasome ( fig 3c ) .
consistent with the previous results , addition of chx alone led to the complete loss of the unstable form of mcl - 1 within 4 hours .
significantly , pre - treatment of cells with mg132 prevented the loss of mcl - 1 , indicating that normal proteasomal turnover of mcl - 1 accounts for the loss of mcl - 1 following inhibition of protein synthesis with chx .
as mg132 prevented degradation of mcl - 1 following the addition of chx , we then examined whether mg132 could prevent chx - induced cell death in wild - type fdm cells .
unfortunately , treatment with low concentrations of mg132 were highly toxic to the fdm cells , thus this possibility could not be examined in these cells .
the loss of mcl - 1 following chx treatment suggests that another means of reducing mcl - 1 might also initiate cell death in a bh3 - independent manner , similar to chx .
roscovitine , a cdk inhibitor , has been shown to inhibit mcl - 1 transcription [ 13 ] .
consistent with this , the treatment of fdm cells with roscovitine results in the rapid loss of mcl - 1 ( fig 4a ) .
to investigate its effects on viability , cells were then treated with increasing concentrations of roscovitine , which induced profound cell death in a bax / bak dependent manner since bax / bak dko cells were highly resistant to its effects ( fig 4b ) .
next we tested our panel of fdm knockout cell lines with roscovitine , and consistent with out chx data , none of the bh3 - only knockout cell lines showed any significant protection against roscovitine ( fig 4c ) .
these results suggest that , like chx - induced cell death , the bh3 - only proteins are not involved in the initiation of roscovitine - induced fdm cell death but rather it is the loss of mcl - 1 that triggers activation of cell death .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0164003.g004 fig 4 roscovitine reduces levels of mcl - 1 and induces death in fdm cells independently of bh3 - only proteins .
a ) lysates of wt and baax / bak dko fdm cells treated with roscovitine ( 30 mum ) for the indicated times were separated by sds - page , transferred to membrane and immunoblotted with the mcl - 1 .
beta - actin was used a loading control .
b ) wt cells were treated with increasing concentrations of roscovitine before cell viability was determined .
c ) wt , bax / bak and bh3 - only knockout cells were treated with 30 mug / ml roscovitine for 24 h before cell viability was determined .
data shown is expressed as mean +/ - sem from 3 independent experiments .
the numbers after a cell line 's name refer to independent clonal lines of the same genotype .
as with addition of chx , withdrawal of il - 3 from the culture media of wt fdm cells causes a loss of viability over 48 h , whereas bax / bak dko cells are completely resistant to this apoptotic stimulus ( fig 5a ) [ 2 ] .
in order to determine whether withdrawal of il - 3 also caused a reduction in mcl - 1 , we examined its abundance in lysates of cells at 24 and 48 h after il - 3 withdrawal .
mcl - 1 was not detected in wt cells 24 h after il - 3 removal ( fig 5b ) , but its absence might have been a consequence of cell death , or a cause , or both .
in bax / bak dko cells , mcl - 1 levels were reduced , but by a lesser extent , and it was still detectable even at 48 h following il - 3 withdrawal ( fig 5b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0164003.g005 fig 5 il - 3 withdrawal reduces mcl - 1 abundance .
a ) wt and bax / bak dko cells were washed and incubated in media without il - 3 .
cell viability was determined at 24 and 48 h after il - 3 removal .
data shown are from a single experiment .
b ) cell lysates were prepared at 0 , 24 and 48 h following il - 3 withdrawal and immunoblotted for mcl - 1 and beta - actin as shown .
to confirm that lack of mcl - 1 was responsible for the death of chx treated fdm cells , we tested whether over - expression of mcl - 1 from a 4ht - inducible construct was sufficient to prevent their death .
two independent clones of wt fdm cells were generated that each expressed either mcl - 1 or bcl - 2 following exposure to 4ht ( fig 6a ) .
both inducible clones expressed similar levels of bcl - 2 , but the mcl - 1 clone 2 cells expressed more mcl - 1 than clone 1 cells .
the over - expression of mcl - 1 had only a modest protective effect and was less effective than bcl - 2 over - expression in preventing chx - induced cell death ( fig 6b ) .
these results indicate that the over - expression of mcl - 1 or bcl - 2 can at least partially prevent the effect of chx - triggered cell death .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0164003.g006 fig 6 mcl - 1 over - expression gives partial protection to wild - type cells from chx - induced cell death .
a ) clones of wt fdm cells bearing inducible mcl - 1 or bcl - 2 expression constructs were treated for 24 h with or without 100 nm 4ht to induce mcl - 1 or bcl - 2 .
cell lysates were prepared and immunoblotted with anti - mcl - 1 , anti - flag ( to detect flag - bcl - 2 ) or beta - actin as indicated .
b ) the same cells as in ( a ) were treated with 100 nm 4ht for 24 h before being culture in the presence or absence of 20 mug / ml chx for a further 24 h before cell viabilities were determined by pi exclusion and flow cytometry .
data shown is expressed as mean +/ - sem from 3 independent experiments .
the numbers after a cell line 's name refer to independent clonal lines of the same genotype .
these results indicate that cell death following addition of chx is dependent on either bax or bak .
to determine which of these proteins played the greater role , we generated fdm cells from mice in which the genes for either bax or bak were deleted .
consistent with previous results all four independent wt fdm cell lines were highly sensitive to chx , with a significant loss in viability observed after 24 h treatment ( fig 7 ) .
again both bax / bak dko cell lines were resistant to chx treatment .
interestingly , bax sko cells were as sensitive to chx treatment as wt cells .
however , bak sko cells showed marked resistance to chx induced cell death , with 60 % of cells remaining viable after 24 h chx treatment .
these results indicate that bak , rather than bax , plays the major role in fmd cell death following chx treatment .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0164003.g007 fig 7 bak deficient fdm cells are resistant to chx - induced apoptosis .
cell viabilities of wt , bax / bak dko , and bax and bak sko fdm cell lines were determined after 24 h of treatment with 20 mug / ml chx .
data shown is expressed as mean +/ - sem from 3 independent experiments .
the numbers after a cell line 's name refer to independent clonal lines of the same genotype .
to further test the dependence of the fdm cells on mcl - 1 , we determined the effect of antagonizing mcl - 1 by inducing expression of the engineered bh3 - only protein , bims2a , which is highly selective for mcl - 1 [ 14 ] .
the addition of 4ht to bax / bak dko cells bearing a 4ht - inducible construct resulted in a robust expression of the bims2a peptide ( fig 8a ) yet , as expected , it was unable to trigger death in these cells ( fig 8b ) .
in contrast induction of bims2a in wt cells caused all the cells to die , indicating that the functional inactivation of mcl - 1 is sufficient to induce fdm cell death .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0164003.g008 fig 8 bims2a induces efficient cell death in wild - type fdm cells .
a ) inducible bax / bak dko fdm cells were treated for 24 h with or without 100 nm 4ht to induce bims2a expression as indicated .
cell lysates were prepared and immunoblotted with anti - flag to detect flag - bims2a or beta - actin as indicated .
b ) inducible wt and bax / bak dko fdm cells were treated with or without 100 nm 4ht to induce bims2a expression as indicated .
cell viabilities were determined 24 h after the addition of 4ht .
data shown is expressed as mean +/ - sem from 3 independent experiments .
discussion it has generally been assumed that initiation of bax / bak dependent apoptosis requires the production or activation of one of more of the bh3 - only members of the bcl - 2 family [ 10 ] .
the activation of bh3 - only proteins has been shown to occur via transcriptional or post - translational mechanisms in response to a number of external and intracellular signals .
for example , dna damage can promote stabilization of p53 , which directly transactivates the puma locus [ 15 - 17 ] , bid can be activated by proteolytic cleavage [ 18 ] , and bim can be regulated by phosphorylation [ 19 - 22 ] .
once active bh3 - only proteins are produced , they are believed to trigger bax and bak in either of two ways .
the " direct activators " such as bim , puma and bid can directly bind to bax and / or bak and cause them to form multimers in the mitochondrial outer membrane that allow exit of proteins including cytochrome c. alternatively , the " indirect activators " such as bad , hrk , bmf , and bik bind to the anti - apoptotic bcl - 2 family members , and thereby prevent them from binding to and inhibiting bax and bak , and perhaps also by displacing bim , puma or bid from the anti - apoptotic bcl - 2 family members so they are free to activate bax or bak. by either of these scenarios it is widely assumed that the bh3 - only proteins perform an obligatory role in bax / bak activation [ 8 , 10 ] .
consistent with this , mice deficient in bim , bid and puma phenotypically resemble bax / bak dko mice , suggesting they are essential for bax / bak activation [ 9 ] .
here we provide evidence that apoptosis can be triggered in another way , in the absence of bh3 - only proteins blk , bad , hrk , or noxa , and in cells where none of the known direct activator bh3 - only proteins ( bid , bim , puma ) are present at detectable levels .
our results in il - 3 dependent myeloid lines suggest that without triggering by bh3 - only proteins , bax and bak can spontaneously activate when levels of anti - apoptotic bcl - 2 family proteins decline .
consistent with our findings , muer et al. reported that expression of p14arf could induce bak dependent apoptosis of du145 prostate carcinoma cells by down regulation of mcl - 1 and bcl - xl without the activation of bh3 - only proteins [ 23 ] .
similarly , chen and colleagues showed in mefs that bax and bak auto - activated in the absence of bh3 - only proteins when bcl - 2 , bcl - xl and mcl - 1 levels decreased following treatment with etoposide [ 24 ] .
moreover , in a tour de force involving simultaneous mutation of the genes for eight bh3 - only proteins , five anti - apoptotic bcl - 2 family proteins , as well as bax and bak in hct116 colorectal carcinoma cells , o'neill et al. showed that bax or bak are able to associate with the outer mitochondrial membrane , activate , and cause apoptosis spontaneously , without being activated by any bh3 - only protein [ 25 ] .
chx - induced death of mouse fdm cells required bax and / or bak , because cells lacking both bax and bak were profoundly resistant to chx ( although even bax / bak dko fdm cells do eventually die if chx is never removed from their media ) .
cells deficient in bak only were highly resistant to chx - induced apoptosis , but not as resistant as bax / bak deficient cells .
in contrast , bax deficient fdm cells were as sensitive to the effects of chx as wt cells .
these results indicate that chx - triggered apoptosis of these cells is predominantly mediated by bak , and in its absence bax can only induce limited amounts of cell death .
these results are consistent with studies using baby mouse kidney ( bmk ) cells , and cells that lacked bax and bak [ 26 ] , which were also highly resistant to chx .
interestingly , bax deficient bmk cells that retained one allele of bak were as sensitive to chx as wt cells , yet bak deficient cells that retained one copy of bax were as resistant to chx as cells that lacked both bax and bak [ 26 ] indicating that bak is the main mediator of death in these cells , as it was in the fdms .
the common requirement for bak in chx - induced death in both fdm and bmk cells suggested that a similar mode of activation might occur in the two cell types .
however , bmk cells that lacked blk ( bik in humans ) were also highly resistant to chx indicating blk is required for bak activation in these cells [ 26 ] .
a similar essential requirement for bim in chx - induced death has also been demonstrated in hela cells [ 27 ] .
in contrast to these studies none of the bh3 - only proteins were found to be necessary for chx - induced fdm cell death .
none of the sko lines that lacked a single member of the bh3 - only family exhibited any resistance towards chx .
similarly , none of the dko lines that were deficient in bad / bim , bid / bim or puma / noxa displayed any resistance towards chx .
complementing these findings , roscovitine also lead to cell death in a bax / bak dependent manner , resulted in the loss of mcl - 1 , and the bh3 - only sko and dko cell lines did not show any protection against cell death .
using this eukaryotic model , it was not possible to knockout all the bh3 - only proteins simultaneously , however the sko and dko lines tested do indicate that chx is not inducing cell death through any single known bh3 - only protein .
furthermore , the presence of chx would prevent the synthesis of new bh3 - only proteins ( such as puma or noxa ) to activate bak to cause cell death .
this finding supports a model in which several known bh3 - only proteins are not involved in chx - induced fdm cell death .
this finding is further supported by our results using roscovitine which , like chx , caused loss of mcl - 1 and induced bax / bak dependent cell death .
moreover , the finding that none of the bh3 - only knockout cell lines provided protection to roscovitine treatment suggests that known bh3 - only proteins are also not involved in roscovitine - induced fdm cell death .
our results suggest that as mcl - 1 levels decline , bax / bak can activate spontaneously , without being activated by a ' direct ' activator bh3 - only protein , such as bim , puma or bid .
while it has been reported that over - expression of bax or bak in yeasts and mammalian cells can lead to their spontaneous activation [ 28 - 30 ] , in our experiments bax and bak existed at their physiological levels .
mcl - 1 is unique among members of the bcl - 2 pro - survival family in that it is rapidly turned over by the action of ubiquitin ligases ( such as mule ) [ 31 - 33 ] and can be stabilised by the action of deubiquitinases ( e.g. usp9x ) [ 34 ] .
consistent with this , mcl - 1 abundance was rapidly decreased to barely detectable levels in fdm cells within 4 h of chx addition , whereas none of the other bcl - 2 family members showed any appreciable decrease over the time - course examined .
furthermore , the treatment with the proteasome inhibitor , mg132 , increased abundance of mcl - 1 in resting cells and prevented the loss of mcl - 1 following chx addition .
thus the normal proteasomal turnover of mcl - 1 can account for the loss of mcl - 1 following inhibition of protein synthesis with chx .
bak is predominantly inhibited by the actions of mcl - 1 and bcl - xl and not other pro - survival family members [ 26 , 35 ] .
thus mcl - 1 loss in fdm cells following protein synthesis inhibition is consistent with the observed requirement of bak to mediate chx - induced cell death .
however , it is worth noting the bak deficient fdm cells were not completely resistant to chx like bax / bak deficient cells .
over - expression of mcl - 1 and bcl - 2 both increased cell survival after chx - treatment .
since mcl - 1 is rapidly turned over , its over - expression did not raise its levels as much as over - expression of bcl - 2 , which is more stable , and hence over - expression of bcl - 2 gave a greater level of protection ( fig 6 ) .
loss of mcl - 1 has been observed previously in hela cells [ 27 ] and in other cell types including leukemic cells and fibroblasts [ 36 ] following inhibition of protein synthesis .
however , in contrast to the results here , it was concluded in these studies that mcl - 1 loss was not the sole event to trigger cell death [ 27 , 36 ] .
indeed , in hela cells bim was also required for chx - induced cell death [ 27 ] and bim can inhibit all pro - survival family proteins [ 37 ] .
furthermore , in chx treatment of bmk cells it was shown that blk was required to antagonise the functions of mcl - 1 and bcl - xl to cause death [ 26 ] .
the results presented here are consistent with a model in which a decline in mcl - 1 levels is the key event leading to bak activation and cell death following protein synthesis inhibition .
this model predicts that the specific inactivation of mcl - 1 should be sufficient to cause cell death .
in support of this the over - expression of bims2a , which specifically binds and inhibits the function of mcl - 1 , efficiently induced cell death in wt but not bax / bak deficient fdm cells .
in conclusion none of the tested bh3 - only proteins were found to be required for chx - induced or roscovitine - induced fdm cell death .
rather the loss of mcl - 1 was the key event leading to bak activation and cell death .
the results of this study are consistent with a model in which there is no obligatory requirement for the direct activation of bak by several known bh3 - only proteins in chx - induced apoptosis in fdm cells .

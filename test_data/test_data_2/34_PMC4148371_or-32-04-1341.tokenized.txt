phloroglucinol is a polyphenolic compound that is used to treat and prevent several human diseases , as it exerts beneficial biological activities , including anti - oxidant , anti - inflammatory and anticancer properties .
the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of phloroglucinol on apoptotic signaling pathways in ht - 29 colon cancer cells .
the results indicated that phloroglucinol suppressed cell viability and induced apoptosis in ht - 29 cells in a concentration - dependent manner .
phloroglucinol treatment of ht - 29 cells resulted in characteristic apoptosis - related changes : altered bcl - 2 family proteins , cytochrome c release , and activation of caspase - 3 and caspase - 8 .
this study also showed that proteins involved in apoptosis were stimulated by treatment with phloroglucinol .
these findings demonstrated that phloroglucinol exerts anticancer activity in ht - 29 colon cancer cells through induction of apoptosis .
apoptosis ht - 29 cells phloroglucinol introduction colorectal carcinoma is a leading cause of cancer - related mortality worldwide ( 1 ) .
at present , radiotherapy or chemotherapy using cytotoxic drugs is the major method of cancer treatment , and many anticancer drugs have been applied clinically for colon cancer ( 2,3 ) .
however , due to increased concerns in regards to the side effects and drug resistance associated with current treatments , an ongoing search for natural antitumor therapies is underway ( 4,5 ) .
more effective drugs to treat colorectal carcinoma are necessary , and the development of natural therapeutics into potential anticancer agents is possible ( 6 ) .
in the past few decades , natural bioactive substances found in products were considered to be important antitumor drug sources .
marine seaweeds are widely used as a source of medicine and have attracted attention due to their minimal toxicity ( 7 ) .
recent studies have demonstrated that the structural variety of phloroglucinol isolated from ecklonia cava induces pharmacological activities by inhibiting apoptosis and protecting cells against oxidative stress .
a number of studies showed that ecklonia cava consists of many effective components ( 8 ) .
in particular , phloroglucinol is cytotoxic to breast cancer cells and has been studied to determine its pharmacological and immunological effects ( 9 ) .
however , the biological activities of phloroglucinol have yet to be fully elucidated .
thus , we selected phloroglucinol among many types of compounds , and evaluated the antitumor effects of phloroglucinol in colon cancer cells .
apoptosis is the key to the normal growth and differentiation of diverse tissues .
thus , maintaining homeostasis in normal tissues requires a balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis .
apoptosis is a regulated and complex process leading to cell death characterized by nuclear fragmentation , chromatin condensation , membrane blebbing and cell shrinkage , which eliminates cancer cells without damaging surrounding tissues ( 10,11 ) .
antitumorigenic agents induce apoptosis - related signaling in cancer cells while differentiation and development of cell tissues ( 12 ) .
two major apoptosis signaling pathways caused by caspase activation fundamentally lead to apoptosis : an extrinsic pathway ( death receptors ) and an intrinsic pathway ( mitochondrial ) ( 13,14 ) .
apoptosis regulated by the mitochondrial pathway , which involves molecules such as bcl - 2 family members , leads to the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol ( 15 ) .
the present study was performed to confirm that phloroglucinol inhibits the growth of ht - 29 colon cancer cells and to determine the molecular mechanism of its anticancer effect by investigating apoptosis signaling pathways .
our findings suggest that phloroglucinol affects fas - induced apoptosis , a potential factor in colon cancer prevention .
materials and methods cell culture human colon cancer cells ( atcc htb - 38 ) and rat small intestine epithelial cells ( iec - 6 , atcc crl - 1592 ) were purchased from the american type culture collection ( atcc ; rockville , md , usa ) .

dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) was supplemented with penicillin / streptomycin ( p / s ) , and ht - 29 and iec - 6 cell cultures were supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ; hyclone , inc. , south logan , ut , usa ) .
cells were cultured to 80 % confluency in 100 - mm dishes .
the medium was replaced every 2 days .
cell viability phloroglucinol was obtained from sigma - aldrich ( st. louis , mo , usa ) .
the effects of diverse phloroglucinol concentrations on cellular proliferation of ht - 29 and iec - 6 cells were examined colorimetrically after 24 h using the 3 - ( 4,5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 5 - ( 3 - carboxymethoxy - phenyl ) - 2 - ( 4 - sulfophenyl ) - 2h - tetrazolium ( mts ) assay with cell titer 96 ( r ) aqueous one solution reagent ( promega , madison , wi , usa ) .
to confirm viability , cells were seeded onto 96 - well plates at 2x104 cells / well in 100 mul medium and incubated for 24 h. attached cells were maintained in serum - free medium ( sfm ) for 12 h , after which the medium was replaced with sfm containing phloroglucinol ( 0 - 50 mug / ml ) for another 24 h. cells were then incubated with mts solution at 37degreesc for 30 - 60 min , and the absorbance of the solution in each well was measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader ( benchmark microplate reader ; bio - rad laboratories , hercules , ca , usa ) .

results phloroglucinol inhibits proliferation of the ht - 29 cells in preliminary studies , we determined the effects of phloroglucinol treatment ( 0 , 12.5 , 25 and 50 mug / ml ) on ht - 29 colon cancer cells using the mts assay ( fig. 1 ) .
our data showed that phloroglucinol treatment decreased ht - 29 cell proliferation in a concentration - dependent manner .
in comparison with the control , 50 mug / ml phloroglucinol for 24 h inhibited cell viability by 60 % .
in contrast , iec - 6 cells were unaffected by the phloroglucinol treatment .
phloroglucinol induces morphological changes in the ht - 29 cells since phloroglucinol significantly reduced ht - 29 cell viability , we used these concentrations to determine morphological changes using light microscopy ( fig. 2 ) .
we found that phloroglucinol decreased cell growth as well as cell size in a concentration - dependent manner .
phloroglucinol increases the rate of cellular apoptosis in a concentration - dependent manner as revealed by the annexin v assay colon cancer ht - 29 cells were treated with phloroglucinol ( 0 , 12.5 , 25 and 50 mug / ml ) , and then the percentages of necrotic and apoptotic cells were evaluated by staining with 7 - aminoactinomycin d ( 7 - add ) and annexin v. in each analysis , non - apoptotic viable cells showed negative staining with annexin v and 7 - aad .
during early apoptosis , cells were annexin v - positive and 7 - aad - negative ; during late apoptosis , cells were annexin v - positive and 7 - aad - positive .
mechanically injured cells were annexin v - negative and 7 - aad - positive .
in the present study , phloroglucinol treatment of ht - 29 cells increased the percentage of apoptotic cells in a concentration - dependent manner .
untreated cell populations contained 87.28 % living cells and 3.7 % necrotic cells .
treatment with phloroglucinol ( 12.5 , 25 or 50 mug / ml ) for 24 h resulted in 10.31 , 17.77 and 24.11 % apoptotic cells , respectively ( fig. 3 ) .
phloroglucinol induces the expression of apoptosis regulatory proteins the multifactorial process of apoptosis is triggered by two main pathways ( 16 ) .
as shown in fig. 4 , we focused on the extrinsic pathway mediated by fas .
this pathway is regulated by activation of tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) receptors and cell surface death receptors , such as fas ( cd95 , apo - 1 ) ( 17 ) .
the fas signaling pathway upregulates downstream signal transduction , including members of the caspase family .
subsequently , apoptotic substrates are cleaved , including poly ( adp - ribose ) polymerase ( parp ) ( 18 ) .
in the present study , phloroglucinol treatment increased the expression of fas and fadd and cleaved parp , caspase - 3 , - 8 and - 9 ( fig. 4 ) .
these findings indicate that phloroglucinol induces apoptosis through the fas signaling pathway .
phloroglucinol induces activation of caspase - 3 and caspase - 8 to confirm which caspases are involved in phloroglucinol - induced apoptosis , caspase inhibitors were evaluated .
our results demonstrated that caspase - 3 and - 8 inhibitors potently repressed phloroglucinol - induced apoptosis ( fig. 5 ) .
these results indicate that caspase - 3 and caspase - 8 activation are involved in phloroglucinol - induced apoptosis .
phloroglucinol induces mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation and cytochrome c release the mitochondria - related pathway is a significant apoptotic pathway characterized by cytochrome c release from the mitochondria into the cytosol and by disorganized mitochondrial transmembrane potential ( 19 ) .
in addition , the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway commonly involves bcl - 2 family proteins .
variations in the proportion of these members affect the life or death of cells ( 20 ) .
in order to determine whether cytochrome c release is enhanced in phloroglucinol - treated ht - 29 cells , we analyzed the cytosolic expression levels of cytochrome c and bcl - 2 family proteins .
levels of bcl - xl and bcl - 2 expression were simultaneously suppressed ( fig. 6a ) ; conversely , levels of bax , bad , and bid expression were increased .
subsequently , the expression levels of cytochrome c and apoptotic protease activating factor - 1 ( apaf - 1 ) in the cytosol were also increased ( fig. 6b ) .
these results indicate that collaboration among the bcl - 2 family proteins was involved in mitochondrial change during the advancement of apoptosis by phloroglucinol .
discussion apoptosis is an essential process involved in homeostasis and maintenance of multicellular organisms by extirpating superfluous cells ( 21 ) .
furthermore , induction of apoptosis is critical to remedy cancer ( 22 ) .
in this study , we investigated the interaction between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis induced by phloroglucinol in human colon cancer ht - 29 cells .
we determined that phloroglucinol inhibits cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis : we observed altered cellular morphology ( whole cell numbers and cell size were reduced in a density - dependent manner ) following changes in the levels of pro - apoptotic and anti - apoptotic proteins and caspase activation .
moreover , we also showed evidence that the cell apoptosis ratio increased following treatment with high phloroglucinol concentrations .
the death receptor - mediated pathway is triggered by fasl and its receptor fadd ( 23,24 ) .
fadd then induces caspase - 8 via interaction with death effector regions , leading to activation of caspase - 8 and the apoptotic protease cascade via effector caspase activation ( 25,26 ) .
in this study , phloroglucinol increased the extrinsic signaling protein expression levels of fas , fadd and caspase - 8 .
caspases , which are cysteine proteases , play an important role in regulating the apoptotic response ( 27 ) .
activation of apoptotic signaling pathways results in cytochrome c release from the mitochondria in concert with cleavage and activation of caspase - 9 , which in turn also induces caspase - 3 activation ( 28,29 ) .
in the present study , we found that phloroglucinol - induced ht - 29 cell apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase - 3 , - 8 and - 9 .
moreover , cell apoptosis is modulated by bcl - 2 family members , which negatively or positively regulate apoptosis .
anti - apoptotic bcl - 2 and bcl - xl proteins are able to intercept diverse apoptotic signals , whereas pro - apoptotic proteins , such as bax and bad , can cause the release of apoptosis palpating factors into the cytoplasm ( 30,31 ) .
our data showed that phloroglucinol induced a decrease in bcl - 2 and bcl - xl expression and an increase in bax and bad expression .
this alteration may trigger the release of cytochrome c and apaf - 1 into the cytosol and the cleavage of poly ( adp - ribose ) polymerase ( 32 ) .
in this study , the release of apoptosis - promoting factors such as cytosolic cytochrome c and apaf - 1 was increased following phloroglucinol treatment .
therefore , these findings suggest that phloroglucinol induces apoptosis through mitochondrial dysfunction by modulating the protein levels of bcl - 2 family members .
these findings may aid in the understanding of the mechanism underlying induction of apoptosis by phloroglucinol in carcinoma cells .
in conclusion , our study demonstrated that phloroglucinol significantly inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of ht - 29 colon cancer cells via both the extrinsic and intrinsic cell death signaling pathways .
this research provides a mechanism for the antitumorigenic activity of phloroglucinol .
in the apoptotic process , phloroglucinol upregulated pro - apoptotic and downregulated anti - apoptotic proteins , followed by caspase activation .
our results partially explain the effect of phloroglucinol on ht - 29 colon cancer cell apoptosis .
although a fully detailed mechanism is not clear , phloroglucinol could be used as a potential therapeutic candidate in the prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer in the future .

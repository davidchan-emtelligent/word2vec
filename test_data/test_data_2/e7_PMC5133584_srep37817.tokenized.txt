the present study compared the incidence of hospitalization , morbidity , and mortality in patients with sle between cohorts with and without influenza vaccination .
we used the taiwan 's insurance claims data between 2001 and 2012 for identifying annual adult patients with sle with ( n = 1765 ) and without ( n = 8360 ) influenza vaccination .
the incidence rate ratio and hazard ratio ( hr ) for morbidities and mortality were measured for the vaccine and nonvaccine cohorts .
the vaccine cohort had a lower hospitalization rate than did the nonvaccine cohort , with an adjusted hr of 0.82 ( 95 % ci 0.73 - 0.92 ) .
furthermore , the vaccine cohort was less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit [ adjusted hr 0.55 ( 95 % ci 0.39 - 0.79 )] , to be hospitalized for septicemia , bacteremia , or viremia [ adjusted hr 0.48 ( 95 % ci 0.32 - 0.73 )] , to undergo in - hospital dialysis [ adjusted hr 0.40 ( 95 % ci 0.20 - 0.81 )] , and were less predisposed to death [ adjusted hr 0.41 ( 95 % ci 0.27 - 0.61 )] .
in conclusion , influenza vaccination in patients with sle is associated with a reduced risk of morbidity and mortality .
systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) is an autoimmune disease characterized by relapse and remittance .
at least 50 % of the patients experience one episode of severe infection caused by common or opportunistic microorganisms12 .
infections cause 20 - 55 % deaths in patients with sle3 .
influenza , one of the most frequent infections , is estimated to annually infect 5 % of the adult population4 .
in the unites states , influenza causes more than 225,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths annually56 .
morbidity and mortality caused by influenza increase in elderly people , immunocompromised patients , and patients with chronic diseases7 .
vaccination substantially aids in preventing influenza - related morbidity and mortality and is recommended for immunocompromised patients8 .
because influenza vaccination does not induce disease activity in sle , annual influenza vaccination for patients with sle is highly recommended910 .
however , whether vaccination is effective in patients with sle is unclear , as patients with sle have decreased primary and secondary immune responses11 .
moreover , immunosuppressive drugs may further decrease immune response following vaccination .
studies on the effect of influenza vaccination on patients with sle121314151617181920 have suggested the safety of vaccination but with reduced immunogenicity , which is attributed to the immunosuppressive therapy .
holvast et al. reported a decreased antibody response in patients with sle .
seroprotection ( titre >= 40 ) rates were lower in patients with sle than in healthy adults , limiting clinical protection from influenza in some vaccinated patients10. by contrast , kanakoudi et al. reported normal efficacy levels of vaccination21 .
furthermore , whether vaccination in patients with sle protects them throughout the influenza season , that is , whether protective antiinfluenza titres increased following vaccination , is clinically relevant but unclear .
studies assessing the clinical efficacy of the influenza vaccination on patients with sle are lacking .
therefore , this study evaluated the efficacy of influenza vaccination for reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with sle through a population - based cohort study .
methods data source the study utilized the national health insurance research database ( nhird ) of taiwan , which records inpatient and ambulatory care claims from 2001 to 2012 .
the national health insurance ( nhi ) program of the bureau of national health insurance ( bnhi ) covers > 98 % of the taiwanese population .
it utilizes a comprehensive and computerized database that records all medical claims for ambulatory care services and hospitalization , facilitating a nationwide population - based cohort study .
the bnhi routinely validates diagnoses by reviewing the original medical charts of patients .
the nhird has established a registry system for catastrophic illnesses , including sle .
the completeness and accuracy of the nhi claims databases have been assured by the aforementioned agencies .
the study was approved by the institutional review board of taipei medical university ( approval number : n201509007 ) .
the study was carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines .
informed consent of the study participants was not required because the dataset used in this study consists of de - identified secondary data released for research purposes .
retrospective cohort study this is a retrospective cohort study that used the national database in taiwan .
all patients with sle , identified using the international classification of diseases , ninth revision , clinical modification ( icd9 - cm ) code 710.0 for catastrophic illnesses , in the registry during 2001 - 2011 were enrolled in the study .
since the actual application date was unable to found before 2001 , we enrolled the sle patients who applying the registry for catastrophic illnesses after 2001 .
the date of the first ambulatory care visit with a diagnosis of sle ( age >= 18 ) was set as the index date for the study cohort .
to identify new sle cases , patients with an index date before january 1 , 2001 , were excluded .
patients with sle who completed seasonal influenza vaccination ( icd - 9 - cm v04.7 and v04.8 ) formed the vaccine cohort , with the date of vaccination defined as the index date for measuring the follow - up period .
patients with sle who received pneumococcal vaccine were excluded .
in addition , patients newly diagnosed with sle without both annual influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations formed the nonvaccine cohort .
the index date of the nonvaccine cohort was selected randomly from the same date of the vaccine cohort with the same application year .
the corresponding vaccine cohort was selected randomly after matching for index month .
study outcomes the follow - up person - year for each participant was measured from the index date to 365 days or until censure because of death or withdrawal from the insurance system .
the outcome events included total hospitalization ; hospitalization for pneumonia ( icd - 9 - cm 480 - 487 ) , septicemia , bacteremia , viremia ( icd - 9 - cm 038.x , 790.7 , and 790.8 ) , and heart disease ( icd - 9 - cm 401 - 429 ) ; intensive care unit ( icu ) admission ; in - hospital dialysis ; and death .
covariate assessment for ascertaining other relevant comorbidities , we included coronary artery disease ( icd - 9 - cm 410 - 413 , 414.01 - 414.05 , 414.8 , and 414.9 ) , congestive heart failure ( icd - 9 - cm 428 , 398.91 , 402.x1 ) , hypertension ( icd - 9 - cm 401 - 405 ) , hyperlipidemia ( icd - 9 - cm 272 ) , atrial fibrillation ( icd - 9 - cm 427.31 ) , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( icd - 9 - cm 490 - 496 ) , renal disease , cancer ( icd - 9 - cm 140 - 149 , 150 - 159 , 160 - 165 , 170 - 175 , 179 - 199 , 200 , 202 , 203 , 210 - 213 , 215 - 229 , 235 - 239 , 654.1 , 654.10 , 654.11 , 654.12 , 654.13 , 654.14 ) , chronic hepatitis ( icd - 9 - cm 571 , 572.2 , 572.3 , 572.8 , 573.1 , 573.2 , 573.3 , 573.8 , 573.9 ) , and stroke ( icd - 9 - cm 430 - 438 ) .
if these diagnostic codes were present in two or more ambulatory claims 1 year before the index date , they were recorded as comorbidities .
these comorbidities were tested in univariate analysis and were adjusted for in multivariate cox regression analysis .
statistical analysis we compared the demographic status ( i.e. , age , sex ) and comorbidities , namely coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , atrial fibrillation , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , renal disease , cancer , chronic hepatitis , stroke , dementia , and rehabilitation , between the vaccine and nonvaccine cohorts .
the differences were examined using the chi2 test for categorical variables and the t - test for continuous variables .
if the distribution of the steroid dose was abnormal , data were analyzed using the wilcoxon rank sum test .
the follow - up duration was used to estimate the incidence rates of hospitalization , pneumonia or influenza , respiratory failure , icu admission , and mortality .
the cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the corresponding hazard ratios ( hrs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) .
the hrs were adjusted for sex , age , and the aforementioned comorbidities in the cox model .
patient data were stratified by age (< 65 years and >= 65 years ) and analyzed .
in addition , the cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the baseline cumulative hazard rate for various outcomes in the vaccine and nonvaccine cohorts .
sas version 9.3 ( sas institute , cary , nc , usa ) was used for all data analyses .
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results 12,728 patients with sle with catastrophic illness certification were identified from 2001 to 2011 , and 10,125 adults with sle were enrolled after the following patients were excluded : 214 patients with missing age or sex data ; 827 patients who died before influenza vaccination , 1166 patients aged < 18 years , and 111 patients who received pneumococcal vaccine .
table 1 presents the annual proportion of influenza vaccination in newly diagnosed sle .
the vaccine and nonvaccine cohorts comprised 1765 and 8360 newly diagnosed patients with sle with and without vaccination for influenza , respectively .
when stratified by age , elderly patients (>= 65 years ) constituted most of the vaccinated patients .
table 2 presents the baseline characteristics .
the female to male ratio ( female predominance ) did not differ significantly between the two cohorts .
the mean age in the vaccine cohort ( 46.23 +/ - 17.69 years ) was substantially higher than that in the nonvaccine cohort ( 37.27 +/ - 13.21 years ) .
patients in the vaccine cohort had more comorbidities than those in the nonvaccine cohort .
the median of the steroid dose was identical in the cohorts .
regardless of morbidities , the irr for morbidity in the vaccinated and nonvaccinated cohorts did not differ ( table 3 ) .
in the cox proportional hazards analysis adjusting for various factors ( age , sex , and comorbidities ) , the adjusted hrs revealed a protective association with the vaccination .
the total hospitalization rate was lower in the vaccine cohort ( adjusted hr 0.82 [ 95 % ci 0.73 - 0.92 ]) than in the nonvaccine cohort ( table 3 ) .
compared with patients in the nonvaccine cohort , those in the vaccine cohort were less likely to be admitted to the icu [ adjusted hr 0.55 ( 95 % ci 0.39 - 0.79 )] .
in addition , patients in the vaccine cohort were less likely to be hospitalized for septicemia , bacteremia , or viremia [ adjusted hr 0.48 ( 95 % ci 0.32 - 0.73 )] ; less likely to undergo in - hospital dialysis [ adjusted hr 0.40 ( 95 % ci 0.20 - 0.81 )] ; and were less predisposed to death [ adjusted hr 0.39 ( 95 % ci 0.26 - 0.59 )] .
in table 4 , the age - stratified analysis revealed that the vaccine to nonvaccine cohort rate of total hospitalization , hospitalization for pneumonia , icu admission , and death reduced with age .
compared with the nonvaccine cohort , the vaccine cohort had significantly lower rates of cumulative proportion of total hospitalization ( p = 0.01 , fig. 1a ) ; hospitalization for pneumonia ( p = 0.03 , fig. 1b ) ; hospitalization for septicemia , bacteremia , or viremia ( p = 0.0002 , fig. 1c ) ; icu admission ( p < 0.0001 , fig. 1d ) ; in - hospital dialysis ( p < 0.0001 , fig. 1e ) ; and mortality ( p < 0.0001 , fig. 1f ) .
discussion this nationwide population - based study demonstrated that influenza vaccination in adults with sle was associated with low morbidities , including total hospitalization , icu admission , hospitalization for pneumonia (>= 65 years old ) ; hospitalization for septicemia , bacteremia , or viremia ; and in - hospital dialysis .
in addition , influenza vaccination was associated with a 49 % lower mortality risk .
this is the first study addressing clinical outcomes of vaccination in patients with sle .
influenza infection - related morbidity and mortality increase in immunocompromised patients8 .
because of high annual incidence of influenza , which affects 5 - 20 % of the general population22 , vaccination is a clinically relevant concern in patients with sle .
influenza vaccination in patients with sle is safe because it does not induce disease activity23 .
our study demonstrated that influenza vaccination in patients with sle is associated with a reduced risk of morbidity and mortality , supporting the annual vaccination in such patients , as recommended by gluck et al.24 .
patients with sle have a high influenza infection risk of infection .
low complement levels , functional alterations of phagocytic cells , impaired cellular immunity with lymphopenia and decreased cytokine production , decreased immunoglobulin production , low microorganism eliminating capacity by the reticulo - endothelial system , and immunosupressant drugs are among the predisposing factors for the increased infection rate12 .
influenza increases the risk of pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia , and vaccination is a cost - effective and efficient means to prevent influenza .
yearly vaccinations are recommended because of the risk of severe influenza in patients with sle2526 .
our study revealed that vaccinated elderly patients (>= 65 years ) with sle had a low risk of hospitalization for pneumonia .
several studies have shown that patients with sle have a reduced antibody response after vaccination compared with healthy adults142027. by contrast , several studies have suggested the efficacy of vaccination in patients with sle121321 .
in addition , immunosuppressive drugs may further reduce the immune response following vaccination282930. whether vaccination is effective in patients with sle is unclear .
however , a favorable clinical outcome of vaccination in patients with sle was observed in this study .
because vaccinations effectively reduce hospitalizations and deaths in patients with sle , healthcare providers must ensure that patients receive yearly influenza vaccines .
since 1998 , the taiwan nhi program provides influenza vaccinations to high - risk patients , including those with sle and the elderly patients ; majority of the vaccinated patients annually receive this service between october 1 and december 31 .
however , the influenza vaccination rate in this study was low for patients with incident sle , particularly for those younger than 65 years .
the low vaccination rate may be due to the lack of awareness , fear of adverse reactions , and the lack of physician recommendations .
in addition , rheumatologists' workload may be a factor for low vaccination rates .
a canadian study reported that physicians with heavy workloads do not adequately address disease prevention31 .
furthermore , physicians in the united states do not recommend influenza vaccination to elderly and high - risk patients32 .
in the health care settings of taiwan , in - patient waiting duration is long and physicians are pressured to shorten the consultations .
physicians treating patients with several chronic conditions discuss and treat each condition , leaving them with less time to introduce a new concern or discuss disease prevention .
furthermore , a lack of knowledge regarding the vitality and usefulness of vaccination may contribute to the low vaccination rate3334 .
these factors are conjectures and must be substantiated .
studies assessing the clinical efficacy of influenza vaccination on patients with sle are lacking .
two small studies have demonstrated low infection rates after influenza vaccination in patients with sle and rheumatoid arthritis and in children with rheumatic diseases2135 .
liao et al. suggest with consideration of a higher risk of sle exacerbation and a more severe course of infection among sle patients , influenza vaccination should be promoted among with a low - to - moderate sle disease activity index score or stable disease36 .
murdaca et al. report that influenza vaccination in sle patients are ( 1 ) efficacious , even if specific immune responses may be lower than in the general population , as generally the humoral response fulfills the criteria for vaccine immunogenicity and ( 2 ) safe in inactive disease although may favor a transient increase in autoantibody levels and rarely disease flares37 .
although there are concerns that immunization may cause sle exacerbation , evidence from prospective trials suggests that inactivated influenza vaccine are probably safe in patients with stable or inactive sle disease activity38 .
indeed , in immunocompromised patients , influenza vaccination benefits ( reduced morbidities and mortalities ) have been demonstrated7 .
the strengths of our study include the large representative sample size of adults with sle , cohort design , and the one - year follow - up for each cohort .
the one - year follow - up can determine the possibility of delayed complications of influenza .
the study has several limitations .
first , the nhid provided limited information on sociodemographic characteristics , marital status , educational level , smoking habits , and body mass index , and laboratory data were unavailable .
these variables were not adjusted for in the analysis .
additionally , information on sle severity scale , such as disease activity , organ damage and the levels of autoantibodies was unavailable in our data .
the lack of drug data , such as immunosuppresives and glucocorticosteroids to adjust for the outcomes of interest could be another limitation .
furthermore , receiving vaccination may be affected by the socioeconomic status and the availability of health care and medical providers .
although multivariate analysis was used , selection bias may have occurred .
in conclusion , influenza vaccination is associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization , pneumonia , icu admission , in - hospital dialysis , and death .
additional large - scale prospective studies are warranted to investigate the efficacy of influenza vaccination efficacy in adults with sle .

the term idiopathic short stature ( iss ) refers to short children with no identifiable disorder of the growth hormone ( gh )/ insulin like growth factor ( igf ) axis and no other endocrine , genetic or organ system disorder .
this heterogeneous group of short children without gh deficiency ( ghd ) includes children with constitutional delay of growth and puberty , familial short stature , or both , as well as those with subtle cartilage and bone dysplasias .
in rare cases , iss is due to igf molecular abnormalities .
in this review we tackle the major challenges in the definition and treatment of iss .
conflict of interest : none declared .
growth idiopathic short stature growth hormone insulin - like growth factor definition a heterogeneous population idiopathic short stature ( iss ) is defined as a condition characterized by a height more than 2 standard deviations below the corresponding average height for a given age , sex and population , without findings of disease. ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) according to this definition , it is estimated that approximately 80 % of all children referred for short stature , at the end of the diagnostic work - up , will be labeled as iss. ( 4 ) the concept behind this definition is that iss can be considered as part of the continuum extending from complete growth hormone deficiency ( ghd ) to normality and covering different degrees of gh secretion and responsiveness .
to better define this population , iss has recently been subdivided into two major groups : a ) familial short stature ( fss ) , when the child is short compared with the reference population , but remains within the range of target height ; b ) non - familial short stature ( nfss ) , when the child is short both in comparison with the reference population and the target height .
this latter subgroup inevitably includes short children with constitutional delay of growth and puberty ( cdgp ).( 1 ) the need of a sub - categorization stems from the classical distinction between the " normal variants " of growth ( namely fss and cdgp ) , characterized by the achievement of an adult height within the range of target height , and the " real " iss children , whose growth pattern and natural history are different from fss and cdgp and are thought to have a different etiology .
more about the distinction between iss and normal variants of growth classically , fss children present with stature within the target height range , no bone age delay and normal growth rate (>= 25th centile ) , whilst cgdp subjects show short stature , bone age delay ( usually 32 years ) , delayed onset of puberty ( 313 years in girls , >= 14 years in boys ) , normal growth rate (>= 25th centile ) , and often familial history of delayed puberty .
it has been objected that before the age of 13 ( for girls ) or 14 ( for boys ) years , certainty about the timing of pubertal onset ( normal or delayed ) cannot be obtained .
before that age , a delayed bone age is indeed to some extent predictive for cdgp , but it is a clinical observation that some children with delayed bone age may enter puberty at a normal age , and vice versa .
therefore a clear distinction between iss and cdgp may be difficult. ( 5 ) nevertheless , provided that the child fulfills the criteria for the definition of cdgp and endocrine tests are normal , the likelihood of cdgp is extremely high .
moreover , typically the child with cdgp starts losing centiles in the growth curve around the age when puberty usually begins in the general population .
we believe that for the management of the child with short stature , the auxological sub - classification is helpful. with respect to the diagnostic process , in a child with fss ( if pathological causes of parental shortness are considered unlikely ) the chance of finding a pathological disorder is low .
thus , the full set of diagnostic investigations may not be necessary , unless growth rate slows down , and these children attain their genetic potential .
if a child 's height sds is lower than the target range ( nfss ) and there is a positive family history of cdgp , the likelihood of cdgp is high , and the experienced clinician may follow an expectant course .
therefore , iss is a diagnosis that is not based on positive findings in the diagnostic work - up , but on exclusion of other recognizable conditions .
more specifically , children with iss should be considered gh sufficient , should have normal body proportions , no history of a low birth size ( small for gestational age , sga ) , no chromosomal abnormalities , no dysmorphic syndromes and no systemic , endocrine or nutritional diseases. ( 1 ) finally , normal variants of growth ( fss and cgdp ) should be excluded .
the completeness of the medical history ( table 1 ) , the accuracy of the physical examination ( table 2 ) and the investigations ( table 3 ) determine the possibility of identifying underlying pathologies .
the frequency of iss amongst short children in short individuals the prevalence of known growth disorders is obviously much higher than in the total population , but these still constitute the minority .
in most short children no diagnosis can be made , and these are labeled as having '' idiopathic short stature " .
the percentage of pathology found in most studies is approximately 5 %.( 4 , 6 , 7 ) whereas in 15 % a history of a low birth weight or length for gestational age ( sga ) is found. ( 8 ) this means that in approximately 80 % of the short children presented to a pediatric clinic there is no history of a low birth weight and / or length , and no pathology can be detected .
the vast majority of them have normal variants of growth ( fss or cdgp ) and will attain an adult height within the target height range .
short stature : a statistical concept or a disease ?
shortness is defined as a condition in which the height of the individual is 2 sd below the corresponding mean height for a given age , sex and population group.1 therefore , short stature is defined on the basis of a statistical cut - off point which does not automatically imply the presence of an underlying pathology .
height distributes in a definite population according to a gaussian curve in which subjects with a height < - 2 sd can either be considered as the necessary 2.3 % shortest part of the normal distribution , or as individuals with a disorder that restricts growth. ( 5 ) pathophysiology of iss iss children represent a highly heterogeneous population with multiple potential pathophysiological mechanisms. ( 9 ) in the diagnostic work - up for iss , dysmorphic syndromes must be excluded , but it is not agreed how far genetic testing should go before the condition can be labeled as idiopathic .
for example , there is wide agreement that all girls should be tested for turner syndrome , but there is no consensus of whether all short children should be tested for a heterozygous deletion or mutation of shox , which has been described in about 2.5 % of iss children. ( 10 ) recently a clinical score was developed to predict the likelihood of a shox defect and this can be used for improved selection of patients for testing. ( 11 ) there is no agreement on either what skeletal dysplasias should be excluded or what cut - off limit with respect to body proportions should be used .
to assess body proportion , in europe the sitting height / height ( sh / h ) ratio and in the united states the upper / lower segment ratio is used , but both of these ratios are strongly influenced by secular trend and reliable references are not available. by definition , children with iss have normal gh secretion , which is almost always investigated by a pharmacological gh provocation test .
theoretically , they could have reduced spontaneous 24 - hr gh secretion .
however , the assessment of spontaneous gh secretion is very rarely included in the clinical evaluation of short stature and the entity of gh neurosecretory dysfunction ( 12 ) still remains controversial .
some iss children have been found to have low concentrations of growth hormone binding protein ( ghbp ) , suggesting reduced gh receptor ( ghr ) function. ( 13 ) these patients tend to have lower igf - i levels yet higher endogenous gh secretion , suggestive of partial gh insensitivity ( ghi ).( 14 ) an overlap exists between iss patients and those with partial or atypical ghi .
this was appreciated from the study of the european cohort of ghi patients , ( 15 ) some of whom did not have the typical appearance of laron syndrome .
in fact , some had milder short stature and normal facial appearance with less biochemical abnormalities. ( 16 ) however , it has to be pointed out that the vast majority of iss children have igfi in the low normal range and normal gh concentrations .
our preliminary data , collected from a group of 94 children ( subdivided in nfss , fss and controls ) , show a significant difference in mean serum igf - i sds concentrations between nfss children and controls ( figure 1 ) .
the existence of a mild form of ghi is hence extremely rare in iss population .
defects in post - receptor gh signaling have been described. ( 17 , 18 , 19 ) a homozygous mutation in exon 15 of the stat5b gene has been reported .
the mutant protein could not be activated by gh , therefore failing to activate gene transcription. ( 18 ) however , the first reported case showed a complex phenotype characterized by features of severe ghi together with immunodeficiency consistent with a non - functional stat5b .
in summary , some children labeled as iss may have a low spontaneous gh secretion that has not been detected , a genetic disorder that has not been studied ( e.g. shox haploinsufficiency ) , a dysfunctional gh promoter or an abnormal gh molecule that has not been analyzed , or some form of decreased responsiveness to gh by a genetic defect in gh signaling .
it is likely that in the coming years more identifiable clinical conditions will be discovered that nowadays are still resting under the cover of the term " idiopathic " .

therapy gh a careful review of the diagnostic approach to short stature over the last 50 years would inevitably lead to the conclusion that rather than diagnosis dictating therapy , the availability of gh dictated diagnosis .
since recombinant gh has become widely available ( 19 ) , its indications are substantially increased .
the treatment with gh for iss has been approved by the food and drug administration ( fda ) in united states in july 2003 for children shorter than - 2.25 sds ( 1.2 percentile ) .
very few studies report on the efficacy and safety of long - term gh treatment of iss children until the achievement on adult height , and , for this reason , in europe this indication has not yet been approved .
according to the " consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of children with iss " this treatment should be considered if the height ranges from - 2 sds to - 3 sds and the optimal age to initiate treatment is 5 years to early puberty. ( 20 ) the therapy should generally not be started before the age of four and it should be prescribed until the growth is complete ( i.e. growth rate less than 1 - 2 cm / years , and / or bone age over 16 years in boys and 14 years in girls ).( 2 , 20 ) alternatively the treatment could be discontinued when child 's height achieves the normal adult range ( over - 2 sds ) .
it is important to consider adverse effects , cost of therapy , patients' expectations , ethical issues ( 21 ) and the impact of height gain on physical and psychosocial well - being. ( 20 ) in the united states , the current fdaapproved doses for gh in iss are up to 0.30 - 0.37 mg / kg * wk. ( 22 ) the dose may be increased if the growth response is considered inadequate , but there are no definitive data concerning the long - term safety of doses higher than 50 mug / kg / day ( 20 ) , even if the upper limit of gh dosage used in other pediatric conditions is approximately 70 mug / kg / day. ( 23 , 24 ) the evaluation of serum igf - i levels , together with auxological parameters , is important to assess efficacy , safety and compliance and to adjust the dose , in particular in iss patients in whom potential ghi may be the cause of a poor response to the standard dose .
the correlation between igf - i levels in prepubertal ghnaive children with iss and change in height sds shows that higher growth response corresponds to lower baseline serum igf - i levels. ( 25 , 26 ) igf - i levels that are consistently elevated ( 32.0 sds ) should prompt consideration of gh dose reduction. ( 20 ) a successful response to gh treatment in the first year is defined by a delta height sds more than 0.3 to 0.5 , a first year height velocity increment more than 3 cm / year or a height velocity sds more than 1 , because height velocity in cm / yr depends on age and is less reliable .
to evaluate the long - term response a number of parameters should be taken into account :( 20 ) a ) adult height sds ; b ) height gain in sds in comparison with the height at start of therapy ; c ) difference between adult height and predicted height ; d ) difference between the adult height and the target height .
gh treatment increases growth rate in the first year , but there are controversies about the effect on final height .
it is difficult to obtain homogeneous results about the effect of treatment , because the iss population is widely heterogeneous .
moreover a wide variety of dosages have been prescribed in several trials and most studies are uncontrolled .
a recent systematic review has evaluated the short - term and long - term results of ten studies ( seven of which were sponsored by or received support from pharmaceutical companies ) , published between 1989 and 2004 , that included 741 children with iss , treated with gh from 6 months to 6.2 years versus placebo or no treatment .
only one study reported adult height ( 27 ) and one reported near final height. ( 28 ) near final height of treated girls was on average 7.5 cm higher than untreated controls corresponding approximately to 1.23 sds. ( 28 ) treated children showed on average an adult height 3.7 cm ( or 0.51 sds ) higher than placebo - treated group. ( 27 ) these results are partially similar to those reported in a previous meta - analysis , that analyzed 10 controlled trials ( some of which considered also by the cochrane review ) and 28 uncontrolled trials .
in this report the adult height achieved by gh - treated individuals exceeded that of untreated controls by 0.78 to 0.84 sds , equivalent to 5 - 6 cm. ( 21 ) the national cooperative growth study ( a large surveillance study of gh use in the north america , in which 20 % of all children had iss ) , showed an increment of growth rate and height sds during the first year of treatment , followed by lesser degrees of catch - up over the next 6 years .
nevertheless , in the 7th year of therapy mean growth rate of the children was greater than the pretreatment value. ( 29 ) recently , a randomized controlled trial in iss children has investigated the effect on growth up to the achievement of adult height of two gh doses ( 33 or 67 mug / kg / day ) , demonstrating that gh treatment significantly increased the adult height by approximately 1 sds ( approx. 6 cm ) after a mean duration of therapy of 5.9 +/ - 1.1 years , allowing them to attain a height close to that of their parents .
the gh effect was dose - dependent and the children with parents of normal heights responded best. ( 30 ) in attempt to find the predictive factors of growth response to gh therapy to identify the children that could benefit from gh therapy , several multivariate models have been proposed .
the best growth response is found in children with parents of normal height ( nfss ) compared with children from short parents ( fss ).( 27 , 30 , 31 ) bone age delay is another important predictor ,( 27 , 31 ) being positively related to the response .
the prediction model of leschek et al. ( 27 ) explains 84 % of the variation in height gain and indicates that the best response is associated with lower baseline height sds relative to gender adjusted midparental height sds , lower pretreatment height velocity , lower baseline igfi concentrations and greater bone age delay .
nevertheless if the variables were considered individually , only bone age delay was significantly correlated with the height gain. ( 27 ) one of the aims of long - term gh treatment is the improvement of quality of life , but validated instruments to evaluate this effect are not currently recommended as part of routine care. ( 20 ) short stature among children with iss enrolled in the only longterm placebo - controlled study was not associated with problems in psychological adaptation or self - concept with the psychological instruments employed .
gh treatment was associated with a trend toward improvement in problem behaviours , as measured by questionnaires completed by study participants' parents .
it remains to be determined whether gh treatment significantly impacts adaptation , psychosocial function , or quality of life in children with iss. ( 32 ) the possible side effects in gh - treated children with iss are similar to those previously reported in children receiving gh therapy for other indications. ( 20 ) regular monitoring for scoliosis , tonsillar hypertrophy , papilledema and slipped capital femoral epiphysis should be performed as part of the regular physical exam during follow - up visits .
thus far , no instances of elevated blood glucose in gh - treated patients with iss have been reported , but monitoring of glucose metabolism is strongly advised .
increased risk of neoplasia or cancer relapses has been associated with gh therapy .
large - scale epidemiological studies have demonstrated a link between high concentrations of igf - i and many of the common cancers of adulthood , such as carcinomas of prostate , lung , breast and colon. ( 33 , 34 , 35 ) overall , available data suggest that high levels of igf - i and low levels of igf binding protein - 3 ( igfbp - 3 ) are predictive of an increased cancer risk .
gh causes increased serum igf - i and to a lesser extent , igfbp - 3 and consequently increases the ratio of igfi to igfbp - 3 , thus raising concern on safety of the long - term gh therapy. ( 36 , 37 , 38 ) to date , no increased risk of malignancy in iss children undergoing gh treatment has been reported .
however , it should be recognized , that the available pharmacovigilance data is insufficient in several aspects : a ) very few long - term randomized controlled trials have been conducted in iss children so far ; b ) registration trials of gh indications have relied on limited number of patients , have not included randomized control or placebo groups ( with a very small number of exceptions ) and are not a reliable source of safety data when dealing with rare events ; c ) most of the available information has been obtained from large post - marketing studies organized by gh manufacturers and conducted for too limited time .
indeed these programs have efficiently identified health issues occurring during the treatment ( diabetes , slipped capital femoral epiphyses , intracranial hypertension ) , but cannot address health issues occurring after treatment is discontinued ; d ) national pharmacovigilance programs are poorly efficient to detect rare events that would occur several years after the discontinuation of gh treatment and that are unlikely to be notified .
more studies are needed to detect whether children and young adults who have been treated with gh are at increased risk of cancer .
the role of gh treatment alternatives androgens in boys with cdgp , whose puberty and bone age are substantially delayed , testosterone is the appropriate therapy .
oxandrolone treatment was also proposed as a valid therapeutic approach in cdgp children .
although it offers the advantage of oral administration , the disadvantages are the weak androgenic activity and the remote risk of hepatotoxicity .
gnrh analogues therapy with gnrh analogues ( gnrha ) has been proposed to delay bone maturation and pubertal development ultimately leading to increased adult height. ( 39 , 40 ) monotherapy with gnrha in both sexes has shown a small and variable effect on adult height gain and the duration of treatment seems to be positively correlated with the gain in final height .
however , due to the lack of conclusive data , this treatment is not recommended .
concerns have been raised regarding potential adverse effects of gnrha , including on bone mineral density ( 41 ) and on the psychological consequences of delaying puberty. ( 42 ) combination therapy with gnrha and gh might have potential value , although convincing data are not yet available .
aromatase inhibitors aromatase inhibition has been proposed to stimulate growth in the presence of androgens , whereas bone age advancement is slowed due to inhibition of estrogen production .
an increase in predicted adult height has been shown in males with cdgp ,( 43 ) but adult height data are not available .
the use of aromatase inhibitors in females is currently considered unsafe .
to date , the long - term efficacy and safety of aromatase inhibitors in males with iss has not been demonstrated .
combination therapy with aromatase inhibitors and gh has been reported to slow down the tempo of bone age acceleration and increase predicted adult height ,( 44 ) however , long - term follow - up of these patients is still required .
in conclusion , aromatase inhibitors might theoretically represent suitable therapeutic agents , alone or in combination with gh , in boys with iss .
evidence , however , is still limited and this treatment should be still considered only within controlled clinical trials .
igf - i in the united states , japan , and europe igf - i has been approved for treatment of non - gh deficient children with severe igf - i deficiency. ( 45 ) therefore , igf - i therapy might be theoretically considered in those iss children who do not respond to gh and have low igf - i concentrations .
however , the finding of subnormal igf - i levels in iss children is exceptional .
in subjects with igf - i in the low normal range there is no controlled study comparing the effect of the therapy with gh or gh treatment alternatives with igf - i administration .

aim : to investigate the differences of corneal biomechanic characteristics using ocular response analyzer ( ora , reichert ; usa ) on type 2 diabetics and healthy subjects .
methods : one hundred eyes of 100 subjects ( between the ages of 17 - 91 ) who applied to adnan menderes university 's ophthalmology clinic between january - march 2015 were included in this study , 50 diabetics ( group 1 ) and 50 healthy controls ( group 2 ) .
the eyes included in the study were randomly chosen .
corneal hysteresis ( ch ) , corneal resistance factor ( crf ) , goldmann correlated intraocular pressure ( iopg ) and corneal compensated intraocular pressure ( iopcc ) of patients were measured by ora .
detailed ophthalmological examinations were done for every subject .
kolmogorov - smirnov test was used to analyze the distribution of quantitative variables and t test was used for the data that were normally distributed .
any p value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant .
results : the mean ages were 63.3 +/ - 9.0 and 61.7 +/ - 11.6 in group 1 and 2 , respectively ( p = 0.459 ) .
25 ( 50.0 %) were female , 25 ( 50.0 %) were male in group 1 and 26 ( 52.0 %) were female , 24 ( 48.0 %) were male in group 2 ( p = 1.000 ) .
mean iopcc values were 17.8 +/ - 3.6 ( 12.1 - 29.0 ) and 16.0 +/ - 3.1 ( 10.9 - 23.8 ) mmhg ( p = 0.006 ) ; mean iopg values were 16.9 +/ - 3.5 ( 10.9 - 25.9 ) and 15.4 +/ - 2.9 ( 9.0 - 24.7 ) mmhg ( p = 0.032 ) ; mean ch values were 9.9 +/ - 1.5 ( 6.1 - 13.3 ) and 10.5 +/ - 1.7 ( 6.5 - 15.7 ) ( p = 0.080 ) and mean crf values were 10.4 +/ - 1.6 ( 7.5 - 14.0 ) and 10.5 +/ - 1.7 ( 6.6 - 15.4 ) ( p = 0.730 ) in groups 1 and 2 , respectively .
conclusions : there was no any statistical difference between the groups in terms of ch and crf .
however , mean ch and crf values were found less in diabetic group .
corneal biomechanical differences seen in diabetic patients may be associated with a statistically significantly higher iop measurements .
keywords ocular response analyzer corneal biomechanic properties type 2 diabetes mellitus corneal hysteresis intraocular pressure lower hysteresis 1 introduction ocular response analyzer ( ora , reichert ; usa ) , which is a non - contact tonometer , is the first device capable of dynamic evaluation of the in vivo biomechanical properties of the cornea [ 1 ] .
the device sprays the air jet to form deformation in the cornea .
ora air pressure creates two cornea current response measurements ( p1 , p2 ) depending on the impact : the force required to flatten the cornea with rising pressure , and the force required to flatten the cornea again with decreasing pressure .
the difference between the two pressures ( p1 - p2 ) is termed " corneal hysteresis " ( ch ) .
the average of the two applanation pressure is described as compatible with goldmann iop ( iopg ) .
the device taking into account the ch determines a second iop ( iopcc ) , compensated by the biomechanical properties of the cornea .
the other important parameter of the device is a corneal resistance factor ( crf ) [ 2 ] .
clinical trials with ora have shown that the device is not affected or slightly affected by cct values [ 3 ] .
diabetes mellitus ( dm ) is a systemic disease which affects the eye in very different ways : diabetic retinopathy , neovascular glaucoma , cataract , ptosis , oculomotorius nerve palsy [ 4 ] .
dry eye symptoms can typically be observed in diabetics , like burning and foreign body sensation , decreased in visual quality [ 4 ] .
besides corneal complications in diabetic patients , cct was investigated .
in some publications , there is no difference in cct between diabetic patients and normal subjects [ 5 , 6 ] .
many publications reported that cct increased in diabetic patients [ 7 - 10 ] .
the aim of this study was to investigate the differences in corneal biomechanic characteristics between the patients with and without type 2 dm .
2 methods one hundred eyes of 100 subjects ( between the ages of 17 - 91 ) who applied to university outpatient clinic between january - march 2015 were included in this study , 50 diabetics ( group 1 ) and 50 controls ( group 2 ) .
the eyes included in the study were randomly chosen .
ch , crf , iopg and iopcc of patients were measured by ora .
the patient exclusion criteria of the study include : patients who have any corneal pathology , uveitis , and posterior segment pathology , lens pathology that prevent the fundus examination , dry eye or conjunctivitis is detected , ocular trauma and previous ocular surgery history , patients who underwent ocular intravitreal injection , patients who take any topical treatment , patients who get treatment medications for systemic disease except dm and patients who noncooperate to measure with ora .
the study protocol had the approval of the university 's ethics committee and complied with the guidelines set forth in the declaration of helsinki .
detailed ophthalmological examinations were done for every subject .
2.1 statistical analysis kolmogorov - smirnov test was used to analyze the distribution of quantitative variables and t - test was used for the data that were normally distributed .
any p value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant .
if the data did not fit a normal distribution , mann - whitney - u test was used for comparisons between the groups .
descriptive statistics of normally distributed data were shown as mean +/ - standard deviation .
descriptive statistics were shown as the median ( 25 - 75 percentiles ) for the data that did not fit a normal distribution .
chi - square test was used for qualitative data analysis and descriptive statistics were shown as frequency ( percent ) .
all results were analyzed statistically using the spss ( statistical package for the social sciences ; spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) version 16 software package for windows .
3 results the mean ages were 63.3 +/ - 9.0 and 61.7 +/ - 11.6 in group 1 and 2 , respectively ( p = 0.459 ) .
25 ( 50.0 %) were female , 25 ( 50.0 %) were male in group 1 and 26 ( 52.0 %) were female , 24 ( 48.0 %) were male in group 2 ( p = 1.000 ) ( table 1 ) .
mean iopcc values were 17.8 +/ - 3.6 ( 12.1 - 29.0 ) and 16.0 +/ - 3.1 ( 10.9 - 23.8 ) mmhg ( p = 0.006 ) ; mean iopg values were 16.9 +/ - 3.5 ( 10.9 - 25.9 ) and 15.4 +/ - 2.9 ( 9.0 - 24.7 ) mmhg ( p = 0.032 ) ; mean ch values were 9.9 +/ - 1.5 ( 6.1 - 13.3 ) and 10.5 +/ - 1.7 ( 6.5 - 15.7 ) ( p = 0.080 ) and mean crf values were 10.4 +/ - 1.6 ( 7.5 - 14.0 ) and 10.5 +/ - 1.7 ( 6.6 - 15.4 ) ( p = 0.730 ) in groups 1 and 2 , respectively ( table 2 ) .
there was no statistical difference between the groups in terms of ch and crf .
however , mean ch and crf values were found less no in the diabetic group .
there was a statistically significant difference between the diabetic and nondiabetic groups in terms of iop parameters .
mean iopcc and iopg values were found high in the diabetic group .
4 discussion in our study , we investigated the differences of ora measurements between healthy subjects and type 2 diabetic patients .
mean iopcc and iopg values were found to be statistically significantly high in the diabetic group , associated with lower ch and crf levels .
the study of scheler et al. investigated the relationship between hba1c levels and ora measurements in diabetic patients [ 11 ] .
they revealed a higher rate of ch and crf levels in poorly controlled diabetic patients .
there was n't any difference between the well - controlled diabetic patients and healthy control groups in biomechanical measurements in their study .
in cankaya et al. ' s study , they compared the biomechanic properties of the cornea between patients with and without type 2 diabetes [ 12 ] .
iopg , crf and cct values were statistically significantly higher in diabetic patients than healthy subjects .
we revealed a higher rate of iopcc and iopg values in diabetic patients .
corneal viscosity may affect ch measure .
in previous studies , it has been shown to decrease ch with viscosity reduction [ 13 ] .
independent of other factors , increasing age can cause a decrease in viscosity [ 14 ] .
the high rates iop that we measured in dm patients compared to the control group may be an indication that diabetes affects corneal biomechanical measurements .
as seen in other studies we have found that an inverse relationship between iop and ch [ 15 , 16 ] .
some studies show that high iop and glaucoma may develop in diabetic patients .
bonovas et al. suggest that diabetic patients are at significantly increased risk of developing primary open - angle glaucoma [ 17 ] .
in a study with using specular microscopy , chronic metabolic stress occurs as a result of hyperglycemia in diabetics and it can cause morphological changes in the corneal endothelium [ 18 ] .
there are many publications which investigated the causes of the structural changes in the cornea in patients with diabetes .
mcnamara et al. suggest that hyperglycemia can affect water retention in the cornea and this situation can cause structural changes in the cornea [ 19 ] .
in a research , mean cct and goldmann applanation tonometry iop , iopcc , and iopg were significantly higher in diabetic patients than in healthy control subjects [ 20 ] .
similar results are observed in many studies [ 21 , 22 ] .
corneal biomechanical differences seen in diabetic patients may be associated with statistically significantly higher iop measurements .
actually , we do not know " how and why " diabetes affects corneal biomechanical measurements .
further studies are needed to answer these questions .
we may only speculate or estimate for now as ; it may be related to glucose level or something else and these changing may possibly affect the elasticity or viscosity of the cornea .
conclusion the mean ch and crf values were found less in the diabetic group .
a statistically significant difference was found between the diabetic and nondiabetic groups in terms of iop parameters .
mean iopcc and iopg values were found high in the diabetic group .
we believe that this will provide a base that will shed light on other work needs to be done .

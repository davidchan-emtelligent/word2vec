sir , we read article on ' dislocation following total knee arthroplasty ( tka )' 1 with interest .
we congratulate the authors for highlighting the details of a rare complication of tka , i.e. , dislocation of the prosthesis .
based upon our experience in dealing with six such cases of dislocation in posterior stabilized ( ps ) knees , we disagree with the authors regarding their method of treatment .
the authors have performed a delayed revision of all components in each of their cases , without specifying the real indication for doing so. revision tka is a formidable surgery with relatively poor outcomes and may be associated with complications like infection etc. , as happened in one of the cases in their series .
we advocate that only if there is significant instability after the reduction and / or if the prosthesis components are loose and / or if the components are grossly malpositioned should the patient be subjected to revision tka for all - component revision.2 among our six cases we could achieve stable reduction in four patients with closed reduction under general anesthesia .
on table , assessment under anesthesia after reduction did not reveal any gross instability and these patients were treated conservatively with a knee brace for 3 weeks post reduction .
after 3 weeks , range of motion exercises of the knee was started .
all patients achieved pre - dislocation status .
after an average follow - up of 3.5 years there was no recurrence of instability or implant loosening .
only two patients , who had recurrent instability , required revision tka and both of them could be salvaged with a polyethylene insert that was one size thicker .
in these two cases , polyethylene wear occurred at the periphery of the tibial plateau and along the post of the tibial spine [ figure 1 ] ; similar findings have also been reported by other surgeons.2 although tibio - femoral instability has classically been reported with cruciate - retaining prostheses , we tend to agree with the authors of the article under discussion that the ps knee prosthesis is not immune to this problem3 : it can happen in both cruciate - retaining and cruciate - substituting tkas .
a wrong surgical technique and wrong choice of constraint of the prostheses are the main causes for instability .
malalignment , malrotation , and intraoperatively uncorrected instability ( especially in flexion ) may lead to unstable tka.4 - 6 if a minor instability due to this reason persists in a knee it may lead to early wear and / or breakage of the tibial polyethylene post ( in a ps knee ) and delayed stretching and rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament ( pcl ) in a cruciate - retaining knee , resulting in a delayed dislocation of the prosthesis , either spontaneously or after minor trauma.7 figure 1 wear on the medial side and posterior aspect of the lateral side of the polyethylene insert in the paper under discussion , the authors have recommended a universal need for revision tka after even a single episode of dislocation .
we tend to disagree and would like to point out that all patients may not require revision and some can be managed conservatively with successful outcomes.7 the surgeon should have a higher threshold for resorting to revision tka in such cases .
experience from larger series and joint registries is required to enlighten us further regarding the pattern of such instabilities and the effective treatment modalities .

doi : 10.12861 / jrip.2012.17 implication for health policy / practice / research / medical education : radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy for pelvic malignancies such as gastrointestinal cancers , gynecologic cancers , lymphomas , and sarcomas of the upper abdomen and during total body irradiation may result in radiation - induced kidney injury .
the incidence of clinical radiation nephropathy has increased with the use of total - body irradiation in preparation for bone marrow transplantation .
radiation nephropathy usually manifests as proteinuria , hypertension and impairment in urine concentration .
the precise pathogenic mechanisms and / or mediators involved in radiation nephropathy remain under active investigation .
however , radiation nephropathy is no longer viewed as inevitable , progressive , and untreatable .
the kidneys are vitally important , responsible for producing erythropoietin to stimulate red blood cell production , filtering waste metabolites and electrolytes from the blood , and modulating blood pressure by fluid / electrolyte balance ( 1 ) .
in pelvis radiation therapy ( rt ) , the pronounced radiosensitivity of renal tissue limits the total radiotherapeutic dose that can be applied safely to treatment volumes that include the kidneys ( 2 ) .
radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy for pelvic malignancies such as gastrointestinal cancers , gynecologic cancers , lymphomas , and sarcomas of the upper abdomen and during total body irradiation ( tbi ) may result in radiation - induced kidney injury , especially radiation nephropathy ( rn ) ( 1,3,4 ) .
the incidence of clinical rn has increased with the use of tbi in preparation for bone marrow transplantation ( bmt ) and as a consequence of radionuclide therapies .
bmt nephropathy usually develops very slowly , over a period of several years , and manifests as proteinuria , hypertension and impairment in urine concentration ( 4,5 ) .
it is possible that radiation nephropathy could occur after a nuclear accident or because of nuclear terrorism ( 6,7 ) .
exposures that would cause this would have to be in the 5 to 10 gy range .
" doses less than 5 gy would not materially affect the kidneys , whereas doses greater than 10 gy would cause rapid gastrointestinal death " ( 8 - 10 ) .
in rn , as in normal tissue radiation injury in general , it is not possible to predict which subjects will develop the complication .
however , considering the threshold dose , sufficient ionizing radiation injures most or all components of the kidney .
glomerular injury is chronologically first , and involves at least its endothelium and mesangium , with evolution to glomerular scarring due to thrombotic microangiopathy .
expression of tubular injury appears to occur somewhat later , even if it is set in motion at the same time as the glomerular injury .
oxidative injury to the glomeruli , could play a mechanistic role .
denuded tubules could allow interstitial entry to mediators that escape from injured glomeruli .
local mediator expression , such as tgfbeta1 or activation of renin - angiotensin system could be key in creating tubulointerstitial scarring .
moreover , there are some rare syndromes of radiation sensitivity such as ataxia telangiectasia , but these are not clinically frequent ( 4 ) .
management of radiation nephropathy includes attention to control of blood pressure and the use of angiotensin - converting - enzyme inhibitors ( ace inhibitors ) or angiotensin ( aii ) receptor blockers ( 11,12 ) .
conclusion radiation - induced kidney injury involves complex and dynamic interactions between glomerular , tubular , and interstitial cells .
although the precise pathogenic mechanisms and / or mediators involved in radiation nephropathy remain under active investigation .
radiation nephropathy is no longer viewed as inevitable , progressive , and untreatable .

the novel aspect of this study involves illustrating significant adaptation of a functionally loaded bone - pdl - cementum complex in a ligature - induced periodontitis rat model .
following 4 , 8 , and 15 days of ligation , proinflammatory cytokines ( tnf - alpha and rankl ) , a mineral resorption indicator ( trap ) , and a cell migration and adhesion molecule for tissue regeneration ( fibronectin ) within the complex were localized and correlated with changes in pdl - space ( functional space ) .
at 4 days of ligation , the functional space of the distal complex was widened compared to controls and was positively correlated with an increased expression of tnf - alpha .
at 8 and 15 days , the number of rankl (+) cells decreased near the mesial alveolar bone crest ( abc ) but increased at the distal abc .
trap (+) cells on both sides of the complex significantly increased at 8 days .
a gradual change in fibronectin expression from the distal pdl - secondary cementum interfaces through precementum layers was observed when compared to increased and abrupt changes at the mesial pdl - cementum and pdl - bone interfaces in ligated and control groups .
based on our results , we hypothesize that compromised strain fields can be created in a diseased periodontium , which in response to prolonged function can significantly alter the original bone and apical cementum formations .
1. introduction mechanical loads as a result of chewing or biting promote homeostasis of the periodontal ligament ( pdl ) and that of the bone - pdl - cementum complex following development of the bone - pdl - tooth fibrous joint [ 1 , 2 ] .
homeostasis of the joint is maintained by the pdl , which contains a heterogeneous population of cells , such as fibroblasts , osteoblasts , cementoblasts , and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells , and its entheses ( attachment sites ) with bone and cementum .
these cells are sensitive to mechanical loads , which manifest into strains , and as a result can promote mineral formation or resorption .
the cell - matrix and cell - cell interactions regulate continuous pdl turnover , modeling and remodeling of bone , and subsequent adaptation of primary and secondary cementum , including pdl - bone and pdl - cementum interfaces throughout their physiological function [ 2 - 5 ] .
accommodation of functional loads within the physiological range continues as long as the bone - pdl - cementum complex is protected from the oral environment by gingival epithelium and underlying connective tissues .
however , the complex is a target for bacterial infection due to commensal microorganisms in the oral environment and the unique anatomical feature of this environment [ 6 ] .
as a result , periodontal tissues are susceptible to bacterial invasion .
the relationship between host - microbial interactions and progression to periodontitis is thought to depend on a combination of the ecological shift in subgingival biofilm composition , genetic factors , and other extraneous influences [ 7 ] .
despite many extraneous factors , the " critical pathway " model for periodontal pathogenesis developed by offenbacher [ 8 ] does not account for mechanical loads , that is , the effect of functional mechanics on disease progression in the load bearing joint of humans .
biomechanics and other functional perspectives on diseased joints are important areas of study since the altered homeostasis due to bacterial invasion can lead to pathological adaptation of unaffected tissues .
hence , the combinatorial effect of disease and functional ( mechanical ) loads on disease progression and joint adaptation is an important area of investigation .
however , the challenge that lies in performing such studies is the limited access to specimens from humans .
hence , animal models in general and rat models in particular continue to be used extensively as an experimental system to elucidate the effect of diverse factors on periodontal pathogenesis and progression [ 9 , 10 ] .
despite the extensive literature regarding the characteristics of periodontal progression in different animal models , few studies have described the effects of the disease from a biomechanical perspective .
numerous human and animal studies have confirmed the infectious etiology of gingival inflammation [ 11 - 13 ] , apical migration of the gingival epithelial attachment , and the eventual loss of underlying bone and connective tissue support [ 14 , 15 ] , that leads to clinical periodontitis .
in this study , we employed the lipopolysaccharide - soaked rat ligature model to initiate the clinical features of periodontitis , namely inflammation and loss of pdl attachment and alveolar bone [ 16 ] .
this model is an analog that stimulates the natural occurrence of periodontitis in humans - - food impaction over time followed by acute and chronic inflammatory host responses [ 17 - 19 ] .
once disease is initiated , the complex is kept under continued function and the changes in clinical features can be correlated with the distribution of biochemical markers .
in this study , the presence and distribution of the following biochemical markers in sections taken from hemimaxillae harvested at 4 , 8 , and 15 days of ligation and corresponding controls were assessed : receptor activator of nuclear factor kappab ligand ( rankl : a membrane - bound protein commonly found on pdl cells , osteoblasts , and t cells , that induce the expression of rank on the surface of osteoclasts ) [ 20 , 21 ] ; tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase ( trap : an enzyme highly expressed by osteoclasts ) [ 22 ] ; tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha : a marker for systemic inflammation ) [ 23 ] , and fibronectin ( fn : a glycoprotein adhesion molecule for fibroblasts that promotes extracellular matrix production ) [ 24 ] .
moreover , changes in biochemical expressions and localization were correlated to morphological changes of the complex .
based on previous studies by others , morphological alterations of bone and cementum due to inflammation were associated with increased expressions of proinflammatory mediators [ 25 - 28 ] , including a variety of cytokines , such as tnf - alpha , that are involved in inflammatory bone resorption [ 29 ] .
rankl , which is known to orchestrate osteoclastogenesis synergistically with tnf - alpha [ 30 ] , was mapped throughout the bone - pdl - cementum complex and was expected to increase in inflamed periodontal tissue .
in addition , active osteoclasts and correlative changes in biochemical distribution and alveolar bone resorption were identified .
finally , adaptive changes in secondary cementum marked by fn expression [ 31 ] were discussed within the context of joint function .
our overall hypothesis was that coronal degradation due to periodontitis can cause a significant change in the biomechanics of the complex and that the resulting adaptive effects may not be the same between bone and secondary cementum .
the objective was to identify the adaptation of this load - bearing joint , that is , the bone - pdl - tooth complex , with the onset of periodontitis by mapping and correlating morphological changes of the tooth and the alveolar socket to key biomolecular expressions within the complex .
2. materials and methods to minimize the effects of environmentally induced periodontitis [ 32 - 34 ] , 6 - week - old male sprague - dawley rats were housed in a germ - free facility ( parnassus services building ) and fed a hard pelleted diet for the duration of the study .
all animals included in this study were housed in pathogen - free conditions in compliance with the guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committee ( iacuc ) of ucsf and the national institute of health ( nih ) .

induction of periodontitis using an in vivo rat ligature model 4 - 0 silk suture threads soaked in 1 mg of lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) from escherichia coli serotype 055 : b5 ( sigma - aldrich , usa ) per 1 ml of 1x tris buffer were used to induce periodontitis ( n = 5 per time point ) .
threads were placed between the first and second molars and the second and third molars of both maxillae ( figure 1 ( a )) .
molars were religated every 2 - 3 days to ensure retention .
control rats ( n = 5 per time point ) were flossed every 2 - 3 days with 4 - 0 silk ligatures without lps .

358 nm , emit .
461 nm ) .
images were stitched using microsoft research image composite editor ( microsoft corporation , redmond , wa , usa ) .
for quantitative analysis for rankl , the number of rankl (+) cells in two 125 mum square regions around the surface of alveolar bone crest was counted using image j ( v1.44p , national institute of health , usa ) .
group means (+/ - standard deviation ) were calculated .
a two - way analysis of variance ( anova ) was used to analyze the effect of time and experimental conditions .
a follow - up post - hoc test was used to analyze the differences between groups .
p < 0.05 was taken to indicate significance .
for comparative evaluation of fn , a 300 mum line plot spanning dentin , secondary cementum , pdl , and alveolar bone , were generated for immunofluorescence micrographs of each group , and gradients of fn intensities were mapped using image j .
3,3 ' - diaminobenzidine ( dab ) staining for detection of tnf - alpha was performed on serial sections .
endogenous peroxidases were deactivated with 80 % methanol and 0.6 % h2o2 .
following antigen retrieval , sections were incubated with normal serum for 30 min to prevent nonspecific binding .
for cytokine detection , the primary antibody ( goat polyclonal anti - rat tnf - alpha , sc - 1350 santa cruz biotechnology , inc. , santa cruz , ca. usa ) was applied on the sections at a dilution of 1 : 100 in pbs and incubated overnight at room temperature .
the sections were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with the secondary antibody ( biotinylated rabbit anti - goat igg antibody , pk - 6105 , vector labs , burlingame , ca. usa ) .
antigen - antibody complexes were visualized with dab tetrachloride solution ( sigma , d3939 , st. louis , mo , usa ) , washed in distilled water , counterstained with hematoxylin gill ( 3x ) ( fisher scientific , kalamazoo , mi , usa ) , and rinsed in running water .
finally , the sections were dehydrated in ascending concentrations of alcohol , cleared with xylene , and mounted .

lung tissues harvested from the same animals were used as positive controls .
the sections were evaluated by a single examiner , who was blinded to the treatment assignment using a light microscope ( bx 51 , olympus america inc. , san diego , ca , usa ) .
2.2.2 .
resorption by mapping trap (+) osteoclastic cells tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase ( trap ) staining for osteoclasts was performed by treating rehydrated specimens with 0.2 m acetate buffer , a solution of 0.2 m sodium acetate , and 50 mm l - (+) - tartaric acid ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) .
after 20 minutes of incubation at room temperature , naphthol as - mx phosphate and fast red tr salt were added , followed by incubation at 37degreesc for 1 hour with close monitoring under the microscope after the first half hour to monitor the development of a bright red staining for osteoclastic activity .
the stained sections were washed in deionized water , counterstained with hematoxylin , and mounted with immu - mount ( thermoscientific , fremont , ca , usa ) for subsequent examination under light microscopy .
trap (+) stained regions were categorized based on location : the segment from alveolar crest ( defined as the curved surface connecting the mesial and distal faces of the alveolar bone proper ) to the starting point of secondary cementum as the coronal segment , and from secondary cementum to the apex as the apical segment .
criteria for identification of osteoclasts were trap (+) staining with greater than three nuclei [ 36 ] .
the number of osteoclasts within each region was manually counted along the pdl - bone perimeter using image - pro plus v6.0 data acquisition software ( media cybernetics , inc. , bethesda , md , usa ) and ratios of osteoclast count to perimeter per mesial and distal location were calculated [ 37 ] .
these ratios were tested for statistical differences between control and ligature groups and across time points using two - way anova followed by post - hoc tests to analyze the difference between the groups .
differences with p < 0.05 were considered significant .
2.2.3 .
collagen birefringence using picrosirius red ( psr ) stain deparaffinized sections were stained with sirius red f3b ( c.i .
35782 ) and picric acid ( american mastertech scientific co. , lodi , ca , usa ) .
stained sections were analyzed with a light microscope and image - pro plus .
polarized light was used to enhance the birefringence of collagen to illustrate changes in collagen fiber orientation and birefringence intensity throughout the complex [ 38 , 39 ] .
2.3 .
changes in morphometrics of the bone - pdl - cementum complex using micro - x - ray computed tomography ( mu - xct ) macroscale structural analysis of intact right hemimaxillae ( n = 5 each group ) was performed using micro - x - ray tomography ( mu - xct , micro xct - 200 , xradia , inc. , pleasanton , ca , usa ) at 2x magnification .
x - ray imaging was performed on specimens using a tungsten anode with a setting of 75 kvp at 6 w at binning 2 and quartz silica ( sio2 ) filter designed specifically for biological specimens .
specimens were scanned while immersed in 70 % ethanol with the second molar centered in the field of view .
2000 projections were collected at an exposure time of 9 - 14 s for each projection .
tomograms were reconstructed ( xmreconstructor v8.1.6599 , xradia inc. , pleasanton , ca , usa ) and 2d virtual sections were generated ( xradia 3d viewer v1.1.6 , xradia inc. , pleasanton , usa ) to complete the following measurements using image j. to analyze the progression of periodontitis through the time points , three sagittal sections containing apical foramen were made through each specimen : in the mesiodistal direction through ( 1 ) both buccal roots , ( 2 ) both lingual roots , and ( 3 ) the interradicular region ( figure 1 ( c )) .
alveolar bone crest ( abc ) resorption was determined by measuring the distance from the cementoenamel junction ( cej ) to the adjacent abc of the second maxillary molar along mesial and distal roots ( figure 1 ( c )) .
the width of the pdl - space surrounding the second maxillary molar was determined using the aforementioned buccal and lingual sagittal sections ( n = 3 each group ) .
mesial and distal roots were divided into fourths from the cej to the root apex ( figure 1 ( d )). from the three apical fourths , five pdl - space measurements from the alveolar bone to the root cementum per quarter section were measured using image j. interradicular pdl spaces ( or interradicular distances ) measured using the midsagittal section as the distance from the crest of the interradicular bone to the molar root furcation ( figure 1 ( d )) .
all statistical analyses for significant differences in morphometrics across and within time points were performed using two - way anova combined with post - hoc tests .
differences with p < 0.05 were considered significant .
3. results the naturally occurring tension and compression fields in a rat bone - pdl - tooth complex [ 35 ] .
it should be noted that in a rat the distal side is more prone to mineral resorption while the mesial side is prone to mineral formation. from a biomechanical perspective , this is due to the tensile strains in the mesial side compared to reactionary compressive strains on the distal side .
as a result , mineral is formed on the mesial side of the alveolar socket , while mineral is resorbed on the distal side of the same alveolar socket , thus maintaining a uniform functional space within the bone - pdl - tooth fibrous joint .
3.1 .
changes in the expressions of biochemical markers within the lps soaked ligature - induced periodontitis model 3.1.1 .
rankl expression in the complex intense expression of rankl in endosteal spaces of alveolar bone and vasculature in pdl was detected ( figure 2 ( a )) in the ligated group .
in addition , osteoclasts in resorption pits at both pdl - bone and pdl - cementum attachment sites strongly expressed rankl ( figure 2 ( b )) .
to correlate rankl expression with osteoclastic activity , rankl (+) cell number was counted in subepithelial connective tissue ( ct ) near the alveolar crest ( figures 2 ( c ) - 2 ( e )) .
rankl (+) cell count interestingly exhibited advancing trends to trap (+) staining .
on the mesial side ( figure 2 ( d )) , the number of rankl (+) cells in the ligated group was greater than that in the control group .
however , the number of rankl (+) cells was reduced with time in both groups , showing a significant decrease in ligated group from 4 days to 15 days ( p < 0.05 ) .
on the distal side ( figure 2 ( e )) , there was a significant elevation of rankl (+) cells in the ligated group compared to the control group ( p < 0.05 ) at 4 days , but a decrease was observed at 8 days .
a higher number of rankl (+) cell count was identified on the distal side compared to mesial side of the ligated group and distal and mesial sides of the control group ( figures 2 ( d ) and 2 ( e )) .
3.1.2 .
osteoclastic activity in the complex morphological changes were also evaluated in mesiodistal stained sections , and increased alveolar bone resorption with time was observed ( figure 3 ( a )) .
consistent with mu - xct morphometric analysis , the cej - abc distance was higher in ligated groups ( figures 3 ( a ) and 5 ( a )( i )) .
multinucleated trap (+) cells were observed in endosteal and bone marrow spaces , irrespective of experimental conditions or time points ( figure 3 ( b )( i - ix )) .
active osteoclasts at the pdl - bone interface were also found on the alveolar crest in the 8 - day ligated group ( figure 3 ( b )( ii )) .
quantification of trap (+) cells showed preferential distal localization regardless of experimental condition or time point ( figures 3 ( b )( x ) and 3 ( b )( xi )) .
data for the 4 - day ligated group was discarded due to inadequate samples .
trap (+) cells showed preferential distal localization regardless of experimental condition or time point ( figures 3 ( b )( x ) and 3 ( b )( xi )) and peaked at 8 days except in apical segments on the distal side .
on the mesial side , osteoclastic activity at 8 days was significantly greater than that observed at 4 days in coronal segments and that of the 15 - day ligated group in apical segments ( figure 3 ( b )( x )) .
within control groups , no significant increase or decrease was seen in both coronal and apical segments .
however , the mesial osteoclastic activity of ligated groups significantly increased at 8 days in apical segments compared to respective control groups before decreasing at 15 days ( figure 3 ( b )( x )) .
on the distal side , osteoclastic activity both at 8 days and 15 days was significantly greater than that of the 4 - day control group in coronal segments when the 4 - day control group was used as the reference ( data not shown ) .
at both 8 and 15 days , ligated groups showed an increase in osteoclastic activity in coronal segments compared to corresponding control groups , while osteoclastic activity in ligated groups decreased in apical segments ( figure 3 ( b )( xi )). between 8 and 15 days , the distal osteoclastic activity of ligated groups decreased in both coronal and apical segments ( figure 3 ( b )( xi )) .
3.1.3 .
immunohistochemical localization of tnf - alpha tnf - alpha was identified in the gingival epithelium , subepithelial ct , endosteal spaces , predentin , and secondary cementum ( figure 4 ( a )) .
particularly , tnf - alpha expression in ligated groups was more intense than that of control groups at both mesial and distal pdl - cementum interfaces , the interradicular complex , and in endosteal spaces ( figure 4 ( b )) .
at a higher magnification , osteoclast - like cells were detected at pdl - bone interfaces in ligated groups ( figure 4 ( b ) , arrowheads ) .
3.2 .
lps soaked ligature - induced periodontitis rat model stimulated significant changes in alveolar bone resorption , pdl - space width , collagen birefringence , and fibronectin expression 3.2.1 .
alveolar bone resorption morphometric analysis using mu - xct revealed that at all time points , the distance from cej to abc ( cej - abc ) was greater in ligated groups when compared to control groups in both mesial and distal regions ( figure 5 ( a )( i )) .
while at 4 days both mesial and distal regions of ligated groups exhibited significant increases in cej - abc compared to controls , only the distal regions exhibited significant increases in corresponding comparisons .
in mesial regions of both control and ligated complexes , cej - abc exhibited a decreasing trend between 4 days to 8 days and an increase from 8 to 15 days ; however , only the ligated mesial region exhibited a significant increase between 8 and 15 days ( p < 0.05 ) .
in distal regions , the cej - abc exhibited increasing trends in both control and ligated complexes with time , increasing significantly at 8 and 15 days when compared to 4 days ( p < 0.05 ) .
the interradicular distance within the control complex decreased with time ( figure 5 ( a )( ii )) .
in contrast , the interradicular distance within the ligated complex decreased significantly between 4 and 8 days of ligation ( p < 0.05 ) and then increased slightly after 15 days of ligation .
comparisons of the averages in ligated and control interradicular pdl - spaces at each time point showed that the ligated complex had a significantly greater interradicular pdl - space at 4 days ( p < 0.05 ) .
this significant increase was not maintained at 8 days but was reestablished at 15 days .
3.2.2 .
pdl - space pdl - space measurements showed differences in trends across time between control ( figure 5 ( a )( iii )) and ligated complexes ( figure 5 ( a )( iv )) in both coronal and apical regions .
in all ligated regions , a decreasing followed by an increasing trend in pdl - space was found over time with a significant decrease in the distal apical region ( p < 0.05 ) .
in contrast , control complexes did not exhibit this trend with the exception of the distal coronal region .
instead , between 8 and 15 days the pdl - space of both mesial and distal sides showed a decreasing trend with time in the control complex , with a significant decrease between 4 and 15 days at the mesial apical region ( p < 0.05 ) .
when comparing the pdl - space between control and ligated complexes , it was interesting to note that all observed significant differences in the mesial regions occurred at the earlier time points of 4 and 8 days ( p < 0.05 ) .
the significant differences in distal regions occurred mostly at later time points of 8 and 15 days ( p < 0.05 ) .
to separate the effect of treatment from that of development , the average control pdl - space was subtracted from the average treated pdl - space for each region ( figure 5 ( b )) .
the mesial apical and all distal pdl - spaces of the ligated complex increased at 4 days , while mesial coronal and mesial middle pdl - spaces decreased compared to controls .
the mesial coronal , mesial middle , and distal apical regions , exhibited significant differences in pdl - space between ligated and control groups .
regardless of anatomical location at 8 days , the difference between ligated and control mesial pdl - spaces increased negatively and the difference between ligated and control of distal pdl - spaces increased positively with time relative to corresponding control regions ( p < 0.05 ) .
as such , there was a significant difference in pdl - space between ligated and control groups in all regions .
at 15 days , the distal pdl - spaces of ligated coronal regions remained greater than the corresponding control region but decreased in difference , while the distal pdl - spaces of ligated middle and apical regions increased in difference with corresponding control regions .
similarly , the mesial ligated regions still remained smaller than the pdl - spaces of controls ; however , they decreased in difference with the corresponding control regions .
interestingly , only the distal regions exhibited significant differences between ligated and control pdl - space measurements at 15 days .
3.2.3 .
collagen birefringence psr birefringence changes were observed on the distal side depending on the duration of the insult ( figure 5 ( c ) , see figure s1 and supplemental movies in supplementary material available online at http :// dx.doi.org / 10.1155 / 2013 / 876316 ) .
in coronal regions , the ligated complex showed compromised transseptal fiber integrity with decreased birefringence , unlike the observed high birefringence with straight collagen fibers in the control complex .
in apical regions , the width of increased birefringence in the distal pdl - secondary cementum of the ligated complex widened across 4 , 8 , and 15 days ( figure 5 ( c )) .
it should be noted that birefringence is dependent on the angle between the psr - stained specimen and the polarized light .
for a complete representation of the above observation , supplemental movies are included .
3.2.4 .
fn expression at the pdl - bone and pdl - cementum interfaces on the mesial side , fn expressions were illustrated as sharp peaks at both pdl - bone and pdl - cementum interfaces , regardless of the experimental condition and time point .
however , the width of high fn intensity was wider in the ligated group compared to controls ( figures 6 ( a1 ) , 6 ( a3 ) , 6 ( b1 ) , 6 ( b3 ) , 6 ( c1 ) , and 6 ( c3 )) .
on the distal side , the display of fn over a larger width of cementum from the pdl - cementum attachment site was observed .
on the other hand , only a sudden drop of intensity with no peak at the pdl - bone attachment site was shown ( figures 6 ( a2 ) , 6 ( a4 ) , 6 ( b2 ) , 6 ( b4 ) , 6 ( c2 ) , 6 ( c4 ) , and figure s2 ) .
4. discussion the results of this study are from a commonly used experimental rat model for periodontitis [ 40 - 44 ] .
the impetus for choosing the ligature model is that it promotes scenarios similar to food impaction between teeth in humans .
the ligatures between the 1st and 2nd molars and the 2nd and 3rd molars ( figure 1 ( a )) are speculated to promote equal and opposite forces , negating or minimizing effects due to the ligature itself .
additionally , lps was used as a catalyst to accelerate coronal tissue degeneration by inducing hallmarks of periodontitis , such as alveolar crest resorption and pdl degeneration , thus promoting the loss of coronal tooth attachment .
it should be noted that morphometrics , that is , pdl - space can increase or decrease .
as a result , the functional space is either widened or narrowed , which in turn can alter overall biomechanics of the organ .
based on observations from this study , it can be inferred that changes in biochemical expression and / or coronal - apical gradients resulting from inflammation could explain tissue degradation and a subsequent adaptive response driven by mechanobiology .
however , future studies are needed to investigate potential bone formation and resorption effects during disease .
this can be done by temporal mapping of mineral formation - and resorption - related events to elucidate pdl - cementum and pdl - bone interfaces under tension and / or compression using dynamic histomorphometry through a fluorochrome technique .
furthermore , our investigation is limited to the early stage of periodontitis , so a model for chronic periodontitis should be developed through observations made at longer time points by using the proposed endotoxin - ligature model .
the longer ligation times would elucidate time - related mechanobiological effects on overall joint morphology and soft - hard tissue microstructure , including impairment of joint function - - a topic currently under investigation .
the results of this study are discussed on the basis that both disease and function ( continued mastication of hard pellets by the rats ) have a concomitant effect on biochemical and subsequent morphological changes in the organ .
the combined effect can result in positive or negative feedback , thus shifting organ function to impairment .
even though comprehensive studies have postulated a cause - and - effect relationship between bacteria and / or inflammatory cytokines and tissue destruction [ 44 - 51 ] , they are spatially limited and describe only alveolar bone destruction .
as a result , studies are needed to illustrate effects on the entire bone - pdl - cementum complex , in which the role of no one tissue dominates specifically when in function .
hence , the two concomitant effects that will be discussed will include : ( 1 ) inflammation - induced coronal degeneration as a result of lps soaked threads , and ( 2 ) potential mechanobiological effects specifically in the apical regions of the tooth attachment apparatus due to coronal degeneration over time .
to identify a host inflammatory response , we mapped expressions of rankl , osteoclastic resorption , and tnf - alpha .
resulting adaptation was detailed through a change in morphology due to increased alveolar bone resorption and net changes in the pdl - space , coronal losses , apical increases in collagen birefringence within the complex , and a gain in fn expression specifically at the apical regions , that is , within secondary cementum and bone .
these observed patterns are summarized in figures s2 and s3 .
4.1 .
inflammation - related biomolecular expressions within the complex ligature - induced inflammation is a host response to eliminate the harmful stimuli due to foreign body and bacterial colonization .
the response triggers recruitment of immune cells from the blood into various vascularized connective tissues predominantly exposed to lps and ligature impaction [ 27 ] .
the recruited inflammatory cells in turn promote a biochemical cascade , causing proteinase - induced fibrinolysis , osteoclastogenesis , and activation of latent osteoclasts [ 16 ] .
formation and activity of osteoclasts in vivo are dependent on the expression of rankl by osteoblastic or bone marrow stromal cells [ 52 , 53 ] .
as a result , we observed rankl expression in endosteal spaces and vasculature of pdl .
in this study , the coronal part of alveolar bone is most affected by lps due to its proximity to the ligature , and as such the expression of rankl (+) cells near the alveolar crest was quantified ( figures 2 ( d ) and 2 ( e )) .
interestingly , the observed rankl (+) trend opposed the trend of trap (+) osteoclastic activity ( figures 3 ( b )( x ) and 3 ( b )( xi )) .
in other words , the number of rankl (+) cells increased at 4 days before decreasing and then rebounding at 15 days in the distal sides of ligated groups .
it is well known that osteoclastogenesis involves a complex series of sequential steps , including rankl - rank signaling [ 54 ] .
this could explain the observed trend of delayed osteoclastic activity , that is , trap (+) cells .
along with rankl , tnf - alpha also plays a role in inflammatory bone resorption since tnf - alpha synergizes with rankl to potentiate osteoclastogenesis [ 52 , 55 , 56 ] .
the known mechanism by which tnf - alpha modulates bone destruction is related to rankl stimulation of osteoclast differentiation through autocrine signaling [ 57 ] .
the majority of in vivo studies show that tnf - alpha is mainly produced by activated macrophages and acts as an agonist or antagonist to advance or restrain alveolar bone resorption , respectively [ 47 , 58 - 60 ]. from our observation , tnf - alpha was distributed throughout the periodontium ( figure 4 ( a )) .
this can be attributed to immune cells , the source of tnf - alpha that is recruited along the blood stream in highly vascularized pdl .
the overall tnf - alpha expression was elevated in ligated groups , especially at pdl - primary cementum interfaces , the interradicular complex , and endosteal spaces .
this implies that coronally placed ligatures introduced inflammation to the entire bone - pdl - cementum complex and was not just limited to the coronal area .
anatomically , tnf - alpha positive osteoclasts were predominant at the pdl - bone interface on the distal side in ligated groups .
this observation was positively correlated with increased immunofluorescence of rankl in conjunction with previous studies that have shown that tnf - alpha shares the mechanism by which rankl exerts its osteoclastogenic effect [ 26 , 57 ] .
additionally , tnf - alpha was localized to the junctional epithelium .
it is plausible that tnf - alpha released extracellularly drifted into the epithelial layer , since the intercellular space in the junctional epithelium is comparatively wider and contains proportionately fewer desmosomes than in the oral epithelium [ 61 ] , allowing cytokines to permeate epithelium .
4.2 .
changes in morphometrics of the complex , common hallmarks of periodontitis ligated groups showed increased abc and interradicular resorption compared to controls at 4 days .
this observation is most likely caused by the early - stage host inflammatory events due to lps as the primary stimulus .
the argument can be further corroborated by the observation of a decrease in cej - abc distance in mesial regions and a decrease in interradicular pdl - space at 8 days .
however , the decrease in bone resorption despite heightened inflammation could have been caused by age - dependent bone modeling processes [ 42 , 62 ] between 4 and 8 days as bone has a rapid rate of turnover. by 15 days , the resorptive effects of inflammation are speculated to overcome growth - related processes in ligated complexes , resulting in resumed increases of both mesial and distal cej - abc , as well as interradicular pdl - space .
it should be noted that within this observed effect is the effect of osteoclasts in controls due to natural distal resorption in rats [ 31 , 62 , 63 ] .
however , the ligated complex included active osteoclasts on the alveolar crest in addition to the distal pdl - bone interface .
furthermore , the osteoclastic activity peaked at 8 days of ligation .
this phenomenon can be explained in terms of the characteristics of inflammation induced with ligature placement , an acute and short - termed inflammation that resulted in the initial shift of equilibrium from bacterial endotoxin , that is , lps , to host response .
however , the osteoclastic activity was not maintained after 8 days , suggesting that the effect of inflammation induced by ligation was not sustained because ( 1 ) the location of ligature was relatively coronal , and ( 2 ) the host response that could have subsided as the local concentration of lps was diffused [ 64 ] .
this result is consistent with previous studies [ 65 - 69 ] and can be identified as remission of bone modeling following acute phase of inflammation .
4.3 .
resulting early mechanobiological effects of a diseased fibrous joint based on observed morphological differences ( figures 5 ( a ) and 5 ( b )) , we predict that the coronal degeneration could have shifted from physiological to nonphysiological , that is , pathological function .
this shift from physiological to aberrant loads on the complex is hypothesized to be a significant deviation from optimum function .
this is because increased joint mobility due to pdl degeneration and coronal alveolar bone support can cause increased tooth movement with the alveolar socket .
such argument can be further reinforced by the fact that the ligature had to be reintroduced every two to three days in the rats .
based on our previous work , regions that are predicted to experience increased strain during the initial disease stages include coronal attachment sites , apical compression - dominant regions , and predominantly the interradicular regions [ 70 ] ( the pdl - space at the interradicular region is narrower compared to pdl - space around the tooth ( figure 5 ( a ))) .
as such , it is conceivable that , within ligated groups , healthy pdl in interradicular regions , and apical to diseased regions could experience amplified strains during mastication compared to their control counterparts .
additionally , strains could be altered at the pdl - bone and pdl - cementum interfaces [ 71 ] in ligated groups .
these altered three - dimensional strain profiles are of special interest because deviations from normal physiological strain can lead to pathological function ( aberrant loads / function ) , and compromised mechanotransduction over time [ 5 , 72 , 73 ] including the soft - hard tissue interfaces where multiple cell types reside .
ligated groups exhibited different patterns of morphological adaptation over time compared to control groups as indicated by changes in pdl - space .
complementary increase in rankl expression and osteoclast activity , an increase in interradicular pdl - space ( 15 days , figure 5 ( a )( ii )) could indicate excessive strains in the interradicular complex at a later time , resulting in resorption and shifting the adaptive effects of our model to those observed in a hyperocclusion model [ 74 , 75 ] .
as such , it is possible that in our study the interradicular bone commonly known as the fulcrum for tooth rotation [ 70 ] shifted , thus altering the strain field within the entire bone - pdl - cementum complex .
the shift toward aberrant function can promote a net change in the localization and intensity of rankl .
rankl is a mechanosensitive molecule that decreases in expression with tension in osteoblasts [ 76 ] .
when comparing alveolar crests within ligated complexes , rankl expression was seen to increase between 8 and 15 days on the distal side but decreased over time on the mesial side ( figures 2 ( d ) and 2 ( e )) .
although rankl expression increases at each time point between ligated and controls both mesially and distally due to a host inflammatory response , the suggested age dominated mesial - tension due to growth may have counteracted this increase during prolonged mechanical loading .
as such , while a rankl expression increase was seen in 4 - day ligated complexes compared to controls , a similar number of rankl (+) cells were seen between ligated and control complexes at 15 days .
in contrast , the progressive increase of rankl (+) cell count from 8 days to 15 days on the distal side was most likely caused by the compounded effect of compression - induced expression due to distal drift and host inflammatory response [ 77 , 78 ] .
although we correlate rankl expression increase to osteoclast activation , it is important to note that a rankl / osteoprotegerin ( opg ) ratio should be used as the standard index for formative and resorptive bone [ 16 ] .
together , this data suggests that an early host inflammatory response drives increased biochemical expressions coronally .
however , later changes in expressions of respective biomolecules due to opposing mechanobiological effects on mesial and distal sides are induced by aberrant function of the ligated joint .
aberrant function - related effects were seen in secondary cementum .
in this study , the complementary data of collagen birefringence and fn expression seen at the distal secondary cementum is proposed as a compensatory adaptation due to a net increase in distal bone resorption and maintenance of age - related normal physiological activity at the mesial complex ( figure 5 ( c )) .
however , birefringence indicated by psr is only a complementary marker to the more confirmatory fn expression .
this is because collagen birefringence identified through psr staining is also a function of section thickness and is highly dependent on fiber orientation relative to the polarizers ( movies were included to highlight the specificity of our results - - figure s1 and supplemental movies ) and level of tissue demineralization and collagen integrity .
secondary cementum is hypothesized to adapt to occlusion during the posteruption phase of tooth development and has been shown to respond to load [ 35 , 79 ] .
as such , it is conceivable that secondary cementum adaptation would follow coronal bone resorption as a mechanism to compensate for disruption due to inflammation .
in this study , we used two identifiers to detail the adaptation of secondary cementum .
these included collagen birefringence and fn expression [ 24 , 80 , 81 ] .
the triggering of the local biochemical effects caused an increase in apical collagenous matrix organization with time ( figure 5 ( c )) .
as a result , an altered birefringence was observed at the mesial , but higher at the distal pdl - secondary cementum interface in ligated groups ( figure s1 supplemental movies ) .
this implies that inflammation - induced mechanobiology remotely stimulated organic matrix within the apical cementum ( figures 5 ( c ) , 6 , s1 , and s2 ) .
although an increased level of birefringence equivalent to that of controls was observed at 4 days , with increased time , both the width and intensity of birefringence at the distal secondary cementum surface increased .
it is plausible that the complex has adapted to changes resulting from ligature - induced coronal inflammation in the tension - dominant mesial region and the compression - dominant distal region .
however , adaptation manifested itself in apical regions as new bone formation , which was predominant on the mesial side , and new cementum formation on the distal side ( figures 5 ( c ) and 6 ) within respective groups .
the aforementioned secondary cementum adaptation detailed through collagen birefringence can be further strengthened by fn expressions .
nonphysiological tensions at the mesial complex of ligated rats due to coronal degeneration of transseptal and periodontal fibers could have altered the fn mrna expression and protein content apically ( figure 6 ) [ 82 , 83 ] .
the localization pattern of a wide fn expression band apically could be from an increased organization around periphery of osteo - or cementoblast cells and increased density as the collagenous matrix is generated [ 84 ] .
fn is an important chemotactic protein for the storage of growth factors , along with its prolific interactions with cell surface molecules to facilitate cellular adhesion , migration and regulate cellular differentiation and proliferation [ 24 ] .
although fn is not a direct marker for hard - tissue formation using immunohistochemistry , it provides evidence that this multipurpose protein can amplify the response of osteoblast progenitors to alter the regenerative or reparative potential of organic matrices during mechanobiological adaptation [ 83 ] .
the same may hold true for cementoblast progenitors on the tooth side , resulting in mesial deposition of secondary cementum .
while compressive loads have been shown to cause a decrease in fn expression within pdl cells [ 82 , 83 ] , when compared to controls , the distal regions in ligated molars interestingly illustrated increased fn expression at pdl - cementum attachment sites and through the distal precementum layers of the complex ( figure 6 ) .
we summarize the results by presenting a biomechanical model representative of the measured downstream localization and expression level changes of mechanosensitive proteins and net spatiotemporal changes in the pdl - space ( figure s3 ) .
on the distal coronal side , temporal trends of pdl - space were directly correlated with those of osteoclastic activity .
as such , the net increase in pdl - space on the distal coronal side in ligated groups could be explained by an increased osteoclastic activity due to increased compressive strains within the pdl .
increased compression could arise from increased whole body distal rotation of the tooth ( figure s3a.3 ) coupled with coronal inflammation .
in both control and ligated groups , osteoclastic activity increased significantly at 8 days and remained significantly higher at 15 days when compared to 4 - day controls .
while there was greater osteoclastic activity in ligated groups at 8 days compared to the controls , the lack of significant difference between control and ligated groups at both time points could be explained by ( 1 ) development - related changes at early - time points , which may have masked the effect of inflammation and mechanobiological response , and / or ( 2 ) a need for a larger sample size .
however , it is interesting to note that there was a decreased but sustained osteoclastic activity at 15 days , which could have affected the observed pdl - space .
in the apical segment of the distal complex , the trend observed in pdl - space did not correspond to the osteoclastic activity change .
specifically , when correlating trends of osteoclastic activity and pdl - space over time , the increased osteoclastic activity did not match the decreased pdl - space in 8 - day ligated joints .
furthermore , the measured increase in width of fn expression adjacent to the distal secondary cementum , which indicates new cementum apposition , calls for speculation that the pdl - space in this region experienced increased tensile strains during increased distal rotation and vertical displacement ( figure s3a.3 ) .
therefore , the pdl - space is expected to become narrower than that of control groups over time ( figure s3a.4 ) .
however , the opposite morphological change was observed .
the increase in pdl - space of ligated joints at 15 days when compared to controls and 8 - day ligated joints suggests that there was a delay in observable morphological effects ( resorption of bone ) after the increase of osteoclast activity [ 69 ] .
namely , it can be speculated that 8 days of ligation was closer to the beginning of an increase in osteoclastic activity that carried into 15 days of ligation , resulting in an increased pdl - space .
as such , the new cementum apposition labeled by fn could have been missed in micro - xct measurements , since the fn - labeled band indicates a predominance of organic matrix .
therefore , pdl - space could be narrowed with prolonged observation as the cementum layer is given time to mineralize .
further studies identifying cementum growth using fluorochrome technique or cementum - specific markers are necessary and could be used to verify this phenomenon .
similarly , the trends in osteoclastic activity on the mesial side reflected opposite morphological changes in pdl - space at corresponding time points. from a morphological standpoint , the significantly reduced pdl - space in more apical , unaffected regions of ligated fibrous joints can be attributed to increased tensile strains in this area due to coronal degradation [ 70 ] .
although it is well established that experimentally induced periodontitis stimulates inflammation - induced osteoclastic activity , such activity is limited to the coronal regions [ 85 ] .
therefore , the osteoclastic activity observed in more apical regions of ligated complexes could be the manifestation of the resorption / formation coupling of physiological bone turnover [ 86 ] .
however , the amplified strains could have accelerated adaptation of the complex with an increased rate of bone turnover. from a strain localization perspective , these normally compression - dominant regions are predicted to be shifted to tension - dominant regions .
this is due to an apically migrating fulcrum of tooth rotation that stems from the increased mobility of the tooth as a result of coronal attachment loss and resorption of interradicular bone ( figure s3a.3 ) .
our model is also supported by the increased band width of fn expression observed at the pdl bone attachment site at the apical region on the mesial side ( figures 6 ( a3 ) , 6 ( b3 ) , 6 ( c3 ) , and s3a.4 ). from these results , we speculate that disease - related changes promote adaptation of bone and apical cementum , which was predominantly observed on the mesial - coronal and distal - apical sides of the tooth .
it is important to note that the mechanical strains within the complex of a single root are assumed to be similar to strains in the entire complex of a tooth despite the ligature .
hence , the mesiodistal effects discussed in the bone - pdl - tooth complex should be similar to those observed in the corresponding complexes of the mesial and distal roots of the same tooth .
5. conclusions in this present study , we clarified the alteration due to disease by distinguishing disease - induced effects from physiologically determined phenomena with unpaired control groups .
in conclusion , our results showed that coronal induction of an inflammatory perturbation affected the overall distribution of biochemical molecules in the entire complex .
furthermore , concomitant function imposed on the compromised complex could have accelerated tissue adaptation to meet functional demands ( figures s2 and s3 ) .
to be specific , a net decrease in functional space was identified in the mesial complex , whereas a net increase in functional space was identified in the distal complex .
in addition , an adaptive response in secondary cementum , that is , predominant cementum formation , was more apparent distally .
the altered expression at later time points suggests that prolonged function can manifest into excessive loads on the diseased fibrous joint , shifting physiological function into an impaired function when compared to controls .
it is imperative that future studies should measure the biomechanical response of joints that have undergone short - and long - term changes to inflamed and degraded fibrous joints .
when measured , the biomechanical results will validate the proposed model that early morphological changes due to disease can impair function , eventually causing the observed secondary adaptations of the fibrous joint .

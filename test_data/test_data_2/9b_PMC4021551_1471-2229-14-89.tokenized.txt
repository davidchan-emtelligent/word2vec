background the mads - box transcription factors play fundamental roles in reproductive developmental control .
although the roles of many plant mads - box proteins have been extensively studied , there are almost no functional studies of them in soybean , an important protein and oil crop in the world .
in addition , the mads - box protein orthologs may have species - specific functions .
controlling male fertility is an important goal in plant hybrid breeding but is difficult in some crops like soybean .
the morphological structure of soybean flowers prevents the cross - pollination .
understanding the molecular mechanisms for floral development will aid in engineering new sterile materials that could be applied in hybrid breeding programs in soybean .
result through microarray analysis , a flower - enriched gene in soybean was selected and designated as gmmads28 .
gmmads28 belongs to agl9 / sep subfamily of mads - box proteins , localized in nucleus and showed specific expression patterns in floral meristems as well as stamen and petal primordia .
expression of gmmads28 in the stamens and petals of a soybean mutant njs - 10hfs whose stamens are converted into petals was higher than in those of wild - type plants .
constitutive expression of gmmads28 in tobacco promoted early flowering and converted stamens and sepals to petals .
interestingly , transgenic plants increased the numbers of sepal , petal and stamen from five to six and exhibited male sterility due to the shortened and curly filaments and the failure of pollen release from the anthers .
the ectopic expression of gmmads28 was found to be sufficient to activate expression of tobacco homologs of soc1 , leafy , agl8 / ful , and def .
in addition , we observed the interactions of gmmads28 with soybean homologs of soc1 , ap1 , and agl8 / ful proteins .
conclusion in this study , we observed the roles of gmmads28 in the regulation of floral organ number and petal identity .
compared to other plant agl9 / sep proteins , gmmads28 specifically regulates floral organ number , filament length and pollen release .
the sterility caused by the ectopic expression of gmmads28 offers a promising way to genetically produce new sterile material that could potentially be applied in the hybrid breeding of crops like soybean .
fertility floral organ number petal identity glycine max mads - box transcription factors background many transcription factors ( tfs ) that control floral development in model plants , such as arabidopsis , have been identified and constitute a genetic " abc model " for specifying four - whorl floral organs : sepals , petals , stamens , and carpels [ 1,2 ] .
most tfs in the " abc model " are so - called mads - box transcription factors , which play fundamental roles in floral developmental control [ 3 - 5 ] .
the abc model proposes three classes of genes , termed a , b , and c. a genes alone specify sepals , a and b genes together specify petals , and b gene expression in combination with a c gene specifies stamens .
carpel formation is dependent on c gene expression alone .
in addition , the abcd model was suggested when floral binding protein 11 ( fbp11 ) , termed a d - class gene , was confirmed to determine the ovule [ 6 ] .
although abc genes are critical for floral organ identity , their expression levels are not sufficient to convert leaves into floral organs , indicating that other genes are required .
further studies in arabidopsis have identified e genes ( sepallata1 - 4 , previously named agl2 , agl4 , agl9 , and agl3 ) , which are required to specify the identity of all four whorls of the floral organs and floral meristem determinacy [ 7 - 11 ] .
accordingly , the abcde model was proposed [ 12 - 14 ] .
the sepallata ( sep ) or sep - like genes have been described necessary , albeit redundantly , for the normal development of petals , stamens , carpels , and sepals [ 8,13,15 ] .
it has been proposed that the sep proteins could constitute higher - order complexes with a , b , or c proteins [ 8,13,15 ] , and at least one sep protein is present in more than half of the 106 multimeric complexes identified through a large - scale yeast three - hybrid screen [ 16 ] .
sep proteins are necessary for the formation of the transcription factor complexes that control ovule development [ 17 ] .
a single sep mutant shows either a subtle or no phenotype , whereas the sep1 / 2 / 3 / 4 mutant displays indeterminate flowers composed of only leaf - like organs ; even sepal development is dependent on sep function [ 10 ] .
although sep4 is involved redundantly with the other sep genes in the development of all floral organs , the sep1 / 2 / 3 / 4 quadruple mutant exhibits the more extreme phenotype of the loss of floral meristem identity compared to the sep1 / 2 / 3 triple mutants [ 10 ] .
additionally , the sep3 mutation alone leads to a partial transformation of the petals into sepals , suggesting that sep3 plays more predominant role in floral organ development than other sep proteins [ 10 ] .
sep3 strongly activates the expression of the a gene ap1 , b gene ap3 , and c gene ag ; these factors are the major protein interaction partners of sep3 , suggesting that sep3 can activate the flower developmental program by enhancing the expression of its interaction partners [ 18 ] .
the mutation of a rice sep - like gene , osmads34 / pap2 , altered inflorescence morphology and increased the number of primary branches but decreased the number of secondary branches [ 19,20 ] .
moreover , osmads34 mutant displayed a decreased spikelet number and had lemma / leaf - like elongated sterile lemmas .
similar to the sep1 / 2 / 3 / 4 mutants of arabidopsis , knock - down of the four rice sep - like genes led to homeotic transformation of all the floral organs , except the lemma , into leaf - like organs , suggesting the conservation of sep - like genes in specifying floral determinacy and organ identity in both eudicots and monocots [ 21 ] .
the phenotypes of transgenic plants constitutively expressing sep genes have been analyzed to further study their functions .
pelaz et al .
[ 22 ] found that the overproduction of sep3 in arabidopsis led to early flowering and that the secondary shoots were transformed into solitary flowers .
furthermore , the ectopic expression of sep3 was found to be sufficient to activate other b and c genes , and the constitutive expression of sep3 and leafy , a floral meristem identity gene , produced ectopic petals , carpels , and ovules outside of the floral context [ 23 ] .
zhao et al .
[ 24 ] found that the ectopic expression of a wheat sep - like gene , tamads1 , caused early flowering and altered the development of all floral organs , including sepals converted into leaf - like structures and decreases in the petal and stamen number .
the overexpression of sep3 genes from tobacco and rice in arabidopsis or tobacco promotes early flowering but does not significantly affect floral morphology [ 25,26 ] .
soybean ( glycine max [ l. ] merr. ) is an important global crop that provides protein and oil .
understanding of the processes that occur during soybean reproductive development and the identification of the genes responsible for developmental processes is important for soybean breeding .
however , only a few reproductive - related genes have been identified in soybean , including gmap1 [ 27 ] , gmnmh7 [ 28 ] , and gmgal1 [ 29 ] .
additionally , none of these soybean mads - box genes were shown to alter floral morphology .
as an attempt to understand flower developmental process in soybean and genetically modify soybean floral morphology for breeding applications , we identified 28 flower - enriched transcription factors in soybean through a microarray analysis [ 30 ] .
here , we report the functions of gmmads28 which plays pivotal roles in the regulation of floral organ number and petal identity .
the sterility caused by the ectopic expression of gmmads28 offers a promising approach to genetically produce new sterile material that could potentially be applied in crop hybrid breeding. through the identification of more genes related with soybean flower , engineering soybean sterile materials applied in hybrid breeding programs will be possible .
results gmmads28 is a member of class e mads - box genes among 28 transcription factor genes predominantly expressed in soybean flowers [ 30 ] , a soybean homolog ( gma.17031.1.a1 _ at ) of arabidopsis agl9 / sep3 was selected for further analysis in the present study .
the microarray data were confirmed by real - time qpcr ( figure 1a ) .
we named this gene gmmads28 because it showed the highest similarity with arabidopsis sep3 .
first , we cloned the cdna fragment of gmmads28 via rt - pcr from soybean flowers. through race - pcr , we assembled and cloned the full - length cdna of gmmads28 , which is 1,026 bp in length and contains an orf of 732 bp. the sequence of gmmads28 has been deposited in genbank / embl under accession number aj878424 .

the black and white boxes represent exons and introns , respectively .
( c ) phylogenetic analysis of gmmads28 and other plant sep proteins .
the neighbor - joining tree was constructed by mega 4.0 based on 1,000 bootstrap replicates .
( d ) subcellular localization of gmmads28 - gfp fusion protein .
comparison of the gmmads28 cdna and soybean genomic dna sequences suggested that gmmads28 contains eight exons and seven introns. by comparison of the exon - intron structures of gmmads28 and other plant mads - box genes , we found that gmmads28 and other plant sep genes share the same numbers of exons and introns ; each exon size is highly conserved , whereas the intron size is divergent ( figure 1b ) .
the maize ag gene zag2 has seven exons , though the sizes of the first six exons covering the mads - and k - domains are similar to those of gmmads28 .
these results suggested that sequence alteration in the mads - box genes during genome duplications , particularly in the 3 ' region , might have resulted in divergent subfamilies of plant mads - box proteins .
the deduced gmmads28 protein contains 243 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 27.9 kda .
database searches suggested that gmmads28 is homologous to arabidopsis sep3 ( identity of 74 % and similarity of 83 %) , sep1 ( identity of 59 % and similarity of 71 %) , sep2 ( identity of 60 % and similarity of 71 %) , and sep4 ( identity of 47 % , and similarity of 64 %) .
the alignment of gmmads28 and the other plant mads - box proteins showed that the amino acid sequences in the mads domains were highly conserved .
in addition to the mads domain , the intergenic region ( i region ) , k - box , and a c - terminal region ( c region ) are included in each mads - box protein .
moreover , a potential phosphorylation site , rqvtf , for calmodulin - dependent protein kinases and three common sequences , the " sep motif i " , " sep / agl6 motif " , and " sep motif ii " [ 31,32 ] , were found in all the analyzed sep proteins , including gmmads28 .
to address relationship of gmmads28 to other plant sep proteins , a neighbor - joining phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the alignment of amino acid sequences from the plant sep proteins ( figure 1c ) .
the tree showed that gmmads28 was grouped into the plant sep3 subfamily .
in particular , gmmads28 was closer to lotus japonicas ljsep3 and arabidopsis sep3 .
these results suggest that gmmads28 is an e gene ; based on the tree and highest sequence identity between gmmads28 and sep3 .
gmmads28 is localized in the nucleus to assess the subcellular localization of gmmads28 , we fused the full - length orf of gmmads28 to the green fluorescence protein ( gfp ) reporter gene under the control of the camv35s promoter to generate the construct 35s : gmmads28 - gfp .
the construct and the empty vector were transformed into onion epidermal cells via agrobacterium - mediated transformation .
confocal imaging of gfp fluorescence showed that the gmmads28 - gfp fusion protein was localized to the nucleus ; in contrast , the gfp fluorescence was distributed throughout the cells when the cells were transformed with gfp alone ( figure 1d ) .
transcripts of gmmads28 accumulate predominantly in reproductive organs , especially in petals the expression profiles of the gmmads28 in various soybean tissues were investigated by semi - quantitative rt - pcr .
various soybean tissues , including leaf , flower , root , shoot apex , seed , stem , and pod , were collected .
the expression analysis showed that the gmmads28 mrna was clearly detected in the reproductive organs , including the flower , seed , and pod , but not in the leaf or root ( figure 2 ) .
weak expression of gmmads28 in the vegetative shoot apex was also found ( figure 2 ) .
to further analyze the expression of gmmads28 in flowers , we examined the expression of gmmads28 in the four whorl organs : sepal , petal , stamen , and carpel .
as shown in figure 2 , gmmads28 was clearly detected in all four organs and showed the highest expression in petals .
figure 2 gmmads28 expression in different tissues of soybean by semi - quantitative rt - pcr analysis.actin gene was used as the reference gene .
because gmmads28 was highly expressed in developing seeds ( figure 2 ) , it is of interest to investigate whether gmmads28 is involved in soybean seed development .
thus , we performed a semi - quantitative rt - pcr assay to analyze the time - course expression pattern of gmmads28 during soybean seed development .
the results showed that gmmads28 was highly expressed at 15 and 20 daf ( days after flowering ) but was down - regulated thereafter , with the lowest level at 35 daf ; the expression of gmmads28 increased gradually after 40 daf ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) .
these results suggested that gmmads28 may play some roles at the early and late stages of seed development .
in situ localization of gmmads28 transcript to further analyze the spatial distribution of gmmads28 , mrna in situ hybridization was employed to detect floral mrna expression .
in the early stages of flower development , transcripts of gmmads28 were localized in the floral meristem ( figure 3b ) , and in the stamen and petal primordia ( figure 3c - d ) .
in the late stages of flower development , transcripts of gmmads28 were detected in the stamens , petals , and ovules ( figure 3e - f ) .

gmmads28 promotes early flowering to analyze the biological role of gmmads28 , we ectopically expressed the gmmads28 gene in tobacco ( figure 4a ) and obtained 13 independent transgenic lines overexpressing gmmads28 confirmed by rt - pcr analysis ( additional file 2 : figure s2 ) .
we found that all positive 35s : gmmads28 plants flowered significantly earlier than the wild - type plants .
as the plants have a fixed number of leaves when flowering under the same environment , a comparison of the flowering time was evaluated by the leaf number .
the 35s : gmmads28 plants produced an average of only 22 leaves when flowering , whereas the wild - type plants produced approximately 34 leaves ( figure 4b ) .
the 35s : gmmads28 plants also exhibited reduced plant height compared to the wild - type plants ( figure 4c ) .

ectopic expression of gmmads28 affects morphology of floral organs the gmmads28 over - expression lines exhibited remarkable morphological alterations in the floral organs .
in wild - type plants , the number of petals , stamens , and sepals is five , but six 35s : gmmads28 lines displayed six for each organ ( figure 5a - c , e - h ) .
interestingly , antisense expression of gmmads28 in transgenic tobacco reduces the numbers of petals from five to four but the numbers of other three whorl organs are still five ( figure 5d ) .
besides , four 35s : gmmads28 lines converted the stamens into petals and two converted the sepals into petals .
the ectopic expression of gmmads28 could convert the sepals and stamens into petals ( figure 5i , j ) , implying the regulation by gmmads28 in petal identity .

moreover , the sepals of the three 35s : gmmads28 transgenic lines were more similar to the carpels than to the sepals of the wild - type plant ( figure 6a - c ) .
the inner and outer epidermal cells of the tobacco sepal , which are characterized by the presence of globular - tipped trichomes , stomata , and irregularly shaped cells , were used for scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) analysis ( figure 6d , g ) .
however , similar to the wild - type carpel , the inner and outer epidermal cells in the 35s : gmmads28 sepals were regular rectangular - shaped cells ( figure 6e - f , h - i ) .
these results suggest that gmmads28 might involve in the carpel identity .

35s : gmmads28 plants are sterile due to physical alterations in floral structure the 35s : gmmads28 plants were sterile .
to investigate the factors causing sterility , we examined the morphological structure of the floral organs .
as shown in figure 7 , eleven 35s : gmmads28 lines showed shortened and curly filaments , with the filament being shorter than the pistil ( figure 7c , d ) .
the lengths of the filaments were measured before and after stretching .
the filament length of 35s : gmmads28 was significantly shorter than that of wild - type ( figure 7e ) , and the stamens could not reach the stigma due to such a shortened filament .
the sem analysis on the outer epidermal cells of the filaments was performed to analyze the reason for the shortened filaments .
compared to the wild - type filaments , which contain normal cells ( figure 7f ) , the 35s : gmmads28 filaments only have cellular wrinkles , which may lead to curly filaments ( figure 7g ) .

in addition to shorter filaments , most of the 35s : gmmads28 anthers cannot split normally , and the pollens cannot be released ( figure 8a - b ) .
to reveal the formation of the unopened anthers , the anthers from 35s : gmmads28 and wild - type plants were collected at four flower development stages , and the anther morphology of paraffin sections was compared using a microscope .
it was found that there were no significant differences between 35s : gmmads28 and wild - type at the beginning stages of anther maturation ( figure 8c , stages 1 to 2 ) .
however , although pollenss were released with the maturation of the wild type ( wt ) anthers ( figure 8c , stages 3 to 4 ) , the 35s : gmmads28 anthers could not split ( figure 8c , stages 3 to 4 ) and the pollens were not released .

gmmads28 activates the expression of soc1 , leafy , agl8 / ful and def based on the function of gmmads28 revealed by its constitutive expression , we studied the expression of 9 genes involved in flowering time or organ identity in the 35s : gmmads28 leaves .
it was observed that the tobacco homologs of the flowering time genes soc1 and leafy , a gene agl8 / ful , and b gene def were more accumulated in 35s : gmmads28 compared to wild - type leaves ( figure 9 ) , suggesting that gmmads28 might directly regulate the expression of these genes , thereby controlling flowering time and petal identity .
figure 9 expression of 9 mads - box genes in 35 : gmmads28 leaves .
semi - quantitative rt - pcr analysis showed the expression of 9 mads - box genes involved in flowering time ( soc1 , lfy ) and floral organ development in tobacco leaves .
these tobacco genes are the closest homologues of the corresponding arabidopsis genes .
the accession numbers for these genes are shown in additional file 4 : table s1 .
gmmads28 is involved in the conversion of stamens to petals in a soybean mutant the 35s : gmmads28 transgenic tobacco plants exhibited the conversion of stamens to petals , which is also the phenotype of soybean mutant njs - 10hfs [ 30,33 ] ( figure 10a ) .
compared to wild - type soybean stamens , the top areas of most stamens are converted to petal - like structure in njs - 10hfs .
therefore , it is of interest to investigate the expression of gmmads28 in the flower organs of this mutant .
we found that expression of gmmads28 in the stamens and petals in njs - 10hfs was higher than in wild - type njs - 10hff ( figure 10b , c ) .
the expression of gmmads28 was particularly higher in the mutant stamens (~ 50 folds ) compared to wild - type ( figure 10c ) , suggesting that the up - regulation of gmmads28 may play a critical role in the conversion of stamens to petals in this soybean mutant .

gmmads28 interacts with soybean homologs of soc1 , ap1 , and agl8 / ful as mads - box proteins can form different complexes with different functions during floral development , we screened for interacting partners of gmmads28 by yeast two hybrid assay using a cdna library prepared from soybean flowers .
a total of five proteins ( gmsip1 ~ gmsip5 ) , including soybean homologs of agl8 / ful , soc1 , and ap1 proteins , an enth / vhs family protein [ 34 ] , and an unknown protein , were shown to interact with gmmads28 ( table 1 , additional file 3 : figure s3 ) .
these proteins may form complexes with gmmads28 and function in the regulation of flowering time and floral development .

sep3 is expressed throughout flower development , from the floral meristem to the fully developed floral organs [ 35 ] .
the sep3 genes are expressed in the inner three floral whorls of all species , with the exception of aranda adom1 , which is not expressed in stamens and carpels [ 36 ] .
gmmads28 also showed a weak expression in the soybean shoot apices in addition to flowers and seeds , indicating that gmmads28 might also participate in biological events in the shoot apices .
in fact , gerbera ghgrcd2 is also expressed in vegetative tissues [ 11 ] .
although gmmads28 was expressed in all the reproductive organs analyzed , including the four whorl organs , it showed the highest expression level in petals , suggesting that gmmads28 might play an important role in general flower development but is particularly involved in controlling the identity and development of soybean petals .
to further explore the gmmads28 function , we ectopically expressed the gmmads28 gene in tobacco and found that gmmads28 promotes early flowering .
many studies have shown that the overexpression of sep3 - like gene leads to early flowering [ 23,25,37,38 ] .
in arabidopsis , the sep3 protein is potentially incorporated into complexes with proteins involved in flowering time , such as soc1 , agl24 , svp , and agl15 [ 16 ] .
the arabidopsis soc1 - like genes agl42 , agl71 , and agl72 promote flowering in the shoot apical and axillary meristems [ 39 ] .
interestingly , our data showed that gmmads28 activates the expression of the tobacco homologs of leafy and soc1 , implying that the activated expression of these two genes may lead to early flowering .
however , soc1 was shown to be directly down - regulated by sep3 in arabidopsis [ 18 ] .
these contrasting observations may be due to the different plant systems .
enhanced early flowering was also observed in arabidopsis plants over - expressing both sep3 and ap1 genes compared to plants over - expressing ap1 alone [ 22 ] .
similarly , we observed that the ectopically expression of soybean gmap1 also promotes early flowering in arabidopsis [ 27 ] .
these results suggest that gmmads28 and ap1 may be incorporated into the mads - box protein complex to cooperatively regulate flowering time , which is also supported by the interaction of the gmmads28 and ap1 proteins by yeast two - hybrid assay .
in arabidopsis , sep genes are involved in the development of all four - whorl floral organs and that constitutive expression of sep3 promotes the homeotic transformation of sepals and inflorescence meristems into carpelloid structures , including ovules [ 23 ] .
in the present study , a number of floral developmental alterations were observed in gmmads28 transgenic plants .
interestingly , not all transgenic plants showed the same / similar phenotypes , which is likely because that gmmads28 as an e - type gene plays a wide role in all most aspects of floral development and different expression level and genome insertion location may influence the phenotypes .
even in one plant , not all the flowers showed the same phenotypes .
for example , in the lines with increased number of floral organs , about half of the flowers altered organ number , while in the sterile lines , all the flowers are sterile .
ectopic expression of gmmads28 promoted the development of extra set of floral organs in transgenic tobacco , implying the critical and positive role of gmmads28 in the formation of floral organs .
interestingly , the antisense expression of gmmads28 decreased the petal number from five to four , which might have resulted from the decrease of native sep3 expression in the tobacco flowers .
in contrast , zhao et al .
[ 24 ] found that the ectopic expression of a wheat sep - like gene , tamads1 , decreased the petal and stamen number , suggesting that different sep proteins might play diverse roles in the regulation of floral development .
our data suggest that gmmads28 is involved in the formation of four - whorl organs and is particularly required for normal petal and stamen development .
the a , b , c , and sep proteins likely act as multimeric complexes to activate downstream genes [ 8,10,22,40 ] .
the expression analysis of several abc genes in 35 : gmmads28 leaves suggests that the ectopic expression of gmmads28 itself could activate the expression of the def and agl8 / ful genes .
the multimeric complexes formed with activated abc proteins and gmmads28 may promote the production of extra organs in the transgenic plants .
the ectopic expression of gmmads28 mediated the conversion of stamens and sepals into petals in transgenic tobacco .
in our previous study , we identified a soybean mutant [ 33 ] with a phenotype similar to 35s : gmmads28 , with the conversation of stamens into petals .
interestingly , the expression of gmmads28 in the stamens of the soybean mutant was significantly increased compared to the wild - type plants , and the mrna in situ localization analysis proved the predominant expression of gmmads28 in the petal meristem of soybean .
these results indicate that gmmads28 plays a critical and positive role on the b function .
our data showed that ectopic expression of gmmads28 activates the expression of b gene def [ 41 ] in tobacco leaves , suggesting that the ectopic expression of gmmads28 can confer b function .
moreover , an a class gene , agl8 / ful , was activated by gmmads28 .
recently , it was found that ful - like genes also control flowering time and petal identity in opium poppy [ 42 ] .
carpel - like sepals were observed in some of the 35s : gmmads28 plants and the constitutive expression of sep3 resulted in the homeotic transformation of sepals and inflorescence meristems into carpelloid structures in arabidopsis [ 23 ] .
it has been described that both sep3 and ag are required for functional c activity [ 10,40 ] and that sep3 could ectopically activate ag [ 23 ] in 35s : sep3 leaves .
however , unlike arabidopsis , the expression of ag was not significantly regulated by gmmads28 in our study , suggesting that gmmads28 might have an ag - independent role in the formation of carpel - like sepals .
controlling male fertility is an important goal for breeding hybrid crops , and male sterility is associated with the failure of pollination in addition to the lack of viable pollen or pollen activity .
we observed that the 35s : gmmads28 plants are sterile , which was caused by two major factors , shortened and curly filaments and the failure of pollen release , which are new findings of sep3 function .
at the beginning stages of anther maturation , there were no significant differences between 35s : gmmads28 and the wild type plants .
the epidermal cells absorb water from the endothecium cells due to transpiration during anther maturation , which may produce tension in the un - thickened , adjacent regions of the two pollen sacs .
for normal anthers , further water loss during maturation causes the parenchyma tissue between the pollen sacs to rupture easily under the tension developed by the endothecium , thus releasing the pollen .
for 35s : gmmads28 anthers , it is hypothesized that the endothecium cells are thickened and the shriveled connection of the cellulose ca n't pull out the easy - rupture region , the tension was not sufficient to split the anthers ; therefore , the pollen grains ca n't be released .
unlike the role of gmmads28 , the overexpression of the sep3 genes from arabidopsis , tobacco , and rice in wild - type arabidopsis or tobacco promotes early flowering but does not significantly affect floral morphology [ 22,25,26 ] .
these results suggest that plant sep3 proteins have common functions in the regulation of flowering time .
in this study , we observed the roles of sep3 proteins in the regulation of floral organ number and petal identity .
more importantly , the sterility caused by the ectopic expression of gmmads28 offers a promising way to genetically produce new sterile material that could potentially be applied in the hybrid breeding of crops like soybean .
conclusion the molecular regulations on reproductive development in soybean are largely unknown .
additionally , controlling the fertility is an important goal in plant hybrid breeding but is difficult in some crops including soybean. through microarray analysis , a flower - enriched gene gmmads28 encoding a mads - box transcription factor was cloned from soybean .
gmmads28 belongs to e - type gene and may play a wide role in reproductive development .
it was observed that constitutive expression of gmmads28 in tobacco caused a number of reproductive development changes , including early flowering , conversion of stamens and sepals to petals , increased numbers of sepal , petal and stamens and carpel - like sepals .
in particular , ectopic expression of gmmads28 caused sterility due to the shortened and curly stalks and the failure of pollen release from the anthers .
gmmads28 is thus a potential target gene for engineering the male sterile plants .
moreover , gmmads28 was found to activate the tobacco homologs of soc1 , leafy , agl8 / ful and def and interact with soybean homologs of soc1 , ap1 and agl8 / ful proteins , which provides the new clues in understanding the functional mechanisms for e - type proteins in plant reproductive development .
methods plant materials the soybean ( glycine max l. merr .
cv jackson ) seeds used in this study were obtained from national center for soybean improvement , nanjing agricultural university , china , and germinated in the experimental field of nanjing agricultural university .
mature leaves ( fully expanded ) , roots , flowers ( including flower buds and mature flowers ) , and pods at 20 days after flowering ( daf ) were collected for the real - time rt - pcr analysis .
mature leaves ( fully expanded ) , roots , stems ( including internodes and nodes ) , and shoot apices were collected separately at the stage of the sixth expanding true leaf for semi - quantitative rt - pcr .
at the flowering stage , mixed flowers ( including flower buds and mature flowers ) , sepals , petals , stamens , and carpels were collected .
seeds were collected at 15 , 20 , 25 , 35 , 40 , 45 , and 50 days after flowering .
cloning of gmmads28 to amplify a fragment ( probe id : gma.17031.1.a1 _ at ) of gmmads28 , we first obtained the expressed sequence tag ( est ) sequence for gma.17031.1.a1 _ at by searching the affymetrix website ( https :// www.affymetrix.com /) using the netaffx tool .
a pair of primers ( forward , 5 ' - gagatgggaaggggaagagt - 3 ; reverse , 5 ' - acaaattggatatcatcctg - 3 ') was synthesized for rt - pcr and used with flower cdna as the template .
the pcr conditions were as follows : 0.5 mul flower cdna was amplified in a 25 mul volume containing 2.5 mul pcr buffer with mgcl2 , 0.5 mul 20 mm dntps , 1 mul tag polymerase , and 0.5 mul each specific primer ( 25 mm ) .
the pcr amplification was performed using a dna amplification machine ( mj , usa ) with an initial denaturation at 94degreesc for 5 min , 33 cycles of 94degreesc for 30s , 55degreesc for 50s , and 72degreesc for 1 min , and a final 72degreesc for 10 min .
the pcr products were gel - purified , cloned into the pgem - t vector ( promega , usa ) , and sequenced ( invitrogen , shanghai , china ) .
rapid amplification of cdnas ( race ) was employed with smart race technology ( clontech , usa ) to obtain the full - length cdna for gmmads28 .
to amplify the full - length cdna of gmmads28 , the following pair of primers was used for rt - pcr : forward , 5 ' - gagatgggaaggggaagagt - 3 ' , and reverse , 5 ' - caaggaagaggctagctagg - 3 ' .
real - time rt - pcr real - time qpcr was performed in an optical 96 - well plate using a bio - rad iq5 real - time pcr system ( bio - rad , usa ) , as previously described [ 30 ] .
the soybean actin gene ( genbank accession no. v00450 ) served as a reference gene .
the threshold cycle ( ct ) values of the triplicate pcrs were averaged , and the relative quantification of the transcript levels was performed using the comparative ct method .
to verify the microarray data for gmmads28 expression , the relative quantification relates the pcr signal of the target transcript in the roots , flower mixtures , or pods to that in the leaves .
the fold change was determined by the following formula : fold change = 2 - deltadeltact , where deltadeltact = ( cttarget gene - ctactin ) flowers,roots , or pods - ( cttarget gene - ctactin ) leaves .
for the analysis of gmmads28 expression in the soybean mutant , the relative quantification relates the pcr signal of the target transcript in the organs of the mutant to that of the wild - type plant .
the fold change was determined by the following formula : fold change = 2 - deltadeltact , where deltadeltact = ( cttarget gene - ctactin ) mutant - ( cttarget gene - ctactin ) wild - type plant .
semi - quantitative rt - pcr semi - quantitative rt - pcr was performed as previously described [ 30 ] .
as a control , a 683 bp pcr fragment of the constitutively expressed soybean actin gene was amplified .
the primers for gmmads28 were as follows : sense , 5 ' - gagatgggaaggggaagagt - 3 ' , and reverse , 5 ' - caaggaagaggctagctagg - 3 ' .
for the rt - pcr analysis of nine tobacco mads - box genes , total rna was prepared from the leaves of the wild type and five 35s : gmmads28 plants .
the tobacco ef - 1alpha gene was used as an internal control .
the primers for each tobacco mads - box gene are shown in additional file 4 : table s1 .
rna in situ hybridization longitudinal and cross sections of soybean flowers were prepared as previously described [ 27,43 ] .
rna antisense and sense probes were generated from a 281 bp fragment of the 3 ' region of the gmmads28 cdna labeled with digoxigenin .
the rna in situ hybridization was performed as previously described [ 27 ] .
subcellular localization to produce the gmmads28 - gfp construct , gmmads28 was fused in - frame to the 5 ' terminus of the green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) reporter gene under the control of the camv35s promoter .
the following primers was used for the gmmads28 - gfp construction : 5 ' - gagatgggaaggggaagagt - 3 ' ( forward ) , and 5 ' - caaggaagaggctagctagg - 3 ' ( reverse ) .
the construct was then used in agrobacterium - mediated transient expression in onion epidermal cells .
the cells were examined by confocal laser - scanning microscopy ( leica tcs sp2 , mannheim , germany ) .
ectopic expression in tobacco to address the function of gmmads28 , the sense and antisense gmmads28 sequence were cloned into the plant binary vector pbi121 .
the recombinant plasmids were used for tobacco ( nicotianatabacum cv. samsun ) transformation via the leaf disk transformation method [ 44 ] .
cell morphological analysis tobacco anthers were collected at flower lengths of 0.2 , 0.5 , 1 , and 3 cm , fixed with carnoy 's fluid ( ethanol : glacial acetic acid = 3:1 ) for up to 24 hours at room temperature , and then preserved in 70 % ethanol at 4degreesc .
after embedding in paraffin , the blocks were trimmed as necessary and cut into 8 - 10 mum sections using a leica rm2135 microtome .
these sections were stained with safranin and stained again with fast green .
after mounting the sections onto slides , the tissues were observed and photographed with a microscope ( leica dmlb ) .
yeast two - hybrid assay as the full - length gmmads28 protein has transcriptional activation ability ( data not shown ) , the cdna sequence encoding gmmads28incrementc lacking the activation domain ( 185 - 243 ) was used to construct the gal4 - bd fusion pdest32 - gmmads28incrementc as the bait plasmid and used to screen a yeast cdna library prepared from soybean flowers .
the positive clones were then verified by retransformation and subjected to beta - galactosidase assay .

lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer - related death , with more than half the patients having advanced - stage disease at the time of initial diagnosis and thus facing a poor prognosis .
this dire situation poses a need for new approaches in prevention and treatment .
peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ( ppargamma ) is a ligand - activated transcription factor belonging to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily .
its involvement in adipocyte differentiation and glucose and lipid homeostasis is well - recognized , but accumulating evidence now suggests that ppargamma may also function as a tumor suppressor , inhibiting development of primary tumors and metastases in lung cancer and other malignancies .
besides having prodifferentiation , antiproliferative , and proapoptotic effects , ppargamma agonists have been shown to prevent cancer cells from acquiring the migratory and invasive capabilities essential for successful metastasis .
angiogenesis and secretion of certain matrix metalloproteinases and extracellular matrix proteins within the tumor microenvironment are also regulated by ppargamma .
this review of the current literature highlights the potential of ppargamma agonists as novel therapeutic modalities in lung cancer , either as monotherapy or in combination with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy .

introduction lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer - related death , accounting for more than 25 % of the total [ 1 ] .
it falls into two major categories , small cell lung cancer ( sclc ) and non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) .
nsclc , comprising adenocarcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , and large cell carcinoma , is more common , amounting to as much as 85 % of all lung cancers , while sclc represents the remaining 15 % [ 2 , 3 ] .
unlike many other cancers that have seen great improvement in 5 - year survival during the last 3 decades , the 5 - year relative survival of all patients with lung cancer remains below 18 % [ 1 , 4 ] .
this is partially because more than half of lung cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage [ 1 ] , with 5 - year survival of approximately 2 % in this group [ 4 ] , but also because progress in treatment has been slow [ 1 ] .
thus , new approaches to prevention , early detection , and treatment are urgently needed to enhance clinical outcomes .
many tumors arise as a consequence of cells acquiring the ability to dedifferentiate or elude terminal differentiation , to proliferate in an unrestricted manner , and to escape apoptosis .
therapeutic intervention to reverse these processes thus remains an important strategy in cancer treatment .
one approach that has attracted much interest is activation of nuclear hormone receptors , which has shown therapeutic potential in several major human diseases [ 5 , 6 ] ; agonists for estrogen receptor - beta , retinoic acid receptor - alpha , and retinoid x receptor have demonstrated prodifferentiation , antiproliferative , and / or proapoptotic effects in a variety of cancers and cancer - related systems [ 7 ] .
another family of nuclear hormone receptors , the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors ( ppars ) , has been long recognized for its role in regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism [ 8 , 9 ] .
it is now known that ppars also regulate other cellular processes , among which are carcinogenesis - relevant cell differentiation , proliferation , survival , and apoptosis [ 10 - 12 ] , with these effects being mediated via transcriptional activation or repression of ppar target genes [ 9 ] .
three ppar members , pparalpha , pparbeta / delta , and ppargamma , encoded by separate genes , are present in humans [ 13 ] , and each shows a distinct structure and function [ 9 ] .
although each is found ubiquitously throughout the body , expression levels can vary widely between tissues and the pattern is unique to each receptor type [ 14 - 16 ] .
the role of ppargamma in lung cancer biology is better understood and its potential role as a tumor suppressor is better characterized than those of pparalpha or pparbeta / delta [ 17 ] .
ppargamma is transcribed from one of three mrnas - - gamma1 , gamma2 , and gamma3 - - that differ in sites of transcriptional initiation and splicing [ 18 - 20 ] .
ppargamma1 mrna is found ubiquitously in humans [ 18 ] , but expression of ppargamma2 and ppargamma3 mrnas is more restricted [ 13 ] .
interestingly , gamma1 and gamma3 mrnas translate into indistinguishable proteins [ 20 ] , resulting in detection of only two protein isoforms - - ppargamma1 and ppargamma2 - - in humans , with ppargamma1 being more common than ppargamma2 [ 19 ] .
ppargamma , initially known as a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation and glucose and lipid homeostasis [ 9 , 18 ] , has now demonstrated its involvement in the biology of lung cancer , as discussed in detail below , as well as in a wide variety of other cancers [ 17 ] .
both sclc and nsclc express ppargamma [ 21 - 25 ] .
however , the receptor is believed to be inactive in lung cancer cells , as suggested by cytoplasmic accumulation that reflects activation failure , perhaps due to some modification in its functional domains or to the absence of ligands in these cells [ 26 ] .
indeed , somatic loss - of - function mutations in the ppargamma gene have been identified and implicated in the sporadic development of colorectal carcinomas ; these mutations were shown to result in defective ligand binding and / or transcriptional activity [ 27 ] .
an immunohistological analysis of 147 primary nsclc tumor specimens also revealed that ppargamma expression correlates with histological type and grade [ 10 , 28 ] ; well - differentiated adenocarcinoma shows higher ppargamma expression than poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma .
these studies provide evidence for the significance of ppargamma in lung cancer .
a number of ppargamma ligands , both natural and synthetic , have been identified .
naturally occurring molecules including saturated and unsaturated fatty acids , eicosanoid derivatives such as 15 - deoxy - delta12,14 - prostaglandin j2 ( 15d - pgj2 ) , and nitrated fatty acids such as nitrated linoleic acid and nitrated oleic acid can activate ppargamma [ 18 , 29 , 30 ] .
certain synthetic compounds , predominantly represented by thiazolidinediones ( tzds ) such as pioglitazone , rosiglitazone , troglitazone , and ciglitazone , have also been recognized as potent ppargamma agonists [ 18 ] .
binding of these agonists activates transcriptional activity of ppargamma by displacing corepressors that maintain the receptor in its inactive state and allowing it to heterodimerize with retinoid x receptors and bind to specific peroxisome proliferator response elements in the promoter regions of its target genes [ 9 ] .
accumulating evidence demonstrates that ppargamma agonists / activation are antitumorigenic in most cases , hindering proliferation , growth , and progression and inducing differentiation and apoptosis in lung cancer [ 15 , 17 , 23 , 25 ] .
the potential of ppargamma agonists as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of lung cancer is thus compelling .
2. ppargamma in lung cancer : multifaceted effect manifold molecular mechanisms underlie the antitumor effects of ppargamma and its activation in lung cancer .
its influence is exerted not only on cancer cells but also on the surrounding tumor microenvironment harboring noncancerous elements such as cells of the immune system , fibroblasts , adipocytes , and blood and lymphatic vessels [ 31 ] .
in addition to the cellular components , the tumor microenvironment contains noncellular elements such as growth factors , cytokines , chemokines , and extracellular matrix ( ecm ) [ 31 ] .
these surroundings have been shown to play a critical part throughout all phases of tumor development and progression via their interaction with cancer cells [ 31 ] .
research to date indicates that ppargamma activation hinders tumor development and progression by modulating the differentiation , proliferation , apoptosis , and motility of cancer cells and by making the tumor microenvironment less hospitable for tumor growth and metastasis .
2.1 .
effect on tumorigenesis 2.1.1 .
regulation of cancer cells ppargamma is a key regulator of cellular differentiation , a crucial factor in the receptor 's antitumor potential .
as noted , cells often dedifferentiate or elude terminal differentiation during carcinogenesis ; accordingly , protein markers associated with cellular differentiation are downregulated in cancer cells .
gelsolin , an actin - binding protein , is one such marker ; it is expressed at low levels in many cancers , including lung cancer , and becomes upregulated upon induction of in vitro differentiation [ 25 ] .
ppargamma activation by ciglitazone and 15d - pgj2 in multiple nsclc cell lines enhances expression of gelsolin , mad , and p21 , considered general differentiation markers , while reducing expression of lung lineage - specific markers associated with lung progenitor cells such as mucin 1 ( muc1 ) and surfactant protein - a ( sp - a ) [ 25 ]. of note , ciglitazone treatment also promotes morphological changes in these cells that are consistent with more mature differentiation status [ 25 ] .
other research groups extended these findings by showing that such ppargamma agonist - induced differentiation of a549 and nci - h23 nsclc cells reflects sustained extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( erk1 / 2 ) activation that has been linked to cellular differentiation [ 21 , 32 ] .
ppargamma activation also induces conversion of adenocarcinoma cells to a more differentiated phenotype with polarity , which is associated with normal epithelial cells [ 33 ] .
these studies reinforce the antitumorigenic and prodifferentiation role of ppargamma activation in lung cancer .
ppargamma activation can also hamper cell proliferation and tumor growth and promote apoptosis .
this antitumorigenic role has been demonstrated with a variety of ppargamma ligands in various lung cancer cell lines as well as in mouse lung cancer models .
interestingly , multiple mechanisms , which may be partially dependent on cell type , are responsible for these antiproliferative and proapoptotic roles of ppargamma agonists .
troglitazone inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis of sq - 5 nsclc cells by stimulating , in a ppargamma - dependent manner , mrna and protein expression of growth arrest and dna damage - inducible protein 153 ( gadd153 ) , a transcription factor implicated in the promotion of apoptosis [ 34 ] .
similarly , ciglitazone and 15d - pgj2 inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis of h345 and h2081 sclc cells and h1838 and h2106 nsclc cells [ 35 ] .
however , the underlying mechanism in these cells was found to be upregulation of p21 expression and downregulation of cyclin d1 .
rosiglitazone suppresses cell proliferation in h1838 , h1792 , and a549 nsclc cells by ppargamma - mediated suppression of phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( pi3k )/ akt signaling and stimulating phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 ( pten ) expression [ 36 , 37 ] .
troglitazone can also exert antiproliferative effects by causing g0 / g1 cell arrest in multiple nsclc cell lines , as evidenced by the accumulation of cells in g0 / g1 phase and decrease in the number of cells in s phase [ 21 , 22 , 32 ] .
in a549 cells , cell cycle arrest is due to reduction in expression of two g1 phase regulators , cyclins d and e [ 21 ] .
while the apoptotic pathway remains unaffected in a549 cells [ 21 ] , troglitazone - mediated growth inhibition is a consequence of increases in caspases 3 - and 9 - dependent apoptosis in nci - h23 nsclc cells , as indicated by an increase in the number of cells in sub - g1 phase [ 32 ] .
investigation of signaling pathways involved in apoptosis of these cells revealed a reduction in b - cell lymphoma - 2 ( bcl - 2 ) and bcl - w expression , sustained erk1 / 2 and p38 activation , and a decrease in stress - activated protein kinase ( sapk )/ c - jun n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) expression [ 22 ] .
lastly , sulindac sulfide , belonging to another class of ppargamma ligands ( nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ) , has also been shown to decrease anchorage - independent growth , a common measure of tumorigenicity , in both nsclc and sclc cells [ 38 ] .
similar results were obtained using natural and synthetic ppargamma ligands and ppargamma overexpression [ 38 ] .
these in vitro findings are supported by animal studies .
troglitazone and pioglitazone as well as sulindac sulfide significantly reduce primary tumor growth of a549 nsclc cells in a xenograft mouse model [ 21 , 38 ] .
moreover , in studies using mouse models of spontaneous lung adenocarcinoma , where mice are injected with tobacco carcinogens , rosiglitazone or pioglitazone treatment reduces the tumor burden and significantly delays disease progression [ 39 - 41 ] .
this inhibition of tumor progression from hyperplasia to adenoma is a result of inhibited cell proliferation [ 39 ] .
similar results were seen in a carcinogen - induced spontaneous tumor model of lung squamous cell carcinoma [ 40 ] .
thus , prodifferentiation , antiproliferative , and proapoptotic functions of ppargamma activation identify ppargamma agonists as attractive agents for lung cancer .
2.1.2 .
regulation of the tumor microenvironment angiogenesis is a normal physiological process of new blood vessel formation that cancer cells often hijack for successful establishment of primary tumors and metastases [ 42 ] .
new vasculature allows the tumor to grow beyond the limit otherwise imposed by passive oxygen and nutritional diffusion at both primary and secondary sites [ 42 ] .
it also facilitates metastasis by providing easy access to the circulation that cancer cells must enter to reach secondary organs [ 43 ] .
under normal conditions , the process of angiogenesis is tightly regulated by a milieu of pro - and antiangiogenic factors ; during tumorigenesis , however , the proangiogenic factors are favored , leading to continuous neovascularization [ 42 ] .
these tumor - associated blood vessels are also highly permeable , unlike normal vasculature [ 42 ] , further facilitating cancer cell trafficking and metastasis .
vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) is a well - established proangiogenic factor [ 42 ] .
in addition , members of the cxc chemokine family that contain an elr motif , such as interleukin - 8 ( il - 8 ; cxcl8 ) , epithelial neutrophil - activating protein 78 ( ena - 78 ; cxcl5 ) , and growth - regulated oncogene - alpha ( gro - alpha ; cxcl1 ) , can regulate angiogenesis by stimulating the chemotaxis of endothelial cells that form new blood vessels [ 44 ] .
rosiglitazone reduces vegf secretion by lewis lung carcinoma ( llc ) cells and inhibits angiogenesis , thereby reducing the tumor burden in mice [ 45 ] .
likewise , by suppressing secretion of elr - positive cxc chemokines from a549 cells and migration of endothelial cells , troglitazone and pioglitazone inhibit angiogenesis in a mouse xenograft model [ 46 ] .
in addition to indirectly influencing angiogenesis through inhibition of proangiogenic factors , activation of ppargamma , which is highly expressed in tumor - associated endothelial cells , can also block angiogenesis by directly suppressing endothelial cell growth [ 45 ] .
furthermore , 15d - pgj2 has been shown to induce caspase - dependent apoptosis of endothelial cells [ 47 ] , which is expected to have an antiangiogenic effect .
stromal cells , especially myofibroblasts , within the tumor microenvironment are the major source of cytokines , growth factors , matrix metalloproteinases ( mmp ) , and ecm proteins , providing significant support for tumor growth and progression [ 15 , 48 ] .
transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta ) signaling induces fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts [ 15 ] , and its constitutive activity has been detected under pathological conditions in humans [ 48 ] .
15d - pgj2 , troglitazone , ciglitazone , and rosiglitazone suppress tgf - beta - stimulated differentiation of human primary lung fibroblasts into myofibroblasts [ 49 , 50 ] , as does expression of constitutively active ppargamma in imr - 90 human fetal lung fibroblast cells [ 50 ] .
treatment with ppargamma agonists also inhibits type i collagen production by these human lung fibroblasts .
tgf - beta - induced fibronectin expression is likewise attenuated by the ppargamma agonist pioglitazone in human mesangial cells [ 51 ] .
this inhibition of fibronectin expression has been replicated in h1838 nsclc cells treated with the ppargamma ligands brl49653 , 15d - pgj2 , or troglitazone [ 52 ] .
an increase in some ecm constituents , including fibronectin and type i collagen and consequent remodeling of the tumor microenvironment , contributes to the pathogenesis of cancer [ 53 ] .
thus , these antitumorigenic influences on the tumor microenvironment , combined with its antiangiogenic effect , further support ppargamma agonists for the treatment of lung cancer .
2.2 .
effect on metastasis the role of ppargamma in lung cancer extends beyond the regulation of primary tumor formation ; mounting evidence suggests that ppargamma activation suppresses tumor metastasis .
in a study using a mouse xenograft model , metastasis to the lungs of a549 cells implanted in the dorsal flank of the animals was significantly reduced in response to troglitazone or pioglitazone [ 21 ] .
moreover , the few metastases detected in the lungs of the ppargamma agonist - treated animals were smaller and better circumscribed than those in the placebo - treated animals [ 21 ] .
similarly , a study using a rat orthotopic lung tumor model showed that ppargamma overexpression abrogates the metastasis of h2122 cells injected into one lung to the contralateral lung ( or to the mediastinum ) by impairing the cells' invasive capability [ 33 ] .
rats harboring ppargamma - overexpressing h2122 cells also survived longer than the control animals .
a similar observation was made in a mouse xenograft model in which llc cells were implanted subcutaneously into the dorsal region of the mice [ 45 ] ; rosiglitazone treatment completely blocked lung metastasis , preserving the normal architecture of the lungs , while the lung tissue of the control mice was filled with metastatic cancer cells .
intriguingly , the authors of the study observed the presence of llc cells within the lung blood vessels of the rosiglitazone - treated mice while detecting none in the lung parenchyma [ 45 ] , implying that rosiglitazone inhibits metastasis by preventing cancer cells' extravasation from the circulation , an essential step during tumor metastasis [ 54 ] .
the negative effect of ppargamma activation on tumor metastasis is further supported by findings that ciglitazone significantly reduces activity and total expression of mmp - 2 by nci - h157 and h1299 nsclc cells [ 25 ] and that rosiglitazone enhances the activity of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases , which essentially decreases the net proteolytic activity of mmps [ 45 ] .
mmps are key regulators of ecm remodeling and disruption [ 55 ] .
furthermore , expression of certain mmps is linked to the metastatic potential of tumors in mouse models and generally correlates with poor prognosis for human patients with different types of cancer [ 55 ] , thus supporting the significance of ppargamma - mediated mmp suppression in the context of tumor progression .
acquisition of metastatic potential is often accompanied by alterations in expression of certain cell adhesion molecules .
in some carcinomas , e - cadherin , which holds epithelial cell sheets together by intercellular attachments and maintains the cells in their quiescent state , becomes downregulated , while adhesion molecules associated with enhanced cell migration , such as n - cadherin , are upregulated [ 54 ] .
this switch in cadherin expression is considered a hallmark of the physiological process designated epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) .
cancer cells' activation of this program promotes metastasis [ 54 ] through loss of intercellular adhesion with consequent dissemination , morphological changes that facilitate migration and invasion , secretion of proteolytic enzymes , and resistance to apoptosis .
tgf - beta signaling can drive these cellular modifications , modulating a set of transcription factors such as snail , slug , twist , and zinc finger e - box - binding homeobox 1 / 2 ( zeb1 / 2 ) [ 54 ] , and the enhanced tgf - beta expression in many malignancies , including lung cancer , is implicated in the metastatic potential of advanced - stage tumors [ 56 ] .
tgf - beta has been shown to induce emt in a549 cells , manifested as phenotypic transformation from a cuboidal epithelial morphology to an elongated mesenchymal form as well as by loss of intercellular attachment [ 57 ] .
this change in cell morphology is accompanied by the predicted shift in cadherin expression and enhanced migration and invasion capabilities .
troglitazone and rosiglitazone block tgf - beta - induced emt , preventing the downregulation of e - cadherin expression and the upregulation of n - cadherin and other mesenchymal cell markers [ 58 ] .
the authors further characterized the anti - emt effect of ppargamma activation by showing that troglitazone and rosiglitazone reverse many of the alterations that a549 cells undergo during tgf - beta - induced emt ; the two ppargamma agonists maintain intercellular adhesion , suppress cell migration and invasion , and abrogate mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 secretion .
the suppression of emt by ppargamma activation was found to be via inhibition of smad3 transcriptional activity , a downstream component of tgf - beta signaling essential for the induction of emt .
as expected from their other data , these authors also found that lung metastasis of a549 cells injected into mice via tail vein is also reduced by troglitazone treatment .
metastasis is a significant source of morbidity and mortality for patients with cancer , and more than half of lung cancer patients harbor distant metastases at the time of diagnosis [ 1 ] .
therefore , the ability of ppargamma agonists to suppress the development not only of primary tumors but also of metastases makes their therapeutic application in lung cancer promising .
3. ppargamma agonists for lung cancer : clinical evidence and synergism with established therapy the promising role of ppargamma agonists as therapeutic agents for lung cancer , suggested by experimental studies , has also been documented by clinical data .
a retrospective analysis of 87,678 diabetic male patients ( 11,289 tzd users and 76,389 nonusers ) from 10 veterans affairs medical centers found that tzd use is associated with a 33 % reduction in subsequent diagnosis of lung cancer , although no effect of tzd use was found on the incidence of colon or prostate cancer [ 59 ] .
moreover , risk reduction for lung cancer was significantly higher in african american tzd users .
this is highly relevant as incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer are highest in non - hispanic black males [ 1 ]. of note , this analysis focused only on diabetic patients and excluded those with preexisting cancers .
thus , it remains to be determined whether this correlation applies to a nondiabetic population .
to this end , a clinical trial ( nct00780234 ) that represents a more general population is currently underway to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone in the chemoprevention of lung cancer .
ppargamma agonists also demonstrate a synergistic effect with traditional chemotherapeutic agents , enhancing their cytotoxic effect on cancer cells .
combining ppargamma ligands such as rosiglitazone and gw1929 with the platinum - based drugs commonly used for lung cancer treatment , such as cisplatin and carboplatin , synergistically inhibits growth of multiple nsclc cell lines [ 60 ] .
the synergistic effect of combination therapy was also observed in a xenograft lung cancer model as well as a spontaneous colon cancer model , without additional toxicity to the animals .
investigation of the mechanism underlying synergy between these two classes of drugs revealed that ppargamma activation reduces the expression of metallothioneins , known for their role in resistance to platinum - based drugs by protecting the cells from platinum toxicity .
similar in vitro and in vivo findings were reported by another research group using the ppargamma agonists troglitazone and pioglitazone and the chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel [ 61 ] .
the molecular mechanism of action was different between the two studies , however .
in the latter study , the authors observed the benefit of the combination therapy only when chemotherapeutic agents were followed , rather than preceded , by ppargamma agonist treatment and concluded that this phenomenon is probably due to the induction of ppargamma expression in response to cisplatin and paclitaxel treatment [ 61 ] .
besides traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy , within the past 2 decades targeted therapies that attack specific molecules responsible for tumorigenesis have been gaining attention in the field [ 62 ] .
the synergistic effect of ppargamma agonists has been demonstrated with this new class of therapeutic agents as well .
rosiglitazone enhances the antiproliferative effect of gefitinib , an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor , in a549 cells [ 37 ] .
a combination of troglitazone and lovastatin , an inhibitor of 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methyl - glutaryl - coenzyme a reductase ( hmg - coa reductase ) , also shows significantly stronger suppression of cl1 - 0 lung adenocarcinoma cell growth than either drug alone [ 63 ] .
4. conclusions review of extensive experimental data combined with retrospective analysis of human data supports ppargamma as a promising therapeutic target in cancer .
in addition to demonstrating their effectiveness as monotherapy for lung cancer , ppargamma agonists also show synergistic effects with standard chemotherapy and potentially prevent chemotherapeutic resistance .
these attributes suggest that ppargamma agonists , in combination with other therapies currently in use or in clinical trials , represent a novel , attractive approach in lung cancer therapy .
additional , well - designed clinical trials should be undertaken to test the efficacy and safety of these agents in the treatment of lung cancer .

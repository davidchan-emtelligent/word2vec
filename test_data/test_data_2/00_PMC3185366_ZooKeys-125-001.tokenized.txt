a diversity of imaging techniques are used to illustrate the species including low - temperature scanning electron microscopy ( lt - sem ) , stereomicrography , compound light micrography , and digitally created line drawings .
developmental stages ( larva , nymphs , and adult ) and morphology are illustrated and discussed , and terminological corrections are suggested .
trachymolgus recki gomelauri , 1961 is regarded as being described from tritonymphs .
a key to trachymolgus is presented .
keywords lt - sem taxonomy prostigmata new species image diversity introduction bdellidae duges , 1834 generally have a striated , unsclerotized integument .
exceptions occur in cytinae grandjean , 1938 , which comprises three of the most distinctive bdelloid genera .
cyta heyden , 1826 are common mites known for their stocky bodies , massive chelicerae , and unpaired fifth eye .
rigibdella ignea tseng , 1978 from taiwan have sclerotized , striated holodorsal shields ( tseng 1978 ; lin and zhang 2010 ) .
the only other bdellids with a sclerotized body are the subject of this study - trachymolgus berlese , 1923 .
trachymolgus are infrequently collected mites with three described species .
instead of the typical fingerprint - like membranes of other bdellidae , the integument of trachymolgus is heavily sclerotized , divided into distinct sclerites , and dark ( fig. 1 ) .
the sclerites are foveolate , containing many indentions that create a characteristic reticulated patterning ( fig. 2a ) .
these indentions have multiple small pits at the corners of the foveolae ( fig. 2b ) .
this strange integument , combined with the rarity of collection , has rendered trachymolgus the most enigmatic bdellid .
berlese ( 1923 ) erected trachymolgus to accommodate the distinctive snout mite canestrini and fanzago ( 1876 ) named bdella nigerrima .
trachymolgus niggerimus ( canestrini & fanzago , 1876 ) was originally collected in northern italy ( padova ) and subsequently reported from sicily and lugano , switzerland ( thor 1931 ) , crimea , ukraine ( vainshtein et al. 1978 ) , caucasus ( vainshtein et al .
1978 ) , and from rodent nests in bulgaria ( sosnina et al. 1965 ) .
grandjean ( 1938 ) grouped cyta and trachymolgus into a new subfamily ( cytinae ) based on the number of subcapitular setae and leg trichobothria , presence of pseudotracheae , and normal chelicerae ( reduced in spinibdellinae ) .
two other species were described later , both known only from their type localities : trachymolgus recki gomelauri , 1961 in georgia ( former u.s.s.r. : tbilisi and kashtak ) and trachymolgus jesusi mejia - recamier & palacios - vargas , 1999 in mexico ( jalisco and chamela ) .
undetermined species have been reported from a buddhist temple on shikoku island , japan ( nakamura et al. 2006 ) , from the st. lawrence islands national park , canada ( smith et al. 1996 ) , and we collected a third from columbus , ohio .
here , we describe and illustrate trachymolgus purpureus sp. n. from the ozark highlands of north america .
material and methods specimens mites were collected primarily from leaf litter samples in the ozark mountains of arkansas ( u.s.a. ) , specifically buffalo national river and devil 's den state park , and extracted using berlese - tullgren funnels .
approximately half of the specimens were slide - mounted with hoyer 's medium ( see krantz and walter 2009 for preparation ) , and half are stored in 95 % ethanol at - 80degreesc .
slide - mounted specimens were dissected along the frontal plane .
five paratypes are deposited in the ohio state university acarology collection , columbus , ohio .
four paratypes each are deposited in the field museum of natural history , chicago , ill. , and the national mite collection , national museum of natural history , smithsonian institution , located in beltsville , md. all other type specimens are deposited in the acari collection of the university of arkansas , fayetteville , ark .
terminology an effort is made to implement terminology that is broadly applicable and well accepted across acariforms despite conventions used among bdelloid authors .
thus , two terms have been renamed herein .
first , " hypostome " is used by many ( atyeo 1960 ; van der schyff et al .
2004 ; hernandes and feres 2006 ; krantz and walter 2009 ) to refer to the entire subcapitulum , though it more accurately refers only to the portion anterior to the oral opening ( evans 1992 ; krantz and walter 2009 ) .
thus , in addition to the subcapitulum itself , its setae have been renamed herein to ventral subcapitular setae ( vs ) and dorsal subcapitular setae ( ds ) .
second , the major idiosomal divisions of bdelloids are regularly referred to as the " propodosoma " and " hysterosoma " ( bdellidae : atyeo 1960 , mejia - recamier and palacios - vargas 1999 , hernandes et al .
2007 ; cunaxidae : meyer and ryke 1959 , swift 1996 , den heyer and castro 2009 ) .
however , acariform segmentation is a debated topic with recent views favoring a radically reduced podosoma leaving the major idiosomal divisions ( when viewed dorsally ) the opisthosoma and aspidosoma ( grandjean 1969 ; coineau 1974 ; evans 1992 ; krantz and walter 2009 ). with regard to the posterior portion , hysterosoma is already widely used and accurately refers to the idiosoma posterior to the sejugal furrow ( metapodosoma and opisthosoma ) .
moreover , it is independent of segmentation hypotheses .
therefore , we retain the use of hysterosoma .
however , propodosoma is hypothesis dependent .
the grandjean ( 1969 ) hypothesis of body organization suggests the propodosoma is highly reduced dorsally , rendering propodosoma inaccurate when referring to the anteriodorsal portion of the idiosoma .
instead , aspidosoma accurately describes this region .
therefore , we abandon the use of propodosoma when referring to the dorsal morphology of acariforms .
however , until more evidence exists for segmentation homologies , we also avoid the use of aspidosoma for bdelloidea .
prodorsum is widely used by acarologists , but is usually poorly defined and represents the opposite extreme from aspidosoma - - straying too far from morphological hypotheses .
an exception to this is in oribatida ( e.g. , sanders and norton 2004 ) , where it is often used as synonymous with the aspidosomal shield (= aspis ) and is therefore hypothesis dependent .
thus we recommend restricting prodorsum to casual use .
proterosoma refers to the body anterior to the sejugal furrow ( propodosoma , aspidosoma , and gnathosoma of grandjean [ 1969 ]) , and is a segmentation independent term that is already widely used in acarology .
therefore , we adopt proterosoma here. with regard to hysterosomal setal notation , we follow the chaetotaxic system of ( grandjean ( 1939 , 1947 ) that has been widely adopted ( e.g. , van der hammen 1970 ; lindquist 1976 , 1977 ; kethley 1990 ) .
proterosomal setal notation in this system is currently problematic .
generally , we do not recommend the use of mixed approaches in terminology , especially given our attempts to utilize broadly applicable notations .
however , recent suggestions in the proterosomal setal notation of bdelloids have rendered this system unreliable .
in the grandjean system , proterosomal setae are termed internal / external verticals ( vi and ve ) and internal / external scapulars ( sci and sce ) .
in bdelloidea , sci are always external to sce , leaving the internal / external designations unintuitive .
den heyer and castro ( 2008a ) noted this and proposed simply switching the terms when referring to bdelloids so that sce and sci are descriptive , which they have published since ( den heyer and castro 2008b , c ; den heyer 2011 ) .
as a result , the literature now has sce and sci referring to both inner and outer scapulars .
the homology of these setae with respect to other mites is not known .
therefore , until more evidence is provided for homology , we resort to a modified version of atyeo ( 1960 ) when referring to proterosomal setae , which unambiguously relies on position : anterior and posterior trichobothria ( at and pt ) , and lateral and median proterosomal setae ( lps and mps ) .
leg chaetotaxy follows grandjean 's system as reviewed by norton ( 1977 ) .
however , leg chaetotaxy is poorly studied among eupodina , and only distal tarsal setae are denoted presently , which has been adopted by other eupodine authors ( e.g. , jesionowska 2010 ) .
nevertheless , we believe grandjean 's system can be employed with other leg setae , and will readdress this in a more detailed forthcoming study .
images most species descriptions include only a few image types ; line drawings are most common in acarology ( e.g. , mejia - recamier and palacios - vargas 1999 ; den heyer and castro 2008a , b , c ; lochynska 2008 ) .
we believe image diversity increases accuracy , accessibility , and attractiveness of taxonomic products , and have therefore included many images and a range of imaging types .
other acarologists have also begun including image diversity in taxonomic works ( e.g. makol 2010 ; wohltmann 2010 ; pesic et al. 2011 ) .
line drawings were created digitally with adobe illustrator cs5 and a wacom cintiq 21ux tablet using procedures outlined in fisher and dowling ( 2010 ) .
compound light micrographs were taken with a leica dfc300 fx camera and a leica dm2500 dic light microscope .
stereomicrographs were taken with a leica mz 16 stereoscope and a leica dfc 290 camera .
photographs were enhanced using adobe ( r ) photoshop cs4 .
low - temperature scanning electron micrographs ( lt - sem ) were made using an s - 4700 field emission scanning electron microscope ( hitachi high technologies america , inc. , pleasanton , calif. ) equipped with a quorum cryoprep pp2000 ( energy bean sciences , east grandby , conn. ) cryotransfer system .
to prepare specimens , mites were placed on 12 mm diameter ultra smooth carbon double sided adhesive tabs ( electron microscopy sciences , hatfield , pa ) which were adhered to flat specimen holders consisting of 16x30mm copper plates that were tacked on the edges to the tabs with a small dot of tissue tek ( oct compound , ted pella , inc. , redding , calif. ) , which acted as the cyro - adhesive upon freezing .
the samples were frozen conductively , in a styrofoam box , by placing the plates on the surface of a pre - cooled ( - 96degreesc ) brass bar whose lower half was submerged in liquid nitrogen ( ln2 ) .
after 20 - 30s , the holders containing the frozen samples were transferred to a ln2 dewar for future use or cryotransferred under vacuum to the cold stage in the pre - chamber of the cryotransfer system .
removal of any surface contamination ( condensed water vapor ) took place in the cryotransfer system by etching the frozen specimens for 10 - 15 min by raising the temperature of the stage to - 90degreesc .
following etching , the temperature was lowered below - 130degreesc , and a magnetron sputter head equipped with a platinum target , was used to coat the specimens with a very fine layer of platinum .
the specimens were transferred to a pre - cooled ( - 130degreesc ) cryostage in the sem for observation .
an accelerating voltage of 5kv was used to view the specimens .
images were captured using a 4pi analysis system ( durham , n.c. ) .
images were sized and placed together into figures using adobe ( r ) photoshop 7.0 and cs4 .

trachymolgus purpureus sp. n. is heavily armored with distinctive integument characteristic of trachymolgus ( figs 1 - 2 ) .
like trachymolgus jesusi , the integument is dark purple , whereas trachymolgus nigerrimus was described as black .
like trachymolgus jesusi and trachymolgus nigerrimus , there are two teeth on the fixed cheliceral digit .
like trachymolgus nigerrimus , trachymolgus purpureus has one tooth on the movable digit ( trachymolgus jesusi have three ) and a serrated edge proximal to the tooth ( undescribed in other species ) .
all stages have two pairs of eyes , unlike the larva , proto - and deutonymphs of trachymolgus jesusi , which lack eyes ( tritonymphs and adults have two pairs ) .
trachymolgus purpureus pedipalpal basi - and telofemora are only fused dorsally .
trachymolgus jesusi pedipalp femora are completely fused , whereas trachymolgus nigerrimus are completely divided .
trachymolgus purpureus , like other trachymolgus,have undivided femora on legs i - ii ( femora iii - iv are divided ) .
all other bdellidae have divided femora on all legs .
trachymolgus jesusi is the only bdellid reported to have undivided femora on legs ii and iii .
the ontogeny of trachymolgus purpureus differs markedly from that described for trachymolgus jesusi , the only other species where ontogeny was investigated .
finally , there are many chaetotaxic differences on the appendages and venter between trachymolgus purpureus and trachymolgus jesusi .
most chaetotaxy of trachymolgus nigerrimus remain to be investigated .
see remarks for discussion of trachymolgus recki .
imago description .
females and males similar , except for genitalia , size , and chaetotaxic differences noted in table 1 .
color dark purple ; occasionally immatures and adults were collected from the buffalo national river ( arkansas ) with an internally green coloration , which rendered the normally purple mite teal ; teal specimens returned to purple after a few days in 95 % ethanol , and were indistinguishable from normal specimens when slide - mounted ( we also collected penthaleus , a normally black to dark blue mite , from the same habitat exhibiting green internal coloration ) .
integument divided into heavily armored sclerites with foveolate sculpturing ( fig. 2a ) .
the foveolate indentions ( foveolae ) are bordered with pits ( fig. 2b ) .

measurements and chaetotaxy of immatures are given in tables 1 - 6 .
developmental stages are illustrated in figures 13 - 16 .
like other mites , developmental stages can be easily recognized by leg number ( larvae have six legs ) and genital development ( fig. 17 ) .
chaetotaxic differences and femoral divisions are also helpful ( tables 1 , 6 ) .
all immature stages appear soft bodied ( despite dorsal sclerites ) and vary in color from light green or purple to yellowish - white ( fig. 12 ) .
due to the unique armored morphology of trachymolgus , other interesting developmental changes are present .
these are discussed below .
dorsal sclerites and setae.none of the immature stages of trachymolgus purpureus have complete dorsal shields as seen in the adult .
this is unlike trachymolgus jesusi , which was described as having an armored tritonymph and unsclerotized proto - and deutonymphs .
in trachymolgus purpureus , all stages have dorsal sclerites .
shield sculpturingis underdeveloped in the larva with foveolate indentions absent but pits present ( fig. 13 ) ; protonymphs also lack foveolate indentions , but the pits are more organized , reminiscent of the indentions ( fig. 14 ) ; deutonymphs begin to develop foveolate indentions ( fig. 15 ) , which are nearly complete in the tritonymph ( fig. 16 ) .
the proterosomal shield of the larva does not encompass the posterior pair of eyes , and the anterior crown is not developed , leaving the gnathosomal membrane appearing as a collar .
the protonymph has a well - developed proterosomal shield that encompasses all eyes and has a complete crown .
hysterosomal shield of the larva only encompasses c1 and d1 ; nymphal stages also encompass e1 .
small sclerotized regions containing pits , but not foveolate indentions , are present around c2 in the deuto - and tritonymphs .
a posterior shield encompassing h1 , contiguous with the hysterosomal shield in adults , is present in nymphal stages , but not larvae .
larvae completely lack f2 .
lateral shields.lateral shields are present in deuto - and tritonymphs ( figs 15 , 16 ) , but do not encompass h2 or ih , as in adults ( fig. 3 ) .
furthermore , in addition to lateral shields , larvae lack h2 .
lyrifissure ih was not found in any immature stage .
pseudotracheae.as described for trachymolgus jesusi , pseudotracheae are lacking in the larva and protonymph , but are well - developed in the deutonymph ( fig. 17 ) .
membranes.as discussed above , adult trachymolgus purpureus striations are accompanied with bumps ( fig. 5b ) , unlike other bdellid membranes that exhibit fingerprint - like striations .
however , larvae and protonymphs lack bumps and have typical fingerprint - like striations ( figs 13 , 14 ) .
membrane bumps begin to develop on the deutonymphal dorsum ( fig. 15 ) , and are well developed in the tritonymph ( fig. 16 ) .
all stages have normal , fingerprint - like striations on the venter .

in the early 1980s , trachymolgus was collected by cal welbourn on a rocky bluff in the buffalo national river ( arkansas ) .
john kethley recollected three specimens from the same bluff a few years later .
another specimen ( one female ) was collected by evert lindquist in the st. lawrence islands national park , canada ( smith et al. 1996 ) , but the specimen has since been lost .
since then , we have collected this seemingly restricted , rare mite from a wide variety of microhabitats including litter , talus , rock outcrops and bluffs , moss , cedar stands , hardwood stands , and in both wet and dry conditions .
furthermore , the range is potentially not restricted to the ozark highlands .
amusingly , we collected one tritonymph and one adult from leaf litter less than 200ft from where the ohio state university summer acarology course is taught ( downtown columbus , ohio ) .
morphologically , these specimens cannot yet be distinguished from trachymolgus purpureus , potentially extending the range to eastern u.s. we were able to extract dna from one of these specimens and will publish our findings later. biogeography .
the known distribution of north american trachymolgus is mexico ( trachymolgus jesusi ) , ozark highlands ( trachymolgus purpureus ) , central ohio ( undet .
species ) , and the northern appalachian mountains ( undet. species ) .
other groups have a similar distribution , and the biogeographic affinity between the ozark and appalachian mountains , and between mexico and the eastern u.s. has been well documented .
examples include mosses ( crum 1952 ; redfearn 1986 ) , higher plants ( braun 1955 ; dressler 1954 ; miranda and sharp 1950 ; watson 1891 ) , fungi ( miranda and sharp 1950 ; sharp 1948 ) , snakes , flying squirrels , and plethodontid salamanders ( see martin and harrel 1957 ) .
recently , a mite was implicated as sharing this affinity ( skvarla et al. 2011 ) .
it is tempting consider trachymolgus purpureus as representative of these biogeographic events , but much more sampling is necessary before this conclusion can be justified .
temperature tolerance .
trachymolgus purpureus seems to have extremely high temperature tolerances .
they were found crawling on rock surfaces in direct sunlight during a drought in the hottest and driest time of year ( august ) , and were collected near the surface during the winter .
when preparing live specimens for lt - sem , mites are set atop a metal bar that is subjected to liquid nitrogen fumes which freezes them mid - stride for imaging .
when trachymolgus purpureus was subjected to liquid nitrogen temperatures however , they would simply run , curl their legs , and roll off the plate ( see fig. 18a ) .
this made imaging live specimens very difficult .
silk production .
lt - sem imaging illuminated another behavioral characteristic of trachymolgus purpureus .
though other bdellids have been known to orally produce silk to tether prey ( alberti 1973 , krantz and walter 2009 ) , silk production in trachymolgus was not previously known .
when subjected to liquid nitrogen , trachymolgus purpureus would charge its gnathosoma with silk , making investigation of chelae impossible on living specimens ( fig. 11d ) .
one specimen tethered itself to the plate before rolling off ( fig. 18 ) , potentially using silk as a dragline as has been described in many spiders .
feeding behavior.we observed a tritonymph of trachymolgus purpureus feeding on a small mite approximately 200 - 250m long .
unfortunately , the prey could not be retrieved for identification .
the tritonymph fed with prey elevated from the ground .
there seemed to be a droplet surrounding the bite site , interpreted here as silk seen in figures 11d .
we hypothesize that trachymolgus purpureus uses a drop of silk at the bite site to act as a gasket when sucking prey fluids .

this species is named for the latin " purpureus ," meaning purple .
notes on trachymolgus recki gomelauri , 1961 trachymolgus recki was described from two specimens from georgia ( gomelauri 1961 ) .
unlike other trachymolgus , the integument of trachymolgus recki was described as unarmored ( despite having foveolate indentations and proterosomal crown ) and yellowish .
there was one tooth on the fixed digit , one pair of eyes , and the pedipalps were inconclusively described as " nearly fused " though they were completely fused in the illustration ( gomelauri 1961 ). there were 6 - 7 genital setae , and coxal field setae 3 - 4 - 4 - 5 .
we have found that purple trachymolgus purpureus immatures lose color more readily than adults when slide - mounted , and some immatures are yellowish - white in life ( fig. 12b ) .
also , though deuto - and tritonymphal shields are foveolate , they are not as heavily sclerotized as in adults , which could give the appearance of being un - armored .
adults of trachymolgus purpureus and trachymolgus jesusi have higher setal counts with > 20 and 10 genital setae , respectively , and coxal field setae 7 - 7 - 9 - 8 ( female trachymolgus purpureus ) , 6 - 6 - 6 - 10 ( male trachymolgus purpureus ) , and 8 - 5 - 11 - 10 ( trachymolgus jesusi ) .
larvae , proto - and deutonymphs of trachymolgus jesusi were described as having highly reduced eyes .
gomelauri observed only one pair eyes in trachymolgus recki .
this offers significant evidence to suggest the specimens used to describe trachymolgus recki were immature .
since these specimens were said to have three pairs of genital papillae , we suggest the description of trachymolgus recki was based on tritonymphs .
therefore , trachymolgus recki is excluded from the key below .
notes on trachymolgus jesusi , mejia - recamier & palacios - vargas , 1999 aspects of the morphology and development described for trachymolgus jesusi ( mejia - recamier & palacios - vargas 1999 ) , suggest major deviations from what is known from other bdellidae .
unfortunately , we were unable to obtain type specimens of this species .

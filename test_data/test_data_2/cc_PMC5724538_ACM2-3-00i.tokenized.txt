i am pleased to note that the journal continues to grow in size and outreach .
volume 2 was 60 % larger ( both in the number of manuscripts and the number of pages published ) than volume 1 and volume 3 is 60 % larger than volume 2 .
in three years the journal has more than doubled in size .
the monthly usage statistics for the journal have also shown a steady increase , both in requests and in the unique hosts accessing the journal , during these three years. of particular interest has been the number of different countries from which manuscripts have been submitted .
in addition to the united states and canada , papers have come from fourteen others countries .
although the majority of the manuscripts come from the united states the percentage of submissions from other countries has increased in the last few months .
because an electronic journal is accessible worldwide it has always been editorial policy to serve the international medical physics community , and it is gratifying to see this taking place .
the success of the journal and its growth would not have been possible without the continued support of the american college of medical physics , who along with the journal 's sponsors and advertisers have continued to underwrite the cost of the journal .
this means that in 2003 volume 4 will again be subscription free and available to all medical physicists .
the completion of volume 3 also marks the end of my tenure as editor - in - chief and that of georgeanne moore as manuscript manager .
much of the success of the journal has been due to her hard work and handling of the daily mechanics of running the journal .
the journal is very fortunate that dr. edwin mccullough will be taking over as editor - in - chief and sarah evers as the manuscript manager .
we wish them well and look forward to continued growth and success of the journal in their capable hands .
peter r. almond , ph.d. editor - in - chief

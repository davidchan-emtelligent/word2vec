background different from three clonal lineages of toxoplasma gondii in north america and europe , the genotype china 1 is predominantly prevalent in china .
however , there are different virulent isolates within china 1 , such as virulent tgctwh3 and avirulent tgctwh6 , and little is known about differences in macrophage activation between them .
the objective of this study focused on cytokine production , phenotype and markers of activated macrophages , and correlated signaling pathway induced by the two isolates .
methods adherent peritoneal macrophages ( termed wh3 - mphi and wh6 - mphi , respectively ) harvested from infected mice were cultured for detection of nitric oxide and arginase activity , and activated markers on wh3 - mphi / wh6 - mphi were determined by flow cytometry .
in in vitro experiments , the levels of il - 12p40 and tnf - alpha were measured using elisa kits , and mrna expressions of il - 12p40 , tnf - alpha , inos , arg - 1 and ym1 were assayed by real - time pcr .
to confirm the activation state of nf - kb p65 in infected cells stained by if , protein levels of inos , arg - 1 , ym1 , nuclear nf - kappab p65 , and phosphorylation of stat6 / stat3 / ikappabalpha were evaluated by western blotting .
a one - way anova test was used to compare differences among multiple groups .
results the result revealed that contrary to the virulent tgctwh3 , the less virulent tgctwh6 isolate induced a significant increase in il - 12p40 and tnf - alpha .
although both isolates down - regulated cd80 , cd86 and mhcii molecule expression on macrophages , tgctwh3 promoted up - regulation of pd - l2 and cd206 .
wh6 - mphi generated a high level of no whereas wh3 - mphi up - regulated ym1 and arginase expression at transcriptional and protein levels .
in terms of signaling pathway , tgctwh3 induced phospho - stat6 , conversely , tgctwh6 led to nf - kappab p65 activation .
conclusions the virulent tgctwh3 isolate induced macrophages to polarize toward alternatively activated cells with stat6 phosphorylation , whereas the less virulent tgctwh6 elicited the development of classically activated macrophages with nuclear translocation of nf - kappab p65 .
this discrepancy suggests that it is necessary to thoroughly analyze the genotype of tgctwh3 and tgctwh6 , and to further study other effector molecules that contribute to the macrophage polarization in t. gondii .
toxoplasma gondii genotyping macrophages macrophage activation signaling pathway background toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite capable of infecting a broad spectrum of hosts including up to 30 % of the world 's human population [ 1 ] .
infection occurs when individuals ingest undercooked meat containing cysts of the parasite or consume food contaminated with oocysts .
although most infections are mild in healthy adults , life - threatening consequences may develop in immunocompromised individuals and in utero infection can lead to major defects in the fetus [ 2 ] .
during acute infection , tachyzoites , the rapidly replicative form of the parasite , elicits an extremely strong type th1 immune response , characterized by proinflammatory cytokine production such as il - 6 , ifn - gamma and tnf - alpha .
macrophages can provide a niche permissive for parasite replication and are the most abundant cell type infected by toxoplasma [ 3 ] .
it has been clarified that macrophages can be phenotypically polarized by the micro - environment to mount specific functional programs [ 4 ] .
polarized macrophages have been classified in two main clades : classically activated macrophages ( or m1 ) whose typical activating stimuli are ifn - gamma and lps , and alternatively activated macrophages ( or m2 ) induced by exposure to il - 4 and il - 13 .
m1 exhibits antimicrobial functions against intracellular pathogens which is conducted by the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates such as no and promote strong th1 responses , while m2 is accompanied by diminished proinflammatory cytokine secretion and shares high expression of scavenger , mannose ( cd206 ) and galactose receptors [ 5 ] .
recent work on t. gondii polymorphism - associated immune responses show that mouse macrophages infected with type i and iii strains are polarized toward an m2 activation state through activation of stat6 , while type ii infected macrophages are m1 - like cells elicited by activation of nf - kappab [ 3,6 ] .
type i and type iii rhoptry kinase rop16 , inferred as one of virulence determinants , can constitutively activate stat6 , and type ii dense granule antigen gra15 is responsible for strain - specific nf - kappab activation [ 6 ] .
the majority of t. gondii strains isolated from humans and animals in north america and europe have been grouped into three predominant clonal lineages ( types i , ii and iii ) that differ genetically by less than 1 % [ 7,8 ] .
regardless of the genetic background of mice , type i strains are highly virulent with an ld100 = 1 , whereas type ii or type iii strains associate with host genetic background and display lower virulence with an ld50 =~ 102 and =~ 105 , respectively [ 9 ] .
recently there were several studies revealing that a few major clonal lineages of t. gondii dominate in different geographical regions .
for example , the type 12 lineage is most common in wildlife in north america [ 10 ] , and the africa 1 and 3 are among the major types in africa [ 11 ] .
our previous study and other lab research showed that the genotype china 1 ( toxodb # 9 ) is dominantly prevalent in china [ 12 - 15 ] .
the outcome of toxoplasmosis in the mouse model is mainly influenced by the genotype of strain of t. gondii [ 16 ] .
interestingly , within the genotype china 1 , isolates of tgctwh3 and tgctwh6 have remarkably different virulence to mice [ 12 ] , in which tgctwh3 is highly virulent and cause lethal infection , whereas tgctwh6 is mildly virulent and able to establish latent infection with cysts in the brain of mice .
this virulent difference triggered our interest in understanding the distinction between the two isolates .
in the present study , we systematically compared the acute immune response of host , macrophage activation and modulation of the signaling pathway to infection with tgctwh3 and tgctwh6 tachyzoites respectively .
methods ethics statement all animal experiments were conducted in strict accordance with the chinese national institute of health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals ( 1998 ) and approved by the institutional review board of anhui medical university institute of biomedicine ( permit number : amu26 - 081108 ) .

the tachyzoites of mouse - virulent tgctwh3 isolates or rh strain were harvested from the mouse peritoneal exudates by injection of ice - cold d - hanks solution on day 3 after infection , and then isolated by centrifugation at 35xg for 5 min to discard contaminating host cells .
after the supernatant was centrifuged at 1350xg for 10 min , the parasites were washed once and maintained by serial passages in l929 fibroblast monolayers for further infection experiments in vitro and in vivo .
the tachyzoites of tgctwh6 or pru strain were initially obtained by inoculating brain homogenate containing cysts from infected mice and then cultured with l929 fibroblasts .

results tgctwh3 and tgctwh6 strains display different virulence our previous study showed that different from the three clonal lineages of t. gondii strains isolated in north america and europe , the genotype china 1 ( toxodb # 9 ) is a major lineage prevalent in china with different virulent strains [ 12 ] .
tgctwh3 strain leads to fatal infection while mice innoculated with tgctwh6 can establish latent infection .
to evaluate acute virulence , mice were challenged i.p. with low ( 500 tachyzoites ) or high ( 5x105 tachyzoites ) doses of the tgctwh3 or tgctwh6 isolates .
it was found that mice inoculated with 500 tgctwh3 tachyzoites uniformly succumbed to infection within 9 days ( figure 1a ) , in contrast , no death was noted in animals given an equivalent dose of tgctwh6 tachyzoites during the whole experiment .
when infected with 5x105 tgctwh6 tachyzoites , 20 % of the mice survived beyond 30 days and cysts could be found in the brains .
additionally , tgctwh3 tachyzoites had a higher proliferation ( figure 1b , 1c , 1d ) and completely lysed a flask of cultured cells much faster than tgctwh6 tachyzoites in vitro ( figure 1e ) .
figure 1 survival curve of mice infected with tgctwh3 or tgctwh6 and isolates' growth in vitro .
( a ) ten balb / c mice per group were inoculated i. p. with 500 or 5x105 tachyzoites of tgctwh3 or tgctwh6 and monitored for 30 days .
( b ) raw264.7 cells were infected with tgctwh3 ( gray bars ) or tgctwh6 ( dark bars ) for 24 h ( 2:1 ratio of parasites to cells ) , stained with wright - giemsa , and parasites replication was determined by counting the number of parasites from 100 parasitophorous vacuoles by microscopy ( fisher 's exact test , *** p < 0.001 , # p > 0.05 , tgctwh3 vs tgctwh6 ) .

distinct cytokine profile of macrophages infected with tgctwh3 and tgctwh6 isolates to examine the production of cytokines that are associated with m1 / m2 , bmmphis were challenged with tachyzoites of tgctwh3 and tgctwh6 .
the data indicated that tgctwh6 isolate , rather than tgctwh3 , induced a significant increase of il - 12p40 and tnf - alpha ( figure 2a , 2b ) .
in concert with protein levels , bmmphis infected with tgctwh6 also showed elevated mrna expression of il - 12p40 and tnf - alpha ( figure 2c , 2d ) .
figure 2 tgctwh3 and tgctwh6 induced different levels of cytokines .
( a and b ) bmmphis were infected with either rh , or pru , or tgctwh3 or tgctwh6 tachyzoites , and 24 hr later supernatants were harvested and cytokine production of il - 12p40 ( a ) and tnf - alpha ( b ) were determined by elisa .

tgctwh3 and tgctwh6 down - regulated cd80 , cd86 and mhcii molecule expression on macrophages several studies showed that macrophages infected with t. gondii differently regulated the levels of mhc ii and co - stimulatory molecules [ 19 - 21 ] .
since the genotype china 1 differs from the archetypal i , ii and iii strains , the surface expression of cd80 , cd86 and mhc class ii molecules on peritoneal macrophages of infected mice was quantified by flow cytometry ( figure 3a ) .
the results indicated that both wh3 - mphi and wh6 - mphi expressed lower f4 / 80 than uninfected macrophages , and there was no significant difference in mean fluorescence intensity ( mfi ) for f4 / 80 on wh3 - mphi vs wh6 - mphi ( figure 3c ) .
additionally , neither wh3 - mphi nor wh6 - mphi could up - regulate the expression of cd80 , cd86 and mhc class ii molecules ( figure 3d ) .
figure 3 cell surface markers in uninfected macrophages , wh3 - mphi and wh6 - mphi .
( a ) after three days postinfection , mice were euthanized and pecs were harvested .
three hours later adherent peritoneal macrophages were collected and stained for f4 / 80 , cd80 , cd86 and mhc class ii .
( b ) as in ( a ) , wh3 - mphi and wh6 - mphi were stained for f4 / 80 , pd - l1 , pd - l2 and cd206 .
flow cytometry graphs show histograms of f4 / 80 - gated macrophages ( dotted lines , the isotype control ; solid lines , uninfected macrophages ; heavy lines , wh3 - mphi ; tinted and hairline , wh6 - mphi ) .
( c , d and e ) mfis of f4 / 80 ( c ) , cd80 , cd86 and mhc class ii molecule ( d ) , pd - l1 , pd - l2 and cd206 ( e ) on uninfected macrophages , wh3 - mphi or wh6 - mphi are displayed (# p > 0.05 , * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 ,*** p < 0.001 , wh3 - mphi or wh6 - mphi vs uninfected mphi ) .
data are representative of five independent experiments .
wh3 - mphi up - regulated pd - l2 and cd206 whereas wh6 - mphi modestly expressed pd - l1 to determine the activation state of macrophages , the expression of cd206 , pd - l1 and pd - l2 on peritoneal macrophages of mice was investigated .
the results revealed that tgctwh3 was able to strongly promote pd - l2 expression and wh3 - mphi was stained positive for cd206 , with mfi being 112.78 +/ - 19.91 and 105.32 +/ - 25.59 , respectively ( figure 3b , 3e ) .
therefore , wh3 - mphi displayed features similar to alternative activated macrophages ( m2 ) .
in contrast , relative to resident peritoneal macrophages , wh6 - mphi modestly up - regulated the expression of pd - l1 and pd - l2 with mfi being 139.83 +/ - 20.82 vs 27.86 +/ - 4.88 ( p < 0.001 ) and 37.48 +/ - 10.34 vs 5.97 +/ - 2.96 ( p < 0.01 ) , respectively ( figure 3b , 3e ) .
wh6 - mphi generated high level of no whereas wh3 - mphi up - regulated ym1 and arginase expression to further explore the phenotypic features of activated macrophages infected by tgctwh3 or tgctwh6 strains , a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays were performed on no and arginase activity , expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) , arginase - 1 ( arg - 1 ) and ym1 at transcription and protein levels .
as a result , wh6 - mphi gave rise to robust production of no which was 14 - fold higher than uninfected mphi ( figure 4a ) , while tgctwh3 infection elicited high arginase activity in macrophages as measured by the production of urea ( figure 4b ) .
figure 4 tgctwh6 induced high levels of no whereas wh3 - mphi had enhanced arginase activity .
( a ) on day 3 postinfection with tgctwh3 or tgctwh6 , mice were euthanized , and adherent peritoneal macrophages from harvested pecs were cultured for 12 h , then supernatants were collected and assayed for no .
( b ) arginase activity was measured in wh3 - mphi or wh6 - mphi lysates by the conversion of l - arginine to urea .
bars represent means +/ - sd from five independent experiments (# p > 0.05 , * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 ,*** p < 0.001 , wh3 - mphi or wh6 - mphi vs uninfected mphi ) .
( c ) as in ( b ) , infected bmmphis or raw264.7 cells ( 2:1 ratio of tachyzoites to cells ) were lyzed at 24 h postinfection , and arginase activity was measured (# p > 0.05 , *** p < 0.001 , tgctwh3 or tgctwh6 infected cells vs uninfected cells ) .
( d ) rna was extracted from either tgctwh3 - or tgctwh6 - infected or uninfected bmmphis at 24 h postinfection , and mrna was analyzed by real time - pcr .
housekeeping gene gapdh allowed normalization of the expression of the interested genes .
relative expressions of inos , ym1 and arginase - 1 were displayed .
bars represent means +/ - sd from three independent experiments (# p > 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 , tgctwh3 - or tgctwh6 - infected cells vs uninfected cells ) .
( e ) cell lysates collected from bmmphis infected with rh , pru , tgctwh3 , tgctwh6 or left uninfected at 24 h postinfection were subjected to western blotting using antibodies to inos , ym1 and arginase - 1 .
( f ) a quantitative analysis of the western blotting using densitometry ( normalized to beta - actin ) is shown (# p > 0.05 , * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 , either rh - or pru - or tgctwh3 - or tgctwh6 - infected cells vs uninfected cells ) .
this experiment was repeated three times with similar results .
to verify the in vivo observations , bmmphis or raw 264.7 cells were infected with either tgctwh3 or tgctwh6 isolates for 24 h and the arginase activity was measured .
the results indicated that bmmphis or raw 264.7 cells infected with tgctwh3 , rather than tgctwh6 , had high arginase activity ( figure 4c ) .
to test gene profiles , which are associated with the m1 or m2 phenotypes , the total rna was extracted from infected bmmphis at 24 h postinfection and the transcriptional response was analyzed by real time pcr ( figure 4d ) .
consistent with the elevated arginase activity stated above , bmmphis infected with tgctwh3 displayed a high level of arg - 1 mrna , 8 - fold higher than that with tgctwh6 .
the transcription level of ym1 , which encodes a chitinase - like secretory lectin , were also remarkably up - regulated in tgctwh3 infected bmmphis .
in terms of inos , tgctwh6 elicited a marked increase of mrna compared to uninfected macrophages , which was correlated to the no production .
cell lysates collected from bmmphis infected with tgctwh3 or tgctwh6 were subjected to western blotting in order to assay the protein expression of inos , arg - 1 and ym1 .
uninfected and rh - ( type i ) , pru - ( type ii ) infected bmmphis were run in parallel as control .
the data showed that rh infection elicited robust ym1 and high arg - 1 expression but no was undetectable ( figure 4e , 4f ) , in contrast to low ym1 on pru - infected macrophages .
bmmphis infected with tgctwh3 shared the features of high arg - 1 and ym1 expression , which were similar to those with rh strain , while tgctwh6 infection induced strong inos expression ( figure 4e , 4f ) .
high expression of arginase in m2 is associated with parasite proliferation to evaluate the effects of m1 or m2 on intracellular parasites , raw 264.7 cells , pretreated either with il - 4 plus il - 13 or ifn - gamma plus lps , were infected with tgctwh3 and tgctwh6 respectively , and assayed for arginase activity and parasite growth .
in general , arginase activity was enhanced in il - 4 and il - 13 - treated cells , especially in those co - infected with tgctwh3 ( figure 5a ) .
all raw 264.7 cells , when pre - exposed to ifn - gamma and lps , produced no or less urea .
moreover , the increased proliferation of tgctwh3 in il - 4 and il - 13 - treated cells was also obvious by counting the number of parasites per vacuole ( figure 5b - 5e ) .
figure 5 high arginase activity promoted parasite proliferation .
( a ) raw264.7 cells were either pre - stimulated with 100 ng / ml ifn - gamma and 100 ng / ml lps , or 20 ng / ml il - 4 plus 5 ng / ml il - 13 , or left unstimulated for 24 h , then left uninfected ( white bars ) or infected with tgctwh3 ( grey bars ) or tgctwh6 ( black bars ) for an additional 24 h ( 2:1 ratio of tachyzoites to cells ) , and assayed for arginase activity .
( b ) as in ( a ) , the cells were stained with wright - giemsa at 24 h after infection and parasite replication was determined by counting the number of parasites from 100 parasitophorous vacuoles by microscopy .
the bars depict the number of cells containing 1 - 3 parasites ( white bars ) or >= 4 parasites ( dark bars ) ( fisher 's exact test was used , * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , ifn - gamma plus lps vs control or il - 4 plus il - 13 ) .

tgctwh3 induced phospho - stat6 whereas tgctwh6 led to activation and nuclear translocation of nf - kappab p65 to observe nuclear translocation of the nf - kappab p65 subunit , hela cells were infected with either tgctwh3 or tgctwh6 and stained by immunofluorescence ( if ) .
it was found that the cells infected with tgctwh6 showed high levels of nf - kappab p65 in the nuclei , whereas no translocation or only low levels of nf - kappab p65 could be noted in the nuclei induced by tgctwh3 ( figure 6a , 6b ) .
figure 6 tgctwh3 and tgctwh6 induced activation of macrophages through different signal pathway .
( a and b ) hela cells were infected with tgctwh6 ( a ) or tgctwh3 ( b ) for 19 hr , fixed , and stained with anti - nf - kappab p65 ( red ) , anti - toxoplasma gondii p30 - fitc ( green ) , and hoechst dye ( blue ) .
arrow shows tachyzoites .
this experiment has been done five times with similar results .
( c and d ) total lysates were subjected to western blotting using corresponding antibodies ( for stat6 , py - stat6 , stat3 , p - stat3 , ikappabalpha , p - ikappabalpha and sag - 1 ) or nuclear lysates ( for nf - kappab p65 subunit ) .
the lysates were collected from bmmphis infected with either rh or pru or tgctwh3 or tgctwh6 or left uninfected ( 2:1 ratio of tachyzoites to cells ) at 24 h post - infection .
( e and f ) the fraction of phosphorylation was displayed. from the total stat6 , stat3 or ikappabalpha blot , the fraction of phosphorylated stat6 , stat3 or ikappabalpha was determined by comparing the intensity of the upper band ( phosphorylated form ) to the total intensity of the lower and upper band .
bars represent means +/ - sd from three independent experiments (# p > 0.05 , * p < 0.05 , *** p < 0.001 , either rh - or pru - or tgctwh3 - or tgctwh6 - infected cells vs uninfected cells ) .
( g ) the nuclear relative expression of nf - kappab p65 to nuclear actin using densitometry is also shown .
bars represent means +/ - sd (# p > 0.05 , * p < 0.05 , *** p < 0.001 ) .
this experiment was repeated three times with similar results .
to further determine the signaling pathway mediated by the isolates of genotype china 1 , we preformed western blotting with total lysates or nuclear lysates from bmmphis infected with either tgctwh3 or tgctwh6 .
our results showed that , similar to rh , tgctwh3 induced strong phosphorylation of stat6 and stat3 , whereas tgctwh6 triggered less phosphorylated stat6 and merely moderate activation of p - stat3 ( figure 6c , 6e ) .
moreover , results from western blotting with nuclear lysates demonstrated that , resembling pru strain , tgctwh6 tachyzoites were capable of causing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of nf - kappab p65 subunit ( figure 6d , 6g ) , which was correlated with the results from if. by contrast , this response was significantly attenuated in virulent tgctwh3 tachyzoites .
since the phosphorylation and degradation of an inhibitory protein ikappabalpha triggers the nuclear translocation of nf - kappab transcription factor , the expression of phospho - ikappabalpha was also detected .
in parallel with nuclear nf - kappab p65 , the level of phospho - ikappabalpha in cells infected with tgctwh6 was obviously higher than in cells infected with tgctwh3 ( figure 6d , 6f ) .
discussion recently we have identified several genotypes of toxoplasma isolates from humans and animals , among them the type china 1 is a dominant clonal lineage prevalent in china [ 12,14,22 ] .
the present study showed that tgctwh3 and tgctwh6 strains dramatically differ in virulence to mice and trigger macrophage - biased activation .
here we found that virulent tgctwh3 isolate induces the alternatively activated macrophage ( m2 ) phenotype characters by presenting high arginase expression and activity , and stat6 activation associated with low - level il - 12p40 production. by contrast , less virulent tgctwh6 isolate activates macrophages similar to classically activated macrophages ( m1 ) with phosphorylation of nf - kappab p65 and high secretion of il - 12p40 .
similar to earlier findings that avirulent t. gondii strain nte could down - regulate the expression of mhc class ii molecules [ 20 ] , the present results revealed that both wh3 - mphi and wh6 - mphi were completely negative for induction of mhc - ii expression ( figure 3a , 3d ) .
additionally , neither wh3 - mphi nor wh6 - mphi could up - regulate cd80 or cd86 expression , which differs from the reports stating that both molecules , or only cd80 / cd86 expression , were up - regulated in toxoplasma - infected cells [ 19,23 ] .
this discrepancy might be the result of different cell types and parasite genotypes used in the studies .
it is presumed that down - regulation of cd80 and cd86 along with negative expression of mhc class ii molecules might represent a straightforward strategy for china 1 isolates to attenuate the interaction of parasitised antigen presenting cells with specific cd4 + t lymphocytes , as long as the infected cells express insufficient amounts of mhc class ii molecules and co - stimulatory signals to stimulate t cell activation .
in addition to expression of cd206 , pd - l2 ( figure 3b ) and high arginase activity ( figure 4b , 4c ) , tgctwh3 - infected macrophages possess traits similar to m2 , such as up - regulation of arg - 1 and ym1 at both transcription and protein levels ( figure 4d , 4e ) .
just as murry [ 24 ] speculated that t. gondii i / iii strains induce m2 activation bypassing the requirement for exogenous il - 4 and il - 13 , it might be unlikely that endogenous il - 4 participates in the skewing of tgctwh3 - infected macrophages , since no il - 4 production was detectable in the supernatants ( data not shown ) .
moreover , it is likely that at an early time of infection , with the activation of m2 , the induction of arg - 1 could be exploited by tgctwh3 to promote its growth as described previously ( figure 5 ) [ 25,26 ] .
early low levels of il - 12 and tnf - alpha ( figure 2 ) [ 27 ] and migratory dendritic cells and macrophages hijacked by t. gondii for parasite dissemination [ 28 ] may attribute to later high parasite loads and organ damage [ 29 ] .
there is plenty of evidence indicating that t. gondii actively interferes with host cell signaling during intracellular infection [ 6,30 - 32 ] .
the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( stat ) signaling pathway as well as nf - kappab signaling cascade have emerged as two major targets of exploitation by t. gondii [ 6,33 ] .
previous data revealed that a single rop16 polymorphism at position 503 determines the strain difference with respect to stat3 activation [ 34 ] , which negatively affects nf - kappab signal pathway , leads to suppression of il - 12 , and induces differentiation of the infected cells into immune suppressive macrophages [ 35,36 ] .
besides , the type i / iii rop16 is capable of directly catalyzing tyrosine phosphorylation of stat6 [ 3,33,37,38 ] , and responsible for m2 polarization [ 3 ] .
here , we found that although sharing the same 503leu in rop16 ( additional files show this in more detail [ see additional file 1 and additional file 2 ]) and inducing activation of p - stat3 resemble rh strain , tgctwh3 and tgctwh6 isolates trigger notable difference in phosphorylation of stat6 , and promote disparate bias of macrophages .
our results suggest that in addition to rop16 , other potential effector molecules ( e.g. rop18 , data not shown ) might be involved in the activation of macrophage polarization in china 1 isolates .
on the other hand , macrophages infected with tgctwh6 give rise to a high production of il - 12p40 and no , enhanced expression of inos on mrna and protein levels ( figure 4 ) , as well as phospho - ikappabalpha and nuclear translocation of nf - kappab p65 ( figure 6 ) .
therefore , it is reasonable to conclude that tgctwh6 strain activates nf - kappab pathway and induces m1 - like cells .
thus , tgctwh6 possesses the features similar to the type ii strains ( e.g. , pru ) , such as less virulence and encystation , induction of high il - 12p40 and activation of nf - kappab pathway , in spite of alteration of amino acid at 503 of rop16 and activation of stat3 .
further studies are needed to disclose the polymorphism gra15 of tgctwh6 isolate and the polymorphism - associated pathogenesis based on the evidence that type ii gra15 determines m1 polarization [ 3 ] .
in conclusion , the results indicate that both tgctwh3 and tgctwh6 isolates may elicit macrophage - biased responses in different pathways .
tgctwh3 induces activated macrophages resembling m2 through phosphorylation of stat6 , whereas tgctwh6 activates nf - kappab pathway and promotes infected macrophages to skew to a m1 phenotype .
the demonstration of different phenotypes among china 1 isolates may be due to the fact that restriction fragment length polymorphism ( rflp ) analysis , although valuable for structural population approach , captures only a fraction but not all of the genetic diversity at a given locus .
hence , differences in virulence , cytokine induction and macrophage activation of both isolates make more thorough genetic analysis and analysis of other effectors essential , which may help elucidate the mechanism of the immune response during acute and latent infection with toxoplasma and better understand the influence of strain genotype on human toxoplasmosis .
conclusions the present study demonstrated that macrophages infected with toxodb # 9 strains of different virulence were polarized toward different activation states through disparate signaling pathway , which may ultimately influence the ability of toxoplasma to establish a chronic infection .
to our knowledge , this is the first report of macrophage activation induced by toxodb # 9 parasites isolated from china .
further studies on other effector molecules may help understand how toxodb # 9 strains regulate immune responses and provide important clues to disclosure of their essential variance .

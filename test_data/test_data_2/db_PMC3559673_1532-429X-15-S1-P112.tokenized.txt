recent technological advancements in cmr have made evaluation of cardiac valves more reliable .
however , there are no studies in the literature that compare semi - quantitative grading ( sqg ) using cmr ssfp sequences with quantitative grading ( qg ) based on stroke volumes and phase velocity mapping ( pvm ). we propose sqg of cardiac valvular regurgitations based on cmr ssfp sequences is feasible and highly correlative with standard cmr qg methods .
methods cmr data between jan 2007 to dec 2011 was prospectively evaluated for valvular regurgitant lesions .
patients were included if they had right and left ventricular volumetrics based on cmr ssfp sequences and pvm across the aortic and pulmonic valves with reported regurgitant volumes and fractions .
patients were excluded if they had prosthetic valves , cardiac arrhythmias and intra - cardiac shunts .
regurgitant lesions were semi - quantitatively ( visually ) graded on a standard scale of 0 to 4 ( trace , mild , moderate , moderate to severe and severe ) and compared with quantitative regurgitant fractions .
correlations were evaluated by spearman 's rho formula and kappa ( kappa ) for intra and inter observer variability were obtained on 30 % of study sample .
results ninety - seven , ( n = 97 ) patients representing 134 valvular regurgitations ( mr , ar , tr , and pr ) were analyzed by semi - quantitative and quantitative methods .
there were 58 males ( 60 %) and the average age of the patients was 55 +/ - 18 years .
there were 44 mitral , 50 aortic , 29 tricuspid and 11 pulmonary regurgitant lesions .
the correlation between sqr vs. qg yielded the following results : 0.67 p < 0.001 ( mr , r = 0.66 , p < 0.001 ; ar , r = 0.68 , p < 0.002 ; tr , 0.68 , p = 0.001 ; pr = 0.70 , p = 0.017 ) .
the results for qg vs. sqg accounting for clinically significant differences of +/ - 1 grade for the group were as follows : 0.95 p < 0.001 ( mr , r = 0.91 , p < 0.001 ; ar , r = 0.96 , p < 0.001 ; tr , r = 0.99 , p < 0.001 ; pr , r = 0.93 , p < 0.001 ) .
no discrepancy between surgical regurgitation was present ( 3 + vs. 4 +) .
weighted kappa results were 0.67 and 0.61 for intra and inter observer variability representing good correlation .
conclusions visual assessment of cardiac regurgitant lesions is reliable , accurate and reproducible when compared to formal quantitative analysis via cmr confirming robust role for cmr in assessing regurgitant lesions particularly when assessing for surgical decision - making .

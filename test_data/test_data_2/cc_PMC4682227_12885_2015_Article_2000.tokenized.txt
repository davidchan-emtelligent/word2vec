background we examined the anti - tumor effect and radiosensitizing potential of a small molecule inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptor ( fgfr ) in colorectal cancer ( crc ) in vitro and in vivo .
methods effects of in vitro drug treatment on cell survival , proliferation , fgfr signaling , cell cycle distribution , apoptosis and radiosensitivity were assessed using various crc cell lines with fgfr wild type ( caco2 and hca7 ) and fgfr2 amplification ( hct116 , nci - h716 ) .
in vivo tumor responses to fgfr inhibition with and without radiation therapy were evaluated by growth delay assays in two colorectal xenograft mouse models ( nmri nu / nu mice injected with nci - h716 or caco2 cells ) .
mechanistic studies were conducted using western blot analysis , immunohistochemistry and qpcr .
results in the tested cell lines , the fgfr inhibitor ( jnj - 42756493 ) was effective in vitro and in vivo in crc tumors with highest expression of fgfr2 ( nci - h716 ) .
in vitro , cell proliferation in this line was decreased , associated with increased apoptotic death and decreased cell survival .
in vivo , growth of nci - h716 tumors was delayed by 5 days by drug treatment alone , although when drug delivery was stopped the relative tumor volume increased compared to control .
the fgfr inhibitor did not radiosensitize nci - h716 tumors either in vitro or in vivo .
conclusions among tested crc cell lines , the growth inhibitory activity of this fgfr inhibitor was evident in cell lines with high constitutive fgfr2 expression , suggesting that fgfr addiction may provide a window for therapeutic intervention , though caution is advised .
preclinical study with nci - h716 and caco2 tumor demonstrated that continued presence of drug could be essential for tumor growth control , especially in cells with aberrant fgfr expression .
in the tested set - up , the inhibitor showed no radiosensitizing effect .

keywords colorectal cancer cancer therapy fgfr in vitro in vivo radiotherapy issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background the standard treatment for patients with rectal cancer is chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery , but 30 % of these patients develop local and distant recurrences [ 1 ] .
therefore , an intensification of the preoperative treatment , particularly through the use of molecular targeted agents , could be beneficial .
fibroblast growth factors ( fgfs ) and their receptors are recognized oncogenes associated with a variety of cancers , including colorectal cancer ( crc ) , and are therefore attractive therapeutic targets .
the mammalian fgf family comprises 18 ligands , which act through 4 fgfrs ( fgfr1 , fgfr2 , fgfr3 and fgfr4 ) [ 2 , 3 ] .
binding to the receptors causes activation of two key downstream pathways : the mitogen - activated protein kinase - extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( mapk - erk ) and phosphoinositide3 - kinase ( pi3k ) - akt pathway [ 3 ] , which mediate several physiological responses during embryonic development and in the adult organism , including angiogenesis , tissue repair and hematopoiesis [ 4 ] .
dysregulated expression of many fgfs and all four fgfrs has been reported in crc , especially for fgfr2 [ 5 - 11 ] .
the effectiveness of fgfr2 - targeting therapy for crc has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo illustrating the potential of fgfr2 as novel molecular target for crc [ 7 ] .
the effects of fgfr pathway inhibition in combination with radiotherapy have not been investigated extensively but inhibition of the cell cycle and angiogenesis could augment the tumor response [ 12 , 13 ] , as could drug - induced impairment of dna repair [ 14 ] .
the main objective of our study was to mechanistically evaluate the effects of a pan - fgfr tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( jnj - 42756493 ) with and without radiotherapy .
our hypothesis was first evaluated in vitro in several established human colorectal cell lines .
since the in vitro setup does not allow us taking into account the influence of the tumor - micro environment , the most promising human colorectal cell lines were in a second step injected in nude mice ( nmri nu / nu ) allowing us to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of this treatment scheme .
methods cells and cell culture several human colorectal cell lines were used : hct116 , hca7 ( european collection of cell culture , salisbury , uk ) , caco2 and nci - h716 ( american type culture collection , manassas , va , usa ) .
hct116 cells were maintained at 37 degreesc in a humidified incubator with 5 % carbon dioxide / 95 % air atmosphere in mccoys5a + glutamax ( l - alanyl - l - glutamine ) , hca7 in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium and caco2 and nci - h716 cells in rpmi 1640 + glutamax - i medium , all supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( invitrogen , carlsbad , california , usa ) .
for hca7 and caco2 cells 1 % sodiumpyruvate ( invitrogen ) was added .
results on hct116 and hca7 cells are in additional file 1 : figure e1 and additional file 2 : figure e2 .
fgfr inhibitor an atp - competitive small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor against fgfr1 - 4 ( jnj - 42756493 ) was provided by janssen pharmaceutica .
jnj - 42756493 is a potent , oral pan - fgfr tyrosine kinase inhibitor with half - maximal inhibitory concentration values in the low nanomolar range for all members of the fgfr family ( fgfr1 to fgfr4 ) , with minimal activity on vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( vegfr ) kinases compared with fgfr kinases ( approximately 20 - fold potency difference ) [ 15 ] .
the drug was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide ( sigma , st. louis , mo , usa ) prior to dilution for in vitro use and in cylodextrin as vehicle for in vivo experiments .
vehicle controls were used where appropriate .
cell viability the effect of varying drug concentrations on cell growth and survival was evaluated at 72 h using sulforhodamine b ( srb ) assay for the adherent cells ( hct116 , hca7 , caco2 ) [ 16 ] and trypan blue dye exclusion for the suspension cells , nci - h716 .
flow cytometry flow cytometry experiments were performed using bd facs canto ( becton dickinson , franklin lakes , nj , usa ) and analyzed using bd facs diva software .
cell cycle after treatment with varying drug doses , for 24 or 72 h , cells were fixed with 70 % ethanol and stained with 10 mug / ml propidium iodide ( sigma )/ 100 mug / ml rnasea ( invitrogen ) solution .
cell proliferation cells were labeled with 75 mum bromodeoxyuridine ( brdu ) ( sigma ) and counterstained for dna with propidium iodide after 24 h drug treatment .
anti - brdu - fitc antibody was added ( becton dickinson , san jose , ca , usa ) after dna denaturation with 2 n hcl / triton x - 100 and neutralization with sodium borate .
apoptosis apoptosis was determined using the annexin - v - fluos detection kit ( roche , hague - road , in , usa ) 72 h after drug treatment .
clonogenic assays cells were incubated in the presence of drug at various concentrations .
after incubation , cells were irradiated in suspension with 2 , 4 or 6 gy on a clinical linear accelerator ( varian , palo alto , ca , usa ) using 6 mega volt photons and seeded in triplicate into 10 - cm culture dishes ( caco2 ) or diluted into 0.3 % soft agar onto 0.5 % solidified agar in 10 - cm culture dishes ( nci - h716 ) .
after 12 or 21 days incubation for caco2 and nci - h716 cells respectively , colonies were fixed and stained with crystal violet .
colonies (>= 50 cells ) were counted with colcount ( tm ) colony counter ( oxford optronic , oxford , uk ) and survival fractions were calculated .
mice animal experiments were approved by the animal ethics committee of the catholic university leuven and performed in a licensed a1 laboratory by staff with the required felasa certificates taking into account the 3r 's of the use of animals in research .
since we need immune deficient mice to develop our xenograft models with human cell lines , nmri nu / nu female mice ( janvier , saint - berthevin , france ) were used .
at the start of the experiment , the mice were on average 7 weeks ( 6 - 8 weeks ) and had an average weight of 29.5 g ( 22 - 33 ) .
the mice were housed in individually ventilated cages with a maximum of 4 mice per cage in a room with a controlled light / day cycle and controlled temperature .
sample size calculation the drug tested in the current proposal will be considered effective if it can prolong the growth delay of the tumors with a minimum of 5 days .
taking into account the effect of 5 days , a standard deviation of 2 days , an alpha value of 0.05 and a power of 0.80 , the minimal sample size is three .
we divided each treatment group into 2 subgroups ; one group to assess the immediate molecular effects ( tp1 ) and one group for the tumor growth delay assay ( tp2 ) .
therefore , a minimum of 6 mice per group was included in the experiment .
all in vivo experiments were repeated twice .
the data shown in the manuscript are representative of one of two independent experiments .
xenograft models the mice were inoculated in both flanks with 3 * 106 of caco2 or 5 * 106 of nci - h716 cells in matrigel ( bd biosciences , bedford , ma , usa ) subcutaneously in both flanks .
when tumors were on average 100 mm3 , the mice were randomized in 4 treatment groups ( control , radiotherapy , fgfr inhibitor , radiotherapy + fgfr inhibitor ) .
each mice had two tumours ( one in each flank ) and the tumours were used as unit for the statistical analyses .
the mice in the different groups were matched for tumour size to allow a good comparison of the treatment effect in all groups .
the characteristics of the mice can be found in tables 1 and 2 for the nci - h716 and caco2 experiment respectively .

the vehicle used was also cyclodextrin .
both the vehicle and the drugs were administered in the morning three times a week for three weeks by gavage .
at the end of the second week ( day 12 ) of drug treatment , the tumors were irradiated with 5 gy ( nci - h716 ) or 10 gy ( caco2 ) with a clinical linear accelerator ( varian , palo alto , ca , usa ) using 16 mega electron volt ( mev ) .
during the irradiation , the mice were anesthetized with nembutal ( ceva , brussels , belgium ) .
experimental outcomes the experimental outcomes included a growth delay assay to assess the growth inhibiting effect as well as the radiosensitizing effect of the drug and the assessment of molecular changes in the tumours after treatment .
treatment response was evaluated by tumor growth delay using thrice - weekly caliper measurements .
mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation either at the end of the anti - fgfr treatment ( time - point 1 ( tp1 )) ( 5 mice / group ) or when tumors were > 2000 mm3 ( time - point 2 ( tp2 )) ( 5 - 7 mice / group ) .
thirty minutes before sacrifice , mice were injected with 60 mg / kg pimonidazole ( hypoxyprobe , burlington , ma , usa ) .
part of each tumor was fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemistry and part was snap frozen for protein and mrna analyses .
irradiation irradiation was delivered to the cells or tumor site with a clinical linear accelerator .
in vitro , the cells were irradiated with 6 mev photons ( dose rate of 2.4gy / min ) for irradiation of cells in suspension ( 2 , 4 , 6gy ) .
in vivo , the tumors were irradiated with 16 mev electrons with a dose rate of 3gy / min .
for the nci - h716 xenograft model , a single dose of 5 gy was used .
tumors of the caco2 xenograft model were irradiated with a single dose of 10gy .
the in vitro and in vivo radiation setups were calculated by the department of radiation oncology and recalculated on a regular basis .
gene expression quantitative pcr ( qpcr ) was used to measure copy numbers for all four fgfrs in cell lines and fgfr2 , fgf1 , fgf2 , vegf - a , plgf , vegfr1 and vegfr2 of mouse and human origin in xenografted tumors .
rna was isolated by the qiagen rneasy mini kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) .
rna was reverse transcribed using the superscript vilo cdna synthesis kit ( invitrogen ) followed by qpcr reactions with the lightcycler 480 ( roche , mannheim , germany ) .
reactions were carried out on cdna from cultured cells with lightcycler 480 sybr green i master ( roche ) and self - designed primers ( idt , coralville , ia , usa ) .
reactions on cdna from tumors were performed with taqman fast universal pcr master mix ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) using premade probes ( applied biosystems / idt ) ( additional file 3 : table e1 ) .
western blotting cell and tumor lysates were prepared in lysis buffer as described before [ 17 ] .
total protein amount was measured using the bradford method ( bio - rad , hercules , ca , usa ) .
10 - 30 mug of proteins was subjected to electrophoresis on nupage gels ( invitrogen ) .
immunoblotting was performed with antibodies recognizing phospho - fgfr ( 1:1000 ) , akt ( 1:1000 ) , phospho - akt ( 1:500 ) , phospho - erk ( 1:500 ) , parp ( 1:1000 ) , cleaved parp ( 1:1000 ) , or beta - actin ( 1:1000 ) from cell signaling technology ( beverly , ma ) and fgfr2 ( 1:400 ) ( r & d , minneapolis , mn , usa ) or erk2 ( 1:1000 ) ( santa cruz biotechnology , dallas , tx , usa ) , followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1:3000 ) ( cell signaling ; ge healthcare , little chalfont , uk ) .
immunohistochemical staining and analysis after antigen retrieval and blocking , tumor sections were incubated overnight at 4 degreesc with anti - pimonidazole ( 1 / 400 , hypoxyprobe ) , anti - caspase - 3 ( ready to use , biocare medical ) or anti - cd31 ( 1 / 200 , bc biosciences ) ; or for 30 min at room temperature with anti - ki67 ( ready to use , thermo scientific ) .
appropriate secondary antibodies followed by 3.3 ' - diaminobenzidine ( dab ) substrate ( dako , glostrup , denmark ) were used to visualize antigen presence .
protocol details are in additional file 4 : table e2 .
tumor hypoxic and apoptotic fractions were determined by the percentage of pimonidazole - and caspase - 3 positive cells respectively , the latter using the method of going [ 18 ] .
ki67 positive nuclei were counted as an index of proliferation and cd31 used to determine the number of blood vessels per field for 20 fields per tissue specimen as a measure of micro vessel density ( mvd ) .
statistical analysis statistical analyses used a one - way analysis of variance with tukey 's multiple comparison tests for in vitro comparisons and a mann - whitney u test for in vivo tumor growth delay .
for the in vivo experiments , the single tumours were used as unit of analysis .
immunohistochemical and qpcr data from in vivo studies were analyzed using a two - tailed student 's t - test when the data complied with the conditions of normality and equal variance .
under other conditions , comparisons were carried out by nonparametric analysis using the mann - whitney rank - sum test .
the kolmogorov - smirnov method was used to test for normality .
a significance level of p = 0.05 was used in all cases .
statistics were calculated using statistica software 12 ( statsoft inc , tulsa , ok ) .
results anti - tumor activity in vitro all four fgfrs were detected by qpcr in all crc cell lines in vitro ( fig. 1a ) .
highest expression , as compared to the household gene hprt , was for the fgfr2 gene in nci - h716 ( 48 fold ) and caco2 cells ( 4 fold ) ( p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 1a ) .
in agreement with these findings , fgfr inhibition significantly decreased cell growth and survival of nci - h716 cells at concentrations of >= 0.5nm ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas >= 5000nm was required for all other cell lines , including caco2 ( fig. 1b , additional file 1 : figure e1a ) .
in nci - h716 cells fgfr2 mrna expression increased in a dose - dependent manner after drug treatment ( additional file 2 : figure e2a ) while protein expression , which was detectable only in this cell line , decreased ( fig. 1c ) .
also p - fgfr protein levels decreased upon treatment , confirming fgfr inhibition .
no other changes in mrna or protein expression were noted in any of the cell lines for any of the fgfrs ( additional file 2 : figure e2a , additional file 1 : figure e1b and fig. 1c ) .
based on these data , nci - h716 and caco2 cell lines were chosen for further in vitro and in vivo experimentation. fig. 1 anti - tumor activity in vitro .

the g2 / m and s subpopulations were significantly decreased after 24 h incubation with 5nm drug ( p < 0.05 ; fig. 2a ) and this was confirmed by decreased s - phase brdu labeling ( p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 2b ) .
the increase in apoptosis suggested by the changes in the sub - g1 population ( fig. 2a ) was confirmed by annexin - v labeling at 0.5nm ( p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 2c ) .

relative tumor volume of nci - h716 tumors was delayed by drug treatment by 5 days ( p < 0.05 ) , with an increase in volume of on average 24.1 % of pretreatment values at 1 week ( - 15.9 - 92.73 %) while the control group increased by 88.2 % ( - 30.3 - 257.2 %) ( p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 4 ) .
however when drug treatment was stopped , the relative tumor volume significantly increased between day 25 and 30 compared to vehicle treatment .
the average increase in tumor volume one week after the end of drug treatment was 129.4 % ( 63.9 - 208.4 %) for the experimental group and 31.1 % ( - 25.2 - 89.1 %) for the control group ( p < 0.05 ) .

at later time points ( tp2 ) , these effects disappeared as illustrated by an increase in proliferation ( p < 0.05 ) , hypoxia ( n.s. ) and necrosis ( p < 0.05 ) and decrease in mvd ( p < 0.05 ) while the apoptotic index was unaltered ( fig. 5b ). fig. 5 reversible in vivo action .

human and murine vegf - a and plgf mrna expression was also decreased ( p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 5d ) .
these effects were lost at tp2 ( fig. 5c ) , when in fact vegf - a and plgf mrna expression was markedly increased in the drug - treated group ( p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 5e ) .
in contrast with the in vitro mrna expression data , tumors harvested at tp1 showed reduced human and murine fgfr2 expression levels as compared to control tumors ( n.s . )
( additional file 2 : figure e2b ) .
combination treatment in vivo to assess the radiosensitizing effect of the drug , the tumor growth of mice in the treatment group with only irradiation ( group2 ) were compared with the group receiving both radiation therapy and the fgfr inhibitor ( group 4 ) ( tables 1 and 2 ) .
while irradiation with 5 gy ( nci - h716 ) or 10 gy ( caco2 ) slowed tumor growth in both models , the addition of fgfr inhibitor did not radiosensitize either ( fig. 6a , b ) .
on the other hand irradiation with 5 gy prevented the relative accelerated growth of nci - h716 tumors following drug withdrawal .
no adverse events were observed in any of the experimental groups. fig. 6 radiosensitizing effect in vivo .

discussion targeting pathways that are dysregulated in cancer promise to improve tumor control and increase patient survival , but it is an approach that may generally have to be combined with conventional cytotoxic therapies like radiotherapy .
different inhibitors against the fgfr pathway have been tested as monotherapy or in combination with other targeted drugs for different cancer types with promising preclinical and clinical results [ 19 - 23 ] .
however , the radiosensitizing effect of fgfr inhibition has not been extensively investigated .
in the tested cell lines , this fgfr inhibitor showed potent and selective anti - tumor activity against the cell line with known fgfr2 amplification ( nci - h716 ) , compared with other cell lines with low / not detected protein expression of fgfr2 ( caco2 , hct116 and hca7 ) .
the nci - h716 cell line displayed high constitutive p - fgfr expression both in vitro and in vivo that was strongly inhibited by the drug .
this is in agreement with other reports [ 21 , 24 - 30 ] and with the first clinical data obtained with this inhibitor [ 15 ] .
proliferation of nci - h716 cells was abolished , consistent with blockage of the erk pathway , followed by dramatic increase in apoptosis and significant decrease in cell survival , in agreement with recent published findings where fgfr inhibition indeed exerted pro - apoptotic effects in vitro [ 29 , 30 ] .
these events were reflected at the molecular level by an increase in the apoptotic marker cleaved parp and inhibition of the pro - survival akt pathway .
in agreement with earlier data with other fgfr specific inhibitors , fgfr inhibition in the nci - h716 xenograft model resulted initially in tumor growth delay with decreased tumor cell proliferation and inhibition of erk activation , which is known to be a major downstream target of activated fgfrs [ 20 , 30 , 31 ] .
however , when the drug was withdrawn , the ratio of nci - h716 tumor volume in vivo accelerated dramatically .
this was reflected in an increase in relative proliferation compared to controls , the magnitude of which have outstripped angiogenesis as seen in an increase in the ratio of expression of angiogenic factors , decreased mvd and increased necrosis .
based on the in vitro expression data , this relatively accelerated proliferation may have been due to the fact that drug treatment increased fgfr2 mrna expression while decreasing fgfr2 signaling .
the pathway may therefore have been primed cells for accelerated recovery when the drug was withdrawn .
in vivo qpcr data is inconsistent with this reasoning with a trend showing a decreased fgfr2 mrna expression in treated tumors .
however , tumoral human fgfr2 expression was much lower than levels detected in the cell line , which might indicate that stromal cells and necrotic tissue in tumors might dilute the signals , possibly explaining this contradiction .
very detailed kinetic analyses may be needed to fully evaluate this hypothesis in absence of any obvious gross effects on the molecular pathways in this study .
in spite of the major effects of the drug on tumor cell proliferation and survival , it did not radiosensitize tumors in vitro or in vivo .
several mutually agonistic and antagonistic factors may be operating in these complex systems .
cell cycle analysis showed that fgfr inhibition leads to a decrease of cells in the g2 / m phase , being the most radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle [ 32 ] , but also a decrease in radioresistant s phase cells .
the decrease in tumor proliferation upon fgfr inhibition could hamper the efficacy of the radiation .
similar data have been described by our group with the egfr inhibitor cetuximab [ 33 ] .
it should be noted that even these low doses of radiation that were used effectively abolished the relatively accelerated proliferation that followed drug withdrawal .
this was associated with effects on tumor cell proliferation and a decrease in mvd , which may have been due to the well - known effect of irradiation on angiogenesis [ 34 ] .
however it is clear from our in vivo experiment that in the current set - up the fgfr inhibitor does not has a radiosensitizing effect in the crc cell lines tested .
it would be interesting to determine whether another treatment scheme where fgfr inhibition is started after , and not before , irradiation would be a more effective therapy by inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor cell repopulation .
we also have to be aware of some limitations of the study .
in our study we focused only on crc cell lines and not on other tumor types , such as endometrial , gastric and breast cancer , were deregulation of the fgfr pathway has been shown to be implicated in cancer [ 3 ] .
also within our crc cell lines tested , only one of them showed aberrant fgfr expression .
consequently we do not know the effect of the drug on crc harboring other fgfr deregulations apart from fgfr2 overexpression .
furthermore , our in vivo experiments were performed in mice with a deficient immune system .
therefore the effect that the immune system could have in the response to this combined treatment was not taken into account .
further research on a larger set of cancer cell lines in needed .
also combining the drug with other targeted agents and chemotherapeutics could be interesting .
conclusions in summary , the fgfr inhibitor used in this study mediated effective cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo , but only in cells with aberrant fgfr2 expression [ 35 ] .
these results underline the dependency of cancer cells upon oncogenic fgfrs which provides a therapeutic opportunity for selective intervention by fgfr inhibitors .
proper patient selection based on fgfr2 status of the tumor will be critical when testing the inhibitor in future clinical trials .
however , at least for this agent , the continued presence of drug seems essential and its absence may cause accelerated tumor regrowth .
based on our data , this inhibitor does not augment the cytotoxicity of radiotherapy , but radiotherapy may prevent accelerated tumor regrowth in crc cell line .
further investigations into how best to optimize their delivery with conventional therapies are needed .

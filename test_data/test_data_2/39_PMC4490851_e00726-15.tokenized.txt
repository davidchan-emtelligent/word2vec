we report the genome sequence of salmonella enterica subsp .
enterica serovar give ( cfsan012622 ) , isolated from imported chili powder in 2014 .
this genome contains genes previously reported to be specific only to s. enterica serovar enteritidis .
this strain shows a unique pulsed - field gel electrophoresis ( pfge ) pattern clustering with serovar enteritidis ( jeg x01.0005 ) .
cover - datejuly / august 2015 genome announcement the united states is one of the largest spice importers on the basis of both volume and value ( http :// www.ers.usda.gov / data - products / food - availability - % 28per - capita % 29 - data - system.aspx ) , importing more than 80 % of its total spice supply ( 1 ) .
contamination by salmonella was the cause of 95 % of the u.s. food recalls associated with spices between the years 1980 - 2000 ( 2 ) and three large - scale salmonellosis outbreaks in the united states attributed to consumption of salmonella - contaminated spices / seasonings between 2007 and 2010 ( 3 , 4 ) ( http :// www.cdph.ca.gov / programs / dfdrs / documents / qss _ presentation _ srissen _ and _% 20white % 20pepper _ 010611.pdf ) .
a major fda investigation into the prevalence of salmonella in dried spices reported that nearly 7 % of imported shipments of spice offered for entry to the united states during 2007 to 2009 were contaminated , even though some spices may have been subjected to pathogen reduction treatments ( 1 ) .
during our recent surveillance of dried spices , the salmonella enterica subsp .
enterica serovar give ( cfsan012622 ) strain was isolated from an imported chili powder product using the bacteriological analytical manual ( bam ) salmonella culture method ( http :// www.fda.gov / food / foodscienceresearch / laboratorymethods / ucm070149.htm ) , then serotyped using luminex salmonella serotyping assay ( 5 - 7 ) and traditional serological methods ( 8 ) .
the serotype antigens were e : l , v : 1 , 7 .
pulse - field gel electrophoresis ( pfge ) using restriction enzyme xbai was performed according to cdc methods ( http :// www.cdc.gov / pulsenet / pdf / ecoli - shigella - salmonella - pfge - protocol - 508c.pdf ) .
this strain shows a unique pfge pattern , clustering with s. enteritidis with a pfge pattern jeg x01.0005 .
the genomic dna from cfsan012622 was isolated from overnight culture using the dneasy blood and tissue kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca ) , and its genome was sequenced using an illumina miseq ( illumina , san diego , ca ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
genomic sequence contigs were assembled using spades software version 3.0.0 , and the sequence was annotated using the ncbi prokaryotic genomes automatic annotation pipeline ( 9 ) .
genomic comparison was performed using clc genomics workbench 6.0.2 ( clc bio , denmark ) .
the genome for cfsan012622 is 4,735,685 bp long , containing dna regions matching salmonella difference fragments ( sdf ) regions i , iii , and iv , which have previously been reported only in s. enteritidis cahfs - 5 ( 10 ) .
this genome also carries genes ydao , lyga , lygd , lyge , lygf in the salmonella difference region i ( sdr i ) which had been reported as unique to s. enteritidis cahfs - 285 ( 10 ) .
genomic comparisons showed that draft genome of cfsan012622 has a 91.34 % match to the draft genome of cfsan004343 ( genbank accession no. ayuq00000000 ) , an s. give strain isolated from cow feces with 64,929 single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) difference .
two genomes of s. enteritidis strains ( s. enteritidis strains 13 - 1 and pt23 ) which have pfge pattern jeg x01.0005 clustering with s. give ( cfsan012622 ) were used for the genome comparison .
the draft genome of cfsan012622 has an 89.32 % match to the draft genome of s. enteritidis strain 13 - 1 ( genbank accession no. ahuq00000000 ) with a 61,156 snp difference .
the draft genome of cfsan012622 has an 89.29 % similarity to the draft genome of s. enteritidis strain pt23 ( genbank accession no. ahur00000000 ) with a 61,004 snp difference .
therefore , it is not surprising that the pcr used to specifically detect s. enteritidis targeting sdf gene generated a positive result for cfsan012622 .

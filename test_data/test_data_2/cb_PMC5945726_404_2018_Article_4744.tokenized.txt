purpose to evaluate the dietary intake of pregnant women and their nutritional status of ca , mg , fe , zn , and cu , as the nutritional status of pregnant women is an important factor for the proper progression of a pregnancy and the development and health of the foetus .
methods the study was conducted on 108 pregnant women ages 18 - 42 , at 6 - 32 weeks of gestation .
we used a questionnaire and a 24 - h recall nutrition interview .
hair samples were taken for testing and the level of each mineral was assessed using atomic absorption spectrometry .
the results were analysed using the dietetyk and statistica 10 software .
results low levels of fe , zn , ca , mg , vitamin d , and folic acid intake were seen in the pregnant women , with the use of dietary supplements significantly increasing their intake of fe , zn , and folic acid .
the concentration of zinc and magnesium in the women 's hair was shown to be affected by their age and , in the case of magnesium , by the week of pregnancy .
conclusions it was observed that the diet of pregnant women is characterised by low levels of fe , zn , ca , mg , vitamin d , and folic acid .
dietary supplementation with vitamins and minerals significantly increases the daily fe and folic acid intake in pregnant women .
the concentration of zn and mg in hair depends on the age of pregnant women and mg level in the hair of women decreases during pregnancy .
keywords pregnancy dietary habits minerals folic acid vitamin d issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer - verlag gmbh germany , part of springer nature 2018 introduction the dietary habits of pregnant women are important for the proper progression of pregnancy and the development and health of the foetus [ 1 - 6 ] .
during pregnancy , diets should be balanced in terms of macronutrients and micronutrients .
the daily energy requirements for healthy women of normal weight and who have a moderately active lifestyle , increase during pregnancy and are based on the trimester of the foetus [ 7 ] .
recommendations regarding the calorific value of pregnant women 's diets aim to prevent the development of obesity [ 8 ] .
as the pregnancy progresses , the woman 's need for protein increases , peaking in the third trimester .
the appropriate intake of protein in the diet supports the protein biosynthesis needed to supply the needs of maternal tissues , the placenta , and the growing foetus [ 8 ] .
the total fat intake , especially in the first trimester of pregnancy , should not increase significantly [ 8 ] .
studies conducted so far indicate the particular importance of micronutrients during pregnancy [ 9 ] .
iron deficiency in pregnant women is a cause of anaemia and predisposes women to urinary tract infections .
iron deficiency anaemia in pregnant women significantly correlates with a low birth weight of newborns and a higher risk of premature birth [ 10 , 11 ] .
the demand for iron during pregnancy increases significantly , especially in the third trimester [ 10 ] .
according to the current recommendations , the diet should deliver 27 mg of iron per day to pregnant women [ 12 ] .
calcium deficiencies in the diet of pregnant women lead to decreased bone density in both the mother and the child .
inadequate calcium intake also correlates with hypertension in a pregnant woman , and thus increases the risks of premature birth and newborn mortality [ 13 , 14 ] .
according to the current recommendations , the daily calcium requirement for pregnant women is 1200 - 2000 mg , and the maximum tolerated dose is set at 2500 mg [ 15 ] , although there is limited evidence for calcium supplementation in preeclampsia prevention [ 16 ] .
during pregnancy , the body 's daily demand for zinc increases to 11 - 12 mg. studies have shown a positive correlation between inadequate zinc intake during pregnancy and increased risk of premature birth , low birth weight , and foetal developmental defects .
zinc deficiency in pregnant women is also associated with a higher risk of hypertension , eclampsia , infection , and prolonged labour [ 17 - 19 ] .
copper deficiency during pregnancy can result in anaemia and neutropenia , increase susceptibility to infections , and promote metabolic disturbances in glucose and cholesterol .
it has also been suggested that the concentration of copper in the pregnant woman 's body can have an effect on the anthropometric parameters of the foetus [ 20 - 22 ] .
the recommended daily intake of copper for pregnant women is 1 mg [ 23 ] .
studies conducted so far indicate that there is a significant increase in the amount of magnesium needed by pregnant women , which can be as high as twice the pre - pregnancy requirement [ 24 ] .
depending on the extent of magnesium deficiency , and given its specific risks in pregnant women , magnesium supplementation is suggested , with a dosage in the range of 200 - 1000 mg [ 25 ] .
magnesium deficiency during pregnancy can result in hypertension , pre - eclampsia , painful muscle contraction , and migraines .
studies show the association of magnesium deficiency with an increased risk of premature birth , gestational diabetes , and foetal growth disorders [ 25 ] .
the appropriate intake of folic acid , and its concentration in pregnant women 's bodies , significantly affects the normal development of the foetus .
folic acid plays a key role in the synthesis of nucleic acids and in the homocysteine and amino acid metabolism .
folic acid supplementation at 0.4 mg a day is widely recommended for potentially childbearing women [ 8 ] .
the proper intake of folic acid at least 3 months before conception and during 2 - 3 months of pregnancy reduces the risk of neural tube defects and congenital heart defects , and promotes the normal development of the placenta [ 8 ] .
recent studies advise that all pregnant women take vitamin d3 supplementation at a dose of 600 iu per day [ 26 , 27 ] .
it is thought that the improper intake of vitamin d3 during pregnancy increases the risk of premature birth and the development of pre - eclampsia .
however , the role of vitamin d in pre - eclampsia ( pe ) is not entirely clear , and the independent effect of vitamin d supplementation in preventing pe has not been confirmed [ 28 ] .
study results indicate the association of vitamin d3 deficiency with low birth weight , abnormal bone development , increased risks of respiratory tract infection , and early childhood allergy [ 26 , 27 ] .

the study was supported by the statutory research funding from institute of human nutrition and dietetics at poznan university of life sciences ( no .
508 - 786 - 00 ) and partially funded by the polish ministry of science and higher education for polish mother 's memorial hospital research institute in lodz ( grant no. 2016 / i / 18 - gw ) .
the study involved 108 european low - risk pregnant women from greater poland with ages ranging from 18 to 42 .
it was noticed that 48 % women were in their first pregnancy .
average parity of women was 1.7 +/ - 1.1 and average gravidity 1.8 +/ - 1.2 .
the study used a validated questionnaire which we devised , and a 24 - h recall nutrition interview .
the interview results were analysed using the dietetyk software .
hairs taken from six places on the occipital part of the head were used for the biochemical analysis .
the hair was removed by cutting the strands close to the skin .
hair sections of 2 cm in length were used for the analysis , in which calcium , magnesium , iron , copper , and zinc levels were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using an aas - 3 spectrophotometer ( carl zeiss , germany ) .
the accuracy of the assay was 91 , 98 , 94 , 94 , 102 % for calcium , magnesium , zinc , iron and copper , respectively , as verified by certified reference materials ( human hair ncs dc73347a , lgc ) .
statistical analysis of the results was performed using statistica 10 software , employing the nonparametric test , the mann - whitney test , the chi2 test , the kruskal - wallis anova , and the spearman correlation coefficient .
significance was taken to be at the p < 0.05 level .
results the study population consisted of 108 pregnant women of average age 31.37 +/ - 4.87 .
during the study , the women were in week 17.7 +/ - 5.3 of pregnancy on average ( ranging from week 6 to week 32 ) .
the detailed characteristics of the women are set out in table 2 .

the average energy value of the diet of the pregnant women was below the recommended amount [ 7 ] .
likewise , the intake of carbohydrates was insufficient [ 8 ] .
the intake of protein and fat in the diet slightly exceeded the recommendations [ 8 ] .
surprisingly , it was found that the lowest fat intake was found among obese women , while the highest intake was among underweight women .
similarly , in the case of energy consumption , the lowest intake was in the case of the obese pregnant women , and the highest intake was among the underweight women .

the average amount of iron in the diet was 30 % of the recommended amount .
supplementation resulted in a significant increase in daily iron intake .
similarly , the average values of calcium and magnesium intake in the diet were not consistent with the recommendations .
supplementation increased the intake of calcium and magnesium , but the supply still remained below the recommendation .
the average zinc intake in the diet was nearly 90 % of the recommended amount .
supplementation with zinc increased the intake of this nutrient to above the recommended amount .
the average intake of copper in the diet slightly exceeded the recommendation , with supplementation further increasing its daily intake .
the average vitamin d intake was significantly lower than the recommendation .
supplementation with vitamin d led to an increase in its intake , and the recommended daily allowance was reached .
similarly , the average intake of folic acid in the diet was not in line with the recommendations ; however , dietary supplementation with folic acid resulted in a significant increase in its daily intake , even exceeding the recommended level .

there is evidence that a decrease in maternal energy intake impairs mitochondrial function and foetal development [ 29 ] .
moreover , it was observed that low maternal carbohydrate intake in the second trimester was related to insufficient total gestational weight gain and neonatal birth weight [ 30 ] .
the intake of protein and fat in the diet slightly exceeded the recommendations .
similar results were obtained in studies by gunnarsdottir et al .
[ 31 ] .
it was also observed that the intake of complex carbohydrates was below the recommended level .
only 20 % of the recommended amount of fibre was provided in the diet of the pregnant women .
different results were obtained in the study of liu et al. of pregnant chinese women , where it was reported that the diets were not balanced in terms of macronutrients [ 32 ]. that study also showed a significant excess of fat in the daily diet of the pregnant women .
our study shows a significant lack of balance in the diet of pregnant women in terms of the intake of micronutrients essential for normal pregnancy ( iron , calcium , magnesium , folic acid , and vitamin d ) .
in the studies of liu et al. and of zhang et al. , the intake of micronutrients was also observed to be significantly low , when compared to the recommendations [ 32 , 33 ] .
in addition , liu et al. found a significant iron deficiency in the diet of women in the third trimester of pregnancy , when the requirement of the foetus for iron is highest .
it should be noted that , during the first 4 - 6 months of life , the child draws on the iron reserves it accumulated during gestation , mainly in the third trimester [ 34 ] .
this study has shown that the use of dietary supplements by pregnant women significantly improves the coverage of the recommended intakes of micro - elements .
in the case of iron and zinc , supplementation increased the intake above the recommended level .
in the studies of de sa et al. and nguyen et al. , which considered iron supplementation during pregnancy , similar results were found [ 34 , 35 ] .
these authors , however , noted that despite the increase in the intake of iron by supplementation , the hoped - for reduction in the occurrence of anaemia among women was not achieved .
in this study , a positive correlation was found between the concentration of iron in the women 's hair and the intake of zinc in the form of dietary supplements .
a positive correlation was also demonstrated between the concentration of zinc in the hair and iron supplied with the diet .
knez et al .
[ 36 ] , in line with these results , pointed out that a large proportion of iron deficiency anaemia observed in the populations of many countries may be associated with a simultaneous deficiency of zinc [ 36 ] .
bjorklund et al .
[ 37 ] , on the other hand , have drawn attention to the fact that the interaction between zinc and iron depends on nutritional elements , the nutritional status of these micronutrients , and the use of supplements .
in this study , the recommended levels of calcium and magnesium intake were not achieved , despite the use of dietary supplements .
similarly , in the case of vitamin d , supplementation did not allow the recommended daily intake to be reached .
our study also shows that supplementation did not significantly increase the supply of copper and calcium in women .
numerous studies have indicated that the diet of pregnant women is unbalanced in terms of the nutrients essential for bone formation in the foetus [ 38 - 40 ] .
hyde et al .
[ 38 ] obtained similar values for the calcium and magnesium intake in a study population of pregnant women .
morriset et al .
[ 39 ] reported higher daily calcium in the diet and , like our study , showed a significant proportion of iron and vitamin d from supplements in the overall intake of these nutrients [ 39 ] .
this study has shown that the magnesium content in hair samples was significantly higher in older women and significantly lower in women above 20 weeks of gestation .
it was found despite no difference in the supply of magnesium with diet and supplements ( table 7 ) .
other authors found that magnesium level in serum during pregnancy was constant [ 40 , 41 ] .
in one of our previous studies , we observed that magnesium concentration in amniotic fluid ( af ) decreased as the pregnancy proceeded and we also found a negative correlation between magnesium in af and foetal growth parameters [ 42 ] .
we also observed lower magnesium concentration in af in older women (> 35 years old ) than in younger ones [ 41 ] , however , we did not observe a relation between the age of women and magnesium content in cord blood after delivery [ 43 ] .
this study shows that the content of zinc in hair samples was significantly lower in older women than in younger (< 35 years old ) without significant differences in zinc supply between these groups ( table 7 ) .
in other studies of ours , an association between zinc concentration in serum , af or umbilical cord blood in pregnant women and their age was not found [ 42 , 43 ] .
in opposition to that , youssof et al .
[ 44 ] observed significantly higher zinc content in cord blood plasma in older women compared to younger women after delivery .
conclusion the diet of pregnant women aged 18 - 42 is significantly lacking in balance , especially in the micronutrients crucial to the proper development of the foetus .
the use of supplements increases the daily intake of micronutrients .
however , in the case of magnesium , calcium , and vitamin d , the recommended intake levels are not achieved .
moreover , the concentration of magnesium and zinc in hair depend on age of the pregnant women and magnesium level in the maternal hair decreases during pregnancy .
the low supply of micronutrients in the diet and supplements of pregnant women can have negative health effects for both the woman and the developing foetus .

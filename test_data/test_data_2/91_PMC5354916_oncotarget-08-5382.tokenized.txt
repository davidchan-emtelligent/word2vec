numerous studies have investigated the prognostic role of ykl - 40 in breast cancer , but yielded inconsistent results .
to derive a more precise evaluation , relevant publications assessing the association between ykl - 40 expression and clinical outcome of breast cancer patients were electronically searched and identified .
a combined analysis of included studies was performed using fixed - or random - effect model to calculate the pooled hazard ratio ( hr ) or odds ratio ( or ) and 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % ci ) for the assessment of the association .
ten eligible studies involving 1250 patients were ultimately included in the meta - analysis .
overall , the pooled analysis showed that elevated ykl - 40 expression was significantly associated with a poor overall survival ( os : hr = 1.48 , 95 % ci = 1.11 - 1.97 ) and disease - free survival ( dfs : hr = 1.51 , 95 % ci = 1.10 - 2.07 ) .
the subgroup analysis by detection methods revealed an unfavorable os in breast cancer patients with elevated ykl - 40 expression evaluated by ihc ( hr = 1.39 , 95 % ci = 1.12 - 1.71 ) but not by elisa / ria .
also , the stratification analysis by ethnicity showed a significant association between increased ykl - 40 expression and shorter os of breast cancer patients in western population ( hr = 1.51 , 95 % ci = 1.03 - 2.21 ) as well as asian population ( hr = 1.40 , 95 % ci = 1.05 - 1.86 ) .
similarly , the subgroup analysis by detection methods revealed a significantly inferior dfs in breast cancer patients with increased ykl - 40 expression disregarding the use of ihc ( hr = 2.02 , 95 % ci = 1.47 - 2.79 ) or elisa / ria ( hr = 1.06 , 95 % ci = 1.02 - 1.10 ) .
additionally , increased ykl - 40 expression was found to significantly correlate with larger tumor size ( or = 2.38 , 95 % ci = 1.41 - 4.05 ). the present meta - analysis indicate that elevated ykl - 40 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer patients .
ykl - 40 may serve as a promising predictive biomarker of prognosis of breast cancer .
ykl - 40 breast cancer prognosis meta - analysis introduction breast cancer remains the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women worldwide and accounts globally for the leading cause of cancer death in females , taking up 29 % of all new cancer cases and 14 % of all cancer deaths [ 1 , 2 ] .
although the clinical outcome presenting a 5 - year survival rate of 95 % has been gradually improved with advances in treatments over decades , the disease continues to be devastating for its suffers particularly at risk , forwarding the paramount necessity and importance to discriminate prognosis and optimize treatment strategy [ 3 ] .
presently , the prognostication and treatment for breast cancer relied primarily on several traditionally confirmed prognostic factors including tumor stage ( tnm ) , tumor histological grade and lymph node status , as well as estrogen receptor ( er ) , progesterone receptor ( pr ) , and human epidermal growth factor ( egf ) receptor 2 ( her2 ) [ 4 ] .
however , the discriminant value of most potential prognostic predictors remains partially insufficient to the optimal therapeutic course for different individuals , which leaves much to be desired in identifying more reliable and clinically applicable biomarkers for prognosis .
ykl - 40 also known as human cartilage glycoprotein - 39 or chitinase - 3 - like - 1 , is a phylogenetically conserved heparin - and chitin - binding glycoprotein without chitinase activity [ 5 ] .
ykl - 40 belongs to a group of mammalian proteins with an amino acid sequence similar to the 18 - glycosyl hydrolase group of bacterial chitinases [ 6 , 7 ] , and is found to be expressed and secreted by chondrocytes , synoviocytes , hepatic stellate cells , vascular smooth muscle cells , neutrophils , while it commonly overexpressed in several types of cancer including breast , colon , kidney , lung , ovarian , prostate , uterine , osteosarcoma , glioblastoma and germ cell tumors [ 8 , 9 ] .
biologically , the exact function of ykl - 40 remains largely unknown , while it is currently evidenced that ykl - 40 may have been implicated in proliferation of chondrocytes and fibroblasts , differentiation of macrophage , migration and reorganization of vascular endothelial cells as well as inflammation and remodeling of extracellular matrix [ 10 ] .
reportedly , in addition to the roles mentioned above , inhibition of ykl - 40 was found to be able to attenuate the tube formation of microvascular endothelial cells in vitro and suppresse tumor growth , angiogenesis , and progression of brain tumors [ 11 ] .
such biophysiological activities were also observed in several other malignancies [ 12 ] , suggesting its angiogenic properties in cancer development .
clinically , ykl - 40 is found to be expressed in serum and tumor tissue in patients .
recently , aberrantly elevated expression of ykl - 40 has been observed in a number of human malignancies , such as breast , ovarian , prostate , colon , cns , bone , and skin cancers in several independent studies [ 13 ]. of note , it is reported that serum levels of ykl - 40 in patients with glioma are related with tumor grade and burden [ 14 ] , and high ykl - 40 expression is associated with poor survival of patients with lung cancer , glioblastoma , colorectal cancer , hepatocellular carcinoma , gastric cancer [ 15 - 18 ] , supporting the notion that elevated ykl - 40 expression may serve as a useful potential biomarker of prognosis for cancer patients .
numerous studies have evaluated the association between ykl - 40 expression and survival of patients with breast cancer , however , the results were still inconsistent .
some studies demonstrated that high ykl - 40 expression was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients [ 19 , 20 ] , but others failed to confirm such association [ 3 , 21 ] , which may be due to several reasons .
for example , the detection methods for ykl - 40 expression varied among studies , or the smaller sample size of an individual study was underpowered to reflect the exact role , or the ethnicity variation potentially affected the results .
accordingly , we conducted a meta - analysis with all available published studies to determine the prognostic role of ykl - 40 expression in breast cancer .
results search results and study characteristics a total of forty - one articles were initially retrieved according to the established search strategy , while ten studies involving 1250 patients were ultimately included in the meta - analysis [ 3 , 19 - 27 ] , with individual samples ranging from 30 to 399 ( table 1 ) .
the flow chart of study selection was detailed in figure 1. of which , nine studies were reported in english and one reported in chinese .
moreover , there were seven studies conducted in western populations and three studies conducted in asian populations .
the level of ykl - 40 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) in six studies , while by radio immunity assay ( ria ) in two studies and by enzyme - linked immuno sorbent assay ( elisa ) in two studies .
the evaluation of ykl - 40 expression was defined according to the percent and / or intensity of ykl - 40 staining in tumor cells by ihc as well as a determinate cut - off value of serum ykl - 40 level by ria or elisa. of the ten included articles , adjusted multivariate analyses for the association between ykl - 40 expression and the survival outcome of breast cancer patients were conducted in six publications , while unadjusted univariate analyses for this association were performed in four publications .
eventually , eight individual studies reporting the relevant hrs with 95 % cis on os and six individual studies concerning the association regarding dfs were enrolled .
the main characteristics of the studies enrolled in the meta - analysis are summarized in table 1 .
according to the newcastle - ottawa scale , the scores of quality assessment for all included studies ranged from six to eight triangles , suggesting a good quality ( supplementary table s1 ) .

considering the obvious heterogeneity across studies , the subgroup analysis regarding os based on detection methods was performed to explore the source of heterogeneity and the results revealed that elevated ykl - 40 expression had a significantly poor os effect on breast cancer patients both by ihc ( hr = 1.39 , 95 % ci = 1.12 - 1.71 ) but not by elisa / ria ( hr = 1.60 , 95 % ci = 0.84 - 3.07 ) , with a reduced heterogeneity .
moreover , the stratification analysis by ethnicity showed a significant association between increased ykl - 40 expression and shorter os of breast cancer patients in western population ( hr = 1.51 , 95 % ci = 1.03 - 2.21 ) as well as asian population ( hr = 1.40 , 95 % ci = 1.05 - 1.86 ) .
likewise , the subgroup analyses by detection methods revealed a significantly inferior dfs in breast cancer patients with increased ykl - 40 expression disregarding the use of ihc ( hr = 2.02 , 95 % ci = 1.47 - 2.79 ) or elisa / ria ( hr = 1.06 , 95 % ci = 1.02 - 1.10 ) .
meanwhile , the heterogeneity across studies was significantly reduced , a fixed - effect model were therefore applied in the subgroup analyses ( table 2 ) .
moreover , the associations between ykl - 40 expression and clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer were also investigated , however , only two included studies ( julia,et al , [ 22 ] and yamac,et al , [ 25 ]) which detected the ykl - 40 expression by elisa / ria reported the concerned association .
therefore , six studies detecting the ykl - 40 expression by ihc were enrolled in the pooled analyses .
as illustrated in figure 3 , increased ykl - 40 expression was found to significantly correlate with larger tumor size ( or = 2.38 , 95 % ci = 1.41 - 4.05 , p = 0.001 ) .
furthermore , a boardline association was shown between elevated ykl - 40 expression and advanced tumor stage ( or = 1.39 , 95 % ci = 0.96 - 2.02 , p = 0.08 ) .
regretfully , similar association was not observed regarding tumor histology , node status , age , er , pr and her2 status .

publication bias and sensitivity analysis begg 's funnel plot and egger 's test were adopted to assess potential publication bias in the current meta - analysis .
as a result , a visual asymmetry was observed in the funnel plots concerning the effect of ykl - 40 expression on os and dfs of breast cancer patients , which was also presented by egger 's test ( os : p = 0.004 ; dfs : p = 0.015 ) , suggesting the presence of potential publication bias in the meta - analysis .
however , as shown in table 3 and figure 4 , the observed publication bias disappeared with a significant reduction of heterogeneity in the analysis regarding os by omitting the study by yamac et al .
[ 25 ] and regarding dfs by the omission of the study by kim et al .
[ 20 ] , respectively , suggesting that the omitted studies may contribute significantly to the evident heterogeneity .
to examine the stability of the overall results , the sensitivity analysis by sequential omission of individual studies was performed and the significance of pooled results for os and dfs was not substantially altered , indicating the robustness of the results ( table 3 ) .

discussion previous studies investigating the influence of ykl - 40 expression on clinical outcome of patients with breast cancer have reported varying even conflict results , and there is still lack of high - quality evidence for ykl - 40 as a molecular biomarker in breast cancer patients .
currently , we focused on the prognostic utility of ykl - 40 in breast cancer with a comparatively large sample size using a powerful approach , providing more reliable evidence .
to our knowledge , the present study is the first to reevaluate the association between ykl - 40 expression and the clinical outcome of breast cancer patients by meta - analysis , demonstrating a inferior impact of elevated ykl - 40 expression on the os as well as dfs , which suggests its prognostic significance as a potentially serviceable biomarker .
it is reported that ykl - 40 is overexpressed in the adenocarcinomas of breast , colon , ovarian , uterine , prostate , kidney , and lung by the search of ykl - 40 protein sequence against the dbest database at the national center for biotechnology information using the blast program [ 19 ] .
accumulative evidence have also demonstrated an association of elevated ykl - 40 expression with poor prognosis in patients with breast , colorectal cancer , lung and other types of cancers [ 28 ] .
however , the underlying mechanism remains to be clearly elucidated .
progressively , ykl - 40 has recently been shown to exhibit effective growth factor activity involved in tumor development and inflammation processes [ 9 ] .
several experimental models supported the notion that ykl - 40 might play a stimulative role in tumor initiation through binding to rage [ 29 ] , and might be able to induce the proliferation of cancer cell via erk1 / 2 [ 30 ] .
moreover , ykl - 40 was likely to promote tumor angiogenesis by interacting with syndecan - 1 on endothelial cells as well as metastasis by stimulating production of pro - inflammatory and pro - invasive factors such as mmp - 9 , ccl2 and cxcl2 [ 31 , 32 ] .
furthermore , ykl - 40 was considered a potential modulator of inflammatory tumor microenvironment by inducing production of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [ 33 ] .
correspondingly , targeting ykl - 40 by neutralizing antibodies exerted anti - cancer effect in preclinical animal model [ 34 ] .
along with these findings , ykl - 40 was suggested to be used as a promising predictive biomarker of cancer outcome in combination with other circulating factors and might serve as an attractive candidate for tumor therapy and immunomodulation [ 35 ] .
nevertheless , the prognostic significance of ykl - 40 in breast cancer patients remains undetermined due to the discrepant reports by studies focusing on the association between ykl - 40 expression and survival of patients with breast cancer , which may be partially attributed to varying sample sizes , ethnicities and evaluation methods of ykl - 40 expression in individual studies .
in the present study , ten publications involving 1250 patients with breast cancer were combined to yield statistics with more power , indicating a significant association of ykl - 40 overexpression with poor os and dfs in breast cancer patients , which was in keeping with the findings regarding glioblastoma by a similar approach [ 36 ] .
in light of the potential impact of variations in ethnicities and evaluation methods of ykl - 40 expression on the combined results , the subgroup analyses focusing on os were performed based on ethnicity and detection methods as well .
consequently , elevated ykl - 40 expression was found to be associated with a poor os in asian as well as western populations , indicating little influence of ethnicity variation on the concerned association .
however , such association was only well - confirmed in studies using ihc to evaluate ykl - 40 expression but not in studies with elisa / ria methods with evident heterogeneity across individual studies .
considering the inconsistent trend of results and significant heterogeneity in the subgroups , a lack of uniform detect methods and evaluation criteria may be a restriction for a pooled analysis to confidently illustrate the prognostic significance of ykl - 40 for os in breast cancer .
additionally , the analyses regarding dfs stratified by detection methods revealed was also conducted and revealed an unfavorable dfs in breast cancer patients with ykl - 40 overexpression evaluated both by ihc and by elisa / ria without observed heterogeneity .
these findings suggested that ykl - 40 might be more appropriate to serve as a biomarker of dfs. of note , we did not perform subgroup analysis by ethnicity since all the studies were conducted in western populations except for one study conducted in asian population .
besides , increased ykl - 40 expression was suggested to potentially accelerate the tumor size and advanced stage , which also supported the unfavorable prognostic role of ykl - 40 overexpression in breast cancer .
however , the present study failed to confirm similar association regarding tumor histology , node status , age , er , pr and her2 status , possibly due to the limited studies included .
nevertheless , the considerable heterogeneity across studies when examining the correlation between ykl - 40 expression and prognosis and clinicopathological parameters should be noticed as well , which implied that caution should be held in the appropriate interpretation of our findings .
for every plus , there is a minus .
as a meta - analysis , the present study allows us to get a better understanding on the prognostic role of ykl - 40 expression in breast cancer patients by increasing the statistical power through combining data from numerous studies , however , several limitations in the meta - analysis should not be neglected as well .
firstly , potential publication bias is a major concern in the meta - analysis although it disappears by the omission of a study and the heterogeneity across studies was significantly reduced , the results were supposed to be interpretated with caution .
secondly , the estimated hrs with corresponding 95 % cis for survival data were obtained from univariate analysis or multivariate analysis with different adjustment variables , or calculated by kaplan - meier curves , which may limited the reliability of results .
thirdly , hormone status is a relatively important factor relevant to the treatment and prognosis of breast cancer [ 19 ] , however , few studies investigating the association were limited to a specific subtype of breast cancer .
fourthly , in the assessment of biomarkers , the use of a standard threshold is of great importance .
the differences in cut - off values for elevated ykl - 40 expression may contribute to the observed heterogeneity .
lastly , combining data from different heterogeneous studies through meta - analysis may limit the generality of the pooled findings since patients in individual studies received different types of treatments .
given the above limitations , caution should thereby be utilized when interpreting these results in the meta - analysis .
in conclusion , the present meta - analysis suggests that elevated ykl - 40 expression is markedly associated with worse survival outcome in breast cancer patients , implying that ykl - 40 may be a promising predictive biomarker of prognosis in breast cancer patients .
considering the limitations , well - designed and multicenter randomized controlled trials with uniform evaluation standard of the biomarker and study populations with similar clinical characteristics and managements are warranted to further confirm the results .
materials and methods search strategy and study selection a systematic literature search was performed electronically to identify relevant studies regarding the association of ykl - 40 expression with survival in breast cancer patients in pubmed , embase , google scholar , cochrane library database , web of science , wanfang , china national knowledge infrastructure and china biomedical literature database up to june 2016 , which was restricted to human studies published in either english or chinese .
we developed a search strategy using the following search terms : " breast cancer or breast carcinoma " and " ykl - 40 or chi3l1 or chitinase 3 - like - 1 " in all possible combinations .
concurrently , the reference lists of retrieved publications were perused manually to check for additional eligible studies .
selection criteria studies were consider eligible if they satisfied the following inclusion criteria : ( 1 ) studies assessing the association between ykl - 40 expression and clinicopathological parameters , overall survival ( os ) or disease - free survival ( dfs , including progression - free survival or recurrence - free survival ) in breast cancer patients ; ( 2 ) studies directly or indirectly providing available information on survival data by the kaplan - meier curve or available reports of clinical outcome to estimate the hazard ratio ( hr ) with the corresponding 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % ci ) ; ( 3 ) all cancer patients pathologically confirmed .
studies were excluded if they met the following criteria : ( 1 ) overlapped studies ; ( 2 ) insufficient data on outcome or the hr / or and the corresponding 95 % ci unable to be obtained directly or indirectly ; ( 3 ) review articles , meta - analysis , case reports , or letters .
in case several publications reported the concerned association in a same study population , only the most informative study was adopted .
data extraction and quality assessment the following information was evaluated and extracted independently by two investigators according to a unified standard aforehand proposed : first author , publication year , country , ethnicity , study design , detection methods of ykl - 40 expression , cut - off value of ykl - 40 expression evaluation , tumor stage , tumor size , node status , tumor histology , age , er , pr , her2 status , sample size , chemotherapy scheme , adjusting variables , the hrs and the corresponding 95 % cis for os or dfs .
for the observational studies , the estimates of hrs and the corresponding 95 % cis from both unadjusted and adjusted models were likely used .
however , if the estimates by univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were both reported in the same article , the latter was preferably selected .
the quality assessment of included studies was performed according to the newcastle ottawa scale [ 37 ] , concerning several of important factors as previously described [ 36 ] .
all the analyses were based on previously published studies , thus no ethical approval or patient consent was required .
all discrepancies were discussed and resolved until a consensus was reached .
statistical analysis individual hrs or ors and associated 95 % cis were pooled to evaluate the impact of ykl - 40 expression on the survival or clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer patients , which was performed under a fixed - or random - effect model according to the heterogeneity across the studies with review manager version 5.2 software ( the cochrane collaboration , oxford , uk ) and stata se12.0 ( stata corporation , tx , usa ) .
some hrs and their 95 % cis which were not directly reported by the original studies were estimated by available data or kaplan - meier curves using the methods reported by tierney et al [ 38 ]. and parmar et al .
[ 39 ] .
the significance of the pooled hr or or was determined by z test and p < 0.05 was considered significant. between - study heterogeneity was evaluated by the cochran 's chi2 - based q test and the i - squared test , and p > 0.10 or i2 < 50 % indicated no obvious heterogeneity [ 40 ] , then the fixed - effect model was applied to calculate the pooled hr or or [ 41 ] , otherwise , the random - effect model was utilized [ 42 ] .
also , we performed subgroup analyses by some potentially important confounding variables such as ethnicities of study population and detection methods of ykl - 40 expression .
the begg 's funnel plot was used to visually assess the potential publication bias [ 43 ] , which was further examined by egger 's linear regression test ( p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant ) [ 44 ] .
moreover , the sensitivity analysis by sequential omission of individual studies was also conducted to assess the stability of results .

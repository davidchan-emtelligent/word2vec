current high - resolution whole - heart techniques use prospective ecg - triggering and navigator gating to suppress cardiac and respiratory motion artifacts , respectively .
however , these motion suppression strategies only accept data acquired within a narrow window in the cardiac and respiratory cycles , resulting in low scanning efficiency and prolonged scan time .
recent works use respiratory motion correction to achieve 100 % respiratory gating efficiency [ 1 - 3 ] .
in this work , we extend this concept and develop a non - rigid cardiac motion correction method to extend the cardiac acceptance window beyond the quiescent period .
methods mr data was collected using a contrast - enhanced spoiled gradient echo sequence with 3d radial trajectory and retrospective cardiac and respiratory self - gating , from which 16 cardiac phases were reconstructed with affine respiratory motion correction [ 4 ] .
next , all diastolic phases are registered to mid - diastole using a symmetric diffeomorphic model [ 5 ] .
then , motion - corrected reconstruction is accomplished by inverting the encoding operator that includes sensitivity encoding and warping the target image to different cardiac phases [ 6 ] .
healthy subjects ( n = 7 ) were scanned using a clinical 3t scanner ( siemens verio ) .
three images are reconstructed from each dataset : mid - diastole quiescent window , extended window without motion correction , and extended window with motion correction .
the scan efficiency , coronary sharpness , and apparent signal - to - noise ratio ( asnr ) are compared using paired student 's t - test with a significance level of 0.05 .
results shown in fig. 1 , the proposed method offers high scanning efficiency , improves asnr and maintains coronary sharpness over the mid - diastole reconstruction. fig. 2 shows an example case : a typical mid - diastole window ( 128 ms ) shows little motion blurring but considerable undersampling artifacts ; a wide window covering the entire diastole ( 510 ms ) increases asnr but shows blurring due to cardiac motion ; and the motion blurring is effectively removed with cardiac motion correction .
figure 1 quantitative comparisons : ( a ) accepting more data with an extended window improves asnr significantly over the mid - diastole window ; ( b ) the residual cardiac motion within the wide acceptance window decreases the coronary sharpness , which is recovered by performing cardiac motion correction ; ( c ) the proposed method significantly increases the imaging efficiency .
figure 2 an example dataset showing the effect of cardiac window size and motion correction : the mid - diastole window ( a ) minimizes residual motion but introduces blurring and decreases asnr due to undersampling ; an extended window ( b ) improves asnr yet introduces motion blurring ; the effect of cardiac motion is removed by the proposed cardiac motion correction technique ( c ) .
conclusions in this work , we developed a cardiac motion correction framework for high - efficiency coronary mra , allowing the cardiac acceptance window to be significantly widened while minimizing the artifacts from cardiac motion .
the higher scan efficiency can be used to improve the image quality , as shown by our preliminary in vivo studies , or potentially reduce the scan time .
future developments will be focused on optimizing the registration parameters , and further validations on both healthy and patient subjects .

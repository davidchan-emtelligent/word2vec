introduction while surgical resection of infiltrating gliomas is rarely curative , it is increasingly clear that optimal therapy involves the removal of as much of the tumor as possible .
complete removal is more readily accomplished in lower - risk regions , but uncertainty exists in how aggressive to be with tumors located in and near more central cerebral regions ( opercular cortex , insula , basal ganglia , thalamus , and so on ) .
currently , many would agree that the standard of therapy consists of surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide .
since yasargil 's pioneering work , many have demonstrated that the insula can be removed with favorable morbidity in experienced hands [ 1 - 5 ] .
the difficulty with extrapolating these experiences to clinical practice is that gliomas seldom involve the insula alone ; instead , they more commonly invade other cerebral lobes and / or deeper structures .
we term these more extensive tumors multilobar insular - involving gliomas ( migs ) , to distinguish them from insula - limited tumors .
to date , there has been a minimal effort to define the boundaries of very aggressive removal of these tumors using modern neurosurgical techniques .
currently , many would agree that the standard of therapy for glioma treatment consists of surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide .
however , specific guidelines for treating migs are less clear .
hyperaggressive resection refers to a philosophy that , given that a greater extent of resection improves survival in gliomas [ 4 , 6 - 11 ] , and that many neurologic deficits improve or resolve over time [ 4 ] , the boundaries of resection should be pushed as much as possible .
more specifically , hyperaggressive resection is the intention of resecting all of the tumor in all involved lobes .
we have found that many patients will risk neurologic deficits to live longer , even when presented with the relative risks of aggressive resections .
consequently , we have approached migs with a 95 %+ resection goal in all cases , stopping resection only to limit surgery directly in the internal capsule , motor cortex , or presumed speech areas .
here , we provide the first detailed report regarding the outcomes of hyperaggressive surgery for migs in modern neurosurgery .
we use imaging and regression analysis to determine which factors independently impact risk and survival benefit and , from this , we construct a tool to guide the preoperative risk - benefit considerations of a hyperaggressive approach relative to a more straightforward case .
materials and methods patient population this study is a retrospective review of all insular glioma cases using a hyperaggressive approach at our center between 1995 and 2009 .
we define mig as an infiltrating glioma involving at least one - third of the volume of the insula , with significant involvement of at least one additional adjacent cerebral lobe ( frontal , temporal , or parietal ) .
two examples are provided in figure 1 , demonstrating the size and complexity of these tumors .
figure 1 examples of two migs used in the study magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of ( a ) contrast - enhancing tumor on t1 - weighted sequence and ( b ) hyperintense tumor on t2 / fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( flair ) sequence multilobar insular - involving gliomas : migs all patients underwent postoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) scans in the first 48 hours , and thereafter as needed for oncologic management .
the extent of resection ( eor ) was evaluated on the first postoperative imaging using computerized volumetric analysis .
this study was performed with the approval of and following local institutional human research guidelines .
surgical technique and perioperative management all surgeries were performed using minimally invasive keyhole techniques tailored to the exact pathoanatomic configuration of the patient 's tumor .
navigation was used in all cases .
a holistic description of planning keyhole approaches to these tumors is beyond the scope of this paper .
in short , we attempt to expose as little brain as possible and strive to adhere to recognized workhorse approaches .
we generally avoid exposing any uninvolved opercular cortices and work through the transsylvian approach , when possible , to avoid disturbing normal insular cortices .
temporal - and / or parietal - predominant tumors are approached from a targeted anterolateral approach .
frontal - predominant tumors can be resected through a supraorbital eyebrow craniotomy or a frontally based anterolateral approach .
all involved vessels are skeletonized and as much tumor as possible is removed from them .
resection proceeds until all tumor is removed or we encounter the internal capsule , presumed motor region , or presumed speech areas .
postoperatively , steroids are weaned in two to five days , as tolerated .
patients with neurologic deficits are immediately started on aggressive physical , occupational , and / or speech therapy as an inpatient or outpatient .
patients without a history of seizures are not treated with antiepileptic therapy .
data collection for purposes of risk assessment and prognosis analysis , all preoperative imaging studies were analyzed to determine the involvement of the surrounding cerebral lobes and various cerebral structures , including the uncinate fasciculus , head of caudate nucleus , putamen / globus pallidus , internal capsule , thalamus , corpus callosum , and encasement of lenticulostriate arteries .
for purposes of analysis , a frontal / temporal / parietal - predominant tumor was defined as a tumor with > 50 % of its volume in the relevant lobe .
importantly , this analysis distinguished between tumor involvement of the relevant structure and tumor involvement of the expected area of that structure , the structure having been displaced medially .
eor was calculated using volumetric assessments , in which the total planimetric tumor volume on all slices was first calculated as a percentage of the total volume , to normalize values between imaging studies stored using different imaging techniques .
eor for largely non - enhancing tumors was calculated by a comparison of pre - and postoperative t2 imaging changes .
eor for enhancing tumors was calculated by comparing pre - and postoperative volumes of enhancement .
tumor and total brain volumes for a given image were analyzed using an identical scale , brightness , and contrast scanning , and were calculated for analogous brain regions between imaging studies .
tumor and brain outlines were traced by a neurosurgeon using adobe photoshop , and overlays of the tracings were exported and quantitatively assessed using the national institute of health 's ( nih 's ) imagej program .
neurologic deficits were compared to the preoperative baseline , and the worsening of a pre - existing deficit or the presence of a new neurologic deficit were both considered neurologic complications .
neurologic deficits were considered permanent if persistent past six months postoperatively or until the last follow - up visit , whichever came first .
surgical complications included cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) leak , meningitis , wound infection , or breakdown .
a central pathology review was performed by a board - certified pathologist using world health organization ( who ) guidelines [ 12 ] .
margins surrounding the resection were not analyzed , as this is not the standard at our institution .
clinical data were collected from patient records and telephone interviews .
all clinical assessments were performed by a neurosurgeon .
statistical analysis relationships between patient demographics were assessed using univariate analyses to identify potential between - group differences that might impact the rates of tumor recurrence .
binary variables were compared using pearson 's chi2 test .
continuous variables were compared using an independent samples t - test or analysis of variance ( anova ) after demonstrating the normality of data .
we performed logistic regression to determine the risk of postoperative speech and motor deficits .
we first performed univariate analyses to determine variables associated with the increased risk of these deficits .
variables impacting the risk of these deficits with a p <= 0.2 on univariate analysis were included in stepwise binary logistic regression modeling [ 13 ] .
we used a p value of 0.2 as this number is commonly used in screening for inclusion criteria .
all odds ratios on multivariate analyses reflect the risk of having motor or speech problems at any time after surgery .
the goodness of fit of the regression model was confirmed by demonstrating a nonsignificant p - value on the hosmer - lemeshow test [ 13 - 14 ] .
univariate analyses of factors impacting postoperative survival were performed using the kaplan - meier method , with the log - rank test used to compare survival between groups .
all variables impacting survival in the univariate analyses with p <= 0.2 were included in regression modeling using stepwise cox regression to calculate proportional hazard ratios .
for each regression model , we also tested interaction terms between each of the variables .
the statistical significance of the interactions was assessed with backward conditional stepwise regression , estimating statistical significance by the likelihood - ratio test assessing the effect of removing interaction terms for all strata of the given variable [ 13 ] .
after finding that none of the interaction terms would significantly alter the log likelihood of the regression model if removed ( unadjusted p > 0.2 for all terms ) , we calculated adjusted hazard ratios without adjusting for interactions .
continuous variables are presented as a mean +/ - standard error .
standard error was used , as it is more representative of uncertainty .
statistical tests were considered significant when p < 0.05 after correcting for multiple comparisons .

two patients had csf leaks requiring surgical repair .
there were no wound infections or additional episodes of wound breakdown .

neurologic morbidity table 1 summarizes the effects of surgery on kps scores .
at the three - month postoperative follow - up , 31 / 72 patients ( 43 %) experienced improvement in kps and six patients ( 8 %) had significantly decreased kps as compared to preoperative scores .
fifty - eight of 68 patients ( 85 %) alive at the three - month follow - up had kps >= 70 .
thirty - nine patients ( 54 %) had no neurologic deficits after surgery .
some degree of temporary or permanent limb weakness or hemiplegia occurred in 27 patients ( 38 %) , which was permanent in 12 patients ( 17 %). of 23 patients with left - sided tumors , postoperative dysphasia occurred in six patients , which was permanent in three patients ( 13 % of left - sided tumors ) .
complete global aphasia occurred in one patient , which partially improved on follow - up. visual field cuts were noted in 11 patients ( 15 %) , permanent dysesthesia in three patients ( 4 %) , and other neurologic deficits ( memory problems , frontal syndromes ) in six patients ( 8 %) .
tables 3 demonstrates the results of multivariate analyses estimating the risk of motor and speech deficits .
logistic regression modeling found that only frontal predominance ( odds ratio ( or ) 4.3 , 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 1.4 - 13.8 , p = 0.013 ) and encasement of lenticulostriate arteries ( or 4.4 , 95 % ci 1.0 - 20.6 , p = 0.057 ) increased the risk of neurologic weakness after aggressive surgical resection .
temporal predominance in left - sided tumors significantly decreased the risk of dysphasia compared to nontemporal migs ( or 0.1 , 95 % ci 0.01 - 0.7 , p = 0.026 ) .

there were four deaths from malignant transformation in grade ii tumors , with 19 / 23 grade 2 patients surviving to the end of the follow - up period ( 83 %) .
patients with grade iii tumors experienced 75 % two - year survival and 48 % four - year survival .
patients with grade iv tumors experienced 55 % one - year survival and 33 % two - year survival ; eight of 33 patients ( 24 %) lived longer than three years and three of 33 patients ( 9 %) are alive at greater than five years of follow - up. figures 2b - d demonstrate kaplan - meier survival analyses for significant univariate predictors of survival in these patients .
table 4 additionally depicts the cox - regression analysis , modeling the hazard ratios ( hr ) for the survival of these variables .
not unexpectedly , histologic tumor grade and kps < 70 at three months significantly impacted survival .
additionally , preoperative tumor volume > 50 cc ( hr 4.4 , 95 % ci 2.1 - 9.4 , p = 0.0001 ) or tumors invading the putamen and / or globus pallidus ( or 2.6 , 95 % ci 1.2 - 5.7 , p = 0.023 ) independently conferred worse survival after controlling for tumor grade and kps .
there were few elderly patients in this series , and no matter how age was analyzed , it was not a significant predictor of mortality .
we did not observe an extent - of - resection threshold for a survival benefit in this series , which is possibly explained by the similar extents of resection seen across the series .

discussion decision making in glioma surgery inherently involves a value judgment balancing quality of life and length of survival .
many surgeons , knowing the generally dismal prognosis for this disease , take a conservative approach to avoid causing neurologic deficits in the face of the perceived modest benefit of surgery .
we find that many patients , when offered the option and informed of the risks , choose living longer with the increased risk of a deficit over shorter survival without one .
further , unchecked tumor progression in these eloquent regions often eventually cause the same deficits these surgeons aim to avoid , which patients may not be informed about when the decision to pursue a conservative approach is made .
the 32 % rate of preoperative motor deficits in this series provides some insight into the natural history of these tumors .
as we have demonstrated , neurologic deficits are not universal or even unacceptably common with hyperaggressive resection .
finally , many early deficits improve significantly or resolve , and some patients even improve after surgery .
in this study , we provide data on results obtained with hyperaggressive resection .
our data suggest that with this approach , neurologic deficits occur in fewer patients than may be expected , and those that do occur will frequently improve with time and aggressive rehabilitation .
this suggests that with a good technique , the fear of neurologically devastating patients with these difficult tumors is often overstated .
specific areas of concern should be based on rigorous analyses of data gathered from operating on these patients using modern techniques - - not on old teachings , anatomically - based hypotheses , or speculation .
additionally , our data suggest that many patients may experience a survival benefit from aggressive resection .
while this series is difficult to compare to others , given the selection criteria used in this study as well as the high rate of patients having received a prior operation , the fact that many of our recurrent glioblastoma patients live beyond one year after the second operation suggests that hyperaggressive surgery holds promise for these very ill patients .
in patients with low - grade glioma , most remain in long - term remission years after their surgery , further suggesting that hyperaggressive surgery is at least an intriguing strategy and may merit consideration in these patients .
this idea is supported further by the work of others .
suggesting a survival benefit with the aggressive resection of these tumors [ 8 , 11 ] .
risk - benefit assessment for migs surgical nihilism often leads to a self - fulfilling prophecy by creating outcomes with data that reinforce the nihilism [ 15 ] .
possibly due to this , there are insufficient data to determine the risk - benefit profile of attempting complete resection of migs .
to address this gap in the literature , we have developed the teo - sughrue scale for a preoperative risk - benefit assessment of patients with migs , as demonstrated in table 4 .
this scale was generated from the logistic and cox regressions for motor and speech risk and postoperative survival , respectively .
given that covariates increasing the hr of death reduce the benefit ( the risk / benefit ratio denominator ) compared to tumors localized to the insula , all adverse variables found in the regression models worsen the risk / benefit ratio of hyperaggressive surgery .
thus , the risk ratios form an additive scale , where higher numbers imply a less favorable risk - benefit of removing the entire tumor .
a review of this scale reveals findings that are intuitive to experienced tumor surgeons .
for instance , it is less fruitful to aggressively remove a glioblastoma than a grade ii astrocytoma and less fruitful to aggressively remove tumors when lenticulostriates are involved than when they are not involved. of note , while the three - month postoperative kps was an independent predictor of decreased survival , this was not predicted by preoperative kps in this series ; we frequently found that patients ultimately experienced improved kps after resection .
thus , preoperative kps was not included in this scale .
it warrants mention that some judgment regarding kps in preoperative decision making is necessary , and this represents a source of selection bias inherent in this study .
we also acknowledge that it would be beneficial to analyze these results along with the o6 - methylguanine - dna - methyltransferase ( mgmt ) promoter methylation and the isocitrate dehydrogenase ( idh ) mutant status of the tumors .
unfortunately , the majority of these data predate our realization of the significance of these genomic identifiers. is a hyperaggressive approach worth the risk ?
clearly , it is still too early to conclude that greater than 90 % resection in all mig cases is an ideal goal .
however , this study provides some modern - era insight of what a hyperaggressive strategy for these large , centrally located gliomas achieves .
certainly , the rates of neurologic deficits are somewhat higher with this strategy than one limiting aggressiveness through various adjuncts - - what is interesting is that they are not drastically higher .
speech problems are permanent in only 4 % of our patients , and motor deficits ( while initially present in 38 % of patients ) resolve in over half of cases and the rate of permanent motor deficits is only slightly higher ( 17 %) than that achieved with motor mapping in experienced hands [ 4 ] .
conclusions it is not possible to determine in a cohort of this size whether achieving greater than 90 % resection in mig cases conveys a survival benefit over a more conservative approach .
despite this , our data provide some suggestion that many patients exceed expectations of standard treatment , especially in light of the large percentage of patients undergoing repeat surgeries in this study .
at best , we can conclude that some patients do very well with hyperaggressive resection , the risks are within reasonable levels given the fatal nature of this disease , and the decision of which is more important ( length of survival vs. risk of deficit ) should ultimately be made by the patient , accurately informed of all options by the surgeon .

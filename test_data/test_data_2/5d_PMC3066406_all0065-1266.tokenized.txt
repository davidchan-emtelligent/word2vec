background for the detection of allergen - specific ige in sera , solid - phase ige - binding assays like the cap test are commonly used .
although such immunochemical methods are very sensitive , they frequently produce false positives .
degranulation of the human ige receptor ( fcepsilonri ) - transfected rat mast cell ( rbl ) lines seems to be a possible indicator for human ige , but spontaneous mediator release from these cells in the presence of human sera is not negligible .
methods the nuclear factor of activated t - cells ( nfat ) - responsive luciferase reporter gene was stably transfected into human fcepsilonri - expressing rbl - sx38 cells .
one established clone ( rs - atl8 ) was sensitized with 1 : 100 dilution of sera from patients with egg white allergy and then stimulated with purified or a crude extract of egg white allergen .
results sensitization with 15 pg / ml ige was sufficient to detect ige crosslinking - induced luciferase expression ( exile ) by anti - ige stimulation .
allergen - specific exile was elicited by as little as 1 fg / ml of egg white protein without cytotoxicity .
there was a good correlation between results with exile and oral food challenge tests on patients with egg allergy ( p = 0.001687 , fisher 's exact test ) .
the measured values of exile and the cap test also correlated well ( r = 0.9127 , spearman 's test ) .
conclusion the exile test using rs - atl8 cells is a promising in vitro ige test to evaluate the biological activity of the binding between ige and allergens .
allergy test food allergy ige luciferase mast cell food allergy occurs in 5 - 10 % of infants and preschool children and 1 - 2 % of school children in japan ( 1 ) .
ideally , oral food challenge ( ofc ) tests would be available for each patient with food allergy to determine his / her responsive allergens .
however , it is often the case that ofc tests are avoided because of the patient 's age , physical condition or clinical history ( 2 ) .
the in vitro allergen - specific ige test using patients' sera , like immunocap ( cap test ) , is widely used for the initial screening purposes for responsive allergens .
the cap test is a highly automated , convenient and very sensitive method ( sub ng / ml ) for detecting serum ige binding to allergens ( 3 ) .
however , results of specific ige binding to allergens cannot always be translated into a clear diagnosis , especially in the cases of food allergy ( 4 , 5 ) .
such clinically irrelevant results in serum ige tests can be partly explained by cross - reactive carbohydrate determinants ( ccds ) ( 5 ) .
the ccd - specific ige in patients' sera can bind to the carbohydrate residue ( s ) in the allergen .
however , if the carbohydrate determinant has only one site per allergen , such binding between the ige and allergen would not induce mast cell activation because of failure to crosslink the high - affinity ige receptor ( fcepsilonri ) on the mast cells ( 6 ) .
high - affinity ige receptor is a heterotetrameric receptor composed of an alpha subunit , a beta subunit , and a homodimer of gamma subunit ( 7 ) .
among these subunits , only the alpha subunit has a binding ability to ige , and expression of only the alpha subunit is sufficient for high - affinity binding to human ige ( 8 ) .
so far , there are no useful human mast cell lines that express abundant fcepsilonri and grow well ( 9 - 12 ) .
therefore , human fcepsilonri - overexpressing rodent mast cell lines may be a useful system for reflecting crosslinking of fcepsilonri on mast cells triggered by patients' ige and specific allergens .
we and several other groups have transfected a rat basophilic leukemia - derived mast cell line , rbl - 2h3 , with the alpha subunit gene or a complete set of alpha / beta / gamma subunit genes of the human fcepsilonri , and analyzed the usefulness of the system ( 13 - 17 ) .
among these cell lines , alpha / beta / gamma - transfected rbl cells were found to have the potential to be sensitized with diluted patients' sera and degranulate after the addition of specific allergens .
in particular , rbl - sx38 cells , generated by wiegand et al .
( 14 ) , were found to be the most effective ( 18 ) .
however , human serum was cytotoxic at high concentrations ( typically , more than 1 : 10 - 1 : 20 ) .
to avoid cytotoxicity , investigators had to sufficiently dilute serum ( 16 ) , or remove the cytotoxic factors by adsorbing the sera to wild - type rbl - 2h3 cells ( 15 , 17 , 18 ) .
these treatments could reduce the ige concentration in diluted sera , or increase experimental uncertainty through increased manipulations .
moreover , the level of degranulation was relatively low after such treatments , so artificial ' accelerators' of degranulation , such as an adenosine analogue ( 15 ) or deuterium oxide ( d2o ; 12 - 14 ) , were required to measure meaningful responses .
these compounds have been reported to potentiate the degranulation of mast cells ( 19 - 22 ) , but the addition of high concentrations of d2o increased spontaneous mediator release from these cells ( 18 , 20 , 21 ) .
crosslinking of fcepsilonri on mast cells will also induce marked gene expression of chemokines , cytokines , and other proteins ( 23 ) .
a number of transcription factors participate in such responses , and we previously demonstrated that nuclear factor of activated t - cells ( nfat ) appeared to play one of the most important roles in fcepsilonri crosslinking - induced gene expression in rbl - 2h3 cells ( 24 ) .
here , we show that the introduction of a nfat - responsive luciferase reporter gene into human fcepsilonri - expressing rbl cells is a convenient method for detecting ige crosslinking - induced mast cell activation with low - background and high sensitivity .
we designated the novel method as the ' exile ' test ; ige crosslinking - induced luciferase expression test .
materials and methods cells rbl - sx38 cells , expressing the human fcepsilonri alpha / beta / gamma - subunits , were a kind gift from dr kinet at beth israel deaconess medical center ( boston , ma ) , and were maintained as previously reported ( 14 ) .
the nfat - regulated luciferase reporter gene plasmid containing hygromycin resistance gene were purchased from biomyx ( san diego , ca , usa ) .
the plasmid was linearized by bgl i digestion , and was transferred into rbl - sx38 cells using lipofectamine 2000 ( invitrogen , rockville , md , usa ) following the manufacturer 's protocol .
stable transfectants were selected using 600 mug / ml hygromycin .
the rs - atl8 cell line , the highest luciferase responder subclone after stimulation with 10 nm phorbol myristate acetate and 10 mum ionomycin , was established by limiting dilution and was grown in minimum essential medium ( mem ) ( invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal calf serum ( fcs ; nichirei biosciences , tokyo , japan ) , penicillin / streptomycin , glutamax - i , 1.2 mg / ml geneticin , and 200 mug / ml hygromycin ( invitrogen ) .
human sera and allergens patients with suspected egg allergy referred to our hospital for investigation were enrolled in the study .
most of the patients had atopic dermatitis and asthma .
informed consent was obtained from patients , their parents , or both to collect and investigate serum samples further .
the study was approved by the institutional review board of national institute of health sciences and ethics committee of fujita health university school of medicine .
all sera were collected before food challenge to measure total and allergen - specific ige levels using immunocap .
every patient was subjected to double - blind , placebo - controlled food challenges with heated egg and was judged positive if he or she was unable to eat the equivalent of a whole boiled egg , as described previously ( 25 ) .
pooled sera from healthy donors were purchased from cosmo bio ( tokyo , japan ) .
all sera were stored at - 80degreesc until use .
purified ovalbumin ( ova ; grade v , > 98 %) was from sigma ( st. louis , mo , usa ) .
to determine the allergen detection limit , a 5 mg / ml egg white - extracted protein ( ewp ) solution ( greer labs , lenoir , nc , usa ) was used .
egg white extract ( 100 mg / ml of freeze - dried egg white powder in stock solution ) prepared for the scratch diagnostic tests was purchased from torii pharmaceutical ( tokyo , japan ) for the experiments to determine the correlations between the allergy tests .
luciferase assay rs - atl8 cells ( 5 x 104 cells / 50 mul / well ) were plated onto a clear - bottom white 96 - well plate ( viewplate perkin elmer , waltham , ma , usa ) , and were incubated for several hours at 37degreesc in a 5 % co2 incubator .
then , 5 mul of partly diluted ( 11 : 100 ) or serially diluted sera in mem containing 10 % fcs was added to the supernatant ( final dilution in the former case , 1 : 100 ) .
after overnight incubation , the cells were washed once with sterile pbs and then stimulated for 3 h at 37degreesc in a 5 % co2 incubator with allergens diluted in mem containing 10 % fcs ( 50 mul / well ) .
after stimulation , 50 mul of luciferase substrate solution containing cell lysis reagent ( one - glo , promega corp. , tokyo , japan ) was added to the cells , and chemiluminescence was measured using an envision multilabel plate reader ( perkin elmer ) .
luciferase expression levels are represented as the fold increase of light units compared with the background expression , after subtraction of a blank control ( without cells ) .
beta - hexosaminidase assay stimulation - induced beta - hexosaminidase release from rbl cells was measured as described previously with some modifications ( 13 ) .
rbl - sx38 cells were plated and sensitized with serially diluted sera as described earlier .
after overnight incubation , the cells were washed twice with normal pipes buffer ( 140 mm nacl , 5 mm kcl , 0.6 mm mgcl2 , 1.0 mm cacl2 , 5.5 mm glucose , 0.1 % bsa and 10 mm pipes , ph 7.4 ) .
ova ( 1 mug / ml ) or goat anti - human ige antibody ( bethyl laboratories , montgomery , tx , usa ) diluted in prewarmed pipes buffer was added to the cells ( 50 mul / well ) .
after incubation for 30 min at 37degreesc , supernatants were collected , and residual cells were lysed with 0.2 % triton x - 100 .
activity of beta - hexosaminidase in the medium and within the cells was determined by a fluorometric assay using 4 - methylumbelliferyl - n - acetyl - beta - d - glucosaminide as a substrate ( 0.1 mm in 100 mm citrate , ph4.5 ) .
the reaction was stopped with 0.25 m glycine buffer after 30 min incubation at 37degreesc .
the plate was read on a fluoroskan ascent plate reader ( thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) using 380 nm excitation and 440 nm emission filters .
degranulation levels are represented as follows ; where r is the degranulation level ; rsup is released enzyme activity in the supernatant ; rppt is residual enzyme activity within the cell ; blank is the buffer control .
ldh release assay cytotoxicity of human sera on rs - atl8 cells was measured by a lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) release assay using the cytotoxicity detection kitplus ( roche diagnostics k.k. , japan ) following the manufacturer 's protocol , and an el340 ( biotek instruments , winooski , vt , usa ) .
statistics the cytotoxic effect of human serum was analyzed using a 1 - way anova followed by dunnett 's test compared with negative controls without human serum .
fisher 's exact test was performed to analyze correlations between the ofc and exile or cap tests .
spearman 's rank correlation test was performed to compare the exile and cap test .
results rs - atl8 cells in the present study , we transfected an nfat - responsive luciferase reporter gene into human fcepsilonri alpha / beta / gamma - expressing rbl - sx38 cells .
we obtained 16 clones after hygromycin resistance selection , and found that clone number 8 was the highest responder to phorbol ester and ionomycin ( data not shown ) .
this clone was designated as rs - atl8 ; rbl - sx38 cell stably transfected with nfat - luciferase clone 8 .
the cells were sensitized with serially diluted healthy donor 's serum overnight , and then stimulated with 1 mug / ml goat anti - human ige antibody for 3 h. a dose - dependent increase in exile in the rs - atl8 cells was observed ( fig. 1 ) .
the original serum contained 99 ng / ml ( 41 iu / ml ) of ige as revealed by elisa .
if an expression level of two - fold background ( without serum ) was set as a cut - off , exile by anti - ige crosslinking exceeded the cut - off at 15 pg / ml of human ige ( 0.006 iu / ml ) .
in our preliminary results , sensitization and stimulation periods of 16 h ( overnight ) and 3 h , respectively , resulted in the highest luciferase expression ( data not shown ) .

comparison of exile to the beta - hexosaminidase release method as previously reported , rbl - sx38 cells are capable of effectively degranulating after sensitization using sera from patients with peanut allergy and the addition of peanut allergen ( 15 , 19 ) .
however , human serum ( 1 : 10 ) was cytotoxic to the cells , so it had to be cross - adsorbed against wild type rbl - 2h3 cells prior to the sensitization of rbl - sx38 cells ( 15 , 19 ) .
moreover , when degranulation assays were performed , it was usual for an ' accelerator ' of degranulation , like d2o or 5 ' - n - ethylcarboxamide , to be added to the medium ( 15 - 18 ) .
here , rbl - sx38 cells or rs - atl8 cells were similarly sensitized with serially diluted serum from egg allergy patient 's ( total ige , 12 700 iu / ml ; egg white specific ige , > 100 ua / ml ) , and stimulated with 1 mug / ml of ova and anti - human ige for 30 min in pipes buffer or for 3 h in 10 % fcs - containing mem , respectively ( fig. 2 ) .
rbl - sx38 cells degranulated following stimulation with a specific allergen even without a degranulation accelerator ( fig. 2a ) .
however , as serum concentration increased , spontaneous release increased , particularly in cases of more than 0.1 % serum .
the minimum and maximum spontaneous release was 14.6 % and 34.9 % of total enzyme , respectively .
meanwhile , the background luciferase expression levels were gradually decreased at > 0.3 % serum ( fig. 2b ) .
exile by ova exceeded 2.0 at 0.1 % serum , and was > 2.0 until 3 % serum .
anti - ige stimulation elicited dramatic increases in luciferase in rs - atl8 cells throughout the serum concentration range tested ( 0.004 - 3 %) , whereas beta - hexosaminidase release by anti - ige stimulation decreased nearly to the spontaneous release levels at higher serum concentrations ( fig. 2a ) .

rbl - sx38 cells ( a ) and rs - atl8 cells ( b ) were sensitized with serial dilutions of egg white allergy patient 's serum ( total ige , 12 700 iu / ml ; egg white specific ige , > 100 ua / ml ) overnight .
cells were stimulated with 1 mug / ml ovalbumin ( shaded circles ) , 1 mug / ml anti - human ige ( closed circles ) , or solvent alone ( open circles ) .
solvent does not include any degranulation accelerator such as d2o .

appropriate serum dilution for exile in rs - atl8 cells to determine the appropriate dilution factor for human sera , anti - human ige - induced luciferase expression and cell viability after sensitization of rs - atl8 cells with serially diluted healthy donor 's serum were measured .
ldh is a stable cytosolic enzyme and is released to the medium if the plasma membrane is damaged ( 26 ) .
anti - ige stimulation elicited a marked increase in the luciferase expression in rs - atl8 cells sensitized with 0.3 % and 1 % serum ; however , at higher serum concentrations (>= 3 - 30 %) , the expression decreased depending on the serum concentration ( fig. 3a ) .
the decrease was also seen in the nonstimulated controls .
such decreases in luciferase expression inversely correlated to ldh release ( fig. 3b ) , suggesting that human serum has a cytotoxic activity on the rs - atl8 cells .
in preliminary experiments , this effect could be decreased by more than 50 % by heating the sera to 56degreesc for 30 min , suggesting heat - labile factors ( maybe complement ) cause the cytotoxicity .
however , heat - inactivation was not to be performed in our experiments because ige is also heat - labile ( 27 ) .
therefore , we concluded that a 1 : 100 - dilution was the most appropriate to determine exile without cytotoxicity .

detection limit of allergen by means of exile we next tried to determine the detection limit of egg white allergen using the patient 's serum .
rs - atl8 cells were sensitized with 1 : 100 - diluted patient serum or healthy donor serum overnight , and were stimulated with ewp serially diluted in mem containing 10 % fcs for 3 h. figure 4 shows that exile by ewp peaked at 1 ng / ml and exceeded 2.0 at 1 fg / ml. the lot - to - lot reproducibility and effect of cell passage number on the exile test were determined ; 1 ng / ml ewp induced a 7.3 +/ - 1.1 ( mean +/ - sem ) fold increase in luciferase expression across six different time points ( fig. s1 ) .
it was impossible to perform the same experiment on beta - hexosaminidase release from rbl - sx38 cells , because significant spontaneous release ( 49 %) was induced by sensitization with the 1 : 100 - diluted serum ( data not shown ) .
figure 4 detection limit of egg white allergen .
rs - atl8 cells were sensitized with 1 : 100 - diluted healthy donor 's serum ( open circles ) or egg allergy patient serum ( closed circles ) overnight .
cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of egg white proteins ( ewp ) diluted in 10 % fetal calf serum - containing medium for 3 h. dashed line , two - fold level of background ( 0 g / ml ewp ) luciferase expression .
data are means +/ - sem ( n = 4 ) .
comparison of exile to ofc and cap tests nineteen sera from suspected egg - allergy patients who had been diagnosed by the ofc test ( double - blind placebo - controlled food challenge test ) with heated egg and also by the egg white - specific serum ige test ( cap test ) were subjected to the exile test for comparison .
rs - atl8 cells were sensitized with 1 : 100 - diluted patients' sera , and stimulated with 0 , 1 , 10 , 100 , and 1000 ng / ml of ewp , and exile by ewp was calculated by assuming the background expression with no allergen was 1.0 , and was judged to be positive if the maximum exile value ( max exile ) was >= 2.0 .
table 1 summarizes the results ; 12 of 19 patients were positive in the ofc test , 18 of 19 were positive in the cap test ( class 2 as a cut - off ; specific ige >= 0.70 ua / ml , a level indicated in the manufacturer 's instruction ) , and 12 of 19 were positive in the exile test .
among 12 ofc positive patients' sera , 11 and 12 were predicted to be positive by exile and cap tests , respectively , while among 7 ofc negative patients' sera , 6 and 1 were predicted to be negative by exile and cap tests , respectively .
as revealed by fisher 's exact test , the ofc and exile tests correlated well ( p = 0.001687 ) , whereas the ofc and cap tests did not ( p = 0.3684 ) .

these results seemed to be consistent with a previous study by dibbern jr. et al .
( 15 ) , looking at the degranulation of rbl - sx38 cells .
discussion in the present study , we have established a stable luciferase - reporting humanized rbl clone , rs - atl8 , derived from the previously described rbl - sx38 cells ( 14 , 15 ) .
rbl - sx38 cells released beta - hexosaminidase on activation following sensitization with serum from patients with egg allergy and stimulation with ewp , without any degranulation accelerators ( fig. 2a ) .
however , there was significant spontaneous release from serum - sensitized but nonstimulated cells , which varied from patient to patient ( data not shown ) .
in a previous report , ladics et al. described that humanized rbl cells , including rbl - sx38 cells , were not conducive to using a broad range of allergic subjects sera , because of difficulties in generating consistent , robust responses ( 15 ) .
in our system , human sera can be diluted 1 : 100 , avoiding serum cytotoxicity ( fig. 3b ) , and generate consistent responses without any artificial accelerators with very high sensitivity (>= 15 pg / ml ige ) .
in appropriate conditions , our system can detect at least 1 fg / ml of allergen ( fig. 4 ) .
it is noteworthy that the medium used here is supplemented with 10 % fcs , which includes incredible amounts of nonspecific proteins , ensuring the robustness of the system .
indeed , antigen - specific luciferase expression was observed either by purified allergen ( fig. 2b ) or by a mixture of egg white allergens ( fig. 4 ) with the same patient 's serum .
so far , nine food allergens ( egg white , egg yolk , milk , wheat , buckwheat , peanut , shrimp , crab , and sesame ) and three inhaled allergens ( mite , cedar pollen , and cat dander ) were capable of inducing exile in rs - atl8 cells sensitized with specific patients' sera .
some of the exile experiments undertaken for the screening of allergens are shown in fig. s2 .
as allergens are in the liquid phase in our system , the degree - of - freedom for testing allergens appears to be higher than in a solid phase system like cap .
as shown in table 1 , comparative analysis of the exile test to the ofc test demonstrated that the predicted results with the exile test correlated well to the final diagnosis obtained with the ofc test ( p = 0.001687 , fisher 's exact test ) , whereas the results with the cap test had no significant correlation to the ofc test ( p = 0.3684 ) .
the low correlation between the cap and ofc tests here could be partially explained by the high sensitivity of the cap test .
in cap tests , a class of 2 (>= 0.70 ua / ml ) is usually adopted for a cut - off point following the manufacturer 's instructions .
however , ando et al .
( 25 ) recently reported that the optimal cut - off point of egg white - specific ige was 2.82 and 7.38 ua / ml , for the ofc tests with raw and heated egg white , respectively .
in addition , komata et al .
( 28 ) also reported that the 95 % probability was achieved at 30.0 ua / ml for patients with egg white allergy who were aged >= 2 .
considering these aspects , the class of 2 might be too strict to exclude false positives , at least for the patients in the present study .
if a cap class of 3 (>= 3.50 ua / ml ) was set as a cut - off in table 1 , the correlation of the results with the cap test and ofc test would increase to a significant level ( p = 0.009546 ) .
therefore , the cap test is so sensitive that it seems to be suitable for the first screening of allergen - specific ige in the sera .
both of the scores ( fig. 5a ) and values ( fig. 5b ) from the exile and cap tests correlated well .
these results strongly suggest that an increase in the luciferase expression observed in rs - atl8 cells reflects crosslinking of the antigen - specific ige bound to fcepsilonri on the mast cells .
therefore , these three systems seemed to correlate well , but there were several specific differences in the results between them ( table 1 ) .
compared with the ofc results , the exile test predicted one false - negative (# 94 ) and one false - positive (# 73 ) .
reasons for this are unclear , but the false - negative result might be because of the higher detection limit of the exile system , as serum # 94 contained no more than 2.99 ua / ml specific ige .
another possibility is that other substances , like chemokines and cytokines , can induce histamine release from human basophils ( 29 , 30 ) .
as rs - atl8 cells only have human fcepsilonri , the cells would not be activated through ige - independent mechanisms like these .
this might also be an explanation for the false - positive case .
if neutralizing igg antibodies ( 31 ) against ewp were present in vivo , it would not be strange that oral challenge did not show marked symptoms in the patient , whereas antibodies other than ige in the patient 's serum will be washed away from the medium before the addition of specific antigen to rs - atl8 cells in the present study .
a qualitative change in epitopes by heat and / or digestion could be another possibility .
one noteworthy example is patient # 67 , whose serum contained 4.46 ua / ml ( class 3 ) of egg white - specific ige , but can eat eggs with no allergic symptoms. with this serum , exile levels were gradually increased to 1.6 depending on ewp concentration , but did not exceed the 2.0 cut - off level ( table 1 ) .
considering the substantially high level of total ige in his serum ( 22 600 iu / ml ) , most of the specific ige seems to be biologically meaningless cross - reactive antibodies , lacking the ability to activate mast cells and basophils ( 5 , 32 ) .
it is important to distinguish such patients from the cap - positive patient group because food avoidance is unnecessary and would lower the quality of life for such patients ( 33 ) .
the exile test could be suitable for this purpose , screening allergen - specific ige in sera following immunochemical in vitro tests like cap .
this novel in vitro technique might be applicable to : ( i ) second screening of allergen - specific ige in the serum following cap tests , ( ii ) cross - reactivity tests between known allergens and potential allergens ( safety assessment of gene - modified crops ) , ( iii ) standardization of allergen extracts for clinical usage , ( iv ) screening of novel allergens and / or epitopes , ( v ) detection of small amounts of allergens in foods , ( vi ) epidemiological study of allergens using a serum bank , and ( vii ) high - throughput screening for the seed compounds of anti - allergic drugs .
this study was supported by grants - in - aid from the food safety commission , japan ( no.0708 ) and by grants - in - aid for young scientists ( b ) from the japan society of the promotion of science ( 19790084 ) .
we are grateful to dr noriko katori , for her helpful advices on the statistics .

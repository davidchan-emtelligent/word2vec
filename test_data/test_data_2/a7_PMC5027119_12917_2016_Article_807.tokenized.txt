background previous studies confirmed that classical scrapie can be transmitted via milk in sheep .
the current study aimed to investigate whether scrapie can also be transmitted via goat milk using in vivo ( new - born lambs fed milk from scrapie - affected goats due to the unavailability of goat kids from guaranteed scrapie - free herds ) and in vitro methods ( serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification [ spmca ] on milk samples ) .
results in an initial pilot study , new - born lambs of two different prion protein gene ( prnp ) genotypes ( six vrq / vrq and five arq / arq ) were orally challenged with 5 g brain homogenate from two scrapie - affected goats to determine susceptibility of sheep to goat scrapie .
all sheep challenged with goat scrapie brain became infected based on the immunohistochemical detection of disease - associated prp ( prpsc ) in lymphoid tissue , with an arq / arq sheep being the first to succumb .
subsequent feeding of milk to eight pairs of new - born arq / arq lambs , with each pair receiving milk from a different scrapie - affected goat , resulted in scrapie in the six pairs that received the largest volume of milk ( 38 - 87 litres per lamb ) , whereas two pairs fed 8 - 9 litres per lamb , and an environmental control group raised on sheep milk from healthy ewes , did not show evidence of infection when culled at up to 1882 days of age .
infection in those 12 milk recipients occurred regardless of the clinical status , prpsc distribution , caprine arthritis - encephalitis virus infection status and prnp polymorphisms at codon 142 ( ii or im ) of the donor goats , but survival time was influenced by prnp polymorphisms at codon 141 .
serial pmca applied to a total of 32 milk samples ( four each from the eight donor goats collected throughout lactation ) detected prpsc in one sample each from two goats .
conclusions the scrapie agent was present in the milk from infected goats and was able to transmit to susceptible species even at early preclinical stage of infection , when prpsc was undetectable in the brain of the donor goats .
serial pmca as a prpsc detection method to assess the risk of scrapie transmission via milk in goats proved inefficient compared to the bioassay .

although the ability of the scrapie agent to transmit vertically and horizontally in small ruminants has been known for years , the sources or vehicles of infection were poorly understood and only recently has progress been made to establish which secretions and excretions are infectious .
disease transmission has been demonstrated in lambs fed milk from scrapie - affected ewes [ 1 - 3 ] .
studies on the infectivity of milk from small ruminants , which is used for human consumption , have become more relevant since the demonstration of the zoonotic potential of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) and the identification of naturally occurring bse in goats [ 4 , 5 ] .
the only previous infectivity study , in which two 3 month - old goats were intracerebrally inoculated with 1 ml of milk from an experimentally infected goat , failed to demonstrate transmission up to 29 months post inoculation [ 6 ] .
at the time of that experiment , the influence of the prion protein genotype ( prnp ) on scrapie susceptibility was unknown .
it has now been established that susceptibility to scrapie in sheep is predominantly influenced by prnp polymorphisms at codons 136 ( alanine [ a136 ] or valine [ v136 ]) , 154 ( arginine [ r154 ] or histidine [ h154 ]) and 171 ( glutamine [ q171 ] or r171 ) , with arq / arr and arr / arr being highly resistant against classical scrapie and vrq / vrq , arq / arq and vrq / arq being highly susceptible [ 7 ] .
more recent research has suggested that prnp genetics in goats may also play a role on susceptibility to scrapie , with polymorphisms at codons 127 ( serine [ s127 ] instead of glycine [ g127 ]) , 142 ( methionine [ m142 ] instead of isoleucine [ i142 ]) , 146 ( s146 and aspartic acid [ d146 ] instead of asparagine [ n146 ]) , 154 ( h154 instead of r154 ) , 211 ( q211 instead of r211 ) and 222 ( lysine [ k222 ] instead of q222 ) giving some protective effect against classical scrapie in goats [ 8 ] .
following our infectivity studies in sheep milk , the study reported here aimed to investigate whether scrapie from goats can be transmitted to sheep via milk by the oral route .
lambs were used as milk recipients because they could be sourced from a closed flock of known classical scrapie - free status .
however , previous transmission studies had only confirmed the susceptibility of goats to sheep scrapie by natural or oral infection [ 9 , 10 ] but not vice - versa .
therefore , a pilot study was initiated to determine whether sheep were susceptible to goat scrapie following oral challenge with brain homogenate , which would mimic the route for a further milk transmission experiment , and to assess which genotype , vrq / vrq or arq / arq , was more susceptible .
this report summarises the final results of this pilot and the subsequent milk transmission study , preliminary results of which were reported previously [ 11 ] .
the findings are compared with those of serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification ( spmca ) applied to goat milk , since this method had been able to detect prpsc in milk samples from scrapie - affected sheep , which also transmitted scrapie to lambs [ 3 ] .
methods an overview of the study is given in the additional file 1 " schematic summary of the study " .
the goats referred to in the text were from a herd with naturally occurring scrapie that was culled according to regulation no 999 / 2001 of the european parliament and of the council laying down rules for the prevention , control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , which provided the opportunity to study some of the animals and collect samples prior to cull .
pilot study to determine susceptibility of sheep to caprine scrapie brain homogenates were prepared from two anglo - nubian goats naturally infected with scrapie [ 12 ] according to established methods [ 13 ] : g1460 with i142i ( subsequently named " bii ") and g1451 with i142m ( subsequently named " bim ") prnp genotypes .
more details on these goats , including clinical signs , are provided elsewhere [ 14 ] .
six cheviot ewes with twin pregnancy were acquired from a classical scrapie - free flock [ 15 ] , which produced eleven cheviot lambs with prnp genotypes vrq / vrq ( n = 6 ) and arq / arq ( n = 5 ) ; the sixth arq / arq lamb was culled shortly after birth due to injury .
vrq lambs were selected because of the high attack rate in sheep of this genotype fed milk from scrapie - affected sheep [ 3 ] .
as it was also known for sheep that cross - prnp genotype transmissions of scrapie resulted in considerably increased survival times [ 16 ] , arq sheep were selected because it would match the prnp genotype at these positions in goats , which lack polymorphisms at codons 136 and 171 [ 7 ] .
prnp genotyping was subsequently extended to other polymorphisms , particularly at codon 141 ( leucine [ l141 ] or phenylalanine [ f141 ]) , which has shown to influence disease in experimentally infected arq / arq sheep [ 16 ] .
the lambs were orally challenged within 24 h after birth with 5 g ( as 10 % w / v solution in physiological saline ) of either bii or bim brain homogenate .
lambs were raised by their dams until weaning at approximately 10 weeks of age and housed in three pens , two of which contained lambs challenged with either bii or bim and one housed a mixture of lambs challenged with bii or with bim ( table 1 ) .
sheep were fed straw and concentrates after weaning , and lambs from the different pens were mixed from 35 months of age when the number of animals started to decline .

further rectal biopsies at 20 - 21 months and 6 - monthly thereafter were taken only from sheep with previous negative results .
sheep were monitored twice daily by farm staff and were examined for neurological signs first at 20 months of age , then at 31 months and then usually monthly or more frequently depending on clinical status , using a short examination protocol for detection of scrapie [ 18 ] .
a full neurological examination [ 13 ] was carried out prior to cull .
assessments were made blind without knowledge of the genotype or inoculum .
the clinical end - point was reached when animals displayed progressive abnormalities in sensation ( positive scratch test with or without alopecia , absent menace response ) and movement ( ataxia , limb weakness , tremor ) .
the brain and a range of lymphoid tissues were taken from sheep that died or were culled at clinical end - point and scrapie was confirmed by ihc examination of formalin - fixed and wax - embedded samples of the obex and lymphoid tissues using rat monoclonal antibody r145 as described previously [ 19 ] .
milk transmission study goats from the naturally infected herd [ 12 ] were transported to the apha for milking prior to culling and necropsy .
milk was collected from eight animals that were subsequently confirmed scrapie - positive on ihc examinations for prpsc .
post - mortem test examination of the goats included ihc examination of brain and lymphoid tissues ( palatine tonsil , spleen , nictitating membrane , distal ileum , ramalt , medial retropharyngeal , prescapular , prefemoral , distal jejunal and mammary lymph nodes as well as mammary glands with antibody r145 [ 20 ]. from day 6 ( day 4 in goat g1415 ) of milk collection , a milk sample was tested weekly for somatic cell count by fossomatic counter at the national milk records plc , chippenham , uk. the milk donors included the two goats that provided the brain for the pilot study .
at the time of milk collection , the goats were of different scrapie status , preclinical or clinical , and at various stages of lactation ; the exact lactation day was not known except for two goats , which also provided colostrum .
basic information about the donor goats is given in table 2 ( see [ 14 ] for more information on the clinical presentation ) .
the colostrum and milk were stored at - 80 degreesc for approximately 2 years and defrosted prior to being fed to lambs or subjected to in vitro prpsc detection ( see below ) .

caev status was determined serologically - = clinically unremarkable or negative serology result ; +/ - = inconclusive signs with regards to scrapie ; + = clinically affected or positive serology result sixteen cheviot lambs , born from ewes from the classical scrapie - free flock [ 15 ] that carried twin or single lambs , were fed colostrum from their dams for the first day and then switched to goat milk feeding .
goat milk was fed in the same order it was collected , i.e. milk collected at day 1 was fed first .
these milk recipients were pairs of arq / arq lambs and the milk from each doe was split so that the lambs in each pair were fed approximately equal volumes of milk .
once all the goat milk was consumed , lambs were fed milk replacer ( lamlac , volac international ltd. , royston , uk ) , followed by a diet of straw and concentrates from a weaning age of approximately 10 weeks .
five new - born lambs from the same classical scrapie - free flock , which were housed in the same building and shared the same air space as the others but kept in a separate pen , were maintained as environmental controls .
these were kept with their dams until weaning and then fed the same diet as the goat milk - fed lambs .
each pen had a separate entrance and equipment ; when equipment had to be shared ( e.g. a weighing crate ) it was decontaminated through exposure to 2 % hypochlorite solution ( haychlor industrial bleach , brenntag , leeds , uk , diluted to appropriate concentration ) for 1 h. a blood sample was taken from all animals at 4 - 5 , 6 - 7 months of age and prior to cull to test for antibodies against small ruminant lentivirus infection by agar gel immunodiffusion test ( agidt ) using the maeditect test kit ( apha weybridge ) [ 21 ] as in previous milk transmission studies .
scrapie infection was monitored as described above for the pilot study : ramalt sampling first at 9 - 10 months of age , then at 19 months and 6 - monthly thereafter until first detection of prpsc .
the different pairs of milk recipients were kept in separate pens until scrapie infection was confirmed by ramalt biopsy in at least one sheep within those pairs , at which time they were mixed .
similar to the pilot study , the first clinical neurological assessments were conducted at approximately 24 months of age , then at 33 months and then monthly and at culling at clinical end - point , or due to intercurrent diseases .
assessments were made blind with regards to donor goat details , with the obvious exception of the environmental control group and later in the experiments also of the two pairs that had been fed the lowest volume , simply because these could not be mixed with the others .
post - mortem confirmation of scrapie was performed in the same way as in the pilot study .
sheep in the pilot and milk transmission studies were kept up to clinical end - point to determine the clinical , pathological and molecular phenotype of caprine scrapie transmitted to sheep , which will be reported separately .
prpsc detection by spmca a brain homogenate from sheep from the same scrapie - free flock that provided the experimental animals [ 15 ] was selected as cellular prion protein ( prpc ) substrate to mimic the in vivo transmission experiments where lambs were used as recipients .
firstly , amplification of prpsc from the caudal medulla of the two scrapie - infected goats used in the pilot experiment ( bii and bim ) was tested using pmca substrates prepared from sheep with prnp genotypes vrq / vrq , arq / vrq and arq / arq to determine the most suitable genotype .
the methods for sample preparation , amplification and visualisation were described previously [ 22 , 23 ] .
briefly , the seed and substrate brains were prepared by washing and liquidising in amplification buffer , and subsequently homogenised to provide a 10 % ( w / v ) homogenate .
frozen whole milk samples ( 10 ml ) were defrosted , clarified by centrifugation and the supernatants below the fat layer diluted 1:10 in the most suitable ovine pmca substrate established previously ( see above ) , supplemented with polyadenylic acid ( p9403 sigma - aldrich ) to increase the efficiency of amplification .
diluted samples were subjected to four rounds of spmca , with each round comprising 48 consecutive cycles of sonication and incubation .
pmca products were stored frozen at - 20 degreesc until analysed by enzyme immunoassay ( idexx herdchek bse - scrapie antigen test kit , idexx laboratories , westbrook , usa ) using a modified protocol as described previously [ 23 ] .
in each experiment negative control samples , pmca substrate only and pmca substrate spiked with a previously tested and known negative goat milk extract , were included to monitor both de novo synthesis and putative contamination .
following spmca all samples with an absorbance of 2 or more were considered positive .
milk samples were tested twice or three times in cases of a high negative or inconclusive result in one sample that warranted an additional assay to verify the result .
the milk from 14 goats was analysed , including the eight milk donors and another six that originated from the same herd but had tested negative for scrapie by laboratory tests ( see table 2 and [ 14 ] for more details about the animals ). from each goat four samples were tested , which had been collected at equal intervals throughout the lactation .
samples were tested blind .
results pilot study to determine susceptibility of sheep to caprine scrapie survival times , and the time of first detection of prpsc in ramalt biopsies are listed in table 1 .
sheep a1473 was the one with the earliest detectable prpsc in palatine tonsil ( 266 days of age ) , which is why the arq / arq genotype was selected for milk recipients in the subsequent milk transmission study ( see below ) .
all sheep orally dosed with goat brain developed clinical signs of scrapie and this was confirmed by ihc examination of the brain .
the only exception was sheep a1474 that died of an undiagnosed condition at 269 days of age and showed prpsc accumulation in the mesenteric lymph node .
the age at first detection of prpsc in ramalt was 744 +/ - 243 days ( mean +/ - standard deviation ) , that is at 56 +/ - 11 % of the survival time , which was 1321 +/ - 292 days of age .
the outlier was sheep v1451 , where prpsc in ramalt was first detected at 83 % of the survival time , almost twice as long as the other sheep of the same genotype challenged with the same inoculum .
sheep a1471 did not show prpsc in ramalt biopsies until 1201 days old but its survival time was also considerably longer than all other sheep .
the shortest survival time was that of the single alrq / alrq sheep .
afrq / afrq sheep had longer survival times than vrq / vrq sheep ( 167 days longer for bim challenge and 902 days longer for bii challenge when mean survival times were compared ) .
no comparison by statistical methods was carried out due to the small number of sheep per group .
milk transmission study none of the sheep tested positive for antibodies against small ruminant lentiviruses at any of the two selected time points .
survival times and time of first detection of prpsc in ramalt ( fig. 1a ) of the 16 sheep fed different volumes of milk from scrapie - infected goats are displayed in table 3 .
none of the controls kept in the same building developed signs of scrapie and prpsc was not detected in either lymphoid tissues or the brain ( fig. 1b and d ) of these animals. fig. 1 prpsc accumulation in brain and lymphoid tissue of goat scrapie milk recipient 1302 and comparison with control 1325 .

lambs were fed goat milk between 16 and 32 h ( mean 24 h ) after being born all six sheep pairs fed relatively large volumes of goat milk ( 38 - 87 litres ) were culled with clinical signs of scrapie and this was confirmed by ihc examination of the obex ( fig. 1c ) , while none of the two sheep pairs fed a small volume ( 8 - 9 litres ) developed signs of scrapie or showed prpsc accumulation in any of the tissues examined .
one in each scrapie - negative pair was lost due to intercurrent diseases ( one found dead without any obvious cause , the other sheep had tetanus - like signs ) at a time when other milk - fed sheep had already been culled with signs of scrapie .
these four scrapie - negative lambs had been fed milk from goats with prpsc restricted to one or two lymphoid tissues and without prpsc in brain , while all 12 scrapie - infected recipients were fed milk from goats that had prpsc in seven or more lymphoid tissues examined and four of them also had prpsc in brain ( see table 2 ) .
only two of the eight goats had detectable prpsc in the mammary gland , of which both transmitted scrapie to lambs .
for the three scrapie - infected milk recipient pairs that included one l141l and one l141f sheep , the survival times were 40 ( g1383 donor ) , 168 ( bim donor ) and 430 ( g1552 donor ) days longer in l141f than l141l sheep ( see table 3 ) .
prpsc detection by spmca amplification was not consistently achieved for goat brain samples using ovine pmca substrates : bii amplified in vrq / vrq and arq / arq sheep substrate but not in arq / vrq substrate , bim only amplified in the vrq / vrq substrate .
therefore , ovine substrate of this last genotype was used to analyse the milk samples. of the six goats that transmitted scrapie to lambs via milk , two ( bii and bim ) amplified prpsc in one of four tested samples each ( and only in one third of the aliquots tested ) , whereas prpsc was not amplified in any of the others .
milk samples from the goats that were scrapie - negative by ihc examination of brain and lymphoid tissues were also negative in the pmca assay .
discussion recent studies on scrapie transmission in small ruminants , particularly sheep , have widened our knowledge about sources of infectivity that could contribute to transmission from an infected dam to its offspring .
a significantly increased incidence of scrapie has been found in the offspring of scrapie affected ewes , which is either the result of " in utero " or post - natal ewe to lamb transmission [ 24 , 25 ] .
placenta is believed to be the main source of post - natal scrapie infection [ 26 - 28 ] , contributing to infection most likely by horizontal transmission [ 29 ] , while it has now been established through in vivo experiments that colostrum and milk are very effective sources for vertical scrapie transmission from dam to lamb [ 1 - 3 , 30 ] .
the study reported here addressed the question of whether milk from scrapie - affected goats is similarly infectious , and confirmed that milk from goats also harbours the scrapie agent and can transmit it to new - born lambs .
the use of sheep lambs in this experiment was justified to guarantee that the recipients were scrapie - free , something that could have not been achieved with goat kids .
at the time the study was designed , no published information on the transmissibility of goat scrapie to sheep was available , and a pilot study was initiated to test the susceptibility of sheep to caprine scrapie .
oral challenge of new - born sheep with brain homogenate from two scrapie - affected goats produced a 100 % attack rate in both vrq / vrq and arq / arq sheep , while goat to sheep transmission with milk from infected goats was achieved in 75 % of the lambs dosed .
a possible explanation for this difference is a potentially lower infectious titre in milk compared to brain combined with the effect of the species barrier .
however , the lack of transmission observed in four sheep recipients might also have been due to the low volume of milk fed to them ( 8 - 9 litres ) or to the donor goats being in an early stage of the incubation period , as shown by the restricted tissue distribution of prpsc , or to both , but it does not exclude the possibility that such milk could have transmitted to goat kids .
this hypothesis is supported by the observation that oral challenge with cotyledon homogenate from a scrapie - affected goat to new - born small ruminants produced scrapie in four of four goats but only in two of four vrq / vrq sheep [ 31 ] .
therefore , considering all these arguments and the fact that transmission of scrapie via milk was achieved even from goats in the preclinical phase , without detectable prpsc in the brain and without prpsc in the mammary gland , goat milk appears to be an efficient source for scrapie transmission .
co - infection of sheep with scrapie and maedi - visna virus ( mvv ) has been associated with increased shedding of prions in milk [ 2 , 30 , 32 ] .
in our experiment transmission of scrapie occurred independently of infection with caprine arthritis - encephalitis virus ( caev , the caprine counterpart of mvv ) in the donor goats and of the indurative mastitis associated with it [ 33 ] and none of the milk recipient lambs had serological evidence of small ruminant lentivirus infection .
none of the goats exhibited clinical mastitis and the median somatic cell count in milk was not lower in goats that did not transmit scrapie compared to those that transmitted .
it is known that there are multiple non - pathological factors , such as stage and number of lactation , and stress or change in diet , which affect somatic cell count and cause considerable variation even in milk from healthy udders of small ruminants [ 34 ] .
this is therefore unreliable as specific indicator for tse risk or as an indicator of udder health in goats [ 35 ] .
although the m142 allele of the caprine prnp was associated with increased resistance to classical scrapie in the herd that provided the milk donors [ 12 ] , milk from i142m goats was infectious .
these goats showed a wide dissemination of prpsc in lymphoid tissues , which may correlate with increased presence of the agent in the blood and increased probability of shedding via milk .
indeed , this might be the case since the two goats that did not transmit scrapie had minimal involvement of the lymphoreticular system ( lrs ) .
any interpretation with regards to infectious titre of the scrapie agent by comparing survival times , which are used in mice as a crude method to estimate the infectious titre [ 36 ] , is impossible due to the different milk volumes fed to pairs of lambs and their different genotypes .
for example , feeding milk and colostrum from a clinically affected goat with prpsc in the brain ( g1460 , i142i ) and milk from a goat that only had detectable prpsc in lymphoid tissue ( g1143 , also i142i ) produced similar survival times in l141f milk recipients , which may suggest that the infectious titre was similar , but the latter goat produced almost twice as much milk so the volumes ingested by the lambs were different .
the poor correlation of the spmca results ( prpsc detected in only two single samples from two goats ) with the actual transmission results ( successful transmission from six goats ) was unexpected , given that prpsc was previously detected by spmca in similar volumes of milk samples collected from scrapie - affected sheep , which proved to transmit scrapie to lambs [ 3 ] .
although one recent study suggested that the levels of infectivity correlated well with detection of prpsc in tissues by laboratory tests , including pmca , which was the most sensitive test [ 37 ] , an earlier study indicated that the association between infectivity and laboratory test results was poor for the tse sources and host prnp genotypes used in the study [ 38 ] .
the spmca results obtained from the two tested goat brains demonstrated that amplification was indeed affected by prnp polymorphisms of the substrate source and / or the goat brain donor and the choice of an ovine substrate may have contributed to the low amplification efficiency of goat scrapie , even though it transmitted to sheep in vivo .
the quantity of prpsc in individual milk samples is likely to be so small that it is at the limit of detection with spmca , particularly in goats at an earlier stage of disease .
the latter hypothesis is supported by the observation that both goats with the spmca - positive result in a single milk sample had a higher magnitude of prpsc accumulation in the brain than the others [ 20 ] and one displayed clear neurological signs of scrapie .
we did not carry out a dilution study on brain to evaluate the limit of detection and also did not trial brain homogenate from ovinized transgenic mice ( tg338 ) as substrate , which was used by other researchers and published after we had carried out our spmca experiments [ 39 ] .
tested milk samples were collected at different time points so it is unlikely that the failure to detect prpsc is due to inconsistent shedding of prpsc via milk .
amplification of prpsc by spmca may possibly also be affected by the peculiar nature of goat milk , which contains many cytoplasmic particles as a result of apocrine milk secretion [ 34 ] or any other , unknown inhibitors in goat milk .
the current study provided further evidence for the important effect of polymorphisms at codon 141 of the ovine prnp on survival time .
it has been previously shown that homologous oral scrapie transmission of scrapie in arq / arq sheep results in survival times that are approximately twice as long in sheep with the lf polymorphism compared to ll sheep [ 16 ] .
a similar effect was seen in the current study where ll sheep had consistently shorter survival times than lf sheep fed milk from the same animal ( 40 , 168 and 430 days respectively ) although the difference in survival time was not as large as in the previously published study , which may be due to the species - barrier ( sheep scrapie to sheep transmission [ 16 ] versus goat scrapie to sheep transmission here ) .
however , an ff sheep survived for almost twice as long as an ll sheep although this was only established for the bii brain recipients which had this genotype combination .
although arq / arq sheep homozygous f141 are naturally susceptible to classical scrapie [ 40 ] , this polymorphism is usually associated with higher susceptibility to atypical scrapie compared to l141 [ 41 ] .
conclusions this study confirmed that the classical scrapie agent is present in milk from scrapie - affected goats even at the pre - clinical stage when there is an absence of detectable prpsc in brain , and is able to transmit scrapie to susceptible species , although transmission was not achieved in milk volumes of less than 10 litres from goats with minimal lymphoid tissue involvement .
serial pmca as a prpsc detection method to assess the potential risk of scrapie transmission via milk in goats was inferior to the in vivo transmission study .

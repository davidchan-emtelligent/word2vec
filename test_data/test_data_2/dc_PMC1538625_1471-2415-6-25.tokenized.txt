ophthalmologists and researchers in ophthalmology understand what a rapidly evolving field ophthalmology is , and that to conduct good research it is essential to use the latest and best methods .
in outcomes research , one modern initiative has been to conduct holistic measurement of outcomes inclusive of the patient 's point of view ; patient - centred outcome .
this , of course , means including a questionnaire .
however , the irony of trying to improve outcomes research by being inclusive of many measures is that the researcher may not be expert in all measures used .
certainly , few people conducting outcomes research in ophthalmology would claim to be questionnaire experts .
most tend to be experts in their ophthalmic subspecialty and probably simply choose a popular questionnaire that appears to fit their needs and think little more about it. perhaps , unlike our own field , we assume that the field of questionnaire research is relatively stable .
this is far from the case .
the measurement of patient - centred outcomes with questionnaires is a rapidly evolving field .
indeed , over the last few years a paradigm shift has occurred in patient - centred measurement .
text measurement of patient - centred health outcomes began in the 1950s , and more than 70 measures of functional status , 2 dozen generic quality of life instruments , and hundreds of disease - specific measures now exist [ 1 - 4 ] .
much of this research has relied on the theory and methods of classical test theory ( ctt ) .
underpinning ctt is simple scoring of responses to questionnaires ; for multi - category response scales this is usually summary scoring where response categories are assigned ordinal numbers which are summed across questions to arrive at a total score .
this score is assumed to represent measurement of the underlying trait ( e.g. quality of life ) .
an alternative approach is item response theory ( irt ) whereby items and persons can be scaled according to a series of responses to items .
implicit is that not only can people have different ability , but that items can have different difficulty and both can be estimated .
the foundations of irt were laid down in the 1920s , and great advances were made after 1950 , especially with the contribution of georg rasch [ 5,6 ] .
rasch analysis is a special case of irt similar to a one - parameter model , but importantly , rasch models meet the conditions of non - interactive conjoint structures so , unlike irt models , they are valid measurement models [ 7 ] .
( see massof 's excellent background paper for further discussion of these methods as applied to ophthalmology [ 8 ]) .
it has only been in the last 25 years that rasch analysis has been applied in studies of health status .
early applications included mental health and physical rehabilitation in the 1980s [ 9,10 ] , including low vision rehabilitation [ 11,12 ]. through the 1990s , and into the 21st century , rasch analysis has penetrated many health outcome fields and is becoming prevalent in ophthalmology .
however , many popular ophthalmic questionnaires use traditional summary scoring [ 13 ] .
summary scoring assumes the value of each item represents equal difficulty and therefore scores them equally .
in addition , the ordinal integer response scale used for each item assumes uniform changes between response categories .
for example , in a summary scored vision disability instrument such as the ' activities of daily vision scale ( advs )'[ 14 ] , a response of " a little difficulty " ( score of 4 ) is used to represent twice the level of ability as " extreme difficulty " ( score of 2 ) which is similarly two times as good as " unable to perform the activity due to vision " ( score of 1 ) for all items .
this appears illogical and rasch analysis has been used to confirm that specific response category calibrations are required to provide a linear scale [ 15 ] .
similarly , summary scoring assumes that all items are of equal difficulty .
for example , with the advs instrument an answer of " a little difficulty " to the question regarding visual difficulties ' driving at night ' scores the same as " a little difficulty " with ' driving during the day ' .
again , this is illogical and rasch analysis has been used to confirm that subjects report that ' driving at night ' is a more difficult task than ' driving during the day ' ; rasch analysis can provide the appropriate weighting for each item to enable linear measurement [ 15 ]. by resolving inequities in a scale arising from differential item difficulty , rasch analysis provides a self - evident benefit in terms of accuracy of scoring .
however , this process also removes noise from the measurement which in turn improves sensitivity to change and correlations with other variables [ 16,17 ] .
clearly , these are important benefits for outcomes research with implications for sample sizes etc .
the assumption of unidimensionality inherent in rasch analysis also provides unparalleled insight into the dimensionality of a questionnaire .
this can be used to advantage in questionnaire development .
therefore , beyond its simple application , rasch analysis has been used in three important ways in ophthalmology : the development of new questionnaires , shortening or revising existing questionnaires , and test equating .
across ophthalmology , a number of questionnaires have been developed using rasch analysis .
the field of low vision has led the way with the veterans affairs low - vision visual functioning questionnaire , the melbourne low vision adl index and the visual function questionnaire [ 18 - 22 ] .
two rasch scaled questionnaires have also been developed for refractive outcomes : one for spectacles , contact lenses and refractive surgery ( the quality of life impact of refractive correction , qirc ) and one for contact lenses only ( contact lens impact on quality of life , cliq ) [ 23 - 26 ] .
while other sub - fields of ophthalmology are yet to gain questionnaires developed using rasch analysis , these are likely not far away as a recent major review of quality of life in glaucoma called for the development of a rasch scaled glaucoma - specific visual disability questionnaire [ 27 ] .
existing conventionally validated questionnaires can be rescaled using rasch analysis .
in this way , summary scoring can be converted to a truly linear scale using a simple formula .
this has occurred for cataract surgery outcomes [ 28 ] , refractive surgery outcomes [ 17 ] , age - related macular degeneration outcomes [ 29 ] , low vision care [ 30 ] , and the measurement of ophthalmic pain [ 31,32 ] .
some of these approaches have been to simply rescore an existing questionnaire , while others have taken the approach of completely re - engineering a questionnaire to optimize its performance .
the latter process takes advantage of the insight into dimensionality of a questionnaire to refine measurement and improve targeting of content to the population .
notable examples of questionnaire re - engineering are the impact of visual impairment ( ivi ) for low vision outcomes [ 33,34 ] , the visual disability assessment ( vda ) reinvented as the cataract outcomes questionnaire [ 28,35 ] , and the visual functioning 14 ( vf - 14 ) [ 36 - 38 ] .
usually , re - engineering of questionnaires involves removal of poorly fitting items to make a shorter questionnaire , although velozo et al actually added items to the vf - 14 and yet were unable to completely satisfactorily improve the instrument [ 36 ] .
rasch analysis has also been used to simply confirm the performance of , or detect deficiencies in questionnaires [ 39 - 42 ] .
in ophthalmology , the most important patient - centred outcome measure is visual disability .
visual disability is the reason for performing cataract surgery , world wide the most common operation performed , and visual disability is a consequence of many ophthalmic diseases .
accordingly , there are many visual disability questionnaires e.g. : the visual activities questionnaire ( vaq ) [ 43 ] , the activities of daily vision scale ( advs ) questionnaire [ 44 ] , the vf - 14 [ 45 ] , the vda [ 35 ] , the national - eye institute visual functioning questionnaire ( nei - vfq )[ 46 ] and the catquest questionnaire [ 47 ] .
these questionnaires are widely used in different part of the world , for instance catquest is widely used in europe , the vf - 14 in north america , and the vda in australia .
while these questionnaires all measure the same concept , and have many of the same items , their scores cannot be simply compared .
however , rasch analysis provides a mechanism to equate scores from different questionnaires .
since all these questionnaires measure the same underlying trait , visual disability , they can all be modelled on the same latent variable .
massof has made an important first step in equating visual disability questionnaires implementing the advs , vaq , vf - 14 and the nei - vfq on a large population , conducting rasch analysis and providing equations for conversion of summary scores to rasch scores and conversion between questionnaires [ 48 ] .
while rasch analysis is in itself fairly simple , its application is somewhat specialized .
massof 's equations provide a mechanism to gain the benefits of rasch scaling without having to perform rasch analysis .
today , the outcomes researcher is faced with many different published questionnaires to choose from ; some summary scored , others rasch scaled .
a major recent review by de boer et al has attempted to make sense of this choice by systematically classifying questionnaires by the quality of their development and validation [ 49 ] .
notably , de boer et al included rasch scaling as a point of differentiation .
a logical extension of this would be to rate highest questionnaires developed using rasch analysis , followed by those conventionally developed and re - engineered using rasch analysis and then those simply re - scored using rasch analysis .
there seems to be little advantage in using non - rasch scaled questionnaires given this will increase noise and therefore reduce statistical power .
despite this , summary scored questionnaires remain popular [ 50 ] , perhaps due to the simplicity of their scoring .
but , many questionnaire developers , and other researchers , provide simple rasch scale conversion obviating the need for questionnaire users to perform rasch analysis [ 22,23,48 ] .
this simple step would have added significant value to the paper by owen et al published in this edition of bmc ophthalmology [ 50 ] .
hopefully , others will agree that the time has come to abandon summary scoring .
lets just hope that max planck 's pessimism about scientific change : " a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light , but rather because its opponents eventually die , and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it " does not hold true for the rasch analysis paradigm shift .

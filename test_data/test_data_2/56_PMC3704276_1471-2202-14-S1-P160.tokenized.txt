a fully automatic spike sorting algorithm appears to be out of reach today , mainly because of the large diversity in experimental settings and protocols .
besides , in - vivo recordings are typically highly noisy , making extremely difficult the separation of neuron sources in the spiking activity .
additionally , the development of new silicon probes with a very high number of channels raises new computational problems that require novel approaches [ 2 ] .
most existing methods are based on semi - automatic algorithms , with a first , automatic step and a second , manual step requiring the neurophysiologist 's interaction .
the manual step is typically required because no algorithm yet has the required expertise to check the quality of a spike sorting result .
the experimenter is then given a chance to check , validate , and refine the original result .
this step can be particularly long and may prevent the neurophysiologist from focusing on the scientific questions of interest underlying his experiments .
we are developing a set of tools that aim at making spike sorting sessions as efficient as possible in terms of computer time , human time , and sorting quality .
we are currently focusing on improving the manual step by developing a new ergonomic graphical user interface .
this interface guides the user through the automatic algorithm 's output and asks him to make decisions about ambiguous clusters of spikes .
similar clusters that are likely to stem from the same neuron according to a probability metric are automatically selected .
the software also chooses automatically the best feature projection that maximizes the distance between the clusters .
the user can then decide whether these clusters should be effectively merged .
several interactive views on the data are available to help the user make the best decisions .
together , these steps allow to improve the resulting spike trains quality .
we have chosen to develop this suite of tools in python , an increasingly used language in the scientific community [ 3 ] .
performance is achieved through thin bindings around highly optimized low - level libraries such as numpy ( vectorized computations ) , hdf5 ( efficient random - access input / output ) , qt ( graphical user interface ) and opengl ( open and portable hardware - accelerated visualization library ) .
our approach should make possible the analysis of coordinated spiking activity across hundreds of neurons in in - vivo recordings , a crucial step in understanding the neurophysiological bases of behavior .

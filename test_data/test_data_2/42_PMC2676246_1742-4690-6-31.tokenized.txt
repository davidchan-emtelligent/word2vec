background isolation of novel retroviral restriction factors will open new avenues for anti - hiv / aids treatment .
although hiv - 1 replication is restricted by apobec3g / apobec3f , trim5alpha , and cd317 , none defend hiv - 1 infection under natural conditions .
previously , we demonstrated a host factor from the human t cell line cem.nkr that potently restricted wild - type hiv - 1 replication .
interestingly , this restriction resembled the apobec3g / apobec3f pattern in that viral replication was inhibited from the second round of replication cycle at a post - entry step .
results here , we further characterized this factor and found it distinguishable from the known anti - hiv apobec3 proteins .
although cem.nkr cells expressed both apobec3g and apobec3f , their levels were at least 10 or 4 - fold lower than those in h9 cells , and importantly , vif effectively neutralized their activity .
among eight subclones isolated from cem.nkr cells , one was relatively permissive , four were semi - permissive , and three were completely non - permissive for hiv - 1 replication .
when the levels of apobec3 expression were determined , all these clones retained similar low levels of apobec3de , apobec3f , apobec3g and apobec3h expression , and no apobec3b expression was detected .
since the vif from sivmac can effectively neutralize apobec3b and apobec3h , recombinant hiv - 1 expressing this siv gene were created .
however , these viruses still failed to replicate in cem.nkr cells .
we also confirmed that hiv - 1 restriction in cem.nkr was not due to a loss of calnexin expression .
conclusion taken together , these results not only demonstrate that all these aforementioned anti - hiv apobec3 proteins do not contribute to this hiv - 1 restriction , but also shed light on a novel and potent hiv - 1 inhibitor in cem.nkr cells .
background cem is a human t lymphosarcoma cell line isolated from an infant female patient with acute leukemia [ 1 ] .
this human t cell line has been useful in hiv research because of its infectability and has significantly contributed to our understanding of innate intracellular immunity to retroviruses .
human t cell lines have been classified as either permissive or non - permissive cells based on their ability to support vif - deficient hiv - 1 replication .
cem and h9 are non - permissive cell lines , whereas sup - t1 and jurkat are permissive lines [ 2,3 ] .
derivative cell lines have been isolated from cem by various methods , including cem - ss [ 4 ] , cem - t4 , a3.01 [ 5 ] , and cem.nkr [ 6 ] .
interestingly , both cem - ss and cem - t4 are permissive for vif - deficient hiv - 1 replication whereas a3.01 is semi - permissive [ 7 ] , suggesting that the original cem cells are quite heterogeneous .
importantly , genetic analysis of the difference between cem and cem - ss has led to the discovery of apobec3g ( a3g ) as one of the cellular targets of vif [ 8 ] .
a3g belongs to a small group of proteins in the cytidine deaminase family known as the apobec3 ( a3 ) subfamily [ 9 ] .
this group of proteins includes a3a , a3b , a3c , a3de , a3f , a3g , and a3h .
all have antiretroviral activities against different targets including exogenous retroviruses and endogenous retroelements [ 10 ] .
a3b , a3de , a3f , and a3g contain two zinc - binding motifs , while a3a , a3c , and a3h contain only one .
a3b , a3de , a3f , and a3g inhibit hiv - 1 replication to different degrees , whereas a3a and a3c do not [ 8,11 - 16 ] .
recently , it was shown that a3h also inhibits hiv - 1 replication if its expression is optimized in cell culture [ 17 - 20 ] .
among these proteins , the anti - hiv activity of a3g and a3f is the most prominent .
nevertheless , hiv - 1 is able to elude this defense mechanism and cause human disease for two reasons .
first , a3b and a3h are poorly expressed in vivo [ 13,17,21,22 ] .
second , hiv - 1 produces vif , which binds to and mediates the destruction of a3de , a3f , and a3g in 26s proteasomes via recruitment of the cullin5 ubiquitin e3 ligase [ 23,24 ] .
vif may also inhibit a3 activity independent of proteasomal degradation [ 25 - 27 ] .
in addition to vif activity , hiv - 1 replication can also be inhibited by two other types of restriction factors : trim5alpha which blocks viral uncoating [ 28 ] and cell surface protein cd317 which blocks viral release [ 29 ] .
however , human trim5a does not inhibit hiv - 1 , and the antiviral activity of cd317 is neutralized by another viral protein vpu .
cem.nkr is a naturally isolated cell clone from cem that is resistant to natural killer ( nk ) cell - mediated lysis [ 6 ] .
previously , we tried to infect cem.nkr cells and found that they were highly resistant to productive infection by wild - type hiv - 1 [ 30 ] .
further analyses indicated that cem.nkr expressed a viral inhibitor , which did not target incoming viruses but blocked hiv - 1 at the second round of replication at a post - entry step .
since this inhibitor showed a similar inhibition profile as a3g / a3f except that it inhibited the wild - type virus , we wondered whether this resistance was simply due to an over - expression or expression of a genetic variant of known a3 cytidine deaminases which could not be inhibited by vif .
here , we present several different lines of evidence to demonstrate that this inhibitor activity is indeed novel and distinguishable from any of a3 proteins .
results and discussion over - expression of a3g / a3f is not responsible for wild - type hiv - 1 restriction in human t cells to further understand the mechanism of hiv - 1 restriction in cem.nkr , we first determined whether cem.nkr cells secreted a soluble factor that inhibited hiv - 1 replication .
since h9 cells can be productively infected by wild - type hiv - 1 , we set up a co - culture system between h9 and cem.nkr to address this issue .
after a brief incubation with wild - type virus , infected h9 or cem.nkr cells were co - cultured by either mixing together ( cem.nkr + h9 ) or separated by a permeable membrane ( h9 / cem.nkr ) in a 24 - well plate and viral production assayed as p24gag synthesized was monitored for 11 days .
h9 cells alone were productively infected with peak viral production at ~ 500 ng / ml p24gag , whereas cem.nkr cells alone were poorly infected with maximal viral production at ~ 5 ng / ml p24gag ( fig. 1a ) .
these results were consistent with our previous observations [ 30 ] .
in addition , h9 / cem.nkr and cem.nkr + h9 co - cultures were both productively infected , and viral production from the h9 / cem.nkr co - culture was slightly higher than that of h9 alone or the cem.nkr + h9 co - culture ( fig. 1a ) .
this result indicated that cem.nkr cells did not secrete a soluble hiv - 1 inhibitor .
figure 1 characterization of inhibitory activity of cem.nkr .
a ) cem.nkr cells do not secrete a soluble hiv inhibitory factor .
either 2 x 105 h9 or cem.nkr cells were infected with 150 ng p24gag of hiv - 1 ( nl4 - 3 ) for 3 hours at 37degreesc individually .
after extensive washing , they were either cultured in separated wells , co - cultured by mixing them in the same well ( cem.nkr + h9 ) at 1:1 ratio , or co - cultured in the same well at 1:1 ratio separated by a insert with a 1.0 mum transparent pet membrane ( h9 / cem.nkr ) in 24 - well plates ( bd biosciences ) .
viral production was determined by p24gag elisa over an 11 - day period .
b ) cem.nkr cells express lower levels of a3g and a3f than h9 .
cytosolic fractions were prepared from equal numbers of cem.nkr and h9 cells and the cytosol from h9 was subjected to a two - fold serial dilution .
the levels of a3g and a3f expression were analyzed by western blotting .
the levels of actin contained lysate from 5 x 106 cells ( undiluted lanes ) served as an internal control .
c ) a3g r14q and a3f q275e mutants retain anti - hiv - 1 activity .
the cdnas of a3g r14q and a3f q275e were amplified from cem.nkr by rt - pcr and cloned into pcdna3.1 / v5 - his - topo vector ( invitrogen ) .
wild - type or vif - defective hiv - 1 ( nl4 - 3 ) were produced from 293t cells in the presence of these wild - type or mutant a3g or a3f proteins and viral infectivity was determined in ghost cells .
ctrl , control vector ( pcdna3.1 ) .
d ) vif effectively inactivates a3g / a3f in cem.nkr cells .
h9 and cem.nkr cells were infected with hiv - 1 or vif - deficient hiv - 1 ( nl4 - 3 ) expressing a neomycin - resistant gene in the nef gene locus and infected cells were selected by g418 treatment .
hiv genes from nucleotides 5693 to 5912 corresponding to pnl4 - 3 sequence were amplified from these infected cells by pcr .
after cloning into ta - cloning vector , multiple clones were collected for nucleotide sequencing .
the type of mutation is summarized in tabular form , where the original hiv - 1 sequence is given at left , and the new sequence is given across the top .
n at the lower right of each box indicates the total numbers of bases sequenced .
second , we compared a3g / a3f protein levels in h9 and cem.nkr cells to determine whether a3g / a3f were overly expressed in cem.nkr cells .
cell lysates were prepared from a total of 1 x 107 h9 or cem.nkr cells .
two - fold serial dilutions were analyzed by western blotting using a3g or a3f - specific antibody .
actin served as a loading control .
surprisingly , the levels of both a3g and a3f in cem.nkr cells were around 10 or 4 - fold lower than those in h9 cells , respectively ( fig. 1b ) .
this result indicated that restriction of hiv - 1 replication in cem.nkr was not due to over - expression of a3g and a3f .
we next determined whether a3g or a3f genes contained mutations that would reduce their sensitivity to vif and contribute to the hiv - 1 non - permissiveness in cem.nkr .
a3g and a3f cdnas were amplified from cem.nkr by rt - pcr and cloned for sequencing .
interestingly , it was found that the a3g gene contained a r14q and a3f contained a q275e mutation .
to test how these mutations affected a3g and a3f , these genes were cloned into pcdna3.1 assayed for their effect on hiv - 1 in a single round replication cycle .
wild - type and vif - deficient hiv - 1 luciferase reporter viruses were produced from 293t cells in the presence of the wild - type or mutant a3g or a3f expression vectors .
equal amounts of viruses were collected to infect ghost cells and viral infectivity was determined by measuring cellular luciferase activities .
compared to the infectivity of the control hiv - 1 produced in the absence of any a3g / a3f proteins , all a3g and a3f proteins ( wild - type and mutants ) reduced the hiv - 1deltavif virus infectivity significantly more than hiv - 1 virus infectivity ( fig. 1c ) .
for example , a3g , a3g r14q , a3f , or a3f q275e reduced hiv - 1 infectivity by 12 , 8 , 60 , or 16 - fold and hiv - 1deltavif infectivity by 260 , 60 , 270 , or 80 - fold respectively .
although these results might indicate that a3g r14q and a3f q275e had slightly lower anti - hiv - 1 activity , these proteins were still sensitive to vif .
third , we wanted to directly demonstrate that vif could neutralize a3g / a3f in cem.nkr cells .
our strategy was to create hiv - 1 and hiv - 1deltavif virus - infected cem.nkr cells and compare levels of g - to - a mutations in hiv - 1 genomes .
if the hiv - 1 contained lower levels of mutations than the hiv - 1deltavif , it should further confirm a3g / a3f sensitivity to vif .
since cem.nkr cells were very difficult to infect , they were infected with hiv - 1 or hiv - 1deltavif viruses expressing a neomycin - resistance gene ( pnl - neo , pnl - neodeltavif ) and infected cells were amplified by g418 treatment .
as controls , h9 cells were infected and treated similarly .
after that , cellular dnas were extracted and hiv genes were amplified by pcr and cloned into a t - a cloning vector for sequencing .
it was found that all viral genomes contained much higher rates of g - to - a of mutations than any other mutations ( fig. 1d ) .
further analyses found that these excessive g - to - a mutations occurred in both gg and ga dinucleotides ( data not shown ) , which are preferred mutation sites for a3g and a3f .
in addition , the g - to - a hypermutation rate was much higher in h9 than cem.nkr cells , which was consistent with the higher a3g / a3f expression levels in h9 cells .
moreover , when vif was present , this g - to - a hypermutation rate was reduced to half in both h9 and cem.nkr cells ( fig. 1d ) .
these results clearly indicated that vif could neutralize a3g / a3f activity in cem.nkr cells as efficiently as in h9 cells , and they also pointed out that a complete elimination of their activities by vif might not be possible in these human t cells .
thus , we concluded that hiv - 1 resistance in cem.nkr was not due to the inability of vif to neutralize a3g / a3f .
analysis of hiv - 1 resistance in cem.nkr subpopulations although we knew that cem.nkr cells were resistant to productive hiv infection , we also found that they could become productively infected if they were exposed to prolonged viral infection ( fig. 2a ) .
after 10 days , viral production jumped from lower than 100 to 1000 ng / ml p24gag , which was similar to levels of viral production in cem - t4 cells .
although cem.nkr was reported as a cloned cell line [ 6 ] , we suspected that its cell population might be heterogenous .
a limiting dilution assay was used to assess cem.nkr homogenicity .
eight clones were isolated which were subsequently inoculated with hiv - 1 and cultured for 32 days .
it was found that all clones as well as the parental cem.nkr showed delayed viral replication kinetics compared to the highly permissive cem - t4 cell lines [ 7 ] .
however , using 100 ng / ml of p24gag as a criterion for productive infection , we could divide these clones into three groups based on how long it took to become productively infected ( fig. 2b ) .
for example , clone # 5 as well as the parental cem.nkr cells were designated as permissive cells since they only took 10 days to become productively infected ; clones # 4 , # 7 , # 8 , and # 1 cells were designated as semi - permissive cells since they took 16 to 28 days to become productively infected ; and clones # 2 , # 3 , and # 6 cells were designated as non - permissive cells since they were not productively infected even after 32 days .
it was confirmed that all these clones expressed comparable levels of cd4 and cxcr4 as the parental cell line , although clone # 2 and # 8 expressed higher levels of cxcr4 ( fig. 2c ) .
thus , cem.nkr cells contained a subset of cells that were relatively permissive for hiv - 1 replication .
figure 2 hiv - 1 resistance in cem.nkr subpopulations .
a ) hiv - 1 ( nl4 - 3 ) replication in cem.nkr and cem - t4 cells over a 16 - day period .
b ) hiv - 1 replication in cell clones from cem.nkr .
cem.nkr cells were subjected to limiting dilution and eight cell clones (# 1 to # 8 ) were isolated .
together with cem - t4 and the parental cem.nkr , these clones were infected with hiv - 1 ( nl4 - 3 ) and viral production was measured for 32 days .
c ) cd4 and cxcr4 surface expression in cell clones from cem.nkr .
the parental or each individual cell clone was stained with fluorescence - conjugated antibodies ( cd4 - fitc , cxcr4 - pe ) and analyzed by flow cytometry .
lack of correlation of a3 expression with hiv - 1 replication in cem.nkr cell clones since we obtained several cem.nkr clones that could be productively infected by hiv - 1 , we next compared wild - type and vif - deficient hiv - 1 replication to understand how a3 cytidine deaminases function in these cells .
as we reported previously , wild - type and vif - deficient hiv - 1 replicated equally well in cem - t4 cells [ 7 ] ( fig. 3a ) .
consistently , wild - type hiv - 1 started productive replication in parental cem.nkr and clone # 5 from 8 to 10 days postinfection , and in clones # 4 and # 7 from 16 days postinfection .
notably , the vif - deficient hiv - 1 failed to replicate in all these cell lines .
this result further confirmed that vif could effectively neutralize a3g / a3f proteins in cem.nkr as well as its derived cell clone # 4 , # 5 , and # 7 .
to further address whether the hiv - 1 resistance in the other non - permissive cell clones was due to an over - expression of any a3 cytidine deaminases , we measured protein expression levels of a3g and a3f by western blotting and mrna expression levels of a3b , a3de , and a3h by real - time pcr .
it was found that all these cell clones except clone # 6 expressed similar levels of a3g and a3f as the parental cem.nkr ( fig. 3b ) .
our real - time pcr analysis failed to detect a3b in any of these cell clones as well as in h9 , cem - ss , and the parental cem.nkr , confirming that a3b is poorly expressed in vivo .
the mrna levels of a3de were quite similar in cem - ss , parental cem.nkr , and these cell clones , except that levels of a3de mrna in h9 and clone # 7 were approximately 5 - fold higher ( fig. 3c ) .
in addition , the mrna levels of a3h in cem - ss , cem.nkr , and these cell clones were 100 to 1000 - fold lower than those in h9 except that clone # 7 expressed slightly higher a3h mrna ( fig. 3c ) .
since clones # 6 and # 7 exhibited a non - permissive or semi - permissive phenotype for hiv - 1 infection ( fig. 2b ) , respectively , we therefore further confirmed that levels of a3 expression did not correlate with hiv - 1 resistance in cem.nkr and its subclones .
figure 3 activity and expression of a3 cytidine deaminases in cell clones from cem.nkr .
a ) wild - type and vif - defective hiv - 1 replication in cem.nkr cell subpopulations .
a total of 2 x 105 of cem - t4 , cem.nkr , and the eight clones were infected with 150 ng p24gag of wild - type or vif - defective hiv - 1 ( nl4 - 3 ) and viral production was measured for 16 days .
b ) a3g and a3f protein expression in cem.nkr and its cell clones determined by western blotting .
c ) a3de and a3h mrna expression in cem.nkr and its cell clones as determined by real - time pcr .
results are presented as relative values , where expression levels in h9 cells are set as 100 % .
calnexin does not rescue hiv - 1 replication in cem.nkr cells it was reported that cem.nkr cells lose a cellular protein called calnexin ( canx ) , a type i transmembrane protein that plays a role in the retention of misfolded glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) [ 31 ] .
canx is found to interact with the uncleaved hiv - 1 gp160 glycoprotein [ 32 ] , and it was speculated that canx might function as a gp160 chaperone that could play a role during viral entry [ 33 ] .
to understand whether hiv restriction in cem.nkr was due to the loss of canx , cem.nkr cells were transduced with an exogenous canx gene containing a 3 ' - ha tag expressed from a retroviral vector pmscvneo and stably transduced cells were obtained by g418 selection .
using the same procedure , cem.nkr cells were also transduced with a green fluorescence protein ( gfp ) gene , and cem - t4 and cem - ss cells were transduced with the same canx gene , were used as controls .
canx and gfp proteins were all expressed in these cells as determined by western blotting ( fig. 4a ) .
when these cell lines were infected with hiv - 1 , it was found that cem.nkr cells expressing gfp and canx were almost equally resistant to viral infection , whereas cem - ss and cem - t4 cells expressing canx were productively infected ( fig. 4b ) .
this result demonstrated that expression of canx could not rescue hiv replication in cem.nkr and excluded that the blockade of viral entry was an explanation for hiv - 1 restriction in our previous observation [ 30 ] .
figure 4 hiv - resistance in cem.nkr is not due to the loss of calnexin expression .
a ) transduction of calnexin gene into cem.nkr cells .
calnexin ( canx ) or a control ( gfp ) gene with a 3 ' - ha tag was cloned into the pmscvneo retroviral vector .
recombinant retroviruses were produced by transfection of the phoenix - ampho cell line and were used to infect cem.nkr , cem - t4 , and cem - ss cells .
four stable cell lines were created by g418 selection and the expressions of transduced genes were determined by western blotting using an anti - ha antibody .
b ) hiv - 1 ( nl4 - 3 ) replication in these four cell lines .
cem.nkr cells express a hiv - 1 inhibitor previously , we demonstrated that cem.nkr cells expressed a hiv - 1 inhibitor using a cell fusion assay [ 30 ] .
in this assay , 293t cells expressing hiv - 1 gp160 were co - cultured with cem.nkr cells producing env - defective hiv - 1 .
only heterokaryons formed by gp160 and cd4 / cxcr4 mediated cell fusion could release infectious particles , which could be detected by infection of the hiv indicator cell line tzm - bi. the levels of infectious particles from heterokaryons should positively correlate with hiv - 1 resistance of the tested cell line .
notably , the levels of infectious particles from heterokaryons should also positively correlate with the fusion efficiency between 293t and the target t cells .
we therefore assessed the fusion efficiency of 293t with cem.nkr as well as its subclones .
293t cells were cotransfected with gfp and gp160 expression vectors , and co - cultured with cem - ss , cem.nkr , clone # 2 , or clone # 5 cells producing env - defective hiv - 1 , respectively .
as controls , 293t cells were only transfected with a gfp expression vector and used in these co - cultures .
the number of cd4 and gfp double positive cells were then measured by flow cytometry .
the fusion efficiency was calculated by the levels of double positive cells in the co - cultures expressing gp160 after deduction from those controls .
accordingly , cem - ss , cem.nkr , clone # 5 , and clone # 2 had 0.15 % , 0.16 % , 0.27 % , and 0.27 % fusion efficiency with 293t cells ( fig. 5a ) .
thus , cem.nkr , clone # 2 , and clone # 5 all had higher fusion efficiency with 293t than cem - ss under this condition .
figure 5 infectivity of hiv particles from cells fused with cem.nkr cell clones .
a ) fusion efficiency between cem.nkr and 293t cells .
293t cells were transfected with a gfp expression vector in the presence or absence of gp160 expression vector and then co - cultured with cem - ss , cem.nkr , clone # 2 , or clone # 5 , respectively .
after 48 hours , cells were stained with cd4 - pe and the amounts of cd4 and gfp double positive cells were measured by flow cytometry .
b ) production of infectious particles from heterokaryons between 293t and cem.nkr or its subclones .
the gp160 - expressing 293t cells were co - cultured with indicated t cells producing env - defective hiv - 1 .
after 48 hours , production of infectious particles from these co - cultures was determined by infection of tzm - bi cells .
c ) hiv - 1 ( nl4 - 3 ) replication in cem - ss , cem.nkr , clone # 2 , and clone # 5 cells .
d ) hiv - 1 ( nl4 - 3 ) replication in cem - ss and cem.nkr co - cultures .
a total of 5 x 105 hiv - infected cem - ss , cem.nkr , clone # 2 , or clone # 5 cells were co - cultured at 1:1 ratio with or without a 5 min peg treatment .
viral production from these cultures was then determined for 10 days .
we next determined the levels of infectious particles produced from these co - cultures .
a2.01 cells were used as a negative control because this cell line did not express cd4 and could not fuse with 293t cells expressing gp160 [ 7 ] .
indeed , co - cultures of 293t with a2.01 , cem.nkr , clone # 2 , and clone # 5 all produced very low levels of infectious particles , whereas the co - culture of 293t with cem - ss produced 10 to 20 - fold more infectious particles ( fig. 5b ) .
these results indicated that poor production of infectious particles from co - cultures of 293t with cem.nkr and its subclones was not due to the poor fusion efficiency , and instead , it was due to the presence of an hiv - 1 inhibitor .
to further confirm these observations , we tried to directly fuse these cem.nkr clones with cem - ss cells to see whether viral production could be suppressed .
it is known that t - cell tropic hiv - 1 can induce cell fusion and cause syncytium - formation during infection .
cem - ss cell line is not only highly permissive for hiv - 1 infection , but also sensitive to hiv - 1 - induced syncytium - formation [ 4 ] .
thus , fusion between cem - ss and cem.nkr cells could occur naturally if they were co - cultured during hiv - 1 infection .
in addition , we tired to further increase this fusion efficiency by treating cells with polyethylene glycol ( peg ) .
although clone # 5 was the most permissive for hiv - 1 infection among the cem.nkr clones , we found that this cell line was still much less permissive than cem - ss ( fig. 5c ) .
thus , this cell line might still express the same hiv - 1 inhibitor , albeit at a decreased level .
we therefore used both clone # 5 and # 2 for this determination .
hiv - 1 - infected cem - ss , cem.nkr , clone # 5 , or clone # 2 cells were co - cultured with or without a brief peg treatment and viral production was determined over a 10 - day period .
even without peg treatment , levels of virus production were all reduced from cem - ss + cem.nkr , cem - ss + clone # 5 , and cem - ss + clone # 2 co - cultures , and importantly , the reduction from cem - ss + clone # 2 was much more significant ( fig. 5d ) .
since we already demonstrated that cem.nkr cells did not secrete a soluble hiv - 1 inhibitor ( fig. 1a ) , such reduction could be explained by the appearance of cell fusion of cem - ss with cem.nkr , clone # 5 , and clone # 2 cells , resulting in an inhibition of hiv - 1 replication .
when treated with peg , viral production was further reduced , which could be due to an increase in cell fusion efficiency ( fig. 5d ) .
these results not only further supported our previous conclusion that cem.nkr cells expressed a hiv - 1 inhibitor , but also indicated that clone # 5 could express relatively lower levels of this inhibitor than clone # 2 .
the replication of hiv - 1 expressing vif from sivmac is still restricted in cem.nkr cells it is known that vif from hiv - 1 does not neutralize human a3b and a3h [ 11,17 ] .
however , vif from sivmac neutralizes not only human a3de , a3f , and a3g , but also human a3b and a3h [ 11,12,17,34 - 36 ] .
these observations suggest that vif from sivmac is a powerful tool to knock down all these known anti - hiv human apobec3 proteins .
although we already knew that cem.nkr cells had low levels of a3b and a3h expression ( fig. 3c ) , we wanted to further exclude that they were not responsible for hiv - 1 restriction in cem.nkr cells .
the vif in pnl4 - 3 was replaced with a vif from sivmac , and a recombinant hiv proviral construct pnl - macvif as well as a control pnl - hvif expressing vif from hiv - 1 was created .
we first tested their sensitivity to different human apobec3 proteins by a single round hiv replication assay .
although a3b , a3g , and a3h all restricted hiv - 1 replication , only a3g was effectively neutralized by vif from hiv - 1 ( fig. 6a , compare pnl - deltavif with pnl - hvif ) .
in contrast , vif from sivmac not only more effectively neutralized a3g than vif from hiv - 1 , but also effectively neutralized both a3b and a3h ( fig. 6a ) .
these results are consistent with previous observations .
figure 6 restriction of hiv - 1 expressing vif fromsivmac in cem.nkr cells .
a ) sivmac vif effectively neutralized human apobec3 proteins in single cycle hiv - 1 replication assay .
proviral constructs pnl - deltavif , pnl - hvif , or pnl - macvif were co - transfected with pcdna3.1 ( ctrl ) , pcdna - a3g , pcdna - a3b or vr - a3h into 293t cells at 1:1 ratio .
after normalized by p24gag , equal amounts of viruses were used to infect tzm - bi cells , and viral infectivity was determined by measuring cellular luciferase activity 24 hours postinfection .
results were shown as relative values , where the infectivity of viruses produced in the presence of pcdna3.1 was set as 100 .
b ) replication of hiv - 1 expressing vif from sivmac in different human t cell lines .
a total of 2 x 105 cells from indicated cell lines were infected with 150 ng p24gag of hiv - 1 from pnl - macvif , and viral replications were determined for 16 days .
next , we used viruses produced from pnl - macvif to infect several different human t cell lines .
in a 16 - day period , these viruses replicated robustly in both cem - ss cells and cem - ss cells expressing an exogenous a3g gene , indicating that they successfully overcame a3g restriction ; they replicated well in h9 cells , indicating that they could also overcome a3f and a3de restriction ( fig. 6b ) .
notably , their replications in cem.nkr cell line as well as its clones # 5 and # 2 were quite similar to the wild - type hiv - 1 as seen in fig. 2b .
the relatively permissive clone # 5 also supported pnl - macvif viruses replication whereas the non - permissive clone # 2 did not .
the parental cem.nkr cell line showed a phenotype between these two clones .
these results demonstrated that hiv - 1 replication was still restricted in cem.nkr cells even in the presence of vif from sivmac , which disproved any possible role of a3b and a3h in this hiv - 1 restriction .
conclusion in this report , we have not only confirmed the hiv - 1 inhibitor in cem.nkr cells , but also found that it was quite different from any known apobec3 proteins .
although cem.nkr cells expressed a3g and a3f , their activities were effectively neutralized by hiv - 1 vif as evidenced by the decreased g - to - a hypermutations in the wild - type viral genome ( fig. 1d ) .
they , therefore , should not be able to restrict the wild - type hiv - 1 replication in cem.nkr cells .
in addition , we found that both a3b and a3h were poorly expressed in cem.nkr cells ( fig. 3c and data not shown ) , and importantly , hiv - 1 expressing vif from sivmac that effectively inactivated theses two human genes still failed to productively replicate in these cells ( fig. 6b ) .
these results excluded any possible contribution of these apobec3 cytidine deaminases to this restriction .
thus , cem.nkr cells express a novel host factor that potently inhibit hiv - 1 replication .
so far , all biologically functional retrovirus restriction factors identified in humans , including a3g / a3f [ 8,15,16 ] , trim5alpha [ 28 ] , and cd317 [ 29 ] , have been counteracted by hiv - 1 .
the a3g / a3f proteins are targeted for proteasomal degradation by vif [ 15,16,24,37 - 39 ] ; the cd317 proteins that can tether viral particles on the cell surface are inactivated by vpu [ 29 ] ; unlike old world monkey trim5alpha proteins , human trim5alpha proteins do not have anti - hiv - 1 activity .
these facts suggest that these host factors have imposed very strong evolutionary pressures during the cross - species transmission of hiv - 1 to humans , and the virus needs to develop counteractive mechanisms in order to spread into humans .
why hiv - 1 failed to develop a strategy to counteract this novel factor is an intriguing and critical question .
one possibility is that it may not be broadly expressed in human tissues , particularly in the primary sites of hiv - 1 replication .
among different cem - derived cell lines , only cem.nkr cells express this factor .
in addition , previous proteomics investigation has found that cem.nkr cells lose one cellular gene calnexin [ 31 ] , indicating a difference in gene expression profile between cem.nkr and its parental cell line .
consistently , our biological analyses demonstrate that cem.nkr cells express an extra host factor .
it is very fortunate that this factor exhibits very strong anti - hiv - 1 activity .
it will be very interesting to know whether the expression of this factor is broadly inducible in various tissues , particularly in cd4 + t cells and monocytes / macrophages .
such induction could be directly used for hiv - 1 suppression .
thus , further characterization of this novel factor and study of its anti - hiv mechanism would lead to the discovery of a powerful antiretroviral treatment .

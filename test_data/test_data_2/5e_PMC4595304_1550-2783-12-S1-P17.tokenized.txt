creatine monohydrate is one of the most studied ergogenic aids .
although many studies have reported the efficacy and effectiveness of creatine monohydrate supplement manufacturers continually introduce newer forms of creatine into the marketplace .
the newer forms of creatine purport to be more effective than creatine monohydrate alone .
however , there is little evidence to support most manufacturers' claims .
methods we examined 28d of randomly assigned ( 1 ) placebo ( pl ) , ( 2 ) creatine monohydrate ( crm ; 3 g ) , ( 3 ) creatine nitrate ( crn ; 1 g crm ; 0.5 g n ) and ( 4 ) crn2x ( 2 g crm ; 1.0 g n ) on bench press performance .
participants ( n = 48 ; 21 +/ - 3 yrs ) presented for fasting ( 12 h ) testing after abstaining from exercise and alcohol for 48 h. performance ( reps at 70 % of bench press 1 rm ) was measured using a tendo fitrodyne at 0 & 28d and analyzed by manova or one - way anova .
mean changes ( 95 % ci ) were reported .
results we previously reported ( faseb j , 29 ( 1 ) : lb248 , 2015 ) that all treatment groups increased bench press repetitions after 28d of supplementation ; however , total work ( reps x weight lifted ) during bench press was greater at 28d for crn2x ( 294.6 lbs ; 95 % ci , 196 , 393 ) vs. crn ( 164.2 lbs ; 95 % ci , 25 , 304 ) and pl ( 187.1 lbs ; 95 % ci , 37 , 336 , both p = 0.02 ) .
manova univariate analysis of power data indicated a significant time effect with all power output variables ( i.e. , peak power ( pp ) , average power ( ap ) , and average velocity ( av )) .
no significant group by time effects were observed among groups .
one - way anova of the 3rd set of exercise performed to exhaustion revealed no significant differences among groups in changes from baseline after 28d of supplementation .
however , pairwise comparison of 95 % cis revealed a significant difference in peak power and average power between crn2x ( 522.8 w ; 95 % ci , 473.5 , 572.2 ) and pl ( 422.9 w ; 95 % ci , 386.6 , 499.1 , p = 0.037 ) and crn2x ( 470.3 w ; 95 % ci 422.1 , 518.5 ) and pl ( 386.1 w ; 95 % ci , 331.1 , 441.0 , p = 0.025 ) , respectively .
average power was also significantly different between crn2x ( 470.3 w ; 95 % ci 422.1 , 518.5 ) and crn ( 384.0 w ; 95 % ci , 335.8 , 432.2 , p = 0.014 ) .
average velocity during bench press test was also significantly different between crn ( 0.629 m / s ; 95 % ci , 0.572 , 0.686 ) and pl ( 0.525 m / s ; 95 % , 0.460 , 0.590 , p = 0.02 ) .
conclusion results suggest some ergogenic value of consuming these types of creatine containing pre - workout supplements on bench press power adaptations during training in comparison to pl responses .

until recently , the two predominant ways to estimate mutation rates were the specific - locus method and the mutation - accumulation ( bateman - mukai ) method .
both involve seeding a number of parallel lines from a small , genetically uniform population , growing as long as is feasible but not so long as to allow selection to perturb mutant frequencies , and sometimes using extreme bottlenecks to facilitate the retention of deleterious mutations .
in the specific - locus method , mutations are selected according to their specific phenotypes and are confirmed by sequencing .
in older versions of the mutation - accumulation method , the increase in variance of a quantitative fitness trait is measured and converted into a mutation rate .
more recently , a variation on the mutation - accumulation method has become possible based on phenotype - blind genomic sequencing , which might ( or might not ) provide improved sampling breadth , usually at the expense of sample size .
in a recent study , genomic sequencing was applied to escherichia coli lines propagated for 40,000 generations and passaged daily via 5,000,000 cells .
to mitigate the impact of selection , the only targets employed for rate calculations were putatively neutral synonymous mutations .
the mutation rate estimate was about 6 - fold lower than obtained previously with a robust specific - locus method .
here i argue that purifying selection acting to shape the strong codon preferences of e. coli is the probable cause of the lower estimate , rather than , for instance , a lower mutation rate in nature than in the laboratory .
specific - locus mutation rates genomic sequencing for mutation rates synonymous codons neutral mutations djs export v1 microbial mutation rates can be estimated in a number of distinct ways .
in the classical specific - locus method , mutants are detected by their phenotypes following limited growth ( on the order of 30 generations ) starting with a number of small , mutant - free populations , and the presumed target loci are then sequenced .
the advantage of the method is that growth is terminated before confounders , such as selection ( differential growth of mutants vs. parentals ) , can produce a substantial effect , and this and other confounders can in any case be reconstructed and measured and the mutation rate adjusted appropriately .
the impacts of jackpots ( high mutant frequencies resulting from particularly early appearances of the first mutation ) are marginalized by adopting the median rate of the parallel cultures. with the advent of inexpensive dna sequencing methods , highly informative specific - locus mutation rates and spectra can be constructed based upon hundreds of mutations collected under conditions that are free from selection perturbations .
this has allowed base - substitution rates to be estimated from the minority of chain - termination mutations , which are detected with high efficiency because they generate stop codons and thus truncate proteins and exhibit high penetrance , and thus constitute particularly well - defined mutational targets , in contract to missense mutations ; a minor disadvantage is that chain - termination mutations sample most but not all base - substitution pathways .
carefully measured basal genomic base - substitution mutation rates are now available for seven mesophilic dna microbes , and the values cluster closely : 0.0022 , 0.0025 , 0.0026 , 0.0030 , 0.0035 , 0.0038 , 0.0043 , mean = 0.0032 , the escherichia coli value being underlined ( drake 2009 ) .
although larger values are seen in mutator mutants , substantially smaller values are not ( drake 1993 ) , at least using well - characterized specific - locus methods .
a very different method for estimating microbial mutation rates is a version of the classical mutation - accumulation method in which a number of parallel lines are established and propagated for various times ( which can correspond to tens of thousands of generations ) and genomic sequencing is then performed .
because the observed ratios of non - synonymous ( missense ) to synonymous ( putatively silent ) mutations are far smaller than the 3:1 ratio expected from random base substitutions in a genome with close to 25 % of each base , strong purifying selection against missense mutations is inferred , rendering such mutations useless for rate estimations .
instead , the accumulated synonymous mutations may be used as the most neutral ( selection - free ) set .
the advantage of this method is that the entire protein - encoding portion of the genome can be sampled .
a current disadvantage is that the number of retrieved mutations may be small ; for instance , an e. coli cell with a genomic base - substitution rate of 0.0025 per generation ( drake 1991 , 2009 ) grown for 40,000 generations would experience =~ 100 base substitutions. of these , 86 would modify protein - coding sequences and about a fourth of that set , or 21.5 , would be synonymous base substitutions .
just such an experiment was recently described ( wielgoss et al. 2011 ) .
the experimental material was a set of eight long - term e. coli strain b cultures transferred daily for many years ( mostly for 40,000 generations ) by growing a severely glucose - limited sample to overnight saturation at 5 x 107 / ml , diluting 0.1 ml into 9.9 ml of fresh medium , and regrowing .
samples saved frozen from various generations were then subjected to genomic sequencing , and candidate base substitutions were confirmed by resequencing .
lines that had gained a mutator mutation were excluded .
the resulting rate was ( 25 synonymous mutations )/( 300,000 cumulative generations )( 941,000 synonymous sites ) = 8.9 x 10 - 11 per base pair per generation or , for the 4,629,812 - base ( pair ) genome , 0.00041 base - pair substitutions per genome per generation .
the genomic base - substitution rate for e. coli obtained by applying the specific - locus method to the laci gene in strain k12 is =~ 0.0025 based on a spectrum containing 24 chain - termination mutations ( drake 1991 , 2009 ) .
this value is 6.1 - fold higher than the rate of 0.00041 from wielgoss et al .
( 2011 ) , who commented in their abstract that " our estimate represents the most accurate measure of bacterial base - substitution rates available to date " and in the text that " our estimate is probably more accurate " applying " the reasonable presumption of selective neutrality or near - neutrality for most synonymous mutations. " however , it has long been known that synonymous codon usage in bacteria is often strongly biased and is subject to substantial selection , especially in e. coli ( sharp and li 1987 ; ochman 2003 ; sharp et al. 2005 ; hershberg and petrov 2008 ) .
the factors that frame the selective forces may include the rate of transcription and the associated correlation between trna abundance and codon bias , the rate of polypeptide folding , the location of the codon within the gene , and the distance of the gene from the replication origin .
which of these are operating in the present case must remain enigmatic because little is known about selection on codon usage under these experimental growth conditions .
however , it was possible from the data posted in wielgoss et al .
( 2011 ) to determine the vectors of most of their mutations with respect to codon usage. of 23 mutations , 12 were switches from codons more often used to less often used , 7 were switches between codons similarly often used , and 4 were from codons less often used to more often used ( supporting information , table s1 ) .
this pattern informs poorly about whether frequency of use was a main driver of selection on codon usage , at least in this particular set of 40,000 generations of probably highly stressful growth in a thoroughly unnatural environment during which quite a few of the populations were taken over by mutator mutants .
the neutrality assumption might be tested , for example , by examining the relationship between the codon adaptation index and the mutations observed in these populations .
even weak selection coefficients are likely to impact mutation accumulation in a set of 40,000 - generation cultures passing through daily bottlenecks of 5,000,000 cells .
an informative set of these selection coefficients could , with some effort , be directly assessed in reconstruction controls starting from artificial mixtures of mutant and parental genotypes .
in addition , several striking examples of the impact of a synonym on the phenotype have surfaced in a recent version of the e. coli laczalpha mutation assay ( zhong et al .
2006 ) , wherein mutants can be detected by even slight reductions from the wild - type dark - blue phage - m13 plaque color .
five synonyms that reduce plaque color are c - - > g at site 44 , c - - > t at 86 and 95 , c - - > a at 107 , and c - - > g at 167 ( m. e. arana and t. a. kunkel , personal communication ) .
( site numbers begin before the translated sequence , and codon third positions happen not to be multiples of 3. ) as in the example of the 23 mutations mentioned above , the codon - usage vectors are diverse : three point downward and two point upwards .
because the mutational target used by wielgoss et al .
( 2011 ) is likely to experience purifying selection during 40,000 generations , it would be appropriate to accept the e. coli specific - locus rate as the best current measure , and to estimate the average selection coefficient against synonymous base substitutions from the 6 - fold lower mutation - accumulation rate .
students of spontaneous mutation may find some interesting gifts in the data of wielgoss et al .
( 2011 ) .
the authors noted that mutations from g / c to a / t ( that is , from g.c to a.t or to t.a ) at synonymous sites were more prevalent than mutations from a / t to g / c , as has been noted in many other organisms ( e.g. , lynch 2007 ) , suggesting that still poorly defined selective forces drive a / t to g / c to achieve the observed genomic ratios. of the 23 index mutants that could be traced back to the genomic sequence from their compilations , 16 were g / c - - > a / t ( 14 as transitions ) , 4 were a / t - - > g / c , and 3 were a.t - - > t.a , a strong bias for an organism with a genomic g.c content of 50.8 % [ genbank : nc _ 012967.1 ] ( table s1 ) .
a similar result can be observed among 80 base substitutions in the e. coli laci gene ( whose 1083 protein - encoding base pairs are 56.3 % g.c , significantly different from the corresponding e. coli value at p =~ 0.01 ) : 58 were g / c - - > a / t ( 45 as transitions ) , 12 were a / t - - > g / c , 3 were g.c - - > c.g , and 7 were a.t - - > t.a ( farabaugh 1978 ; halliday and glickman 1991 ) ( table s2 ) .
thus , this mutational bias appears to be general rather than focused on synonymous mutations .
in addition to the mutated base pair itself , the data of wielgoss et al .
( 2011 ) provide hints of associations with g / c base pairs at nearby sites. of the 23 mutated sites and independently of whether that site was g / c or a / t , the numbers of g / c base pairs extending in both directions from - 5 through the mutated site to + 5 were 16 , 10 , 16 , 18 , 15 , 16 ( the mutated site ) , 15 , 10 , 13 , 10 , 11 compared with an expected value of 23 x 0.508 = 11.7 per site ( table s1 ) .
when the pooled numbers were compared with the expected values by a replicated goodness - of - fit test , the deviation was significant ( gp = 4.88 , 1 df , p < 0.05 ) .
in addition , the numbers differed among positions ( gh = 14.7 , 9 df , p = 0.0995 ) , with a few underlined positions showing low or significant p values ( for positions - 5 and - 3 , p = 0.078 ; for position - 2 , p = 0.007 ) .
combining the overall deviation from the expected incidences and the heterogeneity of the data , the total statistic was significant ( gt = gp + gh = 19.5 , 10 df , p <= 0.05 ) .
although these results are not statistically impressive because of the numbers mutations , they prompted a similar inspection of the 80 laci mutations of halliday and glickman ( 1991 ) , which yielded 40 , 50 , 40 , 42 , 61 , 61 , 39 , 51 , 38 , 33 , 57 compared with an expected number of 80 x 0.563 = 45.04 per site ( table s2 ) .
when these numbers were analyzed , the statistic for the pooled data was not significant ( gp = 0.05 , 1 df , p = 0.8307 ) , but the heterogeneity statistic was highly significant ( gh = 39.2 , 9 df , p < 0.0001 ) , as was the total statistic ( gt = 39.2 , 10 df , p < 0.0001 ) .
the number at - 1 had p < 0.0001 , that at + 5 had p = 0.0081 , and that at + 4 ( high a / t ) had p = 0.0049 .
a pronounced tendency toward hypermutability within g / c - rich sequences was later noted for the dna polymerase of coliphage rb69 , a relative of phage t4 ( bebenek et al. 2001 ) .
the molecular bases for these tendencies can probably be best characterized by pre - steady - state kinetics and estimates of efficiencies of mismatch extension using appropriate primer.template combinations , as in xia et al .
( 2011 ) and arana et al .
( 2011 ) .

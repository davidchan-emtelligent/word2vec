background the associations between pulmonary diseases ( asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ copd ] , and tuberculosis [ tb ]) and subsequent lung cancer risk have been reported , but few studies have investigated the association with different histologic types of lung cancer .
methods patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer from 2004 to 2008 were identified from the national health insurance research database in taiwan .
histologic types of lung cancer were further confirmed using the taiwan cancer registry database .
cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio ( hr ) of asthma , copd , and tb and to estimate the risk of specific types of lung cancer .
results during the study period , 32,759 cases of lung cancer were identified from 15,219,024 insurants aged 20 years and older .
in men and women , the adjusted hr estimates of squamous cell carcinoma were respectively 1.37 ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] , 1.21 - 1.54 ) and 2.10 ( 95 % ci , 1.36 - 3.23 ) for tb , 1.52 ( 95 % ci , 1.42 - 1.64 ) and 1.50 ( 95 % ci , 1.21 - 1.85 ) for asthma , and 1.66 ( 95 % ci , 1.56 - 1.76 ) and 1.44 ( 95 % ci , 1.19 - 1.74 ) for copd .
similarly , the adjusted hr estimates of adenocarcinoma were respectively 1.33 ( 95 % ci , 1.19 - 1.50 ) and 1.86 ( 95 % ci , 1.57 - 2.19 ) for tb , 1.13 ( 95 % ci , 1.05 - 1.21 ) and 1.18 ( 95 % ci , 1.09 - 1.28 ) for asthma , and 1.50 ( 95 % ci , 1.42 - 1.59 ) and 1.33 ( 95 % ci , 1.25 - 1.42 ) for copd .
the hrs of small cell carcinoma were respectively 1.24 ( 95 % ci , 1.01 - 1.52 ) and 2.23 ( 95 % ci , 1.17 - 4.25 ) for tb , 1.51 ( 95 % ci , 1.35 - 1.69 ) and 1.63 ( 95 % ci , 1.16 - 2.27 ) for asthma , and 1.39 ( 95 % ci , 1.26 - 1.53 ) and 1.78 ( 95 % ci , 1.33 - 2.39 ) for copd .
conclusions asthma , copd , and tb were associated with an increased risk of all major subtypes of lung cancer .
the risk was the highest among women with tb. keywords asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease lung adenocarcinoma small cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma tuberculosis issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background lung cancer is the second leading diseases contributing to years of life lost because of premature mortality [ 1 ] .
among histologic types of lung cancer , adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype in asians but not in europeans [ 2 , 3 ] .
typical risk factors for lung cancer include smoking and exposure to arsenic , chromium , radon , or air pollution [ 4 , 5 ] .
smoking is the major risk factor for lung cancer , particularly squamous cell carcinoma ( sqcc ) [ 6 ] .
however , a previous study demonstrated that most taiwanese women with lung cancer are non - smokers [ 7 ] .
a vast majority of smokers do not seem to develop lung cancer .
although smoking is a potential risk factor , other factors may also be linked to the increased risk of lung cancer .
recent studies have concluded that chronic inflammation may be linked to lung carcinogenesis [ 8 ] .
among intrinsic pulmonary diseases , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) [ 9 , 10 ] , asthma [ 11 ] , and tuberculosis ( tb ) [ 12 ] are associated with lung cancer .
smokers with copd have a higher risk of sqcc [ 13 , 14 ] .
asthma is associated with an increased risk of sqcc and small cell carcinoma ( smcc ) but is weakly associated with adenocarcinoma [ 15 , 16 ] .
tb is also associated with an increased risk of sqcc and adenocarcinoma but not smcc [ 17 ] .
an association between tb and lung adenocarcinoma has been reported in non - westernized countries [ 18 ] .
furthermore , the association of lung cancer with diabetes [ 19 ] and dyslipidemia [ 20 - 22 ] has been reported .
data on pulmonary diseases and specific histologic types of lung cancer are considerable limited in taiwan .
for a detailed evaluation of the relationship between pulmonary diseases and histologic types of lung cancer , a population - based cohort study is highly desirable .
however , few such studies have been conducted .
this study assessed whether pulmonary diseases are associated with an increased risk of specific types of lung cancer .
methods database the national health insurance research database ( nhird ) contains enrollment files , claims data , catastrophic illness files , and treatment registries .
the national health insurance program covers more than 99 % of the population of taiwan .
the nhird is one of the largest administrative health care databases that is broadly used in academic studies [ 23 - 25 ] .
this study used the linked databases of the nhird , taiwan cancer registry database ( tcrd ) , and national death registry database ( ndrd ) with the permission of the department of statistics , ministry of health and welfare of taiwan .
the source data was encrypted and the data extracted was anonymous .
this study was approved by the institutional review board of the chung - shan medical university hospital , taiwan .
identification of patients with lung cancer in this study , 17,859,318 residents aged 20 years and older were initially enrolled .
we excluded patients diagnosed with lung cancer before 2003 ( n = 39,623 ) and those with incomplete information on sex ( n = 2,600,565 ) , registry data ( n = 5 ) , and death ( n = 101 ) .
finally , 15,219,024 patients ( 8,002,536 men and 7,216,488 women ) were enrolled in this study .
patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer in 2004 were followed up until death , loss to follow - up , or the study end in 2008 .
lung cancer was identified using the international classification of diseases , ninth revision , clinical modification ( icd - 9 - cm ) code 162 .
furthermore , histologic types of lung cancer were confirmed using the tcrd .
the registry contains data on cancer types , initial tumor stages , and histology .
lung cancer was identified using the icd - 9 - cm code 162 or icd 10 codes c34.0 , c34.1 , c34.2 , c34.3 , c34.8 , and c34.9 in the tcrd .
morphological diagnoses were determined using the ninth revision of the international classification of diseases for oncology ( icd - o ) on the basis of the following icd - o codes : 80522 , 80523 , 80702 , 80703 , 80713 , 80723 , 80733 , 80743 , 80763 , 80823 , 80833 , and 80843 for lung sqcc ; 80503 , 81402 , 81403 , 81413 , 81433 , 82113 , 82503 , 82513 , 82523 , 82553 , 82603 , 83103 , 83233 , 84603 , 84803 , 84813 , 84903 , and 85003 for adenocarcinoma ; 80023 , 80412 , 80413 , 80423 , 80433 , 80453 , and 94733 for smcc ; and 80123 , 80143 , 80203 , 80213 , 80303 , and 80313 for large cell carcinoma .
the linked databases were used to retrieve information on the age of lung cancer diagnosis , follow - up time ( in person - years ) , and survival time and to minimize potentially unconfirmed cancer diagnoses .
variables of exposure baseline variables included age , sex , urbanization level , geographical area , low income , and comorbidities .
to reduce bias , the diagnoses of pulmonary diseases and comorbidities were confirmed by more than two outpatient visits or one admission between 2001 and 2003 .
pulmonary diseases and comorbidities were defined using the following icd - 9 - cm codes : asthma ( 493 ) , copd ( 490 , 491 , 492 , 494 , and 496 ) , tb ( 010 - 012 , and137.0 ) , chronic kidney disease ( 585 and 586 ) , type ii diabetes mellitus ( 250 , which excludes type i diabetes mellitus ) , and hyperlipidemia ( 272 ) .
smoking , a major risk factor for lung cancer , copd , and other cancer types are not available in the nhird [ 26 , 27 ] ; hence , this prevented direct adjustment for all possible confounders .
however , smoking - related cancers such as lip , oral cavity , nasal cavity , pharynx , larynx , esophagus ( icd - 9 - cm codes : 140 - 150 and 160 - 161 ) , pancreas ( icd - 9 - cm code 157 ) , kidney , and bladder cancers ( icd - 9 - cm codes 188 and 189 ) were adjusted [ 28 ] .
statistical analyses all statistical analyses were conducted using the sas statistical package ( version 9.3 ; sas institute , inc. , cary , nc ) .
the characteristics of the study population were compared using the chi - square test .
a p value of < 0.05 was statistically significant .
to evaluate the effect of age , patients were classified according to sex and age ( 20 - 39 , 40 - 49 , 50 - 59 , 60 - 69 , 70 - 79 , and >= 80 years ) .
all cities and towns were divided into three urbanization levels : low , medium , and high .
the cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratios ( hrs ) of histologic types of lung cancer while controlling for age , geographical area , urbanization level , low income , and comorbidities .
results during the study period , 32,759 cases of lung cancer were identified. of all patients diagnosed , 47.3 % had adenocarcinoma ( m : f , 8,778 : 6,712 ) , 20.3 % had sqcc ( 5,877 : 760 ) , 9.2 % had smcc ( 2,751 : 268 ) , 0.7 % had large cell carcinoma ( 183 : 57 ) , and 23.2 % had other diseases ( 5,283 : 2,090 ) .
the demographic characteristics and comorbidities of the study population are displayed in table 1 .
patients with lung cancer had higher rates of asthma , copd , tb , hyperlipidemia , diabetes , chronic kidney disease , and smoking - related cancer than individuals without lung cancer did .

determining risk factors for specific types of lung cancer can help physicians gain a detailed understanding of the etiology of lung cancer and therefore identify the high - risk population for screening .
to the best of our knowledge , no study has investigated the association between pulmonary diseases and histologic types of lung cancer .
according to the study results , heterogeneity was observed in the risk factors for lung cancer and the different histologic types in male and female patients .
a population - based , case - control study of female nonsmokers revealed an increased risk of lung cancer in patients with tb who were diagnosed before the age of 21 years [ 29 ] .
the incidence rate ratio of lung cancer in the tb cohorts was 1.98 ( 95 % ci , 1.37 - 2.83 ) 2 - 4 years after tb infection [ 12 ] .
a hospital - based , case - control study involving interviews of 226 female nonsmokers with lung cancer and 279 controls demonstrated that tb increased the risk of lung cancer ( odds ratio [ or ] , 4.7 ; 95 % ci , 1.6 - 13.2 ) [ 30 ] .
yu et al. found an increased risk of lung cancer among patients with tb ( hr , 3.32 ; 95 % ci , 2.70 - 4.09 ) , which was higher than that of copd ( hr , 2.30 ; 95 % ci , 2.07 - 2.55 ) [ 28 ] .
a systematic review identified a direct relationship between preexisting tb and lung cancer , particularly adenocarcinoma ( relative risk [ rr ] , 1.6 ; 95 % ci , 1.2 - 2.1 ) [ 18 ] .
a study conducted in taiwan demonstrated that tb was an independent risk factor for sqcc , smcc , and adenocarcinoma in men and women [ 6 ] .
such an association is particularly crucial in taiwan , where the prevalence of tb is high [ 31 , 32 ] .
compared with asthma and copd , tb appears to have a stronger association with lung cancer among women .
additional studies are necessary to assess the possible mechanisms of this association .
in this study , copd was associated with the risk of the major types of lung cancer .
chronic airway inflammation is a major risk factor for copd and is also associated with an increased risk of lung cancer [ 13 ] .
a study involving the 22 - year follow - up of 5,402 participants concluded that moderate - to - severe obstructive pulmonary disease was associated with a higher risk of incident lung cancer ( hr , 2.8 ; 95 % ci , 1.8 - 4.4 ) [ 33 ] .
denholm et al. found that chronic bronchitis and emphysema were positively associated with lung cancer after adjusting for other respiratory diseases and smoking ( or , 1.33 ; 95 % ci , 1.20 - 1.48 for men ; or , 1.50 ; 95 % ci , 1.21 - 1.87 for women ) [ 34 ] .
the prevalence of smoking is almost 10 - fold higher in taiwanese men than that in women [ 35 ] .
however , the smoking status of the study population was not available .
this may be the reason for the observed differences between men and women .
chronic bronchitis and emphysema increased the risk of sqcc ( hr , 1.54 ; 95 % ci , 1.09 - 2.18 ) independent of smoking [ 36 ] .
copd also increased the risk of sqcc in smokers [ 13 ] .
pesch et al. performed a pooled analysis of case - control studies including 13,169 cases and 16,010 controls from europe and canada [ 37 ] .
their analysis demonstrated that adenocarcinoma was the most prevalent subtype in never - smokers and women .
the ors were elevated for exposure to cigarette smoke and were higher for sqcc and smcc than for adenocarcinoma .
freedman et al. recruited 279,214 men and 184,623 women aged 50 - 71 years from eight states in the united states to evaluate whether women were more susceptible to lung cancer caused by cigarette smoking than men [ 38 ] .
their results illustrated that the hrs of adenocarcinoma , smcc , and undifferentiated tumors were similar between men and women among ex - smokers and current smokers .
however , among current smokers , the hr of sqcc in men was approximately 2 - fold higher than that in women .
this study also suggests that patients with asthma are at an increased risk of three histological types ( sqcc , adenocarcinoma , and smcc ) of lung cancer .
asthma is one of the most common chronic airway diseases and affects 300 million people of all ages and ethnicities [ 39 ] .
in taiwan , the prevalence of asthma has increased to 11.9 % [ 40 ] .
because asthma causes complex chronic airway inflammation , it has been hypothesized to lead to carcinogenesis [ 8 ] .
case - control studies have produced varied results for the association between asthma and lung cancer [ 41 , 42 ] .
in a swedish cohort with a hospital - discharge diagnosis of asthma , the standardized incidence rate ratio of lung cancer was 1.51 in men ( 95 % ci , 1.38 - 1.65 ) and 1.78 in women ( 95 % ci , 1.55 - 2.03 ) , and the risk of histologic types of lung cancer was higher in patients with sqcc and smcc [ 16 ] .
in a meta - analysis , the rrs were 1.69 ( 95 % ci , 1.26 - 2.26 ) for sqcc , 1.71 ( 95 % ci , 0.99 - 2.95 ) for smcc , and 1.09 ( 95 % ci , 0.88 - 1.36 ) for adenocarcinoma [ 15 ] .
in this study , hyperlipidemia was also associated with an increased risk of adenocarcinoma .
hyperlipidemia is a component of metabolic syndrome and is associated with insulin resistance [ 43 ] .
hyperinsulinemia , hyperglycemia , and chronic inflammation play a vital role in the neoplastic process [ 44 ] .
high serum triglyceride concentrations are associated with an increased risk of lung cancer ( fourth vs first quartile : hr , 1.94 ; 95 % ci , 1.47 - 2.54 ) [ 22 ] .
additional studies are required to assess the association between hyperlipidemia and adenocarcinoma .
evaluating the temporal relationship between pulmonary diseases and subsequent lung cancer in case - control studies is difficult .
previous studies might have yielded inconclusive results because they focused mainly on the high - risk populations of heavy smokers .
this study has several strengths .
first , our data were retrieved from combined databases ( nhird , tcrd and ndrd ) that included all residents ; hence , recall and selection bias was minimized .
second , the histologic type of lung cancer was confirmed using the tcrd .
nevertheless , our study has some limitations .
first , the nhird does not contain detailed clinical data and information on lifestyle - related factors such as smoking , obesity , physical inactivity , dietary habits , and family history , which are closely associated with lung cancer .
smoking is a major confounding factor of lung cancer .
biases were minimized by adjusting for copd and smoking - related cancer .
second , patients with asthma , copd , and tb may have used medications that may have complicated their conditions .
this study did not evaluate the effects of drugs .
conclusions this study demonstrated that asthma , copd , and tb were associated with increased risks of all major subtypes of lung cancer .

microbial electrosynthesis is a useful form of technology for the renewable production of organic commodities from biologically catalyzed reduction of co2 .
however , for the technology to become applicable , process selectivity , stability and efficiency need strong improvement .
here we report on the effect of different electrochemical control modes ( potentiostatic / galvanostatic ) on both the start - up characteristics and steady - state performance of biocathodes using a non - enriched mixed - culture inoculum .
based on our results , it seems that kinetic differences exist between the two dominant functional microbial groups ( i.e. , homoacetogens and methanogens ) and that by applying different current densities , these differences may be exploited to steer product selectivity and reactor performance .
biocathode acetate current density microbial electrosynthesis ( mes ) bioelectrochemical systems ( bes ) kinetics thermodynamics methanogen acetogen competition 1 .
introduction the use of bioelectrochemical systems ( bes ) for the production of organic compounds such as alcohols or short - to medium - chain fatty acids through microbial electrosynthesis ( mes ) holds potential [ 1 ]. by exploiting the capabilities of microorganisms to metabolize using electrodes as electron donors - - a feature that is found to be widespread amongst most diverse groups of microorganisms [ 2 ] - - a variety of organic compounds can be synthesized in mild operational conditions [ 3,4,5 ] .
as such , these systems provide an environmentally friendly means for producing useful chemicals using cheap and available substrates ( carbon dioxide and water ) , while avoiding the requirement of scarce metal catalysts in the cathode , as would be the case in most conventional electrosynthetic processes .
while the products potentially formed in mes are found to be diverse , the main scientific efforts in this field have so far focused on the specific production of acetate by the reduction of carbon dioxide [ 6,7,8,9,10,11 ] .
there are two general considerations at the basis of this product choice : ( 1 ) specificity ; and ( 2 ) reaction rate. with the standard reduction potential of acetate from co2 being the highest amongst all carboxylates ( and considerably higher than that of formate ) , the potential window within which the cathodic production of acetate can take place shows minimal overlap with respect to most alternative co2 reduction products .
this provides a thermodynamic advantage regarding the specificity towards the production of acetate .
in addition , with the number of electrons ( eight ) still being considerably low compared to higher reduction products like butyrate , reaction rates are not severely kinetically limited , and production of acetate at high specificity ( up to 100 %) , and in some cases at high rates ( up to 66 kg.m - 3.day - 1 ) , has been achieved in biocathodes [ 7 ] .
troubling to the specific and efficient production of acetate in bes is the production of methane by reduction of carbon dioxide , with a very comparable standard reduction potential ( table 1 ) .
as follows from table 1 , given its standard potential methanogenesis may always be regarded as competitive to acetate production from a thermodynamic perspective , with methane either produced from h2 and co2 instead of acetate ( in case higher overpotentials are used ) , or produced acetate being consumed through the disproportionation reaction used in acetoclastic methanogenesis .
while the production of methane at biocathodes may form a target in itself , with applications in , for instance , biogas upgrading or the conversion of organic waste into natural gas [ 13,14 ] , the distinct uses and higher economical value of acetate make taking control over specificity in biocathodes with respect to production of both compounds worthwhile .
substantial scientific efforts to this end have been made using diverse methodologies [ 3,8,10,15,16,17 ] .
the findings are summarized in figure 1 , which depicts the possible mechanisms for production of both acetate and methane in mes , including references proposing these mechanisms .
for the production of acetate , two strategies to prevent methanogenesis may be distinguished : ( 1 ) pre - enrichment of inoculum or the use of pure cultures while working with aseptic conditions to prevent contamination of the systems with methanogens , thus effectively keeping out competitive microorganisms [ 17 ] ; and ( 2 ) chemical inhibition of methanogenesis [ 7 ] .
although these techniques have been shown successful to some extent , none of these practices alone provide a means for continuous , larger - scale and long - term septic reactor operation .
the use of pure cultures or enriched inocula is prone to contamination and use of chemical inhibitors is unattractive both from economical as well as environmental perspective .
additionally , methanogens may develop immunity towards the inhibiting compounds used , rendering them less effective over time [ 19 ] .
the need thus exists for a more integrated approach towards the selective and stable production of acetate , which takes into account ( 1 ) structural differences between microbial groups ; ( 2 ) differences in thermodynamics ; and ( 3 ) kinetics associated with the proposed pathways in figure 1 to affect product specificity .
based on these aspects , reactor operational parameters need to be found at which biomass retention time for acetogens is higher than for methanogens , and / or keeping growth rates ( and thus metabolic activity ) of acetogens higher than those of methanogens .
tangent to the considerations of fast kinetics and long acetogenic biomass retention is the question as to whether biocathodes are best operated using potentiostatic or galvanostatic control .
a constant potential may be set to narrow down the possibly involved electron transfer mechanisms ( figure 1 ) and may lead to the formation of a more energy efficient microbial community .
constant current , on the other hand , allows for better control over production rates and possibly selectivity as it is less sensitive or dependent on ( local ) changes in e.g. , ph , and the electron flux can be controlled to match stoichiometrically with the rate of co2 supply .
in this study , the performance of graphite felt electrodes was tested for the cathodic production of acetate using a mixed culture inoculum from ad sludge , using continuously operated reactors .
the effect of using both potentiostatic and galvanostatic control on reactor performance was analysed and compared. by using a mixed culture inoculum , the presence of both acetogens and methanogens was assured .
different cathode potentials were tested during potentiostatic experiments , and acetate production was compared to current controlled experiments , in which reducing equivalents were provided at constant rate .
results were interpreted to provide more insight into the mechanisms at play in biocathodes , and the consequential perspectives on future reactor optimization .
2. results 2.1 .
potential controlled experiments four cathode electrode potentials were selected based on thermodynamics , and this is further explained in the materials and methods section .
the three cells with the least negative cathode potential ( - 560 , - 630 and - 700 mv ) showed neither current nor acetate production during 34 days of operation .
for this reason , these experiments were then ended and their results are not further reported on here .
the fourth , most negative cathode potential ( - 900 mv ) showed increasing current during this period , and concomitantly measurable amounts of reduction products were produced .
the development throughout the experiment of current , acetate concentration and partial pressures of methane , carbon dioxide and hydrogen as measured in the headspace gas composition of this last cell are displayed in figure 2 .
as can be seen in figure 2a , during the first 47 days no reduction products other than methane were detected , with methane taking an increasingly large share in the headspace composition and reducing the partial pressure of co2 as measured in the headspace from 85 % initially to 5 % - 10 % by day 47 .
the cathodic current continued to increase steadily up to day 50 , at which point a fast decline in methane in the headspace was observed while the amount of hydrogen in the headspace increased dramatically .
directly following this shift in reduction products , the current continued to increase slightly until day 54 , accompanied by further decreasing methane partial pressure in the headspace .
at day 54 , after an initial drop in current density to approximately 7 a.m - 2 , an exponential growth in current started , with a resulting current of 350 ma ( 157 a.m - 2 projected surface area ) after 57 days .
at this point , the experiment was ended because the applied voltage increased above the maximum 10 v output of the potentiostat .
hydrogen had fully replaced the previously formed methane in the headspace and an acetate concentration of 270 mg.l - 1 was found in the electrolyte .
despite the low pressure of co2 remaining in the headspace at this point , the system was continuously fed with influent containing 11 mm total dissolved inorganic carbon ( dic ) .
this influent concentration provided sufficient carbon for the observed concentration of acetate in figure 2b : 270 mg.l - 1 acetic acid corresponds to 4.57 mm , and would thus require at least 9.15 mm dic. with no longer potential or current applied to the system , acetate concentrations roughly halved at day 60 , after which no more measurements were taken .
the increase in current production , followed by a decline in the production of methane , was interpreted as follows : first ( day 0 to 54 ) , with ph levels stable at ph 6.1 throughout operation of the reactor , a steady increase in production of both current and methane suggested the progressive growth of a ( presumably but not necessarily hydrogenotrophic ) methanogenic community .
during this period , the increase in current resulted from the increasing biological activity either by means of hydrogen - scavenging , or through the development of other , higher potential redox shuttling towards methane .
depletion of co2 started to hamper production of methane from day 47 onwards , resulting in a switch towards the net production of hydrogen which then became the dominant reduction product .
finally , the resulting elevated hydrogen partial pressure led to a production of acetate through homoacetogenesis , which until that point had been outcompeted by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis .
concomitantly with the onset of acetogenesis , current production entered an exponential phase ( day 54 to 57 ) .
to summarize , in the four potential controlled experiments , no reduction reactions occurred at potentials above or near the equilibrium potential for hydrogen formation .
therefore , although based on the limiting period of testing the possibility of reduction of co2 at low overpotential - - thus by more direct means - - cannot conclusively be excluded , it seems to be unfeasible .
only for the highest chosen overpotential was formation of methane and later hydrogen and acetate observed .
2.2 .
current controlled experiments the potential controlled experiments suggested hydrogen formation to be required for co2 reduction under the chosen reactor conditions .
moreover , with the observation of acetate production only established at higher current densities , the effect of current density was further investigated , controlling current at four different levels ( 1.3 , 2.6 , 5 and 11 a.m - 2 ) .
as can be seen in figure 3 , all current - controlled cells showed production of acetate directly after start - up. in addition to the formed acetate , hydrogen was also detected in the off - gas of the reactor , even at the lowest chosen current densities .
the production of acetate with all four current densities tested showed to be unstable , reaching peak levels after 5 - 13 days , followed by a decline .
during acetate peak production , coulombic efficiencies in all reactors ranged from 60 % to 100 % ( more detailed information can be found in figure s2 .
after 19 days , none of the reactors produced measurable amounts of acetate or hydrogen , and it was assumed current was fully diverted towards the production of methane , with headspace methane partial pressures ranging from 16 % for the lowest current to 55 % for the highest current tested .
at this point it should be remarked that the partial pressures reported do not directly relate to gas production .
the gas flow measurements therefore required were unfortunately lacking due to the continuous design of the reactors resulting in inaccurate measuring of produced gas flow .
judging from the available data , an increase in partial pressure certainly indicates increased production of a compound qualitatively .
however , an apparently stagnant or slightly changing partial pressure does not necessarily indicate unchanged production rates as small changes in partial pressure can already imply a large change in flux due to the large buffering capacity of co2 , and through increased losses through transmembrane transport .
continuous ph measurements showed rather constant levels throughout all tested current densities , and were not considered of relevance to the observed outcome ( data in figure s1 ) .
apart from reaching different peak production levels for acetate , the different currents tested showed variation in the time elapsed before peak acetate production occurred , with the highest current showing a later peak compared to lower currents .
for all cells tested , headspace analysis showed increasing methane partial pressures coinciding with declining acetate levels , suggesting the decrease in acetate production was due to increasing activity of methanogens .
the question then arises as to whether the observed decline in acetate production was due to competition of methanogens for hydrogen , or that - - requiring the establishment of acetate production first - - acetoclastic methanogenesis followed with a delay .
in an attempt to gain more insight regarding this question , the effect of spiking the cells with 10 mm of methanogen inhibitor 2 - bromoethanosulfonate ( 2 - bes ) , after acetate production was completely extinguished , was studied ( data provided in figure s3 ) .
this led to a sudden - - but temporary - - recovery of acetate production to similar levels of the earlier peak production , followed by a gradual decline as the inhibitor was depleted by wash - out .
the almost direct resumption of acetate production upon spiking with 2 - bes could indicate homoacetogens to remain active - - even with net production of acetate previously being extinguished - - implicating the establishment of a syntrophic interaction between homoacetogens and acetoclastic methanogens in these biocathodes .
however , the option of hydrogenotrophic methanogens being responsible for methane production could not be excluded .
in the latter , quick resumption of acetate production could be caused by resilient homoacetogens not washed out of the system .
thus , quantitative microbial community analysis would be required to be conclusive towards this point .
figure 4 shows the production of acetate in a third round of experiments , in which the highest current density of 11 a.m - 2 from the second experimental run was applied , but now with continuous addition of 2 - bes to the catholyte .
when 2 - bes was used in combination with this current controlled start - up , long - term stable production of acetate was achieved .
also , in these systems , after prolonged runtime , no visual change in electrolyte turbidity was observed , and measurements of suspended cod showed it to not substantially contribute to the electron balance , strongly suggesting the accumulation of biomass in the porous electrode .
moreover , gas production decreased below measurable fluxes as coulombic efficiencies towards acetate production increased over time to reach over 80 % .
the latter showed the ability of the developed biomass to efficiently capture ( or prevent the formation of ) h2 , and although hydrogen partial pressures remained around 40 % , they still showed a decreasing trend at the end of the experiment .
remarkable was the rapid increase in cathode potential for both cells from around - 1100 to - 800 mv in the first 10 days , followed by a steady to slightly increasing potential throughout the remaining runtime .
although hydrogen partial pressures still reached up to 40 % at day 40 , the observed increase in cathode potential could be explained by enhanced uptake of hydrogen by closely attached biofilm .
apart from hydrogen consumption by acetogenesis affecting product inhibition , the observed increase in cathode potential may also indicate some sort of catalysis , as was previously reported to occur by jourdin and co - workers [ 8 ] .
although the nature of this catalytic phenomenon could not be further elucidated using the current methodology , in their study , jourdin et al. ascribed the catalysed formation of hydrogen in their system ( followed by subsequent production of acetate in case 2 - bes is added ) to the intracellular biosynthesis of copper nanoparticles , possibly bymethanogens .
the reported presence of methanogens under total absence of methane production leads to the hypothesis that these archaea live at the expense of hydrogen catalysis , thus forming an intermediate step during bioelectrochemical acetogenesis rather than a competitive one .
applying this concept of microbe - enhanced hydrogen formation to our results , this would imply that under the conditions tested , an initially acetogen - dominated microbial community was complemented by electrode - bound hydrogen producers , possibly methanogens , which initially only directed part of the current to methane .
as the concentration of these bacteria increased , so did the capacity for methane formation , eventually resulting in the extinction of acetogenesis as less and less current was turned into hydrogen by the methanogens .
a schematic overview of these proposed dynamics , which would need community analysis or fluorescent in - situ hybridization ( fish ) assisted imaging to be confirmed , is depicted in figure 5 .
3. discussion a well - working acetate producing mes ( 1 ) has high product selectivity ; ( 2 ) has high stability / robustness against contamination and / or washout ; and ( 3 ) does not require costive and / or toxic additives ( e.g. , 2 - bes ) .
in addition , from an application perspective , attention should be paid to : ( 1 ) obtaining high product concentrations ; ( 2 ) high volume specific reaction rates , resulting in smaller reactor footprints ; and ( 3 ) high energy efficiency , producing the desired compound at the lowest energy expenses .
in the presented research , the effect of different electrochemical control modes on both start - up and steady - state characteristics was investigated .
here , the obtained results will be discussed in relation to abovementioned aspects / criteria .
3.1 .
current density as control parameter for mes selectivity towards acetate from the perspective of reaction specificity , methanogen abundance needs to be kept as low as possible .
to achieve this , reactor conditions should be so that in the steady state established , achieved specific growth rates for acetogenic organisms are as high as possible when compared to those of methanogens .
for the sake of brevity , in the discussion that follows no distinction is made between hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis followed by acetoclastic methanogenesis , as the overall reaction is identical for both .
in none of the experiments presented here in which no 2 - bes was added was a steady - state achieved in which measurable quantities of acetate were produced .
the experimental conditions were thus rendered ineffective in outcompeting methanogens sufficiently during steady state reactor operation .
however , during the current controlled experiments , acetate production was positively related to current density .
in potential controlled experiments , net acetate production only occurred when current increased rapidly , thus clearly not reflecting a steady state .
as was already stated in the introduction ( table 1 ) , from a thermodynamic perspective , methanogens can gain more energy than acetogens from the consumption of hydrogen and co2 .
figure 6a shows this thermodynamic advantage for methanogens is valid at any hydrogen pressure .
our observations however suggest that - - under the conditions chosen - - a kinetic difference exists between the acetogens and methanogens , both present in the used inoculum , resulting in a higher net growth rate for acetogens during start - up despite the higher thermodynamic available energy for methanogens .
although theoretically , an over - representation of acetogenic organisms in the used inoculum could have resulted in similar results without the requirement of higher growth rates for acetogens , the observations on the potentiostatic experiment with a prolonged period of methanogenic activity prior to acetogenesis strongly indicates this not being the case .
further supporting our hypothesis , differences in growth kinetics have been described previously for methanogens and acetogens using hydrogen as common electron donor [ 20,21 ] .
to allow comparison between thermodynamics and kinetics , figure 6a,b illustrates both the thermodynamic equilibria and biomass specific substrate consumption rates which result at different hydrogen pressures .
as substrate consumption is directly related to growth via yield , this shows homoacetogens thrive better than methanogens at higher hydrogen partial pressures , despite the higher potential energy gain available to methanogens .
as in our experiments the production of acetate was always accompanied by elevated hydrogen partial pressures , we presume electron transport from electrode to acetate to be primarily mediated through hydrogen .
as such , the relative growth rates of both methanogens and acetogens were directly affected by the hydrogen partial pressure , in turn resulting from the fluxes obtained by , on the one hand , production of hydrogen by the set current density and , on the other hand , its consumption by microbial activity .
at this point , little is known about the relationship between current density and local hydrogen partial pressures at the electrode , and this is likely to be specific for different electrode materials , depending on how accessible the material is to biofilm formation ( e.g. , hydrophobicity , roughness , decorated by functional groups etc. ) .
therefore , rather than predicting an optimal current density based on reported growth parameters , a more empirical approach towards optimization of current density with relation to biocathode selectivity will be required .
this is the case both when hydrogen shows an inevitable intermediate in biocathodic production of acetate - - as too high current density will result in loss of selectivity by evading hydrogen gas - - and in the case alternative mechanisms turn out to play a role in electron transfer from electrode to microbe .
the uptake of molecular hydrogen by both acetogens and methanogens is mediated by ferredoxin reducing hydrogenases [ 22,23 ] , a group of enzymes known to possess typically high turnover rates [ 24 ] .
given the mechanistic similarities and characteristics occurring at the start of both pathways [ 25,26 ] , the kinetic advantage of acetogens compared to methanogens at higher hydrogen pressures is probably due to a conversion further down the electron transfer chain ( etc ) of methanogens becoming rate limiting under these conditions .
in contrast , at low hydrogen pressures , the first electron step ( thus from hydrogen to the etcs initial electron acceptor ) in acetogens is likely to be thermodynamically controlled ( instead of kinetically ) .
the observation that the rate - limiting step for methane formation occurs further down the etc is of importance , as it makes it more likely that this limitation will remain in case of an alternative mechanism of electron transfer between cathode and microbe .
this would give the homoacetogens a competitive advantage over methanogens at higher current densities regardless of the exact nature of electron transfer between electrode and microbe .
therefore , we hypothesize current density to be a defining parameter for selectivity in acetate - producing mes .
at the same time it should be noted that in the presented data current densities were probably not high enough to establish long term stable production of acetate .
3.2 .
considerations on the effect of current density on overall reactor performance as previously stated , selectivity is not the only criterion defining reactor performance in mes , and it therefore holds relevance to further delineate the effects current density presumably has on product concentration , reaction rates and energy efficiency .
in terms of volume specific reaction rates , the application of high current densities is attractive as it drives acetogens close to their maximum turnover rates .
however , to sustain production at high current densities , high biomass densities will be required as well .
to achieve this , assuming that a biofilm forms on the electrode surface , it becomes crucial to use an electrode material with high specific surface area ( with pores accessible to microorganisms ) .
in case of biofilm formation , the solid / hydraulic retention time ratio ( srt / hrt ) can be tuned e.g. , by inducing various levels of sheer stress on the biofilm , for instance by recirculation at different flowrates , and an optimum with respect to process selectivity might be sought .
to this end , one has to bear in mind that a trade - off will show between biomass retention time and product selectivity , as also methanogens will be washed out slower and may win competition if conditions are suitable ( figure 6 ) .
inherent to higher current densities is also the occurrence of higher overpotential , and although the use of high specific surface area electrode materials may lower this , this will lead to lower voltage efficiency .
at the same time , higher current density presumably leads to higher coulombic efficiency towards acetate ( through improved selectivity ) .
thus , a compromise has to be found between selectivity and voltage efficiency to obtain optimal overall energy efficiency .
to summarize , we hypothesize that , in order for an acetate - producing cathode to perform well both in terms of product selectivity , production rate and obtained product concentrations , a high current density will have to be combined with a high specific surface area electrode , allowing a ( relatively ) high biomass density at a ( relatively ) low biomass retention time .
4. materials and methods 4.1 .
system design and reactor assembly experiments were conducted in electrochemical cells consisting of two plexiglass flow compartments , two flat plate electrodes and two plexiglass support plates as described previously [ 27 ] .
the assembly had an effective projected electrode surface area of 22 cm2 for both the cathode and anode and an effective cathode volume of 33 cm3 .
cathodes consisted of a stainless steel ( ss316 ) plate serving as current collector , with a plain sheet of graphite paper and five layers of graphite felt ( thickness 3 mm , fmi composites ltd. , biddeford , scotland , uk ) firmly held between current collector and membrane , thus with the felt serving as the actual electrode material in contact with the electrolyte .
anodes consisted of flat platinum / iridium coated titanium plates ( pt / iro2 80:20 , magneto special anodes bv , schiedam , the netherlands ) with the anode flow compartment filled with polypropylene spacer material sandwiched between the anode and membrane , ensuring proper flow distribution and providing support to the membrane .
an ag / agcl reference electrode ( model qm711x / gel , prosense , oosterhout , the netherlands ) was connected to the cathode using a haber - lugging capillary filled with saturated 3 m kcl (+ 0.205 v vs. nhe ) .
all potentials reported were measured relative to this reference .
the anode and the cathode compartments were separated by a cation exchange membrane ( ralex ( tm ) c ( m ) h - pes , vysocany , czech republic ) .
total catholyte recirculation volume was 180 ml , anolyte recirculation volume 120 ml. electrolytes were recirculated at a pump speed of 80 ml.min - 1 .
in - line ph / temperature monitoring was performed on the catholyte ( endress + hauser , sensor model cp571d - 7bv21 connected to a liquiline datalogger ) .
temperature of reactors was maintained constant at 32 +/ - 1 degreesc using climate control of the research cabinet , and systems were shielded from light to avoid the possibility of photoautotrophic activities during the experiments .
an ivium n - stat multichannel dc potentiostat ( eindhoven , the netherlands ) was used in a three - electrode configuration ( working , counter , and reference ) to perform electrochemical measurements and experiments .
recording and analysis of potentiostat data was carried out using the iviumstat software ( iviumsoft 2.693 , ivium , eindhoven , the netherlands ) .
4.2 .
electrolyte composition catholyte was made using milliq water containing 0.4 g.l - 1 nh4hco3 , 0.05 g.l - 1 ca ( oh ) 2 , 0.1 g.l - 1 mgso4.7h2o , 0.87 g.l - 1 k2hpo4 , 0.68 g.l - 1 kh2po4 , 1 ml.l - 1 of vitamin solution [ 3 ] and 1 ml.l - 1 of trace metal solution [ 28 ] .
in order to ensure anaerobic conditions and high concentrations of co2 in the influent , the medium was continuously purged with co2 prior to injection .
using this practice , a total inorganic carbon concentration ( tic ) of 11 mm was dissolved in the catholyte , buffering the ph of the catholyte at 5.5 .
in later current controlled experiments , the sodium salt of the methanogen inhibitor 2 - bromoethanosulfonate ( 2 - bes ) was added in order to suppress methanogenic activities at a concentration of 2.1 g.l - 1 .
anolyte consisted of a 10 mm phosphate buffer adjusted to ph 7 before use .
anolytes were sparged continuously with co2 to remove any formed oxygen throughout the experiments while preventing cross - membrane co2 stripping .
4.3 .
inoculum a mixture of activated sludge from an anaerobic digester and cow manure was used as a source of microorganisms .
homogenized activated sludge and cow manure were centrifuged separately for 5 min at 3700 rpm and supernatant from both solutions were mixed in a 2:1 ratio , resulting in the final inoculum with a cod of 12.5 g.l - 1 .
upon inoculation , each cell was injected with 10 ml of inoculum leading to an initial cod of 0.7 g.l - 1 in the catholyte at the start of biotic experiments .
4.4 .
hydraulic and electrochemical operational conditions systems were filled and continuously fed with fresh electrolyte giving an hrt of 40 h ( potentiostatic experiments ) or 20 h ( current controlled experiments ) .
prior to inoculation , potentials / currents were applied for at least 2 days until potentials / currents stabilized , thus serving as baseline .
in the first run , four cells were poised each at a different potential .
based on the equilibrium potentials for formation of hydrogen and acetate from co2 , the following four potentials were chosen : the first was - 560 mv ; the standard equilibrium potential of direct carbon dioxide reduction into acetate is - 490 mv. the first setup aimed at facilitating this reaction by imposing only a small overpotential of 70 mv. doing so , the formation of hydrogen gas is thermodynamically unfeasible and alternative electron transfer is therefore required .
this may imply direct electron transfer , providing no other electron mediators are present in the system .
the second potential was - 630 mv ; selected based on the same rationale as for setup 1 , but with a slightly increased overpotential .
the third potential was - 700 mv ; at this potential , hydrogen formation in theory becomes feasible but due to large overpotentials associated with hydrogen formation a catalyst would be required .
the fourth potential was - 900 mv ; well below the equilibrium potential for hydrogen formation in these systems , a small cathodic current of 2 - 4 ma was observed during the abiotic operation of the system , providing sufficient reductants at start .
during the potential controlled experiments , systems were put in batch mode by stopping influent pumps directly after inoculation for 72 h to prevent washout .
after this initial batch phase , influents were resumed at the set hrt of 40 h. during the current controlled experiments all cells were set to an hrt of 20 h , thereby allowing a fixed and equal flux of co2 to all cathodes .
hrt was maintained also directly after inoculation , as preliminary results showed good retention of biomass in the graphite felt even after prolonged periods of inactivity and continuous flushing .
4.5 .
analytical techniques liquid and head space samples ( 1 ml ) were taken from catholytes , once a week or more frequently when observed changes in currents / potentials or gas fluxes justified this .
occasionally , the anolyte was sampled for its ionic composition to assess crossover rates of ions .
tic / toc measurements were done by using a shimadzu tic / toc analyser ( kyoto , japan ) ; model toc - vcph in combination with shimadzu asi - v autosampler ( kyoto , japan ) .
gas samples were taken from the headspace in the cathode chamber and analysed for h2 , co2 , ch4 and o2 using a gas chromatograph ( varian cp - 4900 microgc , tcd detector , mol sieve 5a plot and poraplot u columns in parallel , santa clara , california , usa ) .
the catholyte cod was determined using a spectrophotometer hach xion 500 ( hach , loveland , co , usa ) with test kit ( no. 414 , hach - lange , tiel , the netherlands ) .
for obtaining estimates on biomass concentrations , the cod of both unfiltered and filtered ( 0.45 microm ) electrolytes were compared .
hplc analyses for detection of organic acids ( formic acid , acetic acid , propionic acid and butyric acid ) were performed with a dionex uhplc system ( waltham , ma , usa ) .
4.6 .
performance calculations with acetate being the target product , coulombic efficiency ( ce ) expresses the fraction of the electron flow ( which is dictated by the current ) which is used to form acetate : ce = nfphideltacac - i where f is faraday 's constant ( 96,485 c.mol - 1 ) , deltacac - is the difference in acetate concentration in the effluent ( mol.l - 1 ) as compared with the influent , phi is the total volumetric flow of influent ( l.s - 1 ) , n is the number of electrons consumed per mol acetate produced ( 8 ) , and i ( a ) is the steady state electrical current .
5. conclusions we propose current density as a most promising operational parameter for optimizing acetate producing biocathodes .
future experimental efforts should be directed towards a more quantitative investigation of current density and its relation to reactor performance .
therefore , in our opinion , acetate - producing cathodes may be better controlled at a set current , rather than at a controlled potential .
the here presented data shows that start - up strategy is important for reactor performance in acetate producing cathodes .
within the experimental periods tested , controlled current showed to be more successful than controlled potential in establishing the production of acetate by reduction of co2 , although it should be noted that with the current densities tested , no long - term stable acetate production was established .
we therefore propose to test higher current densities in future experiments .
closely related to current density , a primary role is foreseen regarding the used electrode materials , as it forms the most important design variable in a biocathode and determines to a large extent - - amongst other aspects - - biomass attachment / retention specifics and electrode specific surface area .
we argue that by optimizing reactor control by these means , neither extensive pre - enrichment of biota nor selective inhibition of methanogenesis by means of 2 - bes is required to obtain selective acetate production at high reaction rates and concentrations in the future .

1980 124 1 11 10.1007 / bf00407022 6769415 figure 1 different metabolic pathways in a mixed - culture biocathode as proposed in different studies .
a distinction can be made between direct electron transfer [ 18 ] , in which microbes are directly attached to the electrode surface , thus allowing electrons to reach the intracellular environment by means of electrical conductance , and the use of a redox active chemical mediator ( mox / mred ) in the case of indirect electron transfer .
several studies have suggested a combination , in which direct electron transfer leads to the biocatalysed reduction of a mediator compound , which then functions as electron donor for suspended cultures [ 7,8 ] .
regardless of whether initial electron transfer takes place directly or indirectly , close competition between methanogens ( brown ) and acetogens ( green ) will exist for available electrons .
regarding the composition of a possible mediator , although in theory any kind of mediator could be shuttling electrons back and forth between electrode and microbe as long as its reversible redox potential is adequate , in practice this role is most likely fulfilled by hydrogen , although formate has been hypothesized to play a role as secondary mediator as well [ 1 ] .
any formed acetate can be further oxidized acetoclastically to form co2 and methane ( blue microbe ) .
the red - circled numbers refer to the potential levels tested in this study , aimed at establishing indicated pathways and are further defined in the materials and methods section .
figure 2 ( a ) current plot of the - 900 mv vs. ag / agcl controlled biocathode throughout 57 days of operation ; ( b ) headspace composition throughout the experiments showed gradually increasing methane partial pressures , accompanied by decreasing levels of carbon dioxide .
in the last phase of the experiment , hydrogen replaced all other gases and subsequently acetate formation took place .
figure 3 results obtained from four biocathodes controlled at different current densities ( 3 , 6 , 12 and 24 ma corresponding to 1.3 , 2.6 , 5 and 11 a.m - 2 , respectively ) : ( a ) observed acetate production rates as calculated from effluent concentration measurements show a clear effect of current density ; while ( b ) methane partial pressures ; and ( c ) hydrogen partial pressures as measured by head space gas analysis indicate progressive loss of electrons to methane as hydrogen partial pressure decreases .
figure 4 results obtained in duplicate current controlled cathodes operated at 24 ma ( 11 a.m - 2 ) containing 10 mm of 2 - bromoethanosulfonate ( 2 - bes ) in the electrolyte ; ( a ) acetate production steadily increased throughout the experimental run of 60 days , reaching nearly 4 kg.m - 3.day - 1 at a coulombic efficiency of 80 % at the end of the experiment ; ( b ) the development of cathode potential over time displayed a steep increase at first , followed by a more stable operation around - 800 mv ; ( c ) starting at measurable fluxes , gas production gradually decreased for both cells - - as an increasing share of current was directed towards production of acetate - - and reached the detection limit by the end of the experiment .
figure 5 proposed mechanisms as occurred under tested conditions .
red circles represent methanogenic , and green circles acetogenic bacteria .
( a ) based on the short start - up required for acetogenesis during current controlled experiments , it is likely that electron transfer during this phase does not require the establishment of a biofilm on the electrode , but is mediated by abiotically formed hydrogen ; ( b ) the gradual shift towards production of methane observed during the later phase may be caused by the establishment of a methanogenic biofilm on the electrode , which at that point outcompetes the acetogenic community for the available substrate , rendering the acetogens effectless ; ( c ) upon addition of 2 - bes , the methanogenic biofilm redirects electrons to form hydrogen and the produced hydrogen is consecutively used by acetogens to produce acetate ; ( d ) in the case of co2 depletion , all electrons are shuttled to the production of hydrogen [ 8 ] .
figure 6 shows the effect of variable hydrogen pressures on the competition between acetogens and methanogens both in terms of ( a ) gibbs free energy of reaction [ 12 ] ; and ( b ) biomass specific substrate consumption rate ( monod parameters for modelling growth were taken from reported values in kotsyurbenko et al. [ 21 ]) .
as can be seen , methanogens have a thermodynamic advantage over homoacetogens throughout the whole domain .
this thermodynamic advantage is reflected in the growth curves through the hydrogen affinity ( ks ) for methanogens in general being lower than for acetogens .
however , acetogenesis achieves higher conversion rates at higher hydrogen partial pressures ( micromax ) compared to methanogenesis , rendering hydrogen pressure an essential parameter to steer competition between acetogens and methanogens [ 21 ] .

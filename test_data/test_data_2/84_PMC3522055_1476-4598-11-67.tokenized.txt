background coronins are a family of highly evolutionary conserved proteins reportedly involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics , although only coronin 3 has been shown to be related to cancer cell migration .
in glioblastoma cells , the knockdown of coronin 3 inhibits cell proliferation and invasion .
coronin 3 is also associated with the aggression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma .
in this paper , we analyze the migration , invasion and metastasis abilities of gastric cancer cells after up - or down - regulation of coronin 3 , and explore the mechanism of coronin 3 in the process of gastric cancer metastasis .
results the expression of coronin 3 was higher in the highly metastatic sub - cell line mkn28 - m , which we established in our laboratory .
we also demonstrated that the expression of coronin 3 was remarkably higher in lymph lode metastases than in primary gastric cancer tissues , and over - expression of coronin 3 was correlated with the increased clinical stage and lymph lode metastasis .
recombinant lentiviral vectors encoding shrnas were designed to down - regulate coronin 3 expression in gastric cancer cell lines .
stable knockdown of coronin 3 by this lentiviral vector could efficiently inhibit the migration and invasion of mkn45 gastric cancer cells .
in contrast , up - regulation of coronin 3 significantly enhanced migration and invasion of mkn28 - nm cells .
in addition , knockdown of coronin 3 significantly reduced liver metastasis in mice after tail vein injection of gastric cancer cells .
the human tumor metastasis pcr array was used to screen the metastasis - associated genes identified by the down - regulation of coronin 3 , and the results suggested that , following the knockdown of coronin 3 , the tumor cell migration and invasion were inhibited by the reduced expression of mmp - 9 and cathepsin k. conclusion coronin 3 is highly expressed in gastric cancer metastases and can promote the metastatic behaviors of gastric cancer cells , including their migration and invasion .
coronin 3 gastric cancer metastasis mmp - 9 cathepsin k background cancer is characterized by proliferation , invasion , and metastasis , and more than 90 % of mortalities are caused by metastases [ 1 ] .
the first steps of metastasis include cancer cell adhesion , degradation of the ecm , and permeation of the basement membrane [ 2 ] .
in most cases , cancer cell invasion during this process is dependent on the dynamic re - organization of the actin cytoskeleton , the dysfunction of cell adhesion , and the formation of invadopodia .
invadopodia are actin - rich membrane protrusions that are formed by invasive cancer cells , and they have a matrix - degradation activity that requires the polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments [ 3 ] .
for decades , the molecules and mechanisms involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton have been an area of intense study [ 4 ] .
there are a large variety of actin nucleators in human cells , such as the arp2 / 3 complex , n - wasp , cortactin , cofilin , and coronins [ 5,6 ] .
studies evaluating the roles of the actin nucleation factors involved in cancer cell function may ultimately provide new treatments for invasive and metastatic cancers [ 7 ] .
coronins are highly conserved regulators of the actin cytoskeleton , and their structure and biological function have recently been described in detail [ 6 ] .
coronins bind f - actin as well as the arp2 / 3 complex and are involved in inhibiting actin dynamics .
coronin 3 is a type i coronin protein with a calculated molecular mass of 53 kda and is part of a conserved family of wd - repeat - containing , actin - binding proteins [ 8 ] .
similar to coronin1a and coronin1b , coronin 3 interacts with arp2 / 3 and plays a negative role in actin polymerization .
additionally , recent studies have demonstrated that this protein participates in the metastatic behavior of many malignancies , such as diffuse glioma and primary effusion lymphoma [ 9,10 ] .
coronin 3 is also a novel biomarker for the invasive progression of hepatocellular carcinoma [ 11 ] .
the present study conducted a more extensive investigation of the distribution of coronin 3 within gastric cancer tissues and related lymph lode metastases and demonstrated the potential of coronin 3 for use as a biomarker of cancer metastasis .
the knockdown of coronin 3 expression in the mkn45 gastric cancer cell lines clearly decreased the migratory and invasion capabilities of these cells , while up - regulation of coronin 3 significantly enhanced migration and invasion of mkn28 - nm cells .
in addition , a tail vein metastasis assay showed that knockdown of coronin 3 significantly reduced liver metastasis of gastric cancer cells .
the human tumor metastasis pcr array was then used to screen the metastasis - associated genes identified following the down - regulation of coronin 3 , and this experiment revealed that nine of the 84 genes were down - regulated , whereas only 2 genes were up - regulated .
furthermore , we confirmed that the expression of mmp - 9 and cathepsin k was positively correlated with the expression of coronin 3 .
in conclusion , these results suggest that coronin 3 may promote the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer both in vitro and in vivo by regulating the expression of mmp - 9 and cathepsin k. results coronin 3 expression is up - regulated in highly metastatic gastric cancers coronin 3 expression was examined in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines by first comparing coronin 3 expression in primary gastric cancer tissues and the related lymph lodes .
a tissue array containing 40 gastric cancer and related metastatic lymph lode tissues was purchased from aomei , china , and another 12 pairs of tissue samples were obtained from archives of department of pathology in xijing hospital between 2010 and 2011 .
the immunohistochemical results showed that coronin 3 was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm of gastric cancer cells ( figure 1a ) .
as shown in table 1 , ten primary gastric cancer tissue samples ( 19.2 %) showed negative staining ( 0 ) , whereas the staining in 17 ( 32.6 %) , 19 ( 36.5 %) , and 8 ( 15.3 %) samples was scored as weakly positive ( i ) , moderately positive ( ii ) , and strongly positive ( iii ) , respectively .
for the related metastatic lymph lode tissues , the staining from 5 ( 9.6 %) , 7 ( 13.4 %) , 22 ( 42.3 %) , and 18 ( 34.6 %) of the samples was scored as negative ( 0 ) , weakly positive ( i ) , moderately positive ( ii ) , and strongly positive ( iii ) , respectively .
therefore , coronin 3 expression was significantly higher in the metastatic lymph lode samples than in the primary cancer tissue samples ( p = 0.03 ) .

beta - actin was used as the internal control .
the level of coronin 3 protein expression was significantly higher in the highly invasive mkn28 - m cell subline than in the less invasive cell subline mkn28 - nm. the level of coronin 3 mrna expression was consistent with that of coronin 3 protein expression .

the relationship between coronin 3 expression and clinicopathological parameters was analyzed .
coronin 3 expression in 152 gastric cancer tissue spots were detected by immunohistochemistry .
four spots were excluded because all fields were no cancer tissues but only fibrous or inflammatory tissues .
as shown table 2 , over - expression of coronin 3 was correlated with the increased clinical stage ( p = 0.001 ) and lymph lode metastasis ( p < 0.001 ) , but not statistically related to cancer differentiation , or patients' gender and age .

* , p < 0.05 .
as shown in figure 1b , coronin 3 expression was significantly elevated in sgc7901 , ags , katoiii , and mkn45 cells , particularly in the highly invasive mkn28 - m cell subline .
this result was consistent with the mrna expression levels from the qpcr analysis and suggested that the expression of coronin 3 is correlated with gastric cancer invasion .
coronin 3 is expressed in the cytoplasm of gastric cancer cells as shown in figure 2 , the subcellular localization of coronin 3 in the sgc7901 and mkn45 gastric cancer cell lines was detected using a laser scanning confocal microscope .
coronin 3 expression was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and surrounding the nucleus , and this finding is consistent with that of a previous study [ 12 ] .
figure 2 coronin 3 was primarily localized in the cytoplasm of the mkn45 ( a ) and sgc7901 ( b ) cells ( localization is marked by arrowheads ) .
coronin 3 promoted the migratory , invasive , and in vivo metastatic abilities of gastric cancer cells to determine the role of coronin 3 expression in the malignant behavior of gastric cancer cells , a lentivirus containing an shrna construct ( shrna - lv ) was constructed to down - regulate coronin 3 expression in mkn45 cells , and pcdna3.1 - coronin 3 was transfected to mkn28 - nm cells to up - regulate coronin 3 expression .
the mrna and protein levels were determined by qpcr and western blotting after infection or transfection .
as shown in figure 3a and 3b , coronin 3 expression was clearly down - regulated and had decreased by more than 85 % in the mkn45 cells , and up - regulated by more than 60 % in the mkn28 - nm cells .
this coronin 3 down - regulation or up - regulation showed no effect on the gastric cancer cell growth , and there were no differences between the mkn45 - shrna - lv or mkn28 - coronin 3 cells and the control cells regarding levels of apoptosis or cell cycle progression , as assessed by flow cytometry ( data not shown ) .
we next evaluated the effect of coronin 3 expression on the invasive and migratory abilities of gastric cancer cells using an in vitro wound - healing assay and invasion assay .
as shown in figure 3c and 3d , the down - regulation of coronin 3 resulted in the marked inhibition of the migration abilities of mkn45 cells .
similar results were observed in the in vitro invasion assay .
in contrast , up - regulation of coronin 3 significantly enhanced migration and invasion of mkn28 - nm cells .
in addition , a tail vein metastasis assay was used to examine the effects of coronin 3 down - regulation on the in vivo metastasis of mkn45 cells .
mkn45 - shrna - lv , or control cells ( 1 x 106 ) were injected into the tail veins of scid mice .
the extent of the metastatic tumors on the surface of the liver was significantly reduced in mice that received treated cells compared to those that received control cells ( figure 4 , p < 0.05 ) .
thus , the results of both the in vitro and in vivo assays suggest that coronin 3 plays a significant role in gastric cancer metastasis .
figure 3 the effects of coronin 3 on the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells .
the representative results of three similar experiments are shown .
a and b. the mkn45 cells were infected with shrna - lv , and the mkn28 - nm cells were stably transfected with pcdna3.1 - coronin 3 .
the protein and mrna expression of coronin 3 were then evaluated by western blotting and qpcr .
beta - actin was used as the internal control .
the mock samples were treated with scrambled shrna - lv or the pcdna3.1 vector. c. the migratory ability of the cells was evaluated with a wound - healing assay .
the wound widths were measured at time 0 and 24 h after wounding , and the closure ratio was calculated in accordance with the following formula : wound closure (%) = ( width 0 h ) - width 24 h ) / width 0 h .
* p < 0.05 .
these results were then compared to those of the control cells. d. the invasive ability was evaluated by counting the number of cells that had invaded the matrigel and the 8 - mum - pore transwell membrane .
* , p < 0.05 , compared to the cells infected with scrambled shrna - lv or transfected with the pcdna3.1 vector .
figure 4 mice were tail vein - injected with 1x106 mkn45 cells infected with shrna - lv or the control vector .
each group contained 10 mice .
the mice were sacrificed four weeks later , and the number of visible tumors in the liver was counted without magnification .
the liver tissues were sectioned serially and then stained with h & e .
* , p < 0.01 .
liver metastases were marked by arrowheads .
figure 5 the effect of coronin 3 expression on several proteolytic enzymes in gastric cancer cells .
the expression of timp - 2 , mmp - 9 , and cathepsin k in gastric cancer cells was evaluated by western blotting .
beta - actin was used as the internal control .
the levels of timp - 2 , mmp - 9 , and cathepsin k protein in the mkn45 - shrna - lv and mkn28 - pcdna3.1 - coronin 3 cells were significantly different from those in the empty vector - transfected cells ( p < 0.05 ) .
real - time pcr array analysis of coronin 3 - regulated metastasis - related gene expression profiles numerous molecules are involved in the migration and invasion of gastric cancers .
in this study , we compared the gene expression patterns of cells following the down - regulation of coronin 3 with those of untreated control cells .
total mrna from mkn45 - shrna - lv cells and controls was harvested and subsequently screened against a library of 84 metastasis - related genes .
genes with more than a twofold increase or decrease in expression were considered significantly regulated by coronin 3 .
nine of the 84 genes were down - regulated , whereas only 2 genes were up - regulated ( table 3 ) .
however , only 2 of these genes , mmp - 9 and ctsk ( cathepsin k ) , were verified by the results of the qpcr , and western blotting .
table 3 mrna expression of metastasis - related genes after down - regulation of coronin 3 gene name description fold up - or down - regulation cdh11 cadherin 11 , type 2 , ob - cadherin ( osteoblast ) - 2.59 cdh6 cadherin 6 , type 2 , k - cadherin ( fetal kidney ) - 6.62 ctsk cathepsin k - 11.78 ctsl1 cathepsin l1 12.08 cxcl12 chemokine ( c - x - c motif ) ligand 12 2.08 cxcr2 chemokine ( c - x - c motif ) receptor 2 - 3.08 itga7 integrin , alpha 7 - 3.53 mmp9 matrix metallopeptidase 9 - 2.03 smad4 smad family member 4 - 2.06 timp3 timp metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 - 7.16 vegfa vascular endothelial growth factor a - 3.19 proteases are known to play causal roles in the malignant progression of human tumors [ 13 ] .
the initial step of the metastatic process involves the degradation of the basement membrane and extracellular matrix ( ecm ) by various types of proteases , such as mmps , timps , and serine and cysteine proteases [ 14,15 ] .
therefore , we examined the effect of coronin 3 knockdown or up - regulation on the expression of mmp - 9 , cathepsin k ( based on the results of the pcr array ) , mmp - 2 , timp - 1 and timp - 2 in gastric cancer after infection .
these data confirmed that the expression of mmp - 9 and cathepsin k was down - regulated due to the coronin 3 knockdown in the mkn45 cells and up - regulated when mkn28 - nm cells were transfected with pcdna3.1 - coronin 3 .
the result of timp - 2 was on the contrary .
however , the expression of timp - 1 was not altered due to coronin 3 knockdown .
for these experiments , the beta - actin expression level was used as an internal control ( n ) .
taken together , these results suggest that mmp - 9 , timp - 2 and cathepsin k at least partially contribute to coronin 3 - mediated gastric cancer metastasis .
discussion cancer metastasis is the main cause of all cancer - related deaths [ 16 ] .
metastasis is a multistep process that is referred to as the invasion - metastasis cascade , and the first critical step of this process is the invasion of primary cancer cells into the surrounding ecm and stromal cell layers [ 17 ] .
reassembly of the actin cell skeleton , aberrant cell - cell contact , and protrusion formation are indispensable components of this step of metastasis for almost all epithelial cancers [ 18 ] .
many regulatory proteins are required for cell migration and possess actin polymerization - and depolymerization - regulating effects. of these effects , the actin - related protein ( arp ) 2 / 3 complex plays a vital role in actin polymerization and its regulation [ 19 ] .
several nucleating promoting factors ( npf ) , particularly n - wasp , activate the arp2 / 3 complex and then initiate the formation of angular actin filament branches on the sides of preexisting filaments [ 20 ] .
in contrast , the coronin family can bind to and inhibit arp2 / 3 complex activity .
cai et al. reported that coronins can limit arp2 / 3 - dependent actin branching by inhibiting arp2 / 3 docking or by facilitating debranching .
moreover , this function is antagonized by cortactin , which is an additional factor that can bind to the arp2 / 3 complex and synergistically activate the complex [ 21,22 ] .
together , the interaction of npfs and coronins with the arp2 / 3 complex coordinates actin polymerization and depolymerization to mediate cell migration and invasion .
coronin 3 has a structure similar to that of other coronins and can bind to arp2 / 3 and f - actin , although the functional significance of this interaction remains unclear [ 23 ] .
however , coronin 3 is the only member of this family that has been associated with the metastasis of neoplasms , such as diffuse glioma , primary effusion lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinoma [ 24 - 26 ] .
in this study , we first examined the expression of coronin 3 in primary gastric cancer tissues and lymph lode metastases .
these results demonstrated that coronin 3 was more highly expressed in lymph lode metastases as compared to primary tissues , and this expression was also greater in mkn28 - m cells compared to mkn28 - nm cells .
these data suggest that elevated expression of coronin 3 is associated with the high metastatic potential of gastric cancers and that coronin 3 may participate in the process of invasion and metastasis to play a positive role in the metastasis of gastric cancer .
to confirm this hypothesis by immunohistochemistry and western blotting , we observed the migration and invasion ability of gastric cancer cell lines after knocking down or up - regulating the expression of coronin 3 with a shrna - lv vector or pcdna3.1 - coronin 3 , respectively .
these experiments demonstrated that coronin 3 could significantly promote the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer cells .
in addition , we explored the mechanism behind the association between coronin 3 and gastric cancer metastasis and identified downstream effectors contributing to this process .
we used the human tumor metastasis pcr array to confirm that two proteases ( mmp - 9 and cathepsin k ) were responsible for coronin 3 - related metastasis .
invadopodia formation and ecm degradation have been shown to be associated with cell invasion , and for these processes , certain proteases that are responsible for ecm degradation are also regulated by proteins that participate in actin reassembly , such as members of the wasp / wave family and cortactin [ 27 - 29 ] .
in addition , mmps may be required for the initial steps of invadopodia formation [ 30 ] .
in our study , we found that the expression of mmp - 9 and cathepsin k showed significant positive correlation with coronin 3 expression , whereas timp - 2 expression shows the opposite results. k. sossey - alaoui et al .
[ 31 ] reported that wasp / wave family ( a kind of npf ) could regulate of mmps expression and activity via the p38 pathway .
as described above , coronins family interact with npf and other actin polymerization - and depolymerization - regulating protein .
therefore , coronin 3 may regulate protease expression via mapk pathway , which needs further exploration .
conclusion in the present study , we have provided clear evidence that coronin 3 is highly expressed in metastatic gastric cancer tissues and that coronin 3 can promote gastric cancer metastasis , at least in part by up - regulating cathepsin k and mmp9 expression and down - regulating timp2 expression .
methods cell lines and gastric cancer tissues the sgc7901 , ags , katoiii , mkn - 45 , and mkn - 28 human gastric cancer cell lines were maintained in our laboratory .
additionally , sublines with a low ( mkn28 - nm ) and high degree of invasiveness ( mkn28 - m ) were derived from the mkn28 parental cell line by our laboratory [ 32 ] .
all of the cell lines were grown in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( fbs ) and incubated at 37degreesc with 5 % co2 in a humidified incubator .
twelve gastric cancer tissues and lymph lode metastases were obtained from archives of department of pathology in xijing hospital between 2010 and 2011 .
human ethics approval was duly obtained from the xijing hospital .
tissue array commercially available adult human cancer tissues and lymph lode metastases , in the form of formalin - fixed microarrays , were obtained from aomei ( aomei biotechnology co. ltd. , xi'an , china ) .
one cancer tissue array ( am01c09 ) contained 80 spots , with 40 gastric adenocarcinoma spots and 40 matched lymph lode metastases spots from 40 patients ( aged 24 - 74 years , 1.5 - mm diameter per spot ) .
another tissue array ( am01c04 ) contained 152 gastric cancer spots from 152 patients ( aged 17 - 84 years , 1mm diameter per spot ) , and the patients' gender , age , and clinicopathological parameters were provided by the manufacturer .
immunohistochemistry the coronin 3 immunostaining was performed on all of the tissues using the standard avidin - biotin peroxidase staining technique .
briefly , the paraffin - embedded tissues were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in alcohol and were then incubated in 3 % h2o2 for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity .
the samples were then incubated with normal goat serum ( zhong shan bio , china ) for 30 min at room temperature .
subsequently , a mouse monoclonal antibody against coronin 3 ( 1:100 dilution ) ( abcam , usa. ) was applied to the tissue array and incubated overnight at 4degreesc , and preimmune sera were used instead of primary antibodies for the negative control samples .
sp kits ( zhongshan bio ) were used according to the manufacturer 's instructions for detection .
the peroxidase activity was visualized with the addition of dab solution , and the samples were then counterstained with hematoxylin .
all tissues or spots were scored by two independent observers in a blinded fashion , and the observers did not have prior knowledge of the clinicopathological details of the samples .
the coronin 3 expression was evaluated according to the fraction of positive cells per specimen and the staining intensity , which was evaluated using the following histological scoring method as previously described [ 33 ] .
the fraction of positive cells per specimen was quantitatively evaluated and assigned a score of 0 for 0 % staining of the cells examined , a score of 1 for 0.01 - 25 % staining , a score of 2 for 25.01 - 50 % staining , a score of 3 for 50.01 - 75 % staining , or score of 4 for greater than 75 % staining .
the intensity was graded as follows : 0 , no signal ; 1 , weak signal ; 2 , moderate staining signal ; and 3 , strong staining .
the histological score for coronin 3 expression in each spot was computed using the following formula : histological score = ratio score x intensity score .
a total score , ranging from 0 - 12 , was determined and graded as either negative ( 0 , score = 0 - 1 ) , weak ( i , score = 2 - 4 ) , moderate ( ii , score = 5 - 8 ) , or strong ( iii , score = 9 - 12 ) for use in further nonparametric tests .

the cover slips were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min and blocked in blocking solution ( beyotime , china ) for 1 hour .
the cover slips were incubated with mouse anti - coronin 3 monoclonal antibody ( 1:100 dilution ) overnight at 4degreesc , and then incubated with fitc - conjugated affinipure donkey anti - mouse igg ( 1:200 ; red fluorescence , jackson immunoresearch laboratories , inc. ) as the secondary antibody for 1.5 h at room temperature .
then , dapi ( beyotime ) was applied for 5 min to stain the nucleus .
the cover slips were mounted and detected under laser scanning confocal microscope ( fv1000 , olympus ) .
transfection and lentiviral transduction of shrna vectors the pcdna3.1 - coronin 3 construct was a gift from prof. cs clemen at the institute of biochemistry i of medical faculty at the university of cologne , germany .
the mkn28 - nm cells were plated in six - well plates and cultured in rpmi1640 supplemented with 10 % fbs .
at 90 % confluence , the cells were transfected with pcdna3.1 - coronin 3 or a pcdna3.1 empty vector ( mock ) using lipofectaminetm 2000 ( invitrogen , usa ) .
the expression level of coronin 3 was evaluated by western blot analysis .
the shrna - oligo 5 ' - cgu cca cua ccu caa cac auu - 3 '[ 10 ] was used to down - regulate the expression of human coronin 3 ( genebank , gi : nm _ 014325 ) .
the scrambled shrna sequence served as the negative control .
the oligo shrna and negative control sequences were subcloned into pgcsil - gfp , and shrna plasmids were co - transfected with lentiviral packaging plasmids .
the resulting lentivirus and negative control were then infected into the mkn45 cell lines , according to the manufacturer 's protocol ( genechem , shanghai , china ) .
the infected cells were sorted by flow cytometry based on green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) expression .
wound - healing assay for wound - healing assays , 2 x 106 cells were seeded into the 60 - mm - diameter dishes .
draw a line across the center of the plate with plastic pipette tip to produce a sharp 1 - mm - wide wound area after the cells have reached confluency .
after 48 h culturing in medium with 1 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) , cell movement into the wound area was examined using a phase - contrast microscope .
cell invasion assay the cell invasion assays were performed ( as previously described [ 36 ]) using transwell plates ( 8 mum pore size , corning costar corp. ) .

the polycarbonate membrane was rinsed with pbs , the inserts were plated into the wells , and 500 mul of rpmi - 1640 containing 10 % fbs was added to the lower chamber .
one hundred microliters of a freshly prepared mkn28 - nm or mkn45 cell suspension ( at 5 x 105 cells / ml ) in rpmi - 1640 containing 1 % fbs was then added to the upper chamber .
the cells were incubated for 36 h at 37degreesc in a 5 % co2 humidified incubator and would invade to the lower chamber .
after incubation , cells were scraped from the upper surface of the membrane with a cotton swab. and the invaded cells on the bottom surface were fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet .
the invasive capability was determined by the number of penetrating cells under a microscope on 10 random fields in each well .
tail vein metastatic assay the tail vein metastatic assay was analyzed as previously described [ 36 ] .
nude mice were handled using best humane practices and were cared for in accordance with nih animal care and use committee guidelines .
cells were harvested using trypsin and washed twice with pbs .
one hundred microliter pbs containing 1 x 106 cells were injected through tail vein , after which the overall health condition and body weight of the mice were monitored .
four weeks after the injection , the mice were sacrificed and the liver tissues were isolated .
after counting the number of visible tumors on liver surface , the liver tissues were made into serial sections before he staining and observed under a light microscope .
there were 10 mice in each group .
tumor metastasis pcr array the expression patterns of the metastasis - related genes were analyzed using the human tumor metastasis pcr array ( aphs - 028a ; superarray inc. ) , which was obtained from kangchen genechip in shanghai , china .
total rna was extracted from mkn45 - shrna - lv - treated cells and control cells using standard protocols and was then converted to first - strand cdna .
the cdna template was combined with a 2x superarray pcr master mix , the mixture was added to the wells of the pcr array plate ( 384 - well ) containing the gene - specific primer sets , and real - time pcr was performed .
the pcr cycling conditions consisted of 40 cycles of 95degreesc for 15 s , 60degreesc for 1 min , and 72degreesc for 30 s. five housekeeping genes were used as internal controls .
the deltact value for each metastasis - related gene in each treatment group was then calculated .
the differential expression of each gene was measured according to the comparative ct method ( deltadeltact ) , which assessed the fold - change difference in comparison to the mkn45 - shrna - lv control expression as 2 - deltadeltact .
if the fold - change was greater than 2 , the result was reported as a fold up - regulation .
if the fold - change was less than 2 , the negative inverse of the result was reported as a fold down - regulation .
statistical analysis the statistical analysis was performed using spss 17.0 software .
chi2 tests were used to evaluate the significance of differences in coronin 3 expression frequency between gastric cancer tissues and lymph lode metastases .
the kruskal - wallis h - test and the mann - whitney u test were used to analyze the relationship between coronin 3 expression and clinicopathological factors of gastric cancer samples .
a one - way anova was used for analyzing the results of the migration and invasion assays .
differences were considered statistically significant for p values less than 0.05 .

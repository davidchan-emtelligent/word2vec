health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) in common variable immunodeficiency diseases ( cvid ) was evaluated by different tools , which were mainly used to compare different schedules of immunoglobulins administration in cross - sectional or short - term longitudinal studies .
we assessed the hrqol and psychological status of cvid patients in a longitudinal study over a 6 - year period by a generic , non - disease - specific instrument ( sf - 36 ) , and by a general health questionnaire ( ghq - 12 ) for the risk of depression / anxiety .
at baseline , 96 patients were enrolled .
after 1 year , a second assessment was performed on 92 patients and , after 6 years , a third assessment was performed on 66 patients .
eighteen patients died during the study time .
hrqol was low , with mental health scales less affected than physical scales .
a decline in the score on sf - 36 scales was observed between the first and the third assessment for the physical functioning , body pain , general health , social functioning , and role - emotional scales .
the general health scale showed a lower score in these patients , when compared to patients with other chronic diseases .
approximately one - third of the patients were at risk of anxiety / depression at all observation times , a percentage that reached two thirds of the patients , considering only the group of females .
over the 6 years of the study , the health condition of 11 / 66 patients worsened , passing from " ghq - negative " to " ghq - positive " ; their score on sf - 36 scales also decreased .
a decrement of one point in each of the physical functioning , vitality , social functioning , and mental health sf - 36 scales increased the risk of developing anxiety / depression from three to five percent .
a negative variation of the physical functioning score increased the risk of psychological distress .
in a survival analysis with dichotomized variables , physical functioning scores < 50 were associated with a relative risk ( rr ) of 4.4 , whereas social functioning scores < 37.5 were associated with a rr of 10.0 .
in our study , it was the clinical condition , as opposed to the different treatment strategies with immunoglobulins , which had a major role on the deterioration of hrqol .
moreover , in a quality - of - life evaluation , disorders such as anxiety / depression should be assessed , as they yet often go unrecognized .
our results might be helpful in the interpretation of currently available data on quality of life in cvid patients .
common variable immune deficiencies health - related quality of life sf - 36 ghq - 12 immunoglobulins introduction the health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) is a multidimensional concept that encompasses measurements of physical , psychological , and social well - being and assesses the individual 's perception of the impact of illness on his / her life ( 1 ) .
common variable immunodeficiency diseases ( cvids ) represent a heterogeneous group of rare chronic disorders of the immune system ( 2 ) .
the prognosis can vary from benign to very complex conditions ( 3 ) .
there is substantial evidence that the standard replacement treatment with immunoglobulins prolongs survival , reduces morbidity , and exerts a positive effect on the patients' hrqol ( 4 ) .
until now , different tools to evaluate hrqol in cvid were used mainly to assess the patients' outcome and satisfaction related to different treatment choices ( i.e. , intravenous - ivig vs. subcutaneous - scig immunoglobulin routes of administration ) ( 5 , 6 ) .
however , hrqol in cvid should be assessed in the frame of the wide spectrum of the severity of the disease , taking into consideration the long life course of the disease .
there are several critical reasons to evaluate the available data on hrqol in cvid .
the absence of a disease - specific questionnaire is a major limitation .
only observational or short - term longitudinal studies on small cohorts were performed .
differences in hrqol were mainly evaluated to compare different treatment regimens and routes of immunoglobulins administration. with such limitations in evaluating quality of life in cvid , both ourselves and others ( 7 - 9 ) have used generic , non - disease - specific instruments , such as the health status questionnaire ( medical outcome study 36 - items short form , sf - 36 ) and the general health questionnaire ( ghq - 12 items ) for the psychological assessment .
all the studies agreed that cvid patients have a poor quality of life , especially in the physical domain , suffer a lot , and are at risk of psychological distress .
because of the long lifetime of the disease , it is possible to speculate that quality of life in a population affected by a clinical and immunological heterogeneous disease may vary depending on age , treatment , clinical conditions , associated diseases , personal attitude , etc .
thus , it is evident that studies about the hrqol outcome in cvid should be extended from a simple assessment to multimodal and longitudinal assessments and should include the patients' reported outcome measures .
the aim of this study was to assess the hrqol and psychological status of patients with cvid over a 6 - year period , using sf - 36 and ghq - 12 questionnaires .
moreover , we investigated whether the psychological problems of patients , such as risk of depression / anxiety , could be associated with their health status .
materials and methods study design for this observational , longitudinal , cohort study ( figure 1 ) , performed in a day hospital setting , patients' participation was obtained after signing an informed consent .
the study was conducted in the period 2008 - 2013 .
one hundred twelve cvid patients were informed and considered eligible for the study .
at basal time ( t0 ) , 96 patients were enrolled and 16 patients refused to participate .
after 1 year , at the second assessment ( t1 ) 92 out of 96 patients were evaluated ( between t0 and t1 two patients died and two patients refused to continue the study ) .
after 6 years , 66 out of 92 patients were available for the third assessment ( t2 ). between t1 and t2 , 12 patients refused to participate and 16 patients died in the 5 - year period .
at the end of the study , data for the 66 patients were considered , taking into account all three observations .
at t0 , t1 , and t2 , patients were asked to fill in questionnaires concerning their health status and the possible presence of risk for depression and / or anxiety .
the severity of disease judged by the physician ( physician global assessment , phga ) and by the patient ( patient 's global assessment , ptga ) was recorded .
the study protocol was approved by the ethical board of the sapienza , university of rome .

patients we enrolled 112 patients with cvids attending our reference center for primary immune deficiencies .
patients were diagnosed according to the esid / pagid criteria for cvids ( 10 ) , based on igg < 500 mg / dl , iga 2 sd below age - specific reference range , age onset > 4 years , poor response to vaccines , and exclusion of other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia .
no genetic causes of cvid were identified in this cohort .
a detailed set of data was available , since all patients with a diagnosis of cvid have been regularly followed up in our center according to the italian guidelines ( www.aieop.org ) ; their clinical and immunological data have been collected regularly in a national database , once a year .
the dataset included age , date of cvid diagnosis , immunological data , including lymphocyte subsets and serum igg , iga , and igm levels determined every 3 months , clinical manifestations , route , doses , and intervals of ig replacement , and occurrence of adverse reactions .
route , dosage , and interval of ig replacement were recorded once a month .
at t0 , 84 patients were on replacement therapy with ivig and 12 with scig. between t0 and t2 , 6 / 66 patients shifted from ivig to scig .
high - resolution chest computerized tomography ( hrct ) scans was performed once in every 4 years in all patients according to national guidelines .
all patients have been on ivig or scig replacement for at least 5 years .
questionnaires we used validated tools : sf - 36 , ghq - 12 , and pga questionnaires .
sf - 36 despite the fact that it was designed as a generic health status indicator for use in population surveys and health policy evaluation studies , the sf - 36 can also be used as an outcome measure ( 11 , 12 ) .
the sf - 36 includes 36 items in a likert - type or forced - choice format , intended for measuring the following eight dimensions : physical functioning ( pf , limitations in performing physical activities such as bathing or dressing ) , role - physical ( rp , limitations in work and other daily activities as a consequence of physical health ) , bodily pain ( bp , how severe and limiting pain is ) , general health ( gh , how general personal health is perceived by the patient ) , vitality ( vt , feeling tired and worn out vs. feeling energetic ) , social functioning ( sf , interference with regular social activities because of physical or emotional problems ) , role - emotional ( re , limitations in work and other daily activities as a consequence of emotional problems ) , and mental health ( mh , feeling nervous and depressed vs. peaceful , happy , and calm ) .
scores for each domain ranged from 0 to 100 , with higher scores indicating better health .
two additional summary measures , the physical component summary ( pcs ) and mental component scores ( mcs ) , cross - culturally validated in the framework of the international quality of life assessment project for the italian version of the sf - 36 , were also obtained .
ghq - 12 the ghq - 12 is a self - administered , 12 - item questionnaire , designed to measure psychological distress and to detect current non - psychotic , psychiatric disorders , such as depression and anxiety ( 13 , 14 ) .
answers are given on a 4 - point scale ; for instance , the item " in the last weeks , did you feel under strain ?" allows for the following answers : " no ," " not more than usual ," " more than usual ," and " much more than usual. " when scored with the binary method ( 0 - 0 - 1 - 1 ) , the ghq - 12 can be used as a screening tool to detect minor non - psychotic , psychiatric disorders , yielding final scores that range from 0 to 12 .
operationally , patients scoring 4 or more were considered as " ghq - positive " ( ghq +) .
pga for each patient , an overall clinical severity evaluation of the disease was given by the provider and by the patient him / herself .
the phga and the ptga consisted of the following questions respectively : " in your opinion , compared to other patients with the same condition , how severe is the disease of patient x ?" and " in your experience , how severe is your disease ?" answers were given on a 5 - point scale : " very mild ," " mild ," " moderate ," " severe ," and " very severe. " for the purpose of statistical analysis , " very mild "/" mild " were considered as low severity and " severe "/" very severe " as high severity , and were grouped .
the same physician at t0 , t1 , and t2 recorded her evaluation at the end of the visit .
patients recorded his / her evaluation after the completion of the questionnaires .
statistics in the first part , for descriptive analyses and comparisons among groups , we used t - test for independent samples and anova for the comparison of mean values , due to the samples' size .
chi - squared test was also used for the comparison of percentages .
for the 66 patients present in each observation , paired tests were used .
in the second part , we performed a logistic regression analysis to assess the independent role of sf - 36 scales on ghq - 12 deterioration over time .
in the last part , in order to investigate factors predicting mortality , survival analysis was performed , both through kaplan - meier curves and cox regression analysis .
all analyses were performed using the stata version 11 ( stata corp , college station , tx , usa ) .
results the study design flow chart on cvid patients enrolled in the cohort study is shown in figure 1 .
one hundred twelve patients were enrolled ; 96 patients accepted to participate in the study [ m / f : 50 / 46 ; mean age : 48.2 +/ - 17.0 years old ( range 14 - 85 ) ; mean time of disease since diagnosis : 10.7 years ( range 5 - 36 )] ; 92 patients [ m / f : 47 / 45 ; mean age : 49 +/ - 4.9 years old ( range 15 - 86 )] completed the second assessment .
sixty - six patients [ m / f : 32 / 34 ; mean age : 50 +/ - 5.7 years old ( range 20 - 76 )] completed the t0 , t1 , and t2 assessments .
thirty patients refused to participate ( 16 at t0 , 2 at t1 , and 12 at t2 ) .
eighteen patients [ m / f : 9 / 9 ; mean age : 62.9 +/ - 14.7 years old ( range 39 - 88 )] died in the 6 - year period .
causes of death were : gastrointestinal cancer ( 5 patients ) , lymphoproliferative diseases ( 5 patients ) , chronic lung disease ( cld ) ( 2 patients ) , cirrhosis ( 1 patient ) , and granulomatosis ( 5 patients ) .
descriptive analyses patients' characteristics at baseline and comparison between sf - 36 in cvid and in other chronic diseases at baseline ( t0 ) , the characteristics of patients were those reported in our study published in 2012 ( 7 ) .
a summary of our previous data on hrqol is reported in table 1 .
being female , older , and affected by cld and chronic diarrhea proved to be major risk factors leading to a poor quality of life .
the basal mean scores for sf - 36 scales were also compared to those reported ( 12 ) on patients affected by other chronic diseases ( table 2 ) .
hrqol was lower than that reported in generally healthy population , with mental health scales less affected than physical scales .
in cvid , better scores for pf , bp , vt , sf , re , and mh scales were observed , while rp and gh scales showed a lower score in comparison to patients with all other disease entities , with the exception of patients affected by heart failures who showed the lowest scores .
the different age range of patients in each group ( older in cancer , younger in cvid ) has a significant effect on profiles of sf - 36 average scores .
therefore , one must be cautious in the interpretation of differences in sf - 36 scores between pathologies : they cannot be entirely attributed to the " pure " effect of the disease .
this consideration is even more valid in the longitudinal study .

longitudinal variation of sf - 36 longitudinal variations in sf - 36 scores were observed over the whole sample , as well as over the subsample of 66 patients attending all three sequential assessments .
the scores observed considering the sf - 36 mean values in the 66 patients , who were followed at all three points of observation times , are shown in figure 2 .
differences in the scores of sf - 36 scales between t0 and t2 are statistically significant for the following scales : pf ( p = 0.03 ) , bp ( p = 0.05 ) , gh ( p = 0.02 ) , sf ( p = 0.002 ) , and re ( p = 0.03 ) .
however , we should consider the age dependence of all scales , especially because patients at t2 were 6 years older than at t0 .
moreover , we found no differences in hrqol scales between patients on replacement with ivig and scig .

ghq assessment and ptga / phga ghq - 12 assessment showed that more than 35 % of the patients were at risk of anxiety and depression ( ghq - positive ) at all observation times ( table 3 ) .
this percentage was increased to about 70 % in females .
the disease severity perception graded by patients and by physicians at the three points of observation is reported in table 3 .
differences between the perception of patients and physicians were more evident at t2 , with higher percentage of low severity grade reported by physicians .
as expected , phga was greater in ghq - positive patients .
twenty - five percent of ghq - positive patients considered their disease severity as high .

the 15 patients who were permanently ghq - positive at all observations had constantly low mean values of scores on sf - 36 scales .
patients with a highly severe perception of the disease ( ptga ) and patients who were judged as seriously affected by the physicians ( phga ) reported a lower health status with respect to the others .
general health questionnaire data and variations of mean values in specific sf - 36 scales to analyze the relationship between sf - 36 and ghq - 12 data , variation in ghq status between t0 and t2 were coded as 1 when ghq passed from 0 to 1 ( ghq - worsened ) and as 0 in all other instances ( ghq - stable / improved ) .
changes in sf - 36 scales were recorded as absolute differences between values at t0 at t2 .
average variation in sf - 36 scores was then compared between the group of ghq - worsened and ghq - stable / improved .
the sf - 36 scales showing variations significantly different in the two groups ( ghq - worsened and ghq - stable / improved ) were selected .
over the 6 - year observational period , the general health condition of 11 / 66 patients worsened , passing from " ghq - negative " to " ghq - positive " status , i.e. , showing symptoms of psychological distress .
these patients also registered a negative score variation on sf - 36 scales : physical functioning , vitality , social functioning , and mental health .
in a logistic regression , controlled for age and gender , we noticed that a decrement of 1 point in each of the four mentioned scales increases the risk of developing anxiety / depression from 3 to 5 % ( table 4 ) .
thus , the ghq - 12 and sf - 36 deteriorations were strictly linked .
to convey an idea of the magnitude of the effect , we considered the cumulative observed variation of the physical functioning scale ( pf ) over the follow - up period : 10 points .
the odds ratio of 1.05 means that a patient affected by the average negative variation of pf has an increased risk of 5 % per year of psychological distress .
also vt , sf , and mh subscales were strongly influenced by ghq status ( figure 3 ) .

moreover , clinical improvement of cvid was observed in patients receiving high ig dosages , > 600 mg / kg / months ( 17 , 18 ) .
these dosages might allow to keep igg trough levels > 600 - 800 mg / dl. we then grouped our cvid cohort on the basis of three defined parameters : iga > 7 mg / dl , igg trough levels > 600 mg / dl , switched memory > 2 % .
at t0 , 67 % of the patients had iga levels < 7 ; 50 % had switched memory b cells < 2 % ; 61 % had igg levels > 600 mg / dl ( a percentage ranging from 14 to 26 has missing information on these parameters ) .
the analysis of the mean values on sf - 36 scales in patients with or without each defined parameter showed no statistically significant differences among groups .
low hrqol was predictive of mortality patients' mortality during the follow - up was registered with exact date of death .
according to this outcome , patients at t0 were divided into two groups : survivors vs. deceased .
cox survival analysis was performed , introducing as covariates the sf - 36 scales that showed marked differences between survivors and deceased at t0 .
age and gender were also included in the analysis in order to estimate the role of hrqol in predicting mortality , as adjusted by these two variables .
for the sf - 36 scales independently predictive of mortality , we operated a dichotomization of values , indicating " at - risk " and " not at - risk " patients .
the cut - off values were selected observationally based on points of disruption in the trend of number of death over sf - 36 scores .
for sf - 36 scales predictive of mortality , we graphed the two groups (" at - risk " and " not at - risk ") with kaplan - meier survival curves , whose significance was verified by log - rank test .
a new cox survival analysis with sf - 36 scales dichotomized was produced , in order to assess the specific risk of death for the patients that scored under the cut - off at t0 .
the most evident difference between the two groups ( table 5 ) is , not surprisingly , in terms of age : survivors are significantly younger than deceased patients .
however , score values of physical and social functioning as well as role - emotional at t0 seem to be remarkably reduced for patients that died during the study time .
this result was partially confirmed when adjusted by age : except for the role - emotional , which has no age - independent effect on mortality , both physical and social functioning score values maintain their significant predictive power .

the two predictive scales ( pf and sf ) were then dichotomized based on the observed point of disruption in the trend of number of deaths per different scores of pf and sf. more specifically , a cut - off value of 50 was selected for pf and a value of 37.5 for sf. people with values higher than the cut - off were classified as " not at - risk ," compared to the " at - risk " below the cut - off .
in a survival analysis with these dichotomized variables , pf scores < 50 were associated with a rr of 4.4 ( ci : 1.7 - 11.8 , p < 0.03 ) and sf scores < 37.5 determined a rr of 10.0 ( ci : 2.6 - 37.9 , p < 0.001 ) .
in other words , all other variables being equal , patients with scores below the cut - off in physical functioning have 4.4 times the risk of dying than patients with higher scores ; the same risk is 10 times higher for patients under the cut - off in social functioning .
figures 4a,b compare survival rates over the follow - up period , between " at - risk " and " not at - risk " patients as classified by t0 for pf / sf scores .
the difference is extremely significant with the " at - risk " group survival curve always below the " not at - risk " curve ( log - rank test < 0.0001 ) .
the median value was approached in both the " at - risk " groups , meaning that half of the patients have died at 48 months ( sf ) and 60 months ( pf ) , whereas , the percentage of death in the " not at - risk " groups is lower than 25 % at the end of the observation period ( 72 months ) .

discussion patient reported outcome measures in clinical practice , in particular , those evaluating hrqol ( 19 ) , have been proposed as a means of facilitating doctor - patient communication , uncovering patients' problems , as well as monitoring disease or treatment , and as a screening for functional problems ( 20 , 21 ) .
in a previous study on hrqol performed in our cohort of cvid patients , we showed ( 7 ) a low hrqol in particular in physical domains : the role - physical and the general health scales of the sf - 36 questionnaire .
moreover , we showed that being female , older , and ghq - positive proved to be major risk factors associated with a poor health status .
here , we extended the study time over a 6 - year period .
to our knowledge , this is the first longitudinal assessment of hrqol in adult cvid patients .
we confirmed that hrqol was lower than that reported in generally healthy population with mental health scales less affected than physical scales .
moreover , physical role and general health scales showed the worse scores at all observational times and were lower than those reported in patients with other chronic disease entities ( 12 ) , with the exception of patients affected by heart failures .
moreover , we showed that about one - third of patients were at risk of anxiety / depression at all observation times , a percentage that reached two - thirds of patients , considering only the group of females .
the crucial role of anxiety / depression symptoms on hrqol has been proven recently also in a pediatric population affected by primary immunodeficiencies , where the disease was less likely to affect physical functioning than psychosocial functioning ( 22 ) .
patients tested continuously that ghq - positive had a perception of the disease as severe and recorded low mean values of all sf - 36 scales .
thus , the ghq - 12 and sf - 36 deteriorations were strictly linked .
however , it is impossible to verify which might be the primum movens .
since patients with a decrease of the physical functioning , the worse sf - 36 scale in cvid , increased their risk of psychological distress about 50 % during the observational time , it is possible to hypothesize that the disease might be the major cause of depression / anxiety .
our data on hrqol confirmed the data reported 10 years ago in the first multidimensional assessment on hrqol in cvid ( 23 ) and more recently in a survey run by ipopi ( 4 ) .
however , sf - 36 scales showed less severe defects than those previously reported , possibly because of the over - representation of females in both studies .
all studies recognized limitations in work and other daily activities as a result of declined physical health and general health .
hrqol measures ensure that treatment and evaluations are focused on the patient rather than on the disease , and may be used as a way of capturing the personal and social context of patients and linking it to the classical clinical view of the disease .
however , while hrqol measures are now quite commonly included in the protocols of randomized , controlled clinical trials and other clinical studies , their use in routine clinical practice is still quite limited ; they were never used in combination with other questionnaires , limiting the possibility to identify correct measures of intervention .
in fact , our experience in the evaluation of the hrqol in a day hospital setting for cvid patients , confirmed what has been observed in other diseases , namely that ghq - positive patients ( with minor psychiatric , non - psychotic diseases such as depression or anxiety ) suffer a lot ( 13 ) .
thus , in the comprehensive evaluation of the patients' status , their psychological condition and disorders such as anxiety / depression should be evaluated in a global hrqol assessment as they yet often go unrecognized .
counseling can be useful in ghq - positive patients , since an improvement of ghq status might lead to a better hrqol .
on the other hand , an improvement in hrqol can be associated with improvement in psychological well - being .
our results might be helpful in the interpretation of data currently available on quality of life in cvid patients receiving different immunoglobulin treatment options .
a recent study from ipopi ( 4 ) reported that most patients were satisfied with their current therapy .
significant differences in satisfaction were seen when comparing scig with ivig administration ; scig respondents were more satisfied with treatment than ivig respondents .
since we have shown that the perception of disease severity was linked to the ghq status and that ghq - positive patients will perceive their disease as more severe , without a parallel assessment of the psychological status of patients receiving scig or ivig , it might be difficult to attribute an advantage to a treatment modality vs. another .
moreover , as the authors claimed , the results of the survey done on patients affiliated to the ipopi , might not represent all people with primary immune deficiencies treated with immunoglobulin therapy .
despite this limitation , their data indicated that the primary immunodeficiency impacted on quality of life , also taking into account the favorable effect of immunoglobulin treatment .
in our study , the clinical condition , as opposed to the different treatment strategies with immunoglobulins , had a major role on the deterioration of hrqol .
values of physical and social functioning as well as role - emotional scales of sf - 36 at t0 were remarkably reduced for patients that died during the study time .
even if survivors were significantly younger than deceased patients , with the exception of the role - emotional , which has no age - independent effect on mortality , both physical and social functioning maintained their significant predictive power .
the rr of death for pf and sf was 0.98 and 0.97 , respectively , meaning that each point increase in pf and sf , independently of age reduces the risk of death by 2 and 3 % , respectively .
we have already shown ( 24 ) that malignancies are the major cause of death in patients with adult onset cvid : the high rate of mortality ( about 20 % in a 40 - year follow - up ) was similar to that reported in a study run in the united states of america over a similar period of follow - up ( 25 ) .
the high rate of mortality observed here further confirmed the need to focus our attention on early diagnosis of non - lymphoid and lymphoid cancers that influence lives and hrqol in cvid .
monitoring health status in long - term longitudinal studies with generic tools , such as sf - 36 and ghq - 12 , may provide information about clinical status , therapy efficacy , and eventually a modification in physical or mental status .
it is relevant to consider here the specificities of each area of the sf - 36 health status and the ghq - 12 assessments , taking into consideration any effort to reduce the physical burden of the disease .
however , a major limitation in the assessment of hrqol in cvid is still the absence of a disease - specific questionnaire available to monitor quality of life in many other diseases .
we are now developing and validating a cvid - disease - specific questionnaire on hrqol necessary to complement evidence - based guidelines and policies .

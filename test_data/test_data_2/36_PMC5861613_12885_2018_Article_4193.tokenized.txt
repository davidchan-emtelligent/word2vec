background the veristrat test is a serum proteomic signature originally discovered in non - responders to second line gefitinib treatment and subsequently used to predict differential benefit from erlotinib versus chemotherapy in previously treated advanced non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) .
multiple studies highlight the clinical utility of the veristrat test , however , the mechanistic connection between veristrat - poor classification and poor prognosis in untreated and previously treated patients is still an active area of research .
the aim of this study was to correlate veristrat status with other circulating biomarkers in advanced nsclc patients - each with respect to clinical outcomes .
methods serum samples were prospectively collected from 57 patients receiving salvage chemotherapy and 70 non - egfr mutated patients receiving erlotinib .
patients were classified as either veristrat good or poor based on the veristrat test .
luminex immunoassays were used to measure circulating levels of 102 distinct biomarkers implicated in tumor aggressiveness and treatment resistance .
a cox ph model was used to evaluate associations between biomarker levels and clinical outcome , whereas the association of veristrat classifications with biomarker levels was assessed via the mann - whitney rank sum test .
results veristrat was prognostic for outcome within the erlotinib treated patients ( hr = 0.29 , p < 0.0001 ) and predictive of differential treatment benefit between erlotinib and chemotherapy (( interaction hr = 0.25 ; interaction p = 0.0035 ) .
a total of 27 biomarkers out of 102 unique analytes were found to be significantly associated with os ( cox ph p <= 0.05 ) , whereas 16 biomarkers were found to be associated with pfs .
thrombospondin - 2 , c - reactive protein , tnf - receptor i , and placental growth factor were the analytes most highly associated with os , all with cox ph p - values <= 0.0001 .
veristrat status was found to be significantly associated with 23 circulating biomarkers ( mann - whitney rank sum p <= 0.05 ) , 6 of which had p < 0.001 , including c - reactive protein , il - 6 , serum amyloid a , cyfra 21.1 , igf - ii , osteopontin , and ferritin .
conclusions strong associations were observed between survival and veristrat classifications as well as select circulating biomarkers associated with fibrosis , inflammation , and acute phase reactants as part of this study .
the associations between these biomarkers and veristrat classification might have therapeutic implications for poor prognosis nsclc patients , particularly with new immunotherapeutic treatment options .

n / a borgia jeffrey a. issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 background the veristrat ( vs ) test classifies patients as either good or poor based on a matrix assisted laser desorption / ionization time - of - flight ( maldi - tof ) mass spectrometry protein signature [ 1 ] .
it has been shown to be prognostic for outcomes in advanced nsclc patients treated with egfr tkis and platinum - based chemotherapy and predictive of differential survival benefit between egfr tkis and single agent chemotherapy [ 1 - 6 ] .
the prognostic benefit of the vs test has been demonstrated with other therapies for nsclc , including those targeting angiogenic pathways .
analysis of cohorts treated with combinations erlotinib and bevacizumab or erlotinib and sorafenib showed superior overall survival for the good classification group compared with the poor group [ 7 - 11 ] .
in addition , studies of vs in patients treated with front line platinum doublet chemotherapy [ 12 , 13 ] and in previously treated patients receiving nivolumab [ 14 ] indicate that vs 's prognostic ability extends to other therapeutic regimens .
multiple isoforms of serum amyloid a contribute to the 8 - peak proteomic signature that underpins the vs test , but the identity of some of the other components of the signature remain unknown [ 1 , 15 ] .
as expression of serum amyloid a , an acute phase protein , is known to play a role in the vs test classification , it is to be expected that the veristrat classification is associated with other proteins related to the acute response and / or chronic inflammation , as well .
the objective of this study was to evaluate potential correlations between vs good and poor classifications , outcomes , and circulating biomarkers implicated in tumor progression and treatment resistance in pretreatment sera collected from advanced nsclc patients treated with second line cytotoxic chemotherapy or erlotinib .
methods patient population the rush university medical center ( rumc ) biorepository houses biospecimens ( serum , plasma , plasma buffy coats ) from over 500 cases of advanced stage nsclc. from this cohort , we selected cases that failed front - line treatment and were treated with either cytotoxic agents or erlotinib .
individual treatments were selected by the physician in accordance to standards of care .
disease progression were assigned to all cases based on version 1.1 of recist criteria .
serum and clinical data were collected prospectively with written informed patient consent .
this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at rumc .
collection and storage of serum specimens peripheral blood was collected in standard 10 ml red - top vacutainers ( r ) from each patient immediately prior to treatment initiation .
samples were processed using standard phlebotomy methods , as previously described [ 16 ] .
a portion of each serum sample used for the luminex evaluations were supplemented with 25 mul / ml of the mammalian protease inhibitor cocktail ( sigma , st. louis , mo ) and 10 mul / ml of 0.5 m edta to minimize further proteolysis .
aliquots were archived in a - 80 degreesc freezer until testing .
no specimen tested in this study was subject to greater than two freeze - thaw cycles .
egfr mutational status egfr mutational status was determined when possible from archival ffpe materials as we previously described [ 17 ] .
when ffpe material was not available , digital droplet pcr was used to determine mutational status on cell - fee dna in patient plasma , also as previously described [ 16 ] .
briefly , circulating free dna ( cfdna ) was purified from plasma ( yellow top - acd ) using the nucleospin plasma xs kit ( clontech laboratories ) and evaluated on a nanodrop ( agilent technolgies , santa clara , ca ) or qubit ( thermofisher scientific ) spectrophotometer .
a bio - rad qx200 digital pcr system ( bio - rad laboratories ) was then used to interrogate the specimens for the egfr mutations g719s and l858r as well as an exon 19 deletion ( e746 - a750 ) .
amplicon levels were determined on a qx200 droplet reader and analyzed using the quantasofttm software ( bio - rad ) .
measurements of serum biomarker levels serum specimens were evaluated with a total of 104 assays ( consisting of 102 unique analytes ) , performed using luminex immunobead assays as indicated below .
all primary data points were collected on a luminex flexmap 3d ( r ) system .
analyte concentrations were calculated from a 7 - point curve using a five - parametric fit algorithm ( xponent ( r ) v4.0.3 luminex corp. , austin , tx ) .
all data met minimum quality control thresholds defined by the kit manufacturer with percent coefficient of variation (% cv ) values <= 10 % , all as previously defined [ 16 ] .
biomarkers used in the current study were as follows : igf - i ( milliplex ( r ) map human igf - i single plex ; emd millipore corp. , billerica , ma ) , igf - ii ( milliplex ( r ) map cancer biomarker panel ; emd millipore corp. , billerica , ma ) , igfbp - 1 , igfbp - 2 , igfbp - 3 , igfbp - 4 , igfbp - 5 , igfbp - 6 , igfbp - 7 ( milliplex ( r ) map human igf binding protein ( igfbp ) panel ; emd millipore corp. , billerica , ma ) , angiopoietin - 2 , g - csf , bmp - 9 , endoglin , endothelin - 1 , fgf - 1 , follistatin , il - 8 , hgf , hb - egf , plgf , vegf - c , vegf - d , fgf - 2 , vegf - a ( milliplex ( r ) map human human angiogenesis / growth factor panel 1 ; emd millipore corp. , billerica , ma ) , angiostatin , saxl , sc - kit / scfr , sher2 , sher3 , se - selectin , shgfr / c - met , tenascin - c , pdgf - ab / bb , sil - 6ralpha , stie - 2 , thrombospondin - 2 , sneuropilin - 1 , segfr , supar , svegfr1 , svegfr2 , svegfr3 , specam - 1 ( milliplex ( r ) map human osteopontin human angiogenesis panel 2 ; emd millipore corp. , billerica , ma ) , segfr , scd30 , sgp130 , sil - 1ri , sil - 1rii , sil - 2ralpha , sil - 4r , sil - 6r , srage , stnfri , stnfrii , svegfr1 , svegfr2 , svegfr3 ( milliplex ( r ) map human soluble cytokine receptor panel ; emd millipore corp. , billerica , ma ) , hcg , alpha - fetoprotein , ca - 125 , ca 15 - 3 , ca 19 - 9 , cea , he4 , mif , osteopontin , prolactin , scf , sfas , sfasl , tgf - alpha , tnf - alpha , total psa , trail , cyfra 21 - 1 ( milliplex ( r ) map human circulating cancer biomarker panel 1 ) amphiregulin , betacellulin , epiregulin , egf , hb - egf , pdgf - bb , plgf , tenascin c ( widescreen human cancer panel 2 , emd millipore corp. ) , adipsin and adiponectin ( human diabetes 2 - plex ; bio - rad laboratories , inc. , hercules , ca ) , insulin , gip , glucagon , visfatin , ghrelin , glp - 1 , pai - 1 , resistin , c - peptide , leptin ( human diabetes 10 - plex ; bio - rad laboratories , inc. , hercules , ca ) , haptoglobin , crp , alpha - 2 - macroglobulin , serum amyloid p , tissue plasminogen activator , ferritin , fibrinogen , procalcitonin , serum amyloid a ( human acute phase 5 + 4 - plex panel ; bio - rad laboratories , inc. , hercules , ca ) .
veristrat classifications veristrat ( vs ) testing was performed as described [ 1 , 3 ] .
the test is based on maldi mass spectrometry ( ms ) .
all samples were provided to biodesix and processed in a blinded manner ; only rush investigators had access to information beyond specimen code at the time of testing .
ion current ( intensity ) values of eight spectral regions were evaluated in triplicate and compared to a standard reference set in order to assign a good or poor classification label .
an indeterminate classification status was assigned to cases with discordant findings in the replicates .
only patients with classifications of veristrat good ( vsg ) or veristrat poor ( vsp ) were included in the study cohort .
biomarker statistical methods the erlotinib and chemotherapy groups were evaluated for differences between clinic - demographic parameters using the mann - whitney and fisher 's exact tests .
time - to - event outcomes ( pfs / os ) were associated with biomarkers concentrations in a continuous scale using the cox proportional hazards ( ph ) regression analyses .
the association of veristrat classification with treatment grouping and progression - free survival ( pfs ) and overall survival ( os ) were accomplished using the multivariate cox ph interaction model , in a manner similar to other studies [ 6 ] .
the association of vs status with circulating biomarker levels was evaluated with the mann - whitney rank sum test and graphically reported as box - and - whisker plots .
false discovery rate ( fdr ) was calculated for association of biomarker concentrations with outcomes and veristrat classification using the method of benjamini and hochberg [ 18 ] .
results patient demographics and clinical correlates this prospective non - randomized study included a cohort of advanced nsclc patients from rumc who had disease progression on front - line platinum doublet based chemotherapy and were treated subsequently with either cytotoxic agents ( n = 57 ) or erlotinib ( n = 70 ) .
treatment was chosen at the discretion of the patient 's physician .
the study cohort was 53 % female , 72 % white , with 87 % smokers .
median age was 65 years and 63 % had performance status 1 and 80 % of patients had non - squamous disease .
no statistically significant differences in population with respect to patient characteristics were detected between the two treatment cohorts ( table 1 ) .
briefly , the mean age was 64.0 years for both sub - cohorts , while gender distributions were 49.2 % and 55.7 % female for chemotherapy and erlotinib arms , respectively .
as shown in table 1 , the gender difference was not statistically different .
racial distributions were also similar between the chemotherapy and erlotinib cohorts , consisting primarily of white subjects ( 73.0 % and 74.3 % , respectively ) , black ( 26.3 % and 21.4 % , respectively ) , with the balance being asian or asian / pacific islanders .
both arms were composed chiefly of non - squamous histology ( 79.0 % chemotherapy , 81.4 % erlotinib ) , and this difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.8235 ) .
an overwhelming majority of the subjects in both cohorts were current or former smokers , with a slightly higher portion of which in the chemotherapy cohort ( 91.2 % versus 82.9 % , chemotherapy and erlotinib ; p = 0.0831 ) .
egfr mutation status was evaluated in 77 % of the chemotherapy cohort and 63 % of the erlotinib cohort , when evaluable specimens ( tumor or plasma ) were available ; however no egfr mutations were detected in any sample .

further , veristrat classification was independent of age , gender and racial distributions , smoking status , and tumor histology / grade ( p > 0.10 ) .
patient characteristics with respect to vs status are provided as additional file 1 : table s1 .
not surprisingly , there was a trend towards ( p = 0.0807 ) a superior performance status in the vsg group relative to those classified as veristrat poor ( vsp ) , as shown in additional file 2 : table s2 .
the median progression - free survival ( pfs ) and overall survival ( os ) for the entire cohort were 10.7 weeks ( 95 % ci : 8.3 - 12.6 ) and 31.7 weeks ( 95 % ci : 25.6 - 38.1 ) , respectively .
no significant difference in os was detected between treatment groups .
however , dramatic differences were detected between the vsg and vsp groups ( fig. 1 and table 2 ) .
median os in the erlotinib cohort was 41.6 weeks and 8.6 weeks for vsg and vsp groups , and 35.7 weeks and 16.3 weeks , respectively , within the chemotherapy cohort .
a significant interaction between veristrat classification and os was observed when adjusted for baseline patient characteristics ( p = 0.0035 ) .
gender and smoking ( never vs. ever ) were also identified as independent predictors of os ( p = 0.0262 and 0.0056 , respectively ) .
these findings are illustrated via kaplan - meier plots as fig. 1. similar findings were revealed with our evaluation of pfs , as shown in additional file 3 : figure s1. fig. 1 kaplan - meier plot of os by veristrat classification and treatment group table 2 analysis of overall survival by veristrat classification and treatment covariate group cox php value log rankp value veristrat good 0.0002 0.0001 poor treatment erlotinib 0.6043 0.5985 chemotherapy erlotinib good < 0.0001 < 0.0001 poor chemotherapy good 0.2556 0.2520 poor association of biomarkers with clinical outcome circulating levels of 27 biomarkers were found to be significantly associated with os ( cox ph p - value <= 0.05 with fdr < 0.20 ) : of these 16 showed a cox ph p - value < 0.01 and fdr < 0.05 .
( see table 3 ) .
nine markers possessed a p - value < 0.001 , including several biomarkers primarily associated with proinflammatory / acute phase reactants ( crp , saa , ferritin , tnfri , il - 2ralpha , and il - 1rii ) , the balance of the markers were associated with angiogenesis ( thrombospondin - 2 , plgf , and angiopoietin - 2 ) or an indirect measure of an acute phase response ( e.g. procalcitonin ) .
very similar findings in terms of biomarkers and processes being represented were obtained when examining pfs , but only 16 biomarkers showed a cox ph p - value <= 0.05 .

though prognostic information is certainly useful for counseling nsclc patients , identifying some of the key ( mechanistic ) drivers underlying the veristrat poor ( vsp ) classification could open the door for patient selection for novel therapies that might improve outcomes. with the strong prognostic utility of the vs test , the vsg population would likely benefit from most standard of care based therapies , with cautious introduction of agents to improve response .
in our study , we have demonstrated that vsg patients benefits from both egfr tki as well as single - agent chemotherapy in the egfr wt population. and while the cohorts evaluated in this study were treated prior to fda approval of nivolumab for pretreated nsclc , we are very interested in further evaluating the vs test , and the selected serum biomarkers , to cohorts receiving pd - 1 / - l1 directed immunotherapy .
in this , we anticipate that vs good patients may receive more benefit from immune checkpoint inhibition therapy due to less chronic inflammation and suppression of cytotoxic t cell activity .
the current study was developed to investigate potential correlations between specific peptide and protein biomarkers and vs classification .
these findings might generate hypotheses regarding mechanisms of tumor progression and novel therapeutic interventions .
our patient population was unremarkable in terms of clinical characteristics and prevalence of vs status relative to other studies evaluating the predictive and / or prognostic value of vs in pretreated nsclc patients [ 3 , 6 ] .
the study confirmed the results of the prose study [ 6 ] which demonstrated the predictive ability of the vs test for differential survival benefit between erlotinib and single agent chemotherapy .
note that although there was no stratified randomization between treatments in this study , the interaction between vs classification and treatment was significant when adjusted for clinical characteristics .
the prognostic power of the test for egfr tki therapy found in multiple previous studies [ 1 - 6 ] was also confirmed .
a majority of the circulating protein biomarkers significantly associated with outcome were proinflammatory / acute phase reactants .
the acute phase response is commonly associated with infection , trauma , inflammatory diseases and cancer [ 20 , 21 ] .
furthermore , these acute phase reactants accompany both acute and chronic inflammatory states , which are known to promote carcinogenesis and enable cancer characteristics [ 22 ] .
not surprisingly , multiple acute phase reactants have been demonstrated to be correlated with poor prognosis in cancer ( e.g. crp , saa ) [ 23 - 26 ] .
to the best of our knowledge , the vs test is the only multivariate test capturing the acute phase response with broad applicability for use in clinical practice .
in an attempt to further understand some of the biological processes that may be surveyed by this study , we provide a preliminary account of biomarker mapping to biological processes in the supplemental results using the ingenuity pathway analysis suite and a gene set enrichment ( gse ) ( additional file 8 : table s6 and additional file 9 : table s7 , respectively ) .
in these preliminary analyses , ' fibrotic processes' was another prominent theme in the biomarkers associating with the veristrat status , although this finding may simply reflect the presence of circulating biomarkers of an epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition underlying fibrosis [ 27 ]. and while not annotated by these analyses , cancer cachexia emerges as a system - level process highly implicated by these findings ; particularly with the theme combining acute phase reactants ( e.g. thrombospondin - 2 , c - reactive protein , serum amyloid a , ferritin ) , inflammation ( e.g. supar , il - 6 , procalcitonin ) , adipokines ( e.g. leptin , resistin , adiponectin ) , and metabolic control ( e.g. igfbp - 4 , igfbp - 3 , glp - 1 ) emerging as a prominent signature [ with significance of each listed example provided in table 3 ] .
please note these analyses are meant to help promote a mechanistic understanding of the observations from this study and are limited in their scope and should be interpreted with some restraint .
recently , we described negative associations between increasing neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios ( nlr ) and declining body weight changes and overall survival in a cohort of advanced nsclc patients receiving chemotherapy [ 28 ] .
these observations , together with the known involvement of inflammation and cancer cachexia in advanced nsclc , suggest that vs could aid in the identification of patients with cachexia and pre - cachexia who are candidates for anti - cachexic agents , such as anamorelin [ 29 , 30 ] .
inflammatory cytokines [ 31 ] , inflammatory cells [ 31 , 32 ] , and sarcopenia / cachexia [ 33 ] are also implicated in impaired anti - tumor response .
additional study of circulating proteins might identify therapeutic strategies which could positively impact cachexia and anti - tumor immune response .
finally , some of the themes we describe above also followed through to the associations between vs classifications and circulating biomarker levels , where two prominent hierarchical clusters emerge when illustrated as the heatmap , provided as additional file 7 : figure s2 .
namely , cluster 1 included clearly elevated levels of serum amyloid a , c - reactive protein , ferritin , tissue plasminogen activator , il - 6 , and calcitonin in the vsp group , relative to the vsg cases .
in cluster 2 the veristrat good group was observed to have elevated levels of bmp - 9 , srage , svegfr2 , sher - 2 , igf - i , igf - ii , and adipsin , relative to the vsp cases .
[ note : the p value for the association of each biomarker with vs classification is provided in table 4 with the complete list provided as additional file 6 : table s5 ] .
this figure also illustrates nicely the patient - to - patient variations in individual biomarker expression regardless of vs status and stresses the importance of considering multiple analytes in any classification algorithm .
conclusions these findings confirm the prognostic and predictive role of the vs test , as evident by the better outcomes in patients classified as vsg versus vsp in the erlotinib - treated cohort and the differential survival benefit of chemotherapy and erlotinib between vs classifications .
in addition , we identified several inflammatory and angiogenic proteins that are associated with vs classification .
though the number of patients in this study is relatively small , further work in this area may elucidate specific , potentially targetable pathways and processes that could improve outcomes for nsclc patients classified as vsp .

introduction pregnancy - related compressive myelopathy secondary to vertebral hemangioma is a rare occurrence and its treatment antepartum is rare .
case presentation a 19 - year - old north african woman in her 38th week of pregnancy presented with paraplegia that progressed within 2 days after a rapidly progressive weakness of her lower limbs .
magnetic resonance imaging studies showed compression of her spinal cord in front of the fourth thoracic vertebra for suspected tuberculous spondylitis .
a caesarean section was done followed by corpectomy with a bone graft because we intraoperatively discovered a vertebral hemangioma .
pathology showed an aggressive hemangioma .
conclusion at any term of pregnancy , extensive neurological involvement which is rapidly progressive due to compression should be considered for immediate decompression .
antepartum treatment pregnancy spinal cord compression vertebral hemangioma introduction vertebral hemangiomas are among the most common benign tumors involving the spine , usually presenting as an incidental finding on imaging ( magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) or even on plain radiography ) [ 1 ] .
pregnancy , because of several changes , is a recognized risk factor coinciding with the development of a rapid onset of symptoms from these normally asymptomatic lesions .
less than 1 % of vertebral hemangiomas cause neurologic symptoms from spinal cord or nerve root compression ; they can lead to serious neurologic deficits if not treated immediately [ 2 ] .
so , prompt diagnosis is essential in planning optimal therapy and preventing morbidity for both mother and fetus .
we report a case of an aggressive vertebral hemangioma during pregnancy that was treated surgically after cesarean delivery and we also review the current literature on pregnancy - related vertebral hemangiomas .
case presentation a 19 - year - old , north african , primiparous woman presented to our emergency room in the 38th week of gestation with a 10 - day history of a rapidly progressive weakness of her lower limbs .
she mentioned paraplegia progressed within 2 days .
she did not have any back pain , incontinence or constitutional symptoms .
on examination she was pregnant with uterine height corresponding to gestational age and a positive fetal cardiac activity .
there was a spastic paraplegia , without decrease of sensory function of her lower limbs .
mri studies showed compression of her spinal cord located at the t4 level suspicious for tuberculous spondylitis ( because of tuberculosis epidemic in our country ) ( figure 1 ) .
gadolinium contrast material was not administered because of the patient 's pregnancy .
multidisciplinary discussion among obstetricians , neurosurgeons and intensivists , favored a caesarean section action , before the intervention for spondylitis that was to be made the day after the cesarean section .
figure 1 lateral tomography radiographs .
( a ) t2 - weighted magnetic resonance image and .
( b ) t1 - weighted magnetic resonance image of the thoracic spine demonstrating the lesion in the t4 vertebra ( fourth thoracic vertebra ) .
thoracotomy was performed via left posterolateral incision with the excision of her left 6th rib , and intraoperative findings suggested a vertebral hemangioma t4 with anterior spinal cord compression .
t4 corpectomy as well as excision of most of the calcified epidural mass was done .
her excised rib was put in the corpectomy site in two pieces as a bone graft .
two units of blood were transfused during the operation .
histopathologic evaluation of the operation specimen showed typical characteristics of capillary hemangioma ( aggressive hemangioma ) .
after the operation , the patient started to move her legs again , and after a month she began to walk with support .
her 3 - month follow - up examination revealed a normal neurological examination .
discussion vertebral hemangiomas are the most common primary spinal neoplasm and are present in 10 to 12 % of the population .
the majority of patients with vertebral hemangiomas remain asymptomatic , and only 1 % are estimated to become symptomatic .
vertebral hemangiomas were first described by virchow .
the typical radiological appearance of vertical striations was described by perman .
the first case of pregnancy - related hemangioma was reported in 1927 by balado , whereas half of the cases reviewed were published after 1980 [ 2 ] .
in the literature , 26 cases of symptomatic vertebral hemangioma during pregnancy have been reported [ 3 ] .
the mean patient age at presentation was 29 years .
the great majority of these cases presented during the third trimester of pregnancy .
the mean period of gestation at presentation was 7.8 months [ 3 ] .
contrary to their usual location in the lower thoracic and lumbar vertebrae in non - pregnant patients , pregnancy - related vertebral hemangiomas occur more frequently in the upper thoracic levels [ 4 ] .
our patient also had symptoms in the third trimester of her pregnancy .
physiologic changes during pregnancy may induce rapid onset symptoms from these normally asymptomatic lesions. by the seventh month of gestation , the gravid uterus begins to compress the vena cava causing obstruction or functional closure [ 5 ] .
venous obstruction and increased intra - abdominal pressure cause redistribution and increased blood flow volume through the vertebral venous plexus , resulting in the expansion and growth of previously existing vertebral hemangiomas .
this is the most important contributing factor in the clinical manifestation of a pregnancy - induced symptom [ 6 ] .
the hormonal changes taking place during pregnancy have also been implicated for a growth - promoting effect on an already existing hemangioma of the spine , mainly through structural changes within the vessel wall [ 7 ] .
maternal progesterone may increase the venous distensibility .
the endothelial growth - promoting effect of estrogen may contribute to an increase in size of a preexisting hemangioma .
relaxin may have an effect on the vessel walls as well [ 8 ] .
however , immunohistochemical analysis done on vertebral hemangiomas has not been able to demonstrate estrogen and progesterone receptors on tumor tissue and this implicates a hemodynamic rather than a hormonal cause for disease progression .
usually incidental , asymptomatic , and solitary , these are benign vascular lesions that can give rise to symptoms in rare circumstances .
back pain followed by acutely or subacutely progressing paraplegia and sensory loss were the typical presenting symptoms .
more than half of the cases in the literature developed paraplegia within 1 month of onset of back pain [ 3 ] .
it is postulated that neurological symptoms may be produced by one or more of the following mechanisms : compression fracture of involved vertebrae , sudden hemorrhage into the extradural space , hypertrophy of the posterior cortex of the vertebral body , or enlargement of the lamina and facets as a result of the angiomatous invasion , spinal cord ischemia caused by " steal " and subperiosteal growth of the tumor , and spinal cord compression from extradural mass [ 9 ] .
on plain radiographs , vertebral hemangiomas exhibit a characteristic vertically striated or irregular honeycomb pattern .
on axial computed tomography , they have a " polka - dot " pattern as the vertical trabeculae are imaged in cross - section [ 2 ] .
as for diagnosis of vertebral hemangiomas , mri is the first diagnostic choice in pregnancy , because it saves the patient and the fetus from ionizing radiation .
according to pomeranz [ 10 ] , the characteristic mri appearance of a vertebral hemangioma is a hyperintense , mottled , or " starburst " signal on t1 - and t2 - weighted images .
after an injection of gadolinium - diethylenetriaminepentaaceticacid , the extradural portion enhances more evidently , compared with that of the vertebral body .
the histological appearance of hemangiomas consists of benign vascular proliferation with normal capillary and venous structure [ 5 ] .
two types have been described : cavernous and capillary .
the most common type of vertebral hemangioma is the cavernous type , which is characterized by large sinusoidal spaces lined by a single layer of epithelium .
the capillary type of vertebral hemangioma differs from the cavernous type only by having smaller vascular channels .
surgery , radiotherapy , embolization , and various combinations of these have been used in the treatment of symptomatic vertebral hemangiomas .
more recently vertebroplasty has been used in the treatment of symptomatic vertebral hemangiomas .
pregnancy is a relative contraindication to radiotherapy .
embolization is not risk free especially during pregnancy , and complications include vascular injury and radiation exposure to the fetus during fluoroscopy [ 2 ] .
although endovascular embolization ( ee ) with particulate agents such as polyvinyl alcohol foam produce dramatic but usually transient remission , bouchez et al. [ 11 ] reported the first case of a pregnant patient who had a vertebral hemangioma that was embolized successfully and the patient recovered completely ; long - term follow - up is needed to assess the efficacy of this procedure .
the second case was reported by kiroglu et al. [ 3 ] , in which there was no compression fracture , so ee was performed as the first treatment choice , but at the end of 2 uneventful years after ee treatment , the patient 's complaints and pains recurred .
various surgical approaches and techniques are available for symptomatic vertebral hemangioma , and they need to be tailored for each patient according to the location of the tumor within the vertebra and the patient 's symptoms .
percutaneous vertebroplasty ( pv ) , usually with the use of polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) , is a relatively new treatment option for symptomatic vertebral hemangioma .
patients who present with pathologic compression fracture and intractable back pain are good candidates for pv [ 12 ] .
however , because pv is a palliative treatment and has the risk of pmma leakage into the spinal canal , it may be contraindicated in patients with epidural hemangioma [ 12 ] .
progressive neurologic deficit is the main indication for surgical decompression , especially with rapid onset of symptoms [ 2 ] .
anterior corpectomy is potentially curative , and adequate decompression can be achieved in patients with a vertebral body tumor , whereas hemangioma is a highly vascular tumor and intraoperative blood loss may be substantial by corpectomy , and blood transfusion would often be necessary .
laminectomy may afford adequate decompression in selected cases , particularly those with an epidural tumor or with laminar involvement .
laminectomy is apparently not curative when the hemangioma involves the vertebral body .
although laminectomy may be temporarily effective as an emergency decompression procedure , recurrence of symptoms is common , eventually necessitating a definitive treatment for the vertebral body tumor [ 9 ] .
although mechanical integrity of the anterior and middle columns was partially restored by vertebroplasty , castel et al. [ 13 ] also advocated addition of posterior segmental fixation .
the timing of surgery in cases diagnosed antepartum is controversial , as many patients show spontaneous remission after delivery [ 14 ] .
however , the symptoms do not disappear completely [ 9 ] or often can recur , requiring surgery at a later time .
a management algorithm based on a literature review [ 2 ] highlighted two main key aspects in the decision - making process of such scenarios : the week of gestation and the severity of the neurologic impairment .
conservative management , consisting of rest and pain control , was offered to patients approaching the end of their pregnancy ( 32nd week of gestation or later ) or those with only mild or moderate symptoms , whereas any substantial or progressing neurologic deficit was considered an indication for surgical decompression [ 15 ] .
indeed , the accepted norm is to delay intervention until a viable fetus can be delivered should premature labor occur [ 4 ] .
but in the presence of progressive neurological deficits , decompression is essential at the earliest to achieve an optimal outcome especially in those cases that present in the second trimester or early third trimester .
the treatment algorithm proposed by chi et al. [ 2 ] based on the duration of pregnancy and status of neurological deficits is useful in planning treatment in these cases .
patients at 36 weeks of gestation or later , are observed , if neurological function deteriorates , then one can consider induction of delivery followed by appropriate management of the tumor. between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation , expectant observation is considered ; surgery is reserved for severe cases of paraplegia .
for patients in whom gestation is earlier than 32 weeks , prepartum surgical treatment should be considered for those who are severely symptomatic [ 2 ] .
our patient underwent a cesarean section and the day after a corpectomy was performed .
a total of 23 cases of pregnancy - related vertebral hemangioma dating back to 1927 were identified .
prepartum surgery was performed in seven patients , postpartum surgery in 12 [ 5 ] , and no surgery in four [ 11 ] .
among patients treated surgically before childbirth , four experienced preterm labor [ 4 ] ; prepartum surgery was also associated with two maternal deaths [ 14 ] and two fetal deaths [ 4 ] , but all occurred prior to 1985 ( data on cases of death have not been explained in the literature ) .
among patients treated surgically after childbirth , two improved following delivery [ 14 ] , two experienced transient improvement followed by decline and persistent deficit , and five deteriorated or had persistent deficits after delivery [ 5 ] .
excluding deaths , all patients demonstrated excellent neurological recovery , independent ambulation , and resolution of pain at follow - up review ( range 4 months to 5 years ) .
mild paresthesia and weakness not interfering with activities of daily living were found in two patients [ 6 ] .
excluding the two perinatal deaths , there were no reports of adverse effects on the infants , and no adverse effects were noted in the children during the follow - up periods reported .
revision surgery for worsening symptoms after the initial surgery was performed in two patients [ 9 ] .
conclusions pregnancy is a well - recognized condition during which vertebral hemangiomas may become clinically significant .
extensive neurological involvement which is rapidly progressive due to compression should be considered for immediate decompression .
despite the accumulating information on the management of symptomatic hemangiomas during pregnancy , we found no class i data to support any specific modality of treatment , nor the preferred timing for its application .

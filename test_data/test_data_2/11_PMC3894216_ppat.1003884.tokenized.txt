the cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 ( cnf1 ) is a protein toxin which is a major virulence factor of pathogenic escherichia coli strains .
here , we identified the lutheran ( lu ) adhesion glycoprotein / basal cell adhesion molecule ( bcam ) as cellular receptor for cnf1 by co - precipitation of cell surface molecules with tagged toxin .
the cnf1 - lu / bcam interaction was verified by direct protein - protein interaction analysis and competition studies .
these studies revealed amino acids 720 to 1014 of cnf1 as the binding site for lu / bcam .
we suggest two cell interaction sites in cnf1 : first the n - terminus , which binds to p37lrp as postulated before .
binding of cnf1 to p37lrp seems to be crucial for the toxin 's action .
however , it is not sufficient for the binding of cnf1 to the cell surface .
a region directly adjacent to the catalytic domain is a high affinity interaction site for lu / bcam .
we found lu / bcam to be essential for the binding of cnf1 to cells .
cells deficient in lu / bcam but expressing p37lrp could not bind labeled cnf1 .
therefore , we conclude that lrp and lu / bcam are both required for toxin action but with different functions .
author summary we study a crucial virulence factor produced by pathogenic escherichia coli strains , the cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 ( cnf1 ) .
more than 80 % of urinary tract infections ( utis ) , which are counted among the most common bacterial infections of humans , are caused by uropathogenic escherichia coli ( upec ) strains .
we and others elucidated the molecular mechanism of the e. coli toxin cnf1 .
it constitutively activates rho gtpases by a direct covalent modification .
the toxin enters mammalian cells by receptor - mediated endocytosis .
here , we identified the protein receptor for cnf1 by co - precipitation of cell surface molecules with the tagged toxin and subsequent maldi - tof analysis .
we identified the lutheran ( lu ) adhesion glycoprotein / basal cell adhesion molecule ( bcam ) as receptor for cnf1 and located its interaction site to the c - terminal part of the toxin .

introduction urinary tract infections ( utis ) are among the most common bacterial infections of humans .
more than 80 % of utis are caused by uropathogenic escherichia coli ( upec ) strains [ 1 ] .
many pathogenic escherichia coli strains including upec and strains inducing meningitis or soft tissue infections produce cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 ( cnf1 ) , a protein toxin which contributes to virulence [ 2 ]. of major importance for its role as a virulence factor is the effect of cnf1 on epithelial barrier - and immune cell functions [ 3 ] .
both features are controlled by rho gtpases , which are directly targeted by the toxin .
cnf1 deamidates a specific glutamine ( gln63 / 61 ) of rho proteins , which is crucial for gtp hydrolysis and therefore , the rho proteins are arrested in a constitutively activated state [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
rho family gtpases are regulated in a gtpase cycle by the following cellular proteins : gefs ( guanine nucleotide exchange factors ) activate rho proteins by gdp / gtp - exchange , gaps ( gtpase - activating proteins ) stimulate the intrinsic gtp hydrolysis , thereby accelerating inactivation .
gdis ( guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors ) predominantly bind the inactive form of rho gtpases blocking nucleotide exchange [ 6 ] .
active rho proteins interact with several effectors , which govern a variety of cellular processes including organization of the actin cytoskeleton .
consequently , cells treated with cnf1 show a strong network of actin stress fibers , filopodia and membrane ruffles [ 7 ] .
cnf1 belongs to a family of single chain ab - toxins with an n - terminal domain important for membrane translocation and the c - terminal catalytic domain encompassing deamidase activity .
the toxin is taken up into mammalian cells by receptor - mediated endocytosis .
it has been shown that the cytosolic precursor protein ( 37lrp ) of the non - integrin laminin receptor ( 67lr ) interacts with the n - terminus ( aa 1 - 342 ) of cnf1 in a yeast - two - hybrid - screen [ 8 ] .
processing of 37lrp to the mature , membrane localized 67lr is still unclear but may originate from homo - or hetero - dimerization of 37lrp with another 37lrp molecule or with galectin3 [ 9 ] .
moreover , it has been suggested by knockdown of 37lrp that 67lr mediates the uptake of cnf1 into cells [ 8 ] .
here , we identified the lutheran ( lu ) adhesion glycoprotein / basal cell adhesion molecule ( bcam ) as a cellular receptor for cnf1 and show that it is essential for the intoxication of cells .
the transmembrane adhesion molecule lu / bcam is a member of the immunoglobulin ( ig ) superfamily with five ig - like domains on the extracellular site , a single transmembrane domain and a short , c - terminal cytoplasmic tail .
this protein , like 67lr is a receptor for the extracellular matrix protein laminin .
two transcript variants , encoding different isoforms , have been found for this gene called lu and bcam .
the difference between lu and bcam is the length of the cytoplasmic tail ( 59 amino acids in lu and 19 amino acids in bcam ) , which is thought to mediate intracellular signaling because it contains an sh3 binding motif and 5 phosphorylation sites [ 10 ] .
lu / bcam binds to laminin alpha5 , which is the major laminin alpha - chain in the basement membrane [ 11 ] .
in humans , lu plays a role in vaso - occlusion of red blood cells ( rbcs ) in sickle cell patients .
in sickle cell rbcs , epinephrine increases a lu / bcam - mediated adhesion of the cells to laminin alpha5 in a camp and protein kinase a - dependent manner [ 12 ] .
however , lu / bcam is also expressed in many other cells and tissues with a strong appearance in epithelial and endothelial cells ( for review see [ 13 ] , [ 14 ]) .
we show that cnf1 binds to lu / bcam on mammalian cells and that this interaction is crucial for the uptake of the toxin .
the interaction of cnf1 with lu / bcam occurs within a region located in close proximity to the c - terminal catalytic domain , whereas the n - terminus of cnf1 interacts with the 37lrp precursor of the non - integrin laminin receptor [ 8 ] .
therefore , cnf1 seems to contact two different laminin binding proteins , using separate domains .
results identification of lu / bcam as receptor for cnf1 identification of the cellular receptor is a crucial task in understanding bacterial toxins .
for cnf1 it has been reported that the n - terminal 342 amino acids of the toxin interact with the 37 kda laminin receptor precursor ( 37lrp ) [ 8 ] .
this intracellular protein matures to the 67 kda cell surface - localized laminin receptor ( 67lr ) .
we confirmed a week interaction of cnf1 with 67lr by overlay assays ( not shown ) .
therefore , we used purified 67lr from cells , which secrete this receptor into the culture medium [ 15 ] .
however , some cell lines like rbl ( rat basophil leukemia ) or helas3 ( human cervix carcinoma , subclone 3 ) cells express 37lrp but are not intoxicated by cnf1 , suggesting that another structure on the cell surface may be necessary for efficient binding and endocytosis of the toxin .
in line with this , it has been shown , using monoclonal antibodies , that besides the n - terminal receptor binding domain , a second part of cnf1 is involved in binding to mammalian cells [ 16 ] .
we screened for cell surface protein receptors cnf1 binds to by incubating hela cells with a double - tagged gst - cnf1 - gst fusion protein at 4degreesc .
as controls we used gst alone or the analogue double - tagged form of the cnf family member cnfy ( gst - cnfy - gst , yersinia pseudotuberculosis toxin cnfy ) .
this toxin is known to interact with a different , yet unknown receptor on mammalian cells [ 17 ] .
following binding , we lysed the cells and precipitated the toxin together with associated molecules , using anti - gst magnetic beads .
eluates were separated on sds - page and the eluted proteins were subsequently identified by nanolc - ms / ms. the only hit unique to the cnf1 - precipitate was the lutheran ( lu ) adhesion glycoprotein / basal cell adhesion molecule ( bcam ) ( fig. s1 ) .
this surface protein has a large extracellular ig - like structure and is widely expressed .
interestingly , lu / bcam like the proposed cnf1 receptor 67lr interacts with laminin , suggesting that the receptor - binding domain of cnf1 could interact with both laminin binding structures on the cell surface .
to verify the cnf1 - lu / bcam interaction , we repeated the precipitation assay with hek293 ( fig. 1a ) and hela cells ( fig. 1b ) and analyzed the presence of lu / bcam in the precipitate by western - blotting with a specific antibody against lu / bcam .
as shown in fig. 1 , lu / bcam was exclusively co - precipitated with gst - cnf1 - gst but not with gst - cnfy - gst or gst alone .
notably , we could not detect 37lrp / 67lr in any lane by western - blotting although the protein was expressed in hela and in hek293 ( human embryonic kidney ) cells ( fig. s2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1003884.g001 figure 1 lu / bcam is co - precipitated with cnf1 but not with cnfy .
hek293 ( a ) or hela ( b ) cells were incubated with gst , gst - cnf1 - gst or gst - cnfy - gst as indicated for 20 min at 4degreesc .
cells were harvested and lysed and the gst proteins together with their bound interaction partners were pulled with anti - gst magnetic beads .
proteins were separated by sds - page and co - precipitated lu / bcam detected by western - blotting .
note that the major band for lu / bcam in the lysate runs at about 67 - kda .
the glycosylated , surface exposed protein runs at higher molecular weight .
shown is an example of at least 3 independent experiments .
we asked whether lu / bcam is an alternative receptor in the absence of 67lr or whether binding to lu / bcam is generally crucial for toxin uptake .
in the latter case , blocking the interaction of cnf1 with lu / bcam should inhibit the uptake of the toxin into cells .
uptake of cnf1 can be monitored by the shift of deamidated rhoa to higher molecular weight in sds - page [ 5 ] and by the morphological changes of cells induced by the toxin .
to this end , we performed competition experiments with recombinant bcam ( rbcam ) and cnf1 on hela cells .
we incubated the toxin with rbcam ( in a molar ratio cnf1 : rbcam of 1:1 , 1:10 and 1:100 , respectively ) for 20 min and then treated cells with the mixture .
as shown in fig. 2a , preincubation of cnf with rbcam inhibited uptake of the toxin in a concentration - dependent manner , indicating direct interaction of the proteins .
in a second approach , we blocked the binding of cnf1 to lu / bcam directly on the cell surface .
for these experiments , hela cells were treated with an anti lu / bcam antibody ( ab b12 ) that binds to the extracellular domain of lu / bcam .
as control we used an anti - lu / bcam antibody ( ab c16 ) directed against the intracellular part of the glycoprotein .
toxin uptake was determined by the amount of modified rhoa ( shift in sds - page ) after 2 h of incubation. fig. 2b shows that pre - incubation of cells with the antibody against lu / bcam extracellular domain inhibited the uptake of cnf1 , whereas the control antibody had no effect .
as expected , the antibodies added to the cells without the toxin had no effect .
the data indicate that binding of cnf1 to lu / bcam is required for the uptake of the toxin into cells .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1003884.g002 figure 2 competition and colocalization studies with hela cells .
gst - cnf1 was incubated with buffer or with recombinant bcam in a molar ratio cnf1 : rbcam of 1:1 , 1:10 and 1:100 , respectively for 20 min .
the mixture was added to hela cells .
following 2 h incubation the cells were lysed and the cnf1 - catalysed deamidation of rhoa was analyzed by the shift of the modified gtpase in sds - page by western - blotting ( a ) .
hela cells were incubated with an anti lu / bcam antibody ( ab b12 ) that binds to the extracellular domain or as control with an anti - lu / bcam antibody ( ab c16 ) directed against the intracellular part of the glycoprotein .
gst - cnf1 was then added to the cells for 2 h. we followed the toxins uptake by the amount of modified rhoa ( shift in sds - page , b ) .
shown is a typical result of 3 independent experiments .

after 30 min cells were transferred to 37degrees for 30 min to induce uptake .

shown is a typical staining of 9 hela cells analyzed .
colocalization of lu / bcam with cnf1 but not with cnfy to visualize cnf1 on the cell surface , we fluorescently labeled gst - cnf1 ( green ) and studied colocalization with lu / bcam using an antibody against the receptor and a second rhodamine labeled antibody ( red ) .
as negative control we used labeled gst - cnfy .
binding of the toxins was performed at 4degreesc and the cells incubated for further 30 min at 37degreesc to allow endocytosis .
the cells were fixed and stained for lu / bcam .
as shown in fig. 2c cnf1 colocalized with lu / bcam , whereas there was no colocalization of cnfy with this receptor .
colocalization occurred in vesicular structures .
it is known that cnf1 is released from endosomes following acidification [ 17 ] .
therefore , we confirmed the colocalization of cnf1 with the endosomal marker eea1 , which exclusively localizes to early endosomes .
for immunofluorescence we used an antibody against eea1 and a second rhodamine labeled antibody ( red ) .
as shown in fig. 2c ( top ) the toxin was localized to early endosomes .
lu / bcam is crucial for binding and uptake of cnf1 to corroborate the requirement of lu / bcam for toxin binding and / or uptake we made use of human immortalized myelogenous leukemia cells ( k562 ) , which do not express lu / bcam .
as control the same cell line stably expressing recombinant lu / bcam ( k562 - lu / bcam ) was employed [ 18 ] .
we verified expression of lu / bcam and analyzed the presence of 37lrp in the two cell - lines by western - blotting .
whereas 37lrp is expressed in both cell lines , lu / bcam could only be detected in k562 - lu / bcam but not in k562 cells ( fig. s2 ) .
to study the uptake of cnf1 , leukemia cells and lu / bcam - expressing cells were treated with the toxin for different time periods and , subsequently , the uptake of cnf was analyzed by the shift of modified rhoa .
the cnf1 - induced shift of rhoa was incomplete in k562 cells not expressing lu / bcam even after overnight intoxication ( fig. 3a , bottom ). by contrast , in lu / bcam expressing cells deamidation of rhoa occurred within 1 h ( fig. 3a , top ) .
apparently a low amount of toxin was taken up into the leukemia cells which do not express lu / bcam .
this may occur by unspecific pinocytosis or by binding to the 67lr present on both cell lines .
the data indicate that lu / bcam is essential for efficient uptake of cnf1 .
to further support this finding we performed competition experiments with rbcam and cnf1 on k562 - lu / bcam cells .
we pre - incubated the toxin with rbcam ( in a molar ratio cnf1 : rbcam of 1:1 , 1:10 and 1:100 , respectively ) for 20 min and treated the cells with the mixture .
as expected , preincubation of cnf with rbcam inhibited uptake of the toxin in a concentration - dependent manner ( fig. 3b ) .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1003884.g003 figure 3 cells not expressing lu / bcam do not respond to cnf1 .
a ) k562 leukemia cells , which do not express lu / bcam ( top ) and the isogenic cell line k562 - lu / bcam expressing the receptor ( bottom ) , were treated with gst - cnf1 for different time periods from 1 h to overnight ( on ) as indicated .
uptake of the toxin was analyzed by the shift of modified rhoa in sds - page .
b ) gst - cnf1 was incubated with buffer or with recombinant bcam in a molar ratio cnf1 : rbcam of 1:1 , 1:10 and 1:100 , respectively for 20 min .
the mixture was added to k562 - lu / bcam cells for 2 h. cells were lysed and the deamidation of rhoa was analyzed by the shift of the modified gtpase in sds - page by western - blotting .
data are representative for at least 3 independent experiments .
we intended to distinguish between binding and uptake of the toxin .
therefore , we performed fluorescence activated cell sorting ( facs ) analysis with dylight488 - labeled gst - cnf1 .
first , we added increasing amounts of labeled toxin to hela cells , incubated the cells for 15 min on ice and washed them with pbs .
afterwards we analyzed the fluorescence of the cells by facs measurements .
as expected , increasing concentrations of the labeled toxin shifted the cells to higher fluorescence , indicating specific binding of gst - cnf to the cells ( fig. s3 , left ) .
data from 3 independent experiments were quantified ( fig. s3 , right ) .
we further studied the toxin lu / bcam interaction and performed competition experiments firstly with recombinant bcam and in a second approach with antibodies .
we either used increasing amounts of an anti - lu / bcam antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the receptor or an antibody directed against 37lrp .
all competitors were used in increasing amounts ( molar ratio cnf1 : competitor from 1:0 to 1:50 , respectively as indicated ) .
the fluorescence decreased to lower levels in the presence of the competitors rbcam ( fig. 4a ) and anti - lu / bcam ( fig. 4b ) , respectively but not in the presence of a 50 - fold molar excess of anti - 37lrp ( fig. 4c ) .
whereas gst - cnf1 binding was decreased with recombinant bcam to about 25 % of control , the effect was less pronounced but significant with the antibody directed against lu / bcam .
no change in fluorescence was detected in the presence of the antibody against 37lrp .
the data indicate that the toxin specifically binds to lu / bcam .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1003884.g004 figure 4 cnf1 directly interacts with lu / bcam on the cell surface .
suspensions of hela cells (( a - c ) 1x105 cells in 1 ml medium ) were incubated for 20 min at 4degreesc with 2 microg dylight488 - labeled gst - cnf1 ( cnf1dl488 ) alone or together with increasing amounts of rbcam protein ( a ) .
cells were then washed in pbs and subjected to facs analysis .
the experiment was repeated with 2 microg dylight488 - labeled gst - cnf1 ( cnf1dl488 ) alone or together with increasing amounts of alphalu / bcam antibody ( molar ratio cnf : antibody up to 1:50 , * p < 0.05 ) ( b ) or a 50 - fold excess of the alphalrp antibody as indicated ( c ) .
data are presented as % fluorescence of control with cnf1dl488 set to 100 % .
non - ( d ) and lu / bcam - expressing ( e ) k562 cells were either left untreated ( mock ) or were incubated with 2 microg cnf1dl488 for 20 min at 4degreesc and , following washing with pbs , subjected to facs analysis .
results are presented as histogram plots , where single cell events are plotted against cell surface - bound fluorescence ( log fl intensity ) .
to verify binding of the toxin to lu / bcam , we performed facs analysis with k562 cells ( fig. 4d ) and with receptor expressing k562 - lu / bcam cells ( fig. 4e ) .
at first cells were incubated with dylight488 - labeled gst - cnf1 ( 2 microg / ml ) , washed and analyzed .
in line with our precipitation experiments , k562 cells only marginally shifted to higher fluorescence , whereas the k562 - lu / bcam cells showed a broad spectrum of fluorescent cells ranging from low to high fluorescence .
the latter may correspond to the degree of lu / bcam overexpression in these cells , which seems to vary from cell to cell .
pre - incubation of labeled gst - cnf1 with rbcam concordantly reduced the amount of toxin bound to these cells but did not completely block cnf - binding .
this effect may be based on the high amount of lu / bcam expressed .
role of lu / bcam glycosylation lu / bcam is known to be modified by glycosylation .
four n - glycosylation sites have been identified , which account for approximately 15 % weight composition of the protein [ 13 ] .
some bacterial toxins are recruited to cellular membranes by binding to sugar chains before a high affinity interaction with a surface protein occurs .
this has been shown for example for tetanus neurotoxin [ 19 ] .
in our co - precipitation assay ( fig. 1 ) only the high molecular weight form of lu / bcam was enriched by binding to cnf1 , whereas the lower molecular weight form was not precipitated with cnf , although it appeared as the most prominent band in the lysate .
this indicates that n - glycosylation may be important for interaction with the toxin .
therefore , we tested , whether n - glycosylation of lu / bcam plays a role for cnf1 binding .
the recombinant bcam used in this study was purified from lu / bcam - overexpressing mammalian cells .
the protein is fully glycosylated .
we treated recombinant bcam with pngasef and analyzed deglycosylation by sds - page .
deglycosylated rbcam should run lower according to its lower molecular weight .
as shown in fig. s4a , pngasef - treated rbcam runs at a lower molecular weight ( 67 kda ) as compared with the glycosylated rbcam ( 84 kda ) .
this is indicative of effective deglycosylation [ 14 ] .
we spotted cnf1 on nitrocellulose and repeated the overlay assay as described above with glycosylated recombinant bcam and pngasef - treated deglycosylated rbcam .
in this assay cnf1 still interacts with deglycosylated rbcam ( fig. s4b ) .
moreover , treatment of cells with pngasef and subsequent facs - analysis revealed that the toxin binds with even higher affinity to the cells ( fig. s4c ) .
this may be due to a higher accessibility of the protein part of the receptor .
the data indicate that n - glycosylation is not necessary for the interaction of cnf1 with lu / bcam .
the exclusive precipitation of the high molecular weight form of the protein from cells may indicate that this is the surface exposed form of lu / bcam .
defining the cnf1 - lu / bcam interaction site two sites of cnf1 have been described to be necessary for its interaction with mammalian cells : the n - terminal receptor binding domain ( aa 1 - 342 , [ 16 ]) and a small part of cnf1 adjacent to the catalytic domain ( aa 683 - 730 , [ 16 ]) .
to narrow down the region of cnf1 , which interacts with lu / bcam , at first we studied direct protein - protein interaction .
we performed dot - blot and surface plasmon resonance ( biacore ) studies with recombinant bcam and several cnf1 fragments .
additionally , we used the cnf - family member cnfy , which is identical in length and shares amino acid identity to cnf1 of 61 % ( cnfy ) [ 20 ] .
all proteins were tested for correct folding / activity in an in vitro rho shift assay , which indicates deamidation of recombinant rhoa .
as expected , only the n - terminal fragment of cnf1 ( aa 1 - 342 ) , which does not contain the catalytic domain , did not catalyze the deamidation of rhoa ( fig. s5 ) .
for dot - blots , we spotted 3 microm solutions of gst - cnfs , gst - cnf fragments and gst alone , respectively , onto nitrocellulose .
after membrane blockage , recombinant bcam was added and bound rbcam was detected using anti - bcam antibody .
equal protein load was analyzed by visualizing the gst part of the spotted proteins with an anti gst - antibody .
as shown in fig. 5a - top , significantly more rbcam bound to cnf1 as compared with cnfy .
in contrast , rbcam did not interact with gst .
the data indicate that cnf1 binds with higher affinity to rbcam as compared to cnfy .
this is in line with previous competition experiments , which indicate that cnf1 and cnfy apparently bind to a different receptor [ 17 ] , [ 20 ] .
moreover , the binding site seems to be located in close proximity to the catalytic domain .
the cnf1 fragments 426 - 1014 , 709 - 1014 and 720 to 1014 exhibited strong binding to rbcam , indicating that amino acids 720 to 1014 of cnf1 are sufficient for the interaction with this receptor ( 5a - bottom ) .
in contrast , the n - terminal part ( aa 1 - 342 ) , which was previously suggested to be responsible for cnf - receptor interaction , did not interact with rbcam .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1003884.g005 figure 5 direct rbcam - cnf interaction .
a ) for dot - blots 5 microl of 3 microm solutions of gst - cnfs , gst - cnf fragments and gst alone , respectively , were spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane .
the membrane was blocked with skimmed milk and recombinant bcam ( 6 microm ) was added for 1 h at room temperature .
following washing bound rbcam was detected with an anti - lu / bcam antibody .
equal protein load was analyzed by visualizing the gst part of the spotted proteins with an anti gst - antibody .
b ) biacore protein - protein interaction studies : an antibody against human igg ( millipore ) was coupled to two lanes of a cm5 - biacore chip .
as ligand recombinant bcam containing a c - terminal human igg domain ( sino biologics ) was exclusively guided over lane 2 .
in a second step , gst - cnf proteins as analyte were guided over both lanes .
bound protein is given as relative units ( ru ) corrected for the unspecific binding to lane 1 as average plus standard deviation of three independent experiments .
for quantitative analysis of the protein - protein interaction we used plasmon resonance spectroscopy ( biacore ) .
for these studies we used recombinant lu / bcam , which contains a c - terminal human igg domain for purification ( sino biology ) .
we covalently coupled an antibody against human igg to two lanes of a cm5 - biacore chip .
for analysis of the rbcam - cnf1 interaction , rbcam as ligand ( only to lane 2 ) and in a second step , cnf proteins as analyte ( both lanes ) were guided over the lanes .
this allows for correction of unspecific protein binding to the antibody .
in fig. 5b bound protein is given as relative units ( ru ) corrected for the unspecific binding to lane 1 .
the data show that the strongest binding to rbcam occurs with the full - length toxin and with the c - terminal part of cnf1 , whereas no interaction with rbcam could be detected with cnfy or with the n - terminal part of cnf1 ( aa 1 - 342 ) .
the fragment 426 - 1014 was weaker in its interaction to lu / bcam as compared to the c - terminal fragments 709 - 1014 or 720 - 1014 .
the difference between cnf1 ( aa 426 - 1014 ) and the shorter fragment may be based on different protein stability or better accessibility of the receptor binding domain in the shorter fragments which needs further investigation .
the data suggest that the interaction site of cnf1 with lu / bcam is located within amino acids 720 to 1014 and does not occur with the n - terminus ( aa 1 - 342 ) .
to confirm these results , we repeated the facs experiments as described above with labeled gst - cnf1 and increasing amounts of unlabeled cnf1 fragments ( molar ratio cnf1 : competitor from 1:0 to 1:30 , respectively as indicated ) .
moreover , we used untagged cnf1 for competition .
as expected , the c - terminal fragments of the toxin ( aa 709 - 1014 and aa 720 - 1014 ) were able to inhibit binding of cnf1 to the cells whereas pre - incubation with the n - terminus ( aa 1 - 342 ) had no effect ( fig. 6 ) .
in line with the dot - blot analysis , the fragment 426 - 1014 was weaker in its interaction to lu / bcam as compared to the c - terminal fragments .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1003884.g006 figure 6 cnf1 binds to the cell surface via a c - terminal peptide .
suspensions of hela cells ( 1x105 cells in 1 ml medium ) were incubated for 20 min at 4degreesc with 2 microg dylight488 - labeled gst - cnf1 ( cnf1dl488 ) alone , or together with increasing amounts ( up to 30 fold ) of untagged non - labeled cnf1 and the non - labeled fragments gst - cnf1 - ( 426 - 1014 ) , gst - cnf1 - ( 720 - 1014 ) , gst - cnf1 - ( 709 - 1014 ) and gst - cnf1 - ( 1 - 343 ) , respectively .
following washing with pbs , cells were subjected to facs analysis .
results are presented as mean of cell surface - bound fluorescence (% of control ) of three independent experiments + standard deviation .
cnf1 without the n - terminus is not sufficient for the intoxication of cells the catalytic part of cnf1 has been localized to amino acids 720 to 1014 [ 21 ] .
our data show that the binding site of the toxin to lu / bcam is located adjacent to this part and even overlap .
therefore , we tested , whether the toxin deleted for the n - terminus but containing a translocation domain , receptor binding and catalytic part may be sufficient for intoxication of cells .
we incubated hela cells with the cnf1 fragment ( aa 343 to 1014 ) , which contains the catalytic domain , the lu / bcam binding site and additionally the two hydrophobic regions h1 and h2 suggested to mediate insertion into the endosomal membrane [ 22 ] .
we lysed the cells and analyzed the modification of rhoa using the rho shift assay .
even a high amount of the toxin part ( 1,5 microm ) added to mammalian cells was not sufficient to intoxicate the cells ( not shown ) .
this indicates that besides the cnf1 - lu / bcam interaction , binding to p37lrp is required for the intoxication of the cells .
one explanation could be that the protein is not released into the cytosol .
however , further experiments are required , to analyze this feature .
our data are summarized in fig. 7. 10.1371 / journal.ppat.1003884.g007 figure 7 summary of the cnf1 domain structure .
cnf1 consists of 1014 amino acids .
we found amino acids 1 - 342 responsible for interaction with the laminin receptor precursor ( 37lrp ) .
binding to lu / bcam occurs with amino acids 720 to 1014 .
data from the literature suggest amino acids 683 - 730 to mediate binding to mammalian cells [ 16 ] indicating this part to be responsible for bcam binding ( white box , rbd ) .
the c - domain represents the catalytic part of the toxin .
the two hydrophobic helices ( h1 and h2 ) are crucial for insertion into the endosomal membrane .
discussion our study sheds new light on the uptake mechanism of the bacterial toxin cnf1 .
it is widely accepted that the toxin enters the cytosol of mammalian cells from endosomes , following receptor - mediated endocytosis [ 23 ] .
inhibition of endosome acidification with bafilomycin a completely blocks intoxication of cultured cells [ 17 ] , [ 24 ] .
here , we identified lu / bcam as a crucial receptor for the toxin .
for precipitation of cnf1 - interacting proteins , we used a method recently employed for the identification of the alpha - toxin receptor [ 25 ] .
following binding to the surface of living hela cells and subsequent lysis , we isolated the toxin - protein complexes , using magnetic beads .
this method ensures correct folding and orientation of membrane proteins during toxin binding .
moreover , intracellular proteins and cytosolic domains of membrane proteins are excluded as interaction partners .
maldi - tof analysis of the precipitate identified lu / bcam as interaction partner for cnf1 .
we verified cnf1 lu / bcam interaction by several methods : western - blotting revealed that lu / bcam was exclusively co - precipitated with cnf1 but not with cnfy .
second , dot - blot analysis with several cnf1 fragments and recombinant bcam delineated the site of interaction to the c - terminus ( aa 720 to 1014 ) .
finally , we supported our findings with surface plasmon resonance measurements ( biacore ) .
in this system we were not able to displace cnf1 from bcam using several conditions like high salt buffer ( 500 mm nacl , 20 mm tris / hcl , ph 7.4 ) basic or acidic buffer ( 50 mm naoh , 10 mm glycine , ph 2.5 ) .
therefore , it was not possible to calculate the dissociation constant ( kd ) of the rbcam - cnf interaction .
binding to lu / bcam occurred with amino acids 720 - 1014 with comparable affinity as determined for the full - length protein .
using facs analysis , we show that this part of the toxin is sufficient for interaction with the cell surface .
moreover , it is sensitive for competition with antibodies against lu / bcam or with an excess of recombinant bcam .
in previous studies the non - integrin laminin receptor precursor 37lrp has been identified as interaction partner for the n - terminal part of cnf1 in a yeast two - hybrid screen [ 8 ] .
this part has been suggested as the toxins receptor binding domain , because an excess of a corresponding cnf1 peptide incubated together with full - length cnf1 blocks intoxication of cells [ 21 ] .
in line with this , the n - terminal binding partner 37lrp / 67lr seems to be required for the action of the toxin .
it has been shown that 37lrp / 67lr is important for intoxication of mammalian cells and for the opening of the brain barrier in a mouse model [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
no direct binding to the cell surface was proven and p37lrp / p67 may have other functions like transport into the cell .
surprisingly , we could not find any interaction with lu / bcam and the previously suggested n - terminal receptor binding site .
this suggests that 37lrp / 67lr and lu / bcam are not alternative receptors , although they are both laminin - binding proteins .
we found lu / bcam to be crucial for binding , because cells deficient in lu / bcam but expressing lrp could not bind labeled cnf1 .
this indicates that 37lrp / 67lr is not sufficient for toxin binding .
therefore , we conclude that 37lrp / 67lr and lu / bcam are both required for toxin action but with different functions .
we suggest two interaction sites in cnf1 : the n - terminus binding to 37lrp / 67lr as postulated by kim [ 8 ] , [ 26 ] and the c - terminus ( probably a region around amino acids 683 - 730 , [ 16 ]) binding with high affinity to lu / bcam .
in line with this , two different cell interaction sites of cnf1 have been identified by mcnichol and coworkers , which both are necessary for efficient intoxication of cells [ 16 ] .
our data show that lu / bcam is required for toxin binding .
however , it is not sufficient for intoxication of mammalian cells , since cnf1 deleted for the n - terminal 342 amino acids can bind to cells but is not able to intoxicate them .
what is the role of the n - terminus and its interaction with 37lrp / 67lr ?
we observed that the n - terminal part of cnf1 forms sds stable tetramers , although only a small fraction of the purified protein was found in the oligomer - band ( data not shown ) .
further studies are required to analyze a possible oligomerization of cnf1 .
we speculate that 37lrp / 67lr may bind to the pre - formed oligomer and may play a crucial role for the uptake of cnf1 into the cytosol .
initial binding of the toxin to the cell surface requires lu / bcam .
it remains to be analyzed , whether interaction of an oligomer is required for pore - formation in the endosomal membrane and / or for transport of the catalytic domain into the cytosol .
taken together , we present a novel model of the action of cnf1 , which is outlined in fig. 7. we suggest that cnf1 binds to the surface of mammalian cells with its receptor binding domain located adjacent to the catalytic domain .
the crystal structure of the catalytic domain ( aa 720 - 1014 ) reveals an additional helix ( aa 720 to 734 ) sticking out of the otherwise globular structure ( 735 to 1014 ) .
this part does not directly contribute to the catalytic core domain of the toxin [ 28 ] but may connect the receptor binding domain of cnf1 with the catalytic domain or even is part of the lu / bcam interaction site .
further studies are required to analyze this important feature .
we have shown recently that cleavage of cnf1 enhances its biologic activity and that this cleavage does not occur in the cytosol but either on the cell surface or within endosomes [ 29 ] .
two surface binding sites ( one at the n - terminus and the other near the c - terminus ) would allow toxin cleavage on the membrane / vesicle surface without losing the interaction of separated toxin parts .
this allows subsequent pore formation and translocation .
thus , while some toxins ( e.g. , diphtheria toxin ) are functionally connected by ss - bridges , cnf might use two cell surface binding sites for efficient up - take .

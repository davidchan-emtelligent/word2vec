immunosenescence refers to age - related declines in the capacity to respond to infections such as influenza ( flu ) .
caloric restriction represents a known strategy to slow many aging processes , including those involving the immune system .
more recently , some changes in the microbiome have been described with aging , while the gut microbiome appears to influence responses to flu vaccination and infection. with these considerations in mind , we used a well - established mouse model of flu infection to explore the impact of flu infection , aging , and caloric restriction on the gut microbiome .
young , middle - aged , and aged caloric restricted ( cr ) and ad lib fed ( al ) mice were examined after a sublethal flu infection .
all mice lost 10 - 20 % body weight and , as expected for these early time points , losses were similar at different ages and between diet groups .
cytokine and chemokine levels were also similar with the notable exception of il - 1alpha , which rose more than fivefold in aged al mouse serum , while it remained unchanged in aged cr serum .
fecal microbiome phyla abundance profiles were similar in young , middle - aged , and aged al mice at baseline and at 4 days post flu infection , while increases in proteobacteria were evident at 7 days post flu infection in all three age groups .
cr mice , compared to al mice in each age group , had increased abundance of proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia at all time points .
interestingly , principal coordinate analysis determined that diet exerts a greater effect on the microbiome than age or flu infection .
percentage body weight loss correlated with the relative abundance of proteobacteria regardless of age , suggesting flu pathogenicity is related to proteobacteria abundance .
further , several microbial operational taxonomic units from the bacteroidetes phyla correlated with serum chemokine / cytokines regardless of both diet and age suggesting an interplay between flu - induced systemic inflammation and gut microbiota .
these exploratory studies highlight the impact of caloric restriction on fecal microbiome in both young and aged animals , as well as the many complex relationships between flu responses and gut microbiota .
thus , these preliminary studies provide the necessary groundwork to examine how gut microbiota alterations may be leveraged to influence declining immune responses with aging .
aging influenza gut microbiome caloric restriction cytokines office of extramural research , national institutes of health10.13039 / 100006955ag021600 introduction aging is a complex process that has dramatic impacts on most systems in the body ( 1 ) .
this is especially true of the immune system where significant age - related changes are observed in both innate and adaptive immune responses .
one of the most prominent manifestations of aging is an increase in susceptibility to infections .
in fact , influenza infection is one of the top killers of elderly people in the world , with the oldest being most at risk ( 2 , 3 ) .
in aging mouse models , the clearance of influenza virus is slower and t cell responses are reduced and delayed when compared to young mice , which closely mirrors what happens during influenza infection of elderly humans ( 4 - 7 ) .
in addition , our recent study demonstrated that there are lingering inflammatory cytokines such as il - 6 , il - 1alpha , and g - csf in the bronchiolar lavage fluid ( bal ) of aged mice during influenza infection .
we have also shown that there is an increasing level of albumin in the bal of aged mice , which is indicative of lung damage during the later stages of infection ( 8 ) .
these results indicate that the inability to efficiently clear virus in aged lungs corresponds to extended inflammation and lung damage .
one of the most consistent ways to delay aging in mice is via caloric restriction ( cr ) .
indeed , cr was first shown to extend the lifespan of rodents in the 1930s ( 9 ) and has since been observed across multiple species , ranging from invertebrates to rodents to even some non - human primate studies ( 10 - 13 ) ; however , it is important to note that this is not observed in all studies ( 14 - 19 ) suggesting some mechanisms of longevity with cr may not be conserved among species and that details of implementation likely effect outcomes .
despite these discrepancies , and more importantly , along with extending lifespan , cr has been shown to delay age - related deficits in multiple physiological systems in mice ( 20 - 25 ) , seemingly targeting the process of aging itself. from a translational perspective , human cr studies assessing longevity are nearly impossible , and short term studies evaluating other healthspan measures are difficult to control and criticized for practicality ( please refer to ref. ( 26 ) for a recent review of human cr trials ) .
regardless of these limitations , results from both population studies ( 27 ) , as well as the comprehensive assessment of long - term effects of reducing intake of energy ( 28 - 30 ) and caloric restriction with optimal nutrition ( 31 , 32 ) studies show benefits in some areas , albeit not in all aspects of cr in rodent trials , suggesting cr does hold value within human aging research .
moreover , the benefits to multiple different systems evident in rodent studies makes it an attractive avenue to pursue .
it is important to note that cr in these cases is not malnutrition ( although feed is generally reduced by 40 % caloric content , it is fortified with micronutrients to prevent deficiencies ) , and it is normally introduced after mice have reached maturation .
there are many hypotheses for the mechanism of action of cr , including modulation of glucose - insulin homeostasis , growth hormone axis , autophagy changes , and alteration of inflammatory pathways ; however , it is likely many of these changes may act in concert to delay aging .
nonetheless , cr has consistently shown improvement in multiple facets of aging , including delaying immunosenescence ( 33 - 37 ) .
most notably , cr attenuates the shift from naive to memory phenotype observed in t cells with aging ( 38 ) and maintains the proliferative capacity of t cells ( 39 , 40 ) .
despite these positive effects on the aged immune system , the effects of cr on immune responses to influenza with aging is not clear .
original studies by effros et al .
( 41 ) demonstrated that cr could enhance the immune response in aged mice ameliorating age - related declines in t cell proliferation and antibody production in response to intraperitoneal immunization to influenza .
conversely , work from gardner and colleagues ( 42 - 45 ) demonstrated increased severity of infection in aged cr mice with increased viral titers and mortality in response to intranasal influenza infection attributed to impaired nk cell responses ( 43 , 44 ) and / or reduced energy reserves and lethal weight loss ( 46 ) .
however , in these studies , high doses of influenza were utilized with mortality even observed in young mice ; thus , it is unclear how cr modulates the immune response to more sublethal doses of influenza .
more recently , the importance of the microbiome in regulating immune responses has been elucidated .
the gut microbiota have regulatory effects on not only intestinal immunity but also systemic immune responses ( 47 ) and systemic t cell subset populations can be skewed by different microbiota predominance ( 48 - 51 ) .
further , pulmonary immunity is directly affected by the gut microbiota with regards to both allergic airway ( 52 ) and infectious disease ( 53 , 54 ) responses .
importantly , the gut microbiota plays a major role in mediating flu infection - related immune responses and is particularly crucial for respiratory tract dcs migration , t cell priming , cytokine secretion , and overall viral clearance ( 53 ) .
dysbiosis of the gut microbiota induced by antibiotic administration during flu infection influences helper t cell responses and can negatively impact flu outcomes and recovery ( 55 ) .
in addition , influenza infection itself induces gut microbiota dysbiosis through type i interferons ( ifn - i ) favoring proteobacteria overgrowth ( 56 ) .
thus , the relationship between gut microbiota and influenza infection seems complex and integrated .
furthering this line of thought , the gut microbiome also changes with age [ recently reviewed in ref. ( 57 , 58 )] .
more specifically , there seems to be a general decrease in microbiota diversity with aging ( 59 , 60 ) , as well as an increase in proteobacteria abundance and lower levels of firmicutes ( 59 - 63 ) .
also , a shift toward a more bacteroidetes dominated microbiome was associated with frailty ( 61 ) .
it is unknown how these changes to gut microbiota with aging may influence immune responses .
cr also impacts the microbiome with greater levels of lactobacillus and other potential probiotics associated with longevity ( 64 ) .
but importantly , the influence of gut bacteria microbiota changes on age - related pathologies has yet to be determined .
it is possible that gut microbiota changes with cr may be a potential mechanism of longevity and / or related to some of the " antiaging " effects evident in many murine studies .
it is known that different components of nutrition can affect the aged immune system [ reviewed elsewhere ( 65 )] and that prebiotic / probiotic supplementation may decrease the severity of infection in the elderly ( 66 - 69 ) .
moreover , small - scale studies have indicated that specific probiotics and prebiotics may improve flu vaccine response in hospitalized elderly ( 70 - 73 ) suggesting that age - related alterations in gut microbiota may precipitate reduced flu responses in the elderly , and that this dysbiosis can be treated to improve immune responses .
indeed , depletion of specific gut microbiota through antibiotic treatment can negatively affect both dc ( 53 ) and t cell ( 53 , 55 ) influenza immune responses , while the gut microbiota itself is affected by influenza infection through type i interferons ( ifn - i ) ( 56 ) , thus the relationship between gut microbiota and influenza infection is bidirectional and warrants further investigation .
here , in this exploratory study , we sought to examine how cr , a known modulator of aging and gut microbiota , can influence influenza - induced gut microbiota changes and immune responses during acute influenza infection in young , middle , and aged c57bl / 6 mice .
we hypothesized that cr would protect aged mice from age - related gut microbiota changes and thus mitigate influenza - induced changes to gut microbiota and improve immune responses .
materials and methods mice young ( 5 - 6 months old ) , middle ( 9 - 10 months old ) , and aged ( 19 - 21 months old ) caloric restricted ( cr ) and ad libitum ( al ) c57bl / 6 male mice from the national institute on aging caloric restricted rodent colony were obtained at least 6 weeks prior to experimentation to allow appropriate acclimation to our facility .
cr mice were fed the nih31 fortified diet with cr was initiated at 14 weeks of age at 10 % restriction , increased to 25 % restriction at 15 weeks , and to 40 % restriction at 16 weeks where it was maintained throughout the life of the animal .

all mice were singly housed in a climate controlled environment with 12:12 light : dark cycle and water was provided ad libitum .
for all analyses , 2 - 3 mice per group were analyzed .
due to the closing of the nia caloric restricted rodent colony , we were unable to obtain more mice for experiments and thus the results presented are preliminary insights into the ability of cr to modulate gut microbiota and influenza responses with aging .

results the goal of this study was to explore the interaction of aging , diet , and influenza infection with the gut microbiome .
we aimed to gain preliminary insight into how aging may impact influenza - induced microbiome changes , as well as how age - related microbiome changes may impact influenza responses .
the first part of the study examined how age and cr impact the response to flu , while the second part examined the effect on the composition of gut microbiome .
for these studies , we employed a sublethal infection dose and examined immune parameters at 7 days postinfection .
at this time point , influenza - induced weight loss becomes more evident , however , is not different between ages ( 80 ) or cr and al groups ( unpublished experiments from the haynes lab ) .
thus , percent weight loss should not be a confounding factor between groups and should not put cr mice at greater risk to succumb to infection ( 45 , 46 ) .
while this limits the observed differences between groups due to infection , it allows us to assess early time points where the gut microbiome may play a role .
additionally , since it is known that weight loss itself affects gut microbiota ( 81 - 83 ) , this control was necessary to gain preliminary insight into influenza - induced alterations .
effect of age and cr on the response to influenza infection weight loss was monitored throughout the experiment .
figure 1a shows that there were no significant differences in percent weight loss in any of the groups regardless of age or diet .
in addition , figure 1b shows that on day 7 postinfection , there was no significant difference in the amount of flu virus in the lungs in each group .
these correlate well with our previous studies showing that the main age - related differences in response to sublethal influenza infection are not seen during the peak of the infection during the first week , but become apparent during the resolution phase in week two following flu infection ( 8 ) .
figure 1 response to influenza infection .
young , middle - aged , and aged c57bl6 mice on an ad libitum ( al ) or caloric - restricted ( cr ) diet were anesthetized and infected with 400 eid50 of influenza virus .
( a ) each day , mice were weighed and the percent of the starting weight is shown .
on day 7 postinfection , mice were sacrificed .
( b ) mrna was isolated from the lungs and influenza virus was quantitated by real - time pcr measuring influenza polymerase acidic protein gene ( pa ) copy number .
( c ) bronchiolar lavage fluid and ( d ) serum was collected and subjected to multiplex analysis to determine levels of cytokines and chemokines .
data were analyzed via two - way anova with bonferroni post hoc corrections ; * p < 0.05 .
the bal fluid from each mouse was analyzed for cytokine and chemokine contents .
as shown in figure 1c , there were no significant differences in cytokines important for a protective immune response to influenza infection including gcsf , ifngamma , il - 1alpha , il - 6 , and tnf .
in addition , there were no significant differences in chemokines that recruit protective immune cells to the lungs including ccl3 , ccl4 , ccl5 , cxcl1 , and cxcl10 .
a similar pattern was also observed when the serum from these groups was analyzed ( figure 1d ) except for a significant increase in il - 1alpha in the aged al group that was not seen in aged cr mice .
thus , both locally in the bal and systemically in the serum , there are few measurable differences between the response to infection in young , middle aged , and aged groups and between al and cr groups at this relatively early time point following flu infection .
effect of age and cr on the gut microbiome during influenza infection it is known that gut microbiome is affected by influenza viral infection ( 56 ) .
to fully understand the dynamics of this process and its implication , stool samples were collected prior to and during influenza infection .
analysis was done by reconstruction of the gut bacterial microbiome by amplicon sequencing to access the composition of the microbiota population .
figure 2a shows the relative abundance of nine bacterial phyla in each experimental group .
while there are no major age - related differences apparent in phylum level , there are differences due to influenza infection and diet .
in each age category , the distribution of phyla is changed by day 7 postinfection in both al and cr groups , characterized by an increase in proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia .
furthermore , proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia are more abundant in the cr groups when compared to al in each age category .
figure 2b shows the bray curtis dissimilarity of samples indicating they segregate by diet but not by infection in each age group , this implies that diet had a greater impact on the composition of gut microbiome when compared to the impact of influenza infection .

relative abundance of bacteria is shown as a fraction .
( b ) pcoa plot of bray curtis dissimilarity prior to ( naive , - 3 - 0 dpi ) and after ( postinfection , 4 - 7 dpi ) flu infection .
similar to a previous report ( 56 ) , we observed increased phylum proteobacteria in all groups at day 7 post influenza infection .
we determined that regardless of age , the relative abundance of phylum proteobacteria was positively correlated with percent body weight loss at this time in al and cr ( r = 0.8095 , p = 0.0218 and r = 0.8333 , p = 0.0154 ; respectively , figures 3a,b ) indicating a relationship between severity of infection and proteobacteria abundance .
to further examine the relationship between flu pathogenicity and gut microbiota abundances , we examined this relationship among all groups and major otus .
this approach increases the overall sample size ( n = 17 ) to increase the power of our correlation analysis and provide preliminary insight into potential key bacteria associated with flu responses regardless of age and diet .
ten specific otus correlated with percent weight loss , and interestingly , alistipes otu 34 and parabacteroides otu 9 , both members of the bacteroidetes phyla showed the strongest relationship ( r = 0.8235 , p < 0.0001 and r = 0.7672 , p = 0.0005 ; respectively , figures 3c,d ) , while another bacteroidetes , hallella out _ 11 was the next strongest relationship , however , was negatively correlated with percent weight loss ( r = - 0.5907 , p = 0.0216 , figure 3e ) ; highlighting differential relationships within phyla .
next , we examined the relationship between serum cytokine / chemokines and major otus observed among all groups to determine how influenza - induced inflammation relates to bacterial abundances ( figure 4 ) .
we observed 22 significant correlations between relative bacterial abundance and inflammatory mediators in the serum. of note , cxcl1 was positively correlated with unclassified lachnospiraceae otu _ 12 , alistipes otu 26 , and bacteroides otu _ 29 , ccl2 was positively correlated with parabacteroides otu _ 9 , alistipes otu _ 34 , and unclassified clostridiales otu _ 25 , and tnfalpha was positively correlated with unclassified alpha - proteobacteria otu _ 2 , butyrivibrio otu _ 28 , unclassified clostridiales otu _ 30 , and lachnospiraceae incertae sedis otu _ 37 .
conversely , cxcl10 was negatively correlated with unclassified porphyromonadaceae otu _ 1 and parasutterella otu _ 18 , and ccl5 is negatively correlated with barnesiella otu _ 3 , butyrivibrio otu _ 28 , unclassified porphyromonadaceae otu _ 27 , allobaculum otu _ 35 , and anaerostipes otu _ 40 .
among those correlations we observed , the three strongest positive correlations were cxcl1 with bacteroides otu _ 29 , ccl2 with parabacteroides otu _ 9 , and ccl2 with alistipes otu _ 34 .
the three strongest negative correlation were ccl3 with prevotella otu _ 8 , ccl5 with unclassified porphyromonadaceae otu _ 27 , and ccl5 with butyrivibrio otu _ 19 .
thus , systemic immune responses were related to gut microbiota alterations .
interestingly , aside from butyrivibrio , the strongest correlations , both positive and negative , were bacteroidetes .
though it is not possible to conclude any causal relations between these bacteria taxa and the correlated host response , these findings provide insight into future research in manipulating bacterial gut microbiome to facilitate antiviral immune responses .

discussion in this exploratory study , we sought to obtain preliminary information as to how cr , a known modulator of aging and gut microbiota , could influence influenza - induced gut microbiota changes and immune responses during acute influenza infection in young , middle aged , and aged mice .
different outcomes of influenza infection , due to the influence of aging and cr , could be mediated by modulation of the gut microbiota by these factors with subsequent effects of infection due to the different microbial communities .
we observed that cr affected the gut microbial communities ( figure 2 ) , as found in previous studies , and that age also has an effect ( the different patterns in figure 2b ) .
however , no obvious effect of infection was observed ( figure 2 ) .
unlike previous studies ( 41 , 45 ) , we did not observe significant differences in weight loss or viral burden following influenza infection in cr aged animals .
however , our study differed in that we utilized a sublethal dose of influenza and sacrificed mice at a relatively early point of infection , and both of these could contribute to a lessening of the effect of infection on the microbiome .
although there was not a large effect on microbial community structure following infection , we did observe an increase in the proportion of proteobacteria , which was more significant in cr mice but independent of age ( figure 2a ) .
the increase in the proportion of proteobacteria was correlated with weight loss ( figure 3 ) , taken as a marker of infection severity .
this again was independent of age .
further , multiple otus correlated with weight loss from the bacteroidetes phyla .
this connection raises the possibility that a change in the microbiome has a connection with infection outcome , as hypothesized above ; however , the relationship does not seem to be straight forward and members of the same phyla have differential relationships .
future research can examine if elimination or transfer of these specific bacteria can impact flu responses .
indeed , others have shown antibiotic treatment is detrimental to flu immune responses , specifically oral neomycin eliminated gram - positive bacteria and impaired immune responses ( 53 ) .
here , we identify gram - negative bacteria that may also be crucial for immune responses .
the pr8 strain of influenza virus used for these studies will not directly infect gut tissue of b6 mice ( 84 ) , raising the question of how a respiratory infection can affect the gut microbiome .
the mucosal surfaces in lung and gut are considered a common mucosal surface that share immunological signals ( 85 ) , so inflammation from one site is likely to affect the other site .
since proteobacteria are generally observed during gut inflammation ( 86 ) , the more severe infection in the lung , the greater the effect on the gut , and this would result in the observed correlation between proteobacteria ( a measure of inflammation in the gut ) and weight loss ( a measure of infection ) .
finally , we note that overgrowth of proteobacteria can be impaired by blocking the type i interferon ( ifn - i ) signal ( 56 ) , suggesting this gut microbiota change correlated with lung inflammation is mediated by an ifn - i - related immune response .
the gut is believed to be the largest immunological compartment in the body ( 87 ) and thus signaling from the gut microbiome may play an important role in viral infections .
for example , mouse mammary tumor virus ( 88 ) and enteric virus ( 89 ) require intestinal bacterial flora to establish effective infection .
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and influenza virus ( 90 ) , conversely , will trigger a more effective immune response if intestinal bacterial flora is present .
also , germ - free mice ( 91 ) , mice treated with an antibiotic cocktail ( 53 ) , or tlr5 ko mice ( with impaired function in sensing bacterial flagellin ) ( 92 ) will not generate adequate immune response to influenza viral infection .
thus , the microbiome helps protect during flu infection .
although here we show a correlation between proteobacteria abundance and infection , each member of the microbiota may signal the immune system in a different manner ( 93 ) .
for example , a previous report ( 53 ) showed that a host with antibiotic treatment to largely deplete lachnospiraceae would not generate a good antibody response against trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine .
similarly , we noticed that higher relative abundance of genus lachnospiraceae otu _ 12 and otu _ 32 are correlated with higher amount of cxcl1 and il - 1alpha , respectively .
more generally , we show here that cytokine production associated with flu infection in our study correlates differently for each of 22 otus ( figure 4 ) .
this suggests that members of the microbiome regulate the immune response in different ways .
these preliminary findings contribute to the understanding of dynamics and complexity of gut bacterial microbiota and influenza infection .
we are the first to show the early changes ( day 4 post influenza infection ) of gut bacterial microbiota composition in both young , middle , and aged mice on both al or cr diet .
interestingly , though cr had a great impact on gut microbiota , it did not seem to affect flu - induced immune responses or flu - induced alterations in the gut microbiota at these early time points .
it is possible that these alterations , such as increased proteobacteria compared to al mice , may have effects at later time points in flu responses and recovery .
more research is necessary to determine if cr modulation of gut microbiota with aging is beneficial to flu immune responses .
cytokine production associated with influenza infection in our study correlates differently with each otus .
although the data we present do not allow causal relations between bacteria and cytokine production to be determined , they do provide hypotheses for virus - bacterial interactions through the immune system .
there is evidence that the genus lactobacillus can improve the immune response to the pr8 strain of influenza ( 94 , 95 ) and respiratory syncytial virus ( 96 ) infection .
here , we find multiple members of the bacteroidetes phyla to be correlated with immune parameters and flu pathogenicity .
thus , while influenza infection promotes proteobacteria overgrowth through ifn - i ( 56 ) , members of the bacteroidetes phyla are also affected and likely in turn affect immune parameters , both positively and negatively .
interestingly , a bacteroidetes dominated microbiome was associated with increased frailty among the elderly ( 61 ) , perhaps suggesting a microbiota link associated with the increased disability observed following influenza infection in the elderly ( 97 ) .
future research should explore manipulation of bacterial species from this phyla to modulate flu immune responses .
thus , we believe this exploratory study can provide some additional guidance to the use of microbiota to facilitate virus - specific immune responses , especially for elderly whose immune responses are known to be deficient .

1. introduction type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) is an autoimmune disease characterized by t cell - mediated destruction of the pancreatic islet beta cells .
multiple genetic loci contribute to t1d susceptibility in humans , with the most responsible locus being the major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) [ 1 ] .
the ability of certain class ii mhc genes to influence disease risk has long been appreciated [ 2 , 3 ] .
multiple studies have also revealed an association with certain class i mhc alleles , including the common hla - a * 02:01 [ 4 - 13 ] .
these findings are not surprising , given that cd4 and cd8 t cell responses to a variety of beta cell antigens , including insulin , are observed in t1d patients [ 14 ] .
after the mhc , the locus that confers the strongest susceptibility to t1d in humans is the variable number of tandem repeats ( vntr ) regulatory region of the insulin gene [ 1 , 15 ] .
vntr alleles with the smallest number of repeats , designated as class i , predispose to t1d [ 16 , 17 ] , while the longer class iii alleles have a dominant protective effect [ 15 , 18 ] .
class iii vntr alleles are associated with thymic insulin rna levels that are increased two - to threefold compared to class i alleles [ 19 ] , leading to the hypothesis that impaired negative selection of insulin - specific t cells in individuals with class i vntr alleles explains their predisposition to t1d [ 19 , 20 ] .
while findings from a single human study are consistent with this idea [ 21 ] , the development of a mouse model for t1d that incorporates the reduced , but not abolished , thymic insulin expression observed in patients would allow for more rigorous future testing of this hypothesis .
the nod mouse is the primary rodent model used for studying t1d [ 22 ] .
unlike humans , mice express two insulin genes , ins1 and ins2 .
while both genes are expressed in beta cells [ 23 ] , ins2 expression predominates in the thymus [ 24 - 27 ] , with little [ 24 ] to no [ 25 - 27 ] detectable thymic ins1 expression .
ins2 - deficient ( ins2ko ) nod mice develop diabetes at an accelerated rate [ 28 - 30 ] , as do hla - a * 02:01 - transgenic ins2ko nod mice [ 28 ] , and both ins2 - deficient strains have increased insulin - specific islet - infiltrating cd8 t cells compared to their wild - type ( wt ) counterparts [ 28 ] .
while these ins2ko mouse strains highlight the importance of thymic insulin expression , they do not accurately represent a human patient , where thymic insulin expression is diminished but still present [ 19 , 20 ] .
here we have developed an hla - a * 02:01 - transgenic nod - based t1d model that is heterozygous ( het ) for the ins2ko allele , resulting in thymic insulin expression that is decreased but not eliminated .
the mice develop accelerated disease compared to ins2wt mice , and this is true regardless of gender .
immune cell populations are not grossly altered , and the mice exhibit typical signs of islet autoimmunity , including cd8 t cell responses to beta cell peptides also targeted in hla - a * 02:01 - positive t1d patients .
this model should find utility as a tool to uncover the mechanisms underlying the association between class i vntr alleles and t1d in humans .
it should also aid in preclinical studies to evaluate insulin - targeted immunotherapies for the disease .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
mice nod.beta 2mko.hhd mice [ 31 ] transgenically express a single - chain chimeric hla - a * 02:01 molecule in which human beta2 - microglobulin ( beta 2m ) is covalently linked to the alpha1 and alpha2 domains of hla - a * 02:01 .
the alpha3 , transmembrane , and cytoplasmic portions of the molecule are derived from h - 2db .
mouse class i mhc molecules are not expressed in these mice due to the murine beta 2m deficiency .
nod.ins2ko mice have been described [ 29 ] .
the two strains were intercrossed to transfer the ins2ko allele to the nod.beta 2mko.hhd strain .
the resulting progeny were bred as appropriate to obtain ins2wt and ins2het nod.beta 2mko.hhd mice for our studies .
female beta 2mko mice breed poorly in our hands and so were rarely used for this purpose .
similarly , nod and nod.ins2ko mice were intercrossed and the resulting progeny bred as appropriate to obtain ins2wt and ins2het nod mice .
the hhd transgene and the wt and ko beta 2m and ins2 alleles were identified by pcr using the following primer pairs : hhd , 5 ' - cttcatcgcagtgggctac - 3 ' and 5 ' - cggtgagtctgtgagtggg - 3 ' ; beta 2mwt , 5 ' - gaaacccctcaaattcaagtatactca - 3 ' and 5 ' - gacggtcttgggctcggccatact - 3 ' ; beta 2mko , 5 ' - gaaacccctcaaattcaagtatactca - 3 ' and 5 ' - tcgaattcgccaatgacaagacgct - 3 ' ; ins2wt , 5 ' - ggcagagaggaggtgctttg - 3 ' and 5 ' - agaaaaccaccagggtagttagc - 3 ' ; ins2ko , 5 ' - ggcagagaggaggtgctttg - 3 ' and 5 ' - attgaccgtaatgggatagg - 3 ' .
all animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of albert einstein college of medicine .
2.2 .
measurement of thymic ins2 rna female ins2wt and ins2het nod.beta2mko.hhd mice ( four each ) were sacrificed and thymus was harvested .
total thymic rna was isolated using the rneasy midi kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca ) and treated with dnase i ( qiagen ) to eliminate dna contamination .
1.5 - 2.3 mug of rna was reverse - transcribed to cdna using random hexadeoxynucleotides and oligo dt primers ( invitrogen ) .
equal amounts of cdna were mixed with sybr green pcr master mix ( qiagen ) and each ins2 primer ( 5 ' - cttcttctacacacccatgtcc - 3 ' and 5 ' - tctacaatgccacgcttctg - 3 ') or primers for the u6 normalization control ( 5 ' - ctcgcttcggcagcacatatacta - 3 ' and 5 ' - acgaatttgcgtgtcatccttgcg - 3 ') and brought to a final volume of 25 mul .
real - time quantitative rt - pcr was performed in triplicate using an iq5 optical system ( bio - rad , hercules , ca ) .
amplification was carried out as follows : a single denaturing step at 95degreesc for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95degreesc for 15 sec , 59degreesc for 30 sec , and 72degreesc for 30 sec , followed by a final extension step of 72degreesc for 3 min .
results were analyzed using the relative expression software tool ( rest ) [ 32 , 33 ] .
2.3 .
type 1 diabetes assessment glucosuria was monitored weekly using diastix reagent strips ( bayer , elkhart , in ) .
mice were considered diabetic after two consecutive positive tests , and the date of the first positive test was recorded as the time of onset of disease .
2.4 .
flow cytometry splenocytes from nod.beta 2mko.hhd and nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice were analyzed by flow cytometry .
cells were stained with anti - b220 , anti - cd11c , anti - cd4 , and anti - cd8 ( all from bd biosciences , san jose , ca ) .
in some samples , cells were stained with anti - cd25 ( bd biosciences ) , fixed and permeabilized with fixation / permeabilization buffer ( ebioscience , san diego , ca ) , and stained with anti - foxp3 ( ebioscience ) .
2.5 .
pancreas histology to assess insulitis in female nod.beta 2mko.hhd and nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice at 4 and 8 weeks of age , pancreata were fixed in bouin 's solution , embedded in paraffin , and sectioned at nonoverlapping levels .
sections were stained with aldehyde fuchsine to readily visualize granulated beta cells and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin for detection of leukocytes .
islets were scored as previously described [ 34 ] : 0 , no insulitis ; 1 , local insulitis without infiltration of islet itself ; 2 , less than 25 % infiltration ; 3 , 25 - 75 % infiltration ; or 4 , greater than 75 % infiltration .
an insulitis index was calculated by adding the scores of all islets and dividing by four times the number of islets scored .
a minimum of 20 islets per mouse were evaluated .
diabetic mice were assigned an insulitis index of 1 .
2.6 .
islet isolation and culture of islet - infiltrating t cells islets were isolated from female nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice at 8 weeks of age by collagenase p perfusion of the common bile duct as previously described [ 35 ] .
islets were handpicked using a micromanipulator and a dissecting microscope and up to 50 islets were transferred per well to 24 - well plates in 500 mul r - 10 medium ( rpmi 1640 ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) containing 10 % fbs , 1 mm sodium pyruvate , 28 mum beta - mercaptoethanol , 1x nonessential amino acids ( invitrogen )) with 50 u / ml recombinant human il - 2 ( peprotech , rocky hill , nj ) .
cells were cultured for 7 days at 37degreesc in 5 % co2 , at which point the majority of the cells are expected to be cd8 t cells [ 35 ] .
2.7 .
ifn - gamma elispot assay human hla - a * 02:01 - positive t2 cells [ 36 ] , deficient for the transporter associated with antigen processing , were cultured at 26degreesc overnight prior to use .
elispot plates ( millipore maha s4510 , billerica , ma ) were coated with anti - mouse ifngamma antibody ( bd biosciences ) and blocked with 1 % bovine serum albumin ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo ) .
t2 cells were plated at 2 x 104 cells / well and pulsed with 10 mum of the indicated peptides for 1 hour at 26degreesc .
cultured islet - infiltrating t cells from nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice were added at 2 x 104 cells / well in 50 mul r - 10 .
cells were incubated for 40 hours at 37degreesc .
wells were then washed with 0.05 % tween 20 / pbs and biotinylated anti - mouse ifngamma detection antibody ( bd biosciences ) was added for 2 hours at 37degreesc .
after washing , streptavidin - alkaline phosphatase ( zymed laboratories , carlsbad , ca ) was added and incubated for 1 hour at 37degreesc .
wells were washed and spots were developed using 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl - phosphate / nitro - blue tetrazolium substrate ( sigma - aldrich ) .
spots were counted using an automated elispot reader system ( autoimmun diagnostika , strassberg , germany ) .
responses are reported as a stimulation index , which is defined as spot number in response to the test peptide divided by spot number in response to an irrelevant hiv - derived hla - a * 02:01 - binding peptide ( slyntvatl ) [ 37 ] .
the cutoff for positivity is a stimulation index greater than 2 and a test peptide spot number greater than 5 per 1 x 105 t cells [ 38 ] .
3. results 3.1 .
accelerated diabetes development in nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice a previous study had demonstrated that ins2het mice of mixed , but primarily c57bl / 6 , background experience a reduction in thymic insulin expression of approximately 40 % [ 24 ] .
to develop a mouse model of t1d having reduced thymic insulin quantity , and also expressing the human class i mhc molecule hla - a * 02:01 , we generated nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice .
using quantitative rt - pcr , we similarly found a reduction in thymic insulin expression of 35 % in female ins2het compared to ins2wt mice ( n = 4 mice of each genotype ) .
diabetes development in nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het and nod.beta 2mko.hhd mice of both genders was then compared .
both female ( figure 1 ( a )) and male nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice ( figure 1 ( b )) demonstrated accelerated diabetes development compared to their ins2wt counterparts .
female nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice developed diabetes as early as 9 weeks of age and all were diabetic by 27 weeks ( figure 1 ( a )) .
the first onset of diabetes in ins2wt female mice was at 11 weeks , and only 47 % developed diabetes by 30 weeks .
as also seen in standard nod males [ 39 , 40 ] , diabetes development was slowed and overall incidence was reduced in nod.beta 2mko.hhd males ( figure 1 ( b )) compared to females .
however , ins2het males exhibited an earlier onset of disease compared to ins2wt males ( 10 weeks versus 17 weeks ) , and a larger percentage ( 56 % versus 24 %) had developed diabetes by 30 weeks of age ( figure 1 ( b )) .
thus , both genders of nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice faithfully model the circumstance in humans where reduced thymic insulin expression is predisposing to t1d [ 16 , 17 ] .
note that this is not what we observed in the case of nod.ins2het mice , where both female ( figure 2 ( a )) and male ins2het mice ( figure 2 ( b )) exhibit a diabetes profile that is statistically indistinguishable from that of nod mice .
3.2 .
immune cell populations are not grossly altered in nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice to verify that the accelerated diabetes development observed in nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice could not be attributed to a gross alteration in immune cell populations , we examined the splenocyte composition of 8 - week - old female nondiabetic nod.beta 2mko.hhd and nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice ( figure 3 ( a )) .
it was previously shown that nod.beta 2mko.hhd mice have a reduced cd8 t cell population and elevated b and cd4 t cells compared to standard nod mice [ 31 ] .
this was also true for nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice , and no differences were observed in any of the cell types analyzed as a percentage of total cells .
to investigate whether a reduction in regulatory t cells ( treg ) might contribute to disease pathogenesis in the ins2het mice , nod.beta 2mko.hhd and nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het splenocytes were monitored for expression of the characteristic treg cell phenotype , cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + .
no difference was observed in treg cells as a percentage of cd4 t cells ( figure 3 ( b )) .
these results indicate that the accelerated diabetes development seen in nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice is the result of neither an altered immune cell composition nor reduced treg cells , at least at the level investigated here , that is , without regard to antigenic specificity .
3.3 .
nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice exhibit typical signs of islet autoimmunity in mixed background mice carrying zero , one , or two copies of the ins2 gene , pancreatic insulin content is indistinguishable [ 24 ] .
furthermore , ins2ko mice perform identically to their ins2wt counterparts in intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests [ 41 ] .
thus , we hypothesized that the diabetes observed in nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice was of an autoimmune nature , as is the case for the nod.beta 2mko.hhd parent strain [ 31 ] , and not a deficiency in pancreatic insulin production due to the presence of only one functional copy of the ins2 gene .
to verify this , histological sections of pancreata from female mice at 4 and 8 weeks of age were examined .
all mice studied exhibited some degree of insulitis , which progressed significantly with age ( figure 3 ( c )) , and islets showing a wide range of immune cell infiltration and beta cell destruction were observed ( figure 3 ( c )) .
we previously identified several hla - a * 02:01 - restricted beta cell epitopes , derived from the autoantigens insulin and islet - specific glucose - 6 - phosphatase catalytic subunit - related protein ( igrp ) that are recognized by islet - infiltrating t cells from nod.beta 2mko.hhd mice [ 31 , 42 ] .
to further confirm the autoimmune nature of the diabetes observed in nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice , islets from 8 - week - old females were cultured for 7 days and t cell reactivity to the previously identified beta cell epitopes was monitored by ifngamma elispot .
all mice harbored autoreactive t cells specific for at least two epitopes ( figure 3 ( d )) , further confirming the autoimmune nature of their disease .
a subset of these epitopes ( ins b5 - 14 , igrp 228 - 236 , and igrp 265 - 273 ) have previously been shown to be recognized by cd8 t cells in hla - a * 02:01 - positive t1d patients [ 43 - 46 ] , supporting the clinical relevance of the model .
4. discussion insulin is an important autoantigen recognized by t cells in both human t1d and the nod mouse model of the disease [ 47 ] .
reduced thymic insulin expression is associated with susceptibility to t1d in patients [ 16 , 17 , 19 , 20 ] , suggesting that impaired negative selection of t cells specific for insulin is responsible for this predisposition .
here we have developed and characterized nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice as a model of t1d that incorporates reduced thymic insulin .
we find that , as in patients , disease is accelerated ( figure 1 ) , and we suggest these mice as a new diabetes model that can be used to better understand this phenomenon .
the nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice present advantages over other disease models that have been described for this purpose .
for example , thymic insulin expression is abolished in nod.ins2ko and nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2ko mice , and both exhibit accelerated t1d [ 28 - 30 ] and increased insulin - specific islet - infiltrating cd8 t cells [ 28 ] when compared to their ins2wt counterparts .
while these findings suggest the importance of thymic insulin expression , ins2ko models do not accurately represent patients , where thymic insulin expression is reduced , but not eliminated [ 19 , 20 ] .
as for nod.ins2het mice , in our hands neither females nor males show accelerated disease ( figure 2 ) .
two earlier studies of nod.ins2het mice also showed no effect on disease in males [ 29 , 30 ] , and only one of the two showed acceleration in females [ 29 ] .
in contrast , both male and female nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice show enhanced disease ( figure 1 ) .
indeed , the female and male incidence curves are nearly overlapping until 15 weeks of age ( cf. figures 1 ( a ) and 1 ( b )) .
thus , future mechanistic studies could realistically be performed using both genders .
these studies should include the quantification of insulin - specific effector t cells and treg and analysis of their phenotype and function .
the recently described ability to isolate insulin - specific cd4 t cells from nod mouse strains using enrichment with peptide / mhc tetramer reagents will facilitate this work [ 48 ] .
in nod mice , establishment of immunological tolerance to insulin can lead to prevention of t1d [ 49 - 51 ] and remission of established disease [ 52 ] .
because of these findings , there is great interest in immunological interventions for human t1d that seek to manipulate the t cell response to insulin [ 53 ] .
the nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mouse strain should be considered as an additional preclinical model to be used to evaluate such therapies , as it incorporates aspects of the human disease that are not represented in standard nod mice , including reduced thymic insulin expression .
in humans , vntr alleles associated with diminished thymic insulin have been shown to alter the frequency and avidity of insulin - specific t cells [ 21 ] , both of which could reasonably influence the outcome of therapies designed to manipulate the immune response to insulin .
given that human insulin - specific cd8 t cells have been shown to have cytotoxic activity against islets [ 54 ] , an additional advantage of the nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mouse model is the expression of the t1d - predisposing human class i mhc allele hla - a * 02:01 [ 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 ] , which we have shown as supporting the development of t cells specific for hla - a * 02:01 - restricted insulin epitopes in these mice ( figure 3 ( d )) .
in terms of insulin - specific cd4 t cells , the class ii mhc allele expressed in the nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice is i - ag7 , which is structurally similar to the human t1d - predisposing hla - dq8 [ 55 , 56 ] .
indeed , i - ag7 and hla - dq8 are capable of presenting similar peptides [ 57 - 59 ] .
the nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mouse therefore has a variety of potential uses as a humanized model of t1d , including cd8 and cd4 t cell epitope identification , analysis of the relationship between thymic insulin expression and tolerance , and the evaluation of antigen - specific immunotherapies , particularly those targeting the immune response to insulin .
5. conclusions nod.beta 2mko.hhd.ins2het mice represent a model for t1d that incorporates the reduced , but not abolished , thymic insulin expression observed in patients .
this model should find utility in investigations to probe the mechanisms underlying the association between reduced thymic insulin expression and t1d in humans .
it will also be an important tool for t cell epitope discovery and for the preclinical evaluation of insulin - targeted immunotherapies for the disease .

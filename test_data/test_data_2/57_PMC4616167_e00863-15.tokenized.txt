paenibacillus sp. strain fjat - 28004 is a spore forming and strictly aerobic bacterium .
here , we report the draft 7,479,858 - bp genome sequence of paenibacillus sp. fjat - 28004 , which will provide useful information for genomic taxonomy and phylogenomics of the genus paenibacillus , as well as for the functional gene mining and application of paenibacillus sp. fjat - 28004 .
cover - dateseptember / october 2015 genome announcement the genus paenibacillus was created from the group 3 bacilli on the basis of a 16s rrna gene sequence analysis conducted by ash et al .
( 1 ) .
since the description of the genus , species belonging to the genus paenibacillus have been isolated from various ecological habitats , including warm springs ( 2 ) , rice fields ( 3 ) , alkaline soils ( 4 ) , and the phyllospheres and rhizospheres of trees ( 5 ) .
during the survey of the diversity of bacteria in xizang , paenibacillus sp. strain fjat - 28004 was isolated from the dry deadwood sample collected from nyingchi prefecture in xizang , china. from the 16s rrna phylogenetic analysis , it was observed that strain fjat - 28004 was clearly distinguishable from other paenibacillus species and should be a new species of the genus paenibacillus .
in order to confirm this , fjat - 28004 was selected as one of the research objects in our " genome sequencing project for genomic taxonomy and phylogenomics of bacillus - like bacteria. " the genome sequencing of fjat - 28004 was performed via the illumina hiseq2500 system .
three different dna libraries with insert sizes of 180 , 500 , and 3k bp were constructed and sequenced using the 2 - x 125 - bp paired - end sequencing strategy .
a total of 4,417,476,776 bp of clean sequence data were obtained , consisting of 17,669,907 reads , providing approximately 735 - fold coverage .
the reads were assembled via the soapdenovo software version 1.05 ( 6 ) , using the key parameter k setting at 17. through the data assembly , 21 scaffolds were obtained , and the scaffold n50 was 5,163,634 bp. the average length of the scaffolds was 356,183 bp , and the longest and shortest scaffolds were 5,163,634 bp and 1,086 bp , respectively .
the annotation of the genome was performed using the ncbi prokaryotic genomes automatic annotation pipeline ( pgaap ) utilizing genemark , glimmer , and trnascan - se tools ( 7 ) .
a total of 7,033 genes were predicted , including 6,322 functional genes , 119 pseudo genes , 5 mirnas , 72 trnas , and 6 rrna genes .
also , 1 clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat ( crispr ) array was found in the draft genome .
the average dna g + c content was 44.3 %. from the genome sequence analysis , fjat - 28004 was predicted to possess complete carbon metabolic pathways , including those for glycolysis , the citrate cycle ( tricarboxylic acid [ tca ] cycle ) , and the pentose phosphate pathway .
in particular , paenibacillus sp. fjat - 28004 was predicted to be equipped with a wide variety of genes for amino acid and organic acid metabolism , agreeing with the physiological properties of fjat - 28004 .

this whole - genome shotgun project has been deposited at ddbj / embl / genbank under the accession no. lghp00000000 .
the version described in this paper is version lghp00000000.1 .

i read with interest " intrapartum intrauterine fetal demise with normal umbilical cord blood gas values at birth ," by michael d. benson [ 1 ] .
i am most pleased that dr. benson was willing to share the fetal monitor strips which show the following highlights : initial baseline fetal heart rate of 140 beats per minute ( bpm ) with normal variability and accelerations .
intermittent variable and prolonged decelerations .
beginning three hours prior to delivery , increasing frequency and severity of variable decelerations associated with every instance of maternal pushing .
fifty minutes prior to delivery , a prolonged deceleration of eight minutes followed by a fetal heart rate of 160 - 190 bpm .
fetal heart rate tracing ends 27 minutes prior to delivery at 190 bpm .
apgar scores were 01 / 05 / 010 / 020 .
cord gases were reported as ( base excesses transposed in table 1 , correctly identified in text ) vein : 7.27 / 48 /< 25 / - 10 ( ph / pco2 / po2 / be ) ; artery : 7.13 / 64 /< 25 / - 5 .
although the title of this report calls the cord gas results " normal ," they are not .
the arterial umbilical cord gas base excess of minus 10 is mildly abnormal [ 2 , 3 ] .
further , the venoarterial ph difference of 0.14 is widened [ 4 ] .
terminal fetal bradycardia with widened ph differences is associated with both cord compression ( common ) [ 5 , 6 ] and chronic fetal heart failure ( rare ) [ 7 ] .
typically , in chronic fetal heart failure , fetal heart rate variability is decreased throughout the fetal heart rate tracing and variable decelerations are not associated with the tracing .
therefore , this second option seems highly unlikely .
the first option , cord compression with terminal fetal bradycardia , seems quite likely as there was evidence of cord compression ( increasing frequency and severity of variable decelerations ) and the presence of a widened ph difference in the cord gases .
in cord occlusion , a widened ph difference is due to temporary restoration of umbilical cord arterial blood flow secondary to fetal hypertension .
although no evidence of cord compression was found at the time of cesarean delivery , occult cord compression is only identified if the cord happens to be directly below the uterine incision , as it is in only the minority of occurrences .
the severe variable decelerations attest to the presence of impingement on the cord .
a report [ 8 ] of cord blood gases associated with cord prolapse in a stillborn baby found values extremely similar ( vein : 7.24 / 55 / 20 / - 5 ; artery : 7.10 / 71 / 8 / - 10 ) to those reported by benson .
cord occlusion with terminal fetal bradycardia and near - normal cord gases may occur in the absence of a widened venoarterial ph difference , although this finding is quite rare [ 9 ] .
in order to establish cord compression with terminal fetal bradycardia as the likely etiology of neonatal depression in the absence of a widened venoarterial ph difference , one must demonstrate preceding evidence of a vulnerable cord , the presence of normal or near - normal venous and arterial cord gases , and a postresuscitation blood gas that has a much worse base deficit .
cord gases only reflect uteroplacental status ( vein ) and uteroplacental - fetal status ( arteries ) while blood flow continues .
conflict of interests the author declares that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper .

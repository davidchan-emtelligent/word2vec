background human disease genes can be distinguished from essential ( embryonically lethal ) and non - disease genes using gene attributes .
such attributes include gene age , tissue specificity of expression , regulatory capacity , sequence length , rate of sequence variation and capacity for interaction .
the resulting information has been used to inform data mining approaches seeking to identify novel disease genes .
given the dynamic nature of this field and the rapid rise in relevant information , we have chosen to perform a single integrated mining approach to explore relationships among gene attributes and thereby characterise evolutionary trends associated with disease genes .
results all against all cross comparison of 2,522 disease gene attributes revealed significant relationships existed between the age , disease - association and expression pattern of genes and the tissues within which they are expressed .
we found that the over - representation of disease genes among old genes holds for tissue - specific genes , but the correlation between age and disease association vanished when conditioning on tissue - specificity. of the 32 tissues studied , the genes expressed in pancreas are on average older than the genes expressed in any other tissue , while the testis expressed the lowest proportion of old genes .
following a focussed analysis on the impact of regulatory apparatus on evolution of disease genes , we show that regulators , comprising transcription factors and post - translation modified proteins , are over - represented among ancient disease genes .
in addition , we show that the proportion of regulator genes is affected by gene age among disease genes and by tissue - specificity among non - disease genes .
finally , using 55,606 true positive gene interaction data , we find that old disease genes interacts with other old disease genes and interacting new genes interacts with genes originating from higher phylostrata .
conclusion this study supports the non - random nature of the human diseasome .
we have identified a variety of distinct features and correlations to other molecular attributes that can be used to distinguish the set of disease causing genes .
this was achieved by harnessing the power of mining large scale datasets from omim and other databases .
ultimately such knowledge may contribute to the identification of novel human disease genes and an enhanced understanding of human biology .
26 - 28 september 2010asia pacific bioinformatics network ( apbionet ) ninth international conference on bioinformatics ( incob2010 ) tokyo , japan background human diseases associated genes , collectively termed as the diseasome , are the focus of extensive studies .
the consistent association of individual gene variants with disease has facilitated the decoding of the molecular basis of heritable diseases .
on a larger scale , the diseasome itself has been scrutinized for characteristics that distinguish it from the remainder of the genome .
such studies on the diseasome have focussed on identifying causal mutations , mode of inheritance , their expression across a wide spectrum of tissues and to identify whether they are essential or non - essential genes ( i.e. to test their embryonic lethality ) [ 1 ] .
for instance , it is well established that non - synonymous dna mutations causing disease are atypical both in their rate and pattern of evolution [ 2 ] , enriched at highly conserved amino acid positions [ 2 ] resulting in large changes in physicochemical properties of amino acids and seem likely to have severe effects on protein stability .
following the availability of the human genome and an atlas of disease associated genes deposited in omim ( online mendelian inheritance in man ) [ 3 ] and other databases [ 4 ] , researchers focussed on combining these datasets to gain insights into the evolution of the human diseasome .
for instance , lopez - bigas and co - workers [ 5,6 ] classified over 1,600 human disease genes from various databases and studied their properties using gene ontology ( go ) terms and expression across different tissues .
they observed that the functional pattern of genes causing dominant and recessive diseases is markedly different and report extensive correlations between disease gene attributes .
based on these findings , they proposed that the division of human diseasome by mode of inheritance ( dominant or recessive ) could enhance both understanding of the disease process and prediction of candidate disease genes .
furthermore , a number of groups applied comparative genomic approaches to study evolution of disease genes .
for instance , huang et al [ 7 ] investigated whether human disease genes differ significantly from their rodent orthologs with respect to their overall levels of conservation and their rates of evolutionary change .
following comparison of human genome with mouse and rat genome sequences for disease genes , they report that most ( 99.5 %) human disease genes have been retained in rodent genomes .
using a large set of disease and non - disease genes , smith et al [ 2 ] compared human with rodents to infer evolutionary patterns .
they measured ka , ks and ka / ks between disease and non - disease genes in human and found significant difference in ka / ks ratios .
they also describe the evolution of disease and non - disease genes based on protein structure , gene length and tissue specificity .
applying various in silico approaches , kondrashov et al [ 8 ] compared 18 crucial parameters among 1,273 human disease genes and reported that disease genes evolve more slowly , have wider phylogenetic distributions , code for longer proteins containing more alanine and glycine and less histidine , lysine and methionine , possess larger numbers of longer introns with more accurate splicing signals and have higher and broader expressions .
phylostratigraphic ( ps ) approach is a method to quantify and statistically analyze gene emergence at different levels of the taxonomic hierarchy .
the approach is based on the assumption that at least a significant fraction of genes has retained their function after origination [ 9 ] .
this approach was developed by domazet - loso et al [ 9 ] to uncover the genomic history of major adaptations in metazoans .
later , the authors used this ps approach [ 10 ] to study the evolution of human genes and reported that disease genes tend to be ' old ' rather than ' young ' .
in this study , authors also suggested that genetic disease is an inescapable component of evolution .
this is somewhat counterintuitive because disease - associated genes would be expected to be selected against by natural evolution and rapidly eliminated from the population and not maintained over extended periods of time .
alternatively , disease - associated genes may have previously evolved to participate in highly - regulated processes that resulted in optimal conditions for a given environment , but currently these functions are no longer seen as optimal anymore but detrimental .
independently , we have investigated the impact of tissue specificity and differential gene network connectivity on disease associations of human genes [ 11 ] .
we found that disease associated genes are more likely to show tissue specific expression and most frequently interact with other disease genes .
based on these biological properties , we developed a guilt - by - association algorithm that lead to the discovery of a group of 112 non - disease annotated genes that predominantly interact with disease - associated genes , impacting on disease outcomes [ 11 ] .
in the present study , and in order to further characterise evolutionary trends associated with disease genes , we have integrated data generated in previous studies enabling us to compare a greater number of attributes , generated using current technologies ( massively parallel signature sequencing ( mpss ) data generated from 32 tissues ) combined with the latest version of omim .
specific attributes tested for relationships include gene age , disease , tissue specificity , known interactions , sequence length , chromosome location and whether or not a gene product acts as a regulator by either being a transcription factor ( tf ) and / or harbouring post - translational modification ( ptm ) sites .
results and discussion in order to identify novel , and biologically meaningful , interconnections among disease genes , we carried out all against all cross comparison of 2,522 disease genes with a number of relevant molecular attributes ( see methods ) and raised several queries within the framework of evolution of disease genes .
table 1 shows the breakdown of 12,753 genes within each category with respect to age of the genes , tissue specificity , gene - gene interactions , gene regulation , and association with disease .
significant findings from each of these comparisons are summarised in table 2 ( and additional file 1 ) and discussed in the following sections .
as this study aims at all against all relationships , the individual gene attributes and its relationship with other attributes are described simultaneously .
for instance , while discussing the impact of tissue specificity on disease genes , we also describe the impact of regulators and / or gene length that affect tissue specificity .

the interplay between evolution , disease genes and tissue specificity in a bid to elucidate the complex association among disease and non - disease genes , old and new genes and housekeeping and tissue - specific genes , we integrated functional gene attribute information spanning 12,753 genes .
old and new genes represented 66 and 34 % of all genes , respectively .
dis and ndis genes represented 24 % and 76 % , respectively .
we observed that house - keeping genes are over - represented among old genes ; that tissue specific genes are over - represented among disease genes ; and that while disease genes are over - represented among old genes , this over - representation is more apparent among tissue specific genes .
overall , we find that the age attribute has a strong correlation with all the other gene attributes used in this study such as tissue - specificity , gene - gene interactions , gene length and regulatory nature of genes. a. the impact of old genes and new genes over tissue - specificity old genes are ubiquitously expressed across tissues , more associated with diseases and are more likely to be regulators ( additional file 2 : table s2 ) .
there is in fact a 1.32 - fold higher occurrence of a regulatory function among old genes ( p < 0.0001 ) .
this decrease in regulatory function in new genes is counterintuitive as it occurs when there is a significant increase in complexity of organisms .
this result is however consistent with the idea that there is an upper limit to tf - based regulation and warrants the emergence of novel regulatory mechanisms .
it is now clear that in higher eukaryotes non - coding rnas function as this alternative mechanism [ 12 ] .
however , tissue - specificity , as measured by the proportion of tissues in which a gene is expressed out of a total of 32 tissues represented , drives many of the above - mentioned relationships .
in essence , conditioning on tissue - specificity nullifies the correlations between gene age and the other variables , except for the correlation between age and sequence length , meaning older genes are still longer ( additional file 2 : table s3 ). b. disease genes and tissue - specificity disease genes are over - represented among old , interacting and genes involved in regulation and this over - representation is more pronounced among tissue - specific genes .
for instance , 31.2 % disease genes are involved in regulation compared to only 16.9 % disease genes among the non - regulatory genes .
in addition , the strong correlation between disease genes and regulatory genes is intact even when conditioning on tissue - specificity .
the correlation between tissue specificity and disease - association has also been reported by other groups [ 13,14 ] .
specifically , using a 2,400 human - rodent orthologs and 834 rat - mouse orthologs and est information , duret and mouchiroud [ 15 ] observed that tissue - specific genes exhibited higher ka / ks ratios than housekeeping genes .
confirming this finding , huang et al [ 7 ] demonstrated that much of this effect is explicable in terms of a correlation between a gene 's tissue - specificity and the cellular localization of its encoded protein .
in this study , we found a 1.54 over - representation of disease genes among tissue specific old genes compared to new genes .
this relationship was not impacted by tissue - specificity in new genes .
2. the evolution of the regulatory diseasome post - transcriptional regulation by transcription factors ( tf ) at the gene level [ 16 ] and post - translational modifications ( ptm ) [ 17 ] at the protein level are two principal regulatory mechanisms in eukaryotes .
one of the key components of this study was the consideration of regulatory function in the context of disease and evolution .
specifically , we evaluated the role of regulators during the course of evolution of disease genes by utilizing tf and ptm data .
firstly , we analysed regulators by combining tf and ptm to explore disease genes from a regulatory viewpoint .
next , we separated the tf and ptm data to assess their independent effect during the course of evolution represented by respective phylostrata .
we found that genes encoding proteins with ptms are over - represented among old genes , housekeeping genes , and interacting genes and in tf themselves .
in addition , of the 228 genes that have both ptms and are tf , 72 are disease genes ( 32 % against 20 % in all genes ) .
out of these 228 ptms and tfs , 30 ( 13 %) originated in ps5 ( metazoa ) compared to only 2 % of total genes formed in ps3 demonstrating significant inclusion of regulatory modules to metazoans .
this result is not surprising as metazoans by definition are multicellular organisms and would undoubtedly require additional levels of regulation to ensure accurate morphological development .
finally , the proportion of regulators is affected by age among disease genes ( with ~ 1 / 3 more regulator genes among old genes compared to new genes ) , while it is affected by tissue - specificity among non - disease genes ( also with ~ 1 / 3 more regulators among housekeeping genes compared to tissue - specific genes ) ( additional file 2 : table s4 ) .
when regulatory apparatus was studied separately for tf and ptm ( see figure 1 ) , we found an over - representation of tf originating in ps3 ( fungi ) at 28.6 % compared to only 7.8 % of all genes being tf. we did not observe an over - representation of ptm originating at ps3 .
this suggests that the evolution from eukaryotes to fungi requires a substantial increase in transcriptional regulation , while post - translational modification mechanisms are less relevant .
in contrast , at ps5 ( metazoa ) , a significant over - representation of both tf and ptm was clearly apparent .
ptms experienced another surge at ps11 ( vertebrata ) that was not coupled with a surge in tf , indicating significant increase in protein level regulation post vertebrates during the course of evolution .

horizontal red and black lines correspond to the bounds of the 95 % confidence interval for tf and ptm , respectively , and based on the entire set of 12,753 genes .
other less understood eukaryotic regulatory mechanisms such as cpg island methylation was not included in the analysis .
although cpg island methylation plays an important role in epigenetic gene control in general via hyper and hypo methylation of regulatory regions ( promoters ) their precise role across the ' diseasome ' is not well established .
for instance , there are independent studies focussed on cancer [ 18 ] or methylation patterns within the major histo - compatibility complex ( mhc ) as a part of human epigenome project ( http :// www.epigenome.org /) .
3. the pattern of gene - gene interactions among gene attributes we looked at the combined effect of age ( old vs. new ) , disease - association ( yes vs. no ) tissue - specificity and regulatory condition ( yes vs. no ) on the number of interactions. by and large , age had the highest effect with old genes having ~ 50 % more connections than new genes ( 9.227 vs. 6.1245 ; p < 0.0001 ) .
regulatory role had the second highest effect , with regulators having ~ 40 % more connections than non - regulators ( 8.980 vs. 6.371 ; p < 0.0001 ) .
importantly , after adjusting for these two variables ( age and regulatory conditions ) , neither tissue - specificity nor disease - association were found to be significant ( p > 0.05 ) sources of variation in the number of connections observed for a given gene .
however , there was a tendency for dis genes to have more connections than ndis genes ( 8.145 vs. 7.206 ; p = 0.0675 ) , and for hk genes to have more connections than ts genes ( 8.109 vs. 7.242 ; p = 0.0855 ) .
while the original study of domazet - loso and tautz [ 10 ] failed to find a significant re - ranking of gene functional ontologies when comparing disease and non - disease genes in each of the phylostrata , the incorporation of 55,606 true positive interactions among 7,197 genes [ 19 ] allowed us to further explore these relationships .
three major findings were of particular relevance : firstly , there was a bias in the way genes interact , with interacting old genes more likely to interact with other old genes ; secondly , interacting new genes are more likely to interact with other new genes ; finally , we observed that new genes interact more cohesively than old genes .
4. the non - random distribution of genes along the genome genes are non - uniformly distributed in the human genome and we asked whether this heterogeneity may further our understanding of evolutionary trends among disease genes .
consequently , we produced a chromosomal distribution of genes according to their evolutionary age and disease status ( figure 2 ) .
the chromosomal locations of all the genes were mapped to the genome according to their evolutionary age and disease status and classified into four categories : old - non - disease , old - disease , new - non - disease and new - disease .
we noted that the sex chromosomes have a higher proportion of disease genes ; 28.7 +/ - 1.9 % of genes in x and 38.3 +/ - 8.4 % of genes in y , compared to only 13.7 +/ - 1.1 % of genes in chromosome 19 .
this disproportionately high number of hereditary diseases for the x chromosome was well documented during analysis of its genome sequence [ 20 ] .
in contrast , chromosome 19 has the lowest proportion of disease genes , the shortest genes ( average length 24.1 +/ - 1.3 kb ) and tissue - specificity comparable to the x and y sex chromosomes .
this was attributed to chromosome 19 having the highest gene density of all chromosomes , more than double the genome - wide average [ 21 ] .
expanding this analysis , we tested whether there was a chromosome whose genes have a higher than average specificity for a given tissue ( see figure 3 ) .
this analysis revealed that all chromosomes seem to have a large proportion of genes expressed in testis and a low proportion of genes expressed in pancreas .
additionally , for some tissues there was a disproportionate representation of genes from a single chromosome .
as an example , we found an over - representation of genes expressed in cerebellum located on chromosome 13. from this we predict that chromosome 13 may be a potential target to study central nervous system ( cns ) diseases .
a search of the literature confirms that deletions in chromosome 13 impacting cerebellum development have been identified ( see mccormack et al .
[ 22 ] and references therein ) and as such further justifies fine mapping approaches in the search for qtl .

the picture shows the hierarchical clustering of chromosomes ( rows ) and tissues ( columns ) based on the number of genes located in each chromosome and expressed in each tissue .

the figure reveals an anatomically sensible cluster of tissues .
5. expression patterns and gene attribute distribution across tissues by associating gene expression patterns across 32 tissues to molecular attributes used in this study ( old , new , disease , non - disease , etc. ) we were able to provide novel insights into possible trends in evolution of various tissues from a diseasome viewpoint .
in other words , any non - uniform proportions of disease and non - disease genes may unravel the complexity of evolution of tissues and their association with diseases ( pancreatic cancer , alzheimer 's , etc ) .
therefore , for each of the 32 tissues , we explored the proportion of ( 1 ) old genes ( ie. those that evolved in ps1 or ps2 ) ; ( 2 ) disease genes ; ( 3 ) number of tissues where the genes are expressed ; and ( 4 ) regulators in each tissue ( figure 4 ) .
we found that the genes expressed in pancreas are on average older than the genes expressed in any other tissue , have a higher association with disease and are expressed in more tissues , suggesting that the pancreas could be one of the first discrete tissues to evolve .
this finding is in agreement with a phylogeny and ontogeny based study of the pancreas wherein authors propose that the pancreas is indeed one of the first tissues to evolve [ 23 ] .
conversely , genes expressed in the lungs are on average the newest , but this is not the tissue with the lowest proportion of disease genes .
instead , the lowest proportion of disease genes was found in the testis followed by the trachea and bone marrow .
this finding is supported by another study reporting the majority of retrogenes ( new genes formed through gene duplication ) are specifically expressed in testis , whereas their parental genes show broad expression patterns [ 24 ] .
it should be noted with caution that expression of disease genes cannot be used as a parameter to asses whether these tissues are prone for diseases .
in other words , this data is insufficient to conclude that the pancreas is more prone to disease than the testis .
further , the testis was also found to have the highest proportion of tissue - specific genes .
finally , the retina showed a high proportion of disease genes ( second only to pancreas ) even though it ranks among the newest tissues .

conclusion we have used a systems biology approach to integrate large relevant datasets to yield novel , meaningful biological insights into the evolution and tissue - specificity of disease genes. through the incorporation of tissue - specificity attribute , we found that the recently documented over - representation of disease genes among old genes is certainly true for tissue - specific genes , while among housekeeping genes this relationship vanishes .
nevertheless , we acknowledge the challenge of establishing error - free relationships due to the myriad of possible interactions that could exist among large numbers of heterogeneous variables .
researchers have intuitively focused on aberrations in regulatory genes as a likely basis for the disease development .
our findings support this approach because disease genes were found to be over - represented in both the ptm and tf regulatory categories .
finally , this study represents a conceptual scaffold for dissecting human diseasome and reveals novel correlations among molecular attributes , some known , but many unexpected , that might be helpful in the identification of novel genes disrupted in diseases .
methods when discussing gene attributes , a notation consistent with domazet - loso and tautz [ 10 ] is used where old refers to old genes , originating in ps1 or ps2 ( i.e. , up to eukaryotes and before fungi ) ; new genes ( ps3 to ps19 ) ; tissue - specific genes ( expressed in < 14 tissues ) ; house - keeping genes ( expressed in >= 14 tissues ) ; short / long : genes shorter / longer than 24 kb in length ; regulatory genes : genes with regulatory role , they are either transcription factors or and / or harbour at least one post - translational modification in encoded protein .
data integration and assembly our study uses the following distinct data sets : 1 .
the list of human genes along with their phylostrata of origin was downloaded from ( domazet - loso and tautz [ 10 ]) ( ensembl version 45 - 22,937 unique proteins ) .
2. expression data from massively parallel signature sequencing ( mpss ) covering 182,719 tag signatures across 32 tissues [ 25 ] .
3. these two datasets were merged to form a single list of 12,753 genes with phylostrata of origin and expression abundance .
4. the complete list of tfs was retrieved from bibliosphere [ 26 ] .
data for ptm for human data were obtained from the most recent version of human protein reference database ( hprd - release 7 ) [ 27 ] .
although tf and ptm bring about regulatory mechanisms at different phases of cellular process , we have combined tf and ptm and refer to them as simply regulators in order to capture the maximum regulatory apparatus in eukaryotes .
5. the interaction data comprising 55,606 true positive interactions among 7,197 genes were downloaded from functional studies [ 19 ] .
6. the information for disease association of genes was obtained from omim ( online mendelian inheritance in man ) database [ 3 ] with 2,522 of them defined as disease - causing ( i.e. , associated with either known disease phenotype or polymorphic sequence known ) .
awk and perl scripts were written to assemble and analyse data on a linux server .
statistical analyses and significance when relationships were based on pearson correlation and partial correlation coefficients , statistical significance was assessed using the procedure corr of sas version 9.1.3 ( sas institute inc. , cary , nc , usa ) .
when proportions were being compared , a two - tailed z - test for the difference between two proportions was performed assuming unequal group variances as described by ap statistics tutorial ( http :// stattrek.com / ap - statistics - 4 / test - difference - proportion.aspx ) .
as a guide , the reader is reminded that having any two proportions each computed with more than 1,000 records , if these two proportions differ by more than 2 % then the difference is significant at p < 5 % significance ( or 95 % confidence ) .
least square means for the number of connections across the levels of the various class variables were obtained from fitting linear models using the procedure glm ( general linear models ) of sas version 9.1.3 ( sas institute inc. , cary , nc , usa ) .
a two - sided t - test was used to test the significance of the difference between two least square means of interest ( eg. connections in dis vs connection in ndis genes ) .

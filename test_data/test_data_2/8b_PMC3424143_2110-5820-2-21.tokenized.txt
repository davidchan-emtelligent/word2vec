background previous studies have shown a good agreement between central venous pressure ( cvp ) measurements from catheters placed in superior vena cava and catheters placed in the abdominal cava / common iliac vein .
however , the influence of intra - abdominal pressure on such measurements remains unknown .
methods we conducted a prospective , observational study in a tertiary teaching hospital .
we enrolled patients who had indwelling catheters in both superior vena cava ( double lumen catheter ) and femoroiliac veins ( dialysis catheter ) and into the bladder .
pressures were measured from all the sites , cvp , femoroiliac venous pressure ( fivp ) , and intra - abdominal pressure .
results a total of 30 patients were enrolled ( age 62 +/ - 14 years ; saps ii 62 ( 52 - 76 )) .
fifty complete sets of measurements were performed .
all of the studied patients were mechanically ventilated ( pep 3 cmh20 ( 2 - 5 )) .
we observed that the concordance between cvp and fivp decreased when intra - abdominal pressure increased .
we identified 14 mmhg as the best intra - abdominal pressure cutoff , and we found that cvp and fivp were significantly more in agreement below this threshold than above ( 94 % versus 50 % , p = 0.002 ) .
conclusions we reported that intra - abdominal pressure affected agreement between cvp measurements from catheter placed in superior vena cava and catheters placed in the femoroiliac vein .
agreement was excellent when intra - abdominal pressure was below 14 mmhg .
intensive unit care central venous pressure superior vena cava femoroiliac vena intra - abdominal pressure background central venous pressure ( cvp ) is a hemodynamic parameter required in critically ill patients [ 1 ] .
conventionally , venous access is preferred via the internal jugular or subclavian vein with measurements of cvp in the superior vena cava above the right atrium .
however , this approach is potentially hazardous , risking carotid artery puncture , pneumothorax , and neurologic damage [ 2,3 ] .
central venous access also may be achieved via the femoral vein by positioning the catheter in the abdominal cava / common iliac vein or in the right atrium depending of the length of the catheter .
nahum et al. reported a good correlation and agreement between cvp measurements from catheter placed in the right atrium and catheters placed in the abdominal cava / common iliac vein in children [ 4 ] .
joynt 's group confirmed these data in adults .
they showed an equally good agreement between measurement of cvp in the superior vena cava above the right atrium and measurements recorded from long ( 40 - 70 cm ) and short ( 15 - 20 cm ) catheters placed in the inferior vena cava , respectively , close to right atrium [ 5 ] and in the common iliac vein [ 6 ] .
moreover , the mode of mechanical ventilation did not affect overall agreement between measurements [ 7 ] .
in the intensive unit care ( icu ) , various clinical conditions , such as post - abdominal surgery , trauma , sepsis , pancreatic , and burns can lead to an increase of the intra - abdominal pressure [ 8 ] .
the worst threatening condition , called abdominal compartment syndrome , alters global hemodynamic status , organ perfusion mainly through a decrease of venous return [ 9 ] and can cause death .
we hypothesized that intra - abdominal hypertension could alter measurement of venous pressure and modify agreement between measurements from catheter placed in the superior vena cava , reflecting cvp , and catheter placed in the femoroiliac vein .
we conducted a prospective , observational study to compare pressure measured in the superior vena cava ( cvp ) and in the femoroiliac vein ( fivp ) according to intra - abdominal pressure .
methods this study was classified as observational by the institutional review board of our hospital ( comite de protection des personnes de l'hopital saint - antoine ) .
after obtaining oral consent from the patients or from their nearest relatives , we included consecutive patients who had indwelling catheters in both the superior vena cava and femoroiliac veins .
patients were under mechanical ventilation ( assisted control ventilation mode ) and adapted to the ventilator .
standard double - lumen catheters and renal dialysis catheters ( 20 - cm long ) were all used in this study to measure respectively superior vena cava pressure ( cvp ) and femoroiliac venous pressure ( fivp ) .
all catheters used in this study were already in place and justified by the patient 's clinical condition ; no catheter was specifically inserted for the sole purpose of the study .
patients could be included twice if the second set of measurements was performed more than 7 days after the first inclusion .
venous pressure measurements were recorded at both sites by using the same pressure transducer .
before the measurements , a zero pressure calibration during the tele - expiratory period was performed on each catheter , with the patient in a supine position .
all pressure measurements ( intra - abdominal and venous ) were repeated four times at 5 - min intervals during the tele - expiratory period , and mean values were calculated .
intra - abdominal pressure was measured indirectly by measuring the pressure within the bladder , as described by cheatham et al .
[ 10 ] .
briefly , two , three - way stopcocks are connected serially to a disposable pressure transducer .
a standard intravenous infusion set is connected to 1 l of sterile normal saline and attached to one stopcock , and a 20 - ml syringe is attached to the second stopcock .
an 18 - gauge angiocatheter is inserted into the culture aspiration port of the urinary drainage tube using aseptic technique .
the needle is removed , leaving the plastic infusion catheter in place .
the infusion catheter is attached to the first stopcock via pressure tubing .
the system is flushed with normal saline and the pressure transducer " zeroed " at the level of the symphysis pubis .
to measure intra - abdominal pressure , the urinary drainage tube is clamped immediately distal to the catheter .
the stopcocks are turned off to the patient and to the pressure transducer .
normal saline is aspirated from the intravenous bag using the 20 - ml syringe .
the first stopcock is turned on to the patient , and the normal saline ( 20 ml ) is instilled into the bladder through the urinary catheter [ 11 ] .
the stopcocks are then turned off to the syringe and intravenous tubing .
the clamp on the urinary drainage tubing is momentarily released to ensure that all air is flushed from the urinary catheter .
the patient 's intra - abdominal pressure is then measured at end - expiration .
the clamp is removed and the bladder allowed to drain .
exclusion criteria were mechanical ventilation mode different than acv and agitation , and disadaptation to the ventilator that troubled superior vena cava pressure measurements .
statistical analysis data were expressed as mean +/ - standard deviation or median ( interquartile range ) in the case of non - gaussian distribution .
the intraclass correlation coefficient ( icc ) was used to assess concordance between fivp and cvp .
icc values > 0.8 correspond to an " excellent " agreement ( landis and koch ) .
to assess the impact of intra - abdominal pressure , the icc was calculated for subsets of patients with less than a given intra - abdominal pressure threshold .
the threshold value was systematically varied from x to y to find the best intra - abdominal pressure cutoff ; x was the lower intra - abdominal pressure obtained in this study and y the highest .
after identification of the best intra - abdominal pressure cutoff , the icc was compared for observations below and above the threshold using a bootstrap - based test .
finally , in observations where the intra - abdominal pressure was less than the optimal cutoff , a linear regression model was used to predict cvp from fivp .
we hypothesized that agreement would be very good in practice ( icc ~ 90 %) when intra - abdominal pressure was low .
including 15 patients was sufficient to get a lower 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) > 70 % .
assuming that the prevalence of large iap could be up to 50 % , we finally included 30 patients .
all analyses were made by using r software ( v 2.9.1 ; http :// cran.r - project.org ) .
results between february 2009 and august 2010 , 30 consecutive patients were enrolled , and 50 complete sets of measurements were performed ( table 1 ) .
all patients had a subclavicular or jugular catheter for drug infusion and a 20 - cm long , femoral catheter for renal dialysis .
the position of catheter in the superior vena cava was confirmed by radiography , within 5 cm to the junction vena cava - right atrium .
we observed during a preliminary study using abdominal ct scan that 20 - cm long , femoral catheters were placed at the junction iliac vein / inferior vena cava .
all of the studied patients were mechanically ventilated and had acute renal failure requiring dialysis .
in the group with a pia >= 14 mmhg , patients had mostly intra - abdominal infection or abdominal surgery , whereas in the group of patients with a pia < 14 mmhg , admission diagnoses were various , such as lung infection and cardiac arrest ( table 2 ) .
among patients admitted for septic shock , the proportion of cirrhosis with ascites was more important in the group with high iap ( 5 / 8 versus 3 / 12 patients ) .
severity was high as illustrated by high saps ii. table 1 characteristic of included patients patients ( n ) 30 weight ( kg ) 80 +/ - 16 bmi ( kg / m2 ) 29.8 +/ - 6.3 gender ( m / f ) 15 / 15 age ( yr ) 62 +/ - 14 saps ii 62 ( 52 - 76 ) dialysis , n (%) 30 ( 100 ) vasopressors , n (%) 27 ( 90 ) plateau pressure ( cmh20 ) 20 ( 18 - 25 ) peep ( cm h20 ) 3 ( 2 - 5 ) table 2 causes of admission according to the intra - abdominal pressure ( iap ) pia < 14 mmhg pia >= 14 mmhg septic shock septic shock lung ( 7 ) lung ( 2 ) abdomen ( 4 ) abdomen ( 4 ) soft tissue ( 1 ) urinary tract ( 1 ) urinary tractus ( 1 ) unlocalized bacteriemia ( 1 ) endocarditis ( 1 ) unlocalized bacteriemia ( 1 ) liver transplantation ( 2 ) acute alcoholic hepatitis ( 2 ) acute alcoholic hepatitis ( 2 ) cardiac arrest ( 4 ) gut occlusion ( 1 ) cardiogenic shock ( 3 ) mesenteric infarction ( 1 ) help syndrome ( 2 ) self poisoning ( 2 ) other ( 8 ) interestingly , we observed that the concordance between cvp and fivp measurements decreased when intra - abdominal pressure increased ( figure 1 ) .
the icc was 0.94 ( 95 % ci [ 0.89 - 0.97 ]) , corresponding to excellent agreement on the landis and koch scale , when considering patients with intra - abdominal pressure < 14 mmhg .
the icc reduced to 0.77 ( 95 % ci [ 0.41 - 0.94 ]) when patients with intra - abdominal pressure < 15 mmhg were added , and concordance decreased even more as patients with larger intra - abdominal pressure values were considered ( figure 1 ) .
therefore , concordance between cvp and fivp was best when iap was < 14 mmhg .
cvp and fivp were significantly more in agreement below this threshold than above ( 0.94 versus 0.5 , p = 0.002 ; figure 2 ) .
figure 1 intraclass correlation coefficient ( icc ) for patients with intra - abdominal pressure less than a given value ( dots for icc values and lines for 95 % confidence interval ) .
when patients with high intra - abdominal pressure were added , icc decreased .
figure 2 intraclass correlation coefficient according to intra - abdominal pressure cutoff .
less than 14 mmhg , agreement between fivp and cvp measurements was excellent and better than situations when intra - abdominal pressure was > 14 mmhg ( 0.94 versus 0.5 , p = 0.002 ) .
fivp , femoroiliac venous pressure ; cvp , central venous pressure .
boxes show first and third quartiles , with the median as a thick line .
whiskers extend to 1.5 interquartile range ( q75 - q25 ) .
as expected from the large concordance , cvp was very well predicted by fivp in patients with intra - abdominal pressure < 14 mmhg .
the linear regression equation was cvp = 1.01 fivp ( r2 = 0.99 ; figure 3 ) .
figure 3 less than 14 mmhg ( black circle ) fivp reflected cvp , the linear regression equation was cvp = 1.01 fivp .
greater than 14 mmhg ( white circle ) , fivp overestimated cvp .
fivp , femoroiliac venous pressure ; cvp , central venous pressure .
discussion our results showed that the fivp could be used to estimate correctly cvp and confirmed previous published studies in adults and children in icu [ 4,5 ] .
however , we pointed out that fivp measurement accuracy had to be interpreted according to the intra - abdominal pressure .
when intra - abdominal pressure was inferior to 14 mmhg , fivp predicted very well cvp .
when intra - abdominal pressure was more than 14 mmhg , corresponding to the first stage of intra - abdominal hypertension , fivp did not reflect accurately cvp anymore .
the difference could be large ( median 4 ( range 0 - 18 )) and was always in the direction fivp > cvp .
interestingly , this cutoff was close to the threshold ( 12 mmhg ) that defines intra - abdominal hypertension according to the international conference of experts on intra - abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome [ 12 ] .
it is not exactly the same value of cutoff probably because the studied population size was limited .
in case of severe intra - abdominal hypertension ( iap > 20 mmhg ) , de keulenaer et al .
[ 13 ] recently reported that fivp could be used as a surrogate measure of iap , illustrating the link between fivp and iap .
the consequences during severe infections , if physicians followed survival sepsis campaign guidelines for fluid administration , could be an underestimation of hypovolemia in these patients , a delay for fluid challenge and could in fine worsen patient 's prognosis [ 14 ] .
the effects of intra - abdominal pressure on fivp measurements are relevant , because abdominal compartment syndrome is not rare in icu ( from 1 - 20 % according to published data ) and is frequently underestimated [ 15 ] .
more generally , this study questions about the effects of intra - abdominal pressure on others hemodynamic tools used in the clinical setting to evaluate volemia .
for example , passive leg raising was reported by several groups to be a good predictor of fluid responsiveness [ 16 ] .
however , mahjoub et al. showed that the passive left raising maneuver did not accurately predict fluid responsiveness in patients with intra - abdominal hypertension [ 17 ] .
our study has several limitations .
it is a monocentric study and results have to be confirmed in a larger population .
nevertheless , although the size of this preliminary study was not very large , it was sufficient to highlight significant results .
intra - abdominal pressure was recorded indirectly by using intra - bladder pressure , but this technique had achieved a widespread adoption worldwide .
finally , our studied population did not have severe pulmonary disease : median peep was 3 cmh2o ( 2 - 5 ) and median plateau pressure was 20 cmh2o ( 18 - 25 ) .
therefore , our data could not be extrapolated to clinical situations with lung injury and / or high peep and / or high intrathoracic pressure , but we could speculate that , in these situations , agreement between central and femoroiliac venous pressure would be strongly altered .
the impact of increased intra - abdominal pressure on agreement between cvp and fivp was documented using short catheters ( 20 - cm long ) and could not be extrapolated to measurements obtained using longer catheters , which tip arise right atrium .
conclusions we reported the effects of intra - abdominal pressure on venous pressure measurements .
when the intra - abdominal pressure was inferior to 14 mmhg , femoroiliac pressure predicted very well central venous pressure .
however , when intra - abdominal pressure is > 14 mmhg , femoroiliac pressure did not and intra - class correlation coefficient decreased from 94 % to 50 % .

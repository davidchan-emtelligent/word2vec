a fullerene glycoconjugate carrying two lactose units was synthesized by a [ 3 + 2 ] cycloaddition reaction between c60 and the azide group in 6 - azidohexyl beta - lactoside per - o - acetate .
a colloidal aqueous solution with brown color was prepared from deprotected bis ( lactosyl ) - c60 and was found stable for more than 6 months keeping its red color .
upon mixing with an aqueous solution of ricinus communis agglutinin ( rca120 ) , the colloidal solution soon caused precipitations , while becoming colorless and transparent .
in contrast , a solution of concanavalin a ( con a ) caused no apparent change , indicating that the precipitation was caused specifically by carbohydrate - protein interactions .
this notable phenomenon was quantified by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) , and the results were discussed in terms of detection and decontamination of the deadly biological toxin in the ricinus communis family .
fullerene multivalent glycosystems oligosaccharides proteotoxins ricin this article is part of the thematic series " multivalent glycosystems for nanoscience " .
introduction carbohydrate - binding proteins ( lectins ) and proteotoxins , e.g. , verotoxins [ 1 - 2 ] and cholera toxins [ 3 ] , can cause serious damages to human cells .
the carbohydrate binding proteins are able to interact with cell - surface glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins and glycolipids to aggregate the cells .
proteotoxins penetrate into the target cells after binding with glycoconjugates and disturb vital cell functions .
ricin , a proteotoxin isolated from the castor bean of the ricinus communis family , is one of the strongest biological toxins and is registered as a scheduled compound in the chemical weapon convention [ 4 ] .
ricin consists of a subunit a with ribonuclease activity and a subunit b possessing carbohydrate - binding domains specific to beta - lactosyl linkage [ 5 - 6 ] .
in the past years , the development of proteotoxin infection inhibitors based on carbohydrate molecules has attracted great interest [ 7 - 8 ] .
in particular , multivalent biomaterials carrying more than two carbohydrate ligands have been designed [ 9 - 15 ] and proven to enhance protein - carbohydrate interactions by means of glycocluster effects [ 16 - 18 ] .
more recently , our research group has reported on attempts of applying these glycomaterials for both the detection and the decontamination of biological toxins in an assumed polluted scene [ 19 - 21 ] .
in the present study , we attempted to apply our n - glycosyl - [ 60 ] fullerenes [ 22 - 25 ] , which were designed as a novel class of glycolipids with notable biological and physical properties .
for example , bis ( alpha - d - mannopyranosyl ) - [ 60 ] fullerene is capable of forming a liposome - like supramolecule in aqueous media and exhibits a strong binding activity to an alpha - mannose - binding lectin ( concanavalin a , con a ) as the result not only of carbohydrate cluster effects but also of a unique spatial arrangement of the bis ( mannosyl ) linkage on the [ 60 ] fullerene surface [ 25 ] .
in this paper , we describe our first synthesis of bis ( beta - lactosyl ) - [ 60 ] fullerene and its potential as a tool for detecting and decontaminating the deadly biological toxin , ricin .
results and discussion in our preceding studies [ 24 - 25 ] , we have shown that bis ( alpha - mannosyl ) - [ 60 ] fullerene can be obtained by a coupling reaction between 1 - azidoalkyl per - o - acetyl - glycoside and c60 together with [ 5,6 ] - and [ 6,6 ] - junction isomers of mono ( alpha - mannosyl ) - [ 60 ] fullerene .
the bis ( glycosyl ) adduct is more polar than the two monoadducts and can be easily separated by silica gel column chromatography .
taking these preceding results into account , we prepared the bis ( beta - lactosyl ) - [ 60 ] fullerene ( bis - lac - c60 , fig. 1 ) in the present study .
figure 1 structure of bis ( beta - lactosyl ) - [ 60 ] fullerene ( bis - lac - c60 ) .
synthesis of bis ( per - o - acetyl - beta - lactosyl ) - [ 60 ] fullerene 4 the bis ( lactosyl ) - fullerene has been prepared from lactosyl trichloroacetimidate 1 [ 26 ] following a pathway as shown in scheme 1 [ 25 ] .
the coupling reaction between 1 and 6 - chloro - 1 - hexanol was conducted in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate ( tmsotf ) to yield beta - lactoside 2 .
the nucleophilic substitution of the terminal chloride group in 2 with sodium azide afforded glycosyl azide 3 .
the thermal cycloaddition of the azide group to c60 was conducted by boiling in chlorobenzene to obtain a mixture of the three main products , which were identified as a mixture of [ 5,6 ] - and [ 6,6 ] - fused isomers of monoadducts and the targeted bisadduct 4 in tlc analysis .
4 was purified with chromatography on silica gel and identified with nmr and ms spectroscopy as the desired bis ( per - o - acetyl - beta - lactosyl ) - [ 60 ] fullerene ( experimental and supporting information information file 1 ) .
scheme 1 synthesis of bis - lac - c60 .
reagents and conditions : ( a ) 6 - chloro - 1 - hexanol , tmsotf , ch2cl2 , - 40 degreesc , 1 h , 48 % ; ( b ) nan3 , dmf , 60 degreesc , 16 h , 93 % ; ( c ) c60 , chlorobenzene , reflux , 7 h , 14 % ; ( d ) naome , ch2cl2 , meoh , 5 h. preparation of colloidal suspension of bis ( beta - lactosyl ) - [ 60 ] fullerene ( bis - lac - c60 ) all acetyl groups in 4 were removed with sodium methoxide in a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol .
during this process , the reaction mixture deposited aggregates of bis - lac - c60 , which were collected by filtration and washed thoroughly with methanol .
the aggregates were diluted with dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) and dialyzed against distilled water for 2 days to give a colloidal suspension of bis - lac - c60 with a deep brown color .
the derived suspension was stable for at least 6 months when stored at 4 degreesc in the dark .
dynamic light scattering ( dls ) analysis indicated that the colloidal suspension might involve spherical particles with two different sizes , smaller particles with a diameter range of 30 - 50 nm ( av 39.6 +/ - 6.7 nm ) and larger particles with a diameter range of 150 - 170 nm ( av 162 +/ - 29 nm ) .
we observed analogous results for colloidal suspensions of mono - and bis ( alpha - d - mannopyranosyl ) - [ 60 ] fullerenes in both afm ( atomic force microscopy ) and dls analyses .
probably , the smaller particles are bilayer vesicles that are stable in dmso and pyridine while they can be destructed in parts by treatment with surfactants such as triton - x [ 25 ] .
these nano - sized constructs tend to attract each other to form the larger particles , and this tendency seems to be pronounced in polar aqueous solvents .
precipitation assay for the colloidal suspension of bis - lac - c60 with proteins of the ricinus communis family with the colloidal suspension of bis - lac - c60 in hand , precipitation tests were conducted with ricinus communis agglutinin ( rca120 ) [ 27 ] , ricin and concanavalin a ( con a ) [ 28 ] .
rca120 is a ricin - like lectin and able to bind beta - galactose residues .
con a is an alpha - mannose - specific lectin .
when rca120 ( 10 mul , 20 mug ml - 1 ) was added to this suspension ( 0.1 ml , 300 mum ) , the suspension soon gave rise to dark brown precipitate ( fig. 2 ) .
the precipitate was collected by centrifugation , washed thoroughly with water , and then applied to sds - page .
a clear band was observed at the region matching with rca120 , supporting that this lectin was directly associated with the sedimentation .
also upon the addition of ricin , a similar phenomenon could be observed , even though the precipitation took a prolonged time ( ca. 15 min ) in comparison with the case of rca120 ( ca. 2 min ) .
apparently , the proteotoxin possesses a lower ability to crosslink the [ 60 ] fullerene vesicles into larger sediments , though the reason is unknown .
in contrast , no precipitation could be found in the negative control , which were composed of the same pbs buffer solution albeit free from these proteins .
in addition , con a in the same pbs buffer solution could not induce any sedimentation ( fig. 2 and fig. 2 ) .
these observations allowed us to expect that the sedimentary phenomenon might arise from species - specific interactions of the ricinus communis proteins with the lactose cluster arrayed on the surface of the [ 60 ] fullerene vesicles .
in nature , there are a lot of beta - lactose - binding proteins .
not only to the ricinus communis proteins but also to many other beta - lactose or beta - d - galactose - binding proteins , the beta - lactose cluster arrayed on the surface of the [ 60 ] fullerene vesicles may become an ideal ligand .
in this context , the sedimentary reaction is not specific to the proteins from the ricinus communis family .
probably , in an assumed polluted scene , the colloidal suspension of the bis ( beta - lactosyl ) - [ 60 ] fullerene will be useful to check the presence of ricin - like proteins .

quantitative analysis of ricin protein in the bis - lac - c60 colloidal suspension by means of sds - page the above results have suggested that the ricinus communis toxins and probably also other lactose - binding proteins can crosslink the vesicles of bis - lac - c60 and then deposit aggregates at the bottom .
if this holds true , the vesicles of bis - lac - c60 can serve as decontaminants to remove ricin and related proteins from dangerous areas contaminated with biological toxins .
in this section , we report on the examination of the behavior of ricin protein in the bis - lac - c60 suspension by estimating its distribution (%) in both the supernatant and the aggregate after the sedimentation .
the test samples were prepared in a manner as summarized in fig. 3. a ricin solution was added to the suspension of bis - lac - c60 at different concentrations in the range of 1 - 100 mum .
the mixtures were allowed to stand for 10 min and then centrifuged at 10 000g for 10 min .
the amount of ricin remaining in the aqueous phase was quantified from the intensity of the protein band in sds - page .
the amounts were calibrated with standard samples with known concentrations .
figure 3 schematic image for the quantitative analysis of ricin protein in the colloidal suspension of bis - lac - c60 .
though bradford and lowry methods might be useful for this kind of protein assays , the strong uv - vis absorbance of the c60 chromophore interfered with these established methodologies .
therefore , we undertook an alternative way by means of the sds - page .
the results summarized in table 1 show that the ricin protein was partitioned into two phases , i.e. , solid phase ( precipitates ) and liquid phase ( supernatants ) , after the sedimentation .
its distribution (%) in the solid phase increased with the concentration of bis - lac - c60 .
at 100 mum , most of the protein ( 94 %) was deposited at the bottom as aggregates ( run 4 in table 1 ) .
these results support our previous suggestion that the sedimentary reaction in the colloidal suspension is based on toxin - lactose interactions and thus is useful for a simple detection of the biological toxin .

obviously , a simple and highly effective method is required for this purpose .
we have recognized in the above study that the colloidal suspension of bis - lac - c60 can deposit ricin in more than 90 % efficiency in a structural form of " protein - lactose aggregates. " this means that the bis ( beta - lactosyl ) - [ 60 ] fullerene can provide us with a promising tool to tackle the deadly toxin .
at the end of this study , we attempted to establish our protocol for the rapid detection and the efficient decontamination of ricin and ricin - like proteins .
the overall protocol examined here is schemed in fig. 4. though this is similar to that already shown in fig. 3 , the total manipulation time was shortened to 20 min and the decontamination efficiency was improved by a brine - induced salting - out effect .
figure 4 a modified procedure for the rapid detection and the efficient decontamination of ricin and ricin - like proteins .
first , an aqueous ricin solution was added to the colloidal suspension of bis - lac - c60 .
for the first 2 minutes , the suspension gave no apparent sediment .
upon addition of brine , the mixture soon generated precipitates .
after standing for another 3 minutes , the mixture was centrifuged and analyzed with sds - page in the same manner as described previously ( see also experimental ). by changing concentrations of both brine and bis - lac - c60 solutions , we optimized the conditions for locking this toxin at the bottom effectively .
the results are summarized in table 2 .
at a constant bis - lac - c60 concentration ( 183 mum or 363 mum ) , the decontamination efficiency (%) increased with the concentration of brine .
the efficiency reached 99 % at 500 mm brine concentration and 363 mum bis - lac - c60 ( run 6 in table 2 ) .
consequently , the modified procedure enabled us to decontaminate ricin with > 99 % efficiency within 20 min .

conclusion a bis ( beta - lactosyl ) - [ 60 ] fullerene was synthesized and evaluated as a novel class of glycolipid in the form of a red - colored colloidal suspension in aqueous medium .
its potency was obvious in the precipitation assay by using ricinus communis proteins , which soon precipitated at the bottom while the red - colored suspension changed to colorless transparent solution .
the observed phenomenon , which is based on multivalent protein - lactose interactions , prompted us to apply this glycolipid as a tool for the rapid detection and the decontamination of ricin and other biological toxins. by using an sds - page analysis , we successfully quantified distributions (%) of ricin in the aqueous and the solid phase. with this analytical tool in hands , we have also optimized the reaction conditions and proposed two protocols .
the first protocol facilitates the detection , the second protocol allows for both the detection and the decontamination .
the latter enabled us to deposit the toxin at the bottom of polluted solutions with efficiency greater than 99 % .
obviously , the lactosyl - [ 60 ] fullerene provides us with a simple and powerful tool for tackling such dangerous toxins that aggregate our cells and / or penetrate into cells by a common way of protein - carbohydrate interactions .

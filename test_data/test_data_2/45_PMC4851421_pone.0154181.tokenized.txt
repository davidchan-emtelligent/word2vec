background the success of collapsing methods which investigate the combined effect of rare variants on complex traits has so far been limited .
the manner in which variants within a gene are selected prior to analysis has a crucial impact on this success , which has resulted in analyses conventionally filtering variants according to their consequence .
this study investigates whether an alternative approach to filtering , using annotations from recently developed bioinformatics tools , can aid these types of analyses in comparison to conventional approaches .
methods & results we conducted a candidate gene analysis using the uk10k sequence and lipids data , filtering according to functional annotations using the resource cadd ( combined annotation - dependent depletion ) and contrasting results with ' nonsynonymous' and ' loss of function ' consequence analyses .
using cadd allowed the inclusion of potentially deleterious intronic variants , which was not possible when filtering by consequence .
overall , different filtering approaches provided similar evidence of association , although filtering according to cadd identified evidence of association between angptl4 and high density lipoproteins ( p = 0.02 , n = 3,210 ) which was not observed in the other analyses .
we also undertook genome - wide analyses to determine how filtering in this manner compared to conventional approaches for gene regions .
results suggested that filtering by annotations according to cadd , as well as other tools known as fathmm - mkl and dann , identified association signals not detected when filtering by variant consequence and vice versa .
conclusion incorporating variant annotations from non - coding bioinformatics tools should prove to be a valuable asset for rare variant analyses in the future .
filtering by variant consequence is only possible in coding regions of the genome , whereas utilising non - coding bioinformatics annotations provides an opportunity to discover unknown causal variants in non - coding regions as well .
this should allow studies to uncover a greater number of causal variants for complex traits and help elucidate their functional role in disease .

introduction genome wide association studies ( gwas ) have had a profound influence on the number of disease associated common variants detected across the genome , although recently a greater emphasis has been placed on the impact that rarer variants can have on disease [ 1 , 2 ] .
the advent of next generation sequencing ( ngs ) has facilitated the development of rare variant association approaches by collapsing variants within the same gene together and analysing their combined effect on phenotypic traits [ 3 ] .
the aim of current endeavors is to identify deleterious regions of variants with potentially larger effect sizes than those typically identified in gwas [ 4 ] , subsequently improving the explained heritability of common diseases .
furthermore , rare variant analyses can help identify genes that are relevant to a particular disease , where evidence gained from single variant approaches may be limited .
rare variant association studies have had varying degrees of success in recent years [ 5 , 6 ] .
the number of variants with little to no effect ( neutral variants ) and also variants with contrasting directions of effect within a collapsed region often weaken the statistical power of analyses .
as a result , methods based around the analysis of variance - components ( e.g. c - alpha [ 7 ] , sequence kernel association test ( skat )[ 8 ]) have been developed to overcome these challenges .
furthermore , filtering variants by their functional consequence ( e.g. only analysing variants within a region that are predicted to have a ' nonsynonymous' or ' loss of function ' impact ) has become common practice to reduce the potential number of neutral variants within a collapsed region or functional unit .
filtering in this manner can have limitations for several reasons .
firstly , even if a variant is annotated correctly , this does not necessarily mean that it will have a deleterious effect ( e.g. if a nonsynonymous variant is located within the transmembrane region of a receptor gene it may not drastically alter the function of the protein ) .
secondly , it is also possible that other types of variants within the coding region of the gene ( i.e. silent mutations ) can potentially have a deleterious effect but may get filtered out .
lastly , filtering variants according to their consequence is limited to coding regions , therefore making annotations for filtering non - coding regions ( i.e. intronic regions of a gene or intergenic regions of the genome ) an attractive commodity , particularly with the current influx of whole genome sequence ( wgs ) data .
the combined annotation - dependent depletion ( cadd )[ 9 ] method objectively integrates a range of different annotation metrics into a single measure ( c score ). by doing so , cadd aims to provide a more reliable estimate of deleteriousness for all known variants and therefore an overall rank for this metric across the genome .
other bioinformatics tools , such as sift [ 10 ] and polyphen - 2 [ 11 ] have previously been used to filter variants for rare variant analyses [ 12 ] , although importantly these tools use protein - based metrics and are therefore confined to coding regions .
although cadd has been used to further evaluate the impact of snps after identification in association studies , this resource has not yet been utilised to filter variants according to prior knowledge about likely function before undertaking a low frequency or rare variant association analysis .
we therefore hypothesised that , in comparison to filtering by variant consequence , using cadd may be more informative in identifying functional variants for a complex trait , whilst keeping the number of neutral variants to a minimum .
moreover , when applying collapsing methods to gene regions , cadd allows analyses to be undertaken in intronic regions of the gene which can potentially harbour functional variants [ 13 ] , which would not be possible when filtering by variant consequence or prediction tools confined to coding regions .
using wgs data from the uk10k project ( http :// www.uk10k.org ) , we have undertaken low frequency and rare variant analyses to evaluate whether filtering variants according to cadd scaled c - scores identifies association signals not detected when filtering according to variant consequence .
our hypothesis was that incorporating non - coding bioinformatics annotations based on predicted variant functionality would be a valuable asset for future studies which conduct these types of approaches .
results 3,781 whole - genome samples from the uk10k cohort arm [ 14 ] were available for analysis ( 1,927 from alspac , 1,854 from twinsuk ) after variant calling and quality control .
after merging individuals with each cardiovascular , final sample sizes ranged between 3,538 and 3,191 ( 3,538 for body mass index ( bmi ) , 3,309 for systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( sbp & dbp ) , 3,210 for high density lipoproteins ( hdl ) , 3,191 for low density lipoproteins ( ldl ) , 3,206 for total cholesterol ( tc ) and 3,202 for triglycerides ( tg )) .
candidate gene analysis we used cadd [ 9 ] to obtain scaled c scores for all 44.9 million possible variants and indels in the uk10k whole genome sequence data .
after removing variants which failed qc , we filtered all variants in three ways : variants responsible for a ' nonsynonymous' substitution according to the variant effect predictor [ 15 ] ( vep ) .
vcftools [ 16 ] was subsequently used to condense these regions down to just those variants .
variants responsible for a ' loss of function ' according to vep ( i.e. ' stop losses / gains ' , ' splice sites' or ' frameshift indels ') .
vcftools was used again to condense these regions down to just those variants .
variants with a cadd c - score >= 15 ( i.e. the 5 % most damaging variants predicted across the genome ) .
this is a suggested cutoff by the developers of cadd to identify potentially pathogenic variants as it is the median value for all possible canonical splice site changes and nonsynonymous variants ( http :// cadd.gs.washington.edu / info ) .
we collapsed variants together across candidate genes and analysed them using skat [ 8 ] with their associated traits according to liu et al [ 17 ] .
these genes were angptl4 , bcam , cblc , cd300lg , hnf4a , ldlr , lipc , lipg , lpl , pcsk9 and pvr .
analyses were repeated after applying each variant filtering method , as well as applying two different minor allele frequency ( maf ) cutoffs of maf <= 5 % and maf <= 1 % .
importantly , filtering by variant consequence was confined to coding regions , whereas filtering by cadd definitions also allowed the inclusion of potentially deleterious non - coding variants which reside in intronic regions of genes .
the results of this analysis , as well as those in subsequent analyses of this study , were not adjusted for multiple comparisons .
this was because we were interested in the comparison of filtering approaches in terms of identifying association signals , rather than evaluating whether these signals are real , which is important for analyses regardless of filtering method .
furthermore , the same number of analyses were conducted for each filtering method as this would have otherwise incorporated bias into the study .
using a maf cutoff of 5 % , we observed evidence of association between lipg and hdl ( p = 0.02 ) as well as between pvr and ldl ( p = 0.02 ) after filtering to only include nonsynonymous variants .
for the loss of function variant analyses , cd300lg , bcam and angptl4 were associated with hdl , ldl and tg respectively ( p = 0.02 , p = 0.04 and p = 0.03 ) .
using cadd to filter variants provided evidence of association between three of the previously mentioned genes and traits , as well as between angptl and hdl ( p = 0.02 ) .
the majority of these effects appeared to be driven by rare variants , as evidence of association was observed after applying a maf cutoff of 1 % .
the only exception to this was the association between lipg and hdl after filtering to include nonsynonymous variants , which did not provide strong evidence of association using this cutoff ( p = 0.07 ) .
tables 1 and 2 show the complete results of our gene - level low frequency variant and rare association analyses , using a cutoff of 5 % and 1 % maf respectively .

all p - values were calculated using skat .
genome - wide analysis of gene - based association signals using cadd we also identified variants with a cadd c - score >= 15 across the genome and aggregated them together across all gene regions according to ucsc definitions ( reference genome hg19 ) .
variants were then collapsed together and analysed with 7 cardiovascular traits ( bmi , sbp , dbp , hdl , ldl , tc & tg ) using skat after applying a maf cutoff of 5 % .
we repeated this process in a second set of analyses using a maf cutoff of 1 % to investigate rarer variation .
this process was repeated except filtering to include variants which led to a ' nonsynonymous' or ' loss - of - function ' consequence ( i.e. regardless of cadd c - score ) according to dbsnp annotations ( build 137 ) in two other separate sets of analyses .
only regions which had at least 2 variants remaining after filtering were eligible for analyses , as a single remaining variant would offer no added value when analysed using skat compared to using a single variant test .
gene - based p - values from the cadd filtered analyses were matched with p - values from the ' nonsynonymous' filtered analysis and the results were - log10 transformed and plotted for each trait and maf cutoff .
this meant that only genes which had at least 2 variants within their region after filtering in both sets of analyses ( i.e. >= 2 ' nonsynonymous' & >= 2 variants with a cadd c - score >= 15 ) were plotted on these graphs .
due to the frequency of points on these plots , overall trends would have been very challenging to identify using scatter plots .
we therefore used hexbin plots for this task [ 18 ] , which allows density of the number of points within each region of the plot to be incorporated .
overall there was little evidence that filtering according to cadd annotations provided either stronger or weaker evidence of association across the genome in comparison filtering by nonsynonymous consequence .
this can be observed in the hexbin plots as the gradient of colour is consistent through the plots and does not favour either axis .
moreover , some of the lowest gene - based p - values were only observed using one filtering approach for each trait , implying that there was not always strong concordance between the different methods ( i.e. evidence of association was only observed when using cadd filtering and vice versa ) .
figs 1 and 2 show the hexbin plots for the 4 lipid traits investigated in this analysis for low frequency ( maf <= 5 %) and rare variant ( maf <= 1 %) analyses respectively .
plots for the other cardiovascular traits can be found in the s1 file .

the y - axis represents the - log10 transformed p - value from the analysis after filtering according to ' nonsynonymous' annotations .
only gene regions which had at least 2 variants in them after filtering by both methods were plotted .
gene - based p - values from all cadd filtered analyses were also matched with those observed from the loss - of - function analyses .
however , simple scatter plots were sufficient for this data as there were far fewer than in the comparison with nonsynonymous filtering .
it is also worth clarifying that these loss - of - function variants may also have been included in the nonsynonymous analysis , as variants can be classed as both ( i.e. a variant which alters the amino acid sequence of a protein and also results in a stop codon ) .
as before , there was no overall trend to suggest that filtering using either approach provided stronger evidence of association with cardiovascular traits .
again there were results which represented a lack of concordance between filtering approaches , suggesting that evidence of association with traits would only be observed when filtering with one method but not the other .
scatter plots for these analyses can be found in s1 file .
plots were also generated for the results of identical analyses except using the skat - o [ 19 ] and mist [ 20 ] collapsing methods , although the overall findings were the same using these approaches .
these plots can also be found in s1 file .
genome - wide analysis of gene - based association signals using fathmm - mkl and dann the previous analysis was repeated except using two alternative bioinformatics tools rather than cadd .
these were fathmm - mkl [ 21 ] and dann [ 22 ] , which use a machine learning and deep neural network approach respectively to assess the functional consequence of variants .
the metrics for both tools are bounded between 0 and 1 , where a larger score means that variants are predicted to have a more deleterious effect .
applying a threshold of 0.9 for both tools ( i.e. only variants predicted to have a strong deleterious effect ) left 1,208,786 variants using fathmm - mkl and 1,331,967 variants using dann in our dataset .
fathmm - mkl and dann analyses were conducted separately .
analyses were undertaken as before , collapsing variants by gene regions and analysing them with each cardiovascular trait in turn after applying a maf cutoff of 5 % and 1 % .
gene regions were analysed twice using the skat - o and mist tests and only regions which had at least 2 variants after filtering were eligible for analysis .
hexbin and scatter plots were again used to display results compared to the ' nonsynonymous' results and the ' loss - of - function ' results respectively .
the fathmm - mkl plots suggested similar inferences to the cadd based analyses , whereas certain dann analyses using skat - o ( particularly for tg ) appeared to have more concordance with results using nonsynonymous annotations .
plots from all these analyses can be found in s1 file .
discussion we have conducted a candidate gene study to evaluate whether incorporating variant annotations using a non - coding bioinformatics tool can aid rare variant analyses over filtering by variant consequence .
filtering according to cadd provided evidence of association between genes and lipids similar to filtering by variant type , as well as moderate association between angptl4 and hdl ( p = 0.02 ) .
we have also undertaken extensive genome wide analyses to determine how filtering variants using bioinformatics annotations compares to filtering by variant consequence within gene regions , when conducting low frequency and rare variant collapsing analyses .
these results were plotted as hexbin and scatter plots , which suggested the different approaches to filtering variants yield different sets of associated loci .
the consequence of this meant that certain association signals were only detected when filtering by annotations from the bioinformatics tools and not according to variant consequence , and vice versa .
this suggests that future studies should benefit from this alternative approach to identify association signals potentially overlooked using conventional methods , due to the inclusion of non - coding regions which may harbour potentially deleterious variants .
the reason why this novel approach to filtering variants may identify association signals not detected when filtering by variant consequence could be influenced by several factors .
firstly , this could be due to the inclusion of predicted deleterious synonymous variants which therefore improves the statistical power of analyses .
furthermore , using these annotations may lead to removing predicted neutral nonsynonymous variants ( i.e. variants which alter amino acid sequence , but not the function of a protein ) which reduces the amount of statistical noise incorporated into analyses .
fig 1b of the cadd manuscript by kircher et al shows that a threshold of 15 should also be including a proportion of other types of variants ( e.g. which are predicted to be the most deleterious within each of their categories , along with the majority of nonsynonymous variants ) .
filtering using a non - coding algorithm also allows the inclusion of variants which reside in intronic regions of genes , which can also have functional consequences on human disease through altering regulator or splicing sequence [ 23 ] .
association signals driven by variants within these regions may therefore be of great importance in terms of disease aetiology , although collapsing approaches which filter by variant consequence are confined to coding regions of the genome and therefore these variants are not investigated .
incorporating non - coding bioinformatics annotations into rare variant analysis should therefore aid future studies in terms of addressing the limitations of conventional approaches .
the ability to adjust the inclusion threshold for variants when using prediction algorithm annotations is also advantageous to studies .
in this study , we have used a cadd c - score of >= 15 as our inclusion threshold , which is suggested by the authors of cadd to identify potentially pathogenic variants as it is the median value for all possible canonical splice site changes and nonsynonymous variants [ 9 ] .
however , the optimal threshold of cadd c - score to uncover causal variants may depend on several factors , such as the trait analysed. with the particular interest regarding the contribution that low frequency and rare variants can have on blood lipid levels currently [ 17 , 24 , 25 ] , we decided to analyse lipid and other cardiovascular traits in this study to evaluate our hypothesis .
however , filtering using bioinformatics annotations should also benefit analyses undertaken with other complex traits .
likewise , the length of a gene is another factor which may cause varying cutoffs to result in stronger evidence of association detected from analyses .
it may therefore be beneficial to use a stricter threshold ( i.e. more confidence that variants within a region are deleterious ) for larger gene regions , although this will likely depend on the hypothesis of the study .
in this study we have predominantly used the skat - o and mist tests as they have been reported to be amongst the most consistently powerful collapsing methods according to evaluations of gene - based tests [ 26 ] .
however , regardless of the choice over collapsing method when undertaking a rare variant analysis , the filtering phase is crucial to identifying association signals from causal variants .
although the 3 bioinformatics tools used in this study all have a similar purpose , the manner in which they accomplish this is quite varied .
to predict the effect of non - coding variants , cadd uses a support vector machine with a linear kernel , fathmm - mkl uses multiple kernel learning and dann uses a deep neural network .
moreover , even though cadd and dann use the same training data for their tools , fathmm - mkl uses pathogenic data from the human gene mutation database [ 27 ] and control data from the 1000 genomes project [ 28 ] .
as a result , the correlation between the annotations from these tools is not that strong , which is why they have all been utilised in this study ( cadd & fathmm - mkl = 0.62 , cadd & dann = 0.74 and dann & fathmm - mkl = 0.56 according to dbnsfp v3.0 [ 29 ]) .
despite the advances in low coverage sequencing techniques over the last few years , the majority of rare variant analyses applied to these data have been underwhelming [ 30 , 31 ] .
recently , studies have attempted to improve statistical power in their approaches by increasing their sample sizes [ 17 ] , adapting current methodological techniques [ 32 ] or conducting analyses on remote or isolated populations where the allele frequency of rarer variants may be heightened [ 33 ] .
we suggest that incorporating predicted functionality of variants into analyses ( based on the wealth of functional annotation data now available ) should prove to be a valuable and feasible addition to these options in identification of association signals for future studies .
moreover , there has been a greater emphasis recently on elucidating the functional role of variants [ 34 - 36 ] , for which filtering approaches using resources such as the bioinformatics tools utilised in this study could be integrated to great effect .
the fundamental question when filtering variants according to predicted function concerns the reliability of the bioinformatics resource used .
clearly , the success of any analysis which relies on these resources hinges on their accuracy .
further advances in the accuracy of variant prediction will have a beneficial impact on association studies which incorporate annotations as we have illustrated in this study .
moreover , filtering variants based on prediction algorithms can be undertaken for analyses conducted in non - coding regions of the genome , which would not be possible when filtering according to variant consequence .
the majority of gwas hits discovered to date fall within non - coding regions [ 37 , 38 ] , although rare variant analyses using collapsing approaches have so far been confined to coding regions of the genome .
therefore , filtering according to non - coding prediction algorithms provides a platform for future studies to investigate the role of variants in these regions , such as investigating the impact of variants in flanking regions of genes which may have an impact on regulatory variation from rna to protein .
this should be of particular interest to future studies given the amount of wgs data currently in development .
conclusion filtering low frequency and rare variants using knowledge based on molecular function and pathogenicity should help identify strong evidence of association not detected using conventional filtering approaches .
follow up analyses which evaluate these signals will be beneficial in the identification of potential mechanisms and causal variants for complex disease .
materials and methods cohort description the uk10k consortium has two main project arms .
in this study , we have used data from the cohorts' arm which was designed to investigate the contribution of genome wide genetic variation to a range of quantitative traits .
this arm contains individuals from two intensively studied cohorts of european ancestry , alspac ( avon longitudinal study of parents and children ) and twinsuk : alspac alspac is a population - based cohort study investigating genetic and environmental factors that affect the health and development of children .
the study methods are described in detail elsewhere [ 39 , 40 ] ( http :// www.bristol.ac.uk / alspac ) .
ethical approval was obtained from the national research ethics service ( nres ) committee , south east london , rec 2 .
written informed consent was obtained from parents for all measurements made .
twinsuk the twinsuk registry is a cohort of volunteer adult twins from all over the united kingdom [ 41 ] .
initially , only middle - aged women were recruited and as a result 83 % of the registry is female .
the registry currently contains 51 % monozygotic ( mz ) and 49 % dizygotic ( dz ) twins aged 18 - 103 years .
further details are available online ( http :// www.twinsuk.ac.uk /) .
informed consent was obtained from participants before they entered the study and ethical approval was granted by the national research ethics service ( nres ) committee , westminster , london .
sequencing data dna samples from 4,030 uk10k study participants ( 2,040 offspring from the alspac cohort , 1,990 from the twinsuk cohort ) were subjected to low coverage ( 6 - 8x average read depth ) whole - genome sequencing ( wgs ) .
sequencing was performed at both the wellcome trust sanger institute ( wtsi ) and the beijing genomics institute ( bgi ) .
dna ( 1 - 3mug ) was sheared to 100 - 1000 bp using a covaris e210 or le220 ( covaris , woburn , ma , usa ) .
sheared dna was size subjected to illumina paired - end dna library preparation .
following size selection ( 300 - 500 bp insert size ) , dna libraries were sequenced using the illumina hiseq platform as paired - end 100 base reads according to manufacturer 's protocol .
data that passed quality control ( qc ) was aligned to the grch37 human reference used in phase 1 of the 1000 genomes project .
reads were aligned using bwa ( v0.5.9 - r16 )[ 42 ]. of the 4,030 participants , 3,910 samples ( 1,976 alspac and 1,934 twinsuk ) went through the variant calling procedure .
low quality samples were identified by comparing the samples to their gwas genotypes using about 20,000 sites on chromosome 20 .
a total of 112 samples ( 48 alspac and 64 twinsuk ) were removed , leaving 3,798 samples ( 1,928 alspac and 1,870 twinsuk ) that were eligible for the genotype refinement phase .
missing and low - confidence genotypes in the filtered vcfs were refined out using the imputation procedure in beagle 4 [ 43 ] with default parameters .
additional sample - level qc steps were carried out on refined genotypes , resulting in 17 samples ( 16 twinsuk and 1 alspac ) being removed due to either non - reference discordance with gwas snv data > 5 % , multiple relations to other samples or failed sex check .
a principal components analysis was conducted using eigenstrat [ 44 ] to exclude participants of non - european ancestry after merging our data with a pruned 11 hapmap3 population dataset [ 45 ] .
44 subjects ( 12 twinsuk and 32 alspac ) did not cluster to the european ( ceu ) cluster and were removed .
the final sample size for association analyses comprised of 3,621 individuals ( 1,754 twinsuk and 1,867 alspac ) .
phenotype data alspac height was measured to the nearest 0.1cm using a harpenden stadiometer ( holtain crosswell , dyfed , uk ) and weight was measured to the nearest 0.1kg using tanita electronic scales .
body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated as ( weight ( kg ))/( height ( m )) 2 .
blood pressure was measured with a dinamap 9301 vital monitor completed by trained staff using the appropriate cuff size .
two readings of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( sbp & dbp respectively ) were taken when the study participants were at rest and the mean of each were used as a measurement in our analysis .
both these measurements were taken from the age 9 clinic ( mean age : 9.9 , range : 8.9 - 11.5 ) .
non - fasting blood samples were also taken from participants who attended the age 9 clinic ( mean age : 9.9 , range : 8.9 - 11.5 ) .
plasma lipid concentrations ( total cholesterol ( tc ) , triglycerides ( tg ) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hdl )) were measured by modification of the standard lipid research clinics protocol with enzymatic reagents for lipid determination [ 46 ] .
low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl ) concentration was subsequently calculated using the friedwald equation [ 47 ] : ldl = tc - ( hdlc + tgx0.45 ) twinsuk height was measured to the nearest 0.5cm using a wall - mounted stadiometer and weight ( light clothing only ) was measured to the nearest 0.1kg using digital scales .
body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated as ( weight ( kg ))/( height ( m )) 2 .
brachial blood pressure was measured using an automated cuff sphygmomanometer ( omron hem713c ; omron healthcare ( uk ) ltd , henfield , uk ) .
sbp and dbp were measured three times , two of which were highly correlated ( 0.90 for sbp and 0.92 for dbp ) and averaged to get our final phenotype measurements .
blood samples were taken after at least 6 hours of overnight fasting .
the samples were immediately inverted three times and left to rest for 40 minutes at 4degreesc to obtain complete coagulation .
the samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000g and serum was removed .
four aliquots of 1.5 ml were placed into skirted micro centrifuge tubes and then stored in a - 45degreesc freezer until sampling [ 48 ] .
a colorimetric enzymatic method was used to determine tc , tg and hdl levels .
the friedewald equation was used to calculate ldl levels in subjects .
statistical analysis we used cadd [ 9 ] to obtain scaled c scores for all 44.9 million possible variants and indels in the uk10k whole genome sequence data [ 14 ] .
after removing variants which failed qc , we filtered all variants in three ways 1 ) responsible for a ' nonsynonymous' substitution according to the variant effect predictor [ 15 ] ( vep ) 2 ) responsible for a ' loss of function ' according to vep ( i.e. ' stop losses / gains ' , ' splice sites' or ' frameshift indels ') and 3 ) variants with a cadd c - score of 15 or higher .
we collapsed variants together across candidate genes and analysed them using skat [ 8 ] with their associated traits according to liu et al [ 17 ] .
these genes were angptl4 , bcam , cblc , cd300lg , hnf4a , ldlr , lipc , lipg , lpl , pcsk9 and pvr .
analyses were repeated after applying each variant filtering method , as well as applying two different minor allele frequency cutoffs ( maf <= 5 %) and ( maf <= 1 %) .
we also identified variants with a cadd c - score >= 15 across the genome and aggregated them together across all gene regions according to ucsc definitions ( reference genome hg19 ) .
variants were then collapsed together and analysed with 7 cardiovascular traits ( bmi , sbp , dbp , tc , hdl , ldl & tg ) using skat after applying a maf cutoff of 5 % .
we repeated this process in a second set of analyses using a maf cutoff of 1 % to investigate rarer variation .
gene - based p - values from the cadd analyses were matched with p - values from the ' nonsynonymous' filtered analysis and the results were - log10 transformed and plotted using hexbin plots for each trait and maf cutoff .
this meant that only genes which had at least 2 variants within their region after filtering in both sets of analyses ( i.e. >= 2 ' nonsynonymous' & >= 2 variants with a cadd c - score >= 15 ) were plotted on these graphs .
this was undertaken using the ' hexbin ' package in r [ 18 ] this process was repeated except matching on results from the ' loss - of - function ' analysis .
as this resulted in far fewer data points to be plotted , scatter plots were generated instead using using the r package ' ggplot2 ' [ 49 ] .
all plots were also regenerated using the results of an identical analysis except using the skat - o [ 19 ] and mist tests [ 20 ] .
this approach was repeated except using two alternative bioinformatics tools to cadd which can also predict the effect of variants in both coding and non - coding regions of the genome ( fathmm - mkl [ 21 ] and dann [ 22 ]) .
r statistical software [ 50 ] was used for all statistical analyses and plots .

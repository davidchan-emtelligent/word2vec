however , the currently available fabrication techniques are not feasible for creating complex and sufficiently small metallic shapes for metamaterials functioning at the visible wavelength range .
the common wet chemical methods merely yield geometrically limited structures , whereas the standard lithography that allows arbitrary shapes does not provide the required spatial accuracy .
meanwhile , programmable self - assembly of nucleic acids enables the fabrication of custom , precise objects with nanoscale dimensions ( 3 , 4 ) .
these structures can be further harnessed as templates for building novel materials and nanodevices with diverse functionalities ( 5 - 10 ) .
however , approaches to transfer their spatial information to metal nanostructures have been limited to direct patterning with nanoparticles ( 7 , 8 , 11 - 13 ) or chemical growth of attached seed particles ( 14 - 18 ) .
here , we present a parallel , high - throughput dna - assisted lithography ( dali ) method that genuinely combines the high resolution and structural versatility of dna origami ( 19 - 24 ) with the robustness of the conventional lithography to create discrete , well - defined , and entirely metallic nanostructures with designed plasmonic properties .
dali is a parallel , high - throughput fabrication method compatible with transparent substrates .
the technique facilitates the production of large plasmonic metasurfaces with small (~ 10 nm ) feature sizes , and at present , it is the only viable method for this purpose because of its freedom from costly optical or electron - beam patterning .
we demonstrate its feasibility by producing metal nanostructures with chiral plasmonic response and bowtie - shaped nanoantennas for surface - enhanced raman spectroscopy ( sers ) .
overall , dali provides a straightforward approach to overcome the abovementioned prominent obstacles and opens up completely new avenues in nanofabrication .
results we prepared four different dna origami designs : the so - called seeman tile ( st ) ( 25 ) , a bowtie origami ( bo ) , and two versions of a chiral double - l ( cdl ) , that is , cdl with and without protruding staple strand extensions to control its landing orientation on a silicon substrate ( fig. 1a , top ) .
the origami structures were folded in a thermal annealing process with high yield , and the structural integrity of each design was verified by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) ( fig. 1a , middle ) and agarose gel electrophoresis ( see fig. s1 ) .
to demonstrate the versatility of dali ( fig. 1b ) , we converted the abovementioned dna designs to discrete one - to - one metallic shapes ( fig. 1a , bottom ) and characterized their plasmonic properties in detail. fig. 1 dna origami designs , a step - by - step fabrication procedure of the dali method .
( a ) top : designed dna origami shapes ( from left to right ) : st , bo , and cdl .
middle : afm images of the folded structures on a mica substrate .
bottom : scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) images of gold nanostructures created by the fabrication method described in detail in ( b ) .
the afm and sem images are 150 nm x 150 nm in size .
( b ) steps of the fabrication procedure .
step 1 : a transparent sapphire ( al2o3 )/ silicon nitride ( si3n4 ) chip is freshly cleaned by acetone and isopropanol .
step 2 : an amorphous silicon layer is grown on top of the substrate by pecvd .
step 3 : the substrate is treated by oxygen plasma , after which the dna origami nanostructures ( bo shown here as an example ) are drop - casted on the chip .
step 4 : the silicon dioxide ( sio2 ) layer is selectively grown on the bare silicon by cvd , leaving dna origami - shaped silhouettes in the layer .
step 5 : using the grown sio2 layer as a mask , the silicon underneath is etched away by rie .
step 6 : the metal is deposited onto the chip using pvd in ultrahigh vacuum .
step 7 : the sio2 layer is removed in a liftoff process using hydrogen fluoride - based wet etching .
step 8 : the remaining silicon is removed by rie , thus leaving the dna origami - shaped metal nanostructure on the substrate .
the folded origami structures were deposited without any purification onto an oxygen plasma - cleaned substrate consisting of a transparent bottom layer [ sapphire ( al2o3 ) or silicon nitride ( si3n4 )] and a top layer of amorphous silicon , grown by plasma - enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( pecvd ) ( fig. 1b , steps 1 to 3 ) .
after the deposition , a silicon dioxide ( sio2 ) layer was formed on top of the silicon in a selective cvd process ( fig. 1b , step 4 ) ( 26 , 27 ) .
the oxide primarily grows on the bare areas of the silicon and only slightly on top of the deposited dna origami .
the thin oxide layer on top of the origami can be easily removed by short reactive ion etching ( rie ) .
therefore , the formed oxide layer can be further used as a stencil for the following process steps .
the rest of the procedure starts with isotropic rie etching of the silicon underneath the oxide film through the origami - shaped holes ( fig. 1b , step 5 ) .
this step is followed by a physical vapor deposition ( pvd ) of a gold film under ultrahigh vacuum conditions ( fig. 1b , step 6 ) .
finally , the silicon dioxide stencil and the remaining silicon are etched away ( fig. 1b , steps 7 and 8 ) , which results in discrete origami - shaped metal nanostructures on the transparent substrate ( fig. 2 ) .
the produced metal structures are uniform in size and shape , and the density of the structures can be easily tuned by varying the parameters of the deposition step ( step 3 ) .
most of all , the parallel fabrication provides high throughput and resolution with a feature size of ~ 10 nm ; the width of the arms for sts and cdls is ~ 20 nm , and the gap size for the bos can be less than 10 nm ( figs. 1a and 2b ) .
the detailed fabrication procedure is presented in note s1. fig. 2 large - area sem images of the structures created with dali .

all the inset images are 150 nm x 150 nm in size .
besides its capability of fabricating nanostructures with specific shapes ( as st and cdl ) and with relatively high yields ( see the " fabrication yield analysis " section in the appendix of the supplementary materials ) , dali can also be used to produce particle pairs that are separated by adjustable nanoscale gaps .
an example of this structure is a bowtie - shaped optical antenna , the shape that has been widely harnessed in different optical applications .
this is due to its characteristic highly confined plasmonic mode within the gap that provides an extreme field enhancement .
for applications such as surface - enhanced sensing ( 28 ) and fluorescence enhancement ( 29 ) , it is essential to tune the wavelength of the maximum enhancement , which substantially depends on the selected material , size , and exact shape of the structure , in particular on the sharpness of the tips and the size of the gap .
to obtain the maximum enhancement within the visible wavelength range , the size of the gap between the antennas needs to be below 10 nm on a glass substrate ( 29 , 30 ) .
to date , this resolution has only been achieved by focused beam lithography ( electron or ion beam ) .
this is an expensive scanning technique , which makes it unsuitable for large - scale production .
to demonstrate that our dali method provides the necessary accuracy to produce efficient optical bowtie antennas , we used the designed bo shape ( fig. 1a ) as a template .
the gap between the two triangles can be formed because the thin silicon oxide layer grown on top of the origami ( fabrication step 4 ) appears to be thicker at the narrow part of the bo than at the triangles .
the reason is that the silicon oxide grows slowly on top of the bo starting from the edges of the already formed oxide layer , and these edges can merge at the thin bridge between the two triangles , resulting in a nonuniform thickness profile of the oxide .
using careful etching techniques in step 5 , we obtain a stencil mask with two individual triangles separated by a nanometer - scale gap. by merely controlling the processing times in fabrication steps 4 and 5 , the gap size and therefore the resulting plasmonic resonance can be tuned ( see note s2 ) .
this feature enabled us to fabricate the smallest , entirely metallic bowtie antenna that has ever been reported (~ 125 nm in the long axis including two sub - 60 - nm triangles and a gap ranging from 5 to 20 nm ) , verified by detailed characterization of the optical / plasmonic properties of the produced structures ( see below ) .
in addition , to show the uniformity of dali - fabricated structures , we analyzed numerous bowtie antennas from one fabrication batch and determined the average gap size , thickness , and bending angle , that is , angle between the triangles .
we obtained 12 +/ - 5 nm ( sd ) for the gap size , 21.6 +/ - 0.2 nm ( sd ) with ~ 2 - nm mean roughness for the thickness , and 179 +/ - 12degrees ( sd ) for the bending angle ( note s1 ) .
for plasmonic characterization , we measured the scattering spectra at different polarization angles from single metallic nanoantennas ( note s3 ) using a dark - field microscope coupled to a spectrometer via an optical fiber ( details in note s4 ) .
this allowed us to separately determine the localized surface plasmon resonances ( lsprs ) of the structure both along and perpendicular to the gap .
as a control and as a comparison , we also characterized the metallic st shapes .
for the bo shapes , we observed the highest lspr peaks at the polarizations along the gap ( lambdamax at 704 nm ) and perpendicular to the gap ( lambdamax at 650 to 700 nm ) , as shown in fig. 3a ( additional spectra from different samples shown in note s5 ) .
the lspr peak associated with the gap mode has higher intensity and longer wavelength than the perpendicular mode , which is in good agreement with the earlier reports ( 28 - 30 ) and with the finite element method ( fem ) simulated data shown in fig. 3a .
the simulated spatial distributions of the field enhancement for these two main modes are plotted in the insets of fig. 3a .
because our structure is smaller than the previously reported bowties , the observed lspr peaks accordingly appear at shorter wavelengths ( despite the fact that the sapphire substrate has a higher refractive index than indium tin oxide / glass substrates used in the earlier studies ) ( 29 , 30 ). fig. 3 experimental and simulated linear polarization scattering spectra for single bo - and st - shaped gold nanostructures .
( a and b ) dark - field scattering spectra of the bo and st shapes ( sem images shown in the left insets , 200 nm x 200 nm in size ) measured at two different polarization angles ( indicated by correspondingly colored arrows in the insets ) .
lines show the smoothed spectra , whereas the original data are shown faded in the background .
dashed lines show simulated scattering spectra for the bo and st shapes in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .
the right - side insets show a field enhancement , that is , the local electric field ( e ) divided by the incoming electric field ( e0 ) at the chosen polarization angles ( shown by colored arrows ) at the middle height of the structure , that is , 10 nm above the surface .
the main lspr modes are at 650 and 705 nm for the bo and at 670 and 700 nm for the slightly asymmetric st. the maximum local field enhancement , emax / e0 , for each sample is also stated in each inset .
a.u. , arbitrary units .
to estimate the lspr variations within a single fabrication batch , we simulated the structures with geometries differing from the optimal shape by the amount of the observed sd ( see above ) .
the bending angle change within the sd had no noticeable effect on the lspr peak position or the field enhancement .
however , an increase in the thickness ( by mean roughness ) or in the gap size ( by sd ) yielded 8.5 - or 12.5 - nm blue shifts in the gap mode resonance , respectively .
moreover , these changes induced 12 and 30 % decreases in the field enhancement .
only the thickness variation had an effect on the perpendicular mode , inducing a 6.5 - nm blue shift with a negligible decrease in the field enhancement .
in summary , the changes in plasmonic properties due to the observed variations in the fabrication process were insignificant , thus revealing the homogeneity of the dali process ( for more details , see fig. s15 ) .
in the case of metallic st shapes , we typically observed the highest lspr peaks at polarizations along the arms of the cross ( fig. 3b ) .
for a fully symmetric st , these peaks should overlap , but due to an unavoidable slight asymmetry between the two arms , the peaks usually appeared at slightly different wavelengths .
this is in qualitative agreement with the simulated data shown in fig. 3b .
the lspr resonances for the bo and st structures lay within the same wavelength region , but the key difference is the obtained maximum field enhancement .
as can be seen from the simulation results in the insets of fig. 3 ( a and b ) , the excitation of the bo gap mode should yield a maximum field enhancement almost four times as high as that of the other modes , which all have very similar responses .
the abovementioned lspr measurement can be used to verify the desired plasmonic activity of the fabricated nanostructures .
yet , for more application - oriented purposes and to verify the effective plasmonic hotspots , we demonstrated the feasibility of the bo antennas for sers by using two typical sers markers with opposite charges ( namely , rhodamine 6g and 2,2 - bipyridine ) .
the samples were fabricated by pipetting a droplet of the chosen 1 mum marker solution onto a sapphire chip so that the droplet covered both the prefabricated metallic bos and the clean sapphire surface ( clean surface was used as a reference ) .
after drying the droplet , we characterized the chip using raman microscopy .
the characteristic raman spectra of both markers were detected with significantly high resolution ( fig. 4a ) on the areas covered by the bo antennas ( fig. 4a , inset ) , whereas no raman signal was observed from the empty areas of the chip ( fig. 4a , dotted lines ). fig. 4 metallic bo shapes for sers and cdl shapes for creating chiral plasmonic response .

insets show the field enhancement ( color scale ) and power loss inside the metal ( grayscale ) for the symmetric cdl and for the right - handed ( upper ) and left - handed ( lower ) circularly polarized 640 - nm excitation light .
as a final demonstration of the versatility of the dali method , we fabricated planar chiral structures , which are of fundamental importance in metamaterials and in biosensing applications , especially in enhancing the detection of different molecular enantiomers .
in particular , the miniaturization of these structures to the sub - 100 - nm scale is essential to fabricate metamaterials that function in the visible spectrum .
to produce a controlled chiral optical response within this wavelength range , we designed a cdl - shaped origami with suitable dimensions .
however , to produce a sample with the desired response , most of the cdl origamis should have a specified orientation after the deposition , that is , cdls should land on the o2 plasma - treated si substrate in either s - or z - shaped orientation .
we observed that when 37.5 mm mg2 + was used in the deposition buffer , ~ 80 % of the plain cdl origamis tend to adsorb onto the si surface with the s - shaped orientation .
however , at 70 mm or higher mg2 + concentration , the deposition yielded equal amounts of s - and z - shaped orientations .
besides merely adjusting the mg2 + concentration , it is possible to efficiently alter the distribution of s - and z - shaped orientations by incorporating dozens of protruding staple strand extensions into the design .
the reason is that if these single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) protrusions are attached only to the one side of the origami , then the strands act as an entropic brush , and therefore , the structures prefer to land with the staple strand extension side up. here , by introducing a total of 114 poly - t20 overhangs into the design , the bias toward the s - shaped orientation could be increased up to 99 % ( see the " fabrication yield analysis " section in the appendix of the supplementary materials ). by converting the cdl origami into metallic nanostructures , we could produce planar chiral samples with diverse cd responses ( fig. 4d ) depending on the deposition process .
a sample with randomly oriented cdls ( equal amount of s - and z - shaped orientations , unmodified cdl ) ( fig. 4b ) and a sample with s - shaped orientation - biased cdls (" swimmer strand " - equipped cdl ) ( fig. 4c ) exhibited very different broadband cd effects in the wavelength range of 500 to 1050 nm. the sapphire chip with only s - shaped gold nanostructures showed a well - defined peak at 650 nm and a wide negative peak at 950 nm , which qualitatively agrees with the fem simulations ( black lines in fig. 4d ) .
the simulated power loss inside the metal shows a clear difference between the two opposite circularly polarized excitations ( fig. 4d , insets ) , whereas the effect in the local field enhancement is small , which is also clear from the matching absorption spectra between the s - and z - shaped orientations ( note s6 ) .
this confirms that the observed cd response is due to the chiral shape of the metal structures .
the broadness of the negative peak at 950 nm compared to the simulations can be attributed to a variation of the length in the end pieces of the fabricated metallic cdls , which is also visible in fig. 4 ( b and c ) .
the two simulations show a cd response of a fully symmetric cdl structure along the origami dimensions ( dashed line ) and a similar asymmetric structure with the end pieces asymmetrically shortened ( dash - dotted line ) .
this shows that the peak at 640 nm is almost unaffected , whereas the negative peak shifts considerably , thus providing a wide feature when averaged over the distribution of symmetric and asymmetric cdls .
the cd spectrum of the randomly oriented sample showed only insignificant broad spectral features , which demonstrate the lack of preferred surface orientation .
it is noteworthy that despite a very small optical density of the setup ( perpendicular incident light passing through a monolayer of 20 - nm - thick cdls ) , the cd effect was clearly observed .
this strongly implies that the sensitivity could be further improved , thus opening up potential applications in chiral molecule sensing .
discussion the dali method enables highly parallel fabrication of arbitrary - shaped plasmonic nanostructures with well - defined shapes using self - assembled dna origami templates .
because dna origami designs are straightforward to produce in high yields and , in dali , do not require any additional treatment or purification steps , the method is robust and provides high throughput .
we demonstrated this by fabricating three different metallic nanoshapes on transparent substrates , including bowtie nanoantennas with controllable plasmonic resonances at the visible range ( the minimum bowtie gap that was characterized was 8 nm ) and planar cdl structures that provide a clear cd response .
as a final note , we believe that the cheap wafer - scale production of plasmonic metasurfaces can be achieved using the dali method because it does not rely on costly patterning methods and is compatible with various deposition techniques ( 10 , 31 , 32 ) for large lattice structures spatially ordered in both position and orientation .
furthermore , we are positive that this novel method can find intriguing applications in biosensing and in the fabrication of bioinspired surfaces and dielectric metamaterials ( 33 ) .
materials and methods design of dna structures the bo and cdl were designed using cadnano ( 34 ) and cando ( 35 , 36 ) software .
st was fabricated as explained by liu et al .
( 25 ) .
all the structures are based on the 7249 - nucleotide - long m13mp18 plasmid scaffold strand .
the bo structure is twist - corrected , that is , the twist resulting from the square lattice packing ( 35 - 37 ) is relaxed by additional base skips in the design ( 35 , 36 , 38 ) according to a cando simulation .
side strands in the bo and cdl designs contain tttttttt ( poly - t8 ) overhangs to prevent the blunt - end stacking of the origami structures .
in the case of st , the side strands were omitted ( 25 ) .
two different versions of the cdl were fabricated : a plain unmodified version and a version with the staple strand extensions at one side .
these extensions were used to bias the landing orientation of the cdl structure ( fig. 4 , b and c ) .
the folding and characterization procedures for all the origami shapes are described below .
the cadnano designs for the bo and cdl and the complete list of staple strands are presented in the appendix of the supplementary materials .
the staple extensions ( 114 strands ) of the cdl replace one to one the strands from the set of " core strands pool # 1 " ( green color in the cadnano design , see the appendix in the supplementary materials ) .
these strands hybridize to the scaffold via the same sequence as core strands pool # 1 , but the extended strands contain poly - t20 overhangs at the 5 ' - end .
the protrusions are designed in such a way that the cdl will adopt an s - shaped orientation when deposited onto the substrate , that is , all the poly - t extensions are pointing out from the substrate and the unmodified side of the cdl is attached to the substrate .
dna origami fabrication the dna origami structures were prepared as 100 - mul quantities by mixing the following components : ( i ) 40 mul of 2.5x tae buffer with mg2 + [ 100 mm tris , 47.5 mm acetic acid , 2.5 mm edta , 31.25 mm mgcl2 ( ph ~ 8.3 )] ; ( ii ) 40 mul of staple strand mix ( each staple at ~ 500 nm concentration ) [ the staple strand mix was prepared by pipetting equal amounts of each staple strand ( integrated dna technologies , initial concentration of 100 mum in water , ~ 200 strands per design ) and mixing them together .
this resulted in about 500 nm concentration for each strand in the staple strand mix .
if the origami contains less than 200 strands ( as in st : 177 strands ) , then 500 nm concentration was achieved by dilution with water ] ; and ( iii ) 20 mul of the scaffold strand m13mp18 ( 100 nm in water ) ( tilibit nanosystems ) .
the final concentration of the scaffold strand in a total reaction volume of 100 mul was 20 nm , and the concentration of magnesium was 12.5 mm. the staple strands were used in 10x excess compared to the m13mp18 scaffold strand ( each staple at 200 nm concentration ) .
the following thermal annealing ramp was used for folding : from 90degrees to 70degreesc with increments of 0.2degreesc / 8 s , from 70degrees to 60degreesc with increments of 0.1degreesc / 8 s , and from 60degrees to 27degreesc with increments of 0.1degreesc / 2 min .
finally , the solution was stored at 12degreesc .
after folding , the theoretical maximum concentration of dna origami is 20 nm. gel electrophoresis for dna origami gel electrophoresis was used to verify the quality of the dna origami folding ( see fig. s1 ) .
agarose gels ( 2 %) were prepared by dissolving 2 g of agarose ( bioline , molecular grade ) into 100 ml of 1x tae buffer with 11 mm mg2 + ( 40 mm tris , 19 mm acetic acid , 1 mm edta , 11 mm mgcl2 ) .
the gel was stained using 100 mul of ethidium bromide solution ( 0.625 mg / ml ) .
ten microliters of dna origami solution were mixed with 2 mul of 6x loading dye ( new england biolabs ) .
m13mp18 ssdna ( at 100 nm ) was used as a reference at 40 nm concentration by diluting it with the folding buffer ( 1x tae buffer with 12.5 mm mg2 +) .
the gel wells were loaded with 10 mul of the sample .
the gels were run with a constant voltage of 90 v for 45 to 60 min and imaged under ultraviolet ( uv ) light ( bio - rad equipment , image lab software ) .
atomic force microscopy the afm ( veeco , dimension 3100 ) was used to characterize the sample after the dna origami deposition and to verify the successful formation of the origami - shaped opening in the sio2 .
the afm imaging of these openings was usually carried out in tapping mode with a scan size varying from 1 to 10 mum .
the tip velocity ranged from 2 to 15 mum / s. for the analysis of the uniformity of the dali - fabricated metallic nanostructure , numerous bowtie antennas from a single batch were characterized using the peak force tapping mode in air ( bruker , icon ) , where the scan size was from 1 to 5 mum and the tip velocity was from 1.5 to 10 mum / s. scanning electron microscopy sapphire is an insulator , and thus , imaging with a scanning electron microscope ( raith eline scanning electron microscopy system ) induces charging of the substrate .
to reduce the distortion caused by the charging effect , low acceleration voltages ( 5 to 10 kv ) were used .
in addition , the scanning times were minimized to reduce the current exposed to a small area .
the images were taken with a 30 - mum aperture in a continuous averaging mode .
brightness and contrast levels were adjusted to compensate for the charging effect .
dna - assisted lithography see note s1 for details about general lithography materials and methods .
details about sample preparation for single - particle lspr measurement can be found in note s3 .
single - particle linear polarization lspr measurement to measure the single - particle spectra , an olympus bx51trf microscope with olympus mplanfl n objectives ( 5x / 20x / 50x ) was used for imaging .
the excitation light was generated using a halogen lamp ( olympus 100 w ) inside a lamp housing ( olympus u - lh100ir - 1 - 7 ) .
dark - field imaging was carried out using a dark - field condenser ( olympus u - dcw ) .
an analyzer ( olympus u - an360 - 3 ) was used to select the polarization of the measured light , and a linear polarizer ( thorlabs lpvise200 - a 2 ") was used to align the analyzer .
a custom - made slit mask was used to align the polarizer and the marker grid of the sample .
the light was extracted by placing a fiber ( thorlabs um22 - 300 - custom ; core size , 300 mum ) onto the output port of the microscope and by focusing the tip of the fiber to the image plane of the port .
the other end of the fiber was connected to a collimator ( thorlabs ) that was , in turn , connected to a custom - made switch box ( thorlabs ) .
the measured light was focused to the slit of the spectrograph [ princeton instruments sp2150 ( acton )] equipped with a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera ( andor ivac dr - 324b - fi ) to record the spectra .
the dark - field images were recorded using a canon eo5 6d camera connected to the other microscope port .
the whole setup was located inside an electromagnetically shielded room , and the spectrograph and the ccd camera were connected to a computer using a black box ic404a fiber extender .
a thorlabs m530l3 - mounted light - emitting diode connected to the switch box was used to visualize the position of the fiber spot on the sample , whereas a xyz - micrometer translational stage was used to move the fiber in the microscope view and to focus the fiber spot ( fig. s10a ) .
andor solis ( version 4.18 ) was used to measure the spectra , and canon eos utility was used to take the dark - field images remotely .
the single - particle spectroscopy ( sps ) microscope setup is schematically illustrated in fig. s10c ( see note s4 for details ) .
cd measurement of cdl samples the cd measurements of the cdls on a sapphire substrate were carried out using a jasco j - 715 cd spectrometer .
the sample surface was placed perpendicularly to the incident beam .
for all the samples measured , the illumination direction was from the back side ( sapphire side ) to the particle side .
a measurement with a reverse direction would yield the same result due to the symmetry .
in addition , a square aperture of 4 mm x 4 mm was used in direct contact to the back side of the sample to reduce the diffraction of the sample edges .
surface - enhanced raman spectroscopy the sers measurements were carried out using a senterra dispersive raman microscope ( bruker ) .
confocal raman spectroscopy was used to acquire sers of the molecule - bo samples .
raman scattering was detected using a peltier - cooled ( - 70degreesc ) ccd camera ( 255 x 1024 pixels ) , focusing only within the fingerprint regions ( 500 to 1800 cm - 1 ) .
detection was carried out using 180degrees geometry and a near - infrared diode laser ( 785 nm ) for the excitation .
the spectrometer was equipped with a diffraction grating ( 1200 grooves / mm ) , and the slit provided a spectral resolution of 2 cm - 1 .
the laser power at the sample ranged from 1 to 10 mw , and the acquisition time ranged from 1 to 5 s. the area of the laser spot on the samples was approximately 1 mum in diameter .
the molecular markers with 1 mum concentration in ethanol were drop - casted on the bo sample surface before the measurement .
the setup was calibrated using built - in templates and internal raman standards .

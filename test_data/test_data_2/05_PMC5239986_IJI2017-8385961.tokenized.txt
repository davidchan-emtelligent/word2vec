sterile neuroinflammation is essential for the proper brain development and tissue repair .
however , uncontrolled neuroinflammation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of various disease processes .
the endogenous intracellular molecules so called damage - associated molecular patterns or alarmins or damage signals that are released by activated or necrotic cells are thought to play a crucial role in initiating an immune response .
sterile inflammatory response that occurs in alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) , parkinson 's disease ( pd ) , stroke , hemorrhage , epilepsy , or traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) creates a vicious cycle of unrestrained inflammation , driving progressive neurodegeneration .
neuroinflammation is a key mechanism in the progression ( e.g. , ad and pd ) or secondary injury development ( e.g. , stroke , hemorrhage , stress , and tbi ) of multiple brain conditions .
hence , it provides an opportunity for the therapeutic intervention to prevent progressive tissue damage and loss of function .
the key for developing anti - neuroinflammatory treatment is to minimize the detrimental and neurotoxic effects of inflammation while promoting the beneficial and neurotropic effects , thereby creating ideal conditions for regeneration and repair .
this review outlines how inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of major nonpathogenic neuroinflammatory conditions and discusses the complex response of glial cells to damage signals .
in addition , emerging experimental anti - neuroinflammatory drug treatment strategies are discussed .

background inflammation is a response of the innate immune system that is triggered by infection or injury .
it aims to protect and defend the body by clearing and controlling the initial stimulus , through the release of cells and mediators that combat foreign substances and thereby help to prevent infection [ 1 ] .
even though inflammation is intended to be protective and beneficial , an excessive inflammatory response can cause further tissue damage .
once activated , primed inflammatory cells may target remote sites , indicating detrimental effects of long - term inflammation [ 2 ] .
for decades , brain has been considered as an immune privileged site due to the presence of highly restrictive blood - brain barrier ( bbb ) .
however , " neuroinflammation ," inflammation of the central nervous system ( cns ) , does occur .
neuroinflammation is evident in various cns disorders including alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) , parkinson 's disease ( pd ) , huntington 's disease ( hd ) , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) , stroke , epilepsy , and traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) .
the inflammatory triggers in these conditions are the endogenous damage - associated molecular patterns ( damps ) in the absence of infection .
the focus of this review is to understand sterile or non - pathogen - associated neuroinflammation and its players in multiple cns disorders .
the evidences gathered here suggest that neuroinflammation causes and accelerates neurodegeneration and vice versa .
further , there are common players and pathways of neuroinflammation in these inflammatory brain diseases .
here we aim to identify and discuss on the anti - neuroinflammatory drug target strategies that may specifically target damps - induced inflammation in brain but not globally suppress the immune system .
2. neuroinflammation neuroinflammation describes the broad range of immune responses of the cns , which could be initiated in the periphery or within the brain .
the proinflammatory mediators derived from the peripheral inflammation can release and transmit these mediators and permit migration of leucocytes into the brain ( figure 1 ) [ 2 , 3 ] .
the entry of peripheral leukocytes by bbb damage ( bbbd ) creates a scenario similar to that seen in peripheral inflammatory response .
in addition , exacerbation of brain damage causes neuronal injury , triggering neuroinflammatory responses [ 2 , 4 ] .
thus , even in the absence of peripheral infiltration of immune cells , nervous system undergoes constant immune surveillance by the resident brain cells , primarily microglia and astrocytes [ 2 ] .
brain cells express specialized pattern - recognition receptors ( prrs ) that garnered increasing attention , as they are capable of triggering inflammatory pathways .
these prrs can sense microbial molecules , termed pathogen - associated molecular patters ( pamps ) , or host - derived endogenous molecules , so - called danger / damage - associated molecular patterns ( damps ) .
pamps are foreign molecules typically accumulated in the infected tissues , whereas damps are misfolded proteins , aggregated peptides , or mislocalized nucleic acids found in diseased brain ( figure 2 ) .
in the normal situation , neuroinflammation is a cellular and molecular response that aims to clear pathogens and dead / damaged cells generated by infection or injury and assist in returning the compromised area back to normal state .
hence , neuroinflammation is beneficial as it may sounds but has also been implicated in many cns diseases .
the persistent release of proinflammatory mediators diverts immune competent cells from the beneficial " housekeeping " functions to the detrimental " neurodegenerative " conditions [ 5 , 6 ] .
acute neuroinflammation refers to the inflammatory reactions occur immediately after cns injury , in which bbb is generally intact .
in the absence of bbb breakdown after brain injury , its own immune system , largely composed of glial cells , are the subtle responders .
the neuronal insults trigger glial activation without breaking bbb and concomitant infiltration of leukocytes .
in the context of understanding cns diseases , the concept of chronic inflammation is very relevant , as the term " disease " implies " chronicity. " the persistent neuroinflammation can be triggered by the infection of non - self - substances ( e.g. , pathogens and toxins ) or endogenous molecules .
infections are classically accepted as inflammatory in nature , with meningeal , perivascular , or parenchymal infiltration of peripheral leukocytes [ 7 ] .
however , there are some conditions that develop extreme neuroinflammation in the absence of notable peripheral infiltration including rabies , human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) infection , and prions disease .
studies suggest that hiv and prion infections alter microglial physiology , which is likely to initiate neurodegeneration that could contribute to the development of dementia occurring in these conditions [ 7 ] .
inflammation of cns in the absence of pathogens and toxins has been termed sterile neuroinflammation ( figures 1 - 4 ) .
some of the principal neuroinflammatory disorders are discussed below .
2.1 .
traumatic brain injury within minutes of a traumatic effect , a robust inflammatory response is initiated in the injured brain .
this posttraumatic squeal involves the activation of resident glial cells ( microglia and astrocytes ) and the infiltration of blood leukocytes .
in addition , cytokines ( e.g. , il - 1 , tnf , and il - 6 ) and chemokines ( mcp - 1 , mip - 1 , and rantes ) drive the accumulation of parenchymal and peripheral immune cells in the injured brain regions [ 8 ] .
the humoral immune response is particularly seen in the acute phase following tbi , whereas the activation of glial cells appears to be sustained for several months [ 8 ] .
in animal models of focal and diffuse tbi , il - 1beta increased from the very low basal levels to detectable levels as early as 1 hr after trauma [ 9 , 10 ] .
il - 1beta is hardly detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) or serum of healthy individuals ; thus , it is hard to measure following human tbi [ 11 ] .
however , a study of postmortem tissue from tbi patients has confirmed the global elevation of il - 1beta within a few minutes to hours after injury [ 12 ] .
2.2 .
epilepsy experimental and clinical findings support an important role of inflammation in the mechanisms underlying the generation of seizures [ 13 ] .
rodent studies demonstrate that seizures induce high levels of inflammatory mediators in brain regions that are involved in the generation and propagation of epileptic activities [ 14 - 17 ] .
proinflammatory cytokines ( e.g. , il - 6 , il - 1beta , and tnf - alpha ) are upregulated in activated astrocytes and microglia that trigger a cascade of inflammatory events , involving neurons and vascular endothelial cells .
more specifically , inflammatory cytokines activate multiple pathways such as nf - kappab , cyclooxygenase - 2 ( cox - 2 ) , complement system , chemokines , and acute phase proteins [ 17 - 19 ] .
the rapid release of damps from neurons , astrocytes , and microglia following proconvulsant injuries and activation of toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) in astrocytes and neurons is considered as a crucial event for initiating brain inflammation [ 20 , 21 ] .
in seizure models , brain inflammation is thought to be elevated by bbb breakdown via the disruption of tight - junction organization [ 22 - 24 ] .
in human epilepsy , activation of both innate and adaptive immune systems has been described clearly .
the analysis of epileptogenic tissue showed upregulation of high - mobility group box 1 protein ( hmgb1 ) and il - 1beta and their receptors , tlr4 , receptor for advanced glycation end products ( rage ) , and il - 1r , in glial cells and neurons [ 20 , 25 - 29 ] .
2.3 .
stroke hypoxia and energy deficiency cause instantaneous cellular injury or death .
the activation of microglia was seen in the penumbra after the first hour to days of ischemic event [ 30 , 31 ] .
large number of reports and evidences directly link inflammatory reactions with the degree of stroke - associated brain damage and infarct growth .
in addition , inflammation mediators , infarct size , and brain edema were markedly reduced by anti - inflammatory treatments [ 30 , 32 ] .
the activation of innate immune responses has key role in the generation of proinflammatory molecules .
the release of damps such as hmgb1 by neurons ( passive ) and astrocytes ( active transport ) was detected as early as 6 hr after onset until day 21 after stroke [ 33 ] .
further , other damps such as heat shock proteins ( hsps ) and adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) are thought to be released from dying cerebral tissue after stroke that are sensed by putative receptors ( e.g. , tlr2 , tlr4 , and rage ) to signal mitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapks ) and nuclear factor - kappa b ( nf - kappab ) resulting the stimulation of inflammatory cascades , leading to the expression of tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , icam - 1 , vcam - 1 , e - selection , and inos [ 30 ] .
2.4 .
psychological stress innate immune responses are now thought to be a major etiology of numerous psychiatric disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) , depression , and bipolar disorder [ 34 , 35 ] .
the experience of life stressors is a predisposing factor in the development of psychological disorders , which seems entirely unrelated to neuroinflammation .
however , clinical reports indicate that stress predisposes individuals to inflammatory disorders ( e.g. , cardiovascular disease [ 36 ]) , having high comorbidity with psychiatric conditions ( e.g. , depression ) [ 37 ] .
acute exposure to stressor induces a rapid increase of proinflammatory cytokines in stress - reactive areas of the brain such as hypothalamus and hippocampus [ 38 ] .
at least in part , the rapid increase of il - 1beta expression in glial cells is due to the release of norepinephrine in response to stressful events [ 39 ] .
more recent evidence implicated that hmgb1 is a stress signal to prime microglia for the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the brain .
blocking of tlr2 and tlr4 prevented neuroinflammatory responses during stress exposure which further supported the notion of neuroinflammation during psychological stress [ 40 ] .
2.5 .
alzheimer 's disease in ad , microglia and astrocytes were reported to localize to amyloid plaques .
hence , neuroinflammation has been implicated in the pathology of ad [ 41 - 44 ] .
even though it is clear that not all microglial activation is deleterious to neurons , it is widely accepted that chronic activation of a microglial phenotype plays major role in the pathophysiology of ad [ 43 ] .
microglia and astrocytes in and around abeta plaques release proinflammatory factors and proteases , suggesting innate immune response is a major contributor to plaque - induced toxicity [ 45 ] .
per se , tlr4 and rage have been suggested as a major mediator of ad [ 46 ] .
2.6 .
parkinson 's disease the pathological hallmark of pd is the presence of alpha - synuclein - positive inclusions in the cell body ( lewy bodies ) and processes ( lewy neurites ) of specific neurons of the brain stem .
in addition , a classic motor phenotype resulting from substantial loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta ( snpc ) is evident in pd ( review [ 47 ]) .
the presence of inflammatory mediators such as tnf , il - 1beta , il - 6 , and ifngamma in the cerebrospinal fluid and postmortem snpc of pd patient confirmed the association between neuroinflammation and pd [ 43 , 48 , 49 ] .
2.7 .
huntington 's disease huntington 's disease ( hd ) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with mutations in the huntingtin gene ( htt ) [ 50 ] .
during hd and hd - like pathology , inflammation occurs in the cns , increasing gliosis and expression of inflammation - related genes , including gfap and complement proteins [ 51 ] .
expression of mutant " htt " in microglia itself is enough to increase the expression of proinflammatory genes such as tnf - alpha and il - 6 [ 52 ] .
the proinflammatory signals are thought to stimulate microglia further in inducing neuronal death , and this , in turn , could lead to the activation of chronic " feed - forward loop " as shown in figure 3 [ 53 ] .
2.8 .
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als is associated with a progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the cns .
most als cases are sporadic in origin ; however , 5 - 10 % cases are caused by an autosomal dominant mutation .
it is generally fatal within 5 yr of diagnosis due to a progressive generalized paralysis , weakening respiratory muscles , and causing respiratory failure .
in als patients and mouse models of als , areas with degenerating motor neurons are marked by the presence of abundant cytokines ( e.g. , tnf , mcp - 1 , tgf - beta , and ifn - gamma ) and inflammatory cells ( e.g. , t cells , activated microglia , and astrocytes ) [ 54 - 56 ] .
3. components of neuroinflammation brain injury and neurodegeneration are characterized by the increase in amount of proinflammatory cytokines and numbers of activated microglia [ 57 ] .
since inflammation is a key pathological change observed in these conditions [ 58 ] , it is a valuable therapeutic target in the treatment of brain injuries and neurodegeneration .
microglia and astrocytes are highly specialized to detect and respond neuronal health and activity .
however , endothelial cells also respond and release a large number of inflammatory mediators ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
the innate immune system triggers inflammatory and regulatory responses via prrs , complement system , cytokines , and chemokines in order to counteract brain injury and maintenance of tissue homeostasis .
a large number of stimulators , their receptors , transcription factors , and intermediate molecules are involved for the expression of cytokines and chemokines that has key role in the regulation of neuroinflammation .
a recent review article by ransohoff in science suggested the higher levels of inflammatory mediators in parenchyma of stroke and tbi compared to ad , pd , and als , indicating potential roles of environmental triggers in the latter group [ 6 ] .
here , we explicitly discuss major players involved in neuroinflammation .
3.1 .
microglia microglia is the resident macrophage of the cns that is ubiquitously distributed in brain .
microglia constantly survey assigned regions in the brain using their highly motile processes , for the presence of pathogenic molecules and endogenous debris .
simultaneously , microglia provide factors to support tissue maintenance [ 59 ] , protection and remodeling of synapses , and maintenance and plasticity of neuronal circuits [ 60 ] .
microglia activated by the pathological triggers ( e.g. , neuronal debris and protein aggregates ) extend its processes to the injury site or migrate to the lesion , where they initiate an innate immune response ( figures 1 and 2 ) [ 2 ] .
such pathological triggers are recognized by receptors that are discussed in later sections .
in response to signaling molecules like damps and cytokines , microglia transform from inactive ( ramified ) to active ( phagocytic ) state , releasing more proinflammatory molecules ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
in chronic neuroinflammation , these cells are activated for extended periods , releasing large amount of cytokines and neurotoxic molecules that contribute to neurodegeneration [ 61 ] .
macrophage activation can be categorized as m1 ( classically activated ) or m2 ( alternatively activated ) .
m1 macrophages are effector macrophages that are stimulated by ifngamma and tnf to produce aggressive first - line immune response .
m2 represents other types of macrophages , usually stimulated by il - 4 , having anti - inflammatory roles in wound healing and macrophage response regulation [ 2 ] .
the switching of m2 to m1 state is thought to have significant effect on the intensity and development of peripheral inflammation ( figure 2 ) .
since this effect is potentially important with microglia in the cns , further studies are essential to elucidate microglial switch during neuroinflammation [ 2 ] .
3.2 .
astrocytes astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell type in the cns , which provide mechanical and metabolic support to neurons , and are involved in regulating critical biochemical activities such as neural network , ionic and extracellular space volume homeostasis , synaptic plasticity , and blood flow [ 62 ] .
in response to a pathological condition , astrocytes change their morphological and functional state and get activated , which could be either beneficial ( radial - glial - like astrocytes ) or detrimental ( reactive astrocytes ) as shown in figure 2 [ 63 ] .
upon activation , astrocytes release proinflammatory signaling molecules ( e.g. , ils and tnf - alpha ) , abundantly in the cortex and midbrain [ 64 ] .
even though microglia releases inflammatory cytokine at higher level than astrocytes [ 65 ] , the combined glial response could be essential in the development of neurodegeneration [ 66 ] .
a dynamic crosstalk between bbb endothelial cells , microglia , astrocytes , and neurons exists and it is expected that a neuroinflammatory response from one cell type will directly impact other [ 67 ] .
3.3 .
endothelial cells endothelial cell ( ec ) is a principal cell type of the bbb .
the transport of molecules across the ecs layer is a key to understand how peripheral inflammation can cause prolonged and detrimental brain inflammation .
mediators of inflammation such as cytokines and chemokines were thought to be very large to enter the brain .
however , active transport systems were identified at the bbb to allow cytokines movement across the bbb [ 2 , 68 ] .
humoral factors such as chemokines are associated with the movement of leukocytes across the bbb ( figure 1 ) .
for example , ccl19 and ccl21 enable t cell adhesion to the bbb , whereas cxcl12 may play a role in reducing t cell infiltration [ 69 ] .
astrocytes produce many such humoral factors , which has effect on the integrity of the bbb .
for example , bradykinin induce astrocytes to release of il - 6 to make bbb leaky during inflammation [ 70 ] .
furthermore , other cytokines such as il - 1beta and tnf - alpha were also shown to stimulate permeability of the bbb , enabling the entry of leukocytes in the brain [ 71 ] .
these cytokines are known to alter bbb integrity by modulating the resistance of tight junctions in brain vasculature ecs [ 72 ] .
the increased permeability is possibly due to the damage of integral tight - junction proteins ( e.g. , occludin ) through its interaction with the cytoskeleton [ 73 ] .
3.4 .
stimulators damps , also called alarmins and damage signals , are thought to be the principal sterile inflammation triggering agents .
these endogenous molecules are recognized by host cells that alert the innate immune system to unscheduled cell death and response to stress .
major putative damps in nonpathogenic neuroinflammation are discussed in a separate section later .
3.5 .
receptors microglia and astrocytes are the major brain cells that express innate immune prrs like tlrs , rage , nod - like receptors ( nlrs ) , scavenger , complement , and mannose receptors .
these cells also release cytokines such as tnf , il - 6 , il - 1 , ifn , and chemokines when stimulated with damps .
major prrs in astrocytes and microglia are covered in a section later .
3.6 .
cytokines cytokines are proteins of 15 - 25 kda molecular weights that have a role of chemical messenger between cells of the immune system .
the expression levels of cytokines were elevated in inflammatory conditions such as infection , tissue injury , and immunological alterations and are involved in repairing damaged tissues and restoration of homeostasis [ 74 ] .
cytokines are generally classified into pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines , which facilitate and inhibit inflammatory responses , respectively .
il - 1beta , il - 6 , and tnf - alpha are well known proinflammatory cytokines , whereas il - 4 and il - 10 are among the most widely investigated anti - inflammatory cytokines [ 75 ] .
in the brain , activated microglia and astrocytes are the primary proinflammatory cytokine expressing cells .
under normal physiological conditions , cytokines levels are usually maintained at low levels [ 76 ] .
however , when infection , trauma , or ischemic attack altered the cns microenvironment , cytokines expression is activated by glial cells [ 77 ] .
during pathological conditions , cytokine levels increase 100 - fold over normal conditions [ 75 , 78 ] .
proteins such as lipocalin - 2 have secondary function as a cytokine ; however , their role in neuroinflammation is still under investigation [ 79 , 80 ] .
3.7 .
chemokines chemokines are small proteins of 8 - 14 kda molecular weights that are primarily known for their role of attracting circulating leukocytes to the inflammation or injury sites ( figure 1 ) .
under normal physiological conditions in the brain , chemokines acting on microglia and astrocytes contribute to physiological processes , such as memory , learning , synapse formation , and brain development .
chemokines engage mainly in chemotaxis that are involved in cns development and homeostatic migration and turnover of cells such as neural precursors in the adult brain [ 81 ] .
on the other hand during infection or injury , the main change in chemokines is their increased expression level and the most described feature is the chemoattraction of immune cells from the periphery to the brain parenchyma via bbb ( figure 1 ) [ 81 ] .
the infiltrated peripheral cells maintain inflammation through cytokine and chemokine secretion , activating resident microglia and astrocytes .
additionally , endothelial cells and neurons were found to constitutively express chemokines and their receptors in the brain .
the recruitment and overactivation of such cell types can become deleterious for neuronal survival and function .
cx3cl1 or fractalkine / neurotactin , ccl2 or monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 , and cxcl12 or stromal cell - derived factor - 1 are the three most studied chemokines in the adult cns [ 81 ] .
similar to the neuropeptide and neurotransmitter systems , chemokine system is constitutively and unevenly expressed in the brain with respect to chemokine expressing brain cells [ 82 , 83 ] .
thus , chemokine system is known to participate in important ( patho ) physiological processes in the brain , through autocrine or paracrine activity [ 84 ] .
moreover , the chemokine system has been shown to interact with neuropeptide and neurotransmitter systems [ 85 , 86 ] .
4. damage - associated molecular patterns damps are the equivalent of pamps but are endogenous molecules .
they are vital for tissue repair , whereas they also play important role in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases ( figures 2 and 3 ) .
thus , damps seems to be a double - edged sword [ 87 ] .
the following are the major characteristics of damps : ( 1 ) being released by nonprogrammed cell death such as necrotic , aponecrotic , necroptosis , and pyroptosis ; ( 2 ) being released by immune cells without dying , which are generally secreted by endoplasmic reticulum - golgi secretion pathway ; ( 3 ) activating receptor - expressing cells of the immune system and thus directly or indirectly promoting innate or adaptive immune responses ; ( 4 ) regulating the inflammatory response to clear injury and initiate repair ; however , excessive activation of inflammation may cause further damage .
a putative list of damps recognized in the cns inflammation is provided in table 1 , and some are discussed below .
4.1 .
high - mobility group box 1 protein hmgb1 is a dna - binding protein that is widely expressed in various tissues including brain .
the release of hmgb1 in the extracellular milieu from damaged neurons and oligodendrocyte - like cells serves as damage signal to evoke inflammatory reactions , such as the activation of endothelial cells , glial cells , and various blood immune cells , exacerbating brain damage ( figures 1 - 3 ) [ 88 , 89 ] .
elevation of hmgb1 in brain was measured in nondegenerative neuroinflammatory condition such as tbi [ 90 ] , ethanol exposure [ 91 ] , and stress - induced neuroinflammatory priming [ 92 ] .
in addition , hmgb1 was discovered to be released from neurons and glia in a mouse model of acute and chronic seizures [ 20 ] .
further , its level is significantly high in the cytosolic and particulate fractions of ad brains [ 93 ] .
also , hmgb1 seems to colocalize with abeta in senile plaque that are associated with activated microglia , inhibiting microglial clearance and enhancing abeta neurotoxicity [ 93 , 94 ] .
a neuropathological hallmark of pd is the abnormal accumulation of alpha - synuclein filaments in lewy bodies .
several studies indicated the preferential binding of hmgb1 to aggregate alpha - synuclein in lewy bodies [ 95 , 96 ] .
further , in animal models of pd , an interaction between a microglial prrs , mac1 , and hmgb1 was identified .
the hmgb1 - mac1 - nadph oxidase signaling axis is known to induce chronic inflammation and progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration , indicating the possible role of persistent inflammation and chronic neurodegeneration [ 94 , 97 , 98 ] .
interestingly , hmgb1 seems to be neuroprotective against the polyglutamine repeats toxicity in the hd models by exhibiting chaperone - like activity [ 99 ] .
studies indicate that hmgb1 acts as a ligand for rage , tlr2 , and tlr4 , which ultimately activates several mapks and nf - kappab to regulate the expression of classic proinflammatory cytokines such as ifngamma , il - 1beta , il - 1alpha , tnf - alpha , and il - 6 [ 100 , 101 ] .
altogether , the role of hmgb1 in brain is less than straightforward .
however , in all diseases and animal models it has capacity to assume a proinflammatory role .
understanding the function of hmgb1 and its receptors in different contexts is important in positioning it as a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammatory conditions .
4.2 .
heat shock proteins hsp is a family of molecular chaperones that facilitate the stabilization of damaged polypeptides .
there are six major subfamilies : hsp100 , hsp90 , hsp70 , hsp40 , and small hsps ( e.g. , hsp27 and alphab crystalline ) [ 94 ] .
the role of hsps as damps in brain injury has not yet been fully elucidated .
however , there are multiple reports implicating hsps in various tissue injury models [ 102 , 103 ] .
these studies demonstrated the extracellular release of hsps from injured cells , activating inflammation in surrounding cells [ 104 ] .
hsp70 present in the extracellular milieu was shown to bind tlr2 and tlr4 in the inflammatory cells and induce the expression and release of cytokines [ 105 ] .
in a more recent study , intrathecally injected hsp60 injured neuronal cells and oligodendrocytes in the cns , whereas mice lacking tlr4 and myd88 ( tlr4 adaptor molecule ) are found to be protective against deleterious effects of hsp60 [ 106 ] .
in an animal model of stroke , namely , middle cerebral artery and reperfusion ( mcao ) , inhibition of hsp90 by 17 - dimethylaminoethylamino - 17 - demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17 - dmag ) protected bbb integrity [ 107 ] .
hsp70 induced in tbi had protective effects against brain injury , suggesting its pharmacological role [ 108 ] .
further , heat stress - induced hsp70 rendered neuroprotection by interrupting the phosphorylation of ikappab , jnk , and p38 in astrocytes , effectively downregulating the expression of proinflammatory genes [ 109 ] .
in neurodegenerative diseases , including ad , hsp70 is thought to induce protein conformational change in favor of nontoxic form [ 110 ] .
in a separate study , both animals and human patients of temporal lobe epilepsy ( tle ) had high hsp60 in their plasma and hippocampus ; thus it has also been proposed as a biomarker of hippocampal stress having potential use for the diagnosis and tle management [ 111 ] .
altogether , these reports indicate diverse function of hsps depending on their type and disease condition .
since hsps bind to misfolded proteins to assist the correct folding , it is not unlikely that the role of hsps as damps was misunderstood for the proteins with altered structure .
further extensive studies are essential to test this hypothesis .
4.3 .
s100b calcium - modulate protein b ( s100b ) is a member of s100 super family that is primarily secreted from astrocytes [ 112 ] .
it is neurotropic in the nanomolar concentration but has lethal effects on neuronal integrity in micromolar doses .
also , at higher doses , s100b promotes neuroinflammation via the activation of rage in astrocytes and microglia [ 113 ] .
in ad , the level of s100b is highest in the most severely affected regions of the brain , being associated with plaques [ 114 ] .
additionally , ad patients with higher s100b levels exhibit lower cognitive scores [ 115 ] .
in mouse model of ad , s100b expression promotes abeta biogenesis and tau hyperphosphorylation , enhancing the neuroinflammation [ 116 ] .
also , the pharmacological inhibition of s100b expression by arundic acid ameliorates plaque load and gliosis in the cortex and hippocampus [ 117 ] .
in the brain of pd patients , s100b protein level is highly elevated in the degenerating substantia nigra region [ 118 ] .
s100b gene ablation in mice protected them against 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1,2,3,6 - tetrahydropyridine - ( mptp - ) induced neurotoxicity via the reduction in microgliosis and expression of rage and tnf - alpha receptor [ 118 ] .
in hd , rage colocalizes with s100b , especially in astrocytes , which is thought to impact the hd progression via the activation of nf - kappab [ 119 ] .
however , some studies predicted neuroprotective role of s100b [ 120 ] ; thus , the verdict regarding beneficial or detrimental role of s100b in pd remains open .
s100b level is also higher in the brain and blood of patients suffering from epilepsy and tbi [ 121 , 122 ] .
due to the constant elevation of s100b in the serum of neuroinflammatory conditions with compromised bbb , it is considered as a marker of bbb integrity [ 123 , 124 ] .
the extracellular role of other members of s100 superfamily such as s100a8 and s100a9 has been studied in peripheral acute / chronic inflammatory disorders .
however , their expression and functions in brain remain enigmatic .
4.4 .
deoxyribonucleic acid dna is tightly packed in the nucleus .
however , freely circulating dna ( both nuclear and mitochondrial ) was detected in the plasma of critically ill and old myocardial infarction and trauma patients [ 125 , 126 ] .
in a study of 800 caucasian subjects , pinti et al. measured increased plasma levels of mt - dna after the 5th decade of life [ 126 ] .
during aging , proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf - alpha , il - 6 , il - 1beta , and rantes are mildly elevated in the plasma , which is recognized as " inflammaging " [ 126 - 128 ] .
more recent study showed the induction of proinflammatory cytokines secretion in primary astrocytes by mt - polynucleotides [ 129 ] .
in vitro , mt - dna induced the expression of cytokines via tlr9 in monocytes [ 126 ] .
this dna sensing receptor is highly expressed in the astrocytes and microglia , suggesting its potential role in neuroinflammation [ 128 ] .
cell - free dna is thought to arise from necrotic or apoptotic cells .
similar to mt - dna , the quantity of nuclear cell - free dna seems to be associated with aging [ 125 ] .
tlr9 is the ubiquitous receptor for the endocytosed dna .
however , it is also thought to activate non - tlrs , expanding the list of dna sensing receptors and downstream pathways [ 130 ] .
further studies are essential for a clear understanding on the roles of dna ( and rna ) in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration .

adenosine triphosphate atp is a purine base that mediates biochemical processes such as glucose metabolism , biosynthesis , and muscle contraction within the cell .
even though atp has role inside the cell , it is released extracellularly from injured or dead cells and triggers the activation of nlrp3 , p2x7r , and caspase - 1 to release inflammatory mediators such as il - 6 , tnf - alpha , and cox - 2 [ 131 , 132 ] .
in a more recent study , mitochondrial lysates induced inflammation and showed ad - like changes in microglial and neuronal cells , indicating the potential role of extracellular atp in neuroinflammatory conditions [ 133 ] .
additionally , extracellular atp significantly increased the intracellular alpha - synuclein levels in neurons , causing lysosomal dysfunction [ 134 ] .
the accumulation of alpha - synuclein in neurons to form lewy bodies is the pathological hallmark of pd. extracellular atp is thought to be toxic for primary neuronal as well as organotypic cns cultures [ 94 ] .
in bv2 microglial cells , neuronal mitochondrial lysates induced the expression of tnf - alpha , nf - kappab , and il - 8 mrna and phosphorylation of p38 mapk [ 133 ] .
additionally , emerging studies showed that pharmacological targeting of atp - gated purinergic p2 receptors ( p2x1 - 7 and p2y11 ) can potentially modulate the generation of seizures , seizure - induced brain damage , and inflammatory processes [ 135 - 137 ] .
collectively , extracellular atp has damp - like function , triggering neuroinflammation and elevating neurodegeneration .
4.6 .
uric acid uric acid is the ultimate catabolite of purine metabolism , which is disposed via kidneys and excreted in urine .
also , it is a main antioxidant in blood [ 138 ] .
uric acid in the pd model considerably attenuated the disease [ 139 ] .
a study in ad patients also showed protective role of uric acid [ 140 ] .
exogenous administration of uric acid is also neuroprotective in experimental models of cns diseases such as brain ischemia , meningitis , and ischemic stroke [ 138 ] .
a more recent study in stroke patients showed that decrease in blood uric acid levels during the first week after onset of stroke correlated to more severe stroke , unfavorable stroke evolution , and poor long - term stroke outcome [ 141 ] .
the deficiency in uricase enzyme increases serum levels of uric acid that forms monosodium urate ( msu ) crystals .
also , when extracellular uric acid comes in contact with high levels of free sodium , it is believed to nucleate and form msu crystals [ 142 ] .
these msu crystals are sensed by il - 1r , tlr2 , and tlr4 , which then activate nlrp3 inflammasome leading to il - 1beta production [ 143 , 144 ] .
taken together , microenvironment of uric acid may determine whether it has therapeutic or toxic effects .
the pathological mechanisms of msu crystal formation and nlrp3 inflammasome / caspase - 1 activation in the brain remain to be addressed .
5. pattern - recognition receptors a group of receptors that are engaged to recognize certain molecular structures or patterns are referred to as prrs .
since these receptors sense multiple molecules ( pamps and damps ) to induce downstream signaling , they do not follow the classical 1 : 1 ligand - receptor relation [ 79 , 145 ] .
the role of activation of these prrs is to protect host against danger , but their aberrant activation could contribute to accelerate inflammatory processes ( figure 4 ) .
some of the major pprs are discussed below .
5.1 .
toll - like receptors tlrs comprise a large family of transmembrane receptors that recognize a diverse range of exogenous or endogenous molecular signals , activating the innate immune system [ 146 ] .
tlr2 and tlr4 are membrane bound surface receptors that sense extracellular damps , whereas tlr9 is located intracellular that sense intracellular damp ligand such as dna [ 94 ] .
interestingly , peripheral tissue damage ( e.g. , following cytotoxic treatment ) also possesses tlr - mediated glial activation capacity [ 147 , 148 ] .
moreover , tlrs involved in signaling damps may interact at several levels , but almost all converge into the activation of nf - kappab [ 149 ] .
tlr4 is the most extensively characterized tlr subtype with established host immune response .
until recently , tlr4 expression in the brain was limited to microglia , astrocytes , and oligodendrocytes .
new studies have now shown that tlr4 is also expressed on cns structures such as choroid plexus , circumventricular organs , and leptomeninges [ 150 ] .
recent evidences have linked tlr4 - signaling in multiple neurodegenerative conditions such as ad , pd , stroke , and tbi [ 151 , 152 ] .
when activated , tlr4 recruits adaptor molecules and kinases , initiating the downstream signaling cascade that ends with the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [ 151 ] .
tnf , il - 1beta , il - 1 receptor , il - 6 , il - 8 , il - 10 , il - 12p40 , il - 23 , mip - 1alpha / 1beta , ifn - beta , and chemokines are downstream product of tlr4 pathway [ 153 ] .
these factors induce inflammatory reactions within the cns and facilitate the inflammatory response by increasing vascular permeability , directing dendritic cells , and initiating macrophage entry into the cns ( figures 1 - 4 ) [ 154 ] .
other tlrs , primarily tlr2 and tlr9 , were also stimulated in multiple neuroinflammatory conditions ( review , tlrs in ad [ 155 ]) .
together , studies suggest tlrs as a potential robust drug target to ameliorate severe neuroinflammation .
5.2 .
receptor for advanced glycation end products rage belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily , which is expressed in astrocytes , microglia , neurons , and endothelial cells in brain .
it was recognized as a receptor for advanced glycation end products ( aegs ) .
however , rage interacts with a variety of other endogenous ligands such as abeta , hmgb1 , and s100 , and exogenous molecules of bacteria and prions .
stimulation of rage activates mapks ( e.g. , extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 / 2 , erk1 / 2 ; p38 mapk ) and nf - kappab [ 94 , 156 ] .
5.3 .
nod - like receptors nlrs are expressed in several immune and nonimmune cells that sense variety of pamps and damps intracellularly .
pyrin domain containing receptors ( nlrps ) , leucine reach repeat , and nucleotide - binding oligomerization domain belong to this receptor family [ 94 , 157 ] .
inflammasome - forming nlrs are the extensively studied and well characterized classes of nlrs .
the signal specificity and functional roles of inflammasome - forming nlrs are not yet known clearly .
upon sensing pamps or damps , an nlr is thought to forms a multimeric protein complex called inflammasome .
it is a large macromolecular complex that contains multiple copies of pattern recognizing receptors , caspase - 1 , and an adaptor protein called apoptosis - associated speck - like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain ( asc ) [ 158 , 159 ] .
as shown in figure 4 , caspase - 1 then mediates the cleavage of pro - il - 1beta and pro - il - 18 into their mature forms of il - 1beta and il - 18 , which has critical roles in mediating immune responses during inflammation and innate immunity [ 158 ] .
stimulation of nlrs also promotes downstream activation of nf - kappab or mapk signaling pathways , leading to the increase in production of cytokines and chemokines [ 94 ] .
6. therapeutic strategies to alleviate sterile neuroinflammation in the physiological conditions , damps are essential to initiate tissue repair .
however , release of enormously large amount of damps and uncontrolled activation of prrs contribute to the pathogenesis of many neuroinflammatory conditions ( figure 3 ) .
the possibilities and attempts of targeting damps , its receptors , and other downstream signaling molecules to attenuate excessive neuroinflammation are discussed below ( figure 5 ) .
hmgb1 and its receptors are mostly targeted in several inflammatory conditions , which are also reflected in this review .
a list of drugs that are able to attenuate nonpathogenic cns inflammation are provided in table 2 .
6.1 .
inhibition of damps release endogenous neuropeptides , specifically vasoactive intestinal peptide ( vip ) and urocortin , acted as inhibitors of hmgb1 cytokine activity that increased the survival of animals with established endotoxemia .
additionally , another endogenous neuropeptide , pituitary adenylate cyclase - activating polypeptide ( pacap ) , significantly reduced circulating hmgb1 levels and rescued animals in lethal endotoxemia administration [ 160 ] .
in mice , these neuropeptides downregulated the translocation of hmgb1 from nucleus into the cytoplasm ; this protective effect was completely reversed by the administration of recombinant hmgb1 [ 160 , 161 ] .
acetylcholine , neurotransmitter , is shown to inhibit hmgb1 release from human macrophages by signaling through a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nachr ) .
the stimulation of nachrs inhibited hmgb1 secretion induced by tnf - alpha via nf - kappab activation [ 162 ] .
the blockade of glutamate / nmda stimulation by mk - 801 prevented the release of hmgb1 inhibiting neuroinflammation through tlr4 [ 163 ] .
eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa ) , a peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ( ppargamma ) agonist , restored the optimum ppargamma expression , attenuating the ischemic brain damage by downregulating the release of hmgb1 signal related molecules [ 164 ] .
a major constituent of licorice root , glycyrrhizin ( gl ) , is suggested to inhibit the release of hmgb1 in tbi rat and mouse models .
gl suppressed the bbb permeability and impairment of motor functions along with the inhibition of hmgb1 translocation in the neurons at injury sites [ 165 ] .
in mcao model of stroke , i.v. administration of gl significantly reduced infarct volumes , showing neuroprotection via anti - inflammatory property by inhibiting hmgb1 secretion [ 161 , 166 ] .
carbenoxolone ( cbx ) is a synthetic gl derivative that abrogated lipopolysaccharide - ( lps - ) induced hmgb1 release in macrophage cultures by impairing pkr activation [ 167 ] .
a chinese herb " danshen " contains the abundant red pigments called tanshinones that has similar structure to steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs .
these steroid derivatives significantly protected mice against lethal endotoxemia by selectively blocking the endotoxin - induced cytoplasmic translocation and release of hmgb1 [ 168 ] .
two statin molecules , atorvastatin and simvastatin , protected rat brains from ischemic injury by significantly attenuating the overexpression of hmgb1 , rage , tlr4 , and nf - kappab induced in ischemia [ 169 ] .
synthetic molecules such as nafamostat mesilate ( nm ) , gabexate mesilate ( gm ) , and sivelestat sodium hydrate drastically reduced lps - induced injury at least partly by inhibiting hmgb1 [ 170 - 172 ] .
ethyl pyruvate ( ep ) inhibited nuclear - to - cytoplasmic translocation of hmgb1 and markedly attenuated the expressions of tlr4 , dna - binding activity of nf - kappab , and expression of inflammatory mediators ( il - 1beta , tnf - alpha , and il - 6 ) in tbi rats [ 173 , 174 ] .
6.2 .
neutralization of damps emerging evidences support that hmgb1 neutralizing antibodies and hmgb1 a box antagonist have therapeutic potential to ameliorate excessive inflammation [ 175 ] .
hmgb1 antagonist competitively inhibits hmgb1 surface binding and attenuates proinflammatory cytokine release in stroke [ 176 , 177 ] .
it efficiently interacts with rage , competing with the binding of full - length protein , but does not activate the receptor , lacking the proinflammatory activity located on the box b [ 161 , 178 ] .
in a rat model , anti - hmgb1 mab significantly prevented dopaminergic neurons in snpc and dopaminergic terminals in the striatum to attenuate behavioral symptoms of pd. in addition , intravenously administered anti - hmgb1 mab suppressed bbb disruption and neuroinflammation [ 179 ] .
in glutamate / nmda excitotoxicity model of neurodegeneration , hmgb1 neutralizing antibodies block neuroimmune induced neuronal death [ 163 ] .
further , neutralization of damps was predicted to enhance the clearance of abeta in ad patients [ 93 ] .
orally active vaccine developed to neutralize pathogenic effect of abeta has also improved cognitive function of ad mice [ 180 ] .
treatment with neutralizing antibody was associated with less phosphorylation of ikappab , which successfully reduced damage caused by ischemia reperfusion injury in mice [ 181 ] .
damps such as hsps perhaps are not the good therapeutic targets , because of their critical role in the cell survival .
thus , it is essential to understand altered structures of hsps that are alarmins so that only structurally altered hsps can be targeted by neutralizing antibodies or antagonists .
the idea of using anti - damp antibodies is mainly to reduce pathological conditions and augment the efficacy of potential therapeutic approaches based on its blockade .
antibody - based strategy suffers from a multiple drawback of possible conformational switches in the tertiary structure of the antibody - recognition sites .
furthermore , humanization of antibodies is another challenge for the development of anti - damp antibodies .
6.3 .
blockade of damps - specific receptors a study was carried out to investigate immune response in ad model by neutralization of tlr2 and tlr4 using anti - tlr2 and anti - tlr4 antibodies .
tlr2 and tlr4 - specific antibodies blocked ~ 50 % and ~ 30 % of cell response to trigger innate immunity to fibrillar abeta ( 1 - 42 ) [ 182 ] .
to neutralize a receptor of abeta , rage , an orally active aqueous vaccine against a rage / abeta complex was developed .
in vitro prepared rage / abeta complex induced a greater immunogenic response in both human and mice than individual rage or abeta .
further , an orally administered vaccine of rage / abeta complex or abeta alone improved the cognitive function of ad transgenic mice .
also , rage / abeta complex is more effective than abeta [ 180 ] .
s100p - derived small peptides blocked rage - mediated signaling at micromolar concentration , quenching nf - kappab activity .
these peptides inhibited glioma tumor growth by reducing the ability of these ligands to stimulate rage [ 161 , 183 ] .
n - benzyl - 4 - chloro - n - cyclohexylbenzamide ( fps - zm1 ) is a biologically nontoxic and bbb permeable rage specific antagonist that attenuated neuroinflammation in ad [ 184 ] and subarachnoid hemorrhage ( sah ) animal models [ 185 ] .
since many damps signal inflammation induction via rage , fps - zm1 potentially dampens inflammation induction in other neuroinflammatory conditions .
more recently , a newly developed , potent , and selective inhibitor of nlrp3 , mcc950 , significantly inhibited il - 1beta production in an animal model of multiple sclerosis , which could be a potential therapeutic agent for other nlrp3 - associated neuroinflammatory conditions [ 186 ] .
also , inhibitors of proinflammatory cytokines such as il - 1 receptor antagonists potentially attenuate the propagation of neuroinflammation [ 187 ] .
it is important to note that the complete blockade of prrs would be detrimental for cell survival .
a study in mice showed that the absence of tlr2 impaired hippocampal neurogenesis .
further , tlr2 and tlr4 directly modulated self - renewal and the cell - fate decision of neural stem progenitor cells [ 188 ] .
6.4 .
inhibition of signaling pathways downstream of receptors resveratrol is a natural polyphenol associated with anti - inflammatory effects by preferentially inhibiting nf - kappab activation following cytokine release upon abeta stimulation .
resveratrol is currently in clinical trials for ad , which significantly decreased microglial activation and lowered cerebral amyloid deposition in the animal model of ad [ 189 ] .
exogenous pacap inhibited the upregulation of tlr4 and its downstream signaling molecules myd88 , p - ikappab , and nf - kappab in tbi animal model , which ultimately suppressed the expression if inflammatory agents such as il - 1beta and tnf - alpha in the brain .
in addition , pacap significantly improved motor and cognitive dysfunction , decreased brain edema , and reduced neuronal cell death following tbi [ 190 ] .
methotrexate ( mtx ) is used in chemotherapy of tumors and autoimmune diseases , which was identified to directly interact with hmgb1 .
the binding of mtx inhibited hmgb1 / rage interaction at molecular and cellular levels , reducing the anti - inflammatory function of hmgb1 [ 191 ] .
a cholesterol - lowering agent , simvastatin , has demonstrated neuroprotective effect by markedly attenuating the expression of tlr4 , nf - kappab , and downstream inflammatory modulator ( e.g. , il - 1beta , il - 6 , tnf - alpha , and icam - 1 ) after tbi in rats [ 192 ] .
tanshinone ii a ( tan iia ) markedly reduced the expression levels of hmgb1 , tlr4 , rage , and nf - kappab after ischemia in rats [ 193 ] .
luteolin , present in various fruits and vegetables , has the ability to downregulate tlr4 and nf - kappab expression and protect rat against the focal ischemia [ 194 ] .
mln519 is a well characterized proteasome inhibitor , which also has a role to modulate nf - kappab activity , attenuating expression of cytokines and cellular adhesion molecules and reducing neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into the ischemic rat brain [ 195 ] .
6.5 .
activation of damps clearance during the normal physiological conditions , potential damps can be eliminated by several mechanisms .
for example , abeta can be degraded by enzymes neprilysin and insulin - degrading enzyme in the brain parenchyma [ 196 ] , absorbed into the blood by low density lipoprotein receptor protein - 1 pathway [ 197 ] , and cleared by perivascular lymphatic drainage pathways [ 198 ] .
drainage of the brain extracellular fluids , particularly interstitial fluid ( isf ) and csf , is important for volume regulation .
however , recent evidences suggest its role for the removal of waste products ( e.g. , p - tau and abeta ) , which is thought to be imbalanced in neurodegenerative diseases [ 199 , 200 ] .
the abnormal phosphorylation of protein such as tau is a contributing factor to the pathogenic processes to a toxic gain of function ( e.g. , increased tau - tau , tau - abeta , and interaction ) , making it difficult to eliminate [ 201 ] .
methylthioninium chloride ( mtc ) is a first identified tau aggregation inhibitor that facilitates the clearance of abnormally phosphorylated tau [ 202 ] .
identification of tau specific ( hyper ) phosphorylation inhibitor would be extremely beneficial to enhance the elimination of abnormally folded protein .
in addition , adding a tag to the tangled ( e.g. , p - tau ) , structurally altered ( e.g. , hmgb1 , hsps , and s100b ) , and aggregated proteins ( e.g. , abeta ) would improve the lymphatic clearance of brain by increasing their solubility in isf and csf .
7. concluding remarks current strategies in clinical development to attenuate detrimental effects of neuroinflammation include ( 1 ) global blockade of damp receptors such as tlrs and rage using natural antagonists , small molecule inhibitors , soluble receptor - specific extracellular domains ( e.g. , tlr extracellular domains ) , and neutralizing antibodies ; ( 2 ) inhibition of signaling pathways downstream of damp receptors stimulation such as myd88 / traf / irak complex formation , mapk or ikappab phosphorylation , and nf - kappab translocation using small molecules .
the global blockage of prrs might create a problem by suppressing immune response essential during pathogen invaded infection .
thus , a comparative analysis of downstream signaling domains such as transcription factors , adaptors , and kinases activated by pamps versus damps is essential to highlight key differences , because , if selectively targeted , it could lead to specific therapies engineered to silence danger signals without compromising host immune defense .
the idea of targeting inflammatory activities of damps to confer protection against tissue injury is validated in multiple preclinical studies .
the discovery of drug targets to ameliorate brain injury by neutralizing damps , activating damps clearing processes , and inhibiting damps release provides a new paradigm for the strategic development of experimental therapeutics .
the emerging research field deserves to be largely explored also in the search for effective drugs to attenuate uncontrolled neuroinflammation triggered by damps .

damage signals or damps primarily released from the injured parenchymal cells are sensed by immune effector cells such as microglia , astrocytes , and macrophages .
the triggered innate immune response ( e.g. , proinflammatory cytokines , chemokines , reactive oxygen species , excitotoxins , histamine , and prostaglandins ) has detrimental influences on the neurons , oligodendroglial precursors , and vascular endothelial cells .
the increased bbb permeability contributes the migration of peripheral immune cells ( e.g. , neutrophils , mast cells , and macrophages ) to the sites of tissue damage .
figure 2 response of microglia and astrocytes to the brain injury .
damps can signal prrs expressed in astrocytes and microglia , promoting their activation .
depending on the injury site , severity of brain injury , surrounding environment , and signaling strength , astrocytes and microglia may respond to remove stimulants or to secrete inflammatory mediators .
typically , beneficial activation ( m2 - like microglia and radial - glia - like astrocytes ) is associated with the elevated release of neurotrophic factors , anti - inflammatory cytokines ( e.g. , il - 4 and il - 10 ) , and enzymes ( e.g. , arginase 1 and insulin - degrading enzymes ) that enhance phagocytic activity .
conversely , detrimental activation of astrocytes and microglia is associated with the elevated and sustained expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase , reactive oxygen species , proinflammatory mediators ( e.g. , il - 1alpha / beta , il - 6 , and tnf ) , and decreased secretion of neurotrophic factors .
these divergent responses may determine whether microglia and astrocytes lead to clear tissue debris or promote chronic neuroinflammation .
figure 3 propagation of " damage signals. " harmful stimuli in the brain ( e.g. , brain injury and excessive neurodegeneration ) generate endogenous damps that induce the release of inflammatory mediators by activating prrs .
in turn , these molecules upregulate their own expression , directly activate the release of damps , and trigger further tissue damage leading to increasing damps level .
hence , a sustained aggressive cycle may result in chronic neuroinflammation .
however , a controlled release of damps has beneficial roles in immunity and tissue repair process .
figure 4 mechanisms of glial cell activation in response to damage signals .
sterile neuroinflammatory conditions are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded and aggregated proteins in the brain .
these damps are released from different subcellular components of the damaged neurons , which trigger respective prrs leading to downstream activation of proinflammatory cascades and enhancing effects of initial inflammatory insult .
activation of prrs , primarily tlr2 , tlr4 , tlr9 , and rage , converge largely into nf - kappab activation , promoting cell death and / or contributing to neuroinflammatory / neurodegenerative mechanisms .
these pathways , including p2xr , jointly work with multiprotein inflammasome complex ( nlrs ) that assists the generation of mature cytokines from proforms via the activation of caspase - 1 .

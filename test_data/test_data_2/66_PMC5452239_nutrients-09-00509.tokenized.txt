obesity is a risk factor for developing inflammatory bowel disease .
pea is unique with its high content of dietary fiber , polyphenolics , and glycoproteins , all of which are known to be health beneficial .
we aimed to investigate the impact of green pea ( gp ) supplementation on the susceptibility of high - fat diet ( hfd ) - fed mice to dextran sulfate sodium ( dss ) - induced colitis .
six - week - old c57bl / 6j female mice were fed a 45 % hfd or hfd supplemented with 10 % gp. after 7 - week dietary supplementation , colitis was induced by adding 2.5 % dss in drinking water for 7 days followed by a 7 - day recovery period .
gp supplementation ameliorated the disease activity index score in hfd - fed mice during the recovery stage , and reduced neutrophil infiltration , mrna expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ( mcp - 1 ) and inflammatory markers interleukin ( il ) - 6 , cyclooxygenase - 2 ( cox - 2 ) , il - 17 , interferon - gamma ( ifn - gamma ) , and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) in hfd - fed mice .
further , gp supplementation increased mucin 2 content and mrna expression of goblet cell differentiation markers including trefoil factor 3 ( tff3 ) , kruppel - like factor 4 ( klf4 ) , and sam pointed domain ets factor 1 ( spdef1 ) in hfd - fed mice .
in addition , gp ameliorated endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) stress as indicated by the reduced expression of activating transcription factor - 6 ( atf - 6 ) protein and its target genes chaperone protein glucose - regulated protein 78 ( grp78 ) , the ccaat - enhancer - binding protein homologous protein ( chop ) , the er degradation - enhancing alpha - mannosidase - like 1 protein ( edem1 ) , and the x - box binding protein 1 ( xbp1 ) in hfd - fed mice .
in conclusion , gp supplementation ameliorated the severity of dss - induced colitis in hfd - fed mice , which was associated with the suppression of inflammation , mucin depletion , and er stress in the colon .
high - fat diet colitis green pea inflammation mucin 2 endoplasmic reticulum stress 1 .
introduction according to the latest nhanes survey ( 2009 - 2010 ) , 31.9 % of non - pregnant women 20 - 39 years of age are obese , and another one - third are overweight [ 1 ] .
in parallel with the increased obesity prevalence , the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) , consisting of crohn 's disease ( cd ) and ulcerative colitis ( uc ) , is on the rise .
ibd is a chronic relapsing disorder of the gut with a complicated etiology .
increasing evidence indicates that western dietary and life - style habits contribute to the increased prevalence of ibd by inducing intestinal inflammation [ 2 ] .
the western diet is high in fat and low in fiber , which aggravates dextran sodium sulfate ( dss ) - induced colitis [ 3 ] , and is further exacerbated by the intake of red meat [ 4 ] .
long - term high intake of trans - unsaturated fats is associated with an increased risk of uc in women in the usa [ 5 ] .
recently , we found that maternal hfd consumption during gestation and lactation predisposed female offspring to a higher susceptibility to dss - induced colitis through increased inflammatory responses [ 6 ] .
hfd consumption also induces oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) stress [ 7 ] , leading to mucin 2 protein misfolding in cultured colon cells [ 7 ] .
mucin 2 depletion and misfolding correlates with colitis in mice [ 8 ] .
on the contrary to the hfd , high vegetable and fiber intake is associated with a decreased risk of ibd [ 9 ] .
epidemiologically , legume intake was protective against colorectal cancer in a case control study [ 10 ] , and significantly reduced the risk of colorectal adenoma in a meta - analysis of three cohort studies and eleven case control studies [ 11 ] .
legumes and pulses , including peas , are rich in fiber and other phytonutrients that boost beneficial intestinal microbiota [ 12 ] , producing short chain fatty acids ( scfa ) and promoting epithelial barrier integrity [ 13 ] .
further , dietary soybean bowman - birk inhibitor concentrate [ 14 ] , white and dark kidney beans [ 15 ] , and cranberry bean supplements [ 16 ] suppressed colonic inflammation and reduced the severity of dss - induced colitis in mice .
consistently , pea seed albumin extract ameliorated dss - induced colitis in mice by reducing the expression of inflammatory markers in colonic tissues [ 17 ] .
these results suggest that beans in general might have protective effects against colitis .
the objective of the current study was to investigate the preventive effect of dietary green pea ( gp ) supplementation on dss - induced colitis in hfd - fed female mice and further examine its underlying mechanism .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
green pea ( gp ) gp was purchased from moscow food co - op ( moscow , id , usa ) and powdered in the cyclone mill ( model 3010 - 060 , udy corp. , fort collins , co , usa ) .
the powdered gp was shipped to the research diets , inc .
( new brunswick , nj , usa ) for customized diet formulation .
2.2 .
experimental design and animal diets six - week - old c57bl / 6j female mice ( originally purchased from jackson laboratory , bar harbor , me , usa , and inbred in our facility ) were randomly divided into two groups .
one group of mice ( n = 7 ) was fed with the hfd ( 45 % energy from fat , d12451 , research diets inc. , new brunswick , nj , usa ) ( table s1 ) , and the other group of mice ( n = 7 ) was fed hfd supplemented with gp ( 10 % of dry feed weight ) ( hfdgp , d15080605 , research diets inc. , new brunswick , nj , usa ) ( table s1 ) for a total duration of 9 weeks .
the dose of gp ( 10 %) supplement was 100 g / kg of the diet .
the average daily consumption by mice was 2.40 g / mouse .
this equals to 240 mg gp per day for an adult mouse of 20 g ( i.e. , 12 g gp / day / kg body mass ) , which converts to 58.38 g of gp daily consumption for a 60 kg human per the published formula [ 18 ] .
colitis was induced using colitis grade dss ( molecular weight = 36,000 - 50,000 ) ( mp biomedicals , santa ana , ca , usa ) after 7 weeks of dietary supplementation .
both groups were given 2.5 % dss ( w / v ) in drinking water for 7 days followed by a 7 - day recovery period providing normal drinking water ( figure s1 ) .
we used only virgin females in the study to avoid a confounding sex effect and to minimize potential differences in female hormone cycling .
mice were monitored daily throughout the dss treatment and recovery period for disease symptoms .
all mice were housed in a temperature - controlled room with a 12 h light and 12 h dark cycle and had free access to diet and drinking water .
no differences were observed in the average amount of water and feed consumption ( figure s2a ) between treatment groups .
all animal procedures were approved ( baf # 04316 - 010 ) by the washington state university animal care and use committee .
2.3 .
assessment of colitis symptoms and disease activity index mice were monitored daily for body weight loss compared to initial weight ( scored as 0 - 4 ) , fecal consistency ( scored as 0 - 4 ) , and blood in the stool ( scored as 0 - 4 ) throughout the dss treatment and recovery period .
the disease activity index ( dai ) score was assessed as the combined score of the above three criteria [ 19 ] .
2.4 .
colonic tissue collection and processing mice were anesthetized with co2 inhalation and followed by cervical dislocation .
the entire colon was dissected , and a 5 mm segment of the distal colon at a constant location was fixed in freshly prepared 4 % ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde ( ph 7.0 ) , processed , and embedded in paraffin .
the remaining colonic tissue , containing both inflamed and non - inflamed areas , was rinsed in pbs , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at - 80 degreesc for later biochemical analysis .
2.5 .
neutrophil assessment paraffin embedded tissues were cut into 5 microm thick sections , deparaffinized , and hydrated , followed by antigen retrieval , goat serum blocking , and overnight incubation with anti - ly - 6b.2 antibody ( bio - rad laboratories inc. , hercules , ca , usa ) .
after incubation with the secondary antibody , signals were visualized using the vectastain abc and dab peroxidase ( hrp ) substrate kits ( vector laboratories inc. , burlingame , ca , usa ) and haematoxylin counterstaining .
images were taken using the lecia dm2000 led light microscope ( chicago , il , usa ) .
neutrophil infiltration scores were assessed blindly by two researchers using the criteria described previously [ 20 ] .
briefly , the scores for depth of neutrophil infiltration ( scored as 0 - 3 ) and staining intensity ( scored as 0 - 4 ) , which was the percent area positive as extent ( 0 , none ; 1 , < 25 % ; 2 , 25 - 50 % ; 3 , 50 - 75 % ; 4 , > 75 %) , were recorded individually .
the summation of both scores resulted in a total quantified score ranging from 0 to a maximum of 7 per distal colonic section .
nine sections per animal at constant interval were used for microscopic examination and score assessment .
2.6 .
immunoblotting analysis immunoblotting analyses were performed as previously described [ 21 ] .
band density was quantified using the odyssey infrared imaging system and image studio ( tm ) lite software ( li - cor biosciences , lincoln , ne , usa ) , and normalized to the beta - actin content .
antibodies against activating transcription factor - 6 ( atf - 6 ) , mucin 2 , and xanthine oxidase ( xo ) were from santa cruz biotechnology inc .
( dallas , tx , usa ) .
cyclooxygenase - 2 ( cox - 2 ) and interleukin ( il ) - 6 primary antibodies were purchased from cell signaling technology ( beverly , ma , usa ) .
anti - beta - actin antibody was from sigma ( st. louis , mo , usa ) .
irdye 680 goat anti - mouse and irdye 800cw goat anti - rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from li - cor biosciences ( lincoln , ne , usa ) .
2.7 .
qrt - pcr analysis total rna was extracted from the powdered colonic tissue using dynabeads ( r ) mrna direct ( tm ) purification kit ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) following the protocol of the manufacturer .
cdna was synthesized with the iscript ( tm ) cdna synthesis kit ( bio - rad laboratories inc. , hercules , ca , usa ) .
qrt - pcr was performed on a bio - rad cfx384 real - time thermocycler [ 22 ] .
the 18s was used as the reference gene .
primer sequences are provided in table s2 .
2.8 .
statistical analysis all data were analyzed as a complete randomized design using the general linear model of statistical analysis system ( 2000 ) , expressed as mean +/ - standard error of mean ( sem ) .
student 's t - test was used for calculating significance .
a significant difference was considered as p <= 0.05 .
3. results 3.1 .
gp supplementation counteracts symptoms of dss - induced colitis in hfd - fed mice dss - induction caused colitis symptoms in mice .
the hfd - fed mice with and without gp supplementation showed similar symptomatic parameters during the dss - treatment phase ( figure 1 ) .
however , during the recovery phase , the gp - supplemented hfd - fed group recovered faster than mice without gp supplementation .
the body weight loss and body weight loss score remained lower in the gp - supplemented hfd - fed group throughout the recovery period ( figure 1a,b ) .
further , a significant reduction in the fecal blood and dai score was found in gp - supplemented hfd - fed mice ( figure 1c,d ) .
there was no difference in body weight between the two groups before dss - induction ( figure s2b ) .
3.2 .
gp supplementation reduces neutrophil recruitment and monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ( mcp - 1 ) expression in hfd - fed dss - colitis mice gp supplementation reduced the neutrophil recruitment , and resultant tissue damage in the colonic tissues of hfd - fed dss - colitis mice ( figure 2a,b ) .
in accordance , gp supplementation reduced the gene expression of mcp - 1 ( figure 2c ) , which enhances the recruitment of neutrophils into the mesenteric tissues [ 23 ] .
3.3 .
gp supplementation reduces inflammation and oxidative stress in hfd - fed dss - colitis mice in agreement with improved epithelial damage , gp supplementation reduced the protein and mrna expression of both interleukin ( il ) - 6 , and cyclooxygenase - 2 ( cox - 2 ) ( figure 3a,b ) , and reduced the mrna levels of il - 17 , interferon ( ifn - gamma ) , and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) ( figure 3c ) in the hfd - fed dss - colitis mice .
altogether , these data confirmed the beneficial effect of gp via reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in dss - colitis .
3.4 .
gp supplementation enhances muc - 2 secretion and goblet cell differentiation in hfd - fed dss - colitis mice mucin 2 is the major mucin produced by goblet cells and provides an additional protective layer to the gut epithelium .
both the mrna and protein levels of mucin 2 were enhanced in the gp - supplemented hfd - fed dss - treated mice ( figure 4a,b ) .
in agreement , the gene expression of goblet cell differentiation markers including trefoil factor 3 ( tff3 ) , kruppel - like factor 4 ( klf4 ) , and sam pointed domain ets factor 1 ( spdef1 ) were higher in the gp - supplemented hfd - fed dss - induced mice ( figure 4c ) .
3.5 .
gp supplementation suppresses the expression of activating transcription factor - 6 ( atf - 6 ) and er - stress markers in hfd - fed dss - colitis mice ibd is associated with er stress and mucin 2 misfolding [ 24,25 ] .
as part of the unfolded protein response ( upr ) , atf - 6 triggers the transcription of genes encoding the chaperone protein glucose - regulated protein 78 ( grp78 ) , the ccaat - enhancer - binding protein homologous protein ( chop ) , the er degradation - enhancing alpha - mannosidase - like 1 protein ( edem1 ) , and the x - box binding protein 1 ( xbp1 ) [ 26,27 ] .
consistently , gp supplementation reduced the protein expression of atf - 6 ( figure 5a ) and mrna expression of its downstream target genes grp78 , chop ( figure 5b ) , edem1 , and xbp1 in the hfd - fed dss - colitis mice ( figure 5c ) , showing the suppression of er stress .
4. discussion obesity is the root cause of many chronic diseases including diabetes , hypertension , and cardiovascular disease .
consumption of the hfd is associated with intestinal inflammation and increased permeability to the microbial end - products in mice [ 2,28 ] .
the hfd enhances the severity of colitis in experimental colitis mice models [ 7,29,30 ] , and promotes colon cancer initiation [ 31 ] .
further , inclusion of red meat in the westernized hfd aggravated dss - colitis in mice [ 4 ] .
peas are a valuable source of plant proteins , fiber , and polyphenolics [ 32 ] , and its extract reduced inflammation in mice with dss - induced colitis [ 17 ] .
our study shows that supplementation of gp accelerated the recovery from colitis symptoms in the hfd - fed mice as evident from decreased body weight loss and a lower fecal blood score during the recovery stage .
in support of our findings , supplementation of dietary white and dark kidney beans as well as cranberry beans reduced colitis severity by reducing body weight loss , fecal blood score , and resultant dai score in dss - induced colitis mice [ 15,16 ] .
similarly , dietary supplementation of soybeans bowman - birk inhibitor concentrate reduced the severity of dss - colitis by suppressing inflammation in the colon and improving the recovery following dss - induction [ 14 ] .
dss causes mucosal and tissue damage in the mouse gut similar to the patterns of inflammatory responses observed in human uc [ 33,34 ] .
the activation and infiltration of inflammatory cells , including neutrophils and monocytes , is one of the common features in colitis , which is a complex process driven by cytokines , chemokines , and cell adhesion molecules [ 35 ] .
cytokines mediate neutrophil infiltration into the intestinal wall and mcp - 1 , highly expressed in colonic mucosa in ibd [ 36 ] , enhances the migration of neutrophils during chronic inflammation [ 23 ] .
in dss - induced colitis , westernized hfd - feeding enhanced neutrophil infiltration as indicated by enhanced myeloperoxidase activity [ 4 ] , and pea seed albumin extracts reduced inflammatory cell infiltration into the colon [ 17 ] .
in agreement , the current study found that dss - induction enhanced both the neutrophil infiltration and mcp - 1 expression in the colon of hfd - fed mice , which were mitigated by gp supplementation .
inline , dietary white and dark kidney beans , as well as cranberry bean supplements , reduced the mrna expression of mcp - 1 in the colon of dss - colitis mice [ 15,16 ] .
infiltrated neutrophils produce proinflammatory cytokines including il - 6 , il - 17 , and ifn - gamma , and enhance the expression of oxidative stress enzyme , inos , further aggravating colitis [ 28,33 ] .
ifn - gamma plays an important role in the development of dss - colitis , likely by activating and directing the leucocytes to the intestinal tissue [ 37 ] .
similarly , il - 17 stimulates epithelial cells to secrete il - 6 and helps cd34 + hematopoietic progenitors mature into neutrophils [ 38 ] .
in the current study , elevated levels of il - 6 , il - 17 , ifn - gamma , inos , and cox - 2 caused by dss - induction were ameliorated by gp supplementation in the colon of hfd - fed mice .
consistently , dietary white and dark kidney beans reduced the mrna expression of il - 6 [ 15 ] , and cranberry bean supplementation reduced the il - 6 protein in the colon along with reduced serum il - 6 , il - 17 , and ifn - gamma in dss - induced colitis [ 16 ] .
the down - regulation of inflammatory cascades and oxidative stress by gp supplementation can be partially explained by the low neutrophil infiltration into the colon of hfd - fed dss - colitis mice .
the lubricating layer of mucus that shields the epithelium from the gut luminal content predominantly consists of mucin 2 produced by goblet cells .
mucin 2 goes through heavy extensive translational modifications in the er and golgi complex , making it susceptible to misfolding , and thus activating the upr signaling [ 39 ] .
disturbance in the upr and er stress in intestinal epithelial cells induces chronic inflammation in ibd [ 24,25 ] .
missense mutations of the muc - 2 gene in winnie and eeyore mice increased er - stress - related mucin depletion , resulting in colitis [ 8 ] .
recently , gulhane and colleagues found that the hfd induced the expression of oxidative stress marker inos , and er - stress markers including upr signaling molecules xbp1 , er chaperone grp78 , and erad chaperone edem1 in the colon of winnie mice [ 7 ] .
on the other hand , dietary chickpea supplementation increased colon mucus content , mrna expression of muc - 2 , and differentiation marker klf4 with enhanced gut barrier integrity and reduced inflammation in healthy unchallenged mice [ 13 ] .
in dss - induced colitis , dietary white and dark kidney beans , as well as dietary cranberry bean supplementation , enhanced the mrna expression of muc - 2 and tff3 , and mitigated the severity of colitis and associated inflammation [ 15,16 ] .
consistent with these observations as well as improved colitis symptoms , gp supplementation improved both protein and gene expression of muc - 2 in hfd - fed dss - induced mice , associated with the enhanced expression of goblet cell differentiation markers in the colon .
further , atf - 6 and its downstream er - stress markers grp78 , chop , edem1 , and xbp1 [ 24,25 ] were reduced in hfd - fed mice by gp supplementation .
legumes such as chickpeas , kidney beans , and cranberry beans contain dietary fiber , resistant starches , protein , and polyphenolics with reported beneficial effect on intestinal health [ 13,15,16 ] .
the protein extract of soybeans and peas contains the active bowman - birk inhibitor that possesses anti - inflammatory activity and can reduce the severity of dss - colitis in mice [ 14,17 ] .
using the whole food approach , we were not able to conclude which bioactive component in gp was responsible for protection against dss - induced damages .
based on the previous investigations , the protective effect of gp can be attributed to the active bowman - birk inhibitor present in pea protein [ 14,17 ] and / or dietary fiber [ 12 ] .
dietary fiber in chickpea modulated the gut microbiota and enhanced scfa production , correlating with improved gut epithelial barrier function [ 13 ] .
these results suggested that gp might modulate gut microbiota to exert its protective effects on dss - induced colitis .
5. conclusions gp supplementation reduces the severity of dss - induced colitis in mice challenged with the hfd by reducing inflammation , mucosal loss , and the er - stress signaling .
gp possesses anti - inflammatory properties in dss - induced colitis in mice fed a hfd , and can be used as a potential dietary management to reduce risk of ibd development .

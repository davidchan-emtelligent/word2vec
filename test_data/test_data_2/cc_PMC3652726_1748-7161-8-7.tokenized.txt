the editor - in - chief and the medical editors at biomed central have retracted this article [ 1 ] because the first author did not fully declare his association with koob scolitech , which holds the rights in and to the spinealite ( tm ) brace and has filed for a patent for that brace .
furthermore , the direct association between koob scolitech and the spinealite ( tm ) brace was not made clear in the article .
this undeclared competing interest compromised the peer review process .

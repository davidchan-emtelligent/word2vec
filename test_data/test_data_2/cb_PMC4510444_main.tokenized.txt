1 experimental design as shown in fig. 1 , scfbetatrcp is a multi - subunit e3 ubiquitin ligase consisting of cul1 , rbx1 , skp1 , and the f - box protein betatrcp .
in mammals , two paralogs of betatrcp are present , i.e. betatrcp1 and betatrcp2 , however , their biochemical properties appear to be indistinguishable [ 1 ] .
for our experiments , three different constructs of betatrcp2 , each carrying n - terminal 2xflag and 2xha epitope tags were used for independent ap - ms experiments .
epitope tags alone , i.e. without any betatrcp2 - based fusion protein ( ev ) , were used as negative control .
the three betatrcp2 baits consist of betatrcp2 wild type and two betatrcp2 mutants , i.e. betatrcp2 - r447a and betatrcp2 - deltaf .
the first mutant , betatrcp2 - r447a , harbors an arg to ala mutation at position 447 of betatrcp2 .
this substitution within the wd40 beta - propeller domain abrogates the interaction with and consequently the ubiquitylation of scfbetatrcp substrates [ 3,4 ] .
the second mutant , betatrcp2 - deltaf , carries a deletion in the f - box motif and acts as a dominant negative mutant [ 5,6 ] since it binds substrates but is unable to interact with skp1 , cul1 , rbx1 and the e2 enzyme .
2 materials and methods 2.1 cell culture , transfection and drug treatment hek293t cells were cultured in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( invitrogen ) with 10 % fetal calf serum ( fcs ) and 100 u ml - 1 penicillin - streptomycin .
hek293t cells were transfected using the polyethylenimine ( pei ) method and , 48 h after transfection , treated with the proteasome inhibitor mg132 ( peptide institute , 10 mum ) for 5 h .
2.2 dna constructs full - length , human wild type betatrcp2 ( isoform c , np _ 036432.2 ) carrying ha and flag tags at the n - terminus was cloned into the ecori and noti sites of pcdna3 by pcr .
the full - length construct was then used as template to generate the betatrcp2 - r447a mutant using the quickchange site - directed mutagenesis kit ( stratagene ) according to manufacturer 's directions .
the following oligonucleotides were used : forward primer : 5 ' - gggacatgaagaattggtcgcatgcatccggtttgataacaag - 3 ' and reverse primer : 5 ' - cttgttatcaaaccggatgcatgcgaccaattcttcatgtccc - 3 ' .
all constructs were verified by sequencing .
2.3 betatrcp2 immunopurification hek293t cells grown in 15 - cm dishes were transfected with pcdna3 - 2xflag - 2xha - betatrcp2 and treated with 10 mum mg132 for 5 h. cells were harvested and subsequently lysed in lysis buffer ( 50 mm tris - hcl ph 7.5 , 150 mm nacl , 1 mm edta and 0.5 % np40 ) .
betatrcp2 was immunopurified with mouse anti - flag m2 coupled to an agarose resin ( sigma - aldrich ) .
after washing , proteins were eluted by competition with flag peptide ( sigma - aldrich ) .
the eluate was then subjected to a second immunopurification with anti - ha resin ( 12ca5 monoclonal antibody cross - linked to protein g sepharose ; invitrogen ) .
2.4 recovery of immunoprecipitated proteins for lc - msms for gelc - msms analysis , immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the protein g beads with laemmli sample buffer , separated by sds - page , and stained with coomassie colloidal blue .
twelve bands were sliced out from each gel lane which were then reduced , alkylated , and digested according to a published protocol [ 7 ] .
for direct lc - msms analysis , immunoprecipitated proteins on protein g beads were resuspended in a spin filter column ( bio - rad ) and washed three times with 200 mul of phosphate buffer saline to remove residual detergent from the lysis buffer .
proteins bound to the protein g beads were then eluted off with 100 mul of 0.5 % rapigest reagents ( waters ) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate , followed by 100 mul of 8 m urea in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate ( ph 8.0 ) .
eluted proteins were reduced with 1 mm dithiothreitol ( dtt ) and alkylated with 5.5 mm iodoacetamide .
for tryptic digestion , proteins were first digested with endoproteinase lys - c ( wako chemicals ) in room temperature for 4 h , followed by sequencing - grade modified trypsin ( promega ) overnight , after 4 - fold dilution with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate .
protease digestion was stopped by addition of trifluoroacetic acid ( tfa ) and precipitates were removed after centrifugation .
peptides were desalted using reversed - phase sep - pak c18 cartridges ( waters ) , then dried and stored at - 20 degreesc .
2.5 lc - msms for gelc - msms , we performed nanoflow lc - msms with an ltq - orbitrap discovery , orbitrap xl and orbitrap velos mass spectrometers ( thermo fisher ) coupled to an agilent 1200 hplc system ( agilent technologies ) .
digested peptides were dried , reconstituted in 10 % fa and delivered to a trap column ( aqua ( tm ) c18 , 5 microm ( phenomenex ) ; 20 mmx100 - microm inner diameter , packed in house ) at 5 microl / min in 100 % solvent a ( 0.1 m acetic acid in water ) .
next , peptides eluted from the trap column onto an analytical column ( reprosil - pur c18 - aq , 3 microm ; dr. maisch gmbh ; 40 cmx50 microm inner diameter , packed in house ) at 100 nl / min in a 1 h gradient from 0 to 40 % solvent b ( 0.1 m acetic acid in 8:2 ( v / v ) acetonitrile / water ) .
the eluent was sprayed via distal coated emitter tips butt - connected to the analytical column .
the mass spectrometer was operated in data - dependent mode , automatically switching between ms and msms .
full - scan ms spectra ( from m / z 300 to 1500 ) were acquired in the orbitrap with a resolution of 60,000 at m / z 400 after accumulation to target value of 500,000 in the linear ion trap .
the five most intense ions within a survey scan were selected for collision - induced fragmentation ( cid ) in the linear ion trap at a normalized collision energy of 35 % after accumulation to a target value of 10,000 .
for direct lc - msms , samples were analyzed with nano - uplc - msms on a proxeon easy - nlc 1000 ( thermo scientific ) connected to an ltq - orbitrap elite ( thermo fisher scientific ) .
the injected sample was first trapped with a double - fritted trapping column ( reprosil c18 , 3 mum , 2 cmx100 mum , dr. maisch gmbh ) before being separated in an analytical column ( agilent zorbax sb - c18 , 1.8 mum , 35 cmx50 mum ) .
solvent a consists of 0.1 m acetic acid while solvent b is 0.1 m acetic acid in 80 % acetonitrile .
measurement time for each sample took 120 min .
samples are first loaded at a maximum pressure of 980 bar with 100 % solvent a. subsequently , peptides are chromatographically separated by a 91 min gradient consisting of 15 - 40 % solvent b at an un - split flow of 100 nl / min ; then ramped to 100 % b in 3 min and held in 100 % b for another 2 min .
this is finally followed by a 13 - min equilibration with 100 % a. for ms analysis , 1.7 kv was applied to the nanospray needle .
the survey scan was from 350 to 1500 m / z at a resolution of 30,000 and for msms , the resolution was set to 7500 .
the 10 most intense precursors were selected for subsequent fragmentation using a direct dependent acquisition .
a decision tree method previously described was used [ 8,9 ] .
2.6 lc - msms data analysis ms raw files were analyzed using maxquant ( version 1.4.0.8 , http :// 141.61.102.17 / maxquant _ doku / doku.php ? id = start ) with the match between runs and lfq options selected .
tandem ms spectra , top 8 selected in 100 da bin , were searched against the uniprot human database ( version 2013 - 07 , 20,277 entries ) .
trypsin / p was chosen as the protease , cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification , and oxidation of methionine and acetylation of the n - terminal as variable modifications .
peptide tolerance was initially set to 20 ppm for first search and 4.5 ppm after recalibration , while msms tolerance was set to 0.5 da. all peptide - spectrum matches ( psms ) and proteins were validated with 1 % fdr .
only psms with a minimum length of 7 amino acids were kept .
2.7 post - acquisition data analysis crapome and perseus analysis the ' proteingroups.txt ' table generated by maxquant was filtered for contaminants and highly abundant proteins such as keratins , tubulins and ribosomal proteins , reverse hits , number of unique peptides (> 0 ) and number of peptides (> 1 ) .
subsequently , analysis and filtering using the crapome software suite ( www.crapome.org ) was performed essentially as described [ 10 ] .
to discriminate bona fide protein interactors of betatrcp2 from the background , we set a saint score threshold of 0.9 .
subsequently , to identify the putative substrates from this pool of specific interactors , we computed the ratios ( fc ratios ) for the fc - b scores between the wild type betatrcp2 or betatrcp2 - deltaf against the betatrcp2 - r447a mutant .
for the convenience of fc - ratio estimation , missing values in fc - b scores were imputed with a minimal value of 0.1 .
for analysis using the perseus software suite ( http :// 141.61.102.17 / perseus _ doku / doku.php ? id = start ) for identifying specific interactors of wild type betatrcp2 or betatrcp2 - deltaf against that of the betatrcp2 - r447a mutant , t - test - based statistics was applied on lfq [ 11 ] .
first , the lfq values were transformed to logarithm ( log 2 ) , and the resulting gaussian distribution of the data was used for imputation of missing values by normal distribution ( width = 0.3 , shift = 2.5 ) .
statistical outliers were then determined using a two - tailed t - test followed by multiple testing corrections with a permutation - based false discovery rate ( fdr ) method .
detailed results for crapome and perseus analyses have been published and are available as supplementary materials [ 1 ] and therefore will not be further described here .

appendix a supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at doi : 10.1016 / j.dib.2015.05.003. fig. 1 a schematic for scfbetatrcp .
scfbetatrcp is a multi - subunit e3 ubiquitin ligase consisting of cul1 , rbx1 , skp1 , and the f - box protein betatrcp .
cul1 is a scaffold protein that interacts via its n - terminus with the adapter protein skp1 and its c - terminus with the ring finger protein rbx1 .
rbx1 , in turn binds to a specific ubiquitin conjugating enzyme ( e2 ) .
skp1 also interacts with the f - box domain of betatrcp , which recruits substrates through its wd40 repeats .
these wd40 repeats form a beta - propeller structure , which specifically recognizes a diphosphorylated motif with the consensus motif dpsgxx ( x ) ps , known as a phosphodegron .

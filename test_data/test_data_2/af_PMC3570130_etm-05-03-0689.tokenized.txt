hydrogen sulfide ( h2s ) is a gaseous signaling molecule , which plays a critical role in a number of physiological and pathological progresses .
in order to determine the effect of endogenous h2s on gastric ischemia - reperfusion ( gi - r ) , we evaluated the gastric mucosal damage in rats intraperitoneally injected with dl - propargylglycine ( pag , 50 mg / kg / day ) or l - cysteine ( l - cys , 50 mg / kg / day ) for 7 days before gi - r. gi - r injury was achieved by clamping the celiac artery for 30 min , followed by reperfusion for 60 min .
gastric mucosal damage was macroscopically assessed in the area of injury and deep damage was assessed by histopathological scoring .
pag increased the area of gastric mucosal injury and deep damage compared with that in untreated gi - r rats ( p < 0.05 ) .
while pag decreased the h2s concentration and cystathionine gamma - lyase ( cse ) expression in the gastric mucosa , l - cys significantly attenuated the effects of gi - r. western blot analysis revealed that the increases of malondialdehyde ( mda ) and xanthine oxidase ( xod ) , and decreases of glutathione ( gsh ) , superoxide dismutase ( sod ) and the restriction of superoxide ( o2 - ) production in the pag group were inhibited by l - cys ( p < 0.05 ) .
endogenous h2s has a protective effect against gi - r in rats by inhibiting oxygen free radical overproduction .
gastric ischemia - reperfusion injury hydrogen sulfide oxidative stress dl - propargylglycine introduction reperfusion , the prompt restoration of the blood supply to the ischemic tissue , is the most effective way to reduce the process of ischemic injury , which ultimately leads to cell death .
however , reperfusion following even brief periods of ischemia causes irreversible damage , known as ischemia - reperfusion injury ( 1 ) .
although the mechanisms underlying ischemia - reperfusion injury are complicated , oxidative stress is considered to play a pivotal role .
hydrogen sulfide ( h2s ) was the third gaseous signaling molecule to be discovered , following nitric oxide and carbon monoxide ( 2 ) .
h2s is produced endogenously from cysteine by the pyridoxal - 5 ' - phosphate - dependent enzymes , cystathionine beta - synthase ( cbs ) and / or cystathionine gamma - lyase ( cse ) .
previously , a number of studies have suggested that h2s has anti - inflammatory , anti - oxidative and anti - apoptotic effects ( 3,4 ) .
h2s inhibits lipid peroxidation during heart ischemia - reperfusion and decreases the mortality of myocardial cells induced by ischemia by reducing oxygen free radicals ( 4 ) .
also , in brain ischemia - reperfusion injury , h2s exerts a protective effect on neurons by eliminating oxygen free radicals ( 5 ) .
studies have shown that h2s has protective effects on the heart , brain , liver and lung in the case of ischemia - reperfusion injury ( 6 - 9 ) .
in the gastrointestinal tract , it has been reported that the systemic administration of sodium hydrogen sulfide ( nahs ) , a h2s donor , attenuates gastric mucosal injury by downregulating mrna expression and plasma release of proinflammatory cytokines in rats ( 10 ) .
the protective effect of exogenously administered h2s and its precursors nahs and l - cysteine ( l - cys ) , has been shown against ischemia - reperfusion injury .
however , the potential of endogenous h2s has not yet been investigated .
the aim of this study was to investigate whether endogenous h2s plays a role in gastric ischemia - reperfusion ( gi - r ) injury .
we hypothesize that h2s plays an important role in the gastric mucosa under ischemia - reperfusion .
thus , we explored the effect of endogenous h2s on rat gi - r injury by pretreatment with dl - propargylglycine ( pag ) and l - cys to block cse and h2s synthetase and provide a precursor of h2s synthesis .

p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference .
results gastric mucosal injury the mucosal surface of the sham group was smooth and no significant abnormality in the gastric mucosa was observed under the light microscope .
however , significant hemorrhage and edema and several erosions of varying depths and sizes were observed on the surface of the mucosa of the gi - r group .
the epithelial cells and gland ducts of the mucosa at the hemorrhage sites were shed and disorganized in the gi - r group .
compared with the gi - r group , the injury area and the extent of mucosal damage significantly increased in the pag group and l - cys inhibited the damage induced by gi - r ( p < 0.05 ; fig. 1 ) .
under the light microscope , the gastric damage scores in the gi - r , pag and l - cys groups were much higher than those in the sham group ( p < 0.01 ) .
however , the damage score in the l - cys group was lower than those of the gi - r and pag groups ( p < 0.05 , fig. 2 ) .
h2s concentration in the serum and gastric mucosal tissue although there were no significant changes in h2s concentration in the serum ( fig. 3b ) , compared with the sham and gi - r groups , pag decreased the concentration of h2s in the gastric mucosa ( p < 0.05 ) and l - cys attenuated this decrease ( p < 0.05 ) .
however , there was no significant difference in h2s level in the gastric mucosa between the gi - r and sham groups ( fig. 3a ) .
cse expression in the gastric mucosa compared with the sham group , gi - r alone had no effect on cse expression .
pag significantly inhibited the expression of cse ( p < 0.01 ) and l - cys increased cse in the gastric mucosa to normal levels ( p < 0.01 ; fig. 4 ) .
mda and gsh contents in the gastric mucosa the mda content of the mucosa increased following gi - r ( p < 0.05 ) and further increased in the pag group .
however , l - cys decreased the concentration of mda in mucosa ( fig. 5a ) .
the gsh content in the mucosa decreased in the gi - r , pag and l - cys groups .
however , the reduction of gsh content in the l - cys group was less than that in the pag group ( p < 0.05 ; fig. 5b ) .
xod and sod expression , sod activity and inhibition of o2 - production in the gastric mucosa compared with the sham group ( p < 0.01 ; fig. 6a ) , the expression level of xod markedly increased in the gi - r and pag groups ; while the sod expression in the gi - r and pag groups decreased compared with the sham group ( p < 0.01 ; fig. 6b ) .
compared with the gi - r group , l - cys downregulated xod ( p < 0.01 ) and upregulated sod ( p < 0.01 ) .
additionally , the activity of sod was decreased in the gi - r and pag groups and the effects of gi - r were attenuated by l - cys ( p < 0.01 ; fig. 6c ) , as was the inhibition of o2 - production ( fig. 6d ) .
discussion the occurrence of gi - r injury is related to a number of factors , including excessive production of oxygen free radicals in the mucosa ( 14 ) , leukocyte infiltration ( 15 ) and decreased release of nitric oxide ( 16 ) .
oxidative stress induced by high levels of active oxygen plays a major role in gi - r injury .
excess production of oxygen free radicals is a major initiating factor and an independent pathogenic factor of gi - r injury ( 17,18 ) .
therefore , investigating how to decrease oxidative stress is essential for developing means of protecting the gastric mucosa from attack by deleterious factors .
h2s is well - known as a toxic gas with the smell of rotten eggs .
nevertheless , with the increasing interest in endogenous gaseous signaling molecules , it has been shown that endogenous h2s regulates a range of physiological and pathological processes in the nervous , digestive and cardiovascular systems ( 19 - 22 ) .
hence , h2s is considered to be a physiologically important molecule and a gaseous mediator .
in mammals , endogenous h2s is generated from l - cys under the catalysis of total cbs and cse , 1 / 3 of which is in the form of gas while 2 / 3 is in the form of nahs .
nahs dissociates in vivo into sodium ions and sulfhydryl group ions and the latter bind with hydrogen ions to generate h2s .
thus , h2s and nahs are in dynamic equilibrium ( 17 ) .
l - cys administration is cardioprotective through enhanced myocardial h2s generation as a result of cse activation , which is attenuated by the selective cse enzyme inhibitor , pag ( 23 ) .
meanwhile , h2s protects brain endothelial cells from oxidative stress ( 24 ) .
in this study , we identified that in rats pretreated with a h2s synthetase blocker ( pag , 50 mg / kg / day ) for 7 days , significant hemorrhage , edema and erosions were observed in the surface of the gastric mucosa , as well as in the gi - r group .
however , pretreatment with l - cys , the precursor of h2s , protected the mucosa from the damage induced by gi - r ( fig. 1 ) .
the same results were observed for gastric damage scores .
after blocking the production of h2s with pag , gastric mucosal ulceration and the number of hemorrhage sites significantly increased , a number of mucosal cells died , erosion sites formed and significant edema and inflammatory infiltration appeared in the submucosa .
the signs of gastric mucosal injury were markedly alleviated by the continuous administration of l - cys ( fig. 2 ) .
although there was no significant change in the h2s concentration in serum , pag successfully inhibited h2s production ( fig. 3 ) and cse expression ( fig. 4 ) in the gastric mucosa , while l - cys did not cause any evident change in h2s .
endogenous h2s in the gastric mucosa plays an important role in the protective effect against gi - r injury .
whiteman et al identified that in the rat brain , h2s protects neurons from injury by eliminating oxygen free radicals ( 5 ) .
a number of studies have reported that oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in gi - r injury .
in the gi - r process , lipid peroxidation is induced by an increased number of oxygen free radicals .
a change of mda content is a measure of the degree of damage caused by membrane lipid peroxidation .
in our study , when h2s was inhibited by pag , lipid peroxidation increased in the gastric mucosa since the mda content was higher than that of the gi - r group .
however , when h2s was increased , the mda level decreased ( fig. 5a ) .
this result is consistent with the findings on the effect of h2s on a rat model of myocardial infarction ( 25 ) .
furthermore , gsh is the major endogenous antioxidant produced by mammalian cells , preventing damage to important cellular components caused by reactive oxygen species ( 26 ) .
we identified that l - cys increased the gsh content when compared with the pag group ( fig. 5b ) .
when h2s production was blocked , mda levels increased .
additionally , increasing endogenous h2s production reduced mda content since gsh levels were enhanced .
this suggests that endogenous h2s protects the integrity of the gastric mucosa by increasing gsh and decreasing mda content .
this is consistent with the finding that h2s has anti - oxidative effects by promoting the transfer of cystine into cells and improving the cellular synthesis of gsh ( 27 ) .
the antioxidant action of h2s plays an important role during gi - r. during the reperfusion period following ischemia or hypoxia , large amounts of superoxide and o2 - are generated from xanthine and hypoxanthine under the action of xod .
xod is considered the most important source of oxygen free radicals ( 28 ) .
meanwhile , living tissues are endowed with innate antioxidant defense mechanisms , namely antioxidative enzymes .
when the amount of active oxygen exceeds the scavenging capacity of the antioxidant defensive system , including sod , the immunological function of the gastrointestinal tract is severely damaged by free radicals , which results in tissue and organ injury ( 29 ) .
in this study , we identified that blocking the synthesis of endogenous h2s significantly increased the expression of xod ( fig. 6a ) , causing oxygen free radical overproduction in the gastric mucosa .
nevertheless , the activity of the antioxidative enzyme , sod , was enhanced by increasing h2s in rats pretreated with l - cys ( fig. 6b and c ) .
as a result , the ability to inhibit o2 - production was clearly reduced due to the reduction of endogenous h2s by pag ( fig. 6d ) .
the protective role of h2s against oxidative stress has also been clarified in rat gastric mucosal epithelium ( 30 ) .
in conclusion , this study demonstrates that endogenous h2s protects the gastric mucosa against ischemia and reperfusion injury .
selective inhibition of the cse enzyme enhances the injury following gi - r. however , l - cys administration attenuates the harmful effects of gi - r through activation of cse to increase h2s generation .
the gastroprotective effect of endogenous h2s against gi - r may be mediated by enhancing the anti - oxidative capacity through increasing gsh and sod to reduce free radical production .

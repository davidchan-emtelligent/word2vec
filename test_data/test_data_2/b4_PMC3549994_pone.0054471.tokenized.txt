the minimal set of proteins necessary to maintain a vertebrate cell forms an interesting core of cellular machinery .
the known proteome of human red blood cell consists of about 1400 proteins .
we treated this protein complement of one of the simplest human cells as a model and asked the questions on its function and origins .
the proteome was mapped onto phylogenetic profiles , i.e. vectors of species possessing homologues of human proteins .
a novel clustering approach was devised , utilising similarity in the phylogenetic spread of homologues as distance measure .
the clustering based on phylogenetic profiles yielded several distinct protein classes differing in phylogenetic taxonomic spread , presumed evolutionary history and functional properties .
notably , small clusters of proteins common to vertebrates or metazoa and other multicellular eukaryotes involve biological functions specific to multicellular organisms , such as apoptosis or cell - cell signaling , respectively .
also , a eukaryote - specific cluster is identified , featuring gtp - ase signalling and ubiquitination .
another cluster , made up of proteins found in most organisms , including bacteria and archaea , involves basic molecular functions such as oxidation - reduction and glycolysis .
approximately one third of erythrocyte proteins do not fall in any of the clusters , reflecting the complexity of protein evolution in comparison to our simple model .
basically , the clustering obtained divides the proteome into old and new parts , the former originating from bacterial ancestors , the latter from inventions within multicellular eukaryotes .
thus , the model human cell proteome appears to be made up of protein sets distinct in their history and biological roles .
the current work shows that phylogenetic profiles concept allows protein clustering in a way relevant both to biological function and evolutionary history .

introduction human blood is composed of cells and plasma .
the most abundant cell is the erythrocyte , which lacks the nucleus in mammals , as opposed to all other vertebrates .
red blood cells are oval , red due to hemoglobin which occupies most of the cell ( 98 % of the overall cytoplasmic protein content ) and flexible to move freely through capillary vessels [ 1 ] .
specialization of the erythrocyte is visible in its extraordinary structure .
it is shaped like a biconcave disc and originates in the bone marrow where reticulocytes , first developmental stages of red blood cells , are produced .
until the end of its life span of 120 days , with 120 miles of travel and 1.7 105 circulatory cycles , the human rbc has successfully coped with a number of dangers , such as passages across narrow capillaries and splenic slits , periodic high turbulences and high shear stresses , along with extremely hypertonic conditions [ 2 ] .
the main function of erythrocytes is to transport oxygen and carbon dioxide .
additionally , these cells have been shown to play several key roles , like calcium and redox homeostasis [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , cell proliferation [ 5 ] , immunity [ 6 ] , ros production [ 7 ] and sugar transport [ 8 ] .
other vital roles of erythrocytes may be expected .
all these functions are related to proteins functional in a mature cell .
in recent works , authors have identified around 1900 erythrocyte proteins [ 9 ] .
except for hemoglobin , the proteins making up remaining 2 % of the erythrocyte proteome mass are involved in a plethora of functions in which protection of accumulated protein machinery from oxidative stresses seems to be central to preserve its life [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
recent work by d'alessandro and colleagues identifies about 50 molecular networks in red blood cells that in majority belong to the following categories : molecular transport , protein synthesis , cellular assembly and organization , post - translational modification and protein folding , cellular function and maintenance , protein degradation and cell death [ 9 ] .
here , we present an analysis in a somehow similar spirit , albeit dissecting the proteome along evolutionary lines .
the phylogenetic profile concept has been introduced by eisenberg and colleagues more than twenty years ago [ 11 ] .
basically , similar patterns of presence and absence of protein families in various organisms were shown to correspond to similar functions .
phylogenetic profiles have been employed in a number of studies , however , they were always used as an aid in further characterization of proteins , e.g. predicting protein - protein interactions and functional relationships such as in the prolinks and string servers [ 12 ] - [ 14 ] .
additionally , very recently a software package , prophylo , has been released designed to perform phylogenetic profiling studies [ 15 ] .
prophylo addresses the major issue in such studies , that is reliably achieving granularities in similarity matrix required to obtain representative protein clusters .
here , we approached the problem from a different angle .
we used the fruchterman - reingold graph - layout algorithm combined with a simple scoring system to identify evolutionary similarities in human red blood cell proteome .
in our work , we combine the proteomic and functional data with the evolutionary history of the erythrocyte proteome .
such a combination of diverse data sources allowed us to identify " young " and " old " sets of proteins in the red blood cell , which automatically separates " old " from " new " pathways in erythrocytes .
materials and methods data sources we have used a previously published comprehensive set of erythrocyte proteins as a starting point [ 9 ] .
this set was complemented with high - abundance erythrocyte proteins as listed in [ 16 ] .
while d'alessandro and colleagues [ 9 ] originally report over 1900 entities , we have found that less than 1500 gene identifiers could be reliably mapped to identifiers of universal protein resource ( uniprot ) at the time of conducting this study .
this discrepancy is partially a result of dynamics in biological data repositories - databases used by us in the course of this study were more recent than d'alessandro and co - workers had used .
additionally , a large number of entities in the above study referred to " groups " or " complexes " and as such were simply redundant .
construction of phylogenetic profiles for each of 1410 human erythrocyte proteins , three iterations of psi - blast sequence search [ 17 ] were performed on the refseq protein database ( version from march 2012 ) , using e - value threshold of 0.001 .
hits to protein sequences longer than 120 % of the query sequence , and those shorter than 80 % of the query sequence were discarded .
then , for each query protein , the phylogenetic profile was constructed : a vector l indexed by identifiers of selected species from the ncbi taxonomy database .
alternative approach that used orthologous groups relied on information provided by eggnog 2.0 database [ 18 ] .
its authors provided a mapper between uniprot identifiers and orthology groups .
calculation of phylogenetic profile similarity for two phylogenetic profiles , li and lj , a scalar product dji was calculated li * lj equal to the number of species common to the two profiles .
for two proteins , i and j , we define the similarity s ( i , j ) of their two profiles as follows.where n denotes length of vector l of the given phylogenetic profile .
python implementation of the algorithm the algorithm together with necessary scripts to automate psi - blast searches was implemented using the python package .
the source code and documentation are available at http :// github.com / agnmyk / simphypro .
it is worth noting that bitwise operations are preformed using python bitarray package .
in comparison to the solution where python dictionaries are used to represent information on taxon ids , utilizing bitwise operations resulted in a substantial gain in efficiency .
for a test set of 13000 proteins the processing time was reduced about ten times .
clustering of proteins using phylogenetic profile similarity similarity s was taken into account only for pairs of proteins for which shorter of phylogenetic vectors had a length of at least 60 % of the longer one .
this condition was introduced to avoid a situation in which natural connections between the majority of proteins ( coming from the fact they almost all are present in metazoa ) would result in lowering the resolution of the clustering .
the final analysis was performed using the clans software [ 19 ] .
the proteins were clustered using fruchterman - reingold graph - layout algorithm .
the picture of clusters was obtained using similarity threshold of 0.6 for clarity , however the clusters were defined using all pairwise similarities meeting the 60 % length requirement ( see above ) .
we used convex clustering method of clans software ( which groups all sequences with average sequence - to - cluster attractive forces better than 0.5 of standard deviation of the average attraction for the dataset ) to identify final clusters .
cluster analysis the functional analysis of clusters was performed using the david systems biology tools [ 20 ] .
for the statistical analysis of functional term enrichment , the full erythrocyte protein set was used as background .
several annotation sources were used , e , g , gene ontology , swissprot , kegg , interpro , pfam .
thus , functional annotations related to biological processes and molecular functions were considered together in the same manner .
the figure showing counts of erythrocyte proteins mapped onto taxonomic tree was obtained with itol service [ 21 ] .
venn diagram was obtained with venny tool [ 22 ] .
results clustering of the hrbc proteome by similarity of phylogenetic profiles out of 1410 human erythrocyte proteins , 1409 had at least one significant hit to a non - human protein in a blast sequence similarity search .
using phylogenetic profile similarity threshold equal to 0.6 ( see methods ) , a picture with seven distinct clusters and an unclustered " cloud " emerges ( see fig. 1 ) .
the seven clusters group in two " super - clusters " .
additionally , there are a few proteins that tend to connect clusters ( the effect is more pronounced when lower threshold of similarity score is used ) , however as the connections appear in the same order as the increase in average length of taxonomic hit vector per cluster , we consider them artifacts of the method .
summary of the clusters content ( number of proteins and overview of taxonomic distribution ) is presented in table 1 .

this is not surprising since long , multidomain proteins tend to occur more often in fewer organisms - mostly in the multicellular eukaryotes [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
when individual clusters are examined , they do differ in average protein length ( anova p - value below 0.0001 ) .
the cluster c , with average protein length above 600 residues , differs significantly in average protein length from the other clusters .
also , the unclustered cloud ( avg length above 500 residues ) differs significantly from clusters a , b , c , e and f ) .

then , not surprisingly , there are sharp differences between the phylogenetic clusters in terms of number of taxonomy hits ( anova p - value below 0.0001 , see fig. 3 ) .
cluster a proteins have usually a low number of hits , up to a few hundreds .
cluster c includes proteins with between 50 and 100 hits .
cluster d has a very low number of hits , below 50 .
cluster b includes only proteins with more than 1000 taxonomy hits .
the unclustered " cloud " contains proteins differing in hit number , from just a few up to more than one thousand .

red : cluster a , dark blue : cluster b , light blue : cluster c , yellow : cluster d , magenta : cluster e , green : cluster f , brown : cluster g , grey : unclustered cloud .
the clusters differ not only in the number of taxonomy hits but also , quite expectedly , in their phylogenetic spread ( see fig. 4 and fig. s1 ) .
most widespread are the cluster b proteins , including more than 14 % of the erythrocyte proteome , that are present in all eukaryotes , but also in all major bacterial groups , in archaea and in dsdna viruses .
second in line are cluster g proteins , just 1 % of the rbc proteome , present in most taxa , but almost absent from three out of five archaeal taxa ( nanoarcheota , thaumarcheota and koracheota ) , also almost absent from 8 out of 23 bacterial taxa ( e.g. dictyoglomi , tenericutes , elusimicrobia , gemmatimonadetes ) .
cluster f proteins , 2 % of the rbc proteome , are present in all archaea and most eukaryota ( excluding rhodophyta and jakobida ) , but absent from most bacterial taxa ( modest presence in proteobacteria , chlamydiae , actinobacteria and nitrospirae ) .
cluster e ( 1 %) is present throughout eukaryotes , in crenarcheota , and eurarcheota , and has a patchy distribution in bacteria ( similar to cluster f , with addition of cyanobacteria and chrysiogenetes ) .
cluster a ( as much as 38 % of the rbc proteome ) seems to be eukaryote - specific , but with minor presence in bacterial and archaeal taxons ( e.g. proteobacteria , cyanobacteria , chloroflexi , firmicutes , actinobacteria , eurarcheota ) .
cluster c ( 13 % of the rbc proteome ) appears to be metazoa - specific , but with minor presence in plants , amoebae , fungi , a few unicellular eukaryotic taxa , and in bacterial and archaeal taxons ( e.g. proteobacteria , cyanobacteria , eurarcheota ) .
cluster d ( 6 %) is by large vertebrate - specific , yet with some presence in echinoderms , hemichordates , arthropods and plants .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0054471.g004 figure 4 counts of erythrocyte proteins in phylogenetic clusters mapped onto taxonomic classification .
the classification has been shown up to a division / phylum level , except for metazoa which have been expanded to show differences between different classes of animals ( expanded to the equal level of depth ) and proteobacteria which have been expanded to include its classes .
red : cluster a , dark blue : cluster b , light blue : cluster c , yellow : cluster d , magenta : cluster e , green : cluster f , brown : cluster g , grey : unclustered cloud .
counts are normalized against cluster size .
the limitations of our clustering approach are reflected in the presence of the unclustered " cloud " including 26 % of the proteome .
an interesting separation is visible in the classification of viruses .
hrbc proteins from all clusters have a significant number of homologs in genomes of dsdna viruses ( especially clusters b and g , for which approx. half of cluster members have homologues in this virus group ) but almost none in dsrna , ssrna and retro - transcribing viruses .
to assess the depth of our approach , we attempted to reproduce the above analysis using orthologous groups instead of psi - blast searches as a basis for protein clustering .
however , not only a very small number of proteins could be mapped to orthologous groups ( in total we have obtained 368 groups from the initial set of 1410 proteins ) , but also phylogenetic depth of absolute majority of them , as reported by eggnog 2.0 [ 18 ] database , was very shallow .
only four groups had more than 10 species reported .
identification of an orthologous gene relies on the availability of complete genomes ( 630 are available in the eggnog 2.0 database ) , which limits the depth of the search compared to using all proteins from a database such as refseq .
functional analysis of the clusters the species hit by proteins from each cluster overlap to different extents ( see fig. 5 ) .
comparing four largest clusters in terms of number of proteins there are 2248 species specific to cluster b - these are mostly bacteria .
there is also a huge number ( 1667 ) of species common to two major clusters , a and b. also these are mostly bacterial species .
there are 128 species common to four major clusters , and these include mostly animals , but also a few plants and fungi .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0054471.g005 figure 5 venn diagram of species counts for the four largest ( in terms of the number of hrbc proteins ) clusters .
the proteins in the seven clusters are enriched in different functional annotations .
in the gene set enrichment approach ( see methods ) , the method itself treats the conceptually different biological process annotations and molecular function annotations in the same manner .
as expected , judging from the broad taxonomic spread , cluster b that is composed of proteins with very broad phylogenetic spread is involved in basic cellular functions while the other clusters , more focused in taxonomic spread , possess functions typical of multicellular organisms ( see table s1 ) .
the cluster b proteins , 14 % of the erythrocyte proteome , are present in all taxons , reflecting the most basic cellular machinery necessary for most living cells , e.g. processes such as glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism , molecular functions such as oxidoreductase activity , nucleotide binding ( see table s1 ) .
these proteins have sequence hits to more than 1000 species each .
the cluster c may be linked to multicellularity , and accordingly is enriched in molecular functions involving membrane proteins , and processes such as cell adhesion .
the vertebrate - specific cluster d is most likely made of proteins responsible for specific functions that evolved within this group .
it includes secreted proteins , ef - hand calcium binding proteins ( including the s100 family ) and apoptotic proteins ( albeit the significance of the latter is seen only before the multiple test correction ) .
the eukaryote - specific cluster a is enriched in proteins involved in biological processes such as protein transport , ubiquitination pathway , and gtpase signalling .
the relatively small and relatively ubiquitous clusters e , f and g are enriched in glutathione s - transferase domains , proteasome subunits , and wd40 repeats , respectively .
no significant enrichment of functional terms is seen for the unclustered cloud .
some more specific signalling pathways can be detected to be enriched within the clusters .
the cluster c ( multicellular eukaryotes : metazoa , plants ) is involved in cell movement , cell growth , cell development , and its specific pathways include the jak / stat signalling ( e.g. stat5b , stat6 molecules ) and the erbb pathway .
cluster a ( eukaryote - specific ) includes small gtpase signalling mediators , e.g. kras , rhob , map2k1 , map2k2 and mapk1 .
finally , the cluster d , with the narrowest species spectrum ( present only in vertebrates ) , includes apoptosis signalling mediators such as tnf , tradd , map3k1 and bmf .
functions of the proteins in the unclustered " cloud " do not reach high statistical significance .
another difference between the clusters can be gleaned by analysing disease - causing mutations , as included in the humsavar list in the uniprot database , www.uniprot.org .
mutations are not evenly distributed in the erythrocyte clusters ( see fig. 6 ) .
the erythrocyte proteome studied herein includes 54 proteins with " disease mutations. " cluster a ( eukaryote - specific ) , which makes up 38 % of the erythrocyte proteome , and includes 23 % of erythrocyte disease mutation proteins , has significantly fewer mutations than expected by chance ( binomial test p - value 0.007 ) .
cluster b ( ubiquitous ) , constituting 14 % of the proteome , has 25 % of disease mutation proteins , significantly more than expected by chance ( p - value 0.006 ) .
thus , the modest mutation sample available suggests that disease mutations are under - represented in the cluster specific to eukaryotic organisms while they tend to be overrepresented in the most common cluster that includes archaeal , bacterial and eukaryotic proteins .

discussion in this study , we separated the red blood cell proteins into biologically relevant clusters using a visual approach to clustering by phylogenetic similarity .
we obtained seven clear - cut clusters and a " cloud " of proteins whose phylogenetic profiles are specific .
the clusters do differ in their phylogenetic profiles .
some clusters are taxonomically very widespread ( cluster b ) while others are specific to a taxonomic branch ( e.g. the vertebrate - specific cluster d , metazoa - specific cluster c ) .
so , erythrocyte protein clusters are somehow " old " or " young " depending on their taxonomic distribution .
the clusters are over - represented with specific functions .
again , some functions are " older " and some seem to be acquired later in evolution .
the only clusters that may be in part related to red blood cell formation are the vertebrate cluster d and the metazoan cluster c. the most significant functional annotations elucidated in this work differ from those of d'alessandro and colleagues [ 9 ] since they performed an analysis involving the totality of the erythrocyte proteome against the full human proteome while we analysed separate clusters , defined phylogenetically , against the erythrocyte proteome background .
nevertheless , some of the top functional categories found in this work overlap with those of d'alessandro since the analysed protein sets were overlapping , and the software tool was conceptually similar ( ingenuity ipa and david ) .
for individual protein clusters , we did not observe prevalence of annotations from the conceptually different general annotation types , i.e. biological processes and of molecular function .
both biological processes and molecular function terms occurred for most clusters ( see table s1 ) .
this probably results from the difficulty of strict separation of the two annotation types , i.e. specific molecular annotations are often linked to specific processes .
the different clusters might be expected to reflect three evolutionary steps important for the evolution of erythrocyte : 1 ) formation of the eukaryotic cell , 2 ) appearance of blood and erythrocytes , 3 ) loss of nuclei in mammalian erythrocytes .
however , our phylogenetic profile clustering method too coarse - grained to capture exactly that level of detail .
the chimeric origin of eukaryotes is not captured precisely by the clustering .
yet , it is to some degree reflected in the cluster b with the largest taxonomic spectrum ( bacteria , archaea , eukaryotes ) , where proteins do have both information - processing and metabolic ( operational ) functions , as expected for archaeal and bacterial origins , respectively [ 25 ] .
cluster f , which contains eukaryotic and archaeal proteins represents the known evolutionary history of proteasome .
cluster a , which contains mostly eukaryotic proteins , could correspond to establishing major metabolic constituents of a eukaryotic cell .
cluster c , having a narrower spectrum of higher eukaryotic species , mostly metazoan , could correspond to the step of establishing tissues. and finally , cluster d , almost exclusive to chordata could be linked functionally to erythropoiesis and occurrence of blood .
the clusters identified do not allow to trace recent evolution of erythrocytes ( loss of nuclei in mammals ) , probably because the starting point of the analysis was erythrocyte itself , i.e. an already " truncated " version of the cell ( no nucleus ) .
the 28 % of erythrocyte proteins are unclustered in our approach .
this is a substantial part of the proteome .
an example of these unclustered proteins are hemoglobins .
the ancestral gene for hemoglobin is ancient and its products served many different roles in the history , freed from evolutionary pressure by gene duplication and whole genome duplication .
thus , hemoglobins , and many other proteins in the unclustered cloud represent a set of genes with highly complex history .
their separation ( presence outside of any cluster ) indicates that there is very little in common between these proteins .
they might be an interesting set of proteins to analyze individually .
the cluster a has significantly fewer than expected disease - linked mutations in its genes , which is logical considering the functions crucial for eukaryotic life .
conversely , the most widespread cluster b including proteins common to all forms of life has over - representation of disease mutations , consistent with its functions involving basic cell metabolism .
construction of phylogenetic profiles based on refseq database leads to a significant noise in the profile .
for example , we have found that e. coli proteins were spread across 60 different taxonomy ids .
at first , it seems that our approach is not reliable enough , compared to careful construction of phylomes .
however , as we show in this study , the graph layout approach employed using clans software provides enough granularity to efficiently cluster proteins of a single cell , based on presence of homologous proteins across proteomes .
clustering based on orthology is not powerful enough because it relies on the availability of fully sequenced genomes and these data always lag behind draft genomes or partially sequenced organisms .
on the other hand , our method is only efficient for coarse - grained evolutionary steps description .
as clusters are perfectly separated , relations between clusters ( other than distances ) are missing , therefore relatively recent or very old changes , captured perfectly by other methods , might be missing from our analysis .
as such , our approach might be a complement to more fine - grained methods , for which clustering based on phylogenetic profiles could provide a noise - resistant starting point .

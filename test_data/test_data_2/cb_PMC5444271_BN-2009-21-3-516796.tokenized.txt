the aim of this investigation was to evaluate improvement of executive functions after shunt surgery in patients with early normal pressure hydrocephalus ( nph ) .
patients with nph were assessed before and after shunt surgery with tests shown to be sensitive to damage to the prefrontal cortex ( pfc ) .
significant differences were found between basal and follow - up performances on the boston naming test , the backwards digits span , part b of the trail making test , and the number of words produced on the phonological fluency task .
in conclusion , our study reveals that patients with nph who respond positively to continuous slow lumbar cerebral spinal fluid drainage and receive a ventriculoperitoneal shunt implant , improve their performance on tasks of executive function .
due to the high demand for this form of mental processing in real - life complex scenarios , and based on the severe executive deficits present in both demented and non - demented nph patients , we encourage the assessment of executive functions in this clinical group .

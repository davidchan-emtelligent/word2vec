background idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( itp ) is an autoimmune disease in which the platelet count falls to < 100 x 109 / l. corticosteroids are recommended as the first - line treatment , splenectomy is recommended as the second - line treatment , and thrombopoietin receptor agonists ( tpo - ras ) and rituximab are recommended as the third - line treatments for itp in japanese itp treatment guidelines .
however , in japan , rituximab is not eligible for reimbursement for the treatment of itp .
the cost - effectiveness of itp treatment has not been investigated in japan .
therefore , in this study , the cost - effectiveness of adding rituximab treatment to the existing treatments indicated for itp in japan , namely splenectomy and the tpo - ra romiplostim , was investigated based on the scenario that rituximab is eligible for reimbursement in japan as a treatment for itp .
methods the efficacy endpoint was set as the number of years with a platelet count >= 30 x 109 / l. the analysis was conducted from the healthcare payer 's perspective .
if the first treatment is ineffective or relapse occurs , then the patient is given the following treatment .
the analyzed treatment order consisted of three patterns : splenectomy - romiplostim ( sequence 1 ) , splenectomy - romiplostim - rituximab ( sequence 2 ) , and splenectomy - rituximab - romiplostim ( sequence 3 ) .
a markov model was built for itp , and the analysis period was set as 2 years .
the discount rate was an annual rate of 2 % .
sensitivity analyses of the efficacy of splenectomy , romiplostim , and rituximab ; treatment cost ; and romiplostim dose were performed .
results the expected costs per patient over a 2 - year period for sequences 1 , 2 , and 3 were usd 40,980 , usd 39,822 , and usd 33,551 , respectively .
the expected years with a platelet count >= 30 x 109 / l for the three sequences were 1.75 , 1.79 , and 1.78 years , respectively .
the sensitivity analyses illustrated that the results of the base case analysis were robust .
conclusions adding rituximab to standard treatment for itp ( sequences 2 - 3 ) is less costly and marginally more effective than standard therapy in adults .
according to the study results , if rituximab is reimbursed for the treatment of itp in japan , medical expenses are expected to decline .
keywords itp splenectomy romiplostim rituximab cost - effectiveness issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( itp ) is an autoimmune disease in which the platelet count falls to < 100 x 109 / l. there are approximately 20,000 patients with this disorder in japan , and it is reported that approximately 3,000 people develop this disorder every year .
the pathology of the disorder involves destruction of autoantibody - presenting platelets by the spleen and liver , and insufficient hematopoiesis of megakaryocytes is also observed because of the relative shortage of the megakaryocyte hematopoietic factor thrombopoietin .
itp is classified based on the length of time from the diagnosis as follows : newly diagnosed , < 3 months ; persistent , between 3 and 12 months ; and chronic , > 12 months .
ninety percent of patients with adult - onset itp have chronic disease , and the male - to - female ratio is 1:2 .
approximately 10 % of all patients with itp do not respond to standard treatment , and cases in which the platelet count falls to < 30 x 109 / l are considered intractable .
the mortality rate of patients with itp is 4.2 - fold higher than that of healthy individuals [ 1 ] .
however , opportunities to select immunosuppressive agents have declined because of the current availability of rituximab and thrombopoietin receptor agonists ( tpo - ras ) , and it is possible that the risk of death , even if the platelet count is < 30 x 109 / l , is no longer 4.2 - fold higher than that of healthy individuals .
the japanese itp treatment guidelines are as follows .
patients with itp who are infected with helicobacter pylori first receive h. pylori eradication therapy [ 2 ] , which recovers the platelet count to 100 x 109 / l in approximately half of all patients .
however , when h. pylori eradication therapy is ineffective or patients are not infected with h. pylori , corticosteroid treatment is the first - line treatment option , and this treatment is highly effective .
however , only 10 % - 20 % of all patients can discontinue corticosteroid administration , and most patients require long - term corticosteroid treatment in japan .
this long - term corticosteroid treatment is significantly problematic clinically because it causes side effects such as diabetes , hypertension , peptic ulcers , and immunodeficiency .
when corticosteroids are ineffective or there are problems with tolerability , a splenectomy is the second - line treatment option .
the efficacy rate of splenectomy is reported to be approximately 60 % , although relapses are also reported [ 3 ] .
the drawbacks of splenectomy are risks such as perioperative complications experienced by 10 % of subjects , the mortality rate of 1 % associated with the laparotomic portion of the procedure , the mortality rate of 0.2 % associated with laparoscopic surgery , and severe infection because of postoperative immunodeficiency [ 1,3 ] .
patients for whom the splenectomy was ineffective or who are not candidates for surgery can receive third - line treatment with the anabolic steroid danazol , the immunosuppressants azathioprine and cyclosporine , the anticancer agents vincristine and cyclophosphamide , the tpo - ras romiplostim and eltrombopag , and the anti - cd20 monoclonal antibody rituximab .
among the third - line treatment options , only tpo - ras are covered by health insurance in japan , and romiplostim and eltrombopag were approved after 2011 .
tpo - ras are effective in approximately 60 % - 90 % of intractable cases ; however , once treatment is discontinued , the platelet count decreases to the pre - treatment level within 2 weeks [ 4 - 6 ] .
this demands long - term treatment , which places financial pressure on the patient because of high drug costs .
it was recently reported that some patients do not experience a relapse after tpo - ra discontinuation .
however , further investigation via a larger - scale , longer - term observational study is required because these data were obtained from a short - term observational study involving a small number of subjects. by contrast , another third - line treatment option , rituximab , basically requires only four doses administered at weekly intervals , and the patient can expect a radical cure ; thus , this drug is less expensive than tpo - ras .
in a systematic review of the curative effect of rituximab targeting approximately 300 patients with itp , it was reported that the platelet count exceeded 50 x 109 / l in 62.5 % of patients [ 7 ] .
the median response duration is limited ; after 5 years , 20 % - 25 % of patients have sufficient platelet counts [ 7 ] .
rituximab is described as a second - line treatment option for intractable itp in the american guidelines [ 5 ] .
however , in japan , there are few records of the use of rituximab for treating itp ; therefore , it is not indicated for itp , and it is currently used off - label [ 8 ] .
itp was specified as an intractable disease in 1974 in japan , and some patients are eligible for public financial support from the national and prefectural governments .
however , drugs such as rituximab that are not indicated for itp are neither eligible for public financial assistance nor are they covered by insurance .
the reality is that these drugs are used off - label to save the lives of patients with intractable itp .
at this juncture , clinical trials are currently underway under the assumption that rituximab is eligible for reimbursement in japan as a treatment for itp .
recently , there has been increased interest in japan in the evaluation of medical economy , with investigations into the introduction of the health technology assessment ( hta ) by the central social insurance medical council .
however , the cost - effectiveness of itp treatment has not been investigated in japan .
there are reports overseas that investigated the cost - effectiveness of tpo - ra with standard itp treatments , including rituximab [ 9 - 11 ] , but there are no reports that investigated the cost - effectiveness of splenectomy followed by romiplostim ( sequence 1 ) and splenectomy - romiplostim plus rituximab ( sequences 2 - 3 ) .
in this study , based on the scenario that rituximab is eligible for reimbursement in japan as a treatment for itp , we investigated the cost - effectiveness of adding rituximab to splenectomy and the tpo - ra romiplostim .
methods the aim of this study was to clarify the cost - effectiveness of adding rituximab to conventional treatments for itp in adults , namely splenectomy and romiplostim .
a markov model was built for itp , and the analysis period was set at 2 years .
the efficacy endpoint was the number of years with a platelet count >= 30 x 109 / l : the level required to prevent life - threatening blood loss .
the costs were set as the direct medical costs .
the analysis was conducted from the healthcare payer 's perspective .
all costs are shown in us dollars .
treatment option a typical adult patient with intractable itp for whom the first treatment option of corticosteroids is ineffective was set as a target japanese woman of 50 years of age , 60 kg in weight , and 160 cm in height .
in accordance with the japanese itp treatment guidelines , a patient with intractable itp who is non - responsive to corticosteroids undergoes splenectomy .
if the splenectomy is ineffective or relapse occurs , then the patient is switched to romiplostim or rituximab treatment .
furthermore , if romiplostim is ineffective , then the patient is switched to rituximab , and if rituximab is ineffective , the patient is then switched to romiplostim .
if splenectomy , romiplostim , and rituximab are all ineffective or relapse occurs , then the patient is switched to maintenance therapy using corticosteroids .
because this study targeted patients with intractable itp , the analysis started with the second - line treatment option of splenectomy .
therefore , the analyzed treatment order consisted of three patterns as follows : splenectomy - romiplostim ( sequence 1 ) , splenectomy - romiplostim - rituximab ( sequence 2 ) , and splenectomy - rituximab - romiplostim ( sequence 3 ) ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 analyzed treatment order for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura .
prior to undergoing splenectomy , the patient is administered five doses of 0.4 g / kg ivig as an outpatient therapy to adequately increase the platelet count , and the splenectomy is performed during a 7 - day hospitalization .
at present , two tpo - ras are indicated for treating itp in japan , and for this study , we conducted a simulation using one of those products , romiplostim .
romiplostim is an injectable treatment that is administered at 1 - 10 mug / kg body weight per week .
the dose will be titrated individually , and in some patients , it is possible to use a much lower dose than the licensed dose .
the dose in this study was 4 mug / kg based on the results of long - term continuation tests in japanese patients ; therefore , a dose of 240 mug was calculated for a 60 - kg patient .
one vial of romiplostim contains 250 mug of the drug .
therefore , one vial is used per dose , assuming that the remainder would be discarded [ 12 ] .
a single dose of rituximab was set at 375 mg / m2 , and it was assumed that a total of four doses would be administered at weekly intervals .
the initial dose of rituximab requires the patient to stay in the hospital overnight , whereas the remaining three doses are administered in the outpatient setting .
assuming that sepsis would occur during the splenectomy and rituximab treatment period as well as after treatment , any affected patient would be hospitalized for treatment [ 7,13 ] .
concerning the romiplostim treatment period , pulmonary embolism was assumed as the adverse event , and any affected patient would be hospitalized for treatment [ 14 ] .
emergency treatment for exacerbation of itp symptoms such as a rapid decline in the platelet count and hemorrhage involved hospitalization and ivig administration .
if the platelet count does not reach or exceed 30 x 109 / l after splenectomy , romiplostim , and rituximab treatment , corticosteroids ( 20 mg / day ) was administered as a maintenance therapy .
model design we created a model of the typical clinical course of itp using a markov model based on the advice of itp specialists ( figure 2 ) .
one cycle consisted of 4 weeks based on a report that investigated the cost - effectiveness of romiplostim [ 11 ] .
the response time was set in reference to the american guidelines for itp [ 5 ] .
the transfer rates to each of the disease states were summarized based on academic reports and specialists' opinions .
" effective " was defined as a platelet count >= 30 x 109 / l after treatment .
" relapse " was defined as a platelet count >= 30 x 109 / l after treatment that subsequently declined to 30 x 109 / l. figure 2 structure of the model .
ae : adverse event , pl : platelet , sp : splenectomy , ro : romiplostim , ri : rituximab .
the model is composed of six states .
each cycle was a 28 - day period .
the cycle starts from the idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( itp ) treatment state ( pl < 30 x 109 / l ) and moves to the next state after 28 days .
however , if pl remains < 30 x 109 / l after the treatment , the cycle remains at the itp treatment state .
the broken line shows the flow of patients treated with splenectomy and rituximab , i.e. , patients who received treatments other than romiplostim .
the model was created based on the following assumptions .
if splenectomy and rituximab treatment are effective , then there is no subsequent treatment .
if the treatment is ineffective or the patient relapses , the patient is then switched to the following treatment .
assuming that the adverse event during the perioperative period of splenectomy and rituximab administration or after these treatments was sepsis , the patient would receive the treatment for sepsis for 4 weeks , after which the original treatment would be resumed .
if romiplostim treatment is effective , then the patient would continue this treatment .
if the treatment is ineffective , the patient would then be switched to the following treatment .
if pulmonary embolism occurred during romiplostim treatment , the patient would discontinue treatment with romiplostim and receive 4 weeks of treatment for the pulmonary embolism .
if emergency treatment is required because of exacerbation of itp symptoms in any of the treatment groups , the patient would be hospitalized for 4 weeks and administered ivig , after which the original treatment would be resumed .
if no effect is observed after treatment with splenectomy , romiplostim , and rituximab or if relapse occurs , the patient would then receive maintenance therapy with corticosteroids .
however , because this study targeted intractable itp that was non - responsive to corticosteroids , the platelet count would remain at < 30 x 109 / l even after corticosteroid administration .
the adverse event assumed to occur during corticosteroid maintenance therapy was diabetes , and if diabetes occurred , corticosteroid maintenance therapy would be continued while also administering diabetes treatment .
model inputs the efficacy rates , relapse rates , and incidence of adverse events obtained from the literature are presented in table 1 .
these rates were used as the transfer rates between the states .

discussion this study created an independent model in which the standard platelet count used for the endpoint was set at 30 x 109 / l , with states including hemorrhage and adverse events .
using this model , we examined the cost - effectiveness of itp treatment in which rituximab , for which clinical trials are underway to support approval for this indication in japan , is added to splenectomy and the tpo - ra romiplostim , which are currently indicated for the treatment of itp in japan .
the treatment costs associated with itp treatment have been reported mainly for ivig and splenectomy .
however , there are few reports that investigated the cost - effectiveness of itp treatment with a markov model .
in the reports that investigated the cost - effectiveness of itp treatment , the cost - effectiveness of ivig was compared with that of corticosteroids [ 23 ] , or the cost - effectiveness of standard treatment including rituximab was compared with that of a combination of standard treatment and romiplostim [ 9,11 ] .
the following points can be highlighted as unique to our analyses .
first , this study examined the cost - effectiveness of only 3 treatments : splenectomy , romiplostim , and rituximab .
in the japanese guidelines , danazol , azathioprine , and cyclophosphamide are recommended as third - line treatment options , in addition to tpo - ras and rituximab .
however , we considered that the american guidelines for itp [ 5 ] recommend only splenectomy , tpo - ras and rituximab as second - line treatment options , and tpo - ras represent the only third - line treatment option covered by medical insurance in the japanese guidelines .
in addition , clinical trials of rituximab are underway to support the approval of the drug for treating itp in japan .
second , in previous studies , effectiveness was defined as achieving a platelet count >= 50 x 109 / l , whereas in this study , the evaluation endpoint was set as the number of years with a platelet count >= 30 x 109 / l. because rituximab is recommended in the american guidelines for itp [ 5 ] when the platelet count falls below 30 x 109 / l , which also increases the risk of death or hemorrhage , we considered that the endpoint should be set as a platelet count of 30 x 109 / l. third , several previous studies only considered hemorrhage as an adverse event , whereas we evaluated the adverse events that are expected to have a significant effect on the cost - effectiveness in each treatment based on specialists' opinions and the literature .
fourth , in the application data of romiplostim for nice , the study was conducted on the premise that the efficacy of romiplostim differs before and after splenectomy [ 9,10 ] .
however , the mechanism of a difference in the efficacy of romiplostim before and after splenectomy is not clear , and this difference may arise from the different durations of disease prior to the start of romiplostim treatment ; thus , in this study , the analysis was conducted assuming that the efficacy of romiplostim was the same before and after splenectomy .
this study demonstrated that adding rituximab to splenectomy - romiplostim ( sequence 1 ) reduces the treatment cost over a 2 - year period , extends the period with a platelet count >= 30 x 109 / l , reduces the number of deaths , and reduces the number of patients manifesting adverse events as well as those requiring emergency treatment ( table 3 ) .
the reductions in the numbers of deaths , patients manifesting adverse events , and patients requiring emergency treatment is probably because the shortened length of time for the platelet count falls to < 30 x 109 / l by adding rituximab compared to those of splenectomy and romiplostim alone .
the reduction in cost is largely related to the fact that although some patients relapsed , patients who achieved a complete cure and required no further treatment were by no means rare .
the application data for eltrombopag for nice indicated that treatment in the order of rituximab - - > eltrombopag - - > romiplostim - - > ivig is cost - effective [ 10 ] .
mowatt et al. reported that the administration of rituximab prior to standard treatment is cost - effective [ 9 ] .
this information is consistent with the results of this study , in which the cost - effectiveness ratio of splenectomy - rituximab - romiplostim ( sequence 3 ) was lower than that of splenectomy - romiplostim - rituximab ( sequence 2 ) .
however , the numbers of deaths and adverse events for sequence 2 were lower than those for sequence 3 .
therefore , further long - term investigation using quality - adjusted life years ( qaly ) is needed to determine whether sequence 2 or 3 is more cost - effective .
the results of the sensitivity analysis illustrated that the efficacy of splenectomy had the most significant effect on the difference in the cost - effectiveness ratio between sequences 1 and 2 .
this is probably because the reduction in the efficacy of splenectomy increases the number of subjects who move to maintenance therapy , which results in an increased number of patients who require emergency treatment in sequence 1 .
the efficacy of splenectomy and the romiplostim dose significantly affected the difference in cost - effectiveness ratios between sequences 1 and 3 .
regarding the romiplostim dose , it is considered that more subjects were administered romiplostim in sequence 1 than in sequence 3 , which had a marked effect on the cost because of the increased romiplostim dose and resulted in a larger difference in the cost - effectiveness ratios between the sequences .
it is possible that the mortality rate , even if the platelet count is < 30 x 109 / l , is no longer 4.2 - fold higher than that of the healthy population because the referred mortality rate was determined prior to the availability of rituximab and romiplostim .
therefore , assuming that the mortality rate was 2.1 - fold higher than that in healthy individuals , which is half of the mortality rate of the base analysis , we conducted the sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of the mortality rate .
the mortality rate did not have great influence on the base case analysis .
the first limitation of this study was that we did not use utility .
this is because there are no reports on utility in cases of complications with itp or relapse , although one study used utility with the presence or absence of hemorrhage and another report mapped sf36 to sf - 6d [ 9,10 ] .
therefore , we did not determine whether sequence 2 or 3 is more cost - effective in this study .
we would like to accumulate data on utility for patients with itp who developed complications .
second , the analysis period was 2 years , which did not reflect long - term drug use .
similar to this study , cost - effectiveness according to the order of treatment was analyzed in the application data to nice for eltrombopag , and the analysis period in this study was 2 years [ 10 ] .
in this study , we used a 2 - year analysis period in reference to this previous study .
it should be noted that although the analysis period in previous cost - effectiveness analysis of romiplostim was a lifetime , we did not use this because safety concerns such as the development of bone marrow fibrosis remains regarding the long - term use of tpo - ras .
third , the efficacy rates of rituximab and splenectomy and the rate of relapse in this study were cited from foreign reports .
however , clinical trials of rituximab are underway in japan , and we plan to use domestic data for investigations as soon as the results become available .
fourth , eltrombopag is another tpo - ra approved in japan in addition to romiplostim , but we selected romiplostim in this study because eltrombopag was not recommended by nice in the uk once .
the efficacy , cost , and administration methods of romiplostim are different from those of eltrombopag .
therefore , we conducted sensitivity analyses of the efficacy and cost of romiplostim .
however , the results of the base case analysis were robust .
fifth , we assumed that when rituximab or splenectomy was effective , no further treatment would be undertaken .
however , itp therapeutic agents including corticosteroids are continuously administered in some cases .
we also assumed that romiplostim was administered as a monotherapy , but in fact , other drugs such as corticosteroids are sometimes used in combination .
in this study , however , we assumed no treatment considering the state in which the concomitant use of corticosteroids is avoided as much as possible because of its adverse events .
sixth , the actual maintenance therapy depends on a variety of factors .
however , we assumed that steroid therapy would be administered as the maintenance therapy when none of the treatments such as splenectomy , romiplostim , and rituximab was effective or relapse occurred .
we selected the treatment based on the relevant guidelines and specialists' opinions .
conclusions the expected costs per patient over a 2 - year period for sequences 2 and 3 were lower than those for sequence 1 .
the expected number of years with a platelet count >= 30 x 109 / l was greater for sequences 2 and 3 than for sequence 1 .
based on these results , the addition of rituximab ( sequences 2 - 3 ) results in lower treatment costs and greater efficacy compared to that of standard treatment for itp in adults .
according to the study results , if rituximab is reimbursed for the treatment itp in japan , medical expenses will be reduced .

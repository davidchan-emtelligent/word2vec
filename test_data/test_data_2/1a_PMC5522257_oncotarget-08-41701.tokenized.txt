dynamins and their related proteins participate in the regulation of neurotransmission , antigen presentation , receptor internalization , growth factor signalling , nutrient uptake , and pathogen infection .
recently , emerging findings have shown dynamin proteins can also contribute to the genesis of cancer .
this up - to - date review herein focuses on the functionality of dynamin in cancer development .
dynamin 1 and 2 both enhance cancer cell proliferation , tumor invasion and metastasis , whereas dynamin 3 has tumor suppression role .
antisense rnas encoded on the dna strand opposite a dynamin gene regulate the function of dynamin , and manipulate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes .
certain dynamin - related proteins are also upregulated in distinct cancer conditions , resulting in apoptotic resistance , cell migration and poor prognosis .
altogether , dynamins are potential biomarkers as well as representing promising novel therapeutic targets for cancer treatment .
this study also summarizes the current available dynamin - targeted therapeutics and suggests the potential strategy based on signalling pathways involved , providing important information to aid the future development of novel cancer therapeutics by targeting these dynamin family members .
endocytosis tumor cancer target clathrin amphiphysin introduction cancer is associated with features of dysregulated cell proliferation and increased migration of tumor cells , resulting in aggressive cell invasion and metastatic disorders .
dysregulation of endocytosis in cancer cells alters cell surface expression of critical molecules , leading to the dysfunction of cell signaling , migration , survival and proliferation .
endocytosis is critical for maintaining neurotransmission , antigen presentation , receptor internalization , growth factors signalling , nutrient uptake , and pathogen infection .
in many cell types , multiple endocytotic pathways exist which differ in the proteins utilised and molecules endocytosed [ 1 ] .
dynamins support endocytosis by either clathrin - dependent or - independent mechanisms [ 1 , 2 ] .
in the case of receptor - mediated endocytosis , dynamins , clathrin , clathrin adaptor proteins ( i.e. adaptor protein complex ) as well as amphiphysins are essential .
during endocytosis , receptor binding is mediated by clathrin adaptors that can bind directly to both clathrin and the lipid and / or protein components of membranes .
clathrin forms a triskelion shape composed of three clathrin heavy chains and three light chains , which is the assembly unit of a clathrin coated pit [ 3 ] .
not all the endocytosis requires clathrin , for example , in quiescent nerve endings a slow endocytosis can occur independent of dynamin and clathrin , however , in an intense stimulation condition , a fast endocytosis can occur as stimulation recruits dynamin , clathrin , clathrin adaptor protein 2 ( ap2 ) complex , and amphiphysin to increase protein internalization ( figure 1 ) .
moreover , numerous studies have shown that dynamin - independent and - dependent membrane recycling are independent processes linked to spontaneous and evoked exocytosis , respectively [ 4 ] .
figure 1 schematic diagram for resting and stimulated receptor - mediated endocytosis in neurons and differential involvement of dynamin isoforms in stimulated receptor - mediated endocytosis using a molecular probe , such as botulinum neurotoxin ( bont ) which cleaves snare proteins , to dissect the path of receptor - mediated endocytosis [ 115 ] , it was revealed that resting uptake by neurons occurs via lipid rafts , acidified compartments and protein acceptors but not dynamin .
in contrast , stimulated endocytosis of bont by neurons utilises lipid rafts , acidified compartments ( vacuolar - type h + - atpase ) and dynamin and amphiphysin [ 4 ] .
in terms of fast recycling of small clear synaptic vesicles , cerebellar granule neurons ( cgns ) use predominantly dynamin 1 , whereas isoform 2 and , to a lesser extent , isoform 3 to support a less rapid mode of stimulated endocytosis .
in contrast , large dense - cored vesicle ( ldcv ) - releasing trigeminal ganglionic neurons ( tgns ) preferentially employ dynamins 2 and 3 and amphiphysin 1 for evoked endocytosis .
pm = plasma membrane , v - h + = vacuolar - type h + , ccp = clathrin coated pit , cme = clathrin mediated endocytosis .
therapeutic potential of dynamin isoforms dynamins are large gtpase , encoded by three genes in mammals , required for vesicle recycling and membrane fission .
dynamins can be directed by amphiphysins to sites of endocytosis [ 5 , 6 ] , where they form a helix around the neck of the invaginated coated pit .
they can self - assemble to form ring or helix - like structures around the neck of the vesicle and play an essential role in scission of the invaginated vesicles during membrane fission ( figure 1 ) .
three conventional mammalian dynamin genes ( dnm1 , dnm2 and dnm3 ) encode proteins that are ~ 80 % homologous [ 4 ] .
dynamin 1 is generally considered to be neuron specific , but a recent finding showed it can be activated to mediate rapid compensatory clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( cme ) in non - neuronal cells [ 7 , 8 ] .
in contrast , dynamin 2 is ubiquitously expressed and 3 is mainly expressed in the testis , brain and low levels in the lung [ 9 ] .
despite sharing significant sequence identity , dynamin 1 and 2 differ in their curvature - generating / sensing properties [ 10 ] .
in the peripheral sensory neurons , dynamin 1 and 2 have been found to have distinct localization , with isoform 1 located in the peri - nuclear region and 2 mainly resides on the plasma - lemma , suggestive of the distinct functions for these two isoforms ( figure 2a ) .
dynamin 1 has more potent curvature - generating properties , and it is better suited for rapid , compensatory endocytosis at the synapse , whereas the curvature - sensing properties of dynamin 2 require a narrow neck to trigger its assembly , therefore , dynamin 2 is more suited to monitor and regulate maturation of the early stages of clathrin - coated pits ( ccps ) [ 10 ] .
there has been reported evidence for isoform - specific functions of dynamin 1 and 2 as well as 3 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis both at the central synapse [ 11 ] , peripheral nerves [ 4 ] and non - neuronal cells [ 12 ] , respectively ( figure 1 ) .
moreover , an overlapping but distinct role between 3 isoforms of dynamin has been shown , for example , expressing any of the three dynamin isoforms in dynamin 1 knock - out ( ko ) neurons could compensate for the dynamin 1 phenotype [ 13 ] .
figure 2 distinct localization of dynamin isoforms in the peripheral neurons highlights their distinct functional importance the linear domain arrangement of human dynamin and related proteins. a. immuno - fluorescence study demonstrated that dynamin 1 and 2 showed distinct distribution pattern in the cultured trigeminal ganglionic neuron .
dynamin 1 , green ; dynamin 2 , red ; nuclei , blue. b. each domain of dynamin protein is indicated as follows : g domain , yellow , is responsible for gtp binding and hydrolysis ; middle coiled - coil domain - gtpase effector domain ( ged ) stalk , blue , is responsible for dynamin protein self - assembly , and variant splicing ; ph domain ( pleckstrin homology ) , green , is responsible for lipid binding ; ged , orange , is responsible for ring assembling and also enhance gtpase activity ; prd ( proline rich domain ) , light purple , interacts with sh3 - domain partners , such as amphyphisin ; n - terminal mis ( mitochondrial import sequence ) : dark purple , is responsible for targeting the opa1 protein ; b insert domain ( pink ) of the dnm1 guanosine triphosphatase ( a drp ) contains a novel motif required for association with the mitochondrial adaptor mdv1 to the mitochondria .
although the basis for isoform differences and their functional significance remains poorly understood , each isoform has been linked to different disease conditions , including alzheimer 's disease , parkinson 's disease , huntington 's disease , charcot - marie - tooth disease , heart failure , schizophrenic , epilepsy dominant optic atrophy , osteoporosis , down 's syndrome and various types of cancer [ 14 ] ( table 1 ) .
table 1 influence of dynamin and related proteins on cancergenesis dynamin isoforms cancer cell types with abnormally expressed or activated dynamin proteins outcome dynamin 1 acute myeloid leukemia , lung and colon adenocarcinomas,h1299 non - small lung cancer cells aberrant trafficking of nascent clathrin - coated vesicles and alteration of cell signalling and enhancement of cell proliferation ; dynamin 1 is acutely activated by an akt / gsk3beta signalling cascade to increase the rate of ccp initiation in the h1299 cancer cells .
[ 7 , 8 , 30 ] dynamin 2 progressive prostate cancer ( pca ) , pancreatic tumor cells,hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) , colon - derived tumor cell line , hct116 , pancreatic tumor cells,malignant glioblastomas,breast - cancer cells , human non - small cell lung carcinoma cells , invasive bladder cancer cells , adult t - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia dynamin 2 expression is significantly increased in these cancer conditions .
dynamin 2 is involved in the promotion of cytokinesis , enhancement of tumor invasion and metastasis .
dynamin 2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis ; dynamin 2 and cortactin participate in cell migration by stabilizing f - actin bundles in filopodia .
dynamin 2 contributes to the bladder cancer invasion by controlling invadopodia formation ; mutation of dynamin 2 in oncogenesis of t - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ 33 , 37 , 39 , 42 , 45 , 99 - 103 ] dynamin 3 hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesisis dynamin 3 gene ( dnm3 ) is hyper - methylated and protein expression level is decreased .
dynamin 3 has tumor suppressive function in hcc by upregulating and activating p53 .
[ 46 , 47 ] dynamin - related protein 1 lung and breast cancers,glioblastoma cells,human lung cancer cell ; t - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells drp1 is upregulated in certain types of cancers .
upregulated drp1 confers chemotherapy resistance , induces apoptotic resistance and autophagy , facilities cell cycle progression , generates genome instability , promotes cell migration and induces poor prognosis .
[ 26 , 67 , 69 , 70 ] mitofusin 1 and mitofusin 2 human lung cancer cells express imbalance of drp 1 / mfn 2 expression ( an increase in drp - 1 and decrease in mfn - 2 ) ; downregulation of mfn2 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells mfn - 1 and - 2 induce mitochondrial fission .
overexpression of mfn - 2 , drp - 1 inhibition , or drp - 1 knockdown results in a marked reduction of cancer cell proliferation and an increase in spontaneous apoptosis .
[ 23 , 25 - 27 , 104 ] dynamin - like gtpase optic atrophy 1 lung adenocarcinoma cells and hepatocellular carcinoma opa1 is upregulated in various forms of cancer .
cell cycle progression , genome instability , cell migration , poor prognosis [ 25 , 27 , 75 ] apart from the above isoforms , dynamin - related family members also contribute to carcinogenesis or tumor suppression .
these dynamin - related proteins include fission proteins , for example , the large self - assembling gtpase dynamins , related protein 1 ( drp1 , also called dlp1 ) [ 15 ] , mitochondrial fission 1 ( fis1 ) [ 16 ] , fusion proteins ( mfn1 , mfn2 ) [ 17 - 20 ] , and optic atrophy 1 ( opa1 ) [ 21 - 24 ] .
these proteins are essential to maintain mitochondrial fission and fusion balance to provide necessary adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) to neurons .
it is notable that certain cancer patients revealed an imbalanced expression of dynamin - related proteins in fusion and fission which resulted in increased mitochondrial fragmentation .
in particular , reduced protein expression levels of mfn1 , mfn2 , and opa1 and high levels of fis1 and dlp1 / drp1 were observed in certain cancer conditions [ 23 , 25 - 28 ] ( table 1 ) .
dynamin 1 signalling in carcinogenesis dynamin 1 has been linked to many neurological diseases for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and alzheimer 's disease [ 29 ] .
expression of dynamin 1 is upregulated in a number of cancer cells from acute myeloid leukaemia , lung and colon adenocarcinomas [ 30 ] , perhaps reflecting a protective function against pathways of apoptosis ( table 1 ) .
it has been shown most recently that overexpression and activation of dynamin - 1 is selectively activated down - stream of tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) - related apoptosis - inducing ligand ( trail ) - death receptors to self - regulate their endocytosis , attenuate apoptotic signalling , enhance cells survival and migration [ 8 ] .
in another word , a reduced level of dynamin - 1 expression confers greater sensitivity to trail - induced apoptosis , whereas enhanced level of dynamin - 1 expression results more resistance to apoptosis .
dynamin 1 is also acutely activated by akt / gsk3beta signalling in h1299 non - small lung cancer cells , which results in an increase of the rate of ccp initiation , and alteration of ccp dynamics , as well as triggering rapid , accelerated calthrin - mediated endocytosis ( cme ) [ 7 ] .
the dysregulated cme leads to aberrant trafficking of nascent clathrin - coated vesicles ( ccvs ) , and alters cell signalling and enhances cell proliferation .
this function is also the first evidence of dynamin 1 function in non - neuronal cells [ 7 ] .
altogether , dynamin 1 - targeted anti - cancer therapeutics may potentially to induce cancer cell apoptosis .
dynamin 2 as a prognostic marker in cancer unlike dynamin 1 , dynamin 2 has been found to be expressed ubiquitously .
it is best known for its role in membrane trafficking processes and , recently , it has been uncovered to promote the cytokinesis , cell proliferation , migration , and act as prognostic marker .
dynamin 2 is required for the abscission phase of cytokinesis .
knockdown of dynamin results in multinucleation , a characteristic of a failed cytokinesis in hela cells [ 31 ] .
in terms of endocytosis , it is well known that the endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) requires dynamin 2 .
egfr induces tumorigenesis by multiple signalling pathways .
amplification of both dynamin 2 and egfr genes have been demonstrated to occur in carcinoma patients [ 32 ] .
after dynamin 2 is knocked down or inhibited , the internalization of egfr is delayed and reduced , resulting in increased egf - mediated tumor cell migration , colony formation and invasion [ 33 , 34 ] .
moreover , dynamin 2 is necessary for the endocytosis of several proteins associated with cancer motility and invasiveness , including integrin beta - 1 and focal adhesion ( fa ) kinase [ 35 , 36 ] .
knockdown dynamin 2 leads to impaired focal adhesion disassembly and cell migration .
dynamin 2 also regulates polyamine internalization in a colon - derived tumor cell line , hct116 [ 37 ] .
polyamines are ubiquitous small basic molecules involved in primordial stress resistance and their uptake is increased in cancer cells [ 38 ] .
polyamine uptake process is independent of clathrin but it is dependent on caveolin - 1 , highlighting dynamin 2 regulates clathrin - independent endocytosis in cancer cells .
dynamin 2 expression was found to be upregulated in several cancerous conditions .
its overexpression is closely associated with neoplastic prostate epithelium and its poor prognosis [ 39 ] .
in isolated progressive prostate cancer ( pca ) cells , dynamin 2 was found to regulate focal adhesion turnover , which is critical for cell migration [ 39 ] .
elevated dynamin 2 expression levels are associated with gleason score , tumor volume , and pca - specific mortality .
knockdown of dynamin 2 expression or inhibition of dynamin 2 prevents cell invasiveness in androgen - responsive and - refractory pca models , supporting the potential benefit of dynamin 2 to serve as a target for development of novel therapeutics for treatment of advanced pca [ 39 ] .
in preclinical models , dynamin 2 gene silencing significantly reduced cell migration and invasion in vitro , as well as tumor size and lymph node metastases in vivo [ 39 ] .
level of dynamin 2 was also found to be increased in the cervical cancer , which might be related to the increased proliferation , dysfunction of apoptotic activity and increased migration [ 40 ] .
together these results suggest that both enzymatic activity and proper localization of dynamin 2 are required for extracellular matrix degradation by invasive cancer cells [ 41 ] .
different cell factors are demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of dynamin 2 function , for example , dynamin 2 is regulated by proto - oncogenic expression of k - ras in human colon cancer cells [ 37 ] and promotes pancreatic cancer cell migration through activation of rac1 [ 42 ] .
dynamin 2 has been identified as a vav1 - sh3 interacting protein which remodels actin in t cells [ 43 ] and this interaction is deemed specific to vac1 , rather than vac2 or 3 ( figure 3 ) .
vac1 also interacts with an actin regulatory scaffold protein zyxin which is known to be involved in cell adhesion , cell migration and integrin function in t cells and control the cancer cell motility through integrin [ 44 ] .
more recently , in pancreatic tumor cells , dynamin 2 was found to promote lamellipodia formation and pancreatic tumor cell migration by its direct binding with vav1 to promote rac1 activation and migration [ 42 ] .
figure 3 schematic map for potential targets in dynamin - mediated tumor development whereas dynamin 1 and 2 act as the tumor promotors in contrast , dynamin 3 has tumor suppressive role .
inhibition or depletion of the akt / gsk3beta signalling pathway will prevent the function of dynamin 1 in lung cancer cells .
moreover , inhibition of dynamin 2 interaction with vav1 will stop the activation of rac1 , and a method that prevents phosphorylation of pdgfralpha - pi3k / shp - 2 will reduce the increased tumor growth and cancer cell invasion in certain types of cancer .
blockage of hypermethylation of dnm3 by some genetic approach or increase of expression of dynamin 3 protein will prevent the tumor development .
in brain cancer , dynamin 2 is a downstream effector of the pdgfralpha - pi3k / shp - 2 signalling in glioma cells and mediates pdgfralpha - shp - 2 - promoted glioblastoma growth and invasion [ 45 ] .
depletion of endogenous dynamin 2 by short hairpin rnas ( shrnas ) inhibited pdgfralpha - stimulated phosphorylation and activation of akt , extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 / 2 , rac1 and cdc42 , prevented glioma cell migration and tumor growth as well as invasion in the brains of mice .
thus , targeting dynamin 2 or pdgfralpha - shp - 2 - dynamin 2 pathway may be beneficial to patients with malignant glioblastomas [ 45 ] .
dynamin 3 as a tumor suppressor differing from dynamin 1 and 2 , dynamin 3 can function as a suppressor of tumorigenesis by induction of p53 expression and activation [ 46 ] .
interestingly , dynamin 3 gene ( dnm3 ) was identified as one of the genes associated with hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesisis , from a triple combination array carried out in surgical specimens obtained from hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) patients .
48 hcc patients were evaluated in that study for dnm3 methylation and expression status using methylation specific polymerase chain reaction ( msp - pcr ) and semi - quantitative reverse transcriptase rt - pcr , respectively [ 47 ] .
dnm3 was found being hypermethylated in cancer tissue compared with adjacent normal tissue , and this was associated with decreased expression of dnm3 in cancerous tissue ( figure 3 ) .
patients with reduced expression of dynamin 3 in tumor tissues exhibited worse prognosis with decreased disease specific survival compared to patients without decreased expression [ 47 ] .
dynamin gene - related non - coding rnas are bifunctional non - coding rnas are found to have a key function in the regulation of gene expression at the post - transcriptional level by base pairing with complementary regions mainly within the 3 ' untranslated regions ( 3 ' - utr ) of target mrnas , thus promoting mrna degradation and translational repression .
these intronic micrornas ( mirrnas ) can support the function of its host gene by silencing genes that are functionally antagonistic to the host , or act synergistically with the host by coordinating the expression of genes with related functions .
mirrnas promote or inhibit cancer growth by regulate the expression of target genes .
in relation to the dynamin genes , microrna - 214 ( mir - 214 ) is located about 6kb apart on chromosome lg24.2 in an intron of the dnm3 gene , and is also involved in carcinogenesis .
although the biological function of mir - 214 still remains unclear in certain cancers , mir - 214 's pleiotropic and tumor - specific contribution to various cancer hallmarks formation and progression is achieved via several target genes [ 48 ] .
it functions as both a tumor suppressor and oncogene in various types of human cancers .
moreover , mir - 214 is a novel biomarker for lymph node metastasis in patients with gastric cancer and plays an important role in the development of gastric cancer in the chinese han population [ 49 ] .
in samples from breast cancer that resistant to cisplatin and tongue squamous carcinoma cell lines as well as in ovarian cancer resistant to platinum , mir - 214 was found to be over - expressed [ 50 - 52 ] .
but , in the cervical cancer tissues [ 53 ] , multiple melanoma [ 54 ] , ovarian [ 55 ] , hepatocellular carcinomas [ 56 ] and bladder cancer [ 57 ] , mir - 214 is frequently down - regulated .
a high mir - 214 level was also detected in the non - small cell lung cancer cell lines resistant to doxorubicin [ 58 ] .
in general , overexpression of mir - 214 inhibited cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis [ 55 ] .
mir - 214 itself is also transcriptionally regulated by transcription factors , peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - alpha ( pparalpha ) , hypoxia - inducible factor - 1alpha ( hif - 1alpha ) , and it also is involved in the post - transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mrnas [ 59 ] .
because of the essential roles of mir - 214 in coordinating tumor proliferation , stemness , angiogenesis , invasiveness , extravasation , metastasis , resistance to chemotherapy , and microenvironment , mir - 214 becomes a molecular hub involved in the control of cancer networks .
mir - 214 switching in diverse forms of cancer either by its upregulation or downregulation sheds light on the mechanism of its tumorigenic and suppressive roles and has resulted in it being a potential diagnostic / prognostic biomarker and target for therapeutic intervention [ 48 ] .
mir - 199a is also transcribed as antisense of dynamin 3 ( chromosome 1q24.3 ) .
hypermethylation of this region was deemed to correlate with mir - 199a in testicular cancer cells and leaded to suppression of cell growth , cancer migration , invasion and metastasis [ 60 ] .
like mir - 214 , mir - 199a is also either up - regulated or down - regulated in a variety of cancers .
for example , it is downregulated in human hcc , liver cancer cells [ 61 ] and in testicular germ cell tumor ( tgct ) [ 62 ] .
interestingly , mir - 199a and mir - 214 were concordantly expressed in a human neuron - committed teratocarcinoma nt2 cell line and tgct patient tissue samples [ 62 ] .
mir - 199a and mir - 199b ( mir - 199a / b ) family of mirnas are conserved within their intronic sequences [ 63 ] .
the mir - 199a / b family is composed of three members , mir - 199a1 , mir - 199a2 and mir - 199b , which are transcribed from conserved antisense intronic transcripts of the dnm2 locus ( human chromosome 19 ) , dnm3 locus ( human chromosome 1 ) and dnm1 locus ( human chromosome 9 ) , respectively .
mir - 199a and b regulate endocytic transport by controlling the expression of important mediators of endocytosis such as clathrin heavy chain , rab5a , low - density lipoprotein receptor ( ldlr ) , and caveolin - 1 ( cav - 1 ) [ 63 ] .
one of the two mature microrna species derived from mir - 199a , named mir - 199a - 5p is associated with tumor malignancy .
both mir - 199a and b - 5p , inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis through the regulation of clathrin heavy chain , rab5a and rab21 expression , affecting the normal function of receptors located in the plasma membrane such as ldlr and transferrin receptor .
in summary , mir - 199a / b - 5p regulates related physiological processes to those controlled by the host genes in which they are encoded and a significant number of predicted target genes for mir - 199a / b - 5p were associated with cellular transport [ 63 ] .
moreover , mir - 199a / mir - 214 forms mir - 199a / mir - 214 / psmd10 / tp53 / dnmt1 self - regulatory network [ 62 ] , which might be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of tgct [ 62 ] .
interestingly , mir - 199a encoded from the opposite strand of dynamin 2 gene dnm2 exerts reciprocal negative regulation upon hif - 1alpha and hif - 2alpha [ 64 ] .
overexpression of mir - 199a decreased hif - 1alpha and hif - 2alpha , cell migration , and metastasis , thus , serves as a regulatory loop between endocytic pathway and hypoxic response in tumor cells .
mir - 199a has also been implicated to modulate intracellular iron levels by targeting hif and indirectly affecting the tumor microenvironment through suppression of lysyl oxidase protein expression in ovarian cancer cells [ 64 ] .
apart from mir - 214 , mir - 3120 is also encoded from a single gene locus of the dynamin 3 gene , under certain conditions , due to imperfect base pairing .
mir - 214 and mir - 3120 are the two distinct micrornas produced from the fully complementary dna strands .
mir - 3120 is produced following transcription and mrna processing , whereas mir - 214 is produced by antisense transcription .
mir - 3120 regulates heat shock cognate protein 70 , thus it serves as a mirror microrna regulating endocytic function of hsc70 and auxilin as well as their expression to influence vesicle uncoating .
mir - 3120 is also known to prevent uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles , and mir - 214 is known to target pten ( phosphatase and tensinhomolog ) , which interacts with dynamin and regulates synaptic proteins involved in receptor cycling and synaptic plasticity [ 65 ] .
despite mir - 3120 being regulator for endocytosis pathways , it is not known whether there is any direct modulation role in the tumorigenosis .
therapeutic potential of dynamin - related proteins dynamin - related proteins are a group of gtp - binding proteins containing good conservation of the five domains architectures defined for classical dynamin .
the five domains contained by classical dynamin are the followings : gtpase domain ; middle domain ; pleckstrin - homology ( ph ) domain ; effector domain ( ged ) ; proline - rich domain ( prd ) ( figure 2b ) .
dynamin - related protein proteins also function in vesicle budding , trafficking and membrane - scission events .
these proteins have similarity in some domains but might miss out several and have additional domain conferring distinct roles .
dynamin - related protein 1 ( drp1 ) as a therapeutic target drp1 , an 80 kda gtpase without the prd ( figure 2b ) , is involved in mitochondrial fission and anti - cancer drug - mediated cytotoxicity , implicating an association with cancer progression [ 25 ] .
drp1 is also involved in conferring chemotherapy resistance , cell cycle progression , genome instability , cell migration and apoptosis .
it is upregulated in certain types of cancerssuch as lung and breast cancer [ 25 , 26 , 66 ] .
drp1 upregulation and activation induce changes in mitochondrial dynamics crucial to confer the drug resistant in t - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells [ 67 ] .
the influence of mitochondria on human health and disease and mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer has expanded to include defects in mitochondrial genomics and biogenesis , apoptotic signalling and mitochondrial dynamics [ 68 ] .
moreover , defects in mitochondrial fission protein drp1 are linked to apoptotic resistance and autophagy in a lung cancer model [ 69 ] .
it has been implicated that drugs targeting to drp1 - mediated mitochondrial fission prevents tumor cell cycle progression .
thus , drp1 inhibition , or drp1 knockdown resulted in an observed reduction of cancer cell proliferation and an increase of spontaneous apoptosis and thus serves as an effective therapy for cancer treatment [ 26 ] .
drp1 is also found to contribute to the migration of human glioblastoma cells under hypoxia , and causes the poor prognosis of glioblastoma due to its mitochondrial control in brain tumor initiating cells [ 70 ] .
nuclear drp1 may increase drug resistance during hypoxia .
drp1 co - precipitated protein , the human homologue of the yeast repair protein rad23 ( hhr23a ) , is essential for nuclear transportation of drp1 [ 71 ] .
meanwhile , the nuclear and nucleolar drp1 ( drp1nuc ) are associated with poor cancer prognosis [ 71 ] .
in brain cancer , drp1 controls the migration and neuronal differentiation of subventricular zone - derived neural progenitor cells [ 72 ] .
inhibiting drp1 activity induces alteration of the typical migratory cell morphology into round shapes while the polarized mitochondrial distribution was maintained. with these changes , adult neural stem cells ( anscs ) derived from the subventricular zone of the brain failed to migrate , and neuronal differentiation was prevented [ 73 ] .
targeting drp1 activity by genetic approach or pharmacologic inhibitors attenuates growth of stem - like tumors and lead to good prognosis [ 74 ] , thus , drp1 serves as a potential target for cancer treatment .
mitofusin ( mfn ) as a therapeutic target mfn 1 and mfn 2 are involved in fusion between mitochondria by tethering adjacent mitochondria ( figure 2b ) .
these proteins have two transmembrane segments that anchor to the mitochondrial outer membrane .
mfn1 and mfn2 exist as both homotypic and heterotypic oligomers , and therefore can cooperate as well as act individually to promote mitochondrial fusion .
each isoform is essential for embryonic development and mitochondrial fusion , and both have distinct and redundant functions to promote mitochondrial fusion [ 17 ] .
mutations in mitofusin proteins result in fragmented mitochondria , but this can be reversed by mutations in mammalian drp1 .
human lung cancer cell lines exhibit an imbalanced expression level of drp1 / mfn2 , which promotes a state of mitochondrial fission [ 25 ] .
lung tumor tissue samples from patients demonstrated a similar increase in drp1 and decrease in mfn2 when compared to adjacent healthy lung .
furthermore , drp1 also regulates cell cycle progression , genome instability , cell migration and apoptosis in cancer cells .
these findings raise the possibility of targeting drp1 - mediated mitochondrial fission as an effective therapy for treating cancer [ 26 ] .
dynamin - like gtpase opa1 as a therapeutic target another dynamin family members called opa1 , is localized on mitochondrial intermembrane space , where it facilitates fusion between mitochondria [ 21 ] .
in various forms of cancer , opa1 is highly expressed and indicates poor prognosis ( table 1 ) .
the mitochondria fusion protein opa1 expression level is critical in determining the sensitivity of hcc to sorafenib - induced apoptosis in hcc treatment [ 75 ] and decreased expression of opa1 is associated with the treatment of hcc by sorafenib , a multi - kinase inhibitor [ 75 ] .
dynamin - targeted inhibitors for cancer treatment targeting dynamin function has great potential to produce a safe therapy to hopefully increase the life expectancy and quality of life for cancer patients .
some dynamin inhibitors have already been moved from the lab into clinical trials .
the specificity and potency are the major selection criteria for basic and therapeutic proposes .
dynamin inhibitors represent a new class of targeted anti - mitotic compounds ( table 2 ) .
they are a small but expanding ' palette ' of compounds available to rapidly and reversibly block dynamin via distinct mechanisms of action , by operating at different stages in its cycle of gtpase activity .
overall , they possess both antimitotic and anticancer effects .
the first reported dynamin inhibitors were long - chain ammonium salts called mitmab ( tm ) compounds [ 76 ] , and then , followed by dimeric tyrphostins [ 77 ] , and a series of room temperature ionic liquids ( rtils ) [ 78 ] .
two of the most potent inhibitors from the long - chain ammonium salts , myristyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ( mitmab ) and octadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ( octmab ) , are potent and reversible inhibitors of endocytosis in neuronal and non - neuronal cells , and selectively block dynamin 's second function in cytokinesis [ 79 ] .
targeting cytokinesis with dynamin inhibitors may be a promising new approach for the treatment of cancer [ 80 , 81 ] .
mitmabs inhibit dynamin gtpase activity by targeting its ph domain , a module common to many proteins .
in contrast to the classical ( e.g. taxol ) and targeted ( e.g. aurora kinase and polo - like kinases inhibitors ) anti - mitotic compounds which aim to disrupt the mitotic spindle , advantages of mitmabs is that it is a cell - permeable , water soluble dynamin 1 and 2 inhibitor which exclusively block cytokinesis without disrupting progression through any other stage of mitosis [ 80 ] .
apart from inducing cytokinesis failure , mitmabs also induce apoptosis in cancer cells [ 82 ] .
overall , mitmabs are highly cytotoxic and possess anti - proliferative properties , which seem to be selective for cancer cells .
table 2 commonly used dynamin inhibitors are not isoform specific for cancer treatment inhibitors molecular formula targets function mitmab c17h38brn dynamins1 and 2 surface - active , small molecule , dynamin inhibitors that block endocytosis .
targets the dynamin - phospholipid interaction to block dynamin recruitment to membranes but not dynamin oligomerization [ 79 ] octmab c21h46brn dynamins1 and 2 works together with mitmab to induce cytokinesis failure and inhibit cell proliferation [ 105 ] dynole 34 - 2 c25h36n4o dynamins1 and 2 more efficacious and has less off - target effects than mitmabs [ 81 ] .
it acts on the dynamin g domain [ 106 ] .
it is not gtp competitive [ 106 ] .
inhibit the activity of dynamin following recruitment of dynamin to plasma membranes [ 83 ] dynasore c18h14n2o4 dynamins1 and 2 noncompetitive inhibitor which dose - dependently inhibits the gtpase activity of dynamin 1 , 2 , and drp1 ( mitochondrial ) [ 4 , 107 - 109 ] dyngo c18h14n2o5 dynamins1 and 2 greatly improved dynasore analogues , with greatly reduced non - specific in vitro binding and improved potency [ 78 ] ; it is more potent than dynasore and more specific to block dynamin function after its recruitment , with more versatile cell biology tools with reduced cytotoxicity [ 4 , 78 ] mdivi1 c15h10cl2n2o2s drp1 a selective cell - permeable inhibitor of mitochondrial division by blocking dynamin gtpase activity [ 110 - 113 ] iminodyn - 22 c23h20n4o8 dynamins1 and 2 binds to the gtpase domain at an allosteric site and displays uncompetitive antagonism with respect to gtp [ 114 ] rtil - 13 c30h55brn2o3 dynamins1 and 2 inhibits dynamin i and ii gtpase and targets pleckstrin homology ( ph ) ( lipid binding ) domain [ 78 ] in contrast to mitmab , octmab blocks dynamin recruitment to membranes whereas the dynole ( tm ) compounds and dynasore block dynamin after its recruitment [ 83 ] .
dynoles cause cytokinesis failure by blocking abscission , which is consistent with inhibition of dynamin 2 .
dynole 34 - 2 is a novel antimitotic compound which specifically acts at the abscission stage and selectively targets dividing cells .
it is a dynamin inhibitor and is proved to be the most potent compound for cytokinesis failure [ 83 ] .
the dynoles are thought to bind an allosteric site in the gtpase domain and are expected to be more efficacious and have less off - target effects than mitmabs .
inhibition of dynamin by dynole 34 - 2 induces cell death following cytokinesis failure in a range of cancer cells , such as cellosaurus cell line sma - 560 , paediatric solid tumor line sj - g2 ( glioblastoma ) , colon cancer cell line sw480 , breast cancer cell line mcf - 7 , human ovarian a2780 cancer cells and hela cells [ 81 ] .
dynasore and its derivatives are also suitable candidates for potent anti - cancer drugs .
dynasore is a non - competitive inhibitor which dose - dependently inhibits the gtpase activity of dynamin 1 and 2 , and presumably at higher doses , other dynamin family members .
it also interfered with the in vitro gtpase activity of drp1 [ 84 ] .
for instance , dynamic remodelling of actin filaments is the basis for a variety of cellular events including cell motility , cancer cell invasion , and the regulation of actin dynamics [ 85 ] .
furthermore , invasion activity of h1080 cell , a lung cancer cell line , was suppressed by approximately 40 % with dynasore treatment [ 86 ] .
these results strongly suggest that dynasore potently destabilizes f - actin .
notably , dynasore destabilizes f - actin and inhibits serum - induced lamellipodia formation in cells , disrupts co - localization of dynamin 2 and cortactin and inhibits invasion of lung cancer cell line h1080 [ 86 ] .
dynago are greatly improved dynasore analogues with greatly reduced or no non - specific in vitro binding and improved potency , they are more potent than dynasore and more specific , blocking dynamin function after its recruitment , with more versatile cell biology tools with reduced cytotoxicity .
among them , dyngo - 4a is the most potent one with 37 fold more potent than dynasore [ 78 ] .
two drp1 inhibitors , mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 ( mdivi1 ) or mir - 499 , are potent in inhibition of mitochondrial division [ 87 ] .
mdivi1 is a selective cell - permeable inhibitor of mitochondrial division drp1 and dynamin 1 .
it enhances death receptor - mediated apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells and is able to increase the sensitivity of human ovarian cancer cells to death receptor ligands including trail , fas ligands , and tnf - alpha [ 88 ] .
it has been reported to enhance the apoptotic effect of the death receptor ligand trail in human ovarian cancer [ 57 ] .
low serum mir - 499 expression was associated with advanced tumor node metastasis ( tnm ) stage and poor prognosis [ 89 ] .
overexpression of mir - 499 - 5p inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro as well as in vivo .
thus , it functions as a tumor suppressor [ 90 ] .
other drugs such as micheliolide may also influence drp1 function .
micheliolide is a guaianolide sesquiterpene lactone , which induced drp1 - mediated cell death in breast cancer cells ( mcf - 7 ) through the reactive oxygen species mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway [ 57 ] .
other dynamin inhibitors include a group of antidepressant drugs which have anti - proliferative activity , for example , sertraline which significantly inhibited tumor growth in cd1 nude mice xenografted subcutaneously with ht29 cells and has also been successfully used in cancer patients [ 91 ] .
the mechanism involved could possibly be that this group of inhibitors block dynamin activity and inhibit endocytosis in tumor cells , as observed in hela and human neuroblastoma sh - sy5y cells [ 92 ] .
chlorpromazine marketed under the trade names thorazine and largactil among others , is a cationic amphiphilic phenothiazine - derived anti - psychotic drug which inhibits endocytosis by blocking dynamin 2 function [ 93 ] .
apart from above - noted dynamin inhibitors , chlorpromazine has been shown to have a relative high specificity for brain cancer [ 94 , 95 ] .
moreover , it has been proven to inhibit glioblastoma growth in rat brains when used in combination with nitrosureas .
phenothiazine - derived antipsychotic drugs ( apds ) , which are the cationic amphi - pathic drugs , also inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 93 ] .
it is proposed that potent dynamin inhibition is a shared characteristic of phenothiazine - derived apds , but not other typical or atypical apds [ 93 ] .
successful cancer treatment requires multiple approaches to reach the most effectiveness .
for example , no single combination regimen has clearly emerged as a favourite for the treatment of recurrent or progressive glioblastoma .
for instance , the newly diagnosed glioblastoma is now commonly treated with surgery , if feasible , or biopsy , followed by radiation plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide , the drug serves as the first line treatment for glioblastoma .
however , only approximately one - half of patients respond to temozolomide as it showed little effect in elderly patients with advanced age .
nitrosoureas only remain a second - line treatment option in single and combination regimens , and temozolomide in combination with cisplatin , fotemustine , interferon , sorafenib , celecoxib , irinotecan , or procarbazine / lomustine / vincristine has not been demonstrated to be more effective than temozolomide alone [ 96 ] .
similarly , her1 / egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib or gefitinib are the most clinically advanced her1 / egfr - targeted agents for the treatment of glioblastoma .
however , both inhibitors only treat a fraction of patients because her1 / egfr are only overexpressed in these patients [ 97 ] .
the newly developed inhibitors for dynamin and its related proteins might offer an alternative option for combination of therapeutics to achieve the synergistic effectiveness for glioblastoma .
conclusions and persepctives to conclude , dysregulation of endocytosis has been accepted as an emerging feature of cancer development .
significant evidence points to dynamins and their - related proteins as having an important function in carcinogenesis .
each dynamin isoform contributes to various types of cancer development by regulating endocytosis , cytokinesis , cell migration , invasion , and prognosis .
in general , dynamin 1 and 2 are overexpressed in cancerous tissue and each is related to specific cancer types .
targeted therapeutics are required to decrease their expression levels or prevent the hypermethylation of the dynamin 3 gene or inhibitors selectively block the signalling cascades would be beneficial .
dynamin 3 serves as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesisis and its expression is decreased during the disease condition due to gene hypermethylation .
targeted therapeutics are required to improve its expression level or blockade the hypermethylation of the dnm3 .
moreover , the expression levels of dynamin gene - related proteins become imbalanced in cancer .
these proteins are potential diagnostic / prognostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapeutic intervention .
anti - sense non - coding rnas for the dynamin gene are bifunctional .
up - or down - regulation of non - coding rna controls dynamin gene expression and mitochondrial division , to promote tumorigeneses or suppress tumorigenesis .
although numerous dynamin inhibitors have been developed so far , they have failed to selectively block a specific isoform of dynamin .
current dynamin inhibitors are non - selective to a particular isoform , thus , selective inhibitors against distinct isoform are needed for future anti - cancer drug development .
the most commonly used dynamin inhibitors have revealed off - target effects in dynamin triple knockout cells [ 98 ] , warranting future development of isoform - specific inhibitors for dynamin as potential therapeutics for successful anti - cancer treatment. dr. kim orange ( dublin city university ) is thanked for a critical reading of the manuscript .

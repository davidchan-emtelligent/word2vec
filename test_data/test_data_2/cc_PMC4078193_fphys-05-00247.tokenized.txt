muscle function inflammation oxidative stress recovery modalities adhesion molecules muscle performance might be temporarily impaired by high - intensity exercise performed during a competition or training session .
the attenuation in muscular strength may be transitory , lasting minutes , hours , or several days following training or competition ( barnett , 2006 ) .
longer - lasting impairment in muscle strength accompanied by a reduction in range of motion , an increase in muscle proteins in the blood , an inflammatory response , muscle swelling , and delayed onset muscle soreness is referred to as exercise induced muscle damage ( eimd ) ( clarkson and hubal , 2002 ; barnett , 2006 ; paulsen et al. , 2012 ) .
different modalities have been used to improve recovery from a damaging bout of exercise ( barnett , 2006 ) .
among the most common treatment approaches used to reestablish muscular function are active recovery , compression garments , massage , stretching , anti - inflammatory drugs , and cryotherapy ( cheung et al. , 2003 ; barnett , 2006 ; bishop et al. , 2008 ) .
a relatively novel modality of cryotherapy is whole - body cryotherapy ( wbc ) , which consists of brief exposure ( 2 - 3 min ) to extremely cold air ( - 100 to - 195degreesc ) in a temperature - controlled chamber or cryocabin ( banfi et al. , 2010 ; hausswirth et al. , 2011 ; fonda and sarabon , 2013 ) .
sessions of partial - body cryotherapy ( pbc ) , in which the head is not exposed to cold , has also been used as a similar modality of wbc ( hausswirth et al. , 2013 ) .
according to hausswirth et al .
( 2013 ) , wbc and pbc session decreased skin temperature , however , wbc induced a greater decrease compared to pbc .
in addition , the tympanic temperature was reduced only after the wbc session .
moreover , parasympathetic tone stimulation was greater following the wbc session .
although wbc has been used since the end of the 1970s in the treatment of rheumatic diseases ( ksiezopolska - pietrzak , 2000 ; metzger et al. , 2000 ; rymaszewska et al. , 2003 ) , it has only recently been used with the purpose of hastening recovery from muscle damage by decreasing the inflammatory process linked to eimd ( banfi et al. , 2010 ) .
a logic model proposed by costello et al .
( 2013 ) consisted of the physiological , neuromuscular , and perceptual effects following exposure to wbc which may interact to increase performance .
however , a mechanistic model for how wbc may improve symptoms related to eimd has to this point not been provided ( costello et al. , 2013 ) .
thus , the purpose of this manuscript was to briefly address a possible mechanism related to improved recovery from muscle damage by wbc .
muscle damage induced by exercise the " popping - sarcomere " hypothesis , first proposed by morgan in ( 1990 ) , provided an explanation for the muscle damage response following a series of eccentric contractions .
since then , this " popping - sarcomere " hypothesis has garnered support from several other authors ( clarkson and hubal , 2002 ; peake et al. , 2005 ; paulsen et al. , 2012 ) .
it 's hypothesized that during an eccentric contraction , myofibrils within a muscle fiber are stretched and those weaker sarcomeres absorb most of the stretch .
following several eccentric contractions , the myofilaments of overstretched weaker sarcomeres fail to reconnect because they are disrupted .
this disruption may extend to other sarcomeres , resulting in cell membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum damage .
this process appears responsible for the symptoms associated with eimd , such as the prolonged loss in muscle strength , delayed - onset muscle soreness , increase of muscle protein in blood circulation , intracellular calcium release and onset of the inflammatory response ( clarkson and hubal , 2002 ; peake et al. , 2005 ; paulsen et al. , 2012 ) .
immediately after sarcomeres are disrupted , leukocytes are mobilized to the injured tissue via soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( sicam - 1 ) .
thereafter , pro - inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species are produced in muscle by neutrophils , lymphocytes , and monocytes ( clarkson and hubal , 2002 ; peake et al. , 2005 ; paulsen et al. , 2012 ) .
additionally , macrophages produced by monocytes and neutrophils phagocytize damaged myofibers and muscle debris ( peake et al. , 2005 ; saclier et al. , 2013 ) .
together ( figure 1 ) , leukocytes , pro - inflammatory cytokines , and reactive oxygen species cause intramuscular degradation , which amplifies the initial muscle damage ( clarkson and hubal , 2002 ; peake et al. , 2005 ; paulsen et al. , 2012 ) .
this can be observed by an increase in muscle proteins in systemic circulation 24 - 48 h following the initial bout of exercise .
additionally , the magnitude of the secondary muscle damage response may depend upon the balance between pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines ( clarkson and hubal , 2002 ) .

previously reported mechanisms to wbc improves muscle damage recovery to the best of our knowledge , four studies have evaluated the effects of wbc on the recovery from muscle damage ( hausswirth et al. , 2011 ; pournot et al. , 2011 ; fonda and sarabon , 2013 ) .
hausswirth et al .
( 2011 ) suggested that three sessions of wbc ( 3 min at - 110degreesc ) after eimd in well - trained runners improved muscle strength , perceived sensation , and also decreased muscle pain .
additionally , five wbc exposures ( 3 min at - 140 to - 190degreesc ) may improve the recovery of peak torque , rate of torque development , squat jump start power , and decreased muscle soreness after damaging exercise for the hamstrings ( fonda and sarabon , 2013 ) .
further , pournot et al .
( 2011 ) found that three sessions of wbc ( 3 min at - 110degreesc ) following eimd was effective in reducing the inflammatory response .
it is acknowledged that many of these reported effects of wbc on recovery from severe exercise are small ( bleakley et al. , 2014 ) .
however , it is also acknowledged that those studies ( hausswirth et al. , 2011 ; pournot et al. , 2011 ; fonda and sarabon , 2013 ) have been collected using a cross - over design and could have been influenced by the repeated bout effect .
preliminary data from our laboratory showed that a single wbc session performed immediately after eimd relieved pain , prevented muscle swelling , and resulted in quicker recovery of muscle strength 72 h after eimd .
in contrast , the control group did not recover from muscle swelling and pain until 24 and 96 h following eimd , respectively .
further , muscle strength in the control group was still depressed from baseline 96 h post exercise .
in apparent contrast to our findings , costello et al .
( 2012a ) reported that one session of wbc ( 20 s at - 60degreesc and 3 min at - 110degreesc ) applied 24 h after eimd in healthy subjects did not hasten muscle strength nor decrease muscle soreness .
however , the acute inflammatory process is triggered immediately following eimd .
thus , it stands to reason that wbc applied 24 h after exercise may be too late to have a beneficial physiologic response .
therefore , wbc may decrease symptoms related to eimd produced by mechanical stress if applied immediately after exercise ( hausswirth et al. , 2011 ; pournot et al. , 2011 ; fonda and sarabon , 2013 ) .
the aforementioned studies ( hausswirth et al. , 2011 ; pournot et al. , 2011 ; costello et al. , 2012a ; fonda and sarabon , 2013 ) were conducted with the assumption that wbc could accelerate the recovery from muscle damage by decreasing the inflammatory process .
however , the mechanism behind this effect is largely unknown .
stanek et al .
( 2010 ) suggested that the anti - inflammatory effects of wbc may be linked to lysosomal membrane stabilization with a consequent inhibition of active enzymes released .
wozniak et al .
( 2007 ) showed a decrease in lysosomal enzyme activity : 32 % in acid phosphatase and 46 % in arylsulphatase after 6 days of wbc , but they were not altered after one session of wbc .
similarly , a single session of wbc did not cause a stabilization of lysosomal enzymes ( wozniak et al. , 2007 ) .
thus , considering the results of these studies ( dugue et al. , 2005 ; wozniak et al. , 2007 ; lubkowska et al. , 2009 ) , the hypothesis that lysosomal membrane stabilization is responsible for the anti - inflammatory effect of wbc might make sense after chronic exposure to wbc but not following an acute session .
wbc improves muscle damage recovery by reducing sicam - 1 ?
we hypothesize that the thermoregulatory response to wbc may hasten the recovery from eimd by reducing serum sicam - 1 .
the first step of this thesis is dependent upon the drop in core temperature , which would likely cause constriction of local arterioles and venules .
in support of this , wbc exposure has been observed to result in a decrease in muscle and core temperature ( westerlund et al. , 2003 ; costello et al. , 2012b ) .
costello et al .
( 2012b ) observed a reduction of 0.3degreesc in rectal temperature 60 min after wbc and a similar decrease of 0.24degreesc was observed 20 min after wbc ( westerlund et al. , 2003 ) .
it also has been reported that vastus lateralis temperature decreases 1.6 +/ - 0.6degreesc after wbc session ( costello et al. , 2012b ) .
the next phase in this proposed mechanism is blocking the migration of leukocytes ( neutrophils , lymphocytes , and monocytes ) from blood circulation to the damaged tissue .
it is known that leukocytes initiate the acute inflammatory process following eimd ( clarkson and hubal , 2002 ; peake et al. , 2005 ; paulsen et al. , 2012 ; saclier et al. , 2013 ) .
according to our hypothesis , the thermoregulatory response to wbc hastens the recovery from eimd by reducing serum sicam - 1 .
consequently , fewer neutrophils and lymphocytes would transmigrate into muscle tissue resulting in a decreased pro - inflammatory response ( i.e. , interleukin [ il ] - 2 , il - 6 , il - 8 , il - 1beta , prostaglandin [ pge ] - 2 , and c - reactive protein ) , reactive oxygen species and an increased anti - inflammatory response ( i.e. , il - 10 and il - 1ra ) .
the results reported by pournot et al .
( 2011 ) and mila - kierzenkowska et al .
( 2013 ) corroborate this hypothesis .
pournot et al .
( 2011 ) observed an increase in il - 1ra and a decrease in il - 1beta and c - reactive protein after the first session of wbc performed immediately following eimd in well - trained runners .
in addition , mila - kierzenkowska et al .
( 2013 ) found that a single session of wbc prior to 40 min of submaximal exercise decreased the level of il - 6 , il - 1beta , superoxide dismutase , and catalase activity when compared to exercise completed in the absence of wbc .
further , it has been found that five sessions of wbc ( 30 s at 60degreesc and 2 min at - 110degreesc ) in athletes decreased adhesion molecule sicam - i , blood concentrations of muscular enzymes ( creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase ) , and the pro - inflammatory response ( prostaglandin e2 , interleukin il - 2 , and il - 8 ) to 5 days of high intensity training ( banfi et al. , 2009 ) .
in addition , the anti - inflammatory cytokine il - 10 was increased ( banfi et al. , 2009 ) .
nevertheless , these data should be interpreted with some degree of caution since this study did not evaluate a control group , and it evaluated chronic effect of wbc .
most studies investigating wbc and the inflammatory / oxidative response to exercise evaluated its effect following multiple sessions of wbc ( dugue et al. , 2005 ; wozniak et al. , 2007 , 2013 ; leppaluoto et al. , 2008 ; banfi et al. , 2009 , 2010 ; lubkowska et al. , 2009 , 2010 , 2011 , 2012 ; mila - kierzenkowska et al. , 2009 ; miller et al. , 2012 ; ziemann et al. , 2012 , 2013 ) .
future research should investigate this further to determine if one application of wbc can in fact decrease sicam - 1 .
nevertheless it stands to reason that wbc may attenuate symptoms of emid by decreasing sicam - 1 , subsequently reducing the migration of leukocytes into the damaged tissue .
conclusion we wish to suggest that the attenuation in serum sicam - 1 caused by wbc exposure immediately following eimd may be responsible for the decreased acute inflammatory response to muscle damage .
in addition , repeated bouts of wbc may also further reduce the secondary inflammation occurring days after the damaging bout of exercise .
however , the mechanisms in which the thermoregulatory effects of wbc exposure lead to a reduction in sicam - 1 remain unknown .
thus , further studies on this topic are necessary in order to better understand the thermoregulatory effects of wbc on muscle inflammatory process caused by eimd .
future research could investigate this hypothesis assessing sicam - 1 , oxidative stress , neutrophils , lymphocytes , monocytes , and cytokines cells following wbc applied immediately after eimd .
in addition , future work could investigate the effects of repeated wbc on long term muscle adaptation .
although potentially beneficial in the short term , it is unknown if suppressing the acute inflammatory response may negatively affect the muscles ability to adapt to exercise .
conflict of interest statement the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .

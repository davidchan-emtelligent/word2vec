abstract acute fasting induced antidepressant - like effects .
however , the exact brain region and mechanism of these actions are still largely unknown .
therefore , in this study the antidepressant - like effects of acute fasting on c - fos expression and bdnf levels were investigated .
consistent with our previous findings , immobility time was remarkably shortened by 9 hrs fasting in the forced swimming test .
furthermore , these antidepressant - like effects of 9 fasting were inhibited by a 5 - ht 2a / 2c receptor agonist (+/ - ) - 1 - ( 2 , 5 - dimethoxy - 4 - iodophenyl ) - 2 - aminopropane hydrochloride ( doi ) , and the effect of doi was blocked by pretreatment with a selective 5 - ht 2a receptor antagonist ketanserin .
immunohistochemical study has shown that c - fos level was significantly increased by 9 hrs fasting in prefrontal cortex but not hippocampus and habenular .
fasting - induced c - fos expression was further enhanced by doi in prefrontal cortex , and these enhancements were inhibited by ketanserin .
the increased bdnf levels by fasting were markedly inhibited by doi in frontal cortex and hippocampus , and these effects of doi on bdnf levels were also blocked by ketanserin .
these findings suggest that the antidepressant - like effects of acute fasting may be exerted via 5 - ht 2a receptor and particularly sensitive to neural activity in the prefrontal cortex .
furthermore , these antidepressant - like effects are also mediated by creb and bdnf pathway in hippocampus and frontal cortex .
therefore , fasting may be potentially helpful against depression .

for example , intermittent fasting resulted in beneficial effects in reducing and severity of some neurological disorders 1 , 2 .
clinical evidence has also shown that fasting and caloric restriction dietary regime was effective in improving mood states , such as confusion , anger and tension 2 .
other and our studies have shown that caloric restriction and fasting may improve depression in rodents 3 , 4 .
lutter et al. reported that chronic caloric restriction also caused a significant antidepressant - like response in animal models of depression 3 .
recently , our study has shown that immobility time in the forced swimming test ( fst ) was remarkably inhibited by 9 hrs but not 3 and 18 hrs of fasting without change of locomotor activity 4 .
moreover , the antidepressant - like actions of 9 hrs fasting were inhibited by a 5 - ht2a / 2c receptor agonist (+/ - ) - 1 - ( 2 , 5 - dimethoxy - 4 - iodophenyl ) - 2 - aminopropane hydrochloride ( doi ) .
these data reveal that 5 - ht2 receptor may be involved in the antidepressant - like effects induced by acute fasting .
the c - fos was wieldy used as a neuronal activity marker 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 .
previously studies have reported that c - fos expression was induced by fasting in several brain regions , such as paraventricular nucleus 7 , arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus 8 and amygdala 9 .
it is unclear , however , which specific brain regions are involved in the antidepressant - like actions induced by acute fasting .
therefore , the effects of acute fasting , inducing antidepressant - like effects , on c - fos expression were investigated in the several brain regions , particularly hippocampus , prefrontal cortex and habenular .
these brain regions have been studied extensively as the potential targets of depression treatment 4 , 10 , 11 .
these data would provide the structural basis on the mechanism of antidepressant - like effects induced by acute fasting .
in addition , camp response element binding protein ( creb ) and brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) pathways are widely investigated in depression 4 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 14 .
we have reported that the p - creb / creb ratio was increased by 9 hrs fasting in the hippocampus and frontal cortex .
furthermore , 9 hrs fasting with imipramine exerted the additive antidepressant - like effects in the fst and enhanced the p - creb / creb ratio 4 .
in addition to creb , bdnf is another important target of antidepressant 10 , 15 .
preclinical and clinical studies have shown that depression has been strongly and consistently linked to low levels of bdnf 10 , 15 , 16 , 17 .
duan et al. reported that caloric restriction increased bdnf levels in the striatum and cortex 18 .
another interesting study showed that food restriction decreased bdnf level in hindbrain and hypothalamus , while enhanced expression in hippocampus and cortex 19 .
in addition , intermittent fasting normalized bdnf levels while regular feeding kept them low 20 .
taken together , these data suggest that bdnf signalling may also mediate beneficial effects of fasting on antidepressant - like effects .
however , whether bdnf is involved in acute fasting - induced antidepressant effect require further investigation .
therefore , in this study , the effects of acute fasting , inducing antidepressant - like effects , on c - fos and bdnf levels were examined .
materials and methods animals icr mice ( weighing 23 +/ - 2 g : 6 - weeks old ; jilin university , changchun , china ) were housed in standard mouse cages under a 12 / 12 - hrs light / dark cycle ( lights on from 06:00 to 18:00 hours ) in a humidity - and temperature - controlled room ( 50 +/ - 10 % , 23 +/ - 2degreesc ) .
food and water were available ad libitum .
all mice were acclimatized to the being handled ( gentled ) to reduce stress before the experiments .
drugs the following drugs were used : ketanserin tartrate , doi and imipramine hydrochloride ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) .
the drugs were made with distilled water , which is also the vehicle .
all the drugs were given in a constant volume of 10 ml / kg ( body weight ) .
the drug doses were according to our previous studies 4 , 15 .
forced swim test in first fst , all mice were divided into four groups : control group received vehicle injections , 9 - hrs fasting group ( from 0:00 a.m to 9:00 a.m ) , 18 - hrs fasting group ( from 3:00 p.m to 9:00 a.m ) and imipramine - treated group ( positive control group ) .
in second behaviour test , all mice were divided into five groups : control group ; 9 - hrs fasting group ; 9 hrs fasting + doi group ; 9 hrs fasting + doi + ketanserin group ; imipramine group .
ketanserin ( 5 mg / kg , i.p. ) and doi ( 5 mg / kg , i.p. ) were administered 30 and 5 min .
before fst , respectively .
in addition , in the positive control group imipramine ( 30 mg / kg , i.p. ) was given 30 min .
before fst .
the fst was essentially was reported by our studies 4 , 10 .
in this experiment , mice were placed in a clear plexiglas cylinder ( 11 cm in diameter by 25 cm height containing 20 cm of water at 25degreesc ) .
all mice were then removed and allowed to dry in a separate cage before returning to their home cages .
fst was recorded for 6 min .
the last 4 min of fst was measured by observer blind to the experimental condition 4 , 10 .
c - fos immunohistochemistry c - fos immunohistochemistry was performed as reported by our group 5 , 6 .
briefly , all mice were first deeply anesthetized with chloral hydrate ( 100 mg / kg , i.p. ) , and brain perfusion with ice - cold pbs , followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde in pbs was performed .
after removal , brains were post - fixed with 30 % sucrose .
serial coronal sections ( 30 mum thick ) from different treatment groups were processed in parallel to minimize variation in the immunohistochemical labelling .
free floating sections incubated using 0.6 % solution of hydrogen peroxide containing pbs .
after rinsing again with pbs buffer , the sections incubated with rabbit polyclonal c - fos antibody ( 1:1000 ; santa cruz biotechnology , inc. , santa cruz , ca , usa , # sc - 52 ) solution containing 0.3 % triton x - 100 , 0.05 % sodium azide and 2 % normal goat serum for 72 hrs at 4degreesc .
the sections were then washed and incubated using a secondary antibody [ 1:400 , biotinylated goat anti - rabbit igg ( vector laboratories , burlingame , ca , usa )] at dilution in pbs buffer containing 0.3 % triton x - 100 for 75 min .
at room temperature .
after rinsing in pbs buffer , the sections were replaced by pbs buffer containing 0.4 % avidin - biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex ( vector laboratories ) for another 75 min .
following washes in pbs buffer and 0.2 m sodium acetate solution , ph 6.0 , the reaction was continued using the glucose oxidase - diaminobenzidine - nickel method .
the sections were finally washed by 0.2 m sodium acetate solution .
thereafter , the sections were moved to chrome - alum - gelatine - coated slides .
we counterstained air - dry the section with neutral red , dehydrated using a graded alcohol series , cleared in xylene and cover slipped .
bilateral c - fos counting was conducted on a minimum of three representative sections per level in a blind fashion .
the positive cells were counted under x200 magnification from the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex .
using light microscopy , c - fos - positive neurons were identified by dense brown nuclear staining and captured with a nikon digital camera ( eclipse 50i microsope : nikon , japan ) .
the counting c - fos was blind to experimental conditions .
brain regions were confirmed using the mouse brain atlas .
these counts were averaged for five to eight sections in each region for each animal .
measurement of bdnf levels by elisa enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) was performed with the bdnf emax immunoassay system kit ( promega inc. , madison , wi , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions 10 , 15 .
elisa plates ( 96 well ; nunc maxisorp , ebioscience , san diego , ca , usa ) were coated with 100 mul / well of anti - bdnf monoclonal antibody ( mab ) and incubated overnight ( 4degreesc ) .
the incubation of plates was performed in a block and sample buffer ( room temperature , 1 hr ) .
we added samples to the coated wells ( 100 mul ) and shook it for 2 hrs .
the antigen was incubated ( anti - human bdnf polyclonal antibody , 2 hrs , room temperature ) with shaking and then incubated with an anti - igy antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( 1 hr , room temperature ) .
we incubated plates for 15 min .
( tetramethylbenzidine solution ) and added 1 m hydrochloric acid ( hcl ) to the wells .
the reaction products determined by the colorimetric were calculated ( 450 nm ) .
the standard curves from each plate were plotted .
bdnf level was calculated from the regression line for the bdnf standard ( ranging from 7.8 to 500 pg / ml purified mouse bdnf ) .
sections values were above 16 pg / ml for each plate .
this experiment method was reported by our previous studies 10 , 15 .
statistical analyses all data are expressed as the mean +/ - s.e.m. we analysed the data using a one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) .
when significant differences were observed , post hoc comparisons within logical sets of means were carried out using tukey 's test .
a p - value of 0.05 is considered on the borderline of statistical significance .

furthermore , the antidepressant - like effects of 9 hrs fasting were inhibited by the 5 - ht2a / 2c agonist doi .
these findings were consistent with our studies previously 4 .
in addition , we have found that the inhibitory effects of doi on acute fasting - induced antidepressant effects were also reversed by the 5 - ht2a receptor antagonist ketanserin .
this evidence suggests that the antidepressant - like effects of acute fasting may be exerted via 5 - ht2a receptors .
to explore the structural basis on the mechanism of antidepressant - like effects induced by 9 hrs fasting .
in current study , c - fos expression was investigated in depression - related brain regions .
c - fos expression was increased by 9 hrs fasting in prefrontal cortex ( prl , cg1 and il regions ) but not hippocampus ( ca1 , ca2 , ca3 and dg ) and habenular .
a large number of studies have shown that these brain regions ( prefrontal cortex , hippocampus and habenular ) are suggested to play important roles in depression 6 , 11 , 21 , 22 .
in this study 9 hrs fasting - induced c - fos expression was significantly further enhanced by doi in prefrontal cortex ( prl , cg1 and il regions ) , and these effects were also inhibited by ketanserin .
taken together , these data reveal that prefrontal cortex may be the major brain region on the mechanism of the antidepressant - like effects of acute fasting via 5 - ht2a receptors .
in our study , imipramine was used as positive control drug .
we have found that c - fos expression was enhanced by imipramine in hippocampus , frontal cortex and habenular .
these data are partially consistent with our previous report that c - fos expression was induced by imipramine in the prefrontal cortex 6 .
these data also indicate that imipramine appears to be more influential on c - fos expression in these brain regions compared to acute fasting .
in addition , pan et al. reported that caloric restriction increased bdnf levels in hippocampus and cortex regions , while decreasing bdnf expression in hindbrain and hypothalamic regions that regulate feeding and metabolic efficiency 19 .
another finding also showed that bdnf protein levels decreased after 48 hrs fasting and increased after re - feeding 23 .
these results suggest that fasting or caloric restriction has various effects on bdnf levels in different brain regions .
these interesting data made us further explore whether bdnf expression was also affected by 9 hrs fasting in frontal cortex and hippocampus .
in our study , bdnf levels were significantly elevated by 9 hrs fasting in hippocampus and frontal cortex , and increased bdnf levels were also inhibited by doi .
furthermore , these effects of doi were also significantly reversed by ketanserin .
previously , we also have reported that 9 hrs fasting also enhanced the ratio of p - creb / creb in the frontal cortex and hippocampus 4 .
therefore , these results , combined with our previous data , suggest that the antidepressant - like effects of acute fasting may be mediated by creb - bdnf pathway in frontal cortex and hippocampus circuit .
fasting can help protect against many brain diseases , such as epilepsy , alzheimer and others .
our findings also suggest that the antidepressant - like effects of acute fasting may be exerted via 5 - ht2a receptor and particularly sensitive to neural activity in the frontal cortex .
furthermore , these antidepressant - like effects were mediated by creb - bdnf pathway in frontal cortex and hippocampus .
taken together , these findings suggest that fasting may be potentially helpful against depression .

copper metabolism murr1 domain 1 ( commd1 ) protein is a multifunctional protein , and its expression has been correlated with patients' survival in different types of cancer .
in vitro studies revealed that commd1 plays a role in sensitizing cancer cell lines to cisplatin , however , the mechanism and its role in platinum sensitivity in cancer has yet to be established .
we evaluated the role of commd1 in cisplatin sensitivity in a2780 ovarian cancer cells and the relation between commd1 expression and response to platinum - based therapy in advanced stage high - grade serous ovarian cancer ( hgsoc ) patients .
we found that elevation of nuclear commd1 expression sensitized a2780 ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin - mediated cytotoxicity .
this was accompanied by a more effective g2 / m checkpoint , and decreased protein expression of the dna repair gene brca1 , and the apoptosis inhibitor bcl2 .
furthermore , commd1 expression was immunohistochemically analyzed in two tissue micro - arrays ( tmas ) , representing a historical cohort and a randomized clinical trial - based cohort of advanced stage hgsoc tumor specimens .
expression of commd1 was observed in all ovarian cancer samples , however , specifically nuclear expression of commd1 was only observed in a subset of ovarian cancers .
in our historical cohort , nuclear commd1 expression was associated with an improved response to chemotherapy ( or = 0.167 ; p = 0.038 ) , although this association could not be confirmed in the second cohort , likely due to sample size .
taken together , these results suggest that nuclear expression of commd1 sensitize ovarian cancer to cisplatin , possibly by modulating the g2 / m checkpoint and through controlling expression of genes involved in dna repair and apoptosis .

introduction copper metabolism murr1 domain 1 ( commd1 ) protein is a small ubiquitously expressed protein , which has been shown to effect tumor cell behavior and survival [ 1 - 4 ] .
according to the oncomine database , commd1 is differentially expressed in multiple cancer types [ 5 ] , and decreased commd1 expression in endometrial cancer tissue was shown to correlate with a worse overall survival [ 1 ] .
one of the proposed mechanisms of commd1 in mediating the behavior of cancer involves its inhibitory action on the activity of the transcription factors hypoxia inducible factor 1 ( hif - 1 ) and nuclear factor kappa - light - chain - enhancer of activated b cells ( nf - kappab ) [ 1,4 ] .
hif - 1 and nf - kappab both have a significant role in tumor behavior and clinical outcome , including ovarian cancer [ 6 - 8 ] .
expression of commd1 is predominantly observed in the cytoplasm of most cell types , although an important role for commd1 in the nucleus has been revealed [ 9 - 11 ] .
in complex with an e3 ubiquitin ligase , nuclear commd1 promotes the proteasomal degradation of the nf - kappab subunit p65 , which leads to inhibition of transcriptional activity of nf - kappab [ 12 - 18 ] .
commd1 also represses hif - 1 activity [ 19,20 ] , and elevated nuclear commd1 expression augments its inhibitory effect on both nf - phi06bb and hif - mediated transcription [ 10 ] .
additionally , nuclear commd1 was suggested to participate in the cellular response to dna damage , through its ability to interact with the dna repair proteins breast cancer 1 early onset ( brca1 ) , brca1 - associated ring domain protein 1 ( bard1 ) and checkpoint kinase 2 ( chk2 ) [ 3 ] .
furthermore , ablation of commd1 resulted in increased sensitivity to dna - damaging agents , including cisplatin , in several cell lines [ 3,21 ] .
the exact mechanism underlying this effect , and whether commd1 expression levels are associated with the response to platinum - based therapy in cancer patients remains unclear .
in this study , we investigated the role of commd1 in cisplatin sensitivity , and assessed commd1 expression in two cohorts of patients treated for advanced stage ovarian cancer .
we show that increased levels of nuclear commd1 affect cisplatin sensitivity in ovarian cancer cells in vitro , and that nuclear commd1 expression in ovarian cancer tumor tissue is associated with improved response to cisplatin treatment in one out of two analyzed patient cohorts .

viability assay to measure cell viability 2,000 cells were plated in 96 - well plates ( triplicates for each condition ) .
24 hours after plating , cells were treated either with control medium or medium containing cisplatin ( tocris ) at indicated concentrations for 72 hours .
after incubation , 20 mul of 5 mg / ml mtt ( 3 - ( 4,5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2,5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide ) was added for 3 hours .
subsequently , culture medium was removed , and cells were incubated in dimethyl sulphoxide ( dmso ) for 30 minutes .
absorbance was measured at 520 nm using a biorad microplate reader .
viability was measured by calculating relative mtt conversion .
mtt conversion of cells treated with control medium was used as a reference .
flow cytometry a2780 - ev and a2780 - commd1 cells were harvested after 24 hours of incubation with 2 mum cisplatin and fixed in ice - cold 70 % ethanol .
cells were stained with mouse anti - phospho - ser10 - histone h3 antibody and with rabbit anti - phospho - ser139 - h2ax and subsequently stained with alexa - 488 - conjugated anti - mouse and alexa - 647 - conjugated anti - rabbit antibody .
in addition , counterstaining was performed with propidium iodide / rnase ( sigma - aldrich ) .
cell cycle distribution , phospho - histone h3 and anti - phospho - h2ax positivity were analyzed on a facscalibur ( becton dickinson biosciences ) equipped with cellquest software .
per sample , at least 10,000 events were analyzed , and indicated results show averages and standard deviations of three independent experiments .

one microgram of rna was used to prepare cdna with the transcriptor universal cdna master ( roche ) , according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer .
20 ng cdna was used for subsequent quantitative real - time pcr ( qrt - pcr ) analysis using faststart sybr green master ( roche ) and 7900ht fast real - time pcr system ( applied biosystems ) .
the following pcr program was used : 50degreesc / 2 minutes , 95degreesc / 10 minutes , 40 cycles of 95degreesc / 15 seconds and 60degreesc / 1 minute .
expression data were analyzed using sds 2.3 software ( applied biosystems ) , using the ' standard curve ' method of calculation .
gapdh expression was used as an internal control .
primer sequences are listed in s1 table .
patients two previously described ovarian cancer tissue microarrays ( tma1 and tma2 ) were analyzed in this study [ 23,24 ] .
tma1 includes retrospectively collected data and was used as an exploratory tma , whereas tma2 includes prospectively collected data and was used to validate our observations from tma1 .
concerning tma1 : between april 1988 and may 2006 , 354 patients were treated in the university medical center groningen ( umcg ) for ovarian cancer .
tumor tissues of 232 patients were included on tma1 as described previously [ 25 ] .
for this study , follow - up data of these patients were updated and new patients ( treated between 2002 and 2006 ) were additionally included .
126 of these patients were diagnosed with advanced stage hgsoc , and chemo - naive tumor tissue of these patients was used for exploratory immunohistochemical analysis .
after primary surgery , patients received platinum - based chemotherapy ( cisplatin or carboplatin , with or without a taxane ) .
tissue collection and storage of clinicopathological and follow up data was only performed upon patients' approval via informed consent .
clinical data was collected in the umcg and stored digitally in a central database , which is solely accessible by two dedicated data managers .
statistical analysis was performed with an anonymized dataset extracted from the central database .
protection of patient identity was thereby warranted and according to dutch law no further institutional review board approval was necessary .
patient staging was done according to the figo ( international federation of gynaecology and obstetrics ) criteria .
tumor grading and classification was determined by a gynecological pathologist .
when sufficient tumor tissue and complete follow up information was available , patient data were considered suitable for inclusion for analysis .
we selected advanced stage ( stage 3 and 4 ) hgsoc patients ( n = 126 ) .
to retrospectively evaluate response to chemotherapy , we defined two groups of patients demonstrating extreme therapy responses ; a ' responder ' and a ' non - responder group ' as previous described [ 25 ] .
patients with advanced stage hgsoc , >= 2 cm residual disease after debulking surgery , adjuvant platinum - based chemotherapy and a progression free survival ( pfs ) of > 18 months were considered ' responders ' .
when pfs was < 6 months , patients were considered ' non - responders ' .
tma2 comprises tumor tissues of patients who were treated as part of a dutch multicenter randomized phase ii study [ 26 ] .
the clinical trial of which patient material was included on tma2 was registered as ntr1491 in the publically accessible dutch trial registry ( trialregister.nl ) , part of the dutch cochrane centre .
details and results of this study were published in [ 26 ] .
data were prospectively collected .
in this study , patients were treated with carboplatin / docetaxel and randomized to celecoxib ( twice daily 400 mg ) or a placebo treatment .
in short , patients with histopathological conformation of epithelial ovarian cancer , fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinomas , figo ic - iv , were included .
the primary study objectives were response rate and pfs .
response rate was determined using ca125 levels and the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors ( recist version 1.0 ). between march 2003 and november 2008 , a total of 202 patients enrolled the study , of which 196 were eventually included for statistical analysis .
written informed consent was provided before patients were included .
no differences in patient outcome between the two study arms were observed .
sufficient tumor specimens of 121 out of 196 patients were available for immunohistochemical analysis. of these patients , 67 were diagnosed with advanced stage hgsoc .
to test our hypothesis from tma1 , a ' responder ' and a ' non - responder ' group was defined in a similar way as for tma2 .
however , instead of 2 cm residual disease after debulking surgery , the presence of residual disease was used as a metric for response to treatment .
for the patients obtained from the umcg in the netherlands , patients gave informed consent for collection and storage of tissue samples in a tissue bank for future research .
all relevant patient data were retrieved and transferred into an anonymous , password - protected , database .
the patients' identity was protected by study - specific , unique patient codes and their true identity was only known to two dedicated data managers .
according to dutch regulations , these precautions meant no further institutional review board approval was needed ( http :// www.federa.org /) .
tma1 is not prospectively collected , tma2 is prospectively collected , but not for the purpose of this study. from the co - authors , anna k.l. reyners and ate g.j. van der zee are treating physicians , although they did not treat all patients themselves .
immunohistochemistry tma1 and tma2 were constructed as previously described [ 23,24,26 ] .
for immunohistochemistry , 4 mum sections were de - paraffinized in xylene .
subsequently , antigen retrieval was performed by 15 minutes boiling in tris / edta ( ph 9.0 ) buffer .
endogenous peroxidase was blocked by 0.3 % hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes .
commd1 was stained using mouse monoclonal anti - commd1 ( 1:50 ; clone 3b3 ; abcam , ab131597 ) .
detection was conducted using a horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) conjugated secondary rabbit anti - mouse antibody ( 1:100 ; dako ; p0260 ) and a hrp - conjugated tertiary goat anti - rabbit antibody ( 1:100 ; dako ; p0448 ) .
staining was visualized with 3'3 - diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and counterstained with hematoxylin .
hek293t and hela cell lines , in which commd1 expression was stably depleted using shrna - mediated commd1 knockdown , were used as negative controls for immunohistochemistry [ 1 ] .
cells were embedded in paraffin , sliced in 4 mum sections and subsequently mounted on amino - propyl - ethoxy - silan - coated glass slides .
slides were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti - commd1 ( 1:100 ; clone 3b3 ; abcam ; ab131597 ) following the similar protocol as described above .
twenty - one randomly selected tumor samples from ovarian cancer patients were used to stain whole section for exploratory analysis of commd1 immunohistochemistry ( fig 1c ) .
statistical analysis of this group of staining was not performed due to small samples size , and because these tumors are also part of tma1 .

( d ) quantification workflow of immunohistochemical commd1 staining .
image analysis was performed using the imagej - based software package fiji .
dab staining and hematoxylin staining were deconvoluted and images were subsequently converted into 8 - bit gray scale images .
hematoxylin staining was used to define cytoplasm / nucleus boundaries .
vectors were subsequently used to measure dab staining intensities across cells and quantify nuclear commd1 levels in relation to cytoplasmic levels .
( b ) three ' nuclear commd1 - negative ' ( n = 10 cells per tumor sample ) and three ' nuclear commd1 - positive ' tumor samples were analyzed .
averages and standard deviations are indicated .
relative nuclear commd1 levels to cytoplasmic levels are plotted per tumor sample .
for semi - quantitative analysis , immunohistochemical slides were scanned on a hamamatsu nanozoomer , and saved as tiff files .
image analysis was subsequently performed using the imagej - based software package fiji [ 27 ] .
3,3 ' - diaminobenzidine ( dab ) staining and hematoxylin staining were deconvoluted using ' colour deconvolution ' with ' h dab ' settings .
images were subsequently converted into 8 - bit gray scale images and inverted .
values of dab staining were left unaltered , whereas hematoxylin staining was contrast enhanced to define cytoplasm / nucleus boundaries .
vectors with a length of ~ 100 pixels were subsequently used to measure dab staining intensities across cells .
evaluation of staining cytoplasmic and nuclear commd1 expression levels were semi - quantitative scored by two independent observers ( af and hww ) as previously described [ 28 ] .
patients were included for statistical analysis if >= 2 cores ( out of 4 ) were evaluable for commd1 expression .
observers had a concordance in scores in > 90 % of the cases .
discordances in scoring were reviewed by af and hww to reach consensus for a definitive score .
the total immunoreactive score ( irs , 0 - 8 ) was constituted by adding the score of staining intensity ( 0 - 3 ) with the percentage of tumor stained ( 0 - 5 ) .
staining intensity was scored as negative ( 0 ) , weak positive ( 1 ) , positive ( 2 ) , strong positive ( 3 ) .
subsequently , percentage of tumor cells stained was scored as 0 % ( 0 ) , 0 - 5 % ( 1 ) , 5 - 25 % ( 2 ) , 25 - 50 % ( 3 ) , 50 - 75 % ( 4 ) , > 75 % ( 5 ) .
scores for cytoplasmic commd1 were arbitrary divided into ' low ' ( irs = 0 - 6 ) and ' high ' ( irs >= 7 ) , while scores for nuclear commd1 were divided in negative ( irs = 0 ) and positive ( irs >= 1 ) .
statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using spss 22.0 for windows ( ibm ) and were previously described [ 23 - 25 ] .
in short , in tma1 logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between cytoplasmic / nuclear commd1 expression and patient characteristics .
survival analyses for disease - specific survival ( dss ) and pfs were performed using the cox proportional hazards model .
none of the variables violated the proportional hazards assumption .
in tma1 dss was defined as time from primary ( debulking ) surgery to death caused by ovarian cancer or last follow up alive .
pfs was defined as time from primary surgery to progression / relapse of the disease , death , or last follow up. median follow - up for the 126 hgsoc patients was 21 months .
only p - values <= 0.10 in the univariate analysis were included for multivariate analysis if applicable .
for tma2 , we performed similar analysis as for tma1 .
in vitro data shown were derived from three independent experiments +/ - standard error of the means ( sem ) .
analyses were performed using graphpad version 6.05 ( graphpad software ) .
student 's t - test was used to test the significance .
for all experiments a p - value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant .
results commd1 expression in human ovarian tumor samples to assess the expression of commd1 in ovarian tumors , we first determined the specificity of the anti - commd1 antibody in hela and hek293t cell lines , which were stable depleted for commd1 ( fig 1a and 1b ) [ 1,19 ] .
in contrast to the control cells , almost no staining of commd1 was detected in commd1 - depleted cells ( fig 1a ) .
these results certified the specificity of our immunohistochemical staining of commd1 .
next , we stained commd1 in a panel of whole sections of ovarian cancer tissues ( n = 21 , fig 1c ) , and observed commd1 expression in all samples .
interestingly , however , we detected a marked nuclear expression of commd1 in a subset of cancer tissue samples , in addition to cytoplasmic staining of commd1 ( fig 1c ) .
using semi - quantitative analysis of commd1 immunohistochemical stainings ( fig 1d ) , we indeed found consistently lower levels of nuclear commd1 in ' nuclear commd1 - negative ' tumor samples when compared to ' nuclear commd1 - positive ' tumor samples ( fig 1e ) .
increased nuclear expression of commd1 sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin treatment the differential subcellular expression of commd1 in ovarian cancer , together with the notion that nuclear commd1 inhibits nf - kappab and hif activity and that commd1 might have a function in dna damage response prompted us to evaluate whether nuclear commd1 affects the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin [ 3,10 ] .
to this end , we stably overexpressed flag - tagged commd1 in a2780 ovarian cancer cells .
we previously showed that the flag tag does not interfere with commd1 function , as flag - tagged commd1 can rescue the lethal phenotype of commd1 - / - mice [ 29 ] .
stable overexpression of commd1 - flag in a2780 cells resulted in a 2.6 - fold increase in cytosolic expression ( fig 2a ) and 5.9 - fold increase in nuclear commd1 levels compared to control - transfected cells ( a2780 - ev ) , in which commd1 is predominantly cytoplasmic ( fig 2a ) .
indirect immunofluorescence staining validated this increase in nuclear commd1 levels ( fig 2b ) .
in the control cells we observed cytoplasmic vesicular localization of commd1 and a very weak nuclear staining , similar as previously reported for other cell lines [ 9 - 11,29 ] .
however , in addition to a vesicular commd1 localization , a2780 - commd1 cells also showed a significant increase in nuclear commd1 expression ( fig 2b ) .
since the expression of commd1 was predominantly increased in the nucleus of a2780 - commd1 cells , we reasoned that these cells reflect the tumors with elevated nuclear commd1 expression ( fig 1c ) and therefore represent an elegant model to study the role of aberrant commd1 expression on cisplatin sensitivity .
control a2780 cells ( ev ) , and cells with high nuclear commd1 levels were treated with different concentrations of cisplatin for 72 hours after which the viability of cells was measured by mtt conversion .
stable nuclear commd1 expression resulted in decreased cell viability after treatment with 0.5 - 10 mum cisplatin ( fig 2c ) .
although to a lesser extend , similar results were seen in the ovarian cancer cell line peo14 in which we stably increased commd1 expression ( fig 2d ) .
this mild effect is likely due to the relative lower overall and nuclear increase in commd1 levels ( fig 2e ) compared to a2780 - commd1 cells ( fig 2a ) .
next , we determined the commd1 levels in a2780 / cp70 cells , an ovarian cancer cell line , which is 13 - fold more resistant to cisplatin than a2780 cells [ 30 ] .
a2780 / cp70 cells have reduced cytosolic and nuclear commd1 levels compared to a2780 cells ( s1 fig ) .
to assess the effect of commd1 reduction in cisplatin sensitivity we decreased the commd1 levels by shrna , which diminished cisplatin sensitivity of a2780 cells ( fig 2f ) .
taken together , these results show that nuclear levels of commd1 are associated with cisplatin sensitivity in ovarian cancer cells .

* : p < 0.05 elevated nuclear commd1 expression ameliorates g2 / m cell cycle checkpoint function upon cisplatin treatment the fact that commd1 can interact with nuclear brct domain - containing proteins , led us to hypothesize that commd1 may play a role in the dna damage response .
therefore , we assessed the effect of increased nuclear expression of commd1 on the level of dna damage and cell cycle checkpoint behavior in response to cisplatin .
the level of dna breaks upon cisplatin treatment , as judged by gamma - h2ax foci formation , was not significantly different between the two cell lines ( fig 3a and 3b ) .
next , the contribution of nuclear commd1 on cell cycle checkpoint function was determined .
first , proliferation rates of the control ( ev ) and a2780 - commd1 cells were studied .
as shown in fig 3c , the proliferation rate was not affected by increased expression of nuclear commd1 .
however , as expected , cisplatin treatment ( 2 mum , 24 hours ) resulted in accumulation of cells in s phase , which was more pronounced in a2780 - commd1 cells compared to control cells ( fig 3c and 3d ) .
second , the percentage of cells that entered mitosis , as judged by the phosphorylation level of histone - h3 , was determined .
after 24 hours of cisplatin treatment , a marked cell cycle arrest at g2 phase was observed in both cell lines ( fig 3e and 3f ) , but the percentage of mitotic cells was further decreased by elevated nuclear commd1 expression ( fig 3e and 3f ) .
these results indicate that increased commd1 expression , along with elevated nuclear commd1 , ameliorates g2 / m checkpoint function in response to cisplatin treatment .

cisplatin - induced apoptosis is increased in ovarian cancer cells with elevated levels of nuclear commd1 since apoptosis is the major process contributing to cell death induced by dna damaging agents [ 31 ] , we evaluated whether cells with higher nuclear commd1 expression levels more efficiently undergo apoptosis after cisplatin - mediated dna damage .
the apoptotic markers cleaved caspase - 3 and cleaved parp - 1 were higher in a2780 - commd1 compared to control cells after 24h of cisplatin treatment ( fig 4a ) .
next , we analyzed the expression of the anti - apoptotic proteins bcl2 and xiap .
independent of cisplatin treatment , we found that both protein and mrna levels of bcl2 were significantly lower ( fig 4a , 4b and 4c ) .
also , the mrna levels of xiap , a direct inhibitor of caspase - 3 , were reduced , independently of cisplatin treatment ( fig 4c ) .
however , the protein levels of xiap were not significantly decreased ( fig 4a and 4b ) .
furthermore , upon cisplatin incubation , a significant reduction in mrna and protein levels of the dna repair gene brca1 was observed in a2780 - commd1 cells ( fig 4a , 4b and 4c ) .
altogether , these results suggest that increased commd1 levels , including elevated commd1 levels , causes impaired expression of the indicated anti - apoptotic and dna repair genes , which is accompanied by increased apoptosis after cisplatin treatment .

( e ) proposed model of how chemosensitivity for cisplatin is regulated by nuclear commd1 in a2780 ev and commd1 ovarian cancer cells .
commd1 expression in advanced stage hgsoc patients given the nuclear expression of commd1 in a subgroup of ovarian cancer patients ( fig 1c ) and increased cisplatin sensitivity of ovarian a2780 cancer cells with elevated nuclear commd1 levels ( fig 2c ) , we explored whether the expression and subcellular localization of commd1 in ovarian tumors correlated with patient outcome .
to this end , we assessed the cytoplasmic and nuclear commd1 expression in chemo - naive tumor samples of 126 retrospectively selected advanced stage hgsoc patients ( tissue microarray # 1 , tma1 ). of note , the tumor samples analyzed in fig 1c are representing tma1 .
in 94 % of these tumor samples , commd1 expression was detected. of those tumors with positive commd1 expression , cytoplasmic commd1 staining was readily detected (> 75 % of tumor cells stained positive ) in all patients and only differed in intensity .
we observed ' high ' cytoplasmic expression in 43 / 120 ( 35.8 %) patients , and nuclear expression of commd1 in 64 / 118 ( 54.2 %) patients .
representative immunohistochemical stainings of cytoplasmic and nuclear commd1 are shown in fig 5a .
patient characteristics are summarized s2 table .

( b ) representative immunohistochemical stainings of cytoplasmic and nuclear commd1 of responders ( n = 3 ) and non - responders ( n = 3 ) .
during the follow up period , 95 / 126 ( 75.4 %) patients died because of ovarian cancer .
analysis of the entire patient group showed that high cytoplasmic or nuclear commd1 staining was not correlated with disease - specific survival ( dss ) and progression - free survival ( pfs ) in univariate cox regression analysis ( s3 table ) .
residual disease of >= 2 cm after primary surgery was related with both dss ( hr = 1.755 ; p = 0.016 ) and pfs ( hr 1.558 ; p = 0.045 ) .
we found no association ( or 0.257 ; p = 0.142 ) between ' high ' cytoplasmic commd1 staining and chemotherapy response ( table 1 ) .
however , using subgroup analysis , nuclear commd1 expression was significantly less frequently observed in the non - responders group ( or = 0.167 ; p = 0.038 ) in this exploratory tma1 ( table 1 ) .
representative immunohistochemical stainings of cytoplasmic and nuclear commd1 of responders ( n = 3 ) and non - responders ( n = 3 ) ( fig 5b ) .
this result suggests that nuclear commd1 is related with improved response to chemotherapy in a subgroup of advanced stage hgsoc patients .

this patient cohort ( n = 67 ) was prospectively collected as part of a clinical study ( ntr1491 ) .
in 24 tumors , positive nuclear commd1 ( 35.8 %) was seen , whereas in 33 tumors no nuclear commd1 staining was observed ( 49.3 %) .
using cox regression analysis , no prognostic value of nuclear commd1 expression was found ( dss : hr = 1.396 , p = 0.360 ; pfs : hr = 1.016 , p = 0.960 ) ( table 2 ) .
to investigate whether nuclear commd1 in this patient cohort was associated with tumor response to chemotherapy as suggested from the exploratory tma1 data , associations between nuclear commd1 were again analyzed in a subset of patients with distinct favorable or poor therapy responses. of the 13 patients included in this analysis , 10 patients were considered as ' responders '. of these ' responders ' , 7 patients showed no nuclear commd1 expression , while 3 patients did .
the 3 ' non - responders' showed nuclear commd1 expression .
due to the small amounts of patients and the absence of non - responders without nuclear commd1 expression in tma2 , no statistically meaningful analysis could be performed on this specific patient group .

the observation that elevated expression of commd1 in the nucleus is related to responses to cisplatin is fascinating , since commd1 is predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm of most cell types [ 9 - 11 ] .
interestingly , its nuclear expression can be actively controlled via a nuclear export signal ( nes ) in an exportin 1 ( crm1 ) - dependent manner [ 10 ] , indicating that under certain conditions the levels of nuclear commd1 can be tightly regulated .
the relation between subcellular commd1 localization and response of ovarian cancer patients to therapy and survival was not established previously .
to our knowledge this is the first study that suggests a link between nuclear commd1 levels and therapy response .
in our exploratory patient cohort ( tma1 ) , we observed in a subgroup of advanced stage hgsoc patients an association between nuclear commd1 expression and response to therapy .
since the exploratory tma1 was retrospectively collected , we wished to validate our findings in an independent patient cohort .
we therefore analyzed tumor material of hgsoc patients from the docacel study ( ntr1491 ) .
unfortunately , due to the limited number of available patient tumor specimens , we were unable to test our hypothesis in a second , study - based tma .
mechanistically , our in vitro data indicated that the improved cisplatin sensitivity by nuclear commd1 is possibly linked to reduced protein expression of the genes brca1 , and bcl2 .
brca1 is a key component of the homologous recombination dna repair pathway , and reduced expression or mutational inactivation of brca1 was reported to increase sensitivity to cisplatin [ 32 ] .
in addition to its role in dna repair , brca1 is also implicated in various other cellular functions , including transcription regulation , a processes which is also involved in the responsiveness of cells to cisplatin .
in this context , brca1 was demonstrated to regulate the expression of the nf - kappab anti - apoptotic target genes bcl2 and xiap , in a fashion dependent on the nf - kappab subunit p50 [ 33 ] .
since commd1 inhibits nf - kappab activity and can interact with brca1 , it is tempting to speculate that nuclear commd1 represses the brca1 - p50 mediated transcription of bcl2 and xiap and thereby sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin - induced apoptosis ( model in fig 6 ) .
this idea is further supported by the observation that nuclear commd1 is important to suppress transcription of nf - kappab target genes [ 10,13 - 15 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0165385.g006 fig 6 model of how commd1 may influence responses to cisplatin .
it has been well established that commd1 also regulates the function of the copper transporters atp7a and atp7b [ 11,21,34 - 37 ] , and both copper transporters have been implicated in cisplatin resistance [ 38 - 41 ] .
the mechanism of atp7a / b mediated cisplatin resistance remains unclear , but it has been postulated that these metal transporters might reduce the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin .
however , we did not observe a significant difference in cisplatin - induced dna damage as judged by gamma - h2ax formation , suggesting that increased commd1 expression does not affect the function of the copper - transporting atpases in intracellular accumulation of cisplatin .
gamma - h2ax foci also reflects dna breaks that are not repaired through brca1 , and since gamma - h2ax remains associated with sites of dna breaks even after repair , which could explain why decreased brca1 levels upon commd1 overexpression was not associated with altered gamma - h2ax foci numbers .
remarkably , our results on the role of commd1 in cisplatin sensitivity are in contradiction with prior data that demonstrated that reduced levels of commd1 in a breast cancer cell line [ 3 ] and a hepatoma cell line [ 21 ] lead to increased cisplatin sensitivity .
we were able to replicate the enhanced cisplatin sensitivity in the breast cancer cell line mda - mb - 231 upon commd1 silencing ( s2 fig ) , which would indicate that the effects of commd1 on cisplatin response and tumor behavior are cell - type specific .
a cell - type specific role of commd1 in tumor behavior is corroborated by prior studies .
in diffuse large b - cell lymphoma ( dlbcl ) high commd1 expression is correlated with poor prognosis [ 2 ] and is associated with aggressive forms of ( dlbcl ) [ 42 ] .
increased commd1 expression is also common in primary mediastinal b - cell lymphoma ( pmbl ) cells lines and in pmbl patients [ 43 ] .
in contrast , in many other types of cancer ( e.g. seminoma , ovarian , breast , and prostate cancer ) a reduced expression of commd1 has been found .
this decreased commd1 expression is correlated with cancer behavior and reduced survival rate [ 1,4,17,44 ] .
taken together , our data suggest that elevated levels of nuclear commd1 confer a2780 ovarian cancer cells to be more sensitive to platinum - based chemotherapy .
in line with our in vitro data , we found that increased expression of commd1 in the nucleus of ovarian tumors is associated with improved response to cisplatin therapy .
better understanding of the mechanism that regulates nuclear expression of commd1 is required and might uncover novel therapeutic targets to improve cellular responses to platinum - based chemotherapeutics .

it requires multiple breath - holds to cover the entire ventricles , thus being prone to misalignment of consecutive slices , time consuming and dependent on breath - hold ( bh ) capability .
real - time cine avoids those limitations , however poor spatial and temporal resolution of conventional sequences have prevented its routine application .
we sought to examine if a newly developed real - time sequence featuring compressed sensing and iterative reconstruction ( cine - rt ) , which is an investigational prototype , would yield similar results when compared with conventional cine - ssfp in a group of healthy volunteers .
methods stacks of short - axis cines were acquired covering both ventricles in a 1.5t system ( magnetom aera , siemens , germany ) , using gold standard cine - ssfp and cine - rt. acquisition parameters for cine - ssfp were : voxel size 1,6 x 1,6 x 7,0 mm , grappa acceleration factor of 2 , temporal resolution of 39 ms , retrospective gating , with an average of 8 heart beats per slice and 1 slice / bh. for cine - rt : voxel size 1,6 x 1,6 x 7,0 mm , compressed sensing acceleration factor of 10 , temporal resolution of 41 ms , prospective gating , real - time acquisition of 1 heart - beat / slice and all slices in one bh. cine - rt images were repeated three times using different degrees of iterations ( 40 , 60 and 80 ) to explore the accuracy vs. reconstruction time relationship .
left and right ventricle contours were blindly drawn by an experienced observer at end diastole and systole to derive volumes and lv mass .
comparisons were made using pearson 's correlation coefficients and bland - altman plots .
results eight healthy volunteers ( 4 male ; 35.2 +/ - 4.5 years ) were examined in the same day .
all subjects were in sinus rhythm and all images were considered to have diagnostic quality ( figure 1 ) .
cine - rt derived volumes and mass correlated with gold standard cine - ssfp , with small biases .
higher amounts of reconstruction iterations from 40 to 80 were related to decreased measurement biases .
table 1 summarizes all results and comparisons .

conclusions in our small pilot study of normal volunteers , cine - rt with compressed sensing and iterative reconstruction with 1 heart beat per slice achieved spatial and temporal resolutions equivalent to cine - ssfp , yielding correlated measures of ventricular volumes and mass .
higher number of iterations seem to provide more accurate results .

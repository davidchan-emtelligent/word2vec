fgf21 is a novel secreted protein with robust anti - diabetic , anti - obesity , and anti - atherogenic activities in preclinical species .
in the current study , we investigated the signal transduction pathways downstream of fgf21 following acute administration of the growth factor to mice .
focusing on adipose tissues , we identified fgf21 - mediated downstream signaling events and target engagement biomarkers .
specifically , rna profiling of adipose tissues and phosphoproteomic profiling of adipocytes , following fgf21 treatment revealed several specific changes in gene expression and post - translational modifications , specifically phosphorylation , in several relevant proteins .
affymetrix microarray analysis of white adipose tissues isolated from both c57bl / 6 ( fed either regular chow or hfd ) and db / db mice identified over 150 robust potential rna transcripts and over 50 potential secreted proteins that were changed greater than 1.5 fold by fgf21 acutely .
phosphoprofiling analysis identified over 130 phosphoproteins that were modulated greater than 1.5 fold by fgf21 in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes .
bioinformatic analysis of the combined gene and phosphoprotein profiling data identified a number of known metabolic pathways such as glucose uptake , insulin receptor signaling , erk / mapk signaling cascades , and lipid metabolism .
moreover , a number of novel events with hitherto unknown links to fgf21 signaling were observed at both the transcription and protein phosphorylation levels following treatment .
we conclude that such a combined " omics " approach can be used not only to identify robust biomarkers for novel therapeutics but can also enhance our understanding of downstream signaling pathways ; in the example presented here , novel fgf21 - mediated signaling events in adipose tissue have been revealed that warrant further investigation .

introduction fgf21 is expressed in multiple metabolic tissues ( liver , pancreas , and adipose , among other tissues [ 1 ]) .
moreover , fgf21 increases glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity while decreasing gluconeogenesis , lipogenesis and circulating cholesterol levels in multiple pre - clinical animal models when administered pharmacologically [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] .
fasting and ketogenic conditions induce hepatic expression of fgf21 through pparalpha [ 6 ] [ 7 ] , while its expression is induced in adipose tissues by ppargamma activation [ 8 ] [ 9 ] .
fgf21 binds to fibroblast growth factor receptors ( fgfrs ) complexed with the co - receptor betaklotho ( klb ) and signals through phosphorylation cascades involving frs2a and erk / mapk leading to transcriptional changes of several metabolic genes [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] .
phosphorylation of gsk - 3 , shp2 , mek1 / 2 , and stat3 following fgf21 treatment of 3t3l1 adipocytes has been reported [ 13 ] .
there is growing evidence suggesting that fgf21 signaling specifically in adipose tissue is crucial for its beneficial metabolic effects .
for example , fgfr1 and betaklotho expression in adipose tissues , and downstream fgf21 signaling , are required for at least part of fgf21 's acute insulin - sensitizing and glucose uptake effects in mice [ 14,15 ] .
in support of this observation , fgf21 displays impaired glucose - and triglyceride - lowering efficacy in lipodystrophic mice [ 16 ] .
recent reports have identified adiponectin as a key mediator of fgf21 's effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in mice [ 17,18 ] .
in addition , administration of fgf21 has been shown to induce weight loss [ 3 ] [ 12 ] [ 19 ] and white adipose browning [ 20 ] in several pre - clinical animal models .
in order to further our understanding of fgf21 signaling downstream of receptor activation in mouse adipose tissues , we have used unbiased transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic profiling to quantify transcripts and phosphoproteins that are modulated after acute fgf21 treatment .
for our studies , we used both native fgf21 protein ( wt fgf21 ) and a pegylated form that increases its half - life [ 5 ] while displaying acute efficacy in terms of normalizing insulin - stimulated glucose uptake in insulin - resistant mice [ 21 ] .
in addition to affecting known signaling cascades and metabolic pathways , fgf21 treatment also resulted in the phosphorylation and regulation of many novel proteins and transcripts with hitherto unknown links to fgf21 signal transduction pathways .

statistical analysis gene expression data were processed using the rma pipeline in the rosetta resolver software ( microsoft , redmond , wa ) to obtain the mas5 p values .
one - way and n - way anova analyses were performed with matlab ( the mathworks , natick , ma ) .
for 1 - way anova analysis , probe sets had to pass a pre - filter of affymetrix mas5 present call p - value < 0.05 in > 50 % of the samples to qualify for further analysis .
average fold changes between compound and vehicle treatment groups were generated with the vehicle as baseline .
differentially expressed probe sets ( signature genes ) were selected by applying 1.2 fold change ( up - and down - regulated ) and 1 - way anova p value < 0.05 .
n - way anova analysis was performed by incorporating all fgf21 treatments for 2 days and 5 days and mouse stains / disease models ( db / db , wt chow and wt hfd ) by using the following fitting equation : geneexpression = c + alpha * fgf21 + beta * animal + gamma * day + interaction terms + epsilon .

results gene expression changes in white adipose tissues ( wat ) to identify genes robustly regulated by fgf21 acutely in white adipose tissues ( wat ) we used 3 wat depots ( iwat , ewat , and rpwat ) and three mouse models ( wt - chow , wt - hfd , and db / db - chow ) treated with fgf21 either acutely or sub - chronically .
terminal ambient blood glucose levels were significantly decreased in all three mouse models by fgf21 treatment ( from 159 to 135 mg / dl ( wt - chow ) , 186 to 159 mg / dl ( wt - hfd ) , and 512 to 212 mg / dl ( db / db - chow ) , representing vehicle and peg30 - fgf21 q108 2.5 mg / kg treatments respectively at the 5 day time point , ( all p < 0.05 ) ; figure 1 ) .
body weights remained unchanged over the 5 day period .
plasma tg levels were not measured but we have previously found that these are decreased under these conditions after 12 days of treatment [ 5 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0073011.g001 figure 1 fgf21 treatment lowers plasma glucose levels while not affecting body weights .
glucose ( a ) and body weight ( b ) measurements are plotted for each mouse model ( wt chow , wt hfd , and dbdb chow ) across each treatment ( wt fgf21 and 2 doses of peg30 - fgf21 q108 ) .
error bars denote standard error .
asterisks denote significant change compared to vehicle treatment within each mouse model and time point ( students t - test p value < 0.05 ) .
overall responses , in terms of the number of probe sets meeting the 1.2 fold and p < 0.05 cutoff , were comparable between the wat depots although the responses were slightly stronger at the 5 day time point ( compared to the 2 day time point ) , possibly due to increased secondary effects with sub - chronic dosing ( see figure s1 ) .
n - way anova analysis was performed to identify consistent gene expression signatures across a range of time points , treatment paradigms , and mouse model for each independent wat depot .
the averaged numbers of the false positive genes were obtained from 500 times of the monte carlo simulation results , and the false discovery rates for the n - way anova analysis under the stringent cut of p < 0.001 was estimated to be at 1 ~ 2 % level for all three wat depots .
1129 probe sets were identified that had an n - way anova p < 0.001 between fgf21 and vehicle treatments in the three wat depots ( intersection , see table s1 ) .
go term pathway enrichment analysis revealed that genes involved in multiple metabolic processes , cell death , and signaling were significantly represented in this data set ( table s2 ) .
similarly , the ingenuity pathway analysis tool was used to identify canonical pathways that were enriched , which included udp - n - acetyl - d - glucosamine biosynthesis ii , p53 signaling , and triacylglycerol biosynthesis ( table s3 ) .
the genes associated with each go term or canonical pathways are listed in tables s2 and s3 while the gene expression data for a subset of the canonical pathways are shown in table s4 .
these included fgf signaling ( dusp4 and spry4 were up - regulated , while itpr1 , pik3r3 , and map2k6 were down - regulated following fgf21 treatment ) , wnt / beta - catenin signaling ( hdac1 and ppp2r1b were up - regulated while jun , dkk2 , and sfrp5 were down - regulated ) , glucose uptake ( insr , slc1a3 ( glut1 ) and stx6 were up - regulated ) , and amino acid transport ( slc6a9 , slc6a8 , and slc6a13 were down - regulated ) .
four genes in this signature were previously reported to be regulated by fgf21 in wat ( ppargamma , dgat1 , and ucp1 were up - regulated , while ucp3 was down - regulated [ 12 ]) .
some genes only reached maximal expression after sub - chronic treatment ( 5 day time point ) , such as ucp1 ( 12 fold up - regulation in iwat ) and slc1a3 ( glut1 ; 2 fold up - regulation in rpwat ). of the 1129 probe sets , 165 were also significantly regulated at the high dose of peg30 - fgf21 q108 ( 2.5 mg / kg ) acutely ( 2 day ) in iwat of wt - chow fed mice ( at least 1.5 fold change and 1 - way anova p < 0.05 compared to vehicle treatment , table s1 ) .
the top 32 up - and down - regulated probe sets are plotted in figure 2 and figure s2 , and are listed in table 1 , across the three white adipose depots .
genes involved in feedback regulation of fgfr signaling ( dusp4 [ 26 ] and spry4 [ 27 ]) were among the most robustly induced genes acutely , while the expression of several genes involved in lipid metabolism were either increased ( acot4 [ 28 ] and fabp5 [ 29 ]) or decreased ( pnpla3 [ 30 ] and ucp3 [ 31 ]). of note , a few of these genes may be clinically relevant since they showed opposite regulation between a ) fgf21 treatment ( vs vehicle treatment ) , and b ) the " disease " phenotype ( hfd vs chow , or db / db vs wt ) .
for example negr1 was down - regulated in " disease " but up - regulated by fgf21 treatment while sfrp5 was up - regulated by " disease " and down - regulated by fgf21 treatment ( see table s1 and figure s3 ) .

the fold change and 1 - way anova p values for the acute treatment of peg30 - fgf21 q108 ( 2.5 mg / kg ) in ewat and rpwat are included as is the data from the validation study ( qpcr ) .
the 1129 probe sets , from which the 165 were derived , are listed in table s1 .
in an independent in vivo validation study , c57bl / 6 mice ( on chow diet ) were treated with a single injection of peg30 - fgf21 q108 at doses ranging from 0.25 to 2.5 mg / kg and adipose tissues flash frozen at 15 min , 24 hours , and 48 hours post - dose .
blood was collected at the 24 h and 48 h time points .
insulin levels were decreased in a dose - dependent manner at the 24 h and 48 h time points ( from 0.57 to 0.15 ng / ml and from 0.8 to 0.27 ng / ml for the 24 and 48 h time points , respectively ; figure 3 ) .
quantitative pcr analysis of 22 of the top 32 genes was performed using rna from iwat samples at the 24 h time point with 20 of the 22 genes showing regulation by fgf21 in agreement with the microarray study ( table 1 ) .
interestingly , even the lowest dose of peg30 - fgf21 q108 ( 0.25 mg / kg ) in the validation study showed robust regulation of these genes in iwat , highlighting the sensitivity of these markers .
perhaps , this is not surprising since peg30 - fgf21 q108 at this dose ( 0.25 mg / kg ) was recently reported to have beneficial effects in terms of normalizing insulin - stimulated glucose uptake in a diet - induced mouse model of insulin - resistance after acute treatment [ 21 ] .

asterisks denote significant change compared to vehicle treatment within each time point ( students t - test p value < 0.05 * , p < 0.01 **) .
fgf21 transcriptional effects in brown adipose tissue ( bat ) rna from bat was also analyzed by affymetrix microarrays following fgf21 treatment. of the adipose tissues profiled , fgf21 treatment had the most robust effect in bat in terms of the number of probe sets that were statistically significantly changed compared to vehicle treatment , especially at the 5 day time point ( see figure s1 ) .
n - way anova analysis was performed using all the doses of the wt and peg30 - fgf21 q108 in all three mouse models ( wt - chow , wt - hfd , and db / db - chow ) .
approximately 8500 probe sets had n - way anova p < 0.001 of which 1634 were also significantly regulated by the high dose of the peg30 - fgf21 q108 ( 2.5 mg / kg ) acutely ( 2 day ) in bat of wt - chow fed mice ( 1.2 fold change and 1 - way anova p < 0.05 compared to vehicle treatment ( figure 4 and table s5 ) .
enriched canonical pathways from the ingenuity pathway analysis tool included phosphatidylglycerol and triacylglycerol biosynthesis , erk / mapk signaling , and insulin receptor signaling ( see table s6 ) .
robustly regulated genes included sgk2 , dusp4 , spry4 and lcn2 ( up - regulated ) and hspa1a , hspa1b , nr4a1 , nr4a3 , and fosb ( down - regulated ) .
interestingly , the expression levels of the majority of the top 32 fgf21 - regulated genes identified in wat after treatment with fgf21 approached the levels observed in bat ( either up - or down - regulated ) , in support of a white adipose " browning " effect by this treatment ( see figure s4 ) [ 20 ]) .
examples included dusp4 , kcne1l , and sfrp5 ( ucp1 was included in figure s4 as a " browning " control ) .

shown in the clustergram are the 1634 probe sets regulated by a single 2.5mg / kg dose of peg - 30 - fgf21 q108 in wt mice on chow diet .
clustergram properties are the same as in figure 2 .
the 1634 probe sets are listed in table s5 .
blood borne protein validation of gene expression signatures in white adipose tissues more than 6500 probe sets were interrogated in wat , of which approximately 2500 were significantly regulated by the high dose of the peg30 - fgf21 q108 ( 2.5 mg / kg ) acutely ( 2 day ) in at least one of the three wat tissues ( 1.2 fold change and 1 - way anova p < 0.05 ) compared to the corresponding vehicle treatment .
detailed bioinformatics analysis led to the identification of transcripts , from white adipose tissues , which encoded secreted proteins. from the ( differentially regulated ) 2500 probe sets , 334 genes were annotated as secreted proteins ( swissprot keywords or extracellular localization , table s7 ) .
the top 20 up - and down - regulated probe sets are listed in table 2 .
il1rn was added to this list even though the 1 - way anova p values for iwat and ewat were above 0.05 ( they were 0.07 and 0.08 , respectively ) .

the 334 probe sets , from which the 20 were derived , are listed in table s7 .
in an independent in vivo validation study , immunoassays were performed using commercially available antibodies against 5 proteins and mouse blood taken at the 24 h and 48 h time points .
consistent with the gene expression data , ccl11 protein levels were increased ( at the 48 h post dose , figure 5 and table s8 ) .
the lack of increase in circulating ccl11 at 24 hours post fgf21 treatment may reflect the specific differences in the kinetics of protein synthesis and / or secretion .
il1rn protein levels were significantly decreased at the 24 h time point following the high dose of peg30 - fgf21 q108 ( figure 5 ) .
this is in agreement with the microarray analysis where the il1rn transcript was down - regulated by the 2.5 mg / kg dose of peg30 - fgf21 q108 at the 2 day time point .
the increase in il1rn at 48 h post - dose may reflect feedback regulation , although this requires further experimentation .
immunoassays for the three other proteins ( cxcl2 , igf1 , and kitl ) did not show dose - dependent changes in the plasma after fgf21 treatment ( figure 5 ) .
there was , however , a significant decrease in the plasma levels of all three proteins at the highest dose of fgf21 tested at the 24 h time point in agreement with their transcript regulation .
further studies are required to fully validate these findings .

in the context of secreted proteins , the insulin - sensitizing adipokine adiponectin is of particular relevance to fgf21 signaling .
two recent studies [ 17,18 ] have shown that adiponectin is a downstream effector of fgf21 .
furthermore , treatment with fgf21 enhanced both the expression and secretion of adiponectin in mouse adipocytes ( differentiated in vitro ) , and also increased the serum levels of adiponectin in mice .
in the present study we did not see significant increases in adiponectin mrna in adipose tissues in vivo .
in parallel experiments , we treated 3t3l1 adipocytes with wt fgf21 at 0.3 and 1 mug / ml and could not observe an increase in adiponectin protein in the media , despite increased erk phosporylation , a robust indicator of fgf21 receptor activation ( figure s5a ) .
moreover , rosiglitazone ( 10 mum ) treatment did trigger a 65 % increase in secreted adiponectin in the same experiment .
similarly , in mice treated with wt fgf21 ( at 1 mg / kg ) a 2 - fold increase in erk phosphorylation , indicative of target engagement ( after 15 minutes of treatment ) , was not associated with increased levels of plasma adiponectin after either 1 or 6 hours of treatment ( figure s5b ) .
rosiglitazone was not used in this in vivo study since more chronic dosing has been reported to be required to observe an increase in circulating adiponectin levels [ 32 ] .
further experiments are needed to determine the basis of these apparent inconsistencies .
fgf21 - induced acute phosphoprotein changes in 3t3l1 adipocytes and white adipose tissues changes in the phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules following fgf21 treatment in adipose / adipocytes are expected to be the most proximal effects of receptor activation , and could potentially be used as te biomarkers in adipose tissue biopsies .
we used an unbiased phosphoproteomic silac approach in 3t3l1 mouse adipocytes treated with fgf21 to identify such changes .
as a quality control , lc - ms profiling of forward and reverse labeled samples demonstrated that the heavy isotope incorporation as well as the equal mixing of heavy and light samples were of good quality ( data not shown ) .
we subsequently identified and quantified a total of 1186 phosphopeptides corresponding to 671 unique proteins from 3t3l1 adipocytes .
among them , 137 phosphopeptides showed a greater than 1.5 fold change between vehicle and fgf21 treatment ( table s9 ). of these phosphorylation events , 127 were up - regulated while 10 were down - regulated by fgf21 treatment compared to vehicle .
enriched canonical pathways from the ingenuity pathway analysis tool included insulin receptor signaling , igf - 1 signaling , and phospholipase c signaling ( see table s10 ) .
the top 13 phosphoproteins with potential commercially available antibodies are listed in table 3 .

the 137 peptides , from which the 13 were derived , are listed in table s9 .
in addition , western blot analysis was performed on cell extracts from adipocytes and wat extracts from the independent in vivo validation study at the 15 min time point using commercially available phospho - specific antibodies against 5 of the proteins predicted to increase ( frs2a , erk1 / 2 , stat3 , ppp1r12a / mypt1 and cbx5 ) and one predicted to decrease ( mdm2 ) following fgf21 treatment .
we confirmed the increase in phosphorylation of frs2a , erk1 / 2 , and ppp1r12a / mypt1 in fgf21 - treated 3t3l1 adipocytes and human adipocytes ( figure 6a,b ) .
interestingly , the increase in phosphorylation of the same 3 proteins and stat3 was also seen in visceral adipose tissue ( ewat ) of lean mice after fgf21 treatment in vivo but not in subcutaneous fat ( iwat ) , where increased phosphorylation of frs2a and erk1 / 2 was observed ( figure 6c,d ) .
in addition , decreased fgf21 - induced phosphorylation of mdm2 was observed in both ewat and iwat while phosphorylation of cbx5 was inconsistent in both depots .
further validation studies in vivo are required to establish the state of these phosphorylation events in adipose tissue following in vivo treatment .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0073011.g006 figure 6 fgf21 increases phosphorylation of novel peptides in adipocytes and white adipose tissue .
analyzed extracts were from ( a ) mouse 3t3l1 adipocytes , ( b ) human subcutaneous adipocytes , and ( c ) iwat or ( d ) ewat tissue from c57bl / 6 mice on chow diet treated for 15 min , with either vehicle ( veh ) , wt fgf21 or peg30 - fgf21 q108 at the doses indicated .
shown in the western blots are representative samples .
discussion the aim of the present study was to further interrogate the signaling events downstream of fgf21 receptor activation and , as an added bonus we identified a robust panel of target engagement ( te ) biomarkers that may be useful for clinical development of fgf21 - based therapeutics .
for this purpose , we employed detailed transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of mouse adipose tissues and cells , respectively .
results from unbiased genome - wide studies have increased our understanding of which pathways are activated by fgf21 in this primary target tissue .
moreover , the activation of the fgfr / klb co - receptor complex triggered phosphorylation signaling cascades that could be tied in to the gene expression changes .
finally , by monitoring a subgroup of these events in whole blood , we were able to monitor fgf21 te either acutely or sub - chronically in vivo .
silac ms - based phosphoprotein enrichment and profiling identified and quantified fgf21 - dependent phosphoprotein changes in 3t3l1 adipocyte cell lysates obtained 10 minutes post - treatment .
erk1 and 2 ( mapk3 and 1 , respectively ) were identified as two of the most robustly phosphorylated peptides in 3t3l1 adipocytes after fgf21 treatment compared to the vehicle , as expected [ 2 ] .
other phosphorylation events occurred in pathways such as the insulin receptor signaling pathway ( gys1 , mapk1 , irs1 , mapk3 , rptor / 4932417h02rik , ppp1r12a , irs2 , and eif4ebp1 all had increased phosphorylation ) and the phospholipase c signaling pathway ( arhgef12 , ahnak , mapk1 , mapk3 , ppp1r12a , arhgef2 , and marcks all showed increased phosphorylation ) .
since these studies were carried out in adipocytes in vitro , it was important to validate these findings in adipose tissues in vivo .
however , given that most of the phosphorylation sites we identified were novel , it was not feasible to use commercially available antibody reagents .
despite these limitations , we were able to replicate five of the fgf21 - mediated phosphorylation events that were identified in vitro , in a visceral adipose depot ( ewat ) in mice .
once additional reagents for the novel phosphorylation events become available , further validation studies will be possible .
robust and consistent downstream transcriptional responses in white adipose tissues in vivo were also identified .
we first selected probe sets that were consistently regulated across the three wat depots and across the three mouse models and then sub - selected those probe sets that were robustly regulated acutely in wt mice on chow diet , resulting in 1129 and 165 probe sets , respectively ( this mimics the early clinical setting of healthy normoglycemic volunteers given a single dose of recombinant fgf21 ) .
pathway and go term enrichment analysis on the broader gene set ( 1129 probe sets ) identified metabolic pathways known to be affected by fgf21 as well as pathways not previously associated with this protein .
multiple metabolic and signaling pathways were enriched , such as fgfr , erk / mapk , pi3k / akt , igf - 1 , and mtor signaling , triglyceride synthesis and degradation , glucose uptake , amino acid transport and energy expenditure ( see table s4 and the summary schematic diagram in figure 7 ) .
perhaps not surprisingly , the most robustly regulated genes were those involved in negative feedback regulation of fgfr signaling ( dusp4 and spry4 ) , even at the lowest doses of fgf21 investigated .

see table s2 , s3 , s4 , s9 for details.most genes regulated by fgf21 identified by our studies have unknown biological significance in terms of beneficial consequences of fgf21 activation , but can nevertheless be used as robust te biomarkers .
others have known functions and their regulation by fgf21 either supports ( increased expression of ucp1 and energy expenditure [ 20 ]) or seems to contradict ( decreased expression of sfrp5 and a worsening of metabolic dysfunction [ 33 ]) a beneficial role of fgf21 .
indeed , sfrp5 expression was consistently down - regulated by fgf21 across the three wat depots and across the three mouse models used .
in addition , sfrp5 expression was higher in wat depots from db / db mice when compared to wt mice suggesting a " reversal " of the disease phenotype by fgf21 treatment ( figure s3 ) .
this is in contrast to the reported decreased expression in wat from ob / ob mice [ 33 ] .
furthermore , changes in sfrp5 expression following fgf21 treatment in wat approached the level of expression of sfrp5 in bat under basal conditions , indicative of a white adipose tissue " browning " effect by fgf21 ( figure s4 ) .
there are also conflicting reports on the role of sfrp5 in human adipose biology [ 34,35 ] , thus the biological impact of a down - regulation of this gene by fgf21 warrants further investigation .
fgf21 expression has been shown to be up - regulated by ppargamma agonist treatment in adipose tissue and adipocytes [ 8,9,36,37 ] , and there is also evidence that fgf21 treatment in turn regulates ppargamma activity [ 9 ] .
we compared the transcriptional responses in db / db ewat following fgf21 treatment in the current study to that following rosiglitazone ( pparmu agonist ) treatment in a previously published study [ 8 ]. of the genes regulated by both treatments , the majority was regulated in the same direction ( for example ucp1 and hsd17b12 were both up - regulated ( see figure s6 and table s11 ). whether this overlap reflects an overall beneficial metabolic outcome in common to both treatments or more direct effects remain to be elucidated .
several of the transcripts that we identified to be regulated by fgf21 treatment , encode secreted proteins. from a biomarker perspective , these would allow for the development of blood - based protein detection assays to measure fgf21 target engagement , which would be less invasive in a clinical setting than adipose tissue biopsies ( for rna and phosphoprotein biomarkers ) .
over 300 such transcripts were identified following acute treatment with fgf21 .
the plasma levels of 5 of these proteins for which there were commercially available antibodies were determined in a validation study and the fgf21 - induced changes in plasma agreed with their gene expression changes in iwat for at least 2 of them ( ccl11 and il1rn ) .
three other proteins were tested in the circulation but they did not show dose - dependent regulation using the available reagents , although there was a change in plasma protein levels for all three proteins at the highest dose of fgf21 , in agreement with the rna profiling data .
further studies are required to validate the additional potential secreted proteins once reagents become available .
however , one secreted protein of relevance to these studies is adiponectin , which has recently been described as having a key role in mediating fgf21 's beneficial metabolic effects in mice [ 17,18 ] .
in the present study , the mrna of this gene in wat was not altered following fgf21 treatment , perhaps reflecting the high basal level of expression in this tissue .
consistent with this observation , we also could not detect an increase in secreted adiponectin in either the culture medium of 3t3l1 adipocytes or in the circulation of mice treated in vivo ( figure s5 ) .
in contrast , we did recapitulate published data with rosiglitazone in parallel experiments , where secreted adiponectin levels were significantly increased .
moreover , the absence of increases in adiponectin mrna and protein levels could not be attributed to a lack of fgf21 effect , since we observed a robust increase in erk phosphorylation , a proximal te biomarker , both in vitro and in vivo ( figure s5 ) .
further studies are required to determine whether these differences reflect nuanced experimental conditions such as experimental design , cell / mouse sources or reagent sources .
in the current series of experiments , the impact of fgf21 on bat gene expression was more robust than in the wat ; while this is consistent with the increased oxidation of glucose observed in db / db mice following peg30 - fgf21 treatment [ 5 ] , further experiments are needed to fully elucidate any tissue - specific differences between the metabolic effects of fgf21 on bat and wat .
in summary , transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic profiling analyses have been performed in mouse adipose tissues in vivo and 3t3l1 adipocytes , respectively , following acute fgf21 treatment to further elucidate the downstream pathways affected .
in addition to confirming a number of previously reported signaling cascades , our studies also uncovered several novel transcriptional and post - translational ( phosphorylation ) events that warrant further investigation .
several key biomarkers were identified that may serve not only as clinical readouts of fgf21 target engagement but might also help elucidate the mechanisms of action in this primary target tissue that mediate fgf21 's beneficial metabolic effects .
specifically , we identified distinct transcriptional effects of fgf21 in brown and white adipose tissue .
this opens up a window for further studies to investigate both the therapeutic benefits of fgf21 and to compare the metabolic differences between these distinct adipose tissue types .

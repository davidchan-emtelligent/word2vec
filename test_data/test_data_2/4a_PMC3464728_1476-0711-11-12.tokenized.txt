paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( pnh ) is a clonal disorder that presents with hemolytic anemia , marrow failure and thrombophilia .
during acute attacks , corticosteroid can alleviate the hemolytic paroxysm , but the prolonged administration induces serious toxicity including immunosuppression .
so american thoracic society ( ats ) for tuberculosis ( tb ) recommends prophylactic anti - tb medication in patients with a long - term steroid therapy .
however , in the patient who was treated for active tb in the past , there are no guidelines of the test for determining patients who have latent tb infection ( ltbi ) and no recommendations of tb prophylaxis if there is no evidence of reactivation at present .
a 40 - year - old male patient presented with fever and aggravated weakness for a week .
he was diagnosed with pnh a month ago and took corticosteroid for 3 weeks .
in the past , he was diagnosed with pulmonary tb and completely cured after treatment .
according to guideline , he was not indicated with tb prophylaxis .
however , he caught miliary tb , progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome .
we experience this embarrassing case , and emphasize the need to investigate multicentral tb prevalence and to make the guidelines of anti - tb medication in subgroups of hematologic diseases including pnh .
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria miliary tuberculosis ( tb ) tuberculosis ( tb ) prophylaxis introduction paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( pnh ) is a rare acquired clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder that presents with hemolytic anemia , venous thrombosis , deficient hematopoiesis and chronic renal disease [ 1 ] .
it is a serious chronic disease with high morbidity and mortality .
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is only a curative treatment .
the treatment is personalized and directed towards the specific complications .
sometimes , pnh patients have acute attacks .
corticosteroid and androgen can be lessen a hemolytic paroxysm and improve hemoglobin levels in about 60 % of pnh patients .
however , the required doses of corticosteroid are high , and a long - term continuous administration on a daily basis is difficult due to its toxicities [ 2,3 ] .
owing to immunosuppressive effect of corticosteroid , american thoracic society ( ats ) for tuberculosis ( tb ) recommends anti - tb medication in patients used prednisone more than 15 mg / day over a month [ 4 ] .
nevertheless , these guidelines show only the treatment principles , in clinical practice , there are some problems to decide the test or management in special groups including hematologic diseases .
in addition , the prevalence of miliary tb in malignant disease is 3 times higher than in general population and its mortality rate is about 25 - 30 % in adults [ 5 ] .
we experienced a pnh patient with acute attack .
he received corticosteroid for 3 weeks to control hemolysis .
in the past , he was diagnosed with pulmonary tb and we investigated ltbi ( latent tb infection ) .
he was not indicated with anti - tb medication [ 6 ] , but after immunosuppressive drug for 3 weeks , he suffered from miliary tb. so we report this difficult and embarrassing case with literature review of tb associated with hematologic disease .
case report a 40 - year - old asian male patient presented with fever and more aggravated generalized weakness for 1 week .
a month ago , he complained of hematuria , fever and generalized weakness .
he was diagnosed with pnh associated with another bone marrow disorder ( aplastic anemia ) .
for control of acute hemolysis , red cells transfusion and immunosuppressive drugs ( corticosteroid and danazol ) were prescribed and he was discharged after stabilized .
at that time , his chest x - ray showed old pulmonary calcified nodules in both lung field ( figure 1 ) .
he was diagnosed with pulmonary tb about 21 years ago and he was completely cured after anti - tb medication ( isoniazid , ethambutol , rifampicin , pyrazinamide ) for 6 months .
on readmission , vital signs were followed ; bp 140 / 80 mmhg , pulse rate 76 beats / min , respiration rate 20 times / min , and body temperature 39.1degreesc .
jaundice was observed in both sclera , and breath sounds were decreased in both lung field .
the laboratory findings revealed white blood cells , 720 / ul ( segment neutrophil 75.6 % ; lymphocytes 15.7 %) ; hemoglobin , 9.6 g / dl ; and platelets , 55,000 / ul. ast / alt , total bilirubin and ldh were 167 / 312 iu / l , 3.9 mg / dl and 2,543 iu / l respectively .
blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were 20.3 mg / dl and 1.4 mg / dl. in chest radiographs , the miliary nodules were observed in both lung field ( figure 2a ) .
chest ct scan showed miliary nodulation and patch underlying perinodular ground glass appearance in both lung field , suggestive of miliary tb ( figure 2b ) .
tb pcr was positive .
after 3 weeks of immunosuppressive drugs , he was diagnosed to miliary tb. due to elevated liver enzyme , ethambutol / moxifloxacin / cycloserine were selected .
to expect the rise of drug effects , supportive care such as g - csf administration , blood transfusion and nutritional support were done .
after 5 days of the anti - tb medications , patch density in chest x - ray was progressed and he complained of severe dyspnea , nausea , vomiting and aggravated weakness ( figure 3 ) .
we considered ventilator care , but the patient was tolerable at the 10l of oxygen mask apply .
we added 1st line anti - tb drugs ( isoniazid , rifampicin ) stage by stage .
after continuous intensive care for 3 weeks , dyspnea was getting better and he needed only 2l of oxygen apply .
the chest x - ray has got better .
he was improved and the resistance strain was not seen in 8 weeks after culture .
he had taken 1st line anti - tb drugs ( isoniazid , ethambutol , rifampicin ) and warfarin in outpatient of hospital , and nowadays he finished anti - tb drugs except warfarin ( figure 4 ) .
figure 1 in chest radiographs , the suspicious old tuberculous calcified nodule was seen ( white arrow ) .
figure 2 ( a ) in chest radiographs , the miliary nodules were observed in both lung field .
( b ) chest ct scan showed miliary nodulation and patch underlying perinodular ground glass appearance in both lung field , suggestive of miliary tb. figure 3 patch density in chest x - ray was progressed , suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome .
figure 4 after anti - tuberculosis medication , chest x - ray showed improvement .
discussion in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( pnh ) , the absence of the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol ( gpi ) - anchored proteins induces hemolytic anemia , thrombosis and smooth muscle dystonias .
pnh is a chronic condition and its treatment includes 1 ) allogeneic bone marrow transplantation , 2 ) eculizumab , a humanized monoclonal antibody against the terminal complement protein c5 [ 7,8 ] and 3 ) supportive care such as transfusion , iron and folic acid supplementation and prophylactic anti - coagulation .
however , sometimes patients have acute attacks .
corticosteroid can alleviate a hemolytic paroxysm and improve hemoglobin levels in about 60 % of pnh patients .
but a long - term continuous administration of high dose corticosteroid is troubled with its toxicity [ 2 ] .
due to immunosuppression of corticosteroid , cdc recommends prophylactic anti - tb medication in patients with more than 15 mg / day prednisone over 1 month [ 4 ] .
worldwide , for the elimination of tb , identification and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection ( ltbi ) are essential [ 9 - 12 ] .
ltbi is a condition in which a person is infected with dormant mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms , but does not currently have active tb disease [ 13 ] .
according to ats for tb , following patients with ltbi should be considered for anti - tb medication ; hiv infection , organ transplantation related to immune - suppressant therapy , recent tb infection within 2 years , tnf inhibitors .
in cellular immunity of tb , lymphocyte is a major part of immune activity [ 4,14 ] .
in patients with hematologic disease , t - cell immunodeficiency was induced by hematologic disease itself , chemotherapy , corticosteroid and other underlying diseases [ 15 ] .
hahn et al. reported that the prevalence of active tb in hematologic disorders was 0.8 % in total , with 21.4 % in myelofibrosis , 20 % in pnh and 7.9 % in myelodysplastic syndrome in korea .
although in this report , the prevalence of tb in the hematologic disorder was not significantly different compared with control group , the incidence of tb in pnh was very high [ 16 ] .
there are many controversies in the incidence of tb in immunosuppressed patients .
in clinical practice , considering risk and an incidence , the diagnosis and treatment of ltbi should be determined .
however , there is a problem in determination of prophylactic anti - tb medication , that is to say limitation of the diagnostic methods for ltbi in immunosuppressed patients .
american thoracic society ( ats ) proposed targeted tuberculin skin test ( tst ) as a diagnostic tool for ltbi in high - risk group and in the u.s. diagnostic guidelines of 2000 , an immunologic test was described .
qunatiferon - tb gold ( qft - g ) is an interferon - gamma releasing assay ( igra ) and it was approved by the fda for the diagnosis of tb in 2005 and replaced tst [ 4,17 ] .
in korea with high prevalence of tb and high false positivity of tst due to bcg vaccination , igra replace tst .
but igra has a limitation in differentiation of active tb from ltbi , and when patient was treated with ltbi or active tb in the past , it ca n't determine whether or not new infection is developed .
also in patients with immunosuppression and complete recovery from tb at the same time , there is no guideline .
on the other hand , miliary tb accounts for about 1 % of all cases of tb and the mortality related to miliary tb is about 25 - 30 % in adults [ 5 ] .
miliary tb may infect any number of organs , including the lungs , liver and spleen .
hematologic abnormalities are frequently described and pancytopenia is profound in hematolgic diseases .
in malignant diseases , the incidence of miliary tb is about 3 % and it rarely reported in hematologic diseases [ 18,19 ] .
in our patient , before the administration of immunosuppressive drugs for control of acute hemolysis , we wanted to perform the test for detection of ltbi according to cdc for tb. however , since our patient did not have clinical and radiological evidence of active tb and he was completely cured tb in the past , he was not indicated to test and prophylactic anti - tb medication .
in addition , because anti - tb medication frequently induces hepatic dysfunction , poor oral intake , nausea and vomiting , the administration prophylactic anti - tb medication is very troubled in seriously ill patient out of guideline .
however , he contracted miliary tb and we were in confusion .
the treatment for tb was not easy because he complained of nausea , vomiting and poor oral intake and his laboratory findings showed severe pancytopenia and liver dysfunction .
meanwhile , fever is the sign that needs differential diagnosis .
he had fever at diagnosis of pnh due to hemolysis and he was checked chest x - ray regularly ( weekly ) .
but , miliary tb was developed in one week .
so in patients with fever and immunosuppressive drugs , inspection and chest x - ray at intervals of 2 or 3 days are needed .
in conclusion , except some advanced country , tb is endemic disease in worldwide yet .
also , there are differences of tb prevalence between the subgroups of hematologic diseases .
so we emphasize the need to investigate multicentral tb prevalence and to make an urgent decision of details of the guidelines for anti - tb medication in patients with subgroups of hematologic diseases including pnh .

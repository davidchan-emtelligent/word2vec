background both mutational inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) tumor suppressor gene and activation of the kras oncogene are implicated in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer .
mice harboring a germline apcmin mutation or intestine - specific expression of the krasv12 gene have been developed .
both mouse strains develop spontaneous intestinal tumors , including adenoma and carcinoma , though at a different age .
the zinc finger transcription factor kruppel - like factor 5 ( klf5 ) has previously been shown to promote proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and modulate intestinal tumorigenesis .
here we investigated the in vivo effect of klf5 heterozygosity on the propensity of apcmin / krasv12 double transgenic mice to develop intestinal tumors .
results at 12 weeks of age , apcmin / krasv12 mice had three times as many intestinal tumors as apcmin mice .
this increase in tumor number was reduced by 92 % in triple transgenic apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice .
the reduction in tumor number in apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice was also statistically significant compared to apcmin mice alone , with a 75 % decrease .
compared with apcmin / krasv12 , tumors from both apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - and apcmin mice were smaller .
in addition , tumors from apcmin mice were more distally distributed in the intestine as contrasted by the more proximal distribution in apcmin / krasv12 and apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice .
klf5 levels in the normal - appearing intestinal mucosa were higher in both apcmin and apcmin / krasv12 mice but were attenuated in apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice .
the levels of beta - catenin , cyclin d1 and ki - 67 were also reduced in the normal - appearing intestinal mucosa of apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice when compared to apcmin / krasv12 mice .
levels of pmek and perk1 / 2 were elevated in the normal - appearing mucosa of apcmin / krasv12 mice and modestly reduced in apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice .
tumor tissues displayed higher levels of both klf5 and beta - catenin , irrespective of the mouse genotype from which tumors were derived .
conclusions results of the current study confirm the cumulative effect of apc loss and oncogenic kras activation on intestinal tumorigenesis .
the drastic reduction in tumor number and size due to klf5 heterozygosity in apcmin / krasv12 mice indicate a critical function of klf5 in modulating intestinal tumor initiation and progression .
background cancer is the result of deregulated cellular homeostasis and is typically characterized by increased proliferation and / or decreased apoptosis [ 1 ] .
the mammalian intestinal epithelium is a continuously renewing system that is carefully orchestrated throughout life [ 2 ] .
several important signaling pathways are involved in maintaining intestinal epithelial homeostasis and include the wnt , notch , eph / ephrin , hedgehog and bone morphogenetic protein ( bmp ) pathways [ 2 ] .
it is well established that genetic perturbations in proliferation or differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells can lead to physiological changes which may aid in the development of colorectal cancer [ 3 ] .
specific mutations have been associated with colorectal carcinogenesis .
ras genes are one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human tumors and occur in approximately 50 % of colon cancers [ 4,5 ] .
there are three isoforms of the ras gene , kras , hras and nras - however , a majority of human tumors possess mutations in the kras gene [ 3 - 8 ] .
ras is a membrane - bound protein that is activated by growth factors including epidermal growth factor ( egf ) and platelet - derived growth factor ( pdgf ) [ 9 ] .
upon activation , ras becomes attached to gtp and elicits a signaling cascade that induces cell proliferation [ 10 ] .
kras gene is indispensible for normal embryonic survival - targeted homozygous deletion of the mouse k - ras gene resulted in embryonic lethality between e12.5 and term [ 11,12 ] .
in contrast , homozygous deletions in mouse h - r as or n - ras gene did not result in any significant phenotypic or viability changes [ 12 - 14 ] .
loss of heterozygosity ( loh ) with consequent inactivation of tumor suppressor genes has been causally implicated in colon cancer formation [ 8 ] .
one of the best - characterized tumor suppressor genes in colon cancer is the adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) gene .
apc is part of the wnt signaling pathway that regulates intestinal epithelial cell proliferation .
inactivation of apc causes nuclear translocation of normally membrane - bound beta - catenin and subsequent activation of the beta - catenin / tcf4 complex with resultant increased proliferation [ 15 - 17 ] .
patients with familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) harbor heritable mutations in the apc gene and spontaneously develop adenomatous polyps throughout their intestinal tracts at an early age [ 18,19 ] .
the apc gene is also inactivated in greater than 80 % of sporadic colorectal cancer [ 20 ] .
an autosomal dominant mouse model of multiple intestinal neoplasia ( min ) was developed in c57bl / 6 mice upon ethylnitrosourea treatment [ 21 ] .
this mouse strain carries a germline mutation in the mouse apc gene , resulting in truncation of the protein at amino acid position 850 [ 22 ] .
as a result , apcmin mice exhibit a phenotype similar to that of fap patients [ 22 ] .
kruppel - like factors ( klfs ) are zinc finger - containing , sp1 - like transcription factors that are involved in diverse physiological processes including proliferation , differentiation and embryonic development [ 23,24 ] .
in the intestine , kruppel - like factor 5 ( klf5 ) is predominantly expressed in the proliferating crypt epithelial cells [ 25,26 ] .
klf5 is important for embryonic development since homozygous deletion of klf5 in mice is embryonic lethal [ 27 ] .
we previously demonstrated that klf5 has a pro - proliferative effect in cultured cells and does so by activating cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin d1 , cyclin b1 and cdc2 [ 28,29 ] .
in addition , klf5 has been shown to be an important mediator of the hras and kras oncogenic pathways [ 28,30 ] as well as the wnt pathway [ 31 ] .
adenomas and carcinomas in mice that express oncogenic krasv12 from the intestine - specific villin promoter have increased klf5 expression [ 30 ] .
in addition , we recently showed that adenoma formation in apcmin mice was significantly abrogated when apcmin mice were bred to mice heterozygous for klf5 [ 32 ] .
we further showed that klf5 interacts with beta - catenin and facilitates the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of beta - catenin [ 32 ] .
these studies suggest that klf5 is an essential mediator of intestinal tumorigenesis in the context of apcmin mutation .
since klf5 has been shown to mediate the function of both apc and ras , and mutations in apc and kras are common events in colorectal cancer , we examined the role of klf5 in mediating intestinal tumor formation in mice compound for apcmin and intestine - specific krasv12 mutations in the current study .
results klf5 heterozygosity reduces intestinal adenoma formation in apcmin / krasv12 mice to determine the effect of klf5 heterozygosity on intestinal adenoma formation in mice that harbor both apcmin and krasv12 mutations , we crossed mice that were heterozygous for the apcmin and klf5 genes with those that were heterozygous for the krasv12 gene directed by the intestine - specific villin promoter [ 33 ] .
intestines from the resulting progeny were assessed for tumor number and size at 12 weeks of age .
tumors were observed in mice from three genotypes of the resulting progeny ( apcmin , apcmin / krasv12 and apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - ) but not in apcmin / klf5 +/ - or krasv12mice .
the mice with the compound apcmin / krasv12 genotype had a greater propensity for developing tumors in the small intestine than the apcmin mice ( fig. 1a ) .
the latter had an average of 71 small intestinal tumors per mouse while apcmin / krasv12 mice had an average of 226 tumors .
the deletion of one of the klf5 alleles in apcmin / krasv12 mice reduced the average tumor number to 19 per mouse - a 92 % reduction ( fig. 1a ) .
in the colon , the number of tumors per mouse was much fewer compared to the small intestine , with no significant differences in numbers of tumors between the three genotypes ( fig. 1b ). fig. 1c shows the combined tumor burden in both the small intestines and colons of the three different strains of mice .

tumor burden is plotted as the number of tumors per mouse on the y - axis .

haploinsufficiency of klf5 decreases intestinal tumor size in apcmin / krasv12 mice in addition to tumor number , we measured the tumor size from the mice described above .
the majority of the tumors , irrespective of genotype , were less than 1 mm in size ( fig. 2a ) .
however , the percentage of tumors that were smaller than 1 mm in apcmin / krasv12 mice ( 49 % overall ) was lower than either apcmin ( 69 % overall ) or apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - ( 62 % overall ) mice .
in contrast , apcmin / krasv12 mice had a higher percentage of tumors that were 1 - 2 mm in size ( 39 %) when compared to apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice ( 33 %) or apcmin mice ( 28 %) ( fig. 2a ) .
similarly , apcmin / krasv12 mice also displayed a greater number of tumors that were 2 - 3 mm or greater than 3 mm when compared to the other two genotypes .
these differences in tumor size showed a statistically significant trend when analyzed by the chi - square test .

the tumors are sized based on 4 categories , < 1 mm , 1 - 2 mm , 2 - 3 mm and > 3 mm. average percentages of tumors are represented on the y - axis and tumor size categories on the x - axis ; n = 8 and groups show a significant trend based on a one - way anova test with p < 0.05 .

the graph is plotted with average percentage of tumors on the y - axis and tumor locations on the x - axis ; n = 8 and groups show a significant trend based on a one - way anova test with p < 0.05 .
change in intestinal tumor localization in mice that possess the krasv12 genotype in addition to the apcmin genotype an interesting observation when comparing intestinal tumors among the different genotypes concerned the localization of the tumors .
we observed that a larger percentage of tumors in apcmin mice were localized in the distal small intestine , predominantly in the ileum ( 57 %) and the jejunum ( 36 %) ( fig. 2b ) .
in contrast , both apcmin / krasv12 and apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice contained a higher percentage of intestinal tumors in the proximal small intestine , duodenum ( 44 % and 64 % , respectively ) when compared to the apcmin mice ( 7 %) ( fig. 2b ) .
these differences were found to be statistically significant using the chi - square test .
we then determined the level of kras transcripts in intestinal tissues from mice with the different genotypes using quantitative pcr .
both apcmin / krasv12 mice and apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice contained high levels of exogenous ( human ) kras mrna in the intestine while wild type and apcmin mice had only background expression ( fig. 3a ) .
since uneven kras expression could potentially contribute to the altered regional localization in the intestines of mice harboring krasv12 , we measured both endogenous ( mouse ) and exogenous ( human ) kras transcript levels in different segments of the intestine .
we found that levels of exogenous kras transcripts were highly elevated in all three segments of the intestine of apcmin / krasv12 mice , with no significant regional differences ( fig. 3b ) .
similarly , no regional differences in the levels of endogenous kras were found in the intestines of either apcmin or apcmin / krasv12 mice ( fig. 3b ) .

klf5 heterozygosity results in reduced levels of pro - proliferative proteins in the intestines of apcmin and apcmin / krasv12 mice we previously showed that klf5 is pro - proliferative in the normal intestinal epithelial cells [ 30,34 ] and is increased in tumors from mice that contain the apcmin allele [ 32 ] or the krasv12 allele [ 30 ] .
here we observed increased levels of klf5 protein in the normal - appearing small intestinal tissues of both apcmin and apcmin / krasv12 mice when compared to that of wild type mice ( fig. 4a - c ) .
the introduction of a mutant klf5 allele into apcmin / krasv12 mice resulted in a reduction in klf5 ( fig. 4d ) to a level that was more similar to the wild type intestine ( fig. 4a ) .
similarly , the levels of beta - catenin were increased in the normal - appearing intestinal tissues of apcmin and apcmin / krasv12 mice when compared to wild type mice ( fig. 4e - g ) .
again , this increase in beta - catenin was attenuated in the apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice ( fig. 4h ) .
moreover , an increase in nuclear localized beta - catenin was noted in the crypt epithelial cells of apcmin and apcmin / krasv12 mice compared to wild type mice ( fig. 5a - c ) .
similar to total beta - catenin , the number of crypt epithelial cells containing nuclear beta - catenin was reduced in apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice relative to apcmin and apcmin / krasv12 mice ( fig. 5d ) .
these results indicate that klf5 modulates both steady - state beta - catenin levels and cellular localization of beta - catenin in intestinal epithelial cells secondary to the apcmin mutation .

red arrowheads in all the panels indicate nuclear beta - catenin staining .
we then performed immunohistochemical analyses on cyclin d1 , a shared target between klf5 and beta - catenin [ 32 ] .
similar to the expression patterns of klf5 and beta - catenin , there was an increase in cyclin d1 levels in the intestine of both apcmin and apcmin / krasv12 mice when compared to that of wild type mice ( fig. 6a - c ) .
cyclin d1 staining in the normal - appearing intestinal epithelium in apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice was reduced when compared to apcmin and apcmin / krasv12 mice , except for a small focus of adenomatous tissue where cyclin d1 remained high ( fig. 6d ) .
we also quantified cyclin d1 levels by quantitative image analysis ( fig. 6e ) and western blot analysis ( fig. 6f ) .
as seen , both measurements confirmed the trend of cyclin d1 levels in the intestine from mice of the four genotypes as revealed by immunohistochemical staining .
similar trends in the levels of klf5 and beta - catenin were also documented by western blot analysis ( fig. 6f ) .
lastly , levels of the proliferation marker , ki67 , in the normal - appearing intestinal tissues of the four strains of mice closely paralleled the levels of klf5 , beta - catenin and cyclin d1 , by immunohistochemical staining ( fig. 7a - d ) and image quantification ( fig. 7e ) .

the mitogen - activated kinase ( mapk ) pathway is activated in the intestinal mucosa of apcmin / krasv12 mice we previously established that mapk pathway , as reflected by erk phosphorylation , was an important intermediate in oncogenic kras - mediated induction of klf5 [ 28,30 ] .
hence , we immunostained samples of small intestinal tissues for phospho - mek and phospho - erk proteins .
we found that staining intensities for pmek were increased in normal - appearing small intestinal epithelial cells from both apcmin and apcmin / krasv12 mice when compared to wild type mice ( fig. 8a - c ) .
a moderate reduction in pmek staining was noted in the intestine of apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice compared to that of apcmin / krasv12 mice ( fig. 8c & 8d ) .
a similar pattern was also observed when perk1 / 2 staining was performed ( fig. 8e - h ) .
these results indicate that the mapk pathway is activated in the intestine of apcmin / krasv12 mice and that klf5 heterozygosity modestly reduces this activation .

immunohistochemical analyses were performed with phospho - mek ( pmek ; a - d ) and phospho - erk1 / 2 ( perk ; e - h ) antibodies .

intestinal tumors have increased klf5 and beta - catenin expression irrespective of genotype we also stained intestinal tumors derived from apcmin , apcmin / krasv12 and apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice for klf5 and beta - catenin .
as seen in fig. 9 , the levels of both klf5 and beta - catenin were elevated in the adenomatous tissues of all three strains compared to the normal - appearing intestinal tissues .
these results indicate that despite the differences in expression among proliferative markers in the normal intestinal epithelia of the mutant mice , expression patterns of these markers are similar in tumor tissues irrespective of genotype .

discussion colorectal cancer is the result of cumulative mutations in genes involved in regulating proliferation or apoptosis .
apc is an integral part of the wnt signaling pathway that regulates intestinal epithelial homeostasis [ 35 ] .
inactivation of apc is synonymous with wnt activation and has been shown to be causal to colorectal carcinogenesis [ 35 ] .
also , among the frequently mutated genes in colorectal cancer is kras , specifically in codons 12 , 13 and 61 [ 36 - 39 ] .
it was shown that mutations in apc and kras occur in approximately 80 % and 50 % , respectively , of sporadic colorectal cancer [ 4,5,20 ] .
recent studies aimed at comprehensive sequencing of genes mutated in colorectal cancer confirmed that apc and kras mutations are among the most common mutations found in colorectal cancer [ 40,41 ] .
results of our study confirmed the cooperative effect of activated wnt and ras signaling in mice .
at 12 weeks of age , compound heterozygous apcmin / krasv12 mice developed more and larger small intestinal tumors than apcmin mice alone ( figs. 1a and 2a ) .
in comparison , at the same age , krasv12 mice did not have any tumor , consistent with the previous finding that these mice develop intestinal tumors relatively late in life [ 33 ] .
this cooperative nature between apc and kras mutations in leading to increased tumor formation is similar to that observed in two previous studies , one involving apc +/ 1638 / krasv12 double transgenic mice [ 42 ] and the other apcmin / k - rasd12 double transgenic mice [ 43 ] .
while there was a trend for a higher number of colonic tumors in the apcmin / krasv12 as compared to apcmin mice alone in our study ( fig. 1b ) , the difference did not reach statistical significance , due to the relatively small number of tumors in this region .
the propensity for the apcmin , apc +/ 1638 , krasv12 , apc +/ 1638 / krasv12 mice to develop tumors in the small intestine rather than the colon has been reported [ 21,33,42 ] .
it is of interest to note that there is a difference in regional distribution of small bowel tumors between apcmin and apcmin / krasv12 mice - tumors in the former mice were more distally distributed while those in the latter were more proximally distributed ( fig. 2b ) .
this difference in tumor distribution does not appear to be due to regional variations in expression of the krasv12 transgene from the villin promoter ( fig. 3b ) .
the effect of krasv12 allele introduction on the shift in tumor distribution more proximally is therefore not clear at this time .
a similar trend toward distribution of small bowel tumors in the apcmin mice has been reported [ 44 ] .
we recently reported the critical role for klf5 in tumor initiation in apcmin mice [ 32 ] .
klf5 haploinsufficiency in apcmin mice resulted in a significant decrease in tumor number and size [ 32 ] .
results of the current study demonstrate a similar effect on tumor formation at 12 weeks of age in apcmin / krasv12 mice that were heterozygous for the klf5 alleles , with the intestinal tumor burden reduced by more than 90 % in the triple apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - transgenic mice when compared to the double apcmin / krasv12 transgenic mice ( fig. 1 ) .
in addition , the tumors in the apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice , when formed , were smaller than those from the apcmin / krasv12 mice ( fig. 2a ) .
indeed , apcmin / krasv12 mice had to be euthanized by 12 weeks of age , due to the presence of rectal prolapse from the large tumor burden .
in contrast , the majority of apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice survived up to a year without displaying overt morbidity .
taken into consideration that expression of the krasv12 transgene in the small intestine of apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice remains robust ( fig. 3a ) , our study suggests that haploinsufficiency of klf5 attenuates the cumulative effect of apc inactivation and oncogenic kras activation .
our results show that a combined effect of apcmin and krasv12 mutations is a significant increase in the levels of beta - catenin , cyclin d1 and ki67 , in the normal - appearing intestinal tissues in the apcmin / krasv12 mice as compared to wild type mice ( figs. 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ) .
this increase is similar to that seen in the intestine from the apcmin mice ( figs. 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ) .
haploinsufficiency of klf5 attenuated the increase in the levels of these three proteins in the normal - appearing intestine of apcmin / krasv12 mice to levels that resembled the wild type intestine ( figs. 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ) .
these results indicate that the increase in beta - catenin and cyclin d1 levels in the intestine of mutant mice is primarily a consequence of apcmin mutation , rather than krasv12 over - expression and that the tumor suppressive effect of klf5 haploinsufficiency in apcmin / krasv12 mice is due primarily to the ability of klf5 to modulate apcmin signaling .
these notions are supported by the observation that increased nuclear localization of beta - catenin is observed in the normal - appearing intestinal crypt epithelial cells of both apcmin and apcmin / krasv12 mice but was significantly reduced in the crypt cells of apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice ( fig. 5 ) .
the se findings are consistent with our previous observation that klf5 both stabilizes beta - catenin and facilitates nuclear import of beta - catenin [ 32 ] .
however , it should be noted that a recent report showed that activated kras also facilitates nuclear translocation of beta - catenin following loss of apc in zebrafish [ 45 ] .
moreover , we have shown that krasv12 increases klf5 expression in vitro and in vivo [ 30 ] .
combining the results of these studies , it is highly plausible that klf5 is a common mediator for the increased beta - catenin activity due to both apc loss and kras activation .
mek and erk phosphorylation are hallmarks of activation of the ras signaling pathway which stimulates cell proliferation [ 46 ] .
we previously reported that mek / erk phosphorylation is essential for mediating oncogenic ras - induced klf5 expression in vitro [ 28,30 ] .
previous studies have documented enhanced mek / erk protein phosphorylation in mice containing both oncogenic kras mutations and apc inactivation [ 47,48 ] .
results of the current study showed a similar increase in mek / erk phosphorylation in the normal - appearing intestines of mice with apcmin mutation that is further enhanced upon oncogenic kras activation ( fig. 8 ) .
upon heterozygous loss of klf5 in apcmin / krasv12 mice , mek / erk phosphorylation levels are only modestly reduced .
these results suggest that ras activation of mek / erk phosphorylation is upstream of klf5 induction , although klf5 could potentially regulate mek / erk phosphorylation through a feedback mechanism , as previously proposed [ 49 ] .
our study adds to a growing list of literature demonstrating the combined effect of apc and kras mutation on intestinal tumorigenesis in mice [ 42,43,50,51 ] .
in the setting of apc mutation , inhibition of intestinal tumor formation has been documented secondary to deletion of several genes crucial for tumorigenesis [ 32,52 - 56 ] .
however , ours is the first in which to show a critical role of klf5 in mediating the tumorigenic effect of combined apc and kras mutations , a commonly encountered scenario in colorectal cancer in humans .
this suggests that therapies targeted to klf5 may have potential therapeutic benefit to patients with colorectal cancer .
indeed , a recent screen for small molecule inhibitors of klf5 expression has yielded several potent compounds that inhibit proliferation of colorectal cancer cells [ 57 ] .
further investigation may prove klf5 an attractive target for intervention in the prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer .
conclusions loss of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes are hallmarks of cancers .
in the case of colorectal cancer , loss of apc and activation of kras are common .
here , we present a robust mouse model of intestinal tumorigenesis with the generation of apcmin / krasv12 mice .
these mice display an increased propensity for developing intestinal tumors at an early age compared to apcmin mice .
moreover , we were able to significantly reduce tumor burden and size in the compound apcmin / krasv12 mice by reducing expression of klf5 with genetic means .
apcmin / krasv12 / klf5 +/ - mice display reduced levels of klf5 protein as well as beta - catenin , cyclin d1 and ki67 , all known markers of proliferation and transformation .
we conclude that klf5 is a crucial mediator of initiation and progression of intestinal tumors resulted from apcmin and krasv12 mutations .
methods reagents antibodies used in the experiments were previously described [ 30,32 ] .
antibodies against klf5 were generated against a synthetic klf5 peptide in rabbits ( strategic diagnostics , newark , de ) .
anti - klf5 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:15,000 for immunohistochemistry and at 1:4,000 for western blot analysis .
mouse monoclonal antibody against total beta - catenin was purchased from invitrogen ( carlsbad , ca ) and used at a dilution of 1:1,000 for western blot analyses .

tumor assessment mice were sacrificed at 12 weeks of age by co2 asphyxiation , as per iacuc guidelines .
the mice were dissected and the small intestine and colon removed .
the intestinal tissues were cleaned with phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) and cut open .
using a dissecting microscope , the intestinal tissues were examined in a blinded fashion , for the presence and size measurements of tumors .
the adenomas found were counted and measured according to < 1 mm , 1 - 2 mm , 2 - 3 mm and > 3 mm size groups .
rna purification and quantitative pcr rna was extracted from formalin - fixed paraffin - embedded tissue samples using the rt2 ffpe rna extraction kit ( sa biosciences , frederick , md ) .
sixty mum tissue sections were cut from paraffin sample blocks and digested with proteinase k for 30 minutes .
samples were then boiled and centrifuged to remove paraffin .
rna was extracted from the liquid samples using trizol ls reagent ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) and subsequently purified using a spin column .
rna was quantified and used ( 100 ng / sample ) in quantitative pcr .
specific primers against mouse kras , human kras and mouse beta - actin were purchased from sa biosciences ( frederick , md ) and qiagen ( valencia , ca ) respectively .
quantitative pcr was performed using the power sybr green rna - to - ct 1 - step kit ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) as per protocol .
observed ct levels were then used to calculate fold change using the 2 - deltadeltact method of relative quantification [ 60 ] .
immunohistochemistry immunohistochemical analysis was performed as previously described [ 30 ] .
intestinal tissues dissected from mice were fixed overnight with 10 % formalin buffer ( thermo fisher scientific , fair lawn , nj ) .
the tissues were then paraffinized using a tissue paraffinizer ( shandon excelsior and histocenter , thermo scientific , nj ) .
the paraffinized tissues were embedded onto paraffin blocks and cut into 5 mum sections using a microtome ( microm , thermo scientific , nj ) .
the sections were then dried onto charged slides and used for staining .
the slides containing paraffin - embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized by baking in a 60degreesc oven for 1 hr and subsequent incubation in a xylene bath .
sections were incubated in a 5 % hydrogen peroxide bath to block endogenous tissue peroxidases .
the sections were then hydrated by incubation in a decreasing alcohol bath series ( 100 % , 95 % , 70 %) followed by antigen retrieval in citrate buffer solution ( 10 mm sodium citrate , 0.05 % tween - 20 , ph 6.0 ) at 125degreesc for 10 min using a decloaking chamber ( biocare medical , ca ) .
tissue sections were then incubated with blocking buffer containing avidin ( 2 % milk , 0.05 % tween - 20 , 5 % normal serum ) for 30 min at 37degreesc .
subsequently , antibodies , with biotin , were added to the blocking buffer at appropriate concentrations and incubated with tissue sections for 1 hr at 37degreesc .
sections were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies at the appropriate concentration for 30 min at 37degreesc .

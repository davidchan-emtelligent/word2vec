ycp , as a kind of natural polysaccharides from the mycelium of marine filamentous fungus phoma herbarum ys4108 , has great antitumor potential via enhancement of host immune response , but little is known about the molecular mechanisms .
in the present study , we mainly focused on the effects and mechanisms of ycp on the specific immunity mediated by dendritic cells ( dcs ) and t cells .
t cell / dc activation - related factors including interferon - ( ifn - ) gamma , interleukin - 12 ( il - 12 ) , and il - 4 were examined with elisa .
receptor knock - out mice and fluorescence - activated cell sorting are used to analyze the ycp - binding receptor of t cells and dcs .
rt - pcr is utilized to measure mage - a3 for analyzing the tumor - specific killing effect .
in our study , we demonstrated ycp can provide the second signal for t cell activation , proliferation , and ifn - gamma production through binding to toll - like receptor - ( tlr - ) 2 and tlr - 4 .
ycp could effectively promote il - 12 secretion and expression of markers ( cd80 , cd86 , and mhc ii ) via tlr - 4 on dcs .
antigen - specific immunity against mouse melanoma cells was strengthened through the activation of t cells and the enhancement of capacity of dcs by ycp .
the data supported that ycp can exhibit specific immunomodulatory capacity mediated by t cells and dcs .
1. introduction t cells combine strict target specificity and high efficiency for tumor therapy [ 1 ] .
antigen - presenting cells ( apcs ) activate t cells through a two - signal mechanism : one is initiated by t cell receptor ( tcr ) binding to antigenic peptide presented by major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) molecules and the second signal involves costimulatory molecules that interact with costimulatory receptors on the t cell surface and leads to t cell cytokine production and their proliferation [ 2 ] .
dendritic cells ( dcs ) are believed to be the most potent apcs which have the unique capacity to deliver antigens to t cells and express several costimulatory molecules [ 3 ] .
the second signal required for t cell activation which supports cell survival , memory development , proliferation , and cytokines production found on the surface of dcs has been reported such as b7 family members b7 - 1 ( cd80 ) and b7 - 2 ( cd86 ) [ 4 , 5 ] .
binding b7 - 1 / b7 - 2 to cd28 is the strongest costimulatory signal delivered by dcs to provide a full activation of t cells , promoting their proliferation and il - 2 secretion [ 6 , 7 ] .
cd80 and cd86 have been reported to have particular functions in eliciting t cell activation and inducing differential patterns of cytokine expression supporting type 1 or type 2 t - helper ( th1 or th2 ) response upon binding to cd28 [ 2 , 8 ] .
the primary outcome of cd28 - mediated stimulation on molecular level is an increased production of cytokines such as il - 2 which is important for t cell proliferation , antiapoptosis [ 6 ] .
toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) , as a family of pattern - recognition receptors ( prrs ) , are highly expressed on dc and t cell [ 9 ] .
activation of tlr leads to dc maturation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines , which can induce t cell antitumor immune response [ 10 ] .
many polysaccharides as tlr agonists that function as adjuvant and stimulate dcs to prime antigen - specific t and b cell responses have been reported [ 11 - 13 ] .
on t cells , pretreatment with tlr4 ligand lps enhanced their survival and increased their suppressive activity , whereas tlr4 deficient mice did not respond [ 14 ] .
both tlr and tcr signaling pathways utilize members of the mapk family .
tlr activation of these pathways influences the subsequent tcr - mediated signaling events [ 15 , 16 ] .
tlr agonists can induce activation of cd4 + t lymphocytes , cd8 + t lymphocytes , or cytotoxic t lymphocytes ( ctls ) [ 17 - 19 ] .
these findings prompt that tlr agonists may cause the activation of dc and provide signal required for t cell activation .
ycp ( ycp is the acronym of yancheng polysaccharide ) was purified from the mycelium of phoma herbarum ys4108 that inhabits the sediment in the yellow sea area around yancheng , china .
it has a backbone of alpha - 1,4 - d - glucan with a lower proportion of alpha - 1,6 - linked glucopyranosyl and glucuronic acid residues as nonreducing terminals , and we have previously found that it possesses a great antitumor potential via enhancement of host immune response [ 20 , 21 ] .
however , further studies are still needed to clarify the molecular mechanism of ycp action .
in this study , we mainly focus on the effects and mechanisms of ycp on the specific immunity mediated by dcs and t cells .

2.10 .
in vitro cell models to study the ycp - mediated specific immunity against mouse melanoma cells four cell models were prepared to study the signal provided by ycp during in vitro specific immune responses .
the matured dcs ( wt and tlr4 ko ) and t cells ( wt and tlr4 ko ) were cocultured according to the ratio of 1 : 10 while dcs were resuspended at a density of 2 x 105 cells / ml for 48 h. the mixed cells after being cocultured were used as effector cells ( 2.2 x 106 cells / ml ) , and the b16f10 cells resuspended at a density of 2.2 x 105 cells / ml were used as target cells .

3. results 3.1 .
ycp acts as the second signal in tcr activation on t cell splenic t cells were isolated by nylon fibers to a purity > 90 % ( data not shown ) and then cultured with ycp or cona as the positive control in the 96 - well plate which had been precoated with acd3 functional antibody or pbs .
t cell proliferation was measured after 48 h by mtt assay .
the results indicated that ycp could not stimulate t cell alone. with the precoated acd3 , ycp could significantly stimulate t cell to proliferate in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 1 ( a )) .
in addition to the proliferative effect , the effect of ycp on cytokine production from t cells was evaluated .
the supernatants collected from naive and ycp - stimulated cells were tested by elisa. with the precoated acd3 , ycp could significantly stimulate t cell to produce ifn - gamma in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 1 ( b )) .
the stimulation obtained with ycp on t cell suggests that ycp may be an efficacious second signal in tcr activation just like the contribution of costimulatory molecules on t cell stimulant capable of promoting cell proliferation and producing ifn - gamma .
3.2 .
the enhancement effect of ycp on dcs dcs generated with gm - csf and il - 4 as immature dcs expressed amounts of cd80 , cd86 , and mhc class ii molecules as fully matured dcs .
to determine the purity of monocyte - derived dendritic cells , cd11c was detected by flow cytometry every day .
after 7 days generation with gm - csf and il - 4 , the expression of cd11c has been significantly increased to 82.6 %. and then followed by medium or b16f10ag for 48 h , the expression of cd11c was 88.2 % and 89.3 % , respectively ( figure 2 ( a )) .
to determine the maturation of dcs , the pattern of expression of various cell - surface makers encoding mhc ii , cd80 ( b7 - 1 ) , and cd86 ( b7 - 2 ) was detected by flow cytometry .
there were more matured dcs that coexpressed both mhc class ii and cd11c stimulated by ag and ycp ( figure 2 ( b )) .
cd80 and cd86 on dcs at different times ( 6 h , 12 h , 24 h , and 48 h ) after the stimulations with medium / ag / ycp + ag / lps + ag were analyzed by using the flowjo program ( figure 2 ( c ) - 2 ( f )). with the stimulation of b16f10ag , the expressions of cd80 and cd86 on dcs significantly increased to 66.3 % and 54.1 % at 48 h by contrast with medium group .
such stimulation was delayed up to 24 h after maturation .
ycp assisted the augments of the expressions of cd80 and cd86 on dcs suggesting that ycp could promote the maturation of dcs .
dcs cultured for 7 days were stimulated with medium / ag / ycp + ag / lps + ag for 48 h. the supernatants were obtained and the levels of il - 12 productions were measured by elisa .
ycp could significantly stimulate dcs to produce il - 12 in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 2 ( g )) .
the stimulation mediated by ycp on dcs suggested that ycp is an activator of cell - surface molecule ( mhc class ii , cd80 , and cd86 ) expression and il - 12 production on dcs .
3.3 .
toll - like receptor is the receptor for ycp on t cells and dcs tlrs played a direct role in control of t cell activation including proliferation , cytokine secretion , upregulation of activation markers , and terminal differentiation .
as the receptors on b cells of ycp , tlr2 , and tlr4 had been reported in our previous study , based on these findings , we focused our study on the functional relevance of tlr2 and tlr4 in ycp - mediated tcr activation .
fluoresceinamine - labeled ycp ( fl - ycp ) ( 100 - 1600 nm ) was prepared .
t cells were incubated with pam3csk4 ( a bona fide tlr2 ligand ) , lps ( a bona fide tlr4 ligand ) , and anti - mouse cd28 ( cd28 ligand ) for 1 h , followed by fl - ycp ( 100 - 1600 nm ) for 1 h in competition experiment analyzed by flow cytometry ( figure 3 ( a )) .
the results suggested that ycp as the ligand of tlr2 and tlr4 could compete with pam3csk4 and lps .
cd28 was not the binding target of ycp ; in other words , the ycp t cell activation was achieved by signal provided by tlr without the signal of b7 - 1 / b7 - 2 : cd28 pathway .
to prove this conclusion , we blocked receptors with specific antibodies .
t cells were stimulated with ycp in the presence of anti - tlr2 or anti - tlr4 and then subjected to proliferation assay and total ifn - gamma quantification .
antibodies to tlr2 and tlr4 significantly reduced the proliferation effects of ycp and suppressed the induction of ifn - gamma production with the presence of acd3 ( functional antibody ) which provided first signal for activation of tcr ( figures 3 ( b ) and 3 ( c )). with the presence of anti - tlr2 , t cell proliferation was reduced by 12.1 %. with the presence of anti - tlr4 , t cell proliferation was reduced by 39.3 %. with the presence of anti - tlr2 , the production of ifn - gamma was decreased by 13.1 %. with the presence of anti - tlr4 , the production of ifn - gamma was decreased by 33.8 % .
the reduction was found to be synergetic upon the combined treatment with anti - tlr2 and anti - tlr4 .
therefore , we proposed that tlr2 and tlr4 might be functionally correlated with activation of tcr by ycp as second signal .
as the main receptors of dcs , tlrs have been reported to be important binding targets of polysaccharide vaccine .
anti - tlr4 significantly suppressed the induction of il - 12 production ( 51.8 %) .
to further confirm this statement , the impact that loss of tlr2 or tlr4 has upon ycp activities was evaluated in dcs from either b6.129 - tlr2tm1kir / jnju ( tlr2 ko ) or c57bl / 10scnjnju ( tlr4 ko ) mice .
the upregulations of cd80 and cd86 were reduced on tlr2 ko ( 2.5 % and 1.4 %) and tlr4 ko mice ( 8.5 % and 5.6 %) , especially on tlr4 ko mice ( figure 3 ( e )) .
these findings provided convincing evidence that tlr4 was responsible for activation on dcs by ycp .
3.4 .
ycp strengthens specific immunity against mouse melanoma cells through activation of t cells and enhancement of capacity of dcs dcs cultured for 7 days were stimulated by b16ag for 48 h. t cells were cultured with mdcs at the ratio of 10 : 1 for 48 h as effector cells ( about 2 x 106 cells / ml ) .
the b16f10 cells were resuspended at a density of 2 x 105 cells / ml as target cells .
the effector cells and target cells were cocultured and stimulated by medium or ycp ( 100 - 800 nm ) for 48 h. the number of target cells was measured by the mrna quantitation of mage - a3 .
ycp could not kill target cells directly ( without the effector cells ) ( figure 4 ( a )) and could significantly decrease the mrna of mage - a3 on target cells with the incubation of dcs and t cells in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 4 ( b )) .
the results indicate that ycp could strengthen the destruction of target cells in a dose - dependent manner .
during the incubation , the populations of cd4 + t cells and cd8 + t cells have been increased significantly in 96 h ( figure 4 ( c )) .
the presence of ycp could strengthen this phenomenon that both cd4 + t cells and cd8 + t cells have been improved ( figure 4 ( c )) .
the ratio of cd4 +/ cd8 + is kept stable at 2.20 +/ - 0.01 ( medium ) to 2.22 +/ - 0.02 ( ycp ) which means t cells maintain the biological homeostasis .
the levels of ifn - gamma , il - 12 , and il - 4 productions were measured by elisa .
the production of ifn - gamma and il - 12 reached higher levels and the production of il - 4 was suppressed to a lower level ( figure 4 ( d )) .
the results indicate that ycp enhances the cytotoxicity and cytokine production and promotes activation of apcs and the cell - mediated immunity .
3.5 .
the mechanism of the specific immunity enhancement mediated by ycp as tlr4 was the receptor of ycp on dc and t cell , four cell groups were prepared to study the signal provided by ycp during in vitro specific immune responses as follows ( figure 4 ( e )) : ( a ) matured dcs ( wt ) and t cells ( wt ) , ( b ) matured dcs ( tlr4 ko ) and t cells ( wt ) , ( c ) matured dcs ( wt ) and t cells ( tlr4 ko ) , and ( d ) matured dcs ( tlr4 ko ) and t cells ( tlr4 ko ) .
dcs from different groups cultured for 7 days were stimulated by b16ag for 48 h. t cells from different groups were cultured with mdcs at the ratio of 10 : 1 for 48 h as effector cells ( 2.2 x 106 cells / ml ) .
the b16f10 cells were resuspended at a density of 2 x 105 cells / ml as target cells .
the effector cells and target cells were cocultured and stimulated by medium or ycp ( 400 nm ) for 48 h. the mrna level of mage - a3 on target cells ( figure 4 ( f )) and the levels of ifn - gamma , il - 12 , and il - 4 productions were measured ( figure 4 ( g )) .
the results indicated that ycp can suppress the production of il - 4 and induce the production of il - 12 and ifn - gamma via tlr4 on t cells , while inducing the production of il - 4 , il - 12 , and ifn - gamma via tlr4 on dcs from these in vitro cell models for studying the ycp - mediated specific immunity .
the target cell killing was enhanced with the activations on t cells and dcs via tlr4 induced by ycp .
4. discussion many classes of biomacromolecules containing carbohydrate structures have been shown to exert a successful immune response .
in our previous study ycp was demonstrated to stimulate the activation of macrophages and b cells [ 20 , 26 ] , and in recent years some polysaccharides that function as adjuvant and stimulate dc to induce t cell responses have been reported [ 11 - 13 ] .
however , little is known about the molecular mechanisms that how ycp could interfere with the specific immunity mediated by dc and t cell .
thus , we focus on how ycp performs its function on dcs and t cells .
our current study indicates that ycp - induced tlr activation can induce tcr activation at the presence of functional antibody acd3 [ 27 ] which is the " first " signal of tcr activation on t cells .
when the " first " signal is provided from dc , ycp could also enhance the tcr activation .
lps is used in other studies to enhance antigen - driven proliferation on dc [ 28 , 29 ] .
the functional maturation of dendritic cells has been shown previously to be associated with increased levels of certain t cell costimulatory molecules [ 24 , 30 , 31 ] .
bone marrow - derived dendritic cells generated in the presence of gm - csf and il - 4 exhibit an intermediate maturation stage with respect to phenotype and in vitro antigen - presenting capacity [ 24 ] .
in our study , treatment with lps can result in increasing levels of markers on dcs which is in agreement with previous observations .
furthermore , lps will modify b7 ( b7 - 1 and b7 - 2 ) expression of monocytes [ 31 ] .
ycp is demonstrated which could increase the expression of cd80 , cd86 , and mhc - ii in dcs and then strongly enhances t cell activation .
then , activated t cells can produce ifn - gamma .
furthermore , the secretion of th1 - type cytokines il - 12 and ifn - gamma was increased while th2 - type cytokine il - 4 was decreased by ycp in vitro .
induction of this immune response is a desirable characteristic for an immune adjuvant .
the t - helper cell amplifies itself by secreting lymphokines .
this action of ycp can enhance the helper cell response as well as the immune system 's response to foreign antigens .
similar effects of other fungal carbohydrates have been reported by several existing literatures .
wang et al .
[ 32 ] found that sarcodon imbricatus polysaccharide ( sip ) could prominently promote the production of il - 2 and ifn - gamma , indicating that sip could positively regulate the immunoreactions ; meanwhile sip significantly decreased the content of il - 4 which negatively regulated the immunoreactions .
yoshino et al .
[ 33 ] investigated the effect of lentinan on modulating th1 and th2 responses in patients with digestive cancers .
after lentinan treatment , cd4 + ifn - gamma + t cell percentages increased significantly , whereas cd4 + il - 4 + t cell percentage decreased significantly , suggesting that lentinan may improve the balance between th1 and th2 .
a polysaccharide designated as the d - fraction , isolated from maitake ( grifola frondosa ) , can reduce the expression of th2 cytokine il - 4 but markedly increase the expression of th1 cytokine ifn - gamma in cd4 + t cells and also increase il - 12p70 production , indicating that d - fraction promotes the differentiation into th1 cells of cd4 + t cells [ 34 ] .
cd4 + t cells augment the immune response by secreting cytokines that stimulate either a cytotoxic t cell response ( th1 cytokine ) or an antibody response ( th2 cytokine ) [ 35 ] .
in addition to the results of the present study , our previous study showed that ycp can also generate a robust antibody response on b cells .
melanoma associated antigens ( mages ) are found in melanoma as tumor - associated antigens ( taas ) and some of these proteins , such as mage - 1 , mage - a3 , and mage - a10 , are believed to be the detection and diagnostic target of melanoma [ 36 ] .
mage - a3 , which is not expressed in noncancer cells , is highly specific tumor mrna marker , and it can be recognized by t cells which attack the b16f10 cells in a highly specific manner [ 37 - 39 ] .
ycp could not kill melanoma cells directly but could significantly decrease the number of target cells with the incubation of dcs and t cells .
tlr agonists , such as pam3csk4 , lps , are demonstrated to promote dc and t cell activation and the engagement of tlrs in the induction of dc and t cell has been studied in the last few years [ 40 , 41 ] .
competitive inhibition at tlr2 and tlr4 by using pam3csk4 , lps as ligands with fl - ycp , indicates the potential receptors of ycp on t cell .
antibody blocking experiment and gene defect experiment provide convincing evidence that tlr4 is responsible for activation on dc by ycp and tlr2 and tlr4 are responsible for t cell activation by ycp .
5. conclusions in conclusion , we demonstrate that ycp acts as the " second " signal of t cell activation to promote t cell proliferation and ifn - gamma secretion via tlr2 and tlr4 .
ycp can effectively promote il - 12 secretion and expression of markers ( cd80 , cd86 , and mhc ii ) via tlr4 on dcs .
the data support that ycp is a good candidate for tumor - specific immunotherapy to enhance signals of antigen presentation process , antigen - specific t cell proliferation , th1 cytokine induction , and tumor - specific killing .

the urinary tract is frequently being exposed to potential pathogens and rapid defence mechanisms are therefore needed .
cathelicidin , a human antimicrobial peptide is expressed and secreted by bladder epithelial cells and protects the urinary tract from infection .
here we show that vitamin d can induce cathelicidin in the urinary bladder .
we analyzed bladder tissue from postmenopausal women for expression of cathelicidin , before and after a three - month period of supplementation with 25 - hydroxyvitamin d3 ( 25d3 ) .
cell culture experiments were performed to elucidate the mechanisms for cathelicidin induction .
we observed that , vitamin d per se did not up - regulate cathelicidin in serum or in bladder tissue of the women in this study .
however , when the bladder biopsies were infected with uropathogenic e. coli ( upec ) , a significant increase in cathelicidin expression was observed after 25d3 supplementation .
this observation was confirmed in human bladder cell lines , even though here , cathelicidin induction occurred irrespectively of infection .
vitamin d treated bladder cells exerted an increased antibacterial effect against upec and colocalization to cathelicidin indicated the relevance of this peptide .
in the light of the rapidly growing problem of resistance to common urinary tract antibiotics , we suggest that vitamin d may be a potential complement in the prevention of uti .
introduction urinary tract infection ( uti ) remains an important disease and becomes more frequent in women after menopause .
due to the proximity of the highly colonized perineum , the urinary tract epithelium must be able to sense pathogens and elicit a fast innate immune response in order to keep its integrity [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
previously we demonstrated that the human antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin was up - regulated upon e. coli infection and that it significantly contributes to the protection of the urinary tract in humans and in mice [ 3 ] .
here , we investigate vitamin d - induced boosting of cathelicidin in the urinary bladder .
vitamin d , apart from its well - known task to regulate calcium metabolism , has been recognized to influence innate and acquired immune reactions [ 4 ] .
skin exposure to sunlight and dietary intake of fatty fish and dairy products are the predominant sources of vitamin d [ 5 ] .
in the liver , hydroxylation takes place and 25 - hydroxyvitamin d3 ( 25d3 ) is produced .
the inactive form 25d3 is converted in the kidney to its active metabolite 1,25d3 by the hydroxylase cyp27b1 [ 6 ] .
1,25d3 binds to the vitamin d receptor ( vdr ) and is transported into the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor .
recently , it has been shown that also non - renal tissue can convert 25d3 to 1,25d3 [ 4 ] .
several studies have concluded an intimate relationship between vitamin d and cathelicidin production .
vitamin d can induce the human cathelicidin gene ( camp ) expression by binding to the vitamin d responsive element ( vdre ) of the camp promoter [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] in various tissues , e.g. , keratinocytes [ 9 ] , respiratory epithelium [ 10 ] and monocytes [ 11 ] .
consequently , increased synthesis of cathelicidin after vitamin d treatment has been observed .
we hypothesized that vitamin d could influence cathelicidin production also in the urinary tract and thereby help protecting from invading microbes .
we show that urinary bladder cells enhance cathelicidin production in response to vitamin d. moreover , we demonstrate the relevance of these findings in bladder tissue from postmenopausal women receiving 25d3 supplementation .
we also provide evidence that this increased production has an antimicrobial effect .
our findings indicate that 25d3 may be a potential complement in the prevention of uti .
results postmenopausal women have low levels of serum vitamin d which increase after 25d3 supplementation after menopause , women have an increased risk of uti , coinciding with decreased vitamin d and estrogen levels .
we analysed 25d3 levels in serum from 22 swedish healthy postmenopausal and , for comparison , six premenopausal women .
the median serum 25d3 values were 56 nmol / l and 74 nmol / l , respectively ( p < 0.05 ) .
in the group of postmenopausal women , only five women ( 23 %) had 25d3 levels above the recommended level of 75 nmol / l [ 12 ] .
one was vitamin d deficient (< 25 nmol / l ) , nine were insufficient (< 50 nmol / l ) and the levels of the remaining seven women were between 50 and 75 nmol / l ( figure 1 ) .
eight healthy postmenopausal women were later recruited for vitamin d supplementation , with bladder biopsies taken before and after the treatment period .
intake of 2000 units of 25d3 daily increased their median values of 25d3 in serum from 68.5 nmol / l to 104.5 nmol / l after 6 weeks ( p < 0.001 ) and further to 117 nmol / l after 12 weeks ( p < 0.01 , figure 2a ) .
notably , no correlation was seen between serum levels of 25d3 and cathelicidin in the serum before and after 6 or 12 weeks treatment ( figure 2b ) .
calcium , phosphate and parathyroid hormone were within the physiological range and not affected by 25d3 treatment .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0015580.g001 figure 1 low levels of vitamin d3 in postmenopausal women .
serum vitamin d3 levels in postmenopausal women are low compared to premenopausal women , p < 0.05 ( mann - whitney test ) .
individual data are presented with median levels ( 56 nmol / l and 74 nmol / l ) .
the recommended level of 75 nmol / l is marked with a dotted line .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0015580.g002 figure 2 25d3 and cathelicidin in serum and bladder tissue of women during a three - month period of 25d3 supplementation .
postmenopausal women were treated with 2000 units of oral 25d3 daily for 12 weeks .
serum samples were collected before , at 6 and 12 weeks .
serum 25d3 levels increased from a baseline median value of 68.5 nmol / l to 104.5 nmol / l at 6 weeks , p < 0.001 ( wilcoxon rank test ) , and 117 nmol / l at 12 weeks , p < 0.01 ( wilcoxon rank test ) .
the dotted line denotes the recommended serum 25d3 level of 75 nmol / l and median values are indicated ( a ) .
despite treatment with 25d3 , serum cathelicidin levels did not increase ( b ). e. coli - infected bladder biopsies from women receiving 25d3 supplementation responded with higher expression of camp mrna , p < 0.05 ( mann - whitney test ) ( c ) and cathelicidin protein , p < 0.05 ( mann - whitney test ) ( d ) compared to infected pieces prior to supplementation .
fluorescence immunohistochemistry showed increased cathelicidin protein expression in infected bladder biopsies .
tissue samples shown are from the same patient before ( e ) and after ( f ) 12 weeks of 25d3 treatment .
cathelicidin is localized in the uroepithelium including the larger umbrella cells closest to the bladder lumen .
staining without primary antibody serves as negative control ( g ) .
images are captured at x63 magnification and depict an area corresponding to 119x119 microm .
cathelicidin is stained with alexafluor 594 ( red ) , the cell nucleus with dapi ( blue ) .
25d3 increases camp expression in e. coli - infected urinary bladder epithelium vitamin d has been shown to activate the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin in a range of human cell types [ 13 ] .
therefore , we investigated if this process also occurs in the urinary bladder .
vitamin d treatment per se did not increase cathelicidin mrna or protein in bladder tissue , as determined by quantitative rt - pcr and microscopy , respectively ( data not shown ) .
bladder biopsies taken before and after supplementation were also infected with e. coli cft073 ex vivo .
after 25d3 supplementation , we found an increase in camp expression upon infection compared to biopsies prior to supplementation ( p < 0.05 , figure 2c ) .
likewise , an increase in cathelicidin protein expression was observed ( p < 0.05 , figure 1d ) .
confocal microscope images showed that before 25d3 intake , infection - induced cathelicidin production was restricted mainly to the superficial umbrella cells ( figure 1e ) .
after supplementation however , more cathelicidin was produced and was also seen in cells located deeper in the bladder epithelium ( figure 2f ) .
the converting enzyme cyp27b1 is present in the human urinary bladder to explain the effect of 25d3 on cathelicidin production in the bladder of vitamin d - supplemented women , we hypothesized that conversion of 25d3 to 1,25d3 takes place in the bladder epithelium .
therefore we investigated whether cyp27b1 , the enzyme necessary for this conversion , is present in bladder epithelial cells .
using rt - pcr , we found cyp27b1 mrna in normal human bladder cells and tissue , and in all three bladder cell lines studied ( figure 3a ). by immunofluorescence microscopy , we could detect the presence of cyp27b1 in bladder tissue sections ( figure 3b ) , localized throughout the cytoplasm with an abundance of staining seen in the peri - nuclear area , consistent with its association to mitochondria [ 14 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0015580.g003 figure 3 bladder epithelial cells are equipped with the machinery for local 25d3 conversion and activity .
expression of cyp27b1 , vdr and cyp24a1 was detected on mrna level in normal bladder cells ( hbep ) and three bladder cells lines ( tert - nhuc , 5637 and t24 ) by rt - pcr ( a , c , e ) and on protein level in tissue from bladder biopsies by fluorescence immunohistochemistry ( b , d , f ) .
mrna expression results were normalized to expression in the kidney epithelial cell line a498 .
the proteins are stained with alexafluor 594 ( red ) , the cell nucleus with dapi ( blue ) .
cyp27b1 protein was detected in the bladder mucosa where it was evenly distributed in the bladder epithelial layers with an abundance of staining seen in the peri - nuclear area , consistent with its association to mitochondria ( b ) .
vdr protein was localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus ( d ) .
low levels of the cyp24a1 protein were detected in bladder mucosa ( f ) .
all images are captured at x63 magnification and the right panels of images b , d and f show controls stained without primary antibodies against cyp27b1 , vdr and cyp24a1 , respectively .
inactive 25d3 is converted to active 1,25d3 in bladder epithelial cells based on the findings that bladder epithelial cells are equipped with the machinery for local 25d3 conversion , we investigated the biological function of cyp27b1 in bladder epithelial cells .
normal human bladder cells were exposed to 25d3 for 24 hours .
conversion to active vitamin d was confirmed by the presence of 1,25d3 in the cell culture supernatant at a concentration of > 0.4x10 - 9 m. the concentration of 1,25d3 in culture medium from untreated cells and 25d3 supplemented medium without cells was below detection limit (< 0.02x10 - 9 m ) .
the vitamin d receptor is expressed in the urinary bladder and in bladder epithelial cells to up - regulate cathelicidin , active 1,25d3 binds to the vdr .
thus , we investigated the presence of vdr in bladder epithelial cells and bladder tissue from biopsies .
bladder cells and bladder tissue expressed vdr mrna constitutively , most abundantly in normal human bladder cells and in cell line 5637 ( figure 3c ) .
vdr protein was detected in bladder epithelium by immunofluorescence microscopy .
on a cellular level , it was distributed both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus ( figure 3d ) .
the 1,25d3 metabolizing enzyme cyp24a1 is expressed in the urinary bladder and in bladder epithelial cells since the 25 - hydroxyvitamin d3 24 - hydroxylase ( cyp24a1 ) is considered important in determining the biological half - life of 1,25d3 [ 15 ] , we examined the expression of this enzyme in the urinary bladder tissue and in the cell lines used in this study .
low levels of gene - specific mrna were detected in all cell lines except for t24 cells , which expressed cyp24a1 at higher levels ( figure 3e ) .
bladder tissue showed both mrna and detectable but low protein expression of cyp24a1 ( figure 3f ) .
1,25d3 and 25d3 enhance cathelicidin production we further investigated the biological effect of 25d3 and 1,25d3 on vitamin d - dependent gene expression in bladder cells .
as a negative feedback regulator in vitamin d metabolism , the hydroxylase cyp24a1 is strongly induced by 1,25d3 [ 15 ] .
in response to 1,25d3 , expression of cyp24a1 was highly up - regulated in normal bladder cells and tert - nhuc ( figure 4a and b ) .
cyp24a1 up - regulation was also observed after incubation with 25d3 , indicating conversion of 25d3 to 1,25d3 ( figure 4a and b ) .
an up - regulation of camp in the presence of 1,25d3 or 25d3 was observed in all cell lines tested .
normal bladder cells showed higher induction than tert - nhuc bladder cells , 21 - fold and 5 - fold respectively ( figure 4c and d ) .
in the bladder epithelial cell lines t24 and 5637 , 1,25d3 - mediated camp induction was 16 - fold and 140 - fold , respectively ( data not shown ) .
the expression of vdr was not influenced by 1,25d3 or 25d3 ( figure 4e - f ) .
a small induction of cyp27b1 was observed in tert - nhuc bladder cells ( figure 4g ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0015580.g004 figure 4 human bladder cells respond with cyp24a1 and camp induction to 1,25d3 and 25d3 .
normal bladder cells ( hbep , upper panel ) and tert - nhuc bladder cells ( lower panel ) were stimulated with 10 - 7 m 25d3 or 10 - 8 m 1,25d3 for 24 hours .
levels of gene - specific mrna for cyp24a1 ( a , b ) , camp ( c , d ) , vdr ( e , f ) and cyp27b1 ( g , h ) in stimulated cells were determined and are presented as fold change compared to vector - treated control cells .
data presented are pooled from three independent experiments and shown as mean and standard deviation ; *** p < 0.001 , ** p < 0.01 , * p < 0.05 ( anova with dunnett 's post - test ) .
to determine whether camp gene expression correlates with increased protein production , immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry was performed .
cathelicidin levels increased significantly in tert - nhuc cells after 48 hours of 1,25d3 or 25d3 treatment ( p < 0.001 , figure 5a and b ) .
cells pre - treated with vitamin d and infected with e. coli cft073 expressed even higher levels of cathelicidin ( p < 0.05 for 25d3 +/ - upec , figure 5a and b ) .
flow cytometry confirmed an increase of cathelicidin in 25d3 and 1,25d3 treated cells after e. coli infection ( figure 5c ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0015580.g005 figure 5 1,25d3 or 25d3 in combination with e. coli increased cathelicidin protein in bladder epithelial cells .
production of cathelicidin increased in tert - nhuc bladder cells after treatment with 1,25d3 or 25d3 , and was further increased by infection with e. coli cft073 ( upec ) .
images are captured at x63 magnification and depict an area corresponding to 119x119 microm ( a ) .
the control image ( neg control ) is shown in the right upper panel .
fluorescence intensity was quantified and is presented as mean values with standard deviation ; *** p < 0.001 , * p < 0.05 ( anova with dunnett 's post - test ) ( b ) .
an increase in cathelicidin protein was also recorded by flow cytometry in e. coli - infected tert - nhuc bladder cells treated with 1,25d3 or 25d3 .
grey is vector + e. coli , red is 1,25d3 10 - 8 m + e. coli and black is 25d3 10 - 7 m + e. coli ( c ) .
vitamin d promotes cell - mediated killing of upec next , we investigated the biological effect of the increased cathelicidin production in vitamin d - treated cells .
we therefore assessed the antibacterial properties of treated versus untreated cells against upec strain cft073. by confocal microscopy , we visualized antibacterial activity on a cellular level .
killing of cell - associated bacteria was demonstrated by live / dead staining ( figure 6a ) .
the significance of cathelicidin was demonstrated by colocalization of cathelicidin with bacterial cells ( figure 6b ) .
to quantify antibacterial activity and the contribution of cathelicidin , antibacterial assays in conditioned medium were performed .
supernatant from bladder epithelial cells treated with 1,25d3 decreased growth of e. coli cft073 by 44 % in tert - nhuc , 47 % in t24 , and by 23 % in 5637 cells .
likewise , growth in cell lysates was inhibited by 36 % in 5637 and tert - nhuc cells and by 27 % in t24 cells ( figure 6c ) .
1,25d3 in medium without cells had no antibacterial effect ( data not shown ) .
in the presence of a cathelicidin - neutralizing antibody , the antimicrobial effect of the cell supernatant was significantly reduced , confirming the impact of cathelicidin ( figure 6d ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0015580.g006 figure 6 vitamin d increases the cathelicidin - mediated antibacterial effect of bladder epithelial cells .
cell - associated upec are killed as determined with live / dead staining where live bacteria are stained green and dead bacteria are stained red ( a ) .
upec attach and invade bladder cells and are colocalized with cathelicidin .
gfp - labelled e. coli cft073 is green and cathelicidin is stained with alexafluor 594 ( red ) ; regions of colocalization are yellow ( b ) .
the antibacterial effect induced by 1,25d3 was measured in medium from tert - nhuc , 5637 and t24 bladder cells after stimulation for 48 hours. e. coli cft073 was incubated in conditioned medium from treated cells for 90 minutes ( supernatant ) .
cells from the same experiment were harvested and lysed ( cell lysate ) .
the resulting bacterial count is shown as percentage of vector treated control cells .
mean values with standard deviation are shown from three independent experiments ; *** p < 0.001 , ** p < 0.01 and * p < 0.05 ( anova with dunnett 's post - test ) ( c ) .
adding a neutralizing anti - cathelicidin antibody ( alpha - cathelicidin ab ) to the conditioned medium from tert - nhuc bladder cells blocked the antibacterial effect , whereas conditioned medium in the presence of an irrelevant antibody maintained its antibacterial activity .
mean values with standard deviation are shown from four independent experiments ; * p < 0.05 ( anova with dunnett 's post - test ) ( d ) .
discussion here we show that oral 25d3 supplementation of healthy postmenopausal women prepares the bladder tissue to fight e. coli infection by increased production of cathelicidin upon bacterial contact .
25d3 is locally converted to 1,25d3 in bladder epithelial cells , binds to vdr , which leads to up - regulation of camp and synthesis of cathelicidin .
the increased production in turn enhances the direct antibacterial effect on upec .
women in menopause are prone to uti .
this is traditionally mainly attributed to anatomical reasons and mucosal atrophy. with age , vdr expression decreases [ 16 ] and there are reports suggesting that women have lower vitamin d intake than men [ 17 ] .
the most important source of vitamin d is uvb - induced photoactivation of previtamin d in the skin [ 18 ] .
because of its geographical latitude , sweden has only few hours of sunlight during winter season .
hence , low levels of vitamin d in the study population were anticipated .
still , it was surprising that 77 % of otherwise healthy postmenopausal women did not have sufficient vitamin d levels .
we therefore hypothesized that vitamin d may be involved also in the defence against uti , and that this is mediated by cathelicidin .
the relatively high dose of 25d3 used in this study did not affect constitutive cathelicidin production in the urinary bladder .
however , a local up - regulation was observed in the tissue in response to infection with upec .
interestingly , 2000 units of 25d3 daily , about five times the recommended daily dose [ 19 ] , showed no increase in serum cathelidicin and did not influence serum calcium levels .
this is in line with previous reports showing no correlation between high doses of vitamin d2 and circulating levels of cathelicidin [ 20 ] .
thus , we speculate that 25d3 prepares the cells to produce more cathelicidin only when needed to protect the urinary tract from bacterial infection .
vitamin d is a well - studied compound and currently supplementation of 25d3 is being widely recommended [ 12 ] .
clinical studies using 10 times the dose given in the present study reported serum concentrations of 400 nmol / l with no hypercalcemia or hypercalcuria [ 21 ] .
the risk for unwanted side effects with the given dose in our study is therefore limited .
vitamin d has successfully been used to enhance the immunity to pathogens in the respiratory tract [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
for this local protection to occur , conversion of 25d3 to active 1,25d3 in peripheral tissue is needed .
here , we localized the converting enzyme cyp27b1 in the uroepithelium and in normal bladder cells .
activity of cyp27b1 was indicated by the detection of 1,25d3 in culture medium from 25d3 treated bladder cells , suggesting a local function of 1,25d3 within the bladder mucosa .
we also confirm earlier studies showing vdr expression in bladder tissue [ 24 ] .
normal bladder cells and 5637 had the highest induction of camp , coinciding with higher vdr levels .
this raises the question if age - dependent loss of vdr may lead to increased risk of uti .
the results from cell lines differed from bladder tissue with respect to cyp27b1 and cyp24a1 .
this may well reflect the difference between a monolayer of cells in culture and the complex nature of the multilayered urothelium with cells at different level of differentiation .
both 25d3 and 1,25d3 up - regulated cathelicidin production in various bladder cell lines , and as a result , treated cells mediated increased antibacterial activity .
in the investigated cells , induction was observed by vitamin d without additional stimuli .
this is in line with what previously has been demonstrated in respiratory epithelial cells [ 25 ] .
in contrast , in monocytes additional stimulation via toll - like receptor ( tlr ) is needed to induce cathelicidin production [ 26 ] .
we cannot rule out that our observed differences in tissue versus cultured cells are due to lower concentrations of 25d3 and 1,25d3 in the target cells in vivo .
it is plausible that , at these concentrations , additional stimuli such as tlr signalling are needed to induce detectable cathelicidin levels .
on the other hand , bacteria alone did not increase cathelicidin intracellularly under the experimental conditions used here .
this has previously been observed for non - pathogenic e. coli and neisseria ; in contrast , even a down - regulation was observed [ 27 ] .
we believe that the presence of vitamin d is sufficient and necessary to induce cathelicidin , and might further be enhanced by the presence of bacteria .
our results suggest a role for vitamin d in the protection against uti .
so far , no data are available on vitamin d levels and uti incidence .
still , there is an established link between vitamin d deficiency and tuberculosis [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] and viral respiratory infections [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
accordingly , low levels of vdr and vdr polymorphisms have been associated with such infections in young children [ 32 ] .
in light of the emerging resistance to antibiotics used against uti [ 33 ] , new treatment strategies are needed .
our data suggest that vitamin d can stimulate an increased production of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin. by inducing and activating cathelicidin with vitamin d , a local rather than a systemic effect can be achieved .
this could offer selective and site - specific treatment of pathogens without perturbing commensal microbes elsewhere in the body .
likewise , systemic effects of 25d3 treatment secondary to cathelicidin induction seem unlikely .
this could make 25d3 an effective and safe way of activating the endogenous antimicrobial response locally at the site of infection .
determining the vitamin d status of individuals with a history of uti may be of importance to evaluate their ability to fend off intruding bacteria .
supplementation to restore proper vitamin d levels may therefore help preparing the bladder epithelium to mount a stronger and faster immune response once bacteria enter the bladder .
materials and methods human participants the study was approved by regionala etikprovningsnamnden ( epn ) , stockhom ( the regional ethics committe , stockholm ) , protocol 2008 / 968 - 31 .
it was performed in accordance to the helsinki declaration .
informed written consent was obtained from volunteers involved in the study .
initially , 22 postmenopausal and six premenopausal swedish women of european descent ( median age 59 ) were analyzed regarding their serum vitamin d levels .
eight additional women ( median age 62 ) were later recruited to receive daily oral supplementation with 2000 units of 25d3 ( recip , meda pharmaceuticals ) for 12 weeks .
they had no history of urinary tract abnormalities and none of the women received any dietary supplements or hormonal treatment at the time of the study .
before starting vitamin d supplementation , cystoscopy was performed and superficial biopsies were taken from the urinary bladder wall .
after 12 weeks , follow - up biopsies were taken the same way .
out of these eight women , five women underwent the complete procedure .
serum samples were collected before as well as 6 and 12 weeks after treatment and analyzed for 25d3 , cathelicidin , calcium , glucose , parathyroid hormone and phosphate .
urinalysis dipsticks ( nitristic , raerad products ) were used to rule out bacteriuria .
measurement of 25d3 and 1,25d3 serum samples were protected from light and stored at - 80degreesc prior to analysis .
total 25d3 analyses were performed using liasion 25 - oh vitamin d total kit , an antibody - based chemiluminescence assay , detection limit 10 nmol / l ( diasorin inc. ) .
1,25d3 in cell supernatants was determined with the gamma - b 1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin d ria kit , detection limit 0.02 nmol / l , cross - reactivity between 25d3 and 1,25d3 0.001 % ( immunodiagnostic systems ) .
measurement of serum cathelicidin cathelicidin in serum samples was measured using an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( hycult technologies ) .
after thawing , serum samples were diluted 20 times and assayed as recommended by the manufacturer .
detection range was 0.14 - 100 ng / l. bacteria uropathogenic e. coli strain cft073 was isolated from a patient with acute pyelonephritis and expresses type 1 - , p - and s fimbriae as well as alpha - hemolysin .
bacteria were grown overnight on blood agar at 37degreesc , and then in lb broth for another 4 hours to reach logarithmic phase of growth .
bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and then washed twice with pbs .
the bacterial concentration was measured by spectrophotometry and confirmed by viable count .
bladder biopsy infection bladder biopsies were immediately transferred to serum - free dmem ( invitrogen ) containing low - dose gentamicin ( 1 microg / ml ) with or without e. coli cft073 at 108 cfu / ml and incubated at 37degreesc for 2 hours .
biopsies were then gently washed in pbs and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( pfa ) or homogenized for rna extraction using rneasy micro kit ( qiagen ) according to the instructions from the manufacturer .
fixed tissue was embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 4 microm .
cells tert - nhuc , normal human telomerase - immortalized urothelial cells were kindly provided by prof m knowles , university of leeds .
these cells resemble normal urinary bladder cells to a high degree [ 34 ] .
cells were maintained in keratinocyte serum - free medium supplemented with bovine pituitary extract and epidermal growth factor ( invitrogen ) .
normal human bladder epithelium cells ( hbep ) were obtained from cellntec and cultured in bladder epithelium medium ( cnt - 58 , cellntec ) .
all experiments with normal bladder cells were performed within five passages .
urinary bladder cell lines t24 ( atcc no. htb - 4 ) and 5637 ( atcc no. htb - 9 ) and kidney epithelial cell line a498 ( atcc no. htb - 44 ) were maintained in mccoy 's medium , rpmi - 1640 ( invitrogen ) and eagle 's mem ( sigma - aldrich ) respectively , supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) .
cell lines and hbep were maintained in 5 % co2 and 80 % humidity at 37degreesc and 35degreesc respectively .
cell experiments cell experiments were carried out in 6 or 24 well cell culture plates ( costar ) , or falcon primaria tissue culture plates ( bd falcon ) for tert - nhuc cells .
when cells were near - confluent , medium containing 2 % charcoal treated fbs for t24 and 5637 , or fresh serum - free medium for tert - nhuc cells and normal bladder cells , was added , supplemented with 1,25d3 ( a kind gift from dr. m. uskokovic , bioxell ) , 25d3 ( calbiochem ) or vector alone ( ethanol ) .
25d3 concentrations of 10 - 7 m were needed for a consistent camp response in bladder cells whereas 1,25d3 concentrations of 10 - 8 m resulted in similar induction .
all cell experiments with vitamin d were performed away from direct light .
rt - pcr rna was extracted using rneasy mini kit ( qiagen ) according to instructions .
concentration and purity of rna was determined spectrophotometerically at 260 and 280 nm. an aliquot of 0.5 - 1 microg of rna was reversely transcribed using m - mulv reverse transcriptase ( finnzymes ) .
real - time pcr was performed on a rotorgene 3000 ( corbett research ) with primers and probes from applied biosystems ; camp hs00189038 _ m1 , cyp24a1 hs00167999 _ m1 , cyp27b1 hs00168017 _ m1 , vdr hs01045844 _ m1 .
18s rrna was used as housekeeping gene .
for relative mrna expression , fold change in gene expression was calculated using the 2 - deltadeltac t method .
since cyp27b1 , vdr and cyp24a1 are known to be expressed in the kidney epithelium , the kidney cell line a498 was used as a positive control .
mrna expression in bladder cells and tissue were therefore normalized to the levels in a498 .
immunofluorescence confocal microscopy cells on cover - slips ( vwr ) were grown in the presence of 25d3 , 1,25d3 or vector for 48 hours .
for infection , 107 e. coli cft073 per ml was added for 90 minutes .
cells were fixed in 4 % pfa in pbs .
antibodies and blocking sera were diluted in 0.1 % triton x - 100 in pbs .
unspecific antibody staining was blocked using 10 % rabbit serum ( sigma - aldrich ) for 60 minutes , followed by fx signal enhancer ( invitrogen ) for 30 minutes .
primary antibodies used were : anti - cathelicidin monoclonal antibody 3d11 ( hycult technologies ) 1:200 for 60 min , this antibody recognizes both the pro - form ( hcap18 ) and the cleaved form ( ll - 37 ) ; anti - vdr monoclonal antibody ma1 - 710 ( affinity bioreagents ) 1:400 for 30 minutes , anti - cyp27b1 polyclonal antibody d - 20 ( santa cruz ) 1:200 for 30 minutes and anti - cyp24a1 polyclonal antibody ( sigman aldrich ) 1:150 for 30 minutes .
secondary antibodies were : alexafluor 594 - conjugated rabbit anti - mouse , anti - rat or anti - goat antibody ( invitrogen ) 1:400 for 30 minutes , or fitc - conjugated anti - goat antibody ( abd serotec ) 1:600 for 30 minutes .
nuclei were counterstained with dapi ( invitrogen ) .
specificity of immunolabelling was controlled in preparations without primary antibody .
deparaffinized and rehydrated bladder sections were stained as above , except primary antibody staining was carried out at 4degreesc overnight .
prolong gold antifade mounting medium ( invitrogen ) was used .
images were acquired with a leica tcs sp5 confocal microscope .
fluorescence intensity was quantified using the imagej image processing software ( u. s. national institutes of health ) [ 35 ] .
for live / dead staining , cells were infected with 107 e. coli cft073 per ml for 60 minutes , washed to remove unbound bacteria and incubated for an additional 60 minutes .
cells were permeabilized with 0.2 % saponin in pbs for 5 minutes , before adding live / dead bacterial stain ( invitrogen ) for 15 minutes .
cells were then mounted and analyzed by microscopy immediately .
for colocalization studies , gfp - labelled cft073 strain lt004 ( a kind gift from prof agneta richter - dahlfors , karolinska institutet ) was used [ 36 ] .
flow cytometry cells were exposed to 25d3 , 1,25d3 or vector as described .
after detachment by trypsinization , they were washed in pbs , fixed and permeabilized using the bd cytofix / cytoperm ( tm ) plus according to instructions and stained with antibodies for 30 - 40 minutes at 4degreesc .
cells were stained with an anti - cathelicidin monoclonal antibody 1 - 1c12 1:100 ( hycult technologies ) followed by an alexafluor 488 - conjugated anti - mouse igg secondary antibody ( invitrogen ) .
the cells were analyzed on a becton dickinson facscalibur ( tm ) flow cytometer using the cellquest ( tm ) software ( bd biosciences immunocytometry systems ) .
antibacterial assay after stimulation of bladder cells with 10 - 8 m 1,25d3 or vector for 48 hours , 150 microl supernatant was incubated with 50 microl of 104 cfu / ml e. coli cft073 on a shaker at 37degreesc for 90 minutes .
an aliquot was plated on blood agar and colonies were counted after incubation overnight .
in selected experiments , 1 microg / ml anti - cathelicidin monoclonal antibody 3d11 ( hycult technologies ) or igg1 isotype control ( bd biosciences ) was added to the cell supernatant for 120 minutes prior to bacterial coincubation .
for intracellular antibacterial assay , vitamin d - stimulated cells were lysed in 1 % triton x - 100 in pbs , centrifuged at 8000xg for 5 minutes and used for antibacterial assay as described above .
statistics all statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism 4.01 .
mann - whitney test , wilcoxon rank test or anova with appropriate post test were used .
spearman rank test was used for correlation between 25d3 and cathelicidin levels in serum .
p - level of less than 0.05 was considered significant .

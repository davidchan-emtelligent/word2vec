similar reactions with ethyl cyanoacetate successfully afforded the functionalized spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridines ] and spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridinones ] as the main products according to the structures of the arylamines and other primary amines .
1,4 - dihydropyridine electron - deficient alkyne four - component reaction isatin one - pot reaction spiro compound introduction beta - enaminones and beta - enamino esters represent important synthetic building blocks for the development of versatile carbon - carbon bond - formation reactions and heterocyclic constructions [ 1 - 5 ] .
in recent years , the in situ generated beta - enamino esters , which could be easily obtained from the addition of aliphatic or aromatic primary amines to the activated alkynes , have been widely recognized as practical synthons for the synthesis of a wide variety of heterocycles and pharmaceutical compounds [ 6 - 11 ] .
many domino reactions have been developed by trapping this kind of beta - enamino ester with sequential adding of nucleophilic or electrophilic reagents to give versatile nitrogen - containing compounds and n,o - heterocycles [ 12 - 23 ] .
recently , perumal and we have both developed an efficient synthetic procedure for functionalized spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridines ] by domino reactions of in situ generated beta - enamino esters , isatin and malononitrile with triethylamine as the base catalyst [ 24 - 25 ] .
a literature survey indicated that there has been an explosion of activity around the synthesis of spirooxindoles in the past years [ 26 - 31 ] .
encouraged by these results , and hunting for new synthetic methods for functionalized spirooxindoles , we investigated the domino reactions of arylamines , methyl propiolate , aromatic aldehydes and malononitrile ( ethyl cyanoacetate ) and successfully developed a facile synthetic procedure for functionalized spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridines ] and spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridinones ] .
results and discussion the efficient formation of functionalized spiro [ indole - 3,4 ' - pyridines ] via the four - component reaction prompted us to study the reaction scope further [ 25 ] .
another widely used electron - deficient alkyne reagent , methyl propiolate , was utilized to replace dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate as one component .
the addition reaction of aniline to methyl propiolate to give the active adducts , 3 - arylaminoacrylates , usually needs more than twelve hours .
thus , we decided firstly to let arylamine and methyl propiolate react in ethanol at room temperature for 24 hours .
tlc analysis indicated that the addition reaction had finished , and tlc analysis indicated that almost exclusively the desired beta - arylaminoacrylates existed in the solution .
then isatin and malononitrile as well as triethylamine were added to the system and the mixture was heated under reflux for an additional 24 hours .
the expected spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridines ] 1a - 1p were obtained in good yields by using this one - pot domino reaction procedure ( table 1 ) .
it can be seen that aniline bearing methoxy , methyl or chloro groups all reacted smoothly to give the expected spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridines ] with marginal effect .
benzylamine also afforded good yields of the spiro product .
the structures of the prepared spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridines ] 1a - 1p were fully characterized by spectroscopic methods and were further confirmed by the determination of the single crystal structures of the spiro compounds 1c ( fig. 1 ) and 1h ( fig. 2 ) .

when ethyl cyanoacetate was utilized in the domino reaction under similar conditions , the reaction usually resulted in a complicated mixture of spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridines ] 2 and spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridinones ] 3 depending on whether the cyano group or the ester group was taking part in the cyclization process ( scheme 1 ) .
in order to simplify the separation process , only the main product was separated from the reaction mixtures by column chromatography .
the other product was not separated or structurally characterized .
the results are listed in table 2 .
it is interesting to find that anilines bearing p - chloro , m - chloro or p - bromo groups afforded spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridines ] 2a - 2h as the main products ( table 2 , entries 1 - 8 ) .
due to fact that m - nitroaniline and p - nitroaniline could not react with methyl propiolate to give the desired intermediate beta - enamino ester , they were not utilized in this reaction .
on the other hand p - methoxyaniline , p - methylaniline and aniline itself gave spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridinones ] 3a - 3j as the main products ( table 2 , entries 9 - 18 ) .
thus , it seems that anilines with electron - withdrawing groups preferably give spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridines ] 2 , while anilines with electron - donating groups preferably produce spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridinones ] 3 .

the structures of the prepared spiro compounds 2a - 2h and 3a - 3n were fully established by spectroscopic methods .
the single - crystal structures of spiro compounds 2b ( fig. 3 ) and 3b ( fig. 4 ) were successfully determined by x - ray diffraction methods .
it should be pointed out that the 1h nmr spectra of compounds 2a - 2h showed some distinguishing features .
the characteristic resonance of the nh2 group usually displays one broad peak at about 7.40 ppm , which is overlapped with the peaks of aromatic protons .
comparing with the one singlet at 5.80 ppm of the nh2 group in compounds 1a - 1p , the peak of the nh2 group in compounds 2a - 2h is shifted to a much lower field .
secondly , the characteristic peaks of the ch2 unit of the ethoxy group in most spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridines ] 2a - 2h split into two mixed peaks at about 3.75 - 3.72 ( m , 1h ) , 3.37 - 3.34 ( m , 1h ) , which indicated that these two protons existed in different circumstance .
the ch3 unit of the ethoxy goup showed a normal peak .
figure 3 molecular structure of spiro compound 2b .
figure 4 molecular structure of spiro compound 3b. from the molecular structure of the spiro compound 3b shown in fig. 4 , we could clearly see that the cyano group and the phenyl group of oxindole moiety in the newly formed dihydropyridinone ring exist in cis - configuration .
1h nmr spectra of 3a - 3n all display one singlet at about 5.40 ppm for the one proton in the dihydropyridinone ring , which indicated that only one isomer exists in each product .
based on the single crystal structure and 1h nmr data we could tentatively conclude that the spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridinones ] 3a - 3n have cis - configuration of the cyano group and the phenyl group of the oxindole moiety .
to explain the mechanism of this domino reaction , a plausible reaction course was proposed to account for the different products based on the published reactions containing methyl propiolate [ 20 - 22 ] , which are illustrated in scheme 1 .
the first reaction is the formation of the key intermediate beta - enamino ester a from the addition of arylamine to methyl propiolate .
the second reaction is a knoevenagel condensation of isatin with malononitrile or ethyl cyanoacetate under the catalysis of triethylamine to give the isatylidene deriatives b. the third reaction is a michael addition of beta - enamino ester intermediate a with isatinylidene derivative b to yield intermediate c. in the case of the reaction containing malononitrile , the nucleophilic addition of the amino group to the c - n triple bond in intermediate c resulted in spiro compound 1 with the tautomerization of the imino group to an amino group .
in the case of the reaction containing ethyl cyanoacetate , the amino group could react with both the cyano group and the ester group in the adduct c. the nucleophilic addition of the amino group to the c - n triple bond finally afforded spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridines ] 2 .
on the other hand the amino group attacked the ester group to give spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridinones ] 3 with the elimination of ethanol .
in this reaction process , the reasons that anilines with electron - withdrawing groups preferably attack the cyano group and anilines with electron - donating groups preferably attack the ester group are not very clear .
scheme 1 the proposed mechanism for the domino reaction .
conclusion in summary , we have successfully developed a one - pot four - component reaction of arylamines , methyl propiolate , isatin and malononitrile or ethyl cyanoacetate with triethylamine as base catalyst .
this reaction can proceed smoothly under mild conditions to afford the functionalized spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridines ] and spiro [ indoline - 3,4 ' - pyridinones ] in moderate to good yields .

a novel quantitative 1h nmr ( q - nmr ) combined with hplc - ms method has been proposed for investigating the degradation process of traditional chinese medicine ( tcm ) components. through this method , in - situ monitoring of dynamics degradation process of lithospermic acid ( la ) , one of the popular polyphenolic acids in tcm , was realized under low oxygen condition .
additionally , this methodology was proved to be simple , rapid and specific .
degradation kinetic runs have been carried out to systematically investigate the effects of two key environmental factors , initial ph values and temperatures .
eight main degradation products of la were detected , seven of which were tentatively structural elucidated with the help of both nmr and lc - ms in this work and salvianolic acid a ( sal a ) was the primary degradation product of la. a possible degradation pathway of la was proposed , subsequently .
the results showed that the degradation of la followed pseudo - first - order kinetics .
the apparent degradation kinetic constants increased as the initial ph value of the phosphate buffer increased .
under the given conditions , the rate constants of overall degradation as a function of temperature obeyed the arrhenius equation .

introduction the chemical complexity and vagueness of effective compounds are major impediments to the development of traditional chinese medicine ( tcm ) into modern medicine in comply with pharmaceutical standards accepted worldwide .
multi - components and multi - species of many tcms are accountable for most of these challenges , additionally , the deficiencies in modern standardization and quality control methods for tcm are also important contributing factors [ 1 ] .
in most cases , the tcm production process consists of the following indispensable units : extraction , concentration , purification , drying and preparation .
heating and acid / alkali adjustment are commonly used in extraction step , which may cause chemical reactions such as degradation of active components , this will directly affect the quality of tcm [ 2 ] , thus its clinical safety and efficacy cannot be guaranteed .
therefore , the study on degradation process of active components in tcm is vital for improving quality control and quality consistency of tcm during manufacture and resulted pharmaceutical product .
mechanism and kinetics are two major questions to be addressed in a degradation study .
as one of the most powerful analytical tools in study of degradation mechanism , hplc - ms is known for rapid compound identification with the help of widely used chemical databases [ 3 - 5 ] .
in order to perform kinetic modeling in degradation study , both reactant and degradation products should be quantitatively analyzed and hplc - uv is the dominant technique used [ 6 - 8 ] .
despite of all the superb characteristics of hplc methods , the requirement of reference compounds is a limitation of its application in quantitative analysis .
without reference compounds , chromatographic results are reported on area percent rather than weight percent , which are not accurate enough for certain studies .
meanwhile , the preparation of reference compounds for degradation products is often time consuming and sometimes impossible when these compounds are unstable .
furthermore , these analytes may undergo chemical conversions when exposed to air during sample preparation in hplc analysis .
spectroscopic coupled with multivariate curve resolution ( mcr ) methods had also been applied in degradation studies [ 9 , 10 ] .
nevertheless , spectra and concentration matrix of degradation products resolved from mcr often belonged to mixture of compounds rather than a single compound .
furthermore , if the reactant and degradation products show similar spectroscopic property , these methods would fail to resolve .
another frequently overlooked question is that most researchers ignored the effect of oxygen on degradation process .
their reaction system is always exposed to the air , while the operation environment in real industrial manufacturing process of tcm is under low oxygen condition since it is relatively sealed .
therefore , the kinetic results obtained from their laboratory studies offered little instructive information to real industrial manufacturing and quality control of corresponding tcm .
as a consequence , there is an urgent need in developing simple , rapid and in - situ research techniques for the study of degradation process of active components in tcm .
one of the major advantages of quantitative nmr ( q - nmr ) spectroscopy is its primary analytical characteristics [ 11 ] .
it is in - situ , avoiding analytes conversions during sample preparation in hplc analysis .
nmr tube is deep in length and has quite small cross - sectional area , so it can be treated as a small reactor with less contact to air .
meanwhile , nmr is structurally rich and non - intrusive , which makes the technique extremely useful to identify and characterize reaction products , gain insights into the reaction mechanisms and determine reaction kinetics .
several studies have reported on reaction monitoring using nmr spectroscopy [ 12 - 16 ] .
in recent years , q - nmr combined with chemometrics methods have been successfully applied in analysis of herbs and herbal preparations [ 17 - 19 ] .
we have previously established a q - nmr method for hydrolytic kinetic investigation of salvianolic acid b ( sal b ) [ 20 ] .
q - nmr methods have been demonstrated to be simple , rapid , efficient and reliable .
in this work , q - nmr combined with hplc - ms method was proposed to investigate the degradation process of lithospermic acid ( la , fig 1 ) as an example .
la is one of the popular polyphenolic acids existed in several medicinal plants , such as tournefortia sarmentosa lam .
[ 21 ] , salvia miltiorrhiza bge .
( danshen ) and origanum vulgare l .
[ 22 ] .
it is considered to be the major active constituent of t. sarmentosa , with its content being about 0.6 % w / w in the dried herb [ 21 ] .
la possesses the effects of anti - oxidation , anti - inflammation [ 23 ] , anti - lipid - peroxidative [ 21 ] and anti - neuro - inflammationm [ 24 ] .
several researchers have illustrated that salvianolic acid a ( sal a ) is degradation product of la [ 25 , 26 ] .
in recent years , there is a growing interests in sal a due to its potent bioactivities .
it is reported to show highest antioxidant activity among the salvianolic acids in danshen [ 27 ] , and possess protective effects in cardiac diseases [ 28 , 29 ] .
the content of sal a in danshen is very low .
several methods have been reported to prepare sal a through the degradation of sal b [ 30 - 34 ] .
wang et al .
[ 25 ] found out that compared to sal b , la could more easily convert to sal a and generate fewer other products under the same conditions .
up to now , none reports have been found on the degradation kinetics of la , not to mention the kinetics of la transform to sal a. a possible reason was that sal a was not stable in aqueous solutions and could be easily oxidized [ 4 ] .

the calibration curve was made using seven standard solutions of different concentrations ( 5.00 , 4.00 , 3.00 , 2.00 , 1.00 , 0.500 , 0.100 mg / ml ) .
the standard solutions were prepared by diluting an appropriate volume of stock solution with the phosphate buffer and d2o ( containing tsp as the internal standard for chemical shift calibration and quantitative analysis ) was added to volume percentage of 10 % for each sample .
each solution was analyzed twice .
the peak area values were plotted against the corresponding analyte concentrations to obtain the linear calibration .

assuming all these reactions follow irreversible first - order reaction kinetics , ordinary differential equation of sal a was obtained as follows : dc2dt = kr2.c1 - kr3.c2 ( 4 ) where c2 is the concentration of sal a , kr2 is the rate constant of la transform to sal a , kr3 is the rate constant of sal a transform to other compounds .
because the initial concentration of sal a was 0 , eq ( 5 ) can be derived from eqs ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) : c2tc10 = kr2kr1 - kr3. ( e - kr3.t - e - kr1.t ) ( 5 ) the influence of temperature on reaction rate constant was given by arrhenius equation : ln kr = ln a - eart ( 6 ) where a represents frequency factor , ea stands for activation energy , r is ideal gas constant ( 8.314 j / mol.k ) and t is temperature ( k ) .
all data fitting were carried out using originlab ( pro 8 , originlab corp. , northampton , ma ) .
results and discussion identification of degradation products hplc chromatograms ( 280 nm ) of degraded sample heated 12 h in exp. no. ii , iv and v ( for experimental condition details see table 2 ) were shown in fig 4 .
a tentative assignment of the degradation products was made on basis of quasi - molecular ion [ m - h ] - and fragment ions obtained from lc - - msn experiments .

the ms of peak 3 showed [ m - h ] - at 493 and [ 2m - h ] - at 987 , it was identified as sal a. the ms of peak 5 showed [ m - h ] - at 491 and [ 2m - h ] - at 983 , it was identified as sal c. in addition , these compounds had been further determined by comparison of retention times with those of reference compounds .
ms quasi - molecular ion of peak 4 was the same as peak 5 , according to the results in previous work [ 4 ] , peak 4 was identified as iso - salvianolic acid c ( iso - sal c ) .
the ms of peak 6 showed [ m - h ] - ion at 357 , according to the results in kan et al. ' s [ 31 ] and guo et al. ' s [ 6 ] studies , peak 6 was identified as prolithospermic acid .
peak 7 , 8 and 9 were three degradation products easily generated at higher initial ph values .
they all had the same [ m - h ] - at m / z 537 , which suggested that they were isomers ( m.w. 538 ) .
the ms / ms and ms3 spectra were also similar .
they first lost 44u ( co2 ) from the [ m - h ] - ion to form the abundant [ m - h - co2 ] - ion at m / z 493 , and then lost 198u ( danshensu ) to yield m / z 295 , respectively .
compared to retention times with those of reference compounds , peak 8 and 9 were identified to sal u and sal t , which was in consistence with the results of li et al. ' s work [ 35 ] .
ms information could not support the structure elucidation of peak 7 and it was assigned as isomer of la. sal u and sal t were detected as degradation products of la for the first time in this work .
sal a was primary degradation product of la in our experiments .
nevertheless , constitutes of degradation products changed at different experimental conditions .
areas of peak 7 - 9 increased as the initial ph value of phosphate solution increased .
in production of corresponding tcm preparations , process parameters could be adjusted according to production targets .
if sal a is the production targets , solution ph values should be reduced and the reaction system should be kept under low oxygen condition .
proposed degradation mechanism after the identification of the various la degradation products , a possible pathway of la degradation in water was proposed , as shown in fig 5 .
la could easily degrade to sal a through ring opening of benzofuran and decarboxylation .
sal a could further be oxidized to sal c and its isomers , it was in accordance with previous study [ 4 ] .
as nmr tube was not sealed , small amount of oxygen might exist in nmr tube , thus , a small part of sal a was oxidized to sal c and its isomers .
alternatively , la could undergo the furan ring - opened to form sal u and sal t as the initial of ph of phosphate solution increased .
la could also undergo ester bond hydrolysis to produce danshensu and prolithospermic acid .
some degradation pathways of la had been reported by other researchers [ 25 , 31 , 32 ] , including decarboxylation and the hydrolysis of the ester bond .
while the pathway of ring - open of benzofuran in the parent compound la to generate sal t / u was detected for the first time in this work .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0164421.g005 fig 5 proposed degradation pathway for la. determination of la and sal a using q - nmr typical 1h nmr spectra of la ( a ) and the degraded samples ( b ) were shown in fig 6 .
quantitative peaks were selected through comparing 1h nmr spectra of standard compounds with those of degraded samples .
two pairs of peaks could be used for quantification of la ( 1 - 1 , 1 - 2 ) and sal a ( 3 - 1 , 3 - 2 ) .
chemical shift of quantitative peaks upfielded slightly along with the degradation went on. assignment of quantitative peaks also referred to zhou et al. ' s [ 26 ] and xiao et al. ' s works [ 36 ] .
for ascertaining specificity of the quantitative peaks , 2d nmr ( cosy and hsqc ) were adopted , supporting the assignment of peaks used for the quantification .
la and sal a could be quantified using the established q - nmr method .

method validation the linearity of the q - nmr method was proved using linear correlation of the peak area values and seven standard solutions of la in the concentration range of 0.100 - 5.00 mg / ml ( r2 = 0.9997 or 0.9994 for peak 1 - 1 and 1 - 2 ) .
as quantitative nmr is a primary ratio method , linearity is of little significance for assessing the specific detector response factor for different analytes .
the experiment was mainly aimed at checking the system stability for the quantitative analysis .
the rsd value of intraday precision was less 1 % for la , indicating good repeatability of the q - nmr method .
degradation kinetics of la a linear relationship between natural logarithmic remaining percent of la and degradation time was found as shown in fig 7 .
the observed first - order rate constant , kr1 , was determined and the results were shown in table 2 .
all the determination coefficients are higher than 0.99 , which means that satisfactory fitting was obtained .
degradation constant kr1 increased as initial ph value or temperature increased .

no.iii ; ( o ) exp. no. iv ; (^) exp. no. v. the degradation rate constants at different initial ph values were shown in table 2 ( exp. no. ii , iv and v ) .
initial ph value also showed influences on the degradation rate of la. la tended to generate more degradation products as the initial of ph value of phosphate solution increased .
meanwhile stability of sal a deteriorated with the increasing of solution ph value .
these might be the partial factors which caused the variation of degradation rate constants .
the rate constant at various temperatures were also shown in table 2 ( exp. 1 , 2 and 3 ) .
natural logarithmic remaining percent of la versus degradation time were shown in fig 7 ( exp. 1 , 2 and 3 ) .
the data obtained was fitted with eq ( 6 ) and the results were shown in table 3 .
the activation energy and the frequency could be further applied to predict the theoretical half - life of la solution by assuming a similar mechanism .
half - life of la at 25degreesc was predicted to be 2742 days in a phosphate buffer solution ( ph 4.75 ) .
the prediction rate constant at 25degreesc was also shown in table 3 .

the proposed method allowed in - situ monitoring of kinetic samples in low oxygen conditions , which was critical for the stability of easily oxidized tcm components , such as sal a. this nmr method is simple , rapid , specific and no specific reference standards are needed for quantification of target compounds .
therefore this method can be used to investigate tcm systems containing components that are unstable or difficult to prepare .
eight main degradation products of la were detected , seven of which were characterized by lc - ms and compared with available reference compounds .
these degradation products are proposed to form main pathway of la , including decarboxylation , ring - open of benzofuran and the hydrolysis of the ester bond in the parent compound .
kinetic parameters for both la and sal a degradation were fitted .
the degradation of la obeyed a pseudo - first - order kinetics .
degradation rate constants increased with increasing of initial ph value or temperatures .
rate constants kr1 and kr2 obeyed arrhenius equation .
the kinetics studies also indicated that sal a was the primary degradation product of la , which was in accordance with the results of wang et al. ' s work [ 25 ] .
q - nmr combined with hplc - ms method will be one of the most promising techniques for investigating degradation process of active components in tcm .

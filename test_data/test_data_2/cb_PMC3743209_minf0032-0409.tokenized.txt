serotonin transporter ( sert ) dopamine transporter ( dat ) substrate selectivity fenfluramine docking common scaffold clustering the structurally similar serotonin and dopamine transporter ( resp .
sert and dat ) play an important role in neuronal transmission .
although the concept of their function , i.e. the re - uptake of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft , has been extensively studied,1 - 4 the exact mechanism for their substrate selectivity is still unknown .
phenylethylamines ( peas ) are ligands of sert and dat and many induce reverse transport ( efflux ) of the protein 's natural substrate ( the neurotransmitters 5 - hydroxytryptamine and dopamine ) in varying degrees and with different kinetics.2,5 - 7 thus , studying the interplay of bioactivity values and certain structural features of selected peas can lead to new insights about monoamine transporter selectivity .
the broadest sar data currently available for peas and their interaction with sert and dat has been measured in rat synaptosomes by baumann and colleagues.8,9 thus , we used this data set to figure out important features which contribute towards selectivity and to guide the selection of a probe compound for subsequent structure - based studies .
consequently , pec50 values of 28 compounds for sert and dat ( table 1 ) were plotted against each other , providing a clear picture of the pea 's selectivity profile ( figure 1 ) .
out of this , a couple of detailed sars can be drawn : chirality of the alpha - methylene atom of amphetamines does not influence sert / dat selectivity .
the ( s ) - enantiomer is the most active in both transporters .
dat selective substrates seem smaller in size and therefore , their conformational flexibility in the binding pocket is expected to be relatively high and interactions with the target less defined .
n - methyl substitution slightly increases activity in sert ( compare compounds 4 , 8 , 20 and 21 ) , and is somewhat unchanged in dat ( compare compounds 16 , 17 , 18 and 19 ) .
the only exception is for the naphtylisopropylamine ( nipa , 23 ) which is not selective for both transporters and shows a slight decrease in sert activity ( 24 ) .
n - ethyl substitution is generally more favorable in sert as compared to methyl substitution or no substitution , while it decreases activity in dat ( see compounds 19 , 22 and 25 ) .
para - chlorine , meta - cf3 or meta - methyl substitution dramatically increases sert affinity ( compare 9 , 11 , 12 , 4 , 17 ) .
beta - hydroxyl substitution ( r4 , table 1 ) decreases affinity in both sert and dat ( compare 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 ) .
para - methyl substitution increases sert affinity and slightly decreases dat affinity ( compare 4 , 10 , 26 , 27 ) .

compounds with similar sert / dat affinity are located around the middle diagonal line , while compounds in the upper left corner and lower right corner are dat and sert - selective , respectively .
the highest sert / dat selectivity is shown by ( s ) - fenfluramine ( sff ) and because of its relatively large size , docking studies with this ligand are expected to result in a more restricted amount of poses as compared to the smaller analogs .
subsequently , we used sff as a probe compound in order to study the molecular basis of the high affinity and selectivity of this compound towards sert by means of a structure - based approach .
conveniently , sequence identity between the human and rat transporters is very high ( 92 % with sert ; 93 % with dat ) , and local alignment of the primary substrate binding site ( s14 ) shows even 100 % sequence identity between both species.10 thus , in order to build upon our already established protein homology models for human sert11 , we switched to human proteins for subsequent studies .
to show that data derived from rat transporters indeed can be transferred to the human transporters , we confirmed the high selectivity of sff for sert employing an uptake inhibition assay on hek cells expressing human sert and dat ( ic50 = 5.89 microm in sert and 118 microm in dat , see figure 2 ) .
figure 2 uptake inhibition by ( s ) - fenfluramine in hek293 cells stably expressing yfp - tagged dat and sert .
uptake was inhibited by increasing concentrations of fenfluramine as indicated .
the concentration of tritiated substrates was 0.15 microm in the case of [ 3h ] 5ht while 0.1 microm was used for [ 3h ] da. data are shown as means +/ - sem of three ( dat ) or four ( sert ) independent experiments carried out in triplicate .
docking of a set of diverse high - affinity sert substrates ( see methods ) into a homology model of hsert followed by common scaffold clustering revealed a binding mode for sff which is in accordance to previously published studies.12,13 in addition , sff was docked into an analogously constructed homology model of hdat .
results showed that this ligand fits nicely into the s1 site , meaning that steric hindrance caused by the trifluoromethyl or n - ethyl group could not serve as an explanation for its low dat affinity ( see figure 3 ) .
in addition , scoring functions could not show a preference of sff for sert or dat ( see table 2 ) and hence are not able to capture the activity determining factors .
since sff 's trifluoromethyl moiety seems to be driving the selectivity , we further analysed the pocket between the tm3 and tm8 helical domains where this moiety is located : local alignment of sert and dat showed that five of the seven residues within this pocket are different .
in general , the sert pocket has more lipophilic side chains in its binding site , except for thr439 in sert which is more hydrophilic than the corresponding ala423 in dat ( see table 3 ) .

furthermore , as shown in table 1 , ( s ) - amphetamine and ( s ) - norfenfluramine only have a trifluoromethyl moiety dissimilar , and their ki values for rsert are 3830 nm and 214 nm , respectively.5,8 since the ratio of these values should be similar to the kd ratio ( and since ki is comparable to kd14 ) , the binding free energy formula can be applied : with t = 298.15 k5 and hence , from a ligand - based point of view , a more favorable binding energy of about 1.72 kcal / mol is calculated for ( s ) - norfenfluramine .
considering the inhibitory values of ( s ) - fenfluramine from our human dat and sert uptake inhibition assay , we obtain a binding free energy difference of about 1.75 kcal / mol : 15 with t = 293.15 k both calculated energy values are close to each other , strengthening the evidence that the trifluoromethyl group is responsible for sert / dat selectivity and high sert affinity .
moreover , these values are relatively close to the deltag value of a sp3 - fluorine hydrogen bond ( - 2.38 kcal / mol ). 16 it is thus tempting to speculate that an interaction of thr439 with the cf3 group triggers both affinity and selectivity of sff in sert .
in addition , lipophilic dispersion forces with the sert specific side chains ( ala169 , ile172 , ala173 ) that surround the trifluoromethyl moiety might contribute .
further evidence for the potential role of the lipophilicity of this pocket can be deduced from the increase in activity of the more lipophilic meta - methyl - substituted compound 9 and a decrease in activity of the hydrophilic meta - hydroxy - substituted dopamine ( 1 ) and norepinephrine ( 3 ) in this protein .
finally , when comparing phentermine and chlorphentermine , the halide increases the sert affinity 13 900 / 338 = 41 times,5 which corresponds to more favorable energy of about 2.21 kcal / mol. whether this can be ascribed to an interaction between the chlorine and thr439 , or simply to lipophilic contributions , is a point of discussion. with this study we have shown that combining ligand - and structure based studies are a powerful tool to probe substrate selectivity of monoamine transporters leading to preliminary evidence for the potential role of halogen atoms and thr439 in sert .
synthesis of additional peas combined with biochemical studies in both wild type and t439a mutants are obvious further steps towards this direction .
experimental materials and methods .
dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) and trypsin were purchased from paa laboratories gmbh ( pasching , austria ) .
fetal calf serum was purchased from invitrogen .
[ 3h ] 5ht ([ 3h ] 5 - hydroxytryptamine ; serotonin ; 28.3ci / mmol ) and [ 3h ] da ( dopamine ; 35 ci / mmol ) were purchased from perkinelmer , boston , ma , usa .
serotonin ( 5ht ) , dopamine ( da ) and sff were purchased from sigma .
uptake inhibition assays .
the generation of hek293 cell lines expressing yellow fluorescent protein ( yfp ) - tagged hsert and hdat is described earlier ( sucic et al. 15 ) .
hek293 cells stably expressing either sert or dat were seeded onto poly - d - lysine - coated 48 - well plates ( 0.5x105 cells / well ) , 24 hours prior to the experiment .
for inhibition experiments , the specific activity of the tritiated substrate was kept constant : [ 3h ] da : 0.1 microm , [ 3h ] 5ht : 0.15 microm .
assay conditions were as outlined ; 15 in brief : the cells were washed thrice with krebs - ringer - hepes buffer ( khb ; composition : 25 mm hepes.naoh , ph 7.4 , 120 mm nacl , 5 mm kcl , 1.2 mm cacl2 , and 1.2 mm mgso4 supplemented with 5 mm d - glucose ) .
then , the diluted reference and sample compounds were added and incubated for 5 minutes to allow for equilibration with the transporters .
subsequently , the tritiated substrates were added and the reaction was stopped after 5 minutes .
cells were lysed with sds 1 % and counted in a beta - counter ( packard instruments ) .
all determinations have been performed in triplicate .
homology modeling .
models of the human sert and dat were created as described by sarker et al.11 using leutaa in the occluded conformation ( pdb id 2a65 , 1.65 a ) 17 as template .
the highest dope scored structure was energy minimized in the amber99 forcefield and underwent a quality check using the qmean server .
the binding site was defined using the site finder tool of molecular operating environment. docking .
nine structurally diverse peas with high sert affinity ( 10 , 12 , 19 , 21 , 22 , 25 , 27 , 28 , 29 ) were docked into the s1 of sert using ccdc gold 5.0.1 .
in case of an amphetamine , only the ( s ) enantiomer was docked .
sff was docked into the dat s1 alone because its low affinity could cause a distinct conformation in the binding site .
one hundred poses per ligand were generated and the ligand and residue 's side chains within a 6a radius were set as freely flexible ( 10 degree bins ) .
poses not comprising a required ionic interaction with the d79 ( dat ) and d98 ( sert ) side chain18 were discarded , leading to 45 sff - sert and 65 sff - dat complexes .
the ligand and surrounding atoms within a 8 a radius were energy minimized in the merck molecular forcefield ( mmff94x ) .
common scaffold clustering was applied on the sert complexes , whereby the pea scaffold was extracted from each complex and an rmsd matrix based on its heavy atoms was calculated.19 agglomerative hierarchical clustering , using xlstat ( complete linkage , cutoff level 3 ) , led to 13 clusters .
those clusters not containing all ligands were discarded , leading to 7 clusters comprising 41 sff poses. from the top 10 scored poses of x - score20 and dsx scoring function,21 one consensus pose was found and from the 14 complexes of the cluster containing this pose , the average rescoring values were calculated .
for the dat poses , 11 clusters were obtained of which two had a similar ligand orientation ( the aromatic ring in the same position ) as in the consensus sert pose. from these two clusters ( 9 poses ) , the average scores were calculated ( table 2 ) .

background japanese encephalitis ( je ) caused by japanese encephalitis virus ( jev ) accounts for acute illness and death .
however , few studies have been conducted to unveil the potential pathogenesis mechanism of jev .
dendritic cells ( dcs ) are the most prominent antigen - presenting cells ( apcs ) which induce dual humoral and cellular responses .
thus , the investigation of the interaction between jev and dcs may be helpful for resolving the mechanism of viral escape from immune surveillance and je pathogenesis .
results we examined the alterations of phenotype and function of dcs including bone marrow - derived dcs ( bmdcs ) in vitro and spleen - derived dcs ( spdcs ) in vivo due to jev p3 wild strain infection .
our results showed that jev p3 infected dcs in vitro and in vivo .
the viral infection inhibited the expression of cell maturation surface markers ( cd40 , cd80 and cd83 ) and mhci , and impaired the ability of p3 - infected dcs for activating allogeneic naive t cells .
in addition , p3 infection suppressed the expression of interferon ( ifn ) - alpha and tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) - alpha but enhanced the production of chemokine ( c - c motif ) ligand 2 ( ccl2 ) and interleukin ( il ) - 10 of dcs .
the infected dcs expanded the population of cd4 + foxp3 + regulatory t cell ( treg ) .
conclusion jev p3 infection of dcs impaired cell maturation and t cell activation , modulated cytokine productions and expanded regulatory t cells , suggesting a possible mechanism of je development .
background jev is a causative agent of je which causes at least 50,000 clinical cases and about 10,000 deaths each year .
it is a member of the mosquito - borne encephalitis complex of the flaviviridae family and has recently been discovered in previously non - affected areas like australia [ 1 ] and pakistan [ 2 ] .
the neurons in the central nervous system ( cns ) are target cells of jev .
studies show that a direct viral cytopathic response and both direct and indirect immunological responses can contribute to cns degeneration through jev - infected cell exclusion by macrophages and ctls , secretion of cytokines and chemokines and activation of microglia [ 3 - 6 ] .
however , few studies have investigated the mechanisms by which jev evades the immune surveillance of the host and passes through the blood - brain barrier ( bbb ) to the cns .
dendritic cells ( dcs ) are the most prominent antigen - presenting cells ( apcs ) which induce dual humoral and cellular responses .
while dcs also play unique role in inducing immune tolerance , avoiding immune surveillance and causing persistent infection .
there are studies about the interaction between virus and dcs which showed that viral infection of dcs inhibited the cell maturation and impaired the cell function [ 7 - 9 ] .
human cytomegalovirus ( hcmv ) infection de - regulated the expression of surface mhc classi , cd40 , cd80 and cd86 molecules on dcs .
furthermore , both t cell proliferation and cytotoxicity of t cells specific to an antigen presented by dcs were reduced via the release of soluble cd83 when dcs were infected with hcmv [ 8,10,11 ] .
likewise , human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) affected maturation of dcs within the thymus , which contributed to the loss of the naive t cell and memory t cell population and even facilitated the dissemination of hiv [ 12 ] .
additionally , recent studies revealed that several viruses belonging to the flaviviridae family , such as classical swine fever virus ( csfv ) , dengue virus ( dv ) and yellow fever virus ( yfv ) , infected dcs and altered the cell phenotype and function [ 13 - 15 ] .
furthermore , aleyas et al .
[ 2009 ] recently reported that jev beijing strain replicated both in bmdcs and macrophages , and induced functional impairment of dcs through myd88 - dependent and independent pathways which subsequently led to poor cd4 + and cd8 + t cell responses [ 16 ] .
thus , the investigation of the interaction between virus and dcs is imperative for resolving the viral escape from immune surveillance and je pathogenesis .
since there is no evidence for jev infection of dcs in vivo , we investigated the alteration of phenotype and function of the jev p3 - infected dcs both in vitro and in vivo .
our results indicated that jev p3 severely infected dcs in vitro and in vivo , and the infection with jev impaired cell maturation and the capacity for t cell activation .
in addition , our study also showed that the infection of dcs with p3 expanded the population of cd4 + foxp3 + regulatory t cell ( treg ) with immunosuppressive potential , suggesting that the virus - induced alteration of dcs is a likely cause of the immunosuppression found in jev infection .
results jev p3 infection of dcs in vitro and in vivo the purity of the bmdcs fraction from cell culture or infected mouse splenocytes was higher than 90 % as determined by facs analysis with surface molecules expression ( cd11c ) .
after jev infection , a 467 - bp specific rna fragment of jev was detected by rt - pcr ( figure 1a ) and the e protein of the jev was detected by western blotting in dcs ( figure 1b ) .
facs results showed over 80 % bmdcs and 90 % spdcs were infected by jev p3 ( figure 1c ) .
analysis by real - time pcr showed that dcs supported jev replication and yielded infectious virus ( figure 1d ) .
these results suggest that jev infected dcs both in vitro and in vivo .
figure 1 p3 infects dcs in vitro and in vivo .
( a ) the in vitro infected bmdcs and the spdcs from p3 - challenged mice were harvested and analyzed with rt - pcr .
bands shown are 467 - bp pcr products specific for jev .
( b ) the bmdcs and spdcs were analyzed for e protein ( jev envelope protein ) by separation of the proteins on a 10 % sds - page gel followed by electrotransfer to nc membranes and incubation with monoclonal antibodies against e protein .
( c ) the bmdcs were harvested after 3 days infection and the spdcs were isolated from mice which had been challenged for 5 days .
1 x 105 bmdcs or spdcs were doubly stained with fitc - anti - e and pe - anti - cd11c and analyzed by facs respectively .
( d ) the infected bmdcs and the spdcs from challenged mice were collected 3 times at day 1 , 3 and 5 , and a real - time pcr was performed to quantitatively detect rna copies of jev .
each point represents the mean +/ - sd determinants in triplicate .
p3 infection suppressed the maturation of dcs dcs present antigen to and activate t lymphocytes through up - regulating the expression of costimulatory and antigen presentation - associtated molecules at the mature stage [ 17 ] .
to examine whether the characteristics of immature dcs were altered by p3 infection , we tested the surface molecules of the infected dcs in vitro and in vivo .
the expression of maturation surface markers , including cd40 , cd80 , cd83 and mhciwas up - regulated in uv - p3 - stimulated , but not in p3 - infected bmdcs and spdcs or mock - treated dcs ( figure 2 ) , indicating that uv - p3 stimulation accelerated the maturity of dcs whereas p3 infection dramatically inhibited the cell maturation process .
figure 2 effects of p3 infection on dcs maturation .
1 x 105 freshly purified bmdcs were left mock - treated or treated with 1 moi of p3 or uv - p3 with or without lps ( lipopolysacchide , sigma - aldrich , mo ) for 3 days .
the spdcs from mice , which have been challenged or immunized for 5 days , were obtained and treated with or without lps .
expressions of cd40 , cd80 , cd83 and mhci of the bmdcs ( a,b ) or spdcs ( c,d ) were evaluated by facs .
relative fluorescence intensity to mock group ( fold induction ) was expressed as the means +/ - sd of triplicates .

p3 infection modulated cytokine production of dcs in many cases , virus does not directly result in the destruction of host organism but instead causes indirect damage through the disordered release of cytokines [ 18 ] .
in addition , imbalanced levels of cytokines may contribute to viral persistence and irreversible immunsuppression .
therefore , we examined the profiles of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines produced by p3 - infected dcs in vitro and in vivo .
our results showed that p3 infection enhanced the releases of il - 10 and ccl2 of dcs but suppressed the production of ifn - alpha and tnf - alpha ( figure 3 ). and it was interesting to show that jev which was inactivated by uv irradiation failed to induce the production of il - 10 and ccl2 but succeeded in inducing the expression of ifn - alpha and tnf - alpha .
this indicates that the release of ccl2 and il - 10 from dcs was dependent on viral replication , while the production of ifn - alpha and tnf - alpha was independent on viral replication .
figure 3 cytokine profiles of p3 - infected dcs ( ifn - alpha , tnf - alpha , ccl2 and il - 10 ) .
1 x 105 freshly purified bmdcs were left mock - treated or treated with 1 moi of p3 or uv - p3 for 3 days .
the spdcs from mice , which were challenged or immunized for 5 days , were obtained and cultured for 3 days .
the cell supernatants harvested at 3 days of post infection were analyzed with elisa to measure the concentrations of cytokines ( ifn - alpha , tnf - alpha , ccl2 and il - 10 ) .
cytokine concentrations were expressed as the means +/ - sd of triplicates .

dcs infected with p3 attenuated allostimulatory activities to t cells to test whether p3 infection will impair the ability of dcs to activate allogeneic naive t cells , the direct effect of p3 - infected dcs in activation of naive t cells was analyzed by mixed lymphocyte reaction ( mlr ) and elispot assay .
in mlr , the allo - stimulative capability of dcs was significantly suppressed by p3 infection compared to the uv - p3 - stimulated group ( p < 0.05 ) .
in addition , the viral infection blocked the lps - induced allostimulatory activity of dcs ( figure 4a , b ) .
figure 4 effects of p3 infection on dcs activation of naive t cells by mlr .
mock - treated , p3 - infected or uv - p3 - stimulated dcs as well as differently treated spdcs were added in grade dose to 1 x 105 allogeneic t cells at the indicated stimulator - responder ratios in triplicate , with ( b ) or without ( a ) lps treatment for 20 h before the addition of 50 mul of celltiter 96 ( r ) aqueous one solution cell proliferation assay .
the bmdcs , spdcs as well as t cells were served as spontaneous nadh / nadph releases controls respectively .
the presentation activities of differently treated bmdcs were measured as 100 % ( od490dc + t exp .

results were expressed as the means +/ - sd of triplicates .

in elispot assay detecting ifn - gamma producing t cells , the number of spot forming units / 106 purified t cells was counted after twenty four hour incubation with differently treated bmdcs or spdcs .
the results in vitro showed that p3 - infected bmdcs activated 25 +/ - 9 spots / 106 , while the uv - p3 - stimulated bmdcs activated 68 +/ - 21 naive t cells / 106 .
in vivo , p3 - infected spdcs produced 52 +/ - 12 spots / 106 whereas uv - p3 - stimulated spdcs produced 107 +/ - 34 spots / 106 .
this was consistent with the result of mlr assay .
p3 infection , in vivo or in vitro , significantly suppressed the ability of dcs to activate allogeneic naive t cells in response to lps treatment ( figure 5a , b and 5c ) .
it implied that p3 infection played an important role in the dysfunction of dcs in activating allogeneic t cells .
figure 5 ifn - gamma producing t cells were detected by elispot assay .
p3 - infected , uv - p3 - stimulated or mock - treated dcs as well as differently treated spdcs were harvested and treated with mitomycin c ( sigma - aldrich , mo ) at final concentration of 10 mug / ml for 1 h. the differently treated or mock dcs were seeded ( 1 x 104 per well ) together with 1 x 105 per well t cells in triplicates for 20 h. lps - stimulated dc / t cell co - cultures served as positive controls .
one representative for ifn - gamma spot forming unit ( sfu ) by elispot assay was shown ( a ) .
the figure was representative of three independent experiments .
corrected data ( sfu )/ well were shown for bmdcs and spdcs activations for naive t cells to expand and produce ifn - gamma by elispot assay ( b , in vitro ; c , in vivo ) .
results were expressed as the means +/ - sd of triplicates .

p3 - infected dcs expanded treg the immune response may be limited in magnitude and efficacy when the host with normal treg function is infected with virus .
we examined whether p3 - infected dcs would modulate treg differentiation .
the test revealed that p3 - infected bmdcs significantly enhanced the differentiation of foxp3 + treg in vitro which was consistent with the results in vivo ( figure 6a , b and 6c ) .
however , the uv - p3 - stimulated dcs did not alter the expansion of the treg , as well as the mock - treated dcs .
figure 6 effects of p3 infection on dcs - induced differentiation of regulatory t cells .
1 x 105 mock - , p3 - , uv - p3 - or lps - treated bmdcs were incubated with 1 x 106 allogeneic naive t cells for 5 days .
t cells were purified and doubly labeled for cd4 and foxp3 , and assessed by facs .
the in vivo treg in splenocytes were purified and examined by facs from mice inoculated with 1 x 105 pfu p3 or identical uv - p3 i.p. for 5 days .
representative result was shown from three independent experiments ( a ) .

discussion most studies conducted to evaluate the pathogenesis of jev infection have noted the interaction of the virus with macrophages , microglia and astrocytes , which are major contributors to the production of inflammatory cytokines and cns degeneration [ 3,4,6 ] .
in the present study , we attempted to address the possible pathogenesis of jev wild strain infection by testing the interaction of jev and dcs in vivo and in vitro .
carrasco et al. , [ 2004 ] discovered that csfv could infect and replicate in monocyte and myeloid - derived dcs [ 14 ] .
therefore , we hypothesized that jev , which also belongs to the flaviviridae family , may affect dcs to facilitate viral spread by escaping immune surveillance .
although aleyas et al .
[ 2009 ] recently reported jev infection of dcs in vitro , whether jev infects dcs in vivo remained unknown until now .
our research not only verified the results of aleyas [ 16 ] , but also investigated the jev infection of dcs in vivo .
additionally , one of our preliminary experiments showed that when balb / c mice were inoculated with c6fek4n6 - labeled p3 - infected bmdcs or spdcs via intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) , jev and c6fek4n6 - labeled dcs were detected simultaneouly in the brain of mice with severe symptoms of immunohistochemistry ( unpublished data ) .
it is likely that jev could use dcs as a virus delivery vehicle as it moves through the cns .
the impaired surface molecule expression of apcs may directly affect the process of antigen presentation and t cell activation .
thus , we analyzed the alteration of the surface - molecule expression of infected dcs in vitro and in vivo .
the facs analyses revealed an suppressed expression of surface molecules , such as cd40 , cd80 , cd83 and mhci , on p3 - infected dcs in vitro and in vivo , which is in accordance with aleyas 's results [ 16 ] .
while we also discovered that the antigen presenting - associated molecules on bmdcs were significantly enhanced after jev sa14 - 14 - 2 strain ( a successful jev live vaccine strain ) infection [ 19 ] .
this suggests the potential molecular mechanism of the immune escape of p3 and the high immunopotency of sa14 - 14 - 2 .
since we have verified that jev infection impaired the expression of antigen presenting - molecules and co - stimulator molecules , whether this impairment of the crucial components on dcs would affect their capacity to activate cd4 + and cd8 + t cell directly is needed to be investigated [ 20,21 ] .
thus , we analyzed the capacity of the infected dcs for activating allogeneic t cells by mlr and elispot assay .
it was observed that the t cell activating ability of was dramatically impaired by p3 - infection , but boosted by uv - p3 stimulation and sa14 - 14 - 2 infection .
it has been reported that hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) , ebola viruses and hiv escaped immune surveillance during acute or chronic infection because of the defect of apcs function for activating t cell [ 21 - 23 ] .
therefore it suggested that the impairment of activating of allogeneic naive t cells of p3 infected dcs could be involved in the je development .
treg is a subset of cd4 + t - cell with regulatory properties .
previous studies on the role of tregs in viral infections suggest that they suppresses antiviral effector t cell responses or local immune activation at the sites of viral replication [ 24,25 ] , which may subsequently result in viral immune evasion and the establishment of chronic infections [ 26 - 28 ] .
our facs results showed that p3 infection contributed to the differentiation of treg in vivo .
the results also demonstrated the expansion of treg population after the co - culture of p3 - infected dcs and t cells .
it suggested that jev infection of dcs might influence the mode of t - cell differentiation .
thus , we assumed that induction and expansion of treg cells by jev - infected dcs may be associated with immunosuppression in jev infection .
it has previously been shown that immature dcs induced treg cells are able to suppress other t - cell responses [ 29 - 33 ] .
furthermore , it has been demonstrated that the increased production of il - 10 played an important role in treg responses which appeared to contribute to immune dysfunction , accounting for viral persistence and acute tissue damage .
therefore , the up - regulation of il - 10 in p3 - infected dcs may partly contribute to the expansion of treg .
based on these results , we suggest that p3 infection may have led to the expansion of treg cell population in vivo , which could have been involved in the suppression of anti - jev immune responses .
in addition , it is essential to note that although cd25 is expressed on most regulatory t cells , it is not specific since it can also be expressed on activated cd4 + t cells [ 34,35 ] .
foxp3 has been shown to be a better marker for cd4 + cd25 + t regulatory cells .
the key cytokines secreted by dcs , including typeiifn ( ifn - alpha / beta ) , tnf - alpha , il - 10 and ccl2 , restrict the proliferation of invading pathogens and determine the polarization of th1 and th2 [ 36 - 38 ] .
in particular , secretion of type i ifn is a key step in the innate immune response to viral infection and tnf - alpha released by dcs can further recruit dc precursors and sustain the antigen presentation [ 22 ] .
the impaired expression of ifn - alpha and tnf - alpha of dcs following the jev p3 infection when compared with uv - p3 was observed in the present study may contribute to the attenuated generation of antiviral immune response of the host .
however , the report of chang et al. , [ 2005 ] revealed jev infection induced ifn - beta participated in fighting the invading pathogens by using cell types of a549 and sk - n - sh cells through irf - 3 - and nf - kappab - mediated pathway [ 39 ] .
similar results were also obtained in the studies of west nile virus ( wnv ) infection which induced the ifn - alpha production of pdcs and mdcs [ 40 ] , while inhibited the ifn - beta expression of hela cell [ 41 ] .
therefore , we hypothesized that the different cell types from different tissues may present distinct immune response against viral infection .
it is known that different cell types usually exert different functions .
for instance , pdcs , which generate the crucial signal adaptor irf7 , constitutively express ifn - i. on the contrary , the expression of ifn - i is extremely inhibited in those cell types in absence of the receptor tlr7 / tlr9 and irf - 7 [ 42,43 ] .
furthermore , different types of cytokines are usually used to discriminate the patterns of immune responses .
therefore , when only considering the individual cell type , different cell types may present distinct immune responses .
tnf - alpha level in serum and cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) of the fatal case in significantly correlated with prognostic outcome in wild type jev infection [ 44 ] .
therefore , tnf - alpha may play an important role in immunopathogical responses of the infected host .
however , jev infection of dcs reduced the expression of tnf - alpha in the current study .
on one hand , it usually appears of appropriate expression of tnf - alpha from the innate response of the host when external pathogen invading .
on the other hand , the excess tnf - alpha induced cell degeneration could be harmful to the survival of virus itself .
therefore , we speculate that the wild type virus may evolve a mechanism by which to restrict the excess inflammatory factors expression at the beginning of the infection , which may facilitate the persistence of the virus survival .
moreover , p3 infection significantly enhanced the release of ccl2 and il - 10 .
the il - 10 is considered as an anti - inflammatory factor and plays an important role in the differentiation of treg cells [ 31,45,46 ] .
the suppressed tnf - alpha production in p3 - infected dcs may be partially regulated by high - expressed il - 10 .
our results indicated that the release of ccl2 and il - 10 from dcs was positively related to viral infection while the production of ifn - alpha and tnf - alpha was negatively related to viral replication .
we speculate that the temporary presence of some non - structure proteins or dsrna of jev during the viral replication may play an important role in decelerating or accelerating certain signaling pathway .
additionally , most data obtained in our experiments are consistent with aleyas 's results except for decreased production of tnf - alpha .
this contradicted finding about decreased production of tnf - alpha might be due to various factors , such as the dcs purity (> 90 % vs > 75 %) , jev strain ( p3 and beijing ) and moi values .
all together , the increased level of il - 10 and the decreased productions of ifn - alpha and tnf - alpha presented an immune - suppressive profile , indicating the process of the fatal je development .
conclusion our data reveals that jev p3 could infect mouse dcs in vitro and in vivo , and the infection affects the phenotype and function of dcs , including reducing expression of costimulatory molecules , modulating secretion of crucial cytokines , suppressing activation of t cells , and stimulating differentiation of regulatory t cells , which indicates that the functional impairment of viral infected dcs orchestrates the immunosuppression in response to the acute jev infection .
methods reagents , virus and cells the fluorescent antibodies , including cd11c - pe ( n418 ) , cd40 - fitc ( hm40 - 3 ) , cd80 - fitc ( 16 - 10a1 ) , cd83 - fitc ( 34 - 1 - 2s ) and mhci - fitc ( michel - 17 ) , recombinant mouse granulocyte - macrophage colony stimulating factor ( rmgm - csf ) and il - 4 ( rmil - 4 ) were purchased from ebioscience inc .

after 3 days of incubation in a humidified chamber at 37degreesc in 5 % co2 , 50 mul of celltiter 96 ( r ) aqueous one solution cell proliferation assay ( promega , madison , wi , usa ) was added to each well for 30 min at rt , and then 50 mul of stop solution ( 10 % sds ) was added .
the absorbance at 490 nm was recorded by elisa reader ( ad340 ; beckman coulter , fullerton , ca , usa ) .
the activities for activating t cells of differently treated bmdcs were measured as 100 % ( od490dc + t exp .
- od490dc spont .
- od490t spont. )/( od490t spont. ) .
p3 - infected , uv - p3 - stimulated or mock - treated bmdcs or spdcs from differently treated mice were harvested and treated with mitomycin c ( sigma - aldrich , mo ) at final concentration of 10 mug / ml for 1 h and washed twice before assessment with enzyme - linked immunospot assay with mouse ifn - gamma elispot kit ( ebioscience inc. , san diego , ca ) .
pvdf - membrane - bottomed 96 - well plates ( millipore ) were coated with 10 mug / ml of mab on ifn - gamma in carbonate coating buffer .
the treated or mock bmdcs were seeded in triplicates ( 1 x 104 per well ) together with 1 x 105 per well t cells .
lps ( lipopolysacchide , sigma - aldrich , mo ) - stimulated dc / t cell co - cultures were used as controls .
after incubation for 20 h , cells were discarded and the plates were washed in pbs - 0.05 % tween and incubated with biotinylated anti - ifn - gamma mab ( 1:1000 ) .
after washing , plates were incubated with hrp - avidin , washed and incubated with aec solution ( sigma - aldrich , mo ) .
the staining was stopped by rinsing with water and a red spot was counted as single spot forming unit ( sfu ) .
after rewashing , the cytokine - producing cells were visualized with substrate in accordance with the manufacturer 's guidelines and counted with an automated elispot reader ( aid ) .
the spot - forming t cell number was calculated as following : no.dc + t - no.dc. t cell isolation and treg differentiation t cells from splenocytes of balb / c mice were enriched by stemsep ( tm ) mouse t cell enrichment kit ( stemcell , vancouver , bc , canada ) in accordance with the manufacturer 's guidelines .
purified t cells were cultured in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 5 % fbs , 1 x nonessential amino acids , 2 mm l - glutamine , 10 mm hepes , 1 mm sodium pyruvate , 500 nm 2 - me , 100 mug / ml streptomycin and 100 u / ml penicillin .
to assess the impact of jev infection on treg cell differentiation in vivo , 1 x 105 , p3 - infected , uv - p3 - stimulated , lps - or mock - treated bmdcs were added to 1 x 106 allogeneic naive t cells in 12 - well flat - bottom plates ( costar , cambridge , ma ) in triplicate .
after 5 days of co - culture , in vitro treg cells ( cd4 + and foxp3 +) were isolated ( stemcell , vancouver , bc , canada ) and stained with mouse regulatory t cell staining kit ( ebioscience inc. , san diego , ca ) in accordance with the manufacturer 's instructions and analyzed by facs .
the in vivo treg in splenocytes were purified and conducted on facs from mice challenged with 105 pfu p3 or inoculated with identical uv - p3 for 5 days or from mock - treated mice .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using the student 's t - test .

though tuberculosis ( tb ) among pregnant women is not unusual in our country , documented cases of congenital tuberculosis are rare .
diagnosis is often difficult as signs and symptoms in a neonate are non - specific .
maternal history of tuberculosis is often missed , as many of them are asymptomatic .
here we present a neonate who was operated in view of intestinal obstruction which intra operatively showed disseminated abdominal tuberculosis with infected ascites .
congenital tuberculosis lymphadenopathy ascites liver biopsy case report a 21 - day - old male neonate with birth weight of 2.65 kg was brought with complaints of non - passage of stools for 3 days and gradually increasing abdominal distention , fever and vomiting for 2 days .
there was no history of delayed passage of meconium .
antenatal and perinatal period was uneventful .
child was apparently well for the first two weeks of life , but started developing refusal to feed and respiratory distress .
on examination , the baby was lethargic , sick - looking , tachypneic and febrile .
abdominal examination revealed grossly distended abdomen , sluggish bowel sounds , with no guarding or rigidity .
blood investigation showed hb 13.6g , tlc - 5300 / mul , polymorphs - 63 % , platelet count - 69000 / mul .
abdominal radiograph showed dilated bowel loops with no air fluid level or free gas .
considering hirschsprung 's disease as a differential , barium enema was done , which was normal .
the general condition of the neonate did not improve and abdominal distension worsened .
intra - operatively , there was grossly infected ascites and multiple micro - abscesses present in liver and spleen ( fig. 1 ) along with necrotic pus filled mesenteric lymph nodes .
biopsy was taken from liver and mesenteric lymph nodes .
ascitic fluid was sent for culture .
the post - operative course was stormy ; he had refractory shock to which he succumbed in few hours .
biopsy from the liver and lymph nodes received few days later revealed caseous necrosis with granuloma formation .
pus was highly sensitive for acid - fast bacilli mycobacterium tuberculosis .
mother was otherwise asymptomatic ; the detailed history regarding tuberculosis could not be gained , as the parents could not be contacted .

discussion modes of transmission of congenital tb is thought to be acquired in three ways : transplacentally , where primary complex is in liver ; aspiration of infected amniotic fluid during birth , when lungs are primary focus ; and ingestion of infected material , where the primary is in the gut. [ 1 ] beitzke [ 3 ] in 1935 , established a criteria for differentiating congenital tb from postnatally acquired tb , and it included : isolation of m. tuberculosis from the infant , demonstration of the primary complex in the liver , in the absence of primary complex in the liver - a ) evidence of tuberculosis within days after birth .
b ) absence of contact with a case of tuberculosis after birth .
however beitzke criteria were developed from autopsy series and were rigid .
cantwell [ 1 ] revised these criteria in 1994 , and they include : proven tuberculosis lesions in the infant plus one of the following : lesions occurring in the first week of life , a primary hepatic complex , maternal genital tract or placental tuberculosis , exclusion of postnatal transmission by thorough investigation of contacts .
our case meets the cantwell 's criteria as it is a proven case of tuberculosis in a neonate with primary complex in liver.history of tb from mother could n't be elicited as baby presented with abdominal distention and tb was not kept in differentials .
signs and symptoms are usually non - specific and include respiratory distress , fever , and hepatosplenomegaly .
these symptoms are often confused with other condition like sepsis and congenital infection .
our case presented with both respiratory and abdominal signs , though the respiratory distress was attributed to the gross abdominal distention .
hepato - splenomegaly though present in our case was not appreciated in view of abdominal distention .
severity of abdominal signs in our case suggests that the mode of entry was probably through the ingestion of tb infected amniotic fluid during birth process .
thereafter , dissemination occurred through the portal vein and lymphatics thus explaining the multiple liver abscess and gross ascites .
many infants with congenital tb have an abnormal chest radiograph [ 5 ] , our case too had abnormality in the right lung but they were attributed to broncholitic changes and thus tuberculous origin was missed .
congenital tb has a very high mortality rate , and those presenting before 4 weeks have mortality up to 50 %.[ 1 - 4 ] our case too presented within 4 weeks and expired , thus stressing on the need for high index of suspicion , early diagnosis and prompt treatment .

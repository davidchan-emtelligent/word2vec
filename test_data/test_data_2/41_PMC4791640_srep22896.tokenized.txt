in this study , we applied adaptive evolution to enhance h2 productivity .
after over 150 serial transfers onto co medium , cell density , co consumption rate and h2 production rate increased .
the underlying mechanism for those physiological changes could be explained by using multi - omics approaches including genomic , transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses .
a putative transcriptional regulator was newly identified to regulate the expression levels of genes related to co oxidation .
transcriptome analysis revealed significant changes in the transcript levels of genes belonging to the categories of transcription , translation and energy metabolism .
our study presents the first genome - scale methylation pattern of hyperthermophilic archaea .
adaptive evolution led to highly enhanced h2 productivity at high co flow rates using synthesis gas produced from coal gasification .
microorganisms have been metabolically engineered , employing integrated strategies of systems biology , synthetic biology and evolutionary engineering , to enhance their output of valuable products1 .
generally , metabolic engineering via knowledge - based rational design has been used to enhance the output of target products ; however , this approach requires a priori genetic or biochemical information , and the complexity of cellular physiological responses must be considered2 .
in this regard , an evolutionary engineering approach may serve as an alternative for obtaining suitable phenotypes in cases where there is a lack of prior knowledge3456 .
this approach has been applied to many organisms7 , including escherichia coli , myxococcus xanthus , pseudomonas fluorescens , saccharomyces cerevisiae and thermotoga maritima8 .
however , it has never been reported for hyperthermophilic archaea .
biohydrogen has the potential to considerably reduce costs and environmental impact because it can be produced using sunlight , minimal nutrients or organic waste effluents9 .
microbial h2 production by dark fermentation can produce h2 at a faster rate than photosynthesis and can upcycle renewable , cheap and abundant resources10. t. onnurineus na1 is a carboxydotrophic hydrogenogen , capable of utilizing co and producing h2 in the following reaction : co + h2o - - > h2 + co2 ( deltagdegrees' = - 20 kj / mol ) 11 .
co - driven h2 production is mediated by an enzymatic system encoded in the codh gene cluster , composed of a carbon monoxide dehydrogenase ( codh ) , a hydrogenase and a na +/ h + antiporter121314 .
we have enhanced the h2 production rate of the strain through knowledge - based rational design , such as by overexpressing genes in the codh gene cluster by promoter engineering or by co regulator engineering14151617 .
although the design was successful , the resulting mutant strains could not grow in a fermentor supplied with a co flow rate above 800 ml min - 1 .
therefore , the development of a mutant with improved performance at high co flow rates is desirable .
in the current study , we utilized evolutionary engineering to optimize t. onnurineus na1 under co conditions and investigated the underlying mechanism of optimization by employing multi - omics analysis .
genetic variations and transcriptomic and epigenomic changes were analyzed using next generation sequencing .
the methylation profile of na1 was monitored via smrt dna sequencing18 .
dna methylation has been reported to be involved in the regulation of genome replication19 .
genome - scale methylation patterns of some bacteria and archaea have been published202122 .
however , genomic scale interpretation of base modifications has not yet been reported for hyperthermophiles .
kinetic analysis of h2 production in the adapted strain was conducted and compared with other genetically engineered strains .
results physiological changes in t. onnurineus na1 during adaptive evolution on co we applied an evolutionary approach to enable t. onnurineus na1 to adapt to 100 % pure co. t. onnurineus na1 was grown to stationary phase to trigger spontaneous mutation23242526 and then transferred to fresh medium containing co as an energy source ; the strain was transferred over 150 times. through these serial transfers , physiological changes were monitored , and gradual increases in cell density , h2 production rate and co consumption rate were observed ( fig. 1 ) .
after 156 transfers , the evolved strain , designated 156 t , showed 2.8 - , 6.5 - and 5.9 - fold higher values in maximum cell density , h2 production rate and co consumption rate , respectively , than the parental strain ( 2 t ) ( fig. 1 ) .
the correlation between the increases in co consumption rate and h2 production rate seemed to reflect that h2 production occurred by hydrogenogenic carboxydotrophy .
the enhanced cell growth was associated with the increases in co consumption rate and h2 production , concomitant with energy conservation via the conversion of co oxidation .
genomic analysis the genomic dna of 156 t was isolated and sequenced using illumina hi - seq2000 and smrt dna sequencing .
in comparison with the sequence of the parental strain , several mutations , including base substitutions , deletions and insertions , were identified and verified by sanger sequencing ( table 1 , supplementary fig. 1 ) .
the mutation list includes base substitutions , leading to amino acid changes , in aromatic amino acid permease ( ton _ 0820 ) , transcriptional regulator ( ton _ 1525 ) and membrane protein ( ton _ 1544 ) and single - or multiple - base deletions / insertions in aminotransferase ( ton _ 0982 ) , hypothetical protein ( ton _ 1548 ) , cation transporter ( ton _ 1664 ) , metalloprotease ( 12 bp inserted ) ( ton _ 1694 ) , and alcohol dehydrogenase ( 338 bp deleted ) ( ton _ 0544 ) , as well as in the intergenic region ( 51 bp deleted ) between sodium / phosphate symporter ( ton _ 1475 ) and pyruvate / ketoisovalerate ferredoxin oxidoreductase ( ton _ 1476 ) .
a long deletion ( 5786 bp deleted ) between cytosolic nife - hydrogenase subunit gamma ( ton _ 0536 ) and 4fe - 4 s binding protein ( ton _ 0541 ) also occurred ( supplementary fig. 2 ) .
genome - wide transcriptional analysis transcriptional changes were monitored by rna - seq using rna samples from the strains produced after 2 , 12 , 32 , 62 , 102 , 122 , and 156 transfers .
the differentially expressed genes in each transferred strain were selected using the deseq and edger packages after being compared against the transcript levels in the 2 t strain .
as the transfer process continued , the number of differentially expressed genes ( degs ) gradually increased .
approximately 200 and 500 degs were found in the early stages of transfer ( 12 t , 32 t , 62 t ) and late stages of transfer ( 102 t , 122 t , 156 t ) , respectively .
to interpret the biological and functional meanings of these transcriptional changes , a total of 819 degs were categorized according to archaeal clusters of orthologous genes ( arcogs ) 27 ( fig. 2a ) .
as the transfer process progressed , we observed remarkable changes in the number of upregulated degs in the cog j ( translation , ribosomal structure and biogenesis ) , cog k ( transcription ) and cog l ( replication , recombination and repair ) groupings , together belonging to the category ' information storage and processing ' ( fig. 2a and supplementary data 1 ) .
the gradual increase in deg expression concomitant with the adaptation process seems reasonable because the overexpression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins , rna polymerase subunits , dna polymerase ii subunits , translation / transcription initiation or elongation factors and dna topoisomerase subunits supports the observed faster growth and increased growth yield .
gene clusters encoding seven hydrogenases , sulfi , sulfii , mbh , mfh2 , mch and frh , and one oxidoreductase , mbx , homologous to hydrogenase28 , were included in the deg list ; they fell under the cog c ( energy production and conservation ) grouping .
the expression levels of the atp synthase genes ( ton _ 1749 - 1753 ) gradually increased during the adaptation .
in particular , genes encoding codh - mch subunits ( ton _ 1017 - 1024 ) that are essential for hydrogenogenic carboxydotrophy were significantly upregulated at both the transcriptional and translational level as the transfer process progressed ( fig. 2 , supplementary fig. 3a ) .
the codh - mch complex has been proposed to oxidize co , thereby conserving energy by generating an electrochemical gradient14 .
the electrochemical gradient is eventually coupled to atp generation by atp synthase ; therefore , the overexpression of codh - mch and atp synthase could allow cells to generate more atp .
the expression of other gene clusters did not persistently increase during the adaption .
the mbh genes ( ton _ 1583 - 1595 ) were strongly upregulated during the early stages of adaptation , but their transcript levels during the late stages of adaption were similar to those in the 2 t strain .
the mbx genes ( ton _ 0486 - 0498 ) were only upregulated at late stages .
the mbh and mbx might be necessary to dispose of or recycle reduced ferredoxin generated from amino acid degradation .
conversely , the genes encoding sulfi ( ton _ 0534 - 0537 ) , sulfii ( ton _ 0052 ) , mfh2 ( ton _ 1564 - 1580 ) and frh ( ton _ 1560 - 1561 ) showed significant downregulation throughout the entire adaptation period ( supplementary fig. 3b ) .
mfh2 has been reported to participate in energy conservation using electrons generated from formate oxidation , and two soluble hydrogenases , sulfi and sulfii , have been proposed to uptake h2 to enhance reducing power2930 .
during the adaptation period , the cells seemed likely to upregulate the genes necessary for growth on co and to downregulate the genes not needed for this growth .
the upregulated genes in the cog p ( inorganic ion transport and metabolism ) grouping included two gene clusters encoding na +/ h + antiporters ( ton _ 1021 - 1031 , ton _ 1582 - 1589 ) in proximity to the mch and mbh hydrogenases ( supplementary fig. 3a ) .
these antiporters have been proposed to form a complex with hydrogenase subunits that exchanges proton gradients into sodium gradients ; these gradients are eventually coupled with atp generation by a sodium - specific atp synthase31 .
the transcript patterns of these antiporter genes were correlated with those of their cognate hydrogenase gene clusters .
genes encoding iron transporters ( ton _ 0255 - 0256 , 0984 , 1873 ) and a peptide transporter ( ton _ 1765 - 1768 ) exhibited increased transcript levels , likely to enhance cellular uptake of iron and peptides to facilitate cell growth .
the gene encoding the cell envelope s - layer protein ( ton _ 0413 ) was also upregulated together with genes ( ton _ 1837 , 1842 - 1843 , 1848 , 1851 ) involved in the synthesis of dtdp - l - rhamnose , a substrate used for the glycosylation of s - layer protein32 ( supplementary fig. 4 ) .
genome - wide epigenomic analysis adenine and cytosine methylation patterns in the genomes of the 2 t and 156 t strains were analyzed by smrt dna sequencing18 ( fig. 3 ) .
in both strands of the 2 t and 156 t genomes , 2190 and 2105 sites of n6 - methyl adenine ( m6a ) were respectively detected .
adenine methylation remained virtually the same , and more than 95 % of the methylated sites ( 2017 out of 2190 ) in the 2 t strain were also detected in the 156 t strain , while the number of hemi - methylated sites increased as the adaptation process progressed .
after analyzing the sequences surrounding the modified sites by meme ( supplementary table 1 ) , more than 95 % of the adenine methylation sequences were identified to contain a ( gt ( c / a )( g / t ) ac ) motif , which corresponds to the acci restriction enzyme site .
the acci restriction enzyme ( ton _ 1382 ) and its cognate methyltransferase ( ton _ 1383 ) are encoded in the t. onnurineus na1 genome .
conversely , the cytosine residue methylation pattern significantly changed .
in the 2 t and 156 t strains , 83 and 40 cytosine residues methylated at the n4 site of the cytosine base ( n4 - methylcytosine , m4c ) were respectively identified ( supplementary data 2 ) .
among the 40 methylated cytosines in the 156 t strain , 36 of the methylated cytosines were not modified in the 2 t strain .
the target sequence for cytosine methylation was not as clear as that for adenine methylation , but gm4cc was likely to be preferentially methylated over other possible sequences , such as tm4cc , am4cc and cm4cc .
more than 50 % of the cytosine methylation sites possessed gm4cc sequences in both the 2 t ( 53 sites ) and 156 t ( 24 sites ) strains .
in the promoter region of the mfh2 hydrogenase gene cluster , two distinct methylation sites were identified only in the 156 t strain .
the methylated cytosine residues were adjacent to the dna - binding motif ( gttnnnaac ) for a putative sulfur response regulator , surr ( supplementary fig. 6a ) , that has been reported in pyrococcus furiosus33 .
one methylated adenine residue was detected inside an inverted repeat .
although it was not experimentally proven , the methylation of this residue might affect the binding of surr and an unknown transcriptional regulator to the mfh2 promoter , resulting in the downregulation of the gene cluster .
after a few transfers , the transcript levels of the genes in the mfh2 gene cluster were drastically downregulated ( supplementary fig. 6b - d ) .
effects of mutations on adaptive physiological changes to determine the mutations critical to physiological change , we tracked the distributions of seven mutations within the coding regions of selected transferred strains .
the timepoint when each mutation initiated was scattered from 12th transfer to 156th transfer , and the distribution of each mutation increased as the number of transfers increased , except for the mutation in the aminotransferase gene ( ton _ 0982 ) ( supplementary fig. 7 ) .
considering the pattern of changes in h2 production rate and co consumption rate , that is , small increases during early stages and then big increases after 102nd transfer , the distributions of mutations of the genes encoding putative transcriptional regulator ( ton _ 1525 ) and aromatic amino acid permease ( ton _ 0820 ) among total population seemed well matched with those physiological changes .
therefore , the ton _ 1525 and ton _ 0820 mutations found in strain 156 t were introduced into the parental strain .
the resulting mutant , ton _ 1525 ( t55i )/ wt ( designated as mc11 ) , showed a higher co consumption rate than the wild - type strain ; this rate was comparable to that of the 156 t strain ( fig. 4a ) .
the increased co consumption in the mc11 strain was likely related to the increased transcript levels of the genes in the codh gene cluster .
the transcript levels of the ton _ 1018 , ton _ 1023 , and ton _ 1031 genes were respectively 20.6 - , 25.4 - , and 47.7 - fold higher than the levels in the parental strain ( fig. 4b ) .
consistent with the transcriptional changes , codh ( ton _ 1018 ) and mch ( ton _ 1023 ) protein expression significantly increased in the mc11 mutant ( fig. 4c ) .
these results indicate that the mutation in the ton _ 1525 gene played a crucial role in causing physiological change by enhancing the transcript levels of the codh gene cluster .
to investigate whether the ton _ 1525 protein could act like a dna binding protein on the codh promoter and whether mutation of ton _ 1525 affected its binding affinity , wild - type and t55i recombinant ton _ 1525 proteins were expressed and purified from e. coli .
the unmodified recombinant ton _ 1525 protein specifically bound to the codh promoter , while the binding affinity of the t55i mutant protein was less than that of the wild - type protein , as shown by competition electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( emsa ) ( supplementary fig. 5 ) .
at present , ton _ 1525 can be predicted to function as a transcriptional repressor on the codh promoter , as mutation of ton _ 1525 decreased its binding affinity toward the regulator of the promoter and elevated the transcript level of the downstream gene cluster .
the effect of the mutation of ton _ 0820 was not clearly shown when we assessed a ton _ 0820 ( l65r )/ wt mutant .
however , when we reverted the mutation ( l65r ) in the 156 t strain back to the wild - type sequence ( r65l ) , creating ton _ 0820 ( r65l )/ 156 t , significant decreases in cell density and h2 production were observed ( fig. 4d,e ) .
this result suggests that the mutation of ton _ 0820 is another critical factor underlying the observed physiological changes that occurred during the adaptive evolution process , probably in combination with other factors .
kinetic measurements of co consumption and h2 production based on the phenotype developed by the 156 t strain following serial transfers under co conditions , the h2 production potential of the strain was tested in a bioreactor where 100 % co was continuously fed at a high flow rate .
the 156 t strain showed a 7 - and 5.2 - fold higher maximum biomass yield and h2 production rate , respectively , when grown under co at a flow rate of 400 ml min - 1 than those of the wild - type strain ( supplementary fig. 8a,b ) .
the growth yield based on the optical cell density measured at 600 nm was 5.5 , which is very exceptional for a hyperthermophilic archaeon .
the 156 t strain also showed growth and produced h2 at flow rates of 800 ml min - 1 and above , whereas the rationally designed mutants could not grow , indicating that adaptation rendered the 156 t strain less sensitive to high co levels ( supplementary fig. 8c,d ) .
it is noteworthy that the 156 t strain displayed the highest h2 production rate and specific h2 production rate among the previously reported mutants ( table 2 ) .
h2 production by the 156 t strain was investigated using synthetic gas ( syngas ) derived from coal gasification .
the h2 production rate and specific h2 production rate linearly correlated with the flow rate of syngas ( supplementary table 2 ) .
considering the composition of the syngas , which is comprised of a low co level and contaminated with ch4 , n2 , co2 and h2 , the h2 production rates , calculated by subtracting the h2 content of the syngas , were considerable in comparison with the values obtained under conditions with 100 % co. taken together , these results illustrate that adaptive evolution is a powerful method of developing a carboxydotrophic hydrogenogen with enhanced h2 production from co. discussion in the current study , we performed evolutionary engineering of a hyperthermophilic archaeon , t. onnurineus na1 , known as a carboxydotrophic hydrogenogen14 or formate - oxidizing archaeon34 , to enhance h2 production from co. over 150 serial transfers of cell cultures led t. onnurineus na1 to adapt to possess better utilization of co and higher production of h2 , associated with increased cell density .
genomic analysis revealed a total of ten mutations over 2000 generations .
the mutation rates of t. onnurineus na1 were estimated to be approximately 0.00097 +/ - 0.00052 per replication35 and 0.0018 per genome per replication36 .
considering that the mean mutation rates of e. coli and s. cerevisiae are 1.06 and 1.39 per 100 generations , respectively7 , the mutation rate of t. onnurineus na1 was quite low , reflecting that thermophilic microbes possess mechanisms to ensure genetic fidelity , a crucial component of the ability to sustain life under extreme environments3536 .
it is noteworthy that a long deletion , encompassing approximately 5.8 kb of coding region , occurred very early after the 12th transfer .
our study unveiled two mutations in the ton _ 1525 and ton _ 0820 genes that played pivotal roles in the adaptive evolution of t. onnurineus na1 on co .
ton _ 1525 belongs to a family of tfx dna - binding proteins that has not been well studied .
the tfx protein that has been identified in methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum consists of two domains , a basic dna - binding domain with a helix - turn - helix motif and an acidic domain possibly used for transcriptional activation37 .
multiple sequence alignment revealed that ton _ 1525 showed only 22.9 % sequence identity to tfx from m. thermoautotrophicum .
a blast search revealed that ton _ 1525 showed sequence identities of over 30 % toward a set of genes annotated as a transcriptional regulator or , a dna - binding protein of thermococcales species and methanogens .
based on emsa data , ton _ 1525 seems likely to play a role as a transcriptional repressor on the codh promoter .
previously , a co - responsive regulator , corqr , was reported to activate the expression of the codh gene cluster15 .
we did not detect any mutations in corqr during the adaptation process .
another crucial mutation at ton _ 0820 seemed contributed to enhancing final cell density ( fig. 4d,e ) .
l65r alteration of wild - type strain did not show much effect , however , r65l mutation in 156 t significantly decreased final cell density .
the ton _ 0820 mutation might contribute to enhancing cell density probably by supplying more aromatic amino acids .
the genome of t. onnurineus na1 does not encode biosynthetic pathways for aromatic amino acids such as thr , phe and trp12 .
these results indicated that two mutations contribute to enhance co consumption and fitness , however , we need consider to effect of other mutations and further experiments are required to understand overall mechanism under genomic variations on co - containing medium .
although the distribution pattern is not so well match with physiological changes , ton _ 0982 or ton _ 1694 encoding amino transferase or a membrane associated - protease , respectively can affect cell growth by modulating the rate of amino acid / protein hydrolysis .
the functionality of ton _ 1544 and ton _ 1548 could not be predicted or understood at this moment and the role of ton _ 1664 encoding cation transporter in archaea is unclear yet and awaits further analysis .
epigenomic analysis revealed cytosine methylation at n4 sites in t. onnurineus na1 .
n4 - methylcytosine ( m4c ) has been discovered in both thermophilic and mesophilic bacteria3839 .
considering the high incidence of deamination at high temperatures40 , the m4c modification may help avoid high mutation rates in organisms living at high temperatures .
as deamination of m5c residues increases at high temperatures , thermophiles are unlikely to possess m5c residues in their genomes38 .
aside from the existence of several other genes annotated as restriction enzymes and putative methyltransferases in the genome , no other consensus sequences , except the sequence encoding the acci restriction site , were discovered in proximity to methylated adenine sites .
nonetheless , it is noteworthy that the methylation profile produced in this study relied on the detection ability of smrt dna sequencing technology , and we cannot completely exclude the possibility that other types of methylation could exist in t. onnurineus na1 .
in conclusion , we performed evolutionary engineering of a hyperthermophilic archaeon using co and demonstrated that this approach was very effective in enhancing h2 productivity .
the underlying mechanism was unique in that a novel transcriptional regulator was identified as a crucial adaptation factor , in addition to the potential involvement of distinctive epigenomic changes .
the evolved strain was superior to previously reported strains engineered by rational design .
in addition to by - product gases from the steel - making process41 , syngas from a coal gasifier was shown to be an alternative source of co for h2 production by t. onnurineus na1 .
methods strains , media and culture conditions the t. onnurineus na1 ( kctc10859 ) strain was routinely cultured in yeast extract - peptone - sulfur ( yps ) medium as previously reported42 .
the modified medium 1 ( mm1 ) 3443 was prepared with 1 g liter - 1 yeast extract , 35 g liter - 1 nacl , 0.7 g liter - 1 kcl , 3.9 g liter - 1 mgso4 , 0.4 g liter - 1 cacl2.2 h2o , 0.3 g liter - 1 nh4cl , 0.15 g liter - 1 na2hpo4 , 0.03 g liter - 1 na2sio3 , 0.5 g liter - 1 nahco3 , 0.5 g liter - 1 cysteine - hcl , and 0.001 g liter - 1 resazurin .
one milliliter liter - 1 of holden 's trace element / fe - edta solution44 and 1 ml liter - 1 of balch 's vitamin solution45 were added as a supplement to the medium .
after autoclaving , the medium was kept in an anaerobic chamber ( coy laboratory products , grass lake , mi ) filled with an anoxic gas mixture ( n2 : h2 : co2 , 90:5:5 ) to equilibrate , and the final ph of the medium was adjusted to 6.5 with 2 n hcl .
for the cultures in serum bottles , the media were reduced with 0.005 % na2s.9 h2o and the headspaces were filled with 100 % co ( mm1 - co ) .
the serum bottles were sealed with bromobutyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimp caps .
for the adaptive evolution , the parental strain was cultured on mm1 - co medium at 80 degreesc for 20 h and then a 2 % ( v / v ) cells were inoculated into a fresh medium using a sterile syringe .
at every tenth transfer , cell cultures were stoked at 4 degreesc for later use .
for batch culture , the strain was cultured in a 3 l bioreactor ( fermentec , cheongwon , korea ) , whose working volume was 2 l at 300 rpm agitation speed .
the batch culture was maintained at ph 6.1 - 6.2 using 0.2 m naoh in 3.5 % nacl .
using a mass flow controller , 100 % co was supplied at feeding rates of 400 , 800 or 1000 ml min - 1 ( mkprecision , seoul , korea ) .
coal - gasified syngas ( 30.9 % co , 20.4 % h2 , 6.95 % co2 , 1.42 % ch4 , and 32.1 % n2 ) was provided by the institute for advanced engineering in korea and supplied at feeding rates of 160 , 320 , 480 or 640 ml min - 1 .
the cultures were maintained under anaerobic conditions by preparing the media in an anaerobic chamber ( coy laboratory products , grass lake , usa ) filled with an anoxic gas mixture ( n2 : h2 : co2 , 90:5:5 ) , and the bioreactor was sparged with pure argon gas ( 99.999 %) through a microsparger .
construction of mutants mutants of the ton _ 1525 and ton _ 0820 genes were made by applying a gene recombination system .
briefly , we designed primer sets for base - pair substitutions and mutated the ton _ 1525 and ton _ 0820 genes by site - directed mutagenesis .
each mutated gene and its flanking regions were ligated by one - step sequence - and ligation - independent cloning ( slic ) 46 , and subsequent mutants were generated through homologous recombination using an unmarked in - frame deletion15 method and a modified gene disruption system that has been previously used for thermococcus kodakarensis kod147 .
the mutations were verified by pcr using the primers listed in supplementary table 3 for sanger sequencing .
preparation of cell suspensions and myoglobin assay to analyze co consumption rate , a myoglobin assay was conducted by modifying a previously reported protocol4849 .
to prepare cell suspensions , cells were cultured on mm1 - co medium and then harvested by centrifugation at 7500 x g for 20 min at room temperature under anaerobic conditions .
cell pellets were washed twice and resuspended in mm1 medium .
final cell density ( expressed as optical density at 600 nm ) was measured with a biophotometer plus uv - vis spectrophotometer ( eppendorf , hamburg , germany ) and adjusted to 0.3 .
aliquots of 100 mul of the cell suspension were mixed with 0.9 ml of co - saturated mm1 medium and incubated at 80 degreesc .
during the reaction , 10 mul of the reaction solution was collected every 3 mins and immediately added to a quartz cuvette containing a myoglobin reaction mixture that included 56 mum myoglobin ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , uas ) from equine heart dissolved in 10 mm sodium thionite in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer ( ph 7 ) .
after a 3 min incubation , the absorbance at 423 nm was measured to analyze consumed co. purification of the proteins encoded by ton _ 1525 ( wt ) and ton _ 1525 ( t55i ) ton _ 1525 and ton _ 1525 ( t55i ) plasmids were transformed into an e. coli bl21 rosetta ( de3 ) plyss strain .
gene expression was induced by iptg at the mid - exponential growth phase , followed by a 3 h incubation at 37 degreesc .
the cells were harvested by centrifugation ( 6,000 x g at 4 degreesc for 20 min ) and resuspended in 50 mm tris - hcl buffer ( ph 8.0 ) containing 0.1 m kcl and 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol .
the cells were disrupted by sonication and then centrifuged at 15,000 x g at 4 degreesc for 30 min .
the resulting supernatant was applied to a column loaded with talon metal affinity resin ( bd clontech , mountain view , ca ) and washed with 10 mm imidazole in 50 mm tris - hcl buffer ( ph 8.0 ) containing 0.1 m kcl and 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol .
the enzyme was eluted with the same buffer but with the addition of 300 mm imidazole .
protein concentration was determined by bradford assay , and protein purity was evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) .
electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( emsa ) dna probes for emsa were produced from t. onnurineus na1 genomic dna .
a 150 - bp probe corresponding to the codh promoter was amplified using the primer pair labeled _ fam _ 1017 _ 150 _ f and 1017 _ 150 _ r .
for competition analysis , a specific 150 - bp cold competitor probe was derived from the same codh promoter region as above via amplification using the primer pair unlabeled _ fam _ 1017 _ 150 _ f and 1017 _ 150 _ r .
poly ( deoxyinosinic - deoxycytidylic acid ) ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , usa ) and puc18 plasmid dna ( new england biolabs , ipswich , ma ) digested with hpa ii were used as nonspecific competitors in 100x molar excess .
the pcr products were purified using a qiagen pcr purification kit ( qiagen , gmbh , hilden , germany ) .
emsa reactions including 100 nm dna with varying amounts of protein were set up in 20 mul of emsa buffer ( 20 mm tris - hcl , 200 mm kcl , 1 mm edta , 5 % glycerol , ph 7.5 ) .
after reaction at 80 degreesc for 10 min , the samples were immediately loaded onto a non - denaturing 5 % polyacrylamide gel .
the resulting gel was stained with ethidium bromide ( etbr ) and analyzed to visualize the presence of proteins in the shifted bands .
all of the primers that were used are listed in supplementary table 3 .
reverse transcription - quantitative pcr ( rt - qpcr ) and western blotting to eliminate genomic dna from total rna preparations , 8 mug of rna was incubated with 8 units of rnase - free dnase i ( thermo scientific fermentas , st. leon - rot , germany ) at 37 degreesc for 30 min and purified via chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation .
rna was quantified with a nanodrop 2000 uv - vis spectrophotometer ( thermo scientific , west palm beach , usa ) , and cdna was created from 1 mug of rna by incubation with 40 units of moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase ( thermo scientific fermentas , st. leon - rot , germany ) , 5 mum random hexamers , and 1 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphate ( dntp ) at 37 degreesc for 1 h in reverse transcription buffer .
the reaction products were serially diluted to find the adequate concentration for real - time pcr analysis , and the samples were amplified with sybr green real - time pcr master mix ( toyobo , osaka , japan ) .
amplified signals were detected using the steponeplus system ( applied biosystems , foster city , usa ) , and all primers that were used are listed in supplementary table 3 .
the relative amount of each gene was calculated based on cycle threshold ( ct ) values using a relative standard curve after normalization against the corresponding quantity of 16 s rrna ( ton _ 1979 ) .
western blots were prepared and analyzed using a chemiluminescent dye from an immun - star horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) chemiluminescent kit ( bio - rad , hercules , usa ) .
polyclonal antibodies were produced by immunizing rabbits with recombinant ton _ 1018 or ton _ 1023 proteins according to established procedures for producing custom rabbit antibodies ( young in frontier co. , seoul , korea ) and purified through his - bind resin ( novagen , madison , usa ) .
genome sequencing for genome re - sequencing , we extracted genomic dna from cultures of the 156 t strain without single - colony isolation .
genome sequencing was performed using illumina hiseq - 2000 ( macrogen , seoul , korea ) and pacbio single molecule real - time ( smrt ) sequencing ( pacific biosciences , menlo park , usa ) 50 .
hiseq - 2000 sequencing was performed using barcoded adaptors for multiplexed paired - end 101 bp sequencing and provided 100x coverage of the 156 t genome .
the resulting genomic sequence data were processed using casava - 1.8.2 and bwa v0.5.9 - r16 software ( illumina , san diego , usa ) for alignment .
pcr duplicates were removed by picard v1.79 , and variants were detected using samtools v0.1.18 .
pacbio smrt sequencing of a 10 - kb insert library provided approximately 100x coverage .
assembly and consensus polishing were performed using smrtpipe hgap and smrtpipe quiver , respectively .
all mutations were verified by pcr and sanger sequencing , and all primers are listed in supplementary table 3 .
rna extraction and rna sequencing rna was prepared from exponentially growing cells that were transferred 2 , 12 , 32 , 62 , 102 , 122 or 156 times into co - containing media .
rna extraction was performed using trizol reagent ( invitrogen , carlsbad , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions with some modifications , and the quantity and quality of the total rna were evaluated using rna electropherograms ( agilent 2100 bioanalyzer , palo alto , usa ) and rna integrity numbers ( rins ) 51 .
a total of 10 mug of total rna over an rin value of 8.0 from each sample was used as a starting material and treated with a ribo - zero rrna removal kit for bacteria ( epicentre , madison , usa ) .
the resulting mrna samples were processed into sequencing libraries using a truseq stranded total rna sample prep kit ( illumina , san diego , usa ) following the manufacturer 's protocol .
sequencing was performed using a hiseq 2500 ( illumina , san diego , usa ) to generate directional , paired - end 100 base pair reads .
quality - filtered reads were mapped to a national center for biotechnology information ( ncbi ) reference genome sequence ( bioproject id prjna59043 ) using clc genomics workbench 6.5 ( clc bio , aarhus , denmark ) .
the raw rna - seq data have been deposited in the ncbi gene expression omnibus ( geo , http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / geo /) under the accession code gse73031 .
identification of differentially expressed genes ( degs ) to evaluate degs , both the deseq and edger packages were used5253 .
replicate experiments were performed only for the initial culture , which was cultured only 2 times .
fold changes in gene expression in a selected series of adapted culture samples were calculated based on comparisons to the initial culture sample .
a false discovery rate ( fdr ) of less than 0.001 and a fold change of either more than 2 or less than 0.5 were used as the criteria for selection , and only genes that passed the thresholds from both algorithms were identified as degs .
to interpret the functions of the identified degs , 819 genes were classified according to the archaeal cluster of orthologous genes ( arcogs ) 27 .
to analyze changes in transcript patterns of pathway - related genes , the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) database ( http :// www.genome.jp / kegg /) was also used .
methylation site analysis using a covaris g - tube ( covaris , inc. , woburn , ma , usa ) , we generated 20 - kb dna fragments by shearing genomic dna and removed small fragments using an ampurexp bead purification system ( beckman coulter inc , brae , ca , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
a total of 5 mug of each sample was used as input for library preparation .
a smrtbell library was constructed using a smrtbell ( tm ) template prep kit 1.0 ( pacific biosciences , menlo park , usa ) .
using the bluepippin size selection system ( sage science , inc. , beverly , ma , usa ) , we removed the small fragments to create a large - insert library .
after a sequencing primer annealed to the smrtbell template , the smrtbell libraries were bound to polymerases using a dna / polymerase binding kit p4 ( pacific biosciences , menlo park , usa ) .
following the polymerase binding reaction , a magbead kit ( pacific biosciences , menlo park , usa ) was used to bind the library complex to magbeads before sequencing .
magbead - bound complexes provide more reads per smrt cell .
the polymerase - smrtbell - adaptor complex was then loaded into zero - mode waveguides ( zmws ) .
the smrtbell library was sequenced using 2 smrt cells ( pacific biosciences , menlo park , usa ) with c2 chemistry ( dna sequencing reagent 2.0 ) , and 1 x 180 min movies were captured for each smrt cell using a pacbio rs sequencing platform ( pacific biosciences , menlo park , usa ) .
to determine methylation sites , pacific biosciences smrtanalysis software ( version 2.1.1 ) was used , and the method depended on the sensitivity of the polymerase kinetics to the dna template structure , as dna synthesis was recorded in real time .
an in silico kinetic reference and t - test based kinetic score were calculated based on interpulse duration ( ipd ) for detection of modified base positions .
bioinformatics analysis a homology search was performed using the basic local alignment search tool ( blast ; http :// blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / blast.cgi ) against a nonredundant protein database maintained by the national center for biotechnology information ( ncbi ) 54 .
multiple sequence alignment was performed using a pairwise sequence alignment ( http :// www.ebi.ac.uk / tools / psa /) tool from the european bioinformatics institute ( ebi ) .

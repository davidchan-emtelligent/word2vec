a 33 - year - old male presented for resection of an intracranial mass after 1 year of recurrent headaches and dizziness .
cerebrospinal fluid testing had shown a lymphocytic pleocytosis ( 163 cells / mm3 , 59 % lymphocytes , 20 % neutrophils ) with normal protein ( 42 mg / dl ) , glucose ( 54 mg / dl ) , cultures , and serologic testing .
multiple brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) studies showed enlarged ventricles but no masses .
immediately before surgery , a discrete cystic structure was visible on imaging ( figure 1 figure 1 .
( a ) gadolinium - enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the brain showing evidence of a fourth ventricular cystic structure .
( b ) histopathology of a surgically removed cyst with i ) cuticular layer with microvilli , ii ) cellular layer , and iii ) reticular layer .
( c ) dissected cyst ( neurocysticercosis ) protruding from fourth ventricle .
( d ) cyst post - excision .
). a large cyst consistent with neurocysticercosis was identified intraoperatively .
no additional lesions were observed , and he had complete resolution of symptoms .
he received 7 days of albendazole , dexamethasone , and levetiracetam per guidelines for a solitary lesion.1 follow - up imaging using higher resolution ( 1 mm versus 6 mm planes ) and volumetric sequencing displayed an extra - parenchymal cyst with a visible scolex lateral to the fourth ventricle ( figure 2 figure 2 .
axial t2 .
follow - up imaging 2 months post - surgical .
( a ) 1.2 cm cyst located at the right foramen of luschka ( lateral recess of the fourth ventricle ) consistent with neurocysticercosis cyst with internal scolex .
( b ) post - surgical image displaying post - surgical changes to the fourth ventricle without evidence of residual cyst .
). as a result of surgical excision , there was no evidence of a residual fourth ventricle cyst .
his mri spine was negative , and he received two additional months of therapy until radiographic resolution , per guidelines for extra - parenchymal lesions.1 this thin walled extra - parynchymal cyst was uncovered with higher quality imaging using both finer planes and an ultrafast mri technique known as volumetric imaging ( e.g. , fast imaging employing steady - state acquisition [ fiesta ] sequencing ) .
ideally , higher quality imaging would have revealed these cysts preoperatively .
however , his films were suggestive of mass lesion and thus volumetric imaging was not performed until the surgical pathology provided a definitive diagnosis .
this case displays the role that high quality volumetric imaging plays in the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis .

i read the review article written by dong et al .
[ 1 ] regarding the renal effects of sirtuin 1 with great interest .
the authors described the harmful effects of advanced glycation end products on podocyte apoptosis via increasing bcl - 2 protein secondary to forkhead box o4 ( foxo4 ) acetylation in diabetes mellitus according to chung et al. ' findings .
however , chuang et al .
[ 2 ] demonstrated that the apoptosis of podocyte was associated with the expression of a proapoptosis gene , bcl - 2 - like 11 ( bcl2l11 ) , not antiapoptotic bcl - 2 .
to date , a total of 25 bcl - 2 related genes have been identified .
among them , bcl - 2 , bcl - xl , and bcl - w are antiapoptotic ; however , bad , bax , bak , and bcl2l11 are proapoptotic [ 3 ] .
hence , researchers should consider this important knowledge to avoid misunderstanding .
conflict of interests the author declares that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper .

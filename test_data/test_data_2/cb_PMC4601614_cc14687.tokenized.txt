the body responds to noise in the same way as it responds to stress and over time can impair health .
research clearly shows that hospital noise levels exceed noise level recommendations and have the potential to increase complications in patients .
what is less known is the effect critical care unit noise has on nurses .
objective the purpose of this article is to discuss critical care unit noise .
methods by measuring noise during peak and off - peak icu hours , analysts can detect and correct the noise .
noise meter readings established by a pollution control board offer quantitative readings that help predict , and therefore prevent , future noise problems .
we identified the primary sources for noise pollution through a questionnaire applied to these patients and caregivers .
complaints related to undesirable noises were alarms , parametric monitors , and noise caused by the companions of other patients and the multidisciplinary team .
noise measurements were carried out by occupational medicine , which identified the noise peaks as 8:00 p.m .
67 db , 9:00 a.m .
62 db and 1:00 p.m .
63.8 db. the deming model was adopted and by brainstorming with the multidisciplinary team we decided to use educational strategies , lectures for the multidisciplinary team and bookmark images stimulating silence for companions in the icu .
the lectures to staff were conducted by psychologists and speech therapists about using the voice and care related to behavior and education .
we made new measures of noise after 30 days and noticed a significant drop to 45 db in the night period , 54 db in the morning and 53 db in the afternoon .
conclusion educational activities within work are still the best way to obtain significant results for healthy behaviors to ensure the safety of patients and professionals .

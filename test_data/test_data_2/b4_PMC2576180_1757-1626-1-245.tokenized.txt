introduction rapture of a renal angiomyolipoma and massive retroperitoneal hemorrhage , during pregnancy is rare and occasionally fatal .
the association of this complication with pregnancy has been reported sporadically in the literature .
case presentation we report a case of a 28 years old woman , in 33 week of her first pregnancy who came to our hospital complaining of abdominal pain in the right hemiabdomen , associated with nausea and vomiting .
the ultrasound and mri ( magnetic resonance imaging ) scan showed a 7 x 7 x 5 cm mass suggestive of angiomyolipoma in the right kidney , with evidence of retroperitoneal bleeding right perirenal and intrarenal haematoma .
given the size of the tumor , presence of symptoms and hemodynamic instability of the patient right nephrectomy was performed , following emergency caesarean delivery .
the histological study of the resected mass revealed the presence of angiomyolipoma .
conclusion in conclusion , it seems that these tumours show a greater growth index in pregnant women .
angiomyolipoma with spontaneous bleeding during pregnancy is a dangerous condition that may cause mortality in the mother and fetus , but elective , simultaneous cesarean section and radical nephrectomy can be performed .
we have also done a review of the literature focusing on its management and its relationship with pregnancy .
introduction renal angiomyolipoma ( aml ) is a relatively infrequent clinical entity observed in 0.3 % of the general population and accounting for 3 % of all solid renal masses .
amls are benign mesothelial tumors , with three histologic characteristics : mature adipose tissue , blood vessels , and smooth muscle cells .
most of amls are asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging examinations .
it has been described 2 types : isolated angiomyolipoma and angiomyolipoma associated with sclerosis .
when aml is associated with complex clinical situations , such as developed in a solitary kidney , bilateral presence , large or multicentric tumors of those associated with tuberous sclerosis ( bourneville 's disease ) , or pregnancy , have medical interest and the management of these are quite challenging .
to the best of our knowledge , during the past 10 years only three cases of massive retroperitoneal hemorrhage , resulting from rupture of a renal angiomyolipoma during pregnancy have occurred .
in addition of report of this rare medical case we include brief comments of pathophysiology , diagnosis and treatment of this rare tumor .
case presentation we report a case of a 28 years old woman , in 33 week of her first pregnancy , who was admitted to our department for severe right flank pain , detected in right hypochondrium , associated with nausea , vomiting , and irritative bladder symptoms .
personal and familial histories were unremarkable .
the patient was hemodynamically stable without hematuria , lumbar pain or other urological symptoms .
physical examination revealed no specific findings , a good general condition , an axillary temperature of 38degreesc , blood pressure of 120 / 75 mmhg and a heart rate of 78 bpm .
abdominal palpation revealed no masses .
the only pathological laboratory test parameter was the hemoglobin 8,7 g / dl and hematocrit of 25,5 % , that required the transfusion of two red cell concentrate units .
abdominal ultrasound examination revealed a mass , with mixed echogenity , without acoustic shadowing well circumscribed , expanding at the upper pole of right kidney ( fig 1 ) .
the mass confirmed with mri , measuring approximately 7 x 7 x 5 cm in size with evidence of recent extensive retroperitoneal bleeding , with right perirenal and intrarenal hematoma. ( fig 2a - b. ) .

( b ) : coronal abdominal mri view showing the presence of right renal masse , with signs of bleeding .
after a couple of hours she was developed an episode of fetal bradycardia , hypotension , and a hematocrit continued to decline , despite repeated blood transfusion , which combined with symptoms of intense lumbar pain and hematuria .
considering the hemodynamic instability of the patient , emergency cesarean delivery , under general anaesthesia , was undertaken , because of foetal distress .
exploration of the retroperitoneal space after foetal extraction , confirmed the presence of a large haematoma and the renal mass. , which occupied the intrarenal space ( fig. 3a ) .
right nephrectomy was performed , and the haemorrhaging contents was evacuated .
( fig 3b. ) .

the histological study of the resected mass revealed the presence of with admixture of mature adipose tissue , smooth muscle , and thick - walled blood vessels. ( fig. 4 ) figure 4 photomicrograph ( original magnification , x40 ; hematoxylin - eosin stain ) of one of the numerous tan nodules that replaced the renal parenchyma shows smooth muscle thick - walled blood vessels and fatty tissue .
a healthy male infant was delivered and the patient had an uneventful recovery .
discussion renal aml are not very frequent in urologic activities , especially when it is associated with pregnancy .
the majority of amls are asymptomatic [ 1 ] , but the increasingly widespread application of ultrasound , ct ( computer tomography ) and mri ( magnetic resonance imaging ) are diagnostic exploratory techniques of the renal mass [ 2 ] .
in our patient the finding of the renal tumor mass , during the symptomatic phase when the diaforodiagnostic problem occurred , was the result of an ultrasound examination .
the majority of this kind of tumor , are often solitary , the mean age of presentation is 43 years , 4 times more common in men and , interestingly , involve the right kidney [ 3 ] palpable abdominal mass , hematuria or flank pain are the main symptoms , and acute abdominal or even shock are the results of spontaneous rupture of the tumor [ 4 ] .
the histopathological pattern of the aml consists of mature adipose tissue , containing numerous blood vessel structures within smooth muscles layers and accumulations , histiocytes , macrophages and lymphocytes [ 5 ] .
the true nature of the tumor has not been fully elucidated .
immunological mechanisms seems to be related , since increased numbers of estrogen and progesterone receptors at muscle cell level and the tumour cells contain melanosomes and synthesize melanin because they contain dopa oxidase , are helpful microscopical findings to determine the best management approach [ 6,7 ] .
this hypothesis may be supported by the hormonal profile of pregnant women , due to the presence of progesterone receptors .
the management of aml is widely discussed in the literature .
asymptomatic tumors smaller than 4 cm in size should be subjected to periodic ultrasound and ct controls every 6 months [ 8,9 ] .
symptomatic , bilateral lesions should be treated with selective arterial embolization or partial nephrectomy .
radical nephrectomy is required when the patient is hemodynamic unstable , due to retroperitoneal hemorrhage [ 10 ] .
in our patient , the life threatening hemodynamic profile , in combination with fetal pulse abnormality , required emergency caesarian section and at the same time control of retroperitoneum bleeding , with radical right nephrectomy .
in conclusion , it seems that these tumors show a greater growth index in pregnant women and the question that may be raised is when is the appropriate time for surgical interference .
the second trimester of pregnancy seems to be ideal [ 11 ] , since the risk of fetal organogenetic abnormalities decreases , even though the need of individualization of each case is necessary .

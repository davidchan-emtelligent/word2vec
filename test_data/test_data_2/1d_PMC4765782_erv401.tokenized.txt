highlight among the lesion mimic mutants in rice , the spotted leaf3 ( spl3 ) locus was identified by map - based cloning that encodes osmapkkk1 .
spl3 was found to be involved in aba - responsive signalling and to promote leaf yellowing during senescence .
lesion mimic mutants commonly display spontaneous cell death in pre - senescent green leaves under normal conditions , without pathogen attack .
despite molecular and phenotypic characterization of several lesion mimic mutants , the mechanisms of the spontaneous formation of cell death lesions remain largely unknown .
here , the rice lesion mimic mutant spotted leaf3 ( spl3 ) was examined .
when grown under a light / dark cycle , the spl3 mutant appeared similar to wild - type at early developmental stages , but lesions gradually appeared in the mature leaves close to heading stage. by contrast , in spl3 mutants grown under continuous light , severe cell death lesions formed in developing leaves , even at the seedling stage .
histochemical analysis showed that hydrogen peroxide accumulated in the mutant , likely causing the cell death phenotype. by map - based cloning and complementation , it was shown that a 1 - bp deletion in the first exon of oryza sativa mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase kinase1 ( osmapkkk1 )/ osedr1 / osacdr1 causes the spl3 mutant phenotype .
the spl3 mutant was found to be insensitive to abscisic acid ( aba ) , showing normal root growth in aba - containing media and delayed leaf yellowing during dark - induced and natural senescence .
expression of aba signalling - associated genes was also less responsive to aba treatment in the mutant .
furthermore , the spl3 mutant had lower transcript levels and activities of catalases , which scavenge hydrogen peroxide , probably due to impairment of aba - responsive signalling .
finally , a possible molecular mechanism of lesion formation in the mature leaves of spl3 mutant is discussed .
key words : abscisic acid catalase activity lesion mimic mutant mapkkk reactive oxygen species rice spotted leaf3 .
introduction lesion mimic mutants display cell death in normal conditions and have a common phenotype similar to the pathogen infection - induced hypersensitive response .
the study of lesion mimic mutants has provided insights on the mechanisms of programmed cell death .
lesion mimic mutants have been isolated and characterized in many plants , including maize ( hoisington et al. , 1982 ) , barley ( wolter et al. , 1993 ) , arabidopsis ( noutoshi et al. , 2006 ) , and rice ( wu et al. , 2008 ) .
previous studies revealed that lesion mimic mutant genes encode distinct functional proteins such as a heat stress transcription factor ( yamanouchi et al. , 2002 ) , membrane - associated proteins ( lorrain et al. , 2004 ; noutoshi et al. , 2006 ) , an ion channel family member ( balague et al. , 2003 ; rostoks et al. , 2006 ; mosher et al. , 2010 ) , zinc finger proteins ( dietrich et al. , 1997 ; wang et al. , 2005 ) , an e3 ubiquitin ligase ( zeng et al. , 2004 ) , a clathrin - associated adaptor protein ( qiao et al. , 2010 ) , and splicing factor 3b subunit 3 ( chen et al. , 2012 ) .
thus , the molecular mechanisms of lesion formation seem to be very complicated in plants .
over - accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , such as superoxide radical ( o2 - ) and hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) , is closely associated with lesion formation , as confirmed in several lesion mimic mutants ( qiao et al. , 2010 ; shirsekar et al. , 2014 ) .
it is also reported that lesion mimic phenotypes are affected by the light - intensity and light / dark diurnal cycle ( kusumi et al. , 2000 ) .
thus , endogenous signalling pathways to external stress stimuli are likely impaired in several lesion mimic mutants .
the highly conserved mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) cascade functions in the response to external environmental stimuli , acting in the transduction of extracellular cues to intercellular targets ( widmann et al. , 1999 ) .
the mapk cascade comprises mapks , mapk kinases ( mapkks ) , and mapkk kinases ( mapkkks ) ( schaeffer and weber , 1999 ; widmann et al. , 1999 ; ligterink , 2000 ) .
the arabidopsis thaliana genome has 20 mapks , 10 mapkks , and more than 80 mapkkks ( colcombet and hirt , 2008 ). by contrast , the rice genome encodes 75 mapkkks , 8 mapkks , and 17 mapks ( agrawal et al. , 2003 , hamel et al. , 2006 , rao et al. , 2010 ) .
arabidopsis and rice have many more mapkkks than mapks or mapkks , leading to complicated and variable regulatory cascades .
several arabidopsis mapkkks have been characterized , and they regulate various biological processes , such as cytokinesis ( takahashi et al. , 2010 ) , stomatal development ( kim et al. , 2012 ) , and the responses to biotic ( kieber et al. , 1993 ; frye et al. , 2001 ) and abiotic stresses ( gao and xiang , 2008 ; huang et al. , 2014 ) .
however , studies of mapkkks in rice remain limited .
phytohormone signalling pathways also have important roles in responding to external stress stimuli .
jasmonic acid ( ja ) - , salicylic acid ( sa ) - , and ethylene - responsive signalling pathways are tightly associated with the resistance to biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens ( robert - seilaniantz et al. , 2007 ) , and are important for the response to abiotic stresses ( clarke et al. , 2009 ; brossa et al. , 2011 ; lei et al. , 2011 ) .
abscisic acid ( aba ) positively regulates the response to several abiotic stresses , e.g. drought and osmotic stresses , by promoting the closure of stomata ( radin , 1984 ; fujita et al. , 2005 ) .
arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing several aba - induced bzip transcription factors , such as aba - responsive element ( abre ) binding protein ( areb ) and abre binding factor ( abf ) , exhibited tolerance to drought and / or osmotic stresses ( fujita et al. , 2005 , 2009 ; yoshida et al. , 2010 ) .
in addition to abiotic stress response , aba also controls various developmental processes , including seed germination , root elongation , leaf senescence , and seed development ( de smet et al. , 2006 ; nakashima et al. , 2013 ) .
these phytohormone signalling pathways are , at least in part , regulated by specific mapk cascades .
one of the arabidopsis mapkkks , constitutive triple response1 ( ctr1 ) modulates ethylene signalling by promoting ethylene insensitive3 ( ein3 ) transcription , together with mapkk9 - mapk3 / mapk6 ( yoo and sheen , 2008 ) .
another arabidopsis mapkkk , enhanced disease resistance1 ( edr1 ) , negatively regulates the sa - dependent defence pathway .
the edr1 knockout mutant showed resistance to powdery mildew disease caused by erysiphe cichoracearum , but sa - deficient or sa signalling - related mutants completely suppressed this phenotype ( frye et al. , 2001 ) .
however , the relationship between phytohormone signalling and mapk pathways largely remains unknown .
in this study , the rice spl3 mutant , which produces spontaneous cell death lesions on its leaf blades and shows excessive accumulation of h2o2 , was analysed .
map - based cloning showed that the spl3 locus encodes a putative kinase protein , osmapkkk1 .
the spl3 mutant is strongly insensitive to aba treatment and delays leaf senescence , probably due to reduced expression of aba signalling - related genes .
in the spl3 leaves , a significant decrease of catalase activity , which functions in scavenging h2o2 in the cells , was found .
these spl3 data provide insights into the molecular function of spl3 in aba - responsive signalling in plants .
materials and methods plant materials and growth conditions the spl3 mutant was originally generated by gamma - ray irradiation of a japanese japonica rice cultivar ' norin8 ' ( yoshimura et al. , 1997 ) .
the wild - type norin8 and spl3 mutant were grown in the paddy field ( natural long day conditions at 37degrees n latitude , suwon , korea ) or in the growth chambers .
the chamber experiments were performed under short day ( sd ) conditions [ 10 - h light with normal intensity ( 300 mumol m - 2 sec - 1 ) at 30 degreesc and 14 - h dark at 20 degreesc ] , or continuous light with 30 degreesc for 10h and 20 degreesc for 14h .
for phenotypic characterization and map - based cloning of spl3 mutant , all the plants were grown in the paddy field .
detection of ros the detection of ros accumulation was conducted as previously described ( sakuraba et al. , 2013 ) .
to determine hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) and superoxide anion ( o2 - ) , leaf samples of 1 - month - old plants grown in the growth chamber under sd or continuous light conditions were transferred in dab staining solution containing 0.1 % 3,3 ' - diaminobenzidine or in nitroblue tetrazolium ( nbt ) staining solution including 0.05 % nitroblue tetrazolium chloride in 50mm sodium phosphate buffer , and incubated for 6h with gentle shaking .
after staining , chlorophyll was completely removed by incubation with 90 % ethanol at 80 degreesc .
h2o2 accumulation was also measured using the amplex red hydrogen peroxide / peroxidase assay kit ( life technologies , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
genetic analysis and map - based cloning for genetic analysis , an f2 population was developed from crossing between a japonica - type spl3 mutant and korean tongil - type cultivar milyang23 , which was derived from hybridization of indica x japonica rice cultivars .
the spl3 locus was previously mapped to the short arm of chromosome 3 ( yoshimura et al. , 1997 ) .
in this study , a mapping population of 1800 f2 individuals from the cross between spl3 and milyang23 was used for locating and fine mapping of the spl3 locus .
genomic dna was extracted from young leaves of each f2 individual line .
the newly designed markers using milyang23 sequence data ( lim et al. , 2014 ) were used to narrow down the genomic region of spl3 locus on chromosome 3 ; these markers included sequence - tagged - site ( sts ) markers ( supplementary table s1 at jxb online ) .
stress treatments stress treatments were performed as described ( kim et al. , 2003 ) .
two - week - old wild - type ( wt ) seedlings ( cv. norin8 ) were treated with dehydration , nacl ( 150mm ) , mannitol ( 500mm ) , sa ( 100 mum ) , methyl jasmonate [ meja ( 100 mum )] , 1 - aminocyclo - propane - 1 - carboxylic acid [ acc ( 10mm )] , and different concentrations of aba ( 5 - 50 mum ) .
to check the senescence phenotype of wt and spl3 leaves under treatments of four senescence - promoting phytohormones ( aba , acc , sa , and meja ) , detached leaf discs from 1 - month - old plants were floated on the 3mm mes ( ph 5.8 ) buffer supplemented with 50 mum aba , 10mm acc , 100 mum sa , and 100 mum meja and incubated for 4 d under continuous light conditions .
to check the phenotype under drought and osmotic stresses , wt and spl3 plants were grown under ld conditions for 2 month .
for drought stress treatment , plants were dehydrated for 5 d at 25 degreesc and 50 % humidity , and then rehydrated again for investigating the recovery of wilting phenotype .
for the salt stress assay , plants were transferred to 500mm mannitol and incubated for 5 d. chlorophyll measurement for the measurement of total chlorophyll ( chl ) concentration , photosynthetic pigments were extracted from the leaf tissues with 80 % ice - cold acetone .
chl concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry as described previously ( porra et al. , 1989 ) .
sds - page and immunoblot analysis total protein extracts were prepared from the leaf tissues .
to extract total proteins , leaf tissues of rice grown in the paddy field were ground in liquid nitrogen and 10mg aliquots were homogenized with 100 mul of sample buffer ( 50mm tris , ph 6.8 ; 2mm edta ; 10 % glycerol ; 2 % sds ; and 6 % 2 - mercaptoethanol ) .
homogenates were centrifuged at 10 000 xg for 3min , and supernatants were denatured at 80 degreesc for 5min .
four microlitres of each sample was subjected to 12 % ( w / v ) sds - page and resolved proteins were electroblotted onto a hybond - p membrane ( ge healthcare , usa ) .
antibodies against the photosystem proteins lhcb1 , lhcb2 , lhcb4 , lhca1 , lhca2 , and d1 ( agrisera , sweden ) were used for immunoblot analysis .
the level of each protein was examined using the ecl system ( westsave kit , abfrontier , korea ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
measurement of ion leakage rates ion leakage rates were measured as described previously ( lee et al. , 2015 ) .
briefly , membrane leakage was determined by the amount of electrolytes ( or ions ) leaking from rice leaf discs ( 1cm2 ) .
three leaf discs from each treatment were immersed in 6ml of 0.4m mannitol at room temperature with gentle shaking for 3h , and initial conductivity of the solution was measured with a conductivity meter ( con 6 meter , lamotte co. , usa ) .
total conductivity was determined after sample incubation at 85 degreesc for 20min .
ion leakage rate is expressed as the percentage of initial conductivity divided by the total conductivity .
stomatal aperture analysis the stomatal aperture of abaxial leaf epidermal strips was analysed as previously described ( xing et al. 2007 ) with minor modifications .
leaf discs from 3 - week - old plants grown under sd conditions were incubated in 3mm mes buffer ( ph 6.15 ) containing 50mm kcl ( mes - kcl ) for 2h under light ( 22 degreesc ) to open stomata .
leaf discs were then transferred to the mes - kcl buffer containing 5 mum aba for 4h .
stomatal cells were observed by field - emission scanning electron microscopy ( auriga , carl zeiss , germany ) .
complementation test for complementation of the spl3 mutation , a full - length cdna of spl3 was ligated into the pmdc32 gateway binary vector containing the 35s promoter ( curtis and grossniklaus , 2003 ) .
the 35s : spl3 construct in the pmdc32 plasmid was introduced into the calli generated from the mature embryos of spl3 mutant seeds by agrobacterium ( strain lba4404 ) - mediated transformation ( jeon et al. , 2000 ) .
transformants were confirmed by pcr using the specific primers listed in supplementary table s1 at jxb online .
reverse transcription - quantitative real - time pcr analysis total rna was extracted from the 4 - week - old plants with the mg total rna extraction kit ( macrogen , korea ) , including dnase i treatment step for removing the possible contamination of genomic dnas .
first - strand cdnas were synthesized with 2 mug of total rna in a 25 microl volume using m - mlv reverse transcriptase and oligo ( dt ) 15 primer .
the 20 microl of reverse transcription ( rt ) - quantitative real - time pcr ( qpcr ) mixture contained 2 microl of the rt mixture , 10 microl of 2x gotar pcr mix ( roche ) , and 0.25 microl of the primers .
the qpcr was performed on the light cycler 2.0 ( roche diagnostics , germany ) .
the qpcr conditions were 95 degreesc for 2min , followed by 45 cycles at 95 degreesc for 5 s , 59 degreesc for 15 s , and 72 degreesc for 10 s. the relative expression of each gene was calculated using the 2 - incrementincrementc t methods ( livak and schmittgen , 2001 ) .
the primers used for qpcr are listed in supplementary table s1 at jxb online .
catalase assay catalase activity in the rice leaves was analysed using the sigma catalase assay kit ( sigma - aldrich , usa ) following the manufacturer 's instructions .
results phenotypic characterization of the spl3 mutant a single recessive spl3 mutant in rice was isolated from the m2 population of japonica cultivar ' norin8 ' irradiated with gamma rays ( yoshimura et al. , 1997 ) .
first , the spl3 phenotype was examined in the paddy field .
at early tillering stage [ 50 d after seeding ( das )] , the phenotype of spl3 mutant appeared to be quite similar to that of the wt , without any lesion development ( fig. 1 , left panels ) .
at late - tillering stage ( 90 das ) , lesions gradually appeared , mainly in the old leaves and from the tip region ( supplementary fig. s1 at jxb online ) , with only a few in young leaves ( fig. 1 , middle panels ) .
at heading stage ( 120 das ) , lesion formation became more severe and finally the dark - brown spots expanded to all leaves including the flag leaf ( fig. 1 , right panel ) .
interestingly , the growth of spl3 mutant ( plant height ) became clearly retarded as the lesion mimic phenotype appeared ( fig. 1 ; supplementary fig. s2 at jxb online ) , which led to a decrease of several agronomic traits , especially spikelet fertility and panicle length ( supplementary fig. s3 at jxb online ) .
these results indicate that lesion formation in spl3 mutant is closely related with the leaf age , between late - tillering and heading stages. fig. 1. phenotypic characterization of the spl3 mutant .

excessive accumulation of ros causes development of cell death lesions in leaf blades to examine the effect of the diurnal light - dark cycle on lesion formation in the spl3 mutant , wt ( cv .
norin8 ) and spl3 mutant were grown in the growth chamber ( 300 mumol m - 2 s - 1 ) under sd ; 10 - h light , 30 degreesc / 14 - h dark , 20 degreesc ) or continuous light ( cl ) .
under sd , the spl3 mutant developed no lesions on the leaves even after 30 das ( fig. 2a ) .
under cl conditions , however , reddish spots with some necrotic lesions appeared in the spl3 leaves ( fig. 2a ). fig. 2. ros accumulation in the spl3 leaf blades .
( a ) wt and spl3 mutant were grown under sd or cl conditions at 30 degreesc for 1 month in the growth chamber .
( b , c ) the accumulation of h2o2 ) and o2 - were detected by staining with 3,3 ' - diaminobenzidine ( dab ) ( b ) and nbt ( c ) , respectively .
( d , e ) h2o2 quantification was performed using amplex red .
2nd leaves from 30 - das wt and spl3 mutant grown under sd and cl conditions ( d ) , and 1st to 4th leaves from the main culm of 90 - das wt and spl3 mutant grown in the paddy field ( e ) .
mean and standard deviation values were obtained from more than three biological replicates .
these experiments were repeated three times with similar results .
( d , e ) statistical analysis using student 's t - test , * p < 0.05 ; ** p < 0.01 .
excessive accumulation of ros causes leaf variegation and / or necrotic lesions in some variegated - leaf mutants in rice ( li et al. , 2010 ; han et al. , 2012 ; sakuraba et al. , 2013 ) .
thus , the levels of two kinds of ros , o2 - and h2o2 , were examined in the spl3 leaves grown under sd or cl conditions , using two staining methods : nbt for o2 - and dab for h2o2 .
under sd , the o2 - and h2o2 levels in the spl3 leaves were almost the same as those of the wt. however , o2 - and h2o2 accumulated in the spl3 leaves under cl compared with the wt leaves ( fig. 2b , c ) .
h2o2 production under sd and cl conditions was also confirmed by quantification using the hydrogen peroxide / peroxidase assay kit .
consistent with the results of dab staining ( fig. 2b ) , the spl3 leaves had significantly higher h2o2 levels under cl conditions ( fig. 2d ) .
furthermore , it was found that at 90 das , the spl3 leaves had much higher h2o2 levels than the wt leaves , especially in the 3rd and 4th leaves , which had many lesions ( fig. 2e ) .
map - based cloning of spl3 to isolate the spl3 gene , a map - based cloning was performed using 1771 f2 plants that were generated from a cross of spl3 ( japonica ) mutant and milyang23 ( a tongil - type indica / japonica hybrid cultivar ) .
the spl3 locus was mapped to a 415 - kb interval between rm14395 and rm14423 on chromosome 3 ( fig. 3a ) .
using two sts and one simple sequence repeat ( ssr ) markers , the spl3 locus was further delimited to a 161.2 - kb interval between s3015.2 and ssr - 5 , in the bac clones ac099401 and ac119797 ( genbank accession number ) ( fig. 3b ) .
in this genomic region , 16 candidates were found based on the rice functional genomic expression database of the salk institute genomic analysis laboratory ( http :// signal.salk.edu / cgi - bin / ricege ) .
sixteen expressed genes were cloned by rt - pcr or genomic pcr .
as a result , a 1 - bp deletion was identified in the first exon of a candidate gene , loc _ os03g06410 ( fig. 3c , d ) , resulting in a frameshift mutation ( supplementary fig. s1 at jxb online ) that leads to premature translational termination ( supplementary fig. s4 at jxb online ) .
loc _ os03g06410 encodes a putative mapkkk , which is orthologous to atedr1 ( arabidopsis thaliana enhanced disease resistance1 ; frye et al. , 2001 ) .
based on this orthology , the locus had been named osedr1 ( kim et al. , 2003 ; shen et al. , 2011 ) , although the same group renamed it osacdr1 ( oryza sativa accelerated cell death and resistance1 ) because the function of osedr1 was considerably different from that of atedr1 ( kim et al. , 2009a ) .
it was also named osmapkkk1 ( rao et al. , 2010 ) .
spl3 / osedr1 / osacdr1 / osmapkkk1 comprises 1018 amino acids with a protein kinase domain at the c - terminal region , which was abrogated in the spl3 allele ( supplementary fig. s3 at jxb online ). fig. 3. map - based cloning of the spl3 locus .
( a ) genetic mapping of the spl3 locus .
the spl3 locus was initially narrowed down to the region between two ssr markers , rm14395 and rm14423 , on the short arm of chromosome 3 .
the pcr primer sequences of ssr and sts markers are listed in supplementary table s1 at jxb online .
( b , c ) fine physical mapping of the spl3 locus .
the spl3 locus region was narrowed down to a 161.2 - kb interval between s3015.2 and ssr - 5 markers using six recombinants in f2 individuals .
( d ) the spl3 gene structure .
thirteen exons and 11 introns are designated by black rectangles and lines , respectively ; a 1 - bp deletion occurs in the 1st exon , leading to a frameshift mutation .
to confirm that the mutation in spl3 caused the spl3 phenotype , a complementation test was performed .
as a result , five independent transgenic lines did not show any lesion mimic phenotype at 60 das , when spots developed clearly on the mature leaves of spl3 mutant ( supplementary fig. s5 at jxb online ) .
these results indicate that the 1 - bp deletion in the exon 1 of osmapkkk1 is responsible for the spl3 mutation .
the transcript accumulation of spl3 is dependent on leaf age to examine spl3 function , spl3 expression was examined in various tissues of 2 - week - old wt plants by rt - qpcr .
spl3 transcripts accumulated the most in the leaf sheath and leaf blade ( supplementary fig. s6a at jxb online ) .
lesions in spl3 mutant are predominant in the tip area of older leaf blades both in the field and in growth chamber conditions ( figs 1 and 2 ; supplementary fig. s1 ) .
thus , spl3 expression was subsequently examined in two different sections ( top and middle ) of three different stages of leaf blades ( flag , 2nd , and 3rd leaves ) .
in all leaves , spl3 transcript levels were significantly lower in the top area , especially in flag leaves ( supplementary fig. s6b ) .
together , these data indicate that spl3 has an important role in protecting young leaves from the generation of necrotic lesions .
aba - responsive signalling is impaired in the spl3 mutant spl3 expression was shown to be rapidly and transiently regulated by diverse environmental stresses over a short timeframe of 30 - 120min ( kim et al. , 2003 ) .
to further study the spl3 function under abiotic stresses , the time - course expression of spl3 was examined for 24h in response to three abiotic stresses ( drought , mannitol , and salt ) and four hormones ( aba , ethylene , sa , and ja ) ( supplementary fig. s7 at jxb online ) .
spl3 transcript levels were found to decrease rapidly in response to aba , sa , and meja , and decrease slowly in response to ethylene ( acc ) and three abiotic stresses , suggesting that spl3 has an important role in both hormone - responsive and abiotic stress - responsive signalling .
thus , the response of spl3 mutant to senescence - promoting hormones , including aba , ethylene , sa , and meja ( kusaba et al. , 2013 ) , was examined .
it was found that the spl3 mutant showed a stay - green phenotype under aba - and acc - induced senescence conditions , but no significant phenotypic difference under sa - and meja - induced senescence conditions ( supplementary fig. s8 at jxb online ) , indicating that both aba and ethylene signalling pathways were impaired in the spl3 leaves .
next , the senescence phenotype of spl3 mutant in the field was checked .
during the pre - senescent phase , the leaf colour of the spl3 mutant was almost the same as that of the wt ( fig. 1 ) .
at the senescent phase [ 40 d after heading ( dah )] , however , the spl3 leaves exhibited a strong stay - green phenotype ( fig. 4a ) , even though the heading date of spl3 mutant was the same as that of the wt ( supplementary fig. s9 at jxb online ) .
consistent with this , chl and photosynthesis - related proteins ( d1 , lhcb1 , lhcb2 , lhcb4 , lhca1 , lhca2 , and rbcl ) were retained in the spl3 leaves ( fig. 4b , c ) .
in parallel , the fv / fm ratio , and the photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem ii , were also retained in the spl3 leaves compared with the wt ( fig. 4d ) .
the expression of three typical senescence - associated genes ( sags ) was also investigated for chl catabolism : staygreen ( sgr ; park et al. , 2007 ) , non - yellow colouring1 ( nyc1 ; kusaba et al. , 2007 ) , and osnap ( liang et al. , 2014 ) .
the transcript levels of these three sags were down - regulated in the spl3 mutant at 40 das compared with the wt ( fig. 4e ). fig. 4. the spl3 mutant shows a stay - green phenotype during leaf senescence .

( b - d ) changes of total chl levels ( b ) , chloroplast protein levels ( c ) , and fv / fm ratios ( d ) in wt and spl3 mutant at 0 and 40 dah .
( e ) transcript levels of the three sag genes in the wt and spl3 mutant at 0 and 40 dah were measured by rt - qpcr .
transcript levels of osnap , nyc1 , and sgr were normalized to the transcript levels of osubq5 .
( f - h ) the spl3 leaves stay green during dark - induced senescence .
changes of visible phenotype ( f ) , total chl levels ( g ) , and ion leakage rates ( h ) in the wt and spl3 mutant before and after 4 ddi were examined .
( g , h ) black , white , and grey bars indicate 0 , 4 , and 6 ddi , respectively .
statistical analysis using student 's t - test , * p < 0.05 ; ** p < 0.01 .
mean and standard deviation values were obtained from more than three biological replicates .
these experiments were repeated twice with similar results .
the stay - green phenotype of the spl3 mutant was also confirmed during dark - induced senescence .
after 4 d of dark incubation ( 4 ddi ) , the leaf discs of the wt turned completely yellow , while those of the spl3 mutant remained green ( fig. 4f ) , with higher chl levels ( fig. 4g ) and lower ion leakage rates ( fig. 4h ) .
furthermore , spl3 expression increased during both natural and dark - induced senescence ( supplementary fig. s10 at jxb online ) .
aba signalling - related phenotype of the spl3 mutant next , it was tested whether the spl3 mutant shows altered phenotypes for aba - related processes .
the root phenotype of spl3 mutant in aba - containing media ( fig. 5a - c ) was investigated .
the wt showed remarkably retarded root development in the presence of aba ; however , the spl3 mutant produced longer primary roots and more adventitious roots than the wt. next , the phenotype of the spl3 mutant was examined under abiotic stress conditions , such as drought and osmotic stresses .
during 5 d of dehydration , the spl3 mutant wilted much earlier than the wt and did not recover after rehydration ( fig. 5d , e ) .
similarly , the spl3 mutant was more sensitive to osmotic stress ( 500mm mannitol ) ( supplementary fig. s11 at jxb online ) .
the stomata in the spl3 leaf surfaces was also observed , which revealed that stomatal closure in the spl3 mutant was nearly insensitive to aba treatment ( fig. 5f , g ) .
in contrast to these aba - related phenotypes , which differed between the wt and spl3 mutant , the seed germination rate did not differ between the wt and spl3 ( supplementary fig. s12 at jxb online ) .
taken together , these data indicate that spl3 is involved in some , but not all aba - responsive pathways. fig. 5. the spl3 mutant is less responsive to exogenous aba and hypersensitive to drought stress .
( a ) effect of different concentrations of aba ( 0 , 5 , and 10 mum ) on root growth is significantly reduced in the spl3 mutant ( each square = 1.8x1.8cm2 ) .
( b , c ) the root length ( b ) and number of adventitious roots ( c ) in 8 - d - old plants were measured .
( d , e ) the spl3 mutant shows a sensitive phenotype to drought stress .

altered expression of aba signalling - related genes in the spl3 mutant because of aba insensitivity in root development , leaf senescence , and abiotic stresses , it was hypothesized that aba - responsive signalling is severely compromised in the spl3 mutant .
to examine this , the expression levels of the aba signalling - associated genes were compared between the wt and spl3 mutant after 6h of aba treatment .
based on previous reports of aba signalling in rice ( zhou et al. , 2008 ; park et al. , 2010 ; tseng et al. , 2013 ) , the aba signalling - associated genes involved in seed germination ( osabi1 , osabi3 , osabi4 , and osdsg1 ) , seed germination and development ( abi5 ) , abiotic stress responses ( osareb1 , osbzip23 , ossapk8 , and ossapk9 ) , and root development ( ossapk6 , osreprp , and osdsr1 ) were investigated .
among them , several aba - associated genes , including abi1 , abi4 , abi5 , osbzip23 , and ossapk9 , ossapk6 , and osreprp were significantly down - regulated in the spl3 mutant after aba treatment ( fig. 6 ) .
thus , it is probable that the strong repression of aba signalling - related genes leads to the aba insensitivity in the spl3 mutant. by contrast , the expression of osabi3 ( fig. 6b ) and osdsg1 ( fig. 6d ) , key regulators of seed germination in rice ( park et al. , 2010 ) , were not down - regulated in the spl3 mutant. fig. 6. expression of aba signalling - related genes in the spl3 mutant after aba treatment .
the 10 - d - old wt and spl3 seedlings were transferred to ms solution containing 10 mum aba and were sampled after 6h for rt - qpcr analysis .
rt - qpcr was used to measure the relative transcript levels of ( a ) osabi1 , ( b ) osabi3 , ( c ) osabi4 , ( d ) osdsg1 , ( e ) osabi5 , ( f ) osareb1 , ( g ) osbzip23 , ( h ) ossapk8 , ( i ) ossapk9 , ( j ) ossapk6 , ( k ) osreprp2.1 , and ( l ) osdsr1 and transcript levels were normalized to the transcript levels of osubq5 .
mean and standard deviation values were obtained from more than three biological replicates .
these experiments were repeated twice with similar results .

in parallel , aba signalling - associated genes ( osabi1 , osabi5 , osbzip23 , and ossapk9 ) were also found to be down - regulated in the spl3 mutant during natural senescence ( supplementary fig. s13 at jxb online ) , suggesting that the down - regulation of these genes , in addition to osnap ( fig. 4e ) , is also associated with delayed senescence of spl3 leaves .
a previous study reported that the expression levels of genes related to ethylene biosynthesis were severely suppressed in the knockout mutant of osedr1 ( shen et al. , 2011 ) .
during senescence , two ethylene - signalling - related sags , ethylene insensitive2 ( ein2 ) and ein3 , were found to be down - regulated in the spl3 mutant , as were two ethylene biosynthetic genes , acc synthase1 ( acs1 ) and acs2 ( supplementary fig. s14 at jxb online ) , suggesting that the impairment of both aba - and ethylene - responsive signalling pathways results in the delayed leaf senescence phenotype of the spl3 mutant .
aba insensitivity in the spl3 mutant leads to down - regulation of catalase expression catalase ( cat ) scavenges h2o2 , and its physiological functions have been widely studied in arabidopsis ( mhamdi et al. , 2010 ) .
in arabidopsis , aba treatment induces expression of the three cat genes ( xing et al. , 2007 ) .
because aba signalling is compromised in the spl3 mutant ( figs 4 , 6 ) , it was next tested whether gene expression and enzymatic activity of catalases are also significantly down - regulated in the spl3 mutant .
to this end , the expression levels of rice catalase genes was investigated in the spl3 mutant .
rice has three cat homologues , oscata , oscatb , and oscatc ( iwamoto et al. , 2000 ; mhamdi et al. , 2010 ) .
the three oscat genes were found to be significantly up - regulated in the wt , in response to aba treatment ( fig. 7a , c ) , similar to arabidopsis catalases ( xing et al. , 2007 ) .
among these three rice catalases , oscata and oscatc mrna levels were significantly down - regulated compared with the wt ( fig. 7a , c ) , whereas oscatb mrna levels were not altered in the spl3 mutant after aba treatment ( fig. 7b ) .
furthermore , the cat activities of spl3 and wt leaves were compared , and the spl3 leaves were found to have significantly lower cat activity than the wt ( fig. 7d ). fig. 7. catalase activity is reduced in the spl3 mutant after aba treatment .
( a - c ) the leaf discs were taken from the 2nd leaves of 1 - month - old wt and spl3 plants grown under ld conditions and were treated with 20 mum aba for 12h , and then were sampled for rt - qpcr .
rt - qpcr was used to measure the relative transcript levels of oscata ( a ) , oscatb ( b ) , and oscatc ( c ) , which were normalized to the transcript levels of osubq5 .

discussion by map - based cloning , the spl3 locus was found to encode osmapkkk1 , a rice homologue of arabidopsis edr1 ( kim et al. , 2003 ) .
thus , it was also termed osedr1 ( kim et al. , 2003 ; shen et al. , 2011 ) .
previous studies of osedr1 mainly focused on its function in the biotic stress - responsive pathway ; transgenic rice plants overexpressing osedr1 ( osedr1 - ox ) displayed spontaneous hypersensitive response - like spots on the mature leaves , and concurrent up - regulation of defence - related genes and accumulation of phenolic compounds and phytoalexins .
as a result , the osedr1 - ox plants gained enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungal disease magnaporthe grisea ( kim et al. , 2009a ) .
moreover , another group reported that osedr1 knockout plants have enhanced resistance to the bacterial blight disease xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryza .
this resistance was closely associated with increased accumulation of sa and ja and thus up - regulation of sa - and ja - associated gene expression , in parallel with decreased accumulation of the direct ethylene precursor acc and down - regulation of ethylene - related gene expression ( shen et al. , 2011 ) .
finally , the authors concluded that osedr1 is not a functional homologue of atedr1 because of the different responses to pathogen attacks ( frye et al. , 2001 ; tang et al. , 2005 ) .
here it is shown that spl3 / osmapkkk1 / osedr1 functions as a transducer of aba - responsive signalling and that the spl3 mutant showed strong aba insensitivity , leading to several interesting phenotypes , such as delayed leaf senescence ( fig. 4 ; supplementary fig. s15 at jxb online ) .
spl3 regulates several aba - responsive signalling pathways in rice in this study , it was found that the spl3 mutant was insensitive to aba in several aba - responsive processes .
for example , in aba - containing media , spl3 mutant produced longer primary roots and more adventitious roots than the wt ( fig. 5a - c ) , and showed hypersensitivity to drought ( fig. 5d , e ) and osmotic stresses ( supplementary fig. s11 ) .
furthermore , stomatal closure in the spl3 leaves was insensitive to aba treatment ( fig. 5f , g ) .
all these results demonstrate that spl3 is involved in aba signal transduction .
it was also found that many aba signalling - associated genes were significantly down - regulated in the spl3 leaves ( fig. 6 ) .
among these genes , the physiological functions of several genes have been studied using rice overexpressing and / or antisense transgenic lines .
osabi5 knockdown lines showed low spikelet fertility because of aberrant pollen development ( zou et al. , 2008 ) .
similarly , the spl3 mutant showed low spikelet fertility ( supplementary fig. s2 ) and osabi5 was strongly down - regulated in the spl3 leaves in response to aba treatment ( fig. 6e ) , suggesting that osabi5 may be one of the important genes downstream of spl3 in seed maturation .
osbzip23 ( fig. 6g ) is considered a functional homologue of arabidopsis areb genes , based on physiological and phylogenetic studies ( xiang et al. , 2008 ) .
the transgenic lines overexpressing osbzip23 showed tolerance to drought and high salinity stresses , and the t - dna - insertion knockout lines showed sensitive phenotypes ( xiang et al. , 2008 ) .
ossapk9 ( fig. 6i ) , a functional homologue of arabidopsis snrk2 ( kobayashi et al. , 2005 ) , was also significantly down - regulated in the spl3 leaves .
the arabidopsis snrk2 proteins participate in aba signal transduction by directly phosphorylating aba - responsive element ( abre ) - binding factors , including areb1 ( fujita et al. , 2009 ) .
similarly , ossapk9 phosphorylates one of the rice areb homologues , trab1 ( kobayashi et al. , 2005 ) .
thus , it appears that the hypersensitivity of the spl3 mutant to drought and osmotic stresses may result from the down - regulation of osbzip23 and ossapk9 .
it was also found that osreprp2.1 , a positive regulator of aba - dependent root growth inhibition ( tseng et al. , 2013 ) , was substantially reduced in the spl3 mutant ( fig. 6k ) , which probably contributes to the insensitivity of spl3 roots to aba - mediated root growth inhibition ( fig. 5a - c ) .
however , the spl3 seeds did not show higher germination rates in the presence of aba , compared with the wt ( supplementary fig. s12 ) , indicating that spl3 is involved in some , but not all of the aba - responsive pathways , acting by indirectly regulating several aba signalling - associated genes ( supplementary fig. s15 ) .
notably , spl3 expression was down - regulated in response to aba treatment ( supplementary fig. s7 ) , suggesting that spl3 contributes only to activating the early phase of aba signalling when spl3 transcripts are abundant .
spl3 regulates ros production via the aba signalling pathway in addition , it was found that this strong aba insensitivity of the spl3 mutant leads to the differential expression of oscat genes ; expression of oscata and oscatc is down - regulated in the spl3 mutant .
catalases in plants can be classified into three classes by organ / tissue specificity and expression pattern ( willekens et al. , 1995 ; mhamdi et al. , 2010 ) .
class i cats are highly expressed in photosynthetic tissues while class ii catalases in vascular tissues , and class iii catalases in seeds and reproductive tissues ( mhamdi et al. , 2010 ) .
among the three oscats , oscatc and oscata are classified class i and class ii , respectively ( mhamdi et al. 2010 ) .
in arabidopsis , the class i catalase cat2 mutant showed a severe necrotic lesion phenotype under long day conditions ( queval et al. , 2007 ) .
although the class ii catalase cat1 mutant did not show a necrotic phenotype , a cat1 cat2 double mutant showed a much more severe lesion phenotype than the cat1 single mutant ( mhamdi et al. , 2010 ) , indicating that both cat1 and cat2 contribute to scavenging h2o2 in the leaves .
thus , it is possible that down - regulation of oscata and oscatc in the spl3 mutant causes increased concentration of ros in the mature leaves ( fig. 2 ) , which leads to cell - death lesion formation around the heading stage ( fig. 1 ) .
similar to the arabidopsis cat2 mutant , the expressivity of the spl3 mutation is somewhat photoperiodic - dependent ; under cl conditions , the lesion mimic phenotype of the spl3 mutant is very severe compared with the mutant grown under sds ( fig. 2 ) .
taking these results together , it was concluded that the mrna levels of two oscat genes ( oscata and oscatc ) and catalase activity in the spl3 leaves were greatly suppressed , which probably leads to accumulation of excessive h2o2 and formation of lesions on the spl3 leaves ( supplementary fig. s15 ) .
similar to the three cat genes in arabidopsis , the three oscat genes were also induced by aba treatment ( fig. 7 ) .
thus , it seems that down - regulation of oscata and oscatc in the spl3 mutant is caused by an impairment of aba signalling .
in arabidopsis , the mapkk1 - mapk6 signalling cascade regulates metabolism of h2o2 scavenging by promoting cat1 expression ( xing et al. , 2008 ) , similar to spl3 function .
a mutant of mekk1 , one of the arabidopsis mapkkks , accumulates high levels of ros and develops a local lesion mimic phenotype ( teige et al. , 2004 ) .
furthermore , ning et al .
( 2010 ) reported that a mutant of drought - hypersensitive mutant1 ( dsm1 ) , one of the osmapkkks , accumulates excessive amounts of h2o2 under methyl viologen ( mv ) - induced oxidative stress , which is closely associated with down - regulation of two peroxidase genes , pox22.3 and pox8.1 .
these results indicate that several mapk cascades play critical roles in controlling h2o2 scavenging in plants .
to the authors' knowledge , either osmapks or osmapkks that act downstream of spl3 / osmapkkk1 and regulate oscat expression have not yet been identified , although several mapk genes , such as osmapk5 , osmapk12 , osmapk1 , and osmapkk2 , are induced by aba treatment ( xiong and yang , 2003 ; you et al. , 2007 ) .
spl3 promotes aba and ethylene signalling pathways in leaf senescence it was also found that the spl3 mutant showed delayed leaf yellowing during both natural and dark - induced senescence ( fig. 5 ) .
concurrently , spl3 expression increased during senescence ( supplementary fig. s10 ) , indicating that spl3 contributes to promoting leaf senescence .
in arabidopsis , a few mapk components have been revealed to be involved in the leaf senescence .
knockout mutants of mapkk9 and mapk6 , which are known to form a mapk cascade together , showed commonly delayed senescence , indicating that the mapkk9 - mapk6 cascade definitely promotes leaf senescence ( zhou et al. , 2009 ) .
mapk6 accelerates sa - mediated leaf senescence by promoting the activity of nonexpressor of pathogenesis - related gene 1 ( npr1 ) , which acts as a major component of sa - responsive signalling and as an inducer of leaf senescence ( ogawa et al. , 2005 ; chai et al. , 2014 ) .
arabidopsis edr1 also functions in leaf senescence ; the leaves of the edr1 mutant senesce early during ethylene - induced leaf senescence ( frye et al. , 2001 ; tang and innes , 2002 ) .
recently , matsuoka et al .
( 2015 ) reported that arabidopsis mapkkk18 is also involved in leaf senescence , because the loss - of - function mutant of mapkkk18 showed a delayed senescence phenotype ( matsuoka et al. , 2015 ) , indicating that mapkkk18 positively regulates leaf senescence , similar to spl3 .
in the present study , it has been revealed how spl3 exerts its function in the promotion of leaf senescence .
when the rice plants enter the senescence phase , several ethylene - and aba - associated genes are down - regulated in the spl3 mutant ( supplementary figs. s13 and s14 ) , which probably leads to delaying leaf yellowing during natural and dark - induced senescence ( fig. 4 ) .
aba and ethylene promote leaf yellowing ( gepstein and thimann , 1981 ; nooden , 1988 ) , and arabidopsis mutants or transgenic plants overexpressing genes that are related to aba or ethylene signalling exhibited different senescence phenotypes ( kusaba et al. , 2013 ) .
in this study , it was found that osabi5 , osein2 , and osein3 were down - regulated in the spl3 mutant during senescence ( supplementary figs s13 and s14 ) .
although previous work reported that ethylene synthesis is impaired in the osedr1 mutant ( shen et al. , 2011 ) , the finding that osein2 and osein3 are down - regulated in the spl3 mutant indicates that both ethylene - synthesis and - signalling pathways are impaired in the spl3 mutant during senescence .
arabidopsis homologues of these three genes were previously identified as senescence - promoting transcription factors .
arabidopsis abi5 and ein3 directly promote the expression of oresara1 ( ore1 ; kim et al. , 2014 ; sakuraba et al. , 2014 ) , which encodes a key senescence - promoting nac transcription factor ( kim et al. , 2009b ) .
ein2 also activates ore1 expression by repressing the expression of mir164 , which cleaves the ore1 mrna ; ein2 also functions by a mir164 - independent pathway ( kim et al. , 2009b ; li et al. , 2013 ) .
furthermore , ein3 also directly promotes the expression of nap ( kim et al. , 2014 ) , another key senescence - promoting nac transcription factor ( guo and gan , 2006 ) .
the rice homologue osnap was found to be down - regulated in the spl3 mutant during senescence ( fig. 4e ) .
osnap is induced by aba treatment and directly activates aba - responsive genes ( chen et al. , 2014 ; liang et al. , 2014 ) , similar to atnap function ( zhang and gan , 2012 ; yang et al. , 2014 ) .
thus , it is probable that down - regulation of osnap expression in the spl3 mutant was caused by an impairment of both aba - and ethylene - responsive signalling pathways .
here , it has been shown that spl3 positively regulates the aba - responsive signalling pathway , which affects several important processes , including root elongation , abiotic stress responses , stomatal closure , and leaf senescence ( figs 4 and 5 ; supplementary fig. s15 ) .
spl3 indirectly promotes aba and ethylene signalling ( fig. 6 ; supplementary figs s13 and 14 ) , while suppressing both sa - and ja - associated defence signalling ( kim et al. 2009a ; shen et al. , 2011 ) .
thus , spl3 has a vital role in the crosstalk among important phytohormone signalling - associated processes , such as abiotic stress signalling , leaf senescence , and defence against pathogens .
because spl3 is one of the osmapkkks ( kim et al. , 2003 ) , spl3 likely regulates specific mapkks and mapks in the ethylene and aba signalling pathways .
large - scale interactome analysis between osmapkkks and osmapkks will be necessary to reveal the spl3 - dependent mapk cascade , as described in the previous study of osmapkks and osmapks ( singh et al. , 2012 ) .

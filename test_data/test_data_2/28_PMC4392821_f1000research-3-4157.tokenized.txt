neisseria meningitidis is a major cause of bacterial meningitis and a considerable health problem in the 25 countries of the ' african meningitis belt ' that extends from senegal in west africa to ethiopia in the east .
approximately 80 % of cases of meningococcal meningitis in africa have been caused by strains belonging to capsular serogroup a. after the introduction of a serogroup a conjugate polysaccharide vaccine , menafrivac ( tm ) , that began in december 2010 , the incidence of meningitis due to serogroup a has markedly declined in this region .
currently , serogroup w of n. meningitidis accounts for the majority of cases .
vaccines based on sub - capsular antigens , such as generalized modules for membrane antigens ( gmma ) , are under investigation for use in africa .
to analyse the antigenic properties of a serogroup w wave of colonisation and disease , we investigated the molecular diversity of the protein vaccine antigens pora , neisserial adhesin a ( nada ) , neisserial heparin - binding antigen ( nhba ) and factor h binding protein ( fhbp ) of 31 invasive and carriage serogroup w isolates collected as part of a longitudinal study from ghana and burkina faso between 2003 and 2009 .
we found that the isolates all expressed fhbp variant 2 id 22 or 23 , differing from each other by only one amino acid , and a single pora subtype of p1.5,2. of the isolates , 49 % had a functional nhba gene and 100 % had the nada allele 3 , which contained the insertion sequence is1301 in five isolates. of the w isolates tested , 41 % had high fhbp expression when compared with a reference serogroup b strain , known to be a high expresser of fhbp variant 2 .
our results indicate that in this collection of serogroup w isolates , there is limited antigenic diversification over time of vaccine candidate outer membrane proteins ( omp ) , thus making them promising candidates for inclusion in a protein - based vaccine against meningococcal meningitis for africa .

introduction neisseria meningitidis is a major cause of bacterial meningitis in the african meningitis belt 1. between 1993 and 2012 , nearly 1 million suspected cases were reported with 100,000 deaths , and 80 % of the cases were caused by serogroup a 2 .
following the introduction of the serogroup a polysaccharide conjugate vaccine menafrivac ( tm ) in 2010 , the incidence of group a disease decreased , but outbreaks of meningitis due to other meningococcal serogroups , in particular serogroup w , continue to occur 1 , 3 .
serogroup w was responsible for an epidemic of around 13,000 cases of meningitis in burkina faso in 2002 4 and contributed to a total of 639 deaths in 2012 in the same country 5 .
around 40 % of infected people who develop sepsis die and survivors often suffer from limb loss , cognitive dysfunction , brain damage or visual impairment .
an approach towards developing a broadly - protective meningococcal vaccine for africa is based on the use of subcapsular antigens included in gmma ( generalized modules for membrane antigens ) .
gmma are outer membrane blebs from bacteria genetically engineered to release large quantities of membrane vesicles , which are enriched in outer membrane proteins .
other strain modifications are included to increase safety and immunogenicity by the up - regulation of immunogenic antigens 6 , 7 .
gmma from genetically - engineered strains with up - regulated expression of meningococcal factor h binding protein ( fhbp ) have been shown to provide broad protection against african meningococcal isolates from different serogroups 7 .
other outer membrane antigens that have been shown to induce the production of bactericidal antibodies include pora , neisserial adhesin a ( nada ) 8 and neisserial heparin - binding antigen ( nhba ) 9 .
to help determine the potential coverage of these antigens in a gmma - based vaccine for africa , we investigated their genetic diversity in serogroup w carriage and disease isolates from burkina faso and ghana collected between 2003 and 2009 .
these two countries have suffered repeatedly from meningococcal meningitis outbreaks 4 , 10 .
focusing on isolates collected over a period of years from a defined geographic region provides the opportunity to monitor the dynamics , variation and diversity of surface - exposed antigens over time .
materials and methods neisseria meningitidis isolates the n. meningitidis isolates investigated in this study were collected in the kassena - nankana district ( knd ) of ghana and in the nouna health district ( nhd ) in the kossi region of burkina faso .

we designed primers ei and h for sequencing of the vr2 region , by aligning the conserved regions upstream and downstream of vr2 using the alignment program clustal w ( http :// www.ebi.ac.uk / tools / msa / clustalw2 /) .
pora sequences from the following strains of different serogroups were used for the alignment : mc58 ( genbank accession number ae002098.2 ) , z2491 ( al157959.1 ) , 053442 ( cp000381.1 ) , fam18 ( am421808.1 ) , m6190 ( aeqf01000026.1 ) , m13399 ( aeqg01000023.1 ) and alpha 14 ( am889136.1 ) using uniprot .
the sequences were read at the novartis vaccines - cellular microbiology and bioinformatics unit automated dna sequencing facility , siena , italy , on an abi 3730 dna analyzer .
sequences were analyzed using the simmonics program ( version 1.6 ) and chromas ( version 2.01 ) .
fhbp id , pora vr and nhba alleles were identified using the online neisseria sequence typing database ( http :// pubmlst.org / neisseria ) .
nada sample and reference sequences were exported into the mega software package ( version 5 ) 14 and aligned for the construction of phylogenetic trees using the maximum likelihood method with the general time - reversible model of evolution and correction for partial deletion of gaps ( genbank accession numbers : nada1 fj619641.1 ; nada2 gq302859.1 ; nada3 jn166979.1 ; nada4 fj619644.1 ; nada5 fj619645.1 ) .
all trees were un - rooted .
western blot analysis of fhbp expression in whole cell lysates for 17 isolates labelled with an asterisk in table 1 , western blot analysis of the fhbp expression level in whole cell samples was performed as described by seib et al .
15. the strains were sub - cultured on gc agar and incubated overnight at 37degreesc with 5 % co 2 .
a 7 ml aliquot of mueller - hinton broth ( becton dickinson , franklin lakes , nj , usa ) supplemented with 0.25 % glucose ( sigma - aldrich ) was inoculated with single colonies to an optical density at 600 nm ( od 600 ) of 0.12 - 0.16 .
the suspensions were incubated at 37degreesc with 5 % co 2 to an od 600 of 0.6 corresponding to approximately 1.8x10 8 cfu / ml ( exponential growth phase ) .
the cells from 1 ml of culture were collected by centrifugation at 17,900 g for 5 min in a microcentrifuge ( eppendorf ) , re - suspended in 100 mul phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) and heat inactivated in a water bath at 56degreesc for 1 hour .
protein concentrations of the lysates were determined using a lowry protein assay kit ( biorad laboratories , hercules , usa ) with bovine serum albumin ( sigma - aldrich ) as a standard .
the fhbp amounts were estimated by sds - page and western blot .
to 100 microl heat inactivated sample we added 100 microl sds sample buffer ( invitrogen ) and 10 microl of each sample was loaded on the gel .
recombinant fhbp ( rfhbp ) v.2 of 500 , 250 , 125 and 60 ng was used as standard .
positive and negative controls were whole cell lysates from n. meningitidis group b strain 8047 expressing fhbp v.2 and the isogenic fhbp knock - out mutant .
proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( invitrogen ) using the iblot system ( invitrogen ) .
after blocking overnight in 3 % milk powder in pbs ( merck , whitehouse station , nj , usa ) at 4degreesc , fhbp proteins were detected with 1 mug / ml anti - fhbp mouse monoclonal antibody jar31 ( igg2b ) raised against recombinant fhbp v.3 id 28 , which shows cross - reactivity against most fhbp v.2 peptides 16 .
the secondary antibody used was 1mug / ml of a horseradish peroxidase - labelled anti - mouse igg ( invitrogen ) .
the membranes were developed using supersignal westpico chemiluminescent substrate ( thermoscientific , waltham , massachusetts , usa ) according to manufacturer 's instructions , and the signal was detected with amersham hyperfilm ecl ( ge healthcare , little chalfont , uk ) .
the amount of fhbp expressed by each isolate compared to the standard rfhbp was determined by densitometric analysis for three biological replicates using the imagequant 400 gel documentation system ( ge healthcare ) .
the expression of fhbp by the test isolates was reported as percentages of the amount of fhbp expressed by bacterial cells compared to the reference strain , known to express relatively high amounts of fhbp v.2 17 .
results the serogroup w isolates studied are homogenous with respect to fhbp and pora sequence variants pora is an immunodominant antigen in n. meningitidis , but multiple subtypes exist with little cross - protection between meningococci expressing different pora subtypes .
fhbp can be divided into three antigenic variants , each of which is divided into sub - variants .
individual sequences are classified by a peptide id number .
within each variant group , cross - protection is observed 18. from the typing analysis of the fhbp and pora genes , all serogroup w isolates tested expressed fhbp variant 2 , id 22 ( isolates from burkina faso ) or 23 ( isolates from ghana ) , which differ by one amino acid , and pora subtype p1.5,2 ( figure 1 and supplemental file ) .
despite the limited number of isolates studied , these results suggest that between burkina faso and ghana , which share a common border , there has been conservation of fhbp and pora antigens among w isolates over a period of seven years .

the fhbp variant group is designated according to the classification proposed by masignani et al .
17. fhbp sequence id , pora subtype , nada and nhba allele were determined by sequence query on http :// pubmlst.org / neisseria .
each isolate was typed by pcr amplification of each respective gene and sequence analysis using bioinformatics software simmonics , mega 5 and chromas .
nada + is1301 : strains with nada encoding gene containing insertion sequence is1301 .
nhba - / stop codon : strains lacking the nhba encoding gene or having nhba with stop codon .
the serogroup w isolates studied have intermediate or high fhbp expression the level of fhbp protein expression can affect susceptibility of meningococci to anti - fhbp antibodies .
high expressers of fhbp are generally more susceptible to killing than low expressers 19 .
we measured fhbp expression in 17 isolates .
we selected 4 out of 8 ( 50 %) strains from burkina faso and 13 out 23 ( 56 %) strains from ghana for fhbp expression analysis .
these were selected to cover isolates from different years including the oldest and newest strains .
within this group of strains selected , n = 2 ( 50 %) of the strains from burkina faso and n = 7 ( 53 %) of the strains from ghana were case isolates , while the remainder were carriage isolates .
we prepared whole cell extracts of the serogroup w test strains and the serogroup b reference strain and compared fhbp levels with defined amounts of a fhbp v.2 protein standard by western blot and densitometry measurement ( dataset 1 ) .
expression level of the reference serogroup b strain 8047 was set to 100 % and levels of expression of the serogroup w strains were compared with the reference strain .
isolates with means below 33 % of the reference strain were classified as low expressers while isolates with expression above 100 % were categorized as high expressers .
those with mean fhbp expression between 33 - 100 % were considered intermediate expressers .
the expression of fhbp among the w isolates was variable , ranging from 50 - 152 % , compared to the reference serogroup b strain 8047 , with 41 % of the isolates expressing equal or higher levels of fhbp compared to the reference strain ( figure 2 ) .
there was no significant difference in fhbp expression between case and carrier isolates studied ( p = 0.74 , mann whitney u test ) .
this indicates that levels of fhbp protein on the bacterial surface can vary among strains collected from a relatively small region and expressing the same fhbp id. figure 2 .

bars represent the mean percentage from three biological replicates compared with the expression of fhbp of the reference group b strain 8047 , a high expresser of fhbp variant 2 id 77 , which was set at 100 % .
isolates with means below 33 % were classified as low expressers while isolates with expression above 100 % were categorized as high expressers .
values between 33 - 100 % were considered as intermediate expression .
bars represent standard errors .
the genomes of most serogroup w isolates studied contain nada nada and nhba induce the production of bactericidal antibodies against n. meningitidis serogroup b strains .
wang et al. found that nada was not present among a small number ( n = 13 ) of w isolates tested as part of an analysis of 896 serogroup b , c , y and w isolates from the usa , while nhba was present in 92 % of w isolates 20 .
among the african w strains investigated in this study , the nada allele 3 was present in 26 / 31 ( 84 %) of isolates ( figure 1 ) .
among the remaining five w isolates ( 1 case , 4 carrier isolate ) , pcr amplification across the nada site gave a 2 kb product instead of the expected 1 kb product .
western blotting using whole cell lysate and polyclonal mouse anti - nada allele 3 antibody indicated that these isolates did not express nada ( dataset 1 ) .
sequencing of this fragment confirmed the presence of the insertion sequence is1301 .
this 842 - bp mobile genetic element is known to cause a number of effects including insertions and deletions that result in silent mutations , knock - out of gene expression or regulation of downstream - located genes .
for example , insertion of is1301 into the capsular siaa gene mediates loss of encapsulation resulting in increased adherence and entry of meningococci into epithelial cells 21 , 22 .
17 out of 21 carrier ( 81 %) and 9 out of 10 ( 90 %) case isolates had a nada gene .
previous reports found that nada is present in about 50 % of group b case isolates , but underrepresented in carrier isolates 23 .
nhba was present in 30 / 31 ( 94 %) of the meningococcal isolates studied .
however , genetic sequencing in these isolates revealed a stop codon for 15 / 30 isolates , which has not previously been reported .
the alleles of the remaining strains were identified as allele 17 ( supplemental file ) using the neisseria typing database available at http :// pubmlst.org / neisseria / nhba / .

discussion since the introduction of a meningococcal a polysaccharide conjugate vaccine menafrivac ( r ) in the african meningitis belt , outbreaks of meningitis caused by non - serogroup a meningococci , particularly w , are occurring with increased frequency .
the development of a protein - based vaccine that can provide broad protection is an attractive prospect .
an approach to understanding whether protein - based vaccines could have an impact on reducing the burden of meningococcal disease in the african meningitis belt , is to examine the genetic diversity of carriage and disease isolates of serogroup w. in this study , we focused on investigating the molecular diversity of four omp vaccine antigens of 31 carriage and disease isolates of serogroup w from ghana and burkina faso .
the strains studied were isolated between 2003 and 2009 and contain conserved fhbp , pora and nada genes , suggesting little antigenic diversification over time .
a stop codon was identified among over half of the nhba genes sequenced and was associated with a lack of expression of nhba protein .
previously , pajon et al. performed a molecular characterization of 106 invasive meningococcal isolates from 13 african countries , 26 of which were from burkina faso and 3 from ghana. of the serogroups w analysed in the study , 58 % were fhbp variant 2 , in common with all w isolates from our collection , while 34 % were variant 1 and 8 % variant 3 .
concordant with our findings , 98 % of w were pora subtype p1.5,2 or a related subtype indicating a marked homogeneity of pora type among african serogroup w isolates 19 .
a more recent longitudinal study found that a hypervirulent st - 11 serogroup w clone was responsible for most meningococcal disease in 2011 and 2012 24 .
all the isolates expressed pora 1.5,2 and 96.4 % had feta ( iron - regulated outer - membrane protein which is involved in uptake of siderophores 25 ) variant f1 - 1 .
in accordance with our study , these two previous studies emphasise the limited diversification of major omps in the serogroup w meningococcal population in africa .
studies with isogenic mutants with different expression levels of fhbp suggested that low fhbp expression contributes to resistance to anti - fhbp bactericidal activity 19 .
it has been suggested that sparse distribution of antigens on the bacterial surface impedes cross - linking of two igg anti - fhbp antibodies to correctly spaced epitopes 26 .
consequently , the antibodies cannot engage the complement protein c1q , preventing activation of the classical complement pathway .
in the present study , the serogroup w isolates were found to express medium to high levels of fhbp when compared with a serogroup b strain known to express naturally relatively high levels of fhbp 17 , and there was no significant difference in expression between case and carrier isolates .
this , together with the conservation of the fhbp id among carrier and case isolates indicates that both carrier and case isolates could be targets of vaccine - induced anti - fhbp antibodies .
nada has emerged as an important protein for adhesion and invasion , and has been shown to elicit bactericidal antibodies 8 .
in this study , the presence of the nada gene in most case and carrier strains isolated from african countries suggests that nada could be a potentially important vaccine antigen to be included in a gmma vaccine for africa .
conclusion this longitudinal study of meningococcal serogroup w isolates from two african countries , together with the findings of other studies , suggests that there is limited antigenic variation of meningococcal outer membrane proteins that induce bactericidal antibodies .
these findings support a strategy of using protein - based vaccines , such as gmma , to prevent meningococcal meningitis in africa caused by serogroup w. data availability f1000research : dataset 1 .

7 4 2015 version recommendationapprove this article describes the molecular characterization of the diversity of pora , fhbp , nada and nhba vaccine antigens in 31 serogroup w neisseria meningitidis strains ( 21 carriage and 10 disease strains , isolated from ghana and burkina faso between 2003 and 2009 ) .
the article is clear and well written and provides information to help guide vaccine development for serogroup w meningococcal disease in these countries .
some comments and questions include : only 10 serogroup w disease isolates were investigated .
how many serogroup w cases were there in this region between 2003 - 2009 , and how many have there been post menafrivac implementation in 2010 ? is there any reason to expect a change in serogroup w epidemiology post menafrivac implementation , given that the total number of serogroup w cases has increased , as well as the variability of meningococcal epidemiology ?
it is stated that " a stop codon was identified among over half of the nhba genes sequenced and was associated with a lack of expression of nhba protein " .
where is the premature stop codon located in the subset of nhba genes ? was expression examined by western blot ?
i could not access sequence data from the file " supplemental file .
sequencing analysis of fhbp , pora , nhba and nada genes from serogroup w strains. " i have read this submission .
i believe that i have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard .

10 3 2015 version recommendationapprove in this manuscript , ispasanie et al. describes the characterization of vaccine antigens of meningococcal serogroup w isolates from both carriers and patients in ghana and burkina faso .
the work seems very interesting and adds up to the previous knowledge with information on the limited antigenic variation of meningococcal omps that induce antibodies .
the manuscript is well written and the methodology is well defined .
minor comments : the authors state in the discussion section , that after the introduction of the meningococcal a vaccine outbreaks caused particularly by serogroup w are occurring with increased frequency .
to the reader 's surprise , only 31 isolates were studied ( 21 carrier and 10 patient strains ) within a seven year period ( 2003 - 2009 ) .
maybe the authors would consider adding more information of the numbers of serogroup w incidence or number of cases in both countries and the reason why they choose only this limited number for characterization of the vaccine antigens .
i have read this submission .
i believe that i have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard .

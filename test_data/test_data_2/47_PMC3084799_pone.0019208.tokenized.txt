background the putative needle complex subunit ascf forms a ternary complex with the chaperones asce and ascg in the type iii secretion system of aeromonas hydrophila so as to avoid premature assembly .
previously , we demonstrated that the c - terminal region of ascg ( residues 62 - 116 ) in the hetero - molecular chaperone , asce - ascg , is disordered and susceptible to limited protease digestion .
methodology / principal findings here , we report the crystal structure of the ordered ascg1 - 61 region in complex with asce at 2.4 a resolution .
helices alpha2 and alpha3 of asce in the asce - ascg1 - 61 complex assumes a helix - turn - helix conformation in an anti - parallel fashion similar to that in apo asce .
however , in the presence of ascg , an additional n - terminal helix alpha1 in asce ( residues 4 - 12 ) is observed .
pscg or yscg in the crystal structures of psce - pscf - pscg or ysce - yscf - yscg , respectively , assumes a typical tetratricopeptide repeat ( tpr ) fold with three tpr repeats and one c - terminal capping helix. by comparison , ascg in asce - ascg1 - 61 comprises three anti - parallel helices that resembles the n - terminal tpr repeats in the corresponding region of pscg or yscg in psce - pscf - pscg or ysce - yscf - yscg .
thermal denaturation of asce - ascg and asce - ascg1 - 61 complexes demonstrates that the c - terminal disordered region does not contribute to the thermal stability of the overall complex .
conclusion / significance the n - terminal region of the ascg in the asce - ascg complex is ordered and assumes a structure similar to those in the corresponding regions of psce - pscg - pscf or ysce - yscf - yscg complexes .
while the c - terminal region of ascg in the asce - ascg complex is disordered and will assume its structure only in the presence of the substrate ascf .
we hypothesize that asce act as a chaperone of the chaperone to keep ascg in a stable but partially disordered state for interaction with ascf .
introduction aeromonas hydrophila is a ubiquitous gram - negative bacterium that often leads to motile aeromonad septicemia in both fish and human [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , characterized by gastroenteritis , wound infections and systemic illness [ 3 ] .
many gram - negative bacteria exploit host cellular functions through the use of type iii secretion systems ( t3sss ) for host penetration and effector delivery [ 4 ] .
the t3ss is complex , comprising more than 20 proteins spanning three membranes , which ensure the successful delivery of effectors [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
recent insight into this complexity has been gained by the understating of the intricate structures of the inner and outer membrane rings , the associated atpase , the needle complex , and the interaction of chaperones and substrates of t3ss .
a t3ss gene cluster has been located in a. hydrophila ah - 1 and shown to be necessary for its pathogenesis [ 8 ] .
at least three t3ss - secreted proteins ( or effector proteins ) have been identified in the extracellular proteome of a t3ss - negative regulator mutant but not in a t3ss - deficient mutant [ 9 ] .
one of these effector proteins showed homology to aext / aexu effector which has been reported recently in a. hydrophila strains ah - 3 [ 10 ] and ssu [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
chaperone proteins are required to avoid premature oligomerization of the needle complex subunit or translocators , and to maintain effectors in a form ready to be translocated in the t3ss system .
these chaperones keep the subunit in a soluble and monomeric form inside the bacterial cell .
there are several key examples identified over the last decade that demonstrate the importance of chaperones .
for instance , the dimeric class i chaperone , syce , maintains the non - native conformation of the effector , yope , in yersinia pseudotuberculosis [ 13 ] .
in pseudomonas aeruginosa , psce and pscg interact to form a heteromolecular chaperone , psce - pscg , which traps the needle complex subunit , pscf , in a monomeric state by forming a 1:1:1 ternary psce - pscf - pscg complex .
when the proteins were expressed and purified separately , neither psce nor pscg could rescue polymerized pscf [ 14 ] .
the dimeric class ii chaperone lcrh / sycd consists of three tetratricopeptide repeat ( tpr ) - like motifs and interacts separately with translocators yopb and yopd in y. pseudotuberculosis [ 15 ] .
more recently , crystal structures of sycd from y. enterocolitica [ 16 ] and pcrh from p. aeruginosa in complex with a short peptide from popd were determined [ 17 ] .
the crystal structures of chaperones that are required for the needle - complex subunit , for example , asce from a. hydrophila ( pdb id : 2q1k ) [ 18 ] and ysce from y. pestis ( pdb id : 1zw0 ) [ 19 ] , have revealed that both dimeric proteins comprise two helix - turn - helix monomers packed in an anti - parallel fashion .
the recent crystal structure of the ysce - yscf - yscg complex ( pdb id : 2p58 ) demonstrated that ysce interacts with the n - terminal tpr motif of yscg .
yscg binds tightly to the c - terminal half of yscf which adopts an alpha - helical hairpin conformation [ 20 ] .
the analogous crystal structure of the psce - pscf55 - 85 - pscg complex ( pdb id : 2uwj ) revealed that the psce - pscg heterodimeric chaperone folded in the form of a cupped hand with the c - terminus of pscf engulfed within the hydrophobic groove of pscg [ 21 ] .
in both cases , the substrate adopted a non - native conformation , and pscf and yscf substrates were disordered at the n - terminus .
other than the needle - complex subunit , the effector and translocator display disordered regions when in complex with their respective chaperone .
for instance , the s1 region of the effector yope remained disordered in the presence or absence of the chaperone syce [ 22 ] .
moreover , we have shown that large regions of the translocators aopb and aopd were disordered and susceptible to limited protease digestion when in complex with the chaperone acrh [ 23 ] .
it seems that the presence of disordered regions in the substrate is a common characteristic in the chaperone - substrate complex of t3ss .
however , the chaperone itself typically does not contain any disordered regions , such as the chaperone ysce for effector and the chaperone acrh for translocators .
interestingly , our previous work contrasts this ; we found that the c - terminal region ( residues 62 - 116 ) of the chaperone ascg is disordered when in complex with asce , while the n - terminal 61 residues of ascg in the asce - ascg complex is resistant to protease digestion [ 23 ] .
here , we report the crystal structure of the heteromolecular chaperone formed by asce and the n - terminal 61 residues of ascg from a. hydrophila ah - 1 ( pdb id : 3ph0 ) refined to 2.4 a resolution .
notably , we found that this n - terminal region of ascg assumed a conformation identical to the corresponding regions in the psce - pscf - pscg or ysce - yscfg complexes .
taking into consideration previous work in the field , we propose that asce is required to keep the n - terminal region of ascg in a stable and ordered conformation , while the disordered c - terminal region of ascg will only be induced to fold upon interaction with the ascf substrate .
results overall structure of asceg1 - 61 complex the structure of asce - ascg1 - 61 was solved by molecular replacement method and refined to a final r - factor of 0.239 ( rfree = 0.292 ) at 2.4 a resolution .
the model was refined with good stereochemical parameters ( table 1 and fig. 1c ) .
each asymmetric unit contained two molecules of asce - ascg1 - 61 complex .
interpretable electron density was not observed for the residues in the loop region ( residues 37 - 40 ) between helices alpha2 and alpha3 and the c - terminal residues gly54 to leu61 .
the helices alpha2 ( residues 14 - 35 ) and alpha3 ( residues 44 - 65 ) of asce formed a pair of anti - parallel helices in the asce - ascg1 - 61 complex with a topology similar to those in the crystal structure of apo asce [ 18 ] ( fig. 1b ) .
the n - terminal 14 residues of asce were disordered in the crystal structure of apo asce .
in contrast , when in complex with ascg1 - 61 , this region was induced to form a two - turn helix , alpha1 ( residues 4 - 12 ) , located in a perpendicular orientation to alpha2 , similar to that which is observed by psce in the psce - pscf - pscg complex [ 21 ] ( fig. 1b ) .
within the asce - ascg1 - 61 complex , the helices alpha1 and alpha2 of asce only interacted with helix alphaa of ascg1 - 61 , while helix alpha3 of asce interacted with both helices alphaa and alphab of ascg1 - 61 ( fig. 1b ) .

sequence and structural homology the sequence identity between psce and ysce is only 25.4 % .
however , the sequence alignment of asce - ascg to psce - pscf - pscg and ysce - yscf - yscg revealed a 43.3 % and 38.8 % sequence homology , respectively .
ascg1 - 61 has a 55.7 % sequence identity to the corresponding regions in both pscg and yscg , but the c - terminal disordered region of ascg is less conserved , with sequence identities of only 45.5 % and 41.8 % to pscg and yscg , respectively ( fig. 1a ) .
the structure of pscg or yscg in the psce - pscf - pscg or ysce - yscf - yscg complexes comprised three tetratricopeptide repeats ( tpr ) and an additional c - terminus alpha - helix , forming a palm - shaped molecule [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
here , we showed that the structure of ascg1 - 61 in the asce - ascg1 - 61 complex consisted of an anti - parallel three helices bundle , with topology similar to the first on - and - a - half of the n - terminal tpr of pscg / yscg in both psce - pscf - pscg / ysce - yscf - yscg complexes .
the remaining one - and - a - half tpr and alpha - helix in the c - terminus was disordered in the asce - ascg complex .
furthermore , in the asce - ascg1 - 61 complex , only residues from the first tpr ( alphaa , residues 3 - 20 ; and alphab , residues 22 - 35 ) interacted with asce , whereas the helix alphac ( residues 39 - 52 ) from the n - terminal half of the second tpr showed no points of contact with asce ( fig. 1b ) .
previously , it was demonstrated that the major difference between the crystal structures of psce - pscg and ysce - yscg , aside from the additional alpha - helix at the n - terminus of psce , was the position of the two alpha - helices of the e protein relative to the g protein [ 20 ] .
using the program " topmatch " [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , superposition of psce with ysce in psce - pscf - pscg and ysce - yscf - yscg , respectively , had a root mean square deviation ( rmsd ) of 0.7 a , while superposition of pscg with yscg in psce - pscf - pscg and ysce - yscf - yscg , respectively , had a rmsd of 1.1 a. however , overlay of the full structures of psce - pscg and ysce - yscg showed a relatively higher rmsd of 1.7 a , consistent with the above observation .
similarly , the structure of asce - ascg1 - 61 was superpositioned and compared with the corresponding regions in psce - pscf - pscg and ysce - yscf - yscg ( fig. 2 ) .
we identified that superposition of asce - ascg1 - 61 had a rmsd of 1.1 a with either psce - pscf - pscg or ysce - yscf - yscg , suggesting that the orientation of asce relative to ascg lies intermediate between psce - pscf - pscg and ysce - yscf - yscg .
the individual molecules of asce and ascg1 - 61 showed a similar structure to the corresponding regions in the psce - pscf - pscg and ysce - yscf - yscg complexes .
superposition of asce with psce and ysce from each of the respective complexes had rmsd of 1.2 a and 0.8 a , respectively , whereas this was reduced with superposition of ascg1 - 61 with pscg and yscg at 0.8 a and 0.9 a , respectively .

residues at interfaces of the ascg1 - 61 complex using the web server pisa ( protein interfaces , surfaces and assemblies ) at the european bioinformatics institute ( http :// www.ebi.ac.uk / msd - srv / prot _ int / pistart.html ) [ 26 ] , the surface area buried at the interface between asce and ascg1 - 61 was determined to be 893.2 a2 for each molecule .
this buried area accounts for 20 % of the total surface area of asce ( 4591.1 a2 ) and is predominantly hydrophobic in nature .
vicinity search based on the structure of asce - ascg1 - 61 showed that residues from all three helices of asce interacted with ascg .
asce residues leu5 and leu9 on helix alpha1 ; leu20 and leu24 on helix alpha2 ; and ile54 , ile60 , ile61 and ile64 on helix alpha3 formed a hydrophobic core between asce and ascg1 - 61 through their interaction with ascg1 - 61 ( fig. 3 ) .
several of these hydrophobic residues ( leu20 , leu24 , ile60 and ile64 ) interacted with the respective g molecule in the crystal structures of both psce - pscf - pscg and ysce - yscf - yscg .
leu5 and leu9 were only conserved in psce - pscf - pscg as interacting residues , as the n - terminal helix alpha1 was not observed in ysce - yscf - yscg , and ile54 and ile61 were conserved in ysce - yscf - yscg as interacting residues but not in psce - pscf - pscg .
for the contribution provided by ascg1 - 61 , only residues from helices alphaa and alphab of the first tpr interacted with asce in the asce - ascg1 - 61 complex .
leu5 , leu9 and leu12 from helix alphaa , and ile28 and trp31 from helix alphab of ascg1 - 61 were involved in forming the hydrophobic core with asce ( fig. 3 ). by comparison , in the crystal structure of psce - pscf - pscg and ysce - yscf - yscg , leu5 , leu9 and leu12 were also conserved interacting residues , while residues ile28 and trp31 were reported as interacting residues only in ysce - yscf - yscg .
interestingly , some of the reported interacting hydrophobic residues in the crystal structures of psce - pscf - pscg and ysce - yscf - yscg were replaced with charged or polar residues in asce or ascg , indicating that these residues may not be essential for the interaction .
for instance , ile6 and leu35 of pscg were replaced by lys6 and glu35 in ascg ; val43 and ala54 of ysce were replaced by gln46 and gly57 in asce ; and leu8 and ile15 of yscg were replaced by gln8 and ala15 in ascg .

ribbon representation of the asce - ascg1 - 61 crystal structure showing side chains of residues involved in the hydrophobic interface between asce ( blue ) and ascg1 - 61 ( red ) , at two different views .
based on the structure of psce - pscf - pscg and the residues on pscg reported to interact with pscf , we predict that the corresponding residues on ascg1 - 61 will interact with ascf : ala10 and leu14 on helix alphaa ; leu32 on helix alphab ; and val42 and leu44 on helix alphac .
in contrast , based on the structure of ysce - yscf - yscg , the corresponding residues of ascg1 - 61 are predicted to interact with ascf : lys7 , ala10 and leu14 on helix alphaa ; and cys41 and leu44 on helix alphac .
we speculate that highly conserved residues , such as ala10 and leu14 on helix alphaa and leu44 on helix alphac on ascg1 - 61 , are essential residues that should interact with ascf ( fig. 4 ) .
other than the n - terminal ordered region ( residues 1 - 61 ) , most of the conserved residues on pscg / yscg reported to interact with pscf / yscf were located at the disordered region ( residues 62 - 116 ) of ascg .
for pscg , residues that correspond to the disordered region of ascg ( asp70 , pro73 , trp74 , leu77 , trp80 , ser102 , phe106 and leu110 ) interacted with pscf in the psce - pscf - pscg complex .
similarly , for yscg in the ysce - yscf - yscg complex , the main binding site for yscf is located from the 3rd to 7th helices includes almost identical residues corresponding to the disordered region of ascg ( val71 , pro73 , trp74 , leu77 , trp80 , phe106 and leu110 of ascg ) .
we hypothesize that these residues that are common to both complexes ( pro73 , trp74 , leu77 , trp80 , phe106 and leu110 ) are essential residues at the disordered region of ascg involved in its interaction with ascf .

the surface diagrams were generated using the software chimera [ 44 ] .
thermal denaturation of asce - ascg and asce - ascf - ascg complexes to confirm the existence of disordered regions in asce - ascg and asce - ascf - ascg , we performed thermal denaturation monitored using far - uv cd. it is assumed that the disordered region has a random coil conformation and should not contribute significantly to the thermal stability of the protein complex .
thermal denaturation experiments on asce - ascg1 - 61 and asce - ascg full length protein showed similar denaturation profiles and tm of 66.5degreesc and 65.4degreesc , respectively ( fig. 5 ) .
the tm was determined by curve fitting according to the equation by ruiz - sanz et al .
[ 27 ] .
these data suggested that the additional region of ascg in the asce - ascg complex ( residues 62 - 116 ) did not contribute to the overall thermal stability of the complex and likely assumed a disordered conformation .
to further confirm this , we observed the thermal denaturations of asce - ascg - ascf53 - 87 and asce - ascg - ascf full length complexes .
the results demonstrated tm for denaturation of asce - ascg - ascf53 - 87 and asce - ascg - ascf complexes at 71.7degreesc and 71.1degreesc , respectively , indicating that residues 1 - 52 at the disordered region at the n - terminal region of ascf did not contribute to thermal stability of the whole complex ( fig. 5 ) .
we speculate that the overall higher thermal stability in the asce - ascg - ascf complex as compared to the asce - ascg complex is likely contributed by the c - terminal region of ascg , which becomes folded in the presence of ascf , as well as by the bound c - terminal region of ascf .

discussion the chaperones in the t3ss of bacteria typically assume a dimeric form in solution .
the class i chaperone ysce is a homodimer before and after binding to the effector yope [ 13 ] , [ 28 ] .
in contrast , while the class ii chaperone acrh is also a homodimer before binding to the translocators aopb or aopd , it converts into a monomer in the complex [ 23 ] .
the dimeric nature of the chaperones may be necessary to stabilize the protein in the absence of its substrate .
the class iii chaperone for the needle complex subunit is unique in that it is a heterodimer comprising e and g proteins .
previously , we discovered another unique feature of this class of chaperone : the presence of a disordered region in the g protein which only becomes folded in the presence of the substrate [ 18 ] .
for the other two classes of chaperones , such a disordered region has not been reported , in either the absence or presence of the substrate .
in the t3ss system , the substrate , when in complex with the chaperone , usually attends a non - native conformation .
for instance , the chaperone binding region of yope wraps around ysce in a non - native conformation [ 13 ] .
the chaperones , themselves , however , do not change their conformation after binding their substrate , but are maintained in a native conformation .
in this work , we determined the crystal structure of the asce - ascg1 - 61 complex to be surprisingly close to the native conformation of the corresponding region in the psce - pscf - pscg or ysce - yscf - yscg complexes .
the chaperone ascg maintains only half of the protein in a native conformation , while the other half is disordered and only becomes folded into a native conformation in the presence of substrate .
the structure of asceg1 - 61 , although similar to the corresponding region in psce - pscf - pscg and ysce - yscf - yscg , still has noticeable differences when compared to these structures .
the relative disposition of asce and ascg in the complex is in between that of psce - pscf - pscg and ysce - yscf - yscg .
the n - terminal 14 residues of asce , psce and ysce are highly conserved ( a major homology region ) ( fig. 1a ) .
our previous work showed that the n - terminal 13 residues of the apo asce dimer crystal structure were disordered and susceptible to limited protease digestion [ 18 ] .
however , this region forms an additional alpha - helix only when asce is in complex with ascg .
this n - terminal alpha - helix is also found in psce of the psce - pscf - pscg complex , but the first 9 residues of ysce form part of a contiguous alpha - helix in the crystal structure of ysce [ 19 ] and becomes disordered in the ysce - yscf - yscg complex [ 20 ] .
others have reported that this n - terminal region is non - essential for the formation of the e - g - f complex , as this region can be removed and psce can still form complex with g and f to give a functional t3ss [ 21 ] .
furthermore , it has been suggested that the n - terminal 14 residues of the e protein are not involved in binding with the substrate f , and in the psce - pscf - pscg complex , only the residue met2 of psce interacts with pscf [ 21 ] .
although the n - terminal 14 residues of asce may not be required to complex with g and f , asce itself is essential to keep ascg soluble , monomeric , stable and with a disordered region to interact with ascf .
expression of ascg alone will go into inclusion bodies and the co - expression of ascg and ascf fails to form a complex [ 23 ] .
ascg , or other class iii chaperones such as yscg and pscg , assumes a typical tpr - like fold with seven helices ( tpr 1 - 3 with a c - terminal capping helix ) .
acrh also contains a tpr fold with seven helices , but the sequence identity of the aligned region between acrh and ascg is very low ( 22.4 %) .
however , acrh is stable and functional alone , while ascg requires asce for stabilization and to keep it in a disordered state for functioning .
the major difference between acrh ( class ii chaperone ) and ascg ( class iii chaperone ) is that acrh forms a dimer and contains extra residues at the region n - terminal to the tpr 1 that have the potential to form an additional helix .
ipgc is a class ii chaperone of the t3ss in shigella and each monomer consists of eight helices ( h1 - h8 ) , with h1 ( residues 9 - 21 ) situated n - terminal to tpr 1 .
ipgc forms an asymmetric dimer with h1 of chain a , which is stabilized by a hydrophobic interface provided by h1 , h3 , h4 and h5 of chain b .
h1 and the loop connecting it to h2 show different arrangement in both subunits .
if the first 20 residues is truncated , ipgc will form an aggregate with very high m.w .
[ 29 ] .
in yersinia , the chaperone sycd forms a head - to - head dimer via tpr 1 ( helices 1a and 1b ) , and formation of the dimer could stabilize the interface that may require asce in the case of ascg .
the region n - terminal to tpr 1 also form an additional helix h0 ( residues 22 - 29 ) , although it is not involved substantially in dimer formation [ 16 ] .
the class ii chaperone will only change from a dimer to a monomer when it is in complex with the translocator substrate [ 23 ] .
recent crystal structure of pcrh showed that it is also a dimer , although the dimer interactions are made through the convex side of the tpr fold instead of the n - terminal region and tpr 1 .
also , there are no additional helices n - terminal to tpr 1 in pcrh as the n - terminal 20 residues are disordered and residues 21 - 31 are unstructured in the crystal structure [ 17 ] .
intrinsically unstructured proteins are more commonly found in eukaryotes than prokaryotes , and their role and functions have been reviewed extensively [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
proteins that are intrinsically unstructured or contain extensive disordered regions are more malleable and can regulate and bind a diverse range of ligands .
in addition , disordered proteins provide a larger intermolecular interface with a smaller protein size [ 30 ] .
while these are advantages for cellular regulatory proteins , they are unlikely to be the reasons for ascg to have a disordered region , as ascf is its only known target .
instead , we believe that the presence of the disordered region in ascg enhances the speed of interaction [ 30 ] , [ 32 ] between ascg and ascf , which may facilitate turnover and allow for the rapid assembly of the needle complex subunit of the t3ss .
this use of disordered region to enhance the rate of interaction and uncouple specificity from binding affinity has been observed in the self - assembly processes of viruses and bacterial flagella , specifically during the process of regulating the addition of new components to the growing assembly [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] .
conclusions in conclusion , we have shown the crystal structure of the class iii chaperone , ascg , and demonstrated distinct differences in the organization of the protein : the n - terminus is ordered and natively folded under the help of another chaperone , asce , whereas the c - terminal portion is disordered .
this disordered half of the chaperone may facilitate fast turnover between itself and its binding substrate , ascf , with the presence of ascf , in turn , able to induce the chaperone to become ordered .
as the sequence identity between the c - terminal regions of ascg with yscg and pscg are high , we expect that the corresponding regions in yscg and pscg are also disordered in the absence of their respective substrates , but , further investigations are warranted .
materials and methods cloning of asce - ascg1 - 61 for co - expression of the complex formed between asce and the n - terminal 61 residues of ascg ( asce - ascg1 - 61 ) , full length asce was sub - cloned at the second multiple - cloning site ( mcs2 ) of the co - expression vector petduet - 1 ( novagen ) using ndei and xhoi restriction enzymes .
the petduet - 1 vector encodes for ampicillin resistance .
the truncated ascg was subsequently sub - cloned into the same vector at the first multiple - cloning site ( mcs1 ) , which contains the 6x his tag , using bamhi and ecori .
this permitted co - expression of both proteins from the same plasmid .
the correct constructs were confirmed by big dye dna sequencing ( applied biosystems ) .
expression and purification of asce - ascg1 - 61 escherichia coli bl21 ( de3 ) cells were transformed with the suitable plasmid and a single ampicillin - resistant colony was used to inoculate 50 ml of luria broth ( lb ) supplemented with 100 microg / ml of ampicillin .
the culture was grown overnight at 37degreesc by shaking at 200 rpm .
10 ml of the overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 l of lb and the cells were grown to early log phase ( od600 = 0.6 ) .
expression was induced with iptg at a final concentration of 0.4 mm , and the cells were grown at 25degreesc for an additional 14 h , and then harvested by centrifugation ( 6,000 rpm , 15 min ) .
the cell pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of ni - binding buffer ( 20 mm tris - hcl ph 7.5 , 500 mm nacl , 5 mm imidazole ) along with one tablet of complete edta - free cocktail protease inhibitor ( roche ) .
cells were lyzed using a sonicator and cell debris was removed by centrifugation ( 18,000 rpm , 30 min ) .
the supernatant was purified using ni - nta beads ( qiagen ) .
the proteins were eluted from the beads with ni - binding buffer containing 0.5 m of imidazole , then dialyzed against 3 l of gel filtration buffer containing 20 mm tris - hcl ph 7.5 , 200 mm nacl , 5 % glycerol and 5 mm dtt .
proteins were further purified on a prepacked hiload 16 / 60 superdex 75 prep grade ( ge healthcare ) gel filtration column on the akta fast protein liquid chromatography system ( ge healthcare ) using gel filtration buffer .
protein concentration was determined by uv absorption at 280 nm in a hitachi spectrophotometer .
eluted proteins were stored at minus 80degreesc for subsequent analysis .
circular dichroism spectra and thermal denaturation circular dichroism ( cd ) measurements were performed room temperature using a j - 810 spectropolarimeter ( jasco ) equipped with a temperature - controlled sample holder .
300 microl sample of 25 microm protein in a buffer containing 20 mm tris - hcl ph 7.5 and 5 mm dtt were used for thermal denaturation .
thermal denaturation was monitored by changes in cd ellipticity at 220 nm as a function of temperature from 10degreesc to 85degreesc with a heating rate of 2degreesc / min .
crystallization and structure determination asceg1 - 61 was dialyzed in a buffer containing 20 mm tris - hcl ph 7.5 and 5 mm dtt , and concentrated to 12 mg / ml. dynamic light scattering ( dls ) was used to check the homogeneity of concentrated proteins .
subsequently , the wizard crystal screen was carried out to identify the initial crystallization conditions .
the diffraction quality crystals of se - met labeled asceg1 - 61 ( 12 mg / ml in 10 mm tris ph 7.4 and 5 mm dtt ) was obtained at 25degreesc using a 1:1 mixture of protein and 10 % peg ( w / v ) 3000 , 0.1 m immidazole ph 8.0 and 0.2 m li2so4 .
crystals belonged to space group p21212 with unit cell dimensions a = 42.53 , b = 71.15 , and c = 86.42 a. the asymmetric unit contained two complex molecules with 51.8 % solvent .
crystals were cryo - protected in 20 % glycerol , mounted in fiber loops , and flash cooled to 100 k ( oxford cryostream ) .
diffraction data were collected at beamline 13b1 ( national synchroton radiation research center , taiwan ) using an adsc quantum - 315 ccd area detector .
the native and anomalous data sets were indexed , integrated and scaled using the hkl 2000 suite of programs ( otwinowski and minor , 1997 ) .
the structure was solved using multiple anomalous diffraction ( mad ) method .
all the expected five selenium sites were located and refined by " hkl2map " ( shelx cde ) [ 35 ] and " bnp " [ 36 ] that resulted in an interpretable electron density map .
phases were further improved by iterative cycles of 4 - fold non - crystallographic symmetry ( ncs ) averaging and solvent flattening with " dm " in " ccp4 " programs suite [ 37 ] .
the high resolution native data set collected in the in - house rotating anode generator was used to auto - build the initial model (~ 50 % residues ) with " arp / warp " [ 38 ] ; this traced the remaining chain as poly - alanine .
subsequently , the manual model building was completed using the programs " coot " [ 39 ] and " o " [ 40 ] and alternated with refinement with the program " cns " [ 41 ] .
model quality was verified with " procheck " [ 42 ] .
all residues were either in the most favored ( 93.1 %) or additional allowed ( 5.1 %) regions of the ramachandran plot .
superposition of structures for comparison of structures , the structure of asce - ascg1 - 61 was superpositioned with the corresponding regions in psce - pscf - pscg and ysce - yscf - yscg using " topmatch " [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] web service ( http :// topmatch.services.came.sbg.ac.at / topmatchflex.php ) .
the root - mean - square error of superposition in a was calculated using all structurally equivalent calpha atoms .
data deposition the atomic coordinates of a. hydrophila ah - 1 asce - ascg1 - 61 have been deposited at the protein data bank ( pdb id : 3ph0 ) .

the mammalian msx homeobox genes , msx1 and msx2 , encode transcription factors that control organogenesis and tissue interactions during embryonic development .
we observed overlapping expression of these factors in uterine epithelial and stromal compartments of pregnant mice prior to embryo implantation .
conditional ablation of both msx1 and msx2 in the uterus resulted in female infertility due to a failure in implantation .
in these mutant mice ( msx1 / 2 d / d ) , the uterine epithelium exhibited persistent proliferative activity and failed to attach to the embryos .
gene expression profiling of uterine epithelium and stroma of msx1 / 2 d / d mice revealed an elevated expression of several members of the wnt gene family in the preimplantation uterus .
increased canonical wnt signaling in the stromal cells activated beta - catenin , stimulating the production of a subset of fibroblast growth factors ( fgfs ) in these cells .
the secreted fgfs acted in a paracrine manner via the fgf receptors in the epithelium to promote epithelial proliferation , thereby preventing differentiation of this tissue and creating a non - receptive uterus refractory to implantation .
collectively , these findings delineate a unique signaling network , involving msx1 / 2 , wnts , and fgfs , which operate in the uterus at the time of implantation to control the mesenchymal - epithelial dialogue critical for successful establishment of pregnancy .
author summary during implantation , various tissue compartments within the uterus , including epithelium and stroma , undergo sequential proliferation and differentiation as the embryo attaches to the uterus and invades into the maternal tissue .
there is only limited understanding of the molecular signaling pathways that interconnect these tissue compartments to achieve a functional state of the uterus conducive to implantation .
this study reveals that a unique signaling network regulated by the homeobox transcription factors msx1 and msx2 in the mouse uterus critically controls female fertility .
targeted mutation of msx1 and msx2 genes in female mice , which results in infertility , established that these factors suppress signaling by the morphogenic ligands , wnts , in the uterus .
in the absence of msx1 and msx2 , the wnt signaling is elevated , leading to the production of a subset of fibroblast growth factors ( fgfs ) in uterine stroma .
these fgfs act in a paracrine manner on the uterine epithelium to promote epithelial proliferation , which results in lack of uterine receptivity and implantation failure .
this work , therefore , uncovers an important mechanism in mammalian reproduction and development by identifying key paracrine signals that arise from the uterine stroma to control epithelial function during implantation .
introduction successful implantation is dependent on a timely progression of a series of biological events during which the embryo undergoes functional interactions with the uterus prepared by the maternal factors [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] .
during implantation , various tissue compartments within the uterus , including luminal epithelium , glandular epithelium , and stroma , undergo sequential proliferation and differentiation as the embryo attaches to the luminal epithelium and invades into the stroma .
in mice , the luminal and glandular epithelial cells are initially in a proliferative state on days 1 and 2 of pregnancy .
as pregnancy proceeds , these cells exit from the cell cycle and enter a differentiation program that allows their transition to a receptive state .
the stromal cells adjacent to the epithelium begin to proliferate on day 3 and this proliferation becomes widespread following embryo attachment to the receptive luminal epithelium on day 4 of pregnancy [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] .
as the embryos invade through the luminal epithelium into the stromal compartment , the stromal cells differentiate into secretory decidual cells , which support further growth and development of the implanted embryos until placentation ensues [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] .
extensive research over the past decade , using genetically altered mutant mouse models , has identified several factors that critically regulate uterine function in the preimplantation or postimplantation phases of pregnancy [ 5 ] - [ 11 ] .
however , there is only limited insight into the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that interconnect the various cellular compartments of the uterus to achieve receptivity to embryo implantation .
recent studies in our laboratory indicated that a subset of fibroblast growth factors ( fgfs ) produced by the stromal cells act in a paracrine manner to promote luminal epithelial proliferation .
the transcription factor hand2 suppresses the production of these fgfs and inhibits luminal epithelial proliferation at the time of implantation [ 11 ] .
studies by lee et al identified indian hedgehog ( ihh ) as an epithelial paracrine factor that acts on the stromal cells to regulate their differentiation [ 7 ] .
these studies support the concept that maternal competency for implantation is determined by a critical exchange of diffusible signals between the epithelial and stromal compartments , allowing transition of these tissues to proper functional states that permit embryo attachment and invasion .
identification of epithelial or stromal transcription factors and their downstream molecular pathways that control these signals is essential for a clear understanding of the molecular basis of implantation .
it was previously reported that the messenger rna encoding the homeobox transcription factor msx1 is expressed in the peri - implantation uterus [ 12 ] .
we observed that msx2 , another member of msx family , is expressed in a similar pattern in the epithelial and stromal compartments of the preimplantation uterus during days 1 - 4 of pregnancy .
expressions of msx1 and msx2 were markedly reduced in both compartments following embryo attachment .
these findings raised the possibility that the pathways regulated by msx1 or msx2 or both regulate the receptive state of the preimplantation uterus .
global deletion of msx1 and msx2 gene is embryonic lethal , necessitating the development of conditional deletion of these genes to study their functions during implantation .
conditional ablation of either msx1 or msx2 showed only modest impairment in embryo implantation , resulting in sub - fertility of the mutant mice .
on the other hand , conditional ablation of both msx1 and msx2 in mouse uterus led to complete infertility due to a failure of embryo attachment to the uterine epithelium .
we further established that msx1 and msx2 function by suppressing the expression of several members of the wnt family .
in msx1 / msx2 - null uterus , continued expression of a subset of wnts enhances beta - catenin signaling in the stroma , which in turn induces the expression of specific members of the fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) family in this compartment .
one or more of these fgfs act via the fgf receptors in the glandular and luminal epithelial tissues to promote proliferation and prevent differentiation .
lack of differentiation of the glandular epithelial cells results in the failure to express critical factors , such as the leukemia inhibitory factor ( lif ) , which are critical for implantation .
additionally , undifferentiated luminal epithelial cells exhibit persistent expression of muc - 1 , a glycoprotein that serves as a maternal barrier to the attachment of the embryo .
this study , therefore , delineated a novel signaling network downstream of msx1 and msx2 , mediating the stromal - epithelial crosstalk critical for successful establishment of pregnancy .
results msx1 and msx2 are expressed in the preimplantation uterus the spatio - temporal profiles of mrnas and proteins corresponding to msx1 and msx2 were examined in the mouse uterus during the preimplantation phase by real - time pcr and immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) , respectively .
the expression of both msx1 and msx2 mrnas followed a similar pattern : an increase on days 2 - 3 of pregnancy followed by a decline on day 4 at the time of embryo implantation ( figure 1a , left panel ; figure 1b , left panel ) .
both msx1 and msx2 proteins were expressed in uterine epithelium on day 1 of pregnancy ( figure 1a , panel a ; figure 1b , panel a ) .
the expression of these proteins increased on days 2 and 3 of pregnancy and was localized to both glandular epithelium and stroma ( figure 1a , panels b and c ; figure 1b , panels b and c ) .
the expression of msx1 and msx2 proteins then declined on day 4 at the time of embryo implantation and were undetectable on day 5 ( figure 1a , panels d & e ; figure 1b , panels d & e ) .
therefore , similar expression of msx1 and msx2 was observed in the uterine epithelial and stromal compartments in the preimplantation phase .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1002500.g001 figure 1 expression of msx1 and msx2 in the uterus during early pregnancy .
real - time pcr was performed to monitor the expression of mrnas corresponding to msx1 and msx2 in uterus on days 1 to 5 of gestation .
the relative levels of gene expression on different days of pregnancy were determined by setting the expression level of msx1 mrna ( a , left panel ) and msx2 mrna ( b , left panel ) on day 1 of pregnancy at 1.0 .
rplp0 , encoding a ribosomal protein , was used to normalize the level of rna .
uterine sections from day 1 to day 5 ( a - e ) of pregnancy were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis using anti - msx1 ( a , right panel ) and anti - msx2 ( b , right panel ) antibodies .
panel f shows uterine sections from day 3 pregnant mice treated with non - immune igg .

ablation of msx1 and msx2 in the uterus leads to infertility to investigate the function of msx1 and msx2 in the uterus , we employed the cre - loxp strategy to create conditional single knockout of msx1 or msx2 or double knockout of msx1 and msx2 in the uteri of adult mice .
transgenic mice expressing cre under the control of progesterone receptor ( pr ) promoter was previously used to ablate " floxed " genes selectively in cells expressing pr , including uterine cells [ 7 ] - [ 11 ] .
we , therefore , crossed the pr - cre mice with mice harboring the " floxed " msx1 or msx2 or both to create msx1d / d , msx2d / d or msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice .
we confirmed the deletion of msx1 or msx2 in the uteri of these mutant mice by real - time pcr and ihc .
as shown in figure s1 , neither msx1 / msx2 mrna nor msx1 / msx2 protein was detected in uteri of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice on day 3 of pregnancy , confirming successful abrogation of both msx genes in uteri of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice .
a six - month breeding study demonstrated that the single mutant females , msx1d / d and msx2d / d , are subfertile but the double mutant females , msx1d / dmsx2d / d , are completely infertile ( table 1 ) .
the subfertility of the single mutant msx1d / d or msx2d / d was likely due to compensation of the function of one msx gene by the other .
indeed , in msx1 - null uteri , the level of msx2 expression in the uterus was markedly elevated ( figure s2 ) .

while msx1f / fmsx2f / f mice exhibited normal litter size and pregnancy rates , the msx1d / dmsx2d / d females failed to become pregnant when mated with wild - type males .
however , copulatory plugs were observed upon mating , indicating normal mating behavior .
to investigate the cause of infertility in msx1d / dmsx2d / d females , we examined their ovarian functions by inducing superovulation .
prepubertal msx1f / fmsx2f / f and msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice were treated with a regimen of gonadotropin hormones as described in materials and methods .
we observed that , upon gonadotropin stimulation , the number of eggs produced by msx1d / dmsx2d / d was comparable to that produced by the msx1f / fmsx2f / f females ( figure s3a ) , indicating that ovulation is not affected in the absence of msx1 and msx2 .
to further examine the ovulation and fertilization in these mice under normal physiological conditions , blastocysts were recovered from uteri of msx1f / fmsx2f / f and msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice on day 4 of pregnancy prior to implantation .
once again , no significant difference was found in either the number or the morphology of the embryos recovered from msx1f / fmsx2f / f and msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri ( figure s3b and figure 3c ) .
in further support of normal ovarian activity , the serum levels of progesterone and estrogen were comparable in msx1f / fmsx2f / f and msx1d / dmsx2d / d females on day 4 of pregnancy ( figure s3d and figure s3e ) .
collectively , these results suggested that the infertility of msx1d / dmsx2d / d females is not due to impairment in the hypothalamic - pituitary - ovarian axis or lack of fertilization , but is likely due to defective implantation or pregnancy failure following implantation .
ablation of msx1 and msx2 in the uterus affects embryo attachment to the luminal epithelium in mice , the attachment of the embryos to the uterine wall initiates the process of implantation .
this is accompanied by increased vascular permeability at the implantation sites , which can be scored visually as distinct blue bands following an intravenous injection of chicago blue dye [ 13 ] .
as shown in figure 2a , msx1f / fmsx2f / f mice displayed distinct implantation sites on day 5 of pregnancy .
in contrast , the msx1d / dmsx2d / d females did not show any sign of implantation .
implanted embryos were also assessed on days 6 and 7 of pregnancy by visual inspection .
our results indicated that implantation sites are absent in msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri ( figure 2a ) .

note the intimate contact between embryo and luminal epithelium in msx1f / fmsx2f / f mice and the free floating embryo in the uterine lumen of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice .
l and e indicate luminal epithelium and embryo respectively .
histological analysis of msx1f / fmsx2f / f females on day 5 of pregnancy showed , as expected , a close contact of embryonic trophectoderm with uterine luminal epithelium ( figure 2b , panel a ) .
in contrast , in msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri , embryos did not attach to luminal epithelium .
instead , blastocysts remained free - floating in the lumen and were readily recovered by uterine flushing of the msx1d / dmsx2d / d females ( figure 2b , panel b ) .
taken together , these results indicated that the loss of msx1 and msx2 expression in the uterus resulted in the inability of the luminal epithelium to acquire competency for embryo implantation .
estrogen receptor activity is elevated in uterine epithelium of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice at the time of implantation in mice , the window of uterine receptivity is critically regulated by the steroid hormones 17beta - estradiol ( e ) and progesterone ( p ) , acting through their cognate nuclear receptors .
we , therefore , examined the expression levels of progesterone receptor ( pgr ) , estrogen receptor alpha ( esr1 ) , and their downstream genes in the uteri of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice by immunohistochemistry and real - time pcr analyses .
as shown in figure 3a , the expression levels of pgr ( top panel ) and esr1 ( middle panel ) proteins in the luminal epithelium or stromal compartment of msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri were comparable to those of msx1f / fmsx2f / f controls .
however , we noted that the expression of the transcriptionally active form of esr1 , phosphorylated at serine 118 [ 14 ] , was markedly up - regulated in the luminal epithelial cells of msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri , indicating that er activity is elevated in the uterine epithelia of these mice ( lower panel ) .
this observation indicated that the pathways directed by msx1 / msx2 play an important role in controlling the esr1 activity , which is normally suppressed in uterine epithelium during the receptive phase [ 15 ] - [ 17 ] .
consistent with this up - regulation of transcriptional activity of esr1 , expression of mrnas corresponding to well - known e - regulated genes , such as lactotransferrin ( ltf ) [ 18 ] , chloride channel , calcium activated , family member 3 ( clca3 ) [ 19 ] , lipocalin 2 [ 20 ] and mucin 1 ( muc - 1 ) [ 21 ] , was significantly elevated in uterine epithelium of msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri on day 4 of pregnancy ( figure 3b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1002500.g003 figure 3 enhanced esr1 activity in the luminal epithelium of msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri. a. uterine sections obtained from msx1f / f msx2f / f ( left panel ) and msx1d / dmsx2d / d ( right panel ) mice on day 4 of pregnancy were subjected to ihc using antibodies against pgr ( top panel , a and b ) , esr1 ( middle panel , c and d ) and phospho - esr1 ( lower panel , e and f ). b. real - time pcr was performed to analyze the expression of e - regulated genes , lactotransferrin ( ltf ) , clca3 , lipocalin2 and muc - 1 in uteri of msx1f / fmsx2f / f and msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice on day 4 of pregnancy .
the level of ck18 was used as internal control to normalize gene expression .
the data are represented as the mean fold induction +/ - sem , * p < 0.05. c. real - time pcr was performed to analyze the expression of p - regulated genes , ihh , coup - tf ii , hand2 and hoxa10 , in uteri of msx1f / fmsx2f / f and msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice on day 4 of pregnancy .
the level of rplp0 or ck18 was used as internal control to normalize gene expression .
in contrast , the expression of ihh , a p - responsive gene in uterine epithelium [ 7 ] remained unaltered in msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri .
additionally , the mrna levels of hand2 [ 11 ] and hoxa10 [ 3 ] , well - known p - regulated genes in uterine stroma , and that of chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter - transcription factor ii ( coup - tf ii ) , a downstream target of ihh in the uterine stroma [ 9 ] , were unaffected in the uteri of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice ( figure 3c ) .
these results indicated that the loss of msx1 and msx2 did not impact on the transcriptional activity of pgr , but resulted in an enhancement of the epithelial esr1 function .
a hallmark of the receptive state of normal pregnant uterus is the cessation of epithelial cell proliferation prior to implantation [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] , [ 22 ] .
therefore , in msx1f / fmsx2f / f mice , immunostaining of ki67 , a cell proliferation marker , was undetectable in the uterine luminal and glandular epithelium on day 4 of pregnancy ( figure 4a , panels a and c ) .
however , uterine sections of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice exhibited robust immunostaining for ki67 in the luminal and glandular epithelia ( figure 4a , panels b and d ) , indicating persistent epithelial cell proliferation on day 4 in the absence of msx1 and msx2 .
previous studies indicated that the ability of the glandular epithelium to undergo differentiation and produce factors , including leukemia inhibitory factor ( lif ) [ 23 ] , foxa2 [ 24 ] , and spink3 [ 25 ] , is critical for implantation .
as shown in figure 4b , the expression of these factors was drastically reduced in uteri deficient of msx1 and msx2 .
collectively , these findings indicated that persistent proliferation of luminal and glandular epithelia results in impaired epithelial transition from a proliferative to a non - proliferative state that allows proper differentiation .
this impairment is a major contributor to implantation failure in msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice .

l indicates luminal epithelium .
another important parameter of receptive uterus is the membrane transformation of uterine epithelium at the time of implantation .
the presence of long microvilli , containing a thick layer of glycoprotein known as the glycocalyx , on the uterine epithelium is indicative of the nonreceptive stage .
a marked flattening of these microvilli occurs in the receptive phase prior to implantation [ 26 ] .
transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) revealed that , in contrast to the control epithelium , the epithelia of msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri fail to undergo appropriate remodeling to promote microvilli flattening , indicating impaired uterine receptivity in these mice ( figure 4c ) .
the impaired functional state of uterine epithelium in msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice was further confirmed when we analyzed the expression of muc - 1 protein , a major component of the endometrial glycocalyx , during early pregnancy .
the expression status of muc - 1 is considered an important indicator of uterine receptivity [ 21 ] .
as the luminal epithelium differentiates and the uterus achieves receptivity , muc - 1 expression is down regulated in this tissue .
persistent muc - 1 expression is indicative of a non - receptive uterus , which is not conducive to embryo implantation .
as shown in figure 4d , prominent expression of muc - 1 was detected in the uterine epithelia of control msx1f / fmsx2f / f mice on day 1 of pregnancy ( panel a ) .
as the pregnancy advanced to days 4 ( panel b ) and 5 ( panel c ) , muc - 1 was progressively down regulated in uterine epithelia of these mice , consistent with the attainment of receptive status .
in contrast , an intense expression of muc - 1 was observed in uteri of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice on days 4 and 5 ( panels d - f ) .
therefore , elevated epithelial esr1 signaling , which likely triggered persistent expression of muc - 1 in luminal epithelium , disrupted uterine receptivity , resulting in implantation failure in msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice .
msx1 / msx2 regulates wnt and fgf signaling in the uterus to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying the implantation defect of uteri lacking msx1 and msx2 , we isolated luminal epithelial and stromal cells from msx1f / fmsx2f / f and msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri on day 4 of pregnancy and performed compartment - specific gene expression profiling , using affymetrix mouse genechip arrays .
interestingly , our study revealed up - regulation of two distinct classes of signaling factors , wnts and fgfs , in msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri compared to msx1f / fmsx2f / f uteri .
the microarray data ( geo accession # gse30969 ) were validated by real - time pcr analysis .
in the epithelial compartment of msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri , we observed stimulated expression of mrnas corresponding to several wnts , including wnt4 , wnt7a and wnt7b ( figure 5a ) .
in the stromal cells of msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri , we observed marked up - regulation of wnt4 and wnt5a mrnas ( figure 5b ) .
in addition , the levels of mrnas encoding several members of the fgf family , such as fgf1 , fgf10 , fgf18 and fgf21 , were elevated in uterine stromal cells as a consequence of deletions of msx1 and msx2 ( figure 5c ) .
the expression of mrnas corresponding to several other fgf family members as well as other growth factors , such as hbegf , egf , igf - 1 , and , hgf which are expressed in the uterus during pregnancy , was not significantly altered in the uterine stroma of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice ( figure 5c and figure s4 ) .

( magnification : a and c : 10x , b and d : 40x ) e. primary stromal cells were isolated from uteri of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice on day 3 of pregnancy and transfected with sirna targeted to the beta - catenin mrna .
total rna was isolated 24 h after transfection to analyze the expression of fgf family members by real - time pcr .
the level of rplp0 was used as an internal control to normalize gene expression .
the data are represented as the mean fold induction +/ - sem , * p < 0.01 , ** p < 0.001 , *** p < 0.0001 .
we next investigated whether the increased expression of the wnt ligands in the uteri of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice is translated into increased activation of the wnt signaling pathway .
wnt signals are transduced via the canonical wnt / beta - catenin - dependent pathway or the non - canonical beta - catenin - independent pathways [ 27 ] - [ 29 ] .
when we examined the expression of active beta - catenin in uterine sections of msx1f / fmsx2f / f and msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice on day 4 of pregnancy , we noted comparable levels of nuclear expression of active beta - catenin in luminal and glandular epithelium in both genotypes ( figure 5d ) .
however , a marked increase in the level of nuclear beta - catenin was observed in the stromal cells of msx1msx2 - null uteri , indicating that canonical beta - catenin signaling is markedly enhanced in the msx1msx2 - ablated stroma .
interestingly , previous studies indicated that the production of fgfs , particularly fgf10 and fgf18 , is stimulated downstream of canonical wnt signaling during certain cellular processes , such as chick embryo development , bone development and human hepatocellular carcinoma [ 30 ] - [ 32 ] , raising the possibility that the enhanced beta - catenin signaling seen in uterine stromal cells of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice may drive the increased fgf synthesis in these cells .
to test this possibility , primary stromal cells were isolated from uteri of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice on day 3 of pregnancy and transfected with sirna targeted specifically to the beta - catenin mrna .
we observed that treatment with this sirna resulted in more than 80 % reduction in beta - catenin mrna expression compared to cells transfected with control ( scrambled ) sirna ( figure 5e ) .
most importantly , as shown in figure 5e , sirna - mediated down regulation of beta - catenin in the stromal cells led to a significant reduction in expression of fgf10 , fgf18 , and fgf21 .
however , the expression of fgf1 remained unaltered in cells treated with beta - catenin sirna .
these results indicated that canonical wnt signaling via beta - catenin regulates the expression of a specific subset of fgf family members in the uterine stromal cells .
we next investigated whether the increased production of fgfs downstream of wnt signaling leads to enhanced fgf receptor ( fgfr ) signaling in the uteri of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice .
stimulation of the cell surface fgfrs by fgf ligands leads to phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in a critical docking protein , fgfr substrate 2 ( frs2 ) , which guides the assembly of distinct multi - protein complexes , leading to the activation of either map kinase or akt signaling cascades [ 33 ] - [ 35 ] .
we , therefore , investigated the state of activation of the fgfr signaling pathway in the uteri of msx1f / fmsx2f / f and msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice by monitoring the level of phospho - frs2 .
we observed only low level of phospho - frs2 in the uterine luminal or glandular epithelium or stroma of msx1f / fmsx2f / f mice on day 4 of pregnancy ( figure 6a , panels a - c ) .
in contrast , a marked elevation in the level of phospho - frs2 was observed specifically in the luminal and glandular epithelium , but not in the stroma ( figure 6a , panels d - f ) of msx1msx2 - null uteri , indicating that fgfr signaling is increased in uterine epithelium in the absence of msx1 / msx2 .
since the fgfs are produced in the stroma of these mutant uteri , this finding suggests that they act in a paracrine fashion via the fgfrs on the epithelial cells .

the other horn served as vehicle - treated control .
uterine horns were collected on day 4 morning and sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry to detect p - frs2 , ki67 , and muc - 1 .
the kinases erk1 / 2 and / or pi3k / akt are known to be activated downstream of fgf receptor signaling [ 33 ] .
we , therefore , investigated whether these pathways were activated in the epithelia of msx1msx2 - ablated uteri .
as shown in figure 6b , phospho - erk1 / 2 ( perk ) was undetectable in the uterine epithelium of msx1f / fmsx2f / f mice on day 4 of pregnancy ( panels a - c ) .
however , a dramatic increase in the immunostaining of perk1 / 2 was seen in epithelium of msx1msx2 - null uteri on day 4 of pregnancy ( panels d - f ) .
in contrast , the expression of phospho - akt was undetectable in both of these genotypes ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the erk1 / 2 pathway , rather than the pi3k / akt pathway , is the key downstream mediator of enhanced fgfr signaling in msx1msx2 - null uteri .
to examine whether the elevated mitogenic activity in the luminal epithelium of msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri on day 4 of pregnancy is indeed a result of the enhanced fgf signaling , we administered pd173074 , a fgfr - specific inhibitor [ 36 ] , or vehicle into uterine horns of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice in the pre - implantation phase .
as shown in figure 6c , the epithelia of vehicle - treated uterine horns of these mice showed strong expression of phospho - frs2 on day 4 of pregnancy ( panel a ) .
treatment with the fgfr inhibitor led to a marked reduction in the level of phospho - frs2 in the uterine epithelium ( figure 6c , panel b ) .
concomitant with this down regulation of fgfr signaling , we observed a decline in the proliferative activity of msx1msx2 - null uterine epithelia as well as down - regulation of muc - 1 expression ( figure 6c , panels c - f ) .
collectively , these results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased fgf production , downstream of wnt - beta - catenin pathway in msx1msx2 - null uterine stroma , stimulates epithelial proliferation by activating fgfr - erk1 / 2 signaling pathway .
the proliferative epithelium fails to undergo differentiation , resulting in persistent expression of muc - 1 , which acts as a major barrier to embryo attachment and implantation .
discussion members of msx family of homeobox genes , comprising of msx1 , msx2 , and msx3 , are critical regulators of tissue morphogenesis [ 37 ] - [ 39 ] .
while msx1 and msx2 are expressed in several tissues during embryonic development , msx3 expression is mostly restricted to neural tube [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] .
the present study describes the expression of msx1 and msx2 in adult uterus and addresses their roles in female reproduction .
using mutant mouse models harboring conditional deletion of msx1 and / or msx2 in the uterus , we established that these factors play critical roles in regulating uterine function during implantation .
due to the overlapping spatio - temporal expression of these two transcription factors in uterine epithelium and stroma , it is not surprising that female mice carrying deletion of either msx1 or msx2 are subfertile , while those lacking both msx1 and msx2 are infertile .
we observed that the expression of msx2 is markedly elevated in msx1 - null uterus during early pregnancy ( figure s2 ) , supporting the concept that the loss of function of one msx gene during early pregnancy is partially compensated by the other .
msx1 and msx2 are critical regulators of the receptive state of the uterus during implantation .
particularly interesting is the finding that uterine expression of msx1 / msx2 influences the activity of beta - catenin in the stroma , which in turn regulates epithelial activity during early pregnancy .
the identity of the factors that function downstream of msx1 / msx2 to regulate stromal - epithelial cross - talk during implantation was revealed by compartment - specific gene expression profiling of epithelial and stromal cells collected from control and msx1msx2 - ablated uteri .
we found that , in the absence of msx1 and msx2 in the uterus , the expression of several wnt ligands was up - regulated in uterine epithelial and stromal cells .
while the expression of wnt4 , wnt7a , and wnt7b was elevated in the epithelium , that of wnt4 and wnt5a increased in the stroma. with the exception of wnt5a , these wnts are known to signal via the canonical pathway to release beta - catenin from a complex with gsk3beta , leading to its stabilization and nuclear accumulation [ 27 ] - [ 29 ] .
nuclear beta - catenin then associates with tcf / lef family transcription factors to regulate cellular gene expression .
consistent with this scenario , a marked increase in the level of active beta - catenin was observed in uterine stromal cells of msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri , while the active beta - catenin levels remained unaltered in the surface epithelium .
our results indicated that canonical wnt signaling is specifically enhanced in the stromal cells as a consequence of msx1msx2 ablation .
how does msx1 / msx2 regulate the wnts and whether the beta - catenin activation in the stromal cells is driven by wnts originating in the epithelium or stroma , is unclear .
an important finding of this paper is that , in addition to wnts , the expression of several members of the fgf family is stimulated in the stromal cells of msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri .
the fgfs belong to a large family of growth factors , comprising 23 distinct members [ 33 ] - [ 35 ] .
we observed that a subset of fgfs , including fgf1 , fgf10 , fgf18 and fgf21 , exhibited marked up - regulation in uterine stroma of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice , indicating that the expression of these growth factors are normally suppressed by msx1 / msx2 .
interestingly , previous studies have shown that tcf / lef , activated downstream of wnt - beta - catenin signaling in colorectal cancer cells , binds to the promoter regions of fgf18 and fgf20 [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 42 ] .
studies have also shown that , in the chick embryo , wnt - beta - catenin signaling triggered the synthesis of fgf8 and fgf10 , which control the initiation of limb development .
these previous findings suggested that wnt - activated beta - catenin regulates the expression of a subset of fgfs [ 30 ] .
in the present study , we provide direct evidence that active beta - catenin regulates the synthesis of the fgfs , particularly fgf10 , fgf18 , and fgf21 , in the stromal cells , uncovering a link between the wnt and fgf signaling pathways in the endometrium .
the precise mechanism by which active beta - catenin regulates the expression of these fgfs in uterine stromal cells remains to be determined .
the fgfs exert their paracrine responses by binding to fgfrs on the surface of the target cells and activating the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway .
it is well documented that signaling via fgfrs leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the docking protein frs2 , followed by the recruitment of multiple distinct complexes , which results in activation of ras / erk / map kinase and / or pi3 kinase / akt signaling pathways in a variety of cell types [ 33 ] , [ 35 ] .
in uteri lacking msx1 and msx2 , the accumulation in the uterine epithelium of phospho - frs2 , a key indicator of fgf signaling , indicated activation of fgfr signaling .
bazer and his coworkers have previously reported that the fgfrs are activated in ovine uterine epithelia of sheep in response to the secretion of fgf7 and fgf10 from the progesterone - primed mesenchyme and proposed that these factors are potential regulators of the maternal - fetal interactions [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] .
however , in the mouse uterus , the expression of fgf10 , fgf18 , and fgf21 is suppressed during the receptive phase of implantation .
the expression of these factors is induced in the absence of msx1 and msx2 , and the consequent increase in fgfr signaling is associated with the lack of uterine receptivity and implantation failure in msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice .
the central hypothesis of this paper is that msx1 / msx2 controls uterine receptivity at the time of embryo implantation by regulating epithelial function .
during normal pregnancy in mice , the uterus attains receptive status on day 4 of gestation when the luminal and glandular epithelia cease to proliferate and begin to differentiate .
our study suggests that , in the absence of msx1 and msx2 , the uterine stroma produces a subset of fgfs , which act via the fgfrs to stimulate the erk1 / 2 kinase pathway in both luminal and glandular epithelia .
as a consequence , the uterine epithelia of msx1d / dmsx2d / d mice remain proliferative and fail to undergo transformation to the receptive state that allows embryo attachment to initiate implantation .
the activation of the erk1 / 2 pathway in the epithelium also triggers phosphorylation of epithelial esr1 at serine - 118 .
it is well established that this phosphorylation event is critical for the transcriptional activation of esr1 [ 14 ] .
an elevated esr1 signaling in the epithelium is , however , detrimental to the implantation process .
for example , esr1 promotes the expression of muc - 1 , a well - known cell surface glycoprotein , which creates a barrier that prevents embryo attachment .
in mice , high levels of muc - 1 are present in the non - receptive uterus on days 1 and 2 of pregnancy .
as the pregnancy progresses , muc - 1 expression declines in the epithelium and it is drastically reduced on day 4 at the time of implantation [ 21 ] .
therefore , the reduction of muc - 1 expression is considered a sign of uterine receptivity in mice .
the persistence of high levels of muc - 1 in the msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri on day 4 of pregnancy is indicative of hyperestrogenic activity in the luminal epithelium and , consequently , reflects a lack of uterine receptivity .
pathways downstream of msx1 and msx2 also control the synthesis of glandular factors critical for uterine receptivity at the time of implantation .
while the uterine luminal epithelium is the initial site of embryo attachment , the glandular epithelium is an important source of paracrine factors required for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy [ 45 ] .
as uterus acquires competency for implantation , the glandular epithelial cells cease to proliferate and undergo differentiation to express factors , such as lif and foxa2 , which are critical for embryo implantation [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
presumably due to enhanced wnt and fgf signaling in msx1d / dmsx2d / d uteri , the glandular epithelial cells remain proliferative and fail to express lif and foxa2 .
consistent with this hypothesis , a recent study has shown that expression of constitutively active beta - catenin in mouse endometrium leads to enhanced proliferation and glandular hyperplasia [ 46 ] .
we recently reported that the transcription factor hand2 suppresses the production of a subset of fgfs , which act in a paracrine manner to stimulate the proliferation of the luminal epithelium [ 11 ] .
conditional deletion of hand2 in the uterus also results in the failure of implantation due to impaired uterine receptivity caused by increased production of fgfs in the stroma .
the uterine phenotype of hand2 deletion is remarkably similar to those of msx1 / msx2 ablation .
we , therefore , examined whether hand2 is regulated by msx1 / msx2 or vice versa .
surprisingly , our studies showed that msx1 / msx2 expression is unaltered in hand2 - null uteri ( figure s5 ) .
similarly , the loss of msx1 or msx2 or both did not affect hand2 expression in the uterus during implantation ( figure s6 ) .
furthermore , while hand2 coordinately suppresses the expression of fgf1 , fgf2 , fgf9 and fgf18 , msx1 / msx2 inhibits the expression of fgf1 , fgf10 , fgf18 , and fgf21 .
although these results suggest that one or more of these fgfs act in a paracrine manner through the epithelial fgfrs to promote epithelial cell proliferation , the contribution of each these fgfs is unclear and , therefore , it remains to be determined whether hand2 and msx1 / msx2 function via similar or distinct mechanisms .
in summary , we have uncovered a novel mechanism by which msx1 / msx2 regulates epithelial function at the time of implantation .
in normal pregnancy , these factors act to repress wnt and beta - catenin signaling and inhibit fgf synthesis in the uterine stroma , thereby attenuating the paracrine mechanisms that promote epithelial proliferation .
it is also evident that the activation of erk1 / 2 kinase pathway downstream of fgfr signaling in the epithelium of msx1msx2 - ablated uteri activates transcriptional function of esr1 , contributing to the non - receptive status of the uterus ( figure 7 ) .
continued analysis of the mechanisms by which msx1 and msx2 control the wnt - beta - catenin - fgf pathway to direct uterine stromal - epithelial communication will clarify our understanding of the molecular events that underlie uterine receptivity .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1002500.g007 figure 7 mechanism of msx1 and msx2 action in mouse uterus .
in normal pregnancy , msx1 and msx2 act to repress wnt and beta - catenin signaling and inhibit fgf synthesis in the uterine stroma , thereby suppressing stromal - epithelial cross - talk .
in the absence of msx1 and msx2 , fgfs are induced , activating the epithelial fgfr - erk1 / 2 pathway , and promoting epithelial proliferation .
activated erk1 / 2 then phosphorylates epithelial esr1 .
this triggers transcriptional activation of esr1 and expression of its target genes , such as muc - 1 , which prevent the functional transformation of the luminal epithelium to receptive state , blocking embryo implantation .

alpha1 - microglobulin ( a1m ) is a 26 kda plasma and tissue protein with reductase activity and radical - and heme - binding anti - oxidative functions .
in addition , exposure of a1m to hemoglobin has been shown to induce proteolytic elimination of a c - terminal tetrapeptide yielding a heme - degrading form , truncated a1m ( t - a1m ) .
myeloperoxidase ( mpo ) , a heme - containing enzyme that catalyzes the production of free radicals and hypochlorite , is released by neutrophils during the inflammatory response to bacterial infections .
mpo - induced low density lipoprotein ( ldl ) - oxidation in blood has been suggested as a causative factor in atherosclerosis .
in this study we have hypothesized that a1m interacts with mpo in a similar mode as with hemoglobin , and is a regulator of its activity .
the results show that a1m is proteolytically cleaved , with formation of t - a1m , after exposure to mpo , and that t - a1m contains iron and heme - degradation products .
the reaction is dependent of ph , time and concentration of substrates and a ph - value around 7 is shown to be optimal for cleavage .
furthermore , a1m inhibits mpo - and hydrogen peroxide - induced oxidation of ldl .
the results suggest that a1m may have a role as an inhibitor of the damaging effects of the neutrophil respiratory burst on bystander tissue components .
alpha1 - microglobulin myeloperoxidase low density lipoprotein c - terminal proteolysis heme binding neutrophils introduction the heme - containing enzyme myeloperoxidase ( mpo ) is a cationic dimer with a molecular mass of 146 kda .
the enzyme is stored in azurophil granules of non - stimulated neutrophils and participates in killing of microorganisms during phagocytosis ( nauseef and malech , 1986 ; malle et al. , 2007 ) .
the enzyme catalyzes the conversion of hydrogen peroxide and chloride to the bactericidal compound hypochlorous acid / hypochlorite ( malle et al. , 2007 ) .
mpo is a major component of the azurophil granules and is released into the extracellular compartment when de - granulation of the neutrophil is induced by various stimuli ( farschou and borregaard , 2003 ) .
hypochlorite and free radicals are important weapons against bacteria , but they also have the negative effect of oxidizing by - stander tissue components ( winrow et al. , 1993 ; klebanoff , 2005 ) .
mpo and the reactive intermediates it generates have been identified in atherosclerotic lesions and mpo may thus contribute to the oxidation of low density lipoproteins ( ldl ) that ultimately leads to atherosclerosis ( daugherty et al. , 1994 ) .
alpha1 - microglobulin ( a1m ) , also called protein hc , a plasma and tissue protein with antioxidative properties , was first discovered in human urine about 40 years ago ( ekstrom et al. , 1975 ) .
it has a mass of 26 kda , consists of 183 amino acid residues , and has been identified in a wide range of other species ( akerstrom and gram , 2014 ) .
a1m is a member of the lipocalin family of structurally related proteins in bacteria , plants and animals ( akerstrom et al. , 2006 ) .
the recently published crystal structure shows that the protein consists of an eight - stranded , anti - parallel beta - barrel with a highly conserved cysteine residue in position 34 located in a loop near the open top of the beta - barrel ( meining and skerra , 2012 ) .
the lipocalin pocket inside the beta - barrel serves as a ligand - binding entity in many of the lipocalins ( flower , 1996 ) .
a1m is synthesized and secreted from liver and most other epithelial cells , and present in blood and all tissues at remarkably constant concentrations , 1 - 2 mum ( demars et al. , 1989 ) .
the protein is found in blood and tissues both in free form and bound to immunoglobulin a , albumin or prothrombin ( berggard et al. , 1997 ) .
a1m has been suggested to have a physiological function as a cell and tissue protective antioxidant that operates by clearing extravascular fluids of free radicals and heme groups ( reviewed in olsson et al. , 2012 ; akerstrom and gram , 2014 ) .
to achieve this , a1m employs enzymatic reductase , radical - scavenging , and heme - binding properties ( allhorn et al. , 2002 , 2005 ; larsson et al. , 2004 ; akerstrom et al. , 2007 ) .
several recent publications demonstrate that a1m indeed has powerful protective effects in vivo and in vitro against oxidative damage from free radicals , extracellular hemoglobin and free heme groups released during hemolysis ( olsson et al. , 2008 , 2011 ; may et al. , 2011 ; rutardottir et al. , 2013 ; rosenlof et al. , 2014 ; sverrisson et al. , 2014 ) .
hemolysis and release of free hemoglobin occurring in different pathological states results in generation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) by autooxidation of the oxy - hemoglobin molecule , and in increased levels of free heme ( olsson et al. , 2012 ) .
free heme and ros contributes to oxidation , covalent cross - linking and aggregation of proteins , induce oxidative dna - lesions , and catalyze the formation of cytotoxic lipid peroxidation ( kumar and bandyopadhyay , 2005 ) .
heme has been shown to be a pro - inflammatory molecule in pathological conditions like renal failure , atherosclerosis and heart transplant failure ( kumar and bandyopadhyay , 2005 ) .
the heme - binding by a1m thus contributes to its antioxidative protective effects .
the ability of a1m to bind heme has also been observed in four other mammals and fish ( larsson et al. , 2004 ) .
when exposed to purified hemoglobin or lysed erythrocytes , a truncated a1m ( t - a1m ) is formed , lacking the c - terminal tetrapeptide lipr ( allhorn et al. , 2002 ) .
the presence of t - a1m in human urine indicates that this reaction occurs in vivo .
t - a1m binds heme similar to full - length a1m but also shows a time - dependent spectral rearrangement indicating degradation of heme and formation of a heterogeneous chromophore .
in this work , we hypothesized that a1m , due to its heme - binding and reductive biochemical properties , can protect bystanding cells and molecules from oxidative damage by mpo .
to approach this question , we have investigated the reactions occurring between mpo and a1m and the effects of a1m on the oxidation of ldl by mpo .
materials and methods proteins and reagents recombinant human a1m with an n - terminal his8 - tag was expressed in e. coli , purified and refolded as described by kwasek et al .

to study cleavage efficiency , a1m ( 0.195 mg / ml ) was mixed with different concentrations of mpo ( 0 , 0.3 , and 1 mg / ml ) in incubation buffer .
the samples were incubated at 37degreesc for 1 , 4 , and 24 h. after incubation , each sample was run on a 10 % sds - page under reducing conditions .
the same procedure was performed with another heme - containing control protein , catalase , instead of mpo .
samples with 0.195 mg / ml a1m and 0.1 mg / ml mpo were also mixed in buffers of different ph ( 0.3 m naac , ph 4 ; 0.3 m naac , ph 5 ; 0.3 m napi , ph 6 ; 0.3 m napi , ph 7 ; 0.3 m napi , ph 8 ; 0.3 m glycine - oh , ph 9 ) , incubated at 37degreesc for 1 h and then run on a 12 % sds - page under reducing conditions .
the amounts of non - cleaved and cleaved a1m were estimated by densitometry of the bands using imagej 1.47v software ( national institutes of health , usa ) .
electrophoresis and western blotting sds - page was performed using the protocol of laemmli ( 1970 ) .
samples were mixed with sample buffer containing 2 % ( v / v ) mercaptoethanol , boiled for approximately 1 min and applied to 12 % linear , or 4 - 20 % gradient polyacrylamide criterion ( tm ) tgx ( tm ) precast gels ( biorad ) .

protein identification by mass spectrometry peptide mapping and sequencing analysis the protein analysis was performed by alphalyse a / s ( odense , denmark ) .
briefly , the protein samples were reduced and carbamidomethylated , and subsequently digested with trypsin .
the resulting peptides were concentrated on a ziptip micropurification column and eluted onto an anchorchip target for analysis on a bruker autoflex speed maldi tof / tof instrument .
maldi ms / ms was performed on 15 peptides for partial sequencing .
the ms and ms / ms spectra were combined and used for database searching .
the data were searched against in - house protein databases downloaded from nbci , including the nrdb database .
ion exchange chromatography of a1m / mpo samples a 100 mul sample with a1m and mpo , both 1.2 mg / ml in incubation buffer , was incubated for 48 h at room temperature , and then analyzed by ion exchange chromatography , using an fplc system ( aktaprime plus , ge healthcare , uk ) with a mono - q column washed with 20 mm tris - hcl , ph 8 .
the proteins were eluted with 20 mm tris - hcl , ph 8 by a 0 - 100 % 0.5 m nacl - gradient and absorbance was measured at wavelengths of 280 and 405 nm. the same procedure was performed with pure a1m and mpo separately in the same amounts .
fractions corresponding to the observed absorbance peaks were separated by 12 % sds - page with mercaptoethanol .
fractions containing a1m that had reacted with mpo were analyzed by absorbance scanning between 250 and 750 nm on a beckman ( beckman instruments , fullerton , ca ) du 800 spectrophotometer using a scan rate of 1200 nm / min .
absorbance scanning was also performed on pure a1m and mpo for comparison .
proton - induced x - ray emission ( pixe ) analysis samples for proton - induced x - ray emission analysis were prepared as follows .
chromatography fractions in 20 mm tris - hcl , ph 8.0 + 0.1 - 0.2 m nacl , containing a1m in concentrations determined by uv - absorbance , were added to a kimfoil membrane ( kimberley clark ) mounted on a plastic frame and allowed to dry .
at the lund nuclear microprobe facility ( malmqvist et al. , 1993 ) , the samples were placed in a vacuum irradiation chamber and bombarded with a 1 na proton beam , with an energy of 2.55 mev and accumulating a beam charge of 0.6 muc .
the characteristic x - rays emitted ( johansson and campbell , 1988 ) were detected using a ketek axas - m h50 sdd silicon drift x - ray detector , while data were collected using kmax ( sparrow ) software ( elfman et al. , 1997 ) .
elemental standards ( fe ) were analyzed in the same way to verify quantification .
neutrophil granulocyte isolation and cultivation buffy coat from a healthy donor was mixed with an equal volume of 2 % dextran in 0.9 % nacl and erythrocytes were allowed to sediment .
the supernatant was aspirated and centrifuged at 200 g for 10 min at 4degreesc and the resulting pellet resuspended in 0.9 % nacl .
the resuspension was layered on top of half the volume of lymphoprep , centrifuged at 400 g for 25 min and the supernatant removed .
erythrocytes were lysed by addition of ice - cold h2o and the neutrophils were washed once with 1.8 % nacl centrifuged at 200 g for 6 min and washed twice with 0.9 % nacl .
the cells were resuspended in krebs ringer glucose - buffer ( 106 cells / ml ) and cultured for 20 h at 37degreesc with or without addition of 1 mum ionomycin and 0.1 mg / ml a1m .
the cells were spun down and the supernatants analyzed by 12 % sds - page with mercaptoethanol and western blotting with anti - a1m antibodies as described above .
supernatants from overnight cultures were also mixed with a1m ( 0.1 mg / ml ) and / or pmsf ( 1 mm ) , after centrifugation and separation of the cells , followed by sds - page and western blotting .
low density lipoprotein oxidation inhibition and reduction oxidation inhibition and reduction of oxidized ldl was measured by the thiobarbituric acid ( tba ) method described by gutteridge ( 1977 ) .
( 1 ) oxidation : 0.2 mg / ml ldl were incubated with 8 mm h2o2 and a dilution series of mpo ( 25 - 100 mug / ml ) in a total volume of 200 mul pbs at 24degreesc for 2 h .
( 2 ) inhibition : 0.2 mg / ml ldl were incubated with 8 mm h2o2 , 100 mug / ml mpo or albumin and a1m ( 8 , 20 mum ) in a total volume of 200 mul pbs at 24degreesc for 2 h .
3 ) reduction : 0.2 mg / ml ldl were incubated with 8 mm h2o2 , 100 mug / ml mpo in pbs at 24degreesc for 2 h , then different dilutions of a1m ( 1 - 10 mum ) were added in a total volume of 200 mul pbs and the samples were incubated at 24degreesc for 1 h. all samples ( 200 mul / sample ) were mixed with tba - reagent ( 0.5 % 2 - thiobarbituric acid and 0.5 % sds in h2o ) , 0.25 ml , and 0.2 m glycine - hcl , ph 3.6 , 0.29 ml ( girotti and thomas , 1984 ) , was then added and the mixture heated to 95degreesc for 15 min .
the absorbance at 550 nm was read after cooling to room temperature and centrifugation 3000 rpm / 15 min .
origin 9.0 software ( originlab corporation , northampton , ma , usa ) was used to analyze the data .
results formation of t - a1m by reaction with mpo a1m and mpo were mixed at the molar ratio 6:1 , incubated for 1 and 24 h and analyzed by sds - page under reducing conditions .
as can be seen in figure 1a , a faster - migrating , truncated form of a1m was seen after interaction with mpo , indicating a proteolytic cleavage .
the truncated form was similar in size to t - a1m previously shown to be formed by interaction with hemoglobin ( allhorn et al. , 2002 ) .
the mpo - molecule was seen as two bands corresponding to the two subunit chains of the protein ( nauseef and malech , 1986 ) .
a larger proportion of a1m was cleaved in the long - duration reaction ( 24 h ) , compared to the short - duration reaction ( 1 h ) , suggesting a time dependent activity .
this difference in cleavage was confirmed by the presence of two bands in the lane with a1m from the 1 h - reaction , where all a1m still had not reacted with mpo .
sds - page under non - reducing conditions of the samples yielded similar results ( not shown ) .
non - denaturing page was run on the same samples ( figure 1b ) and shows separation based on both size and the net - charges of mpo and a1m .
two a1m - bands were seen , probably representing monomer and dimer .
a clear increase of the net negative charge and / or decrease in size of a1m was seen after incubation with mpo as compared to a1m alone .
incubation of a1m with heme also yielded a third band with slower migration and thus decreased net negative charge ( not shown ) , probably as a result of attachment of porphyrin and its iron to a1m .
figure 1 mpo - induced proteolytic cleavage of a1m .
lane 1 contains 3 mug a1m and lane 2 and 3 both contain 3 mug a1m mixed with 3 mug mpo in incubation buffer , incubated for 1 and 24 h respectively .
( a ) sds - page with mercaptoethanol .
( b ) non - denaturing page without mercaptoethanol .
to determine if the cleavage product is t - a1m , defined as a1m without its c - terminal tetrapeptide lipr ( allhorn et al. , 2002 ) , a mixture of the two proteins with the molar ratio 1:6 ( mpo : a1m ) was incubated for 4 h. the cleavage products and non - cleaved a1m were analyzed by sds - page and analyzed for total protein ( figure 2a ) and by immunoblotting using anti - lipr ( figure 2b ) antibodies .
as expected , both forms of a1m were detected after coomassie staining , while the anti - lipr antibody only bound to full - length a1m .
finally , the two bands , i.e. , cleaved and non - cleaved a1m - bands were analyzed by trypsin cleavage and mass - spectrometry after excision from the gel , confirming that lipr was missing in the smaller band .
these results demonstrated that a1m was cleaved by mpo in a similar reaction as with hemoglobin ( allhorn et al. , 2002 ) .
figure 2 western blotting of a1m before and after mpo - induced cleavage .
the samples , 0.1 mug of full - length a1m , mpo and a mixture of a1m / mpo , 0.1 mug of each , incubated for 4 h , were separated on a 12 % sds - page prior to transfer to a pvdf - membrane and blotting .
( a ) staining with coomassie .
( b ) immunoblot with anti - lipr antibodies .
a1m cleavage is dependent on concentration , time and ph cleavage efficiency was measured in a mix of a1m at 0.195 mg / ml with different concentrations of mpo ( 0 mg / ml , 0.3 mg / ml , and 1 mg / ml ) , and different incubation times ( 1 , 4 , and 24 h ) .
the results after sds - page ( figure 3a ) showed increasing cleavage of a1m with higher concentrations of mpo and longer incubation times .
when comparing the lanes containing mpo at 1 mg / ml , bands for both truncated and full - length a1m was clearly seen in the gel with samples incubated for 1 h ( figure 3a ) .
the cleavage was also time - dependent , i.e. , more a1m was cleaved with time ( 4 and 24 h ; figure 3a ) and after 24 h only the t - a1m band was seen , suggesting that all a1m had reacted with mpo .
a faint t - a1m band was seen with no mpo present .
this could be explained by some cleavage of a1m in the e. coli where a1m was expressed .
as a control , another heme - containing protein , catalase , was incubated with a1m under similar conditions ( figure 3b ) .
this did not yield any cleavage of a1m as seen by sds - page .
the efficiency of cleavage was also tested at different ph - values ( figure 4 ) using 1 h incubation time and a molar ratio of a1m and mpo of 1:3 .
the mixtures were separated by sds - page and the relative amounts of the two bands were estimated by densitometry after coomassie staining .
as can be seen from figure 4 , most a1m cleavage occurred in the ph range 6 - 8 indicating that a1m activity is most efficient at physiological ph. a lower degree of cleavage was observed at ph 4 , 5 , and 9 .
figure 3 time - and concentration dependence of mpo - induced cleavage of a1m .
( a ) a1m ( 0.195 mg / ml ) was incubated with mpo at concentrations of 0 , 0.3 , or 1 mg / ml for 1 , 4 , or 24 h at room - temperature .
ten microliters of the samples were separated on a 12 % sds - page gel in the presence of mercaptoethanol , and then stained with coomassie .
one representative experiment is shown .
( b ) a similar experiment with bovine catalase under the same conditions was performed .
figure 4 ph - dependence of mpo - induced cleavage of a1m .
a1m was mixed with mpo at a concentration of 0.195 mg / ml and 0.1 mg / ml respectively , in buffers with different ph. the samples were incubated for 1 h at 37degreesc .
ten microliters of the samples were then separated by sds - page on 12 % gels in the presence of mercaptoethanol .
the gels were stained with coomassie and quantified by densitometry as described in materials and methods .
one representative experiment is shown .
heme group of mpo is transferred to a1m to analyze the reaction products in more detail , a1m and mpo were incubated at ph 8 for 48 h at the molar ratio 6:1 and then separated by ion exchange chromatography , eluting the proteins by a salt concentration gradient .
as a control , a1m and mpo alone were subjected to the same procedure ( not shown ) .
the eluates were analyzed by absorbance at 280 and 405 nm ( figures 5a,b ) and by sds - page ( figure 5c ) .
the a1m / mpo mix was eluted as three peaks and , as shown by sds - page , the first two peaks contained mpo and the third peak contained t - a1m .
pure a1m is eluted at a slightly lower salt concentration than a1m that had reacted with mpo , which again indicated an increase in net negative charge .
absorbance scanning showed a maximum at 280 nm in all samples ( figure 5d ) , and another absorbance maximum , at 410 - 420 nm , was observed in samples with pure mpo and a1m that had reacted with mpo , but not with pure a1m .
this maximum , a soret band , is characteristic for the heme group ( allhorn et al. , 2002 ) , and indicates the presence of heme / porphyrins in mpo as well as in a1m derived from the mixture .
the absorbance spectra suggested that the heme / porphyrin group was transferred from mpo to a1m when a1m reacts with mpo .
figure 5 ion exchange chromatography of an a1m / mpo mixture .
( a ) a1m and mpo ( mol : mol , 6:1 ) were incubated at room temperature for 48 h and applied to a mono - q column .
the column was eluted with a 0 - 0.5 m sodium chloride gradient in 20 mm tris - hcl , ph 8 .
fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and absorbance at 280 and 405 nm measured .
( b ) as a comparison , the same procedure was done on a sample with pure a1m .
( c ) sds - page analysis of the peak - fractions , marked 1 - 4 in ( a,b ) , obtained after ion exchange chromatography of the a1m / mpo mix and the pure a1m sample .
( d ) absorbance scanning between 250 and 750 nm of fractions obtained after ion exchange chromatography of the a1m / mpo mix shown to contain t - a1m by sds - page in ( c ) ( lane 3 ) .
as a comparison , the same procedure was done on a sample with pure a1m and mpo .
( e ) size - exclusion chromatography on superose 12 of a mixture of a1m and mpo ( molar ratio 6:1 ) , incubated at room - temperature for 48 h , followed by analysis of a1m ( absorbance and sds - page ) and iron content measured by pixe in selected fractions .
the a1m - concentrations are given after dilution three times , for optimal illustration .
iron analysis of the fractions from the ion - exchange chromatography showed the presence of iron in the peak a1m - fraction at a molar ratio of 1:4 ( fe : a1m ; not shown ) .
the a1m + mpo mixture was also separated by gel chromatography on superose 12 followed by iron analysis of the fractions ( figure 5e ) .
also in this case , the a1m - containing fractions showed correlated iron and a1m concentrations , and the a1m - peak fractions show a molar ratio of 1:10 ( fe : a1m ) .
these results suggest that the heme - group bound by a1m partially contains the iron - atom .
a1m is cleaved after incubation in neutrophil medium neutrophils extracted from buffy coat of a healthy donor were mixed with 0.1 mg / ml a1m in pbs in order to determine whether a1m would be cleaved by cellular mpo released into the culture medium .
ionomycin , 1 mum , was also added to some samples to induce degranulation .
sds - page of the medium after 3 and 24 h ( figure 6 ) shows that t - a1m is formed in the medium , and the cleavage was complete after 3 h , even without ionomycin - induced degranulation .
after degranulation , the presence of mpo in the medium can be seen as two bands , and was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using anti - mpo antibodies ( not shown ) .
t - a1m is also seen after ionomycin - induced degranulation , but at lower concentrations , suggesting that proteolytic degradation of the protein occurs .
after 24 h , smaller amounts of t - a1m is seen with or without ionomycin - addition , again indicating proteolytic degradation .
addition of a1m to the cell supernatants alone , i.e. , after centrifugation and removal of the cells , also resulted in the formation of t - a1m ( not shown ) .
addition of the serine protease inhibitor pmsf , 1 mm , in order to reduce possible interactions between a1m and the potent neutrophil serine proteases did not prevent the cleavage of a1m .

the left lanes show a1m ( 0.1 mg / ml ) incubated in fresh medium , the middle lanes show a1m incubated with neutrophil culture medium ( 0.1 mg / ml ) , and the right lanes show a1m ( 0.1 mg / ml ) incubated with culture medium together with neutrophils activated by ionomycin .
culture conditions are described in materials and methods .
left panel , incubation for 3 h , and right panel shows the same procedure but with 24 h incubation .
a1m inhibits ldl oxidation by mpo ldl , in the presence of h2o2 , was oxidized in a dose dependent fashion by mpo after 2 h incubation ( figure 7a ) , as measured by the tba assay .
the oxidation was inhibited by a1m added to the reaction mixture ( figure 7b ) .
the tba - signal was reduced to below the values of non - oxidized ldl by the addition of a1m , and a1m alone also had some reducing effects on non - oxidized ldl .
to analyze whether a1m also had any effect on ldl after the oxidation - reaction had occurred , the protein was added only after 2 h preincubation of mpo with ldl .
as seen in figure 7c , a dose - dependent reduction of the tba - signal was seen , suggesting that a1m was able to reduce the pre - oxidized ldl .
figure 7 a1m inhibits mpo - induced oxidation of ldl .
( a ) ldl , 0.2 mg / ml , was incubated with 8 mm h2o2 and a dilution series of mpo ( 25 - 100 mug / ml ) in a total volume of 200 mul pbs at 24degreesc for 2 h followed by tbars analysis .
( b ) ldl , 0.2 mg / ml , was incubated with 8 mm h2o2 , 100 mug / ml mpo and albumin or a1m ( 8 , 20 mum ) in a total volume of 200 mul pbs at 24degreesc for 2 h followed by tbars analysis .
( c ) ldl , 0.2 mg / ml , was incubated with 8 mm h2o2 , 100 mug / ml mpo in pbs at 24degreesc .
after 2 h , a dilution series of a1m ( 1 - 10 mum ) was added in a total volume of 200 mul pbs , and the samples were incubated at 24degreesc for 1 h followed by tbars analysis .
results are from triplicate experiments and presented as mean +/ - sd. discussion the results of this study show that a1m undergoes a similar reaction with mpo as previously shown with hemoglobin ( allhorn et al. , 2002 ) .
the reaction resulted in proteolytic cleavage of a1m , loss of the c - terminal tetrapeptide , lipr , and formation of a truncated form of a1m , called t - a1m .
catalase , another heme - containing protein , did not induce formation of t - a1m , suggesting that the cleavage reaction is specific for hemoglobin and mpo .
the absorbance spectrum of t - a1m after the reaction with mpo suggests that the heme group is transferred from mpo to a1m .
also in this respect , the reaction is similar to the reaction between a1m and hemoglobin ( allhorn et al. , 2002 ) .
analysis of the cleaved a1m after purification from mpo suggests that iron is still bound to the porphyrin , but at a lower than 1:1 molar ratio .
this is supported by the presence of a soret band in t - a1m , which is an indicator of chelated iron .
in spite of this , the net negative charge of t - a1m was increased , as shown by native page as well as ion exchange chromatography .
part of this increase could be explained by a loss of the positively charged c - terminal tetrapeptide lipr , but it is also possible that other modifications of a1m are induced by the reaction with mpo .
a1m has previously been shown to bind heme - groups in the molar ratio 1:2 ( a1m : heme ) ( siebel et al. , 2012 ) , and analysis by native page showed that the a1m : heme complex had an increased net negative charge ( karnaukhova et al. , 2014 ) .
in vivo , the lysyl side groups in positions 92 , 118 , and 130 are covalently modified on a1m from plasma and urine , and the modified protein is brown - colored and has increased negative charge and charge - heterogeneity ( calero et al. , 1996 ; berggard et al. , 1999 ; sala et al. , 2004 ) .
thus , heterogeneous modifications of these lysine residues as a result of the reaction with the heme - group could possibly explain the increased net negative charge after binding the heme - group .
in contrast to hemoglobin , the heme - group in mpo is covalently bound to the protein by two ester linkages as well as a sulfonium ion linkage ( fiedler et al. , 2000 ) , suggesting that a different mechanism is involved when heme is transferred from mpo to a1m compared to the heme - transfer from hemoglobin .
it can be speculated , however , that similar heme degrading mechanisms are involved once the heme - group has been incorporated to the a1m protein .
cleavage of a1m was also observed after incubation with cultured neutrophil granulocytes ( figure 6 ) .
the formation of t - a1m in the culture medium could be verified using anti - lipr antibodies ( not shown ) .
addition of ionomycin to the neutrophils to induce azurophil degranulation and release of mpo as well as proteolytic enzymes resulted in large amounts of mpo in the culture medium .
however , the concentration of t - a1m was lower after degranulation , indicating that non - specific proteolytic degradation of a1m was taking place after degranulation .
likewise , longer incubation times , 24 h , also resulted in proteolytic loss of the a1m protein .
taken together , the results suggest that a1m can be proteolytically activated by non - degranulated neutrophils .
in vivo , t - a1m has been detected in several different physiological tissue fluids , including blood , urine and extravascular fluids ( lopez et al. , 1982 ; allhorn et al. , 2002 , 2003 ) .
it has been speculated that t - a1m results from proteolytic cleavage of full - length a1m induced by free hemoglobin in the tissues , originating from hemolysis .
the results in this paper indicate that neutrophil - derived mpo also may participate in the formation of t - a1m in vivo .
for example , t - a1m is known to be present in inflamed tissue in chronic ulcers ( allhorn et al. , 2003 ) .
its role in this context is unknown but the inhibition of mpo - induced oxidation of ldl , as shown in figure 7 , suggests that it may be involved in down - regulating the oxidative stress of hypochlorite and free radicals , synthesized by mpo during the respiratory burst ( klebanoff , 2005 ) .
therefore , a1m may be part of a defense mechanism protecting bystander tissues from oxidative damage by the oxidative burst of neutrophils .
such a novel down - regulatory mechanism of inflammation may play a role in a wide range of diseases , such as atherosclerosis , multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis , etc .
figure 8 summarizes a tentative physiological a1m - dependent mechanism for protection of ldl and bystander tissues against oxidation from neutrophil oxidative burst .
several potential mechanisms may explain how a1m achieves the protection of the ldl - particles .
the cleavage of a1m and the binding and degradation of the heme - group indicates that a1m can disarm the mpo - enzyme by " stealing " its heme - group .
previous publications on a1m have shown that it also is a radical scavenger ( akerstrom et al. , 2007 ) and it reasonable to hypothesize that the protein also may operate by " scavenging ," or binding , the free radicals and hypochlorite generated by mpo .
it was also shown in this work that oxidized or non - oxidized ldl - particles could be reduced by a1m even after the formation of oxidized modifications ( figure 7c ) .
this is analogous to a similar effect of a1m on collagen fibrils : incubation of heme - or hydrogen peroxide - oxidized collagen with a1m resulted in a reduced amount of the oxidation product carbonyl groups ( olsson et al. , 2011 ; rutardottir et al. , 2013 ) .
mechanistically , this " cleaning " effect could be explained by the previously reported reductase activity of a1m ( allhorn et al. , 2005 ) , i.e. , that a1m could chemically reduce the oxidation products in the macromolecules .
figure 8 tentative function of a1m in protection against bystander oxidative damage caused by neutrophils .
the figure summarizes the findings of this paper in a physiological context .
recruitment and activation of neutrophils during inflammation involves mpo - mediated bacterial killing but may also yield ldl - oxidation as a side - effect .
( 1 ) neutrophil culture medium or purified mpo induces heme - binding of a1m , and proteolytic cleavage of the protein which was previously shown to activate a heme - degradation activity of a1m ( allhorn et al. , 2002 ) .
( 2 ) the induced heme - degradation mechanism of a1m is tentatively " disarming " the peroxidase , preventing oxidative burst .
( 3 ) ldl - oxidation by mpo is inhibited by a1m , and pre - formed oxidation products on ldl are reduced .
conclusion mpo induces cleavage of lipr from a1m in a time - , concentration - and ph - dependent manner which suggests that heme is transferred from mpo to a1m .
a1m can also protect ldl against oxidative damage caused by mpo and may thus have an important role in preventing the formation of atherosclerosis .
further investigations are needed to clarify detailed mechanisms involved in the reactions between mpo and a1m , and may also reveal a correlation between a1m , mpo and patients with cardiovascular diseases .

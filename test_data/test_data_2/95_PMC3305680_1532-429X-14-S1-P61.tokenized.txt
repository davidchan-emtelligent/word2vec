background animal models are important to develop our understanding of the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease and for the development of new therapies .
while coronary autoregulation maintains resting myocardial blood flow ( mbf ) constant over a wide range of pathological conditions , mbf reserve during hyperaemic stress is impaired in several common disease processes .
first pass contrast - enhanced myocardial perfusion is the standard cmr method for the estimation of mbf and mbf reserve in man , but is challenging in rodents because of the constraints related to the high temporal and spatial resolution requirements .
murine first pass myocardial perfusion at rest can be performed on a whole - body 3 tesla cmr system .
hyperaemic myocardial stress perfusion cmr in mice has however not been reported .
methods five healthy six month old c57bl / 6j mice were anaesthetized using 2 % isoflurane .
cmr imaging was performed on a clinical 3.0 tesla scanner ( philips healthcare , best , the netherlands ) with a 23mm single loop surface coil and a murine monitoring and ecg gating system ( sa instruments , usa ) .
vasodilator stress was induced using a slow injection of dipyrimadole via a tail vein catheter .
stress perfusion data were acquired with an injection of gadolinium contrast ( gadobutrol 0.5mmol / kg ) thirty seconds later .
the perfusion pulse sequence has been reported1 , in summary , it used a saturation recovery gradient echo method with 10 - fold k - space and time domain undersampling with constrained image reconstruction using temporal basis sets ( k - t pca ) to achieve a spatial resolution of 0.2 x 0.2 x 1.5mm3 and an acquisition window of 43ms .
following stress perfusion mice were recovered .
one week later the mice underwent repeat anaesthesia and stress testing with lv injections of fluorescent microspheres at rest and at stress .
microsphere images were analysed using confocal microscopy .
results data was acquired successfully in all five mice .
mean heart rate increased from 480 +/ - 27.4 bpm at rest to 503 +/ - 41.5 bpm ( p = 0.08 ) during vasodilatation .
mean myocardial blood flow at rest by fermi - function constrained deconvolution in control mice was 3.4 +/ - 0.5ml / g / min and increased to 8.9 +/ - 3.0ml / g / min during stress ( ratio 2.6:1 , p = 0.036 ) ( figure 2 a - d ) .
the mean count of microspheres increased from rest to stress by a ratio of 2.7:1 ( mean spheres per slice n = 27 +/ - 3.2 , n = 74 +/ - 18.5 , p = 0.0005 ) ( figure 1 ) .

figure 2 murine stress perfusion ( a )= rest ( b )= rv first pass ( c )= lv first pass ( d )= myocardial wash in. conclusions first - pass myocardial stress perfusion cmr in a mouse model is feasible .
although the quantification of myocardial blood was lower than published values , the trend in myocardial blood flow was consistent with existing literature .
data was acquired on a 3 tesla scanner using an approach similar to clinical acquisition protocols , thus facilitating translation of imaging findings between rodent and human studies to elucidate mechanisms and develop therapies for cardiovascular disease .

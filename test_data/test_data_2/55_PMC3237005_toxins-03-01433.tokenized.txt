2011 this article is an open - access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the creative commons attribution license ( http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 3.0 /). b. anthracis is a bioweapon of primary importance and its pathogenicity depends on its lethal and edema toxins , which belong to the a - b model of bacterial toxins , and on its capsule .
these toxins are secreted early in the course of the anthrax disease and for this reason antibiotics must be administered early , in addition to other limitations .
antibodies ( abs ) may however neutralize those toxins and target this capsule to improve anthrax treatment , and many abs have been developed in that perspective .
these abs act at various steps of the cell intoxication and their mechanisms of action are detailed in the present review , presented in correlation with structural and functional data .
the potential for clinical application is discussed for abs targeting each step of entry , with four of these molecules already advancing to clinical trials .
paradoxically , certain abs may also enhance the lethal toxin activity and this aspect will also be presented .
the unique paradigm of abs neutralizing anthrax toxins thus exemplifies how they may act to neutralize a - b toxins and , more generally , be active against infectious diseases .
anthrax toxins protective antigen lethal factor edema factor antibodies 1 .
introduction anthrax is caused by the gram - negative , spore forming bacterium bacillus anthracis .
this lethal disease is still endemic in some parts of the world , primarily to herbivores in the less - developed countries but can affect a wide range of species , including humans .
anthrax is considered a biological threat due to the historical weaponization of this agent since world war ii , in addition to recent events , particularly the intentional anthrax letter attacks in 2001 in the united states. b. anthracis is classified by the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) as a category a select agent , representing the biological agents most at risk of being weaponized [ 1 ]. b. anthracis pathogenesis depends on three virulence factors , the production of a protective capsule [ 2 ] and of two a - b toxins [ 3 ] .
the a - b ( or " binary ") bacterial toxins consist of a two component complex whose " b " subunit is responsible for cell surface binding , and the " a " subunit which is responsible for the enzymatic activity of the toxin [ 4 ] .
the anthrax toxins are composed of three different proteins , a single receptor - binding b - subunit , designated as protective antigen ( pa ) , and two alternative a - subunits , the lethal factor ( lf ) and the edema factor ( ef ) .
lf interacts with pa to form the lethal toxin ( lt ) and ef interacts with pa to form the edema toxin ( et ) [ 5 ] .
the crystal structure of pa83 has been resolved [ 6 ] ( figure 1 ) and shows four different domains , each playing a different role in the intoxication mechanism ( residues in this review are designated according to their numbering in three - dimensional structures ) .
domain i ( residues 1 - 258 ) contains the furin proteolysis site [ 6 ] , and the lf / ef binding site .
domain ii ( residues 259 - 487 ) is involved in heptamer and pore formation , and interacts with anthrax toxin receptors ( atrs ) [ 9,10 ] .
domain iii ( residues 488 - 595 ) is also involved in heptamer formation [ 11 ] .
domain iv ( residues 596 - 735 ) is essential in the recognition and binding to the cellular atrs [ 12,13 ] .
figure 1 structures of protective antigen ( pa ) , lethal factor ( lf ) and edema factor ( ef ) subunits .
pa structure has been obtained using file 1acc from the protein data bank [ 6 ] .
lf and ef structures are derived from the files 1j7n [ 7 ] and 1xfv [ 8 ] , respectively .
for each subunit , the different domains are identified on ribbon models and their respective function is indicated .
the color code utilized on ribbon models was re - utilized for schematic rendering .
toxin entry into host cells involves several steps .
first , pa in the form of an 83 - kda protein ( pa83 ) binds to atrs , the tumor endothelial marker 8 ( tem - 8 ) and the capillary morphogenesis protein - 2 ( cmg - 2 ) [ 14,15 ] .
pa83 amino - terminal 20 - kda region ( pa20 , residues 1 - 167 ) is then proteolytically cleaved by a furin - like protease and released ( figure 2 ) .
the pa63 fragment remains bound on cell surface and forms a homo - heptameric structure that binds ef or lf , and promotes their cell entry by a clathrin - dependant endocytosis .
lf is a zinc - dependent protease specific for the mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase family [ 16,17 ] and ef is a calmodulin - activated adenylyl cyclase [ 8,18 ] .
figure 2 the different steps of anthrax toxins entry , and their inhibition by antibodies .
( a ) various steps of anthrax toxins entry .
pa83 binds to its cell receptors and is processed by furin on the cell surface .
pa20 is released and pa63 remains attached to the receptor .
heptamerization of pa63 induces the formation of lf / ef binding site .
the toxin complex is then endocytosed .
( b ) inhibition of the various steps of anthrax toxins entry by abs .
neutralizing abs act at each entry step : binding of pa83 to its receptors ( 1 ) , pa83 cleavage by furin ( 2 ) , pa20 release ( 3 ) , pa63 heptamerization ( 4 ) , lf / ef binding to the heptamer by targeting pa ( 5 ) or lf / ef ( 6 ) , and endocytosis of the toxin ( 7 ) .
the crystallographic structure of lf has also been resolved ( figure 1 ) [ 7 ] .
lf is composed of four different domains .
domain i ( lfn ; residues 1 - 254 ) interacts with pa [ 19 ] .
domain ii ( residues 263 - 297 and 385 - 550 ) presents a pocket which captures its proteolysis substrate .
domain iii ( residues 303 - 382 ) , inserted within domain ii , plays a role in the enzymatic specificity [ 7,20 ] .
domain iv ( residues 552 - 776 ) contains the catalytic center ( hexxh ) , where the first h is localized at position 686 , e is localized at 735 and the last h is at position 690 .
the ef structure was the last to be resolved ( figure 1 ) [ 8 ] and it presents two functional domains , domain i ( efn , residues 1 - 291 ) and domain ii ( residues 292 - 798 ) .
efn interacts with pa in the same way as the lfn .
domain ii is responsible for the adenylate cyclase activity of ef , leading to an uncontrolled increase in intracellular camp concentration in host cells [ 8,18 ] .
antibodies ( abs ) against anthrax have historically demonstrated therapeutic potential and , in their recombinant form , represent several products currently advancing into clinical trials .
indeed , the first specific treatment of anthrax , achille sclavo 's serum , consisted of polyclonal antibodies .
this bovine derived product , used in the 1890 's , increased survival rates of cutaneous anthrax from 75 to 96 % [ 21 ] .
antibiotics have now replaced the abs as main molecules for anthrax treatment but they have limitations which , in turn , may be compensated by abs .
in effect , current antimicrobials ( fluoroquinolone , tetracycline or penicillin g ) [ 22,23 ] require early administration in order to provide protection , due to the rapid course of infection and toxins secretion after exposure to b. anthracis spores by the pulmonary route .
additionally , this treatment must be continued for 60 days .
following the 2001 anthrax letter attacks , the compliance for this treatment was only about 40 % [ 24,25 ] .
abs targeting anthrax toxins could be used to reduce this lengthy treatment time .
the natural emergence of antimicrobial resistant strains [ 26,27 ] , as well as resistant strains of anthrax obtained in vitro , demonstrates the need for alternate treatments [ 28,30 ] .
consequently , abs are generally expected to increase the therapeutic window , decrease the length of treatment , and overcome potential antibiotic resistant strains .
abs enabling these functions , by targeting the pathogenic mechanisms at various steps involving lt / et toxicity , will be reviewed in this article .
the current field of abs against anthrax includes multiple anti - pa abs under clinical testing as well as several anti - lf , anti - ef , and anti - capsule abs .
additionally the paradoxical role of abs , enhancing toxicity , will be briefly discussed. of note , the scope of the manuscript is not to correlate abs and vaccination , but rather how monoclonal and recombinant abs act .
2. antibodies neutralizing the anthrax toxins pa has been regarded as the most important target of neutralizing abs because ( i ) it plays a central role for the formation of both lt and et , ( ii ) it is involved at the earliest stages of the intoxication process , and ( iii ) vaccines composed of pa showed that pa - binding abs effectively limit b. anthracis pathogenicity .
several anti - pa monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) have been isolated and in certain cases , their neutralization mechanisms were studied .
interestingly , neutralizing abs directed against the four domains of pa were described , and neutralized at each step involving this subunit : pa interaction with atrs , pa proteolysis by furin and the release of pa20 , pa heptamerization , pa interaction with lf / ef , and the endocytosis of the toxin complex ( figure 2 ) .
as an alternative to anti - pa , abs against lf and ef have been considered .
these abs act at the latest stages of the toxin entry : the interaction of lf / ef with the heptamer and the endocytosis of lt / et. the protective efficacy of anti - lf abs has been shown in in vivo models of the disease , often with a better efficacy than anti - pa [ 31 ] .
2.1 .
antibodies inhibiting pa / receptors interaction the first anthrax toxin entry step involves the high affinity ( kd = 170 pm ) binding of pa to one of the two known atrs [ 32 ] ( figure 2 ) .
only the extracellular domain of these receptors , related to the von willebrand factor a ( vwfa ) domain [ 33 ] , is involved in the anthrax toxin entry .
the vwfa domains share 60 % of their amino acids , and include a metal ion - dependent adhesion site ( midas ) motif which is most likely involved in their interaction with pa. mutagenesis studies have shown that the carboxylate group of aspartate , at position 683 on pa , plays a critical role in the pa - receptors interaction by completing the coordination of midas [ 34 ] .
the x - ray crystal structure of pa complexed with the vwfa domain of cmg2 has been resolved and identified the four pa loops that are essential for atrs binding : the loop between residues 340 - 348 ( domain ii ) , between residues 654 - 662 , 681 - 688 , and 714 - 716 ( domain iv ) [ 9 ] .
the first mabs , whose neutralization properties were tested in vitro and in vivo , inhibited the interaction between pa and the vwfa domains of the atrs .
in particular , 14b7 , an ab with a high affinity ( kd = 0.33 nm ) , neutralized lt and et by blocking pa interaction with cells [ 35 ] .
in a study of 36 anti - pa mabs , only two were neutralizing : 3b6 and 14b7 .
competitive binding experiments have shown that 3b6 and 14b7 recognized the same epitope on pa. utilizing a mutagenesis strategy , the precise epitope of 14b7 was identified as residues 682 , 684 , 685 , 686 , 687 and 688 [ 13 ] ( see sequence alignment on figure 3 ) .
this neutralizing epitope corresponded to one of the four important loops on pa , involved in its interaction with atrs , thus explaining the high efficiently of 14b7 .
this loop was additionally targeted by other neutralizing abs such as 35pa83 , a macaque - derived ab of high affinity ( kd = 3.4 nm ) which neutralized lt in vitro ( ic50 = 5.6 nm ) [ 36 ] , and whose epitope have been localized between residues 686 and 694 by pepscan analysis. with the same technology , murine mabs 1 - f1 and 2 - b12 epitopes were precisely localized between residues 692 - 703 and 716 - 727 respectively , two regions that are immediately adjacent to the 14b7 binding site [ 37 ] .
the epitope of two chimpanzee abs , w1 and w2 , which prevented the binding of pa to raw265.7 cells , were localized between residues 614 - 735 and this region encompassed three of the four pa loops involved in the atrs interactions [ 38 ] .
identically , mab 7.5 bound to pa domain iv between residues 608 and 735 [ 39 ] .
several anti - pa abs , directed against domain iv of pa , act by inhibiting pa interaction with its cell receptors but their epitopes were not precisely mapped [ 31,40,41,42 ] .
these abs include raxibacumab , a human igg1 , also designated abthraxtm , isolated using phage display technology [ 43 ] .
figure 3 neutralizing epitopes inhibiting pa - atrs interactions compared with anthrax toxin receptors ( atrs ) binding site .
( a ) three - dimensional localization of the neutralizing epitopes on pa. pa structure has been obtained using file 1acc from the protein data bank [ 6 ] and was colored in grey .
residues of the four pa loops constituting the atrs binding site , residues 340 - 348 ( part of domain ii ) , residues 654 - 662 , 681 - 688 , and 714 - 716 ( part of domain iv ) were colored in red .
the core of the four well - defined pa neutralizing epitopes were delimited in blue for 14b7 , in green for 35pa83 , in purple for 1 - f1 and in yellow for 2 - b12 .
after ab binding to the core epitope , the interface between ab and pa should cover a larger surface .
( b ) localization of the neutralizing epitopes on pa sequence .
localization of the four epitopes was given as sequence alignments ; residues constituting atrs binding site were colored in red on pa sequence .
among the abs presented above , two have entered clinical trials for therapeutic approval , raxibacumab and anthim ( r ) , derived from 14b7 .
raxibacumab was shown to be protective both prophylacticly and therapeutically in a non - human primate ( nhp ) model using a 40 mg / kg intravenous ( i.v. ) dose , eliciting respective protections of 90 % ( 100 ld50 ) and 64 % ( 200 ld50 ) against aerosolized ames spores .
tolerance data was evaluated in a group of human volunteers [ 44 ] and a total of 65,000 doses of raxibacumab has been ordered for the us strategic stockpile while this mab awaits final fda approval [ 41 ] .
anthim ( r ) ( elusys , pine brook , nj ) , previously eti - 204 , was developed from the murine mab 14b7 as a chimeric deimmunized mab utilizing the deimmunisation ( r ) process ( antitope , cambridge , uk ) [ 45 ] .
in vivo analysis utilizing the rabbit ames spore inhalation model demonstrated complete prophylactic ( 163 ld50 ) and 80 % therapeutic ( 172 ld50 ) protection when ~ 4 mg / kg of anthim ( r ) was administered by i.v. although the results have not been published , anthim ( r ) has completed phase i clinical trials both alone and in combination with antibiotics under national clinical trials ( ntc ) study designations nct00829582 and nct00138411 .
2.2 .
antibodies inhibiting pa cleavage by furin after pa83 has bound atrs , it is cleaved by a cell membrane - associated furin into two proteins , a 63 kda ( pa63 ) and a 20 kda ( pa20 ) fragment , with pa63 remaining bound to the receptor [ 46 ] .
this cleavage occurs at r167 , part of the rkkr cleavage site ( residues 164 - 167 ) , which is localized in an exposed loop of the domain i [ 6 ] .
this cleavage is necessary to expose a large hydrophobic surface on pa63 which binds either lf or ef [ 47,48 ] .
murine mab 48.3 [ 39 ] is an ab protective in vivo against b. anthracis , which was shown to block this enzymatic cleavage in an assay where pa83 and mab 48.3 were incubated on cho - k1 cells .
the authors report that , when the concentration of mab 48.3 increased , the abundance of pa63 decreased thus showing inhibition of pa83 cleavage .
the epitope of mab 48.3 was localized between residues 314 - 608 , according to the reactivity of mab 48.3 with various pa fragments .
this epitope was then precisely mapped by screening a library of phage - displayed peptides , as located in the pa domain ii between residues 412 - 419 thus away from the cleavage site .
the authors concluded that the steric hindrance of mab 48.3 , or mab 48.3 - induced conformational changes , prevented pa83 cleavage .
mab 7.5g , another murine mab , inhibited the toxicity of anthrax lethal toxin in vitro and in vivo [ 49 ] .
in an assay where pa83 and furin were incubated for various periods of time in the presence or absence of mab 7.5g , it was observed that there were less pa63 and pa20 , and more pa83 , in the presence of mab 7.5g than in its absence .
it was similarly concluded that mab 7.5g inhibited pa83 cleavage by furin .
in an elisa , mab 7.5g bound to the first 157 amino acids of pa83 domain i , and thus mab 7.5g epitope was mapped in the domain encompassing the cleavage site , well in agreement with its mechanism of action. of note , 22g12 , a potent inhibitor of anthrax lt in vitro and in vivo , bound pa83 near the cleavage site , as its binding was inhibited by trypsin [ 50 ] and it prevented subsequent steps necessary for toxicity .
unexpectedly , 22g12 did not prevent cleavage but was thought to inhibit the release of pa20 , by " clipping " pa63 and pa20 .
only mabs 7.5g and 48.3 have been positively tested in vivo , utilizing two murine models , intoxication with lt and subcutaneous infection with spores. of note , the use of 48.3 , in combination with mabs 50.8 and 7.5 , constituted the first oligoclonal set of mabs that provided synergistic protection against anthrax [ 39 ] .
although a single therapeutic would be less expensive to develop , an oligoclonal mixture of mabs may be necessary for neutralization and may also act synergistically with other antimicrobials .
2.3 .
antibodies inhibiting pa heptamerization pa63 molecules , bound to their cellular receptors and separated from pa20 , diffuse in the two dimensions of the membrane and form spontaneously heptameric complexes , which are thermodynamically favorable over the monomeric form .
mutations in the loop encompassing residues 510 - 518 of the pa domain iii , and more particularly the residue 512 , strongly inhibited this oligomerization , driving to the inhibition of the lt toxicity .
these results indicated that the pa domain iii was particularly involved in pa heptamerization [ 11,51 ] .
murine mabs 2d3 , 2d5 and 10d2 neutralized lt in vitro , binding to the region located between residues 581 - 601 .
their mechanism of action was initially hypothesized to be either inhibition of pa binding to atrs or inhibition of pa heptamerization , but the latter may be regarded as the most probable due to their epitope location [ 52 ] .
the human mab avp - 21d9 strongly neutralized b. anthracis and bound to pa47 , a pa fragment corresponding to a portion of domain iii , and to domain iv [ 53 ] .
this mab was shown to inhibit heptamer formation in vitro , possibly by masking the assembly interfaces [ 50 ] .
a strongly protective mab , mdx - 1303 , bound pa83 but it did not prevent pa83 interaction with atrs .
more precisely , it was shown to bind pa63 , but it did not inhibit lf binding [ 54 ] .
the mdx - 1303 epitope has been located in pa47 , as with avp - 21d9. from these elements , it was concluded that mdx - 1303 inhibited heptamer assembly or function , and it was shown that the absence of mdx - 1303 fc region decreased its activity by a ten fold .
it was thus inferred that the bridging of pa with fc receptors ( fcrs ) was involved in the neutralization mechanism , which might depend on the inhibition of heptamer assembly or function. of note , it was shown that the neutralizing activity of sera raised against pa also depended on fc receptors , in an experiment where the blockade of fcrs with mabs reduced neutralization .
thus , mdx - 1303 may depend on an activity also present in sera raised by the anthrax vaccine .
a third mab , murine 1g3 mab , reacted with pa63 exclusively in its heptameric form and its epitope has been located between residues 168 - 314 , on domains i and ii [ 52 ]. by electron microscopy , it was shown that 1g3 binding to heptamers may stitch two heptamers together , resulting in dodecamer - like supercomplexes [ 55 ] that prevented following steps from occurring .
two ab therapeutic candidates , able to neutralize pa heptamerization , are undergoing clinical trials .
valortim ( r ) ( pharmathene inc , annapolis , md ) , or mdx - 1303 , is currently in phase i clinical trials [ 54 ] .
nhps exposed to 200 ld50 aerosolized ames spores demonstrated complete survival after the administration of 1 mg / kg of this ab , at 1 - h post - exposure .
although phase i studies of valortim ( r ) were either suspended or terminated due to an adverse event , ongoing investigations are underway to determine the cause of this reaction and this mab remains in phase i trials under study designations nct00964834 and nct00964561 .
a second human anti - pa igg1 , thravixatm ( previously avp - 21d9 ) , has been produced by emergent ( rockville , md ) and is currently in phase i clinical trials under the study designation nct01202694 .
utilizing rabbit models , subcutaneous administration of thravixatm ( 2 mg / kg ) provided complete protection against 102 ld50 aerosolized ames spores when given concurrently , and 66 % protection at 24 - h post challenge .
additionally , a synergistic effect was observed using combined treatments of thravixatm with ciprofloxacin in a murine model .
although not yet assessed for tolerance , the potential for in vivo synergistic effects with antibiotics and the existence of two human mabs in clinical trials highlight inhibition of pa heptamerization as a promising mechanism of protection against anthrax .
2.4 .
antibodies inhibiting pa - lf / ef interactions after heptamer formation on the host cell surface , three lf and / or ef proteins bind to pa63 competitively and with high affinity ( kd = 1 nm ) [ 56 ] by their n - terminal domains ( lfn and efn ) also called pa - binding domains ( 260 first residues ) [ 6,51,57,58 ] .
lf / ef residues involved in the pa binding site were localized by mutagenesis studies [ 59,63 ] and by the analysis of a lf - pa co - crystal structure [ 57 ] .
two regions of lf are involved in that binding .
the first region is the first alpha helix ( lfalpha1 helix ) , located between residues 29 - 50 , which dock into a deep amphipathic cleft on the surface of the pa63 heptamer .
the second region is composed of lfn hydrophobic residues of the alpha helix 10 ( lfalpha10 helix ) , residues l188 , y223 , h229 , v232 , l235 and y236 , which are closely involved in an interaction with a hydrophobic region on pa , involving pa residues f202 , p205 , i207 and i210. by screening a naive phage - displayed library against cell - bound pa63 , three human single - chain variable fragments ( scfvs ) that possess neutralizing activity against anthrax toxin have been isolated and converted into fabs , ss87 , ss70 and ss73. of these three fabs , ss87 provided the best in vitro neutralization when added after pa heptamerization on the cell surface , and before the addition of lf [ 64 ] .
consequently , ss87 could not act by inhibition of pa cleavage nor heptamerization , but by inhibition of a later step which could only be the interaction between pa and ef / lf. by immunofluorescent microscopy experiments it was shown that ss87 recognized and bound to the heptamer and consequently competed with the lf / ef interaction , which was thus directly identified as the inhibition mechanism .
unfortunately , the ss87 epitope was not mapped .
this mechanism of neutralization is certainly shared by the human fab a8 [ 40 ] .
this fab was isolated from a phage displayed human scfv library and protected raw264.7 macrophage cells against an lt challenge , similar to the cell assay described above , but no direct proof of the neutralization mechanism was given .
apart from these anti - pa abs , the interaction between pa and lf / ef can also be inhibited by abs targeting lf and ef. this was first confirmed by studies using a dna vaccine encoding lf , which established in vivo the protective efficacy of anti - lf abs [ 65 ] .
in 2003 , the murine mab lf8 was shown to neutralize lt in vitro , and to protect in vivo utilizing a murine model of the disease [ 66 ] .
using an electro - mobility shifting assay ( emsa ) , it was shown that mab lf8 inhibited lf binding to pa , forming stable lf8 - lf complexes instead of pa - lf complexes .
the lf8 epitope was recently localized by a standard solid - phase peptide assay in the lf domain iii , between residues 314 - 323 , thus not in the region known to be involved in the pa - lf interaction [ 67 ] .
domain iii is known to be involved in lf enzymatic activity but not in pa binding , thus this mapping was not predicted .
the neutralizing mab 10g3 possessed the same neutralization mechanism as lf8 and its epitope was mapped between residues 350 - 361 , close to the lf8 epitope , using the same peptide assay [ 67,68 ] .
this epitope was also targeted by the neutralizing mabs 5b13b1 and 3c16c3 , whose mechanism of action remained undetermined but should be identical , based on epitope mapping [ 69 ] .
domain iii is located at the opposite face on lf with regard to the pa binding site ( lfn ) and thus the binding of these abs may not inhibit the pa / lf interaction by steric hindrance , but rather by altering the conformation of lf. a highly neutralizing anti - lf scfv , 2lf , has been isolated from a phage - displayed library , built from an immunized nhp .
2lf inhibited the toxin complex formation as described for lf8 [ 70 ] and was shown to cross - react with ef. after epitope mapping with peptides failed , alanine shaving and scanning indicated that the 2lf epitope was localized in the lfalpha10 helix region of lfn , directly consistent with its neutralization mechanism ( submitted manuscript ) .
a human anti - lf igg1 , iqnlf , neutralized lt in vitro with an efficacy three - fold higher than the anti - pa mab iqnpa .
it conferred passive protection in a / j mice infected by the b. anthracis sterne spores [ 31 ] .
the iqnlf epitope was localized within the lfn domain using isolated lf domains and western blot analysis , but it was not more precisely mapped .
nevertheless , the authors expected that it may block the lt formation by disrupting or preventing the interaction of lf with the pa heptamer .
recently , the mab h10 has been isolated from a mouse immunized with lfn domain [ 71 ] .
as with 2lf , this mab cross - reacted with lf and ef , due to similarities between lfn and efn , and neutralized both toxins in vivo .
regarding anti - ef abs , the mab 9f5 inhibited the binding of radiolabeled ef to cell - bound pa [ 72 ] .
three ef fragments were obtained by acid hydrolysis with molecular weights of 18 kda ( n - terminal , residues 1 - 156 ) , 53 kda ( central ) and 17 kda ( c - terminal ) .
it was shown by immunoblot that 9f5 bound specifically the n - terminal fragment , and it was thus expected that 9f5 inhibited the binding of ef to the pa63 heptamer by targeting this first half of efn , but its epitope was not more precisely mapped .
although no mabs inhibiting the interaction of pa - lf / ef have entered clinical trials , the development of human mabs such as iqnlf , ss87 , fab a8 , 2lf as well as the cross - reactivity of mab h10 demonstrated the therapeutic potential of this mechanism. of these abs , only iqnlf and 2lf have been tested in vivo utilizing murine and rat models of intoxication .
future aerosol testing utilizing rabbit and / or nhp models will help determine if abs inhibiting pa - lf / ef interactions will have clinical applications .
2.5 .
antibodies inhibiting endocytosis and translocation the formation of the pa63 heptamer stimulates the endocytosis of pa - lf / ef complexes [ 73 ] .
under the acidic conditions of the endosomes , the heptamer is driven to membrane insertion and forms a pore , protecting the toxins from lysosomal proteases and facilitating ef and lf translocation into the cytoplasm [ 74 ] .
two chimeric chimpanzee / human mabs , lf10e and lf11h , bound to lfn ( known to be involved in the interaction with pa ) but it was shown by western blot analysis that these mabs did not inhibit the association of lf to activated pa [ 75 ] .
in vitro studies demonstrated that these mabs did not prevent lt formation ; however , both of these mabs inhibited the lf - driven cleavage of mitogen - activate protein kinase in the cytosol .
the authors have hypothesized that , because lf10e and lf11h did not bind the enzymatic site , they inhibited the lf translocation .
in addition to the inhibition of lf by this mechanism , the chimeric chimpanzee / human mab ef13d , which bound to domain iv of ef , was shown to inhibit ef activity through the inhibition of ef binding with calmodulin ( cam ) [ 76 ] .
in vitro measurements utilizing migration under native conditions and analytical ultracentrifugation ( auc ) showed that ef13d binding to ef displaced cam bound to ef. in effect , utilizing both methods , incubation of the three proteins ( ef , cam and fab ef13d ) always resulted in a mixture of ef - fab ef13d complexes plus free cam .
further auc testing utilizing cam - ef complexes mixed with free fab ef13d resulted in a shift to ef - fab complexes plus free cam .
however , the authors of this study did not expected the fab ef13d to enter the cam rich cytoplasm , thus they suggested that the mab ef13d protected by another mechanism .
this mechanism would be the blocking of ef endocytosis or translocation through the pa heptamer pore .
although this hypothesis has yet to be confirmed , additional mechanisms may also be at play according to these authors .
chimpanzee / human chimeric mabs should be well tolerated for human use , given similarities between both species .
in vivo analysis has only been performed in murine and rat models , utilizing intravenous and footpad intoxication models [ 76 ] .
meeting the fda animal rule would require the efficacy of these mabs to be demonstrated in rabbits or nhps challenged by aerosolized spores .
nevertheless , these humanized mabs constitute the closest therapeutic products utilizing this neutralization mechanism .
3. antibodies directed against bacillus anthracis capsule b. anthracis virulence factors are not only its toxins , but also consist of a poly - gamma - d - glutamic acid ( gammadpga ) anti - phagocytic capsule , encoded on the pxo2 plasmid .
this capsule is essential for in vivo distribution of the bacteria from the lungs [ 77,78 ] .
although previously described as poorly immunogenic [ 79 ] , the gammadpga capsule has recently become a target for the generation of both vaccine and therapeutic ab candidates .
the murine igg3 , mab f26g3 , was developed by immunizing mice against gammadpga [ 80 ] .
when injected , this mab elicited 90 % protection in a murine pulmonary challenge model .
kozel et al. developed several additional murine mabs against gammadpga , which bound to separate areas of the capsular architecture , suggesting a certain level of complexity in the structure of the capsule [ 81 ] .
chen et al. developed two chimeric chimpanzee / human mabs , 11d and 4c , from chimpanzees immunized against gammadpga .
the variable regions of 11d and 4c were fused to fc portions of either gamma1 or gamma3 isotype [ 82 ] .
the authors observed similar binding affinities with igg1 and igg3 versions of these abs , but increased protection utilizing the igg1 isotype .
in vivo testing against an intratracheal ames spore challenge ( 1,5.104 spores , i.e. , 15 ld50 ) in a murine model elicited complete protection with a 1 mg injection given at 18 - hrs pre - challenge , or as late as 20 - h post - challenge , utilizing the igg1 isotype .
the protection elicited by 11d and 4c against an intratracheal challenge of ames spores in murine models emphasized the advancing therapeutic development of mabs utilizing this mechanism of protection .
however , further testing utilizing rabbit and / or nhp animal models , which would fulfil the fda animal rule , will ultimately demonstrate if these mabs will have the protective capacity for further clinical development .
4. the particular case of antibody enhancing toxin activity antibodies can paradoxically increase the cytotoxic effects of lt. previously , antibody - dependent enhancement ( ade ) of pathogenicity was only shown with mabs developed against viruses [ 83 ] .
regarding anthrax , mohamed et al. demonstrated the enhancement of lt cytotoxicity with a panel of mabs directed against pa [ 84 ] .
in vitro studies showed that these enhancing mabs interacted with murine macrophage fcgamma receptors , and were hypothesized to stabilize pa on the cell surface , thus increasing the quantity of pa internalized by macrophages [ 84 ] .
recently , ade by mabs directed against pa was further demonstrated in vivo [ 85 ] .
in vitro analysis of 17 enhancing mabs yielded eight separate antigenic regions on pa. of note , utilizing sub - lethal lt concentrations in vivo , little et al. was able to induce a lethal response in fisher rats utilizing four mabs separately .
the authors of this second study remarked that the fcgamma receptor - dependent mechanism of enhancement may not be the only one responsible for the increased lt pathogenicity .
these results could imply that immunization with pa may elicit a response that would include such enhancing abs , but the existence of this response should be further studied .
the existence of these enhancing mabs could explain why pa - derived vaccines are not always completely protective .
this suggests the need for caution when developing abs directed against a single antigen of anthrax for clinical purposes , and abs neutralizing alternative antigens ( e.g. , lf and ef ) might be needed .
5. discussion and conclusion b. anthracis is one of the biological agents most at risk of being weaponized , and it was the subject of ongoing fundamental studies even before the intentional dissemination of spores in the us , in 2001 [ 1 ] .
this very sad event led to several observations , including the fact that the therapeutic window was too narrow for optimal therapy [ 24 ] .
recombinant abs against anthrax were then actively developed because abs of animal origin had previously been shown to increase that window , in animal models of the disease , and also shortened the duration of antibiotherapy .
those animal abs were directed against anthrax toxins , which were also targeted by recombinant abs , isolated at a time when the structures of these toxins have been resolved .
the study of these new abs has increased the knowledge of anthrax toxins neutralization , which now may be regarded as a model .
it shows the variety of mechanisms which may be inhibited for toxin neutralization : protein - protein interactions , cleavage , heptamerization , endocytosis and translocation. of note , the existence of certain mechanisms has been directly proven in vitro , such as the inhibition of interaction by emsa experiments [ 66,86 ] , while other mechanisms were hypothesized only , as a consequence of the exclusion of others .
indeed , one may be cautious with hypothesized mechanisms , particularly if others have been demonstrated and in fact resemble mechanisms recently observed elsewhere , such as neutralization of botulinum toxin proteolytic activity [ 87 ] .
the inhibition of endocytosis and translocation mentioned above may thus benefit from further studies .
regarding the better established mechanisms of neutralization , it is striking that the two main abs characteristics described long ago as essential , affinity and specificity , are indeed key .
affinity is essential because the abs compete with a natural ligand - whether receptor , substrate , another sub - unit - to inhibit interaction , cleavage , heptamerization respectively .
nanomolar affinities are often requested for such an efficient competition .
this competition also explains that ab concentration plays a role in toxin neutralization , as it relies on a dynamic equilibrium .
specificity is the second key abs characteristic because , in most studies , highly neutralizing abs are shown to target exactly the region involved in the inhibited process ( see figure 3 ) [ 35,36,37,38 ] .
however , certain studies have presented epitopes which were not located in the regions known to be involved in the inhibited process [ 66,67 ] , and steric hindrance or alteration of the antigen conformation may in effect explain these results .
in certain studies however , the epitopes have been localized with peptides , and it is the experience of the authors of the present review that such studies might give misleading results if they are not rigorously interpreted .
in particular , the peptide thought to represent the epitope should be demonstrated as efficiently competing with the natural ligand for ab binding .
in the absence of such competing effect , an epitope mapping was re - performed by alanine scanning and results found to be completely different from those obtained with peptides ( manuscript in preparation ) .
if specificity is generally a favorable characteristic , allowing high efficiency and good tolerance , it may also represent abs achille 's heel because a single mutation might abolish the binding of a specific ab if localized in its epitope .
while such a mutation is difficult to envision in epitopic regions essential for protein function , this risk can be limited by the development of oligoclonal abs [ 13,88 ] .
recombinant abs against anthrax did not always neutralize toxins , but also targeted spores .
in that case , the activation of immune effectors became key , as shown by isotype importance and the role of affinity and specificity was then certainly far less important than it was for toxins neutralization .
the fact that abs may enhance pathogenesis is very well exemplified in the paradigm of anthrax , and should be kept in mind when abs target a pathogen whose host cells bear fcrs [ 84 ] .
in that case in effect , iggs interacting with the pathogen may bind to the fcrs and bring the pathogen closer to its host .
if the pathogen is not neutralized , this fc - fcrs binding is likely to increase pathogenicity .
when developing abs for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes , ade risk may be reduced by changing fc isotype to reduce fcrs binding , or even suppressed by replacing the fc portion by another molecule increasing ab fragments half - life , such as peg .
this risk is far more difficult to limit when developing vaccines .
the paradigm of anthrax demonstates that , particularly if infective pathogenesis is elucidated , such as with the central role of toxins in anthrax , abs may be remarkable anti - infective new molecules .
such new molecules are in high demand at present , due to mounting antibioresistance [ 26,27 ] .
the historical anti - infective abs should be actively developed for prophylactic or therapeutic purposes as they were against anthrax , but in their recombinant form .

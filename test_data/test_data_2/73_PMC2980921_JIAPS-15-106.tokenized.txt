windsock deformity ( wd ) is a rare anomaly .
a case of double jejunal web with wd causing neonatal intestinal obstruction is being reported .
intestinal obstruction jejunal web windsock deformity introduction jejuno - ileal atresias have been categorized into type i ( mucosal web ) , type ii ( atretic fibrous cord ) , type iiia ( v - shaped mesenteric defect ) , type iiib (' apple peel atresia ') , and type iv ( multiple atresias ).[ 1 ] windsock deformity ( wd ) is a rare anomaly .
the second part of the duodenum is the most common site of wd. we report a unique case of double jejunal web with wd in a neonate .
case report a three - day - old full - term male neonate was admitted with a history of abdominal distension and bilious vomiting since birth .
the baby had not passed meconium since birth .
epigastric distension was noted on abdominal examination .
the abdominal radiograph revealed a few gaseous shadows in the proximal gut and completely gasless lower abdomen .
an ultrasonography and echocardiography ruled out any associated genito - urinary and cardiac anomalies .
at laparotomy , dilatation of the proximal 5 cm of jejunum , duodenum , and stomach were seen .
the small gut loops distal to the obstruction were completely collapsed .
a longitudinal enterotomy was performed just distal to the site of obstruction along the antimesenteric border .
a windsock web causing total obstruction of the jejunum was noticed proximal to the enterotomy site [ figure 1 ] .
the web was excised circumferentially and the proximal bowel deflated .
a second simple web completely obstructing the jejunal lumen [ figure 2 ] was noticed 2 cm distal to the enterotomy site after the saline test to check the patency of distal bowel was performed .
this web was also excised from the same enterotomy site .
the enterotomy site was closed .
post - operatively the patient made a delayed recovery with bowel functioning on the 14th postoperative day .
the patient was thriving at 6 months follow - up. figure 1 proximal web seen after enterotomy figure 2 another web 2 cm distal to the proximal web visible after saline injection discussion windsock deformity of the jejunum due to congenital web is a very rare anomaly with scant literature .
furthermore , to the best of our knowledge , the presence of two webs in the jejunum has not been reported till date in the english literature and hence the importance of this case .
andrews and stem ( 1981 ) reported a case of jejunal web in a 48 - h old arab female neonate. [ 2 ] the newborn had presented with small bowel obstruction , upper abdominal distention , and bile - stained vomitus .
a jejunal web was removed during surgery and jejunoplasty performed .
de backer et al. treated a one - year - old boy with high jejunal membranous stenosis successfully by antimesenteric longitudinal enterotomy over the diaphragm , excision of the latter , and transverse closure of the bowel. [ 3 ] kothari et al. reported a case of jejunal web with a central perforation situated 8 cm from the duodeno - jejunal junction in a four - year - old emaciated male child with history of intermittent episodes of bilious vomiting , abdominal pain , and failure to thrive .
enterotomy with excision of web was done and the child had an uneventful post - operative recovery. [ 4 ] seltz reported a case of jejunal web with a pinhole in a 13 - month - old boy with a history of failure to thrive and recurrent episodes of non - bilious emesis beginning at six months of age .
surgical excision of the web was done without any complications. [ 5 ] our case can be included into type iv jejunal atresia because of presence of multiple atresias .
the treatment for jejunal web remains surgical excision even though variable approaches may be used .
endoscopic laser therapy has been successfully tried for duodenal web .
simultaneous laparotomy with endoscopy has also proved useful. [ 3 ] our patient underwent enterotomy with excision of the webs .

background the world health organization recently made a recommendation supporting ' culturally - appropriate ' maternity care services to improve maternal and newborn health .
this recommendation results , in part , from a systematic review we conducted , which showed that interventions to provide culturally - appropriate maternity care have largely improved women 's use of skilled maternity care .
factors relating to the implementation of these interventions can have implications for their success .
this paper examines stakeholders' perspectives and experiences of these interventions , and facilitators and barriers to implementation ; and concludes with how they relate to the effects of the interventions on care - seeking outcomes .
methods we based our analysis on 15 papers included in the systematic review .
to extract , collate and organise data on the context and conditions from each paper , we adapted the sure ( supporting the use of research evidence ) framework that lists categories of factors that could influence implementation .
we considered information from the background and discussion sections of papers included in the systematic review , as well as cost data and qualitative data when included .
results women 's and other stakeholders' perspectives on the interventions were generally positive .
four key themes emerged in our analysis of facilitators and barriers to implementation .
firstly , interventions must consider broader economic , geographical and social factors that affect ethnic minority groups' access to services , alongside providing culturally - appropriate care .
secondly , community participation is important in understanding problems with existing services and potential solutions from the community perspective , and in the development and implementation of interventions .
thirdly , respectful , person - centred care should be at the core of these interventions .
finally , cohesiveness is essential between the culturally - appropriate service and other health care providers encountered by women and their families along the continuum of care through pregnancy until after birth .
conclusion several important factors should be considered and addressed when implementing interventions to provide culturally - appropriate care .
these factors reflect more general goals on the international agenda of improving access to skilled maternity care ; providing high - quality , respectful care ; and community participation .

health care providers that lack cultural competence , and differences in cultural practices and preferences between maternity care services and the communities they serve , can affect the decisions of women and their families on use of skilled maternity care [ 5 - 10 ] .
the world health organization ( who ) recently made a recommendation supporting ' culturally - appropriate ' maternity care services to improve maternal and newborn health [ 11 ] .
culturally - appropriate services , or providing care which takes account of the preferences and aspirations of individuals and the cultures of their communities , is an important component of quality of care [ 12 ] .
we conducted a systematic review to examine evidence on the effects of interventions to provide culturally - appropriate maternity care for ethno - linguistic or religious groups on use of skilled care before , during , and after birth [ 13 ] .
we considered interventions employing models of service delivery , service providers or service practices with the aim of providing culturally - appropriate care .
fifteen studies met our inclusion criteria , evaluating 14 different interventions [ 1 , 5 , 14 - 26 ] .
specific strategies included selecting health care providers who shared cultural and / or linguistic background with service users ; employing cultural brokers , mediators or interpreters ; providing staff training to improve cultural awareness ; incorporating local birthing practices into service provision ; adapting the physical or social setting in which a service is provided ( e.g. equipping the delivery room with a rope and bench for vertical delivery , or including family in the room during the birth ) ; and using participatory approaches .
some interventions focused on a single strategy while others adopted multiple strategies .
the review found that interventions to provide culturally - appropriate maternity care have largely improved women 's use of skilled maternity care [ 13 ] .
ten of 15 studies reported positive effects on at least one relevant care - seeking outcome , with most focusing on use of antenatal care ( anc ) .
however , the contexts in which these interventions take place , and factors relating to their implementation , can influence their success .
this paper examines factors that affected implementation of the 14 interventions included in our systematic review .
we consider stakeholders' perspectives and experiences of these interventions , and facilitators and barriers to implementation ; and we conclude with how these factors relate to the interventions' effects on care - seeking outcomes .
methods this paper presents a secondary analysis of 15 studies included in our systematic review , described in detail elsewhere [ 13 , 27 ] .
the included studies measured the impact of an intervention to provide culturally - appropriate care for ethno - linguistic or religious groups on one of our outcomes of primary interest : birth with a skilled attendant , birth in a health facility , use of anc , timing of first anc visit , and postpartum care visits .
to identify literature , we conducted systematic searches of ten electronic databases and two targeted websites [ 27 ] .
we supplemented these searches with relevant literature identified in a related mapping [ 28 ] ; hand - searches of the reference lists of included studies and related reviews ; and suggestions from experts .
we included studies published in english , french or spanish between 1990 and 2014 .
we extracted data on the populations , interventions and study designs ; and we conducted a quality assessment of each study using the effective public health practice project quality assessment tool for quantitative studies [ 29 ] .
for this secondary analysis of implementation factors , sl extracted data on contexts and conditions from each paper .
ej used a tool adapted from the sure ( supporting the use of research evidence ) framework [ 30 ] to collate and organise these data according to a list of possible categories of factors that could influence implementation .
data on factors affecting implementation were largely provided in studies' background and discussion sections .
some studies also included cost data or qualitative data .
results and discussion characteristics of the included studies , summarised in table 1 , are described in depth elsewhere [ 13 ] .
the studies evaluated interventions in australia ( n = 5 ) , the usa ( n = 4 ) , the uk ( n = 2 ) , peru ( n = 2 ) , and israel ( n = 1 ) .
most studies occurred in countries classified by the organisation for economic co - operation and development as high - income ( n = 13 ) ; the exceptions were the two studies that took place in peru , which is considered upper - middle - income [ 5 , 20 ] .
most of the studies ( n = 10 ) examined interventions targeting populations at the sub - national level ( e.g. region , state , county , district ) , and the rest targeted populations at the local - level ( e.g. village , neighbourhood ) .
indigenous women were the most common intervention recipients ( n = 9 ) , followed by ethno - linguistic minority groups in the usa or in the uk ( n = 6 ) .
several papers referred to overlapping characteristics , such as socioeconomic status , age and geographical location .

four studies were assessed to be of moderate quality , with all others being of weak quality .
five papers included additional evaluation strands , most commonly interviews and / or surveys with service users and service providers or cost - effectiveness analyses [ 1 , 5 , 15 , 22 , 26 ] .
eight studies reported improvements in use and / or timing of anc ; one of three studies reported increases in birth at a health facility ; and the one study that considered postpartum care reported a positive effect .
stakeholders' perspectives and experiences of culturally - appropriate maternity care interventions since it was precisely the inappropriateness of existing services that interventions sought to address , improving acceptability and appropriateness according to stakeholders' perspectives was fundamental .
culturally - appropriate interventions were designed based on empirical data , experience working with these communities and / or the input of communities through participatory approaches .
four of the included studies reported process evaluations that provided insight into the perspectives of community members .
each study that did report such data revealed largely positive views and experiences of the intervention [ 1 , 5 , 15 , 22 ] .
gabrysch et al .
[ 5 ] claimed that ' simple changes such as respecting certain preferences or language or allowing the company of relatives can have a massive impact both on service satisfaction and use ' ( p. 727 ) .
in their evaluation of a culturally - appropriate model for care at birth , developed with the participation of indigenous communities , 14 of 16 women were satisfied with the service , felt well - attended , would use it again and would recommend it to others .
women who used a community - controlled anc service in sydney , australia , also reported a positive experience and emphasised improvements in relationships and trust , accessibility , flexibility , appropriateness of information , continuity of care , empowerment and family - centred care [ 15 ] .
in another community - based intervention for aboriginal women in australia , women were positive about home visits , aboriginal health workers , and assistance with transport [ 22 ] .
women also reported being generally satisfied with an indigenous antenatal clinic in brisbane , australia [ 1 ] .
a much higher proportion of women ' felt mostly understood and respected ' by staff in the intervention clinic ( 92 %) than in other hospital locations , and they approved of the clinic location and care arrangements .
however , data also revealed some negative stakeholder perspectives .
jan et al .
[ 15 ] found that stigma associated with a service specifically targeting an aboriginal population appeared to prevent its use by some less vulnerable women .
stigma is one potential ethical implication that should be considered in any such intervention targeting specific groups , as well as the possibility that this may adversely affect use of skilled care for some women .
kildea et al. ' s [ 1 ] interviews and surveys also indicated persistent problems with some aspects of the service , both from a community perspective and a health provider perspective , though interestingly these two groups did not always agree on what the problems were .
for example , health providers and external stakeholders viewed the location of the clinic in a tertiary hospital to be problematic because of transport barriers ; however , women reported that it was easy to access , though some said they would prefer a community - based location .
although making families feel welcome was a key element of the intervention , women reported that male partners were still uncomfortable with using services , particularly the waiting room .
both women and health providers identified broader problems that needed to be addressed .
they reported that provision was too limited , delays too common , and arrangements too inflexible .
they also reported problems with privacy that health workers believed hindered efforts to build relationships with service users .
what factors affect implementation of culturally - appropriate maternity services ?
four key themes were prominent in our analysis of facilitators and barriers to implementation : accessibility ; community participation ; person - centred , respectful care ; and cohesiveness between maternity services along the continuum of care through pregnancy until after birth .
accessibility a complex range of factors affected use of skilled maternity care for targeted groups .
members of a cultural group might not use a service because they are too poor or because they live in a remote area [ 27 , 10 ] .
studies highlighted the need to address broader access barriers alongside providing culturally - appropriate services .
poverty was a major issue and unless addressed , out - of pocket costs - direct or indirect - could discourage use even where culturally - appropriate services increased demand .
several studies noted context - specific issues with care financing that remained a barrier to uptake [ 18 , 20 , 26 ] .
physical access to maternity care services was also key ; several populations targeted in these interventions lived in rural or remote areas [ 5 , 14 , 21 , 26 ] .
populations in less remote areas did not necessarily have access to private transport or frequent , reliable and inexpensive public transport [ 1 , 15 ] .
access was compounded by gender - based restrictions on women 's travel for some populations , such as semi - nomadic bedouin women in israel [ 14 ] .
many interventions adopted strategies to address physical access barriers alongside providing culturally - appropriate care .
for example , two interventions transferred women living in particularly remote areas late in pregnancy to wait for birth in proximity to a maternity unit [ 5 , 21 ] .
some interventions brought prenatal services closer to communities or adopted an outreach service [ 14 - 17 , 22 , 26 ] .
outreach often involved non - skilled workers who facilitated access to anc , but women still needed to attend health facilities for skilled care .
as discussed in the next section , several interventions using outreach models reported positive effects on use of anc , but thompson et al .
[ 26 ] urged caution : they suspected that some women may have viewed these services as a substitute for anc and suggested this as a possible reason for finding no effect on use or timing of anc in their study .
several interventions provided transport services to health facilities [ 16 , 21 , 23 ] , and an intervention with a bedouin arab population in israel highlighted the need to ensure that transport provision itself is culturally - appropriate [ 14 ] .
women 's social circumstances have implications for access to care. whether , or how , these circumstances were factored in was frequently cited as an enabler or barrier to interventions providing culturally - appropriate care .
women 's low levels of education or literacy ; limited knowledge or experience of maternal health and health services ; and a lack of social support were all described as challenges [ 14 , 15 , 17 - 19 , 26 ] .
some interventions addressed these factors through the use of staff from the same cultural background as targeted populations to provide information , education and social support ; to link communities with health services ; and to facilitate access [ 14 - 19 , 25 , 26 ] .
childcare - related issues were compounded by transport problems and long waiting times [ 15 , 26 ] .
some authors cited the provision of childcare as an enabler of their interventions [ 15 , 16 ] , and other authors deemed the lack of childcare provision to be an issue for future interventions to address [ 14 ] .
community participation community participation was also a key strategy of several interventions reviewed , though the rationale , extent and type of participation varied widely .
on the spectrum of participation , approaches ranged from consulting communities to shared leadership [ 31 ] .
among the studies in this review , dialogue with communities was seen to facilitate better understanding of problems with existing services and how they could be addressed to ensure that services met the needs of targeted populations [ 5 , 14 , 21 , 26 ] .
dialogue between health providers and communities was seen as ' crucial in building mutual respect ' [ 5 ] .
the who recommends ongoing dialogue with communities as an essential component in defining the characteristics of culturally - appropriate , quality maternity care services that address the needs of women and incorporate their cultural preferences [ 13 ] .
mechanisms that ensure women 's voices are meaningfully included in these dialogues are also recommended .
several interventions also involved communities in the development , implementation , and / or monitoring of culturally - appropriate interventions .
this deeper level of involvement gave communities ' ownership ' and a stake in the interventions' success [ 21 ] .
in some interventions - particularly with indigenous populations in australia - this approach was operationalised through ' community - controlled services' [ 1 , 21 - 23 ] .
one intervention in australia also established women 's reference groups to discuss , promote and support an enabling model of care , albeit with limited success due to low interest from community members [ 22 ] .
state - and county - level grassroots minority health coalitions in the usa developed and implemented their own intervention , coordinating prenatal care projects to eliminate cultural barriers to care and to facilitate early entry into prenatal care [ 16 ] .
participatory approaches in maternal and newborn health interventions more generally have been reviewed elsewhere [ 13 ] .
person - centred , respectful care a pervasive barrier to uptake of care by target populations was poor interpersonal interaction with healthcare providers .
linguistic differences were a key barrier in many contexts [ 5 , 19 , 25 , 26 ] .
women also reported that they faced unfriendly , insensitive and disrespectful interactions with health providers that were exacerbated by negative attitudes , discrimination and / or racism [ 1 , 5 , 15 , 16 , 25 ] .
poor interpersonal interactions resulted in anxiety and shame , and jan et al .
[ 15 ] noted that it ' decreased [ aboriginal women 's ] sense of self - worth and left them with feelings of inferiority ' ( p. 18 ) .
addressing interpersonal barriers was at the core of interventions to provide culturally - appropriate services .
employing staff members who shared linguistic and / or cultural backgrounds with target groups was the most common strategy [ 1 , 14 - 19 , 21 - 26 ] .
interventions also sought to build relationships and trust with target groups through friendly , non - judgmental , culturally - sensitive and respectful interactions [ 1 , 15 , 25 , 26 ] ; an empowering approach giving women choice [ 15 , 18 ] ; and continuity of care [ 1 , 15 , 22 ] .
studies reported that improvements in interpersonal interaction were at the forefront of facilitating their interventions .
conversely , some studies described continuing problems with interpersonal care as barriers to implementation .
a study in peru indicated that building trust should receive more attention than it had already been afforded in their intervention [ 20 ] .
other studies noted that their interventions had been unable to surmount all challenges of interpersonal care .
for example , a study in the uk was unable to hire female doctors to reduce target women 's discomfort with male doctors [ 19 ] .
studies also noted that problems with communication continued when the ' cultural broker ' was not present [ 19 , 26 ] .
the latter point connects with the next and final theme .
cohesiveness along the continuum of care interventions frequently focused on one part of the continuum of care .
for example , some interventions focused on making anc services culturally - appropriate for specific groups of women , while care provided at birth to the same women was standard ( i.e. , not culturally adapted ) [ 15 ] .
other interventions introduced an additional layer of ' cultural brokers ' , but the same health professionals continued to provide skilled care [ 18 , 26 ] .
these situations demand the building of effective partnerships and collaboration across providers or parts of the service .
in particular , several studies highlighted problems when other providers that women came into contact with through pregnancy until after birth were not ( as ) committed to principles of cultural appropriateness .
jan et al .
[ 15 ] sought to address this issue by providing cultural awareness sessions for local hospital staff .
a lack of cohesiveness was acknowledged as a barrier to successful implementation of a prenatal nursing case management intervention for mexican - american women in oregon [ 26 ] .
staff had little control over other services their intervention sought to promote , which meant they were unable to ensure that women received culturally - appropriate care from other health care providers , despite efforts to ensure this within their own programme .
indeed , thompson et al .
[ 26 ] noted that women continued to face poor interpersonal care by doctors who ' were not accustomed to the demands of this patient population and faced little prospect of financial reward ' ( p. 87 ) .
more generally , effective partnerships between the culturally - appropriate service and other providers that women and their families may encounter across the continuum of care from pregnancy until after birth is needed to ensure women receive a seamless service .
papers emphasised the need to forge links and coordinate with other service providers , and where possible to strive for information systems that prevent duplication [ 1 , 15 , 21 ] .
an intervention in peru improved links between service providers , community health workers and traditional birth attendants ( tbas ) , leading to a convergence of goals and improved referrals [ 5 ] .
in contrast , kildea et al .
[ 1 ] found duplication between the culturally - appropriate service and mainstream services to be problematic in their intervention : ' suboptimal communication between hospital and community - based providers contributed to operational inefficiencies [...] in the absence of standardised protocols and reliable systems for information sharing , multi - agency maternity provision is not ideal and indeed , may impact negatively on the quality of care provided ' ( p. 10 ) .
conclusion the studies include a range of interventions implemented with diverse populations in different contexts to provide culturally - appropriate services .
while there are no one - size - fits - all rules to implementation , the findings and experiences of the 15 studies examined in this paper show that such interventions can make services more acceptable to the targeted populations and increase uptake of services .
these implementation experiences highlight four key categories of enablers or barriers : accessibility ; community participation ; person - centred , respectful care ; and cohesiveness along the continuum of care .
how do these enablers , barriers and stakeholder perspectives relate to the interventions' effects on the care - seeking outcomes we reviewed ?
table 2 illustrates the links between implementation factors and the reviewed studies' reported effects on care - seeking outcomes .
three of five studies that included empirical data on community perspectives reported positive effects and high levels of satisfaction with the intervention [ 5 , 15 , 22 ] .
the other two studies that found no improvements in uptake of services reported satisfaction with some elements of the intervention but not others [ 1 , 26 ] .

two studies that did not find positive effects described persistent transport problems as a possible barrier to success [ 1 , 26 ] , though thompson et al. sought to address this challenge through the intervention .
out - of - pocket costs were a greater barrier in some contexts than others due to differences in health care financing arrangements , but two studies that reported no improvements in care - seeking outcomes reported cost as a continuing barrier [ 20 , 26 ] .
these implementation factors therefore need to be addressed if care - seeking is to be improved .
some level of community participation - at a minimum dialogue with communities - was an important component of several interventions reporting positive effects on uptake of care .
studies that found no improvements in uptake of care largely did not refer to community participation [ 1 , 19 , 25 , 26 ] .
improving interpersonal interaction was reported as a fundamental element of almost all interventions to provide culturally - appropriate care , so this element did not necessarily distinguish interventions that reported improvements in care - seeking outcomes from those that did not .
but two studies that did not find improvements reported that poor interpersonal interaction by other health care providers women encountered along the continuum of care through pregnancy until birth remained a barrier to women 's use of services [ 1 , 26 ] .
this finding relates to the challenge of ensuring cohesiveness across the continuum of care .
we acknowledge this paper 's limitations .
first , the same limitations apply as those detailed for the systematic review [ 13 , 27 ] .
in particular , the possibility of publication bias means that we may not have captured the full range of implementation barriers and facilitators .
second , because our interest lay in how implementation factors relate to the success of interventions in increasing uptake of skilled maternity care , we considered only the interventions with impact evaluations included in the review .
the literature on interventions excluded from our systematic review is broader geographically and describes additional interventions to provide culturally - appropriate care [ 27 ] .
this broader literature underscores that efforts are being made in many settings to address and incorporate culture into maternity care .
a review of this literature may provide further insight into implementation factors , but it was beyond the scope of our review .
third , a large portion of our data for this paper was drawn from the background and discussion sections of these papers , and this information was based on authors' informed views on the reasons for their interventions' success or lack of success .
only five studies reported empirical data on implementation factors , and they were not always reported in detail .
the latter point demonstrates the need for future intervention studies to incorporate and report process evaluations that provide data and insight into pathways from interventions to outcomes .
in interventions such as these , the number of variables that may have implications for effectiveness is infinite .
the limited scope of the current evidence base means that we do not currently know what works , in what context , and at what stage on the continuum of care through pregnancy until after birth .
to develop such understanding , we need to increase the volume of studies evaluating these interventions , and for the reporting of these studies to include reflexive insights on their contexts , such as funding and politics .
only four studies mentioned factors related to funding and sustainability [ 5 , 15 , 17 , 18 ] .
the level of detail varied and was limited , with one study praising the programme 's ' relatively low cost ' [ 17 ] and another noting that trained lay workers could easily replicate the ' very cost - effective ' intervention [ 18 ] .
studies should also include deeper consideration of wider implications , particularly where specific groups are targeted with separate , tailored services .
these studies also need better definitions and standardisation so that they contribute to a body of evidence rather than a disparate collection of studies [ 13 ] .
this standardisation of definitions , evaluation , and reporting would promote our understanding of what differences in contexts or conditions explain differentials in success .
a body of evidence is emerging for interventions with indigenous populations in australia , but it is still lacking on a global scale .
many of the implementation factors we highlight in this paper overlap with elements that are recognised as important for improving global maternal and newborn health more generally , including addressing barriers to access , community participation , providing high - quality respectful care , and improving continuity of care .
what makes them so pertinent in this review is that they are compounded by cultural and linguistic differences , and the targeted groups are among the most vulnerable in their respective societies .
thus , although the included studies are concentrated in high - income countries , the findings are likely to be relevant also to low - and middle - income countries , where a growing body of literature has described low quality of care and disrespect in maternity services [ 10 , 32 , 33 ] .
if researchers , programmers and policymakers are going to address inequalities in maternity care and maternal health outcomes , an improved evidence base that moves beyond simple recommendations that ' cultural factors should be taken into account ' is urgently needed .
substantive investment is also required to improve health managers' and health providers' abilities to interact with these groups and improve the responsiveness of services .

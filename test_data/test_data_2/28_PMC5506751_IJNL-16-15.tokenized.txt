background : interleukin ( il ) - 17 / il - 23 axis performs a prominent role in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune disorders .
this study aimed to investigate the concentrations of il - 17 in patients with multiple sclerosis ( ms ) and its relationship with gender , medication , disease forms and single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snp ) in il - 23r gene , including rs11209026 and rs1004819 .
methods : the blood specimens were obtained from 135 healthy individuals and 135 ms patients .
the patients exhibited relapsing - remitting ( rrms ; n = 65 ) , primary progressive ( ppms ; n = 19 ) , secondary progressive ( spms ; n = 35 ) or progressive relapsing ( prms ; n = 14 ) ms. the dna was analyzed for snps using polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism ( pcr - rflp ) and il - 17 concentrations were measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) .
results : we have observed elevated serum il - 17 concentrations in ms patients compared with healthy individuals ( p < 0.001 ) .
the men with ms had higher il - 17 concentrations than women patients ( p < 0.050 ) .
untreated patients had significantly higher il - 17 concentrations than healthy individuals and treated patients ( p < 0.001 and p < 0.010 , respectively ) .
the il - 17 concentrations were significantly decreased in patients treated with interferon - beta ( ifn - beta ) , methylprednisolone or both drugs as compared with untreated ms patients ( p < 0.050 , p < 0.020 and p < 0.050 , respectively ) .
the il - 17 concentrations were also significantly higher in patients with rrms and prms compared with healthy individuals ( p < 0.005 and p < 0.010 , respectively ) .
the genetic variations at snps rs11209026 and rs1004819 were not significantly different between healthy individuals and patients .
the il - 17 concentrations were not influenced by genetic variations at investigated snps .
conclusion : these results indicated higher levels of il - 17 in ms patients that may be influenced by disease patterns , medication and gender .
no association was observed between investigated snps and ms. key words multiple sclerosis interleukin - 17 gender treatment interleukin - 23 receptor gene polymorphisms introduction multiple sclerosis ( ms ) is a chronic autoimmune - mediated disease of the central nervous system ( cns ) that leads to neuronal demyelination and axonal degeneration.1 the clinical courses of ms are defined as relapsing - remitting ( rrms ) , primary progressive ( ppms ) , secondary progressive ( spms ) or progressive relapsing ( prms ). 1 the lymphoid cells , in particular , cd4 + t - helper ( th ) lymphocytes play a fundamental role in the development of ms and its animal model named experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( eae ). 2 functionally , separate th lymphocytes are differentiated from naive t cells after antigenic stimulation including th1 , th2 , th17 or regulatory t ( treg ) lymphocytes.2 both interferon ( ifn ) - gamma - producing th1 cells and interleukin ( il ) - 17 - producing th17 cells are accountable for demyelination in ms and eae diseases.2,3 in contrast , the treg cells may confer protection against diseases while the th2 role remains obscure.2,4 elevated concentrations of a th17 cell - associated chemokine ( ccl20 ) and diminished levels of a th2 / treg cell - related chemokine ( ccl22 ) were indicated in patients with ms.5,6 th17 cells are characterized by the production of a large number of pro - inflammatory cytokines which include mainly il - 17a ( also called il - 17 ) , il - 17f , tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) , il - 21 , il - 22 , ccl20 and granulocyte monocyte - colony stimulating factor ( gm - csf ). 3,7 il - 17 can influence various cell types such as epithelial cells , endothelial cells , fibroblasts , myeloid cells and synoviocytes.8 il - 17 elicits the release of different pro - inflammatory mediators such as cxcl1 , cxcl6 , cxcl8 il - 1b , il - 6 , tnf - alpha , gm - csf , macrophage inflammatory protein - 2 ( mip - 2 ) , monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ( mcp - 1 ) and granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( g - csf ). 3,8 il - 17 also acts as a powerful inducer of neutrophil aggregation into the inflammatory tissues.3 th17 cells perform an essential function in the development of a number of autoimmune disorders ( such as ms , inflammatory bowel disease , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus and psoriasis ) and allergy and asthma.9 il - 23 is a heterodimer cytokine that is composed of two polypeptide including p19 subunit ( specific for il - 23 ) and p40 subunit ( shared with il - 12 ). 10 the il - 23 receptor is also a heterodimeric molecule and composed of il - 23r and il - 12rbeta1 which bind to p19 and p40 subunits , respectively.10 the main producers of il - 23 are dendritic cells and macrophages and its function is to increase the full activation and maintenance of th17 lymphocytes.10 the antigenic stimulation in presence of both il - 6 and transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta ) induces the early differentiation of naive cd4 + t cells to th17 lymhocytes.11 however , subsequent interaction with il - 23 is needed for reinforcement and pathogenic activities of th17 lymhocytes .
indeed , tgf - beta and il - 6 - induced th17 lymphocytes are less pathogenic and more exposure to il - 23 is needed for development of inflammatory th17 lymphocytes.10,12 the relationship between il - 23 / il - 17 axis and a number of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus,13 spondyloarthritis,14 psoriatic arthritis,15 graves' disease,16 crohn 's disease,17 and eae and ms18 has been reported .
the il - 23r gene is located on the chromosome 1p31.3 that encodes the receptor for il - 23.19 the association of the il - 23r gene polymorphisms with several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis,20 psoriatic arthritis,21 allergic rhinitis,22 rheumatoid arthritis,23 and systemic lupus erythematosus24 has been reported .
recently , in one study the associations of several single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) within il - 23r gene ( rs2201841 , rs10889677 and rs7517847 ) with ms have been investigated in a chinese population and showed no association between these snps and ms disease.25 the snp rs11209026 ( arg381gln ) leads to replacement of arg with gln within the il23r - binding domain for the jak2 kinase , and therefore may change the downstream signaling pathways and responses to il - 23.19,26 the much less common glutamine allele seems to protect against some autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease , psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis.19,27 the association of snp rs11209026 with a number of immune - related diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease,28 psoriasis,29 crohn 's disease30 has also been reported .
the snp rs1004819 is located in the intronic region of the il - 23r gene and may exert its influence by regulating the splicing of il - 23r mrna.19 however , a considerable association between snp rs1004819 with ulcerative colitis31 and ankylosing spondylitis19 has also been indicated in other investigations .
the aforementioned snps may influence the expression and function of the il - 23r ; however , their relationship with ms have not been investigated in iranian populations , yet .
although a number of studies have evaluated the contribution of il - 17 in the development of ms , its concentrations have not been assessed adequately in ms patients with respect to gender , medication , forms of ms and il - 23r gene polymorphisms , .
accordingly , this study was conducted to assess the concentrations of il - 17 in patients with ms and its relationship with gender , medication , disease patterns and snps in il - 23r gene , such as rs11209026 and rs1004819 .
materials and methods a total of 135 ms patients ( 29 men and 106 women ) referring to the shephah hospital of kerman ( a city placed in southeast iran ) were enrolled into the investigation .
sixty five patients presented with rrms , 19 presented with ppms , 14 had prms and 35 presented with spms .
the diagnosis of ms was verified by expert neurologists based on the reliable diagnostic findings including clinical and paraclinical examinations [ magnetic resonance imaging , presence of oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) and evoked potentials according to the mcdonald 's criteria.32 the ms patients were classified as newly diagnosed ( untreated ) patients ( n = 47 ) who were not treated with any drug , and previously diagnosed ( treated ) patients ( n = 88 ) who were treated with methylprednisolone ( intravenously by a dose of 1000 mg / day for 3 to 5 days after acute ms attack ) , ifn - beta [ avonex ( biogen idec co , usa ; 30 mug intramuscularly , one time weekly ) , cinnovex ( cinnagen co , iran ; 30 mug intramuscularly , once time weekly ) or rebif ( merck biopharma co , germany ; 44 mug subcutaneously , three times weekly )] for at least 3 months .
a number of ms patients initially received ifn - beta ( during silent phase of disease ) and later methylprednisolone after having an acute attack of ms. also 135 healthy individuals including 35 men and 100 women were enrolled into the investigation as a control group .
the healthy individuals were selected among blood donors referring to the blood transfusion organization of kerman and were interviewed regarding cns disorders and none of them had cns or other related disorders .
all control individuals were basically healthy , with no acute or chronic sickness .
indeed individuals with illness ( such as any suspected immunological disorders , history of recurrent infections , asthma , allergy and atopic diseases ) , cigarette smoking and those taking any medication were excluded from the study .
the other exclusion criteria were malignancy , surgery and major trauma within 6 months prior to blood collection .
the ethical committee of kerman university of medical sciences evaluated and approved the investigation .
in addition , the participants were enrolled into the study on their own wish and informed written consent was also obtained from all of them .
a peripheral blood specimen ( 2 - 4 ml ) was taken from all participants and the sera were separated and stored at - 70 degreesc until analysis .
dna extraction and genotype analysis : genomic dna was separated from peripheral white blood cells by salting out technique as previously described by miller , et al.33 the purity and the quantity of dna specimens were determined by the detection of the optical density at 260 and 280 nm wavelengths using a spectrophotometry system ( ependorf , germany ) .
dna specimens were kept at - 20 degreesc until testing .
the genetic variations at snps rs11209026 and rs1004819 in il - 23r gene was determined by utilization of polymerase chain reaction - restriction length polymorphism ( pcr - rflp ) technique .
the pcr reaction mixture was formed by adding following reagents to a 0.2 - ml microcentrifuge tube on ice : 2.5 mul of taq dna polymerase buffer ( 10x ) , 0.5 mul of mgcl2 ( stock concentration 1.5 mm ) , 0.5 mul of each dntp [ datp , dctp , dgtp , and dttp ( stock concentration of 10 mm )] , 1 mul of each primer , 1 mul of prepared dna , and sterile double - distilled water to a final volume of 25 mul .

amplification was done with the following thermocycler program : one early phase of 94 degreesc for 5 minutes , followed by 35 cycles of 95 degreesc for 30 seconds , 61 degreesc for 1 minute and 72 degreesc for 90 seconds .
the amplified pcr product of il - 23r gene covers the snp rs11209026 with a molecular size of 350 bp. the hpy1 88i ( fermentase , finland ) restriction enzyme had been used for digestion of the pcr product .
the digested products were electrophoresed on a 2.5 % agarose gel after adding 4 mul of loading buffer ( cinnagen , iran ) and studied on chemi - doc model xrs ( bio - rad , usa ) after staining with ethidium bromide .
as reported previously,19 in the situation of heterozygotic form ( ag ) , four different fragments with 285 , 250 , 65 and 35 bp are produced .

this difference may attribute largely to the effect of sex hormones .
in a number of experimental models of inflammatory diseases , it has been indicated that the frequency of th17 lymphocytes was higher in male as compared with female gender and this phenomenon has been attributed to the inhibitory effects of estrogen on the th17 cells differentiation.39 the results obtained from our study demonstrated that the patients presenting rrms and prms patterns had significantly higher serum il - 17 concentrations in comparison with healthy individuals .
although serum il - 17 concentrations in patients presenting with ppms were also markedly higher than healthy individuals , but the difference did not reached to a significant value ( p < 0.060 ) .
these results represented that il - 17 may contribute at least to the pathogenesis of rrms and prms patterns .
consistent with our results , higher frequency of th17 lymphocytes were reported in patients presenting with rrms , spms and ppms.40,41 serum il - 17 concentrations were similar in patients presenting with spms and control individuals .
in agreement with our finding , the results reported by frisullo , et al. also showed no significant difference between patients presenting spms and healthy individuals regarding the il - 17 production by their pbmc .
therefore , it has been proposed that the initial phase of ms disease is strongly associated with il - 17.42 based on the present results , the serum concentrations of il - 17 were significantly lower in patients treated with ifn - beta and / or methylprednisolone compared with untreated patients .
it has been reported that ifn enhances activation - induced apoptosis in th17 lymphocytes through binding to its receptor that is expressed on these cells.43 moreover , ifn - beta down - regulates the expression of rorgammat , il - 17a and il - 23r , but up - regulates the expression of il - 10 in the cd4 + t lymphocytes.44 the diminished expression of il - 27 in the cns of eae mice was observed in our previous study.45 ifn - beta may mediates its therapeutic effects through the induction of il - 27 production , which in turn inhibits th17 cell - related responses.46 the pbmc from non - responder ms patients to ifn - beta therapy produced lower il - 27 concentrations than responder patients following in vitro stimulation.46 the modulatory effects of methylprednisolone on th17 lymphocytes were reported in a number of studies .
methylprednisolone down - regulates the production of il - 17 by pbmc from asthmatic children or patients with rheumatoid arthritis.47,48 moreover , the reducing effects of methylprednisolone on the frequency of th17 lymphocyte were demonstrated in patients with ms disease.49 in addition , ifn - beta and methylprednisolone may up regulate the expression of il - 35 ( a treg - type cytokine ) in ms patients.50 based on the present results , the immunomodulatory effects of ifn - beta and / or methylprednisolone may perform in part , via the inhibition of the il - 17 production .
we found no significant differences for frequencies of genotypes and alleles at snps rs11209026 and rs1004819 between patients with ms and healthy individuals .
these data represent that investigated snps may have no association with ms disease .
several mechanisms have been suggested by which polymorphisms can change the function of the receptor .
the snps may also influence the expression of the il - 23r ( e.g. by enhancing mrna stability ) , therefore , they reinforce the differentiation of native t cells towards a th17 cells which results in an increased secretion of other inflammatory cytokines .
however , our results represent that ms may develop through the mechanisms independent of snps rs11209026 and rs1004819 .
the results of a number of studies have reported no association between the snp rs1004819 and immune - related diseases including ankylosing spondylitis,51 systemic lupus erythematosus,52 inflammatory bowel disease53 and rheumatoid arthritis.23 it should be also noted that a snp may be in disequilibrium linkage with other snps , unlikely conferring independent influence .
no significant differences were observed between subjects with various genotypes or alleles at snps rs11209026 and rs1004819 with respect to serum il - 17 concentrations neither in ms patients nor in healthy individuals .
these results represent that the serum concentrations of il - 17 were not influenced by genetic variations at snps rs11209026 and rs1004819 in ms patients .
it has been reported that the snp rs11209026 influences serum il - 17 concentrations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.26 whether snps rs11209026 and rs1004819 may affect il - 17 concentrations in cns or csf during the development of ms remains to be determined in future studies .
conclusion in conclusion , the results obtained from the current research showed higher il - 17 concentrations in ms patients , especially in patients with rrms and prms patterns .
treatment of ms patients with ifn - beta and / or methylprednisolone had reducing effects on the il - 17 levels .
the serum levels of il - 17 may also be influenced by the gender of patients .
however , there was no association between the investigated snps rs11209026 and rs1004819 and ms. also the serum levels of il - 17 were not influenced by genetic variations at snps rs11209026 and rs1004819 .

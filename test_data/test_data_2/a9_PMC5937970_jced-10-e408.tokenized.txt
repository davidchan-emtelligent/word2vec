excessive gingival display is an esthetic concern for patients .
it is a condition in which an overexposure of the maxillary gingiva (> 3mm ) is present during smiling .
there are different etiologies of a gummy smile , such as vertical maxillary excess , short and hyperactive upper lip , altered passive eruption , anterior dentoalveolar extrusion , or a combination of these causes .
the correct diagnosis of all etiologic factors is imperative for its appropriate management .
many techniques have been used to restore the dentogingival relation for the management of gummy smile .
lip repositioning is a conservative surgical technique used to treat excess gingival display .
it is a largely unknown treatment modality .
this limits lip elevation on smiling and increases lip fullness .
this technique was designed to be shorter , less aggressive and to have fewer postoperative complications compared to orthognathic surgery .
in the current case series presents three patients who were successfully managed with lip repositioning .
the aim of this article is to describe the lip repositioning technique to decrease gummy smile by a simple surgical procedure .
key words : lip repositioning , gummy smile , smile harmony .
introduction excessive gingival display ( egd ) , commonly termed gummy smile , is a condition characterized by an overexposure of the maxillary gingiva while smiling ( 1 ) .
it is distinguished by showing more than 1.5 - 2 mm of the gingiva ( 2 ) .
the amount of discrepancy considered unattractive varies between populations ; however , an excess of more than 3 mm is agreed upon worldwide ( 1 - 3 ) .
egd may result from a single discrepancy , but is more commonly the result of an interplay of multiple factors .
proper diagnosis of etiological factors is essential to select the right treatment protocol .
the aetiology of egd is variable : related to bony maxillary excess , related to conditions causing gingival enlargement , related to deficient maxillary lip length or related to excessive mobility of maxillary lip ( 4 ) .
many techniques have been used to restore the dentogingival relation for the management of gummy smile .
such techniques include crown lengthening procedures , orthodontic leveling of the gingival margins of maxillary teeth , maxillary teeth intrusion , lip repositioning , orthognatic surgery and nonsurgical procedures like the use of the botulinum toxin ( 5 ) .
anterior dentoalveolar extrusion is treated with orthodontic intrusion and vertical maxillary excess is treated with orthognatic surgery .
however , in cases with minor vertical discrepancy , the cost , invasiveness and postoperative morbidity of the procedure cannot always be justified for the outcome achieved ( 1 ) .
lip repositioning procedure was first described in 1973 by rubinstein and kostianovsky as part of medical plastic surgery .
later on , it was introduced in dentistry , after being modified in 2006 by rosenblatt and simon .
it is a conservative permanent surgical technique that offers a less invasive approach to egd .
the surgery aims to limit smile muscle pull ( zygomaticus minor , levator anguli , orbicularis oris , and levator labii superioris ) by reducing the depth of the upper vestibule ( 2 ) .
the aim of this article is to describe the lip repositioning technique to decrease gummy smile by a simple surgical procedure .
case reports - patient profiles and consent three patiens , aged from 48 to 65 years , presented between 2014 and 2016 with the chief complaint of a " gummy smile " ( fig.1a , 2a , 3a ) .
they had previously been treated with orthodontics ( fig. 2b ) and esthetic crown lengthening .
all of them were categorized as having egd .
written informed consent was obtained following a discussion of risks , benefits , and treatment alternatives .
intra - and extraoral photographs were taken for planning and records .

- surgical procedure first , adequate local anesthesia was achieved .
the technique consists in doing an elliptical incision in the depth of the vestibule .
a marking pencil was used to outline the borders of the elliptical incision ( fig.1b , 2c , 3b ) .
the inferior border of the incision was placed at the mucogingival junction and was extended from the mesial aspect of the first premolars bilaterally .
as a general rule , it has been suggested that the distance between the superior and inferior borders must be twice the length of repositioning desired in the smile .
partial - thickness incisions were made using a scalpel across the superior and then the inferior border ( fig.1c , 2d , 3c ) .
the outlined mucosa is removed by partial thickness dissection , exposing the underlying connective tissue ( fig.1d , 2e , 3d ) .
the area of frenectomy was approximated with a simple interrupted suture to ensure symmetry and proper midline placement ( fig. 1e , 2f , 3e ) .
the remaining closure bilaterally was completed with interrupted sutures to stabilize the new mucosal margin to the gingiva .
nonresorbable sutures were used ( 3 - 0 silk ) ( fig.1f , 2g , 3f ) .
- postoperative instructions prescriptions for analgesics ( ibuprofen 600 mg every 8 hours as needed ) and chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12 % ( gentle bathing of the surgical area twice daily for 2 weeks ) were given .
patient was instructed to apply ice packs at 20 minute intervals for 24 hours and soft diet during the first postoperative week .
oral hygiene can be reinstated after 48 hours .
additional instructions include avoiding any manipulation or mechanical trauma to the surgery and minimizing lip movements when smiling or talking the first 2 weeks postoperatively .
sutures were removed at the 1 - week postoperative visit ( fig. 1g , 3g ) .
the extraoral final situation can be observed in figures 1h , 2h and 3h .
discussion the aim of this article is to describe the lip repositioning technique to decrease gummy smile by a simple surgical procedure .
this technique was designed to be shorter , less aggressive and to have fewer postoperative complications compared to orthognathic surgery ( 7 ) .
proper diagnosis of the etiological factors is the first step to select the right treatment protocol .
the aetiology of egd is variable .
it may include extraoral or introaoral components .
the contraindications for this technique include the presence of a minimal zone of attached gingiva , which can create difficulties in flap design , stabilization and suturing .
another contraindication is several vertical maxillary excess ( vme ) .
degree ii vme has gingival and mucosal display of 4 to 8 mm. in the other hand , in degree iii vme more than 8 mm of soft tissue are seen .
in both cases , an interdisciplinary approach is required ( 7 ) .
in order to determine other factors that are not related with the hyperfunction of the upper lip elevator muscle , certain characteristics must be taken in account .
facial proportions must be symmetric in the three horizontal thirds , without identification of higher proportion of the inferior third , which could characterize an excessive maxillary vertical growth .
another factor to be evaluated is the distance between the gingival margin and cej , which ideally is < 1.5 mm. distances greater than 1.5 mm indicate an excessive gingival tissue covering the tooth crown , typical in altered passive eruption .
finally , the crown length - height relation must be evaluated .
the maxillary central incisor 's width must be about 80 % of its length , with an accepted variation between 65 % and 85 % , and the maxillary lateral incisors about 70 % ( 3 ) .
the technique described in the present cases is a modification of the original technique by rubinstein and kostianovsky , initially used in medical plastic surgery and adapted for use in dentistry ( 1 - 6 ) .
there is a modified technique in which the maxillary labial frenulum is maintained and two mucosal strips , one at each side of the frenulum , are removed ( 3 ) .
leaving the frenulum intact helps maintaining the position of the labial midline , prevents changes in lip symmetry and decreases the morbidity associated with the procedure , but limits the possibility of correcting egd in the region of the maxillary central incisors ( 1 ) .
for this reason , in the present cases not to maintain the frenulum was decided .
some authors believe that using a reversible procedure prior to definitive surgery is currently the best way for both the patient and doctor to preview the intended result before moving forward with elective surgery .
it consists in doing a mark along the proposed surgical resection .
once the area is marked , sutures are used to complete the reversible procedure .
this allows the upper board to be drawn down to the mucogingival junction , inverting and tucking behind the tissue proposed for excision .
at this point , photographs are taken and the patient is able to evaluate the potential result ( 6 ) .
despite , the limited availability of the studies focused on the outcome of lip repositioning , the systematic review published by tawfik et al. showed that lip repositioning successfully improved egd by 3.4 mm ( 2 ) .
the current study indicates that after 1 - year follow - up , this technique can produce stable results .
in conclusion , lip repositioning technique is a simple procedure that offers an excellent alternative to other procedures with higher morbidity rates .
in the present cases , the functional and aesthetic parameters required by the patients were achieved and they were satisfied with the outcome of the procedure .

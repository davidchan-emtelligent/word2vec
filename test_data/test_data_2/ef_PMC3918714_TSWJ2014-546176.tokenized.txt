an amphiphilic polymer rgd - peg - chol which can be produced in large scale at a very low cost has been synthesized successfully .
the synthesized intermediates and final products were characterized and confirmed by 1h nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum ( 1h nmr ) and fourier transform infrared spectrum ( ft - ir ) .
the paclitaxel - ( ptx - ) loaded liposomes based on rgd - peg - chol were then prepared by film formation method .
the liposomes had a size within 100 nm and significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel to b16f10 cell as demonstrated by mtt test ( ic50 = 0.079 mug / ml of rgd - modified ptx - loaded liposomes compared to 9.57 mug / ml of free ptx ) .
flow cytometry analysis revealed that the cellular uptake of coumarin encapsulated in the rgd - peg - chol modified liposome was increased for huvec cells .
this work provides a reasonable , facile , and economic approach to prepare peptide - modified liposome materials with controllable performances and the obtained linear rgd - modified ptx - loaded liposomes might be attractive as a drug delivery system .

introduction during the last decade , many reports have been focused on developing colloidal carrier systems for a variety of anticancer drugs to achieve targeted drug delivery to tumor sites and improve their intracellular uptake .
amphiphilic polymers have received increasing attention because of their desired chemical , interfacial , mechanical , and biological functions , which make them a suitable platform for sustained drug release [ 1 - 4 ] and a promising carrier for therapeutic agents ( especially poorly soluble drugs ) [ 5 ] .
meanwhile , the development of improved synthetic methodologies has greatly supported the growth of this field [ 6 , 7 ] .
liposomal delivery has been extensively investigated in cancer treatment .
to avoid rapid clearance of liposomes from the circulation by the reticuloendothelial system , sterically stabilized liposomes ( ssl ) have been developed .
the moieties of poly ( ethylene glycol ) s ( pegs ) as membrane active agents are commonly used within modern pharmaceutical chemistry , because it could extend in " mushroom " or " brush " chain conformation from the membrane plane towards the water solution and form thick hydrophilic layers at the membrane surface [ 8 ] .
the functionalization of peg allows subsequent attachment of biologically active or even cell - targeting molecules to prepare sterically stabilized liposomes which retain long survival time in circulation and target recognition [ 9 ] .
in our work , peg2000 was chosen since it can covalently attach to the lipid head group , undergo steric exclusion from the liposome surface , and play an important role in thermodynamic stability of liposomes by dehydrating the lipid bilayer [ 10 - 14 ] .
although differential accumulation of liposomes carrying drugs in tumor sites relative to normal tissues can be achieved by the effect of enhanced permeability and retention ( epr ) , it is still necessary to improve inefficient intracellular uptake of the entrapped anticancer drugs by the tumor cells by active targeting strategy [ 15 - 17 ] .
integrin is a family of cell surface receptors responsible for anchoring cells to the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) and they are overexpressed in the melanoma tumor cells and tumor endothelial cells [ 18 ] .
the rgd ( arg - gly - asp ) sequence can bind to several integrins such as integrin a v beta 3 and a 5 beta 1 [ 19 ] .
in this paper , we used a linear rgd peptide to construct an amphiphilic polymer cholesterol - poly ( ethylene glycol ) - rgd and used it to establish a rgd - modified liposomal drug delivery system for paclitaxel ( ptx ) , a natural antimicrotubule agent for treating a variety of solid tumors , such as ovarian cancer , breast cancer , and lung cancer [ 20 , 21 ] .
rgd - modified polymers have been investigated extensively and there are also reports about lipid - peg - rgd polymers which are similar to our work [ 22 , 23 ] .
these works are very extraordinary , impressive and laid a solid foundation for our study .
compared with their outstanding work , however , we also have our own advantages .
in our work , we choose cholesterol as biomembrane anchor instead of artificial lipids such as 1,2 - distearoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( dspe ) because of the fact that cholesterol gives liposomal systems similar mechanical and biological functions compared to dspe [ 24 - 27 ] and that the cost of cholesterol is over 100 times lower than that of dspe , which means it can be easily synthesized in large amounts on an industrial scale .
in our work , we choose ordinary peg instead of fmoc - peg - co2nhs , which had been reported , since ordinary peg is far more cost - efficient .
also the synthesis route we designed is more simple and facile , and there is no need to use purification methods such as hplc which cost more money and time .
in this way , our method leads to higher product rate and the possibility of producing in large scale .
the aim of this paper was to synthesize cholesterol - poly ( ethylene glycol ) - rgd amphiphilic polymer ( rgd - peg - chol ) and develop an rgd - modified ptx - loaded liposome for targeted drug delivery .
the rgd - modified ptx - loaded liposome has been extended to evaluate physicochemical properties such as particle size , morphologies , and zeta potential .
the drug release profile , cellular uptake , and antitumor activity of ptx liposomes were also investigated in vitro .

2.5 .

accurately weighed spc ( 39 mg ) , chol ( 13 mg ) , mpeg - chol ( 10 mg ) , and ptx ( 0.667 mg ) were first dissolved in 4 ml chloroform in a round - bottom flask , dried into transparent thin film on a rotary evaporator under vacuum at 30degreesc , and followed by vacuum dry overnight to remove any traces of organic solvent .
the lipid film was hydrated by 8 ml of milli - q water at 60degreesc for 20 min , after which the suspension was dispersed by a probe - type ultrasonicator for 5 min and sequentially extruded through a 0.8 mum and 0.2 mum pore size polycarbonate filter ( nuclepore , usa ) .
rgd - modified liposomes ( cgrgds ) were obtained by the same method above , except that mpeg - chol and rgd - peg - chol polymers with different mass ratios ( from 10 mg / 0 mg to 0 mg / 10 mg ) were dissolved in chloroform along with spc , chol and ptx , or coumarin - 6 before the thin film was prepared .
to determine the drug loading ( dl ) and encapsulation efficiency ( ee ) of the ptx - loaded liposomes , 1 ml liposome was diluted in 1 ml methanol , and then the ptx content was determined by high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) .
in the analysis , a lc - 20ad ( shimadzu corp. , japan ) apparatus equipped with a spd - 20a uv detector ( shimadzu corp. , japan ) and a dionex acclaim 120 rp - c18 column ( dionex corp. , usa ) ( 250 x 4.6 mm ) were used .

3. results and discussion 3.1 .
synthesis of rgd - peg - chol as shown in figure 1 , the multiplet at delta 3.5 - 3.8 was attributed to the repeating units ( - ch2 , c ) in peg or mpeg. and the multiple signals at delta 7.40 - 7.78 came from benzene ring from fmoc .
the multiple signals at delta 0.67 - 2.20 came from the protons in cholesterol .
the six - position protons ( - ch = ch - , a ) in cholesterol were found at delta 5.36 .
signals at delta 7.12 - 7.36 were assigned to phenylalanine .
as shown in the spectra of linker - peg - chol , cholesterol and 3 - maleimidopropionic acid linker had been connected to peg chain successfully , and the peaks at delta 6.69 were attributed to the protons of linker ( - ch = ch - , h ) .
this result demonstrated that the linker had been conjugated to the chol - peg .
the weak peaks at delta 4.0 - 4.2 belonged to protons of rgd ( - nhch ( ch2 ) co - , e ) while peaks at delta 6.69 disappeared which indicated that the - ch = ch - had been broken .
the whole results told us that the synthesis of rgd - peg - chol was successful .
the ft - ir spectra of fmoc - phe - peg , fmoc - phe - peg - chol , and chol - peg - rgd were shown in figure 2 .
the broad band at around 3440 cm - 1 was attributed to the - nh2 stretching vibration of phenylalanine .
the sharp peak at 1733 cm - 1 was assigned to the - c = o of - cooco - group which was brought by the cholesterol monosuccinate .
the peak at 2880 cm - 1 was assigned to the - ch2ch2o - which was brought by peg .
other prominent peaks at 1282 cm - 1 and 1246 cm - 1 were assigned to the asymmetrical and symmetrical bending vibrations of - c - s - which were the introduction of rgd chain after combination of - sh from cysteine to the linker .
3.2 .
screening of blank liposome the base lipid used in this experiment is cholesterol 13 mg , soy lecithin 39 mg , and the added polymers a : mpeg - chol and b : rgd - peg - chol .
the weight of a plus b is kept at 10 mg , and different a / b mass ratios were tested in the preparation process of liposomes .
the results ( figure 3 ) show that as b rgd - peg - chol mass ratio increases , the particle size decreased from about 100 nm to 65 nm and that when mass ratios of a / b = 2 : 8 and 1 : 9 , it achieved a smaller particle size , but when there was no polymer a , the particle size increased again .
pdi and zeta potential of liposomes showed no obvious trend when the mass ratio of a / b changes from 10 : 0 to 0 : 10 .
3.3 .
the drug loading and final screening of a / b mass ratio based on the results of previous section , we selected a / b mass ratios of 2 / 8 and 1 / 9 , which bring optimum particle size and pdi results .
paclitaxel was employed in liposome formulation .
in this part , we set different mass ratios of ( a + b )/ ptx as 10 : 1 , 15 : 1 , 20 : 1 , and 30 : 1 to prepare liposomes encapsulating various amount of ptx .
then their size , pdi , zeta potential , drug loading ( dl %) , and the encapsulation efficiency ( ee %) were determined .
it is confirmed ( tables 1 and 2 ) that , when a / b mass ratio was set as 1 : 9 , the parameters were better than those with a / b mass ratio of 2 : 8 , and when we set mass ratio of ( a + b )/ ptx as 15 : 1 , after comprehensive assessment of particle size , pdi , ee % , and dl % , we got optimal ptx - liposome , which has a size of 58.94 nm , a pdi of 0.154 , zeta potential of 16.3 mv , dl % of 1.15 % , and ee % of 99.12 % .
3.4 .
characterization of rgd - modified ptx - loaded liposome the mean size of rgd - modified ptx - loaded liposome ( rgd - ptx liposome ) was 58.94 +/ - 4.82 ( mean +/ - sd ; n = 3 ) as shown in figure 4 , polydispersity index of 0.154 +/ - 0.10 ( mean +/ - sd ; n = 3 ) , with zeta potential of 16.3 +/ - 0.1 mv ( mean +/ - sd ; n = 3 ) which was shown in figure 5 .
when those preparations were stored at 4degreesc , there is no significant change of size within 28 days ( data not shown ) .
further transmit electronic microscopy analyses confirmed that the liposomes were kept in a good form with suitable size which was shown in figure 6 .
the hplc results showed that the load dose of rgd - ptx liposome was > 1 % and the entrapment efficiency was > 99 % .
drug - containing liposomes which have diameters with ranges of approximately 60 - 150 nm are small enough to extravasate from the blood vessels into the tumor interstitial space through their pores .
in contrast , the blood vessels in most normal tissues are nonfenestrated capillaries and liposome with ~ 120 nm in mean diameter did not accumulate in these normal tissues after i.v. injection .
the particle size of rgd - ptx liposome was below 100 nm with narrow distribution and high entrapment efficiency [ 31 ]. and this encourages us to hypothesize it may be possible that the liposome we made could obtain an improved therapeutic efficacy since it may accumulate more readily in tumor tissues .
3.5 .
stability test for rgd / ptx liposomes liposomes were sealed at 4degreesc in refrigerator , and the associated data were measured at the set time point ; the results confirmed that the prepared rgd / ptx liposomes were stable and showed no significant change in seven days ( shown in figure 7 ) .
3.6 .
in vitro release behavior of rgd / ptx liposome figure 8 shows the in vitro release profiles of free ptx and ptx - loaded rgd liposome in pbs at ph 5.5 and at ph 7.4 .
as expected , in pbs at ph 5.5 and ph 7.4 free ptx showed a very fast release profile , whereas rgd - ptx liposome released ptx in a much slower way in both release media .
in the first 24 hours , approximately up to 90 % of drug was released in free ptx .
in comparison , within the same period only 40 % of ptx in rgd liposome in pbs at ph 7.4 was released , and less than 50 % of ptx was released in pbs at ph 5.5 .
after 24 hours the release rate of ptx slowed down compared with the previous period of time and there was clearly a sustained release for at least 96 hours .
the cumulative release rate of rgd - ptx liposome was 59.02 +/ - 4.09 at ph 7.4 and 65.32 +/ - 3.88 at ph 5.5 , much slower than that of free ptx ( 98.67 +/ - 4.02 ) .
rgd - ptx liposome released ptx slightly faster in pbs with lower ph which indicated that rgd - ptx liposome might be ph - sensitive , which can be explained by faster hydrolysis of lipids at lower ph. also , this phenomenon can be attributed to the tendency that the oxygen atom on the hydrophilic end of rgd - peg - chol polymer would absorb more positive hydrogen ions and produce electrostatic repulsion which would destabilize liposome and increase drug release rate [ 32 ] .
because the microenvironments of intratumoral regions and intracellular compartments such as endosomes and lysosomes are acidic , rgd - ptx liposome might selectively deliver and release ptx to tumor tissue , indicating their potential applicability as a drug delivery system with reduced side effects to healthy tissues and increased drug concentration at the tumor site .
3.7 .
cellular uptake of liposomes by flow cytometry analysis a flow cytometry analysis was used to determine the cellular uptake of mpeg / coumarin - 6 liposome , rgd / coumarin - 6 liposome , blank liposome ( control ) .
figure 9 showed that uptake of rgd / coumarin - 6 liposome by huvecs was more than that of mpeg / coumarin - 6 liposome after 1 h incubation .
the mean fluorescence intensity of coumarin - 6 uptaken by huvecs treated with rgd liposome was increased by 50 percent ( mean = 15.87 versus 23.53 arbitrary units ) compared with that treated with mpeg liposome .
these results confirmed that rgd modification enhanced uptake of liposomal drug by integrin - overexpressing huvecs .
3.8 .
cell cytotoxicity of rgd - ptx liposome the cytotoxicity of rgd - ptx liposome , ptx liposome , blank liposome , and free ptx to b16f10 cells was compared .
as shown in figure 10 , the ic50 value of rgd - ptx liposome was decreased to 0.079 mug / ml compared with 9.57 mug / ml of free ptx and 0.302 mug / ml of ptx liposome , respectively .
the rgd - ptx liposome revealed more than 121 - fold and 4 - fold increase of cytotoxicity in comparison to free ptx and ptx liposome .
the blank liposomes show no apparent cytotoxicity to b16f10 cells .
the results may be explained by two mechanisms : firstly , the rgd fragments chemically conjugated to the chol - peg polymer enabled the ptx - loaded liposome to effectively target the surface of b16f10 , since increased expression of alpha v beta 3 integrins was seen in melanoma cells and the rgd peptide can specifically bind to the alpha v beta 3 integrins on melanoma tumor cells [ 33 ] ; secondly , the rgd - ptx liposome drug delivery system increased solubility of poorly soluble drugs , which persistently released the drug and enhanced the effect of ptx .
4. conclusions in summary , a novel amphiphilic polymer chol - peg - rdg has been synthesized and characterized .
the rgd / ptx liposomes have been successfully developed as a potential drug delivery system and the poorly soluble antitumor drug paclitaxel as model is loaded into the liposome .
the liposome is spheroid with regular shape , a size within 100 nm and showed increased cellular uptake and sustained in vitro drug release behavior .
flow cytometry analysis revealed that the cellular uptake of coumarin encapsulated in the rgd - peg - chol modified liposome was increased for huvec cells .
the in vitro cytotoxicity evaluated on the b16f10 cell lines by the mtt assay shows that rgd - ptx liposome has significantly enhanced cytotoxicity of paclitaxel for melanoma cells .
although further investigation on the amphiphilic polymer is required , the findings of our study represent an important step in advancing the use of rgd - peg - chol polymer modified liposome as a potential strategy to novel drug delivery system .

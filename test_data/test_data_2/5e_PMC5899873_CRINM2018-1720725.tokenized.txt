lyme neuroborreliosis is a rare cause of ischemic stroke ; it has only been described in case reports and mostly in europe .
diagnostic criteria have been proposed for lyme neuroborreliosis but the association with a cerebral ischemic presentation is not always straightforward .
we here describe the case of an 83 - year - old man for whom we strongly suspect lyme neuroborreliosis as the etiology of his stroke .
this case reminds us of the importance of a thorough history taking ( i.e. , tick bite ) and to perform the adequate ancillary tests accordingly ( lumbar puncture ) so as to propose validated treatment .
1. introduction lyme disease is the most common tick - borne illness in europe and the united states [ 1 ] .
it is caused by the spirochete borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato , and its incidence has shown a rise in the last few years .
11 % of the patients with b. burgdorferi infection present with neurological symptoms [ 1 ] , lymphocytic meningitis , cranial neuritis , and radiculoneuritis being the most common presentations .
lyme neuroborreliosis ( lnb ) can rarely present as a stroke due to cerebral vasculitis .
we here present a patient with ischemic stroke whose suspected etiology is lnb .
2. case presentation an 83 - year - old man presented to the emergency room with right - sided weakness and speech difficulties evolving for 24 hours .
he did not report any neurological or cardiovascular medical history .
neurological examination confirmed severe right hemiparesis and dysarthria .
brain ct scan showed a hypodensity in the left corona radiata .
angiographic sequences found a left m2 segment subocclusive stenosis .
mri studies confirmed a recent ischemic lesion in the left corona radiata as well as a small left parietal lesion ( figure 1 ) .
investigations did not reveal any argument for large vessel disease or cardiac source and the patient had no history of hypertension .
homocysteinemia was normal as well as lipid profile ; lupus anticoagulant was positive for this patient known neither for venous or arterial thrombosis nor for autoimmune disease .
infectious screening was negative for hiv , hsv2 , influenza , and rsv .
patient was immune for ebv , cmv , and hsv1 .
vdrl was negative .
lyme serology was positive on both elisa ( igm 1.5 and igg 7.3 ) and western blot .
medical history was then reassessed ; the patient described multiple tick bites in the past few years , without noticing any skin lesion evoking erythema chronicum migrans .
he also recalled having paresthesia with tingling in his hands and feet 2 years ago during 4 months .
a lumbar puncture yielded a normal cell count ( 1 m / l leukocytes and 89 m / l erythrocytes ) , but elevated protein level at 0.71 g / l , elevated albumin quotient ( 8.27 ) , and elevated igg synthesis in the csf ( 46 mg / l ) as well as increased specific csf / serum antibody index for lyme igg at 27.5 .
there were no oligoclonal bands .
considering the possibility of a stage 3 lnb with cerebrovascular complications , antibiotic treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g per day was administered for 14 days .
antiphospholipid antibodies were retested 6 weeks later and were all negative .
lyme serology was reassessed two months after antibiotic treatment and showed normal blood igm titers ( 0.9 ) .
the patient slowly improved and was discharged a few weeks later .
he could walk with a cane but still had a severe right arm paresis .
3. discussion lnb is a rare cause of stroke ; it has been mostly described in european case reports or case studies [ 2 - 4 ] .
nowadays there is no evidence for testing lyme disease in every patient with an ischemic stroke .
however , this can be considered in the following situations : when a patient comes from an endemic area , with a history of b. burgdorferi infection , when no other evident cause of stroke is found , and in case of multiterritorial strokes or radiological signs of vasculitis [ 2 , 3 ] .
regarding our patient , investigations for infectious or autoimmune diseases were performed because of a lupus anticoagulant antibody .
antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with different infectious diseases [ 5 ] .
even though this has been poorly described in lyme disease , greco et al. showed a frequent association in patients with chronic lyme disease [ 6 ] , possibly explained by molecular mimicry [ 7 ] .
in the presence of a lupus anticoagulant antibody and no obvious risk factors like hypertension , we considered further investigations for lyme disease , the more so as our patient lived in an endemic area ( western switzerland ) and had multiple tick bites in the past few months .
according to the european federation of neurological societies ( efns ) diagnostic criteria , our patient had a possible but not definite lnb because of absent csf pleocytosis [ 8 ] .
besides , the presence of igm lyme antibodies confirms a recent infection but does not prove it was the cause of the present stroke .
this case underlines the importance of a detailed medical history in order to guide investigations .
as our patient showed important residual symptoms with functional limitation ( walking difficulty , right arm paresis ) , this case reminds us that , even after standard pharmacological treatment , lnb can lead to long - term sequels [ 9 ] .
conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflicts of interest .

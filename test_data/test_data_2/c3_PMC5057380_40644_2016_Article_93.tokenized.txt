background evaluation of latest generation automated attenuation - based tube potential selection ( atps ) impact on image quality and radiation dose in contrast - enhanced chest - abdomen - pelvis computed tomography examinations for gynaecologic cancer staging .
methods this irb approved single - centre , observer - blinded retrospective study with a waiver for informed consent included a total of 100 patients with contrast - enhanced chest - abdomen - pelvis ct for gynaecologic cancer staging .
all patients were examined with activated atps for adaption of tube voltage to body habitus .
50 patients were scanned on a third - generation dual - source ct ( dsct ) , and another 50 patients on a second - generation dsct .
predefined image quality setting remained stable between both groups at 120 kv and a current of 210 reference mas .
subjective image quality assessment was performed by two blinded readers independently .
attenuation and image noise were measured in several anatomic structures .
signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) was calculated .
for the evaluation of radiation exposure , ct dose index ( ctdivol ) values were compared .
results diagnostic image quality was obtained in all patients .
the median ctdivol ( 6.1 mgy , range 3.9 - 22 mgy ) was 40 % lower when using the algorithm compared with the previous atcm protocol ( median 10.2 mgy . cm , range 5.8 - 22.8 mgy ) .
a reduction in potential to 90 kv occurred in 19 cases , a reduction to 100 kv in 23 patients and a reduction to 110 kv in 3 patients of our experimental cohort .
these patients received significantly lower radiation exposure compared to the former used protocol .
conclusion latest generation automated atps on third - generation dsct provides good diagnostic image quality in chest - abdomen - pelvis ct while average radiation dose is reduced by 40 % compared to former atps protocol on second - generation dsct .
keywords multidetector computed tomography cancer cancer staging neoplasms automated tube potential selection dual - source ct issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background contrast - enhanced chest - abdomen - pelvis computed tomography ( ct ) is the standard imaging procedure for oncologic staging .
it is widely available and allows evaluation of several anatomic structures such as lymph nodes , abdominal organs , lung and bony structures to detect malignancies in one comprehensive examination .
due to the increased amount of overall ct examinations [ 1 , 2 ] , radiation exposure should be used with care following the ' as low as reasonably achievable ' ( alara ) rule .
nevertheless , cancer might be life - limiting and cancer staging overweight risks of radiation exposure [ 3 - 6 ] .
however , patients with a detected malignancy in an early stage might receive multiple follow - up ct scans with an increased cumulative radiation dose and , therefore , an increased risk of radiation dose related disease [ 4 ] .
many techniques have been introduced to lower radiation exposure such as automated attenuation - based tube current and voltage modulation , noise reduction filters , and iterative reconstruction algorithms [ 2 , 6 - 15 ] .
automated attenuation based tube potential selection ( atps ) is routinely used in our department for oncologic staging and follow - up chest - abdomen - pelvis ct [ 16 , 17 ] .
the aim of our study is to evaluate image quality and radiation exposure of latest generation automated tube potential selection on a third - generation dual - source ct ( dsct ) in comparison to the second - generation dsct in gynaecologic oncology staging and follow up. methods patients this retrospective study was performed as a single - centre , observer - blinded study .
the institutional review board approved this study ; written informed consent requirement was waived .
a total of 100 patients ( 100 women , median age 62.5 [ range 31 - 86 years ]) underwent contrast - enhanced chest - abdomen - pelvis ct examinations for gynaecologic oncology staging between october 2013 and march 2016 .
general exclusion criteria for contrast - enhanced ct included impaired renal function ( estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml / min , calculated by creatinine blood level and patient age ) , hyperthyroidism , as well as hypersensitivity to iodine contrast media .
non - contrast scans were excluded .
in group 1 50 patients were examined on a second - generation 128 - slice dsct ( somatom definition flash , siemens healthcare , forchheim , germany ) using former generation of atps ( carekv , siemens , forchheim , germany ) with steps of 20 kv between 80 kv and 140 kv. group 2 included 50 patients who were examined on a third - generation 192 - slice dsct ( somatom force , siemens healthcare ) with the latest generation of atps which allows tube potential selection in steps of 10 kv between 70 kv and 150 kv. both imaging protocols were adjusted to a pre - defined image quality of 120 kv / 210 ref.mas ( table 1 ) .
patient populations were paired regarding age , body size and habitus .

[ 17 ] .
this is useful , because for a high - contrast situation used in ct - angiography , lowering of the kv leads to higher absorption and higher attenuation values of the vascular structures with additional possibility to safe radiation dose in low - kv ct scans .
in this study we set focus to an optimal contrast - enhanced parenchymal organ scan for cancer staging .
the automatically selected kv remained stable throughout the ct scan .
in addition , a real - time automatic mas - modulation software ( care dose 4d , siemens healthcare ) was used to further reduce radiation exposure .
ct examination two hours before the actual ct examination patients were told to start drinking oral contrast media ( micropaque , guerbet , villepinte , france ) for improved gastrointestinal delineation .
before the start of the ct scan , an intravenous contrast material bolus , containing 1 ml / kg of iodinated contrast material ( ultravist 370 , bayer - schering , germany ) , followed by a saline chaser of 40 ml was injected at 2 ml / s flow rate via an antecubital vein using a double - syringe power injector ( ct2 , medtron , saarbruecken , germany ) .
a fixed delay of 70 s post injection was used in order to obtain venous contrast .
all ct examinations were performed in a cranio - caudal direction starting from the upper thorax aperture down to the femoral ligaments .
in group 1 at a collimation of 128 . 0.6 mm , pitch 1.2 , and rotation time of 0.5 s , in group 2 at a collimation of 192 . 0.6 mm , pitch 1.2 , and rotation time of 0.5 s. ct data reconstruction for fast overviewing , images were reconstructed in 5 - mm slice thickness with a 5 - mm increment .
for detailed evaluation , data were additionally reconstructed with a slice thickness of 3 mm and increment of 1.5 mm using a medium - smooth soft - tissue convolution kernel ( b30f ) for parenchymal analysis and a hard convolution kernel for the analysis of bony structures and the lungs ( b70f ) .
to allow an image comparison independently of different available iterative reconstruction algorithms ( safire on 2nd generation dsct , admire on 3rd generation dsct , siemens healthcare ) , we selected filtered - back projection ( fbp ) reconstruction algorithms by purpose for both groups .
radiation dose estimations ctdivol and dlp values displayed in the patient 's protocol were recorded .
image quality subjective image quality was assessed by two radiologists individually with 4 and 7 years of experience in whole body imaging on a five - point rating scale : 1 = excellent : excellent definition of tumour and / or metastases , excellent delineation of the structures ; 2 = good : good definition of tumour and / or metastases , minimal image noise ; 3 = adequate : adequate definition of tumour and / or metastases , slight impact of image noise , sufficient for diagnosis ; 4 = poor : poor definition of tumour and / or metastases , low attenuation and difficult delineation of the structures , increased image noise , diagnostic confidence reduced ; 5 = unacceptable / nondiagnostic .
the most probable reasons for reduced image quality such as obesity , motion , metallic artefacts , contrast medium flow - related , and contrast timing were noted .
objective image quality analysis was performed by one radiologist with 7 years of experience in general radiology on a regular pacs workstation ( centricity 4.2 , general electric healthcare , munich , germany ) .
regions of interest ( roi ) were drawn in several anatomic regions such as aorta at the level of the pulmonary trunk , both lobes of the lung , left lobe of the liver , right lobe of the liver , pancreas , spleen , kidneys , gluteus maximus muscle , pelvic bone and pre - sternal in the air at the level of the pulmonary trunk .
attenuation and standard deviation of each roi were noted .
each measurement was performed four times to minimize bias .
average values for attenuation and standard deviation ( sd ) of each region were calculated .
background noise was determined as the standard deviation ( sd ) of the roi in the air .
signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) was determined according to the following equation : snr = attenuation / background noise ( table 3 ) .
tumour and / or metastases were evaluated and measured using tumour diameters for objective evaluation and , for subjective scoring , we evaluated whether the imaging modality might have affected the tumour staging .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using dedicated software ( stata / ic 13 , stata corp , college station , texas , usa ) .
continuous variables were reported as median and range , categorical variables as frequencies or percentages .
radiation parameters and quantitative image parameters ( e.g. noise , attenuation ) were tested using the wilcoxon mann - whitney u test as the data were nonparametric .
the relationship between patient diameter and automated kv selection was analysed using the spearman rank order correlation test .
the chi - square ( x2 ) test was used for categorical variables ( demographic patient data ) .
statistical significance was defined as a p - value above 0.05 .
differences between the both readers were assessed using cohen 's kappa ( j ) interpreted in the following way : j \ 0.20 , slight agreement ; j = 0.21 - 0.40 , fair agreement ; j = 0.41 - 0.60 , moderate agreement ; j = 0.61 - 0.80 , substantial agreement ; j = 0.81 - 1.0 , almost perfect agreement .
results radiation dose estimation in group 1 atps resulted in a tube voltage selection of 100 kv in 30 patients , 120 kv in 16 patients and 140 kv in 4 patients .
atps resulted in a tube voltage reduction to 90 kv in 19 cases , 100 kv in 23 patients , and 110 kv in 3 patients in group 2 .
4 patients were examined at 120 kv and 1 patient at 150 kv ( fig. 1 , table 1 ). fig. 1 choosen kv between both groups the median ctdivol in group 2 was 4.8 mgy ( 3.9 - 9.8 mgy ) at 90 kv , 6.3 mgy ( 5.3 - 9.0 mgy ) at 100 kv , 9.7 mgy ( 6.6 - 14.1 mgy ) at 110 kv , 11.5 ( 7.8 - 14.4 mgy ) at 120 kv and 22.0 mgy ( only one patient ) at 150 kv. in the baseline group the median ctdivol was 8.9 mgy ( 5.8 - 14.6 mgy ) at 100 kv , 13.2 mgy ( 7.1 - 17.4 mgy ) at 120 kv and 20.9 mgy ( 20.1 - 22.8 mgy ) at 140 kv. the overall comparison between both groups revealed a ctdivol of 6.1 mgy ( 3.9 - 22.0 mgy ) in the group 2 and a ctdivol of 10.2 mgy ( 5.9 - 22.8 mgy ) in group 1 .
comparing both groups revealed a statistical significant difference with a p - value < 0.01 ( table 2 ) .

the reasons for moderate image quality were discussed between both readers and , in all cases , due to difficulties in ruling out parenchymal lesions , some because of image noise , and some because of insufficiencies concerning the venous contrast enhancement .
concerning image quality in the control group , it was also rated as sufficient in all cases ( excellent : n = 44 good : n = 5 ; moderate : n = 1 ) .
inter - reader agreement on measurements was almost perfect ( j = 0.82 ) .
in summary , the image quality rating demonstrated , that all malignancies could be ruled out adequately and classified in a correct manner with respect to recist ( response evaluation criteria in solid tumours ) , without statistically significant differences between the two groups ( p = 0.4 , figs. 2 and 3 ) [ 18 ]. fig. 2 image quality comparison in parenchymal liver lesions .

one of the first studies on atcm performed by winklehner et al .
[ 19 ] evaluated automated attenuation - based kv selection in 40 patients for ct angiography of the aorta .
in this study , an overall radiation dose reduction of 25.1 % was observed , while keeping the image quality stable , when using a 120 kv protocol .
eller et al .
[ 20 ] evaluated automated attenuation - based kv selection in 100 patients .
they carried out an abdominal ct examination for 52 of the patients , and a thoraco - abdominal examination for 48 patients .
all examinations using automated attenuation - based kv selection resulted in a radiation dose reduction of at least 11.4 % ; in detail , 13.2 % in the abdominal ct group and 9.5 % in the thoraco - abdominal group .
gnannt et al .
[ 21 ] assessed automatic attenuation - based kv selection in 40 patients suffering from testicular cancer .
in this study , a ct scan of the chest was performed in a mixed arterio - venous phase and the abdominal ct examination was carried out in the portal - venous phase of enhancement .
the overall dose reduction was 12 % on average. with focus on cancer staging , beeres et al. evaluated automated tube potential selection in 110 patients compared to a 120 kv automated tube potential selection protocol [ 17 ] .
the overall dose reduction was 7.9 % in a randomly chosen cohort .
in all the studies mentioned above , there was no statistically significant worsening of subjective image quality .
in the study by beeres et al .
[ 17 ] , there was a dose reduction of 7.9 % , this is comparable to the study of eller et al .
[ 20 ] where there was a dose reduction of 9.5 % in chest - abdomen - pelvis ct examinations reported .
a recently published study of scholtz et al. compared atps on a second - generation dsct with fbp and third - generation dsct in combination with a new advanced modelled iterative reconstruction algorithm resulting in an average overall dose reduction of 34.9 % [ 16 ] .
however , in our study we used fbp in both groups to compare the plain dataset and to prevent from influence of iterative reconstruction algorithm .
our study showed an overall dose reduction in 40 % of the study population which meets with the study above .
the main driver in this dose reduction setting might be the possibility of the tube to select the potential in 10 kv steps compared to the former software .
the tube potential in our study switched only once to 150 kv compared with the cited studies , and a tube potential of 80 kv or below was n't automatically chosen in any case ( table 1 ) .
in vascular imaging , it is possible to examine the region of interest using a lower kv setting because of the high - contrast situation attained by the arterial phase of the contrast material .
in contrast , when parenchymal contrast is the clinical setting and the object in question , for example , when liver lesions have to be ruled out , automated attenuation - based tube potential selection might not lower the kv in the same aggressive manner as in vascular imaging ( fig. 1 ) .
applying the new algorithm combined with an x - ray tube system that is able to switch between different kv levels in 10 kv steps , an overall radiation dose reduction of 40 % was possible .
limitations some limitations of our study need to be addressed .
first , the overall number of patients in our study was small ; further studies with a larger cohort are required .
second , we did not record the body mass index , but measured patient diameter as an alternative .
third , while a patient cohort of 100 patients is sufficient for an initial experience , additional larger studies are necessary to assess further potential of this technique .
fourth , we did not investigate iterative reconstruction algorithms and the effects of atcm and iterative reconstructions in our study .
however , this has been evaluated in prior studies [ 16 , 22 ] .
conclusion our results demonstrate that atps in third - generation dsct allows tube voltage selection in steps of 10 kv resulting in an average dose reduction of 40 % compared to second - generation dsct and is feasible for oncologic chest - abdomen - pelvis ct examination in clinical routine while overall image quality remains excellent .

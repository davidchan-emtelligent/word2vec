introduction magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) was used to study the hand and wrist in very early rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , and the results were compared with early and established disease .
methods fifty - seven patients fulfilling the new american college of rheumatology criteria for ra , 26 with very early ra ( vera ) , 18 with early ra ( era ) , and 13 with established ra ( estra ) , ( disease duration < 3 months , < 12 months , and > 12 months , respectively ) were enrolled in the study .
mri of the dominant hand and wrist was performed by using fat - suppressed t2 - weighted and plain and contrast - enhanced t1 - weighted sequences .
evaluation of bone marrow edema , synovitis , and bone erosions was performed with the omeract ra mri scoring system .
results edema , erosions , and synovitis were present in vera , and the prevalence was 100 % , 96.15 % , and 92.3 % , respectively .
significant differences in edema and erosions were found between vera and estra ( p < 0.05 ) .
no significant difference was found in synovitis .
conclusions edema , erosions , and synovitis are findings of very early ra. mri , by detecting these lesions , may play an important role in the management of these patients .
introduction rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease characterized by prominent joint manifestations .
inflammation of the synovial membrane leads to the formation of a highly cellular inflammatory tissue , the pannus , which , by eroding cartilage and bone , leads to joint destruction and ankylosis [ 1 ] .
articular involvement of the hand and wrist has been considered a very frequent presenting finding [ 1 ] .
the presence of marginal erosions , seen on conventional radiographs of the hand and wrist , has been viewed as a specific and relatively sensitive diagnostic finding [ 2 ] .
conventional radiographs cannot assess synovitis , bone edema , and early marginal erosions [ 3 - 8 ] .
bone edema , erosions , and synovitis have been detected by magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) in patients with disease duration of < 1 year [ 3,4,8 - 15 ] .
bone edema and erosions are considered red flags for progression of bone damage in the future , and thus , modern concepts in ra imply that treatment with conventional disease - modifying antirheumatic drugs ( dmards ) and particularly biologic dmards , should ideally be started before erosive disease is detected [ 16 - 20 ] .
nevertheless , no studies have evaluated with mri the hand and wrist of patients with disease duration of less than 3 months .
the purpose of this study was to assess with mri in very early ra ( vera ) the prevalence and severity of hand and wrist involvement and to compare the involvement with early ra ( era ) and established ra ( estra ) .
materials and methods patients fifty - seven consecutive unselected patients with ra , according to the new criteria for ra [ 2 ] and without prior use of dmards , were enrolled in the study .
the 37 women and 20 men were aged 17 to 83 years ( mean , 57.52 +/ - 15.82 years ) .
according to disease duration , the patients were divided into three groups : group 1 , 26 patients with very early disease (< 3 months ) ( vera ) ; group 2 , 18 patients with early disease (< 12 months ) ( era ) ; and group 3 , 13 patients with established disease (> 12 months ) ( estra ) .
each patient underwent a complete physical examination by the same rheumatologist ( pvv ) .
clinical disease variables included the duration of morning stiffness ( minutes ) , grip strength ( mm hg ) , total joint count with tenderness or swelling , number of swollen joints , number of tender joints , and pain score ( on visual analogue scale ( vas ; centimeters )) .
laboratory disease variables included c - reactive protein ( crp ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) , rheumatoid factor ( rf ) , and anticitrullinated cyclic peptide ( ccp ) .
for assessing disease activity , the disease activity score for 28 joint indices ( das - 28 ) was calculated [ 21 ] .
an mri of the dominant hand and wrist was performed in the same mri unit ( 1.5 tesla ; gyroscan acs nt ; philips medical systems , best , the netherlands ) by using a surface coil with a 20 - cm field of view .
the patient lay prone with the arm to be studied extended overhead toward the midline .
the imaging protocol consisted of axial and coronal stir images with 2,500 , 60 , 160 ( repetition time , ms / echo time , ms / inversion time , ms ) 3 - mm slice thickness , 0.3 - mm intersection gap , 256 x 256 imaging matrix , coronal spin - echo t1 - weighted images with 500 , 16 ( repetition time , ms ; echo time , ms ) 3 - mm slice thickness , 0.3 - mm intersection gap , 256 x 256 imaging matrix ; and coronal spin - echo fat - suppressed , t1 - weighted images with 500 , 16 ( repetition time , ms / echo time , ms ) 3 - mm slice thickness , 0.3 - mm intersection gap , 256 x 256 imaging matrix before and coronal and axial images immediately after intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol / kg gd - dtpa .
intravenous contrast injection was performed through a vein in the contralateral arm .
diffusion of contrast material into joint effusions was avoided in coronal scans performed immediately after contrast administration ( duration of postcontrast coronal sequence , 2.5 minutes ) .
hand and wrist involvement was evaluated by using the omeract ra mri scoring system to assess bone edema ( figure 1 ) , erosions ( figure 2 ) ; and synovitis ( figure 3 ) [ 22,23 ] .
evaluations of all mri examinations were performed independently by two musculoskeletal radiologists ( pek , akz ) blinded to the patients' identity , clinical status , and disease duration .
stir images were evaluated for bone edema , and plain and contrast - enhanced fat - suppressed t1 - weighted coronal and axial images were evaluated for erosions and synovitis .
because the thinnest slice that could be obtained was 3 mm , attention was paid to avoid considering as bone erosions areas of irregular bone contours or ligamentous attachments [ 24 ] .
the study was approved by the institutional review board , and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects .

statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed with spss base 15 for windows .
interobserver variability was evaluated by using the pearson correlation coefficient .
analysis of variance ( anova ) , followed by the least significant difference test , was used to study differences between groups .
a p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results the clinical features of the patients are shown in table 1 .
the interobserver variability was r = 0.95 for edema , 0.95 for erosions , and 0.97 for synovitis .
bone edema , erosions , and synovitis were present in all groups of ra ( table 2 ) .
analysis of variance demonstrated that the three groups were significantly different for bone edema and erosions .
the least significant difference test revealed significant difference in bone edema and erosions between vera and estra ; p < 0.05 ( table 3 ) .
comparison between vera and era in terms of local distribution of lesions revealed significant difference in erosions of the mcp ( table 4 ) .

the distribution of erosions in separate joint areas in patients with vera and era revealed significant difference only in mcp joints ( ap < 0.05 ) .
no difference was found in bone edema and synovitis .
data are presented as mean ( sd ) .
no significant correlation was found between the imaging findings and the clinical ( duration of morning stiffness ( min ) , grip strength ( mm hg ) , total joint count with tenderness or swelling , number of swollen joints , number of tender joints and pain score on vas ( cm )) and laboratory findings ( crp , esr , rf , anti - ccp , and das - 28 ) .
discussion in this study , the omeract ra mri scoring system was applied to look for differences in bone edema , erosions , and synovitis between vera , era , and estra , and the major findings were ( a ) the presence of bone edema , erosions , and synovitis at the very early stages of ra ; and ( b ) a significant difference in bone edema and erosions between vera and estra .
mri is being used largely in the assessment of hand and wrist involvement of patients with ra [ 3,5 - 7,13 - 16 ] .
most of the studies have been performed in patients with late early and established disease .
only one study evaluated patients with disease duration less than 4 months [ 4 ] .
this study demonstrated an incidence of bone erosions of 45 % , but half of the patients were receiving dmards .
the present study demonstrated a very high incidence of bone erosions ( 96 %) in a treatment - naive population evaluated at a very early stage of ra. the lack of treatment and the evaluation of the mcp joints , which are characteristically affected in early ra [ 14 ] , may probably explain the difference in incidence of bone erosions .
previous studies , by demonstrating very early the presence of anti - ccp antibodies and rf , have suggested that the disease process in ra starts long before the onset of symptoms [ 25 ] .
this study , by demonstrating bone erosions in vera , reinforces this hypothesis .
another interesting finding of this study was the presence of bone edema in all patients with vera .
bone edema is a pre - erosive lesion that represents true inflammation and can be seen on mri alone or surrounding bone erosions [ 24 ] .
bone edema can be present at any stage of ra and has been associated with more - aggressive disease [ 26,27 ] .
lack of treatment that could decrease the aggressiveness of the disease process might probably explain the presence of bone edema in all patients with vera .
in this study , the presence of synovitis was independent of the disease duration , and the incidence was high in all groups .
in the vera group , the incidence of synovitis and bone erosions was almost similar .
the exact nature of the relation between synovitis and bone damage remains unclear .
the synovium seems to be the prime target in the inflammatory course of ra. conaghan et al [ 12 ] showed that in era , synovitis appears to be the primary abnormality , and bone damage occurs as a late effect in proportion to the level of synovitis but not in the absence of synovitis .
bone erosions are caused by direct invasion of pannus into bone but also by pro - osteoclastogenic imbalance , which is cytokine driven .
the pathogenic mechanism in the very early period of ra may be different from that in established disease .
current theories of the immunopathogenesis of ra suggest that abnormally sensitive to tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) - alpha bone marrow stem cells could travel via the systematic circulation to the subchondral bone marrow , where they initiate inflammatory and pre - erosive changes or could travel to the synovial membrane , where they promote synovial hyperplasia and inflammatory synovitis .
it seems that bone marrow edema represents a true inflammation in the bone and is a pre - erosive lesion that can be reversible .
irreversibility of bone edema with increasing disease chronicity is probably due to organization of the inflammation with formation of dense vascularized infiltration and activation of osteoclasts .
thus , in contrast to radiographic erosions that reflect bone damage that has already occurred , bone marrow edema represents early inflammatory infiltrates in the subchondral bone [ 27 - 29 ] .
in the current study , a significant difference in edema and erosions was demonstrated between vera and estra .
this is in agreement with previous studies , which , by using hand radiographs , showed that up to 60 % of the patients develop joint erosions at the end of the 1 year from disease onset [ 30 ] .
the present study did not reveal any relation between the mri findings in era and disease activity .
a recent study performed in a 3 - t mr unit by using a dynamic contrast - enhanced t1 - weighted sequence demonstrated a correlation between synovitis and das - 28 .
this study was performed in a small series of patients , and only synovitis was evaluated [ 31 ] .
further studies are needed in larger series of patients to assess the usefulness of 3 - t mri in the detection of hand - wrist lesions in patients with era .
conclusions in conclusion , bone edema , erosions and synovitis are very early mri findings of ra. mri of the hand and wrist on clinical diagnosis of ra is useful to assess the degree of involvement .

we have developed and tested a rationally designed t cell immunogen sequence which overcomes these limitations and which is currently undergoing pre - clinical testing .
methods 250 hiv - 1 clade b infected individuals were screened for t cell responses to the entire hiv proteome .
this yielded 26 regions in hiv - 1 gag , pol , vif and nef proteins that were i ) preferentially targeted by individuals with low viral loads , ii ) more conserved and iii ) elicited responses of higher functional avidity and broader cross - reactivity than responses to other , less - beneficial regions .
the ' beneficial ' segments were linked by triple alanines , translated into an expression - optimized nucleotide sequence and cloned into a cmv plasmid harboring a gm - csf signal peptide .
immunogenicity was evaluated in c57bl / 6 mice two weeks after a second dna vaccination .
cellular immune responses were characterized using intracellular cytokine staining and ifn - gamma elispot using overlapping peptide pools covering the segments included in the t - cell immunogen .
results vaccination with 20 mug of dna generated both cd4 and cd8 ifn - gamma + responses to the immunogen sequence .
the t - cell immunogen elicited a more balanced , broad t cell response to all protein components ( gag , pol , vif and nef ) contained in the immunogen than immunizations using plasmids encoding for the entire gag , pol , nef , tat and vif proteins , which induced a strong gag dominance .
conclusion despite lower in vitro expression , the dna vaccine was strongly immunogenic in c57bl / 6 mice , induced broad cd4 and cd8 t cell responses and was able to break the immunodominance of responses to targets that do not emerge as particularly beneficial in large cohort screenings .
experiments in humanized blt mice are currently ongoing to map induced responses in the context of different hla genotypes .

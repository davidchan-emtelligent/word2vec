inflammation is implicated in triple negative breast cancer ( tnbc ) progression .
tnbc carries a worse prognosis than other breast cancer subtypes , and with the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of tnbc , there is a lack of effective therapeutic targets available .
identification of molecular targets for tnbc subtypes is crucial towards personalized patient stratification .
inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) has been shown to induce p53 mutation accumulation , basal - like gene signature enrichment and transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) via s - nitrosylation .
herein we report that inos is associated with disease recurrence , distant metastasis and decreased breast cancer specific survival in 209 cases of tnbc .
employing tnbc cell lines representing normal basal breast , and basal - like 1 and basal - like 2 tumors , we demonstrate that nitric oxide ( no ) induces egfr - dependent erk phosphorylation in basal - like tnbc cell lines .
moreover no mediated cell migration and cell invasion was found to be dependent on egfr and erk activation particularly in basal - like 2 tbnc cells .
this occurred in conjunction with nf - kappab activation and increased secretion of pro - inflammatory cytokines il - 8 , il - 1beta and tnf - alpha .
this provides substantial evidence for egfr as a therapeutic target to be taken into consideration in the treatment of a specific subset of basal - like tnbc overexpressing inos .
triple negative breast cancer egfr inflammation metastasis nitric oxide introduction triple negative breast cancers ( tnbc ) account for 15 - 20 % of breast cancers and are characterized by a lack of estrogen receptors ( er ) , progesterone receptors ( pr ) or her2 receptors [ 1 , 2 ] .
tnbc patients have limited treatment options , exhibit earlier recurrence and poorer prognosis compared to non - tnbc patients [ 3 ] .
tnbc is in reality a highly diverse group of cancers and despite the efforts of several groups in identification of phenotype / subtype specific expression patterns and gene signature - classification models , controversy remains regarding their subtyping [ 4 , 5 ] .
nevertheless , most of the classifications agree in subdividing them into at least basal - like , mesenchymal , and luminal androgen receptor ( lar ) .
basal - like tumors constitute over 70 % of the tnbc [ 4 ] , and are further subdivided into basal - like 1 ( bl1 ) and basal - like 2 ( bl2 ) .
bl1 tumors are mainly driven by brca and cell cycle / cell division pathways , while the bl2 are mainly driven receptor tyrosine kinases ( rtks ) [ 4 , 6 ] .
improved stratification of this heterogeneous group is crucial to find new therapeutic strategies for tnbc .
nitric oxide ( no ) is a small biomolecule which exerts multiple effects on tumor biology [ 7 , 8 ] .
no regulates a wide range of intracellular events through s - nitrosylation and regulation cell redox [ 9 , 10 ] .
the biological effects of no are dose and temporal dependent with the ability to either inhibit or stimulate cell proliferation , migration and apoptosis [ 7 , 11 , 12 ] .
inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) is a pro - inflammatory enzyme implicated in chronic inflammation and wound healing which synthesizes no [ 13 ] .
we previously demonstrated that inos is associated with poor survival in er - negative breast cancer patients and enhanced expression of basal - like gene signatures [ 14 ] .
additionally we demonstrated that inos was associated with epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) activation [ 14 ] via s - nitrosylation [ 9 ] .
this led us to hypothesize that inos may play a role in the progression of basal - like tnbc via enhanced activation of egfr signaling .
this study aims to identify the degree to which inos pays a role in tnbc progression and patient survival , in addition to identifying whether no related activation of key signaling pathways that mediate cell migration and invasion are dependent on the egfr .
herein , we demonstrate that inos is associated with poor outcome in tnbc patients ( n = 209 ) .
we demonstrate that in bl2 tnbc , no activation of the egfr / erk signaling pathway plays a direct role in the development of a pro - inflammatory phenotype that increases tumor cell invasive capacity .
these results highlight a novel mechanism that may explain the observation that tnbc patients expressing inos display a worse prognosis .
additionally , these results highlight the potential of inos and egfr as targets for consideration in the development of novel treatments for basal - like tnbc .
results inos predicts poor survival in tnbc we previously showed inos is a predictor of poor prognosis in a us cohort of er - negative breast tumors but were unable to assess its role in tnbc [ 14 ] .
here we investigated the association of inos expression with recurrence free survival , metastasis free survival and breast cancer specific survival in 209 tnbc patients diagnosed in ireland from 1999 - 2015 ( table 1 - patient characteristics ) .
tnbc tissue microarrays were stained for inos using immunohistochemistry and tumor epithelial inos expression assessed ( figure 1 ) .
as previously reported inos staining was predominantly observed in the tumor epithelia with few infiltrating immune cells staining positive for inos [ 14 ] .
recurrence free ( local , regional or distant disease ) survival analysis ( figure 2a ) showed that inos positive tumors display decreased recurrence free survival compared to inos negative tumors , with low ( log - rank test : p = 0.067 ) to moderate ( p = 0.010 ) levels of inos expression trending towards a significant association with disease recurrence .
the highest levels of inos showed a trend towards decreased recurrence free survival but did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.156 ) .
metastasis free survival analysis ( figure 2b ) showed that inos positive tumors have an increased chance of distant metastasis compared to inos negative tumors , with low ( log - rank test : p = 0.029 ) to moderate ( p = 0.002 ) levels of inos expression significantly associated with the development of distant metastasis .
similar to disease - free survival , the highest levels of inos showed a trend towards increased metastasis but did not quite reach statistical significance ( p = 0.065 ) .
given that recurrence whether local , regional or distant is suggestive of aggressive progressive disease we then examined whether nos2 predicts increased risk of dying from tnbc .
similarly when examining breast cancer specific survival , figure 2c showed that inos positive tumors are associated with worse breast cancer specific survival compared to inos negative tumors , with low ( log - rank test : p = 0.020 ) to moderate ( p = 0.006 ) levels of inos expression significantly associated with decreased survival .
the highest levels of inos showed a trend towards decreased survival but did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.189 ) .
the lack of association with survival at the highest levels of inos may reflect the generation of no levels that begin to switch from pro - tumorigenic effects to anti - tumorigenic effects as previously reviewed [ 7 ] .
cox regression survival analysis was performed in table 2 to calculate the hazard ratios ( hr ) associated with inos levels and recurrence free survival , metastasis free survival and breast cancer specific free survival .
most notably low levels of inos were associated a breast cancer specific free survival hr of 4.8 ( 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 1.11 - 20.41 ; p = 0.035 ) , while intermediate levels are associated with a hr of 5.9 ( 95 % ci 1.37 - 25.64 ; p = 0.017 ) .
inos remained a significant predictor of outcome in the multivariable analysis after adjustment for age at diagnosis , neoadjuvant therapy , tumor grade and histological subtype , with low levels of inos associated a breast cancer specific free survival hr of 5.0 ( 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 1.16 - 21.94 ; p = 0.031 ) , while intermediate levels are associated with a hr of 7.2 ( 95 % ci 1.60 - 32.34 ; p = 0.010 ) in the multivariable analysis ( table 2 ) .
additionally we found that the percentage of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( tils ) in the tumor adjacent stroma was highest in patients with inos negative tumors ( median % til count = 17.5 %) , and lowest in patients with inos moderate tumors ( median % til count = 10 %) ( table 3 ) .
til counts increased again in patients with inos high tumors ( median % til count = 15 %) .
these results warrant further investigation as the literature suggests that low til counts are associated with worse outcomes in tnbc [ 15 ] .

no activates egfr signaling to investigate the impact of no on basal - like cancer cells , we used three cell lines : mcf - 10a normal immortalized basal breast cells , mda - mb - 468 bl1 tnbc cells and hcc1806 bl2 tnbc cells according to lehmann 's categories [ 4 , 6 ] .
the basal expression levels of total egfr and egfr phosphorylation at y1045 , y1068 and y1173 are shown in supplementary figure 1a , while the basal levels of inos in these cell lines are show in supplementary figure 1b .
we used increasing concentrations of the no donor diethylenetriamine / nitric oxide adduct ( deta / no ) , to assess the effects of no on egfr signaling , a marker of poor prognosis in basal - like tnbc [ 16 , 17 ] .
the levels of deta / no used in this study are equivalent to 0 to 500nm no , which are physiologically relevant as it is estimated that approximately 100nm no is required for the phosphorylation of akt and 400nm for the phosphorylation of p53 in vitro [ 18 , 19 ] .
the effects of deta / no observed in this study are unlikely to be mediated by the no - cgmp axis , as cgmp is activated at levels equivalent to < 0.1mm deta / no [ 18 , 19 ] , and 0.5mm deta / no has been shown to suppress cgmp back to baseline levels [ 20 ] .
although no has been shown to increase the phosphorylation status of egfr residues [ 14 ] , the downstream signaling effects remain unknown .
we combined deta / no with the egfr kinase inhibitor ( pd153035 ) to study the reliance of no on egfr signaling .
phosphorylation on egfr residues y1045 , y1068 and y1173 are recognized as being responsible for controlling egfr signaling [ 21 ] .
figure 3a and the corresponding densitometry analysis in figure 4 demonstrates that 24 hour exposure to deta / no increased egfr phosphorylation in y1173 in mda - mb - 468 and y1045 , y1068 and y1173 in hcc1806 cell lines .
no effect was seen in mcf - 10a .
interestingly the bl2 cell line , hcc1806 cell line , shows a higher induction of egfr phosphorylation compared the bl1 cell line mda - mb - 468 , with the 0.5mm dose of deta / no showing the strongest affect .
the increased phosphorylation was reverted to basal levels when the deta / no treatment is combined with 100nm of pd153035 in the hcc1806 for y1045 , y1068 and y1173 and in mda - mb - 468 for y1173 .
interestingly no treatment also increased the expression of inos mrna which was reversed with the addition of the egfr inhibitor pd153035 indicating a feed forward loop via the egfr ( supplementary figure 1c ) .
figure 3 no induces increased egfr and erk phosphorylation in tnbc cell lines phosphorylation status of egfr ( a ) in the mcf - 10a , mda - mb - 468 and hcc1806 cell lines after 24 hours exposure to increasing doses of deta / no alone or in combination with 100nm of pd153035 ( egfr inhibitor ) .
( b ) phosphorylation status of the map kinases erk1 and erk2 after 24 hours exposure to 0.5mm of deta / no alone or in combination with 100nm of pd153035 or 200nm pd198306 ( mek inhibitor ) .
figure 4 densitometry analysis of egfr phosphorylation in response to deta / no quantification of western blots ( figure 3a ) examining egfr phosphorylation at y1068 , y1173 and y1045 and total egfr expression in the mcf - 10a , mda - mb - 468 and hcc1806 cell lines after 24 hours exposure to increasing doses of deta / no alone or in combination with 100nm of pd153035 ( egfr inhibitor ) .
we next examined the effect of deta / no induced egfr phosphorylation on erk1 / 2 as one of its main downstream effectors .
while 0.5mm of deta / no increased erk1 / 2 activation in all cell lines , it was only statistically significant in hcc1806 as shown by the densitometry analysis in figure 5 .
deta / no induction of erk1 / 2 activation was reverted to below basal levels by the pd153035 only in the hcc1806 showing the specific egfr - dependency of no induction of erk phosphorylation in this cell line ( figure 3b ) .
erk1 / 2 phosphorylation induced by deta / no was abrogated by combining the treatment with 200nm of mek inhibitor pd198306 [ 22 ] .
pd198306 showed significant activity in mda - mb - 468 and hcc1806 , reducing erk1 / 2 phosphorylation status in both basal and deta / no stimulated cells , indicating that no activation of erk is enhanced through mek .
figure 5 densitometry analysis of erk phosphorylation in response to deta / no quantification of western blots ( figure 3b ) examining erk phosphorylation at y204 and total erk expression in the mcf - 10a , mda - mb - 468 and hcc1806 cell lines after 24 hours exposure to increasing doses of deta / no alone or in combination with 100nm of pd153035 ( egfr inhibitor ) or 200nm pd198306 ( mek inhibitor ) .
egfr activation by increased no triggers a pro - inflammatory phenotype no is largely recognized as a pro - inflammatory biomolecule [ 23 ] , and is implicated in the establishment of the pro - inflammatory phenotype [ 24 ] .
to further investigate the interaction between no and egfr in basal - like breast cancer , we first examined the effect of deta / no on cyclooxygenase - 2 ( cox - 2 ) expression , which is implicated in tumor progression and poor outcome in er negative breast cancer [ 25 - 27 ] .
0.5mm deta / no induced cox - 2 expression in the bl2 hcc1806 , which was significantly abrogated by egfr and mek / erk1 / 2 inhibition , confirming the role of egfr in cox2 induction ( figure 6 ) .
deta / no had no significant effect on cox - 2 expression in the normal immortalized mcf - 10a .
cox - 2 was not detectable in the bl1 mda - mb - 468 either at basal line or after deta / no treatment .
interleukin ( il ) - 1beta , il - 6 , il - 8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnfalpha ) are four cytokines involved in inflammation and wound healing [ 28 - 30 ] .
we measured the levels of il - 1beta , il - 6 and il - 8 secretion 1 , 6 and 24 hours post treatment with 0.5mm deta / no alone or in combination with 100nm pd153035 .
figure 7 shows there is no consistent secretion pattern applicable for the three different cytokines .
no effect of deta / no treatment on il - 6 expression was found in any cell lines ( figure 7a ) .
figure 7b shows il - 1beta secretion was significantly increased in hcc1806 24 hours post exposure to deta / no , and could be partially reversed with the egfr inhibitor .
deta / no increase il - 1beta secretion from mcf - 10a or mda - mb - 468 .
figure 7c demonstrates no stimulatory effect of deta / no on mcf - 10a secretion of il - 8 ; while both mda - mb - 468 and the hcc1806 , show increased il - 8 secretion 24 hours post deta / no exposure compared to vehicle .
figure 6 induction of cox - 2 by no in hcc1806 is suppressed by egfr or mek inhibitiors cox - 2 protein levels in mcf - 10a , mda - mb - 468 and hcc1806 after 24 hours exposure to 0.5mm of deta / no alone or in combination with 100nm of pd153035 or 200nm pd198306 .
figure 7 no induction of il - 1beta and il - 8 secretion is perturbed by egfr inhibition in hcc1806 cytokine profiling of released il - 6 ( a ) il - 1beta ( b ) and il - 8 ( c ) in mcf - 10a , mda - mb - 468 and hcc1806 after 24 hours exposure to vehicle or 0.5mm of deta / no alone or in combination with 100nm of pd153035 .
* p < 0.05 vs vehicle ; # p < 0.05 vs deta / no plus pd153035 tnfalpha plays a central role in inflammation in cancer .
figure 8a demonstrates that tnfalpha secretion is significantly increased by 0.5 mm deta / no compared to vehicle after 24 hours in both bl1 mda - mb - 468 and bl2 hcc1806 cells , but not in mcf - 10a .
the magnitude of tnfalpha induction in the hcc1806 was greater than the mda - mb - 468 .
co - treatment with the egfr inhibitor , significantly decreased tnfalpha release to basal levels in hcc1806 but not mda - mb - 468 .
this finding suggests a link between egfr activation and the induction of a pro - inflammatory phenotype in the bl2 hcc1806 .
nuclear factor - kappa b ( nf - kappab ) meditates tnfalpha signaling .
when tnfalpha binds to its cell surface receptor , it triggers intracellular signaling resulting in the translocation of nf - kappab to the nucleus and the activation of nf - kappab dependent gene expression [ 31 ] .
we used a nf - kappab luciferase reporter to study the effect of no levels on nf - kappab gene promoter dependent activity ( figure 8b ) .
we show increased nf - kappab activity after deta / no exposure in the bl2 hcc1806 cell line , while we could see no significant effect in neither the mcf - 10a nor the bl1 mda - mb - 468 cells , which reflects the higher levels of tnf alpha induced by deta / no in figure 8a .
to confirm a direct tnfalpha mediated effect , we used the tnfalpha blocking antibody infliximab to investigate the effect of the no induced tnfalpha on nf - kappab activity .
our findings indicate a significant decrease in nf - kappab induced activity in the hcc1806 when we combined infliximab with deta / no. together , these findings suggest a direct role for no , triggering a pro - inflammatory phenotype in the bl2 cells , mediated by egfr and nf - kappab activation .
figure 8 no induces increased tnfalpha secretion and activation of nf - kappab in hcc1806 tnfalpha released ( a ) in the three cell lines after 24 hours exposure to vehicle or 0.5mm of deta / no alone or in combination with 100nm of pd153035 .
( b ) luciferase activity of nf - kappab reporter after 24 hours exposure to vehicle or 0.5mm of deta / no alone or in combination with 50mug / ml of infliximab ( tnfalpha blocking antibody ) , 10ng / ml of recombinant tnfalpha were used as a positive control .
* p < 0.05 vs vehicle ; # p < 0.05 vs deta / no plus pd153035 .
no regulates migration and invasion capability inflammation is a major driving force in cancer metastasis [ 32 , 33 ] .
il - 8 is a pro - inflammatory cytokine which induces matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp9 ) expression and cleavage in different biological systems [ 34 , 35 ] .
to determine if the induction of il - 8 secretion in mda - mb - 468 and hcc1806 by deta / no as seen in figure 7c , reflects the invasive potential of the tnbc cell lines we examined the effects of deta / no on mmp expression , and migration and invasion potential .
0.5mm deta / no increased levels of mmp1 and mmp9 , but not mmp2 mrna in all three cells lines ( figure 9a ) .
to confirm that changes in gene expression translated to its biological activity we assessed deta / nos effect on mmp2 and mmp9 activity by gelatin zymography ( figure 9b ) .
surprisingly , the mcf - 10a exhibited higher basal mmp activity than the cancer cell lines , with no significant effect of 0.5mm deta / no treatment on gelatinase activity .
hcc1806 showed increased mmp9 activity after 24 hours exposure to deta / no , which was partially reversed in combination with the egfr antagonist .
deta / no had no significant effect on gelatinase activity in the mda - mb - 468 .
figure 9 no induces increased mmp expression and activity ( a ) qpcr showing the mrna expression levels of mmp1 , mmp2 and mmp9 after 24 hours exposure to vehicle or 0.5mm of deta / no alone or in combination with 100nm of pd153035 .
( b ) zymography showing the gelatinase activity of mmp9 and mmp2 after 24 hours exposure to vehicle or 0.5mm of deta / no alone or in combination with 100nm of pd153035 .
tumor cells undergo migration and invasion during metastasis [ 36 ] .
these mechanisms are considered identical to those exerted by non - neoplastic cells in physiological processes such as wound healing [ 37 ] .
we examined the effect of 0.5mm deta / no on cellular migration and invasion capacity across a fbs gradient ( 5 to 10 %) through 8mum trans - wells either uncoated ( migration ) or coated ( invasion ) ( figure 10 and figure 11 ( representative images )) .
0.5mm deta / no significantly decreased the migration potential of normal mcf - 10as , and conversely increased migration in both basal - like tnbc cell lines , with a greater increase seen in bl2 hcc1806 compared to bl1 mda - mb - 468 .
deta / no mediated migration was dependent on the egfr / erk activation , as either egfr ( pd153035 ) or mek ( pd198306 ) inhibition reverted migration levels to baseline .
similar patterns were observed for invasive capacity ( figure 9a ) .
deta / no also increased the rate of hcc1806 invasion through gelatin ( figure 9b ) , and collagen coated surfaces ( figure 9c ) confirming the effect observed on mmp - 9 activity by zymography , and also indicating that deta / no may increase mmp1 enzymatic activity in addition to mrna levels .
in contrast , the mda - mb - 468 cells do not show any difference in the invasive capability after deta / no exposure , and the mcf - 10a show a reduced invasive capacity similar to their migration capacity .
neither the egfr nor the mek inhibitors had any significant effect on mcf - 10a or mda - mb - 468 invasive potential .
these results reiterate , the dependency of bl2 tnbc cells on growth factor signaling , making them more sensitive to no - related effects .
these findings support the idea that high no levels , produced by increased inos expression , trigger a loop where egfr - erk and nf - kappab are the main effectors , and implicate inos in tnbc progression .

discussion finding new targets for the treatment of tnbc is of major clinical importance .
tnbcs have a high risk of local and distant recurrence , particularly in the first three years post diagnosis .
tnbcs account for 15 - 20 % of all breast cancers and are associated with an earlier onset , brca1 mutations and patients of african descent [ 38 ] .
current treatment strategies involve surgical intervention coupled with standard chemotherapy ( anthracyclines , taxanes , cyclophosphamide ) , in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting .
recent clinical trials have focused around platinum agents and parp inhibitors ( particularly in brca1 associated tnbc ) , androgen receptor antagonists ( lar tnbc ) and immune checkpoint inhibitors ( tnbcs with high levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ) [ 38 ] .
we previously showed that inos is a predictor of poor survival in er - negative breast cancer ( n = 98 ) , but not in er - positive breast cancer in a cohort of us patients [ 14 ] .
we further demonstrated that inos was associated with egfr phosphorylation , basal - like transcription patterns , and predicted poor outcome in patients with basal - like breast cancer ( n = 41 ) [ 14 ] .
subsequently , we showed that no autophosphorylates the egfr via s - nitrosylation [ 9 ] .
in 2015 granados - principal et al demonstrated an association between high levels of inos and decreased relapse free survival in 83 cases of tnbc [ 39 ] .
moreover in 2014 , heinecke et al demonstrated that tnbc tumor proliferation and metastases to the brain were significantly suppressed by inos inhibition in nude mice [ 23 ] , recapitulated by granados - principal et al [ 39 ] .
herein we demonstrate in an irish cohort of 209 tnbc patients that inos predicts decreased overall survival , which includes patients with basal - like tnbc ( n = 136 ) , corroborating our previous findings and validating inos as a predictor of poor outcome in patients from different geographic regions ( usa and ireland ). with lehmann et al 's identification of six tnbc molecular subtypes ( bl1 , bl2 , immunomodulatory , mesenchymal , mesenchymal stem like and lar ) based on gene expression profiles [ 4 ] , and their further refinement into four tnbc molecular subtypes ( bl1 , bl2 , mesenchymal , and lar ) [ 6 ] , it becomes apparent that there are two different basal - like tumor biology 's at play .
within the basal - like tumors , bl2 tnbc are characterized by a greater dependency on growth factor signaling including the egfr , as opposed to bl1 where the tumors are mainly driven by cell cycle genes and brca mutations [ 4 ] .
given this further subdivision of the basal - like phenotype we examined whether increased levels of no influence basal - like breast cancer cells , and regulate their pro - inflammatory and metastatic capacities in the context of bl1 and bl2 phenotypes .
while both cell lines representing the bl1 and bl2 subtypes , displayed increased egfr phosphorylation in response to deta / no not only in the previously reported y1045 and y1173 residues [ 14 ] , but also in y1068 , the effect was greater on the bl2 cell line hcc1806 .
it should be noted that the induction of y1045 was modest at best which may reflect our previous observation that y1045 was phosphorylated within 10 mins exposure to deta / no [ 14 ] , and therefore there may be some degree of a negative feedback loop at 24 hours post incubation .
the activation of the y1068 by deta / no directly links no mediated egfr activation with erk / mapk activation [ 21 ] , which we demonstrated was abrogated by the inclusion of the mek / erk inhibitor pd198306 [ 40 ] .
this induction of erk activation was dependent on the egfr in the bl2 hcc1806 but not the bl1 mda - mb - 468 as demonstrated by the effects of egfr inhibition on erk phosphorylation after deta / no exposure , supporting the reported dependency of the bl2 subtype on growth factor receptor signaling [ 4 ] .
it should be noted however that the mek inhibitor did repress erk phosphorylation below base line ( to approx. 50 % of baseline ) in the hcc1806 , and while deta / no did increase erk phosphorylation in the presence of the mek inhibitor , it was unable to fully return erk phosphorylation back to baseline levels .
high levels of erk expression have previously been shown to be associated with poor outcome in tnbc [ 41 ] .
contributing factors in this association may include erk induction of il - 8 leading to increased migration and invasion and anchorage independent growth [ 42 ] .
indeed erk inhibition in tnbc cells inhibits epithelial to mesenchymal transition , targets stem cell proliferation inhibits tnbc xenograft lung metastasis development in nude mouse models [ 43 ] .
furthermore , we show that the activation of the egfr / erk / mapk pathway has a critical role in the development of a pro - inflammatory phenotype induced by deta / no. cox - 2 has been reported to be overexpressed in breast cancer compared to normal breast tissue [ 44 , 45 ] .
its main metabolite , prostaglandin e2 ( pge2 ) has been shown to promote migration , invasion , proliferation and angiogenesis while inhibiting apoptosis [ 46 , 47 ] .
in this regard , we show that the activation of egfr and erk , by deta / no drives cox - 2 overexpression in the bl2 hcc1806 .
however , it had no effect in the bl1 mda - mb - 468 where we could n't detect any basal or induced expression of cox - 2 .
we had previously shown inos was associated with elevated tumor expression of il - 8 in er - negative breast cancer and was inducible by deta / no in tnbc cell lines [ 14 ] , and that inos inhibition decreased tnbc tumor xenograft il - 6 and il - 8 mrna expression [ 23 ] .
conversely we did n't see any significant influence of deta / no treatment on il - 6 secretion in any of the cell lines tested .
potentially , the induction of il - 6 by no , maybe dependent on other factors present in the tumor microenvironment but absent in an in vitro setting .
we did however find that deta / no induced il - 8 secretion in both basal - like cell lines and similar to erk phosphorylation , il - 8 induction in the bl2 hcc1806 was dependent on egfr signaling .
both il - 1beta and tnfalpha are present in the tumor microenvironment .
while in acute doses they can have cytotoxic effects [ 48 ] , when present chronically , they have a strong pro - tumoral effect [ 49 - 51 ] .
while increased no levels did n't effect il - 1beta or tnfalpha in mcf - 10a or mda - mb - 468 cells , in the bl2 hcc1806 , the activation of the egfr pathway by no significantly increased il - 1beta and tnfalpha release , accompanied by tnfalpha dependent nf - kappab activation .
nf - kappab regulates the expression of genes involved in key cellular processes such as adhesion , cell cycle , or apoptosis [ 52 , 53 ] .
these results highlights the cross - talk between egfr signaling and inflammation processes that are critical in tumor metastasis in bl2 tnbc .
the pro - inflammatory cytokine il - 8 has been previously shown to induce increased cancer stem cell renewal , cell invasion and metastasis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition [ 14 , 54 ] , and we now show a novel mechanism that that links high no levels to egfr - dependent il - 8 induction in bl2 cells .
as mentioned above , erk activation is associated with increased migration and invasion [ 42 ] .
expression levels and activity of the mmps are finely regulated during the tumor metastasis .
we report deta / no increased expression of mmp1 and mmp9 mrna and increased mmp9 enzymatic activity in the bl2 hcc1806 , in an egfr - dependent manner .
cell migration and invasion were regulated by no through the egfr / mapk pathway , with no significantly increasing cell migration in both tnbc cells , and in contrast inhibiting migration and invasion of normal mcf - 10as .
as we ca n't fully explain why the mcf - 10a show reduced migration in the absence of a negative effect on mmp or il - 8 activity , further studies are needed to understand the biphasic effects of no in tumoral versus non - tumoral breast cells .
additionally mcf - 10a have their limitations as a normal control cell line , due to their immortalized status , however we believe that they are the best available control basal cell line , as primary mammary epithelial cells are er positive .
indeed the mcf - 10a exhibit higher rates of cell migration than either tnbc cell line , which reflects previous reports that they have greater colony formation potential than mda - mb - 468 or hcc1806 [ 55 ] .
similarly invasion through gelatin ( mmp9 substrate ) or collagen ( mmp1 substrate ) matrices was enhanced by deta / no , in bl2 but not in bl1 cells , reflecting results observed regarding mmps expression and activity .
however it should be noted that additional and / or more relevant mediators such as upa / pai - 1 [ 56 ] or cathepsins [ 56 , 57 ] , may play a key role in the observed effects .
these effects were totally or at least partially reverted when we combined the no donor with the egfr or mapk inhibitors highlighting the importance of the egfr / mapk pathway regulating tumor progression in a pro - inflammatory environment .
to summarize , we examined the effect of high levels of no in three different triple negative , basal like cell lines .
our data indicates that inos is a predictor of poor outcome in tnbc patients and particularly in basal - like patients .
in deciphering the potential mechanism of action , we used the mcf - 10a as a non - tumorigenic control cell line , and the mda - mb - 468 and the hcc1806 as representative examples of the bl1 and bl2 subtypes , and found the effects of deta / no to be more pronounced on the bl2 cell line .
lehman et al found that , while not statistically significant , patients with bl2 had a worse outcome than bl1 patients .
we find that , in response to high levels of no , the bl2 cell line ( hcc1806 ) shows induction of pro - inflammatory signaling , nf - kappab dependent gene - expression , increased migration and invasion which is dependent on egfr signaling , an intrinsic feature of the bl2 subtype .
in this way , high inos expression in the tumor samples may contribute to the poor outcome observed in basal - like breast cancer patients by enhanced pro - tumorigenic signaling in the bl2 subtype .
despite egfr being highly expressed in a large proportion of tnbc patients , the employment of engineered monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) against egfr is not approved for the treatment of breast cancer , while it is approved for other types of cancer such as colorectal cancer .
in recent years , many research groups have pointed to the necessity of reconsidering this approach in tnbc , given the lack of an effective treatment [ 58 - 60 ] .
as a consequence , two phase ii clinical trials were developed , reporting non - statistically significant differences when combining conventional chemotherapeutic agents with egfr inhibitor [ 61 , 62 ] .
however , no patient selection criteria were included in these trials , and considering the heterogeneity of the tnbc subtype this could be something to take into consideration delving in the need of stratifying tnbcs for future trials [ 63 ] .
in this work , we aimed to shed light on the stratification of the tnbc .
we provide substantial clinical and in vitro data showing that basal - like tnbc with high levels of expression of inos may be candidates for egfr targeted therapeutics .

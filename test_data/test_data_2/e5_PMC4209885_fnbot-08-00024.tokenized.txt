in the framework of rehabilitation robotics , a major role is played by the human - machine interface ( hmi ) used to gather the patient 's intent from biological signals , and convert them into control signals for the robotic artifact .
surprisingly , decades of research have not yet declared what the optimal hmi is in this context ; in particular , the traditional approach based upon surface electromyography ( semg ) still yields unreliable results due to the inherent variability of the signal .
to overcome this problem , the scientific community has recently been advocating the discovery , analysis , and usage of novel hmis to supersede or augment semg ; a comparative analysis of such hmis is therefore a very desirable investigation .
in this paper , we compare three such hmis employed in the detection of finger forces , namely semg , ultrasound imaging , and pressure sensing .
the comparison is performed along four main lines : the accuracy in the prediction , the stability over time , the wearability , and the cost .
a psychophysical experiment involving ten intact subjects engaged in a simple finger - flexion task was set up. our results show that , at least in this experiment , pressure sensing and semg yield comparably good prediction accuracies as opposed to ultrasound imaging ; and that pressure sensing enjoys a much better stability than semg .
given that pressure sensors are as wearable as semg electrodes but way cheaper , we claim that this hmi could represent a valid alternative / augmentation to semg to control a multi - fingered hand prosthesis .
pressure sensing machine learning incremental learning human - machine interaction rehabilitation robotics force control 1 introduction despite decades of research by roboticists , mathematicians , and physiatrists , properly controlling a hand prosthesis by a hand amputee is , still nowadays , an open problem .
in the ideal case , proper control means that each single degree of freedom ( dof ) of the prosthesis should be independently and proportionally controllable according to the amputee 's intent ; for instance , the desire to grab a bottle should immediately result in a stable cylindrical power grasp .
so far , this is only enforced on single - dof grippers such as , e.g. , otto bock 's sensorhand speed1 using two surface electromyography ( semg ) electrodes ( merletti et al. , 2009 , 2011a,b ) placed on the loci of maximal residual muscle activity found on the stump .
although this form of control is reliable , it cannot go very much past such non - dexterous prostheses , e.g. , proportional control of two dofs at best , with switching between dofs enforced by sequences of cocontractions .
on the other hand , with the recent advent of multi - fingered hand prostheses as well as active prosthetic wrists and elbows , the need for more dexterous control has become urgent .
commercially available devices ( certified as prostheses and employed in the clinics ) include , e.g. , touch bionics 's i - limb ultra revolution , rsl steeper 's bebionic , and vincent systems 's vincent evolution 22 , each one equipped with four to six motors and single - finger dofs ; in some cases , the prosthesis can even independently rotate and flex the thumb .
academic prototypes are going in the same direction , e.g. , prensilia 's azzurra hand , derived from the smarthand ( cipriani et al. , 2011 ) , gifted with five independent motors and tendon - actuated fingers , and the softhand ( catalano et al. , 2012 ) , exploiting the concept of motor synergies ( santello et al. , 1998 ) to dramatically simplify the control without reducing the functionality .
for these mechatronic artifacts , amsuss et al .
( 2014 ) have shown that the old one - dof control schema does not suffice any longer ; more sophisticated forms of semg - based control , relying on pattern matching , do not yet work as desired .
matching semg patterns via classification is clumsy , unstable , and limiting for the patient , to the point that ( micera et al. , 2010 ; peerdeman et al. , 2011 ) a large percentage of hand amputees do not routinely use such costly devices .
the community is therefore calling for novel human - machine interfaces ( hmis ) to complement , augment , or substitute semg , together with the necessity to enforce simultaneous and proportional control using these signals ( fougner et al. , 2012 ; jiang et al. , 2012 ) .
to this aim , novel hmis are currently being explored ( castellini et al. , 2014 ) for control of multi - fingered hand prostheses , but so far little is known about their comparative advantages and disadvantages .
in this paper , we propose one such analysis focusing on two such hmis recently appeared in the scientific literature , namely ultrasound imaging ( sierra gonzalez and castellini , 2013 ) and pressure sensing ( wininger et al. , 2008 ; yungher et al. , 2011 ) , in comparison to semg .
we analyzed their performance under four aspects : the accuracy in the prediction of the activation of the dofs of the prosthesis ; the stability of the prediction over time ; the wearability ; and the projected costs .
a psychophysical experiment was set up in which ten able - bodied subjects would repeatedly flex their fingers to different extents of maximal voluntary contraction , while their semg signals , pressure signature of the forearm , and ultrasound images of the forearm were recorded .
the experimental results seem then to indicate that pressure sensing represents a viable alternative to semg , at least as far as single - finger - force control of a hand prosthesis is concerned .
1.1 related work the three hmis chosen for this study have already been individually investigated for hand prosthetic control .
namely , semg is a very long - standing choice , its use dating back to the 60s for one - dof control ( finley and wirta , 1967 ) .
several comprehensive surveys about its use in modern , multi - dof hand prostheses have appeared ( e.g. , micera et al. , 2010 ; peerdeman et al. , 2011 ) , showing that basically all possible electrode arrangements and machine - learning methods have been tried to enable fine control over self - powered prosthetic hands ; nevertheless , it turns out that semg has a number of drawbacks , which still make it unsuitable .
the main problem lies in its changing nature due to sweat , electrode shift , and fatigue ( merletti et al. , 2011a ) , the latter being especially hard to counter since it entails shifts in the frequency components of the signals as well as in its amplitude .
the problem is all the more relevant whenever standard commercial electrodes , such as , e.g. , otto bock 's myobock 13e2003 are used , which are the de facto standard in clinical applications .
these electrodes provide a rectified , low - pass filtered version of the raw semg signal , with no original frequency content remaining .
attempts to counter fatigue include , e.g. , the usage of switching regimes as the signal changes ( artemiadis and kyriakopoulos , 2011 ) or static methods , i.e. , filtering ( dimitrova and dimitrov , 2003 ) .
the limited success of these methods mean that the level of abandonment of hand prostheses remains unusually high ( biddiss and chau , 2007 ; peerdeman et al. , 2011 ) .
the idea of using ultrasound imaging is , as well , not new .
zheng et al .
( 2006 ) originally used it to track the thickness of the extensor muscle in the forearm to drive a one - dof prosthetic wrist ; the approach was then extended in chen et al .
( 2010 , 2011 ) and shi et al .
( 2010 ) to multiple dofs and to a better accuracy .
castellini et al .
( 2012 ) and sierra gonzalez and castellini ( 2013 ) demonstrated its feasibility to predict finger forces and positions in a realistic setting , i.e. , using no sensors for ground truth and training on maximal and minimal forces only .
an attempt at comparing semg and ultrasound imaging in a discrete tracking task appears in jing - yi et al .
( 2011 ) , from which it seems that ultrasound imaging obtains better results than semg .
in castellini ( 2014 ) , it is speculated that , given the wealth of information obtained from ultrasound images , this technique might be superior to semg .
as far as pressure sensing is concerned , the main idea is that of detecting the intent of a subject by estimating the deformation induced on the forearm / stump surface by the underlying muscle activity - the so - called " pressure signature " of the muscle activation .
this path was initially explored in the 2000s by craelius and wininger ( craelius , 2002 ; phillips and craelius , 2005 ; wininger et al. , 2008 ) who showed that an array of variable resistors could be used to determine the forces required during walking and / or while grasping a dynamometer .
comparison between semg and this technique showed that these novel signals enjoy less variability in time and provide more repeatable patterns .
this is not surprising , since muscular fatigue should not affect such signals .
in castellini and ravindra ( 2014 ) , the effectiveness of such an approach was further demonstrated by showing that a simple bracelet containing 10 force - sensing resistors ( fsrs ) , similar to those used by craelius and wininger , can be used to detect finger forces to a degree of accuracy comparable to that found in literature for semg .
in the following , we will denote the three above - described hmis as , in turn , semg ( surface electromyography ) , us ( ultrasound imaging ) , and fsr ( the acronym of force - sensing resistors , the devices used to gather the pressure signature of the forearm ) .
2 materials and methods a psychophysical experiment involving ten able - bodied subjects was set up , in order to determine the pros and cons of the three hmis mentioned above .
we gathered fingertip forces from the subjects , while they were induced to apply force patterns using a visual stimulus .
at the same time , their semg signals , fsr signals , and us images of the forearm were recorded .
2.1 experimental setup 2.1.1 forearm pressure signature the pressure sensing setup comprised a semi - rigid bracelet with ten force - sensing resistors ( fsr400 short by interlink electronics4 affixed along the inner surface of the bracelet , as shown in figure 1a ) .
the sensors have a 5.6 mm - diameter pressure sensitive surface , whose resistance changes in a predictable manner when a force is applied on it. the behavior of the sensor is typically non - linear , with no guarantee of repeatability across sensors , which accounts for their inexpensiveness - a single unit costs in germany < 5 eur .
each force sensor was placed on an aluminum plate of 3 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm dimension and immobilized by means of a double sided tape .
a spherical rubber foot was placed on the sensing surface and the whole arrangement was encased in a heat shrink rubber tubing so as to keep the parts in place .
a detailed description of the bracelet as well as of its calibration can be found in castellini and ravindra ( 2014 ) .
figure 1 hmi devices used : ( a ) customized arrangement of fsr housed in a semi - rigid bracelet ; ( b ) ten semg electrodes arranged on a strip of bio - compatible self - adhesive tape ; ( c ) ultrasound transducer fixed to a custom - made cradle .
2.1.2 surface electromyography ten ottobock myobock 13e200 semg electrodes were attached to a bio - compatible reusable self - adhesive tape at regular intervals - see figure 1b .
these electrodes are the standard , off - the - shelf semg device used in clinical prosthetic sockets , and are commercially available ; they provide an amplified , bandpass filtered , rectified semg signal , of excellent quality for prosthetic control .
the electrode band was placed around the forearm , about 5 cm below the elbow ; no muscle targeting was enforced in order to keep the electrode positioning as simple as possible .
this choice has already been proved effective for hand prosthetic control ( castellini et al. , 2009 ; castellini and van der smagt , 2013 ) .
each such electrode can be bought at a price between 150 and 300 eur in europe .
2.1.3 ultrasound imaging ultrasound images of the forearm were gathered using a general electric logiq - e portable ultrasound machine5 equipped with a 12l - rs linear transducer .
movement of the probe with respect to the subject 's skin was avoided using a custom - built plastic cradle obtained via rapid prototyping - see figure 1c .
the machine was configured to an ultrasound frequency of 12 hz , edge enhancement on , focus point at a depth of 1.3 cm and minimum depth of field , resulting in a frame rate of 38 hz. for a deeper description of this setup , please refer to sierra gonzalez and castellini ( 2013 ) .
2.1.4 finger - force sensor the finger - force linear sensor ( ffls , see koiva et al. , 2012 ) was used to gather the applied finger forces .
the ffls is a customized arrangement of six strain gage sensors , ergonomically designed to fit the positions of fingers while the palm is stretched .
it employs four kd60 - 100n industrial strain gage sensors by me - mebetasysteme gmbh6 to measure finger flexion and extension forces of the index , ring , middle , and little fingers , and one rfs ( r ) 150xy - 100 - 8 - 3 dual axis strain gage sensor by honigmann gmbh7 to measure the flexion / extension and abduction / adduction forces of the thumb .
the sensors have < 0.1 % linearity error and 0.1 % drift over 30 min .
the ffls guarantees therefore a repeatable linear behavior in a high range of force ( 100 n in all directions ) and reaches an overall accuracy of + 0.35 % over nominal measurement range .
2.2 experiment description an experiment was designed to compare the accuracy and stability of the finger - force prediction obtained by a state - of - the - art machine - learning method using the three kinds of signals provided by each hmi .
in an initial round of data collection , we measured the maximal forces that each subject could apply at each of the 6 dofs considered ( namely flexion of the little , ring , middle , and index finger plus thumb adduction and flexion ) .
the choice of these six dofs of the human hand is motivated by the fact that one of the most dexterous self - powered hand prostheses in the world at the time of the experiment , namely the i - limb ultra revolution , has exactly those active six dof available ; and it is reflected in the configuration of the ffls , which can measure the forces applied for each of these dofs .
in the ideal case , data should have been collected with all three devices strapped to the forearm at the same time .
however , such an arrangement would have seriously hampered the comfort of the subjects .
we rather did a pairwise comparison of the fsr with semg and us. this pairwise comparison was done by dividing the data collection into two phases .
in the first phase , the semg band and the fsr bracelet were affixed to the right forearm of the subject ( figure 2a ) ; whereas in the second phase , the semg band was replaced by the ultrasound probe ( figure 2b ) .
the ground truth was collected by strapping the fingertips on the sensors of the ffls .
figure 2 experimental setup comprising hmis on the forearm and the finger tips on the ffls .
( a ) fsr bracelet and semg band ; ( b ) fsr bracelet and us transducer applied to the forearm .
in both phases , the same visual stimuli were administered to the subjects : a 3d hand model of a human hand , flexing the fingers , plus a colored bar denoting the required level of force .
a further set of colored bars denoting the force actually applied by the subjects helped ensure that the subjects would exert the required amounts of force to their best .
the two phases were identical in terms of the actions that were required by the subject .
each phase comprised ten repetitions , each repetition consisting of a single - finger flexion for each dof .
during repetitions 1 - 5 , the subjects were required to flex their fingers at 80 % maximum force level ; the subject was then given a break of 5 min , followed by repetitions 6 - 10 , at 15 % of maximum force .
this split provided an indication of how the prediction accuracy would behave in a high - force as well as in a low - force scenario .
ten able - bodied subjects volunteered for the experiment .
the entire experimental procedure was conveyed to them in oral and written form , following which their consent was taken in writing .
the experiment was approved by the ethical committee of dlr .
the subjects were seated comfortably on an adjustable office chair for the entire duration .
they were given the option to pause or stop the experiment at any point of time .
2.3 data processing and force prediction data obtained from the semg , fsr , and ffls were collected at 50 hz using a standard analogic - to - digital conversion card .
the semg signals were filtered by a 1st order low - pass butterworth filter with cutoff frequency at 1 hz. a gradual drift was observed in the fsr signals , which was remedied by applying a 3rd order high - pass butterworth filter with cutoff frequency at 0.5 hz. the filtered signals obtained from the semg electrodes and fsrs were directly used , without any further feature extraction phase .
the us images were grabbed from the vga output ( at 38 hz ) of the us machine using a standard pci - bus frame grabber ; from each image , 543 local visual features were extracted , denoting the changes in the local levels of gray of each image .
for a thorough description of the feature extraction procedure , please refer to sierra gonzalez and castellini ( 2013 ) .
following the approach tested in the same paper , we applied ridge regression to the visual features in order to predict the finger forces .
ridge regression ( hoerl and kennard , 1970 ) is a regularized variant of least - squares regression , building a linear model of the forces of the form f ( x ) = wtx , where x denotes the visual features extracted from each image , and w is a weighting vector , which can be calculated in closed form from a set of ( sample , target ) pairs ( the training set ) previously collected .
in particular , if x denotes the training set ( as an n x 543 matrix , where n is the number of samples in the training set ) , and y is a vector collecting the n target ( force ) values for each collected sample , then w = ( xtx + lambdai ) - 1xty .
( the regularization coefficient lambda was set at the standard value of 1. ) for semg and fsr data , a linear approach is not sufficient ( castellini and ravindra , 2014 ; gijsberts et al. , 2014 ) , therefore we employed a non - linear extension to ridge regression called random fourier features ( rahimi and recht , 2008 ) .
the models obtained by this approach have the form f ( x ) = wtphi ( x ) , where phi is a non - linear mapping from the input space ( the semg or fsr values ) to a higher - ( but finite - ) dimensional feature space , where linear regression is more likely to succeed .
the mapping phi is actually a finite approximation of the well - known radial - basis - function kernel ; but , as opposed to what happens , e.g. , with support vector machines ( boser et al. , 1992 ) , where the kernel is known but the mapping is not , leading to an infinite - dimensional feature space , in this case phi can be explicitly ( and computationally lightly ) evaluated .
the finiteness of the induced kernel keeps the approach bounded in space and permits the mapping to simply be " plugged in " into the ridge regression formula : w = ( phi ( x ) tphi ( x ) + lambdai ) - 1phi ( x ) ty. more details about the theory of this method when applied to semg can be found in gijsberts et al .
( 2014 ) .
the prediction accuracy of each machine - learning method ( ridge regression and random fourier features in turn ) was evaluated by following the realistic scenario first described in sierra gonzalez and castellini ( 2013 ) : to build a training set , only data collected during the application of maximal and minimal forces were considered ; fivefold cross - validation was done for each subject , by training on four out of five repetitions and testing on the remaining repetition .
in the case of random fourier features , the hyperparameter sigma was found by grid - search while the number of features to be evaluated , d , was set at the computationally feasible value of 300 .
training sets were built , in turn , using either the ffls force data ( the " ideal " ground truth ) and the stimulus values - a harder but more realistic choice , since amputees cannot provide any consistent ground truth using sensors .
the prediction accuracy of each machine - learning method applied to either regression problem ( with forces or stimulus as ground truth ) was evaluated by calculating the root mean - squared - error between the predicted force values and the ground truth obtained from the ffls sensor , normalized over the target signal range ( nrmse ) .
notice that this problem represents a hard challenge for any machine - learning method whatsoever : in the most difficult setting , the system is trained on stimulus values but still tested on real force data .
lastly , two prediction scenarios were considered , one to ascertain the accuracy obtained by each hmi in general , and another one to test the stability over time of each hmi .
for the first scenario , the above cross - validation procedure was used ; for the second , we trained on data collected during the first repetition , and subsequently tested on the second , third , fourth , and fifth repetition separately .
as the repetitions were always collected in the same chronological order , this would give us an indication of how well the prediction could carry on over time .
3 results 3.1 prediction accuracy figures 3 and 4 show the prediction accuracy obtained by each hmi on each degree of freedom considered ( little , ring , middle , and index finger flexion , thumb adduction , and thumb rotation ) , in the high - and low - forces experiment , in turn , both when the ffls ( force ) data are used as ground truth ( figures 3a and 4a ) and when the stimulus values are used to this purpose ( figures 3b and 4b ) .

bars and stems denote average nrmse values across ten subjects , plus / minus one standard error of the mean .

( a ) error obtained when the ffls data are used as ground truth ; ( b ) error obtained when the stimulus is used as ground truth .
the legend denotes , in turn , semg ( emg ) , the two fsr sessions ( fsr1 , fsr2 ) and ultrasound imaging ( us ) .
bars and stems denote average nrmse values across ten subjects , plus / minus one standard error of the mean .
in the graphs , fsr1 and fsr2 denote the two identical experiments performed with fsr , the first time together with semg and the second with us. almost no statistically significant difference in performance is observed ( student 's two - tailed t - test p - value always larger than 0.05 , except for one single case ) .
this confirms that the error values for the fsr obtained in the two experiments are similar , in turn , confirming that the subjects were induced to do approximately the same things during the two experiments .
the maximum force exerted averaged over ten subjects and the six degrees of freedom is 22.6 +/ - 2.1 n. as far as the prediction accuracy is concerned , in the high - forces case , when the actual forces ( ffls data ) are used as ground truth to train the system ( figure 3a ) , the error attained by semg and fsr is almost uniformly below 10 % , with very few statistically significant differences .
ultrasound imaging obtains a rather higher error , in the range 15 - 20 % , always statistically significant .
in case the stimulus values are used as ground truth for training ( figure 3b ) , the situation gets uniformly worse as expected , but the same pattern can be observed : semg and fsr obtain errors in the range 10 - 20 % ( around 20 % in the case of thumb adduction ) , which corresponds to a maximum error of approximately 4.3 n , while ultrasound imaging performs overall much worse , with errors hovering around 40 % , which is approximately 7.2 n. again , its performance is always statistically significantly different in comparison to the worse among the other approaches .
in the low - forces experiment ( figure 4 ) , the same considerations hold , given the fact that the error becomes uniformly higher .
this is to be expected , since the range of forces in this case is significantly smaller than in the high - forces case .
it should be noted that though the nrmse values obtained with semg and fsr is high for some dofs ( 20 - 35 % for middle , index , and thumb adduction / rotation ) , the minuteness of the 15 % force level means that the error in terms of physical force is approximately 1.2 n .
3.2 stability figures 5 and 6 show the prediction errors obtained by fsr and semg on each degree of freedom considered , in the high - and low - forces experiment , in turn , split across repetitions # 2 , # 3 , # 4 , and # 5 .
training was done on the first repetition only .
testing was done on the ffls ground truth only , to obtain a clearer picture .

the ffls data are used as ground truth .

ffls data are used as ground truth. from the figures , a clear trend up is evident in the case of semg , all the more in the case of the low - forces experiment .
in fact , the slope of a linear fit ( averaged over the six degrees of freedom ) turns out to be 0.0002 +/ - 0.0014 and - 0.0008 +/ - 0.0004 for fsr , and 0.0079 +/ - 0.0005 and 0.0092 +/ - 0.0105 for semg .
this confirms that fsr enjoys a better stability in time with respect to semg .
4 discussion the experiment described in this paper is a comparative analysis among hmis for the disabled .
particular care was taken to ensure that the three hmis under examination were tested in the very same conditions .
since it was infeasible to have the subjects wear the semg electrodes , the pressure sensing bracelet and the ultrasound imaging probe all at the same time , we rather tested the hmis in two pairs , checking later on that the common one ( namely , the tactile bracelet ) would obtain comparable results in the two experiments .
the experimental results show that , overall , all three hmis can be in principle used in a realistic setting - that is , using an incremental , real - time machine - learning method , in principle trained without the usage of sensors for ground truth , and using a very short training procedure ( on minimal and maximal forces only ) .
all three hmis can potentially enforce simultaneous and proportional control over fingers of a multi - fingered prosthesis .
a more detailed discussion of the results follows .
4.1 prediction accuracy ultrasound imaging provided a surprisingly unsatisfactory performance .
according to figures 3 and 4 , the nrmse achieved by ultrasound imaging in the most difficult settings ( that is , when training on the stimulus as ground truth ) hovers around 40 % both in the high - and low - forces experiment .
this is a surprisingly high value if compared to previous work ( sierra gonzalez and castellini , 2013 ) .
it must be noted , however , that in that work , the cross - validation was done by random shuffling of all samples gathered in one series of finger - force repetitions ; this is of great aid to any machine - learning method , since it represents a uniform sampling of the whole probability distribution of the data .
as opposed to that , in this experiment the cross - validation is performed repetition - wise , that is , by training on four out of five repetitions , and then testing on the remaining repetition .
it can therefore be the case that the ultrasound visual features extracted from each repetition slightly differ from one another ( due to probe shift or different levels of muscle activation and shifting from one repetition to the next one ) .
in an initial round of experiments on the same data set performed using random shuffling in cross - validation , error values similar to those obtained in sierra gonzalez and castellini ( 2013 ) have appeared , confirming the above claim .
surface electromyography and pressure sensing , on the other hand , perform better .
in the same hard setting , both semg and pressure sensing achieve errors in the range 10 - 20 % at high - force level , in line with existing literature ( for example , castellini and ravindra , 2014 ; gijsberts et al. , 2014 ) .
though the accuracy , in terms of nrmse , deteriorates at low - force level , it maps onto a force error of just 1.2 n. a direct comparison between these two hmis , performed using student 's t - test , reveals very few significant differences in performance .
4.2 stability over time it is well - known ( merletti et al. , 2011a ) that the semg signal suffers from non - trivial substantial changes over time during stress conditions ; this is due to electrode displacement , muscular fatigue , and the formation of sweat at the interface between the electrodes and the skin .
an hmi based upon pressure sensing , on the other hand , should not suffer from this problem , as the forearm deformations induced by the underlying muscular activity should still reflect the actual activations .
our stability analysis confirms this claim , showing that ( consider now figures 5 and 6 ) the prediction error achieved by semg rapidly degrades over time in both settings , going from 7 - 11 to 8 - 14 % in the high - forces case and from 7 - 15 to 8 - 20 % in the low - forces one .
this is an ominous problem , already highlighted and studied in previous work ( gijsberts et al. , 2014 ) ; the solution that we proposed and positively tested in that paper was that of enforcing an incremental learning system , so that whenever required , prediction errors could be amended by inserting new knowledge in the existing models .
( this is as well the main motivation for using , in this very work , ridge regression with and without random fourier features. ) as opposed to this degradation suffered by semg , the prediction obtained by pressure sensing remains stable at 4 - 10 and 6 - 14 % .
this result is in line with former literature ( yungher et al. , 2011 ) and provides an indication that pressure sensing might be a viable companion to ( or even a substitute of ) semg , when stability over time is an issue .
notice that high - resolution tactile sensing , an approach very closely related to ours , is already being investigated as a means of intent detection for the disabled ( radmand et al. , 2014 ) .
4.3 physiological considerations due to the mainly applicative focus of this work , the analysis presented in this paper neglects almost all physiological aspects of machine - learning - based intent detection / prosthetic control ; in particular , no physical data have been recorded for the subjects ( e.g. , the forearm girdle and length , the muscle fitness , etc. ) , and the analysis has been performed by finding the optimal machine - learning hyperparamters either by referring to previous literature or by extensive ( grid - ) search ( see subsection 3 again ) .
in other words , each model found ( and the associated prediction accuracy ) is the optimal one for the related subject and dataset , irrespective of her / his physical condition and anatomical features .
this is nowadays a standard procedure in rehabilitation robotics , since the aim is that of providing the best precision and effectiveness to any human subject who needs to use the system. with this aim in mind , we have adopted the " realistic setting " detailed in sierra gonzalez and castellini ( 2013 ) , in which the machines are trained on minimal and maximal stimulus values only , since amputees cannot produce force ground truth nor precisely follow graded stimuli .
it is , however , worth to stress once again that the performance testing has been done on the full range of forces , including the intermediate ones .
this means that the prediction performance is the one , which would be obtained on average , on the full range of required forces .
notice , moreover , that disabled subjects usually have abnormal physical / psychophysical parameters with respect to the healthy population ; for example , parkinson patients present a higher amount of non - voluntary muscle activation than control subjects ( torres et al. , 2011 ) .
in the case of transradial amputees , who are the focus population of this research , the stump can hardly be related to the intact human forearm , especially when the amputation is proximal ( watson et al. , 2010 ) , a neuroma is formed and , after the operation , muscles attach to the stump ending , the neuroma itself or the bone stump .
this abnormal reorganization almost prevents the detection of standard muscle activity patterns in such patients ; nevertheless , in most studies in which amputees have tested systems such as the one that we have presented here , it was clear that enough information was still present to reach remarkable levels of control , sometimes to the level of single fingers ( tenore et al. , 2009 ) .
to ensure a reliable prediction , machine - learning methods require repeatable and distinct patterns corresponding to the desired activations , potentially irrespective of their physiological meaning .
4.4 wearability and cost a few qualitative considerations on the wearability and costs of the three examined hmis follow .
ultrasound imaging is , as yet , not wearable .
to the best of our knowledge , neither b - mode ultrasound interface has so far been realized that can be embedded into a prosthetic socket nor any array of ultrasound transducers has been built , that can be embedded in a flexible structure ( e.g. , a lycra sock or glove ) to be worn on the skin .
the only attempt we are aware of so far is represented by guo et al .
( 2013 ) , where one single transducer was affixed to a subject 's forearm , this way realizing a very preliminary form of wearable a - mode ultrasonography .
it must be noted , however , that a really fully wearable us system calls for a quite radical advancement in the technology , since the electronics required to form the beam of ultrasound waves is much more complex than that required for gathering a set of voltages .
in addition to this , the long - term effects of ultrasound waves on the human tissues are still unknown , which would require a clinical trial ( castellini , 2014 ) .
as opposed to this , the wearability of the semg and pressure sensing devices has already been shown in a number of works : semg is in use in the clinics , the electrodes being embedded in the plastic cast , which support the hand prosthesis ; the pressure sensing bracelet that we used here weighs about 65 g and requires no preparation at all ( castellini and ravindra , 2014 ) .
as far the costs are concerned : cheap as it has become in recent times with respect to the past years ( a hand - held ultrasound machine can , at the time of writing , be purchased for about 8.000 usd ) , this kind of hardware remains prohibitively expensive to be shipped along with a hand prosthesis , constituting a relevant fraction of the price of the hand itself ( hovering around 25.000 eur ) .
each semg electrode of the kind that we used here is in the range of 150 - 300 eur a piece , which makes our array significantly cheaper than an ultrasound device ; it must be noted that , probably , even cheaper arrays of semg electrodes can be purchased , but in that case , a further signal processing phase ( rectification , filtering ) must take place before the signal is available to the machine - learning method , raising the cost of the whole approach .
the pressure sensing bracelet , in turn , cost an estimated 50 eur as it employs force - sensing resistors , which can be bought for < 5 eur apiece ( castellini and ravindra , 2014 ) .
4.5 perspectives to summarize , table 1 shows a qualitative comparison of the three hmis ( surface electromyography , pressure sensing , and ultrasound imaging ) considered from the four points of view that we described above : prediction accuracy , stability over time , wearability , and cost .
table 1 qualitative summary of the characteristics of each hmi , denoted as bad / poor / average / good / excellent .
error stability wearability cost high forces low forces high forces low forces semg good good poor poor excellent poor pressure good good good good excellent excellent ultrasound bad bad - - bad bad from this comparison , pressure sensing is favored , as it provides the best accuracy ( comparable to that of surface electromyography ) , but it also keeps a remarkably stable prediction over time ( as opposed to semg ) .
it is also cheaper than semg , while maintaining full wearability .
this does not mean , of course , that pressure sensing is a definitive replacement for semg and / or ultrasound .
we speculate that this novel hmi will suffer from a number of disturbances once it is used in a real - life application ; in particular , its signal will change as the patient swings the forearm ( due to the acceleration of the forearm against the sensors harness ) and , which is more worrisome , as ( s ) he lies the forearm on a surface .
these problems will need to be countered ; one possibility is to fuse this signal with that obtained from semg , which will be much less influenced by such artifacts .
the weak performance of ultrasound imaging in this experiment , together with its low scores as far as cost and wearability are concerned , pose serious doubts on its use as a competitor hmi .
nevertheless , as we had previously claimed ( sierra gonzalez and castellini , 2013 ) , ultrasound images provide an extremely rich set of information about the status of the forearm ; in order to fully exploit it , it could be useful to employ more advanced image processing techniques .
if such a technique can be found , ultrasound imaging could still be employed as a virtual - reality hmi in a clinic , in order to rehabilitate , e.g. , amputees and stroke patients .
5 conclusion inspired by the recent trend in the rehabilitation robotics community , in this paper we have compared three hmis for control of multi - fingered prosthetic hands .
surface electromyography , pressure sensing , and ultrasoundimaging were tested on ten intact subjects engaged in a simple , repetitive application of single - finger - force patterns ; a state - of - the - art machine - learning method was then used to predict the forces using the signals gathered from the hmis .
our experimental results indicate that pressure sensing represents a cheaper alternative to semg , enforcing prediction accuracy comparable to semg , better stability in time , and the same wearability as this more traditional hmi .
conflict of interest statement the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .

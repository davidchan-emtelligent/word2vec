results of this analysis conducted on three different infected cell lines ( htlv - 2a mo - t , c344 and htlv - 2b bjab - gu ) showed that the most abundant mrna was gag / pol followed by the accessory transcript 1 - 3 , coding for the p28 and for p22 / p20 proteins .
the third most abundant mrna was tax / rex .
to investigate if different mrnas produced by htlv - 2 are expressed at different levels upon viral reactivation , we studied the kinetics of viral expression in pbmcs from three subjects infected with htlv - 2b and cultured in vitro for 48 hours .
the level of expression of the full length gag / pol transcript was the highest in all samples .
the tax / rex mrna was detected already at time zero and increased very rapidly following in vitro culture , reaching the highest copy number between zero and 2 - 4 hours .
the minus - strand aph - 2 mrna , was expressed at high level .
as observed in the infected cell lines , the 1 - 3 mrna was expressed at high levels in all subjects .
this finding is particularly intriguing , as it encodes two proteins that were shown to exert a powerful control on tax and rex function .
this peculiar pattern of expression , which is in striking contrast with that of htlv - 1 , might in part explain the differential pathogenicity of the two viruses .

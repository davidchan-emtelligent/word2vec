we report on the detection of electric field - induced second harmonic generation ( efishg ) from the anode interfaces of reduced and oxidized fe - doped srtio3 ( fe : sto ) single crystals .
for the reduced crystal , we observe steady enhancements of the susceptibility components as the imposed dc - voltage increases .
the enhancements are attributed to a field - stabilized electrostriction , leading to fe : ti - o bond stretching and bending in fe : ti - o6 octahedra .
for the oxidized crystal , no obvious structural changes are observed below 16 kv / cm. above 16 kv / cm , a sharp enhancement of the susceptibilities occurs due to local electrostrictive deformations in response to oxygen vacancy migrations away from the anode .
differences between the reduced and oxidized crystals are explained by their relative oxygen vacancy and free carrier concentrations which alter internal electric fields present at the pt / fe : sto interfaces .
our results show that the optical shg technique is a powerful tool for detecting structural changes near perovskite - based oxide interfaces due to field - driven oxygen vacancy migration .
anodes ceramics electrostriction oxides perovskites second harmonic generation 1 .
introduction perovskite - type dielectric and ferroelectric oxides have attracted significant attention for their applications in a variety of electroceramic devices such as capacitors , thermistors , actuators , and sensors [ 1 ] .
in order to improve the overall performance of these devices , it is important to understand breakdown and failure mechanisms brought on by dc - voltage and / or temperature stresses .
theoretical models based on defect chemistry and ionic transport point to the electromigration of oxygen vacancies as playing a dominant role in breakdown mechanisms such as aging , fatigue , and resistance degradation due to their relatively high concentration and mobility in perovskite oxides [ 2,3,4,5,6 ] .
under an applied dc - voltage , the oxygen vacancy concentration undergoes a demixing process in which oxygen ions migrate to the anode while oxygen vacancies migrate to the cathode .
this demixing process occurs over shorter time scales at higher temperatures due to the lowering of the activation energy for oxygen vacancy diffusion [ 7 ] .
in fe - doped srtio3 ( fe : sto ) , ti sites are partially filled by fe atoms exhibiting mixed valence states of either fe3 + or fe4 + such that [ fe ] tot = [ fe3 +] + [ fe4 +] [ 8,9 ] .
to conserve charge neutrality , oxygen vacancies form in the first coordination shell of fe3 + centers .
this leads to a larger oxygen vacancy concentration compared to undoped sto , making fe : sto an excellent material for studying field - induced structural changes due to oxygen vacancy migration [ 5,10,11 ] .
as a nonlinear spectroscopic technique , optical second harmonic generation ( shg ) is a sensitive tool for probing local symmetry changes in dielectric and ferroelectric materials .
recent studies have used the optical shg technique to probe polar domain microstructures in ferroelectric thin films [ 12,13,14 ] , study the surface symmetry of intrinsic and nb - doped srtio3 crystals [ 15 ] , observe near - surface phase transitions in srtio3 [ 16 ] , and detect internal electric fields due to oxygen vacancy ordering in ferroelectric films [ 17 ] .
most recently , optical shg was used to study structural inhomogeneity at electrically degraded fe : sto interfaces [ 18 ] .
in this paper , we report on our detection of electric field - induced structural changes at reduced and oxidized fe - doped srtio3 ( fe : sto ) anode interfaces using optical shg in the reflection geometry .
for the reduced crystal , a gradual increase of the electric field - induced second harmonic generation ( efishg ) intensity is observed with an increasing dc - voltage .
for the oxidized crystal , no obvious efishg intensity changes are identified below 16 kv / cm. when the dc - field further increases above 16 kv / cm , a sharp increase in the efishg intensity is revealed .
the efishg intensity changes from both anode interfaces are explained by electrostrictive distortions to the crystal structure accompanied by oxygen vacancy migrations .
differences in the efishg responses are explained by the presence of internal electric fields at the pt / fe : sto interfaces which depend on local oxygen vacancies and free charge carrier concentrations .
we show that optical shg is a powerful tool for probing electric field - induced structural changes due to oxygen vacancy electromigration in perovskite oxides .
2. experiment and theory the verneuil - grown single crystals of srtio3 doped with 0.01 wt .
% fe were cut into 5 x 5 x 0.5 mm3 pieces and epi - polished on both sides (( 100 ) orientation - - mti , richmond , ca , usa ) .
then 10 - nm - thick , amorphous platinum electrodes were sputtered on both planar sides for dc - field application .
the details of the deposition conditions and the structural analysis , such as x - ray diffraction and cross - sectional transmission electron microscopy , were reported elsewhere [ 19 ] .
to reduce or oxidize the single crystals , we annealed and equilibrated the crystals in a tube furnace at a temperature of 900 degreesc under an oxygen partial pressure ( po2 ) of 2 x 10 - 5 bar and po2 of 0.2 bar , respectively .
then , reduced crystals were quenched in argon while oxidized crystals were quenched in air to freeze - in defect concentrations ([ fe ] ~ 5.58 x 1018 / cm3 ) .
as a result , reduced samples have a larger concentration of fe3 + defect centers and oxygen vacancies ( vo ) while oxidized samples have a larger concentration of fe4 + defect centers and fewer oxygen vacancies .
the calculated defect concentrations of [ vo ] , [ fe3 +] , and [ fe4 +] based on mass action law constants are provided in table 1 [ 9,20 ] .
for optical shg measurements , a mode - locked ti : sapphire ultrashort pulse laser ( 80 mhz , 10 nj / pulse , 100 fs ) was used as the fundamental light source ( 810 nm , ~ 10 microj / cm2 ) with a focused beam spot diameter of ~ 10 microm on the sample .
a glan polarizer and band - pass filter ( thorlabs , fb400 - 40 , newton , nj , usa ) were placed in front of a photomultiplier tube module ( hamamatsu , h9305 - 04 , san jose , ca , usa ) and connected to a lock - in amplifier ( 7265 dsp , photonic solutions , edinburgh , uk ) for signal detection .
as shown in figure 1 , the fe : sto crystals were aligned with their normal axes at a tilt angle of theta = 45degrees with respect to the incident pump pulses traveling along the xz - plane .
a half - wave plate was used to rotate the polarization angle , phi , of the incident pump pulses where phi is the angle between the polarization axis of the incident light and the xz - plane .
under an imposed dc - voltage , the reflected p - polarized ( parallel to the xz - plane , phi = 0degrees ) and s - polarized ( parallel to the y - axis , phi = 90degrees ) efishg intensity profiles were collected as functions of the incident polarization angle from the irradiated pt / fe : sto interfaces .
in our study , a constant optical power is maintained so that all subsequent structural changes in the probed interfacial regions remain a function of the imposed dc - voltage .
at room temperature , the fe : sto crystal bulk has predominately cubic ( pm3m ) lattice symmetry .
as a result of changes in the atomic packing order , inversion symmetry at the ( 100 ) surface is broken along the z - axis ( normal axis ) and the near - surface lattice transitions to tetragonal ( 4mm ) symmetry [ 15,21 ] .
the coherence length for shg in the reflection (+) and transmission ( - ) geometries is expressed as [ 16 ] : ( 1 ) lcoh = lambdaomega4 | nomega +/ - n2omega | where the coherence length represents the depth limit within the crystal that shg radiation can be generated from .
for the incident light of a wavelength of 810 nm , the coherence length in the reflection geometry is ~ 40 nm. although the coherence length serves as an upper limit for the shg probing depth , the actual probing depth in sto has been shown to be less than 1 nm [ 22 ] .
as a result , the field - induced shg response is dominated by electric - dipole and non - centrosymmetric defect contributions from the tetragonal ( 4mm ) pt / fe : sto interface , while bulk contributions are suppressed [ 16 ] .
under an applied dc - voltage , within the dipole approximation , we can write the i - th cartesian coordinate of the nonlinear polarization from the interface as follows : ( 2 ) pi ( 2omega )= epsilonosumjkchiijk ( 2 )( 2omega ; omega,omega ) : ejloc ( omega ) ekloc ( omega )+ epsilonosumjklchiijkl ( 3 )( 2omega ; omega,omega,0 )... ejloc ( omega ) ekloc ( omega ) elloc ( 0 ) the first term accounts for interfacial dipole contributions to the shg response in the absence of an external dc - field and the second term accounts for the dc - field - induced interfacial dipole contributions to the shg response , i.e. , efishg .
here eloc ( omega )= l < - - >( omega ). e ( omega ) , where l < - - >( omega )= lxxomegai ^ i ^+ lyyomegaj ^ j ^+ lzzomegak ^ k ^ is a diagonal tensor consisting of fresnel transformation factors for light propagating at the fundamental frequency through the interfacial region and elloc ( 0 ) represents the l - th cartesian coordinate of the dc - field inside the interfacial region .
the non - vanishing components for the second - order and third - order susceptibility tensors in equation ( 2 ) directly depend on the point group symmetry of the unit cells in the probed region .
the third - order efishg term is reduced to a second - order term by taking l = z and integrating over the interfacial region such that we obtain : ( 3 ) sumjk ( integralchiijkz ( 3 )( 2omega ; omega,omega,0 ) ezloc ( 0 ) dz ) : ejloc ( omega ) ekloc ( omega )= sumjkchiijk ( 2 )( 2omega ; omega,omega )( ezloc ) : ejloc ( omega ) ekloc ( omega ) the transformed second - order efishg susceptibility , chiijk ( 2 )( 2omega ; omega,omega )( ezloc ) , has the same symmetry properties as chiijk ( 2 )( 2omega ; omega,omega ) for an imposed dc - field along the z - axis .
solving for p ( 2omega ) , the effective second - order susceptibility for the interface can be written out explicitly using [ 15,23,24 ] : ( 4 ) chieff ( 2 )=< l < - - >( 2omega ). e ^( 2omega )>. p ( 2omega ) 2epsilono ( eomega ) 2 here , the effective second - order susceptibility represents a function which depends on the tilt and rotational angles , theta and phi , of the incident optical fields ( see figure 1b ) , the imposed dc - voltage , and the non - vanishing susceptibility components of the interface .
further , l < - - >( 2omega )= lxx2omegai ^ i ^+ lyy2omegaj ^ j ^+ lzz2omegak ^ k ^ is a diagonal tensor consisting of fresnel transformation factors for light propagating at the second harmonic frequency through the interfacial region and e ^( 2omega ) is the polarization directional unit vector for the shg electric fields reflected from the interface ( figure 1b ) .
the shg intensities , ip2omega ( phi ) and is2omega ( phi ) , can then be written as functions of the incident light polarization angle , phi , by following i2omega ~| e ( 2omega )| 2 ~ | chieff ( 2 )| 2 and selecting outgoing shg electric field polarizations either parallel to the y - axis ( s - polarized ) or the xz - plane ( p - polarized ) [ 24,25 ] : ( 5 ) ip2omega ( phi )=| chipp cos2phi + chisp sin2phi | 2 ( 6 ) is2omega ( phi )=| chids sin ( 2phi )| 2 where chisp = chizxxefflzz2omega ( lyyomega ) 2sintheta chipp = chizzzefflzz2omega ( lzzomega ) 2sin3theta - 2chixxzefflxx2omegalxxomegalzzomegasinthetacos2theta + chizxxefflzz2omega ( lxxomega ) 2sinthetacos2theta chids = chixxzefflyy2omegalyyomegalzzomegasintheta and chixxzeff = chixxz + chixxz ( ezloc ) chizxxeff = chizxx + chizxx ( ezloc ) chizzzeff = chizzz + chizzz ( ezloc ) 3 .
results and discussion figure 2a,b show the p - polarized and s - polarized efishg intensity profiles from the anode of the reduced fe : sto sample .
solid lines show the fittings obtained using equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) for p - polarized and s - polarized outgoing efishg intensities , respectively .
we observe an apparent difference in magnitude between is ( 45degrees ) and is ( 135degrees ) at 0 v in the absence of an external dc - field which is fitted through the inclusion of a phi - independent term in equation ( 6 ) .
these uneven peaks can be explained as an interference effect for s - polarized shg light [ 26 ] .
at 0 v it can be seen from figure 2 that ip ( 0degrees ) is larger than is ( 45degrees ) and is ( 135degrees ) ; however , as the voltage is increased up to 1200 v , is ( 135degrees ) becomes on par with , if not larger than , ip ( 0degrees ) .
moreover , some small changes in the shg intensity maxima positions are identified in both the p - polarized and s - polarized intensity profiles at higher voltages .
figure 3a shows the effective susceptibility components plotted as functions of the imposed dc - voltage .
fittings show that chizzzeff components are larger than both chizxxeff and chixxzeff for all voltages , as expected for an interface with tetragonal ( 4mm ) symmetry .
previously , the field - induced structural changes to the nonlinear susceptibility components for the abo3 crystal structure have been expressed as [ 27,28,29 ] : ( 7 ) deltachizzz ( ezloc )~ ( db - o ) sigmanl ( deltab + deltao ( i )) ( 8 ) deltachizxx ( ezloc )~ sigmanl ( db - o ) sigmanl ( deltab + deltao ( ii )) here , db - o is the fe : ti - o bond length , deltab and deltao are dc - field induced displacements for the b - site fe : ti cations and o - site oxygen anions , and sigmanl is a factor related to the bond length , bond nonlinearity , and distortion of the o6 octahedron as discussed by levine et al .
[ 27,28 ] .
in the polarizable bond - charge model , deltachizzz ( ezloc ) correlates to a stretching of the c - axis fe : ti - o bonds along the dc - field axis ( z - axis ) while deltachizxx ( ezloc ) correlates to a bending of the crystallographic a - and b - axis fe : ti - o bonds out of the xy - plane .
these field - induced bond - bending and - stretching contributions to the shg response can be interpreted as electrostrictive deformations , as shown in figure 3b .
close to kleinman 's symmetry considerations for a 4mm structure , we would expect deltachizxx ( ezloc ) and deltachixxz ( ezloc ) to be approximately equal at lower voltages [ 29,30 ] .
as oxygen vacancies migrate away from the anode interfacial region , tetragonally stretched fe : ti - o6 octahedra are left behind [ 9,31,32 ] .
in response to the dc - field applied along the z - axis , o2 - anions shift towards the anode interface while sr2 + and ti4 +/( fe3 +/ fe4 +) cations shift away , resulting in significant ionic displacements as shown in figure 3b .
these ionic displacements involve a stretching ( between the b - site cation and anode ) and shortening ( between the b - site cation and cathode ) of fe : ti - o bonds along the c - axis , while transverse fe : ti - o bonds bend out of the crystallographic ab - plane .
the ionic displacements lead to a dipole moment , or polarization , which is associated with the deformed unit cell .
tetragonal ( 4mm ) symmetry of the fe : ti - o6 octahedron holds so long as the four fe : ti - o bonds along the a - and b - axis remain the same lengths , i.e. , a ^= b ^!= c ^ .
it is important to note that electrostriction leads to an elongation of the crystal lattice along the applied field - axis .
this elongation is identified from increases in chizzzeff as the dc - voltage is increased .
for comparison , figure 4a,b show the p - polarized and s - polarized efishg intensity profiles from the anode of the oxidized fe : sto sample .
solid lines show the fittings obtained using equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) for p - polarized and s - polarized efishg intensity profiles , respectively .
similar to the reduced crystal , we observe an apparent difference in magnitude between is ( 45degrees ) and is ( 135degrees ) which is fitted through the inclusion of a phi - independent term in equation ( 6 ) .
small changes in the efishg intensity maxima positions are also identified in both the p - polarized and s - polarized profiles at higher voltages .
figure 5 shows the effective susceptibility components as functions of the imposed dc - voltage for the oxidized fe : sto anode interface .
as expected , fittings also show that chizzzeff components are larger than both chizxxeff and chixxzeff for all voltages ; however , below 16 kv / cm , no obvious structural changes due to electrostriction are observed .
above 16 kv / cm , rapid enhancements of the efishg intensity , and therefore susceptibility components , are observed as shown in figure 5 .
these changes are explained by a field - stabilized electrostriction effect .
around 16 kv / cm , a substantial migration of oxygen vacancies from the anode interface occurs and tetragonally stretched fe : ti - o6 octahedra are left behind .
differences between the efishg responses from the reduced and oxidized fe : sto anode interfaces can be explained in accordance with the model substantiated by de luca et al .
[ 33 ] to explain efishg from laalo3 / srtio3 interfaces .
in their study , the efishg response is explained to arise from an internal electric field , generated by the accumulation of interfacial charged defects , which polarizes electronic orbitals [ 22,33 ] .
for the case of pt / fe : sto , the pt electrode behaves as an electron reservoir and positive charge ( holes ) accumulates between the pt layer and the surface fe : sto layer .
as a result , oxygen anions migrate towards the anode while oxygen vacancies migrate to the cathode .
thus , the efishg response from the fe : sto anode interface can be described in terms of an interfacial electric field which behaves as a barrier which opposes oxygen vacancy migration .
the efishg responses show this interfacial field to be weaker at the reduced anode interface compared to the oxidized anode , resulting in stronger vacancy migration at lower dc - voltages .
for the oxidized crystal , the interfacial field at the anode prevents oxygen vacancy migration until it is quenched by the external dc field near 16 kv / cm. these differences can then be attributed to the crystal 's defect concentrations since the reduced crystal has a higher number of oxygen vacancies and free charge carriers compared to the oxidized sample ( see table 1 ) .
in short , for higher vacancy concentrations , we observe greater electrostrictive distortions at lower dc - voltages .
our observations of structural changes are in good agreement with recent xrd studies performed by hanzig et al .
[ 32 ] and li et al .
[ 31 ] on srtio3 anodes .
both groups identified a lattice expansion along the dc field direction in response to oxygen vacancy migrations .
4. conclusions we employed the optical shg technique to detect electric field - induced structural changes at the anode interfaces of reduced and oxidized fe : sto single crystals .
at the anode of the reduced fe : sto sample , we observed steady enhancements of the susceptibility components as the imposed dc - voltage was increased .
the enhancements are attributed to field - stabilized electrostriction , leading to fe : ti - o bond stretching and bending in fe : ti - o6 octahedra .
at the anode of the oxidized fe : sto sample , no obvious structural changes were observed below 16 kv / cm. above 16 kv / cm , a sharp enhancement of the susceptibilities occurs and is explained by a quenching of the interfacial electric field by the external dc - field , allowing for local electrostrictive deformations to occur in response to oxygen vacancy migrations .
different efishg responses from the reduced and oxidized crystals are consistent with the higher oxygen vacancy concentration in the reduced sample .
our results show that the optical shg technique is a powerful tool for detecting structural changes near perovskite - based oxide interfaces due to oxygen vacancy migration .

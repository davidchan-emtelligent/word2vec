the cohesin protein complex functionally interacts with polycomb group ( pcg ) silencing proteins to control expression of several key developmental genes , such as the drosophila enhancer of split gene complex [ e ( spl ) - c ] .
the e ( spl ) - c contains 12 genes that inhibit neural development .
in a cell line derived from the central nervous system , cohesin and the prc1 pcg protein complex bind and repress e ( spl ) - c transcription , but the repression mechanisms are unknown .
the genes in the e ( spl ) - c are directly activated by the notch receptor .
here we show that depletion of cohesin or prc1 increases binding of the notch intracellular fragment to genes in the e ( spl ) - c , correlating with increased transcription .
the increased transcription likely reflects both direct effects of cohesin and prc1 on rna polymerase activity at the e ( spl ) - c , and increased expression of notch ligands. by chromosome conformation capture we find that the e ( spl ) - c is organized into a self - interactive architectural domain that is co - extensive with the region that binds cohesin and pcg complexes .
the self - interactive architecture is formed independently of cohesin or pcg proteins .
we posit that the e ( spl ) - c architecture dictates where cohesin and pcg complexes bind and act when they are recruited by as yet unidentified factors , thereby controlling the e ( spl ) - c as a coordinated domain .
chromator nipped - b putzig rna polymerase suppressor of hairless djs export v1 the cohesin protein complex , named for its role in sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation , plays multiple dosage - sensitive roles in gene transcription ( chien et al .
2011a ; dorsett and strom 2012 ; dorsett and merkenschlager 2013 ; merkenschlager and odom 2013 ) .
mild disruption of cohesin activity alters gene expression , causing diverse developmental deficits in drosophila , zebrafish , mice , and humans in the absence of any overt effects on chromatid cohesion or chromosome segregation ( reviewed by liu and krantz 2009 ; mannini et al. 2010 ; dorsett 2011 ; horsfield et al. 2012 ; remeseiro and losada 2013 ) .
in humans , these developmental disorders are known collectively as the cohesinopathies , and include cornelia de lange syndrome .
given the ability of cohesin to encircle dna topologically and hold sister chromatids together ( nasmyth 2011 ) , much interest has centered on cohesin 's potential architectural roles in gene expression , such as facilitating looping between transcriptional enhancers and promoters .
this interest also stems from the original discovery in a drosophila genetic screen that sister chromatid cohesion factors facilitate long - range gene activation ( rollins et al. 1999 ) .
more recent genomic binding and chromosome conformation capture ( 3c ) experiments confirm the idea that cohesin regulates gene transcription by controlling chromosome architecture .
for instance , cohesin and the nipped - b ( i.e. , nipbl ) cohesin loading factor bind to virtually all extragenic enhancers and many active promoters , and decreases in cohesin dosage reduce enhancer - promoter looping interactions ( kagey et al. 2010 ; chien et al. 2011b ; seitan et al. 2011 ; schaaf et al. 2013a ) .
cohesin has roles in gene transcription beyond controlling chromosome architecture .
cohesin and nipped - b selectively bind to active gene promoters that have high levels of transcriptionally engaged but paused rna polymerase ii ( pol ii ) just downstream of the transcription start site ( fay et al. 2011 ; faure et al. 2012 ; schaaf et al. 2013a ) .
at genes that are repressed by cohesin , cohesin and nipped - b inhibit transition of paused pol ii to elongation at a step distinct from that controlled by the nelf ( negative elongation factor ) and dsif ( drb sensitivity inducing factor ) pausing factors ( fay et al. 2011 ) .
at a large fraction of active genes , cohesin and nipped - b have the opposite effect , and stimulate transition to elongation ( fay et al. 2011 ; schaaf et al. 2013a ) .
at least part of cohesin 's stimulatory effect likely stems from facilitating enhancer - promoter interactions , which aids phosphorylation of pol ii and the pausing factors by positive transcriptional elongation factor b ( p - tefb ) kinase .
the evidence also suggests , however , that cohesin stimulates pol ii kinase activity independently of its role in enhancer - promoter communication because cohesin depletion simultaneously decreases the levels of phosphorylated pol ii but increases the levels of p - tefb and cdk12 pol ii kinases in the bodies of many active genes ( schaaf et al. 2013a ) .
cohesin also indirectly alters transcription of many active genes that do n't bind cohesin , which may arise in part from its positive regulation of the myc gene ( rhodes et al. 2010 ; schaaf et al .
2013a ) , which encodes a protein that directly stimulates transcription of most active genes ( lin et al. 2012 ; nie et al. 2012 ) .
cohesin directly facilitates binding of the prc1 polycomb group ( pcg ) complex to active genes , where prc1 inhibits premature entry of underphosphorylated pol ii into elongation ( schaaf et al. 2013b ) .
cohesin facilitates prc1 binding to active genes despite the absence of the prc2 complex , which makes the histone h3 lysine 27 trimethylation ( h3k27me3 ) mark that aids prc1 binding to pcg - silenced genes .
indeed , cohesin depletion simultaneously decreases prc1 binding to active genes and increases prc1 binding to silenced genes , indicating that cohesin indirectly controls silencing by sequestering much of the available prc1 at active genes ( schaaf et al. 2013b ) .
although cohesin is absent from the transcription units of pcg - silenced genes , it binds many polycomb response elements ( pres ) that initiate and mediate silencing ( misulovin et al. 2008 ) .
cohesin depletion can reduce pre - pre looping interactions , suggesting that although cohesin indirectly inhibits silencing by sequestering prc1 , it may simultaneously architecturally support silencing ( schaaf et al. 2013b ) .
taken together , therefore , the current data indicate that cohesin directly and indirectly controls the transcription of a majority of active and pcg - silenced genes via a combination of architectural and other mechanisms .
several of the genes that are strongly repressed by cohesin are unusual in that they show rare extended overlaps of cohesin and the h3k27me3 mark made by prc2 ( schaaf et al. 2009 ; fay et al. 2011 ; schaaf et al. 2013b ) .
these genes , all of which encode key developmental transcription factors , are not fully silenced , and their transcription increases substantially upon depletion of either cohesin or prc1 .
these genes do not have the cohesin - h3k27me3 state in all cell types .
for example , the invected and engrailed gene complex has the cohesin - h3k27me3 state in ml - dmbg3 ( bg3 ) cells derived from drosophila central nervous system but not in sg4 cells or wing discs .
in sg4 cells and anterior wing disc , the invected - engrailed gene complex has a pcg - silenced state with h3k27me3 and prc1 but no cohesin , and in anterior wing disc , it is transcriptionally active and binds cohesin and prc1 without h3k27me3 ( schaaf et al. 2009 ; schaaf et al. 2013b ) .
this raises the question of whether the cohesin - h3k27me3 state is a transition between the silenced and active states and / or a specialized state needed to restrain and hold transcription at a critical submaximal level .
the roles of cohesin and prc1 in maintaining this rare state are also unknown .
to gain further insights into the cohesin - h3k27me3 restrained state , we examined the roles of cohesin and prc1 in controlling the architecture and expression of the enhancer of split gene complex [ e ( spl ) - c ] in bg3 cells .
this complex contains twelve short genes , many of which encode helix - loop - helix ( hlh ) dna binding proteins that repress neural fate , and which are transcriptionally activated by the notch receptor .
in bg3 cells , the entire 50 - kb complex binds cohesin and has the h3k27me3 histone modification made by the prc2 complex ( schaaf et al. 2009 ) .
surprisingly , we find that the e ( spl ) - c has a highly self - interactive architecture that is independent of cohesin , prc1 , and the chromator - putzig / z4 ( chro - pzg / z4 ) protein complex that binds near the ends of the gene complex .
cohesin and prc1 depletion increase binding of the notch activator to e ( spl ) - c genes , which likely stems at least in part from increased expression of notch ligand genes .
based on these and prior findings we posit that the e ( spl ) - c architecture determines where cohesin and prc1 bind in the e ( spl ) - c when they are recruited by unknown factors , and that cohesin and prc1 control e ( spl ) - c transcription through combined direct and indirect mechanisms .

results cohesin and prc1 depletion increases notch activator occupancy at the enhancer of split gene complex in ml - dmbg3 ( bg3 ) cells cohesin binding overlaps the h3k27me3 silencing mark made by prc2 complex throughout the e ( spl ) - c in bg3 cells ( figure 1 ; misulovin et al. 2008 ; schaaf et al. 2009 ) .
as predicted by the h3k27me3 pattern , the prc1 pcg complex is also present at many locations spread throughout the e ( spl ) - c complex in bg3 cells ( figure 1 ; schaaf et al. 2013b ) .
we confirmed that prc1 at the e ( spl ) - c is active by conducting genomic chip with tiling microarrays ( chip - chip ) for the mono - ubiquitinated histone h2a ( h2aub ) modification produced by the sce subunit of prc1 .
similar to the cohesin and h3k27me3 patterns , the h2aub modification extends throughout the entire complex , but not into flanking regions ( figure 1 ) .

2013b ) , the rad21 cohesin subunit in control and prc1 ( ph ) depleted cells ( schaaf et al. 2013b ) , and pol ii ( misulovin et al. 2008 ) .
the bars beneath the chip - chip tracks indicate binding is significant at p <= 10 - 3 using the mat ( johnson et al. 2006 ) algorithm .
the deltapc and deltarad21 tracks show the difference in chip mat score between the rad21 and ph rnai - treated and mock control cells at each microarray feature ( schaaf et al. 2013b ) .
the bars above and below the deltapc and deltarad21 tracks indicate where this difference is two standard deviations more or less from the mean genome - wide difference for at least three microarray features in a row (~ 105 bp ) ( schaaf et al. 2013b ) .
the pro - seq ( global run - on sequencing ) tracks show the levels of transcriptionally engaged pol ii for the plus (+ , red ) and minus ( - , green ) strands ( schaaf et al. 2013b ) .
rnai - mediated depletion of cohesin , kollerin , or prc1 subunits increases rna produced by the active e ( spl ) - c genes by 5 - to 100 - fold in bg3 cells , depending on the gene and the extent of depletion ( schaaf et al. 2009 ; fay et al. 2011 ; schaaf et al. 2013a , 2013b ) .
rna turnover experiments show that the greater mrna levels upon cohesin depletion are caused by increased transcription not increased rna stability ( schaaf et al. 2009 ) .
the similar response of all the active e ( spl ) - c genes to cohesin and prc1 depletion , and the extended cohesin binding and pcg histone marks suggests that cohesin and prc1 regulate the e ( spl ) - c as a coordinated chromatin domain .
pol ii is transcriptionally engaged and paused at many of the promoters of the active e ( spl ) - c genes before cohesin or prc1 depletion , indicating that the genes are poised for increased transcription ( figure 1 ; schaaf et al. 2013a ) .
individual e ( spl ) - c genes are directly activated by the notch receptor ( bailey and posakony 1995 ) .
the increased e ( spl ) - c transcription may thus in part reflect the 2 - to 5 - fold increases in serrate notch ligand gene expression that occur upon cohesin or prc1 depletion ( schaaf et al. 2009 ; schaaf et al. 2013b ) .
cohesin and prc1 both bind to the serrate promoter region ( misulovin et al. 2008 ; schaaf et al. 2013b ) .
activation of notch releases the notch intracellular fragment ( nicd ) that translocates to the nucleus and interacts with the suppressor of hairless [ su ( h )] protein bound upstream of each e ( spl ) - c gene .
we used chip - qpcr to measure the levels of su ( h ) and nicd at known su ( h ) binding sites upstream of the hlhmbeta and hlhm3 genes , which show the highest levels of paused pol ii by pro - seq , before and after cohesin and prc1 depletion .
nicd binding increased from undetectable to 3 - and 1.5 - fold enrichment at the hlhmbeta and hlhm3 su ( h ) binding sites in the e ( spl ) - c when bg3 cells were depleted for the rad21 cohesin subunit , and similar increases occurred when the ph subunit of prc1 was depleted ( figure 2a ) .
significant nicd binding was detected at hlhmbeta , but not at hlhm3 when the nipped - b subunit of the kollerin complex that loads cohesin onto chromosomes was depleted .
su ( h ) binding was detected at these sites in untreated cells , and the levels were not significantly altered by cohesin , kollerin , or prc1 depletion ( figure 2a ) .
figure 2 cohesin and prc1 restrict notch activator binding to the e ( spl ) - c when notch activation is low in bg3 cells .
( a ) the top panel shows the chip - qpcr analysis of nicd binding to the hlhmbeta and hlhm3 su ( h ) binding sites in bg3 cells and bg3 cells depleted for rad21 ( cohesin ) , nipped - b ( kollerin ) , and ph ( prc1 ) for 5 d. chip was performed with two to four independent chromatin preparations for each group .
enrichment of the binding site sequences is calculated relative to an empty control site on chromosome 3r .
standard errors were calculated using all biological and qpcr replicates .
the middle panel shows the same nicd chip - qpcr analysis as in the top panel , except that notch was activated by treating the cells with edta for 30 min before isolating chromatin .
the cells were from the same cultures used to prepare chromatin without edta treatment .
the bottom panel shows the chip - qpcr for su ( h ) using the same chromatin samples used in the top panel .
( b ) blocking notch processing with the dapt gamma secretase inhibitor overnight reduces the expression of the e ( spl ) - c genes in control cells and cells depleted for cohesin ( rad21 ) for 5 d. dapt or vehicle control was added to the cultures on the evening of the fourth day of rnai treatment .
rna levels were quantified by rt - qpcr , normalized to rpl32 rna levels , and expressed relative to the hlhmdelta rna levels in the control mock - treated cells .
standard errors were calculated using all qpcr replicates .
the data shown is from one experiment , but similar results were obtained in multiple independent experiments .
( c ) treatment of bg3 cells with edta for 30 min increases e ( spl ) - c gene transcripts 100 - fold or more .
transcript levels were quantified as described for panel b , and are shown on a log10 scale .
we examined nicd occupancy of su ( h ) binding sites upstream of other e ( spl ) - c genes , but it was not detectable even after cohesin or ph depletion .
the difficulty in detecting nicd at the e ( spl ) - c genes arises from several factors .
nicd is usually present at low levels , does not directly bind dna , and nicd bound to genes is subject to ubiquitination and degradation ( fryer et al. 2002 , 2004 ) .
the genes where we can detect nicd , hlhmbeta and hlhm3 , in addition to higher levels of paused pol ii , show regions of lower h3k27me3 and h2aub histone marks than other e ( spl ) - c genes ( figure 1 , supporting information , figure s1a ) .
close examination reveals significant h2aub levels over the bodies of both of these genes , and h3k27me3 and pc over hlhm3 ( figure s1a ). by chip - qpcr , these genes show a 7 - to 10 - fold enrichment of h3k27me3 at their promoters ( figure s1b ) .
these observations , and the fact that cohesin and prc1 depletion alters expression of hlhmbeta and hlhm3 in the same manner as it alters expression of the other e ( spl ) - c genes , argues that they are under the same type of regulation by cohesin and prc1 .
the lowest levels of pcg histone marks in both cases are between the promoter - paused pol ii and the upstream su ( h ) - binding sites , suggesting that greater pol ii and su ( h ) occupancy may create a region of reduced nucleosome density ( figure s1a ) .
although we did not detect nicd at any of the e ( spl ) - c genes examined in control cells , the basal levels of e ( spl ) - c transcription are notch - dependent .
overnight treatment of bg3 cells with dapt , a gamma secretase inhibitor that blocks notch receptor processing , reduces e ( spl ) - c transcripts ( figure 2b ) .
the increases in e ( spl ) - c transcripts upon cohesin depletion are diminished by dapt treatment , consistent with the idea that increased nicd occupancy contributes to the increased transcription ( figure 2b ) .
treatment of drosophila cell lines with edta releases the nicd fragment from the notch receptor at the cell membrane , mimicking strong receptor activation , and greatly increases expression of notch target genes ( krejci and bray 2007 ) .
edta treatment of bg3 cells increased multiple e ( spl ) - c transcripts a hundred - fold or more ( figure 2c ) , and nicd occupancy upstream of hlhmbeta and hlhm3 increased to 10 - fold and 6 - fold enrichment ( figure 2a ) .
under these conditions , depletion of rad21 , nipped - b , or ph did not further increase nicd occupancy ( figure 2a ) .
the aforementioned experiments argue that when notch activation is low , depletion of cohesin or prc1 increases e ( spl ) - c transcription by increasing the amount of nicd bound to su ( h ) upstream of the individual e ( spl ) - c genes .
this could reflect increased serrate expression , combined with direct effects on nicd occupancy at the e ( spl ) - c. for example , cohesin and prc1 could form a structure that restricts access of nicd to the entire gene complex , or cohesin and prc1 bound to the e ( spl ) - c might also facilitate nicd degradation .
we considered the possibility that depletion of cohesin or prc1 might have similar direct effects on e ( spl ) - c transcription if their binding is codependent but found that this is not the case .
cohesin interacts directly with prc1 ( strubbe et al. 2011 ) and cohesin depletion reduces binding of prc1 to active genes that lack h3k27me3 , and increases binding of prc1 to genes with h3k27me3 ( schaaf et al. 2013b ) .
at the e ( spl ) - c , there is a modest decrease in pc levels at the centromere - proximal ( left ) end where h3k27me3 is low , and an increase in the middle of the complex where h3k27me3 is high upon rad21 depletion ( figure 1 ) .
there is no substantial change in rad21 binding after ph depletion ( figure 1 ) .
depletion of rad21 for several days also does not affect the levels of h3k27me3 at the several positions tested ( figure s1b ) .
simultaneous depletion of rad21 and pc did not give a synergistic increase in e ( spl ) - c transcripts , even with submaximal depletions of both ( figure s2 ) .
the transcript increases upon rad21 and pc codepletion were either similar to the increases seen by depletion of one or the other , or slightly greater .
this argues that cohesin and prc1 together target the same step in e ( spl ) - c transcription , so that loss of one is equivalent to functional loss of both .
the e ( spl ) - c complex has a self - interactive greater order structure independent of cohesin and prc1 evidence from the invected - engrailed gene complex , which is also co - repressed by cohesin and prc1 in bg3 cells , but is not notch - activated , suggests that cohesin architecturally contributes to prc1 - mediated repression by facilitating long - range looping interactions between pres ( schaaf et al. 2013b ) .
pres initiate and maintain pcg - silencing , and pcg protein - dependent pre - pre interactions increase their activity ( delest et al. 2012 ; kassis and brown 2013 ) .
no pres in the e ( spl ) - c have been identified , and we thus tested the idea that cohesin and prc1 might facilitate looping interactions that repress e ( spl ) - c transcription .
the idea that the e ( spl ) - c might have a cohesin - prc1 - dependent architecture also arose from the binding of cohesin , h3k27me3 , and h2aub throughout the entire e ( spl ) - c in bg3 cells , but not in the flanking regions ( figure 1 ) .
we used chromosome conformation capture ( 3c ) analysis ( dekker et al .
2002 ) with five anchor ecori restriction sites over a 100 - kb region to examine the looping structure of the e ( spl ) - c. two anchors ( a , e ) are outside of the complex on either side , two ( b , d ) are at the inside ends , and one ( c ) is in the center of the complex ( figure 1 ; figure 3 ) .
the interactions between these sites were determined by qpcr and normalized to a religated bac control template .
anchors within the complex ( b , c , d ) exhibit high interaction frequencies with all sites tested within the complex , but little interaction with sites outside the complex ( figure 3 ) .
in contrast , anchors outside of the complex ( a , e ) exhibit local interactions with neighboring sites , but little interaction with sites within the e ( spl ) - c. figure 3 the e ( spl ) - c has a highly self - interactive structure independent of cohesin and prc1 in bg3 and sg4 cells .
chromosome conformation capture ( 3c ) was performed as previously described ( schaaf et al .
2013b ) using five anchors indicated by gray vertical bars .
the precise anchor locations are shown in figure 1 .
the shaded area indicates the extent of the e ( spl ) - c. the y - axis gives the enrichment of 3c ligation to the anchor site relative to religated bac dna control .
the left panels show the 3c enrichment for bg3 cells , and bg3 cells depleted for rad21 for 4 - 5 d , and bg3 cells depleted for pc for 4 - 6 d. at least two independent 3c libraries were made for each sample .
examples of rad21 and pc protein depletion are shown in figure s2 .
standard errors were calculated using all biological and qpcr replicates .
the right panels compare the control bg3 analysis shown in the left panels to 3c analysis in sg4 cells .
to test whether cohesin or prc1 proteins facilitate the extensive looping interactions within the e ( spl ) - c , we performed 3c analysis after depletion of rad21 or pc. although these depletions greatly increased transcription , there were only minor quantitative changes in the interaction of anchor d with immediately flanking regions ( figure 3 , left panels ) .
however , the overall pattern of extensive interactions within the complex , and little interaction outside of the complex , was not appreciably altered .
this argues that the highly self - interactive structure of the e ( spl ) - c is not formed by cohesin or prc1 .
we considered the possibility that only low levels of cohesin and prc1 are needed to form the structure and that rnai depletion , which reduces cohesin or pc levels by some 80 % , is insufficient to alter the interactions .
we thus examined the 3c structure of the e ( spl ) - c in sg4 cells , in which there is no h3k27me3 in the e ( spl ) - c ( schaaf et al. 2009 ) .
sg4 cells are derived from s2 cells , which do not express the notch receptor .
a few e ( spl ) - c genes ( hlhmdelta , hlhmbeta , hlhm3 , hlhm6 ) bind cohesin and pol ii in sg4 cells and show low levels of expression that is not altered by cohesin depletion ( schaaf et al. 2009 ) .
strikingly , the e ( spl ) - c has a 3c structure in sg4 cells similar to that seen in bg3 cells , with only minor differences ( figure 3 , right panels ) .
we conclude , therefore , that the e ( spl ) - c self - interactive domain does not depend on cohesin or prc1 .
because this interactive domain is co - extensive with the cohesin - h2k27me3 region in bg3 cells , we hypothesize that this higher order structure establishes where cohesin and the pcg complexes bind and function when they are recruited to the e ( spl ) - c by unknown factors .
an early origin of dna replication is centered over the e ( spl ) - c in bg3 and other cell lines ( figure 1 ; modencode consortium et al. 2010 ) .
we thus also tested the possibility that the self - interactive structure in the e ( spl ) - c complex is the replication bubble present in early s - phase in the asynchronous cells used for 3c analysis .
we blocked bg3 cells at the g1 / s boundary and in g2 of the cell cycle using aphidicolin and dimethyl sulfoxide .
there was no appreciable difference in the 3c structure of the e ( spl ) - c in the g1 / s and g2 cells from that seen in the asynchronous cell population , indicating that the self - interactive structure is not the replication bubble present in s phase ( figure s3 ) .
regulation of the e ( spl ) - c by the chromator - putzig / z4 protein complex we considered the idea that the e ( spl ) - c 3c structure may be formed by insulator proteins , which show less variation in binding between different cell types .
however , inspection of genomic insulator chip data ( schwartz et al .
2012 ) revealed that there are no known insulator sites flanking or within the e ( spl ) - c in bg3 cells .
moreover , depletion of cp190 , a protein required for the function of all known drosophila insulators , does not significantly alter e ( spl ) - c expression in bg3 cells ( schaaf et al. 2009 ) .
the chromator ( chro ) chromodomain protein binds at the telomere - proximal ( right ) end of the e ( spl ) - c in bg3 cells , and several kilobases upstream of the centromere - proximal end ( figure 1 , modencode consortium et al. 2010 ) .
chro interacts with the putzig ( pzg / z4 ) zinc finger protein , and they colocalize on salivary gland polytene chromosomes ( gortchakov et al. 2005 ) .
lack of chro or pzg / z4 alters the structure of salivary gland polytene chromosomes , suggesting that they may play key roles in higher order chromatin architecture ( eggert et al. 2004 ; rath et al. 2006 ) .
pzg / z4 also positively regulates notch signaling in wing imaginal discs ( kugler and nagel 2007 ) .
we thus tested the possibilities that chro and pzg / z4 may participate in formation of the e ( spl ) - c 3c structure and regulate e ( spl ) - c transcription .
depletion of chro or pzg / z4 in bg3 cells increased expression of multiple genes in the e ( spl ) - c several - fold ( figure 4a ) .
this includes a 10 - fold or greater increase in expression of the hlhm3 gene in the middle of the complex , even though the chro - pzg / z4 binding sites are located outside the complex .
the location of the chro binding sites and the changes in e ( spl ) - c expression upon chro or pzg / z4 depletion suggested that chro and pzg / z4 might affect the e ( spl ) - c architecture , but depletion of chro or pzg / z4 did not measurably alter the interactions measured by 3c ( figure s4 ) .

( a ) chro and pzg / z4 rnai treatment for 6 days increases expression of e ( spl ) - c genes .
examples of pzg / z4 protein depletion are shown in figure s5 .
rna quantification was performed as described in figure 2 .
the results shown are from one experiment , and similar results were obtained in multiple independent experiments .

( d ) plot of fluorescence intensity of rad21 and pzg / z4 immunostaining over a representative 15 - mum length of salivary gland polytene chromosome .
pzg / z4 rnai treatment decreased pzg / z4 protein and rna in a dosage and time - dependent manner ( figure s5 , a and b ) .
we were unable to detect chro protein by western blot , and chro rnai treatment slightly increased chro rna transcripts ( figure s5a ) .
intriguingly , however , chro dsrna decreased pzg / z4 rna to a similar extent as pzg / z4 rnai treatment ( figure s5a ) , suggesting that chro rnai likely decreases the levels of both proteins .
we tested the possibility that chro and pzg / z4 depletion might alter e ( spl ) - c expression indirectly by altering cohesin or notch activity .
chro and pzg / z4 depletion increased rad21 and nipped - b rna levels , which would be expected to decrease e ( spl ) - c expression ( figure s5c ) .
although rad21 rna transcripts increased , the rad21 protein levels were not appreciably altered ( figure s5b ) .
we found , however , that the levels of the delta and serrate notch ligand gene rnas increased 2 - to fourfold upon chro or pzg / z4 rnai treatment , suggesting that increased notch receptor activation may contribute to increased e ( spl ) - c expression ( figure s5d ) .
chro binds to the delta gene promoter region , but not to serrate in bg3 cells ( modencode consortium et al. 2010 ) .
we also considered the possibility the chro - pzg / z4 complex might control e ( spl ) - c transcription by influencing cohesin binding based on immunostaining of salivary gland polytene chromosomes and genomic chip patterns .
chro , pzg / z4 , and cohesin all bind preferentially to polytene interband regions , which represent less compacted , transcriptionally active chromatin , as revealed by dapi staining ( figure 4 , b and c ) .
in most regions , the peaks of chro ( not shown ) and pzg / z4 staining interdigitate with the cohesin peaks ( figure 4d ) .
similarly , when genomic chip enrichment for chro and rad21 in bg3 cells are plotted against each other , regions with high rad21 usually have low chro binding , and vice versa ( figure 4b ) .
this also reveals , however , that there are sites where cohesin and chro binding overlap , and that there are often low levels of cohesin at chro - binding sites and vice versa .
these overlaps give rise to a significant genome - wide correlation of 0.41 between chro and rad21 binding .
we tested the possibility that chro and pzg / z4 could form boundaries that limit where cohesin binds , and influence cohesin binding to the e ( spl ) - c by performing rad21 chip after pzg / z4 depletion .
we found , however , that pzg / z4 depletion did not alter cohesin levels at the hlhmbeta and hlhm3 promoter regions ( figure s5e ) .
we posit , therefore , that the effect of chro and pzg / z4 on e ( spl ) - c expression is most likely caused by increased expression of notch ligands .
discussion in these studies we investigated the regulation of the e ( spl ) - c complex by cohesin , prc1 , and the chro - z4 / pzg protein complex in bg3 cells , in which the e ( spl ) - c has a rare restrained state with a cohesin - h3k27me3 overlap .
we find that the e ( spl ) - c has a highly self - interactive structure that is unexpectedly independent of these protein complexes and the level of gene expression .
depletion of any of these three protein complexes , however , significantly increases e ( spl ) - c transcription .
as discussed herein , the effects of these three protein complexes on e ( spl ) - c expression likely reflect changes in expression of notch ligands , and in the cases of cohesin and prc1 , potentially direct effects on activator and pol ii activity at the e ( spl ) - c genes ( figure 5 ) .
figure 5 architecture and regulation of the e ( spl ) - c in bg3 cells .
we theorize that unknown architectural proteins ( red ovals ) form the self - interactive domain that encompasses the e ( spl ) - c , and that this domain dictates where cohesin ( red ring ) and the prc1 ( green oval ) and prc2 ( orange oval ) polycomb group complexes bind when they are recruited by as yet unidentified factors .
prc2 is usually found only at the ends of h3k27me3 domains ( schwartz et al. 2010 ) .
cohesin and prc1 indirectly control e ( spl ) - c transcription by repressing expression of the serrate gene that encodes a ligand ( pink oval ) for the notch transmembrane receptor .
the chro - pzg / z4 protein complex similarly inhibits serrate expression .
notch activation releases the nicd activator fragment ( light blue rectangle ) that translocates to the nucleus and binds to su ( h ) ( purple circles ) .
nicd is not detected at all genes in the complex , even some that are active in a notch - dependent manner .
we propose that cohesin and prc1 also directly hinder transition of paused rna pol ii to elongation at the active e ( spl ) - c genes , as they do at several other genes ( fay et al. 2011 ; schaaf et al. 2013a ; schaaf et al. 2013b ) .
architecture of the e ( spl ) - c domain 3c analysis revealed that the e ( spl ) - c has a structure in which all positions within the complex interact with each other at a high frequency , but not with flanking regions .
surprisingly , we found that this architecture is independent of cohesin , the pcg complexes , the chro - pzg / z4 complex , transcription , and stage of the cell cycle .
we thus do not know the factors that establish this striking architecture , which defines the e ( spl ) - c as a structurally independent domain .
we also do not yet know the factors that control recruitment of cohesin and pcg complexes to the locus .
we speculate , however , that this architecture coordinates transcriptional control of the entire e ( spl ) - c , based on the finding that in bg3 cells , cohesin , prc1 , and the h2aub and h3k27me3 histone modifications made by the prc1 and prc2 complexes are co - extensive within this architectural domain .
although no known insulators or boundary elements flank the e ( spl ) - c , and depletion of the cp190 protein required for activity of all known drosophila insulators does not alter e ( spl ) - c expression , it is likely that the unknown factors that form this structure limit the spread of these protein complexes and histone marks .
the e ( spl ) - c architectural domain may be evolutionarily significant , because notch - regulated enhancer of split complexes with similar structures are conserved in insects and crustaceans over 420 million years ( maeder et al. 2007 ; duncan and dearden 2010 ) .
possible clues to the identities of the factors that control the e ( spl ) - c architecture and / or the recruitment of cohesin and pcg complexes may arise in genetic screens for factors that alter e ( spl ) - c sensitive phenotypes , such as the nspl - 1 rough eye and bristle phenotypes .
these phenotypes are sensitive to mutations in the e ( spl ) - c and cohesin genes in a highly dosage - sensitive manner , and modest changes in the e ( spl ) - c architecture or recruitment of cohesin or pcg proteins may have similar effects ( nagel and preiss 1999 ; rollins et al. 1999 ; schaaf et al. 2009 ) .
there is coordinate regulation of gene complexes by cohesin in mammalian cells .
the protocadherin beta ( pchdb ) gene complex is down - regulated in the embryonic fibroblasts and brains of mice heterozygous mutant for the nipbl cohesin loading factor , and brains of mice that are homozygous mutant for the sa1 cohesin subunit ( kawauchi et al. 2009 ; remeseiro et al .
2012 ) , and cohesin is involved in enhancer - promoter looping in the protocadherin alpha ( pchda ) complex , helping determine which genes in the complex are active ( guo et al. 2012 ; monahan et al. 2012 ) .
although this is a positive role for cohesin , as opposed to the repressive role that occurs in the e ( spl ) - c , it is possible that the protocadherin gene clusters also have a higher - order architecture that dictates how cohesin functions within the gene complex .
recent genome - wide analysis also indicates that there are constitutive higher order looping architectures that may organize cell - type specific interactions on a shorter scale , and that cohesin contributes to both types of structures ( phillips - cremins et al. 2013 ) .
effects of cohesin , prc1 , and chro - pzg / z4 on notch signaling previous studies showed that depletion of cohesin or prc1 increases expression of the serrate notch ligand gene ( schaaf et al. 2009 , 2013b ) .
this likely explains part of the increase in e ( spl ) - c transcription upon cohesin and prc1 depletion , because the e ( spl ) - c genes are directly activated by notch .
consistent with this idea , we detected increases in nicd association with the hlhmbeta and hlhm3 genes upon cohesin or prc1 depletion .
edta treatment confirms that increasing notch activation increases nicd binding to the e ( spl ) - c genes .
because cohesin and prc1 , unlike the chro - pzg / z4 complex , bind directly to the e ( spl ) - c , it is also possible that they also directly control association of nicd with the su ( h ) protein bound upstream of the active genes .
for example , they could potentially interact with nicd or the su ( h ) complex , and interfere with nicd association , or somehow facilitate ubiquitination and degradation of nicd .
the lack of an effect of cohesin or prc1 depletion on nicd association with e ( spl ) - c genes after edta treatment does not rule out this possibility , because under these conditions , the amount of nicd is no longer limiting .
it remains to be determined whether the multiple effects of cohesin on notch function seen in drosophila , including regulation of notch ligand and target genes , also occur in mammals .
if so , this could underlie many of the development deficits seen in cornelia de lange syndrome , caused by mutations in nipbl and cohesin subunit genes ( liu and krantz 2009 ) .
mutations in notch receptor and ligand genes cause alagille and other syndromes that affect many of the same tissues as cornelia de lange syndrome ( penton et al. 2012 ) .
other potential direct roles of cohesin and prc1 in e ( spl ) - c repression we also cannot rule out the possibility that cohesin and prc1 directly repress e ( spl ) - c transcription independently of any effects on notch ligand expression or nicd association with the e ( spl ) - c genes .
this is because both bind throughout the complex , and the prc1 - generated h2aub repressive histone mark is co - extensive with the e ( spl ) - c architectural domain .
importantly , all genes in bg3 cells that show rare extended overlap of cohesin and the prc2 - generated h3k27me3 modification , such as the invected and engrailed gene complex , show substantial increases in transcription upon cohesin or prc1 depletion , even though they are not notch activated ( fay et al. 2011 ; schaaf et al. 2009 , 2013a,b ) .
it is highly unlikely that cohesin or prc1 depletion increases the expression of all the diverse activators that control these genes , and more likely that cohesin and prc1 directly repress their transcription .
at all genes examined that are strongly repressed by cohesin , cohesin restricts the transition of paused rna pol ii into elongation , irrespective of whether or not they have the h3k27me3 mark ( fay et al. 2011 ) .
prc1 restricts entry of paused pol ii into elongation at active genes that bind cohesin and prc1 , but lack prc2 and the h3k27me3 modification ( schaaf et al. 2013b ) .
we thus posit that cohesin and prc1 together restrict transition of the paused pol ii present at the active e ( spl ) - c genes into elongation .
because codepletion of cohesin and prc1 does not synergistically increase transcription , we think it is likely that they function together at the same step .
cohesin and prc1 directly interact with each other , and cohesin facilitates binding of prc1 to active genes that lack the h3k27me3 mark ( strubbe et al. 2011 ; schaaf et al. 2013b ) .
cohesin depletion , however , does not significantly alter prc1 association with the e ( spl ) - c , likely because prc1 binding is stabilized by the known interaction of prc1 with h2k27me3 ( fischle et al. 2003 ) .
prc1 is thus not sufficient to repress e ( spl ) - c transcription in the absence of cohesin , indicating that cohesin has roles that extend beyond its interaction with prc1 .

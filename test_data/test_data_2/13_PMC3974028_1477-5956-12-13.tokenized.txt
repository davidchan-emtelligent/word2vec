objective to identify the protein regulation profile of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein - 2 ( rhbmp - 2 ) - induced osteogenic differentiation in beagle bone marrow stem cells ( bmscs ) .
methods beagle bmscs were isolated and cultured with or without rhbmp - 2 .
two - dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to determine the differences in protein expression in rhbmp - 2 - induced and non - induced bmscs .
real - time pcr and western blotting analyses were used to verify the expression patterns of selected proteins .
results after the induction , the osteogenic differentiation of beagle bmscs was activated successfully .
nine and 11 proteins were found to be down - and up - regulated by rhbmp - 2 , respectively .
the increase in lim and sh3 domain protein 1 ( lasp1 ) and the decrease in ferritin were verified by real - time pcr and western blotting analyses .
conclusions among the 20 rhbmp - 2 - regulated factors , there is empirical evidence supporting the involvement of lasp1 and ferritin in osteogenic differentiation .
lasp1 plays an important role in the regulation of the activity of the cytoskeleton , and ferritin is an important molecule in cellular iron homeostasis .
further studies focused on these 20 proteins will help elucidate the molecular mechanism ( s ) through which rhbmp - 2 induces osteogenic differentiation of bmscs .
bmscs osteogenic differentiation rhbmp - 2 proteomics introduction the repair of large segmental bone defects caused by trauma or disease is a very difficult process in orthopedic clinics .
sources of autologous bone grafts are limited and allogeneic grafts may be rejected and might induce infection .
the effect of artificial bone products for this purpose is still uncertain .
thus , the use of autologous bone marrow stem cells ( bmscs ) to build / repair bone tissue and to treat bone defects has been proposed as a new treatment option in recent years .
bmscs are a subset of non - hematopoietic bone marrow stromal cells .
they are easy to obtain and culture , and can be amplified in vitro and transformed to multi - line ages without loss of genetic stability [ 1 ] .
bmscs have a multi - potent differentiation potential in vitro under certain conditions .
bmscs can differentiate into adipocytes , osteoblasts , chondrocytes , and vascular smooth muscle , skeletal muscle , heart , endothelial , nerve , and liver cells , among others [ 2 ] .
thus , bmscs have become the most promising seed cells for bone tissue engineering [ 3 ] .
bone morphogenetic proteins ( bmps ) are bone growth factors that are known to induce osteogenesis [ 3 ] .
these growth factors themselves are sufficient to induce bone formation [ 3 ] .
under certain conditions , they can induce undifferentiated mesenchymal cells to transform to bone cells and promote the proliferation of bone cells [ 3 ] .
bmps are currently considered the most important factor in osteogenesis [ 4,5 ] .
the effect of recombinant human bmp - 2 ( rhbmp - 2 ) on osteogenic differentiation of bmscs is well - studied , and rhbmp - 2 has already been applied widely in animal experiments and clinical applications [ 2 ] .
in previous studies , we have also tested the utility of tissue - engineered bone containing rhbmp - 2 and bmscs in repairing bone defects in rabbits [ 6,7 ] .
however , the molecular mechanisms of bmp - 2 - induced osteogenic differentiation are currently not known .
the source of bmsc specimens are mainly mice , rats , and humans .
human bmscs are in limited supply and it is difficult to carry out studies with human bmscs .
bmscs from mice or rats are quite different from human bmscs in physiology .
beagle is considered an ideal large animal model widely used in pre - clinical toxicological experiments , basic medical research , radiation sickness treatment , and experimental surgery .
therefore , in this study , we established a model for bmsc primary cell culture and rhbmp - 2 - induced osteogenic differentiation using beagle dogs .
proteomic analysis was used to identify proteins regulated by rhbmp - 2 .
the results provide an improved understanding of the rhbmp - 2 - induced osteogenic differentiation of bmscs .
material and methods culture and induction of differentiation of bmscs according to standard bone marrow puncture procedures , 5 to 10 ml of bone marrow was aspirated from the posterior superior iliac spine of beagles .
heparin was added to the bone marrows to block coagulation and then the marrows were diluted with an equal volume of phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) .
the diluted bone marrows were layered onto lymphocyte separation medium ( sigma - aldrich ) at a ratio of 2:1 , followed by centrifugation at 400 x g for 30 min .
after centrifugation , the white layer between the two layers generated after centrifugation was collected and washed twice with pbs .
cells were seeded in culture plates at a density of 1 x 106 cells / well and cultured in dulbecco 's modified eagle medium ( dmem ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum , 100 u / ml penicillin , and 100 u / ml streptomycin at 37degreesc in an atmosphere of 5 % co2 and 95 % humidity .
after 72 h of incubation , the culture medium was changed once every 3 days .
at the third generation , cells were trypsinized , and 3 x 106 cells were plated in 100 mm culture dishes .
the cells were stimulated with 20 mg / l rhbmp - 2 ( hangzhou jiuyuan gene engineering co. , ltd. , china ) for one week , and the medium was changed once every three days .
the morphology of the cells was observed everyday using an inverted phase - contrast microscope ( ix81 ; olympus , japan ) .
all protocols were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee ( iacuc ) at southern medical university ( approval no. 120333 , 114522 ) .
gomori alkaline phosphatase staining gomori alkaline phosphatase staining was performed on cultured bmscs as per the instructions of bcip / nbt chromogenic alkaline phosphatase staining kit ( beyotime , china ) .
after fixation , cells were washed with pbs three times , the bcip / nbt staining working solution was added , and the cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min .
the bcip / nbt staining working solution were then removed , and the cells were washed twice with distilled water to terminate the color reaction .
the cells were observed and photographed using an inverted phase - contrast microscope ( ix81 ; olympus , japan ) .
two - dimensional ( 2d ) gel electrophoresis dry cells ( 100 mg ) were lysed by adding 400 mul of lysis buffer ( 8 m urea , 4 % chaps , 0.48 % tris base , 40 mm dtt , and 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) .
the lysis mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 60 min at 4degreesc .
after centrifugation , the supernatant was collected and quantified with a 2d quant protein assay kit ( ge , usa ) .
the supernatant containing 300 mug of total cellular protein ( about 20 mul ) was mixed with the sample buffer ( 7 m urea , 2 m thiourea , 4 % chaps , 65 mm dtt , 0.2 % ampholytes , and a small amount of bromophenol blue ) to a final volume of 450 mul .
two - dimensional gel electrophoresis ( 2 - de ) was performed mainly according to the method described in a previous report [ 8 ] using a 24 - cm ph4 - 7 linear drystrip ( ge , usa ) .
after rehydration , is oelectric focusing ( highest current set at 50 mua / gel , 20degreesc ) and sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) was performed .
after electrophoresis , mass spectrometry - compatible silver staining was applied [ 9 ] .
the gel was scanned using a umax power look 1100 transmission scanner to obtain images , and the images were analyzed with pdquest 7.1.0 software .
the analysis included the detection of protein spots , quantification , background removal , and cross - gel analysis .
after comparison of the two gels , protein spots corresponding to a difference in expression greater than 2.5 times were selected for matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization - time - of flight ( maldi - tof ) mass spectrometry .
in - gel digestion and maldi - tof mass spectrometry the protein spots were excised from gels into 1 - 2 mm2 blocks .
after in - gel digestion , maldi - tof - tof mass spectrometry was carried out using an abi4700 ( applied biosystems , usa ) system .
the obtained data were analyzed with the pmf mascot database ( http :// www.matrixscience.com /) .
the parameters used were : species , mammal ; trypsin digestion ( the number of maximum missed cleavages was set to 1 ) ; carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification ; and mass error , 100 ppm .
real - time quantitative pcr the rna extracted from bmscs ( 1 mug ) was first reverse - transcribed into cdna ( primescript ; takara , china ) .
the cdna was then used as the template for real - time quantitative pcr analysis ( maxima sybr green / rox qpcr master mix ; thermo scientific , pittsburgh , pa ) .
the primers for quantifying the mrna expression of lim and sh3 domain protein 1 ( lasp1 ) , ferritin light and heavy chains , and glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( gapdh ) , which served as the internal control , are listed below ( table 1 ) .
the average deltadeltact of lasp1 , ferritin light and heavy chains , and gapdh from samples analyzed in triplicate was calculated [ 10,11 ] .

the expression level of lasp1 and ferritin light and heavy chains in bmsc lysates were analyzed by western blotting .
the protein concentration of cell lysates was examined before resolving the total cellular protein ( 50 mug / lane ) using sds - page .
the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and the membranes were then blocked using 5 % skim non - fat milk in tris - buffered saline ( tbs ) .
the membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies specific for lasp1 ( ab117806 ; abcam , usa ) , ferritin light chain ( ab69090 ; abcam , usa ) , and ferritin heavy chain ( ab65080 ; abcam , usa ) .
the membranes were washed three times in tbs containing 0.1 % tween 20 and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies .
the protein - antibody complexes were detected using a chemiluminescence reagent kit ( ecl ; pierce bio , usa ) .
the protein - specific bands were analyzed by semi - quantitative densitometry .
statistical analysis the data obtained from real - time quantitative pcr and the density of protein bands from western blotting analysis were analyzed with spss12.0 software ( spss inc. , chicago , il ) .
the data shown are the mean +/ - sd. the comparison of quantitative data was carried out using independent sample t - test and a value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .
results rhbmp - induced osteogenesis in bmscs the bmscs were cultured and treated with rhbmp - 2 as described in materials and methods .
the cell morphology was analyzed by observation under a microscope .
the non - induced cells were short , with spindle - like fusiform shapes .
at day 7 of culture , the number of cells increased , the size of the cells enlarged , and the cells became elongated ( figure 1a , control ) .
during continued culture , the cells remained long and spindle - shaped .
after induction with rhbmp - 2 , the shapes of the bmscs began changing gradually .
seven days after induction , the cell morphology drastically changed from long spindle - like cells to cubic cells ( figure 1a , bmp - 2 ) .
the osteogenesis potential of rhbmp - 2 - induced bmscs was evaluated by staining for alkaline phosphatase activity , a marker for ostoeblastic differentiation .
when bmscs were treated with rhbmp - 2 for 7 days , a lot of dark blue dots appeared , indicating the presence of alkaline phosphatase activity ( figure 1b , bmp - 2 ) .
in bmscs that had not been treated with rhbmp - 2 , only a few alkaline phosphatase spots were detected ( figure 1b , control ) .
these results show that bmscs from beagles can be successfully cultured and that osteogenes can be induced by treatment with rhbmp - 2 .

two - dimensional gel electrophoresis the protein extracts from non - induced and rhbmp - 2 induced bmscs were examined by two - dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining .
the images of the silver - stained gels were clear and without background interference ( figure 2a , control and bmp - 2 ) .
the protein spots were completely separated and similar results were obtained in all three independent trials of the experiment .
an average of 1125 protein spots could be identified in the gel images from the three independent trials .
the matching protein spots in the gels corresponding to the control ( non - induced ) and rhbmp - 2 - treated samples were considered to originate from the same proteins .
the results showed that the percentage of matched proteins from the two groups of cells was approximately 90.84 % .

protein number 4 , lasp1 ; number 11 and 12 , ferritin light and heavy chains .
after manual comparison and pdquest 7.1.0 software analysis of the protein spots , 20 proteins with significant differences of expression levels between the control and induced cells were selected for further analysis .
the differences were categorized as proteins that were up - or down - regulated by 2 times or more , and proteins that were either down - regulated ( 9 proteins ) or up - regulated ( 11 proteins ) in the bmp - 2 - induced cells were analyzed further by maldi - tof mass spectrometry for protein identification ( table 2 ) .
the proteins numbered as 4 , 11 , and 12 in table 2 were identified as lasp1 isoform 2 , ferritin light chain , and ferritin heavy chain ( figure 2b and c , marked by red arrows ) .
mass spectrometry peptide fingerprint peaks of these three proteins are shown in figure 3a - c , respectively .
the expression of the mrnas corresponding to these three proteins in control and bmp - 2 - treated cells was examined by real - time quantitative pcr .
compared with the expression levels in the control cells , the expression of lasp1 decreased , while that of ferritin light and heavy chains increased , in the rhbmp - 2 - induced cells ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 4a ) .
the expression levels of these three proteins in the non - induced and induced cells were also examined by western blotting .
consistent with the expression data for the mrna , lasp1 protein levels were higher in control cells , while the levels of ferritin light and heavy chains was higher in the bmp - 2 - treated cells ( figure 4b ) .
densitometric analysis of protein bands from the western blots also indicated the same pattern of expression as that from the real - time quantitative pcr analysis of mrna expression ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 4b ) .

discussion in this study , beagle bmscs were successfully isolated and cultured .
the bmscs were stimulated with rhbmp - 2 to induce osteogenic differentiation .
after 7 days of stimulation , osteogenic differentiation of bmscs was seen , confirmed by the morphological changes in bmscs and the appearance of alkaline phosphatase activity , a marker for osteoblastic differentiation .
the protein expression profiles of untreated control and rhbmp - 2 - treated bmscs were characterized using 2d gel electrophoresis .
comparison of the two protein expression profiles indicated that 9 proteins were up - regulated and 11 proteins were down - regulated after stimulation of bmscs with rhbmp - 2 .
based on previously published reports and bioinformatics analysis , two proteins , lasp1 and ferritin ( light and heavy chains ) , were selected for further analysis as candidate proteins involved in osteogenic differentiation induced by bmp - 2 .
the results from real - time quantitative pcr and western blotting analyses confirmed the down - regulation of lasp1 and the up - regulation of ferritin in rhbmp - 2 - induced bmscs .
lasp1 protein contains one lim , one sh3 , and two actin domains , and was first discovered in 1996 as a protein that is over - expressed in breast cancer [ 12 ] .
studies about lasp1 have almost all concentrated on lasp1 expression in tumors .
lasp1 is involved in regulating cellular functions associated with actin - cytoskeleton - associated membrane rearrangements [ 13 - 15 ] .
one study showed that aberrant expression of lasp1 can affect the formation of cartilage tissue [ 16 ] .
to our knowledge , ours is the first study demonstrating a decrease in lasp1 expression during the process of rhbmp - 2 - induced osteogenic differentiation .
ferritin is an important molecule in iron homeostasis in cells [ 17 ] .
iron overload can inhibit osteoblast differentiation and induce ferritin expression .
iron - provoked inhibition of osteoblast activity is mediated by ferritin and its ferroxidase activity [ 18 ] .
we found that the expression of ferritin light and heavy chains was increased in bmscs after induction of differentiation by rhbmp - 2 .
the possible role for the up - regulation of ferritin might be that when stem cells in bone marrow are stimulated by rhbmp - 2 , over - expression of ferritin causes the enrichment of iron , thereby inhibiting osteogenic differentiation .
however , the concentration of iron ions in the culture medium is maintained at steady levels , hence osteogenic differentiation is not inhibited under in vitro culture conditions , even though ferritin expressed is increased upon stimulation with rhbmp - 2 .
the extent and exact mechanism ( s ) through which the expression of lasp1 and ferritin are altered upon stimulation with bmp - 2 need to be addressed in further mechanistic studies of osteogenic differentiation of bmscs .
in summary , rhbmp - 2 induces osteogenic differentiation of bmscs , decreases lasp1 expression , and increases ferritin expression .
lasp1 is a key factor involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and ferritin controls cellular iron homeostasis , and the expression changes in these proteins likely play an important role in the process of rhbmp - 2 - induced osteogenic differentiation .
the results of this study provide additional information regarding the role of changes in expression of specific proteins in driving bmp - 2 - induced osteogenic differentiation and indicate the need for further studies to elucidate the specific mechanism ( s ) through which bmp - 2 promotes differentiation of bmscs .

background the importance of pelvic incidence - lumbar lordosis ( pi - ll : pi minus ll ) mismatch is emphasized in long - segment fusion for adult spinal deformity ; however , there are few studies evaluating the influence of pi - ll on surgical outcomes after short - segment fusion .
in this study , we have examined the effects of pi - ll mismatch on surgical outcomes of short - segment lumbar intervertebral fusion for lumbar degenerative diseases .
methods patients with lumbar degenerative disease treated by short - segment ( 1 or 2 levels ) transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion were divided into group a ( pi - ll <= 10degrees : n = 22 ) and group b ( pi - ll >= 11degrees : n = 30 ) .
pre - and post - operative patient symptoms were assessed by the visual analogue scale ( vas : scores 0 - 100 mm ; for lbp , lower - extremity pain , and lower - extremity numbness ) , a detailed vas for lbp while in motion , standing , and sitting , and the oswestry disability index ( odi ) .
surgical outcomes were evaluated by the nakai score ( 3 = excellent to 0 = poor .
post - operative data were acquired for at least one year following surgery and were compared between the two groups .
multiple regression analyses were used to evaluate the relative influence of pi - ll on each pre - and post - operative parameter ( vas , detailed vas and odi ) adjusted for age , sex , fusion levels , body mass index , presence of scoliosis , diabetes mellitus and depression .
results the surgical outcomes in group a were significantly better than those of group b. group a showed better post - operative vas scores for lbp , particularly lbp while standing ( 11.9 vs. 25.8 ) .
the results of the multivariate analyses showed no significant correlation between pi - ll and pre - operative symptoms , but did show a significant correlation between pi - ll and the post - operative vas score for lbp , lower extremity pain , and numbness .
conclusions this study is the first to find that pi - ll mismatch influences post - operative residual symptoms , such as lbp , lower extremity pain and numbness .
among the three types of lbp examined in the detailed vas , lbp while standing was most strongly related to pi - ll mismatch .
the importance of maintaining spinopelvic alignment is emphasized , particularly when treating patients with adult spinal deformity using long - segment fusion surgery .
however , our results indicate that surgeons should pay attention to sagittal spinopelvic alignment and avoid post - operative pi - ll mismatch even when treating patients with short - segment lumbar interbody fusion .
keywords sagittal alignment spinopelvic flat - back pelvic incidence lumbar lordosis lumbar interbody fusion issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion ( tlif ) is commonly used to treat patients with lumbar degenerative disease [ 1 ] .
tlif offers the advantage of obtaining a circumferential arthrodesis through a unilateral approach with minimal retraction of neural elements .
many surgeons have reported good clinical and radiological outcomes for such lumbar interbody fusion techniques .
[ 2 - 5 ] however , there are some patients who have post - operative residual , lower extremity pain , or numbness even without post - operative complications [ 2 - 5 ] .
loss of lordosis has been thought to be one of the factors influencing post - operative residual symptoms [ 6 , 7 ] .
in 2010 , schwab et al. , reported the importance of maintaining global sagittal alignment when performing long - segment spinal fusion surgery in the treatment of adult spinal deformity [ 8 ] .
their results clearly showed that post - operative global sagittal balance is significantly correlated with post - operative residual pain and disability [ 8 ] .
radiological parameters that most highly correlate with pain and disability are sagittal vertical axis ( sva ) , pelvic tilt ( pt ) , and the balance of pelvic incidence ( pi ) and lumbar lordosis ( ll ) [ 9 ] .
schwab et al. proposed radiological parameter thresholds predictive of worse clinical symptoms and poorer quality of life , and concluded that a pi - ll ( pi minus ll ) of 10degrees or less was the ideal spinopelvic alignment for reducing post - operative pain and disability [ 9 ] .
therefore , surgeons should plan corrective surgeries to acquire an adequate ll that achieves a harmonious spinopelvic alignment ( pi - ll 10degrees or less ) .
in previous studies [ 8 - 10 ] , the importance of maintaining appropriate pi - ll has been emphasized , particularly for long - segment fusion for adult spinal deformity ; however , there are few studies evaluating the influence of pi - ll on surgical outcomes following short - segment fusion .
in this study , we examined the effect of pi - ll mismatch on surgical outcomes of short - segment tlif for lumbar degenerative diseases .
methods patients with lumbar degenerative diseases , such as lumbar spinal stenosis , degenerative spondylolisthesis and spondylolytic spondylolisthesis , treated by short - segment 1 or 2 level tlif were included in the present study ( table 1 ) .
patients who showed any indication of other pathological problems , such as vertebral fractures , tumors , or infectious diseases , were excluded .
fifty - two consecutive patients meeting the criteria were divided into group a ( pi - ll <= 10degrees : n = 22 ) and group b ( pi - ll >= 11degrees ; n = 30 ) by post - operative radiological evaluation .
table 1 fusion levels and indications for fusion in groups a and b group a ( n = 22 ) group b ( n = 30 ) number of fusion levels 1.1 +/ - 0.4 1.4 +/ - 0.5a level of fusion ( no. of cases ) one level l3 - l4 0 1 l4 - l5 16 12 l5 - s1 4 5 two levels l3 - l4 - l5 1 9 l4 - l5 - s1 1 3 indications for fusion degenerative spondylolisthesis 14 19 spondylolytic spondylolisthesis 2 1 spinal canal stenosis 6 10 astatistically significant difference p < 0.05 pre - operative characteristics of patients , including age , sex , number of fusion levels , body mass index ( bmi ) , and incidence of degenerative scoliosis , diabetes mellitus , and depression , were compared between the two groups .
anteroposterior and lateral radiographs in the neutral standing position were taken pre - and post - operatively .
on anteroposterior radiographs , pre - operative scoliotic curvature was evaluated using the cobb method .
on lateral radiographs , pi and ll were evaluated one - year after surgery .
the pi is measured as the angle between a line drawn perpendicular to the sacral end plate at its midpoint and a line drawn from the midpoint of the sacral end plate to the midpoint of the femoral head axis .
the ll is the sagittal cobb angle measured between the superior end plate of l1 and the superior end plate of s1 [ 8 ] .
post - operative parameters , such as pi , ll , and pi - ll , were then compared between the two groups .
excellent inter - and intra - rater reliability has been reported for these measurements [ 10 ] .
evaluation of surgical outcomes and clinical symptoms intra - and post - operative complications were retrospectively reviewed for each group .
surgical outcomes were evaluated using the nakai score ( table 2 : 3 = excellent to 0 = poor ) [ 11 ] .
pre - and post - operative patient symptoms were also assessed by the visual analogue scale ( vas : scores 0 - 100 mm ; for lbp , lower - extremity pain , and lower - extremity numbness ) and the oswestry disability index ( odi ) .
in addition , the detailed vas scoring system , originally developed by us for lbp while in motion , standing , and sitting , was used for a more detailed evaluation of lbp , pre - and post - operatively [ 12 ] .
post - operative data were prospectively acquired for at least one year following surgery .
all scores were compared between the two groups .
table 2 nakai score scoring used in the study the patient has resumed work - related and other activities with slight or no symptoms .
3 : excellent the patient has resumed work - related and other activities but occasionally feels pain in the back or lower limbs after strenuous work .
2 : good the patient has reduced work - related and other activities because of residual pain in the back or lower limbs .
1 : fair the patient cannot work or carry out activities of daily living and is considered to be disabled .
0 : poor surgical procedures all patients underwent surgery in the prone position after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia .
the side selected for the unilateral approach was the side showing more neurological involvement .
if symptoms were equal on both sides , the approach was made on the left side .
a midline incision exposed the posterior elements and the lateral aspect of the facet joint .
following ipsilateral laminotomy , partial facetectomy exposed the surface of the intervertebral disc .
resection of the bone was performed manually using an osteotome and kerrison rongeur to preserve local bone .
following the removal of disc material and meticulous endplate preparation , the resected local bone was milled and packed into the intervertebral disc space as a bone graft .
one or two fusion cages packed with milled local bone were then inserted into the disc space .
contralateral decompression was performed if needed ; the contralateral ligamentum flavum , ventral aspect of the lamina , and medial aspect of the contralateral facet joints were resected through the ipsilateral side .
following neural decompression , pedicle screws were placed on both sides .
a 1 - cm fascia incision allowed insertion of pedicle screws transfascially , using a percutaneous pedicle screw system .
adequate compressive force by the pedicle screws was applied to the disc space to establish stability of the fusion cages .
the percutaneus pedicle screws used for the patients in this series were viper ( depuy synthes spine , raynham , ma ) or mantis ( stryker , kalamazoo , mi ) .
written informed consent was obtained prior to surgery .
the study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee of toho university sakura medical center ( no. 2012 - 071 ) .
statistical analysis statistical analyses used were the unpaired t - test for age , fusion levels , bmi , pi , ll , pi - ll and vas , the mann - whitney u test for the nakai score and odi , and the chi - square test for sex and incidence of each disease .
multiple regression analysis was performed to investigate the relative influences of pre - and post - operative pi - ll on each pre - and post - operative vas , detailed vas , and odi after adjustment for age , sex , fusion levels , bmi , presence of scoliosis , diabetes mellitus and depression .
pi - ll was utilized as the independent variable and pre - and post - operative data for vas and odi as the dependent variables .

no significant difference was found in pre - and post - operative vas scores for lower extremity pain and numbness between the two groups ( table 5 ) .
the odi showed no significant differences between the two groups pre - and post - operatively ( table 5 ) .
a more thorough analysis of lbp using the detailed vas scoring system revealed that both groups showed similar pre - operative levels of lbp while standing , but post - operatively , group a showed significantly less lbp while standing than group b ( p = 0.039 ) ( table 5 ) .
in both pre - and post - operative data , no significant differences were found in lbp while in motion and while sitting between the two groups ( table 5 ) .
correlation between pi - ll and post - operative symptoms a multivariate analysis was performed , adjusted for age , sex , fusion levels , bmi , presence of scoliosis , diabetes mellitus and depression , with pre - and post - operative vas and odi as dependent variables , and pi - ll as an independent variable .
the results showed no significant association between pi - ll and pre - operative parameters ( table 6 ) .
however , greater pi - ll was significantly associated with worse post - operative vas for lbp ( p = 0.045 ) , lower extremity pain ( p = 0.024 ) , and numbness ( p = 0.019 ) ( table 7 ) .
no significant association was found between pi - ll and post - operative odi ( table 7 ) .
among the detailed vas scores in the three situations , a larger pi - ll was significantly associated with worse lbp while standing ( p = 0.038 ) , but there was no significant association with lbp while in motion or sitting ( table 7 ) .

schwab et al. recently proposed a systematic evaluation method to classify sagittal spinal alignment in flat - back cases [ 8 ] .
their study demonstrated that sva , pt , and pi - ll were most closely related to lbp and disability .
since the scoliosis research society - schwab adult spinal deformity classification was established [ 10 ] , there have been no studies examining the influence of pi - ll mismatch on surgical outcomes after short - segment lumbar interbody fusion .
our study is the first to show that pi - ll mismatch significantly correlated with surgical outcomes after short - segment lumbar interbody fusion .
consequently , our study reveals that surgical outcomes after short - segment lumbar interbody fusion will be poorer when good spinopelvic balance is not achieved following surgery .
thus , surgeons should pay attention to the sagittal spinopelvic balance of patients even when treating patients with short - segment lumbar spinal stenosis or spondylolisthesis .
our results show that post - operative pi - ll mismatch causes greater residual lbp .
interestingly , in this study , our originally developed detailed vas system was successful in revealing that lbp while standing is most closely correlated with post - operative pi - ll mismatch .
patients with flat - back syndrome are usually characterized by an inability to stand erect and back pain [ 7 ] .
in our study , post - operative residual lbp while standing may reflect the inability to stand erect due to flat - back syndrome .
we believe that pi - ll did not correlate with pre - operative symptoms ( table 6 ) because pre - operative symptoms , including pain caused by nerve root compression , spinal instability , and spinopelvic alignment , are more complex than post - operative symptoms .
post - operative symptoms , particularly lbp while standing , were more simply influenced by spinopelvic alignment ( table 7 ) , because symptoms caused by nerve root compression and spinal instability may have been relieved by fusion surgery .
therefore , pi - ll significantly correlated with post - operative lbp , but not with pre - operative lbp ( tables 6 , 7 ) .
there are some limitations to this study .
most importantly , post - operative residual symptoms are affected by multiple factors .
in our study , group a showed patient characteristics that differed from those of group b. although most were not significant ( tables 1 , 3 ) , the possibility that differing characteristics influenced the results of the comparison study between group a and group b persists .
in particular , the difference in number of fusion levels may affect surgical outcomes because better surgical outcomes would be expected from single - level fusion than two - level fusion [ 13 ] .
however , the multivariate analysis adjusted for age , sex , fusion levels , bmi , presence of scoliosis , diabetes mellitus and depression showed that pi - ll was significantly associated with post - operative symptoms , not with pre - operative symptoms .
these results lead us to conclude that post - operative pi - ll mismatch causes more intense post - operative residual symptoms , particularly lbp while standing .
there are other limitations , including the short post - operative follow - up and small number of patients , and the variety of pathologies that were indicators for fusion surgery in the study .
there is a concern that short - term outcomes may be influenced by surgery - related factors , rather than radiologic factors .
however , in our study no patients with surgical complication had deleterious consequences from the complication after additional treatments , such as screw reposition , hematoma removal , or dural suture were accomplished .
recent studies reported that a post - operative pi - ll mismatch resulted in increased load on adjacent segments and predisposition to adjacent segment pathologies and late surgical complications seen after longer follow - ups [ 14 - 17 ] .
thus , longer follow - up times may reveal an effect of adjacent segment pathology or late surgical complications on surgical outcomes .
however , the statistically significant differences found between our two study groups , despite the small number of subjects , lead us to believe our results are reliable and provide important information for spine surgeons treating lumbar degenerative disease .
further investigations in which inclusion criteria are stricter with a longer follow - up and larger number of subjects are needed to confirm our conclusions .
in this study , we did not examine the effects of correcting ll on surgical outcomes because the surgery in this series was not intended to correct ll. therefore , we cannot conclude that the surgical correction of ll would have a favorable effect on surgical outcomes .
however , there have been several studies showing the positive effects of improving sagittal spinopelvic alignment on surgical outcomes of short - segment fusion surgery .
kim et al. found that patients with improved pt after posterior lumbar interbody fusion ( plif ) had better clinical results [ 18 ] .
lazennec et al. reported that a larger post - operative pt positively correlated with lbp after lumbosacral fusion surgery [ 19 ] .
a larger pt , which reflects pelvic retroversion , is usually correlated with loss of ll [ 20 ] ; therefore , we surmise that the surgical correction of ll decreases pt and produces improved surgical outcomes .
hioki et al. found that two - level plif provided satisfactory results by preserving lordosis of the lumbar spine , suggesting the importance of restoring ll by fusion surgery [ 21 ] .
however , lazennec et al. reported that post - operative loss of lordosis was not always related to post - operative residual symptoms [ 19 ] .
one explanation for this inconsistency may be that the appropriate ll varies depending on a patient 's pi. these findings indicate the importance of acquiring ideal pi - ll when performing short - segment lumbar fusion .
more recently , kim et al. reported that tlif has the potential to cause post - operative flat back , and that plif is more reliable than tlif for restoring spinopelvic alignment [ 22 ] .
for the maintenance of segmental lumbar lordosis , extreme lateral interbody fusion ( xlif ) is thought to have more capability to increase disc height and correct spinopelvic alignment [ 23 - 25 ]. from these observations , surgeons can select the appropriate surgical technique from the various fusion methods , tlif , plif , xlif , multi - segment fusion , spinal osteotomy , etc. , taking into consideration the ability of each method to restore spinopelvic alignment .
efforts should be made to reduce pi - ll to 10degrees or less whenever feasible .
conclusions this study is the first to report that pi - ll influences post - operative residual symptoms after short - segment fusion for lumbar degenerative disease .
pi - ll mismatch is more closely related to lbp while standing than lbp while in motion or sitting. from these observations , surgeons should be careful to achieve sagittal spinopelvic alignment and avoid post - operative pi - ll mismatch when treating patients with short - segment lumbar interbody fusion , particularly when the patient has severe lbp while standing .

calpains are calcium regulated cysteine proteases that have been described in a wide range of cellular processes , including apoptosis , migration and cell cycle regulation .
in addition , calpains have been implicated in differentiation , but their impact on neural differentiation requires further investigation .
here , we addressed the role of calpain 1 and calpain 2 in neural stem cell ( nsc ) self - renewal and differentiation .
we found that calpain inhibition using either the chemical inhibitor calpeptin or the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin favored differentiation of nscs .
this effect was associated with significant changes in cell cycle - related proteins and may be regulated by calcium .
interestingly , calpain 1 and calpain 2 were found to play distinct roles in nsc fate decision .
calpain 1 expression levels were higher in self - renewing nsc and decreased with differentiation , while calpain 2 increased throughout differentiation .
in addition , calpain 1 silencing resulted in increased levels of both neuronal and glial markers , beta - iii tubulin and glial fibrillary acidic protein ( gfap ) .
calpain 2 silencing elicited decreased levels of gfap .
these results support a role for calpain 1 in repressing differentiation , thus maintaining a proliferative nsc pool , and suggest that calpain 2 is involved in glial differentiation .
introduction differentiation is the process by which stem cells give rise to committed and specialized cells [ 1 ] .
stem cells have been successfully used in regenerative medicine [ 2 ],[ 3 ] .
nevertheless , the potential of stem cells is yet far from being fully explored and requires a better understanding of stem cell biology .
neural stem cells ( nsc ) have the ability to proliferate and self - renew , as well as to differentiate , following induction , into several neural cell types , including neurons , oligodendrocytes and glial cells [ 4 ] - [ 6 ] .
although thoroughly studied , the molecular pathways regulating differentiation of stem cells are still not fully defined , and may implicate cell cycle , apoptosis and migration , among other processes .
calpains are a large conserved family of cysteine proteases regulated by calcium which cleave many different substrates , modulating protein activity [ 7 ] .
calpains have been implicated in the regulation of a wide range of cellular processes , including cell cycle , migration , apoptosis , autophagy and synaptic plasticity [ 8 ] - [ 14 ] .
calpain activity can be modulated by calcium and phospholipid binding , phosphorylation , autolysis and subcellular localization [ 7 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .
additionally , calpains are regulated by the specific endogenous inhibitor calpastatin [ 17 ] .
unlike other proteases , calpains do not have a consensus substrate - binding or cleavage site , making it difficult to predict their possible substrates .
in fact , substrates cleaved by different calpains vary depending on the context , probably as a consequence of the complex regulatory network affecting these proteases .
calpain 1 and calpain 2 are the most studied and abundant calpain molecules in the brain [ 8 ] .
although calpains have several important physiological functions , most of the studies involving these proteases in the central nervous system are disease - related .
in fact , calpains have been implicated in several brain pathologies , such as parkinson 's disease , alzheimer 's disease , huntington 's disease , stroke and brain trauma [ 8 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
the importance of calpains in synaptic function and memory formation has also been studied [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
several studies have implicated calpains in differentiation mechanisms , including differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells , such as myoblasts , osteoblasts , chondrocytes and adipocytes [ 20 ] .
a role for cysteine proteases in differentiation of embryonic stem cells into neural cells has also been reported , although the involvement of calpains in embryonic stem cell differentiation was argued against [ 21 ] .
nevertheless , neural progenitor cells exhibit calcium transients during cell cycle progression that are required for proliferation in cellular models [ 22 ] .
in addition , mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) and phosphatidylinositol - 3 kinase ( pi3k )/ akt are major signaling pathways implicated in a wide range of cellular processes [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , including neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation [ 25 ] - [ 29 ] .
these pathways have previously been implicated in regulation of calpain activity [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
interestingly , calpain and calpastatin activities are modulated during neural differentiation of rat pheochromocytoma ( pc12 ) cells [ 32 ] - [ 34 ] .
altered expressions levels for both calpain and calpastatin proteins were also described during human neuroblastoma cell differentiation to schwann and neuronal cells [ 35 ] .
nevertheless , the potential function of calpains during neural differentiation is still poorly understood and requires further investigation .
in the present study , we elucidated the role of calpain 1 and 2 during nsc self - renewal and differentiation .
our results suggest that calpain 1 maintains stemness and represses neural differentiation .
in addition , calpain 2 acts as potential modulator of gliogenesis .
these results underscore the distinct regulatory functions of calpain 1 and 2 in nsc fate decision .
results calpain inhibition decreases proliferation of neural stem cells although calpains have already been implicated in several differentiation systems [ 20 ] , [ 32 ] - [ 34 ] , their involvement during neural differentiation has not yet been fully explored .
we have previously shown that cysteine proteases , such as caspases , regulate mouse nsc differentiation by interfering with the foxo3a / id1 signaling pathway [ 36 ] .
to address the role of calpains in nsc self - renewal and differentiation , we first incubated ns - tgfp cells with the calpain chemical inhibitor calpeptin in permissive condition medium .
this specific condition maintains cells in a proliferative status , although low levels of differentiation can be observed after a few days in culture .
after 24 h , cells were treated with 50 microm calpeptin or dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ; control ) and incubated for additional 6 , 9 or 27 h. our results show that calpeptin treatment resulted in a marked decrease in cell number , eliciting almost 50 % reduction in cell density at 27 h ( p < 0.01 ) ( figure 1a ) .
however , this did not correlate with increased cell death , as measured by propidium iodide ( pi ) and annexin - v staining , indicating low levels of toxicity ( figure 1b ) .
bromodeoxyuridine ( brdu ) incorporation , in turn , revealed a 25 % decrease in proliferation after calpeptin treatment , as assessed by immunocytochemistry ( figure 1c ) and flow cytometry ( figure 1d ) analysis ( p < 0.01 ) .

ns - tgfp cells were cultured in permissive conditions and treated with either 50 microm calpeptin or dmso ( control ) , and brdu was added 3 h later as described in materials and methods . ( a ) cell density was accessed at different times after treatment and calculated as the number of live cells per cm2 dish surface area .

to investigate whether inhibition of proliferation by calpains was due to altered cell cycle dynamics , we investigated the expression levels of several cell cycle markers .
interestingly , truncated p27 was decreased after calpeptin treatment of ns - tgfp cells ( figure 2 ) .
truncation of cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor p27 results in a substantial reduction in its inhibitory activity [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
in addition , calpain inhibition increased p21 and decreased cyclin e levels , indicative of impaired g1 progression in these conditions [ 39 ] .
our results suggest that calpain activity is involved in cell cycle progression and proliferation of nsc .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0033468.g002 figure 2 calpeptin treatment modulates cell cycle proteins .

calpain inhibition increases differentiation of nsc cell cycle dynamics can influence differentiation , including neurogenesis [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .
we next investigated the differentiation status of calpeptin - treated ns - tgfp cells .
interestingly , calpeptin treatment decreased the proportion of nestin - positive cells by ~ 35 % ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 3a ) , while increasing the percentage of beta - iii tubulin - positive by almost 90 % ( p < 0.001 ) ( figure 3b ) , indicating loss of stemness and induction of neural differentiation , respectively .
similar results were obtained in a mouse neurosphere model ( mnsc ) .
calpeptin - treated mnsc showed a 15 % decrease in the proportion of nestin - positive cells ( p < 0.05 ) and a 45 % increase in the percentage of beta - iii tubulin - positive cells ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 3c ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0033468.g003 figure 3 calpeptin treatment decreases nestin - and increases beta - iii tubulin - positive cells .
ns - tgfp cells and mnsc were cultured in permissive or differentiation conditions , respectively , treated with either 50 microm calpeptin or dmso ( control ) , and collected after 24 or 48 h as described in materials and methods . cells were subsequently labeled for nestin and beta - iii tubulin detection by flow cytometry as described in materials and methods .

we next sought to determine if any of the mapk and pi3k / akt pathways regulated calpain activity in nsc and if their inhibition mimicked the effects observed after calpain inhibition by calpeptin .
ns - tgfp cells were treated with p38 , extracellular signal - regulated kinase mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mek / erk ) and pi3k / akt chemical inhibitors ( sb203580 , pd98059 and wortmannin , respectively ) , and the differentiation status was evaluated after 24 h ( figure 4a and b ) .
surprisingly , no significant differences were seen in the percentage of nestin - or beta - iii tubulin - positive cells , as compared to the control , indicating that , in these conditions , neither the mapk p38 or mek / erk pathways , nor the pi3k / akt pathway are involved in the calpain - mediated regulation of self - renewal and differentiation of nsc .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0033468.g004 figure 4 inhibition of calcium flux decreases nestin - and increases beta - iii tubulin - positive cells .
ns - tgfp cells were cultured in permissive conditions and treated with either 10 microm sb203580 , 20 microm pd98059 , 250 nm wortmannin , 20 microm nifedipine , 10 microm dantrolene , 1 microm xestospongin c or dmso ( control ) , and collected after 24 h. cells were subsequently labeled for nestin and beta - iii tubulin detection by flow cytometry as described in materials and methods . ( a ) quantification of nestin - positive cells in ns - tgfp cells after different treatments .
( b ) quantification of beta - iii tubulin - positice cells .
data represent mean +/ - sem of at least three independent experiments .
sp < 0.05 , * p < 0.01 and + p < 0.001 from respective control .
we have also treated ns - tgfp cells with several inhibitors for calcium receptor / channels , previously shown to maintain calcium oscillations in nsc [ 22 ] , namely nifedipine , an l - type channel blocker ; dantrolene , a ryanodine receptor channel antagonist ; and xestospongin c , an inositol trisphosphate receptor ( ip3r ) inhibitor .
interestingly , while dantrolene elicited no significant alterations , both nifedipine and xestospongin c treatment resulted in differences similar to calpeptin treatment ( figure 4a and b ) .
in fact , nifedipine and xestospongin c induced a small , but significant decrease in the percentage of nestin - positive cells ( p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 , respectively ) , and a marked increase in the proportion of beta - iii tubulin - positive cells ( p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 , respectively ) .
thus , our results suggest that calcium oscillations mediated by ip3r and l - type channels are responsible for calpain activation , maintenance of self - renewal and repression of differentiation of nsc .
calpain inhibition throughout neural differentiation increases neurogenesis to further explore the mechanism by which calpains regulate neural differentiation , we transfected ns - tgfp cells with calpastatin , an endogenous specific calpain inhibitor [ 17 ] , and then induced neural differentiation .
cells were grown under differentiation conditions for 48 h and the expression of neuronal and glial differentiation markers beta - iii tubulin and glial fibrillary acidic protein ( gfap ) was accessed at several time - points .
as expected , both neural markers increased throughout differentiation , starting at 24 h and peaking at 48 h ( figure 5a ) .
cells developed typical neuronal and astrocytic morphologies , accompanied by the expression of beta - iii tubulin and gfap , respectively , at 2 days ( data not shown ) and 4 days in culture ( figure 5b ) .

following transfection , the flag - calpastatin construct was easily detected by western blot 24 h after induction of differentiation ( figure 6a ) .
more importantly , calpastatin overexpression increased beta - iii tubulin expression by 40 % ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 6b ) , corroborating our previous observation in calpeptin - treated nsc .
however , no differences in gfap levels were detected .
thus , our results reinforce the role of calpains in nsc fate and indicate that calpains may differently modulate neurogenesis and gliogenesis .

calpain 1 and 2 are differentially expressed throughout neural differentiation and do not correlate with cell death calpain 1 and 2 are the most abundant calpain molecules in the brain [ 8 ] , and calpastatin inhibits the activity of both proteins [ 17 ] .
we next addressed their specific contributions to neural differentiation .
curiously , expression levels of calpain 1 were markedly higher in self - renewing nsc , and decreased significantly during differentiation of ns - tgfp cells ( figure 7a ) .
in contrast , calpain 2 increased throughout differentiation in a similar manner as beta - iii tubulin and gfap .
in mnsc , beta - iii tubulin - and gfap - positive cells have previously been detected at 3 and 8 days of differentiation , respectively [ 36 ] .
accordingly , the expression patterns of both calpain 1 and 2 were similar to those found in ns - tgfp undergoing differentiation , with levels of calpain 1 decreasing as calpain 2 increased throughout neural differentiation ( figure 7b ) .
thus , our results suggest that calpain 1 and 2 have distinct functions throughout nsc differentiation .
finally , as calpains are apoptosis - associated proteases , we searched for a correlation between calpain expression and cell death throughout differentiation .
we have previously shown that differentiation of mnsc was not associated with an increase in cell death [ 41 ] .
similarly , our results reveal no significant differences in viability and cell death of differentiating ns - tgfp cells , as measured by pi and annexin - v staining ( figure 7c ) .
these results indicate that calpains may be important for the regulation of neural differentiation in a cell death - independent manner .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0033468.g007 figure 7 calpain expression levels are altered throughout differentiation of nsc .

calpain 1 represses neural differentiation , while calpain 2 increases glial differentiation to further investigate the precise roles of calpain 1 and 2 during neural differentiation , we transfected ns - tgpf cells with sirna specific for calpain 1 ( sicapn1 ) or calpain 2 ( sicapn2 ) , or unspecific control , and then induced differentiation .
reduced expression of calpain 1 and 2 was observed by western blot in cells treated with sicapn1 and sicapn2 , respectively ( figure 8a ) .
both beta - iii tubulin and gfap expression levels were ~ 25 % ( p < 0.05 ) and 50 % ( p < 0.01 ) increased after calpain 1 silencing ( figure 8b ) .
calpain 2 knockdown , in turn , elicited a significant decrease in gfap expression ( p < 0.05 ) , but no differences in beta - iii tubulin expression .
these results were corroborated by immunocytochemistry analysis ( figure 8c ) .
the opposing actions of calpain 1 and 2 on gfap expression may explain the absence of difference found earlier in gfap upon calpastatin overexpression .
thus , our results suggest that calpain 1 plays a role in cell cycle progression of nsc , delaying differentiation and maintaining a proliferative neural stem cell pool , while calpain 2 may be important for glial differentiation .

discussion the present study identifies a distinct regulatory function of calpains during nsc proliferation and differentiation in vitro .
calpain 1 represses both neuronal and glial differentiation , while calpain 2 is associated with glial differentiation .
transplantation of stem cells may provide a more permanent remedy than present drug treatments for cell replacement in various neurodegenerative diseases .
however , stem cells survive and differentiate poorly after transplantation [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] .
curiously , it has been shown that several conserved elements of apoptosis are also integral components of terminal differentiation [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] , suggesting that apoptosis - related proteins might be important players of cell fate decisions .
we have recently demonstrated the involvement of specific apoptosis - associated molecules in mouse nsc differentiation .
in fact , apoptosis - associated mirnas were involved in neural differentiation [ 41 ] , and caspase inhibition and p53 silencing synergistically delayed neural differentiation , with no evidence of apoptosis [ 36 ] .
here , we investigated the potential role of proteases such as calpains in the regulation of nsc self - renewal and differentiation .
much like caspases , calpains are cysteine proteinases that once activated cleave a wide range of cellular substrates [ 7 ] .
calpains are regulated by calcium and several studies have already demonstrated calpain involvement in differentiation systems , supporting the idea that apoptosis - associated factors are involved in regulation of the differentiation process .
in fact , it has been demonstrated that during muscle cell differentiation , calpains relocate to the cell membrane of myoblasts in response to calcium flux and participate in fusion associated protein degradation [ 46 ] , [ 47 ] .
calpains have also been implicated in osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation [ 20 ] , as well as in the turnover of transcriptional nuclear proteins driving differentiation of 3t3 - l1 preadipocytes [ 48 ] , [ 49 ] .
however , calpain activation has not always been associated with promotion of cellular differentiation .
the conversion of st - 13 preadipocytes into adipocytes was shown to be enhanced by calpain inhibition [ 20 ] .
the specific role of calpains during neural differentiation remains largely unknown and requires further investigation , as only a few studies were performed in appropriate cell models [ 32 ] - [ 35 ] .
in the present study , we first demonstrated that treatment of ns - tgfp mouse nsc with the calpain chemical inhibitor calpeptin decreases both cell number and proliferation .
our data is in accordance with other studies highlighting the importance of calpain activity in cell cycle progression , particularly in the transition from g1 to s phase [ 50 ] - [ 53 ] .
we show that inhibition of calpain activity in nsc by calpeptin leads to a significant decrease in cyclin e levels , responsible for the g1 / s transition .
the impairment of cell cycle progression induced by calpeptin was also detected by p21 accumulation and decreased p27 degradation , evidenced by the presence of a lower molecular weight truncated fragment [ 38 ] .
in fact , it has already been shown that deletion of calpain regulatory small subunit capn4 results in impaired cell cycle progression in chondrocytes .
this specific deletion led to an accumulation of certain cell cycle proteins known as calpain substrates , such as cyclin d , cyclin e , and p27 , as well as reduced phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and p27 [ 50 ] .
p27 transcription and degradation , in turn , was also shown to be mediated by calpains in other models , including osteoblasts , cortical neurons and preadipocytes [ 51 ] - [ 53 ] .
further , p21 accumulation induced by calpain inhibition has also been observed in other studies , where in vitro incubation with calpain 1 and 2 resulted in rapid degradation of p21 [ 54 ],[ 55 ] .
it has been demonstrated that calcium oscillations occurring in g1 to s transition are required for cell cycle progression in both neural progenitor and undifferentiated cells , correlating with g1 shortening and increased proliferation [ 22 ] , [ 56 ] .
furthermore , calcium oscillations increase the levels of several proliferation - associated proteins and decrease p27 - mediated inhibition [ 22 ] .
curiously , it was recently proposed that the length of g1 directly influences the differentiation rate of neural precursors [ 39 ] , [ 56 ] , [ 57 ] .
in this respect , it appears that g1 phase prolongation is both necessary and sufficient to induce switching from proliferation to differentiation in neural progenitors [ 39 ] .
therefore , it is not surprising that calpains accelerate g1 to s transition and that calpain inhibition is necessary to increase g1 length and promote neural stem cell differentiation .
consistent with this hypothesis , our results revealed that treatment of neural stem cells with calpeptin induces a significant decrease in the proportion of nestin - positive neural progenitors , while increasing the proportion of neuronal cells positive for beta - iii tubulin .
these results were also obtained in mnsc cultures , revealing that nsc differentiation induced by calpain inhibition was not restricted to the ns - tgfp cell line .
to clarify the specific signaling pathway that regulate calpain activity in nsc , ns - tgfp cells were treated with different chemical inhibitors of major signaling pathways .
our results showed that , similarly to calpeptin treatment , inhibition of calcium flux strongly influences nsc fate decision .
we tested the ip3r , l - type channel and ryanodine receptor inhibitors xestospongin c , nifedipine , and dantrolene , respectively , and observed that the first two had a significant effect in nsc differentiation , decreasing nestin and increasing beta - iii tubulin positive cells in the population .
in fact , it has already been shown that calcium oscillations in neural progenitor cells are restricted to the g1 / s transition and require calcium influx only through ip3rs , l - type channels and ryanodine receptors [ 22 ] .
since calpains are calcium - activated proteases , it is possible that calpains are regulated by calcium oscillations in g1 , thereby promoting cell cycle progression through modulation of cell cycle proteins .
to further address the role of calpains during neural differentiation , the expression levels of specific calpain 1 and 2 were investigated and found to be strikingly different throughout nsc differentiation .
in fact , while calpain 1 expression was higher during self - renewal and decreased throughout differentiation , expression of calpain 2 markedly increased during neural differentiation in both ns - tgfp and mnsc .
more importantly , fluctuations in calpain expression are not associated with cell - death signaling pathways , as no difference was detected in cell viability throughout differentiation in both cell models .
thus , our observation raises the possibility that calpain 1 and 2 differentially regulate nsc biology .
the fact that calpain 1 is mostly expressed in self - renewing nsc suggests its involvement in regulation of proliferation mechanisms .
indeed , distinct functions for both calpains have already been reported .
calpain 1 , but not calpain 2 , was shown to be present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cultured cortical neurons , being capable of degrading p27 in cell lysates [ 52 ] .
in addition , calpain 1 degraded the g1 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p19ink4d in vitro [ 58 ] , consistent with a role in the regulation of cellular self - renewal .
notably , our data validates this hypothesis by showing that calpain 1 silencing increases both neuronal and glial differentiation .
in this study , calpain 2 levels increased throughout neural differentiation , suggesting that this specific calpain plays a role later in differentiation .
accordingly , studies on pc12 neuronal differentiation have demonstrated that although calpain inhibition is important in early events of the differentiation process , calpains may be required in later stages as well [ 32 ] , [ 34 ] .
in fact , calpastatin levels declined later during differentiation in a caspase - 1 dependent manner , allowing calpain - mediated cleavage of fodrin [ 34 ] .
our results showed that calpain 2 silencing elicited a significant decrease in gfap expression during neural differentiation , while no significant differences were detected in beta - iii tubulin expression .
this finding , coupled with others showing that calpain 2 is mostly localized in glial cells , while calpain 1 is located primarily in neurons [ 52 ] , [ 59 ] , [ 60 ] , suggests that calpain 2 activity is important for glial , but not neuronal differentiation .
in fact , the inhibition of both calpains during neural differentiation by calpastatin resulted in a marked increase in beta - iii tubulin expression and no differences in gfap levels .
if calpain 1 is indeed responsible for maintaining nsc self - renewal , it would be expected that its inhibition would induce a significant increase in both beta - iii tubulin and gfap , as detected after calpain 1 silencing .
however , it is not surprising that gfap levels remained unchanged after calpastatin treatment if we consider that inhibition of calpain 2 leads to decreased gfap expression .
thus , calpain regulation of neural stem cell fate choices is apparently a complex process that may involve a tightly coordinated action of different calpains during self - renewal and differentiation stages .
collectively , our results support a role for calpain 1 in the maintenance of a proliferative neural stem cell pool , and suggest that calpain 2 is involved in the onset of glial differentiation .
further insight into the factors regulating calpain 1 and 2 activities and their specific substrates during neural differentiation is necessary to understand the complexity of calpain function in nsc fate decision .

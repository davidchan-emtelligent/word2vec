the aim of these studies was to investigate the effects of ( a ) exercise intensity and ( b ) blood glucose levels , on carbohydrate requirements to maintain stable glycaemia during exercise in individuals with t1d at basal insulin levels and to determine the glucoregulatory mechanisms underlying these effects .
nine young adults with t1d underwent euglycaemic clamps , whereby stable blood glucose levels between 4.5 to 6mmol / l were maintained during the study at basal insulin levels .
participants performed up to 40 minutes of exercise at four different exercise intensities ( 35 % , 50 % , 65 % and 80 % vo2peak ) on four separate days following a randomised counterbalanced design .
in a subsequent experiment , eight participants underwent either a euglycaemic or hyperglycaemic ( 9.5 - 10.5mmol / l ) clamp at basal insulin levels , during which they performed 40 minutes of exercise at 50 % vo2peak , on two separate days .
in both studies , glucose infusion rates ( gir ) to maintain stable glycaemia were measured during exercise , constant deuterated glucose was infused to determine glucose kinetics and blood samples were collected for the analysis of glucoregulatory hormones .
the average gir to maintain euglycaemia during exercise was 2.0 +/ - 0.9 , 4.0 +/ - 1.5 , and 4.1 +/ - 1.7g / h ( mean +/ - sem ) at 35 % , 50 % and 65 % vo2peak , respectively .
these girs were all significantly greater than that at 80 % vo2peak where no glucose was required ( p < 0.05 ) .
exercise at 80 % vo2peak was associated with a significant rise in catecholamine levels and endogenous glucose production ( p < 0.05 ) .
the average gir to maintain stable glycaemia during exercise performed during the second experiment at 50 % vo2peak was similar at euglycaemia ( 4.9 +/ - 2.1g / h ) and hyperglycaemia ( 5.5 +/ - 2.5g / h ; p > 0.05 ) .
at basal insulin levels , the relationship between exercise intensity and the amount of glucose required to prevent hypoglycaemia is not linear , with no glucose required to maintain euglycaemia during high - intensity exercise .
performing moderate - intensity exercise at euglycaemia or mild hyperglycaemia does not alter the glucose requirements to maintain stable glycaemia .

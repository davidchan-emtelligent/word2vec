aneurysm sinus of valsalva redo cardiac surgery image in medicine sinus of valsalva aneurysm is a rare anomaly , most often caused by a congenital absence of muscular and elastic tissue in the aortic wall of the sinus of valsalva .
it was first described in 1938 .
the incidence is higher in eastern than western populations .
various surgical repair techniques have been reported with good results .
in this case , a 61 years old man , with history of aortic valve replacement by mechanical starr - edwards valve forty years ago , developed an aneurysm of sinus of valsalva .
after femoro femoral cardiopulmonary bypass and sternotomy , we found a rupture in non coronary sinus , the mechanical valve is removed and a biological bentall procedure is performed .
figure 1 opening of the aneurysm of the sinus of valsalva and starting to remove the starr - edwards aortic valve , then a biological bentall procedure was performed

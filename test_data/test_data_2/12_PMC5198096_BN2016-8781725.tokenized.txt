pediatric traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) and autism spectrum disorder ( asd ) are two serious conditions that affect youth .
recent data , both preclinical and clinical , show that pediatric tbi and asd share not only similar symptoms but also some of the same biologic mechanisms that cause these symptoms .
prominent symptoms for both disorders include gastrointestinal problems , learning difficulties , seizures , and sensory processing disruption .
in this review , we highlight some of these shared mechanisms in order to discuss potential treatment options that might be applied for each condition .
we discuss potential therapeutic and pharmacologic options as well as potential novel drug targets .
furthermore , we highlight advances in understanding of brain circuitry that is being propelled by improved imaging modalities .
going forward , advanced imaging will help in diagnosis and treatment planning strategies for pediatric patients .
lessons from each field can be applied to design better and more rigorous trials that can be used to improve guidelines for pediatric patients suffering from tbi or asd .

introduction awareness about autism spectrum disorder ( asd ) has continued to increase over the past few years .
one in 110 eight year olds were on the spectrum in the united states in 2006 , which increased to one in 68 children on the spectrum in 2010 based on data collected from the autism and developmental disabilities monitoring ( addm ) network [ 1 ] .
the percentage of males affected is much higher than females with some variability between studies [ 2 ] .
although the number of patients diagnosed with autism has increased , it is unclear if this is actually due to an increased prevalence or reflective of changes in diagnostic criteria , as the physiologic changes underlying this disease are not well characterized [ 1 ] .
recent evidence suggests that cerebellar injury can contribute to autism development [ 3 ] .
other causes of asd such as obstetric complications and neonatal jaundice have also been reported in the literature but are not the focus of this paper .
interestingly , the number of reported cases for several different types of pediatric traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) has been increasing during this time period as well [ 4 ]. is it possible that moderate - to - severe tbi leads to damage that is rewiring circuits ?
what is currently known about the shared mechanisms between moderate - to - severe tbi and autism ?
can lessons from management of each be used to develop better treatment options ?
in this review , we discuss what is currently known about the shared mechanisms between moderate - to - severe pediatric tbi and asd and highlight the importance of advanced imaging to answer these important questions .
2. disorders the office of special education started collecting data for tbi as a disability category in the same year that it began collecting data for asd .
the prevalence of both asd and tbi among successive births of us school - aged children showed a marked increase in the period between 1992 and 2001 [ 5 ] .
cohort curves suggest that these two disorders exhibit similar increases in prevalence over that period .
tbi from nonaccidental head injury may lead to substantial neurological and developmental deficits .
a small study of children who suffered nonaccidental head injury ( due to intentional abrupt impact or violent shaking ) showed speech and language difficulties consistent with a diagnosis of asd [ 6 ] .
the sequelae of tbi in children include deficits in intelligence , memory , attention , learning , and social judgment [ 7 ] .
family and twin studies investigating asd show that risk is determined by genetic factors .
however , environmental insults including tbi may also contribute to risk of developing asd [ 8 ] .
changes to areas in the brain associated with communication that are observed in tbi patients have also been noted in children diagnosed with asd [ 9 ] .
ozgen and colleagues examined external morphological features in a large population sample of children with asd versus normal controls .
the results showed a high prevalence of morphological abnormalities in the patients with asd without mental retardation but did not address the cause of these abnormalities [ 8 ] .
minor anomalies and major abnormalities are common variants significantly more prevalent in children diagnosed with asd or tbi compared to normal controls [ 10 ] .
males showed a trend for more abnormalities than females .
males have increased risk of tbi , which can potentially predispose to these morphological anomalies [ 11 ] .
2.1 .
natural progression of pediatric tbi children with tbi must be identified and treated in a timely manner in order to limit secondary brain injury and improve outcomes .
initial assessment of any traumatic injury patient begins with completion of the primary survey and stabilization of potentially fatal conditions related to airway , breathing , and circulation [ 12 ] .
this is followed by a secondary survey that includes a neurological assessment [ 12 ] .
the glasgow coma scale ( gcs ) is a grading system used to assess consciousness and thus grade the severity of tbi by stratifying the sum of three tests : verbal , eye , and motor responses [ 51 ] .
the gcs describes the severity of tbi as follows : mild ( gcs 13 - 15 ) , moderate ( gcs score of 9 - 12 ) , and severe ( gcs score of 8 or less ) [ 51 ] .
since its inception , the original gcs has been modified for use in children [ 52 ] .
neurologically intact patients with a gcs of 14 or greater may be discharged home under the supervision of a responsible adult with instructions on discharge to seek immediate medical care in the event of worsening headaches or signs of neurological injury .
pediatric patients with a gcs of less than 13 should undergo a computed tomography scan to evaluate traumatic intracranial injury and be admitted [ 53 ] .
patients with an intracranial hemorrhage without significant mass effect should be admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for close monitoring .
an intracranial pressure monitor should be placed in patients with severe tbi and a poor gcs score to evaluate intracranial hypertension [ 54 ] .
intracranial hypertension reflects a sustained increase in intracranial pressure and warrants intervention .
initial management should focus on conservative measures such as optimizing head position to ensure adequate venous outflow , ensuring adequate pain control and sedation [ 12 ] .
further escalation of care would involve administering hyperosmolar therapy , mild hyperventilation , and csf diversion with a ventriculostomy drain [ 12 ] .
patients with intracranial hypertension refractory to the aforementioned therapies may benefit from a craniotomy to evacuate a hematoma or a decompressive craniectomy [ 55 ] .
surgical treatment should also be considered in patients with subdural , epidural , or intraparenchymal hematomas or posterior fossa mass lesions with associated mass effect [ 56 , 57 ] .
2.2 .
important considerations for autism children with autism display unusual responses to environmental stimuli ( e.g. , loud sounds ) , problems making friends , difficulty understanding nonverbal social cues , blunted response to pain , and a focus on geometric patterns .
the diagnosis of autism is often delayed despite the fact that parents often note concerning behavior by 18 months of age and less than 10 % of children are diagnosed at initial presentation [ 58 , 59 ] .
a qualitative impairment in social interaction and communication as well as the presence of repetitive and stereotypic actions must be present for a diagnosis of autism [ 59 ] .
patients with autism often exhibit profound anxiety and this is exacerbated in the setting of traumatic injury [ 13 ] .
strategies to reduce anxiety include social stories and the use of games for distraction , as well as using favorite drinks to disguise medications .
it is helpful to have a discussion with parents to help identify what may exacerbate or mollify anxiety in patients with autism [ 17 ] .
2.3 .
shared symptoms tbi and asd share similar deficits in neurodevelopmental abilities and social dysfunction ( table 1 ) .
because of this link in symptoms between tbi and asd , novel treatment approaches used to regain social judgment and communication skills in asd patients may be applicable to tbi patients .
in 2007 , radice - neumann and colleagues reviewed the long - term effects of tbi focusing on emotional and interpersonal relationship deficits .
following tbi , many areas of functioning are impaired : emotional decision - making , self - regulatory behavior , emotional perception difficulties , and facial affect recognition [ 13 ] .
neuroanatomical changes that occur with tbi can result in deficits of facial recognition [ 13 ] .
these are the same deficits that define asd .
this suggests that interventions , which are currently standard of practice for asd , can be incorporated into the treatment paradigm for tbi patients to increase their social function and improve quality of life .
we discuss a few of these interventions in a later section .
an impairment of language is a cardinal feature in the diagnosis of asd .
not surprisingly , neural activation during language tasks is altered following moderate - to - severe tbi in young children as well .
interestingly , genetic studies show susceptibility of certain individuals to brain injury and the subsequent impairment of language [ 60 ] .
a small feasibility study of 8 children with tbi and 12 matched controls used fmri imaging to define the network of brain region deficits following tbi [ 15 ] .
they examined differences in neural activation during a language task in children with tbi relative to a matched group of children with orthopedic injuries .
performance status on standardized language tasks as well as activation patterns in language circuitry centers allowed the researchers to make conclusions about the concise areas of brain damage .
activation was noted to differ in the patients with tbi for the right superior temporal gyrus ( ba22 ) and the right middle temporal gyrus ( ba21 ) .
the data analyzed supports that a child 's brain function differs significantly following tbi and that language task dysfunction may be reflective of differences in neuropsychological task performance [ 15 ] .
this suggests that cortical reorganization in children after tbi may be similar to the clinical presentation seen with asd .
the deficits in each may have similar neural underpinnings .
executive function relating to social skills , language , and attention is decreased in children diagnosed with asd .
studies examining deficits in executive function as it relates to location and severity of cerebral damage in children after tbi have produced mixed results [ 16 ] .
power and colleagues investigated the effects of location and severity of a lesion on executive function in early childhood tbi patients evaluating neuroimaging and clinical report measures for 36 patients .
they were able to identify functional deficits regarding inhibitory control , including self - monitoring and self - regulation .
these functional deficits were observed in all subjects with tbi , regardless of location or the site of damage [ 16 ] .
self - regulation deficits were also observed within groups for those diagnosed with asd .
additional research is necessary to further evaluate the developmental progression of children who have suffered tbi in early childhood years .
3. shared biochemical mechanisms there are several mechanisms of nervous system dysregulation present in both autism and pediatric tbi which may contribute to similar symptoms present in both diseases .
these common manifestations encompass gastrointestinal disorders , learning difficulties , seizures , and difficulties in sensory processing [ 14 ] .
further work is needed to delineate symptom manifestations between children diagnosed with asd and those experiencing tbi .
a likely reason for the difficulty in diagnosis is that both asd and tbi share similar comorbidities [ 61 ] .
because of these comorbidities , it becomes increasingly important to investigate shared mechanisms that lead to symptom manifestations .
3.1 .
gastrointestinal disorders a prominent area of ongoing research is disruption of the enteric nervous system .
asd is frequently associated with decreased viability of traditional gut microflora [ 62 ] .
the connections defining the gut - brain axis fail to form correctly in some autistic individuals [ 63 ] .
without sufficient diversity of microflora in the intestines , the brain does not receive appropriate feedback and development is hindered [ 64 ] .
in pediatric tbi , global metabolism is slowed leading to decreased survivability of microflora [ 65 ] .
the underlying cause of microflora demise is partly mediated by the release of high mobility group box 1 protein from necrotic tissue in the intestines [ 66 ] .
the release triggers a cytokine storm , which causes an inflammatory cascade [ 67 ] .
the inflammatory cascade leads to increased permeability in the intestine , which further exacerbates the microbiome disruption [ 68 ] .
to offset this sudden loss of microflora diversity , probiotic therapy has been administered with success in some individuals [ 69 ] .
future work is needed to elucidate if the microbiome is similar or different between children diagnosed with asd compared to those experiencing tbi .
3.2 .
learning difficulties it is well known that a subset of children diagnosed with asd have severe learning difficulties [ 70 ] .
the underlying cause has been postulated as a deficit in cortical plasticity mechanisms [ 18 ] .
additionally , poor communication skills limit the child from receiving adequate social feedback necessary for learning [ 71 ] .
the learning deficits in children with asd are therefore multifactorial and depend on both deficits in attention processing as well as the inability to attend to salient stimuli [ 72 ] .
at a molecular level , neuroligin deficits contribute to decreased long - term potentiation in children with asd [ 73 ] .
tbi similarly disrupts the learning cascade by increasing attention deficits [ 74 ] .
not surprisingly , working - memory processing speed in children is also slowed following tbi [ 75 ] .
the molecular process for pediatric tbi is based heavily upon the activation of secondary injury cascades following acute blood brain barrier disruption [ 76 ] .
these cascades damage neuronal tissue forcing the brain to rewire in order to compensate [ 77 ] .
how this rewiring contributes to permanent learning disability has yet to be elucidated but warrants further investigation especially in the context of asd .
3.3 .
seizures abnormal gray and white matter volume distribution is common in autism [ 19 ] .
it is likely that this disrupted development contributes to epileptic activity .
in a mouse autism model , astroglial glutamate transporter deficiency led to increased seizure activity [ 78 ] .
similarly , a downregulation of pten phosphatase triggered hyperexcitability within the temporal cortex [ 79 ] .
seizure is also common following tbi in children .
approximately 12 % of children experience seizure following moderate tbi [ 80 ] .
the use of animal models has shown that dysfunction in lipid peroxidation contributes to the generation of epileptic foci [ 81 ] .
ultimately , structural damage leads to abnormal neurological findings [ 82 ] .
in both autism and posttraumatic epilepsy , overactivation of the phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase / akt pathway contributes to cellular mutations in epileptic regions [ 83 ] .
early life seizures can cause learning disabilities throughout life [ 84 ] .
understanding the mechanics of morphologic development may aid in improving treatment options for seizure in children with autism or who experience tbi [ 85 ] .
3.4 .
sensory processing disruption for children with asd , over 90 % experience some type of sensory processing disruption [ 20 ] .
the most common are visual and auditory [ 86 ] .
the majority of these sensory disruptions are due to prolonged event - related potentials [ 87 ] .
these prolonged potentials lead to delayed stimulus response latency [ 88 ] .
mouse studies have shown that these prolonged potentials may be due to loss of mecp2 function [ 89 ] .
similarly , loss of gabrb3 gene signaling is associated with deficits in sensory processing [ 90 ] .
post - tbi changes in plasticity can also lead to sensory processing deficits [ 91 ] .
the sensory processing deficits observed following tbi are statistically different compared to the normal range seen in noninjured children [ 92 ] .
ongoing preclinical and clinical studies must be performed to determine the underlying causes of these deficits following tbi .
it is likely that the deficits are closely related to location of injury , but it has yet to be determined whether they are due to prolonged event - related potentials as seen with asd or due to another independent mechanism .
4. advanced imaging correlations 4.1 .
imaging for autism functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) has been used to determine functional connectivity for patients with asd .
glerean and colleagues found both hypo - and hyperconnectivity in the ventrotemporal - limbic subnetwork .
this system rewiring accounts for distinct connectivity differences compared to normotypical controls [ 93 ] .
additionally , diffusion - weighted mri in asd patients revealed increased anisotropy in the caudate and decreased signaling in the superior temporal pole , further supporting the idea of disconnectivity in patients with asd [ 94 ] .
similarly , anisotropy is decreased in the internal capsule , corpus callosum , and cerebellum , indicating white matter damage [ 95 ] .
not surprisingly , children with asd also have a decreased myelin water fraction [ 96 ] .
this decreased axonal water fraction may indicate axonal injury and has been linked to decreased extra - axonal diffusivity [ 97 ] .
recently , it has been shown that disruption between the subcortical region and sensory cortical centers can lead to behavior disruptions such as poor social communication , behavioral inflexibility , and atypical sensory processing [ 98 ] .
going forward , it is essential that further research be conducted to link structural differences to functional changes in behavior .
4.2 .
imaging for pediatric tbi diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) has shown that children with acute injury have decreased fractional anisotropy indicating white matter disruption similar to that seen in asd [ 99 ] .
these deficits have been linked to decreased sensory processing speeds and rewiring of circuitry [ 100 ] .
metabolomic studies have provided even further evidence of white matter disruption .
the naa / creatine and naa / choline ratios were significantly reduced in white matter tracts following injury and were associated with significant cognitive dysfunction [ 101 ] .
mri has been used to show significant atrophy of the corpus callosum after injury , but whether this atrophy is due to axonal shearing or loss of myelin integrity is unknown [ 102 ] .
magnetization transfer imaging can be used to determine changes in the myelin integrity , but its use is still experimental and warrants further investigation [ 103 ] .
similar to asd , sensory processing is a primary concern for pediatric tbi patients .
susceptibility weighted imaging ( swi ) has been used to determine the expected behavioral dysfunction , decreased social interaction , and intellectual performance that is to be expected after injury [ 104 ] .
when swi is used concurrently with dti , adequate detection of acute hemorrhage and diffuse axonal injury can be obtained [ 105 ] .
axonal injury can contribute to impaired sensory integration , which can be detected through visual and auditory exams [ 106 ] .
not surprisingly , galvin and colleagues reported that the majority of children score outside the range of typical sensory processing when administered a sensory profile following tbi [ 92 ] .
future investigation will examine how biomarkers correlate with functional changes observed on imaging and behavioral changes detected on exam .
korley and colleagues found significant serum changes of brain - derived neurotrophic factor in children with functional imaging changes following tbi indicating increased susceptibility for depression [ 107 ] .
further studies are necessary to determine if sensory processing deficits are linked to changes in mood .
5. behavioral treatment approaches 5.1 .
autism applied behavioral analysis ( aba ) is one of the most effective ways to help children with asd [ 108 ]. b. f. skinner originally targeted the application of aba to help with the verbal aspect of behavior , but over time the approach has evolved to deal with the multiple deficits seen in asd [ 109 ] .
the purpose of aba is to redirect a behavior that would be seen as unacceptable or harmful to a behavior that is something both useful and beneficial for the child with autism [ 110 ] .
it is most successful when started at a young age because it can be used to redirect negative behaviors before they become lifetime habits [ 108 ] .
aba has many adaptive arms that address specialty situations such as social awkwardness , sensory overloads , and aphasia [ 111 ] .
aba benefits from echoic learning requiring the participant to verbalize what is heard. through this process , the child builds upon repetitive intraverbalizations and over time puts emphasis on a given response to a nonverbal stimulus .
eventually , the child learns to ask for wants and needs contingent upon an extrinsic reinforcer [ 112 ] .
this progressive learning process is very important in the treatment of verbal dysfunction associated with asd but can also be applied to other behaviors such as attention and learning .
while aba is the most widely used treatment for asd , other therapy techniques are emerging [ 108 ] .
the pivotal response therapy is an early - stage intervention tactic emphasizing a response to multiple cues .
similar to aba , the older the child is at start of treatment , the harder it becomes to break habits that have already been conditioned for long periods of time [ 113 ] .
pivotal response therapy is an ongoing therapy and must be used at continuous intervals .
the main focus of pivotal therapy is to adjust how parents and children respond to the multiple environmental cues that are part of their everyday lives .
pivotal therapy is practiced when the child is in his or her natural environment rather than a clinical setting offering an advantage over traditional approaches by enhancing motivation [ 114 ] .
another frequently used treatment is verbal behavior therapy .
verbal behavior therapy focuses on improving aspects related to the quality and expression of language .
the primary goal is to help rewire connections in the brain to improve language understanding. by understanding language , the child is able to use it for effective communication [ 109 ] .
these therapies are often used in conjunction with aba to enhance child responsiveness [ 113 ] .
5.2 .
pediatric tbi because pediatric tbi produces similar deficits to those seen in asd , aba has recently been utilized to readapt children to their home environment after injury [ 115 ] .
as was the case with asd , the earlier the therapy is initiated , the more likely it will be effective [ 109 ] .
for children suffering severe tbi , the benefit of therapy is progressive and behavior can continue to improve at extended time points [ 115 ] .
aba is multidimensional and can be used to target social interactions , communication , and activities of daily living [ 21 ] .
additionally , pivotal response therapy can be used in conjunction with aba to allow the child to respond in the environmental setting that best suits him or her .
it places less stress on the child and allows for him or her to receive the proper attention that might be needed following a severe tbi [ 116 ] .
similar to aba , pivotal response therapies provide incremental stepwise improvements over time for tbi patients .
these improvements are best maintained with multitherapy treatment approaches [ 117 ] .
6. pharmacologic treatment approaches 6.1 .
autism though many theories on the origins of autism have been put forth and specific brain regions have been consistently implicated in the past decades , the etiology of autism remains largely elusive because many cases arise from a mixture of multiple environmental and genetic factors [ 118 , 119 ] .
hence , many current interventions target the secondary behavioral symptoms of autism [ 120 ] .
these targeted symptoms include insomnia , anxiety , depression , mood swings , agitation , repetitive motor behaviors , obsessive - compulsive symptoms , impulsivity , hyperactivity , aggression , and self - injurious behavior .
no medications are currently available that directly impact the core social and cognitive impairments .
6.2 .
neuroleptic agents risperidone and aripiprazole are the only two us fda - approved medications for autism and specifically for only the treatment of irritability , such as aggression , self - injurious behavior , temper tantrums , and mood swings [ 118 , 121 ] .
risperidone is approved for patients that are at least five years old .
it is an atypical antipsychotic that acts as an antagonist of both dopamine ( d2 ) and serotonin ( 5ht2a and others ) receptors [ 122 , 123 ] .
adverse events associated with risperidone use include including weight gain , increased appetite , fatigue , drowsiness , drooling , tremor , and constipation [ 118 , 124 - 127 ] .
aripiprazole is approved for ages six and up. it is also an atypical antipsychotic drug , impacting the dopamine and serotonin systems .
distinct from risperidone , which is a potent d2 antagonist , aripiprazole may act as d2 agonist , partial agonist , or antagonist depending on cellular location of d2 receptor [ 128 ] .
this theory of functional selectivity confers aripiprazole the unique ability to be a dopamine agonist where levels are too low and a dopamine antagonist where levels are too high [ 129 ] .
because of its unique mechanism of action , aripiprazole may have a more favorable side - effect profile compared to risperidone [ 130 ] .
mild and transient effects such as sedation , drooling , tremors , and weight gain were noted in patients taking aripiprazole [ 131 ] .
6.3 .
selective reuptake inhibitors ( sri ) in autistic individuals , anxiety and repetitive and ritualistic behavior can hinder social interaction and learning [ 132 , 133 ] .
sris in general are effective in treating anxiety and obsessive - compulsive symptoms [ 134 , 135 ] .
in addition , accumulating evidence shows that serotonin system abnormalities may contribute to the etiology of autism [ 136 - 139 ] .
consequently , these agents have been increasingly used in treating the disruptive behaviors in autistic individuals [ 140 , 141 ] .
a recent meta - analysis of the published literature provides support for a small but significant effect of sri in the treatment of repetitive behaviors in asd [ 140 ] .
there is also some evidence to suggest that sris may be helpful for the proper management of comorbid anxiety in asd [ 141 ] .
however , to date , the clinical trials examining the use of sris in autism have been mostly limited by small sample sizes and mixed results , warranting the need for additional randomized controlled trials .
6.4 .
other therapies at the neurochemical level , apart from dopamine and serotonin , abnormalities in a number of other key neurotransmitters and / or receptors have been implicated .
this includes glutamate [ 142 ] , gaba [ 143 ] , the neuropeptide oxytocin [ 144 - 146 ] , and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors [ 147 , 148 ] ( table 2 ) .
6.5 .
pediatric tbi tbi can result in a variety of neurological and behavioral disturbances , including seizures , impulsivity , and cognitive decline .
in recent years , there has been a rapid increase in the number of pharmacological targets evaluated in various animal models of tbi , many with significant positive outcomes .
unfortunately , their proven efficacy in the clinical setting are still lacking for both the adult and pediatric population [ 149 , 150 ] .
table 3 summarizes selected clinical studies examining the therapeutic potential of pharmaceutical agents following pediatric tbi. with an increased understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiological events after tbi , however , hope remains regarding the development of novel pharmaceutical therapies to better address the long - term patient outcomes [ 151 ] .
6.6 .
future directions no single agent likely will become the " magic bullet " in treating pediatric tbi and autism .
as for pharmacologic research for the neurological sequela following tbi and the core symptoms of autism advances , a greater emphasis on a holistic approach , combining behavioral and pharmacologic therapy , may emerge .
currently , the only empirically supported behavioral treatments for autism are based on aba [ 108 ] , which has been combined with pharmacologic treatment in at least one trial [ 152 ] .
in this study , the combination of an atypical antipsychotic and parent training resulted in greater reduction of serious maladaptive behavior than medication alone in children with asd [ 152 ] .
no studies , to our knowledge , have been conducted in adults or children following tbi using this combined therapy approach .
in addition to combined pharmacology and behavioral therapy , it may be advantageous to use a polypharmacy approach and / or a drug with multiple and pleiotropic mechanism due to the complexity and heterogeneity present in tbi and autism [ 120 , 153 ] .
7. conclusions children diagnosed with asd or suffering pediatric tbi share similar symptoms based on pathophysiologic changes within the brain .
in this review , we discussed several shared symptoms including dysfunction in communication , loss of executive function , and deficits in memory and intellectual processing .
not surprisingly , pediatric tbi patients and asd patients share several underlying pathophysiologic changes that contribute to these symptoms and cause increased susceptibility for sensory processing dysfunction , seizures , and gastrointestinal disorders .
advanced imaging modalities are being used to track changes within the brain related to symptom manifestations .
the similarities between tbi and asd warrant continued investigation and improved classification criteria .
treatment approaches including aba and pharmacologic agents may benefit patients with pediatric tbi or asd .
future work will delineate the subtle differences between these spectrum disorders .

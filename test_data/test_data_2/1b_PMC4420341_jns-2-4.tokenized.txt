aim : to analyse the outcome of neonatal sacrococcygeal teratomas ( sct ) in our setup .
materials and methods : hospital records of 10 neonates , who were operated for sct during 14 years time period , were retrieved and analysed .
letters were sent to 6 parents / caretakers of children who were lost to follow up ; none of them responded .
results : seven girls and 3 boys with a mean age of 9 days ( range 1 - 30 days ) underwent excision of sct in the neonatal period .
antenatal pickup rates were poor ( 2 / 10 ) .
two patients presented with tumor rupture .
though all had an obvious mass at birth , only half of them presented on day 1 of life .
the remaining 5 patients came late at a mean age of 11 days .
half of the scts were 10 cm or larger in size .
one patient was misdiagnosed as meningomyelocoele .
all underwent complete excision with coccygectomy by posterior approach in prone position .
there were only 2 patients who could be classified as altman type ii , the rest were all altman type i. histopathology ( hpe ) revealed mature cystic teratoma ( n = 8 ) , grade 1 immature teratoma ( n = 1 ) and grade 3 immature teratoma ( n = 1 ) .
there was no mortality ; and complications were seen in 3 / 10 patients ( 1 neurogenic bladder , 1 major wound infection with ventriculitis and 1 minor wound infection ) .
the mean follow up was 25 months ( range 1 month to 6 years ) in 4 patients with no recurrence .
conclusions : neonatal scts are usually benign with a good outcome after complete surgical excision with a low complication rate .
although long term follow up has been advocated , the follow up was poor in this series .
sacrococcygeal teratoma introduction sacrococcygeal teratoma ( sct ) has an incidence of about 1 / 40,000 live births and is the commonest congenital tumour in the neonate [ 1 ] .
in 1973 , altman classified sct into 4 types based on the external component and intrapelvic / intra - abdominal extension of the tumour ( american academy of pediatrics surgical section classification ) [ 1 ] .
the scts seen at birth are usually altman type i and ii ( 87 %) [ 1 ] .
rarely type iii can also be seen in neonates [ 2 ] .
type iv is typically seen later in life as there is no external component [ 1 ] .
we describe our experience with 10 neonatal scts and review the pertinent literature .
materials and methods a retrospective descriptive study was carried out in one of the two units of pediatric surgery , in a tertiary care public hospital of a resource challenged country over fourteen years four months ( may 1998 to august 2012 ) .
the hospital records of 10 neonates , who underwent surgical treatment for sct during this time period , were retrieved and analysed .
letters were sent to the parents of 6 children , who were lost to follow up ( ltfu ) , but none of them responded .
we also attempted telephoning at their contact numbers obtained from hospital records .
however not a single patient 's family could be reached .
during the same period , a total of 32 patients of sct of all age groups were treated in our pediatric surgical unit .
results seven girls and 3 boys with a mean age of 9 days ( range 1 - 30 days ) underwent excision of sct in the neonatal period .
antenatal diagnosis of sacrococcygeal mass ( scm ) was made only in 2 / 3 mothers who had 3rd trimester ultrasonograms .
polyhydromnios without placentomegaly was seen in 1 mother .
none had family history of twinning .
the mean birth weight was 2710g ( range 1975 - 3500g ) and all except 2 were full - term babies .
two neonates were born by lower segment caesarean section ( lscs ) and the rest were normal vaginal deliveries ( nvd ) .
two out of eight nvds were unsupervised home deliveries .
all of them had an obvious mass at lower back since birth ( fig. 1 ) .
despite the presence of an obvious mass , only half of them were brought to hospital on day 1 of life .
a delay of 5 - 18 days ( mean 11 days ) was seen in the other half of the patients .
one antenatally diagnosed baby born by lscs had rupture of the tumor with bleeding and had to be rushed for surgery .
another baby born by nvd at home presented at 11 days with rupture but no bleeding and was mistaken for a meningomyelocoele ( mmc ) preoperatively as the child also had an equinus deformity of right foot .
one term baby born elsewhere by lscs for meconium stained liquor , was referred to us with sct ( missed on 3rd trimester scan ) and severe respiratory distress since 2 hours of life .
chest x - ray revealed bilateral ground glass appearance and there was no evidence of cardiac failure .
echocardiography was normal .
the baby was stabilized by neonatologists for probable meconium aspiration syndrome .
surgery was deferred till day 30 of life when his respiratory conditions had completely settled so that general anaesthesia could be given safely .
associated anomalies included cleft lip and palate in 1 patient and equinus deformity of foot in another .
in half of them , the tumor size was 10 cm or more , the largest being 20 cms .
alfa - feto protein ( afp ) was not done .
figure 1 : sct after preoperative stabilization , the neonates underwent complete excision of sct with coccygectomy ( fig. 2 ) by posterior approach in prone position through an inverted chevron incision .
laparotomy was not required in any case .
there were only 2 patients who could be classified as altman type ii , the rest being altman type i. all neonates needed intra - operative blood transfusion .
postoperative ventilation was necessary in only 1 baby .
all excised specimens were subjected to histopathological examination ( hpe ) , which revealed mature teratoma ( n = 8 ) , grade 1 immature teratoma ( n = 1 ) and grade 3 immature teratoma ( n = 1 ) .
figure 2 : excised specimen .
there were no deaths .
early postoperative complications included minor wound infection ( n = 1 ) and major wound infection with ventriculitis ( n = 1 ) .
neurogenic bladder was seen in 1 patient who required vesicostomy 1 month after excision of sct .
she underwent vesicostomy closure at the age of 3 years and parents were advised clean intermittent catheterization ( cic ) .
however , there was poor compliance to the suggested management and she developed recurrent urinary tract infections ( uti ) .
at 6 years follow - up , her micturating cystourethrogram ( mcug ) ( fig. 3 ) and radionucleiotide renal scan ( dmsa ) showed major vesicoureteric reflux ( vur ) on left side and multiple scars in the left kidney .
increased frequency of stools was seen in 2 patients during the first few months after surgery .
figure 3 : mcug showing vur .
all patients were advised long term follow up , however only 4 have come regularly .
the mean follow - up was 25 months ( range 1 m to 6 years ) with no recurrence .
discussion although there is no dearth of literature on sct , there are very few case series from resource challenged nations like ours [ 3 , 4 ] .
male : female ratio : a female preponderance ( 2.3:1 ) was noted in our series consistent with the female : male ratio of 3 - 4 : 1 in literature [ 1 , 5 , 6 ] .
the exact reason for this predilection is not known .
size : altman et al have classified the size of scts as follows : small , 2 to 5 cm diameter ; moderate , 5 to 10 cm diameter ; large , > 10 cm diameter [ 1 ] .
going by this classification , half of our cases were large tumours measuring > 10cm .
although some authors believe that the size of sct is independent of its biological behaviour [ 6 ] ; larger tumours are more likely to have immature histology and may lead to greater intraoperative blood loss [ 1 , 7 ] .
both the tumours with immature histology in our study were larger than 10 cms in size .
type : the most common type seen was type i ( 8 / 10 ) followed by type ii ( 2 / 10 ) .
there were no type iii / iv scts as they are known to occur beyond neonatal age .
differential diagnosis : lemire et al have described 50 differential diagnoses for sct [ 8 ] .
however , type i / ii sct should mainly be differentiated from a sacral meningomyelocoele ( mmc ) which was challenging in one of our cases .
an mri could have helped in differentiating between the two entities .
histology : histological grading of scts ( gonzalez - crussi ) from grade 0 - 3 is based on the absence / presence of immature neural elements and their quantities [ 9 ] .
the incidence is reported as benign ( grade 0 ) - 75 % , immature ( grades 1 - 3 ) - 11.8 % , and malignant - 13.2 % [ 10 ] .
some authors believe that this does not correlate with the prognosis of sct [ 6 ] .
as was seen in our patients , the incidence of immature teratomas is reported as about 20 % [ 7 , 11 ] and they are usually found in newborns [ 6 ] .
associated malformations : associated malformations are seen in 18 % of scts which is comparable to 20 % in this series ( 2 / 10 ) [ 1 , 5 ] .
the most commonly seen anomalies are anorectal and genital [ 12 ] which we did not see .
lahdenne et al have reported a high incidence of vertebral abnormalities ( 80 %) in 45 patients with benign sct at a mean follow up of 21 years [ 13 ] .
the association of sct with cleft lip and palate , as seen in one of our patients , could not be replicated in the literature search .
this observation could be incidental as no possible embryological event can explain this concurrence .
antenatal diagnosis : type i and ii scts are commonly diagnosed by prenatal sonogram in the 24th - 34th weeks of gestation [ 12 ] .
the presence of a heterogeneous , well circumscribed exophytic mass at the caudal end of the fetus is pathognomonic .
even large type iii and iv tumors can be diagnosed prenatally [ 14 ] .
a close antenatal observation is necessary to look for complications .
the presence of placentomegaly , cardiomegaly , or non - immune hydrops fetalis is indicative of a poor outcome [ 15 ] .
fetal mri may provide additional anatomical information [ 16 , 17 ] .
antenatal pickup was extremely poor in our patients ( 2 / 10 ) .
mode of delivery : lscs is advised to mothers whose fetuses harbour large scts (> 10 cm diameter ) and highly vascular tumours ; this is done after fetal lung maturity has been attained [ 5 , 18 ] .
others recommend lscs for all scts larger than 5cm in order to prevent the risk of rupture and bleeding [ 19 ] .
despite 5 tumours being > 10 cm in dimension , only 2 mothers underwent lscs in our series .
this could have led to the high incidence of tumour rupture ( 2 / 10 ) .
as 8 / 10 scts were not antenatally diagnosed , the issue of elective lscs to prevent rupture of large tumours , did not arise .
it is incredulous that 2 of the mothers delivered their babies having large scts through normal vaginal route at home and unsupervised .
nevertheless , similar reports of large scts being born normally at home are found from other third world countries as well [ 20 ] .
tumour rupture has been shown to be associated with increased perinatal mortality [ 15 ] .
antenatal intervention : in contrast to neonatal sct , prenatally diagnosed sct remains at a high risk of perinatal complications and death [ 21 ] .
the presence of placentomegaly / hydrops in such a fetus heralds impending fetal demise .
high - output cardiac failure resulting from arteriovenous shunting through the tumour is postulated to be the cause for fetal death [ 22 ] .
unless the shunt is reversed , it is difficult to save the fetus .
thus an urgent surgical intervention in the form of tumour debulking , either as fetal surgery or postnatally after urgent caesarean section , is indispensable .
definitive sct resection can be carried out in the neonatal period after stabilization .
in 1997 , adzick et al reported the first successful fetal resection of sct in a 26 week old fetus with a large sct , polyhydromnios and impending hydrops ; thus reversing the pathophysiology of vascular steal and preventing hydrops [ 23 ] .
surprisingly , graf et al found that 5 preterm sct debulking specimens all showed grade 3 immature teratomas and 2 also had nests of malignant foci .
on comparing the hpe with definitive resection specimens , they actually found tumour maturation in all 5 cases with disappearance of malignant foci , presence of mature histology and absence of any sct tissues ( only fibrosis ). whether these favourable changes were induced by the preterm debulking or they represent natural maturation of sct during gestation , is food for thought [ 24 ] .
successful antenatal decompression of a cystic type iv sct using an amniotic catheter , to assuage bilateral hydronephrosis and renal damage , has also been described [ 25 ] .
other antenatal interventions include aspiration of the cyst and amnioreduction which are usually done to ease maternal discomfort from gross distension and also to avoid preterm labour [ 21 ] .
kum et al have described the following prerequisites before prenatal intervention for sct in preterm pregnancy [ 18 ] : accurate prenatal diagnosis and well defined natural history to allow the confident diagnosis of a correctable lesion that will otherwise prevent fetal survival .
absence of other life threatening or debilitating anomalies .
ability to perform the procedure without increased risk to the mother 's life or her future fertility .
while we are still struggling to achieve accurate prenatal diagnosis , fetal intervention appears far - fetched in our current scenario .
postnatal surgical excision : excision within the 1st week of life should be the aim whenever possible .
it is important to confirm the availability of cross - matched blood in the operating room before starting the surgery since even benign scts can cause significant blood loss and exsanguination on the table [ 26 ] .
most on table deaths during sct resection are because of cardiac arrest resulting from electrolyte imbalance ( hyperkalaemia ) , and massive bleeding during surgery .
hence , a careful anaesthetic management is essential [ 27 ] .
complete excision of the tumour with coccygectomy is of paramount importance in preventing recurrence .
the recurrence rates reported without removal of the coccyx are as high as 37 % [ 9 ] .
the most common approach used is sacral ( 44.4 %) [ 11 ] as was done in all our cases .
however , in large tumors and especially in type iii and iv scts , one should not hesitate to take the sacro - abdominal approach ( 22.6 %) [ 11 ] .
complications : the complications seen in our patients are comparable to that reported in literature with wound infection being the commonest due to proximity of the surgical site to the anus [ 5 , 6 ] .
neuropathic bladder has also been reported [ 6 , 28 ] .
the temporary diarrhoea ( 9 %) usually settles by itself in majority of the cases as was seen in 2 of our patients [ 5 ] .
however , bowel incontinence and constipation have been described when these patients are followed up to adulthood [ 29 ] .
the neurological problems are more likely to occur when intra - pelvic tumour has been removed surgically .
in a 30 - year follow - up study on 25 patients operated for sct , bittmann et al found that poor cosmetic results in the buttock region was the most common long - term complication [ 30 ] .
other authors have reported lack of cosmesis in 29 - 40 % patients [ 4 , 31 ] .
this can lead to distortion of body image , particularly in teenagers , and can even cause psychological disturbances and depression .
providing good cosmesis may be challenging in the neonatal period due to lack of local tissues , large tumours , thinned / stretched out muscles , problems with skin flaps and high chances of postoperative wound infection .
however , once the tumour has been tackled and there is no recurrence for few years , plastic surgical reconstruction must be considered in these children including the use of silicone implants for flat gluteal regions .
malignancy : the chances of malignancy increase when the tumor size is > 10 cm [ 1 , 32 ] , in altman type iii and iv due to delay in diagnosis , with the presence of solid areas [ 5 , 15 ] and when presentation is beyond the 2nd month of life [ 1 ] .
incidence of malignancy in scts larger than 10 cm is 17 % [ 1 ] .
survival : excellent survival rates of more than 95 % , similar to our series , have been reported in literature for neonatal scts [ 23 ] .
mortality rate for scts larger than 10cm in dimension is reported as 18 % [ 1 ] .
recurrence : it is important to remember that even completely excised mature neonatal sct has a startling potential to recur ( 11 - 22 %) either as a benign or malignant tumour during the first 3 years of life [ 11 , 32 ] .
close follow - up every 3 - 6 months with physical examination including rectal examination , serum alpha - fetoprotein , and diagnostic imaging , is advisable for at least 3 years [ 32 ] .
raised afp levels may be the first indicator for recurrence even without any obvious local recurrence [ 32 ] .
however , the follow - up must be continued into adult life as lahdene et al have reported a 6.7 % recurrence , 21 - 43 years after resection of neonatal sct [ 33 ] .
the reasons for recurrence after a mature teratoma has been excised could be numerous .
large tumours may possibly have imperceptible tiny foci of malignant endodermal sinus cells which are mistakenly reported on hpe as mature [ 32 ] .
incomplete resection of tumour , intra - operative tumour spillage and omission of coccygectomy also increases the occurrence of malignant changes in the recurrent tumour [ 5 , 9 , 34 ] .
another possibility is malignant degeneration occurring in a mature teratoma which is known to happen with increasing age .
spillage of cyst fluid however does not predispose to recurrence [ 34 ] .
unfortunately , despite meticulous counselling and advice , only 40 % of our patients came for regular follow - up. there was no response to our reminder letters either .
in all probability , the children who are ltfu are well .
hence uneducated , poor , parents , who are living hand - to - mouth , feel it is an unnecessary effort to bring the child for a medical check - up. nevertheless , since we have not seen these patients , we cannot comment on their follow - up. conclusion the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of any sacrococcygeal mass , no matter how small or apparently insignificant it may appear cannot be overemphasized .
there is a potential to lead a normal life without disability after neonatal excision of sct .
however long term follow - up is advised as recurrences have occurred even in adulthood .

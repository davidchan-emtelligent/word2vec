interstitial lung disease ( ild ) represents a severe manifestation in connective tissue diseases ( ctd ) , with an overall incidence of 15 % , and it is still a challenge for clinicians evaluation and management .
ild is the most common manifestation of lung involvement in rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , observed in up to 80 % of biopsies , 50 % of chest computed tomography ( ct ) and only 5 % of chest radiographs .
histopatological patterns of ild in ra may present with different patterns , such as : usual interstitial pneumonia , non specific interstitial pneumonia , desquamative interstitial pneumonia , organizing pneumonia , and eosinophilic infiltration .
the incidence of ild in ra patients is not only related to the disease itself , many drugs may be in fact associated with the development of pulmonary damage .
some reports suggest a causative role for tnfalpha inhibitors in ra - ild development / worsening , anyway , no definitive statement can be drawn thus data are incomplete and affected by several variables .
a tight control ( pulmonary function tests and / or hrct ) is mandatory in patients with preexisting ild , but it should be also performed in those presenting risk factors for ild and mild respiratory symptoms .
biologic therapy should be interrupted , and , after excluding triggering infections , corticosteroids should be administered .
1. introduction connective tissue diseases ( ctd ) represent a heterogeneous group of immunologicaly mediated disorders that may affect a wide variety of organs .
respiratory system is frequently involved in some ctd such as rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , systemic sclerosis , dermatomyositis , sjogren syndrome , and undifferentiated ctd [ 1 ] .
all respiratory components may be interested for the disease : pleura , parenchyma , airways , and vessels .
interstitial lung disease ( ild ) is an established clinical corollary with an overall incidence of 15 % in ctd ; it represents a severe manifestation that is still a challenge for clinicians evaluation and management [ 2 ] .
it has been postulated that an initial trigger ( virus , trauma , etc. ) activates resident cells which produce proinflammatory mediators ; subsequently chemotactic cytokines guide the infiltration of inflammatory cells which produce profibrotic mediators such as transforming growth factor b ( tgf - beta ) , platelet - derived growth factor , and il - 4 .
the matrix component accumulates in the extracellular compartment and disrupts the physiologic structure causing severe functional impairment [ 3 , 4 ] .
2. rheumatoid arthritis and ild rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that affects approximately 1 % of the population potentially leading to functional disability , with about 30 % of patients unable to work after 3 years of disease [ 5 ] .
nearly 50 % of ra patients present extra - articular manifestations involving skin , eye , heart , and lungs [ 6 ] .
although cardiovascular disease is responsible for the majority of ra - related deaths , pulmonary complications are frequent and cause 10 - 20 % of overall mortality [ 7 ] .
ild is the most common manifestation of lung involvement in ra observed in up to 80 % of biopsies , 50 % of chest ct , and only 5 % of chest radiographs [ 8 ] .
mean age at lung disease onset is the fifth or sixth decade ; some studies reported an increased prevalence in males and longstanding ra [ 9 , 10 ] .
furthermore , smokers and patients with rheumatoid nodules , high titre of rheumatoid factor , and antinuclear antibodies are described to be at higher risk of developing ild , whereas disease severity seems to be an irrelevant factor [ 11 ] .
human leukocyte antigen b40 and alpha1 antitrypsin were already described associated with ild development [ 12 ] .
the most frequent respiratory symptoms are progressive dyspnea and dry cough ; the majority of patients present fine bibasilar crackles , and clubbing is less common than in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( ipf ) [ 11 ] .
histopathological patterns of ild in ra may present with various manifestations , sometime associated : usual interstitial pneumonia ( uip ) , nonspecific interstitial pneumonia ( nsip ) , desquamative interstitial pneumonia ( dip ) , organizing pneumonia , and eosinophilic infiltration [ 13 ] .
data on the different prevalence of reported patterns are contrasting .
lee et al. identified the uip as the most common histopathological pattern ( 56 %) in contrast with tansey et al. who described the nsip as the most prevalent [ 14 - 18 ] table 1 .
imaging data have demonstrated that hrct is more sensitive than radiography and correlates with histopathological patterns ; thus , it may allow for an early diagnosis and should be performed in ra patients manifesting either risk factors for ild or minor abnormalities on chest radiographs [ 17 ] .
recently , zou et al. reported the most common findings observed with hrct in 110 ra patients : ground glass ( 39.9 %) , honeycombing ( 4.5 %) , reticular patterns , and consolidation ( 1.8 %) ; patients with reticular patterns and honeycombing were more likely to show the respiratory symptoms .
other described abnormalities are architectural distortion , pulmonary nodules , emphysema , bronchiectasis and traction bronchiectasis , subpleural nodules , pleural thickening , and lymph node enlargements [ 17 , 19 ] .
among routinely exams , pulmonary function tests ( pft ) with diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide ( dlco ) are the most sensitive ; a restrictive defect is typical , but mixed findings may be also present [ 20 ] .
despite bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) may reveal the presence of neutrophil alveolitis and neutrophil percentage and has been reported to correlate with dlco reduction , it is not usually adopted in ild - associated ra patients and it is generally used to exclude complicating infections and malignancy [ 21 ] .
to adopt the correct ild treatment in ra patients is still a challenge .
ideally therapy should be tailored to the histopathological pattern that remains the best prognostic factor ( i.e. , the presence of active inflammatory lesions ( cellular interstitial pneumonia and lymphoid hyperplasia ) that may be reverted by an early treatment ) .
3. ild and biological therapy the incidence of ild in ra patients is not only related to the disease itself .
many drugs may be associated with the development of pulmonary damage : nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , intravenous immunoglobulin , and synthetic dmards such us methotrexate , leflunomide , and cyclophosphamide [ 22 ] .
the introduction of biologic dmards has dramatically improved the course of ra by reducing symptoms , arresting structural damage , and thus leading to a significant amelioration of quality of life in these patients [ 23 ] .
anyway , these agents are not free from side effects among whom are infections , malignancies , and demyelinating disorders [ 24 , 25 ] .
new onset or ild worsening has already been reported as a possible consequence of the three tnfalpha inhibitors which are the most widely used class of biologics [ 26 - 28 ] ( table 2 ) : infliximab ( a chimeric igg1k monoclonal antibody consisting of human constant and murine variable regions ) , etanercept ( a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand - binding portion of human 75 kda tnf receptor linked to the fc portion of human igg1 ) , and adalimumab ( a recombinant human igg1 monoclonal antibody specific for human tnfalpha ) [ 29 ] .
in 2002 , peno - green et al. described the first case of ild in an ra patient after anti - tnfalpha therapy ( etanercept ) [ 30 ]. by now , a total of 144 ra patients with new onset or ild worsening after anti - tnfalpha ( 55 infliximab , 95 etanercept , and 4 adalimumab ) therapy have been reported [ 31 ] .
in 2010 , dixon et al. showed higher risk of death with a higher prevalence of ild in the anti - tnfalpha group with respect to synthetic dmards ( 2.8 % versus 1.9 % p = 0.006 ) [ 26 ] .
alvarez et al. analyzed clinical characteristics , outcomes , and patterns of association of all reported cases of 122 patients ( 108 adult ra patients ) developing ild after biologic therapy ( etanercept 58 , infliximab 56 , adalimumab 3 , and rituximab 5 ) .
patients generally manifested dyspnea , fever and cough , malaise , pleuritic pain , and haemoptysis ; the disease onset generally appeared after at least 6 months of therapy .
diagnosis performed by hrct ( 36 detailed cases ) revealed ground - glass opacities , reticular nodular , nodular pattern , and honeycomb changes ; bal showed lymphocytes and macrophages .
histopathologic findings were uip , nsip , organizing pneumonia , and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia .
treatment of ild included biologic agents withdrawal and the use of corticosteroids , cyc , and azathioprine .
the mortality rate was increased by age > 65 years , later onset of ild , and the association of methotrexate and anti - tnfalpha agents [ 32 ] .
in contrast with these observations , two prospective observational studies have examined the influence of anti - tnfalpha therapy upon ild .
in japan , 7091 ra patients treated with etanercept and 5000 patients treated with infliximab and methotrexate were monitored for 6 months .
only 0.5 % and 0.6 % patients were reported to have ild [ 27 , 28 ] ( table 2 ) .
in addition , other authors reported good results by the use of these agents in patients with ra - ild .
bargagli et al. showed an improvement in lung function evaluated by pft dlco and a stabilization of hrct abnormalities after infliximab and suggests that it may be considered as a therapeutic option for the treatment of ild - ra [ 33 ] .
similar results are reported by vassallo et al .
[ 34 ] .
moreover , antoniou et al. , in 2007 evaluating the potential effectiveness of infliximab treatment for pulmonary fibrosis in three ra and one ssc patients described that pulmonary fibrosis remained stable during treatment in terms of symptoms , pfts , and hrct [ 35 ] .
these conflicting results may be explained by the complex and dualistic role of tnfalpha and reflect the contradictory data derived by studies in vitro and in murine models .
tnfalpha is produced by macrophages , cd4 + and cd8 + t cells , b cells , neutrophils , endothelial cells , and fibroblast .
several studies indicate a profibrotic role for this molecule .
transgenic mice overexpressing murine tnfalpha in the lung develop a chronic lymphocytic alveolitis which severity correlates with the expression of tnfalpha mrna .
moreover , tnfalpha may upregulate tgfb1 expression in the lungs via the activation of regulated kinase pathway in fibroblasts [ 36 , 37 ] .
on the other hand , mice ko for tnfalpha develop a bleomycin - induced pulmonary fibrosis that may be reverted by the administration of tnfalpha [ 38 ] ; tnf - alpha is also able to block the synthesis of collagen production and inhibits alpha2 collagen gene transcription in human dermal fibroblasts [ 39 ] .
few reports are currently available for the new biologic drugs : rituximab ( an engineered chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against the anti - cd20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant b cells ) and tocilizumab ( humanized anti - il - 6 receptor monoclonal antibody ) .
sixteen cases of rituximab - induced interstitial lung disease have been reported in haematological disorders whereas only two cases of organizing pneumonia have been described in ra patients [ 40 , 41 ] ; a clinical trial on the benefit of rituximab in ra lung disease is ongoing [ 42 ] .
kawashiri et al. recently reported a fatal case of acute exacerbation of ild in a ra patient 10 months after starting tocilizumab [ 43 ] no data are currently reported about ild onset or exacerbation for abatacept ( a dimeric fusion protein composed of ctla4 extracellular domain and human fcigg1 , developed to block the interactions of cd28 - cd80 / cd86 thus impairs t - cell activation ) in ra patients [ 31 ] .
4. conclusions in conclusions , even if some reports seem to suggest a causative role for tnfalpha inhibitors in ra - ild development / worsening , no definitive statement can be drawn .
in addition these data are affected by several variables ( ethnicity , comorbidity , association with synthetic dmards , type of study , etc. ) .
a tight control ( pulmonary function tests and / or hrct ) is mandatory in patients with preexisting ild , but it should be also performed in those presenting risk factors for ild and mild respiratory symptoms .
biologic therapy should be interrupted , and , after excluding triggering infections , corticosteroids should be administered .
larger controlled studies specifically designed to assess the safety profile of anti - tnf - alpha and new biologics in ild - ra patients at different steps of ild progression are needed .

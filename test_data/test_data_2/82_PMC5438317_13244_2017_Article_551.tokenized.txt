objectives to determine the advantages of radiological imaging of a collection of full - term teratological fetuses in order to increase their scientific and educational value .
background anatomical museums around the world exhibit full - term teratological fetuses .
unfortunately , these museums are regularly considered as " morbid cabinets " .
detailed dysmorphological information concerning the exhibited specimens is often lacking .
moreover , fetuses with severe and complex congenital anomalies are frequently diagnosed incompletely , incorrectly or not at all .
methods in order to verify diagnoses and to enrich their educational and scientific value , we imaged 41 out of the 72 teratological specimens present in the collection of our anatomy and pathology museum in nijmegen ( the netherlands ) by means of magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and computed tomography ( ct ) .
additionally , contemporary dysmorphological insights and 3d models are implemented in the teratology education of medical students and residents .
conclusions full - term teratological fetuses have become increasingly rare and deserve a prominent place in every anatomical museum ; they are suitable for contemporary teratological research and education .
modern radiological techniques markedly enhance their scientific and didactic value .
teaching points * to explore the scientific and educational potential of institutionalised teratological collections * to understand the additional value of radiological imaging in diagnosing teratological specimens * to learn about the specific settings of mri parameters when scanning fixed specimens * to recognise specific internal dysmorphology in several congenital anomalies keywords education magnetic resonance imaging computed tomography teratology congenital anomaly issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction many anatomical museums around the world exhibit teratological specimens of third trimester fetuses .
among the institutionalised collections , especially noteworthy are the eighteenth century collection of the federal pathological anatomy museum in vienna ( austria ) [ 1 , 2 ] , the eighteenth century collection of the hunterian museum of the royal college of surgeons in london [ 3 ] and the nineteenth century vrolik collection residing in the vrolik museum at the university medical centre of amsterdam [ 4 ] .
they all contain a rich trove of teratological specimens .
although some academic institutions have abandoned their anatomical collections because of apparent legal issues , safety reasons , financial cuts or newly defined priorities , these museums are much more than time capsules with accumulations of curiosities [ 5 ] .
they can be regarded as vibrant , inspirational , instructive and interdisciplinary academic working environments with scientific and educational potentials that can be exploited in ( bio ) medical curricula or in resident training programs [ 6 ] .
however , one might wonder if anatomical museums should still exhibit full - grown dysmorphic fetuses as these types of anomalies are rarely occurring events in modern times .
moreover , one could question whether historical teratological specimens still have a contemporary value in a period of daily evolving medical innovations and molecular technology .
these are issues anatomical museums have to deal with on a daily basis [ 7 , 8 ] .
congenital anomalies have intrigued mankind since the earliest times .
already in ancient cultures terracotta ornaments were fabricated depicting congenital anomalies .
these were clearly based upon existing cases , indicating that they were perceived as divinities , omens or even punishments of supernatural origin [ 9 , 10 ] .
nowadays , people with very diverse backgrounds visit teratological collections residing in medical museums .
knowledge of both the normal and abnormal embryological development is important for both teachers and physicians while medical students and patients have a constantly growing medical knowledge and ask more sophisticated questions [ 6 ] .
this implies that a teratological collection can be of great value to educate people about human development .
although several anatomical museums expose teratological specimens , most institutions lack detailed external and internal ( dys ) morphological descriptions or imaging .
because of this , collections are often stigmatised as " morbid cabinets " .
the teratological collection of the museum for anatomy and pathology in nijmegen , the netherlands , currently possesses 72 specimens .
it was collected by albert verhofstad ( deceased 2008 ) , who was affiliated to the radboud university medical centre in nijmegen , between the 1950s and 1970s .
the collection originates from before the ubiquitous availability and utilisation of ( high - resolution ) ultrasound for prenatal screening and therefore most specimens are full - grown fetuses or newborns .
nowadays full - grown fetuses with severe congenital anomalies are rarely born in well - developed countries .
this implies that teratological collections become more valuable with time .
in the past , our collection of teratological fetuses too was often seen as a " morbid cabinet " by both students and the general public .
in the exhibition , there was neither a clear choice of the exhibited fetuses nor was there any systematic approach recognisable ; questions about the nature and pathogenesis of several congenital anomalies could not be answered .
therefore , in order to systematically expose the teratological collection of our museum , we defined nine anomaly groups , into which all 72 specimens could be categorised .
this categorisation led to an new exhibition , in which 35 of the most educational specimens found a permanent expository position ( fig. 1 ). fig. 1 photograph of the teratological collection in the museum for anatomy and pathology of the radboud university medical centre in nijmegen , the netherlands .
the exhibit displays 35 teratological fetuses , 10 specimens of animal teratology , historical books on teratology , 3d models and plaster casts in order to increase the scientific and educational value of the specimens of this unique teratological collection , we wanted to elucidate the internal ( dys ) morphological characteristics .
instead of invasive exploration , computed tomography ( ct ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) techniques were used to generate detailed images of the internal ( dys ) morphology of the teratological fetuses .
radiological imaging proved to be an excellent method to investigate these delicate specimens in a non - invasive manner [ 11 ] .
recently , the museum opened an innovative exhibition of specimens documented with these images .
this exhibition is accessible for both medical students and the general public .
radiological imaging and information about normal development and pathogenesis can be obtained by consulting a touchscreen in which all specimens are described in full detail ( fig. 2 ) .
common information is given on physical billboards throughout the exposition. fig. 2 screenshot of the interactive information of neural tube defects using radiological imaging : vertebrae of a fetus with rachischisis can be compared to vertebrae of a normal fetus and a fetus with spina bifida here we report on the radiological imaging results and we describe four fetuses ( cases 1 - 4 ) , in which new diagnoses or interesting morphological characteristics were established .
furthermore , we discuss the scientific and educational benefits that can be gained from radiological imaging of dysmorphic fetuses .
the purpose of this paper is to present an approach to create an innovative teratological exposition in order to de - stigmatise and to more profoundly educate the ( bio ) medical student and professional .
materials and methods the entire collection of 72 teratological fetuses was visually inspected and re - described according to contemporary syndromological views by a panel of experts in 2012 ( r.j.o. , a.n.s.f. and l.l.b. ) .
verification of the identified syndromes and sequences was obtained by consulting peer groups and contemporary handbooks on clinical syndromology [ 12 , 13 ] .
several anomaly groups were defined according to the classification of congenital anomalies described by the european surveillance of congenital anomalies [ 14 ] .
radiological imaging was used to generate detailed images of the internal ( dys ) morphology .
an inclusion criterion for radiological imaging was that the specimen had not been previously subjected to autopsy in the area of interest .
furthermore , the group with neural tube defects consisted of 20 fetuses. from these fetuses , six fetuses were selected : three that displayed iniencephaly and three with a variety of other neural tube defects .
this resulted in the radiological imaging of 41 specimens .
radiological imaging consisted of a total body mri and total body ct ; scanning protocols are described below .
prior to scanning , the specimens were taken out of their jars , thoroughly rinsed with demineralised water and placed in disposable plastic bags to prevent dehydration during imaging .
after imaging , the specimens were replaced in a 4 % formaldehyde solution .
radiological data were reviewed by three radiologists with expertise in paediatric neurological ( k.k.v.u. ) , cardiothoracic ( d.g.h.b. ) and abdominal / musculoskeletal ( w.m.k. ) radiology , all with previous expertise in fetal post - mortem imaging .
mri protocol specimens were scanned on a tim trio 3 - t mri scanner ( siemens , erlangen , germany ) .
specimens smaller than 30 cm in length were placed in a standard circular head and neck coil , specimens over 30 cm in length were measured with an additional body coil .
mri scan parameters of the clinical fetal post - mortem mri were transformed to optimise the spatial resolution of the specimens as they had stayed in a 4 % formaldehyde solution for 50 - 60 years [ 15 , 16 ] .
an overview of the mri parameters is given in table 1 .

two protocols were used to cover the different sizes of the specimens ; one volume scan mode for fetuses smaller than 16 cm and one helical scan mode for fetuses larger than 16 cm. three - dimensional ( 3d ) reconstructions were made using a filter convolution ( fc ) of 30 for bone and a fc of 07 for soft tissue , both with adaptive iterative dose reduction ( aidr ) in 3d .
an overview of the ct protocol parameters is listed in table 2 .

the radiological imaging had no effects on the condition of the specimens and no complications in the specimen conservation were discovered .
ct and mr images were found to be of very high quality .
although we encountered some problems with post - mortem artefacts , e.g. shrinkage of the brain , decalcified skeletons and unusable radiographic skeleton surveys , most radiological data were of sufficient quality to re - diagnose and describe the internal characteristics of each fetus .
an overview of the scanned fetuses is given in table 3 .
we give an extensive description of a selection of four cases below .

all extremities showed redundant skin folds with severe brachydactyly and mildly affected trident hands .
craniofacial abnormalities included macrocephaly , severe frontal bossing , prominent cheeks and chin , ocular proptosis , a depressed nasal bridge and a severe hypoplastic midface with hypertelorism , a prominent tongue and slightly recessed ears ( fig. 3a ) .
the former diagnosis of this specimen , before re - examination in 2012 , was achondroplasia .
the ct images revealed that the calcification of the bones was severely diminished ( fig. 3b ) .
mri images did reveal the contours of the bones .
based on the combination of the micromelic shortening of all extremities , bowing of both femora , short ribs , bell - shaped thorax with small chest cavity and presumably hypoplastic lungs , platyspondyly of the vertebra and the polymicrogyria we diagnosed the condition as thanatophoric dysplasia ( td ) type i ( fig. 3b - f ) .
neonatal death was most likely due to respiratory insufficiency and / or compression of the spinal cord or brainstem by spinal stenosis. fig. 3 a photograph of the full - term fetus of case 1 .
b three - dimensional reconstructed skeleton based on the ct data .
although there was severely diminished bone calcification , ct images visualised extremely shortened ribs , short and small scapulae and iliac bones , and femoral and humeral bowing .
c sagittal t1 - weighted mr image which showed a small foramen magnum with slight cranio - cervical caudal transition ( green arrow ) , platyspondyly of the vertebra with short vertebral arches resulting in spinal canal stenosis ( turquoise arrow ) .
d coronal t1 - weighted mr images showed a severely hypoplastic thorax with presumably severe lung - hypoplasia .
e transverse t1 - weighted mr image on the level of the femoral heads showed broad and irregular metaphyseal plates and extreme femoral bowing ( green arrow ) sometimes referred to as " telephone receiver " femora .
f transverse t1 - weighted mr image of the brain which showed courser gyri of the temporal lobes ( turquoise arrow ) and excessive gyration of the occipital lobes ( green arrow ) and can be interpreted as polymicrogyria .
note the shrunken brain and small lungs which were both interpreted as normal post - mortem artefacts and probably strengthened by the formalin fixation .
however , the presence of lung hypoplasia cannot be ruled out case 2 concerns a full - term , male neonate , which showed on external examination a protruding abdomen , excessive bowing of all extremities and mesomelic shortened arms .
craniofacial abnormalities included a hypoplastic midface , microstomia , recessed ears and a somewhat flattened face .
the head appeared to be positioned directly on the thorax with absence of the neck .
the lower extremities were positioned in a frog - like position ( fig. 4a ) .
the diagnosis of this specimen , before re - examination in 2012 , was achondroplasia .
the calcification of the bones was severely diminished , resulting in non - diagnosable ct images ( not shown ) .
mr images , however , did reveal the contours of the bones .
based on the distinct presence of multiple prenatal fractures , poorly mineralised and deformed cranial vault , secondarily healed osseous structures and small chest with presumably lung hypoplasia ( fig. 4b - e ) the diagnosis osteogenesis imperfecta ( oi ) type ii was made with reasonable certainty. fig. 4 a photograph of the full - term fetus of case 2 demonstrating a characteristic facial appearance , protruding abdomen and severely bowed extremities .
b coronal t1 - weighted mr image showed an aberrant and irregular humerus ( green arrow ) .
note the severely shrunken lungs insight the hypoplastic thorax ; interpreted as shrinkage of the lungs due to post - mortem artefacts and formalin fixation .
however , the presence of lung hypoplasia cannot be ruled out .
c transverse t1 - weighted mr image of the broadened and shortened right femoral bone which showed a fracture ( green arrow ) .
d transverse t1 - weighted mr image of the severely shortened and aberrant left femoral bone which showed multiple fractures ( green arrows ) and irregular cortical bone ( turquoise arrow ) .
e sagittal t1 - weighted mr image showed multiple fractures in the vertebral column ( green arrows ) .
note the distorted calvarium due to limited mineralisation and the shrunken brain due to the formalin fixation conjoined twin case 3 concerns a small , full - term , female , conjoined twin with two heads , two arms and two legs ( fig. 5a ) .
the diagnosis of this specimen , before re - examination in 2012 , was conjoined twin .
after re - describing and imaging this fetus , we diagnosed this specimen as parapagus dicephalus dibrachius dipus ( see " discussion ") .
both ct ( fig. 5b ) and mr ( fig. 5c - g ) data were of excellent quality to describe the intricate internal dysmorphological characteristics .
additionally , based on the mri data , a schematic drawing was made of the morphology of the " fused " heart in order to get insight into the complex haemodynamic situation ( fig. 6 ). fig. 5 a photograph of the full - term conjoined twin of case 3 .
b three - dimensional reconstructed skeleton based on the ct data showed butterfly and block vertebra ( turquoise arrow ) with fused ribs ( green arrow ) between the two separate vertebral columns there were two heads , two arms and two legs with one broad pelvis .
c coronal t1 - weighted mr image showed two normal brains , one shared " fused " heart and liver with one overarching diaphragm .
d coronal t1 - weighted mr image showed two separate oesophagi ( green arrows ) and two separate stomachs ( turquoise arrow ) .
e coronal t1 - weighted mr image showed a " fused " liver with two gallbladders ( green arrow ) .
f coronal t1 - weighted mr image showed two ascending aortas ( green arrows ) .
g coronal t1 - weighted mr image showed two kidneys and adrenal glands ( green arrows ) and one anus .
the two descending aortas fused at the level of the 11th thoracic vertebra ( turquoise arrow ) .
note that the right descending aorta is smaller than the left descending aorta fig 6 schematic drawing of the fused heart of case 3 .
there were two ventricles and two atria .
a normally located left aorta arose from the left ventricle .
at the right atrium small pulmonary veins were seen. from the right ventricle the second , relative smaller , right aorta , right pulmonary trunk and a right ventricle outflow tract ( rvot ) of the left pulmonary trunk were seen ; this could be interpreted as a triple outflow right ventricle ( torv ) .
there were two ducti arteriosi .
on the right side no clear pulmonary veins were seen .
there was a ventricular septal defect ( vsd ) resulting in a complex haemodynamic situation tetra - amelia syndrome case 4 concerns a full - term , female neonate , which showed on external examination total absence of all four limbs , micrognatia , microstomia , mild potter 's facies and hypertelorism .
a left - oriented deviation of the relatively small body is noticeable ( fig. 7a ) .
the diagnosis of this specimen , before re - examination in 2012 , was phocomelia .
the ct images reveal that the calcification of the bones is severely diminished ( fig. 7b ) .
mr images reveal the contours of the bones ( fig. 7c and d ) .
additionally , we found a concomitant diaphragmatic hernia , skeletal anomalies and a arnold - chiari malformation .
we diagnosed the condition as tetra - amelia syndrome with a concomitant diaphragmatic hernia ; a rarely described association [ 17 ]. fig. 7 a photograph of the full - term fetus of case 4 .
b three - dimensional reconstructed skeleton based on the ct data .
although there was severely diminished bone calcification , ct images visualised small pelvic bones , partial absence of the sacral bone and a thoracolumbar convex shaped curvature .
the scapulae and clavicles were normally developed with absence of the humeral , ulnar and radial bones including the hands .
in addition , the femora , tibial and fibular bones including the feet were absent .
c sagittal t1 - weighted mr image showed an arnold - chiari malformation ( green arrow ) and distorted vertebral column ( turquoise arrow ) .
d coronal t1 - weighted mr image showed a severe diaphragmatic hernia ( green arrow ) which deviated the heart completely to the right lateral thoracic wall .
the left pleural cavity was almost entirely occupied by the liver , stomach , spleen and left adrenal gland , the left lung was merely noticeable .
moreover , a distortion of the left ribs was seen ( turquoise arrow ) discussion although many anatomical museums display teratological fetuses on a smaller or larger scale , these displays usually lack comprehensive pathogenetic storylines , additional radiological imaging of the exposed specimens , and most importantly , they often neglect their potential value in biomedical curricula .
furthermore , the diagnoses that fetuses bear are often incomplete , incorrect or outdated .
as we demonstrated here , radiological imaging combined with contemporary dysmorphological knowledge was in most cases valuable or even essential to arrive at the correct diagnosis and to unveil the internal and sometimes unexpected peculiarities .
nowadays , many congenital and inherited anomalies can be diagnosed genetically .
however , embalmed museological specimens frequently have fragmented and contaminated dna , which is unsuitable for genetic exploration of candidate genes .
we tried molecular inversion probe ( mip ) techniques for targeted sequencing of genomic regions with potential candidate genes of multiple fetuses ; unfortunately , without satisfactory results .
cases 1 and 2 concern two distinct skeletal dysplasias , or osteochondrodysplasias , most of which originate from genetic defects that cause aberrant histological formation , growth and maturation of osseous and / or cartilaginous tissues .
they usually affect all skeletal elements equally , leading to a decreased postural length ( dwarfism ) .
therefore , skeletal dysplasias can be seen as generalised qualitative disorders of the skeleton , without primarily affecting the body plan [ 18 ] .
although achondroplasia is a specific diagnosis among the more than 300 skeletal dysplasias presently known , it has long been used as a generic term for any type of skeletal dysplasia , as it was in the cases described here .
despite the decalcification of the skeleton , which was probably largely caused by decalcification of the bone tissue due to the acidification of formalin through time [ 19 ] , radiological imaging made it possible to diagnose td type i in case 1 and oi type 2 in case 2 .
td is genetically related to ( true ) achondroplasia but it is much more severe , whereas oi is caused by a genetic defect in collagen formation , which leads to ( extremely ) brittle bones .
the imaging results demonstrate the pathogenesis , severity and potential lethality of the conditions in these cases , which markedly adds to their didactic value .
case 3 concerns a pair of conjoined twins .
despite being a rare congenital malformation with an incidence of 1:200,000 live births and 1:200 monozygotic twins , it is a widely known phenomenon among scientists and laymen alike [ 20 ] .
for many centuries , multiple rather enigmatic pathogenic hypotheses have been postulated , none of which satisfactorily explains their pathogenesis and conjunctional morphology .
an intriguing , though not undisputed theory was postulated by spencer in 2003 [ 21 ] .
her model hypothesises the presence of two ( instead of one ) embryonic primordial discs " floating " on the surface of a shared yolk sac ( resulting in ventral and lateral conjunction types ) or on a shared amniotic cavity ( resulting in dorsal / neural conjunction ) .
this " spherical coalescence " theory therefore postulates a secondary , symmetrical or asymmetrical , homologous conjunction of initially separate embryonic discs and subsequent embryonic fusion .
the nature and extent of the conjunction result from the initial reciprocal distance and position of the two primordial discs on the yolk sac or amniotic cavity .
case 3 concerned a parapagus dicephalus dibrachius dipus conjoined twin , which can be concluded from external dysmorphological findings .
however , radiological imaging revealed the intricate internal morphology and conjunction of organs , such as the heart and liver in this specific type , which is essential to understand the pathogenesis of conjoined twinning .
finally , case 4 presented with tetra - amelia syndrome : an extremely rare disorder characterised by the absence of all four limbs .
infants are often stillborn or die perinatally due to lung hypoplasia and concomitant anomalies such as microstomia and micrognathia .
no estimates on prevalence are described due to its rarity .
after radiological imaging , we found a diaphragmatic hernia in concomitance with tetra - amelia : this is only rarely found and scarcely described in the modern literature [ 17 , 22 ] .
although , diaphragmatic hernia is atypical in tetra - amelia syndrome , the acquired images can be used to educate the medical students on the subjects of congenital diaphragmatic hernias and the secondary effect on thoracic organ development .
the most convincing argument for the radiological imaging of a collection of teratological fetuses is the dramatic increase of internal dysmorphological insight obtained in a non - invasive manner .
although many teratological fetuses can be diagnosed and used in an educational setting based on their external dysmorphological appearance , radiological imaging increases the diagnostic value immensely in specifying anomaly subtypes ( e.g. in sirenomelia ) , re - diagnosing anomalies ( e.g. skeletal dysplasias ) or in teaching certain embryologically oriented pathogeneses ( e.g. conjoined twins ) .
moreover , radiological findings can strengthen arguments regarding pathogenetic hypotheses and thus lead to new or improved insights .
because of currently available prenatal screening options , pregnancies complicated by congenital anomalies are often terminated well before full - term development .
nowadays , stillborn fetuses in general , let alone fetuses with rare congenital anomalies , are almost never assigned to scientific body donation programs .
this results in an absence of supplementing teratological collections , which makes historical specimens of teratological full - term fetuses increasingly valuable and irreplaceable .
we posit that when well - defined teratological specimens are displayed respectfully with additional pathognomonic storylines and radiological data , these exhibitions are educationally legitimate and instructional for any museum visitor .
the acquired radiological data are essential to educate the student and the resident on the subject of teratology .
additionally , these high - resolution radiological images can be used to help the obstetrician to recognise congenital anomalies during prenatal screening .
radiological techniques transform the " old and dusty " anatomical museums into modern academic and dynamic working environments suitable to educate the student as well as the ( paediatric ) radiologists in training .
moreover , radiological imaging of teratological collections makes students wonder and enthusiastic about the use of radiology in their curriculum and learn to compare images with the observed ( museological ) specimen .
finally , radiological findings can strengthen arguments regarding embryologically oriented pathogenetic hypothesises. by imaging and re - diagnosing teratological specimens that display a similar condition congenital anomalies can be studied beyond the limitations of single case studies and the spectrum or heterogeneity of a congenital anomaly becomes more clear .
therefore , we conclude that teratological collections are a treasure chest for radiologists , paediatricians , geneticists , pathologists and embryologists , and are of interest for additional ( re ) describing and imaging following new imaging techniques .
conclusions teratological specimens are becoming increasingly rare and deserve a prominent place in anatomical museums .
these collections are very suitable for contemporary teratological research and can be used for public and medical education .
as shown in this paper , radiological imaging is essential to reveal all the diagnostic ins and outs of old teratological specimens .

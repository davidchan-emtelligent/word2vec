simple scoring functions alone can provide only shallow information about ligand - receptor interactions , since they do not distinguish neither residues nor single atoms .
very often a visual inspection is the only way to determine a binding mode .
here , we introduce an implementation of interaction profiles [ 1 ] based on structural interaction fingerprints ( sift ) [ 2 ] , which allow precise and rapid binding site description .
sifts employed in our modelling agenda form a nine - digit binary pattern for each amino - acid in the receptor , covering all major types of interactions .
computed over an ensemble of ligands and / or receptor conformations , averaged real number sift elegantly depicts overall preferences towards particular interactions .
this enables construction of a compact scheme of crucial forces involved in ligand - receptor complex formation , which then facilitate design of a binding mode hypothesis and description of preferred ligand positions within the active site .
an application is presented basing on a model of an allosteric domain of mglur4 receptor [ 3 ] - a challenging computational task , due to untrivial evolutionary relationships for homology model construction purposes , and shortage of experimental data for hypotheses validation .

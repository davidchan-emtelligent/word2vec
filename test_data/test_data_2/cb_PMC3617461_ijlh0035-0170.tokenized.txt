introduction laboratory diagnosis of von willebrand disease ( vwd ) requires determination of both von willebrand factor ( vwf ) protein levels and activity .
current vwf activity tests include the ristocetin cofactor assay and the collagen - binding assay ( vwf : cb ) .
the goal of this investigation is to characterize a new collagen - binding assay and to determine its effectiveness in identifying vwd .
methods analytical studies were carried out to characterize the performance of a new vwf : cb elisa .
additionally , samples from a normal population were tested as were well - characterized type 1 and type 2 vwd samples .
results repeatability and within - laboratory precision studies resulted in coefficients of variation ( cvs ) of <= 11 % .
a linear range of 1 - 354 % ( 0.01 - 3.54 iu / ml ) was determined , along with a limit of detection and a lower limit of quantitation of 1.6 % and 4.0 % ( 0.016 and 0.04 iu / ml ) , respectively .
samples tested from apparently healthy individuals resulted in a normal range of 54 - 217 % ( 0.54 - 2.17 iu / ml ) .
known vwd type 1 and type 2 samples were also analyzed by the elisa , with 99 % of samples having vwf : cb below the normal reference range and an estimated 96 % sensitivity and 87 % specificity using a vwf collagen - binding / antigen cutoff ratio of 0.50 .
conclusion this new vwf : cb elisa provides an accurate measure of collagen - binding activity that aids in the diagnosis and differentiation of type 1 from type 2 vwd .
collagen binding von willebrand factor von willebrand disease ristocetin cofactor elisa introduction von willebrand disease ( vwd ) is considered the most common inherited bleeding disorder , with conservative estimates of incidence in the general population of around 100 per million persons 1 and up to one in 1000 in the primary care setting 2 .
there are currently six types of defined vwd , as caused by a variety of mutations 3 - 7 .
types 1 and 3 are quantitative defects in von willebrand factor ( vwf ) , with type 1 having reduced levels of functionally normal vwf and type 3 showing virtually absent vwf .
type 2 vwd defines qualitative defects that typically result in low - to - normal levels of vwf but reduced or absent vwf functionality .
type 2 vwd comprises four distinct types : 2a , 2b , 2m , and 2n .
type 2a vwd is characterized by absence of intermediate and high molecular weight ( hmw ) vwf multimers .
type 2b is characterized by increased affinity of vwf to platelets resulting in a loss of hmw multimers .
type 2m vwd demonstrates decreased vwf - dependent platelet adhesion but does not have a deficiency of hmw multimers .
finally , type 2n is classified by reduced binding affinity of vwf to factor viii ( fviii ) 6,7 .
diagnosis of vwd is made in individuals with personal and family histories of mucocutaneous bleeding and confirmed with laboratory testing .
as there are different types of vwd , no single test is sufficient for diagnosis , and testing of both vwf antigen and function must be performed .
using any of the various assays in isolation increases the risk of misdiagnosis 8 .
vwf protein ( antigen ; vwf : ag ) levels are determined by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) or immunoturbidimetric methods .
the ratio of vwf activity to antigen is useful in determining vwd subtypes 10 .
fviii functional testing ( fviii : c ) , usually by clot - based assays , can aid in diagnosing vwd , as vwf binds fviii in vivo and acts as a carrier protein .
additionally , multimer analysis , as it provides visualization of the vwf multimers , aids in the classification of vwd , particularly type 2 4 .
vwf activity assays include the ristocetin cofactor assay ( vwf : rco ) and the collagen - binding assay ( vwf : cb ) , as well as a number of new assays in development 11 .
the vwf : rco assay was the first activity assay introduced commercially and is currently the most common method of measuring vwf activity .
ristocetin , an antibiotic , induces vwf - mediated agglutination of fresh or formalin - fixed platelets .
in this assay , levels of agglutination with patient samples are compared to a reference plasma sample containing known vwf : rco activity 4 .
the vwf : rco assay has significant limitations .
high variability in the vwf : rco assay has been reported as well as low sensitivity 12 and a lower limit of detection of approximately 20 % vwf in many laboratories 13 .
in addition , a not uncommon mutation in the a1 domain of the vwf gene in certain ethnic groups results in decreased vwf : rco , even though patients may lack bleeding symptoms and other tests are commonly found to be normal 14 .
in part due to the limitations of the vwf : rco assay , a number of investigators have evaluated the diagnostic capabilities of the vwf : cb 11,15 - 23 .
the elisa - based vwf : cb assay uses collagen ( usually type i or iii alone or in combination ) immobilized on a microplate .
diluted patient samples are added and incubated , followed by detection of bound vwf by addition of an anti - vwf conjugate .
a substrate is added , then quantitation is performed on a plate reader , and values are obtained based on a reference curve .
the use of the vwf : cb assay has resulted in a substantial reduction ( upwards of 50 %) in the diagnostic error rate when used in addition to the vwf : rco assay 9,13 .
furthermore , the vwf : cb to vwf : ag ratio was more specific for the identification of samples with a type 2 multimer pattern than the vwf : rco to vwf : ag ratio 8 .
the vwf : cb assay therefore could result in a significant reduction in the number of multimer assays required to characterize the type of vwd which is advantageous because multimer analysis is time - consuming , expensive , and only performed in a few laboratories 8 .
a recent study by the north american specialized coagulation laboratory association ( nascola ; 24 identified a high error rate by participants performing multimer analysis , such that 5 % of laboratories reported false loss of hmw vwf multimers in normal samples , 18 % reported false loss of high - or medium - and hmw multimers in type 1 vwd samples , and 22 % reported a false normal multimer pattern in type 2a vwd samples .
in this same study , type 2 vwd samples were correctly identified by all laboratories using vwf : cb to vwf : ag ratios but by only one - third of laboratories using vwf : rco to vwf : ag ratios .
recently , six different commercial vwf : cb assays were characterized 17 .
as a follow - up to this study , the current report further describes one of those assays ( elisacheck ( tm ) collagen binding assay ; precision biologic , dartmouth , canada ) which specifically was identified to yield more favorable discrimination of type 1 and 2 vwd .
in the current report , analytical parameters such as precision , limit of detection and quantitation , and linear range are presented , as well as an analysis of a large number of normal and well - characterized type 1 and type 2 vwd samples .
the results reconfirm that this new assay is a valuable aid in the detection of vwd and the discrimination between type 1 and type 2 vwd .

100 of 101 ( 99 %) of known vwd samples had a vwf : cb activity below the lower limit of the normal reference interval ( figure 1a ) .
thus , the assay was able to differentiate vwd samples from normal samples .
to further analyze type 1 vs. type 2 vwd , vwf : ag levels were determined for each sample and vwf : cb to vwf : ag ratios calculated ( figure 1b ) .
using a cutoff ratio of 0.5 established by standard roc analysis ( table 3 ) , type 1 and type 2 vwd samples were clearly identified , with an estimated sensitivity to type 2 ( from type 1 ) of 95.9 % and a specificity of 86.5 % ( table 4 ) .

discussion in the current study , we have further evaluated one of the best performing vwf : cb assays in terms of type 1 vs. type 2 vwd discrimination 17 to a level of detail not previously provided for a vwf : cb assay .
this study was designed to evaluate this new collagen - binding elisa to establish both analytical and clinical assay parameters and to determine its usefulness in aiding in the diagnosis of vwd .
the assay demonstrated good precision ( repeatability and within - laboratory precision ) with a linear range of 1 - 354 % ( 0.01 - 3.54 iu / ml ) and a lower limit of quantitation to 4.0 % ( 0.04 iu / ml ) .
the normal reference range was 54 - 217 % ( 0.54 - 2.17 iu / ml ) .
additionally , the vwf : cb assay was very effective in differentiating vwd samples from healthy samples .
finally , a comparison of known type 1 and type 2 vwd samples was undertaken using the vwf : cb assay and vwf : ag levels .
standard roc analysis suggested a cutoff of 0.5 .
using this vwf : cb to vwf : ag ratio cutoff , good discrimination between the two subtypes was seen , further suggesting that the assay can be used to distinguish type 1 from type 2 vwd .
vwf binds to exposed collagen upon damage to the vascular surface , resulting in an activation of vwf , which then enables platelet glycoprotein ib / v / ix recognition ( reviewed in 29 ) .
vwf binds to collagen through its a3 domain , while the vwf a1 domain is involved in ristocetin - induced platelet activation 30 .
therefore , although both vwf : rco and vwf : cb assays assess vwf activity , they do so through different mechanisms .
due to superior performance of the vwf : cb assay ( lower assay variability , lower limit of detection , and better sensitivity to loss of hmw multimers ) , it has been suggested that the vwf : cb and vwf : ag combination would be preferable to the vwf : rco and vwf : ag combination for those laboratories that want to perform only one vwf functional assay 31 .
the vwf : cb to vwf : ag ratio was found to be more accurate in terms of identifying type 2 vwd than the vwf : rco to vwf : ag ratio in a recent nascola report and in another published study by adcock et al .
8,24 .
addition of the vwf : cb assay also improved diagnostic accuracy in an australasian - based quality study 9 .
in this study , laboratories using a vwf : rco assay without the vwf : cb assay were seven times more likely to misidentify type 1 vwd as type 2 .
similarly , laboratories were three times more likely to misidentify type 2 as type 1 or type 3 and four times more likely to misidentify normal patients as having vwd if they used the vwf : rco assay in the absence of the vwf : cb assay .
ultimately , thorough vwd testing should include measurement of vwf levels ( vwf : ag ) and determination of each aspect of function : specifically , the interaction with platelet glycoprotein 1b ( vwf : rco ) , as well as subendothelium - collagen interactions ( vwf : cb ) , evaluation of fviii activity , and in some circumstances multimer analysis 32 .
in conclusion , proper identification and typing of vwd requires a panel of assays to allow the best patient care and therapeutic management 33 .
the vwf : cb assay characterized in this study is a valuable addition to the current vwd diagnostic toolbox .

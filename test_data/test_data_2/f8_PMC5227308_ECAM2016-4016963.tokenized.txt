the aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of puerarin loaded carboxymethyl chitosan microspheres ( pue - ccms ) .
the differences in pharmacokinetics parameters of rats after intragastric administration of pue - ccms and puerarin were investigated using hplc .
to assess the protective effect of pue - ccms on myocardial injury in rats , serum levels of creatine kinase ( ck ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) , total superoxide dismutase ( t - sod ) , and malondialdehyde ( mda ) were measured , in addition to pathological examinations and immunohistochemical staining .
our present study has shown that the auc0 - t , cmax , tmax , mrt0 - t of pue - ccms , and puerarin were 20.176 mg.h / l , 3.778 mug / ml , 1 h , 4.634 h and 9.474 mg.h / l , 2.618 mug / ml , 0.542 h , and 3.241 h , respectively .
pue - ccms alleviated myocardial ischemic injury .
pretreatment with pue - ccms could significantly decrease ck , ldh , and mda levels and increase t - sod level in the serum .
pue - ccms downregulated expression of the bcl - 2 associated x protein ( bax ) and upregulated b - cell lymphoma - 2 ( bcl - 2 ) expression .
compared with puerarin group , the pue - ccms group could improve the oral bioavailability of puerarin .
the protective effect of pue - ccms against myocardial injury was significantly greater than puerarin at the same dose .
in summary , pue - ccms should be a qualified and promising candidate as a new oral preparation of puerarin .

introduction ischemic heart disease ( ihd ) is caused by the imbalance between coronary flow and myocardial demand due to coronary circulation and represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the world [ 1 ] .
therefore , the need for a drug effective in the treatment of ischemic heart disease is apparent .
radix puerariae is the root of pueraria lobata ( willd. ) ohwi .
puerarin ( 7,4 ' - dihydroxyisoflavone - 8beta - glucopyranoside , figure 1 ) is a major active ingredient of radix puerariae [ 2 , 3 ] .
a large number of pharmacological studies have indicated that puerarin has a protective effect upon the cardiovascular system .
therefore , it is commonly used in the treatment of coronary heart disease , high blood pressure , and related diseases [ 4 - 6 ] .
due to poor water solubility and low oral bioavailability , intravenous injection remains the main drug delivery method [ 7 - 9 ] .
however , due to the short elimination half - life in human beings , it is necessary to administer frequent or high doses , which leads to severe side effects and restricts its clinical application [ 10 , 11 ] .
thus , oral formulation with improved absorption of puerarin has attracted widespread attention .
chitosan is a promising candidate of drug delivery systems because of its nontoxicity , high biocompatibility , biological adhesion , and biodegradability [ 12 ] .
however , chitosan only can be dissolved in acidic conditions , which limits its application [ 13 ] .
carboxymethyl chitosan , a water soluble derivative of chitosan , can drastically increase the solubility of chitosan at neutral ph values without affecting its characteristic properties [ 14 ] .
for these advantages , carboxymethyl chitosan has received much attention for its potential applications to drug delivery systems .
in the early study , the preparation of glutaraldehyde cross - linked , pue - ccms was optimized by central composite design - response surface methodology [ 15 ] .
in this study , we evaluated the pharmacokinetic parameters of puerarin in normal rats after intragastric administration of a single dose of pue - ccms in comparison to the performance of puerarin under the same conditions .
secondly , we investigated the protective effect of pue - ccms and puerarin against myocardial injury under the same dose and conducted preliminary study on the mechanisms through which pue - ccms protect against myocardial injury .

3.2 .
pharmacodynamics 3.2.1 .
myocardial tissue pathology he - stained images showed that cardiomyocytes in the control group ( figure 5 ( a )) were arranged in an orderly manner , whereas the model group ( figure 5 ( b )) revealed marked infiltration of inflammatory cells and loss of striations with nuclear changes .
the positive control group ( figure 5 ( c )) showed clear striations and a small amount of inflammatory cell infiltration .
compared with model group , pue - ccms group displayed a significant decrease in the area of infiltrating inflammatory cells ( figure 5 ( d )) , while the puerarin group did not display a significant decrease ( figure 5 ( e )) .

the pue - ccms group displayed significantly increased levels of bcl - 2 and decreased levels of bax in comparison to the model group .
4. discussion in recent years , the puerarin oral preparation has received the attention of researchers .
the researchers used different methods to prepare puerarin oral preparation , for example , puerarin microemulsion and nanoparticles [ 5 , 16 ] .
at present , most of the researchers have studied the pharmacokinetics of puerarin oral preparation ; however , there are few studies on pharmacodynamics of puerarin oral preparation .
therefore , this study not only studies the pharmacokinetics of pue - ccms but also makes a preliminary evaluation on the pharmacodynamics of pue - ccms .
related studies have shown that cmcs displays characteristics of biological adhesion and penetration .
as a drug carrier , it can prolong the drug retention time in the body and improve the bioavailability of drugs .
the main mechanism is the following two aspects : first , the amino group and carboxyl group in the cmcs molecule can react with glycoprotein in mucus to form hydrogen bonds , which produce its adhesive characteristics .
secondly , carboxymethyl chitosan enhances the permeability of intestinal epithelia by opening the tight junctions between cells , thereby favoring paracellular drug transport [ 17 ] .
in this study , we compared the pharmacokinetic parameters of puerarin in normal rats after single dose intragastric administration of pue - ccms and puerarin .
compared with the puerarin group , the auc0 - t , cmax , tmax , and mrt0 - t of the pue - ccms group were increased significantly , and the cl and vz were significantly decreased. through the calculation , we found that the absolute bioavailability of pue - ccms was 8.96 % , and the relative bioavailability was 212.96 % .
the results of pharmacokinetics study show that pue - ccms may delay the release of puerarin and increase the oral bioavailability of puerarin .
animal models of simulating human ischemic heart disease have made considerable contributions in the treatment and prevention of ischemic heart disease .
isoproterenol ( iso ) is a synthetic catecholamine and a beta - adrenergic receptor agonist , which leads to biochemical and structural changes that cause myocardial injury .
iso - induced myocardial injury is considered as one of the most widely used experimental model .
however , some studies indicated that estrogen can protect the heart from ischemic injury ; this means that estrogen would have affected the experimental results if we use the female rats [ 18 ] .
so we used the male rats to build the acute myocardial ischemia induced by iso in this study .
growing evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species ( ros ) play an important role in cardiovascular diseases and that the accumulation of ros in mitochondria can lead to apoptotic cell death [ 19 ] .
the bcl - 2 family is a major regulator of mitochondrial permeability , including proapoptotic proteins and antiapoptotic proteins .
the proapoptotic protein bax triggers the release of proapoptotic factors into the cytoplasm , thereby inducing cell apoptosis ; on the other hand , bcl - 2 forms heterodimers with proapoptotic proteins and inhibits cell apoptosis [ 20 ] .
puerarin has already been proven to exhibit potent free - radical scavenging activity due to its antioxidant properties [ 21 ] .
in this study , pue - ccms were demonstrated to aid in the alleviation of myocardial ischemic injury .
pretreatment with pue - ccms decreased ck , ldh , and mda levels and increased t - sod level in the serum .
pue - ccms downregulated expression of the proapoptotic protein bax and upregulated bcl - 2 expression .
the results indicate that pue - ccms produced an effect superior to that of puerarin suspension at the same dose , and protective effect of pue - ccms may be related to its antioxidant effects .
however , there are still some deficiencies in this study .
future investigations are necessary to determine the pharmacokinetics of microspheres in the pathological model of rats and the antioxidant molecular mechanism of pue - ccms in vitro .
5. conclusions in summary , the pue - ccms should be considered a qualified and promising candidate in a new oral preparation of puerarin .

vitamin d deficiency has been related to metabolic syndrome ( mets ) in polycystic ovary syndrome ( pcos ) .
the vitamin d - binding protein ( dbp ) is the main protein involved in vitamin d transport .
two single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) of the dbp gene , rs4588 and rs7041 , have been associated with low circulating levels of 25 - hydroxyvitamin d [ 25 ( oh ) d ] in various populations , but not in women with pcos .
therefore , we determined the genotype and haplotype distribution of dbp gene polymorphisms and investigated the associations between these genetic variants and their haplotypes with pcos , mets , and 25 ( oh ) d levels in women with pcos and controls from the south of brazil .
the sample included 291 women ( 191 with pcos and 100 controls ) .
all participants were genotyped for polymorphisms rs2282679 , rs4588 , and rs7041 .
serum 25 ( oh ) d levels were determined in a subset of 102 participants .
women with pcos were younger and had significantly higher body mass index , blood pressure , and insulin resistance than the control group ( p < 0.05 ) .
the prevalence of mets in pcos and controls was 26.5 % and 4.8 % respectively .
levels of 25 ( oh ) d were lower in pcos women with mets , even after adjustment for age ( p = 0.033 ) .
no associations were observed between pcos and the polymorphisms or their haplotypes .
a higher frequency of genotype tt of rs7041 was found in pcos participants with mets ( or : 2.21 , 95 % ci : 1.08 - 4.52 ; p = 0.027 ) .
this same genotype was associated with lower 25 ( oh ) d levels in both pcos and control women ( or : 4.40 , 95 % ci : 1.62 - 12.00 ; p = 0.002 ) .
in conclusion , these findings indicate that dbp gene polymorphisms and their haplotypes are not directly associated with pcos .
in contrast , the tt genotype of snp rs7041 was associated with mets in pcos women , and with lower 25 ( oh ) d levels in both pcos and control groups .

introduction polycystic ovary syndrome ( pcos ) , a heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic anovulation and manifestations of hyperandrogenism [ 1 , 2 ] , affects between 9 % and 18 % of women of reproductive age , depending on diagnostic criteria [ 1 - 3 ] .
women with pcos suffer from metabolic abnormalities , including insulin resistance ( ir ) , obesity , and metabolic syndrome ( mets ) [ 4 - 6 ] .
accumulating evidence suggests that vitamin d deficiency is associated with ir and mets in pcos [ 7 ] .
vitamin d deficiency may also be linked to central obesity , lipid profile , and body mass index ( bmi ) in these women [ 7 - 13 ] .
both the vitamin d receptor ( vdr ) and the vitamin d - binding protein ( dbp ) play a key role in vitamin d metabolism .
vdr is expressed in many tissues and organs , such as those involved in calcium homeostasis , glucose metabolism , and reproduction [ 14 ] , whereas dbp is the main protein involved in vitamin d transport [ 15 , 16 ] .
two well - studied single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) of the dbp gene , rs4588 and rs7041 , have been previously shown to be strongly associated with low circulating 25 - hydroxyvitamin d [ 25 ( oh ) d ] levels in genome - wide association studies [ 17 , 18 ] and in various populations [ 19 - 24 ] .
although there have been reports about vdr polymorphisms in pcos [ 25 - 27 ] , few studies have focused on dbp gene polymorphisms in women with pcos or androgen excess .
the single work published to date showed similar genotype frequencies of snp rs2282679 in pcos and controls [ 25 ] .
in other populations , polymorphisms of dbp gene were associated with several endocrine and metabolic parameters [ 28 - 30 ] .
therefore , the aim of the present study was to compare the frequency of snps rs2282679 , rs4588 , and rs7041 of the dbp gene and their haplotypes in women with pcos and healthy controls with regular ovulatory cycles from southern brazil .
we also aimed to investigate whether these genetic variants are related to mets and 25 ( oh ) d levels in pcos women .
materials and methods patients participants were enrolled by advertisement in the local media .
the advertisement called for women of reproductive age with excess hair ( hirsutism ) and irregular menses and for volunteers without hirsutism and with regular menses .
the study population comprised 291 women : 191 patients with pcos and 100 non - hirsute women with regular ovulatory cycles ( confirmed by progesterone levels higher than 3.8 ng / ml ) .
diagnostic investigation was performed for all enrolled participants at a university hospital ( hospital de clinicas de porto alegre , state of rio grande do sul ) .
rotterdam criteria were used for the diagnosis of pcos , which was defined in the presence of two out of three of the following traits : 1 ) oligo / amenorrhea and / or chronic anovulation (<= 9 cycles / year and / or luteal phase progesterone <= 3.8 ng / ml ) , 2 ) clinical and / or biochemical hyperandrogenism , and 3 ) polycystic ovary appearance on ultrasound examination .
exclusion criteria were presence of hyperandrogenic disorders , having used drugs known to interfere with hormone levels ( such as oral contraceptive pills , antiandrogens , progestins , metformin , fibrates , or statins ) for 3 or more months before the study , pregnancy , liver disease , or kidney disease .
approval for this study was obtained from the institutional review board at hospital de clinicas de porto alegre .
written informed consent was obtained from all participants .
study protocol anthropometric measurements included bmi and waist circumference ( wc ) .
blood pressure ( bp ) was measured twice after a 10 - minute rest [ 4 , 5 , 31 - 33 ] .
hirsutism was defined as a modified ferriman - gallwey score [ 34 ] >= 8 .
homeostasis model assessment index to estimate insulin resistance ( homa - ir ) was calculated by multiplying insulin ( miu / ml ) by glucose ( mmol / l ) and dividing this product by 22.5 [ 35 ] .
joint scientific statement criteria were used to define mets [ 36 ] .
laboratory measurements blood samples for determination of hormone levels were drawn from an antecubital vein after a 12 - h overnight fast , between 8:00 and 10:00 am. samples were obtained between the 2nd and 10th days of the cycle , or on any day in amenorrheic women .
blood samples were also collected for genomic dna extraction .
total cholesterol ( tc ) , high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hdl - c ) , triglycerides ( tg ) , and fasting glucose levels were determined by colorimetric - enzymatic methods ( siemens advia 1650 , deerfield , usa ) .
low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl - c ) was estimated indirectly with the friedewald formula [ 37 ] .
total testosterone and insulin levels were measured by chemiluminescence ( siemens advia centaur xp , deerfield , usa ) .
serum 25 ( oh ) d levels were measured in a subset of 102 women by a chemiluminescence assay ( liaison , diasorin , saluggia , italy ) with sensitivity of <= 4.0 ng / ml and intra - and inter - assay cv of 7.7 % and 10.9 % , respectively .
genotype analysis genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes [ 38 ] .
dna samples were diluted to 2 ng / ml. duplicate measurements were performed in 10 % of the samples to assess the internal quality of genotype data .
molecular genotyping for rs4588 ( substitution of c for a ) , rs7041 ( substitution of t for g ) , and rs2282679 ( substitution of a for c ) was performed through real - time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) ( 7500 fast real - time polymerase chain reaction system , applied biosystems , california , usa ) , using the allelic discrimination assay with taqman mgb primers and probes ( applied biosystems , california , usa ) .
statistical analysis data distribution was assessed by kolmogorov - smirnov test and descriptive statistics .
results are expressed as mean +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) for normally distributed variables , as median and interquartile range for variables with a non - gaussian distribution , or as absolute numbers and percentages .
non - gaussian variables were log - transformed for statistical analysis and back - transformed into their original units for reporting .
unpaired two - tailed student 's t - test was used to compare group means .
pearson 's chi - square test ( chi2 ) was applied to test categorical variables and the agreement of genotype frequencies with hardy - weinberg equilibrium .
haplotypes were constructed from the combination of the rs4588 and rs7041 polymorphisms .
lewontin 's d ' statistic for linkage disequilibrium was calculated for each pair of polymorphisms .
linkage disequilibrium was inferred using the phase 2.1.1 software [ 39 ] , which employs bayesian statistics .
this software was also used to compare haplotype frequencies in pcos and control women by permutation testing .
data were considered as statistically significant at p < 0.05 .
the statistical package for the social sciences 18 ( spss , chicago , il ) was used for analyses .
results participants were mostly white ( 93.9 %) , and some ( 6.1 %) had mixed african and european ancestry .
clinical characteristics of the sample are shown in table 1 .
the mean age of pcos and control participants was 22.89 +/ - 6.66 and 25.18 +/ - 7.72 years respectively ( p = 0.013 , student 's t test ) .
as expected , women with pcos had significantly higher bmi , wc , bp , homa - ir , triglycerides , ferriman - gallwey score , and total testosterone , as well as lower hdl - c than controls ( p < 0.05 for all variables , student 's t test ) .
mets was more frequent in pcos participants ( p < 0.001 , pearson 's chi2 test ) .

serum 25 ( oh ) d levels were measured in a subset of participants ( 54 pcos and 48 controls ) who had an extra serum aliquot available for this measurement .
participants with and without measured 25 ( oh ) d levels were similar regarding bmi ( p = 0.545 ) , homa - ir ( p = 0.110 ) , and presence of mets ( p = 0.540 ) .
the mean 25 ( oh ) d concentration in the subset was 21.48 +/ - 7.25 ng / ml. only 12.7 % of this subset had adequate circulating levels of 25 ( oh ) d (>= 30 ng / ml ) .
in 45.1 % , 25 ( oh ) d levels were insufficient ( 20 - 29 ng / ml ) , and 42.2 % had vitamin d deficiency (< 20 ng / ml ) .
sufficient vitamin d status was similar in the pcos and control women included in the subset ( 14.8 % vs. 10.4 % respectively ) .
also , 25 ( oh ) d values were similarly low in both subset groups ( 21.50 +/ - 6.90 , controls and 21.47 +/ - 7.61 , pcos ; p = 0.985 ) .
a separate analysis of the subset pcos group revealed lower vitamin d levels in women with mets ( p = 0.018 , student 's t test ) , even after adjustment for age ( p = 0.033 ) ( fig 1 ) .

the rs4588 - rs7041 haplotype is grouped by presence of the risk haplotype .
polymorphism rs4588 ( c - - > a ) was in linkage disequilibrium with rs7041 ( t - - > g ) (| d '| = 1 ; r2 = 0.44 ) .
three haplotypes were inferred in the sample : ct , cg , and at , formally called gc - 1f , gc - 1s , and gc - 2 respectively .
the first letter of each haplotype refers to snp rs4588 and the second to snp rs7041 .
haplotype frequencies were 0.21 for ct , 0.53 for cg , and 0.26 for at. the three common haplotype variants ( ct , cg , and at ) formed six diplotypes : ct - ct , ct - cg , cg - cg , cg - at , ct - at , and at - at , with frequencies of 0.06 , 0.21 , 0.30 , 0.25 , 0.09 , and 0.09 respectively .
taking into consideration the results of individual polymorphism analyses and previous data from the literature [ 19 - 24 ] , at was regarded as the risk haplotype and cg as the protective haplotype against lower 25 ( oh ) d concentrations .
therefore , we grouped haplotype combinations accordingly : cg cg + ct cg , cg at + ct ct , and ct at + at at. haplotype frequencies were similar in pcos and control groups ( table 2 ) .
when all participants were analyzed ( pcos and controls ) , 69.6 % of the women carrying the tt genotype of rs7041 were deficient in vitamin d (< 20 ng / ml ) and 30.4 % presented vitamin d levels >= 20 ng / ml ( or : 4.402 , 95 % ci : 1.62 - 12.00 ; p = 0.002 , pearson 's chi2 test ) .
conversely , vitamin d status was similar for polymorphisms rs2282679 and rs4588 and haplotype variants ( fig 2 ) .

this was not observed for rs2282679 , rs4588 , and the rs4588 - rs7041 haplotype , whose frequencies were similar in pcos participants with or without mets ( fig 3 ) .

discussion in the present study , the frequency of snps rs2282679 , rs4588 , and rs7041 of the dbp gene and their haplotypes was similar in women with pcos and healthy controls with regular ovulatory cycles from southern brazil .
in turn , polymorphism rs7041 in the dbp gene was related to lower 25 ( oh ) d levels in the overall group and to mets in pcos - - women with pcos carrying the tt genotype of rs7041 were twice as likely to present mets .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report to show an association between mets and polymorphism rs7041 in a pcos population .
our results also show that 25 ( oh ) d levels were lower in pcos participants with mets .
a recent meta - analysis has reported that vitamin d levels are indeed related to metabolic and hormonal disturbances in pcos women .
in that study , women with pcos and vitamin d deficiency were more likely to have dysglycemia compared to those without vitamin d deficiency [ 11 ] .
in addition , a study comparing pcos women and controls showed that vitamin d levels were lower in participants with both pcos and mets compared to those with pcos but without mets .
furthermore , vitamin d levels decreased as the number of risk factors for mets increased [ 12 ] .
moreover , in pcos women , lower vitamin d levels have been correlated with clinical traits , insulin resistance measures , and lipid profile [ 8 , 12 , 13 ] .
only a few studies have assessed snps rs4588 and rs7041 in relation to metabolic parameters in other populations .
some studies have shown an association of polymorphisms in exon 11 with circulating levels of insulin and homa - ir [ 28 ] and with glucose levels [ 29 ] in non - diabetic individuals .
nevertheless , these polymorphisms have not been associated with type 2 diabetes [ 29 , 30 ] .
regarding polymorphisms rs4588 and rs7041 and vitamin d levels , one study reported no interaction between 25 ( oh ) d and snps of dbp [ 40 ] , while another showed a marginal interaction of 25 ( oh ) d deficiency with rs7041 in white subjects [ 41 ] .
in adult and elderly populations , two studies with chinese participants have shown that both snps rs4588 and rs7041 , as well as the at - at haplotype , were related to lower 25 ( oh ) d levels [ 22 , 23 ] .
similar results were reported in canadian young adults [ 20 ] and elderly caucasians [ 42 ] .
finally , lower 25 ( oh ) d concentrations have been observed in premenopausal white women [ 19 ] and early postmenopausal women [ 43 ] carrying the aa genotype of rs4588 and the tt genotype of rs7041 .
taken together , data from the literature and the present results showing an association between the tt genotype of rs7041 and vitamin d deficiency support the hypothesis that this dbp gene variant is related to 25 ( oh ) d concentrations .
in addition , the main finding of this study - - that polymorphism rs7041 in the dbp gene is related to metabolic syndrome in pcos and to lower 25 ( oh ) d levels in the overall group - - might signal a genetic link between metabolic disturbances in pcos and low vitamin d levels .
in a previous study with 545 austrian women with pcos aged 16 - 45 years , no higher risk of pcos was found in association with genotypes of rs2282679 .
however , anthropometric variables and lipid profile differed significantly among rs2282679 genotypes [ 25 ] .
in contrast , we did not find associations between mets and rs2282679 genotypes .
ethnic differences between the two populations , as well as the older age of participants in the study by wehr et al .
[ 25 ] , may explain this disagreement .
the dbp gene encodes a multifunctional plasma transport protein , dbp , also known as a group - specific component , synthesized in the liver .
dbp binds and transports vitamin d and its metabolites to target tissues .
dbp exerts important biological functions , including the binding of mainly monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids [ 15 ] .
a link between obesity and vitamin d has been described in pcos [ 8 ] and in other populations [ 44 - 49 ] .
the relationship with dbp is , however , less clear .
in elderly men , a positive relationship has been described between dbp concentrations and bmi [ 50 ] .
however , this association has not been confirmed in women aged 18 - 44 years [ 51 ] .
overall , the mechanisms underlying this association are still unknown , but deserve further investigation .
it should also be noted that polymorphisms rs4588 and rs7041 , which are located in exon 11 , were in linkage disequilibrium , making it difficult to discern the best single snp surrogate to detect genetic variability for this region .
indeed , rs4588 and rs7041 , described as having an association with 25 ( oh ) d levels , were in linkage disequilibrium in a healthy population of girls from southern brazil [ 24 ] .
one strength of our study is the focus on a less well represented ethnic group , pcos women from southern brazil .
conversely , a limitation was the relatively small sample size of 291 participants , which does not allow supplemental analyses .
however , the effect sizes observed in our sample are similar to those reported in other pcos populations .
another limitation was the lack of data on dbp levels of participants .
nevertheless , dbp gene polymorphism seems to have no effect on the relationship between 25 ( oh ) d and parathyroid hormone in infants and toddlers [ 21 ] .
other possible limitations are the lack of data on dietary vitamin d intake and daily sun exposure , even though it is well recognized that , below a latitude of approximately 35degrees , uvb radiation is sufficient for year - round vitamin d synthesis [ 52 ] ; furthermore , the season of blood collection seems not to interfere with vitamin d levels , as we have previously shown in another group living in the same region as the present sample [ 24 ] .
while dbp measurements were not available in the present study , previous studies have shown that dbp levels are associated with dbp gene polymorphisms [ 43 , 53 ] and positively correlated with 25 ( oh ) d levels [ 21 ] .
conclusions the present study is the first to describe that genotype tt of snp rs7041 is associated with mets in pcos and with lower 25 ( oh ) d levels in both pcos and healthy controls with regular ovulatory cycles .
our results indicate that polymorphisms rs2282679 , rs4588 , and rs7041 of the dbp gene , as well as their haplotypes , are not related to pcos in southern brazilian women .
further studies in pcos populations of different ethnicities are needed to confirm these findings .

background selective breeding programmes , based on prion protein ( prp ) genotype , have been introduced throughout the european union to reduce the risk of sheep transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ( tses ) .
these programmes could have negative consequences on other important traits , such as fitness and production traits , if the prp gene has pleiotropic effects or is in linkage disequilibrium with genes affecting these traits .
this paper presents the results of an investigation into associations between lamb survival and prp genotype in ten mainstream sheep breeds in great britain ( gb ) .
in addition , the reasons for lamb deaths were examined in order to identify any associations between these and prp genotype .
results survival times from birth to weaning were analysed for over 38000 lambs ( 2427 dead and 36096 live lambs ) from 128 flocks using cox proportional hazard models for each breed , including additive animal genetic effects .
no significant associations between prp genotype and lamb survival were identified , except in the charollais breed for which there was a higher risk of mortality in lambs of the arr / vrq genotype compared with those of the arr / arr genotype .
significant effects of birth weight , litter size , sex , age of dam and year of birth on survival were also identified .
for all breeds the reasons for death changed significantly with age ; however , no significant associations between reason for death and prp genotype were found for any of the breeds .
conclusion this study found no evidence to suggest that a selective breeding programme based on prp genotype will have a detrimental effect on lamb survival .
the only significant effect of prp genotype identified was likely to be of little consequence because an increased risk of mortality was associated with a genotype that is selected against in current breeding strategies .
background large - scale selective breeding programmes have been introduced throughout the european union to reduce the risk of sheep transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ( tses ) and , in particular , the risk to human health posed by the possible presence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) in sheep [ 1 ] .
these programmes exploit a strong host genetic component at the ovine prion protein ( prp ) gene , which influences both the risk of infection and the incubation period for scrapie [ 2 - 4 ] .
they aim to decrease the frequency of high risk alleles ( arq and vrq ) and increase the frequency of the major low risk allele ( arr ) .
concerns have been expressed , however , that such large - scale breeding programmes based on one specific factor ( in this case , prp genotype ) could have detrimental side - effects on sheep performance .
these concerns stem from farmers' assertions that sheep carrying high - risk genotypes are more hardy or perform better than their flock - mates which carry low - risk genotypes [ 5,6 ] , and from the hypothesis that the high - risk vrq allele is maintained in the sheep population because it confers a selective advantage in a scrapie - free environment [ 7 ] .
such a situation could arise if the prp gene has a pleiotropic effect on , or is in linkage disequilibrium with , production or survival traits .
to date there have been numerous studies examining associations between production traits and prp genotype [ 8 - 14 ] , none of which has found any consistent or clear relationships .
less attention has been given to investigating associations between survival traits and prp genotype .
one study found that animals of susceptible prp genotypes had a shorter life expectancy in scrapie - affected flocks , even if they did not succumb to clinical disease [ 15 ] .
more recently , a study of survival in lambs of the scottish blackface breed found that animals carrying the arq allele had higher postnatal survival than lambs carrying the arr or ahq alleles , both of which are associated with a lower risk of clinical disease [ 16 ] .
in this paper , we report the results of an investigation into associations between lamb survival and prp genotype in ten mainstream sheep breeds in great britain ( gb ) .
these breeds were drawn from all sectors of the british sheep industry , from hardy hill breeds to those raised in less hostile environments , and include some of the most important commercial breeds .
the aim of the study was not to estimate or compare absolute lamb mortality in the different breeds , rather it was to identify factors influencing relative mortality within individual breeds , in particular , prp genotype .
in addition to lamb survival , we also examined the reason for lamb deaths in order to identify any associations between these and prp genotype .
methods breeds included in study the ten sheep breeds included in the study ( table 1 ) were selected to cover the different sectors of the british sheep industry ( see , for example , [ 17 ]) .
the hill breeds ( beulah speckled face , scottish blackface , north country cheviot , welsh mountain ) , which are kept in the harsh hill environment , comprise four of the five most numerous purebreeds and account for 27.5 % of ewes kept in gb. the north country cheviot ( ncc ) breed was subdivided into hill and park types because of differences in terms of proflicacy , size and the environment in which each type is kept .
( the park type produces more twins , tends to be larger and is raised in a less extreme environment than the hill type. ) the bluefaced leicester is the most numerous breed in the longwool sector , and is the predominant sire breed of the crossbred ewe population .
terminal sire rams produce a high proportion of lambs for slaughter ; the texel and the charollais are two of the three most important breeds in this sector , contributing 24.4 % and 7.6 % of all rams in gb , respectively .
finally , the lleyn and the poll dorset breeds represent two of the three most numerous breeds in the self - contained sector ( breeds managed in stand - alone flocks that have developed in a less - extreme environment than the hill breeds ) and account for 1.6 % and 0.6 % of purebred ewes kept in gb , respectively .

all eligible breeders were invited to join the study by letter from signet .
in addition , the study was promoted amongst farmers by telephone and direct contact at breeder meetings .
farmers provided flock details and signed consent forms to release their signet and nsp data to research partners in the study .
prp genotyping tissue samples were taken from dead lambs found by the farmers using tipyfix ( r ) ear tags ( agribiogen biotechnologie gmbh ) .
samples were sent for prp genotyping using proprietary commercial technology to cellmark , part of orchid biosciences europe ltd , under contract to innovis ltd ( formerly cbs technologies ) .
results were collated by innovis ltd and provided to the veterinary laboratories agency ( vla ) .
live lambs were blood sampled by animal health ( formerly state veterinary service ) as part of the nsp on special visits to participating flocks each year .
blood samples were processed and prp genotyped using proprietary commercial technology by cellmark ( 70 %) or lgc ( 30 %) .
all live lambs on farm were sampled , with visits encouraged to take place before replacement lambs had been selected for use in the flock and before lambs were sent for sale or slaughter .
full details of the prp genotypes included in the study for each breed are presented in the additional material ( see additional file 1 ) .
the data - sets for most breeds included at least 50 % of the prp genotypes commonly found in the breed ; those not present in the data - sets tended to be the higher - risk , vrq - bearing genotypes .
data sets lambs from cohorts born in 2004 , 2005 and 2006 were included in the study .
signet provided recorded data on dam , sire , birth weight ( where available ) , litter size born , litter size reared and fostering information for all lambs born in participating flocks .
genotype data for live animals were provided to signet by the nsp administration centre following blood sampling visits to each farm .
the genotypes were matched to signet data using the ear tag provided on the day of sampling .
these data were subsequently provided to the vla via a regular electronic transfer of animal data each year .
data on dead lambs were collected using a submission form , which was linked by barcode to the tissue sample sent for prp genotyping .
data captured on the form included ear tag number , date of birth , date of death , dam identity , sex and the breeder 's opinion of the reason for death .
submission forms were sent to vla , where the data were double - entered onto a database .
the results of the tissue genotyping were returned to innovis by cellmark and provided electronically to the vla , where the prp genotype was matched by barcode to individual animals .
the number of records in each data - set ranged from around 800 lambs for the bluefaced leicester to around 10000 lambs for the texel , and the number of dead lambs varied from 71 for the beulah speckled face to 520 for the charollais ( table 1 ) .
statistical analysis lamb survival times were analysed from birth ( 0 days ) to weaning ( 120 days ) .
weaning was chosen as the end point , because this is an age before which lambs are dispersed , for example , selected as replacements or sent for slaughter or sale .
a total of 204 lambs in the data - set died after 120 days , and these were included in the analyses as censored at 120 days .
survival times were modelled using cox proportional hazard models [ 18 ] , with the baseline hazard stratified by flock and including additive animal genetic effects .
pedigrees were constructed using only the dam and sire information for each lamb .
exploratory analysis produced estimates for the animal - level variance ( sigma2 ) in the range 0.2 to 0.4 for three breeds ( bluefaced leicester , scottish blackface and texel ) ; however , the variance estimate was close to zero (< 0.01 ) for the remaining seven breeds .
this is a consequence of the relatively small number of mortalities available in several of the breeds and the fact that lamb survival is a lowly heritable trait , particularly if only a subsample of all mortalities are recorded .
consequently , the animal - level variance was fixed at sigma2 = 0.2 for all breeds rather than being estimated ; this is similar to estimates obtained in previous studies of lamb survival [ 19 - 21 ] .
survival data were analysed separately for each breed .
two models were constructed : one including birth weight as a fixed effect and one excluding birth weight .
in each case model selection proceeded by stepwise deletion of non - significant ( p > 0.05 ) terms , starting from a model incorporating prp genotype ( see additional file 1 , for details of the prp genotypes included in the analysis for each breed ) , litter size ( 1 / 2 />= 3 ) , sex , age of dam (<= 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 />= 6 years old ) and year of birth as fixed effects , and birth weight as a covariate with both linear and quadratic terms , when included ; animals with missing values for any of these factors were excluded from the analysis .
this was a particular issue for birth weight , where an appreciable number of records were missing data on this factor ( table 1 ) , ranging from 14 % of records for the bluefaced leicester to 52 % for the north country cheviot ( hill ) .
the models were implemented in r [ 22 ] using the kinship package [ 23 ] .
the reason for death supplied by the breeder was coded into one of five classes : lambing - associated ( e.g. stillborn , malpresentation , enclosed in amniotic sac ) ; misfortune ( e.g. taken by predator , drowned ) ; physical ( e.g. mineral deficiency ) ; disease ; or other , including unknown .
potential associations were explored between reason for death and prp genotype , breed , sex , age at death ( coded as : birth ( 0 days ) ; perinatal period ( 1 - 14 days ) ; perinatal period to weaning ( 15 - 120 days ) ; post - weaning (>= 120 days )) and year of birth .
initially , a multinomial log - linear model was constructed including all the above five factors , together with pairwise interactions between breed and the four remaining factors .
model simplification proceeded by stepwise deletion of non - significant terms ( p > 0.05 ) .
the models were implemented in r [ 22 ] using the nnet package [ 24 ] .
results survival times the final models for each breed are presented in the additional material ( see additional file 1 ) ; a summary of the results is presented in table 2 .
for all but one of the breeds , there were no significant associations between prp genotype and lamb survival ( table 2 ) .
there was , however , a significant association in the charollais breed , for which the hazard of death in arr / vrq lambs was 2.7 times greater than that for arr / arr lambs ( hazard ratio ( hr ) : 2.67 ; 95 % confidence limits ( ci ) : 1.31 - 5.44 ) .
there was no significant difference in survival between arr / arq lambs ( the only other genotype reported in the sampled population for this breed ) and arr / arr lambs ( hr : 0.90 ; 95 % ci : 0.71 - 1.15 ) .
this effect was only apparent when birth weight was not included in the analysis , because none of the dead arr / vrq lambs had a birth weight recorded .
a similar , but non - significant , increased risk of mortality in arr / vrq compared to arr / arr lambs was also observed for the lleyn breed ; however , this was not seen for any other breeds in the study .
indeed , there were no consistent patterns in the effects of prp genotype on lamb survival across breeds , whether statistically significant or not .

the risk of mortality decreased with birth weight ; however , for some breeds an increase in risk was also identified for very large lambs ( table 2 ; see also additional file 1 ) .
lambs from larger litters were at greater risk than those from smaller litters .
males were at greater risk than females , while the risk of mortality was highest for lambs born to younger dams (<= 2 years old ) .
reason for death a significant interaction between breed and the remaining four factors was identified in the multinomial log - linear model ; subsequent analyses were performed separately for each breed ( cf. figure 1a ) .
for all breeds reasons for death changed significantly with age ( table 3 ; figure 1b ) .
most lambs that died at birth did so for reasons associated with lambing ( e.g. stillborn , malpresentation ) , while those that died at between one and 14 days old were most likely to die as a result of misfortune ( e.g. taken by a predator or drowned ) .
lambs that died at older ages were more likely to do so for physical causes ( e.g. mineral deficiencies ; 15 - 120 days ) or disease (> 120 days ) .
in addition , there were significant differences in reasons for death between years for the scottish blackface , north country cheviot ( park ) , welsh mountain and texel breeds ( table 3 ) , that is , mainly in extensively reared breeds .
finally , comparing lambing - related deaths with those due to misfortune in the scottish blackface breed showed that male lambs were less likely than females to die due to misfortune ( odds ratio ( or ) : 0.53 ; 95 % ci : 0.33 - 0.83 ) .
importantly , there were no significant associations between reason for death and prp genotype for any of the breeds ( table 3 ) .

similar effects were identified in the present study for each of these factors , though not all of the individual factors were significant for all ten breeds .
the particular focus of this paper , however , was to investigate associations between prp genotype and lamb survival , in order to help assess whether there could be deleterious effects of breeding programmes based on prp genotype selection .
a significant association was identified for the charollais breed , with an increased risk of mortality for lambs carrying the arr / vrq genotype compared with those carrying the arr / arr genotype .
however , the arr / vrq genotype is actively selected against in the nsp [ 30 ] ; its frequency in ram lambs of the charollais breed sampled as part of the nsp is low and decreased from 4.0 % in 2002 to 2.6 % in 2004 [ 31 ] .
hence , it is unlikely that this finding has any important consequences for selective breeding programmes , in general , or the nsp , in particular .
a recent study of lamb survival in two scottish blackface flocks found that lambs carrying the arq allele had higher postnatal survival than those carrying the arr or ahq allele [ 16 ] .
a similar pattern was observed for scottish blackface lambs in the present analysis .
however , this result was not statistically significant ( p = 0.60 ) , and it was not replicated in the model including birth weight .
indeed no significant associations between prp genotype and lamb survival were identified for any of the remaining breeds considered in the study , nor were there any consistent patterns in the effect of prp genotype on lamb survival across breeds .
this lack of consistency between studies suggests that if there is an association between prp genotype and lamb survival it may be due to linkage disequilibrium rather that pleiotropy , or may not be constant across flocks .
although only one significant association between prp genotype and survival was identified , not all prp genotypes commonly found in each breed were represented in this study ( see additional file 1 ) .
this reflects the fact that all participating flocks were members of the nsp and , hence , would have been selecting based on prp genotype and , in particular , against the vrq allele , possibly for several years prior to recruitment [ 31 ] .
consequently , most lambs in the study carried at least one arr allele , while very few carried the vrq allele .
indeed , almost all lambs carrying the vrq allele were of the arr / vrq genotype , though some were also of the arq / vrq genotype .
there were , however , no arh / vrq , ahq / vrq or vrq / vrq carriers and , accordingly , the study could not have identified any associations between lamb survival and these prp genotypes .
biases could be introduced into the data , in terms of factors influencing relative differences in mortality , if selection of live lambs had occurred prior to prp genotyping .
however , the lamb crops on most farms were blood sampled before replacements were selected or lambs were sent for sale or slaughter .
because not every lamb which died on farm will have been detected in the study , biases may also arise if prp genotype was associated with reasons for death that resulted in dead lambs not being found .
it is difficult to assess the impact of this potential bias , though the present study did not identify any associations between the reason for lamb death and prp genotype .
finally , a high proportion of records in the study were right - censored ( i.e. were for lambs surviving beyond 120 days ) .
this could reduce the power of the data - set or the precision of the results , but reflects the level of mortality in the study flocks .
birth weight has often been identified as an important factor for lamb survival [ 25 - 29 ] , including in the present study ( table 2 ) .
however , an appreciable number of records were missing values for this factor .
when birth weight was not included in the analysis , there were changes in the factors that were significantly associated with lamb survival .
in particular , litter size and age of dam were often only included in the final models excluding birth weight ( table 2 ) , most likely reflecting associations between birth weight and these factors [ 14,25,29,32 ] .
the one significant association between prp genotype and lamb survival was identified only when birth weight was not included in the analysis .
this was due to the fact that there were no birth weight records available for the dead arr / vrq lambs , rather than due to an association between prp genotype and birth weight .
indeed , few significant associations with prp and birth weight have been identified [ 10,14,32 ] .
no associations between prp genotype and reason for death were identified in this study ( table 3 ) .
the principal factor influencing the reason for death was the age at which the lamb died .
although previous studies also found that the cause of death in lambs changed with age [ 33 - 35 ] , differences in classifications preclude direct comparison amongst studies .
conclusion this study found no evidence to suggest that a selective breeding programme based on prp genotype will have a detrimental effect on lamb survival , at least for the ten breeds included .
indeed , the only significant effect of prp genotype identified here is likely to be of little consequence , because it found an increased risk of mortality in a genotype ( arr / vrq ) of low frequency that is actively selected against as part of current breeding strategies .

background perceptual illusions play an important role in untangling neural mechanisms underlying conscious phenomena .
the thermal grill illusion ( tgi ) has been suggested as a promising model for exploring percepts involved in neuropathic pain , such as cold - allodynia ( pain arising from contact with innocuous cold ) .
the tgi is an unpleasant / painful sensation from touching juxtapositioned bars of cold and warm innocuous temperatures .
aim to develop an mri - compatible tgi - unit and explore the supraspinal correlates of the illusion , using fmri , in a group of healthy volunteers .
methods we constructed a tgi - thermode allowing the rapid presentation of warm ( 41degreesc ) , cold ( 18degreesc ) and interleaved ( 41degreesc + 18degreesc = tgi ) temperatures in an fmri - environment .
twenty volunteers were tested .
the affective - motivational (" unpleasantness ") and sensory - disciminatory (" pain - intensity ") dimensions of each respective stimulus were rated .
functional images were analyzed at a corrected alpha - level < 0.05 .
results the tgi was rated as significantly more unpleasant and painful than stimulation with each of its constituent temperatures .
also , the tgi was rated as significantly more unpleasant than painful .
thermal stimulation versus neutral baseline revealed bilateral activations of the anterior insulae and fronto - parietal regions .
unlike its constituent temperatures the tgi displayed a strong activation of the right ( contralateral ) thalamus .
exploratory contrasts at a slightly more liberal threshold - level also revealed a tgi - activation of the right mid / anterior insula , correlating with ratings of unpleasantness ( rho = 0.31 ) .
conclusion / significance to the best of our knowledge , this is the first fmri - study of the tgi .
the activation of the anterior insula is consistent with this region 's putative role in processing of homeostatically relevant feeling - states .
our results constitute the first neurophysiologic evidence of thalamic involvement in the tgi .
similar thalamic activity has previously been observed during evoked cold - allodynia in patients with central neuropathic pain .
our results further the understanding of the supraspinal correlates of the tgi - phenomenon and pave the way for future inquiries into if and how it may relate to neuropathic pain .
introduction illusions in the visual and somatosensory domain have contributed considerably to our understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in various conscious processes .
perceptual illusions allow the testing of models for conscious phenomena and - importantly - when coupled to neurophysiological measurements , inferences about the underlying neural substrates .
one such potentially useful sensory illusion is the thermal grill illusion ( tgi ) .
the tgi was first described by torsten thunberg in 1898 [ 1 ] .
it is as an unpleasant , potentially painful , burning sensation that arises when touching an alternating pattern of innocuous cold and warm temperatures .
the quality of tgi phenomenon is related to the burning of cold - pain [ 2 ] as well as the paradoxical heat that can be felt during dynamic cooling of the skin [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
importantly , the tgi uses innocuous temperatures to evoke such sensory manifestations usually attributed to noxious modalities .
the thermal grill has been suggested by craig and colleagues as a model of the burning sensation often experienced by patients with neuropathic pain [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ]. the tgi may for instance be suitable to explore the mechanisms of cold - allodynia , a symptom common in patients with central neuropathic pain of various etiologies .
patients with cold - allodynia report burning sensations when an afflicted area is put in contact with cold objects that otherwise are experienced as simply ' cold ' .
unrelenting spontaneous and / or evoked pain - often having a burning quality - is a common and often treatment - refractory symptom after lesions of the central nervous system [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in such distressful symptoms may translate into improved treatment .
to this end , the tgi has been studied with regard to pharmacologic [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , multi - sensory [ 13 ] and affective [ 14 ] manipulations and , recently , we reported of a putative genetic component relating to variation in thermal - pain sensitivity [ 15 ] .
craig and co - workers have in elaborate neurophysiologic studies in anesthetized cats probed spinal mechanisms relating to the tgi [ 2 ] .
the work shows that simultaneous application of warm and cold temperatures causes an imbalance between firing of spinal neurons reactive to heat , pinch and cold ( hpc ) and those only responsive to cold ( cold ) .
in response to the tgi , hpc - activity increased disproportionately compared to cold .
this suggests that the illusion may arise by the supraspinal integration between the two kinds of thermoafferent signals .
based on a conjecture proposed in 1911 by head and holmes [ 16 ] , craig 's " thermosensory disinhibition hypothesis " [ 17 ] thus states that hpc - activity is centrally inhibited by cold - activity and that the tgi leads to a disinhibition (" unmasking ") of hpc - related percepts [ 5 ] .
craig et al also conducted the thus far only neuroimaging - study of the phenomenon , reported of in 1996 [ 7 ] .
using positron emission tomography ( pet ) imaging the authors demonstrated activation in the mid / anterior insular cortex in response to thermal stimuli .
the authors also suggested a crucial role for the anterior cingulate cortex ( acc ) in the tgi .
the notion of the acc - activity as a necessary condition in pain - processing is , however , not settled .
such interpretations are , for example , challenged by later studies suggesting an involvement in response selection rather than actual pain perception [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
in addition , other studies point to an important role of thalamic hyperactivity in evoked cold - allodynia [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , not observed in this early pet - study of the tgi - phenomenon .
further investigation of the supraspinal mechanism involved in the illusion is therefore warranted .
this is important in evaluating if and how the tgi permits modeling of phenomena involved in pathological pain - states .
methodologically , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) has certain advantages over pet in studies of functional brain - activity .
pet can only yield intermittent measures of activity integrated over some 30 - 60 seconds , whereas fmri yields more continuous measures for extended periods of experimentation .
this has led to a vastly improved ability to collect statistically valid spatiotemporal data on human brain function .
an important step towards attaining an increased mechanistic understanding of the tgi is therefore the development of an fmri - compatible tgi - unit .
this , however , implies certain technical challenges as a stimulus system for use in an fmri - environment needs to be non - ferromagnetic and not emit any radio - frequent noise that potentially could interfere with the mri - signals .
in addition , it is an experimental prerequisite that the system provides rapid and reliable response - times when shifting between the various stimulus conditions .
the aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate such an mri - compatible tgi - unit and image the supraspinal correlates of the illusion in a cohort of healthy volunteers .
we made several modifications to a tgi - thermode employed in a recently reported study [ 15 ] to meet the requirements imposed by fmri .
twenty - healthy volunteers were recruited .
the affective - motivational ( i.e. " unpleasantness ") and sensory - discriminatory ( i.e. " pain - intensity ") of the tgi and its constituent temperatures were evaluated in the mri - environment .
during acquisition of fmri - scans cold , warm and tgi - stimuli ( each followed by a neutral baseline ) were presented .
methods participants the study was approved by the regional ethics committee in stockholm .
subjects were recruited through advertisement , provided written informed consent and were paid for their participation .
subjects were screened to meet the safety requirements for the mr - environment ( e.g. no history of heart or brain surgery , no metal implants / braces , not pregnant ) .
furthermore , subjects were required to be right - handed and healthy , without any self - reported history of present or past pain - or psychiatric disorder .
participants were recruited to balance sex .
twenty right - handed volunteers ( 10 males , 10 females ) were tested .
one additional subject was enrolled in the study but excluded from all analyses because of presenting with a marked pain - response to mild cold stimuli during sensory testing .
apart from contraceptives , intake of any pharmaceuticals - with the potential to influence pain perception - was not allowed within 48 hours of the experiment .
to the best of our knowledge , subjects were naive to the tgi and had not previously participated in pain - experiments conducted by our group .
care was taken when briefing subjects about the experiment .
prospective participants were merely told that the experiment would involve " the application of different temperatures that could be perceived as painful and / or unpleasant but that the stimuli would not be harmful " .
thermal sensation and pain thresholds subjects were comfortably seated in a 3 - sectioned clinical examination bed .
a computer controlled peltier - type thermode system was used ( pathway , model ats , medoc , israel ) .
the active surface ( 30x30 mm ) of the thermode was attached to the skin overlying the left calf muscles using a velcro strap .
the subjects were instructed to respond using a button held in their right hand .
baseline was set at 32.0degreesc .
for assessment of thermal detection , a change rate of 0.5degreesc / s and a return rate of 8.0degreesc / s were used .
the end - to onset inter - stimulus interval was 15 seconds .
for thermal pain measurements a change rate of 1.5degreesc / s and a return rate of 8.0degreesc / s were used and the end - to onset inter - stimulus interval set to 30 seconds .
firstly , two thresholds for warm sensation were evaluated .
after this , heat - pain thresholds were assessed and subjects were instructed to respond to the " slightest percept of pain " .
the thermode was then moved to a different skin area and a similar test for cold - sensation and cold - pain was performed .
for cold - pain testing the system had a lower limit of 0degreesc .
if 0degreesc was reached before pain had been perceived ( i.e. the button pressed ) the program automatically returned the thermode temperature to baseline .
if this happened a threshold of 0degreesc was assigned to the present and any pending trials .
ratings of the thermal grill illusion vas - ratings of the tgi as well as its constituent cold and warm temperatures were collected immediately prior to fmri .
this was done with the subject in the supine position on the mri - gurney , with the thermal grill positioned as described below , but outside the mri - gantry .
the order of the stimuli was randomized and counterbalanced .
both the experimenter and the subject were blinded to the order of the three different kinds of stimuli ( warm , cold , warm + cold = tgi ) .
each stimulus lasted for 30 seconds and the subjects were asked to provide ratings 15 seconds into each stimulus .
to approximate the conditions during the imaging , the thermoneutral inter - stimulus - interval ( isi ) was 20 seconds .
for each stimulus , the affective - motivational ( i.e. " unpleasantness ") and the discriminative - sensory dimensions ( i.e. " pain - intensity ") [ 23 ] were rated on two separate 100 mm vas - scales printed on the same sheet of paper .
subjects were instructed to rate any " unpleasantness irrespective of pain " and the " pain intensity irrespective of unpleasantness " : (' no pain ' [ left ] - ' worst pain imaginable ' [ right ]) and (' not unpleasant ' [ left ] - ' the most unpleasant feeling imaginable ' [ right ]) .
the thermal grill the thermal grill was based on a prototype previously used by our group in a in a behavioral study [ 15 ] .
compared to the prototype version , the tgi - unit used in the present experiment was designed specifically to allow rapid switches between the different temperatures and a neutral baseline .
apparatus the stimulation surface consisted of eight 1.0 mm thick jewelers' grade silver bars , each measuring 11 mm by 80 mm. the bars were placed side - to - side with a spacing of 2.4 mm , in a perspex - housing , giving a total stimulation surface of 80 mm by 105 mm. our tgi - unit can be conceptually divided into the following components : a ) thermal baths with circulation - pumps ; b ) tgi - thermode ; c ) inlet / outlet - unit fitted to the thermode - head for temperature selection via pneumatics ; d ) computer control of the temperatures via pneumatic switches .
the thermode and inlet / outlet unit were connected to the baths , pumps and control devices through an umbilical - cord running through the radiofrequency wave - traps of the mri - faraday cage .
see figure 1 .
thermal baths with circulation - pumps : two state - of - the - art thermostat - controlled baths were used for cooling and heating the water , respectively ( models f25 - ed and eh - 5 , julabo labortechnik gmbh , seelbach , germany ) .
process pumps ( model pa3120 - f03 , smc corp. , tokyo , japan ) running on pressurized air were connected to each bath via plastic tubing .
the pumps were used to draw water through the thermode - unit ; creating a vacuum on the outlet - side , rather than pumping water through the unit .
this way water could safely and efficiently circulate through the unit with no risk of a leak inside the mr - gantry in case of e.g. accidental hose detachment .
the length of each tube , running from the baths in the mri - control - room to the thermode - unit , was approximately 8 meters .
in order to prevent heat - loss / gain the warm and cold tubing were separately insulated .
this further stabilized the temperatures by means of counter - current exchange .
see figure 1 , panel b and d. tgi - thermode : the thermode surface consisted of thin pure - silver plates .
silver was chosen as it is non - ferromagnetic and has excellent thermal conductivity .
the silver plates were housed in a polymethyl methacrylate ( i.e. " acrylic glass "/" perspex ") unit .
the housing was compartmentalized such that even - and odd - numbered silver plates could be put in direct contact with ( potentially ) different pools of circulating water as selected via the inlet / outlet unit .
see figure 1 , panel a inlet / outlet - unit : a water inlet / outlet unit constructed from delrin and pvc was fitted beneath the thermode - housing .
the purpose of this was to allow rapid switching of stimulation - temperatures .
water circulated continuously through the system , providing access to stable temperatures .
a valve - system guided water flowing in separate channels within the unit .
ten pneumatically operated piston - valves ran in bored channels .
depending on the configuration of these valves , water circulating through the unit could be selected to either pass through the thermode - housing on its circulatory path , or simply be shunted without entering the thermode - unit .
warm and / or cold temperatures could thus be selected to enter the thermode - housing through two separate inlets ( one for odd - numbered silver bars , one for even - numbered ) - allowing the application of the three conditions ( warm - only , cold - only , warm and cold = tgi ) .
see figure 1 , panel c. to achieve a thermally neutral baseline stimulus at the silver - plates the " opposite " water bath was selected for a short and calibrated time ( 0.8 - 2 seconds ) for odd and even numbered plates respectively .
this was followed by a complete shunt in the input / output unit resulting in a neutral temperature ( i.e. 31.0degreesc +/ - 2.0degreesc ) equilibrating with skin - temperature as verified by pilot testing .
these switch - times were included in the total stimulus - length as reported below computer control : pneumatic switches ( model meh - 5 / 2 - 1 / 8 - p - l , festo , germany ) connected through tubing to the inlet / outlet - unit .
the electronic control valve for the switches was connected to the parallel - port of a computer .
the computer allowed the appropriate combination of valve - positions to be selected depending on desired stimulus type .
see figure 1 , panel c and d 10.1371 / journal.pone.0027075.g001 figure 1 the thermal grill - unit .
panel a ) detail of the surface of the thermode , consisting of eight silver bars each measuring 11 mmx80 mm. the bars were mounted onto a perspex - block bringing odd and even numbered bars into direct contact with ( potentially ) different pools of circulating water .
channels drilled through the perspex - block connected to the inlet / outlet unit ( grey - colored block ) through the bottom of the thermode .
panel b ) water baths for cooling and warming , connected to a circulation pumps .
panel c ) the tgi - thermode attached to the grey delrin inlet / outlet unit .
the delrin - block has bored channels in which ten pneumatically operated piston - valves operate .
the two segregated pools of warm - and cold - water are continuously circulated through the unit ( blue hoses ) .
the position of the valves , set through computer controlled pneumatics ( thin black tubes ) , determine the water - flow to the perspex - block thermode .
the thermode and inlet / outlet unit are connected to the baths , pumps and control devices through a thermally insulated umbilical - cord running through the radiofrequency wave - traps of the mri - faraday cage .
panel d ) pressurized air - operated process pumps for circulating the water , along with computer - controlled pneumatic switches - allowing precise timing of stimulus - presentation .
temperature calibration and response - times the water - baths provide an excellent thermal stability of the water supplied to the thermode : within +/ - 0.03degreesc as specified by the manufacturer .
during scans , the temperature displays of these water - baths were monitored from the mri control - room .
the baths were calibrated such that the silver - plates reached the desired temperatures .
an infrared ( ir ) camera with high thermal resolution ( model 882 , testo ag , lenzkirch , germany ) was used .
to achieve an emissivity coefficient close to 1.0 , thin opaque tape was attached to the silver surface of the tgi - thermode .
we thereby minimized the reflection from adjacent ir - sources .
the thermode - unit was thus calibrated to 41.0degreesc +/ - 0.5degreesc , 18.0degreesc +/ - 0.5degreesc and 31.0 +/ - 2.0degreesc .
see figure 2 .
the temperature levels were verified during several pre - experimental tests with the ir - camera during both single - temperature stimuli as well as tgi stimulus .
the system was monitored for the duration of several consecutive experimental sessions , without deviation .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0027075.g002 figure 2 thermography of the tgi - thermode surface .
an infrared ( ir ) camera with high thermal resolution was used to verify the stimulus temperatures .
note that the temperature shown is that at the crosshair .
panel a ) warm - stimulus ( 41.0degreesc +/ - 0.5degreesc ) panel b ) cold - stimulus ( 18.0degreesc +/ - 0.5degreesc ) panel c ) tgi - stimulus ( 41.0degreesc +/ - 0.5degreesc & 18.0degreesc +/ - 0.5degreesc ) .
note that the crosshair is centered on a cold plate . panel d ) neutral baseline stimulus ( 31.0degreesc +/ - 2.0degreesc ) .
rise and fall times were determined with an ir - probe with a 9 ms response time ( model lt15f , optris gmbh , berlin , germany ) .
the thermal time constant ( i.e. time to reach approximately 63 % of its desired temperature ) was thus determined to be 1.0 second for the tgi - condition , and 1.5 seconds for both warm - and cold - only conditions .
the reason for the slightly lower time constant for the tgi is that during this condition water from each bath is only circulated through half ( i.e. only to odd or even numbered elements ) of the thermode - unit .
see figure 3 .

representative recordings from two adjacent silver bars ( i.e. odd - and even - numbered ) of the tgi - system .
the recordings were made simultaneously using two infra - red thermosensors with a high temporal resolution .
each stimulus lasted 20 - seconds .
the graphs show an initial cold - stimulation ( 18.0 +/ - 0.5degreesc ) , followed by a return to neutral baseline ( 31.0 +/ - 2.0degreesc ) .
this was followed by warm ( 41.0 +/ - 0.5degreesc ) and then baseline .
finally , the graphs show the tgi - condition ( lasting from 01:20 to 01:40 mins ) where adjacent bars have cold and warm temperatures , respectively .
after this initial calibration , the proper functioning of the unit was controlled prior to each experimental session using a calibrated and highly sensitive surface probe with a spring - loaded thermocouple strip ( model 925 with probe type - k , testo ag , lenzkirch , germany - calibrated by nordtec instrument ab , gotheburg , sweden ) .
thermography : supplementary online material as an illustration of the dynamics of the tgi - system , a representative recording of a thermography session is provided .
see " supporting information files " - video s1 .
choice of stimulation site considering the mri 's relatively narrow gantry the leg was an ergonomically preferable stimulus - site as compared to e.g. the ventral forearm .
the skin overlying the left calf - muscle was therefore chosen as stimulus site .
it should be noted that the thermal sensitivity of this area is likely to be slightly reduced compared to that of the forearm or hand [ 24 ] .
choice of cold and warm temperatures craig and co - workers pet - imaging study used grill elements set at 20degreesc and 40degreesc to induce the illusion [ 7 ] .
a study by bouhassira and colleagues suggested that the strength of the tgi - sensation is related to the magnitude of the differential between cold and warm temperatures [ 25 ] .
we expected the thermal sensitivity to be slightly reduced over the calf as compared to the hand or ventral forearm commonly used in behavioral testing of the tgi [ 24 ] .
we therefore slightly increased this gap ( i.e. 41degreesc - 18degreesc = 23degreesc ) as compared to the 20degreesc gap used by craig and co - workers .
importantly , as revealed by the testing of thermal - pain thresholds , our tgi - temperatures remained well - within the span of innocuous temperatures .
fmri - experiment the experimental scans were carried out in a standard hospital mri - environment at the karolinska university hospital , mr - centrum in solna , sweden .
the ambient temperature in the mri - room during the experiments averaged 21.6degreesc ( range 20.2 - 22.0degreesc ) with a relative humidity between 40 and 55 percent .
as mentioned , the psychophysical assessment of the tgi occurred in the mri - room immediately prior to scanning , mitigating the potential for environmental confounds in this regard .
subject rested their left leg on the surface of the thermal grill such that the skin overlying the calf - muscles was in contact with its stimulating surface .
the long axes of the silver bars were placed orthogonally to the leg .
cushions were used to ensure that the leg could be comfortably maintained in this position for the duration of the experiment .
images were acquired on a 3.0 tesla scanner ( discovery mr750 , ge ) with a 32 channel head - coil ( mr instruments inc ) .
the head was fixated inside the coil with headphones and foam wedges .
a 3 - plane localizer was followed by an asset - calibration for parallel imaging .
this was followed by two t2 * - weighted echo - planar imaging ( epi ) scans for fmri - during which thermal stimuli were applied - each scan lasting 10:20 , including 20 seconds of discarded dummy - scans .
imaging parameters were : sequential axial - plane slices with thickness 3.0 mm and spacing of 0.5 mm , 37 slices , 288 mmx288 mm field - of - view ( fov ) yielding a voxel - size of 2.25x2.25x3.5 mm3 , repetition time ( tr ) 2500 ms , flip - angle 90degrees , and an echo - time ( te ) of 30 ms. the fmri - scanning was divided into two sessions to ensure optimal subject cooperation .
after a brief verbal confirmation that the subject was comfortable , the second session commenced .
for each epi - scan one of five possible stimulus - files was chosen in a randomized and counterbalanced way .
each file contained a different pseudorandomized stimulus order ensuring that not more that two of the same type of stimuli could occur consecutively .
following the 20 seconds of dummy - scans , the first stimulus was applied .
each stimulus lasted 20 seconds and was followed by a 20 second neutral baseline .
during each scan , every stimulus type ( i.e. cold , warm tgi ) was delivered five times each .
it should be noted that we chose to have a neutral baseline condition between each active stimulus .
although this leads to a relative over - sampling of the baseline as compared to each of the three stimulus conditions we found it necessary in order to minimize the risk of peripheral and / or central sensitization as well as to avoid evoking sensations of " paradoxical heat " [ 3 ] - by going from warm to cold directly - not caused by the tgi itself .
statistical analyses analyses of behavioral data spss statistics 17.0 ( spss inc , chicago , usa ) was used for analyses .
two - tailed tests were used unless otherwise stated and p - values < 0.05 were considered significant .
data are reported as means +/ - 1 standard deviation ( sd ) and graphs are shown as means with error bars +/ - 1 standard error of the mean ( sem ) .
shapiro - wilk tests were used to assess significant deviations from the normal distribution and non - parametric tests ( exact ) were used when suitable .
for the tgi , vas - ratings of the affective ( i.e. " unpleasantness ") and sensory ( i.e. " pain - intensity ") components were analyzed separately .
friedman 's non - parametric anova was used to compare the ratings of the respective dimension for the tgi with the ratings for cold and warm .
these anovas were followed by post - hoc testing using wilcoxon 's signed rank test .
spearman 's correlation coefficient was used for the exploratory correlations between activation intensity and vas - ratings .
analyses of fmri - data spm8 ( wellcome trust centre for neuroimaging , university college london , uk ) was used to analyze the fmri - data .
realigned epi - images were normalized to the canonical epi - template in the standard montreal neurological institute ( mni ) - space .
normalized epi - images were smoothed using an 8 mm full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) - kernel .
for each individual subject , first - level analyses were carried out using a fixed - effects analysis ( ffx ) , i.e. compounding both scans into the same general linear model ( glm ) .
using a boxcar - model , onsets and durations for the application of cold , warm , tgi and neutral temperature stimuli were entered as regressors .
movement parameters provided by the realignment process were added as covariates of no interest .
these explanatory variables were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function ( hrf ) in the glm design matrix .
the following t - contrasts were estimated : all stimuli ( cold , warm or tgi ) versus neutral baseline , cold versus neutral , warm versus neutral , tgi versus neutral , and tgi versus areas activated by both cold and warm .
group - level analyses were conducted using the summary statistics approach , to achieve a random - effects analysis ( rfx ) , using one - way t - tests .
the resulting maps were thresholded at a voxel - level of p < 0.001.to achieve an overall alpha - level < 0.05 , corrected for multiple - comparisons , we used the program rest v 1.0's ( http :// www.restfmri.net ) instantiation of alphasim ( http :// afni.nimh.nih.gov / pub / dist / doc / manual / alphasim.pdf ) applied to the 123507 voxels identified by a whole - brain mask .
one - thousand monte - carlo simulations were conducted and the extent of the needed cluster - size was determined to be >= 40 .
all contrasts were evaluated at this corrected alpha - level < 0.05 ( i.e. p < 0.001 , cluster - size >= 40 ) .
additionally , we conducted an exploration / sensitivity - analysis of these contrasts at the less stringent cluster - size of >= 20 .
results are displayed on the standard mni152 average t1 - weighted brain .
we employed the anatomy toolbox v 1.8 [ 26 ] to assist in the localization of significant clusters .
the mni - coordinates ( x , y , z in millimeters ) of the peak - level voxels of these clusters are reported .
for exploratory correlation analyses between brain activity and subjective ratings , we used the marsbar region of interest toolbox for spm ( version 0.42 ) to extract the weighted beta - values averaged across voxels in regions - of - interest ( rois ) .
results thresholds of thermal sensation and pain over the left calf subjects detected warm at an average of 35.5degreesc +/ - 2.1 and cold at 27.6 +/ - 1.7degreesc respectively .
the average heat - pain threshold was 45.0degreesc +/ - 1.8 .
fourteen of the twenty subjects did not report cold - pain against the skin overlying the calf for the test reaching 0degreesc ; the average cold - pain was 3.8degreesc +/ - 7.5degreesc .
this served as a confirmation that our tgi - temperatures were well within the range of innocuous temperatures for the subjects .
behavioral validation of the tgi with regard to ratings of unpleasantness the cold , warm and tgi differed significantly [ chi2 ( 2 ) = 17.1 , p < 0.001 ] .
post - hoc comparisons revealed tgi ratings as significantly more unpleasant than both cold [ z = - 2.5 , p = 0.01 ] and warm [ z = - 3.6 , p < 0.001 ] .
additionally , cold was rated as more unpleasant than warm [ z = - 2.3 , p = 0.02 ]. with regard to pain - ratings , the three conditions differed only by a non - significant trend [ chi2 ( 2 ) = 5.8 , p = 0.051 ] .
given the strong a - priori expectations we nonetheless conducted post - hoc tests .
these revealed that the tgi was rated as more painful than both cold [ z = - 2.0 , p = 0.04 ] and warm [ z = - 2.5 , p = 0.01 ] , with no difference in ratings between warm and cold [ z = - 1.0 , p = 0.35 ] .
as also expected from previous results [ 15 ] , the tgi was rated as more unpleasant than painful [ z = - 2.9 , p = 0.002 ] .
see figure 4 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0027075.g004 figure 4 ratings of the tgi , collected prior to fmri .
affective - motivational (" unpleasantness ") and sensory - discriminatory (" pain - intensity ") dimensions were rated on separate 100 mm - long vas scales .
significance levels : ** = p < 0.01 ,* = p < 0.05 , ns = non - significant .
fmri - analyses to validate the functioning of the stimulus - device and timing on the experimental paradigm as a whole , we first calculated the contrast between the application of any thermal stimulus ( cold , warm or tgi ) and the neutral baseline .
the contrast revealed bilateral activation in the anterior insulae together with fronto - parietal activity .
see table 1 and figure 5 .
we then evaluated the specific contrasts between the tgi , cold , and warm stimuli - respectively - versus the neutral baseline .
for the tgi , a large cluster of activation was observed in the right thalamus , partially extending over into the left thalamic region .
additionally , right - sided fronto - parietal activation was found .
for the exploratory contrast at a less stringent cluster - extent criteria ( i.e. p < 0.001 , with a cluster - extent >= 20 voxels instead of 40 ) , activation in the right mid / anterior insula emerged .
see table 2 and figure 6 .
for the cold , no thalamic activity emerged .
instead , this contrast revealed bilateral activation of the inferior and middle frontal gyri and bilateral activity in the inferior parietal lobuli .
see table 3 and figure 7 .
no clusters of activations survived thresholding in the warm versus neutral contrast .
finally , we evaluated the contrast of the tgi versus areas commonly activated by warm and cold .
this corroborated the tgi - related activation in the right thalamus .

see figure 8 . correlations between subjective ratings of the tgi and brain - activity exploratory post - hoc contrasts revealed an expected [ 3 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] activation of the right mid / anterior insular region in response to the thermal grill versus neutral baseline .
there is good evidence that this cortico - limbic structure is important for subjectively experienced feeling - states in general [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] , and - importantly - the neural processes underlying the feeling of " unpleasantness " [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] .
we therefore used a functional region - of - interest approach to explore the relationship between rated unpleasantness and right mid / anterior insular activity .
importantly , the vas - ratings were made before the acquisition of functional images and did not enter into the glm - analyses of the fmri - data , thereby eliminating the possibility of a confounding by the rating - procedure per - se on these correlations .
the region - of interest ( roi ) was defined by the 25 - voxel activated cluster revealed by the group - level contrast .
we extracted the contrast weighted intensities ( i.e. beta - values ) , averaged across the voxels in the roi , for each of the twenty subjects .
these intensities were plotted against the individual vas - ratings of " unpleasantness " for tgi .
there was a positive , trend - level significant , correlation between these values [ rho = 0.31 , p = 0.09 , one - tailed test ] and removal of one putative outlier strengthened this correlation considerably [ rho = 0.51 , p = 0.01 , one - tailed test ] .
the outlier was identified post - hoc as the sole observation with a standardized residual error > 2 .
see figure 9 .
vas - ratings of pain did not exhibit such an association with insular - activity [ rho = - 0.11 , p = 0.66 ] .
similar intensities extracted from the thalamic region did not correlate with the extracted insular intensities [ rho = 0.07 , p = 0.80 ] or with ratings of unpleasantness [ rho = - 0.16 , p = 0.50 ] .

the contrast comparing tgi - stimulation against the neutral baseline revealed right mid / insular activity in a 25 - voxel cluster .
see # in figure 6 .
this cluster was used to define a functional region - of - interest ( roi ) from which the average cluster - intensities ( i.e. average contrast - weighted beta - values ) were extracted for each individual subject .
the figure shows these intensities plotted against each individual 's vas - ratings of " unpleasantness " for tgi , [ rho = 0.31 , p = 0.09 , one - tailed test ] ; removal of a putative outlier ( shown as a square ) strengthened this correlation considerably [ rho = 0.51 , p = 0.01 , one - tailed test ] .
discussion summary of findings to evaluate the supraspinal correlates of the thermal grill illusion ( tgi ) we developed an mri - compatible thermode capable of rapidly presenting warm , cold and tgi ( i.e. juxtapositioned warm and cold ) stimuli .
the described tgi - unit permits an inherently safe , thermally and temporally reliable presentation of the tgi - stimulus in an mri - environment. with regard to ratings of the affective - motivational (" unpleasantness ") and sensory - discriminative (" pain ") dimensions of the tgi , we largely replicated our previous behavioral results using a related thermode - prototype [ 15 ] .
the tgi was rated as significantly both more unpleasant and painful than each of its constituent cold ( 18degreesc ) and warm ( 41degreesc ) temperatures by themselves .
additionally , the tgi was rated as more unpleasant than painful .
the most salient feature revealed by the fmri - analyses was the specific and strong activation of the contralateral thalamus by the tgi as compared to the patterns of activations provided by its constituent temperatures .
as thalamic aberrations appear to play a key role in central pain syndromes [ 16 ] , [ 20 ] this finding may suggest an important overlapping mechanism of the tgi and such pain - pathologies .
as an evaluation of the overall stimulus - paradigm , a contrast of all thermal stimuli ( compounding tgi , cold and warm ) versus the neutral baseline revealed activation in bilateral frontal gyri as well as the inferior parietal lobuli ( on the right side limited to the supramarginal gyrus ) together with a bilateral activation of the anterior insulae .
extensive evidence exists that the neural representation of homeostatically relevant feeling - states are encoded in the insulae [ 27 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 35 ] and both noxious and innocuous warm and cold stimuli have been reported to activate a network involving this region [ 36 ] .
the fronto - parietal activation observed for the overall , cold and tgi - contrasts may well be related to attention - orienting effects [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] in response to salient environmental stimuli .
it is also worth noting that the parietal activation in response to the tgi - stimulus was located more ventrally , i.e. in the supramarginal gyrus ( smg ) , as compared to the cold - stimulus .
the tgi - activity was also lateralized to the right .
accordingly , the right smg has been suggested to be part of a network ( also including the right inferior frontal gyrus , right anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex ) activated by unexpected / novel stimuli [ 38 ] .
the sensitivity in the comparison of each of the types of stimuli with the neutral baseline was reduced by the limited number of epochs ( 10 per type per subject ) .
despite this , the tgi evaluated against the neutral baseline displayed a strong activation in the contralateral thalamus , not seen in the overall contrast .
at the slightly more liberal cluster - threshold , the tgi - contrast also revealed activation in the right mid / anterior insula .
in contrasting cold with neutral , only the fronto - parietal activation was seen and no clusters of activation survived thresholding for the contrast of warm versus neutral .
finally , contrasting the tgi versus areas commonly activated by warm or cold corroborated the activation in the right thalamus .
interpretations of tgi - induced thalamic activity and an alternative tgi - hypothesis the tgi - related thalamic activity was most expressed contralateral to the stimulation .
as far as we know , this is the first neurophysiological evidence for thalamic involvement in the tgi .
craig and co - workers proposed the tgi as an experimental model of central neuropathic pain [ 2 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , providing a major impetus for the presently reported study .
it is therefore noteworthy that a key finding in imaging studies of central neuropathic pain involves thalamic aberrations .
an important caveat in this regard is that an overlapping activation pattern between the tgi and neuropathic pain must not be taken as evidence that the two are equivalent .
bearing this in mind , a comparison between the tgis supraspinal correlates and those found in studies of e.g. evoked allodynia could nonetheless help to generate clinically relevant hypotheses .
whereas the thalamus may be hypoactive during rest in patients with central pain , hyperexcitability has been found during evoked allodynic pain - possibly relating to a loss of inhibitory thalamic neurons - as reviewed by veldhuijzen et al [ 20 ] .
a pioneering study by cesaro et al using single - photon emission computerized tomography ( spect ) , demonstrated a thalamic hyperactivity in response to allodynia following central post - stroke pain ( cpsp ) [ 22 ] .
also , a similar neural signature to that presently evoked by the tgi was found in a pet - study by peyron and colleagues .
the authors studied evoked cold - allodynia in nine patients with infarction of the lateral medulla resulting in wallenberg 's syndrome [ 21 ] .
the allodynic response was coupled to increases in cerebral blood - flow in the contralateral thalamus , post - central gyrus and inferior parietal lobule as well as anterior insular and medial prefrontal cortices .
as the allodynic symptoms were unilateral , it was possible to study the non - allodynic cold - response in the same set of participants .
whereas this stimulation increased the signal in the ipsilateral inferior parietal lobule and inferior frontal gyrus , it did not significantly modify blood - flow in the thalamus .
thermosensory information from the superficial lamina of the spinal dorsal horn is relayed in the spino - thalamic tract ( stt ) to the thalamus .
a thalamic involvement in the tgi is compatible with the overall concepts underlying craig 's proposed thermosensory disinhibition hypothesis , postulating a tgi - induced central unmasking of burning pain normally inhibited by cold [ 5 ] .
regarding the thalamic nuclei involved , craig posits a unique role for the so - called posterior part of the ventral medial nucleus ( vmpo ) of the thalamus in subserving an afferent homeostatic pathway shared by pain and temperature [ 39 ] and - consequently - the tgi [ 7 ] .
this matter is controversial [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , and graziano and jones have presented evidence " disproving the existence of the vmpo as an independent thalamic pain nucleus " [ 42 ] .
as reviewed by ralston there is indeed strong evidence that the largest somatosensory nucleus - the ventrocaudal nucleus ( vc ) - receives lamina i afferents carrying nociceptive and thermal information [ 41 ] .
accordingly , the vc is implicated in central pain following thalamic stroke [ 43 ] .
the resolution of the presently reported results does not permit an exact localization of the observed activation to specific nuclei .
the demonstrated activation of the thalamus by the tgi suggests an increased computational load , rather than a simple " tgi - related - relay " .
one putative explanation of the thalamic response to the tgi is therefore that it reflects alterations in certain thalamo - cortico - thalamic loops .
pathological reverberations in these loops have been suggested by llinas [ 44 ] to underlie central pain phenomena .
a key mechanism in the appearance of these " dysrythmic " loops is believed to be aberrant so - called low - threshold calcium spike ( lts ) bursts by thalamic neurons [ 44 ] .
lts - bursts are caused by a de - inactivation of thalamic calcium channels by membrane hyperpolarization ( i.e. inhibitory events ) and underlie normal thalamic oscillations [ 45 ] .
the same thalamic neuron can switch between by such lts - bursting activity ( at low membrane potentials ) to graded repetitive firing at higher potentials [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] .
altered lts - bursting has been coupled to a variety of neurological disorders , including neuropathic pain [ 47 ] .
importantly , thalamic projection neurons both send and receive inhibitory feedback to control their firing in relation to afferent volleys ; excitatory signals to thalamus therefore also lead to inhibitory activity .
accordingly , sensory stimulation is capable of inducing lts - bursts , through inhibitory membrane - hyperpolarization [ 46 ] , [ 48 ] .
as elegantly demonstrated by lee and colleagues , human thalamic vc - neurons responsive to cold have been found to have particularly high rates of such lts - mediated firing in response to stimulation , irrespective of stimulus - type [ 49 ] .
hypothetically , the warm channel of the tgi may interfere with these normal processes .
we therefore suggest that tgi - phenomenon could arise from warm - related additional inhibition ( over and above that induced by inhibitory - feedback of the cold - stimulus alone ) of such thalamic cold - responsive neurons and thereby an altered ( i.e. increased ) lts - burst activity compared to that caused by application of cold alone .
such putative warm - induced membrane - hyperpolarization may for example be present in the form of lateral - inhibition [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] , [ 53 ] , under normal circumstances having a functional thermo - discriminatory role with regard to the graded repetitive firing at more depolarized membrane - potentials .
this " over - inhibition " hypothesis is testable : microelectrode recordings from awake patients receiving thalamic implants [ 49 ] , or unanesthetized monkeys [ 54 ] , [ 55 ] , could be obtained during tgi - stimulation .
such an " over - inhibition " hypothesis appears compatible with the general idea of thermosensory convergence / addition advanced by bouhassira and colleagues based on the finding that a lowering of the cold temperature used to elicit the tgi has comparable perceptual effects to an increase in warm temperature [ 56 ] .
perhaps owing to the paucity of literature on lateral - inhibition and thermal sensation [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] , the concept has - to the authors' knowledge - so - far only been mentioned very briefly in relation to the tgi - phenomenon [ 57 ] .
insular and cerebellar activation the anterior part of the insula is a region of particular interest with regard to subjective feeling - states [ 27 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 35 ] and interoceptive awareness [ 28 ] , [ 58 ] .
comparing the tgi against baseline revealed activity in the right mid / anterior insula .
consistent with the region 's proposed role we demonstrate a positive correlation between the individual activation - intensities and subjective ratings of " unpleasantness " .
for the present purposes it is also interesting to note that the perception of a phenomenon related to the tgi - namely " paradoxical heat " [ 4 ] - has been specifically tied to activity in the right anterior insula in a percept - related fmri - study [ 3 ] .
when contrasting the tgi against activation common to both cold and warm the insular activation did not survive ( exploratory ) thresholding , probably due to a partially overlapping activation , albeit stronger in the tgi .
instead , however , a cerebellar activation contralateral to the stimulus emerged .
such cerebellar activity is often seen in studies involving actual noxious stimuli [ 59 ] .
one interpretation is that it may relate to withdrawal behavior / reflexes [ 60 ] .
as the activation did not emerge in relation to the neutral baseline , however , this is not a likely interpretation here , however .
instead , the cerebellar activation may reflect aversion - related processes that differed in sign between the tgi and control temperatures .
accordingly , the work by moulton and colleagues suggests that the cerebellum contains regions related to the processing of aversive emotional information [ 61 ] .
lack of tgi - related acc - activity , methodological considerations unlike the pet - study of the tgi by craig and co - workers [ 7 ] , we did not observe any activation in the anterior cingulate cortex ( acc ) .
pet - imaging revealed an acc - response both to the tgi and noxious thermal stimuli , whereas no such response was present for the innocuous warm and cold temperatures alone .
accordingly , the authors contend that acc activation is " an integral component of the neurobiological basis of the thermal grill illusion of pain " and that this activation supports the tgi 's use in pain - research [ 7 ] .
although implicated in processing of pain - unpleasantness [ 62 ] , the specific interpretation of anterior cingulate activation is , however , not settled .
acc - activity is not a consistent finding in studies of pain in general [ 63 ] , [ 64 ] , or in evoked allodynia in particular [ 20 ] , [ 63 ] .
for example , whereas a study of evoked cold - allodynia in syringomyelia patients did indeed display acc - activation , the same patients did not exhibit this when tested for tactile allodynia [ 65 ] .
it has been proposed that activity in the acc seen in pain - paradigms may reflect response behavior and generation of ( affective ) decisions rather than sensory processing [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
the inconsistencies may in part be related to different paradigms and instructions to participants .
simple rating - tasks performed during neuroimaging of salient emotional stimuli have been demonstrated to influence brain - activity ( e.g. acc - activity ) [ 19 ] .
in craig 's study participants rated the stimuli during acquisition of pet - images [ 7 ] .
in our study , the rating was conducted just prior to scanning .
our subjects were not instructed as to whether or not to attend to the stimuli - apart from being told that it was important that they remained still and awake .
specifically , subjects did not know that the tgi - sensation was the stimulus of primary interest - possibly reducing " response - selection " related activity .
furthermore , differences in data - processing may contribute to discordant findings .
as was common in the mid 1990 's , craig and co - workers study used an average map of all activation - corresponding to a fixed - effects model ( ffx ) .
importantly , this implies that regional activity specific in a subset of participants may drive the main effect provided it is large enough .
in the present study , however , we used the now available and more appropriate random - effects model ( rfx ) permitting more rigorous inference back to the population of interest ( i.e. healthy right handed volunteers ) as for the studied bold - activation ( see e.g. http :// www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk / spm / doc / books / hbf2 / pdfs / ch12.pdf ) .
our results should not be taken as an indication that the tgi does not significantly activate the acc above baseline , but rather that it does not do so consistently enough to be generalized to a healthy population given the exact instructions and paradigm used in the present study .
affective - motivational and sensory - discriminatory dimensions of the tgi the temporal dynamics of the tgi are also likely to influence the results .
in fact , these temporal dynamics may relate to the whether or not the grill is an illusion of " pain " as such .
leung and co - workers demonstrate a time - course variation of the tgi , such that it was rated as more painful than its constituent temperatures at 3 seconds into the stimulus but not at 10 seconds [ 66 ] .
such findings may underlie some of the discordant findings ; for example , frusthorfer et al conclude that the tgi produces " synthetic heat " but that it is not " painful " [ 4 ] .
craig et al let warming precede cooling in the tgi stimulus by 5 seconds to increase the effect ( footnote 7 in [ 5 ]) and it has been shown that such preheating facilitates the perception of " synthetic heat " due to cooling of the skin [ 67 ] , possibly increasing the pain - intensity as well .
our present , and previous [ 15 ] , results do however support the notion put forth by craig et al [ 5 ] , and later corroborated by other groups [ 25 ] , [ 68 ] , [ 69 ] , that the tgi may indeed be classified as " painful. " additionally , our data indicate that perceptual quality of the tgi lies more along the affective - motivational than sensory - discriminatory dimension .
accordingly , whereas ratings of " unpleasantness " correlated with activation - intensities in the right mid / anterior insula - no such association emerged for ratings of " pain - intensity " .
these correlations cast additional light on the interpretation of some of our previously reported findings : we recently reported of a putative dissociation between tgi - unpleasantness and tgi - pain on the basis genetically inferred differences in the serotonin - system and gender [ 15 ] .
importantly , being more an " illusion of unpleasantness " or dysesthesia than of " pain " does not disqualify the tgi as an important tool in probing the mechanisms of , for example , cold - allodynia and / or dystesthesia related to central lesions .
such percepts may be functionally limiting , regardless of whether or not they are described as painful [ 70 ] .
in patients with wallenberg 's syndrome , for instance , the application of cold to an afflicted area has been described as a " new , strange and extremely unpleasant feeling " [ 21 ] .
study limitations and future perspectives as with all imaging studies , it is imperative to be cautious of the interpretation of " reverse inferences " [ 71 ] .
for instance , an overlapping activation pattern between the tgi and that seen in evoked cold - allodynia must not be taken as hard evidence that the two are equivalent .
a more prudent use of such common activation patterns is to generate mechanistic hypotheses as well as to complement studies using other methodologies .
as with all fmri - studies , the bold - signal is a surrogate signal related to blood - flow increases induced by mass - activity in large populations of neurons and inferences as to the specific neural architectures involved and relationship between inhibitory and excitatory mechanism cannot be made [ 72 ] .
it would therefore be highly relevant to collect thalamic microelectrode recordings to assess the influence of the tgi - stimulus on lts - burst activity. that is , to test our ' thalamic over - inhibition hypothesis' as outlined above .
it is also important to note that neuropathic pain constitutes a heterogenous group of disorders and that mechanisms underlying experimentally evoked percepts in healthy volunteers are not necessarily transferable to those underlying evoked allodynia in pain - patients .
one obvious caveat in this regard is changes over time : baseline neural activity and chronicity are likely to be related .
for example , in as study by ushida et al , patients with neuropathic pain - onset within 12 months had a hyperperfusion of the contralateral thalamus .
this was not observed in patients with pain of longer duration [ 73 ] .
it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the various symptoms and sensory aberrations of different neuropathic pain - states .
as reviewed by moisset and bouhassira , the existence of a unique " allodynia network " is highly unlikely given the heterogeneity of the conditions [ 74 ] - see also [ 75 ] .
future studies will hopefully delineate for which conditions the tgi may be an appropriate perceptual / mechanistic - model .
for instance , it would be interesting to directly compare the supraspinal correlates of a " real " cold - allodynic response to that of the tgi , presenting the latter in a thermosensory intact area .
as there is evidence that lesions of the non - dominant ( right ) thalamus is associated with a greater risk of pain , a study of laterality - effects of the tgi would also be of value [ 10 ] .
additionally , studies of how cognitive factors may modulate the tgi could shed light on the involved perceptual mechanisms .
for instance , it is known that expectations modulate pain perception - including allodynia [ 76 ] - and the prefrontal cortices ( pfc ) are important in this regard [ 76 ] , [ 77 ] , [ 78 ] , [ 79 ] . future studies could be designed to assess the interplay between relevant pfc - engaging paradigms , simultaneously gauging the subjective ratings of the tgi - percept together with the thalamic activity .
studies aimed at assessing the functional connectivity between supraspinal areas are also feasible .
while our data delineate supraspinal mechanisms involved in the phenomenon , the present study should not be interpreted as evidence that the tgi only has supraspinal correlates .
there is evidence that peripheral as well as spinal processes also contribute to the tgi .
for instance , campero and co - workers have reported of human cutaneous c - fibers that are activated by both heating and cooling .
as the authors note , the tgi could very well be related to such bimodal receptive properties of the peripheral somatosensory system [ 80 ] .
spinally , thermoafferent processing , especially that of the superficial lamina in the dorsal horn [ 5 ] , [ 39 ] , is likely to contribute to the tgi and individual variation in how it is perceived .
given the presently reported findings , such spinal processes appear especially relevant to evaluate in humans .
future studies could make use of the presently described tgi - system in a spinal - fmri setting to explore these mechanisms non - invasively .
a few technical notes should also be made .
we used a fixed temperature paradigm and the perceived intensity of the tgi is known to vary quite substantially [ 15 ] , [ 56 ] , [ 81 ] .
further studies , especially those evaluating the pheonomenon in relation to symptoms experienced patients or pharmacological treatment - effects , may therefore benefit from the individualization of temperatures [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 25 ] .
also , we refrained from using noxious thermal stimuli for comparisons .
this was partially for technical and logistic reasons but also due to the fact that we previously demonstrated that the tgi appears to be more unpleasant than painful [ 15 ] - perhaps rendering such stimuli less relevant .
nonetheless , the presently described system would allow for the presentation of temperatures as low as 5degreesc and as high as 47degreesc .
subject to a few modifications , the system could also accommodate additional water - baths - something which would permit more advanced study designs .
additionally , the tgi - system could be fitted with an array of commercially available mri - compatible fibre - optic thermosensors .
this would allow for an elaborate online monitoring during scanning .
the exact temporal dynamics of the system could then be included as regressors in the data analysis .
this would be important for event - related designs .
for the present purposes , however , with epochs of 20 second long stimuli , the absence of such high temporal resolution is very unlikely to have had any relevant influence on our fmri - analyses .
conclusion we developed an mri - compatible thermal grill illusion ( tgi ) - unit .
to the best of our knowledge our study represents the first fmri - investigation of the tgi .
the behavioral results corroborate our previous findings [ 15 ] that the quality of the tgi - percept ( for fixed cold and warm temperatures ) appears to lie more along the affective - motivational than sensory - discriminative dimension .
the right mid / anterior insular activation in response to the tgi ( correlating with ratings of tgi - " unpleasantness ") is highly compatible with this region 's proposed role in subjective feeling - states [ 29 ] .
the imaging results constitute novel , direct evidence , for a thalamic involvement in the tgi .
we propose the hypothesis that the special electrophysiological properties of thalamic neurons , relating to burst - activity , contribute to this finding .
the tgi has been suggested as a model of percepts involved in neuropathic - pain , including cold - allodynia [ 5 ] .
the thalamus is known to play an important role in such pain - pathologies and has been shown to be activated in response to evoked cold - allodynia in patients [ 20 ] .
in sum , our results contribute to the understanding of the tgi - phenomenon per se. future fmri - studies comparing neuropathic pain with the tgi are now both possible and clearly warranted .
supporting information video s1 a recording of a thermography session of the tgi - system is provided as a quicktime - film .

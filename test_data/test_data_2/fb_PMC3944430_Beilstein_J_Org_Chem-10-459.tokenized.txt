this transformation generates one c - c and one c - n bond and presumably proceeds via a reaction sequence comprising a michael - type addition - elimination reaction , a nucleophilic attack of an enamine to a carbonyl reminiscent of one of the steps of the bayllis - hilman condensation , and a final deoxygenation .
the deoxygenation is assumed to be induced by carbon monoxide resulting from the thermal decomposition of the dimethylformamide solvent .
chromones domino reactions michael additions multicomponent reactions transfer hydrogenation this article is part of the thematic series " multicomponent reactions ii " .
introduction chromones are widely present in nature , especially in the plant kingdom , and a wide variety of useful biological properties are associated with them [ 1 - 2 ] .
chromone derivatives act as effective tyrosine and protein kinase c inhibitors [ 3 ] and display antifungal [ 4 - 5 ] , antimycobacterial [ 6 ] , antiviral [ 7 ] , antihypertensive [ 8 ] , anti - oxidant [ 9 - 12 ] , hiv - inhibitory [ 13 ] , anti - inflammatory [ 14 - 15 ] , immunomodulatory [ 16 ] , antithrombotic [ 17 ] , and anticancer [ 18 - 20 ] activities .
furthermore , some chromone derivatives have been identified as suitable fluorophores for live cell imaging [ 21 ] .
in view of its importance chromone has emerged as a pharmacophore in drug discovery programmes , leading to several drugs in the market ( e.g. cromolyn and nedocromil ) and thereby continuing to draw the attention of synthetic organic and medicinal chemists [ 22 - 24 ] .
however , there are relatively few methods , which allow the preparation of hybrid structures containing chromone derivatives attached to other heterocyclic systems due to the lack of suitable building blocks .
in order to come up with such building blocks , we planned the preparation of chromones containing a beta - enaminone structural fragment , since enaminones are versatile starting materials in organic synthesis and are notably important for the synthesis of nitrogen heterocycles [ 25 - 27 ] .
in particular , beta - enaminoketones are endowed with electrophilic and nucleophilic reaction centers and have a versatile reactivity that allows their application in the synthesis of important heterocycles such as indole [ 28 ] , dihydropyridine [ 29 ] , quinoline [ 30 ] , pyrrole [ 31 ] and pyridinone [ 32 ] .
furthermore , they can take part in one - pot multicomponent reactions with both nucleophilic and electrophilic reactants , leading to a fast access to structurally diverse carbocycles and heterocycles , an area in which we have recently become interested [ 33 - 42 ] .
thus , the present study ia a continuation of our research program on the construction of novel heterocycles employing one - pot green domino - multicomponent transformations [ 43 - 54 ] .
in order to achieve our goal , we embarked on the study of the three - component reactions between 3 - formylchromone ( 1 ) , ( e ) - 3 - ( dimethylamino ) - 1 - arylprop - 2 - en - 1 - ones 2 and anilines 3 , which we expected to furnish novel ( e ) - 3 - [ 2 - arylcarbonyl - 3 - ( arylamino ) allyl ] - 4h - chromen - 4 - ones 5 comprising the desired chromonone and beta - enaminoketone moieties via intermediate species 4 .
the overall synthetic strategy is summarized in scheme 1 .
scheme 1 summary of the transformations involved in the synthesis of compounds 5 , containing chromone and beta - enaminoketone moieties .
results and discussion we started our study with the optimization of a model reaction between 3 - formylchromone ( 1 , 1 mmol ) , ( e ) - 3 - ( dimethylamino ) - 1 - ( 3 - nitrophenyl ) prop - 2 - en - 1 - one ( 1 mmol ) and 4 - methoxyaniline ( 1 mmol ) .
this three - component reaction was initially examined in solvents such as acetonitrile , dioxane , dimethyl sulfoxide , toluene and ethanol under heating .
however , the only isolable product was compound 4d , which originated from a reaction between the last two components without participation of the chromone substrate ( table 1 , entries 1 - 5 ) .
the use of dimethylformamide as a solvent , on the other hand , allowed the isolation of the target ( e ) - 3 - [ 3 - ( 4 - methoxyphenylamino ] - 2 - ( 3 - nitrobenzoyl ) allyl ) - 4h - chromen - 4 - one ( 5f ) .
after temperature fine - tuning ( table 1 , entries 6 - 11 ) , we identified heating in dmf at 130 degreesc for 6 h as the optimal conditions , which afforded 5f in 94 % yield ( table 1 , entry 11 ) .

all the subsequent reactions of 3 - formylchromone ( 1 ) , ( e ) - 3 - ( dimethylamino ) - 1 - arylprop - 2 - en - 1 - ones 2 and substituted anilines 3 were performed under the optimal conditions ( equimolecular amounts , dmf at 130 degreesc ) and were completed in 6 - 7 h. after completion of the reaction , removal of the solvent and purification of the residue by column chromatography , ( e ) - 3 - [ 2 - arylcarbonyl - 3 - ( arylamino ) allyl ] - 4h - chromen - 4 - ones 5 were obtained in pure form in 78 - 94 % yields ( scheme 2 and table 2 ) .
it is noteworthy , that a similar reaction , in which the less hindered , more reactive formaldehyde was employed as the aldehyde component , took a completely divergent course and afforded 5 - arylcarbonyl - 1,3 - diarylhexahydropyrimidines arising from pseudo five - component reactions of ( e ) - 3 - ( dimethylamino ) - 1 - arylprop - 2 - en - 1 - ones , two molecules of formaldehyde and two molecules of aniline [ 55 ] .

the structure of compounds 5 was deduced from one and two - dimensional nmr spectroscopic data , as detailed in supporting information file 1 for 5h as a representative example .
the structure of 5h deduced from the nmr spectroscopic studies was subsequently confirmed by single - crystal x - ray crystallographic data , as shown in fig. 1 [ 56 ] .
figure 1 x - ray structure of compound 5h .
our initial mechanistic hypothesis accounting for the formation of compounds 5 is depicted in scheme 3 .
an initial michael addition - elimination reaction , leading to the exchange between the starting arylamine 3 and dimethylamine , explains the formation of intermediates 4 , which were the final reaction products in most investigated solvents .
however , in dmf , the enamine moiety of 4 attacks the aldehyde group in 1 giving rise to 6 .
this reaction resembles one of the steps of the bayllis - hilman condensation and is presumably promoted by the presence of traces of formic acid as a contaminant of the solvent [ 57 ] .
scheme 3 initial mechanistic proposal to explain the formation of compounds 5 that was ruled out by deuteration experiments .
we established the feasibility of the first step by showing that the reaction between two of our starting enaminones , namely 2a ( ar = ph ) and 2c ( ar = 3 - no2c6h4 ) with aniline under our standard reaction conditions ( dmf , 130 degreesc ) affords the corresponding compounds 4 after 3 h in 94 % and 90 % yields , respectively .
as previously mentioned ( table 1 ) , the nature of the solvent was found to be of critical importance , and the transformation of intermediate 4 into the final products 5 was found to work only in dmf , among many investigated solvents .
since the reaction between 4 and 1 is proposed to be catalyzed by acid , we carried out the multicomponent reaction in a selection of solvents ( dioxane , acetonitrile , dimethyl sulfoxide , ethanol , ethylene glycol ) in the presence of one equivalent of hcl , but all these attempts failed , while the same conditions were successful in dmf .
these results can be explained by assuming that the initial aldol - type reaction between 1 and 4 to give 6 is reversible and is driven to completion by the reduction step , which takes place in dmf only .
thus , interestingly , the reaction does not stop at compound 6 , but instead undergoes a reductive termination step , which leads to the final products 5 .
this reduction step is intriguing , and a first mechanistic possibility could be a hydride transfer from formate anion .
while this mechanism might partly account for the observed reduction , we acknowledge that it is problematic to rely on solvent impurities to account for a stoichiometric reduction .
alternatively , dimethylformamide itself might have been the reducing agent .
there are a few scattered literature reports on the use of dmf as a reducing agent , the first of which seems to be the reduction of diazonium tetrafluoroborate salts to arenes [ 58 ] .
dmf has also been described as a reducing agent acting by hydride transfer in pd - catalyzed processes , where the metal plays a critical role in the reduction by decomposing it and facilitating hydride transfer from a pd intermediate [ 59 - 61 ] .
however , it is not clear whether the same type of reaction may take place under our conditions .
in order to test this ideas experimentally , we carried out the reaction between 3 - formylchromone ( 1 ) , ( e ) - 3 - ( dimethylamino ) - 1 - ( 4 - chlorophenyl ) prop - 2 - en - 1 - one and p - toluidine in dmf - d 7 .
if the mechanistic hypothesis was correct , this reaction should lead to a d - 7 intermediate and hence to a mixture of 5 and d - 5 , with the latter being major due to isotope effects in the tautomeric equilibrium .
however , this reaction failed to show any incorporation of deuterium into 5 , and therefore we had to abandon the hydride - transfer hypothesis .
we came up with an alternative explanation based on the well - known fact that dmf decomposes into dimethylamine and carbon monoxide at its boiling point .
carbon monoxide can act as a deoxygenating agent [ 62 ] and thus explain the transformation of 6 into 5 as shown in scheme 4 .
because of the synthetic interest of allylic and benzylic deoxygenations , further research into this reaction is under way in our laboratories .
scheme 4 alternative mechanistic proposal based on a carbon monoxide - induced deoxygenation .
conclusion we have developed a facile three - component diastereoselective synthesis of novel ( e ) - 3 - [ 2 - arylcarbonyl - 3 - ( arylamino ) allyl ] - 4h - chromen - 4 - ones containing chromone and beta - enaminoketone structural fragments from simple , readily available starting materials in a one - pot operation and in good to excellent yields .
this transformation occurs via a domino sequence of reactions , which generates one c - c and one c - n bond .
presumably , this transformation proceeds via a reaction sequence comprising a michael - type addition - elimination reaction , a nucleophilic attack of an enamine to a carbonyl , and a final deoxygenation step .
we propose that the deoxygenation step is induced by carbon monoxide resulting from thermal decomposition of the dimethylformamide solvent .

background we investigated the functional status of adult supratentorial superficial low - grade glioma ( ass - lgg ) after surgery and analyzed its relevant factors to guide the therapeutic strategy and improve the life quality of these patients .
methods clinical materials from january 2008 to december 2010 in 104 adults with ass - lgg were analyzed retrospectively .
the follow - up period ranged from 6 months to 1.5 years .
the logistic regression was used to evaluate the preoperative and postoperative variation of functional status in patients to disclose the relevant factors affecting postoperative functional status , such as age , gender , the duration of symptom , size and location of the tumor , hemisphere , resection degree , and tumor pathologic grade and preoperative karnofsky performance status ( pre - kps ) .
results four out of nine candidate factors are related to the postoperative functional status .
they are age less than 40 years , the size of tumor less than 5 cm in diameter , tumor located in the right hemisphere , and limited resection of tumor in the eloquent area .
conclusions it seems more meaningful to evaluate the functional status of the patients with ass - lgg on the basis of these clinical features , involving age , tumor size , location , and extent of resection .
keywords functional status ass - lgg surgical therapy relative factor issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background low - grade glioma ( lgg ) accounts for more than 15 % of adult gliomas and 25 % of child gliomas [ 1 ] .
the principle of surgery for lgg is to maximally protect the brain function and resect the tumor as much as possible [ 2 , 3 ] , but it seems difficult to reach a balance between resection degree and function protection because of no clear boundary between tumor and normal brain tissue .
thus , radical surgery versus functional protection is still a matter of debate in lgg patients [ 1 , 3 ] .
the karnofsky performance status ( kps ) , which is usually used for making clinical decisions , measures the variation in patient performance on three domains : activity level , ability to work , and ability of self - care .
evaluating the patient 's ability to perform ordinary activities is rated on 11 levels .
the total score ranged from 0 = dead to 100 = normal [ 4 ] .
lgg progresses slowly , with the average survival period of 6 to 8 years .
there are a lot of controversies about prognostic factors including age , pre - operative clinical manifestation , location of tumor , volume of tumor , and extent of resection in lgg .
these studies did not explore the functional status of patients preoperatively and postoperatively .
the goal of this study is to investigate the postoperative functional status variation of adult supratentorial superficial low - grade glioma ( ass - lgg ) to provide the surgical strategy .
methods we collect the data of patients who underwent surgery and were pathologically diagnosed as lgg in our department from jan .
2008 to dec .
2010. the uniform table was used to collect data including pre - and postoperative kps , age , gender , clinical manifestation , size and location of the tumor , the duration of symptom , degree of resection , and pathologic grade .
the non - conditional logistic regression was used to assess the change of functional status and analyze the factors affecting functional status .
kps was implied to elevate the functional status of patients .
the alteration of kps beyond 10 points was considered as being valuable .
spss software package version 18.0 ( spss inc. , chicago , il ) was implied in statistics .
results of 112 adult patients proven with lgg surgically , 8 patients withdraw .
in the rest 104 patients , the gender ratio ( male / female ) is 1:1.7 ( 38 / 66 ) .
the average age was 40 years old .
the duration of symptom ranged from 1 week to 3 years ( 6 months in average ) .
the average diameter of tumor was 5 cm. the locations of tumor were frontal lobe ( 31 %) , temple lobe ( 36 %) , parietal lobe ( 12 %) , occipital lobe ( 9 %) , and multi - lobes ( 12 %) .
fifty - seven patients' tumors were situated in the left cerebral hemisphere , 47 in the right side .
the degree of resection depended on whether the tumor was seated in the functional area or not .
the surgical principle was executed as follows : tumor located in the functional area - - partial resection ( 13 %) ; near the functional area - - subtotal resection ( 29 %) ; and the non - functional area - - total resection ( 58 %) .
all patients acquired pathologic diagnosis : 44 ( 42 %) were grade i and 60 ( 58 %) were grade ii. about 33 % patients had combined radiological treatment following surgery .
the average kps before surgery was 65 .
we followed up all patients for 6 to 18 months ; two patients died from complication ( kps = 0 ) .
the mean kps after surgery was 75 .
we found that four factors were associated with the postoperative functional status of patients ( table 1 ) .
they are age less than 40 years , the size of tumor less than 5 cm in diameter , tumor in the right hemisphere , and limited resection of tumor in the functional area .
to patients over 40 years , their improvement of kps was worse than the younger .
patients with the tumor 's diameter less than 5 cm have better improvement of kps than those more than 5 cm. these patients in the right hemisphere lgg have better improvement after surgery .
according to whether the tumor is located in the functional area , the patients' improvement of kps shows a trend as follows : partial resection ( functional area ) > subtotal resection ( near functional area ) > total resection ( non - functional area ) .

tumor pathologic grade : ( 1 ) who grade i ; ( 2 ) who grade ii. kps : ( 1 ) >= 70 ; ( 2 ) < 70 discussion for ass - lgg , there is still controversy on the appropriate management and impact factors for functional status , such as age , the duration of symptoms , the size and location of tumor , histology , surgical strategy , and adjuvant therapy .
age and pathologic grade were admitted as the impact factors [ 5 , 6 ] .
all of the practicable therapy can be selected for ass - lgg , but there is no enough evidence to prove which the criteria is. we analyzed the ass - lgg patients' data and compared their clinical characteristics in order to screen out the impact factors for functional status in ass - lgg patients , which might provide some references for the patients' surgical strategy .
some authors have observed that age is a determinant for prognosis : the younger the patient is , the better the prognosis is [ 6 - 9 ] .
in our research , we focused on the change of kps before and after surgical intervention , analyze the amelioration of functional status which the patients gain through surgery , and found that the improvement of kps through surgery was better in age less than 40 .
tumor less than 5 cm in diameter have more favorable prognosis than more than 5 cm. the volume of the tumor obviously increased the difficulty of surgery .
however , even for those patients whose tumor sized less than 5 cm in diameter , the patients could not get significant improvement of functional status after surgery when their initial symptom was epilepsy .
it was a negative prognostic factor for the tumor in the left hemisphere [ 10 , 11 ] .
because the left hemisphere is dominant sphere compared with right hemisphere and contains much connecting and projecting fibers , surgery might destroy the functional area and cause neurological deficits , which would absolutely decrease the patients' functional status [ 7 , 12 ] .
the exact lobe of tumor distribution is not an impact factor [ 13 ] .
we found that the patients with partial resection have better improvement of functional status if tumor just extrudes or partially infiltrates the functional area .
but this did not cause difference in average improvement of kps .
surgery is the first option in the treatment of ass - lgg until today [ 14 ] .
but there is still controversy on whether extensive resection should be done [ 1 , 2 , 15 - 18 ] .
in our study , for those whose tumor was located in the functional gyrus , the patients have better amelioration of kps when a conservative resection was done .
therefore , a limited but safe resection is beneficial to confirm the histological diagnosis of ass - lgg , relieve the burden of the tumor , and protect the function .
in our study , the duration of symptom was not the relative factor for improvement of functional status .
some potential risks existed in the delayed operation patients , such as the tumor developing into high grade , irreversible nerve injure , and intractable epilepsy [ 19 - 23 ] .
but there have been no randomized trials to analyze the benefit of surgery in early stage and the patients' status [ 24 , 25 ] .
the strategy of management is " waiting and observation " after a biopsy in many centers [ 25 , 26 ] .
many centers are more likely to treat ass - lgg with immediate postoperative radiation , especially for those whose surgery is partial resection or pathology is grade ii [ 27 , 28 ] .
early postoperative radiotherapy seemed to postpone the time of progression of low - grade glioma [ 29 , 30 ] , but we did not find evidence to prove its effectiveness in the improvement of functional status .
conclusions this study was based on the postoperative functional status analysis , which was validated by postoperative kps elevation .
to ass - lgg patients , predicting the functional status after surgery depends on the patients' age , size , location of the tumor , and extent of resection .
relieving the size of the tumor and acquiring the pathological diagnosis should be recommended instead of the en bloc resection in the functional area .

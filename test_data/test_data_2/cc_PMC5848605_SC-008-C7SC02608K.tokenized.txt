this article is licensed under a creative commons attribution 3.0 unported licence ( cc by 3.0 ) a si - rhodamine deoxylactam - based near - infrared fluorescent probe has been successfully developed for the imaging of endogenous no in living cells and mouse models .
nitric oxide ( no ) is a fundamental signaling molecule that regulates virtually every critical cellular function , and it is also a potent mediator of cellular damage in a wide range of conditions mainly via its secondary metabolite peroxynitrite ( onoo - ) .
in this work , we present an o - phenylenediamine ( opd ) - locked si - rhodamine deoxylactam , i.e.deoxy - dalsir , as a near - infrared fluorescent probe for the selective and sensitive detection of no in living cells and bodies .
not only could the probe overcome the limitations suffered by widely used and commercialized opd - type fluorescent no probes , such as the possible interferences by dehydroascorbic acid / ascorbic acid / methylglyoxal ( dha / aa / mgo ) , ph - sensitive fluorescence output , and short excitation and emission wavelengths , but it can also avoid serious interference from cysteine ( cys ) found in the rhodamine lactam - based fluorescent no probes developed later .
what 's more , the probe is fairly sensitive for no , as evidenced by its rapid fluorescence response rate ( within seconds ) , huge fluorescence off - on ratio ( 6300 - fold ) , and ultra - low detection limit ( 0.12 nm ) .
its effectiveness and practicability have been demonstrated by the successful imaging of endogenous no in raw 264.7 macrophages , pancreatic beta - cells , and endothelial ea.hy926 cells , as well as in inflamed and diabetic mouse models .
introduction nitric oxide ( no ) , a ubiquitous messenger molecule in biological systems , is endogenously produced mainly by three no synthases ( enos , nnos , and inos ) from nadph , o2 and l - arginine.1 - 5 no produced via the enos and nnos pathways is on the physiologic level , and plays various physiological roles in the human body , such as the inhibition of platelet aggregation and adhesion , blood vessel relaxation and angiogenesis , and neurotransmission .
however , upon induction by the tumor necrosis factor tnf - alpha and lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) , a high level of intracellular no could be produced via the inos pathway , which completely transforms the biological actions of no by its fast reaction with a superoxide radical ( o2 - .) to produce peroxynitrite ( onoo - ) , an extremely powerful oxidant.6 - 8 onoo - , despite its positive functions in the immune response and redox regulation of cell signal,6 could severely damage a wide variety of molecular targets , including lipids , dna , proteins and enzymes , ultimately leading to mitochondria dysfunction and cell death.7,8 moreover , there is no biological defense system against onoo - . as a result , onoo - has been implicated in a variety of disease states , including diabetes , alzheimer 's disease , cancer , arthritis , autoimmune diseases , and other disorders.4 thus , the development of methods and tools that can quickly , sensitively , and selectively track no generation in biological systems is very important for unraveling its precise roles in health and disease .
among various cellular biology tools , fluorescent probes , combined with fluorescence microscopy , have shown the unique advantages for mapping the spatial and temporal distributions of biological molecules in biological systems , due to their sensitivity , visualization , and noninvasiveness .
accordingly , in the past decade , a large number of fluorescent no probes have been exploited , which typically utilize the specific reactions of no with o - phenylenediamine ( opd ) 9 - 17 and metal - ligand complexes.18 - 22 among them , opd - based fluorescent no probes were the earliest developed and are the most versatile fluorescent indicators for no to date , and the corresponding sensing mechanism is based on the reaction of the opd group with no under aerobic conditions to form triazole derivatives , thereby turning on the fluorescence by inhibiting the photoinduced electron transfer ( pet ) process .
even so , this type of probe suffers from some limitations , such as possible interference by dehydroascorbic acid / ascorbic acid / methylglyoxal ( dha / aa / mgo ) , 23 - 26 ph - sensitive fluorescence output near neutral ph,9 - 12 and relatively long response time ( commonly more than 5 min ) .
as such , in recent years , some new strategies have been developed , such as diazo ring formation,27 no - triggered ring - opening of the opd - locked rhodamine lactam,28 reductive deamination of aromatic primary monoamines,29 the formation of se - no bonds,30 and the aromatization of hantzsch ester.31 although improved in many aspects , most of these probes still suffer from relatively long fluorescence response times , thus being unsatisfactory for real - time tracking of no in biological systems ( half - life of no : 0.1 - 5 s ) .
in addition , for tissue and living animal imaging , fluorescent probes with excitation and emission wavelengths in the near - infrared ( nir ) region ( 650 - 900 nm ) are especially favorable due to the high tissue penetration and low phototoxicity of nir light , as well as the small background autofluorescence of biomacromolecules in the nir region .
however , as far as we know , only a few fluorescent no probes could meet this requirement.32 - 35 in this work , we present an opd - locked and si - rhodamine deoxylactam - based fluorescent no probe , i.e.deoxy - dalsir , which could not only overcome the above - mentioned limitations , as evidenced by its nir excitation and emission wavelengths , negligible interference by dha / aa / mgo , fast fluorescence response within seconds , and stable fluorescence output against ph changes , but also show some additional important sensing performances , including a baseline - level background fluorescence , huge fluorescence off - on ratio ( 6300 - fold ) , and an ultra - low detection limit ( 0.12 nm ) .
these features , combined with its good membrane permeability , low cytotoxicity , and high resistance to photoxidation , have made the probe an ideal indicator for the tracking of endogenous no in vitro and in vivo .
results and discussion design rationale and synthesis of deoxy - dalsir the design of deoxy - dalsir was inspired by opd - locked rhodamine lactam ( named dalr here ) , a fluorescent no probe reported in 2008 ( scheme 1a ). 28 the easy synthesis , negligible background fluorescence , and big fluorescence off - on ratio have since made the probe an attractive platform for constructing various fluorescent no probes.34,36 - 40 however , the n - acyltriazole intermediate , arising from the initial reaction of the probe with no , suffers from slow hydrolysis , and as a result , the fluorescence response time of the probe for no is relatively long (~ 30 min ) .
more seriously , although not detected in that report , the intermediate may suffer from a cysteine ( cys ) - induced native - chemical - ligation ( ncl ) and cyclization cascade reaction41,42 leading to nonfluorescent rhodamine lactam ( scheme 1a ) , given that n - acyltriazoles are highly active for the s - acylation reaction43 - 45 and the resulting rhodamine lactam is highly stable in physiological ph.46 in fact , the possibility has been confirmed by our experimental results ( see below ) .
thus , the sensitivity of the probe for intracellular no would be discounted due to the relatively high physiological concentration of cys in living cells ( 30 - 200 mum ). 47 - 49 moreover , the visible excitation and emission wavelengths also make the probe unsuitable for in vivo imaging applications .
we envisioned that the above limitations could be overcome by an opd - locked si - rhodamine deoxylactam derivative , i.e.deoxy - dalsir ( scheme 1b ) .
according to our design principle , the reaction of deoxy - dalsir with no under aerobic conditions would bypass the n - acyltriazole intermediate to directly generate a stable n - alkyltriazole product deoxy - dalsir - t , thereby avoiding interference from a water molecule or cys .
not only that , but some additional important sensing advantages were also greatly expected for the probe : ( 1 ) it contains a potential nir si - rhodamine fluorophore,50 thus making it suitable for in vivo imaging applications ; ( 2 ) it should have low background fluorescence at a physiological ph due to its spirocyclic structure , and , even if it exists in its ring - opened form in poorly acidic conditions , the low background fluorescence is also greatly expected due to pet from the electron - rich opd group to the excited si - rhodamine fluorophore ; 51 ( 3 ) it should be able to resist interference by dha / aa / mgo , because the locked or alkylated opd group may lose its capability to condense with the three biological species to form fluorescent quinoxaline or the 1h - quinoxaline - 2 - one heterocycle ; 23 - 26 ( 4 ) it should respond rapidly to no , because , unlike the opd group of the widely used rhodamine or fluorescein - based fluorescent no probes,10,11 the opd group of the probe does not contain any electron - withdrawing substituent , thus making it highly reactive with no ; 32 ( 5 ) it should show stable fluorescence for no in a wide ph range , because its triazole product deoxy - dalsir - t lacks any acidic nh proton , thereby precluding the triazolate - induced partial fluorescence quenching near neutral ph.12 scheme 1 the strategies for the opd - locked ( si ) - rhodamine - based fluorescent no probes. with these considerations in mind , we synthesized deoxy - dalsir starting from the commercially available 3 - bromo - n,n - dimethylaniline 1 .
as shown in scheme 2 , the reaction of 1 with n - buli in thf , followed by treatment with si ( ch3 ) 2cl2 , gave diaryl silyl ether 2 ; the treatment of 2 with 2 - formylbenzoic acid in the presence of cubr2 provided si - rhodamine lactone 3 ; the reaction of 3 with pocl3 in 1,2 - dichloroethane gave si - rhodamine chloride 4 ; the reaction of 4 with opd in the presence of net3 afforded the precursor dalsir ; the desired product deoxy - dalsir was finally obtained by reducing dalsir with bh3.thf solution .
the detailed synthetic procedures are shown in the esi. + scheme 2 the synthesis of deoxy - dalsir .

the spectral response of deoxy - dalsir to no it was reported that the ring - opening transformation of rhodamine deoxylactams is more sensitive to ph than that of rhodamine lactams.52,53 we envisioned that it should also be the case for deoxy - dalsir due to the similar chemical structure .
as shown in fig. 1a , at ph = 4 deoxy - dalsir showed a strong absorption peak at 650 nm , indicating that it exists mainly as the ring - opened form in poorly acidic conditions ; as the ph values increased , the absorption intensities gradually decreased , and finally reached the baseline level when ph >= 7 , indicating that its ring - closed form dominates in poorly basic conditions .
thus , the chemical structure of deoxy - dalsir is ph - dependent .
notably , whether existing as the ring - closed form or as the ring - opened form , deoxy - dalsir showed negligible fluorescence in the nir region ( fig. 1b ) , consistent with previous speculation that deoxy - dalsir is always nonfluorescent either due to its non - conjugated spirocyclic structure or the pet quenching process ( scheme 1b ) .
importantly , in the ph region of 4 - 10 , deoxy - dalsir exhibited a dramatic fluorescence off - on response for no in the nir region ( lambdamax = 680 nm ) , strongly indicating that the probe has the potential to serve as an imaging tool for no in complex biological environments. fig. 1 ( a ) the effect of ph on the absorption spectra of deoxy - dalsir ( 4 mum ) .
( b ) the effect of ph on the fluorescence intensities of deoxy - dalsir ( 4 mum ) in the absence and presence of no ( 30 mum ) .
the conditions : b - r buffer ( 20 mm , ph = 4 - 10 , containing 20 % ch3cn ) ; lambdaex = 645 nm ; lambdaem = 680 nm ; slits : 5 / 10 nm. encouraged by the above results , we thoroughly evaluated the fluorescence sensing performances of deoxy - dalsir toward no in the simulated physiological conditions ( pbs , 50 mm , ph = 7.4 , containing 20 % ch3cn ) .
as shown in fig. 2a , the probe itself showed no observable emission when excited at 645 nm ; upon treatment with excessive no , a huge fluorescence off - on response up to 6300 - fold was immediately observed at 680 nm. remarkably , the fluorescence off - on response was considerably rapid and could be completed within seconds ( fig. 2b ) , indicative of the great potential of the probe for real - time tracing of no generation in biosystems .
further , the fluorescence titration assay revealed a dose - dependent increase in the fluorescence intensities , which reached saturation when 30 mum no was used ( fig. 2c ) .
in this case , an excellent linear correlation between the fluorescence intensities and no concentrations from 0 to 20 mum was achieved ( fig. 2d ) , and the detection limit was estimated to be as low as 0.12 nm based on 3sigma / k. to the best of our knowledge , this is the highest detection sensitivity for no achieved for fluorescent probes reported to date .
thus , it is very promising for the probe to detect trace amounts of intracellular no. to establish the selectivity , we tested the fluorescence responses of the probe toward various biologically relevant species , including reactive oxygen species ( ros : clo - , h2o2 , o2 .
- , 1o2 , . oh , no2 - , and onoo - ) , dha / aa / mgo , metal ions ( k + , ca2 + , na + , mg2 + , al3 + , zn2 + , fe2 + , fe3 + , cu + , and cu2 +) , and cys / gsh .
as shown in fig. 2e and s1 ( esi +) , all of these competitive species , including dha / aa / mgo , did not elicit any obvious fluorescence enhancement of the probe , suggesting that the probe possesses fairly high specificity for no. taken together , these results reveal that deoxy - dalsir should outperform many of the previously reported fluorescent no probes in terms of the greater fluorescence off - on ratio , faster fluorescence response rate , higher selectivity , and ultra - sensitivity. fig. 2 ( a ) the fluorescence spectra of deoxy - dalsir ( 4 mum ) before and after treatment with no ( 30 mum ) .

the conditions : pbs buffer ( 50 mm , ph 7.4 , containing 20 % ch3cn ) ; t = 25 degreesc ; lambdaex = 645 nm ; lambdaem = 680 nm ; slits : 5 / 10 nm. to confirm the reaction mechanism , we carried out hplc - ms assays on deoxy - dalsir after treatment with no. as shown in fig. s2 ( esi +) , the treatment of the probe with no mainly produced a new product , which could be assigned to n - alkyltrizole deoxy - dalsir - t based on the ms data ( m / z : calcd 516.2578 ; found 516.2582 ) .
further , we synthesized deoxy - dalsir - t by treating deoxy - dalsir with nano2 in a mixture of acoh and methanol ( esi +) , and found that its absorption and emission maxima and profiles are identical to those of deoxy - dalsir treated with no ( fig. s3 , esi +) .
obviously , the results are in good agreement with our proposed reaction mechanism ( scheme 1b ). with deoxy - dalsir - t in hand , we also tested the ph effects on its fluorescence intensities , given that the widely used opd - based fluorescent no probes commonly suffer from triazolate - induced partial fluorescence quenching via pet near neutral ph.9 - 12 as shown in fig. s4 ( esi +) , due to the absence of any acidic nh proton in its n - alkyltriazole moiety , deoxy - dalsir - t avoided the unfavorable deprotonated reaction , and thus displayed stable fluorescence in a wide ph range of 4 - 10 .
comparison of the fluorescence sensing performances between deoxy - dalsir , dalsir , and dalr it should be mentioned that dalr is a rhodamine lactam - based fluorescent no probe that was reported in 2008 ( scheme 1 ) , 28 and dalsir is a si - rhodamine counterpart of dalr and also a synthetic precursor of deoxy - dalsir ( scheme 2 ) .
to further illustrate the advantage of our design strategy , we compared the fluorescence sensing performances of deoxy - dalsir , dalsir , and dalr for no in the presence of cys , given that the n - acyltriazole intermediates resulting from the initial reactions of the latter two with no may suffer from a cys - induced ncl and cyclization cascade reaction to generate the nonfluorescent lactam products ( scheme 1a ) .
as shown in fig. 3a and s5 ( esi +) , the addition of no to the mixture of deoxy - dalsir and cys resulted in a nearly identical fluorescence off - on response to that in the absence of cys , indicating that cys hardly interfered with the reaction of deoxy - dalsir with no ; by sharp contrast , almost no fluorescence response was observed when no was added to the mixture of dalsir ( or dalr ) and cys , strongly indicating that the produced n - acyltriazole intermediate could be quickly consumed by cys .
further , we performed a control assay by the initial treatment of the three compounds with no , and then with cys .
as shown in fig. 3b and s6 ( esi +) , the fluorescence of deoxy - dalsir treated with no was not affected by the subsequent addition of cys , whereas the fluorescence of dalsir ( or dalr ) treated with no dramatically decreased with the subsequent addition of cys .
the results further support the above speculation .
notably , the incomplete inhibition of the fluorescence in the cases of dalsir or dalr ( fig. 3b ) is presumably due to the lower amount of ( si - ) rhodamine dye produced via the hydrolysis of the n - acyltriazole intermediate before cys attack ( scheme 1a ) .
in addition , the absorption spectra studies also support the above speculation .
as shown in fig. s7 ( esi +) , deoxy - dalsir , dalsir , and dalr all showed negligible absorbance in the visible and nir regions , due to their spirocyclic structures ; upon the addition of no , a strong absorption band was immediately observed for all of the three compounds , indicating that no could trigger the ring - opening of the three compounds ; after the subsequent treatment with cys , the absorption intensity for the former remained almost unchanged , but for the latter two it decreased gradually within ten minutes , further supporting that the n - acyltriazole intermediate , resulting from the reaction of dalsir ( or dalr ) with no , could be captured by cys .
to confirm the reaction , we performed hplc - ms assay on dalr pretreated with no and then treated with cys .
as shown in fig. s8 ( esi +) , in addition to the lower amounts of unreacted dalr , a main new product was observed , which was proved to be the cys - containing rhodamine lactam in terms of the ms data ( calcd : 546.2427 ; found : 546.2423 ) .
taken together , these results strongly suggest that the sensitivity of deoxy - dalsir for intracellular no should be superior to that of dalsir or dalr , given the relatively high physiological concentration of cys ( 30 - 200 mum ) in mammal cells.47 - 49 in addition , we also tested the effects of some other biological reductants , such as gsh , hcy , ascorbate ( asc ) , dithiothreitol ( dtt ) , and nahso3 , on the fluorescence response of deoxy - dalsir toward no. as shown in fig. s9 ( esi +) , the presence of these reductants virtually did not interfere with the fluorescence response of deoxy - dalsir toward no , consistent with the case of cys. fig. 3 the effects of cys ( 200 mum ) on the fluorescence responses of deoxy - dasir , dasir , and dar ( all 4 mum ) toward no ( 80 mum for deoxy - dasir ; 400 mum for dasir and dar ) in pbs buffer ( 50 mm , ph 7.4 , containing 20 % ch3cn ) at 25 degreesc .

for deoxy - dasir and dasir , lambdaex = 645 nm and lambdaem = 680 nm ; for dar , lambdaex = 545 nm and lambdaem = 582 nm ; slits : 5 / 10 nm ; voltage : 600 v. imaging exogenous and endogenous no in living cells using deoxy - dalsir before the imaging assays , the cytotoxicity of deoxy - dalsir and its alkyltrizole product deoxy - dalsir - t was tested in hela cells by mtt assay .
as shown in fig. s10 ( esi +) , after 24 h of cellular internalization of 2 - 50 mum deoxy - dalsir ( or deoxy - dalsir - t ) , > 90 % of the cells remained viable , indicative of the excellent biocompatibility of both the probe and its alkyltrizole product .
even so , in order to reduce the interference to cell proliferation and physiology , a low concentration of deoxy - dalsir ( 2 mum ) was used in the subsequent bioimaging assays .
subsequently , the specificity of deoxy - dalsir for no in living cells was evaluated .
as shown in fig. 4a , when the hela cells were treated with deoxy - dalsir , they showed almost no fluorescence ; when the deoxy - dalsir - loaded hela cells were treated with noc - 9 ( a commercially available no donor ) , strong intracellular fluorescence was observed in the red channel .
thus , the probe is cell membrane - permeable and could image exogenous no in the cellular environment .
further , when the deoxy - dalsir - loaded hela cells were treated with several representative ros , such as h2o2 , clo - , and sin - 1 ( a commercially available onoo - donor ) , respectively , almost no fluorescence was observed for each case , indicating that the probe still possesses high specificity for no in cellular environments .
notably , the continuous irradiation of the deoxy - dalsir - loaded hela cells in the absence and presence of noc - 9 in the imaging conditions for 60 min neither elicited any obvious fluorescence enhancement for the former , nor resulted in any obvious fluorescence decrease for the latter ( fig. 4b , details in fig. s11 , and esi videos s1 and s2 +) .
thus , deoxy - dalsir and its trizole product could tolerate photoxidation and photobleaching , respectively , thus being suitable for time - lapse and long - term bioimaging applications. fig. 4 ( a ) the confocal images of the hela cells pretreated with deoxy - dalsir ( 2 mum ) for 20 min , and then treated with noc - 9 ( 20 mum ) , h2o2 ( 500 mum ) , clo - ( 500 mum ) , and sin - 1 ( a onoo - donor : 500 mum ) for 20 min in pbs .

the representative images were obtained at the indicated time points .
the emission images were collected at 650 - 750 nm ( lambdaex : 633 nm ) .
the scale bar : 20 mum .
encouraged by the above results , we explored the potential applications of deoxy - dalsir for the imaging of endogenous no in living cells .
the assays were first performed in raw264.7 macrophages because these cells are known to express high - level inos upon stimulation by lps / inf - gamma.54,55 as shown in fig. 5a , the cells themselves were nonfluorescent ; when the cells were incubated with deoxy - dalsir , a weak but clear intracellular fluorescence was observed in the red channel ; when the cells were pretreated with the no synthase inhibitor aminoguanidine ( ag ) 56 and then treated with deoxy - dalsir , the intracellular fluorescence greatly decreased ; when the cells were stimulated with lps / inf - gamma and then treated with deoxy - dalsir , a dramatic fluorescence enhancement in the red channel was observed ; when the cells were stimulated with lps / inf - gamma in the presence of ag and then treated with deoxy - dalsir , only weak intracellular fluorescence was observed .
thus , deoxy - dalsir could image not only the basal no but also the stimulation - induced no in raw264.7 cells , consistent with its high sensitivity found in chemical conditions .
further , the probe was utilized to monitor endogenous no in pancreatic beta - cells ( ins - 1 ) , given that the excessive and sustained generation of no derived from inos plays an important role in pancreatic beta - cell death and the pathophysiological progression of diabetes.57,58 in the assays , streptozotocin ( stz ) , a widely used chemical to trigger pancreatic beta - cell damage and induce experimental diabetes by the production of ros and no,57 was used as the inducer .
as shown in fig. 5b , similar to the case in the raw264.7 macrophages , the probe could image both the basal and stz - induced no in pancreatic beta - cells ; moreover , the stz - induced no generation in pancreatic beta - cells is dose - dependent and temporally regulated ( fig. s12 , esi +) .
thus , deoxy - dalsir holds great potential for studying diabetes pathogenesis. fig. 5 the confocal images of no in the raw 264.7 macrophages ( a ) and pancreatic beta - cells ( b ) under different conditions .
for imaging of intracellular basal no , the cells were treated with deoxy - dalsir ( 2 mum , 20 min ) only ; for imaging of stimulator - induced no , the cells were pretreated with stimulators lps ( 20 mug ml - 1 , 6 h )/ inf - gamma ( 150 units per ml , 6 h ) ( a ) or stz ( 0.5 mm , 12 h ) ( b ) , and then treated with deoxy - dalsir ( 2 mum , 20 min ) ; for the inhibition assays , the cells were pretreated with lps ( 20 mug ml - 1 , 6 h )/ inf - gamma ( 150 units per ml , 6 h ) or stz ( 0.5 mm , 12 h ) in the presence of ag ( 0.5 mm ) and then treated with deoxy - dalsir ( 2 mum , 20 min ) .
the emission images were collected at 650 - 750 nm ( lambdaex : 633 nm ) .
the scale bar : 50 mum .
it is known that ischemia - reperfusion leads to increased inos - mediated no production and the subsequent formation of onoo - via the diffusion - controlled reaction of no and o2 .
- . 59 onoo - is a powerful oxidant and its overproduction during ischemia could cause severe damage to endothelial cells.60 - 62 thus , we also performed the assay of visualizing no production using deoxy - dalsir in endothelial ea.hy926 cells after oxygen - glucose deprivation ( ogd ) , a widely used in vitro ischemic model.63 - 65 as shown in fig. 6 , a time - dependent fluorescence enhancement was observed in the endothelial cells over 0.5 to 2 h following ogd exposure , revealing that the probe is competent enough to monitor no fluxes during ischemia. fig. 6 the time - dependent fluorescence accumulation of deoxy - dalsir ( 2 mum ) in ea.hy926 endothelial cells over 0.5 to 2 h following ogd exposure .
the images were obtained using deltavision microscopy imaging systems , and the excitation and emission bandpasses of the standard cy5 filter set were used .
the scale bar : 50 mum .
to probe the subcellular localization of deoxy - dalsir , we performed costaining assays in hela cells .
in the assays , noc - 9 was used to light up the probe in the cells , and pearson 's correlation coefficient ( r ) was used to analyze the scope of distribution between the two fluorescent channels from the probe and commercial trackers .
as shown in fig. 7a , when the cells were costained with deoxy - dalsir and a commercial mitotracker followed by noc - 9 treatment , a poor overlapping image and low pearson 's correlation coefficient ( r = 0.20 ) were observed. by contrast , when the cells were costained with deoxy - dalsir and commercial lysotracker followed by noc - 9 treatment , a good overlapping image and high pearson 's correlation coefficient ( r = 0.82 ) were found ( fig. 7b ) , indicating that the probe was mainly located in the lysosomes .
a feasible explanation is that deoxy - dasir is easy to protonate in poorly acidic conditions ( fig. 1a ) , and thus could be trapped by the poorly acidic lysosomes ( ph range : 4.5 - 5.5 ) , consistent with the proton - driving lysosome localization of the alkylmorpholine - containing lysosomal probes.66 the result is interesting because no has been reported to play important roles in lysosome - related disorders and diseases , including lysosomal storage disorders,67 gaucher 's disease,68 and danon disease,69 and there are few fluorescent no probes that can target lysosomes so far.17,35 fig. 7 the fluorescence images of the hela cells co - stained with deoxy - dalsir ( 2 mum ) and mitotracker green fm ( 0.2 mum ) ( a ) or lysotracker green dnd - 26 ( 0.07 mum ) ( b ) , and then treated with noc - 9 ( 20 mum ) .
for deoxy - dalsir , the emission images were collected at 650 - 750 nm ( lambdaex : 633 nm ) ; for mitotracker or lysottracker , the emission was at 500 - 600 nm ( lambdaex : 488 nm ) .
in vivo imaging of no generation in mouse models using deoxy - dalsir given that deoxy - dalsir could operate in the nir region , we further investigated its potential to image endogenous no in living nude mice .
the images were obtained using a bruker in - vivo fx pro small animal optical imaging system with an excitation filter of 620 nm and an emission filter of 670 nm. as can be seen in fig. 8a , when the mouse was intraperitoneally ( i.p. ) injected with deoxy - dalsir for 30 min , almost no fluorescence signal was observed ; when the mouse was i.p. injected with lps for 12 h to induce inflammation , followed by i.p. injection of deoxy - dalsir , an obvious fluorescence signal was observed in the abdominal region ( fig. 8b ) , indicating that deoxy - dalsir could image endogenous no in the inflamed mouse model .
further , we tested the in vivo sensing performance of deoxy - dalsir for no in the stz - treated mouse model .
as shown in fig. 8c , when the mouse was i.p. injected with stz for 12 h , followed by i.p. injection of deoxy - dalsir , a clear fluorescence signal was also observed in the abdominal region , consistent with inos being highly expressed in the initial stage of diabetes.57,58 thus , deoxy - dalsir holds great potential for studying the pathological roles of no in living animals. fig. 8 overlay of the fluorescence images and x - ray images of mice .
( a ) the mouse was i.p. injected with deoxy - dalsir ( 100 mul , 2 mum ) for 30 min .
( b ) the mouse was first i.p. injected with lps ( 1 mg ml - 1 , 100 mul ) for 24 h , and then i.p. injected with deoxy - dalsir ( 2 mum , 100 mul ) for 30 min .
( c ) the mouse was first i.p. injected with stz ( 40 mg kg - 1 ) for 24 h , and then i.p. injected with deoxy - dalsir ( 100 mul , 2 mum ) for 30 min .
conclusions in summary , we reported an opd - locked , si - rhodamine deoxylactam - based near - infrared fluorescent no probe deoxy - dalsir .
the probe not only overcame the limitations suffered by most of the previously reported opd - based fluorescent no probes , such as possible interference by dha / aa / mgo , slow response rate , ph - sensitive fluorescence output , and short excitation and emission wavelengths , but also avoided the severe interference from cys suffered by the opd - locked and rhodamine lactam - based fluorescent no probes developed later .
more importantly , the probe could detect no with a rapid response rate , huge fluorescence off - on ratio , and ultra - low detection limit .
these excellent sensing performances , coupled with the good cell permeability and low cytotoxicity , have enabled the probe to image endogenous no not only in raw 264.7 macrophages , pancreatic beta - cells , and endothelial ea.hy926 cells , but also in living mouse models .
the probe is greatly expected to be a useful imaging tool for studying no - related physiological and pathological functions .

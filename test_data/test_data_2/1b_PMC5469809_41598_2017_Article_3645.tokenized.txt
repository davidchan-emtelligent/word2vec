adaptation to motherhood includes maternal behaviour and lactation during the postpartum period .
the major organizing centres of maternal behaviour and lactation are located in the hypothalamic medial preoptic area ( mpoa ) and the arcuate nucleus , respectively .
insulin - like growth factor i ( igf - i ) is an effector of the growth hormone axis ; however , its function in the brain is largely unexplored .
we identified increased maternal igf binding protein - 3 ( igfbp - 3 ) expression in preoptic rat microarray data and confirmed it by rt - pcr .
in situ hybridization histochemistry showed markedly elevated igfbp - 3 expression in the mpoa and the arcuate nucleus in rat dams .
prolonged intracerebroventricular injection of igf - i or antagonism of brain igfbp - 3 with an inhibitor ( nbi - 31772 ) using osmotic minipumps increased pup retrieval time , suggesting reduced maternal motivation .
suckling - induced prolactin release and pup weight gain were also suppressed by igf - i , suggesting reduced lactation .
in addition , igf - i - induced tyrosine hydroxylase expression and its specific phosphorylation in tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons suppress prolactin secretion .
thus , igf - i may inhibit both behavioural and lactational alterations in mothers .
neurons in the mpoa and arcuate nuclei express igfbp - 3 during the postpartum period to neutralize igf - i effects .
igfbp - 3 can prevent the blockade of maternal behaviour and lactation exerted by igf - i , suggesting a novel modulatory mechanism underlying the behavioural and hormonal effects during central maternal adaptations .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction postpartum physiological and behavioural changes are important parts of mammalian reproduction , and they can be investigated using the rat as an animal model .
non - maternal females do not care about pups or even attack them , while mothers demonstrate well - defined maternal behaviours , e.g. , nest building , pup retrieval to the nest , nursing , and decreased anxiety , in addition to lactation .
these marked changes are the consequences of maternal adaptation of the central nervous system .
lactation is known to be driven by prolactin secreted from the pituitary1 .
prolactin secretion is controlled by the inhibitory effect of dopamine produced by the tuberoinfundibular dopamine ( tida ) neurons .
these neurons are located in the arcuate nucleus and project to the external zone of the median eminence and excrete dopamine into the pituitary portal blood vessels2 .
the modulators of prolactin release are known to affect the tida neurons ; however , the major intrinsic regulators of the switch in the mode of these neurons , which permits the dramatically increased prolactin secretion required for lactation , need to be elucidated2 , 3 .
prolactin and other hormones contribute to the initiation of maternal behaviours4 , 5 but are not required for it6 , 7 .
rather , maternal behaviour is controlled by a complex neuronal network8 , 9 in which the medial preoptic area ( mpoa ) plays a central role10 .
the density of active neurons is dramatically induced in the mpoa of parenting females9 .
furthermore , lesions of the mpoa abolish the nest building and retrieving components of maternal behaviour in lactating females11 - 13 , while electrical and optogenetic stimulation of this area enhances maternal responsiveness8 , 9 , 14 .
although the molecular mechanisms of maternal motivation are unknown , gene expression alterations have been hypothesized to be involved15 .
previously , we carried out a microarray study of the preoptic area and identified amylin as a maternally induced neuropeptide16 .
we validated and functionally characterized amylin in mother rats17 but did not evaluate other genes with altered mrna expression .
in the present study , we identified significantly altered genes in our previous microarray study16 , compared them with previous microarray data18 , and investigated the maternal function of a gene altered in both studies , insulin - like growth factor binding protein - 3 ( igfbp - 3 ) .
insulin - like growth factor binding protein - 3 ( igfbp - 3 ) binds insulin - like growth factor - i ( igf - i ) in the plasma and extracellular space .
although 6 other igfbps exist , igfbp - 3 is the major carrier of igf and binds the majority of igf - i in circulation19. by binding igf with high affinity in a functionally inactive complex , igfbp - 3 can inhibit the effects of igf - i. igfbp - 3 overexpressing mice show intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation , confirming the igf - neutralizing role of igfbp - 320 .
in addition , igfbp - 3 may also have igf - independent effects21 - 23 .
igfbp - 3 is normally expressed in the adult central nervous system ( cns ) at a low level , mainly in non - neuronal cells , and the effects of igfbp - 3 on the cns are largely unknown24 - 28 .
igf - i is mainly produced by the liver and is related to the growth hormone axis .
igf - i is released into the circulation and can reach the central nervous system via the blood - brain - barrier and blood - cerebrospinal fluid barrier .
in addition , igf - i is also expressed in the brain .
the actions of igf - 1 are mediated by a cell surface receptor , type 1 igf receptor ( igf - 1r ) , which is the major transducer of igf signals29 .
igf - 1 signalling in the brain supports neuronal survival and neuroprotection during the development of the cns and in adults following brain injuries30 .
in the hypothalamus , igf - i can feedback to the growth hormone axis but may also affect reproductive neuroendocrine functions31 - 33 .
however , the effects of igf - i on lactation and prolactin release , an important aspect of reproduction , have not been investigated .
in this study , we first established that the expression of igfbp - 3 was significantly elevated in lactating rat mothers compared with that in mothers whose pups were taken away right after parturition ( pup - deprived mothers ) .
second , we revealed the involvement of igfbp - 3 in the control of maternal behaviour with an igfbp - 3 antagonist .
we also showed that the effect of igf - i treatment was similar that of the igfbp - 3 antagonist .
third , we described the expression pattern of igfbp - 3 in the hypothalamus and identified two regions , the medial preoptic area and the arcuate nucleus , where its expression was markedly elevated in rat dams .
then , we demonstrated that the igf - igfbp - 3 system regulates suckling - induced prolactin release .
furthermore , we identified the underlying mechanisms of the effects of igf - i on prolactin - regulating tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons both in vivo and in vitro .
results genes with altered mrna expression in the preoptic area of rat dams to determine the genes that show altered expression in mothers , we re - evaluated our previous microarray study in the preoptic area of mother rats16 and compared the results of this analysis with a recent microarray study18 .
we identified 21 genes with highly significant differences in expression levels between the maternal and non - maternal groups ( p < 0.007 ) in our previous experiment ( table 1 ) .
islet amyloid polypeptide ( amylin ) exhibited the greatest elevation in mothers compared with that in pup - deprived controls and has been identified as a novel neuropeptide with maternal functions in the rat17 .
the expression levels of 5 other genes ( ell - associated factor 2 , dopamine receptor 4 , insulin - like growth factor binding protein 3 , follistatin , and selectin ) were 2 - 4 times higher in rat dams than those in the pup - deprived control group. of these genes , insulin - like growth factor binding protein - 3 ( igfbp - 3 ) was also up - regulated in the study of driessen et al .
2014. therefore , we choose to further investigate the maternal function of this protein .

we revealed higher igfbp - 3 mrna levels in the preoptic area of lactating dams compared with those in mothers deprived of their pups ( fig. 1b ) while there was no difference in the level of gapdh mrna between the 2 groups .
we used igfbp - 3 in situ hybridization histochemistry to determine its distribution in the preoptic area ( fig. 1c,d ) .
we used two different , non - overlapping in situ hybridization probes , which showed the same distribution pattern of igfbp - 3 expression and confirmed their specificity .
the hybridization signal was present in the medial preoptic area , especially in the medial preoptic nucleus .
the quantification of the autoradiography signal revealed an elevated level of igfbp - 3 in lactating mother rats ( fig. 1e ) .

the rostral and caudal borders of the dissected area were at + 0.6 and - 1.4 mm from the bregma , respectively .
a dorsal horizontal cut was made immediately above the level of the anterior commissure , and the lateral borders were cut 2 mm lateral to the midline .

antagonism of igfbp - 3 and igf - i suppresses pup retrieval behaviour to assess the involvement of igfbp - 3 in maternal motivation , igf - i and nbi - 31772 , a non - peptide ligand inhibitor of igfbp - 3 , were continuously administered intracerebroventricularly ( i.c.v. ) via osmotic minipumps implanted in rat mothers on the 2nd postpartum day .
the first group of mothers was treated with igf - i , while their control group ( n = 10 ) received acsf .
then , nbi - 31772 dissolved in 1 % dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) in acsf was administered i.c.v. to another group .
their control group received 1 % dmso in acsf i.c.v. we performed a pup - retrieval test on the 6th day postpartum and found a markedly elevated pup retrieval time in the igf - i - and nbi - 31772 - treated groups of mothers ( fig. 2a,b ) .
these mothers took 4 - 5 more times to carry the first pup back to the nest .
the time to retrieve the last pup was 3.7 times longer for the igf - treated mothers than that for the acsf group , but there was no difference between nbi - 31772 and its control group .
starting on the 4th postpartum day , we also investigated 5 elements of undisturbed maternal behaviour ( high kyphosis , licking / grooming , prone nursing , supine nursing , mother out of the nest ) for 5 days , 3 x 1 hour / day , 20 observations / hour and did not find any significant difference between the groups ( table 2 ) .
to examine the motility and anxiety of the mothers , we carried out an elevated plus maze test on the 7th postpartum day ( table 2 ) .
we did not find any difference between the groups in the total number of entries , a marker of motility .
igfbp - 3 antagonism and igf - i administration did not cause changes in the open arm entry percentage , a marker of anxiety .
figure 2 antagonism of igfbp - 3 and igf - i administration markedly lengthens the latency to retrieve pups .
( a,b ) mothers were treated from the 2nd postpartum day intracerebroventricularly ( i.c.v. ) via osmotic minipumps connected with brain infusion kits with artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( acsf ) ( n = 10 ) or dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) ( n = 8 ) dissolved in acsf as controls and with a nonpeptide igfbp - 3 ligand inhibitor , nbi - 31772 ( 1.66 microg / microl in dmso acsf ; n = 8 ) or igf - i ( 4 microg / microl in acsf ; n = 10 ) .
both treatments significantly increased the time to carry the first pup back to the nest (** p < 0.01 , p = 0.0017 and 0.0037 , respectively ) .
igf - i administration also increases the time to retrieve the last pup (*** p < 0.001 , p = 0.0008 ) .
the results are presented as the mean values +/ - sem .
table 2 antagonism of igfbp - 3 does not change undisturbed maternal behaviour and elevated plus - maze test performance of rat dams .
the ratio of 5 examined elements of maternal behaviours is shown in the table .
in the elevated plus maze test , unchanged total number of entries suggest unaltered motility of the animals while the lack of significantly changed open arm entry frequency suggest unaltered anxiety - like behaviour .

the quantification of the in situ hybridization histochemistry signal revealed that igfbp - 3 had an approximately 3 - fold increase in the expression level in the dorsomedial subdivision of the arcuate nucleus in mother rats compared with that in pup - deprived controls ( n = 6 - 6 ; fig. 3d1 ) .
in contrast , there was no maternal increase in the expression level of igfbp - 3 in the pvn .
figure 3 igfbp - 3 mrna expression is present in the hypothalamus .
( a,b ) dark - field photomicrographs of igfbp - 3 in situ hybridization histochemistry show that the igfbp - 3 mrna hybridization signal ( white ) is present in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus ( pvn ) and the arcuate nucleus .
in the pvn , the signal intensity appears similar between mothers ( a1 ) and pup - deprived controls ( a2 ) .
in contrast , igfbp - 3 expression seems more abundant in lactating mothers ( b1 ) than in pup - deprived rat mothers ( b2 ) in the arcuate nucleus ( c ) high magnification bright - field photomicrographs show the corresponding framed areas in b to demonstrate the increased number of individual autoradiography grains ( black dots ) in the dorsomedial subdivision of the arcuate nucleus in lactating mothers .

igfbp - 3 is expressed in tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons in the arcuate nucleus of lactating mother rats the location of igfbp - 3 - expressing neurons was similar to that of dopaminergic neurons in the dorsomedial subdivision of the arcuate nucleus in lactating dams .
tyrosine hydroxylase ( th ) is the main immunohistochemical marker of dopaminergic neurons in the arcuate nucleus , which regulates the secretion of prolactin from the pituitary .
therefore , we combined igfbp - 3 in situ hybridization histochemistry with th immunohistochemistry to determine if dopaminergic neurons express igfbp - 3 mrna in the arcuate nucleus ( fig. 4 ) .
we found a high degree of co - localization ; 67.3 % of tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic ( tida ) neurons contained igfbp - 3 and 85.9 % of igfbp - 3 neurons contained th immunoreactivity , suggesting that in the arcuate nucleus of lactating mothers ( n = 5 ) , igfbp - 3 mrna expression is markedly elevated in th - immunoreactive dopaminergic neurons .
figure 4 igfbp - 3 expression co - localizes with tyrosine - hydroxylase ( th ) in the arcuate nucleus .
the combination of igfbp - 3 in situ hybridization histochemistry ( black dots ) and th immunohistochemistry ( brown cells ) shows that th - positive cells in the dorsomedial subdivision of the arcuate nucleus express igfbp - 3 mrna in lactating rat dams .

scale bar = 400 microm for a , and 100 microm for b. igf - i lowers suckling - induced prolactin release tida neurons play a key role in the hypothalamic control of prolactin secretion .
therefore , we investigated whether maternally elevated igfbp - 3 plays a role in this regulation by sequestering igf - i in a functionally inactive complex .
igf - i and acsf , as a control , were administered i.c.v. to rat mothers via osmotic minipumps in the same composition and concentration as described above .
the serum prolactin levels induced by suckling were measured on the 14th postpartum day .
before the pups were removed for 4 h , the prolactin concentrations were 166.3 +/ - 30.3 and 103.96 +/ - 22.35 ng / ml in the acsf - and igf - i - treated groups , respectively .
the plasma prolactin concentration was reduced to basal levels by the end of a subsequent 4 - hour separation period ( fig. 5 ) .
the pups were then returned to the mother at 0 min , which led to almost immediate nursing and suckling and in turn resulted in dramatically elevated serum prolactin levels ( fig. 5 ) .
we performed a two - way repeated measures anova to examine if igf - i has an effect on suckling - induced prolactin release .
the effect of treatment was significant ( p < 0.001 , f = 33.85 ) , and the interaction of time and treatment as well ( p < 0.01 , f = 3.34 ) .
suckling induced the prolactin release significantly in both groups ( effect of time : p < 0.001 , f = 17.69 ) .
we conducted newman - keuls post hoc test to assess the specific times , at which a difference was found between acsf and igf - i treated groups .
at 15 , 30 and 60 min after the pups were returned , the prolactin level was significantly reduced by igf - i with the following p values : p = 0.0013 , p = 0.0002 , and p = 0.0167 , respectively .
these results indicate that prolonged administration of igf - i can suppress the suckling - induced prolactin release in mother rats .
the reduced prolactin secretion was also reflected by the reduced weight gain of the litters , which was 11.1 +/ - 1.4 g for the acsf - treated and 7.5 +/ - 1.8 g for the igf - i - treated mothers ( p = 0.013 ) .
figure 5 igf - i administration significantly suppresses suckling - induced prolactin release .
blood was taken first at 8.00 am , before the removal of the pups from their mother ; second , right before the pups were returned after a 4 - hour isolation period ; the 3rd , 4th , 5th and 6th blood samples were obtained at 5 , 15 , 30 and 60 min after the pups were returned ( start of suckling ) .
the diagram shows the serum prolactin levels in mothers during the pup isolation - suckling protocol .
the animals treated with igf - i are shown in red ( n = 7 ) , while the acsf - treated rats are shown in blue ( n = 8 ) .
the x - axis shows time in a nonlinear fashion .
below the x - axis , the periods of pup separation and suckling are indicated with grey arrows .
during the initial time point , before the isolation period , the plasma prolactin levels in the two groups of animals did not differ significantly as determined by newman - keuls post hoc test , even though a clear trend is visible for reduced levels in igf - i treated animals .
without the litter , the prolactin levels dropped to an equally low basal value in both groups .
then , the plasma prolactin levels rose during suckling , but igf - i administration significantly attenuated the elevation in plasma prolactin levels at 15 , 30 and 60 min after the pups were returned (*** p < 0.001 ; ** p < 0.01 , t = 4.124 , t = 4.804 and t = 3.322 , respectively ) .
the results are presented as the mean values +/ - sem .
igf - i administration induces th expression in the arcuate nucleus of mother rats in vivo we addressed the potential mechanisms involved in the actions of igf - i in the suppression of prolactin release .
th , which is the rate - limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis , regulates dopamine levels in dopaminergic cells .
therefore , we used in situ hybridization histochemistry to determine the expression level of th mrna in tida neurons ( a12 cell group ) , which play a crucial role in the regulation of pituitary prolactin secretion , and in dopaminergic cells in the zona incerta ( a13 cell group ) , which do not participate in the control of prolactin secretion .
th expression was quantified using densitometry in the brains of igf - i - and acsf - treated rat dams .
a twofold elevation in th mrna expression was found in igf - i - treated mothers in the arcuate nucleus compared with that in the control group ( fig. 6 ). by contrast , there was no significant difference between the two groups in the zona incerta ( fig. 6 ) .
figure 6 i.c.v. igf - i administration enhanced the expression of th in the arcuate nucleus .
( a,b ) the brains of igf - i - and acsf - treated rat mothers ( n = 4 in both groups ) were used for in situ hybridization histochemistry .
dark - field photomicrographs show that th mrna expression ( white dots ) was abundant in the zona incerta ( a13 dopamine cell group ) and the arcuate nucleus ( a12 dopamine cell group ) in igf - i treated mothers .
without igf - i , however , th mrna levels are low in the arcuate nucleus and are abundant in the zona incerta .

the intensity in the arcuate nuclei of igf - i treated mothers exhibited an approximate twofold increased compared with that in the acsf - treated group ( n = 6 - 6 , * p < 0.05 , p = 0.0435 ) , while a significant difference was not detected in the zona incerta .

( b ) following incubation with or without igf - i ( 12.5 microg / ml ) for 30 min , the cells were lysed , and the phosphorylation of th at the ser 31 and 40 residues was determined using phosphorylation site - specific antibodies .
data are expressed as the ratio of th intensity .
the panels beside the diagram show representative images of immunoblot bands .
western blot results show that igf - i treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation of th at the ser 31 residue ( p = 0.003 ) .
there was no difference between the two cultures at the ser 40 phosphorylation site ( n = 6 for both groups ) .
the results are presented as the mean values +/ - sem .
another group of hypothalamic cell cultures was grown in control medium for 4 days , and on the 5th day , half of them were incubated in igf - i - containing medium for 30 min at the same concentration as described above .
using western blotting with phosphorylation - site specific antibodies , we determined that igf - i stimulated a significant increase in the phosphorylation of the ser 31 residue when compared with that in cells incubated under basal conditions .
in contrast , igf - i did not enhance the phosphorylation of the ser 40 residue ( fig. 7b ) .
discussion we have now evaluated our previous microarray study , which was focused on a single gene16 , and identified 5 additional genes with highly significant and over 2 - fold increases in mother rats .
the results were compared with those of a similar microarray study18 in which 27 maternally induced genes involved in cns development were identified in mice .
there are some differences between the designs of the two studies , including rats vs. mice , postpartum day 9 vs. 7 , non - maternal females vs. virgin females as the control group , and dissected tissue from the whole preoptic area vs. only the medial preoptic area .
despite these differences , we identified a gene , insulin - like growth factor binding protein - 3 ( igfbp - 3 ) , which was elevated in mother rats in both studies .
because of the high rate of false positive data in microarray experiments34 , we measured the mrna level of igfbp - 3 in rat dams and pup - deprived controls with 2 independent methods , rt - pcr and in situ hybridization histochemistry , as igfbp - 3 induction has not been validated in the previous studies .
both methods validated the increased igfbp - 3 expression level in the preoptic area in lactating rat dams .
the confirmed maternal elevation in igfbp - 3 expression and its distribution in the region of the preoptic area involved in maternal behaviour , the medial preoptic area35 , suggest its involvement in the control of maternal behaviour .
there are several different neuronal populations in this area that contribute to this regulation network , including galanin - , amylin - or melanin - concentrating hormone ( mch ) - expressing neurons8 , 17 , 36. of these populations , the distribution of igfbp - 3 in the mpoa is similar to the expression pattern of mch .
the expression of mch increases gradually until the weaning of pups36 , 37 and has been suggested to be involved in the termination of maternal responsiveness during the late postpartum period38 .
apart from the preoptic area , igfbp - 3 expression was also detected in other hypothalamic sites by in situ hybridization histochemistry , suggesting additional functions .
the role of igfbp - 3 in the pvn is unlikely to be related to maternal modifications as the expression level did not change in mothers .
this finding also suggests that the induction of igfbp - 3 may be specific to certain cell types .
indeed , igfbp - 3 was induced in the dorsomedial subdivision of the arcuate nucleus , specifically in th - positive dopaminergic cells .
these cells are known to regulate prolactin release from the pituitary39 , which suggests an additional role for igfbp - 3 in lactation .
the igfbp - 3 distribution data in the hypothalamus have not been reported before .
a previous study focusing on the effect of hypoxia on igfbp - 3 reported its expression in the brain but described only cortical and thalamic locations40 .
the distribution of igfbp - 3 suggests that it may participate in the control of maternal behaviours and lactation .
igfbp - 3 binds igf - i with high affinity , thereby reducing the level of bioavailable igf - i. to examine the role of igfbp - 3 in the regulation of maternal behaviours and lactation , we inhibited this igf - sequestering effect with continuous and prolonged i.c.v. infusion of either igf - i or an igfbp ligand - binding inhibitor , nbi - 3177241 .
these infusions presumably increased the hypothalamic bioavailability of igf - i. although peripherally administered igf - i reduces the brain level of igf - i42 , we used continuous central infusions to ensure its permanently high bioavailability in the hypothalamus .
to administer the drugs , we used osmotic minipumps with a continuous 0.5 mul / hour flow rate for a maximum of 14 days .
another reason why we preferred prolonged igfbp - 3 inhibition is that slow , neuroplastic effects can also be detected .
for example , acute igf - i and nbi - 31772 administration have anxiolytic and antidepressant - like effects41 , 43 , while their prolonged administration can affect neuronal plasticity and neural survival in dopaminergic neurons44 , 45 .
we did not detect the anxiolytic effects of these agents following their long - term presence as neither affected the number of open arm entries in the elevated plus - maze test , a marker of anxiety - like behaviour .
the effect of igfbp - 3 inhibition in the brain on maternal behaviour was examined .
the mothers showed several aspects of normal behaviour , demonstrating that they can perform maternal behaviours .
however , we measured an increased latency to carry the first pup and the last pup into the nest following the sequestration of igfbp - 3 .
since moving the pups into the nest is the most frequently used indicator of maternal motivation as a goal - directed behaviour35 , our results suggest that elevated expression of igfbp - 3 in the mpoa in lactating dams contributes to maternal motivation .
different factors are known to contribute to the initiation and maintenance of maternal behaviour .
while peripartum hormonal changes initiate and potentiate the onset of maternal motivation , they are not required for maintenance of maternal care .
continuous exposure to pups and afferent stimuli from them are sufficient for supporting the maintenance of maternal motivation during the postpartum period15 .
the neurochemical regulatory mechanisms , which contribute to ongoing maternal care , are much less established .
based on our results , igf - i and igfbp - 3 appear to contribute to the maintenance of maternal behaviours , thereby suggesting a previously unknown mechanism involved in maternal regulations .
the lack of effects of prolonged igf - i and nbi - 31772 on activity in the elevated plus - maze test indicates that reduced maternal motivation was not a consequence of altered state of anxiety , which itself could affect maternal behaviour .
based on the induction of igfbp - 3 in th neurons of the arcuate nucleus , we also addressed its role in lactation .
in rodent mothers , lactation is driven by the suckling pup stimuli , which evokes a dramatic increase in serum prolactin levels46 .
we observed a high degree of elevation in control mothers , which received acsf injection .
however , prolactin levels increased to a significantly lesser degree after the sequestration of igfbp - 3 , supporting a role of igfbp - 3 in the regulation of prolactin secretion .
since prolactin increased significantly even in the presence of igf - i in response to suckling , it is not possible to determine if a higher concentration of igf - i could have blocked it completely or if prolactin has an igf - i - independent component .
at the same time , as prolactin levels were reduced in the presence of igf - i , the body weight of pups gained during 1 hour of suckling was also decreased in the igf - i group compared with that in the controls .
these are new findings as hypothalamic igf - i and igfbp - 3 have not been shown to control prolactin secretion in mothers .
previous studies have revealed that igf - i acts on lactation at the level of the pituitary by supporting the differentiation and proliferation of lactotroph cells47 , 48 .
the involvement of hypothalamic igf - i in reproductive neuroendocrine functions has been suggested before ; it plays a role in the regulation of gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( gnrh ) cell function .
infusion of igf - 1 stimulated secretion of gnrh32 , 49 , while its antagonism impaired oestradiol - positive feedback and luteinizing hormone ( lh ) surges31 , 33 .
binding of igf - i to its receptor results in autophosphorylation of the receptor , which in turn initiates a cascade of cellular signal transduction events .
one key step is the binding of insulin receptor substrate ( irs ) - 1 to phosphotyrosine residues on the receptor .
irs - 1 then acts as a docking protein for the downstream signal transduction components , including the ras / erk1 / 2 and pi3k / akt pathways .
igf - i supports the survival of dopaminergic neurons through these two pathways , which has mostly been investigated in the nigrostriatal dopamine system45 , 50 - 52 .
igf - i gene therapy in female rats reversed their hypothalamic da dysfunction and hyperprolactinemia53 .
in line with these data , igf - i enhanced th expression in our hypothalamic cell culture experiments and in lactating rat dams .
in dopaminergic neurons , activated erk1 / 2 proteins enhance the transcriptional activation of th by nuclear receptor related - 1 ( nurr1 ) 54 , 55 , which therefore represents a possible mechanism of the effect of igf - i on tida neurons in our study .
in addition , we also found an increase in the level of phosphorylation of the th enzyme at the ser 31 phosphorylation site by igf - i in vitro .
this finding suggests rapid enhancement of dopamine synthesis by igf - i as phosphorylation of th results in an increased catecholamine production56 .
this rapid action of igf - i on dopaminergic neurons has not been previously described .
rat th can be phosphorylated at the four following different sites : ser 8 , 19 , 31 , 40 , among which igf - i action is selective for site 31 over 40 .
erk1 / 2 serine kinases are mainly responsible for ser 31 phosphorylation57 , suggesting that igf - i may have acted via erk1 / 2 serine kinases to induce phosphorylation of th. to exert these actions , igf - i is present in the hypothalamic extracellular space at a relatively high concentration58 .
igf - i in this region could originate in neurons , which express igf - i in the hypothalamus59 , and in the circulation as igf - i can reach the hypothalamus by crossing the blood - brain - barrier or blood - cerebrospinal fluid barrier60 .
igf - i in the plasma shows decreased levels during pregnancy because of reduced growth hormone ( gh ) receptor expression in the liver .
after delivery , circulating igf - i reaches its original , higher levels61 .
the suckling stimulus is known to cause a rapid and transient increase in plasma gh62 but does not result in any significant difference between lactating and pup - deprived animals61 .
these data suggest that the igf - i concentration in the hypothalamus does not differ between lactating , pup - deprived mothers and virgin females , so its effects must be modified by other mechanisms that alter its concentration .
the elevated expression of igfbp - 3 could play an important role in decreasing effective igf - i levels in the brain extracellular space by binding to igf - i and neutralizing it. this mechanism has been suggested to underlie the effect of igf - i on tau phosphorylation in alzheimer 's disease ; amyloid - beta stimulates local astrocytes to release igfbp - 3 , which in turn inhibits igf - i - mediated suppression of tau phosphorylation63 .
we propose a similar mechanism in mother rats based on the existence of intrinsic igf - i and igfbp - 3 , which compose a system to regulate maternal changes in the brain ( fig. 8 ) .
in this model , igf - 1 inhibits maternal responses , and during the peri - and postpartum periods , the elevated expression of igfbp - 3 leads to the elimination of the inhibitory effects of igf - i ( fig. 8 ) .
since igfbp - 3 is expressed in tida neurons and probably in mch neurons of the preoptic area , igfbp - 3 can be released specifically from these cells in lactating dams to prevent the stimulatory action of igf - i on these cells .
figure 8 a model showing how the igf - i - igfbp - 3 system regulates maternal responsiveness and prolactin release .
( a ) in virgin females and pup - deprived mothers , igf - i of hypothalamic origin or from the circulation probably induce the expression of mch in the preoptic area and enhances the expression of the th enzyme , furthermore stimulates its activation by phosphorylation in tida neurons .
consequently , these cells produce more mch or dopamine , which inhibits maternal responsiveness or prolactin secretion from the pituitary .
( b ) in lactating mothers , mch and tida neurons enhance the expression of igfbp - 3 , which can neutralize igf - i. the mch or tida stimulating effect induced by igf - i diminishes , which results in a decrease in mch or dopamine production and concomitant increased maternal responsiveness or prolactin secretion due to its release from tonic inhibition .
abbreviations : ac - anterior commissure , arc - arcuate nucleus , f - fornix , mpa - medial preoptic area , och - optic chiasm , 3 v - third ventricle .
the regulation of the actions of a hypothalamic hormone by its binding proteins has also been previously suggested in other systems .
for example , the corticosteroid - binding globulin expressed in the brain can direct the action of the stress hormone64 , 65 .
the central distribution of sexual hormone - binding globulin ( shbg ) is also known66 .
in the hypothalamus , shbg expression shows alterations according to the reproductive state , so it may play role in modulating the central actions of ovarian steroids67 .
however , we also established state - dependent induction of igfbp - 3 to regulate the actions of igf - i actions on these steroids .
this hypothesis represents a novel mechanism in neuroendocrinology ; neurons can block the effects of a hormone by inducing the expression of its binding protein .
nevertheless , the recently suggested role of igf - independent effects of igfbp - 321 - 23 in maternal brain alterations cannot be excluded .
in conclusion , the major finding of this study is that prolonged igf - i treatment reduced suckling - induced prolactin release and maternal responsiveness .
in turn , igfbp - 3 expression shows marked elevation in well - defined regions of the maternal brain , including the mpoa and the arcuate nucleus .
the role of this elevated igfbp - 3 may be the neutralization of the effect of igf - i on distinct neurons by binding and sequestering it. preventing the binding of igfbp - 3 to igf - i with the ligand inhibitor nbi - 31772 significantly suppressed maternal motivation .
in addition , igf - i also inhibited suckling - induced prolactin release .
igf - i can exert this action by increasing the dopamine release of tida neurons as igf - i stimulated th expression and phosphorylation .
igfbp - 3 can reduce this action of igf - i as tida neurons in the arcuate nucleus expressed a markedly elevated level of igfbp - 3 in lactating mothers .
thus , igfbp - 3 functions as an intrinsic regulator of lactation by switching tida neurons to a mode that permits induction of prl release from the pituitary .
therefore , the igf - i - igfbp - 3 systems can play an important role in the different aspects of the adaptation of the female brain to motherhood by a novel neuroendocrine mechanism .

thick coronal brain sections were prepared around the preoptic area with a razor blade cut immediately rostral to the optic chiasm and 2 mm caudal to this level ( fig. 2a ) .
a horizontal cut immediately above the anterior commissure , and sagittal cuts on both sides of the brain 2 mm lateral to the midline were used to dissect tissue .
dissected area contained the preoptic area of the hypothalamus as well as small parts of adjacent brain structures including parts of the diagonal band of broca , the anterior commissure , the optic tract , the ventral pallidum .
in this study , however , we refer to this tissue block as the preoptic area .
the dissected tissue samples were quickly frozen on dry ice , and stored at - 80 degreesc .
real - time rt - pcr real - time rt - pcr was carried out as described previously16 .
briefly , total rna was isolated from frozen preoptic tissue samples , or lysated primer cultures .
the concentration of rna was adjusted to 2 microg / microl , and it was treated with amplification grade dnase i ( invitrogen ) .
then , cdna was synthesized using supersciptii ( invitrogen ) as suggested in the kit protocol .
the cdna was subsequently diluted ( 10x ) , and 2.5 microl of the resulting cdna was used as template in pcr reactions using sybr green dye ( sigma , st louis , mo , usa ) .
the pcr reactions were performed with itaq dna polymerase ( bio - rad laboratories , hercules , ca , usa ) and gapdh was used as housekeeping gene .
the primers were : acagccagcgctacaaagtt and gcggtatctactggctctgc for igfbp - 3 , and gctaccgagaggacagcatc and gcaccataagccttcagctc for th , and tgccactcagaagactgtgg and gtcctcagtgtagcccagga for gapdh .
cycle threshold ( ct ) values were obtained from the linear region of baseline adjusted amplification curves .
the gapdh related values were calculated using the following formula : log ( ct ( gapdh ) - ct ( igfbp3 or th )) .
statistical analyses were performed by unpaired t - test for comparisons of the two different groups .
production of in situ hybridization probe for igfbp - 3 and th preparation of the in situ hybridization probes was performed as described previously68 .

washing procedures included a 30 min incubation in rnase a , followed by decreasing concentrations of sodium - citrate buffer ( ph = 7.4 ) at room temperature , and then at 65 degreesc .
after drying , slides were dipped in ntb nuclear track emulsion ( eastman kodak , rochester , ny ) , stored for 3 weeks at 4 degreesc for autoradiography .
then , the slides were developed and fixed with kodak dektol developer and kodak fixer , respectively , counterstained with giemsa , dehydrated , and coverslipped .
densitometric analysis of in situ hybridization histochemistry signal dark - field photomicrographs were taken of the sections where igfbp - 3 and th signal was the highest in the medial preoptic area , and arcuate nucleus and zona incerta , respectively , using a 10x objective .
each image was divided into 2 halves with identical size , such that one half contained the observed autoradiography signals , while the other half served as background control .
the pixel number of these areas was calculated using imagej 1.47 v ( national institutes of health , usa ) software .
the difference between the 2 values ( the half picture containing labeled cells - the half picture containing only background autoradiography signal ) was used to quantify igfbp - 3 and th mrna levels .
mrna levels in the 2 groups were compared using two - tailed unpaired t - test .

in another experiment , 7 igf - i - treated vs. 8 acsf - treated ( control ) mothers were used to determine the role of igf - i system in prolactin release .
osmotic minipumps injecting continuously for 14 days ( alzet micro - osmotic pump model 2002 , durect ( tm )) were used loaded with igf - i ( 4 microg / microl ; 48 microg igf - i / day , peptidesciences ( tm )) , nbi - 31772 ( 1.66 microg / microl ; 19,92 microg nbi - 31772 / day , merck ( tm )) , acsf ( 147 mm nacl , 3.5 mm kcl , 2 mm cacl2 , 1 mm mgcl2 , ph = 7.2 ) , or 1 % dmso in acsf connected to cannulae according to manufacturer 's guide .
for intracerebroventricular ( i.c.v. ) implantation of the cannulae , rats were anesthetized with 0.2 ml xylazine and 0.3 ml ketamine and fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus .
the skin was cut over the skull and a hole of about 1 mm diameter was drilled into the left side of the skull above the lateral ventricle positioned at the following coordinates : antero - posterior , - 0.5 ; lateral , 1.4 ; ventral , 3.6 mm. cannulae ( alzet brain infusion kit 2 , durect ( tm )) were inserted into the lateral ventricle and fixed to the skull with cranioplastic cement and the pumps placed subcutaneously ( s.c. ) at the back of the animal .
after the operation , tardomyocel ( r ) comp .
iii antibiotics ( 0.1 ml / kg body weight ) was given s.c. to the animals for 5 days to prevent infections .
undisturbed maternal behaviour we used 36 mother rats injected i.c.v. with osmotic minipumps to investigate their undisturbed maternal behaviour .
the behaviour of each dam was recorded as described previously69 .
briefly , the undisturbed maternal behaviour was observed for three 60 min daily observation periods , 5 days long , starting on 4th day postpartum , after one day recovery following the implantation of osmotic minipumps .
observations were performed at two periods during the light phase ( 8:00 and 13:00 h , lights on at 06:30 ) and at one period during the dark phase ( 19:30 h , lights off at 18:30 ) .
within each observation period , the behaviour of each mother was scored 20 times spaced 3 min each one ( 20 observations x 3 periods per day x 5 days = 300 observations / mother ) as present or absent .
the following behaviours were scored as present or absent : high kyphosis ( hk ) : mother nursing pups in an arched - back posture with rigid limbs ; licking / grooming ( lg ) : mother licking - grooming any pup ( body + anogenital region ) ; prone nursing ( pn ) : mother nursing in a " blanket " posture in which the mother just lies over the pups , but did not have her back arched and there was no obvious extension of her legs ; supine nursing ( sn ) : mother nursing in a " passive " posture in which the mother lies on her back or side while the pups are nursed ; out of the nest ( 0 ) : mother out of the nest ( no maternal contact ) .

first , tissue was homogenized and centrifuged for 4 min on 3000 rpm .
second , the supernatant was removed and 2 ml 0.1 % trypsin ( diluted in dmem ) added to the pellet .
third , after 4 min incubation in a 37 degreesc water bath with trypsin , 2 ml 0.5 % dnase and 1 % bovine serum albumin ( diluted in dmem - p / s ) was added to the digested tissue , mixed and centrifuged for 4 min at 3000 rpm .
after this , supernatant was removed again , and 2 ml dmem - f12 - b27 - p / s was put to the pellet , mixed and centrifuged for 4 min at 3000 rpm .
this step was repeated twice and the resultant cell pellet was dispersed in dmem - f12 - b27 - p / s at a density of approximately 3.9 x 105 cells / ml and plated out at 0.5 ml / well onto 8 wells of a polylysine coated 24 - well culture plate , which were then transferred to a 5 % co2 humidified incubator at 37 degreesc .
after the first 24 h in culture , half of the medium ( 250 microl / well ) was removed and changed to 25 microg / ml igf - i ( peptidesciences ( tm ) , diluted in dmem - f12 - b27 - p / s ) in 4 wells and dmem - f12 - b27 - p / s in other 4 wells , as controls .
half of the medium was replaced every day as described above and cells were used for examination on the 5th day .
western blot analysis after removal of the medium , cells were washed twice with sterile pb solution and then mixed with ripa ( 1 m na - orthovanadate , 1 m naf , triton x100 , tne buffer : trisma base , edta , nacl , ph = 7.4 ) + protease inhibitor ( ripa + ; 40 microl pi / 1 ml ripa ) using a pipette tip .
cells were collected in ripa + and centrifuged on 4 degreesc at 16000 rpm .
protein concentration was measured and equilibrated to 1 microg / microl .
after that laemmli sample buffer ( 1 % bromophenol blue , 1.5 m trisma base , 99.5 % glicerol , sodium dodecyl sulphate salt , beta - mercaphtoethanol ) was added to the removed supernatant and heated at 90 degreesc for 5 min .
after running the gels and transferring the proteins to membranes ( 0.45 microm polyvinylidene difluoride , amersham ( tm ) hybond ( tm ) , life sciences ) , the membranes were treated with 3 % bsa solution for 2 h. then , primary antibodies were added to membranes for 24 h ( 1:1000 ; rabbit anti - phospho th at ser 31 , sab4300674 , sigma ; 1:10000 ; rabbit anti - phospho th at ser 40 , t9573 , sigma ; 1:1000 , rabbit anti - th , ab152 , millipore ; and 1:2000 , mouse beta - tubulin - iii , t8578 , sigma ) and secondary for 1 h ( 1:10000 , peroxidase labelled goat anti - rabbit or anti - mouse igg ; jackson immuno research ) .
membranes were treated with clarity ( tm ) western ecl substrate ( bio - rad ) for chemiluminescence detection , which was performed with chemidoc ( tm ) mp imaging system ( bio - rad ) .
intensity of bands was calculated using imagelab software ( bio - rad ) .
ratio of phospho th - th intensity was calculated using the following formula : ( phospho th intensity / - tubulin - iii intensity )/( th intensity / beta - tubulin - iii intensity ) and analysed with two - tailed unpaired t - test .

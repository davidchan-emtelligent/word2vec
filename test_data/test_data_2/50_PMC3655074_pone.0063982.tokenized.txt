past studies have shown that birds use their wings not only for flight , but also when ascending steep inclines .
uphill flap - running or wing - assisted incline running ( wair ) is used by both flight - incapable fledglings and flight - capable adults to retreat to an elevated refuge .
despite the broadly varying direction of travel during wair , level , and descending flight , recent studies have found that the basic wing path remains relatively invariant with reference to gravity .
if so , joints undergo disparate motions to maintain a consistent wing path during those specific flapping modes .
the underlying skeletal motions , however , are masked by feathers and skin .
to improve our understanding of the form - functional relationship of the skeletal apparatus and joint morphology with a corresponding locomotor behavior , we used xromm ( x - ray reconstruction of moving morphology ) to quantify 3 - d skeletal kinematics in chukars ( alectoris chukar ) during wair ( ascending with legs and wings ) and ascending flight ( af , ascending with wings only ) along comparable trajectories .
evidence here from the wing joints demonstrates that the glenohumeral joint controls the vast majority of wing movements .
more distal joints are primarily involved in modifying wing shape .
all bones are in relatively similar orientations at the top of upstroke during both behaviors , but then diverge through downstroke .
total excursion of the wing is much smaller during wair and the tip of the manus follows a more vertical path .
the wair stroke appears " truncated " relative to ascending flight , primarily stemming from ca .
50 % reduction in humeral depression .
additionally , the elbow and wrist exhibit reduced ranges of angular excursions during wair .
the glenohumeral joint moves in a pattern congruent with being constrained by the acrocoracohumeral ligament .
finally , we found pronounced lateral bending of the furcula during the wingbeat cycle during ascending flight only , though the phasic pattern in chukars is opposite of that observed in starlings ( sturnus vulgaris ) .

introduction birds employ their wings for a broad array of locomotor tasks .
among these , uphill flap - running or wing - assisted incline running ( wair ) is of particular interest .
during wair , the wings and legs are simultaneously engaged to scale steep inclines - a common behavior exhibited by juvenile as well as adult birds [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
wair and controlled flapping descent ( cfd ) are employed throughout development in all extant forms studied to date and have been suggested to be relevant to discussions of ecological survivorship of flightless young , as well as the evolutionary origin of avian flight [ 2 ] - [ 6 ] .
birds with intact flight feathers ( remiges ) can ascend steeper inclines during wair than those with clipped remiges [ 1 ] , suggesting that the wings provide a climbing advantage .
measurements of body acceleration and substrate reaction forces demonstrate that wing flapping increases traction [ 7 ] .
more recently digital particle image velocimetry ( dpiv ) of chukars confirmed and further refined this assessment , showing that aerodynamic forces , as opposed to inertial forces , were directly involved in generating the substrate - directed component of force [ 8 ] .
thus , compared to ascending flight at a similar trajectory , the wing path is expected to differ during wair in order to redirect the force towards the substrate , but by how much ?
in a broad comparison of flapping behaviors , a consistent pattern of wing movement was found between wair at multiple inclines , level flight , and controlled - flapping descent across ontogeny .
using 3 - d reconstruction from external wing landmarks , the sweep of the wing followed a narrow range of angles in reference to gravity , regardless of the body 's pitch or direction of travel [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
the relatively invariant stroke - plane angle (< 20 degrees ) and angle of attack in the global reference frame led to the hypothesis of a " fundamental " or " stereotypic " wing stroke , where the body is free to pitch through an arc of angles relative to the wing .
this hypothesis predicts that the skeletal joints of the wing , particularly the glenohumeral joints , operate through a broad range of excursions during different behaviors to produce a similar global stroke - plane angle .
herein , we evaluate the forelimb skeletal kinematics during ca .
70 degree wair and ascending flight to better understand the underlying joint motions in light of predictions made from external video [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
the glenohumeral joint forms from the articulation of the bulbous , ovoid humeral head and the saddle - shaped glenoid supported by both the scapula and coracoid .
a prominent acrocoracohumeral ligament ( ahl ) spans across the anterior surface of the glenoid from the elevated acrocoracoid process to the transverse sulcus on the humerus .
sy [ 9 ] implicated the ahl in restricting humeral pronation and , in part , controlling the pitch of the body between the wings .
a recent force balance model suggests a more extensive role of the ahl as a critical element that stabilizes the glenohumeral joint [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] to prevent dislocation by the primary flight musculature .
the combination of glenohumeral morphology and ahl geometry are predicted to simultaneously constrain and control joint mobility but also permit a broad range of humeral paths during different behaviors .
hence , we hypothesize that the morphology of glenohumeral joint and ahl are consistent with the predicted shoulder movements of the stereotypic wing beat hypothesis [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
many investigations of bird flight have measured external wing kinematics [ 12 ] - [ 22 ] , but only a few existing studies record skeletal movements of bird flapping their wings [ 23 ] - [ 26 ] , and these were at the time necessarily limited to single - plane fluoroscopy during level flight .
newly developed methods used here merge biplanar fluoroscopy with ct scan models to provide unprecedented accuracy and precision in reconstructing skeletal and joint movements of locomoting animals ( xromm , x - ray reconstruction of moving morphology ) [ 25 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] .
dual x - ray has been used to study hummingbird wing mechanics [ 28 ] , and although many aspects of wair have been studied , no data exist on the underlying skeletal movements .
in this study , we explore the two extremes of wing function ( flap running and ascending flight ; videos s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 ) in adult chukars ( alectoris chukar ) as animals ascend the same trajectory ( ca .
+ 70 degrees ) in order to evaluate the underlying skeletal kinematics associated with these distinct flapping behaviors .
materials and methods animals two adult chukars were raised from hatchling at the university of montana and transferred to the brown animal care facility .
animals were cared for and housed in accordance with an iacuc protocol that was reviewed and approved by the brown university institutional animal care and use committee .
brown university has an animal welfare assurance (# a3284 - 01 ) on file with olaw / nih .
animals were trained to ascend to a refuge box both with and without a ramp present .
general methodology we used markerless xromm ( x - ray reconstruction of moving morphology ) [ 25 ] , [ 27 ] also known as scientific rotoscoping [ 25 ] to reconstruct skeletal motions of the forelimb bones .
we combined biplanar x - ray video with digital skeletal models derived from ct scans of the same birds used in the video to reanimate the actual skeletal movements ( video s1 ) .
six degrees of freedom ( dof ) joint kinematics are then measured from these animated anatomical models .
complete descriptions of xromm procedures are available at xromm.org .
herein , we present only the salient details of the method relevant to the current study .
video collection the two c - arm x - ray machines were configured with a slightly oblique lateral view and a dorsoventral view ( perpendicular to the ramp ) ( fig. 1 ) .
a black nylon mesh enclosed the space around a 70 degree , 1.75 m ramp , which spanned between the floor and an elevated perch box and passed through the overlapping beam field .
two synchronized , high - speed photron 1024x1024 cameras with shutter speeds of 1 / 6000s captured digital video of the image intensifiers' video output windows at 500 fps .
although cameras were mounted at the output windows of the image intensifiers , mirroring each video left to right provided a view as seen from the x - ray emitter ( source ) rather than the detector for xromm analysis .
eight trials with at least one complete wingbeat were chosen for full analysis from a total of 82 trials ( 2 trials of wair and 2 trials of ascending flight per bird ) .
on average , birds were exposed to the x - ray beams 0.36 seconds per trial .
runs with deviations from the desired behaviors ( e.g. , stopping on the ramp during wair or paddling feet towards the netting in ascending flight ) were discarded , as were runs lacking complete view of all elements of the wing and shoulder girdle for at least one full wingbeat .

note wair images from d and e have been mirrored horizontally .
calibration we removed image distortion by capturing an image of a hexagonally perforated metal grid placed directly on the image intensifier .
a transformation matrix was derived using matlab ( mathworks ; version 2011b ) with a local weighted means solver to correct the distorted image back to a regular grid from each camera [ 27 ] .
then , an image of an acrylic calibration object with 3 mm stainless steel balls spaced 65 mm apart in the xyz direction was used to calibrate the 3 - d space .
direct linear transformation ( dlt ) coefficients were derived for each camera [ 27 ] , [ 29 ] .
ct scans and bone models the animals were euthanized and frozen following data collection .
ct scans were collected at rhode island hospital ( technique ; 80 kvp , 400 ma , 0.625 mm slice thickness ) .
individual bone models were segmented and saved as polygonal meshes using amira 4.0 ( mercury ) ( fig. 2 ) .
to provide a consistent frame of reference between individuals , we calculated the center of mass and inertial axes for each bone model by treating it as a solid [ 30 ] using matlab .
these inertial axes , combined with anatomical landmarks when needed , were used to create an anatomical reference pose and a hierarchical digital " puppet " ( fig. 2 ) in maya 2010 ( autodesk ) [ 25 ] .
potential errors in the estimation of inertial axes are variable for each bone and for axes within bones .
for example , the sternum inertial axis representing the long axis was consistent between our two specimens .
however , the other two axes were offset relative to each other .
hence , we used the long axis measured from inertial axes but set the other two axes based on anatomical landmarks that were clearly visible and representative of sturdy parts of the bone ( articular facets for the coracoid , rostral process of the sternum ) .
the inertial axes of the coracoids , humerus and ulna were visually assessed to be at least as good as using the less repeatable method of picking anatomical landmarks .
any method of attempting to establish consistent axes between two or more individuals is subject to " kinematic cross - talk " [ 31 ] where some of the rotation about one axis is interpreted within another axis .
this is a major issue when attempting to estimate bone / joint systems from external markers but is much less problematic when directly visualizing the skeleton as in our study .
joint coordinate systems ( jcs ) [ 32 ] were established for each joint to measure translations and rotations .
rotation order was xyz in maya which means that rotations first occur about z , then y , and x last when moving from the reference pose to the animated pose ( blue , green , red ; fig. 2 ) .
specific criteria for determining the reference pose of each joint and are discussed in results .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0063982.g002 figure 2 joint coordinate system overview .
each joint is allowed 6 degrees of freedom ( dof ) about an established coordinate system based on inertial axes of the downstream bone ( e.g. humeral inertial axes determine glenohumeral axes ) .
joint rotations are ordered such that rotation about the blue axis moves the other two axes and bone model ; rotation about green moves only the red axis and bone model ; and rotation about the red axis only affects the bone model .
rotation order follows blue , green and red in each joint depicted .
cst = coracosternal joint : blue - abduction / adduction ; green - protraction / retraction ; red - long axis rotation .
sh = shoulder ( glenohumeral ) , el = elbow , and wr = wrist joints : blue - elevation / depression ; green - protraction / retraction ; red - pronation / supination .
note , none of the joints are depicted in their zero reference pose .
for example , the elbow is extended 120 degrees from its zero position .
specifics for each joint are discussed in results .
the * marks the distal - most point on the os phalanx distalis digiti used to determine upstroke and downstroke transitions .
animation in markerless xromm , 3 - d polygonal bone models are manually positioned and oriented in maya to match the x - ray shadow of the bone simultaneously in both camera views .
each joint is allowed six degrees of freedom and measured using a consistent joint coordinate system [ 32 ] .
since the model is hierarchical , the most upstream elements ( pelvis and sternum ) are aligned to the entire video sequence , followed by the downstream elements in order : coracoids , humerus , forearm and hand .
ideally , the proximal element is perfectly aligned on the first pass , but occasionally , attempts to match downstream elements reveal inconsistencies in upstream positioning ( by unlikely movements or relative joint positions ) .
hence , segments of the animation are reworked iteratively to refine the animation .
the first attempt to position and orient the coracoids is done assuming symmetrical movements .
additional passes refine each individual coracoid to " fine - tune " the shoulder girdle movements .
data processing and statistics wingbeat timing a few measures , such as average velocity of the body and relative time spent in downstroke and upstroke , were taken from raw timing .
however , in order to compare joint movements for different behaviors and individuals , we divided wingbeats into downstroke and upstroke phases .
kinematic data were time - scaled to percent phase ( downstroke : 0 % = top of upstroke to 100 % = bottom of downstroke ; upstroke : 0 % = bottom of downstroke to 100 % = top of upstroke ) .
average wingbeats were determined by taking the average of each dof at each percentage timestep of upstroke and downstroke for the 4 trials of each behavior ( video s5 ) .
although studies using standard light video generally rely on a primary feather tip or the wrist position to define phase transitions e.g. [ 22 ] , we chose to define upstroke / downstroke by tracking the distal - most point on the os phalanx distalis digiti ( fig. 2 ) relative to the vertebral column ( inertial axes of notarium ) .
using the fingertip let us account for the combined contributions of shoulder , elbow and wrist movements and to compare peak elevations of each segment for all wingbeat cycles .
we discovered that for some wingbeats , the maximum elevation and depression of the humerus were offset from the fingertip turnaround .
for example , the shoulder may begin elevation while the fingertip is still moving downwards .
this led us to compare peak elevation / depression for distal points on the humerus , ulna , and fingertip for all wingbeats .
all other calculations were done in matlab .
displayed means and standard deviations were calculated by taking the time - step average of all wingbeats per behavior across all birds .
to test for statistical differences between behaviors , and to account for the non - independence of multiple measures of the same bird , we present statistical tests from repeated measures anova .
given the small attainable sample size , only a few variables differ significantly .
however , we also highlight several variables that are suggestive of differences but would require more samples to demonstrate statistical significance .
individual degrees of freedom are treated as independent variables statistically .
however , it should be noted that ordered rotations are not truly independent .
validation manual model registration ( rotoscoping ) accuracy is affected by a variety of sources [ 25 ] , including distortion errors in the video images , calibration errors , bone model reconstruction , x - ray opacity and morphological distinctness of individual bones , and overlapping x - ray shadows from multiple bones .
to gauge our accuracy , we compared marker - based and markerless results for the same sequence of video .
we implanted 3 - 4 steel beads ( 1 mm diameter ) in each of the sternum , coracoid , and humerus of a chukar carcass and collected dual x - ray video while manipulating the wing with a dowel attached to the manus .
first , bones were animated using marker - based methods [ 27 ] as the " gold standard " for bone tracking [ 33 ] .
second , marker shadows were removed from all x - ray frames ( photoshop cs5 , adobe systems inc. ; stamp tool ) , and bone movements were reconstructed by rotoscoping the same sequence of video [ 34 ] .
we calculated mean absolute error as the average absolute value of the differences between marker - based and rotoscoped bones using the joint coordinate systems established for the coracosternal and glenohumeral joints .
individual degrees of freedom may be misleading because a translational error may be compensated for by rotational correction or vice - versa .
for example , if the proximal end of the coracoid is misplaced 1 mm to the right , an additional rotation about the proximal pivot could move the distal end of the bone to nearly the correct position .
in this case , the translation and compensating rotation would both be magnified as errors when looking at the 6 dof of the coracosternal joint , but the coordinates of points on the distal coracoid would be quite accurate .
therefore , we also calculated mean absolute error for the distance between the same point on the distal coracoid and humerus for rotoscoped and marker - driven animations .
we assume the marker - driven as the gold standard , but it should be noted that marker - driven estimates also have error [ 27 ] .
results wingbeat timing the elbow and wrist moved upward prior to the tip of the manus at the downstroke / upstroke transition during ascending flight ( af : elbow : - 4.0 % +/ - 2.1 , wrist : - 2.0 % +/ - 2.2 ) and wing - assisted incline running ( wair : - 6.3 % +/ - 3.0 , - 3.1 % +/ - 4.5 ) .
the upstroke / downstroke transition during af showed almost no timing offset relative to the tip of the manus ( elbow 0.5 % +/ - 1.2 , wrist 0.4 % +/ - 1.1 ) , but during wair the elbow ( - 2.0 % +/ - 4.3 , wrist - 3.1 % +/ - 3.0 ) offsets were both larger in magnitude and more variable in pattern .
general body kinematics we measured body velocity and trajectory relative to horizontal by tracking the 3 - d position and orientation of the spina interna rostri of the sternum as a proxy for the center of mass [ 9 ] .
on average , af was faster than wair ( af : 2.0 +/ - 0.12 m / s ; wair : 1.2 +/ - 0.22 m / s ) although not statistically different ( table 1 ) .
in addition , the trajectory of ascent relative to horizontal ( fig. 3 ) was steeper during wair ( af : 59.8 degrees +/ - 8.4 ; wair : 74.6 +/ - 3.9 ) despite the fact that the starting position and ending perch were the same in both .
the body axis ( long axis of the notarium ) was more steeply pitched during af ( 53.4 degrees +/ - 4.0 ; and wair : 39.6 degrees +/ - 4.4 ) and fluctuated less as indicated by a smaller range in pitch ( af : 4.1 +/ - 1.3 ; wair 13.3 degrees +/ - 4.4 ) .
roll and yaw did not differ between behaviors and were of small magnitude ( mean range : roll , 7.9 degrees +/ - 3.6 , p - value 0.490 ; yaw , 7.4 degrees +/ - 4.0 , p - value 0.477 ) .

coracosternal joint and furcula the coracosternal joint is formed by the flattened facies articularis sternalis of the coracoid and the sulcus articularis coracoideus of the sternum ( fig. 4a ) .
the articular facet occupies the medial 70 % of the proximal coracoid ( 12.3 mm ) in our adult chukars , with the expanded lateral process comprising the remaining width .
on the sternum , the coracoid sulcus faces anteriorly at its medial margin and anterolaterally at its lateral margin .
when looking from the frontal view with the vertebral axis being horizontal , the shafts of the coracoids project laterally ~ 65 degrees. from the lateral view , they project anteriorly ~ 27 degrees from the coracosternal joint ( based on ct scans ) .
because the distal coracoids are joined by the crura of the furcula , movement at the coracosternal joint results in furcular bending .
therefore , we measured coracosternal movements in conjunction with furcular spread ( distance between the distal coracoids ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0063982.g004 figure 4 coracosternal articulation and coordinate system. a. the articular surface ( blue ) of the proximal coracoid fits into the elongate sulcus ( blue ) on the anterior end of the sternum. b. the joint coordinate system used to measure coracosternal movements .
blue = abduction / adduction axis ; green = protraction / retraction ; red = long axis rotation. c. rotation at this joint was primarily found during af. the majority of movement during downstroke was adduction , causing medial movement of the distal coracoid .
almost no protraction / retraction rotation was indicated , but internal long axis rotation was found in downstroke .
however , it should be noted that the amount of rotation in all cases is within the range of error for individual degrees of freedom ( table 3 ) .
our validations show that while the placement of the distal coracoids is highly reliable , the actual movements at the coracosternal joints are less accurate given that measures are compounded from both sternal and coracoid registration during rotoscoping .
we defined the coracosternal joint coordinate system ( jcs ) using the inertial axes of the coracoid ( fig. 4b ) ; abduction / adduction spins about the axis of greatest inertia ( blue in figs. 2 and 4b ) , long axis rotation happens about the axis of least inertia ( red in figs. 2 and 4b ) and protraction / retraction occurs around an axis perpendicular to the other two ( green in figs. 2 and 4b ) .
the rotation order follows : 1 ) abduction / adduction , 2 ) protraction / retraction , and then 3 ) long axis rotation ( blue , green , red ; fig. 4 ) .
the blue axis remained fixed to the sternum ; the red axis was fixed to the coracoid and the green axis " floats " to stay perpendicular to both [ 32 ] .
the majority of coracosternal motion underlying the furcular spread during af resulted from abduction / adduction ( 5.6 +/ - 1.6 degrees ; blue axis in fig. 4b , c ) and long axis rotation ( 4.4 +/ - 0.9 degrees ; red axis in fig. 4b , c ) .
protraction / retraction was 1.4 +/ - 1.1 degrees .
as the coracoids adduct during downstroke , they rotate about their long axis such that the laterally - facing surface faces more anteriorly .
af produced greater coracosternal motion and associated furcular spread range ( fig. 5 ; videos s6 , s7 ; af : 5.0 +/ - 0.07 mm ; wair : 2.5 +/ - 0.04 mm ) .
furcular spread during flapping motion was always greater than resting distance ( 23.0 mm ) .
during both behaviors , the furcula spread to a maximum of ca .
129 % of resting distance , but the furcula only recoiled to near resting distance during af. during wair , the furcula stayed spread between 129 and 118 % of resting distance for the entire wingstroke .
during af , mean maximum spread distance ( 29.6 mm ) was reached at the upstroke / downstroke transition .
mean minimum distance ( 24.6 mm ) occurred at 80 % of downstroke ( fig. 5 ) .
during wair , unlike af , the interfurcular distance decreased slightly and then expanded during upstroke reaching the minimum at 60 % of upstroke .
a smaller decrease occurred during downstroke ( fig. 5 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0063982.g005 figure 5 furcular deformation .
interfurcular distance change comparing af ( red ) and wair ( blue ) wingbeats .
during both behaviors , the interfurcular distance expands to 129 % of resting length near the upstroke / downstroke transition .
during wair the interfurcular distance remains relatively unchanged , but during af the coracoids adduct towards the resting configuration during downstroke and then re - expand during upstroke .

scale bar = 10 mm. glenohumeral joint the glenoid , supported by bony facets on the omal ends of both the coracoid and scapula , articulates with the ovoid humeral head .
the jcs was oriented by positioning the humeral inertial axes at the center of a sphere approximating the shape of the humeral head ( fig. 2 ) .
the zero pose was defined relative to the vertebral reference frame with the long axis of the humerus pointing directly laterally ( perpendicular to the glenoid ) , the elevation / depression axis running parallel to the vertebral column , and the protraction / retraction axis oriented dorsoventrally .
in this pose , the deltopectoral crest points anteriorly and the long axes of the distal condyles and humeral head orient dorsoventrally .
the rotation order of the jcs was as follows : 1 ) elevation / depression , 2 ) protraction / retraction , and then 3 ) pronation / supination ( blue , green , red ; fig. 2 ) .
the e / d axis ( blue in fig. 2 ) remained fixed to the glenoid , the p / s axis ( red in fig. 2 ) was fixed to the humerus and the p / r axis ( green in fig. 2 ) " floated " to remain perpendicular to both [ 32 ] .
humeral elevation / depression showed the greatest difference between af and wair for any degree of freedom in this study ( fig. 6c ) .
in terms of timing , the humerus depresses to its minimum and begins elevating prior to the end of downstroke for both behaviors .
however , peak depression is reached earlier in the downstroke in wair ( wair : 73.8 % +/ - 4.6 downstroke ; af 92.0 % +/ - 9.3 downstroke ) .
during upstroke , humeral timing was similar between af and wair , reaching a combined peak at 67.6 +/ - 10.5 % upstroke and then beginning to depress prior to the wingtip reaching its highest point .

mean peak elevation was slightly higher in wair ( 105.9 +/ - 2.1 degrees ) compared to af ( 101.6 +/ - 8.7 degrees ) .
average maximum depression revealed the largest difference between behaviors .

* = non - significant but suggest possible differences .
during both af and wair , the humerus primarily retracts during downstroke and protracts during upstroke ( fig. 6d ) .
however , timing varies between behaviors .
retraction ends at the downstroke / upstroke transition during af but continues into upstroke during wair .
the humerus primarily pronates during downstroke and supinates during upstroke ( fig. 6e ) .
the timing of beginning supination is relatively similar , occurring approximately midway through downstroke ( wair : 25.3 % +/ - 17.1 wingstroke ; af 29.4 % +/ - 3.8 ) .
although both behaviors were of similar total magnitude ( af : range 35.8 +/ - 15.1 , max - 48.8 +/ - 14.3 , min - 84.6 +/ - 3.0 ; wair : range 30.6 +/ - 6.5 , max - 57.8 +/ - 2.7 , min - 88.3 +/ - 9.6 ) , during af , the humerus underwent a second pronation phase during upstroke prior to fully supinating .
elbow the elbow joint forms between the distal humerus and proximal ulna and radius .
we did not attempt to quantify movement between the radius and ulna in this study , although relative motion is likely [ 35 ] .
to place the jcs , we visually fit a sphere to the distal condyles of the humerus to mark the position of the axes .
the orientation of the axes matched the inertial axes of the ulna .
flexion / extension occurs about an axis passing through the distal condyles of the humerus ( blue in fig. 2 ) , long axis rotation follows the axis of least inertia ( red in fig. 2 ) , and abduction / adduction ( green in fig. 2 ) remains perpendicular to both .
in the zero position , the ulna is flexed parallel to the humerus .
non - significant but suggestive differences between wair and af occur in both timing and magnitude of flexion / extension ( fig. 7c ) and magnitude of abduction / adduction ( fig. 7d ; table 2 ) .
during early downstroke of both behaviors , the ulna re - extends from the previous stroke cycle .
peak extension is reached earlier in wair ( 21 +/ - 11 % downstroke ; af 46 +/ - 15 %) .
during the remaining downstroke , the elbow flexes .
peak flexion is also earlier in wair ( 28 +/ - 10 % upstroke ; af 45 +/ - 9 %) .
af produces a higher range of flexion / extension .
a similar maximum extension is reached in both behaviors , but the af elbow reaches narrower angle of flexion ( af : range 91.2 +/ - 5.2 , max 126.7 +/ - 4.4 , min 35.4 +/ - 1.8 ; wair : range 60.8 +/ - 9.6 , max 121.7 +/ - 4.0 , min 60.8 +/ - 9.4 ) .

15 degrees more abducted over the entire wingbeat during af. the greatest abduction difference occurs in late upstroke ( fig. 7d ) .
long axis rotation showed no clear pattern ( fig. 7e ) .
wrist here we define wrist motion as the orientation of the metacarpus relative to the ulna .
as with the other joints , the more distal element 's inertial axis ( the metacarpus ) is used to establish the orientation of the jcs ( fig. 8 ) .
the primary axis is flexion / extension ( blue axis in fig. 2 ) , followed by ad / abduction ( green axis in fig. 2 ) and long axis rotation ( red axis in fig. 2 ) .
the position was established by placing a sphere in the space between the metacarpus and ulna .
in zero pose , the metacarpus is folded back parallel to and in the plane of the ulna , such that when looking from dorsal view , wrist extension produces movement in the same plane as elbow extension .

manus shown relative to a fixed antebrachium .
c - e. mean and standard deviations for each rotational degree of freedom .
time scale 0 to 50 % = downstroke , 50 - 100 % = upstroke .
the largest difference in wrist motion between af and wair was total magnitude of flexion / extension ( fig. 8c ; range : af 90 +/ - 17.8 ; wair 48.2 +/ - 15.4 ) .
the wrist extended to a much greater degree during downstroke in af and maintained the extension well into upstroke , whereas the wrist began flexing much earlier in the wingbeat during downstroke of wair ( as with the elbow ) .
abduction ( angled dorsally relative to the horizontal plane of the ulna ) was minor in both behaviors ; the majority of movement was adduction ( fig. 8d ; af 69.9 +/ - 5.1 ; wair 41.4 +/ - 5.8 ) .
both behaviors followed a similar timing pattern of being near horizontal during downstroke then gradually adducting during late downstroke .
the primary difference occurred in mid - upstroke when the wrist adducted to a greater degree during af. long axis rotation of the wrist was particularly noisy with no distinctive pattern ( fig. 8e ) .
validation here , we treat marker - driven reconstructions as the gold standard for comparison with the rotoscoped bones .
the mean standard deviations for within bone inter - marker distances in the marker driven reconstructions were 0.08 mm , which is consistent with previous measures of the precision for this xromm system [ 27 ] .
for the sternum , coracoid and humerus , the mean difference between marker - driven and rotoscoped motion varied by degree of freedom , with long axis rotation producing the highest degree of error all bones ( table 3 ) .

bone lengths are the maximum length .
individual degrees of freedom at a joint are not independent .
errors in translation may be compensated for by adjusting a rotational degree of freedom or vice versa ( see materials and methods ) .
hence , we analyzed error by comparing both measured translational and rotational degrees of freedom at the joint ( table 3 ) and by comparing residuals of points at the distal ends of the two bones ( table 4 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0063982.t004 table 4 validation residuals at distal points comparing rotoscoped bones to marker driven bones .
validation test residuals distal point on bone bone length ( mm ) x ( mm ) y ( mm ) z ( mm ) sternum 84.5 1.87 ( 0.69 ) 1.33 ( 0.41 ) 1.09 ( 0.21 ) coracoid 42.7 - 0.11 ( 0.32 ) 0.59 ( 0.27 ) 0.32 ( 0.39 ) humerus 57.2 0.43 ( 0.36 ) 0.15 ( 1.05 ) 0.00 ( 0.37 ) joint translational differences for all rotoscoped bones were between 0.25 and 0.8 mm. rotational differences were higher for the sternum and coracoid , in particular rz ( axis fixed to the proximal bone ) and rx ( axis fixed to the distal bone ) , which ranged between ca .
3 and 5 degrees , while ry retained much lower differences ( ca. 0.25 ) .
ry is the pitching axis for the sternum and the humeral protraction / retraction axis , both of which are clearly determined from the lateral view x - ray .
it seems likely that that the errors in the other two axes were linked compensations - an offset in one required an adjustment in the other .
humeral rotational errors were consistently lower about all three axes ( ca. 1.5 degrees ) .
coordinate offsets of the distal point varied between bones , with the sternum having the highest residuals ( 1.4 +/ - 0.4 mm ) , followed by the coracoid ( 0.3 +/ - 0.3 mm ) and humerus ( 0.2 +/ - 0.6 mm ) .
coracosternal joint motion is therefore the weakest measure and glenohumeral joint motion the strongest .
the coracosternal joint movement accuracy is limited by placement of both the sternum and coracoid .
however , the placement of the distal coracoid is still quite accurate .
thus , joint motions can compound errors in rotational and translational degrees of freedom but still yield accurate placement of the distal coracoid .
this also suggests that furcular spread measures are within the range of accuracy and that glenohumeral translations are not impacted by the lower resolution of sternal and coracoid alignment .
joint contributions to wing path we measured fingertip path at the distal - most vertex on the phalanx digiti majoris ( fig. 9 ) .
when viewed laterally in a gravitational ( fixed body translations but not rotations ) reference frame , the fingertip path is more steeply angled ( mean 101.6 degrees ) during wair , and less steep ( mean 142.8 ) during af ( fig. 9a ) .
differing pitch of the vertebral axis accounts for 14 degrees of the 41 degree offset between behaviors ( fig. 3 ) .
sequential removal of the effects of wrist and elbow motion does not eliminate the difference in path angle .
while keeping the elbow and wrist fixed , removal of each rotational degree of freedom from the glenohumeral joint independently shows that elevation / depression is most responsible for the difference in wingtip path angle ( fig. 9 ) .

we also assessed individual joint contributions to fingertip path by calculating the percent change in gravitational ( inertial ) x,y and z position of the fingertip ( wrist , elbow joint , glenohumeral ; fig. 9 , tables 5 , 6 ) .
not surprisingly , the glenohumeral joint accounts for the majority of fingertip movement in each of the vertical , fore - aft , and mediolateral directions for both af and wair ( table 5 ) .
although glenohumeral motion dominates , wrist and elbow account for a slightly larger proportion of mediolateral displacement ( particularly in af ) compared to vertical and fore - aft in which wrist and elbow oppose each other ( a negative number in table 5 indicates an increase in movement of the fingertip when the joint is frozen ) .
for example , during both af and wair , the elbow and wrist oppose each other in the fore / aft plane , but during af , the wrist has a greater relative impact .

such movement predicts that shoulder joint motion must be modulated to maintain a relatively constant stroke path relative to gravity .
evidence here from the wing joints demonstrates that the glenohumeral joint controls the vast majority of wing movements ( table 2 ) .
more distal joints are primarily involved in modifying wing shape .
during both behaviors , all joints are in relatively similar orientations at the top of upstroke and then diverge through downstroke ( see video s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 ) .
the primary difference between af and wair glenohumeral movement results from truncated depression of the humerus .
although the obvious explanation is the need for greater sweep of the wing for higher aerodynamic needs during ascending flight , it is also possible that the chukars truncate the wing stroke during wair to avoid collisions between the wing and the substrate .
there could be a reflex that limits wing excursion when the feet are in contact with the ground .
ascending flight and wair represent opposite ends of the mechanical power spectrum for flapping modes - ascending flight requires much higher mass - specific power [ 36 ] to drive the greater aerodynamic forces for wing - only body weight support [ 8 ] .
hence the greatly reduced excursion of the wing during wair is not surprising .
however , considering the fingertip path excursion in the context of these highly varying forces offers interesting insights .
previous studies using external video [ 4 ] found that the stroke plane angle in adults was maintained around 120 degrees during wair and ca .
135 degrees during both level and descending flight .
here , measuring fingertip in absence of feathers , we found more divergent paths of 102 degrees and 143 degrees .
the lower wair stroke angle is more consistent with juveniles [ 4 ] and may reflect the difference in measuring from feather verses fingertip .
however , the similarity of fingertip angle between ascending flight in this study and reported level and descending flight [ 4 ] is strongly supportive of a stereotypic wing path .
the steeper path of wair is also consistent with angling the aerodynamic force towards the substrate .
but what is the underlying cause of the difference in path ?
it could be the direct result of muscular control ( i.e. , differential activation of the pectoralis and other muscles ) .
however , it is interesting to consider that the difference in external aerodynamic force could potentially be involved as well .
joint motions result not only from muscular pull but also from the aerodynamic and inertial forces of the wing [ 37 ] , such that the kinematics are inherently intertwined with the kinetics .
perhaps , the direction of pull during downstroke in wair and ascending flight is exactly the same , but consistently less steep during flight behaviors due to variation in " aerodynamic protraction " from the thrust component [ 37 ] .
glenohumeral joint motion much attention has been focused on understanding control and constraints of the glenohumeral joint [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 38 ] - [ 41 ] .
the most recent interpretation suggests that the acrocoracohumeral ligament ( ahl ) permits a wide range of glenohumeral paths while simultaneously stabilizing the joint by constraining the combination of rotations and translations [ 11 ] .
dorsoventral sliding of the humeral head in the saddle shaped glenoid allows the ligament to maintain tension across a broad array of rotational combinations .
we found variation in the translational movement of the humeral head such that the head slides further ventrally during af. during wair , the humeral head rolls in a complex pattern , but is limited to the more dorsal region of the joint surface .
during downstroke of af , the humeral head appears to travel from dorsal to ventral as shown during level flight in starlings ( sturnus vulgaris ) [ 40 ] .
the patterns during these two behaviors are consistent with the expected pattern if governed by ahl constraints .
however , more detailed tracking of ahl deformation in the future should be done to confirm this hypothesis .
furcula and coracoids measures of european starling [ 23 ] and magpie ( pica pica ) [ 26 ] furculae showed that the crura spread laterally during downstroke and recoil during upstroke .
chukars also exhibited lateral bending .
however , the phasic pattern in flying chukars was reversed , spreading laterally during upstroke and recoiling during downstroke .
additionally , we found af spreading to be twice that of wair ( videos s6 , s7 ) .
however , this difference in magnitude arose not relative to resting distance , but instead relative to maximum spread .
in other words , the furcula expands similarly in both behaviors , but recoils more during af. these findings should invite further investigations into this matter in order to evaluate the functional significance of these phase - shift observations with respect to furcular bending within a wingbeat cycle .
the ends of the furcula are firmly attached to the coracoids , so bending of the furcula reflects movement of the coracosternal joint .
jenkins et.al [ 23 ] investigated several potential causes of coracosternal movement and two particularly enticing hypotheses regarding the role of the furcula arose : 1 ) an elastic energy storage mechanism , and 2 ) a secondary respiratory cycling mechanism via compression of the interclavicular air - sacs [ 42 ] .
however , little further evidence has thus far supported either energy storage [ 43 ] or a link between furcular movement and respiration [ 26 ] , [ 44 ] .
several possible mechanisms may explain the pattern seen in chukars .
first , resting length is measured on a frozen , dead bird .
" resting " length could be affected by freezing , however , resting length in a thawed chukar compared to frozen showed no difference in interfurcular distance .
hence we interpret this as an accurate resting interfurcular distance .
if so , then the coracosternal joint appears to experience a constant abduction moment .
further exploration is needed to assess the cause of this loading pattern , but the difference between af and wair may offer some insight .
the greater movement during af could be due to changing orientation of the resultant forces at the distal ends of the coracoids .
the loading on the distal end of the coracoid appears to be dominated by a medial compression of the humeral head on the glenoid and a downward and lateral pull by the acrocoracohumeral ligament , which is placed in tension by the pectoralis or supracoracoideus [ 10 ] .
changing relative magnitudes of these components could result in varying torques at the coracosternal joint .
future studies geared specifically towards quantitatively analyzing the interplay of forces responsible for furcular spreading can further take advantage of the wing - loading / kinematic variation of a wider range of flapping behaviors to isolate the cause of interfurcular distance changes found here .
elbow and wrist all elbow and wrist rotations undergo greater excursion during af ( as with the more proximal joints ) .
these differences likely reflect higher aerodynamic forces during flight , both for generating power during downstroke and reducing drag during upstroke .
one notable difference was that the elbow maintains a more abducted posture during af. this might be expected during downstroke when increased aerodynamic forces would generate a greater abducting torque .
however , abduction during af is retained and , in fact , exaggerated further in upstroke ( also to a lesser degree in wair ) .
many studies have explored the functional and evolutionary implications of the automatic flexion - extension mechanism of birds [ 35 ] , [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] .
in this study , no attempt was made to measure radio - ulnar or carpal movement ; rather , we focused on the coarser grained " wrist " movement as the orientation of the metacarpus relative to the ulna .
our results provide two insights that warrant further consideration in studies of wrist movement and mechanics .
first , the elbow and wrist flexion timing match closely during wair but are offset during af. during the latter , the extended wrist position is maintained until about 40 % of upstroke while the elbow has already fully flexed at this time .
the wrist then undergoes rapid flexion during upstroke followed by an extension pattern that is consistent between the two behaviors .
second , the wrist , like the elbow , is capable of abduction / adduction .
perhaps the more complex loading and movement ( highly adducted during downstroke ) alters the nature of automatic flexion - extension .
the pattern of retained extension of the wrist is coincident with timing of wrist adduction .
wingbeat timing we initially chose the fingertip position to define the turnaround point for upstroke and downstroke .
however , we noticed that some joint movements ( e.g. humeral elevation / depression ) were offset from the upstroke / downstroke transition such that the humerus would begin moving upward prior to the fingertip reaching the bottom of downstroke .
this finding led us to consider the possibility of a lag between turn - around timing of different joints .
many studies of avian wing function rely on downstroke and upstroke transitions to interpret timing of relevant neuromuscular events .
emg [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 47 ] - [ 50 ] , deltopectoral strain [ 51 ] - [ 53 ] , and sonomicrometry [ 54 ] , [ 55 ] are dependent on upstroke / downstroke transition timing for interpreting pectoralis function .
kinematic data from external standard video generally relies on primary tip or wrist position to determine wingbeat timing events ( upstroke / downstroke transitions ) , but the few studies using x - ray define transitions based on the distal humerus [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
our results suggest some caution in using the wrist or wing tip to assess of the relative timing neuromuscular events and skeletal timing , particularly during flap - running .
during ascending flight , we did not find evidence of an offset during the upstroke - downstroke transition , but we did find offsets in the downstroke - upstroke transition .
this suggests that wrist or wingtip position is in fact reflective of humeral turn - around during the upstroke - downstroke transition but not during downstroke - upstroke .
during the latter , the humerus begins moving upward first , followed by the wrist and then followed by the fingertip .
during wair , both wing turn - around events showed less clear patterning .
offsets were more variable and larger in magnitude .
this may be due to lower wing loadings .
the wings are less constrained by aerodynamic requirements .
more accurate assessment of this offset should be considered for other flight behaviors and species and higher frame rates are needed to more precisely assess the magnitude .
whole body movements ascending flight was faster than wair for traversing the 70 degree incline to an elevated refuge .
however , chukars chose to perform wair preferentially , only resorting to flight when the ramp was not present .
wair has been suggested as a predator escape strategy [ 1 ] , [ 4 ] and as a less fatiguing , safer way to ascend to an elevated refuge [ 36 ] .
wair also permits juvenile birds to ascend to refuges prior to having flight capable wings .
familiarity with terrain may also affect the choice of ascent mode. with training on the ramp and learning of the refuge box , our birds readily choose wair .
however , in the early stages of training they would often burst into flight in multiple directions .
it may be that knowing the terrain and refuge location permits them to make a more energetically efficient choice .
it should also be noted that the faster af speeds limited usable trials because a perfectly timed run was needed to capture a full wingbeat in both camera views .
hence , ascending flight speed may be underestimated since only trials with complete wingbeats were analyzed .
behaviors faster than 2 m / s may not be tenable for the c - arm system for adult chukars if full wingbeats are needed .
conclusions in summary , we present the first look at the skeletal movements during wair and ascending flight in adult chukars .
despite substantial differences between individual joint movements , the general path of the fingertip is consistent with the " stereotypic " flight stroke reported from external views , and also consistent with reorienting the aerodynamic force towards the substrate during wair .
we conclusively show that the glenohumeral joint is the primary influence on distal wing excursion .
in terms of individual joints , the humeral head appears to undergo a pattern of movement within the glenoid consistent with the hypothesis that the ahl constrains the movement of the glenohumeral joint .
surprisingly , we found a pattern of furcular spreading opposite that previously reported for starlings and magpies but only during ascending flight , suggesting that the enigmatic underlying cause of furcular spreading may be more complicated than previously thought .
uphill flap - running combined with a broad array of flight behaviors provides a natural experiment in skeletal and joint loading , given the increasing forces associated with the spectrum of behaviors from wair at lower to higher angles to descending , level , and ascending flight [ 36 ] , [ 50 ] , [ 56 ] .
this study provides a foundation for broader investigations of skeletal movements during a greater range of behaviors , age classes , and species .

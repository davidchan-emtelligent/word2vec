recent data comparing germ - free to conventionally - raised mice demonstrated that energy homeostasis of colonocytes is dependent on gut microbiota through regulation of short chain fatty acids ( scfa ) production and glucose utilization .
we sought to evaluate 18f - fdg pet - ct as a novel technique for functional imaging of alterations in glucose metabolism as a result of the interaction between the gut microbiota and the human host .
we conducted a prospective study in healthy humans that underwent 18f - fdg pet - ct and sampling of the gut microbiota before and after orally administered broad - spectrum antibiotics .
the primary outcomes were total and regional physiologic colonic 18f - fdg uptake ( measured as the mean and max standardized uptake values [ suvmean and suvmax ]) .
the study demonstrated significant increases in physiologic colonic 18f - fdg uptake in all study participants following antibiotic treatment and a 4 - 5log reduction of gut bacterial load .
the mean increase in suvmax was 0.63 +/ - 0.37 sd ( p = 0.004 ) and the median increase was 0.42 with an iqr of 0.40 - 0.81 .
the mean increase in suvmean was 0.31 +/ - 0.24 sd ( p = 0.01 ) and the median increase was 0.41 with an iqr of 0.06 - 0.55 .
a likely explanation for this phenomenon is a shift in colonocyte metabolism to glycolysis due to a shortage of scfa .

introduction the gut microbiota is regarded by many as a distinct organ within the human body with a central role in metabolism , immunity , and inflammation [ 1 ] .
conditions such as obesity [ 2 - 3 ] and diabetes [ 4 - 5 ] , auto - immune and allergic diseases [ 6 - 9 ] , inflammatory bowel disease [ 10 ] and cancer [ 11 - 15 ] have been previously associated with alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota , referred to as dysbiosis .
while recent advances in high throughput sequencing techniques together with the development of computational tools have enabled investigators to determine the composition of complex microbiota communities with unprecedented precision , to date there are no clinical tools to directly demonstrate the interaction between the gut microbiota as a whole and the human host .
the gut microbiota is required for energy homeostasis in colonocytes , and short chain fatty acids ( scfa ) , produced by the gut microbiota mainly from the fermentation of undigestible carbohydrates , serve as the main nutrient for colonocytes [ 16 - 18 ] .
previous in vitro and in vivo studies [ 18 ] demonstrated a shift in colonic metabolism from scfa to glycolysis in germ - free compared to conventionally - raised mice .
we recently demonstrated , both in mice and humans , that the use of a combined protocol of two antibiotics ( vancomycin and neomycin taken for 3 consecutive days ) and polyethylene glycol ( peg ) on the second day reduces both culturable bacteria and 16s gene copy number by approximately 4 - 5 logs , creating a gut microbial environment that more closely mimics a germ - free mouse [ 19 ] .
the uptake of 18f - fdg by tissues is a marker for the tissue uptake of glucose , which in turn is closely correlated with certain types of tissue metabolism .
after 18f - fdg is injected into a patient , a pet scanner can form two - dimensional or three - dimensional images of the distribution of 18f - fdg within the body .
positron emission tomography with 2 - deoxy - 2 - [ fluorine - 18 ] fluoro - d - glucose integrated with computed tomography ( 18f - fdg pet - ct ) uses a radioactive fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg ) as a marker for the tissue uptake of glucose in order to trace glucose metabolism .
the pet scanner form images of 18f - fdg distribution within the body .
the biological principle behind 18f - fdg pet means that it can potentially be used as a novel method for functional imaging of the host - microbiota interaction by capturing the change in tissue metabolism following changes in gut microbiota load and composition .
the aim of the current study was to determine whether physiologic colonic 18f - fdg uptake can serve as a functional imaging tool capable of capturing the colonic metabolic shift occurring in the human host following reduction in gut bacterial load ( required for the production of scfa ) .
this aim was investigated using a prospective clinical trial which compared the colonic 18f - fdg uptake in healthy humans before and after significantly reducing gut microbiota bacterial load via the administration of broad - spectrum antibiotics and a peg purge .
this clinical trial was embedded within a parent study ( the farmm study ) which investigated the effect of diet and antibiotics on human gut microbiome and metabolomes [ 19 ] .
materials and methods study design we conducted a sub - study embedded within a parent study , the farmm study [ 19 ] .
farmm is a randomized controlled feeding experiment examining the effect of diet and antibiotics on the composition of stool microbiome and fecal and plasma metabolome of 30 healthy volunteers age 18 - 60 years who were sequestered at the clinical and translational research center at the university of pennsylvania for the duration of the study .
individuals with inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) , celiac disease , irritable bowel syndrome ( ibs ) and those who took antibiotics in the 6 months prior to study initiation were excluded .
as part of the farmm protocol subjects provided fecal samples and underwent sigmoidoscopy with rectal mucosal biopsy prior to initiating a controlled diet .
all participants were followed for 15 days .
all participants were treated with broad - spectrum antibiotics daily for 3 days ( days 6 - 8 ) ( i.e. , vancomycin 500mg orally every 6 hours and neomycin 1000mg orally every 6 hours ). of note , these antibiotics are largely non absorbable from the gastrointestinal tract and have no known effect on the colonic epithelium [ 20,21 ] .
on day 7 , the participants also consumed 4l of polyethylene glycol ( peg ) based bowel purgative ( golytely ( r )) .
stool samples were collected daily .
rectal biopsies were obtained at days 5 , 9 , and 15 ( fig 1 ) .
the current study included 7 of the 30 participants in the farmm study who consented to undergoing pet - ct before and after the antibiotic treatment .
in a previous publication from the farmm study we demonstrated a 4 - 5 - log reduction in bacterial load following antibiotic administration using 16s rrna gene copy pcr [ 19 ] .
the study was approved by the institutional review board at the university of pennsylvania .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0192747.g001 fig 1 timing of bacterial eradication , pet imaging and endoscopy .
18f - fdg pet - ct imaging pet scans were performed on days 4 and 8 of follow - up and at the same time of the day .
subjects were fasting for 4 hours prior to fdg injection .
blood glucose levels were measured before the administration of fdg and did not exceed 200 mg / dl at the time of injection .
pet imaging scans of the abdomen and pelvis were performed 60 minutes after injection of 5 mci 18f - fdg .
ct images were acquired using a low - dose technique ( 120kv peak and 30 - 50 mas ) for attenuation correction of pet images .
all images were performed using the same scanner ( philips , ingenuity tf pet - ct ) .
18f - fdg pet - ct image analysis : image data was analyzed using a dedicated image visualization and analysis software ( osirix md 64bit version ) .
in each person , regions of interest ( rois ) were drawn manually on each transaxial slice around the outer boundaries of the four colonic regions ( cecum and ascending , transverse , descending , and rectosigmoid ) ( fig 2 ) .
in addition , we defined roi for abdominal subcutaneous tissue in three transaxial slides below the lower pole of the right kidney for adjustment purposes as a reference tissue .
the drawings were done according to anatomic definitions using ct images .
in case of overlap between areas of colon and small bowel , the areas were excluded from the rois .
uptake was measured using standardized uptake value ( suv , the concentration of tracer measured by pet in the target tissue divided by the activity injected divided by body weight ) in order to remove variability caused by the amount of 18f - fdg injected and differences in patient size .
a single investigator ( bb ) read the scans and was blinded to both subject and timing of the image ( before or after antibiotics ) .

using 18f - fdg pet scans , we visually demonstrated for the first time in healthy human subjects a change in colonic glucose metabolism resulting from a decrease in bacterial load following treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics .
these results are supported by both in vitro and in vivo data showing a shift in colonic metabolism in germ - free mice from scfa ( mainly butyrate ) , normally produced by the gut microbiota , to glycolysis. of note , the degree of change in physiologic colonic 18f - fdg uptake was inversely correlated to the initial uptake before antibiotic treatment ( fig 2 ) .
thus , individuals with the lowest initial uptake , reflecting normal diverse microbiota that allows metabolism based on scfa , had the highest increase in suv following antibiotic treatment and resulting decrease in bacterial load and transition to glycolysis - based metabolism .
the current results also suggest a possible explanation for a clinical observation , previously described in the literature , showing diffuse colonic 18f - fdg pet uptake in diabetic patients that are treated with metformin [ 22,23 ] .
this uptake can be reduced if the medication is stopped 48 hours prior to pet imaging [ 24 - 26 ] .
metformin , an oral hypoglycemic medication , is known to activate the amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk ) pathway , a key regulator of cell metabolism , promoting glycolysis and generation of atp while inhibiting anabolic pathways , thus increasing 18f - fdg avidity [ 27 - 29 ] .
this change is prominent in the colon since it is a metabolically active tissue that under normal conditions utilizes scfa as an energetic source .
this alteration observed among metformin users is similar to the metabolic shift in gut metabolism from scfa to glycolysis following reduction in colonic bacterial load. of note , some of the therapeutic effects of metformin were recently shown to be mediated through change in the gut microbiota [ 23 ] .
the study had the advantage of evaluating healthy subjects without recent antibiotic exposure that received a fixed diet under medical supervision for the study duration .
all pet scans were performed during the same time of day and in the same scanner .
all images were read by the same physician that was blinded to both patient and timing of the test in relation to antibiotic treatment .
since analysis was performed within individuals as a paired t - test , comparing uptake before and after antibiotics , there was minimal risk for additional confounding as an explanation for study results .
furthermore , in contrast to previous studies [ 30 ] , we used antibiotics with intraluminal activity and no known anti - inflammatory activity reducing nonspecific uptake .
the current study had several limitations .
our study had a small sample size .
however we were still able to detect a consistent increase in 18f - fdg uptake in all colonic regions ( although not significant for transverse and descending colon ) and correlate this increase with previously described biological pathways [ 18 ] .
the normal gastrointestinal tract exhibits low physiologic 18f - fdg uptake [ 31 ] .
suggested sources for the uptake include mucosal metabolic activity , smooth muscle contractions , and glandular secretions [ 30 ] .
additional studies suggested that this uptake may also occur due to intra - luminal activity .
since gut microbes are one of the main luminal components , it was proposed that the gut microbiota may play an additional role in concentrating luminal 18f - fdg [ 32 ] .
a single study demonstrated suppression of mean background 18f - fdg uptake in individuals without known colonic disease following pretreatment with the antibiotic rifaximin for 2 days [ 30 ] .
however since rifaximin has an additional anti - inflammatory activity , it is possible that the decrease in uptake was secondary to decrease in inflammation .
so far , no study has been able to measure intra - luminal or fecal 18f - fdg or suggest a mechanism for possible 18f - fdg transition from the intra - vascular compartment to the gut lumen .
in the current study we demonstrated not only an increase in total colonic 18f - fdg uptake but also an increase in each of the different colonic regions , further supporting a diffuse metabolic effect rather than a local effect ( such as muscle contraction or inflammation ) as an explanation for the results .
finally , we cannot rule out possible direct effects of the antibiotic therapy or the peg on the colonic mucosa as a possible explanation for the increased uptake , however since the pet imaging was done after this treatment it is a less likely explanation .
although the current study measured both suvmean and suvmax and found similar statistically significant results for both measures , we recommend using suvmax for future measurements of physiologic colonic uptake .
while suvmean includes the entire luminal uptake within the roi which is mainly composed of air that has no 18f - fdg uptake , suvmax consists largely of true mucosal uptake , increasing our ability to detect even minor changes .
in summary , we observed that reduction of colonic bacterial load by broad - spectrum antibiotics can be detected in humans by observing an increase in physiological colonic 18f - fdg uptake possibly due to a shift in colonocyte metabolism from lipolysis of scfa to glycolysis .
therefore , colonic 18f - fdg uptake may represent a novel imaging approach to capturing the functional consequence of the microbiota - host interaction .
this method may provide in the future a simple tool for early detection of a large number of diseases that are associated with change in the microbiota .
future studies are required in order to validate our results , evaluate the effect of specific diets on the microbiota and 18f - fdg uptake , and assess options of using different tracers , such as scfa , as a way to image additional metabolic pathways .
the described method views the microbiota as a distinct organ that communicates with its environment and affects multiple biological pathways .
using pet imaging allows us to study the functional aspects of microbiota - host interaction compared to genetic methods that focus on identification of specific bacterial phyla .
together these two methods are complementary and of utmost clinical significance .

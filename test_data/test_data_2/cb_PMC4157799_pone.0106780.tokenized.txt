copy number variations ( cnvs ) represent a substantial source of structural variants in mammals and contribute to both normal phenotypic variability and disease susceptibility .
although low - resolution cnv maps are produced in many domestic animals , and several reports have been published about the cnvs of porcine genome , the differences between chinese and western pigs still remain to be elucidated .
in this study , we used porcine snp60 beadchip and penncnv algorithm to perform a genome - wide cnv detection in 302 individuals from six chinese indigenous breeds ( tongcheng , laiwu , luchuan , bama , wuzhishan and ningxiang pigs ) , three western breeds ( yorkshire , landrace and duroc ) and one hybrid ( tongchengxduroc ) .
a total of 348 cnv regions ( cnvrs ) across genome were identified , covering 150.49 mb of the pig genome or 6.14 % of the autosomal genome sequence .
in these cnvrs , 213 cnvrs were found to exist only in the six chinese indigenous breeds , and 60 cnvrs only in the three western breeds .
the characters of cnvs in four chinese normal size breeds ( luchuan , tongcheng and laiwu pigs ) and two minipig breeds ( bama and wuzhishan pigs ) were also analyzed in this study .
functional annotation suggested that these cnvrs possess a great variety of molecular function and may play important roles in phenotypic and production traits between chinese and western breeds .
our results are important complementary to the cnv map in pig genome , which provide new information about the diversity of chinese and western pig breeds , and facilitate further research on porcine genome cnvs .

introduction copy number variations ( cnvs ) refer to the structurally genomic variations from hundreds of bases to several kilo - bases and the relevant complex mutations in the construction of chromosomes .
since the duplication of bar gene in drosophila melanogaster was first reported by bridge to cause the bar eye phenotype , more and more scientists focused on such dna structural duplication [ 1 ] .
in 2004 , iafrate firstly illustrated numerous structural variations in human genome , and then redon et al. defined the copy number variations in human genome [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
compared with the most frequent snp marker , cnvs cover wider genomic regions and have potentially larger effects to change gene structure and dosage , exposing recessive alleles , and alternating gene regulation and other mechanisms .
in humans , most studies on cnvs are shown to associate with mendelian diseases and complex genetic disorders , such as major depressive disorder [ 4 ] , schizophrenia [ 5 ] , cancer [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , body mass index [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , and various congenital defects [ 10 ] .
besides disorders , cnvs are also important to maintain the normal phenotypic variability .
many studies were conducted on the influence of cnvs on the phenotype of domestic animals , such as copy number variation in intron 1 of sox5 leading to the pea - comb phenotype in chickens [ 11 ] , a 4.6 - kb intronic duplication in stx17 ( syntaxin 17 ) causing hair greying and melanoma in horse [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , and the duplication of fgf3 , fgf4 , fgf19 and oraov1 resulting in hair ridge and predisposition to dermoid sinus in ridgeback dogs [ 14 ] .
a 110 kb microdeletion in the maternally imprinted peg3 domain was found , which results in a loss of paternal mimt1 expression and causes late term abortion and stillbirth in cattle [ 15 ] , and ectopic kit copy number variation may be associated with gonadal hypoplasia in northern finncattle and swedish mountain cattle [ 16 ]. george .
liu and his team detected cnvrs of cattle genomes by using different methods in diverse cattle breeds , and they also found evidence of cnvs relating with residual feed intake and resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes [ 17 ] - [ 21 ] .
in pigs , only a few such studies are reported .
for example , for the color of pig coat , the duplication and the exon - 17 - skipping mutation of kit are responsible for the dominant white phenotype and peripheral blood cell [ 22 ] - [ 24 ] .
currently , cnvs can be identified using several technologies based on either ultra - dense genotyping with snp chips , the hybridization of dna in bac / pac / oligonu - cleotide arrays or high - throughput sequencing .
the comparative genomic hybridization ( cgh ) based approach and high - throughput sequencing have excellent performance in refined resolution and relative signal intensities , while the snp genotyping array has the advantage in both genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) and cnv detection .
the snp arrays can collect normalized total signal intensity ( log r ratio - lrr ) and allelic intensity ratios ( b allele frequency - baf ) which represent overall copy numbers and allelic contrasts [ 25 ] .
besides , the snp arrays need fewer samples than cgh arrays in an experiment , thus being more cost - effective and allowing users to increase the number of tested samples on a limited budget [ 26 ] .
nowadays , snp arrays have been routinely used for cnv detection in humans and other organisms , and manufacturers of snp genotyping arrays have incorporated non - polymorphic markers into their arrays to improve the coverage of snp arrays for cnv analysis [ 27 ] .
since the accomplishment of the first human genome cnv map , many reports have been published on the characterization of the genomic architecture of cnvs in domestic species .
low - resolution cnv maps were produced for cattle , dog , pig , goat , sheep , chicken , duck , turkey and horse , showing that these structural polymorphisms comprise a significant part of these genomes [ 17 ] , [ 28 ] - [ 32 ] .

[ 37 ] have identified a large amount of cnvs in pig genome among different breeds , including several chinese breeds .
chinese indigenous breeds have larger genetic diversity than european breeds , leading to the tremendous phenotypic differences among them .
in the present study , we analyzed the difference in cnvs between chinese indigenous breeds and western breeds by using porcine snp60 beadchip and penncnv algorithm , and performed a genome - wide cnv detection in 302 pigs from six chinese indigenous breeds , three european breeds and one hybrid .
this study produced a comprehensive map of cnvs in the pig genome , which could give new insight to the interspecific diversity of different breeds and facilitate further research on porcine genome cnvs .
materials and methods ethics statement the whole blood samples were collected in strict accordance with the protocol approved by the biological studies animal care and use committee of hubei province , pr china .
all efforts were made to minimize any discomfort during blood collection .
animal samples the animals were composed of 302 pigs from nine pure breeds and one hybrid , including six chinese indigenous breeds ( 45 tongcheng pigs - tc , 23 laiwu pigs - lw , 40 luchuan pigs - lc , 23 bama pigs - bm , 26 wuzhishan pigs - wzs , 24 ningxiang pigs - nx ) and three western breeds ( 33 yorkshire pigs - ys , 33 landrace pigs - ld , 32 duroc pigs - dur ) and one hybrid ( 23 tongcheng x duroc crossbred pigs - bc ) .
genomic dna samples were extracted from whole blood of all pigs using a standard phenol / chloroform method .
all dna samples were analyzed by spectrophotometry and agarose gel electrophoresis .
snp array genotyping and quality control all 302 pigs were genotyped with the porcine snp60 genotyping beadchip ( illumina inc. , usa ) using the infinium ii multisample assay ( illumina inc. ) .
snp arrays were scanned using iscan ( illumina inc. ) and analyzed using genomestudio ( version 3.2.2 , illumina , inc. ) .
in order to exclude poor - quality dna samples and decrease potential false - positive cnvs , only the samples at a call rate > 98 % and call frequency > 90 % were reserved .
after quality control , 286 of the 302 samples were retained for cnv detection ( 43 tongcheng pigs , 22 laiwu pigs , 39 luchuan pigs , 21 bama pigs , 23 wuzhishan pigs , 23 ningxiang pigs , 31 yorkshire pigs , 31 landrace pigs , 30 duroc pigs and 23 tongcheng xduroc crossbred pigs ) .
for subsequent data analysis , a subset of 52,089 snps was selected by removing the snps located in sex chromosomes and those not mapped in the sscrofa10.2 assembly .
identification of pig cnvs penncnv was used for cnv identification by integrating a hidden markov model ( hmm ) for high resolution copy number variation detection with whole - genome snp genotyping data [ 38 ] .
this algorithm incorporates multiple sources of information , including total signal intensity data of log r ratio ( lrr ) and b allele frequency ( baf ) at each snp marker , the distance between neighboring snps , the population frequency of b allele ( pfb ) of snps , and the pedigree information where available .
the lrr and baf were exported using illumina beadstudio software .
there were three arguments in penncnv including - test , - trio and - joint .
individual - based cnv calling was performed using the - test with default parameters of the hmm model by integrating log r ratio , baf , population allele frequency and the snp distance .
to reduce the false discovery rate in cnv calling , we adopted the calling criteria that the standard deviation ( sd ) of lrr was under or less than 0.35 , and the cnv contained three or more consecutive snps .
all putative cnvs identified in this study were pooled across breeds .
finally the cnv regions ( cnvrs ) were determined by aggregating the overlapping cnvs identified across all samples according to the previously published protocols [ 3 ] .
gene contents and functional annotation gene contents in the identified cnvrs were retrieved from the ensembl genes 70 database using the biomart ( http :// asia.ensembl.org / biomart / martview /) data management system .
functional annotation of these genes was performed with the david bioinformatics resources 6.7 ( http :// david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov /) for gene ontology ( go ) terms and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) pathway analysis .
considering the limited number of genes in the pig genome have been annotated , we first converted the pig ensembl gene ids to homologous human ensembl gene ids by biomart , and then carried out the go and pathway analysis .
statistical significance was assessed by using p value of a modified fisher 's exact test and benjamini correction for multiple testing .
validation of cnvrs by qpcr cnvrs were confirmed by qpcr using the roche lightcyclerw 480 detection system and the 2 - deltadeltact method which compares the deltact ( cycle threshold ( ct ) of the target region minus ct of the control region ) value of samples with cnv to the deltact of a calibrator without cnv [ 39 ] .
the primers were designed using the primer premier 5 software ( table s10 in file s1 ) .
as previously reported , the copy number of each cnvr was normalized against the gcg gene , a control region in the genome with no variation in the copy numbers between the pigs [ 29 ] .
triplicate wells of reactions ( 10 microl ) contained 5 microl sybr green real - time pcr master mix , 1 microl of 50 ng / microl gdna , 0.3 microl 10 microm of each primer and 3.4 microl ddh2o .
the cycling conditions consisted of 95degreesc for 10 min , 40 cycles ( at 94degreesc for 30 sec , 60degreesc for 30 sec , and 72degreesc for 10 sec ) , and fluorescence acquisition at 72degreesc in single mode .
the specific pcr products were confirmed by the results of melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis .
results and discussion genome - wide cnvs detection a total of 1272 cnvs were assessed by penncnv on 18 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and 348 cnvrs were acquired by aggregating overlapping cnvs ( table s1a in file s1 ) , covering 150.49 mb of the pig genome and about 6.14 % of the autosomal genome sequence , with an average number of 4.45 cnvs per individual .
among the 348 cnvr events , 88 were found to be gain , 243 , loss and 17 , both ( loss and gain within the same region ) events , which were dispersed all over the 18 autosomes and ranged from 4.93 kb to 12.41 mb in length with a mean of 443.24 kb and median of 170.77 kb. the location and characteristics of all cnvrs on autosomal chromosomes are presented in figure 1 , showing that these cnvrs are not uniformly distributed among different chromosomes .
the proportion of cnvrs on the 18 pairs of autosomal chromosomes varies from 1.17 - 20.91 % and chromosome 1 harbors the greatest number ( 43 ) of cnvrs ( table 1 ) .

these cnvrs covered 103.01 mb , and ranged from 5.75 kb to 12.41 mb with a mean of 620.57 kb and median of 217.76 kb ( table s1b in file s1 ) .
previous studies always analyzed their results after eliminating the only individual event , but when compared with their results , more than 36 % of the only individual events in our results overlapped with their data , suggesting the loss of much useful information by eliminating the only individual events .
thus , we analyzed the whole 348 cnvrs during the following research .
in our study , the 6.14 % cnvr coverage in the autosomal genome sequence was consistent with the 0.31 % to 5.84 % coverage of analyzed genome on pigs reported previously [ 29 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 36 ] .
in humans , cnvr coverage was reported to be as high as 12 % of the genome when redon et al first identified 1447 cnvrs in human genome [ 3 ] .
the cnvs were anticipated to cover up to 13 % of the human genome [ 40 ] .
in bovines , the cnvr coverage was reported to be from 0.68 % to 4.6 % of the genome [ 17 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] .
a great difference was found in the cnvr numbers among the nine breeds .
among the six chinese indigenous breeds , the maximum number of cnvrs was detected in luchuan pigs , accounting for 125 cnvrs ( 33.78 %) , followed by tongcheng 84 ( 22.7 %) and laiwu 76 ( 20.54 %) pigs .
the minimum number of cnvrs was only 35 ( 9.46 %) in wuzhishan pigs. with respect to european breeds , 54 ( 14.59 %) , 48 ( 12.97 %) and 37 ( 10 %) cnvrs were found in yorkshire , landrace and duroc pigs , respectively .
altogether 240 unique cnvrs were detectable in the nine breeds , with luchuan pigs harboring the maximum number ( table 2 ) .

39 individuals were only found one cnv event , 49 individuals were found two cnv events , and most individuals were three cnv events ( table s2 in file s1 ). with an increase in copy number variation , the detected individuals became fewer and fewer , indicating that most animals can survive through only a few cnvs .
cnv numbers differed greatly among different pig populations too .
the average number of cnvs per population was 127.2 , ranging from 67 ( wuzhishan ) to 279 ( luchuan ) .
the maximum number of cnvs per sample was detected in laiwu pigs ( 7.32 cnvs per sample on average ) against the minimum number of 2.63 cnvs per animal in duroc pigs .
similar to the finding in human [ 43 ] , most cnvrs ( 68.77 %) were restricted to one population , probably due to sampling variances or recent evolution events .
gene content of pig cnvrs totally , 798 genes within the identified cnvrs were retrieved from the ensembl genes 70 database using the biomart data management system , including 651 protein - coding genes , 10 pseudogenes , 30 mirna , 49 snrna , 35 snorna , 13 miscrna , 7 rrna , and 3 processed - transcripts .
in cnvrs , 455 of the 798 genes were identified to be loss events , 303 and 39 genes , gain and both events , respectively ( table s3 in file s1 ) .
the average number of genes per mb of 348 cnvrs was 5.29 , which was less than that on the whole genome ( 8.62 ) according to the sus crofa 10.2 assembly in ensembl ( http :// a sia.ensembl.org /) , suggesting that cnvs are located preferably in gene - poor regions , probably because changes in copy number for genes that perform essential functions are subject to strong purifying selection [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] .
in order to provide insight into the functional enrichment of the cnvs , gene ontology ( go ) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) pathway analyses were performed with the david bioinformatics resources .
the gene ontology ( go ) analysis revealed that cnv genes mainly participated in cell adhesion , phosphorus metabolic process , cell projection , phosphorylation , cellular component morphogenesis , cell differentiation , muscle cell development and other basic metabolic processes .
the kegg pathway analysis indicated that genes in cnvrs were involved in seven pathways including phosphatidylinositol signaling system , inositol phosphate metabolism , oocyte meiosis , cell cycle , leukocyte transendothelial migration , alzheimer 's disease and huntington 's disease ( table s4 in file s1 and s5 in file s1 ) .
additionally , 3258 qtls out of 8000 which affect a wide range of traits , such as immune capacity , disease resistance , meat quality , growth and litter size , were found in 240 cnvrs by comparing the overlapping of cnvrs with qtls in the pig qtldb ( http :// www.animalgenome.org / cgi - bin / qtldb / ss / index ) ( table s6 in file s1 ) .
differences between chinese normal size pig and minipig breeds in our population , four of the six chinese breeds are normal size ( tongcheng , laiwu , luchuan and ningxiang ) , the other two are minipig breeds .
there are many differences of cnvs between these two type pigs .
the four normal size breeds harbored 179 cnvrs , covering 80.59 mb of pig genome sequence and 366 ensemble genes ( table s7a and 7b in file s1 ) .
these genes mainly participate in cell adhesion , regulation of cell cycle , detection of stimulus , phosphate metabolic process , atp biosynthetic process , muscle cell differentiation , purine nucleotide metabolic process , and regulation of growth .
many cnv - associate genes in these regions appear to be certain gene clusters or families , such as ubiquitin - conjugating enzyme family ( ube2b , ube2g2 ) , atpase family ( atp2a1 , atp13a5 , atp5j ) , trefoil factor family ( tff1.tff2 , tff3 ) , and claudin family ( cldn8 , cldn17 ) .
these genes mainly involved in immune system and some human diseases [ 46 ] - [ 53 ] .
vcan ( versican ) , adam17 ( adam metallopeptidase domain 17 ) , itgb1bp1 ( integrin beta 1 binding protein 1 ) , cdh19 , itgad and pcdh15 were also playing important role in inflammation and other diseases [ 54 ] - [ 59 ] .
moreover , cdh19 was evidenced as a copy number alterations ( cnas ) target gene to impact central nervous system .
zwint ( zw10 interacting protein pik3c3 ) , pik3c3 ( phosphoinositide - 3 - kinase class 3 ) and ptgs2 ( prostaglandin - endoperoxide synthase 2 ) were important for cell proliferation [ 60 ] - [ 62 ] , and pik3c3 and ptgs2 were proved as candidate marker for production and reproductive traits in pigs [ 63 ] - [ 65 ] .
these findings indicated that cnvs may have potential effect on immune response , production and reproductive traits of these pigs .
bama pigs and wuzhishan pigs are two famous chinese minipig breeds , whose body weight are less than one third of modern commercial breeds .
21 cnvrs that only detected in these two breeds were picked out to investigate whether cnvs were contribute to their phenotypes .
49 ensemble genes were retrieved overlapped with these cnvrs , including 42 protein - coding genes , 4 snornas , 2 snrnas and 1 pseudogene ( table s7c and 7d in file s1 ) .
among these genes , stx17 was evidenced that a 4.6 - kb intronic duplication of it would cause hair greying and melanoma in horse [ 12 ] ; inpp5a ( inositol polyphosphate - 5 - phosphatase ) , tcerg1l ( transcription elongation regulator 1 - like ) , foxl1 ( forkhead box l1 ) and polr1d ( polymerase ( rna ) i polypeptide d ) mainly participated in human cancer and some other diseases [ 66 ] - [ 69 ] .
some genes such as mtch2 ( mitochondrial carrier 2 ) , bnip3 ( bcl2 / adenovirus e1b 19 kda interacting protein 3 ) and dpysl4 ( dihydropyrimidinase - like 4 ) were playing essential role in cell apoptosis [ 70 ] - [ 72 ] , some as cdk13 ( cyclin - dependent kinase 13 ) and sgsm1 ( small g protein signaling modulator 1 ) participated in regulation of cell circle , differentiation and proliferation [ 73 ] , [ 74 ] .
according to the function of cnv - associated genes in the six breeds , we assumed that cnvs may contribute to disease resistance and stress resistance of all these breeds , but unfortunately , we did n't find sound evidence for cnvs impacting the growth of these two minipig breeds .
an average of 6.04 cnvs was obtained for each sample in the four chinese normal size breeds , while only 3.6 was in the two minipig populations ( table 2 ) .
this means more variations occurred in four nomal size breeds than minipigs .
despite the population size of these breeds , the most convincing reason for such small number of cnvs in minipigs is domestic methods and artificial selection .
these two breeds were both raised in mountain area , which means highly inbreeding was inevitable because of terrible traffic condition , leading to less variation in these breeds .
after long period of natural and artificial selection , these two breeds became more and more conservative and steady .
differences of cnvrs in chinese indigenous breeds and western breeds a total of 213 cnvrs were identified to exist only in the six chinese native breed populations , 60 , in three western breeds and 49 , in all .
fewer cnvrs were detected in western breeds , with only one cnvr detected on chromosomes 4 , 5 , 12 and 18 ( figure 1 , table s8a in file s1 ) .
two potential reasons may explain such a small number of cnvrs .
firstly , the population size of the western breeds of pigs in this study is smaller than that of chinese native breeds .
secondly , strongly artificial selection of the western commercial breeds tended to make them purified , thus decreasing variations in the population .
however , chinese native pigs were subjected to lower selection intensities and had fewer selection signatures , which may conserve most variations after evolution .
a total of 109 ensemble genes overlapped with cnvrs of western breeds , including 99 protein - coding genes , 2 pseudogenes , 1 mirna , 5 snrna and 2 snorna .
go analysis revealed that these genes were mainly involved in cell adhesion , regulation of phosphorylation and cell proliferation .
differ from western breeds , 499 ensemble genes were retrieved overlapping cnvrs of chinese indigenous breeds , including 389 protein - coding genes , 6 pseudogenes , 26 mirna , 35 snrna , 28 snorna , 8 miscrna , 5 rrna , and 2 processed - transcripts. by go analysis , we found that these genes were involved in not only cell adhesion and regulation of phosphorylation , but also behavior , neuron differentiation and regulation of t cell receptor signaling pathway ( table s8b in file s1 ) .
for further pathway analysis , we found chinese breeds specific cnv - associated genes such as itgb2 , cldn8 / 14 / 17 , cdk13 , jam2 , alcam and vcan played important role in immune system , leukocyte transendothelial migration , t cell receptor signaling pathway and other pathways .
some of the important genes were mentioned in proceeding part .
these results illustrated that cnvs may play important role in immune system among chinese breeds and growth among western breeds .
as we all know that chinese indigenous breeds and western breeds show obvious differences in many aspects , our results may provide a genetic explanation for the difference in disease resistance and growth rate .
comparison with previous reports our results were compared with previous reports on porcine genomic cnvs ( table s9 in file s1 ) .
the first research on cnvs of pig genome by using porcine snp60 beadchip was reported by ramayo - caldas [ 29 ] , who detected 49 cnvrs from 55 pigs of iberian x landrace cross .
thirty out of the 49 cnvrs were overlapped with our results .
wang et al. detected 382 cnvrs based on the porcine snp 60 genotyping data of 474 individuals from three pure breed populations and one duroc x erhualian crossbred population [ 34 ] .
among the 382 cnvrs , 97 regions were found to overlap with our results .
using the same method , chen et al. detected 565 cnvrs in 1693 pigs from 18 diverse populations , and 179 of them were overlapped with our results .
using 720 k array cgh , li et al. identified 259 cnvrs in 12 animals including three chinese native pigs , 5 european pigs , 2 synthetic pigs and 2 crossbred pigs ( landrace x div pigs ) [ 37 ] , and only 15 regions were found to be identical or overlapped with our data .
only 3 regions were found in all reports , containing 9 genes , with 7 of them being protein coding genes ( table s9e in file s1 ) .
the potential reasons for the differences between our results and other studies are as follows .
first , there was a difference in population size and genetic background between our study and others .
in our study , the cnvs of the four chinese indigenous breeds including luchuan , laiwu , ningxiang and wuzhishan pigs were reported for the first time , involving lots of new breed - specific regions .
second , platforms ( snp genotyping array and cgh array ) and calling algorithms , which are different in the calling technique , resolution and genome coverage , might contribute to the discrepancy of the cnvs detected .
third , our results were based on genome assembly sus scrofa 10.2 , and except for chen 's research , the aforementioned reports were all based on genome assembly sus scrofa 9.0 version .
as our data needed to be converted from 10.2 to 9.0 , great differences might arise during the transformation , causing the deviation between our results and others .
this is also occurred in cnv studies of other mammals [ 17 ] , [ 75 ] , [ 76 ] .
validation of cnvr by real - time quantitative pcr ( qpcr ) quantitative real time pcr ( qpcr ) was used to validate 12 cnvrs chosen from the 348 cnvrs detected in the study .
these 12 cnvrs represent different predicted status of copy numbers ( i.e. , loss , gain and both ) and different cnvr frequencies .
9 ( 75 %) of them were in agreement with the prediction by penncnv ( figure 2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0106780.g002 figure 2 qpcr validation of 8 identified cnvrs .
the x - axis represents the animals and the y - axis shows the relative quantification value .
except for cnvr187 , 11 cnvrs contained important functional genes .
the cnvr164 contained mast / stem cell growth factor receptor gene , also known as kit gene .
kit gene was considered to affect colors and their distribution in pigs with a 450 kb long duplication and the exon - 17 - skipping mutation .
the copy number of kit in dominant white color was higher than any other patterns [ 77 ] , [ 78 ] .
in our data , the copy numbers of three detected yorkshire pigs were from 4 to 6 , while the other detected samples including tongcheng ( two - black - end ) and duroc pigs ( red ) had approximately 2 copies .
this result is consistent with the previous reports and prediction of penncnv analysis based on snps chip .
the cnvr182 locus contained mapk10 gene , which is a member of mitogenactivated protein kinase ( mapk ) superfamily , and plays an important role in cancer and some other diseases [ 79 ] .
the mapk10 is also associated with hirschsprung disease as a candidate cnv gene [ 80 ] .
in our data , the copy numbers of 11 samples out of 26 were identified as loss events , corresponding with penncnv prediction .
there has been no report so far about the function of mapk10 in pigs , and our results indicate that mapk10 may play an important role in pigs .
another 7 genes were detected in our validated cnvrs , such as vcan , cib4 , vcpip1 , alg14 , fam5c , zfpm2 and dok5 .
copy number variations were identified in all these seven genes , and these variations may affect their function in immunity , development , and growth .
conclusions in this study , we described a map of porcine cnvrs between six chinese indigenous breeds and three western breeds based on porcine snp60 genotyping data of 302 pigs .
the results revealed that 213 cnvrs belong to the chinese native breed populations , and 60 cnvrs , to the western breeds .
we also discussed the cnv characters of four chinese normal size breeds ( luchuan , tongcheng and laiwu pigs ) and two minipig breeds ( bama and wuzhishan pigs ) .
functional annotation suggested that these cnvrs and cnv - associate genes are involved in variety of molecular function and may play important roles in phenotypic and production traits difference between chinese and western pig breeds .

the results warranted further investigation of this treatment .
here we compare dosimetrically three possible treatment delivery platforms for star .
methods the anatomy and target volume of the first treated patient were used for this study .
a dose of 25 gy in one fraction was prescribed to the planning target volume ( ptv ) .
treatment plans were created on three treatment platforms : cyberknife ( r ) g4 system with iris collimator ( multiplan , v .
4.6 )( plan # 1 ) , cyberknife ( r ) m6 system with incise 2tm multileaf collimator ( multiplan v .
5.3 )( plan # 2 ) and varian truebeamtm stx with hd 120tm mlc and 10mv flattening filter free ( fff ) beam ( eclipse planning system , v.11 ) ( plan # 3 coplanar and # 4 noncoplanar vmat plans ) .
the four plans were compared by prescription isodose line , plan conformity index , dose gradient , as well as dose to the nearby critical structures .
to assess the delivery efficiency , planned monitor units ( mu ) and estimated treatment time were evaluated .
results plans # 1 - 4 delivered 25 gy to the ptv to the 75.0 % , 83.0 % , 84.3 % , and 84.9 % isodose lines and with conformity indices of 1.19 , 1.16 , 1.05 , and 1.05 , respectively .
the dose gradients for plans # 1 - 4 were 3.62 , 3.42 , 3.93 , and 3.73 with the cyberknife ( r ) mlc plan ( plan # 2 ) the best , and the truebeamtm stx co - planar plan ( plan # 3 ) the worst .
the dose to nearby critical structures ( lung , stomach , bowel , and esophagus ) were all well within tolerance .
the mus for plans # 1 - 4 were 27671 , 16522 , 6275 , and 6004 for an estimated total - treatment - time / beam - delivery - time of 99 / 69 , 65 / 35 , 37 / 7 , and 56 / 6 minutes , respectively , under the assumption of 30 minutes pretreatment setup time .
for vmat gated delivery , a 40 % duty cycle , 2400mu / minute dose rate , and an extra 10 minutes per extra arc were assumed .
conclusion clinically acceptable plans were created with all three platforms .
plans with mlc were considerably more efficient in mu. cyberknife ( r ) m6 with incise 2tm collimator provided the most conformal plan ( steepest dose drop - off ) with significantly reduced mu and treatment time .
vmat plans were most efficient in mu and delivery time .
fluoroscopic image guidance removes the need for additional fiducial marker placement ; however , benefits may be moderated by worse dose gradient and more operator - dependent motion management by gated delivery .

introduction ventricular arrhythmias ( va ) are common complications of structural heart disease that cause significant morbidity and mortality [ 1 ] .
the most common form of va is monomorphic ventricular tachycardia ( vt ) .
current available options for limiting the incidence of vt and va include implantable cardioverter - defibrillators ( icds ) [ 2 - 4 ] , antiarrhythmic medications [ 5 - 6 ] , and catheter ablation [ 7 ] .
although effective , each intervention may entail significant side effects / complications .
stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( sabr ) is highly focused radiation therapy that targets well - demarcated , limited - volume malignant or benign tumors with high accuracy and precision using image guidance [ 8 - 11 ] .
stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation ( star ) that applies sabr to treating arrhythmias was recently investigated .
pre - clinical studies have demonstrated electrophysiologic conduction blockade and histologic fibrosis after sabr to the targeted cardiac conduction pathway , which provided proof of principle for its potential for treating arrhythmias [ 12 - 13 ] .
the first star of vt was treated at stanford on a robotic radiosurgery system ( cyberknife ( r ) , accuray , sunnyvale , ca ) in 2012 [ 14 ] .
the follow - up showed no definite acute or late complications , and a seven - month reduction in vt on a stable antiarrhythmic regimen suggested a possible transient benefit of star ; however , further investigation is needed .
the first star patient was treated on a cyberknife ( r ) g4 system - - a robotic radiosurgery system with an x - band linear accelerator mounted on a robotic arm .
the radiation was delivered with a dynamic respiratory tracking system ( synchrony ( r ) respiratory tracking , accuray , sunnyvale , ca ) to compensate for heart movement from respiratory motion .
the treatment plan was created and optimized using multiplan v.4.6 with iris variable aperture collimator .
the plan contained 175 non - isocentric beams with estimated delivery time of 69 minutes excluding setup time .
a temporary pacing wire ( oscor , inc. , miami lakes , fl ) was fluoroscopically placed in the rv apex as an imaging fiducial marker for tracking .
the magnitude of the remaining cardiac motion was determined by fluoroscopy of the fiducial marker during transient breath holds , and the final target volume was expanded to encompass this residual motion .
recent technological advances may enable faster and more conformal star treatment .
the recently released cyberknife ( r ) m6 ( tm ) system is now equipped with multi - leaf collimator ( incise 2 ( tm )) [ 15 - 16 ] , which is reported to be more efficient in treating larger targets with fewer monitor units and less treatment time [ 17 - 19 ] .
linac - based sabr with gated vmat delivery and a very high dose rate ( flattening filter free ) has also been implemented in the past several years .
in this work , we perform a star treatment plan comparison study between three available treatment platforms .
materials and methods system description three available sabr platforms were compared in this study as shown in figure 1 .
the first was the cyberknife ( r ) g4tm system with an iris variable aperture collimator which was used for our first star treatment .
this system uses a 6 mv flattening filter free ( fff ) photon beam with a dose rate of 1000 cgy / minute at 80 cm sad .
the iris variable aperture is composed of two hexagonal leaf banks stacking on top of one another with 15 - degree rotation .
it can form twelve quasi - circular collimator sizes to mimic the conventional fixed cones .
the application of iris collimator is reported to reduce treatment time significantly compared to the conventional cones while creating comparable or better plans [ 20 ] .
the second system was a cyberknife ( r ) m6tm system with an incise 2tm mlc [ 15 ] .
the m6tm system has a redesigned robot and a new geometric room layout. with the robot aligned with the couch , the new design opens more delivery space laterally and provides a more symmetrical delivery node distribution .
more importantly , the m6tm system is equipped with an optional incisetm mlc .
the incise 2tm ( second version of incise mlc ) has two leaf banks with 26 mlc leaves in each leaf bank .
each leaf has a width of 3.85mm at source - to - axis distance ( sad ) of 80 cm with a maximum field size of 11.5 cm by 10.0 cm. the addition of mlc to cyberknife ( r ) enables the system to produce plans with reduced mus and reduced treatment time .
the m6 system linear accelerator has similar beam characteristics as the g4 system .
both m6 and g4 systems use the synchrony ( r ) model - based real - time tracking for respiratory motion .
the third system was the varian truebeamtm stx with hd 120tm mlc consisting of 2.5 mm leaf width ( at 100 cm sad ) at the central 8 cm , and 5 mm width leaves in the periphery .
this system has 6 mv and 10 mv fff beams with dose rates of 1400 cgy / minute and 2400 cgy / minute , respectively .
the 10 mv photon has higher dose rate and better penetration which is more appropriate for a deeply seated target which justifies the use of 10 mv photons in this study .
the respiratory motion is typically compensated with gating technology with the aid of kv on - board imaging , cone - beam ct , and fluoroscopic imaging .

target delineation the anatomy of the first treated patient was used for this study .
this was a 71 - year - old man who developed sustained vt refractory to other treatment options .
as he was not a candidate for catheter ablation , he consented to star treatment protocol as the first patient treatment in 2012 under irb approval and fda expanded use ( i.e. , compassionate use ) exemption .
in order to determine the ablation volume , a study including ecg during vt , cardiac - gated ct , and cardiac pet - ct were performed before the treatment .
the circumferential vt substrate was contoured by the electrophysiologist using cardioplan software ( cyberheart , portola valley , ca ) [ 14 ] .
the target and the images in cardioplan were then exported to the cyberknife ( r ) treatment planning system ( multiplan 4.6 , accuray , sunnyvale , ca ) , and fused with the treatment planning ct. the final target volume was refined by the radiation oncologists in collaboration with electrophysiology and nuclear medicine .
nearby normal organs including the lung , bowel , esophagus , and stomach were also delineated .
the heart movement was measured to be about 1 cm with fluoroscopic imaging on the inserted icd and tracking lead during the simulation .
an internal target volume ( itv ) was created to include a 5 mm margin to compensate for heart movement , and the planning target volume ( ptv ) was a modification of the itv by the radiation oncologist considering geometry delivery feasibility ( including the concave region to ptv for easier dosimetric delivery ) .
in this study , the simulation ct scan of this patient and the original target and critical structure volumes were transferred to multiplan v.5.3 and eclipse v.11 for replanning .
treatment planning a dose of 25 gy in one fraction was prescribed to the ptv .
four treatment plans were created .
plan # 1 was the original plan used for patient treatment that was created on the cyberknife ( r ) g4 system with iris collimator ( multiplan , v.4.6.0 ) .
plan # 2 was created with cyberknife ( r ) m6 system with incise 2tm multi - leaf collimator ( multiplan v.5.3 ) .
plans # 3 and # 4 were created on varian truebeamtm stx with hd 120tm mlc and 10 mv fff beam ( eclipse planning system , v.11 ) .
plan # 3 was a vmat plan with one full arc in the axial plane .
plan # 4 was a vmat plan with one axial full arc and two anterior partial arcs ( 120 degrees anterior ) with a 10 - degree couch kick on each side to introduce superior and inferior noncoplanar angles .
all four plans were optimized to be conformal to the ptv and meet dose constraints on the nearby critical structures following published dose constraints ( aapm task group 101 ) .
plans were optimized to have a prescription isodose line between 75 % to 85 % ( corresponding to dose heterogeneity of 133 % and 118 %) .
a beam - or segment - reduction technique was applied to both cyberknife plans after the optimization .
the system settings for the four plans are shown in table 1 .
the plans were compared with respect to prescription isodose lines , plan conformity index , dose gradient , as well as dose to the nearby critical structures .
the conformity index was defined as the volume of 100 % of the prescription dose to the volume of ptv .
the dose gradient was defined as the ratio of the volume of 50 % of the prescription dose to the volume of the 100 % prescription dose ( i.e. , the 12.5 gy isodose volume over the 25 gy isodose volume ) .
to assess the delivery efficiency , plan monitor unit ( mu ) and estimated treatment time were also compared .
the treatment time with the cyberknife ( r ) was estimated in the planning software plus 30 minutes setup time .
treatment time on truebeam was an estimation based on our experience on gated treatments .
the beam delivery time was calculated with the assumption of a dose rate of 2400 mu / minute at 40 % duty cycle plus 30 minutes setup time ahead of treatment .
the vmat plan is not only modulated with leaf aperture but also on dose rate and gantry speed ; 2400 mu / minute maximum dose rate gives the most aggressive time estimation .
ten minutes extra delivery time was added per extra arc for plan # 4 due to the fact that the patient localization will need to be verified again and the gating window reset .
the 30 minutes setup time and 10 minutes extra verification time were purely assumptions based on our first experience with a heart treatment .
we simply doubled our regular setup time due to the involvement of the heart movement .
this estimate is generous because we are assuming cardiac motion management may be more complex , and that with routine clinical implementation , the time is likely to become less .

the isodose distributions and the beam arrangement were compared ( figure 2 ) , with plan statistics in table 2 .
the four plans ( plans # 1 - # 4 ) delivered 25 gy to ptv with isodose lines of 75.0 % , 83.0 % , 84.3 % , and 84.9 % respectively , with conformity indices of 1.19 , 1.16 , 1.05 , and 1.05 respectively .
plans with mlc have better uniformity in dose distribution in general .
the dose gradients were 3.62 , 3.42 , 3.93 , and 3.73 for plans # 1 - # 4 , respectively .
the cyberknife ( r ) mlc plan ( plan # 2 ) had the best dose gradient , and the vmat 1 arc plan ( plan # 3 ) had the worst .
however , the difference was not significant , and the results were based on one patient only .
the dose to nearby critical structures ( lung , stomach , bowel , and esophagus ) were within tolerance with slight differences due to the system beam arrangement , with their dvhs compared in figure 3 .
the mus of the four plans were 27671 , 16522 , 6275 , and 6004 , respectively ; and the estimated total treatment times / beam delivery times were 99 / 69 , 65 / 35 , 37 / 7 , and 56 / 6 minutes , respectively .
the cyberknife ( r ) plan with incise 2tm collimator had reduced mu ( 40 % reduction ) and beam delivery times ( 49 % reduction ) compared to the respective mu and beam delivery times using an iris plan .
vmat plans were more efficient in mu usage ( 22 % of the cyberknife ( r ) iris plan and 35 % of the cyberknife ( r ) mlc plan ) and delivery time .

discussion clinically acceptable plans can be created with all three platforms .
while plans are all conformal , we found that vmat plans can follow the target shape ( lower conformity index ) better than cyberknife ( r ) plans with significantly fewer mus .
this is due to the fact that vmat plans deploy direct aperture optimization and utilize higher penetrating radiation .
the iris plan is a cone - based plan , which on average has the least efficiency in mu delivery due to the absence of irregular beam shapes. with the incise 2tm mlc , irregular fields are now available which help to increase the delivery efficiency [ 17 - 19 ] ; however , the current optimizer does not directly optimize the beam aperture , which limits the delivery efficiency on plan # 2 .
when mlc is applied , the beam set is pre - generated based on the shape of the target ( perimeter shapes , eroded shapes , and random shapes ) and are treated as fixed aperture during plan optimization in the cyberknife ( r ) multiplan .
in the eclipse planning system , the vmat plan is directly optimized on beam apertures and weights , which produce better conformity and mu efficiency .
in this study , vmat plans using 10 mv photons yield approximately a 15 % reduction in mus as opposed to 6 mv ( the only option for cyberknife ( r ) system ) .
percent depth dose at 10 cm depth is 61 % and 71 % for cyberknife 6 mv beam with a 60 mm cone and truebeam 10mv fff beam in a 10 cm by 10 cm field .
another difference between the cyberknife ( r ) system and the truebeam system is the treatment space .
one of the advantages of the cyberknife ( r ) system is that there is no isocenter .
the compact x - band linear accelerator can move around the patient freely with the six - joint robotic arm .
it can access more oblique angles from superior and inferior directions although lacks posterior beams .
the gantry - based truebeamtm stx system is better in axial isocentric arc delivery .
the introduction of a non - coplanar partial arc in plan # 4 provided some superior and inferior oblique beams , but it significantly complicated the treatment .
due to the beam arrangement differences between the systems , isodose distributions for the cyberknife ( r ) plans are observed to have a dose drop - off more uniformly over all the directions , which yield a better dose gradient , and the truebeam vmat plans have a dose distribution stretch - out in the axial plane .
as a rough quantitative measure of this stretch - out effect , the average diameters ( averaged in lateral and anterior to posterior directions ) of the 12.5 gy line were measured on the central axial plane .
they were 8.9 cm , 8.8 cm , 10.5 cm , and 10.0 cm for plans # 1 - # 4 , respectively .
the three arc plan ( plan # 4 ) had less axial dose stretch - out , but still could not compete with the cyberknife ( r ) plans .
the cyberknife ( r ) mlc plan ( plan # 2 ) had a better dose drop off with fewer mus and delivery time than the cyberknfe iris plan ( plan # 1 ) , which is consistent with other studies [ 17 - 19 ] .
other than the differences discussed above , the major difference between the cyberknife ( r ) and the truebeamtm stx plans is the patient localization and motion tracking during the delivery .
during pre - treatment assessment for this patient , we found the icd tip was not trackable with the cyberknife ( r ) .
therefore , a temporary pacing wire ( oscor , inc. , miami lakes , fl ) was placed in the rv apex as an imaging fiducial marker .
a fixed - helix unipolar lead design was used to minimize imaging artifact and was placed using a sterile percutaneous approach via the right axillary vein into the rv apex under fluoroscopic guidance .
this location was chosen to avoid both tracking interference from the patient 's existing icd lead and to place the fiducial marker as close to the target tissue as possible .
the fiducial marker was removed after star under fluoroscopic guidance .
the synchrony tracking primarily compensates the heart motion caused by the respiratory movement .
tracking accuracy was later analyzed using the system log file and was found to be close to our estimation [ 21 - 22 ] .
the motion management on the truebeamtm stx , on the other hand , does not have strict requirements on markers as does the cyberknife ( r ) system .
the truebeamtm stx system utilizes kv fluoroscopic imaging and cbct for target localization .
in this case , the existing icd lead could have served as the fiducial marker for fluoroscopic image guidance so that the invasive procedure to place the extra lead would not have been needed ; however , benefits may possibly be moderated by a worse intermediate dose conformity index and more operator - dependent motion management by gated delivery [ 23 - 24 ] .
motion management is not as automated as with the cyberknife ( r ) and is , therefore , more operator dependent .
conclusions we compared star treatment plans between three treatment platforms .
all plans were clinically acceptable regarding target coverage and critical structure sparing .
plans with mlc were considerably more efficient in mus and delivery time .
the recently released incise 2tm collimator with the m6 system provided the most conformal plan ( steepest dose drop - off ) with significantly reduced mus and treatment time .
vmat plans were most efficient in mus and delivery time .
fluoroscopic image guidance removes the need for additional fiducial marker placement ; however , benefits may possibly be moderated by a worse intermediate dose conformity index and more operator - dependent motion management by gated delivery .
the authors have declared that no competing interests exist .

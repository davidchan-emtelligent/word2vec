background accurate calling of snps and genotypes from next - generation sequencing data is an essential prerequisite for most human genetics studies .
a number of computational steps are required or recommended when translating the raw sequencing data into the final calls .
however , whether each step does contribute to the performance of variant calling and how it affects the accuracy still remain unclear , making it difficult to select and arrange appropriate steps to derive high quality variants from different sequencing data .
in this study , we made a systematic assessment of the relative contribution of each step to the accuracy of variant calling from illumina dna sequencing data .
results we found that the read preprocessing step did not improve the accuracy of variant calling , contrary to the general expectation .
although trimming off low - quality tails helped align more reads , it introduced lots of false positives .
the ability of markup duplication , local realignment and recalibration , to help eliminate false positive variants depended on the sequencing depth .
rearranging these steps did not affect the results .
the relative performance of three popular multi - sample snp callers , samtools , gatk , and glfmultiples , also varied with the sequencing depth .
conclusions our findings clarify the necessity and effectiveness of computational steps for improving the accuracy of snp and genotype calls from illumina sequencing data and can serve as a general guideline for choosing snp calling strategies for data with different coverage .
22 - 24 april 2012the international conference on intelligent biology and medicine ( icibm ) nashville , tn , usa background next - generation sequencing ( ngs ) technology is a powerful and cost - effective approach for large - scale dna sequencing [ 1 ] .
it has significantly propelled the sequence - based genetics and genomics research and its downstream applications which include , but are not limited to , de novo sequencing [ 2,3 ] , quantifying expression level s [ 4 - 7 ] , providing a genome - scale look at transcription - factor binding [ 8,9 ] , creating a foundation for understanding human disease [ 10 - 12 ] and systematically investigating of human variation [ 13,14 ] .
a number of projects based on ngs technology are underway .
for example , 1000 genomes project http :// www.1000genomes.org / aims to provide a comprehensive resource of human genetic variation as a foundation for understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype [ 14 ] .
the nhlbi go exome sequencing project ( esp ) http :// evs.gs.washington.edu / evs / focuses on protein coding regions to discover novel genes and mechanisms contributing to heart , lung and blood disorders .
tcga ( the cancer genome atlas ) http :// cancergenome.nih.gov / has been sequencing a large number of tumor / normal pairs to provide insights into the landscape of somatic mutations and the great genetic heterogeneity that defines the unique signature of individual tumor [ 15 ] .
the ability to discover a comprehensive list of human genetic variation and to search for causing variation or mutation underlying diseases depends crucially on the accurate calling of snps and genotypes [ 16 ] .
translating the raw sequencing data into the final snp and genotype calls requires two essential steps : read mapping and snp / genotype inference .
first , reads are aligned onto an available reference genome , then variable sites are identified and genotypes at those sites are determined .
snp and genotype calling suffers from high error rates that are due to the following factors .
poor quality or low - quality tails prevent reads from being properly mapped .
each read is aligned independently , causing many reads that span indels are misaligned [ 17 ] .
the raw base - calling quality scores often co - vary with features like sequence technology , machine cycle and sequence context and , thus , cannot reflect the true base - calling error rates [ 17 ] .
these alignment and base - calling errors propagate into snp and genotype inference and lead to false variant detection .
moreover , low - coverage sequencing always introduces considerable uncertainty into the results and makes accurate snp and genotype calling difficult .
to obtain high quality snp and genotype data , most contemporary algorithms use a probabilistic framework to quantify the uncertainty and to model errors introduced in alignment and base calling [ 17 - 20 ] .
in addition , a number of optional steps are recommended .
some are prior to variant calling , including raw reads preprocessing , duplicate marking , local realignment , and base quality score recalibration [ 17 ] .
others are posterior to variant calling , including linkage - based genotype refining [ 21 - 23 ] and snp filtering [ 24 ] or variant quality score recalibration [ 17 ] .
here we focused on those optional steps preceding variant calling .
we assessed their relative contributions and evaluated the effect of their orders on the accuracy of snp and genotype calling with data generated on illumina sequencing platform , which is currently the most widely used sequencing technology .
besides , we also compared the performance of three popular multi - sample snp callers , samtools [ 20 ] , gatk [ 17 ] , and glfmultiples [ 14 ] , in terms of dbsnp rate , transition to transversion ratio ( ti / tv ratio ) , and concordance rate with snp arrays ( methods section ) .
our findings can serve as a general guide for choosing appropriate steps for snp and genotype calling from illumina sequencing data with different coverage .
methods sequencing data and snp calling five samples were selected for whole exome sequencing .
all samples were taken from women with very early - onset ( 22 - 32 years old ) breast cancer or early - onset ( 38 - 41 years old ) plus a first - degree family history of breast cancer [ 25 ] .
genomic dna from buffy coat was extracted using qiamp dna kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca ) following the manufacture 's protocol .
exonic regions were captured using illumina truseq exome enrichment kit .
it targeted 201,071 regions ( 62.1 million bases ; 49.3 % inside exons ; average length 309 bp ) , covering 96.5 % of consensus coding sequence database ( ccds ) .
an illumina hiseq 2000 was used to generate 100 - bp paired - end reads ( five samples per lane ) .
reads were mapped to the ncbi build 37 reference genome with bwa [ 26 ] , sorted and indexed with samtools [ 20 ] .
those reads were classified into three categories by their mapped locations on the genome , inside target regions , outside target regions with <= 200 bp distance and outside target regions > 200 bp distance .
for these five samples , there was an average of 43.4 % bases ( 42.7 - 43.7 %) mapped to target regions , 21.4 % ( 21.3 - 21.7 %) mapped to outside <= 200 bp regions , and 35.2 % ( 34.6 - 36.2 %) mapped to outside > 200 bp regions ( table 1 ) .
as expected , the depth of coverage was the highest for inside target regions (~ 60x coverage per sample on average ) and lowest for outside > 200 bp regions (~ 4x coverage per sample on average ) ( table 1 ) .
98.8 % target regions , 92.1 % of outside <= 200 bp regions and 58.3 % of outside > 200 bp regions are accessed by sequencing data ( table 1 ) .
table 1 summary of bases distribution for five samples whole - exome sequencing data coverage sample total mapped bases ( gb ) (%) mean mappeddepth ( x ) bases accessed ( gb )(% of genome regions ) high ( inside target ) 1 3.71 ( 43.7 %) 60.53 0.61 ( 98.8 %) 2 3.75 ( 43.7 %) 61.11 3 3.88 ( 43.5 %) 63.27 4 3.90 ( 42.7 %) 63.57 5 3.85 ( 43.4 %) 62.71 medium ( outside <= 200 bp ) 1 1.84 ( 21.7 %) 30.05 0.74 ( 92.1 %) 2 1.85 ( 21.5 %) 30.15 3 1.91 ( 21.4 %) 31.14 4 1.93 ( 21.1 %) 31.40 5 1.89 ( 21.3 %) 30.82 low ( outside > 200 bp ) 1 2.94 ( 34.6 %) 3.99 1.66 ( 58.3 %) 2 2.99 ( 34.8 %) 4.03 3 3.12 ( 35.1 %) 4.18 4 3.30 ( 36.2 %) 4.31 5 3.13 ( 35.3 %) 4.16 poor - quality tails of reads were dynamically trimmed off by the bwa parameter ( - q 15 ) .
duplicated reads were marked by picard .
base quality recalibration and local realignment were carried out using genome analysis toolkit ( gatk ) [ 17,27 ] .
snps were called simultaneously on five samples by gatk unified genotyper , samtools mpileup and glfmultiples using bases with base quality >= 20 and reads with mapping quality >= 20 .
definition of performance metrics dbsnp rate the percentage of variants found in dbsnp database [ 28 ]( dbsnp rate ) is used to measure an approximate false - positive rate of snp calling .
here dbsnp 129 was used , which contains approximately 11 million snp entries [ 29 - 31 ] .
it excludes the impact of the 1000 genomes project and is useful for evaluation .
multi - sample snp calling is able to find more rare variants than single sample calling , thus the aggregate dbsnp rate is lower. of ~ 640 k variants discovered from these five samples , about 77 % were already catalogued in dbsnp 129 ( table 2 ) .
it should be noted that dbsnp rate is not an absolute measurement of which variant calls are better , but the same number of variants with higher dbsnp rate may reasonably suggest lower false - positive rates .
table 2 effects of data preprocessing on snp calling accuracy call set ( qual > = 50 ) site discovery no. snps ti / tv ratio all known novel dbsnp % known novel raw 640946 499377 141569 77.91 % 2.19 1.65 filtery 630641 490722 139919 77.81 % 2.19 1.65 trim 651391 502951 148440 77.21 % 2.18 1.58 filtery & trim 640487 493741 146746 77.08 % 2.18 1.58 raw : without any preprocessing steps ; filtery : removing those reads that fail the illumina chastity filter ; trim : trimming off low - quality tails from reads with the bwa parameter ( - q 15 ) ; filtery & trim : removing those reads that fail the illumina chastity filter and trimming off low quality tails .
snps were called for five samples together by gatk using bases with base quality >= 20 and reads with mapping quality >= 20 .
only sites with qual > = 50 were considered as potentially variable sites .
transition / transversion ratio the variants are observed either as transitions ( between purines , or between pyrimidines ) or transversions ( between purines and pyrimidines ) .
the ratio of the number of transitions to the number of transversions is particularly helpful for assessing the quality of snp calls [ 17 ] .
ti / tv ratios are often calculated for known and novel snps separately .
the expected ti / tv ratios in whole - genome sequencing are 2.10 and 2.07 for known and novel variants , respectively , and in the exome target regions are 3.5 and 3.0 , respectively [ 17 ] .
the higher ti / tv ratio generally indicates higher accuracy .
when detected variants demonstrate a ratio closer to the expected ratio for random substitutions ( e.g. ~ 0.5 ) , low - quality variant calling or data is implied .
genotype concordance all five samples have been genotyped using the affymetrix snp 6.0 array in a previous genome - wide association study [ 25 ] .
detailed genotyping methods and stringent quality control criteria were described in zheng et al. , [ 25 ] .
the original scan included three quality control samples in each 96 - well plate , and the snp calls showed a very high concordance rate ( mean 99.9 % ; median 100 %) for the quality control samples .
genotypes obtained from the sequencing data were compared with those from the snp array .
the non - reference discrepancy ( nrd ) rate was used to measure the accuracy of genotype calls , which reported the percent of discordant genotype calls at commonly called on - reference sites on the snp array and exome - sequencing .
the mathematical definition of nrd can be found in depristo et al. , [ 17 ] .
the lower nrd generally indicates higher accuracy of genotype calls .
results effects of data preprocessing using high - quality reads is expected to identify true variants .
generally , there are two ways to extract high - quality reads from illumina sequencing data : removing reads that fail the illumina chastity filter ( filtery ) and trimming off low - quality ends from reads ( trim ) .
the trim step obtained the largest number of mapped reads , while the filtery produced the fewest number of mapped reads resulting from lots of low - quality reads being discarded ( figure 1a ) .
although the trim step helped align more reads and identify slightly more variants ( 1.6 % , ~ 651 k vs. ~ 641 k ) , it obtained a lower dbsnp rate ( 77.21 %) and a lower novel transition / transversion ratio ( ti / tv ratio ) ( 1.58 ) compared with those using raw sequencing data ( dbsnp : 77.91 % , novel ti / tv ratio : 1.65 ) ( table 2 ) .
trimming low - quality tails added 11,748 novel variants , representing about 8 % of all novel calls , with a ti / tv ratio of 0.98 , while it eliminated 4,877 novel variants with a ti / tv ratio of 1.49 from the raw call set ( figure 1b ) .
the novel variants unique to the trim call set had a much lower ti / tv ratio ( 0.98 ) compared with the ti / tv ratio ( 1.49 ) of those unique to the raw call set , which suggested that more false positive variants were introduced by the trim step .
results from applying both filtery and trim steps ( filtery & trim ) compared with those from performing filtery step alone also revealed that trim step would increase the number of false positives ( table 2 and figure 1c ) .

number of unique known snps , the ti / tv ratio and number of common known snps were listed ( e ) .
the filtery step identified fewer variants (~ 630 k ) ; however , those variants showed the similar dbsnp rate (~ 77.8 %) and ti / tv ratio ( 2.19 and 1.65 , respectively ) compared with the raw call set .
removing poor - quality reads from raw data ( filtery ) added 887 known variants with a ti / tv ratio of 1.72 , while it eliminated 9542 known variants with a ti / tv ratio of 2.16 from the raw call set ( figure 1d ). that is , filtery step dropped more than 8,000 known variants , representing about 2 % of all known calls .
these results suggested that throwing out those poor quality reads which failed the chastity filter might not be necessary for further snp calling .
comparison results from applying both filtery and trim steps ( filtery & trim ) with those from performing trim step alone also revealed the useless of filtery step on improving snp calling performance ( table 2 and figure 1e ) .
a comprehensive comparison using variable quality thresholds for high - coverage data ( inside target regions , ~ 60x coverage per sample on average , table 1 ) , medium - coverage data ( outside regions with <= 200 bp distance , ~ 30x coverage per sample on average , table 1 ) and low - coverage data ( outside regions with > 200 bp distance , ~ 4x coverage per sample on average , table 1 ) came to the same conclusion , that these two preprocessing step , filtery and trim , could not improve the performance of snp calling , a conclusion contrary to the usual expectation .
application of the trim step might even introduce false positives , especially for high - coverage data .
compared with low coverage data , the problem of introducing false positives caused by the trim step is more serious for high coverage data ( additional file 1 ) .
effects of duplicate marking , realignment and recalibration among the three optional steps , local realignment , marking duplication and base quality recalibration , local realignment obtained the highest dbsnp rate ( 75.45 %) and novel ti / tv ratio ( 1.84 ) for high - coverage data ( inside target regions , ~ 60x coverage per sample on average ) ( table 3 ) .
local realignment eliminated 1759 novel variants from the initial call set , representing more than 7 % of all novel calls , with a ti / tv ratio of 0.77 , which indicated that about 90 % of these novel calls were false - positives ( figure 2a ) .
in contrast , base quality recalibration eliminated only 446 novel variants with a ti / tv ratio of 0.56 but added 306 novel variants with a ti / tv ratio of 0.86 from the initial call set ( figure 2b ) .
marking duplication removed 244 novel variants with a ti / tv ratio of 0.97 but it added 107 novel variants with a ti / tv ratio of 0.78 from the initial call set ( figure 2c ) .
these results suggested that local realignment was efficient in reducing the false - positive rate , while the effect of recalibration and marking duplications was limited for deep - sequencing data .

only sites with qual > 50 for deep - coverage or qual > 20 for shallow coverage were considered as potentially variable sites .
figure 2 effects of realignment , recalibration and marking duplication on snp calling from high and low coverage data .
venn diagrams comparing identified novel variants between two call sets using different steps .
number of novel snps , the ti / tv ratio and number of common novel snps were listed in the comparisons between the initial call set and the call set with realignment step for high ( a ) and low ( d ) coverage data , between the initial call set and the call set with recalibration step for high ( b ) and low ( e ) coverage data , between the initial call set and the call set with marking duplication step for high ( c ) and low ( f ) coverage data .
for low - coverage sequencing ( outside regions with > 200 bp distance , ~ 4x coverage per sample on average ) , however , the ability of these three steps to eliminate false - positive variants changed .
marking duplication obtained the highest performance with 79.09 % dbsnp rate and a novel ti / tv ratio of 1.53 ( table 3 ) .
marking duplication removed 19472 novel variants from the initial call set , representing more than 10 % of all novel calls , with a ti / tv ratio of 0.67 ( figure 2f ) .
in contrast , local realignment only eliminated 4139 novel variants with a ti / tv ratio of 0.77 ( figure 2d ) and recalibration only removed 3526 novel variants with a ti / tv ratio of 0.93 ( figure 2e ) .
these results suggested that marking duplication was more efficient in reducing false - positive rates than other two optional steps for low - coverage sequencing data .
a comprehensive comparison using variable quality thresholds also suggested that realignment was more efficient in removing false positives than base call recalibration and marking duplication for high - coverage data , whereas marking duplication was more efficient than the other two for low - coverage data ( additional file 2 ) .
the effect of orders of the optional steps on snp calling was also evaluated .
we obtained the same accuracy of snp and genotype calling using different order arrangements , suggesting that the order of steps had no effect on the calling performance ( additional file 3 ) .
comparing the performance of gatk , samtools and glfmultiples samtools and gatk obtained higher known and novel ti / tv ratios than glfmultiples for deep - sequencing data ( inside target regions ) , while they produced a lower dbsnp rate and known and novel ti / tv ratios than glfmultiples for low - sequencing data ( outside regions > 200 bp ) when the same number of snps were identified ( figure 3 ) .
for those data with medium - coverage , these three multi - sample calling tools produced similar dbsnp rate , known and novel ti / tv ratios ( outside regions <= 200 bp ) .
all of these three tools produced a similar genotype concordance with snp chip data for all regions ( figure 3 ) .
these results suggested that samtools and gatk had better performance than glfmultiples for high - coverage data , while glfmultiples were superior to samtools and gatk for low - coverage data .
figure 3 comparison of the calling performance of samtools , gatk and glfmultiples in terms of dbsnp rate , ti / tv ratio , novel ti / tv ratio and nrd ( non - reference discrepancy ) from all regions , inside target regions , outside target regions with <= 200 bp distance and outside target regions > 200 bp distances from illumina whole - exome sequencing data .
discussion intriguingly , we found that the read preprocessing steps before mapping were not necessary .
trimming off low - quality tails from reads even worsen the power of variant calling , although it helps align more reads with high error rate in the tail .
a possible explanation is that although the quality of tails is not good enough , they are still helpful for reads mapping .
thus trimming off low - quality tails would lead to more alignment artifacts than using raw reads and , in turn , cause false - positive variants discovery .
it should be noted that trimming reads is somehow a question of trial and error and a balance between the number of mapped reads and mapping accuracy .
if the decrease of the quality of the 3 ' end is acceptable and the loss of coverage is affordable , trimming is not necessary .
in contrast , if there is a dramatic quality decrease at the tail and poor quality was observed at very earlier sequencing cycle , trimming might be helpful by increasing the number of mapped reads greatly but without reducing the mapping accuracy much .
for the steps after read mapping , including marking duplication , realignment and recalibration , the relative contribution of each step to the accuracy of variant calling depends on the sequencing depth .
when the sequencing depth is high , read mapping can benefit from finding consistent alignment among all reads and thus reduce the number of false - positives effectively .
when the sequencing depth is low , however , the lack of sufficient reads mapping to the locus limits the power of local multiple sequence alignment and thus it cannot improve the quality of variant calls much .
in such circumstances , marking duplication plays a more important role in reducing false positives than realignment and recalibration .
moreover , the performances of three popular multi - sample calling tools , samtools , gatk and glfmultiples , also depend on the sequencing depth .
they use the same genotype likelihood model , but glfmultiples not only takes into account the maximized likelihood but also an overall prior for each type of polymorphism .
for example , they favor sites with transition polymorphisms over those with transversion [ 14 ] .
thus , incorporating such additional information helps reduce the uncertainty associated with shallow - sequencing data .
however , the additional information will disturb the identification of variants when enough evidence is already involved with deep - sequencing data .
the steps posterior to variant calling , including linkage - based genotype refining and snp filtering or variant quality score recalibration , also contribute a lot to the accurate snp and genotype calling .
the use of ld ( linkage - disequilibrium ) patterns can substantially improve genotype calling when multiple samples have been sequenced [ 16 ] .
because not all information regarding errors can be fully incorporated into the statistical framework , the proper snp filtering strategies are recommended to reduce the error rates [ 24 ] .
besides , the consensus of multiple call sets from different methods provide higher quality than any of individual call sets [ 14 ] .
even with the best pipelines , however , we are still far from obtaining a complete and accurate picture of snps and genotypes in the human genome .
the most challenging task is to distinguish rare variants from sequencing errors .
snp and genotype calling for rare variants , which would not be represented in any reference panel , may not improve much by the use of ld information .
to identify rare variants , a direct and more powerful approach is to sequence a large number of individuals [ 23,32 ] .
in addition to using the proper sequencing strategies , developing more accurate snp detection methods is needed .
more research is also needed in other areas , including longer read depths , improved protocols for generate paired ends , advances in sequencing technology with lower base calling error rates , and more powerful alignment methods .
conclusions here , we evaluated the effect of a number of computational steps on the accuracy of snp and genotype calling from illumina sequencing data with different coverage .
to our knowledge , no other study has made a systematic assessment of whether each step is valuable and how it affects the quality of variant detection .
our findings can serves as the general guideline for choosing snp calling strategies .

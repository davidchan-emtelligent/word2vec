ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological malignancy in women , and fifth leading cause of death .
despite advances made in chemotherapy and surgery , the average time of clinical remission is approximately 2 years and the 5 - year survival rate is 45 % .
thus , there is an urgent need for the development of a novel therapeutic approach to ovarian cancer treatment .
we investigated the effect of a specific nutrient mixture ( epq ) containing ascorbic acid , lysine , proline , green tea extract , and quercetin on human ovarian cancer cell a - 2780 in vivo and in vitro .
athymic female nude mice ( n = 12 ) were all inoculated intraperitoneally ( ip ) with 2 x 106 cells in 0.1 ml of phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) and randomly divided into two groups .
upon injection , the control group ( n = 6 ) was fed a regular diet and the epq group ( n = 6 ) a regular diet supplemented with 0.5 % epq .
four weeks later , the mice were sacrificed and tumors that developed in the ovary were excised , weighed , and processed for histology .
lungs were inspected for metastasis .
in vitro , a - 2780 cells were cultured in dulbecco modified eagle medium supplemented with 10 % fbs and antibiotics .
at near confluence , cells were treated with epq in triplicate at concentrations between 0 and 1000 mug / ml. cell proliferation was measured via mtt assay , mmp - 9 secretion via gelatinase zymography , invasion through matrigel and morphology via hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) staining .
all control mice developed large ovarian tumors , whereas 5 out of 6 mice in the epq group developed no tumors , and one , a small tumor .
control mice also showed lung metastasis in 6 out of 6 mice , while no lung metastasis was evident in epq mice .
zymography demonstrated only mmp - 9 expression , which epq inhibited in a dose - dependent fashion , with virtual total block at 250 mug / ml concentration .
epq significantly inhibited invasion through matrigel with total block at 250 mug / ml concentration .
mtt showed dose - dependent inhibition of cell proliferation with epq , and h & e staining showed no morphological changes below 500 mug / ml epq .
these results suggest that epq has therapeutic potential in the treatment of ovarian cancer by significantly suppressing ovarian tumor incidence and growth and lung metastasis , and by inhibiting mmp - 9 secretion and invasion of a - 2780 ovarian cancer cells .
ovarian cancer a - 2780 cell line nutrients tumor growth mmps matrigel invasion metastasis 1 .
introduction ovarian carcinoma , which ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women , occurs mainly in post - menopausal women and accounts for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system [ 1 ] .
the american cancer society estimates that approximately 22,280 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the united states in 2016 and 14,240 women will die from ovarian cancer [ 1 ] .
malignant cancer cells in the ovaries can metastasize directly to other organs in the pelvis and abdomen and through the bloodstream or lymph nodes to other parts of the body [ 2 ] .
since ovarian cancer often remains clinically silent , the majority of patients (~ 60 %) are diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma at an advanced stage of intraperitoneal metastatic disease , resulting in a poor prognosis [ 2 ] .
metastasis occurs secondary to tumor cell adhesion , cell migration , and proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) by matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) [ 3 ] .
mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 are especially prognostic for survival and metastatic potential in ovarian cancer [ 4,5,6 ] .
clinical studies document the association of increased mmp expression with the progression of ovarian cancer [ 7,8 ] .
rath and pauling proposed that nutrients such as lysine and ascorbic acid could act as natural inhibitors of ecm degradation , since these nutrients modulate mmp activity and strengthen the connective tissue surrounding cancer cells , thereby potentially inhibiting tumor growth and progression [ 9 ] .
we selected naturally occurring nutrients such as lysine , proline , ascorbic acid , green tea extract , and quercetin to target cancer development and developed a nutrient mixture that has exhibited synergistic anticancer activity in vivo and in vitro in a number of cancer cell lines through the inhibition of cancer cell growth , mmp secretion , invasion , metastasis , and angiogenesis [ 10 ] .
a previous xenograft study on the effect of epq on human ovarian cancer es - 2 cell line demonstrated significant inhibition of es - 2 tumor weight and burden by 59.2 % ( p < 0.0001 ) and 59.7 % ( p < 0.0001 ) , respectively , as well as supportive in vitro results [ 11 ] .
though the es - 2 xenograft model was suitable for demonstrating tumorigenicity and testing the effect of therapeutic agents , tumors in this model do not grow in the anatomically correct site , the ovary .
using ip injection of ovarian cancer cells such as a - 2780 has shown strong ovarian tumor growth and metastasis , as in human ovarian cancer [ 12 ] .
thus , in this study , our objective was to study the effect of supplementation with epq on ovarian tumor incidence and growth , and lung metastasis secondary to ip injection of ovarian a - 2780 cells in female nude mice , as well as the effect of epq in vitro on a - 2780 cell proliferation , mmp secretion , and matrigel invasion .
2. materials and methods human ovarian cancer cell line a - 2780 , along with the culture media dmem , were obtained from atcc ( american type culture collection , rockville , md , usa ) .
antibiotics , penicillin , and fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) were obtained from gibco ( brl , long island , ny , usa ) .
twenty - four - well tissue culture plates were obtained from costar ( cambrdige , ma , usa ) .
gelatinase zymography was performed in 10 % novex pre - cast sds polyacrylamide gel ( invitrogen inc. , carlsbad , ca , usa ) with 0.1 % gelatin in non - reducing conditions .
the nutrient mixture ( epq ) , prepared by vitatech ( hayward , ca , usa ) was composed of the following ingredients in the relative amounts indicated : vitamin c ( as ascorbic acid and as mg , ca , and palmitate ascorbate ) 700 mg ; l - lysine 1000 mg ; l - proline 750 mg ; l - arginine 500 mg ; n - acetyl cysteine 200 mg ; standardized green tea extract ( 80 % polyphenol ) 1000 mg ; quercetin from quercetin dihydrate , saphora japonica 50 mg ; selenium 30 mug ; copper 2 mg ; manganese 1 mg. all other reagents used were of high quality and were obtained from sigma , unless otherwise indicated .
2.1 .
in vivo studies 2.1.1 .
animals female nude mice , approximately five weeks of age on arrival , were purchased from simonsen laboratories , gilroy , ca and maintained in microisolator cages under pathogen - free conditions on a 12 - h light / 12 - h dark schedule for a week .
all procedures were performed with humane and customary care and use of experimental animals and followed a protocol approved by an internal institutional animal safety review committee .
2.1.2 .
experimental design after being housed for a week , athymic female nude mice ( n = 12 ) were inoculated ip with 2 x 106 cells in 0.1 ml of phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) .
after injection , the mice were randomly divided into two groups ; the control group of mice was fed regular purina mouse chow and the epq group the regular diet supplemented with 0.5 % epq ( w / w ) .
the regular diet was laboratory rodent diet 5001 from purina mills ( gray summit , mo , usa ) llc / test diet .
the 0.5 % epq diet was milled and pressed by purina mills , llc and generated by vitatech ( tustin , ca , usa ) .
during the study , the mice consumed , on the average , 4 g of their respective diets per day .
thus , the supplemented mice received approximately 20 mg of epq per day .
four weeks later , the mice were sacrificed and tumors that developed in the ovary were excised , weighed , and processed for histology .
2.1.3 .
histology tissue samples were fixed in 10 % buffered formalin .
all tissues were embedded in paraffin and cut at 4 - 5 microns .
sections were deparaffinized through xylene and graduated alcohol series to water and stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) for evaluation using a standard light microscope .
2.2 .
in vitro studies 2.2.1 .
cell culture human ovarian cancer a - 2780 cells were grown in dmem medium supplemented with 10 % fbs , penicillin ( 100 units / ml ) , and streptomycin ( 100 mug / ml ) in 24 - well tissue culture plates .
cells were incubated with 1 ml of media at 37 degreesc in a tissue culture incubator equilibrated with 95 % air and 5 % co2 .
at near confluence , the cells were treated with epq , dissolved in media , and tested at 0 , 50 , 100 , 250 , 500 , and 1000 microg / ml in triplicate at each dose .
phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( pma ) , 100 ng / ml was added to cells to induce mmp - 9 secretion .
the plates were then returned to the incubator .
2.2.2 .
mtt assay cell viability was evaluated via mtt assay , a colorimetric assay based on the ability of viable cells to reduce a soluble yellow tetrazolium salt ( 3 - ( 4,5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) 2,5 - diphenyl tetrazolium bromide ) ( mtt ) to a blue formazan crystal by mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity of viable cells .
this test is a good index of mitochondrial activity and thus of cell viability .
after 24 h of incubation , the cells were washed with pbs and 500 mul of mtt ( sigma # m - 2128 , st. louis , mo , usa ) 0.5 mg / ml in media was added to each well .
after mtt addition ( 0.5 mg / ml ) , the plates were covered and returned to the 37 degreesc incubator for 2 h , the optimal time for formazan product formation .
following incubation , the supernatant was carefully removed from the wells , the formazan product was dissolved in 1 ml of dmso , and absorbance was measured at 570 nm in bio spec 1601 , shimadzu spectrometer ( schimadzu , santa clara , ca , usa ) .
the od570 of the dmso solution in each well was considered to be proportional to the number of cells .
the od570 of the control ( treatment without supplement ) was considered 100 % .
2.2.3 .
gelatinase zymography gelatinase zymography was performed in 10 % novex pre - cast sds polyacrylamide gel ( invitrogen corporation , carlsbad , ca , usa ) in the presence of 0.1 % gelatin under non - reducing conditions .
culture media ( 20 mul ) were mixed with sample buffer and loaded for sds - page with tris glycine sds buffer , as suggested by the manufacturer ( novex ) .
samples were not boiled before electrophoresis .
following electrophoresis , the gels were washed twice in 2.5 % triton x - 100 for 30 min at room temperature to remove sds .
the gels were then incubated at 37 degreesc overnight in substrate buffer containing 50 mm tris - hcl and 10 mm cacl2 at ph 8.0 and stained with 0.5 % coomassie blue r250 in 50 % methanol and 10 % glacial acetic acid for 30 min and destained .
upon renaturation of the enzyme , the gelatinases digested the gelatin in the gel , producing clear bands against an intensely stained background .
protein standards were run concurrently and approximate molecular weights were determined by plotting the relative mobilities of known proteins .
2.2.4 .
matrigel invasion invasion studies were conducted using matrigel ( becton dickinson , san jose , ca , usa ) inserts in 24 - well plates .
suspended in medium , a - 2780 cells were supplemented with nutrients , as specified in the design of the experiment and seeded on the insert in the well .
thus , both the medium on the insert and in the well contained the same supplements .
the plates with the inserts were then incubated in a culture incubator equilibrated with 95 % air and 5 % co2 for 24 h. after incubation , the media from the wells were withdrawn .
the cells on the upper surface of the inserts were gently scrubbed away with cotton swabs .
the cells that had penetrated the matrigel membrane and migrated onto the lower surface of the matrigel were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and visually counted under the microscope .
2.2.5 .
morphology : h & e morphology of cells cultured for 24 h in test concentrations of epq were evaluated via h & e staining and observed and photographed by microscopy .
2.2.6 .
statistical analysis the results were expressed as means +/ - sd , as indicated in the results , for the groups .
data was analyzed by an independent sample " t " test .
pearson 's correlation coefficient and anova one - way variance for the mtt results compared to the concentration of epq was run using medcalc software ( mariakerke , belgium ) .
ic50 was also analyzed for the mtt results .
3. results in this study , our objective was to study the effect of supplementation with epq on ovarian tumor incidence and growth , and lung metastasis , secondary to ip injection of ovarian a - 2780 cells in female nude mice , as well as the effect of epq in vitro on a - 2780 cell proliferation , mmp secretion , and matrigel invasion .
3.1 .
in vivo 3.1.1 .
tumor incidence and growth epq strongly inhibited the growth of ovarian tumors in female nude mice .
all control mice developed large ovarian tumors , whereas 5 out of 6 mice in the epq group developed no tumors , and one , a small tumor .
mean tumor weight per mouse was inhibited by 98 % ( p < 0.0001 ) with epq 0.5 % dietary supplementation , as shown in figure 1 .
mean tumor weight of the control group was 2.6 +/ - 0.42 g and mean tumor weight of epq group 0.058 +/ - 0.14 g. see figure 2 and figure 3 .
mean weight of mice at the initiation of study and that at the termination of study did not differ significantly between groups .
3.1.2 .
tumor metastasis to lungs tumor metastasis to lungs was found in 6 out of 6 control mice , whereas no lung metastasis was evident in epq mice .
see figure 4 .
3.1.3 .
histology histologically , the tumors from both groups were irregularly round and had skin subcutaneous masses , consistent with clear cell ovarian carcinoma ; however , the only tumor from the epq group was significantly smaller in size than all of the tumors from the control group .
in the control group , necrosis varied from 35 % to 65 % and mitotic figures ranged between 0 and 1 .
see figure 5a,b for representative sections from the control group .
the epq group of mice showed mild to moderate multiple small glandular cysts in the uterus .
the only tumor found in the epq group , shown in figure 5c , demonstrated replacement of one ovary with a large tumor composed of irregularly round cells with indistinct cell borders and round nuclei .
necrosis involved 40 % of the tumor mass , and mitotic figures ranged from 4 - 5 per high powered field .
sections shown in figure 5d,e are from the epq mouse with a tumor .
sections from tumor - free epq mice are shown in figure 5f - h .
3.2 .
in vitro 3.2.1 .
cell proliferation epq exhibited significant ( p <= 0.0001 , correlation coefficient r = - 0.834 , p < 0.0001 ) dose - dependent inhibition of ovarian a - 2780 cell proliferation in vitro with 41 % , 65 % , 73 % , and 80 % inhibition of cell growth at 100 , 250 , 500 , and 1000 mug / ml epq , respectively , compared to the control , as shown in figure 6 .
anova one - way variance showed a significance level of p < 0.001 ( f - ratio 362.3 , df 5 , 12 ) .
ic50 was determined to be 120 mug / ml .
3.2.2 .
gelatinase zymography zymography demonstrated only mmp - 9 expression by ovarian a - 2780 cells , which epq inhibited in a dose - dependent fashion , with virtual total block at 250 mug / ml concentration , as shown in figure 7 .
3.2.3 .
matrigel invasion epq significantly inhibited a - 2780 cell invasion through matrigel in a dose - dependent manner , with total block at 250 mug / ml , as shown in figure 8 .
3.2.4 .
morphology : h & e staining h & e staining showed no morphological changes below epq 100 microg / ml , as shown in figure 9 .
4. discussion the model of ip injection of ovarian a - 2780 cells into female nude mice led to strong ovarian tumor growth and lung metastasis in the control group , as anticipated , thus indicating success of the model .
currently , the cell line utilized is not considered a high - grade serous ovarian cancer cell line ; however , a2780 cells do offer the advantage of intraperitoneal growth , which is more realistic than a subcutaneous model .
the results of the in vivo study of human ovarian tumor growth in immune impaired ( athymic ) female nude mice injected ip with a - 2780 cells demonstrated significant suppression of ovarian tumor incidence ( by 83 %) and growth ( 87 % ; p < 0.0001 ) with epq 0.5 % dietary supplementation .
furthermore , epq totally inhibited metastasis to lungs compared to control mice , which exhibited 100 % lung metastasis .
serum levels of epq in mice were not determined .
results from the in vitro studies support the in vivo findings , as epq showed inhibition of mmp - 9 secretion with virtual total block at 250 mug / ml epq and 100 % inhibition of invasion of cells through matrigel at 250 microg / ml. in addition , epq showed increased toxicity to a - 2780 cells in a dose - dependent manner , with 80 % inhibition of cell growth in cells exposed to 1000 mug / ml epq .
high consumption of fruits and vegetables , have been reported to be associated with prevention , inhibition , and reversal of cancers [ 13,14 ] .
epq formulation was based on addressing critical physiological targets in cancer progression and metastasis .
adequate supplies of ascorbic acid , lysine , and proline are essential to ensuring an optimal ecm structure , and lysine supports ecm stability as a natural inhibitor of plasmin - induced proteolysis [ 9,15 ] .
collagen formation is also dependent upon manganese and copper .
green tea extract has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of cancer cell growth , metastasis , angiogenesis , and other aspects of cancer progression [ 16,17,18,19,20,21,22 ] .
quercetin 's anticancer effects include the induction of cell cycle arrest , apoptosis ( without affecting normal cells ) , and antioxidant activity in vivo and in vitro [ 23 ] .
ascorbic acid has been documented to effect cytotoxic and antimetastatic actions on malignant cell lines [ 24,25,26,27,28,29 ] and low ascorbate levels are noted in cancer patients [ 30,31 ] .
selenium and n - acetyl cysteine demonstrated the inhibition of mmp - 9 , migration , and invasive activities [ 32,33,34 ] .
a precursor of nitric oxide , arginine , induces apoptosis [ 35 ] .
5. conclusions since current treatment methods for ovarian cancer are generally ineffective , there is a need for the development of effective therapeutic agents for these cancers with minimal toxicity .
our studies demonstrated that the mixture of the non - toxic components of epq significantly suppressed ovarian tumor incidence and growth and completely blocked metastasis to lungs .
in vitro , mmp - 9 secretion and matrigel invasion were strongly inhibited and epq showed potent dose - dependent toxicity to a - 2780 cells .
these findings suggest a potential of epq in the treatment of ovarian cancer .

figure 5 histology of representative ovaries in groups : magnification 200x except ( h ) which is 100x .
control sections shown in ( a,b ) .
sections from epq - treated mice shown in ( c - h ) .
the representative section shown in ( a ) presents two sections of a large , round tumor from the control group which appeared to have destroyed the ovary or ovaries .
necrosis varied from 35 % in one section to 65 % in the second section .
mitotic figures ranged from 0 - 1 per high - powered field .
the section in ( b ) shows a large , round mass from the control group adjoining a small section of the uterus , suggesting it involves an ovary .
cell morphology was similar to ( a ) .
necrosis involved about 50 % of the mass .
mitotic figures ranged from 0 - 1 per high - powered field .
the section from the only tumor found in the epq group is shown in ( c ) .
sections of uterus , cervix , vagina , and ovaries are seen .
mild to moderate multiple small , glandular cysts are present in the uterus .
one ovary was totally replaced by a large tumor composed of irregularly , round cells with indistinct cell borders and irregularly round nuclei .
mitotic figures ranged from 4 - 5 per high - powered field .
multiple foci of necrosis involved about 40 % of the tumor mass .
the second ovary has two foci of tumor cells .
the section shown in ( d ) shows a lesion in the second ovary from the same mouse shown in ( c ) and follicular proliferation is shown in ( e ) .
in ( e ) , squamous epithelial hyperplasia is present in the cervix and vagina .
multiple , small , glandular cysts are present in the uterus .
no overt tumor is present in the ovary .
in ( f ) , a section of uterus , cervix , vagina , and two ovaries shows multiple developing ovaries present in follicles of both ovaries .
in ( g ) , representative sections of uterus , cervix , vagina , and two ovaries from mice without ovarian tumors are shown ; no significant changes were evident in examined tissues .
in ( h ) , a section of uterus , cervix , vagina , and two ovaries , multiple , small glandular cysts are present in the uterus .
both ovaries have 1 - 4 enlarged luteal or follicular structures , composed of sheets of cells morphologically similar to the neoplastic cells in prior tumors .

the pathogenesis of chronic chagasic cardiomyophathy associated with chagas disease is still controversial , although evidence indicates a t cell - dependent autoimmune process .
using a mouse model for chronic chagas disease , we previously evidenced that hearts grafted within the ears of trypanosoma cruzi infected syngeneic recipients were rejected through a cd4 + t cell - dependent mechanism .
moreover , we showed that such a process was dependent on laminin - mediated interactions , since it could be abrogated by anti - laminin or anti - laminin receptor antibodies .
in this review the same passive cell transfer model is considered for discussion : the participation of the laminin alteration in the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate formed in response to the antimyocardial autoreactive cd4 + t cells , as well as the presence of laminin - binding cytokines .
finally we suggest the existence of a relationship between the inflammatory infiltrate , the laminin contents and deposition of pro - inflammatory laminin - binding cytokines , which may act in concert during the generation of chagas disease - related cardiomyophathy .

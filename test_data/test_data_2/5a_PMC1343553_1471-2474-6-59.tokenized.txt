background reproducibility measurements of the range of motion are an important prerequisite for the interpretation of study results .
the aim of the study is to assess the intra - rater and inter - rater reproducibility of the measurement of active range of motion ( rom ) in patients with neck pain using the cybex electronic digital inclinometer - 320 ( edi - 320 ) .
methods in an outpatient clinic in a primary care setting 32 patients with at least 2 weeks of pain and / or stiffness in the neck were randomly assessed , in a test - retest design with blinded raters using a standardized measurement protocol .
cervical flexion - extension , lateral flexion and rotation were assessed .
results reliability expressed by the intraclass correlation coefficient ( icc ) was 0.93 ( lateral flexion ) or higher for intra - rater reliability and 0.89 ( lateral flexion ) or higher for inter - rater reliability .
the 95 % limits of agreement for intra - rater agreement , expressing the range of the differences between two ratings were - 2.5 +/ - 11.1degrees for flexion - extension , - 0.1 +/ - 10.4degrees for lateral flexion and - 5.9 +/ - 13.5degrees for rotation .
for inter - rater agreement the limits of agreement were 3.3 +/ - 17.0degrees for flexion - extension , 0.5 +/ - 17.0degrees for lateral flexion and - 1.3 +/ - 24.6degrees for rotation .
conclusion in general , the intra - rater reproducibility and the inter - rater reproducibility were good .
we recommend to compare the reproducibility and clinical applicability of the edi - 320 inclinometer with other cervical rom measures in symptomatic patients .
background neck pain is a common musculoskeletal disorder .
the point prevalence for neck pain in the general population of the netherlands varies between 9 % and 22 % [ 1,2 ] , and approximately one - third of all adults will experience neck pain during the course of 1 year [ 3 ] .
patients usually receive conservative treatment such as physical therapy or continued care by a general practitioner ( gp ) [ 4 ] .
a physical evaluation is often used for both the diagnosis and the evaluation of treatment success in patients with neck pain [ 5 ] .
one aspect for the physical assessment of the cervical spine is the evaluation of active range of motion ( rom ) .
active cervical rom is difficult to measure because of compensatory movements , and it is influenced by aging and systemic disorders [ 6 ] .
several non - invasive methods for assessing the rom have been available , such as visual estimation , two - arm goniometry , inclinometry , compass technology , video technology , electromagnetic technology and potentiometry .
for the majority of these instruments the intra - rater and inter - rater reproducibility has not been tested adequately .
radiography has been proven to be of questionable reproducibility [ 6,7 ] .
in an extensive critical appraisal of reliability studies on cervical rom measures jordan evaluated 21 papers for methodological rigor [ 8 ] .
commonly identified flaws in these reliability studies were low sample size , unclear selection criteria , the use of only healthy individuals , use of inadequate reliability statistics , the absence of a protocol , and questionable applicability in clinical practice .
in our experience the cybex electronic digital inclinometer - 320 ( edi - 320 ) is a practical tool for the objective measurement of active rom [ 9 ] .
one of the clinical advantages of the edi - 320 is that it does not have to be fitted on the patient and it is portable .
previous studies using the edi - 320 have investigated the intra - rater and inter - rater reproducibility only in healthy subjects [ 10,11 ] .
it is unknown whether these reproducibility results are applicable to patients with pain or stiffness in the neck .
consequently , the aim of our study is to determine the intra - rater and inter - rater reproducibility in patients with non - specific neck pain .
we also assess whether the reproducibility can be improved when two ratings per rater are used instead of one rating .
furthermore , we evaluate whether the inter - rater reproducibility is affected by the severity of pain .
results of reproducibility studies can be used for many purposes .
one application is the determination of changes that can be detected beyond measurement error : the smallest detectable difference ( sdd ) .
in the present study we assess sdd for an individual patient .
methods patient characteristics consecutive patients with neck pain , referred by local general practitioners for physical therapy in zoetermeer , the netherlands , were invited to participate .
the selection criteria were : age between 18 and 70 years , pain and / or stiffness in the neck for at least 2 weeks , and written informed consent .
patients were excluded if they had received surgery in the cervical region or had evidence of specific pathology , such as malignancy , neurological disease , fracture , herniated disc or systemic rheumatic disease .
data on demographics ( e.g. age and gender ) , clinical factors ( duration , concomitant complaints ) , neck pain on a numerical 0 - 10 point scale ranging from 0 ( no pain ) to 10 ( maximal pain ) , and disability assessed with the neck disability index ( ndi ) [ 12 ] were collected by an independent research assistant prior to the actual active rom measurements .
rater characteristics the raters were two physical therapists with 3 months experience using the edi - 320 inclinometer ( lumex , inc. , ronkonkoma , new york ) [ 9 ] and both performed weekly cervical rom assessments in another study .
the measurement procedures were practiced on 5 healthy volunteers prior to the start of the present study .
measurement protocol for the measurements of cervical flexion - extension and lateral flexion the patient was seated upright in a high chair , with the hands resting on the upper thigh .
for the measurement of cervical flexion - extension , the position of 0 degrees was in maximal cervical flexion (" chin to chest ") , followed by maximal cervical extension .
likewise , the measurements of lateral flexion were initiated with the position of 0 degrees in maximal lateral flexion to the left (" ear to left shoulder ") , followed by maximal lateral flexion to the right .
because active rom using the edi - 320 inclinometer can only be measured against gravity , the ratings of cervical rotation were performed with the patient in a supine position .
the position of 0 degrees was in maximal left rotation , followed by maximal right rotation .
during rotation the head slide over a cushioned treatment table and the patient was not allowed to make any compensatory lateral flexion with the head .
see figure 1 figure 1 picture of head position during rotation .
we chose for full cycle rom ( for example : from left to right rotation ) as the neutral head position is difficult to perform in half - cycle rom ( for example : from the neutral to left rotation ) assessments in the cervical spine [ 7 ] .
the reference point for the edi was on the forehead for both flexion - extension and rotation , and right above the ear for lateral flexion .
throughout the motion , the physiotherapist maintained contact with the edi and the reference point on the head .
the subjects were instructed to perform the movement and then to practice twice before performing the actual movement .
the patient was instructed only to move the head , and to avoid compensatory movements in the thoracic or lumbar region .
the patient was gently guided through the whole range of motion , and manual contact was applied by the rater .
the patient was encouraged to perform a maximal movement until the end of the active rom was reached , or until the pain prevented the patient from going any further .
procedure reproducibility study active rom of the cervical spine was assessed twice in three planes in the following order : maximal flexion to maximal extension ( 2x ) , maximal lateral flexion from left to right ( 2x ) , and maximal rotation from left to right ( 2x ) .
the time interval between measurement between the first and second ratings of a single rater was 5 minutes and the interval between raters was 10 minutes .
the order of the raters was randomized using a computer generated random sequence table .
at all times only one rater was present in the examination room , together with the research assistant .
the research assistant recorded the number of degrees , which were electronically displayed on the edi - 320 .
in order to keep the raters blind for the outcome of measurement , the read out on the electronic display of the edi - 320 was concealed for both raters and patients .
thus , the raters were unaware of the previous measurements by the other rater .
data analysis we used two different measures which are increasingly used in reproducibility studies : one measure to assess agreement and one measure to assess reliability [ 13,14 ] .
figure 2 shows an overview of the intra - rater and inter - rater comparisons we made .
figure 2 flow diagram measurements and assessment of intra - and inter - rater reproducibility .
agreement parameters parameters of agreement measure the ability to achieve the same value in two measurements , and gives an indication of the size of the measurement errors .
we assess the 95 % limits of agreement ( loa ) according to bland and altman as a measure of agreement [ 15 ] .
the mean difference between the scores of both raters was calculated , representing the systematic differences ( bias ) between the measurements .
the standard deviation ( sd ) of this difference represented the extent to which the rater ( s ) recorded the same mean value in each plane .
then the 95 % limits of agreement ( loa ) were calculated ( mean of the difference +/ - 1.96 * sd ) , indicating the ' total error ' , systematic and random error together [ 16 ] .
as no clear criteria exist for acceptable value of intra - rater and inter - rater agreements for active rom outcome measures , we defined , a priori , that a difference in measurement between the raters of 10 % of the total range of measurement values would be acceptable .
the bland and altman method can be visualized by plotting the differences between the first and the second ratings against the corresponding mean of the first and the second rating .
this visual representation of agreement illustrates the magnitude and range of the differences , bias or outliers , and the relation between the magnitude of the differences and the magnitude of the mean values [ 15 ] .
based on the agreement results of rater a the smallest detectable difference ( sdd ) for an individual level was calculated for each movement by multiplying the sd of the differences by 1.96 : 1.96 * sd change .
the sdd represents the change that can be detected by the edi - 320 beyond measurement error [ 17,18 ] reliability parameters reliability parameters reflect the extent to which a measurement instrument can differentiate between patients [ 19 ] .
if persons differ a lot , it is easier to distinguish them from each other , despite some measurement errors .
in that case the measurement errors are related to the differences between the persons .
as a parameter of reliability the intraclass correlation coefficient ( icc ) was used ( figure 2 ) [ 16 ] , streiner and norman 2003 ) .
we used iccs which took systematic differences in the measurements into account .
these iccs are defined as the ratio of the variance among patients ( patient variability ) over the total variance ( among patients , among raters plus the error variance ) , which ranges between 0 ( no reliability ) and 1 ( perfect reliability ) .
the cut - off point of icc > 0.75 was chosen a priori as an indication of acceptable reliability [ 20 ] .
we used spss 9.0 statistical software ( spss inc. , chicago , illinois ) to calculate the iccs [ 21 ] .
in case the unit of analyses was the mean of two ratings by one rater , variances in which the raters were involved were divided by a factor 2 [ 21 ] .
figure 2 shows an overview of intra - and interrater comparisions results patient characteristics during a period of 4 months ( april 1999 - june 1999 ) 32 patients with neck pain were recruited .
the mean age of patients included in this study was 45 years , and approximately 63 % were female ( table 1 ) .
patients had suffered from neck pain for a median duration of 13 weeks and in more than half of the patients the neck pain was recurrent .
patients rated the severity of their current neck pain , on average , as 4.2 on a numeric 11 - point scale .
the mean score for the ndi was 15.2 points ( maximal disability : 50 points ) .

small but statistically significant systematic differences are seen for rotation for which the second rating of active rom is higher , both for rater a and b ( mean difference rater a : - 5.9 , 95 % ci - 8.4 to - 3.4 ; rater b : - 2.7 , 95 % ci - 5.3 to - 0.03 ) and for flexion - extension ( rater a : - 2.5 , 95 % ci - 4.5 to - 0.5 ) .
the limits of agreement were broadest for rotation .
the standard deviation of the difference , representing the extent to which rater a achieved the same mean scores for the first and second rating , ranged between 5.3degrees ( lateral flexion ) , 5.7degrees ( flexion - extension ) and 6.9degrees ( rotation ). from these , the limits of agreement were calculated .
for any new patient it is expected with an approximate 95 % probability that the difference between the two ratings of rater a should lie within the limits of agreement ; which were - 2.5 +/ - 11.1degrees for flexion - extension , - 0.1 +/ - 10.4degrees for lateral flexion and - 5.9 +/ - 13.5degrees for rotation .
figure 3 shows that the magnitude of the difference is not associated with their mean value , indicating that the mean difference and the standard deviation of the differences are adequate summary statistics of agreement. from the graphs , there were no indications of a larger variability for higher test values , i.e. homoscedasticity .

likewise the inter - rater reliability was also good with iccs of 0.89 or higher for all three planes .
one rating versus two ratings per rater table 3 shows that when only one rating per rater was used instead of two , the limits of agreement were slightly wider and the icc were slightly lower .
the influence of pain on the inter - rater agreement and reliability in addition , we compared patients with a high pain score ( 7 points or higher on a 0 - 10 point scale , n = 9 ) to patients with a low or moderate pain score ( 6 points or lower on a 0 - 10 point scale , n = 23 ) .
patients with high pain intensity had lower active rom values compared to patients with a low pain intensity ( p <= 0.05 ) .
although the standard deviations of the individual raters were higher in the high pain intensity group , the standard deviations of the mean differences were similar and consequently , the 95 % limits of agreement did not differ much ( table 3 ) .
therefore also the limits of agreement are similar .
the icc values in the high pain intensity group are slightly higher compared with those in the low pain intensity group .
the smallest detectable difference the mean active rom values ( mean of 4 ratings by 2 raters ) were 100.9 degrees for flexion - extension , 72.4 degrees for lateral flexion and 139.0 degrees for rotation .
the acceptable differences to be detected , defined as 10 % of the used range of the scale , were therefore 10.1 for flexion - extension , 7.2 degrees for lateral flexion and 13.9 degrees for rotation based on the intra - rater agreement results ( rater a ) , the sdd for an individual was 11.1 degrees for flexion - extension , 10.4 degrees for lateral flexion and 13.5 degrees for rotation .
this means that only changes in cervical range of motion larger than these values can be detected beyond measurement error when a single physiotherapist performs both measurements .
if the measurements on which the change in cervical range of motion is based are performed by two different raters than the sdds were 17.0 , 17.0 and 24.6 for flexion - extension , for lateral flexion and for rotation , respectively .
discussion the first aim of this study was to investigate the intra - rater and inter - rater reproducibility of the assessment of range of motion in three planes for patients with neck pain , using the cybex edi - 320 inclinometer .
for intra - rater reproducibility we compared the first rating with the second rating of each rater and for the inter - rater reproducibility we compared rater a with rater b. some systematic differences were observed , however these were small considering the overall active rom in each plane for both the intra - rater and inter - rater agreement .
overall , we found good intra - rater and inter - rater reliability statistics ( iccs of 0.86 or higher ) .
as expected both agreement and reliability were slightly higher for the intra - rater comparisons than for the inter - rater comparisons .
high reliability does not necessarily mean that the raters agree in an absolute sense on the active rom ( agreement ) [ 13,14 ] .
for this reason we included both parameters of agreement and reliability in the present study .
the sdd , based on intra - rater agreement , for flexion - extension ( 11.1degrees ) and rotation ( 13.5degrees ) was almost equal to the cut - off values for our predefined criteria for an acceptable clinical difference ( 10.1degrees and 13.9degrees , respectively ) .
however , for lateral flexion ( 10.4degrees ) an acceptable clinical difference may be somewhat more difficult to detect as the sdd was higher than our predefined acceptable difference of 10 % ( 7.2degrees ) .
also measurements performed by different raters are insufficiently reproducible to detect the predefined difference of 10 % of the used range of the measurement scale .
however , this holds for sdds calculated on the individual level .
in research , when groups of patients are used the edi - 320 is sufficiently reproducible for all measurements of range of motion , because sdd values should be divided by sqrtn to obtain sdd for group level , with a group size of n. to minimize any random error , the inter - rater statistics were based on the mean of two ratings as outlined in our protocol .
we investigated whether just one rating per rater instead of two would yield acceptable reproducibility statistics ( second aim ) .
although a duplicate rating did not improve the reproducibility much , the 2nd rating with the edi - 320 can be done easily .
similarly , we evaluated whether reproducibility was affected by the severity of pain .
patients with high pain intensity had on average , less rom compared to patients in the low pain intensity group ( p <= 0.05 ) .
however , reliability and agreement were acceptable in both the group with low and high pain intensity .
we hypothesized that pain and limitation of movement could either increase or decrease during the course of a series of movements and thus pose sources of systematic variation to the assessment of reproducibility [ 22 ]. by comparing the first and second consecutive pair of ratings ( independent of the rater ) , a statistically significant small , but not clinically relevant , difference was observed for flexion - extension ( 3.4 degrees difference : 95 % ci 0.2 to 6.5 ) .
we therefore conclude that the effect of repeated movements on cervical rom was minimal .
in the present study we looked at the intra - rater reproducibility by comparing two consecutive ratings with a minimal time interval and inter - rater reproducibility with an interval of approximately 10 minutes .
the main reason for the choice of the time interval of 10 minutes was a practical one : we could measure a patient in one single visit .
our assumption was that within 10 minutes the patients will be stable on pain perception and range of motion .
had we chosen a larger time interval our results might have been different , however .
ideally , true intra - rater variability is evaluated for a disorder stable within the time frame evaluated .
however , we consider a large time interval not desirable for the assessment of measurement variation because of the biological variation within subjects over time [ 6,23 ] .
more than half of all studies on the reproducibility of cervical rom have inappropriately used t - tests or repeated measures anova , which are not considered true reliability statistics [ 8 ] .
the icc is used in only a few studies [ 8 ] .
icc values are known to be dependent on the variation in the study population [ 24 ] .
as can be seen from the visual representation of agreement ( figure 2 ) , the active rom values for lateral flexion are somewhat more clustered together ( a smaller range ) than the other two planes .
the more homogeneous values might give some explanation for the somewhat lower iccs for lateral flexion , and the wider range of values result in higher iccs for rotation .
likewise , the larger variation in active rom values in the high pain intensity group might also explain the higher iccs compared to the low pain intensity group .
studies that measure rom for patients with neck disorders are scarce .
a systematic review identified that only 6 studies assessed reliability in patients with cervical disorders and of these only 2 studies had more than 30 subjects [ 8 ] .
two studies reported on the reproducibility of the edi - 320 for cervical rom in healthy subjects [ 10,11 ] .
the first one reported acceptable agreement results and found that more than 90 % of the successive ratings for cervical flexion and lateral flexion by two raters were within a range between 0 - 10 degrees [ 10 ] .
the other study only investigated flexion and extension , and reported moderate to high intra - rater reliability ( flexion icc 0.77 , extension 0.79 - 83 ) and somewhat lower inter - rater reliability ( flexion icc 0.66 - 0.73 ; extension icc 0.66 - 0.80 ) [ 11 ] .
the authors of this study report that the reliability could be improved by using a standardized protocol .
comparison of icc values between different studies is hampered by the dependency of icc values on the variability of range of motion values of the population under study [ 14 ] .
de winter et al showed that for measurements of range of motion in 155 patients with shoulder complaints , the icc were high for the affected shoulder ( icc = 0.83 ) and low for the non - affected shoulder ( icc = 0.28 ) .
this difference was completely due to variability of range of motion found for the affected shoulder , which was large and the non - affected shoulder , which was low .
the crom device is the most frequently reported measure for cervical rom and variable icc values have been reported , both alone or when compared to other rom instruments [ 8,25,26 ] .
one study on patients with cervical spine disorders reported inter - rater iccs for active rom greater than 0.80 with the cervical range of motion device ( crom device ) compared to iccs lower than 0.80 for visual estimation and a universal goniometer ( youdas et al 1991 ) .
considering the results of this study it would be interesting to directly compare the crom device with the edi - 320 inclinometer in a future study .
our population consisted of patients with non - specific neck pain , readers can compare the patient profile presented in this article with their own patients .
the measurement procedure is quick and simple , which we hope will facilitate replication of our reproducibility design in other clinical settings .
conclusion in general , the intra - rater reproducibility and the inter - rater reproducibility were acceptable , despite slight variations .
we recommend that the reproducibility and clinical applicability of the edi - 320 inclinometer is compared with other cervical rom measures in a symptomatic patient population .

we have now reanalysed all our x - ray diffraction patterns , in particular those at room pressure where potential volatile components ( for example , co2 ) are absent , making data interpretation as simple and clean as possible1 .
indeed , we find that orthorhombic beta - reo2 ( pbcn ) provides a better fit to the temperature - quenched new phase than tetragonal cristobalite .
this possibility was also indicated by experimental results from santamaria - perez and co - workers2 .
hence what we previously interpreted as a co2 - sio2 solid solution now appears to be reo2 , indicating the decomposition of co2 leading to the oxidation of re from the gasket , which is found to diffuse into the sample in the laser heating experiment .
the authors therefore wish to retract this article .

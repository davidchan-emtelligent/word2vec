computer - assisted technology has the potential to reduce error and subjectivity in the management of these complex injuries .
a systematic review of the literature was conducted to explore the emerging role of computer - assisted technologies in post - traumatic orbital reconstruction , in terms of functional and safety outcomes .
we searched for articles comparing computer - assisted procedures with conventional surgery and studied outcomes on diplopia , enophthalmos , or procedure - related complications .
six observational studies with 273 orbits at a mean follow - up of 13 months were included .
three out of 4 studies reported significantly fewer patients with residual diplopia in the computer - assisted group , while only 1 of the 5 studies reported better improvement in enophthalmos in the assisted group .
types and incidence of complications were comparable .
study heterogeneities limiting statistical comparison by meta - analysis will be discussed .
this review highlights the scarcity of data on computer - assisted technology in orbital reconstruction .
the result suggests that computer - assisted technology may offer potential advantage in treating diplopia while its role remains to be confirmed in enophthalmos .
additional well - designed and powered randomized controlled trials are much needed .
orbital fractures occur in 40 % of all craniomaxillofacial traumas12 .
patients often present with diplopia or enophthalmos for surgical repair3 .
enophthalmos , clinically defined as an inter - ocular difference of more than 2 mm in exophthalmometry , remains a surgical challenge in post - traumatic orbital reconstruction4567 .
orbital fracture repair includes reducing prolapsed tissues , removing unstable bones , and replacing the bony defect with an implant without hindering extraocular motility8 .
computer - assisted technology using computerized tomography ( ct ) plays an emerging role in orbital reconstruction during preoperative planning , implant design , intraoperative navigation and postoperative auditing .
in preoperative planning , a mirror image overlay ( mio ) is created based on the uninjured , contralateral orbit and is superimposed onto the images of the injured side9 .
during computer - aided design and computer - aided modeling ( cad / cam ) , the ct data is segmented and digitally transformed to create a three - dimensional model via stereolithography1011 .
this is then used to manually mould or manufacture a " patient - specific " implant1213 .
using intra - operative navigation , surgeons obtain real - time coordinates of surgical instruments and implants with respect to the surrounding bony structures .
while there are recommendations and reviews on the indication and timing of surgery3 , materials of reconstruction14 , the role of endoscopic - assisted repair15 , the role of computer - assisted technology in orbital reconstruction has not been defined .
to address this , we conducted a systematic review on the use of computer - assisted technology augmented surgery versus conventional surgery in post - traumatic orbital reconstruction to evaluate its functional and safety outcomes .
methods eligibility criteria for considering studies for this review studies were included if they : compared computer - assisted technology versus conventional surgery .
used computer - assisted technology in the treatment of orbital reconstruction , including but not limited to preoperative planning , surgical navigation , or cad / cam implants .
included detailed description of the computer - assisted techniques used .
performed primary and / or secondary reconstruction of fractured orbital walls .
examined at least one of the following outcomes : diplopia , enophthalmos , or procedure - related complications .
studies were excluded if : computer - assisted technology were only used for diagnostic purposes .
orbital reconstruction for non - traumatic ( e.g. post tumor removal ) cases .
outcomes were reported in a qualitative manner .
preoperative or postoperative outcome measurements were inadequate .
search methods for identifying studies we searched medline and embase via the ovid platform , cochrane central register of controlled trials ( central ) , clinicaltrials.gov ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) and world health organization international clinical trials registry platform ( who ictrp ) for any comparative studies .
we used the cochrane highly sensitive search strategy and combined with our search terms16 .
the detailed search strategy can be found in the appendix 1 ( supplementary material ) .
we searched the references of the retrieved full - text articles to identify studies not found by our search strategy .
we did not apply any language restriction .
the final search was performed on february 17 , 2015 for all the databases .
study selection and data collection two reviewers ( khw and kklc ) independently assessed the titles and abstracts .
in case of any unresolved discrepancies , a third reviewer ( aly ) will arbitrate until a mutual conclusion was reached .
we used a customized form to record the authors , year of publication , sample size , duration of follow up , fracture patterns , primary or secondary reconstruction , the modality of computer - assisted technologies used , surgical techniques , implants , and outcome measures .
we collected outcome data at the last follow - up. we used reduction in enophthalmos measured by exophthalmometer in millimeter ( mm ) ; if these data were not available , then the percentage of patients showing enophthalmos at the last follow - up were analyzed .
likewise , we extracted the percentage of patient complaining of diplopia at the last follow - up. number and types of complications were recorded .
risk of bias assessment the quality of the studies was independently evaluated by 2 reviewers ( khw and kklc ) using the cochrane risk of bias tools for rcts17 and the newcastle - ottawa scale for the observational studies18 .
statistical analysis we used the review manager ( revman , version 5.3 ; copenhagen : the nordic cochrane centre , the cochrane collaboration , 2014 ) for our meta - analysis .
we analyzed the statistical heterogeneity of the included studies with the cochrane q - statistics chi - square test and i2 statistic .
if there was any significant heterogeneity between studies ( p < 0.1 ) , a random - effect model was used for pooling the data ; otherwise a fixed - effect model was used .
results we identified 239 titles and abstracts through our literature search and retrieved 12 articles for full text review .
we included 6 studies in this systematic review according to our a priori criteria ( fig. 1 ) 192021222324 .
the prisma checklist and flow diagram can be found in appendices 2 and 3 ( supplementary material ) .
study characteristics table 1 shows the characteristics of the included trials .
we did not identify any randomized controlled trials. of the identified articles , 4 were prospective cohort studies20212223 .
1 was a historical cohort trial19 and 1 was a retrospective cohort study24 .
two studies described isolated orbital floor fracture2224 while the rest had patients involving multiple or different orbital walls .
patients with secondary orbital reconstructions were examined in 2 studies2122 .
table 2 summarizes the details of the 6 included studies .
computer - assisted intra - operative surgical navigation was studied in three studies using non - preformed implants of different materials192021 ; two of which also applied the mio technique during surgical planning1920 .
preformed cad / cam implants using glass - bioceramic or titanium mesh were evaluated in the other 3 studies222324 , which none of these studies used intra - operative navigation device .
quality of included studies tables 3 and 4 summarize the risk of bias assessment of the included studies .
only 1 study used masked outcome assessor and addressed the confounding factors by matching the study and control group for age , sex , fracture pattern , preoperative ophthalmic features , etiology and severity of trauma , surgical approach and types of implant used20 .
the control groups were not comparable in two studies leading to potential bias on treatment effect2224 .
intervention bias was minimized in 2 studies by involving only one surgeon1922 .
all studies had appropriate length of follow up and accounted for missing data .
outcome measures tables 5 and 6 summarize the outcomes of the three studies on intraoperative surgical navigation and the other three on individualized preformed cad / cam implants group , respectively .
four studies reported on postoperative diplopia19202124 .
three of the 4 studies demonstrated statistically significant improvement of diplopia in the computer - assisted group over the control group ( 51 vs 60 % 19 , 2 vs 10 % 20 , 17 vs 88 % 24 ) .
five studies measured changes of enophthalmos2021222324 .
in the computer - assisted group , 3 - 27 % of patients were still enophthalmic at the last follow - up , compared with 10 - 50 % in the control group .
a range of 1.5 - 3.25 mm improvement of enophthalmos was reported in the assisted group , compared to 1.8 - 3.88 mm in the control group .
four of these five studies concluded there was no difference in improving enophthalmos between the study group and the control group20212223 .
only 1 study reported significantly lower percentage of patients with persistent enophthalmos using preformed cad / cam titanium mesh implants as compared to calvarial bone grafts24 .
procedure - related complications were documented in 3 studies19202122 .
in one study , extrusion or infection requiring implant removal , entropion , ectropion and epiphora were observed in the group using computer - assisted intra - operative surgical navigation , whereas implant removal , eyelid abscess , retrobulbar hematoma were encountered in the control19 .
in another study comparing preformed cad / cam glass - bioceramic implants implant with non - preformed titanium meshes , 1 case of reduced vision and 2 cases of suspected retrobulbar hematoma versus 2 cases of suspected retrobulbar hematoma were identified , respectively22 .
one study did not encounter any post - operative complications in either group21 .
the overall complication rates by individual studies were comparable between both groups .
discussion computer assisted surgery ( cas ) ( icd - 9 - cm intervention code 00.3 ) represents surgical concepts and methods utilizing computer technology for preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance .
it includes image - guided navigation ( ign ) and image - guided surgery ( igs ) .
such guidance improves accuracy of surgical gestures and reduces surgeon 's action and effort25 .
this helps to decrease surgical errors and reduce operating time26 .
computer - aided design and computer - aided modeling ( cad / cam ) and rapid prototyping ( rp ) technologies use image - derived data to fabricate custom - made medical guides and implants4 .
the accuracy of cas is affected by the resolution of the imaging data set , the precision of the computer algorithm and the accuracy during data registration using superficial bony and surface landmarks2728 .
facial swelling after acute trauma may limit the accuracy of the registration process but can be overcome using a combination of referencing methods29 .
in patients with unilateral trauma , mirroring the uninjured orbit onto the affected side further improves accuracy926 .
however , mio assumes perfect symmetry while variations do exist between normal orbits30 .
intra - operative navigation provides real - time feedback of anatomical location of the tracking device with respect to preoperative images25 .
locations of and distances to extraocular muscles , infraorbital and optic nerves as well as orbital fissures can be assessed when dissecting through prolapsed orbital soft tissues to minimize iatrogenic injury31 .
surgeons can also confirm the location of implant after placement32 .
individually or industrially preformed cad / cam implants are designed to reproduce the intricate three - dimensional shape of the preinjured orbit for immediate loading .
these implants reduce the time for intraoperative manipulation such as bending , trimming and repetitive fittings4 and minimize surgical trauma to periorbital soft tissues47 .
quality of evidence we did not identify any randomized controlled trials in computer - assisted technology for post - traumatic orbital reconstruction .
results of our systematic review were limited to cohort and case - control studies .
our review highlights the scarcity of relevant literatures .
clinical heterogeneities were present for the severities , location and number of fractures , primary versus secondary reconstruction , timing of surgery and surgical approaches including use of intraoperative navigation , implant types and materials .
methodological heterogeneities due to different type of study designs and operative approaches and clinical heterogeneities due to divergent patient groups limited us from performing meta - analysis .
efficacy and safety three studies reported the number of patients with clinically significant enophthalmos ( difference > 2 mm ) 202124 , while 2 studies provided exophthalmometry measurements2223 .
we were unable to demonstrate any added benefit in correcting enophthalmos with the use of computer - assisted technologies .
in the only study that showed such benefit24 , the authors used pre - fabricated titanium implants in the assisted group versus calvarial bone grafts in control24 .
the main drawbacks of bone graft include difficulty in contouring and variability in resorption27 , while titanium mesh are flexible yet rigid and stable over time333435 .
the differences in implants used may confound the benefit of computer - assisted technologies in improving enophthalmos in this study .
post - traumatic enophthalmos is not only related to orbital volume expansion but also loss of ligamental support , soft tissue atrophy and contracture36 .
however , current paradigm of post - traumatic orbital reconstruction focuses on restoring bony orbital volume and shape , which were found to correlate better with postoperative persistent enophthalmos than soft tissue atrophy in the long run37383931 .
yet the latter may explain why anatomical reduction of the orbital fracture alone does not always guarantee long - term symmetry40 .
soft tissue changes , if any , may be evaluated by systematically comparing magnetic resonance images ( mri ) from both injured and uninjured orbits of surgically and conservatively managed patients41 .
post - traumatic diplopia can be caused by direct nerve or muscle injury causing paralytic strabismus or herniation / entrapment of muscle and / or surrounding connective tissue leading to restrictive strabismus .
our results showed that computer - assisted technology may provide additional improvements in diplopia compared to the conventional surgery .
fewer patients undergoing computer - assisted repair had residual diplopia except those in the study of lauer et al.21 .
in that study , the authors used polydioxanone sheets ( pds ) implants for 75 % and 86 % of cases in the assisted and control group respectively .
large orbital defects (> 2.5 cm2 ) were present in 85 % in the assisted group and 88 % in the control group .
however , previous study showed that pds implant was suitable only for smaller defects (< 2.5 cm2 ) 42 , thus potentially undermining the beneficial effect of intraoperative navigation21 .
we postulate that using computer - assisted technology allows more accurate anatomical restoration with better soft tissues repositioning and less implant impingement , leading to better postoperative motility and less diplopia .
post - operative complications were similar in both groups with no statistical difference .
these complications were inherent to the complexities and surgical approaches rather than the use of computer - assisted technologies .
revisions surgeries are more challenging as scarring occurs over inadequately reduced soft tissues , remaining bone fragments as well as malpositioned implants .
extensive dissection and osteotomies are often necessary and spatial orientation and visualization become more difficult43 .
secondary reconstruction is thus one of the strongest indications in using computer - assisted technologies .
however , the two studies on secondary reconstruction did not show any additional benefit2122 .
recommendations for future studies existing evidence is deemed insufficient to determine the emerging role of computer - assisted technologies .
future randomized trials will have to address important confounders including size and pattern ( e.g. isolated floor versus combined medial wall and floor ) of fracture , timing of repair ( immediate versus delayed ) , types of implant and number of surgeons involved .
it would also be relevant to study its impact among surgeons - in - training and in revision or complicated cases .
extended follow - up will allow evaluation of soft tissue atrophy , fibrosis and contracture on late - onset diplopia and enophthalmos .
finally , direct and indirect costs should be included in future studies .
conclusion to our knowledge , this is the first systematic review on computer - assisted technologies for post - traumatic orbital reconstruction .
results are limited by the paucity of high - quality studies available .
our data suggests advantage in its use for treating diplopia but not enophthalmos .
as attractive and innovative as other new technologies , it is not a prerequisite for good outcomes , particularly in simple cases .
despite the potential to reduce error and subjectivity , it is still far from being routinely used due to the incurred time and cost .
this review highlights the need of carefully - designed , randomized controlled trials in assessing the indications , safety and efficacy , as well as cost utility of computer - assisted technologies in post - traumatic orbital reconstruction .

http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 abstract significant unprotected left main ( lm ) coronary artery disease is frequently associated with severe multivessel disease and increased mortality and morbidity compared with non - lm coronary artery disease .
this study compared the clinical outcomes of patients with lm disease who received percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) with stenting , conventional coronary - artery bypass grafting ( c - cabg ) , and robot - assisted cabg ( r - cabg ) .
this retrospective study analyzed 472 consecutive lm disease patients who underwent three different revascularization approaches at a tertiary medical center between january 2005 and november 2013. of the 472 lm disease patients , 139 received r - cabg , 147 received c - cabg , and 186 received pci .
the need for target vessel revascularization ( tvr ) was highest in the pci group .
the r - cabg group had significantly lower rates of in - hospital and follow - up all - cause deaths compared with the other 2 groups ( 1.4 % vs. 3.4 % and 9.7 % , p = . 0058 ; 13.7 % vs. 29.3 % and 29.6 % , p = . 0023 , respectively ) .
patients in the r - cabg group had significantly lower rates of intra - aortic balloon pump assistance , and shorter duration of icu and total hospital stay compared to patients in the c - cabg group .
however , revascularization modality , syntax scores , and residual syntax scores were not independent predictors of in - hospital or long - term mortality .
in this cohort of lm disease patients treated at a tertiary medical center , pci is a reasonable choice in patients with less lesion complexity but who are older and have comorbidities .
r - cabg is feasible in stable lm disease patients with high syntax scores , and is an effective alternative to c - cabg in lm disease patients with few risk factors .
however , revascularization modality per se was not a determinant for long - term mortality in our real - world practice .
keywords conventional coronary artery bypass graft surgery left main coronary artery disease percutaneous coronary intervention robot - assisted coronary artery bypass graft surgery open - accesstrue 1 introduction significant left main ( lm ) coronary artery disease ( cad ) occurs in 3 % to 9 % of patients undergoing coronary angiography. [ 1,2 ] current guidelines [ 3 - 5 ] recommend coronary artery bypass grafting ( cabg ) as the criterion standard therapy for lm disease .
although percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) has been shown to be an effective alternative for treating lm disease ,[ 6 - 9 ] there has been an increasing focus on minimally invasive endoscopic surgical techniques [ 10 - 14 ] owing to advantages such as minimal operation wound , shorter hospital stay , faster recovery , and similar or even better clinical outcomes with these techniques compared with traditional surgeries .
robot - assisted cabg ( r - cabg ) has been proven to be safe and efficient for treating valvular and congenital heart diseases ,[ 15 - 18 ] as well as for revascularizing simple and complex cad. [ 19 - 22 ] however , to the best of our knowledge , there are currently no data comparing the treatment effects of r - cabg with conventional cabg ( c - cabg ) and pci for lm disease .
the purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcomes in lm patients treated with r - cabg , c - cabg , or pci in real - world practice .
2 methods and materials this retrospective study recruited all consecutive patients with angiographically proven lm disease who underwent either r - cabg , c - cabg , or pci at our institute between january 2005 and november 2013 .
significant lm disease was defined as a > 50 % narrowing of the lumen diameter as determined by angiography .
the choice of revascularization modality was mainly determined by guidelines , but also partially at the discretion of the attending physicians .
as a rule , patients with proven lm disease and complex anatomy were recommended cabg as the first therapy or pci as an alternative therapy if they declined cabg .
patients who chose surgery received either c - cabg or r - cabg depending on comorbidities , personal willingness , and financial status .
the pci , c - cabg , and r - cabg procedures were all carried out following the standard practices at this institute .
briefly , the 3 different revascularization approaches were performed as follows : r - cabg was performed using the da vinci robotic system and under general anesthesia .
for this procedure , the cardiovascular surgeon harvested the left radial artery by endoscopy followed by wound closure , and then the left internal mammary artery ( lima ) inside the chest .
subsequently , pericardiotomy was performed to expose the native coronary arteries through 3 pencil - sized incisions along the left anterior axillary line over 2nd , 4th , and 6th intercostal spaces .
an incision about 2.5 to 3 cm long was then created over the 2nd intercostal space near the sternal bone for the anastomosis of the harvested radial artery and lima grafts in end - to - side fashion .
after this , a hand - sewn off - pump lima - lad anastomosis in end - to - side mode and sequential lima - radial artery - grafts to diagonal artery , left circumflex , or posterior descending artery anastomoses , depending on lesion involvements , were performed via an 8 - cm left anterolateral thoracotomy .
the c - cabg was performed by traditional sternotomy under general anesthesia .
briefly , the cardiovascular surgeon harvested the lima and performed pericardiotomy to expose the coronary arteries via the median sternotomy .
then the surgeon harvested the left radial artery from the left forearm or superficial femoral vein from left femoral thigh as decided by the surgeon .
after that , a hand - sewn lima - lad anastomosis in end - to - side fashion and y - anatomosis of lima - sequential radial artery grafts to diagonal artery , left circumflex obtuse marginal branches or posterior descending artery , depending on lesion involvements , were performed .
the c - cabg procedure was performed on the beating heart or on the arrested heart .
the percutaneous lm intervention was performed by experienced interventional cardiologists in our institute .
the decision on 1 - stent or 2 - stent strategy for lm lesion was made by the operator according to the bifurcation classification , coronary flow of main and side branch , angulation , vessel dominance , and calcification during the index procedure .
the decision of whether to use a drug - eluting stent ( des ) or bare - metal stent ( bms ) for lm pci was also at the operator 's discretion of the operators , and based on the lesion characteristics and the patient 's financial status .
no dedicated bifurcation stent was used , as it was not available in this institute .
the final kissing technique of lm bifurcation post stenting was an essential step on all 2 - stent cases except in those in whom balloon or wire passing failed .
the treatment of all other non - lm lesions also followed the general principle to pursue complete revascularization .
medical records in the hospital database were retrospectively reviewed for the statistical analysis of baseline demographic data , in - hospital and long - term outcomes .
the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board / ethics committee of taichung veterans general hospital , taichung , taiwan .
3 statistical analysis continuous variables are presented as mean +/ - standard deviations if normally distributed or median with interquartile range if not .
categorical variables are presented as numbers and percentages .
the continuous variables were first tested for data distribution by the kolmogorov - smirnov test for each variable in each group .
if the variables were normally distributed , they were analyzed by 1 - way analysis of variance ( anova ) , and , if not normally distributed , by the kruskal - wallis test .
post - hoc analysis was analyzed by dunn - bonferroni test .
categorical variables were analyzed by chi2 test .
a kaplan - meier survival curve was performed for long - term mortality .
logistic and cox regression analyses were used to determine the independent factors associated with in - hospital and long - term follow - up mortalities .
a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
all statistical analyses were performed using spss 19.0 ( spss inc. , chicago , il ) software .

the study population comprised 139 patients who received r - cabg , 147 patients who received c - cabg , and 186 patients who received pci .
the patients who received r - cabg all underwent complete robotic - assisted procedure without any conversion to median sternotomy .
one hundred and fourteen of 147 ( 77.5 %) patients in the c - cabg group underwent bypass surgery on the beating heart , and the radial artery was used for bypass graft in 130 of 147 ( 88.4 %) patients .
in the pci group , 163 of 186 ( 86.7 %) lm lesions were treated using the 2 - stent strategy , and des was used in all these patients. of these 163 patients , the culotte style for 2 - stent strategy was utilized in 150 patients ( 92 %) , the dk crush style was used in 9 patients ( 5.5 %) , and the tap technique was used in 4 patients ( 2.5 %). of the remaining 23 patients treated with the 1 - stent strategy , 10 patients ( 43.5 %) received des , and the others received bms .
the baseline characteristics of all study patients are shown in table 1 .
patients in the r - cabg group were significantly younger , had less acute coronary syndrome ( acs ) , chronic renal disease ( ckd ) , cardiogenic shock , lower serum creatinine and hemoglobin , and higher left ventricular ejection fraction ( lvef ) as compared with the other 2 groups .
patients in the pci group patients were significantly older , had lower syntax and residual syntax scores , and had a greater prevalence of previous pci and cabg history compared to the other groups .

the total death rate in the r - cabg group was significantly lower compared to the c - cabg and pci groups .
a kaplan - meier survival curve was used to analyze survival outcomes in the 3 groups ( fig. 2 ) .
the r - cabg group had significantly better outcomes than those of the other 2 groups , whereas there was no difference in outcomes between the c - cabg and pci groups .

4.3 clinical predictors for in - hospital and long - term mortality in all lm disease patients univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify clinical predictors for in - hospital and long - term mortalities in lm disease patients who underwent different revascularizations ( tables 3 and 4 ) .
multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that statin therapy and ckd were independent predictors of in - hospital mortality , whereas multivariate cox regression analysis showed that age , diabetes mellitus ( dm ) , lvef , statin therapy , and ckd were independent predictors of long - term mortality .
however , the revascularization modality per se was not an independent predictor for either in - hospital or long - term survival in our patient cohort .
neither syntax score nor residual syntax score was found to be independent risk factors for mortality in our cohort .

5 discussion to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to compare short - and long - term clinical outcomes of r - cabg , c - cabg , and pci in the real - world treatment of lm disease .
the main findings of the present study were that : pci was associated with long - term survival equivalent to that of c - cabg , but had a higher tvr than r - cabg and c - cabg ; r - cabg is feasible in high - syntax score lm disease patients , which showed a better unadjusted long - term survival than c - cabg or pci , but this could be attributed to fewer baseline comorbidities in this cohort ; statin therapy and ckd were found to be independently associated with in - hospital mortality , whereas age , dm , lvef , statin therapy , and ckd were independent predictors of long - term survival .
however , the revascularization modality ( operation type ) per se was not an independent predictor for mortality in the present cohort .
significant unprotected lm is regarded as the most prognostically important coronary lesion because it is frequently associated with severe multivessel disease and increased mortality and morbidity compared with non - lm coronary artery disease .
age , lvef , dm , dyslipidemia , ckd , and clinical presentation of acs have been shown to be poor predictors of mortality in patients with lm disease. [ 23,24 ] recent studies [ 6 - 9 ] have shown that pci might be a valid alternative for treating lm disease in the des era , especially for patients with simple lm lesions , or in the acute setting. [ 25,26 ] however , the risks of tvr and tlr were consistently higher in patients treated with pci compared to the cabg group .
recently , the syntax score has been suggested to be a useful parameter in predicting clinical outcomes of lm disease patients undergoing revascularization. [ 27,28 ] the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events ( macce ) was higher in the pci group when the syntax score was > 33 , and this was mostly driven by a higher need for revascularization ,[ 7,9,29 ] although the death rate did not differ .
this finding was substantiated by the latest excel study ,[ 30 ] whose findings were consistent with the results of the c - cabg and pci groups in our present real - world study .
in our current retrospective study , pci was found to be associated with higher tvr compared to the c - cabg group , but in - hospital and long - term survival rates in the 2 groups were similar .
the similarity in survival could be because of the lower syntax score and less diseased cad vessel numbers in the pci group .
however , pci group patients were significantly older , had higher prevalence of previous pci , cabg history , and higher serum creatinine , which might have offset the advantage of lower syntax score at study entry .
our pci practice was consistent with the guidelines , favoring patients with less lesion complexity , but who were older and had more comorbidities .
our findings suggested that pci remains a good choice for selected patients with lm diseases. with innovations in surgical devices and techniques , open - wound surgeries have gradually been replaced by endoscopic techniques in recent decades , as these are associated with shorter icu and total hospital stays , lower blood transfusion requirements , less postoperative complications , and better post - operative quality of life .
robot - assisted surgery has been proven to be effective , efficacious , and has increasingly been used during the past few decades. [ 10 - 14 ] in the field of cardiovascular treatment , the desire for a minimally invasive method of revascularizing the heart has also led to the widespread use of pci even though in complex cases of cad , cabg has been shown to be more efficacious , with lower rates of mortality , mi , and reintervention in mid - and long - term follow - up. during the past 2 decades , there has been a significant increase worldwide in the use of robot - assisted cardiovascular surgery using the da vinci system , which combines the advantages of 2 revascularization methods to provide smaller wounds , less rib retraction , reduction in pain , and faster return to normal activities with a positive impact on the quality of life ,[ 20,31 ] in patients with congenital [ 17,18 ] and valvular heart diseases , [ 15,16 ] and cad. [ 19 - 22 ] however , r - cabg was mostly used for treating simple but not complex cad because it is more time - consuming and technically demanding than c - cabg .
currie et al [ 20 ] reported comparable long - term graft patency rates and quality of life in patients treated with r - cabg compared with those treated with c - cabg .
however , their patients were younger , and had lower co - morbidities , and mostly had single vessel disease .
cavallaro et al [ 22 ] evaluated a large cohort of patients from a national database and found that r - cabg was most often performed in cases with a single cabg graft , more stable background condition , a lower numbers of co - morbidities , and lower postoperative complication rates compared to c - cabg .
moreover , r - cabg was considered to be an effective alternative for treating isolated left anterior descending artery lesions alone or as a hybrid revascularization in combination with pci with good short - term clinical and angiographic results. [ 19 ] our current study also showed that r - cabg was used mostly in patients with stable cad or fewer comorbidities ( higher lvef , less cardiogenic shock , and better renal function ) .
however , 42.6 % of r - cabg was done in patients presenting with acs , a median of 3 diseased coronary arteries , and a median syntax score of 35 at our institute .
the good outcomes seen in these patients suggested that in contrast with earlier reports ,[ 20,21 ] r - cabg was feasible in patients with complex and advanced lesions .
in our patient cohort , r - cabg generated a better unadjusted in - hospital and long - term survival than either c - cabg or pci , shorter hospital stay than c - cabg , and less tvr than pci .
however , the better outcomes might be attributed to more stable patient status and fewer background comorbidities at entry .
multivariate analysis ruled out revascularization modality per se as an independent predictor for long - term mortality .
based on our data showing that r - cabg could significantly shorten the duration of icu , and total hospital stay and minimize postoperative patient discomfort and care , we suggested that r - cabg is an effective and efficient alternative for surgically revascularizing high syntax score patients beyond the c - cabg .
residual syntax score ( rss ) and the term of incomplete revascularization after coronary revascularization were found to be associated with adverse outcomes ,[ 32 - 34 ] with rss >= 8 predicting all - cause mortality , revascularization , and stent thrombosis .
the rss in our r - cabg patients was comparable with that in the syntax study , arguing the good results could be reproduced by the much less invasive r - cabg in real - world practice .
however , the rss in our pci patients was significantly lower than those of c - cabg or r - cabg patients .
however , this could be because of lower ss at the baseline .
furthermore , our multivariable analysis ruled out either baseline or residual ss as a predictor of mortality .
in conclusion , in this cohort of lm disease patients treated at a tertiary medical center , patients who underwent pci had more revascularization during follow - up , but similar in - hospital and follow - up mortalities compared to those underwent c - cabg .
r - cabg is feasible in stable patients with high - syntax score lm disease and could be an effective and efficient alternative for revascularizing these patients with less background risk factors .
5.1 study limitations this study had some important limitations .
first , this was an observational , retrospective , and nonrandomized study , and therefore subject to all the limitations inherent in the study design .
second , the choice or assignment of revascularization modality in the present study was based on the attending physician 's recommendation , the patient 's and family 's choice and their financial capability , rather than random assignment .
thus , there were significant differences in comorbidities between the groups at the study entry .
however , our study tried to correct for these by performing multivariate cox regression analysis .
as r - cabg demands special patient requirements and pci is suitable for less complex lesions , we think our study population and design reflected real - world practice , and thus our conclusions are relevant to the general clinical settings .
however , the study population in each group of our study was relatively small in size .
our study conclusions should be confirmed with larger randomized trials to better define the long - term outcomes of r - cabg compared with c - cabg and pci in patients with lm disease .

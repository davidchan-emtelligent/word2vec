background a rare phenotype of clinical non - progressors to aids is not well understood and the new protocol for universal treatment , may block the understanding of viral control thus it is crucial to define this controversial group .
methods a cohort of 30 persons followed a criteria for viremia control groups 1 ( vc1 ; n = 2 ) and 2 ( vc2 ; n = 7 ) and non - viral controllers ( nc ; n = 21 ) including number of years of diagnosis , ltcd4 + , ltcd8 + counts , plasma viral load and the absence of art ; 241 uninfected control persons were matched to age and sex .
infected persons were regularly examined and submitted to two or three annual laboratory measurements .
polymorphisms and allele frequencies of ccr5delta32 and sdf1 - 3'a were detected in the genomic dna .
plasma levels of cytokines ( il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 5 , il - 9 , il - 10 , il - 13 , il - 17 and ifn - y ) were measured .
results the group investigated is originated from a miscigenetic population and demographic and social characteristics were not significantly relevant .
ltcd4 + median values were higher among vc than nc , but significantly lower than uninfected controls .
evolution of ltcd4 + and ltcd8 + counts , showed a slight increase of ltcd4 + among vc , but a significant decrease in the nc. the percentage of annual change in ltcd4 + was also significantly different between the groups .
ltcd4 +/ ltcd8 + ratio was inverted but not significant among the vc , thus the ratio may be a useful biomarker for the vc. a clear signature indicated a change from th1 to th2 cytokine profiles from vc to nc , respectively .
conclusions the knowledge of viral controllers characteristics in different population groups is important to define a strict universal definition for the sake of learning about the pathogenesis of hiv - 1 .
data on ltcd4 + seems to be stable and repetitive from published data , but the ltcd8 + response and the significance of ltcd4 +/ ltcd8 + ratio values are in need to further exploration as biomarkers .
the change from th1 to th2 cytokine profile may help to design and adjust specific treatment protocols for the group .

the use of different protocols which should be strictly followed to treat the viral infection ( antiretroviral therapy , art ) , made it possible to interfere in the process , although sometimes with several nasty side effects of the therapeutical drugs used [ 3 , 4 ] .
the suggestions of clinical and laboratory evidences that a small number of hiv - 1 infected persons could be able to naturally control the virus without the use of anti - retroviral therapy , opened a window of hope to millions of persons carrying the enormous burden of a deadly infection [ 5 - 7 ] .
a new phenotype of hiv - 1 carriers , the long term non - progressor , elite controller or viral controller , among others , define a group of hiv - 1 infected persons who could naturally maintain viral replication under control and the absence of precipitating events which could lead to aids [ 8 - 11 ] .
the definition of viral controller and , particularly , elite controller , is not equally defined and there is no universal consensus as can be seen in the several different proposals [ 10 , 12 - 14 ] .
the suggestion of the possibility of hiv - 1 eradication or the maintenance of a host who would be non infectious , is a bold proposal considering the retrospective and accumulated knowledge in virus strategies of replication , adaptation to the host and perpetuation together with the infected host [ 15 - 17 ] .
there was a recent change in the time to start treatment of infected persons as soon as the infection is diagnosed which was also adopted in brazil [ 18 ] .
the recent evidences of three large and well conducted studies ( hptn 052 , temprano and start ) , were sufficiently strong to support the change , once more , in the usual protocol which define the starting point to treatment [ 19 - 21 ] .
the " test and treat " approach may lead to a difficulty to recognize those patients who are able to maintain the virus under natural control and make it impossible to learn how the process can be attained .
here we present the characterization of the human model currently described in the city of belem , para ( northern brazil ) , in order to provide additional criteria to turn the definition of this controversial point of discussion even more strict and to start collaborative studies in the country , aiming to better understand this phenotype of viral controllers .
it is important to tighten the characterization of the subjects in order to make sure we can really believe in the control and a possible future cure of hiv - 1 infection .
methods criteria to define the groups involved the classification criteria for the viremia control 1 and 2 ( vc1 and vc2 ) , and the non - viral controller ( nc ) groups , used information related to the number of years of known diagnosis , ltcd4 + and ltcd8 + counts and plasma viral load quantification are described in table 1 .
it is important to emphasize that all persons were aware of their status of hiv - 1 carriers for 6 years or more and were clinically and laboratory followed with their measurements of ltcd4 + , ltcd8 + and plasma viral load at least twice a year .
all of the three groups were treatment naive and the start of art at any time during the period of observation was the only exclusion criteria .
the initial ltcd4 + , ltcd8 + counts and their rate were considered to be the baseline values ; the latest was the last value recorded during the period of observation ( from january 2007 to december 2013 ) .

to each person investigated , there was a group of seven to nine uninfected match controls , regarding sex and age ( range of 5 years up or down ) of regular blood donors from the fundacao hemopa .
to the vc1 there were 19 persons ( nine women and ten men ) , to vc2 , 55 ( 20 women and 35 men ) and nc , 167 ( 91 women and 76 men ) controls .
the composition of the cohort according to sex and age is described in table 2 .

viral load was initially measured using branched dna methodology ( bdna - bayer corporation , massachusetts , usa ) and presently uses a real time pcr methodology ( abbott molecular , usa ) ; in both the limit of detection was 50 copies / ml. lymphocyte measurements were performed using flow citometry ( becton - dickson , usa ) .
both methods followed the manufacturer 's recommendation .
polymorphisms of ccr5delta32 and sdf1 - 3'a genomic dna was purified from peripheral blood cells using a commercial kit ( qiaamp dna mini kit , qiagen , germany ) .
the genotypes of ccr5delta32 and sdf1 - 3'a were determined as previously described [ 22 , 23 ] .
forward and reverse primers were : f - 5'gtcttcattacacctgcagctct - 3 ' and r - 5 ' - cacagccctgtgcctctt - 3 ' for ccr5delta32 , f - 5'cagtcaacctgggcaaagcc - 3 ' and r - 3 ' - agctttggtcctgagagtcc - 5 for sdf1 - 3'a. the amplification of the wild type allele of ccr5 yields a product of 189 bp , while the mutant allele ( ccr5increment32 ) yields a shorter one ( 157 bp ) .
amplification products of sdf1 - 3 ' ( 302 bp ) were digested with restriction endonuclease mspi 5 u ( new england biolabs ) , for 3 hours at 37 degreesc .
in the presence of allele 3'a the product is not cleaved resulting in a fragment of 302 bp , but in the absence of the mutation , the fragment is cleaved in two pieces ( 202 and 100 bp ) .
the amplified and digested products were seen following electrophoresis ( 100 v / 45 min ) in a 3 % agarose gel with sybr safe , diluted in tae 1x , using a transilluminator with an ultraviolet light .
cytokine measurements plasma levels of eight cytokines ( il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 5 , il - 9 , il - 10 , il - 13 , il - 17 and ifn - gamma ) were measured using luminex ( r ) xmap ( r ) in a multiplex assay ( th1 / th2 / th17 human magnetic 8 - plex panel for luminex ( tm ) platform 200 , invitrogen ( tm ) , usa ) according to the manufacture 's recommendation and read on a luminex plataform .
statistical analysis statistical analysis were performed using two softwares , graphpad prism , version 5.0 and bioestat , 5.3 [ 24 ] .
the association of the groups and sexual behavior was performed using the g test .
construction of the figures used median values and interquartile range .
all of the available counts for each person during the period of study were used for the comparisons .
the mann - whitney test was used to compare counts of ltcd4 + , ltcd8 + and their ratios among the groups involved .
significance between first and last counts of ltcd4 + , ltcd8 + and their ratio was performed using the wilcoxon test .
the median yearly change in absolute counts of ltcd4 + , ltcd8 + and their ratio was calculated by the compound annual growth rate ( cagr ) as previously described [ 17 ] .
the differences of cagr between the groups were measured by the mann - whitney test .
chi - square and residue analysis were used to evaluate the association of plasma viral load of hiv - 1 between vc and nc groups .
the polymorphisms and allele frequencies were compared using the g test .
the differences of cytokine levels were performed using the mann - whitney test .
significance was assumed at the level of 0.05 for all the statistical methods used .
results the age of the persons investigated in the present study , ranged from 24 to 68 years .
the group included equal numbers of persons from both sexes and the majority ( 70 % ; 21 / 30 ) referred to be single ( table 3 ) .
most of the persons ( 70 %) informed to be heterosexual who make use of non - injecting drugs ( 53.3 % ; 16 / 30 ) .
although they did not mention sexual relations with persons who have multiple sexual partners ( 93.3 % ; 28 / 30 ) , 46.7 % ( 14 / 30 ) referred to have had sexual relations with hiv - 1 infected persons , 56.7 % ( 16 / 30 ) do not use condoms and 51.8 % ( 14 / 27 ) perform anal sex .
none of the involved persons was infected either with hbv or hcv .
the individuals in groups vc1 and vc2 , referred no promiscuity and no anal sexual relations .
none of the above demographic or social characteristics showed a significant statistical level of importance .

the percentage of annual change in ltcd4 + was also significantly different between the two groups ( fig. 3c ) .
no difference was observed measuring ltcd8 + counts or estimating their annual change ( fig. 3b and d ) .
ltcd4 +/ ltcd8 + ratio decreased with time .
the inversion of the ratio was not significant among the vc , but significant among the nc , despite there was no significance of their annual change in either group ( fig. 4a and b ). fig. 3 evolution of ltcd4 + and ltcd8 + cell counts among viral controller and non - viral controller groups .

sdf1 - 3'a polymorphisms were present in hetero and homozygosis among the three groups .
no statistical significance was observed either when comparing genotypes or allele frequencies of the three groups .
ltcd4 + and ltcd8 + counts were compared according to the ccr5increment32 - and sdf1 - 3'a polymorphisms .
wild type alleles ( fig. 5a and c ) showed median values of ltcd4 + > 500 lymphocytes / mul up to 6 years after the initial diagnosis of infection , but in the presence of the allele 3'a the values were consistently lower , during the period of observation ; in 36 % of the measurements , they were < 350 lymphocytes / mul .
ltcd8 + median counts ( fig. 5b and d ) were consistently < 1000 lymphocytes / mul along the years and no significant difference was observed , despite the presence of either allele ; it is relevant to mention that counts < 600 lymphocytes / mul , were more commonly seen ( 24 %) among those with the 3'a allele than among those with the wild type ( 8 %) .

all the others were higher in the nc group , although only il - 4 was significantly different ( p = 0.0362 ) .
the comparison of th1 ( ifn - gamma e il - 2 ) and th2 ( il - 4 , il - 5 , il - 10 , il - 13 ) cytokines between the two groups ( fig. 6b and c ) , showed that il - 2 was present in low concentrations in both groups .
however , among the nc , there was a clear statistical significance of th1 and th2 cytokine profiles , with a higher concentration of th2. fig. 6 plasma concentration and comparison of th1 and th2 cytokines in the groups investigated .
plasma concentration of cytokines among the vc and nc groups ( a ) and the comparison of th1 and th2 cytokines in the two groups ( b and c ) discussion since the 1990s , a new group of hiv - 1 infected persons was detected and they raised new possibilities regarding the outcome of an infection , which was thought to be always fatal [ 25 ] .
viremia controllers were initially seen as the natural result of the evolution of host / agent interaction , although a few decades have elapsed since the recognition of the virus and its severe consequences to the human host [ 23 ] .
virus evolution and host genetic selection would fit the idea that a new human specific group could control the virus replication without disease development .
understanding the host behavior , the immunological response , genetic characteristics and virus pathogenesis , would certainly help understand how to improve the outcome of newly infected persons and possibly vaccine production [ 26 , 27 ] .
the present information is the first approach to characterize viral controllers in the north of the amazon region and similar publications in the country are sparse .
demographic informations from the persons investigated were not relevant for their characterization as they were not different from the persons involved in the general epidemic of hiv - 1 and aids elsewhere in the country .
similar results have been observed in other geographical settings regarding the demographics of viral controllers without statistical significance [ 28 ] .
the importance of the similarity of the data is of relevance as the population group investigated , is highly miscigenetic [ 29 ] , contrary to other groups .
the number of hiv - 1 viral replication controllers is extremely low anywhere and their detection is a difficult task during the routine clinical approach .
the use of statistical methods commonly used in epidemiology when dealing with rare events , was a strong statistical support , which corrected and balanced the low numbers of persons by using all the available measurements of tcd4 + , tcd8 + and vl , along the observation period , and improved the statistical analysis of the numbers presented .
vc1 did not show any detectable level of viral multiplication , but vc2 showed blips measured by the plasma viral load ( in agreement with their definition in table 1 ) , which were controlled without the use of art .
it was remarkable to see that the group was able to recover from viral loads up to 10,000 copies , but this is not quite different from definitions [ 30 ] which include a limit of 2000 copies ( log10 = 3,3010 ) .
the peak of higher viral loads was more frequently seen in nc as expected .
the persistence of the virus in the lymphatics acts as a constant repository for the virus from these reservoir tissues [ 31 ] .
it is quite certain that the virus is in continuous replication , even among vc1 [ 16 , 17 , 32 , 33 ] and it would certainly cause a decline in ltcd4 + , which was not seen in our vc groups .
cure agendas can not ignore that the groups are different and should be addressed differently in the present suggestions for " test and treat " .
the main point of interest is of how long should one go on waiting to consider a person as a viral controller ?
this is a controversial point [ 14 ] and should be addressed with priority .
levels of ltcd4 + were consistently high , along the observation period among the viral controllers and the evolution of the counts showed no decrease , contrary to what has been described [ 17 ] .
absolute and relative counts of ltcd4 + , were commonly used as predictors of disease progression and the recovery of cell counts after art , a highly relevant variable to monitor the clinical outcome of hiv - 1 infected persons [ 34 - 37 ] .
the overall annual change in their values along the observation period was not significant , although it was not possible to measure whether the lymphocytes were fully functional or abnormally activated .
they should still be useful markers even in the present protocol of art .
ltcd8 + counts were also kept higher and did not change their levels during the observation period in the vc and nc groups .
they were constantly stimulated which led to values quite higher than the uninfected controls and did not change along the years .
it is still not completely understood the interaction of ltcd8 + in the pathogenesis of hiv - 1 , thus it is fair to think in the increase of the immunological response based in ltcd8 + , both to protect and to change the outcome of the disease [ 38 - 40 ] .
a recent report showed that hiv suppressive activity mediated by cd8 + t lymphocytes in vitro was significantly greater among vc than nc cells , with a significant correlation between the suppressive activity and the plasma viral load [ 41 ] .
it is a regular activity of ltcd8 + to keep adequate levels of ifn - gamma , an important cytokine in the arrest of viral multiplication , both during the innate immunological response ( by natural killer t cells ) and by ltcd8 + cytotoxic cells [ 8 , 15 , 42 , 43 ] .
" non - aids related events " , involving chronic disorders of the cns , the cardiovascular system and cancers are frequently described [ 44 , 45 ] .
atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease , are commonly observed in an earlier age among hiv - 1 carriers and no relevant clinical signs are readily detected by the patient or the attending physician .
the inversion of ltcd4 +/ ltcd8 + ratio values , is in direct association with the progress towards aids and non - aids related events and when the inversion is sharp ( below 0.5 ) , this simple measurable variable becomes a good biomarker of mortality by other causes than aids [ 46 - 48 ] and an apparently reliable marker to trace early heart disease among infected persons virally suppressed under art [ 49 ] .
our results showed that the groups have a clear inversion of the ratio , although in a more subtle level among the viral controllers ( vc1 and vc2 ) .
the marker did not change with time and the general health of the persons was apparently good .
if there is a possibility of using the ratio as a biomarker , it will certainly require the definition of a cut off to establish an appropriate moment to start looking for other chronic disorders among non - controllers and the adequate moment to intervene with viral controllers as well .
apparently , there is no other published similar result considering the long term decline of ltcd4 +/ ltcd8 + ratio among viral controllers , but for the period of observation in the present study , the decrease in the inversion of the ratio was not enough to be significant in the vc group .
the presence of ccr5increment32 and sdf1 - 3'a polymorphisms could not be associated to a better response against virus multiplication and control by the host , but the number of persons involved in the present study clearly did not allow an appropriate statistical evaluation .
our previous data showed that these polymorphisms are not usual among hiv - 1 infected persons in the north region of the country [ 50 ] .
although some polymorphisms are strongly associated with viral controllers , hla subtypes were also not associated with differences in the cytokines and chemokines production between elite controllers and viremic controllers regarding the frequencies of the alleles b27 or b57 [ 17 , 33 ] , contrary to what is generally accepted [ 26 , 51 - 54 ] .
in the present study , the evolution in the counts of ltcd4 + and ltcd8 + were not influenced by both polymorphisms .
larger studies will be necessary to confirm or not the influence of the allele 3'a in the low counts of ltcd4 + and ltcd8 + .
despite the absence of statistical significance there is an indication for the possible involvement of m - tropic , using ccr5 related co - receptors and t - tropic isolates , using cxcr4 [ 55 , 56 ] .
most of these studies with polymorphisms were performed using samples from non - viral controllers with a regular progression to aids ; viral controllers are still poorly understood regarding these and other polymorphisms .
ifn - gamma was the sole cytokine presenting a higher level in the vc group .
the relevance of ifn - gamma resides in its ability to inhibit viral replication .
the maintenance of regular levels of this cytokine is a possible consequence of ltcd8 + activity .
these cells have an important role in the expression of ifn - gamma both in the innate immunological response ( by natural killer t cells ) and by cd8 + cytotoxic t lymphocytes once antigen - specific immunity develops [ 8 , 42 ] .
ifn - gamma is also an inducer of inflammatory chemokines ( mig and ip - 10 ) which are responsible for the recruitment of leucocytes to the inflammation site and act in the chronic immune activation [ 56 - 58 ] .
comparisons have been drawn among different groups .
the chemokines were described in lower levels among elite controllers ( named vc1 in the present study ) in comparison to other groups capable of viral replication control without art ( named as vc2 group ) , hiv - 1 negative volunteers and hiv - 1 persons under art , but it was coherently raised among those regular progressors [ 10 , 12 , 17 ] .
it was not possible to show in our work 7or in any other , the extension of the inflammatory response , and considering the low levels , ifn - gamma is probably more involved with control of viral replication , as we are dealing with a persistent and active viral infection .
most of the time it is shown that ltcd8 + producing ifn - gamma are weak responders among the vc and their levels of production gradually increases among regular progressors under art [ 31 , 53 , 59 ] .
inflammation markers are a common finding [ 60 , 61 ] in the cases of treatment interruptions and the objectives of art with the new protocol intend to suppress virus multiplication , prevent inflammation and provide an effective immune response .
th1 and th2 cytokine profile between the vc and nc groups , made it possible to observe the higher plasma concentration of th2 cytokines in the nc group and th1 cytokines in the vc. the immune response centered in th1 cytokines reflects a non - progressive hiv - 1 disease , but it may indicate a probable helper protection against hiv - 1 infection promoting phagocytosis , stimulating nk cells , t lymphocytes and a consequent elimination of the virus , suggesting a low grade inflammation , persistence and low level viral replication .
the exacerbation of th2 cytokine profile leading to an increased humoral response , is not sufficient for the containment of intracellular infectious agents , contributing to viral multiplication and a faster progression to aids [ 62 - 64 ] .
the down regulatory effect of il - 10 on th1 cytokines was not evident among vc ; indeed , the shift observed here from th1 to th2 cytokines is related to progression of hiv - 1 disease .
igg antibody response to hiv - 1 gradually increases from viral controllers to non - viral controllers [ 33 , 39 , 65 - 67 ] which is in clear agreement with this th1 to th2 signature change presented here .
our results point to a distinct hypothesis proposed [ 17 , 68 ] who associate the aids progression to the continuous inflammatory environment .
it is possible to suggest that an equilibrium of the cytokine th1 synthesis , especially the ifn - y , could be more favorable to the vc regarding the activation of the cellular immune response , an important step against to impair viral replication .
numerous comparisons have been drawn among the different groups , including elite controllers , viremia controllers , hiv - 1 progressors ( successfully being treated or not ) and hiv - 1 negative volunteers [ 10 , 12 , 17 ] , but the definition of viral controllers was not consistent in the past [ 25 , 69 , 70 ] and it continues in the present .
the description of this new and rare phenotype of hiv - 1 infected persons , so far , has not elicited a successful characterization of the group and a large number of proposed definitions continue to impair a better understanding not only of the real prevalence numbers of the controllers , but also , of the biological mechanisms involved in the control of the virus , including those so called elite controllers [ 7 - 10 , 12 , 14 , 71 - 75 ] .
the recent suggestion for a new art protocol [ 19 - 21 ] , is also making us face a continuous and worrying increase in the adoption of the protocol to treat as soon as one discover his / her status of hiv - 1 infection [ 37 ] .
this will also soon hide all the chances to understand how the infection is modulated by the host in such a rare and special situation .
adherence to rigid criteria in the definition of viral controllers is still not attainable .
the variables considered and the values taken into consideration with each of the groups , is far from a consensus .
laboratory variables , including immunological and virological ones , time of known infection , time of maintenance of virus under replicative control and decrease of host cell destruction in the absence of art , should be more strictly followed .
it is not possible to continuously face self - adequate , home made , laboratory , institution or country definitions for viral controller or elite controllers .
it is relevant to mention that the conclusion of a large cohort study indicates that interruption of art started at the early stages of infection is apparently not detrimental to treatment in the chronic phase of the disease [ 76 ] .
conclusions the knowledge of viral controller characteristics in different population groups , including genetic background , is important to define an strict universal definition for the sake of learning about the pathogenesis of hiv - 1 .
it is required to adhere to long periods of observation without art , regular counts of ltcd4 + and ltcd8 + and undetected viremia .
this will be the only possible way to compare such important information in order to understand the mechanisms which lead to the control of viral replication .
data on ltcd4 + seems to be stable and repetitive from published data , but the ltcd8 + response and the significance of ltcd4 +/ ltcd8 + ratio values are in need to further exploration as biomarkers .
the change from th1 to th2 cytokine profile may help to design and adjust specific treatment protocols for the group .

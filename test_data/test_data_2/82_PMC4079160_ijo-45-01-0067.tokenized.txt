head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( hnscc ) patients with human papillomavirus ( hpv ) infection have better prognosis than those without hpv infection .
although p16ink4a expression is used as a surrogate marker for hpv infection , there is controversy as to whether p16ink4a reliably indicates hpv infection .
here , to evaluate the accuracy of p16ink4a expression for determining hpv infection and the prognostic value of hpv infection and p16ink4a expression for hnscc survival , especially oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( opscc ) survival , 150 fresh - frozen hnscc samples were analyzed for hpv dna , e6 / e7 mrna and p16ink4a expression by polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry .
p16ink4a expression was scored from 0 to 4 according to the percentage of p16ink4a - positive cells , with overexpression defined as > 40 % positive cells. of the 150 tumor samples tested , 10 tumors were nasopharyngeal , 53 oropharyngeal , 39 hypopharyngeal , 24 laryngeal and 24 were located in the oral cavity .
hpv dna was detected in 47 ( 31.3 %) samples , but only 21 also exhibited hpv mrna expression .
inter - rater agreement was low between p16ink4a expression and hpv dna presence and between p16ink4a expression and hpv mrna expression , but was good between the combination of hpv dna status and p16ink4a overexpression and hpv mrna expression .
three - year recurrence - free survival was significantly higher for opscc patients who were hpv dna - positive than for opscc patients who were hpv dna - negative ( p = 0.008 ) and for opscc patients over - expressing p16ink4a than for without overexpressing p16ink4a ( p = 0.034 ) .
multivariate analysis revealed that t1 - 3 stage and the combination of hpv dna positivity and p16ink4a overexpression predicted significantly better recurrence - free survival .
this combination is a more accurate marker for active hpv infection in hnscc than hpv dna status or general p16ink4a - positive status alone and offers a useful and reliable method for detecting and determining the prognosis of hpv - related hnscc .
head and neck cancer human papillomavirus hpv e6 e7 mrna p16ink4a prognosis introduction each year , 600,000 new cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( hnscc ) are diagnosed worldwide ( 1 ) .
common risk factors for most forms of hnscc include heavy consumption of tobacco and / or alcohol ( 2 ) , although the oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( opscc ) is less likely to be associated with tobacco and alcohol exposure and more often correlated with human papillomavirus ( hpv ) infection ( 3 ) .
the incidence of opscc associated with hpv infection is increasing ; for example , among cases of tonsillar cancer in stockholm , hpv - positive cases rose from 23 % in the 1970s to 57 % in the 1990s and 79 % from 2000 to 2007 ( 4 ) .
moreover , alongside tobacco and alcohol , high - risk hpv variants ( hr - hpvs ) have emerged as risk factor for hnscc , including opscc ( 5 ) .
hnscc patients who are hpv positive have substantially better prognosis than those who are hpv negative ( 6 - 10 ) .
although the detection of e6 / e7 mrna transcripts is regarded as the gold standard for the presence of clinically relevant ( active ) hpv ( 11 ) , the requirement of unfixed ( fresh frozen ) tissue and the cost of polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) make direct detection of e6 / e7 impractical for cancer diagnostics at present .
accordingly , many studies have attempted to identify an easily measured surrogate maker for the diagnosis of hpv - associated hnscc .
expression of the tumor suppressor p16ink4a has been proposed as a surrogate marker for hpv infection : its over - expression is thought to reflect the presence of biologically active hpv infection given that functional inactivation of prb by viral e7 induces p16ink4a upregulation .
detection of p16ink4a expression can also be performed using formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded ( ffpe ) samples ( 11 - 13 ) .
however , there is controversy as to whether p16ink4a expression reliably indicates hpv infection ( 11,12 ) .
klaes et al classified p16ink4a staining as negative (< 1 % of cells positive ) , sporadic (< 5 % of cells positive ) , focal (< 25 % of cells positive ) or diffuse (> 25 % of cells positive ) ( 14 ) .
other studies have defined p16ink4a expression in tumors as strong and diffuse when >= 70 % of cells ( cytoplasm and nuclei ) are stained ( 15 - 17 ) , while fischer et al assessed tumors as p16ink4a positive when >= 5 % of cells were immunopositive ( 18 ) .
these diverse scoring systems may lead to significant discrepancies across studies in the relationship between hpv infection and p16ink4a expression .
furthermore , p16ink4a expression has been observed in tumor - free tonsillar tissue without hpv infection , implicating other mechanisms in p16ink4a upregulation ( 19 ) .
bussu et al concluded that it is unnecessary to measure a surrogate , such as p16ink4a expression , for objective , reliable , and direct diagnosis because hpv nucleic acids can be detected by pcr without requiring subjective assessments by histopathologists ( 17 ) .
in this study , we evaluated the relationship between hpv infection and p16ink4a expression and the value of both hpv - positive status and p16ink4a expression levels for hnscc prognosis using tissue samples from a well - characterized cohort of japanese patients with hnscc receiving curative treatment .
we measured the presence of hpv dna , hpv e6 / e7 mrna expression using fresh - frozen samples and measured p16ink4a expression using ffpe samples .
materials and methods subjects and study design the eligibility criteria for this study were as follows : the presence of previously untreated , pathologically confirmed primary hnscc without distant metastasis ( m0 ) ; receiving curative treatment of surgery alone , surgery combined with radiation therapy ( rt ) or chemoradiotherapy ( crt ) , concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( ccrt ) or rt alone with > 66 gy of total dosage ; and complete remission after primary treatment .
the treatment modalities were determined according to tumor location , tumor stage , response to induction chemotherapy , and general physical condition , not by the results of hpv status and p16ink4a in tumor tissue .
based on these criteria , 150 patients treated by the department of otorhinolaryngology , head and neck surgery , university of the ryukyus , japan were recruited between october 2006 and june 2013 .
in contrast to our previous study on hpv status and squamous cell carcinoma antigen ( scca ) , this study involved a greater total number of cases who met the inclusion criteria and we also updated the prognostic information of some of the patients reported previously ( 8 ) .
each patient gave written informed consent before enrolment .
the research protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the university of the ryukyus .
tissue samples were snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen during biopsy or surgical excision and stored in liquid nitrogen until further analysis .
demographic and clinicopathologic parameters for each patient were collected at scheduled intervals during the follow - up period .
cell lines and culture the cervical cancer cell lines caski ( harboring ~ 600 copies of integrated hpv - 16 dna / genome ) and siha ( 1 - 2 copies of integrated hpv - 16 dna / genome ) were purchased from the european collection of animal cell cultures ( salisbury , uk ) and the american type culture collection ( tokyo , japan ) , respectively , and cultured according to the suppliers' instructions .
dna and rna extraction genomic dna and total rna were extracted from frozen tumor samples , siha cells and caski cells using the gentra purification tissue kit ( qiagen , germantown , md ) and the totally rna ( tm ) kit ( ambion , austin , tx ) , respectively , according to the manufacturers' protocols .
the extracted rna was suspended in 50 mul ultra - high quality diethyl pyrocarbonate - treated water .
pcr for detection of hpv dna the presence and integrity of the dna in all samples was verified by pcr beta - globin gene amplification using the primers pc04 and gh20 ( 20 ) .
water ( negative control ) and dna from hpv - 16 - positive caski cells ( positive control ) were included in each amplification series .
the presence of hpv dna was analyzed by pcr using the general consensus primer sets gp5 +/ gp6 + and my09 / 11 ( 21,22 ) .
dna samples that were negative for hpv using gp5 +/ gp6 + or my09 / 11 pcr were re - amplified by ( auto - ) nested pcr using the gp5 +/ gp6 + primer pair as previously described ( 23 ) .
pcr products were purified and directly sequenced with an abi prism 3130xl genetic analyzer ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) .
obtained sequences were aligned and compared with those of known hpv types in the genbank database using the blast program .
detection of hpv e6 / e7 mrna by reverse transcription pcr before cdna synthesis , any residual dna was removed by incubation with 1 u dnase i ( ambion ) at room temperature for 25 min .
cdna was then synthesized from dna - free total rna using the retroscript ( r ) kit ( ambion ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
to examine the presence of contaminating dna in rna samples , all the assays were performed both with and without reverse transcriptase .
to detect high - risk e6 / e7 mrna transcripts , pcr was performed with the cdna from hpv dna - positive samples using the takara pcr human papillomavirus typing set ( takara , bio inc. , otsu , shiga , japan ) , which can identify high - risk hpv types 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 , 35 , 52 and 58 .
to verify the hpv - 16 e6 / e7 mrna transcripts , the hpv - 16 dna - positive samples were also examined using a half - nested pcr approach with cdna as previously described by wiest et al ( 24 ) .
positive pcr products were purified and directly sequenced using an abi prism 3130xl genetic analyzer ( applied biosystems ) .
immunohistochemistry for p16ink4a and scoring of results serial 4 - mum - thick sections from ffpe tumor samples were deparaffinized in a graded alcohol series .
epitope retrieval was performed by heating at 95 - 99degrees c for 10 min in tris / edta buffer ( ph 9.0 ) .
endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating the sections in 3 % hydrogen peroxide plus 15 mm sodium azide for 5 min .
the sections were subsequently incubated overnight at 4degreesc with primary monoclonal mouse anti - p16ink4a antibody ( mtm laboratories ag , heidelberg , germany ) .
after extensive washing in phosphate - buffered saline , the slides were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - mouse secondary antibody ( mtm laboratories ) .
immunolabeling was visualized by incubation in 3 - 3 ' - diaminobenzidine for 10 min .
stained slides were counterstained with hematoxylin .
cases were considered p16ink4a - positive when intense nuclear and / or cytoplasmic reactivity was present .
the scoring criteria for p16ink4a immunoreactivity ( p16ink4a expression ) were defined for this study based on previous scoring methods ( 14,15 ) : 0 ( no staining ) , 1 ( 1 - 10 % of tumor cells positive ) , 2 ( 11 - 40 % positive ) , 3 ( 40 - 70 % positive ) and 4 (> 70 % positive ) .
the term ' p16ink4a overexpression ' is defined as a score of 3 or 4 .
survival analysis descriptive statistics were used to characterize patient baseline characteristics .
the mann - whitney u - test or kruskal - wallis test was used for continuous variables , and pearson 's chi2 test or fisher 's exact test was used for categorical variables .
the inter - rater agreements between hpv - dna presence and p16ink4a expression and between hpv mrna expression and p16ink4a expression were measured by calculating cohen 's kappa coefficient .
a kappa - value < 0.20 was considered slight agreement , 0.21 - 0.40 as fair , 0.41 - 0.60 as moderate , 0.61 - 0.80 as good and 0.81 - 0.99 as excellent agreement ( 17,25 - 27 ) .
locoregional control was defined as complete and persistent disappearance of disease at the primary tumor ( t site ) and regional lymph nodes ( n site ) after treatment .
recurrence - free survival was defined as the time from the end of treatment to cancer recurrence or last follow - up. disease - specific survival was defined as the time from the end of treatment to subsidence of disease or last follow - up. survival curves were evaluated by the kaplan - meier method , and survival distributions were compared using the log - rank test .
multivariate cox proportional hazard analysis was used to identify prognostic parameters and treatments associated with risk of recurrence and disease - specific death .
p - values < 0.05 were considered significant .
all statistical analyses were performed using the spss statistical package ( spss for windows version 12.0 ; spss , inc. , chicago , il ) .
results characteristics of eligible patients and follow - up primary tumor location was the nasopharynx in 10 patients ( 6.7 %) , oropharynx in 53 ( 35.3 %) , hypopharynx in 39 ( 26.0 %) , larynx in 24 ( 16.0 %) and oral cavity in 24 ( 16.0 %) .
the follow - up period ranged from 6 to 77 months , with a median of 38 months for patients whose data were censored .
sixty - four patients were treated with ccrt , 45 with surgery and postoperative rt or crt ( radiation dosage , 50 - 54 gy ) , 22 with surgery alone and 19 with rt alone .
demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in table i. hpv dna status and hpv e6 / e7 mrna expression hpv dna was detected by pcr in 47 of 150 ( 31.3 %) primary untreated hnscc specimens , including 30.0 % ( 3 / 10 ) of nasopharyngeal , 47.2 % ( 25 / 53 ) of oropharyngeal ( 18 / 30 of palatine tonsil ) , 17.9 % ( 7 / 39 ) of hypopharyngeal , 16.7 % ( 4 / 24 ) of laryngeal and 33.3 % ( 8 / 24 ) of oral cavity cases .
among hpv - positive hnscc samples , 39 ( 83.0 %) were infected with hpv - 16 and the others were infected with other high - risk types ( 4 with hpv - 33 , 1 with hpv - 35 , 2 with hpv - 58 and 1 with hpv - 56 ) .
as two of these hpv - positive samples were insufficient for rna assay , e6 / e7 mrna expression by hpv - 16 , hpv - 33 , hpv - 35 , hpv - 58 and hpv - 56 was examined by reverse transcription pcr in 45 samples .
the e6 and e7 mrna transcripts were detected in 21 of 45 ( 46.7 %) specimens , the majority from opscc cases ( 18 / 25 hpv - positive cases ) , as shown in table ii. between the hpv dna - positive and - negative groups , there were significant differences in the distribution of histological differentiation and tumor location ; for example , the hpv dna - positive group showed poor differentiation in histology and has a higher occurrence of oropharyngeal carcinoma compared with hpv dna - negative group .
the p16ink4a overexpression group showed similar clinical characteristics ( table i ) .
p16ink4a expression and correlation with hpv status in this study , the p16ink4a expression scoring system ( 0 - 4 ) was based on the percentage of p16ink4a - positive cells ( fig. 1 ) .
expression of p16ink4a was observed in 40 of 150 ( 26.7 %) hnscc samples ( table iii ) .
the highest frequency of p16ink4a expression was found in opscc samples , with 22 of 53 ( 41.5 %) samples demonstrating a p16ink4a staining score >= 1 .
the sensitivity of p16ink4a staining for detection of hpv dna in hnscc was just 61.7 % , as only 29 of 47 hpv - positive cases also had detectable p16ink4a staining .
the specificity was 89.3 % ( 92 / 103 hpv - negative samples had a p16ink4a staining score of 0 ) for all hnscc cases ( table iii ) .
although the correlation between p16ink4a expression and hpv dna and the correlation between p16ink4a expression and e6 / e7 mrna expression in all hnscc cases proved to be significant ( both p < 0.001 ) , the inter - rater agreements were relatively low ( kappa = 0.53 and 0.54 , respectively ) .
in contrast to general p16ink4a expression , p16ink4a over - expression demonstrated high specificity for detection of hpv dna in hnscc ( 98 / 103 hpv - dna negative cases did not overexpress p16ink4a ) and opscc ( 28 / 28 cases ) .
the sensitivity of p16ink4a overexpression was only 53.2 % ( 25 / 47 cases ) for detection of hpv dna in hnscc , but was considerably better for detection of hpv dna in opscc at 80 % ( 20 / 25 cases ) ( table iii ) .
however , p16ink4a overexpression indicated the presence of hpv e6 / e7 mrna expression with high sensitivity at 90.5 % ( 19 / 21 ) and high specificity at 91.3 % ( 116 / 127 ) in hnscc , and was even more accurate for opscc , with sensitivity at 94.4 % ( 17 / 18 ) and specificity at 91.4 % ( 32 / 35 ) ( table iv ) .
moreover , the inter - rater agreement of p16ink4a overexpression for hpv e6 / e7 mrna expression status was good for hnscc ( kappa = 0.69 ) and excellent for opscc ( kappa = 0.84 ) .
based on a combination of hpv dna status and p16ink4a overexpression , subjects with opscc were divided into two groups : a double positive group of patients who were hpv dna - positive with p16ink4a overexpression and a single positive - negative or double negative group of patients who were either hpv dna - positive without p16ink4a overexpression , hpv dna - negative with p16ink4a overexpression , or hpv - dnanegative without p16ink4a overexpression .
the combination of hpv dna status and p16ink4a overexpression had both high sensitivity ( 94.4 %) and specificity ( 100 %) for detecting hpv e6 / e7 mrna expression in opscc ( table v ) .
prognostic value of hpv status and p16ink4a overexpression in opscc within the observation period , 7 of the 53 patients ( 13.2 %) developed recurrent disease , including 2 of 10 ( 20.0 %) patients with stage i / ii opscc and 5 of 43 ( 11.6 %) patients with advanced stage opscc .
however , no patient died with disease during the follow - up period .
since the disease specific rate and overall survival rate in opscc were quite fair in the present study , the prognostic analysis of opscc focused on recurrence - free survival .
since there were few recurrence - free survival events in opscc cases , multivariate analysis of recurrence - free survival was carried out instead for hnscc cases overall .
i ) prognostic value of hpv dna status , e6 / e7 mrna expression and p16ink4a overexpression in opscc .
hpv dna - positive patients with opscc had better recurrence - free survival than hpv dna - negative patients with opscc ( p = 0.008 ) ( fig. 2 ) .
the recurrence - free survival after 3 years was 72.7 % for patients with hpv dna - negative opscc and 100 % for patients with hpv dna - positive opscc .
on the contrary , there were no significant differences in recurrence - free survival and disease - specific survival between hpv dna - positive and - negative patients with non - opscc ( p = 0.139 and 0.144 , respectively ; kaplan - meier curves not shown ) .
hpv mrna - positive opscc patients exhibited a trend toward improved recurrence - free survival compared with hpv mrna - negative patients with opscc ( p = 0.051 ) ( fig. 2 ) .
the recurrence - free survival after 3 years was 78.3 % for patients with hpv mrna - negative opscc and 100 % for patients with hpv mrna - positive opscc .
opscc patients with p16ink4a overexpression showed significantly improved recurrence - free survival compared with opscc patients without p16ink4a overexpression ( p = 0.034 ) ( fig. 2 ) .
the recurrence - free survival after 3 years was 100 and 77.1 % , respectively .
ii ) comprehensive evaluation of survival according to hpv dna status and p16ink4a overexpression in opscc .
patients in the double positive group had better recurrence - free survival than those in a single negative groups or the double negative group ( p = 0.034 ) ( fig. 3 ) , with recurrence - free survival after 3 years of 100 % and 77.1 % , respectively .
iii ) multivariate analysis using cox proportional - hazard model in hnscc .
to assess the independent predictive value of all these factors for recurrence - free survival in hnscc , multivariate analysis using cox proportional - hazards models was performed .
both hpv dna presence and p16ink4a over - expression was modeled as one factor .
since no patients with positive hpv e6 / e7 mrna expression had any recurrent lesion , the influence of hpv mrna expression on recurrence - free survival could not be evaluated .
in univariate analysis , the hnscc patients with hpv dna - positive status and p16ink4a overexpression demonstrated significantly higher recurrence - free survival ( p = 0.015 ; hazard ratio ( hr ) = 8.61 ; 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) = 1.12 - 66.18 ) compared with other hnscc patients ( table vi ) .
the hnscc patients categorized in t stage 4 and those with oral cavity scc had significantly lower recurrence - free survival ( t4 , p = 0.003 , hr = 2.47 , 95 % ci = 1.6 - 5.76 ; oral cavity scc , p = 0.031 , hr = 3.94 , 95 % ci = 1.25 - 12.41 ) compared with patients categorized in t stages 1 - 3 and with opscc , respectively .
the final model of multivariate analysis using a cox proportional hazards model for identification of fair recurrence - free survival of hnscc showed that t1 - 3 stage ( p = 0.008 ; adjusted hr = 2.61 ; 95 % ci = 1.29 - 5.29 ) and the combination of hpv dna - positive status and p16ink4a overexpression ( p = 0.043 ; adjusted hr = 7.81 ; 95 % ci = 1.07 - 57.19 ) predicted significantly better recurrence - free survival ( table vi ) .
discussion over the past two decades , hr - hpv has been firmly established as a common etiologic factor in opscc and is now widely used as a prognostic marker for opscc .
although there are a number of studies on the epidemiologic role and prognostic value of hpv in opscc , some did not distinguish between patients receiving curative treatment from those receiving palliative care ( 28 - 31 ) .
moreover , there are few studies on the prognostic value of hpv infection in non - oropharyngeal scc .
in this study , we analyzed the prognostic value of hpv infection in a retrospectively selected cohort of hnscc patients receiving curative treatment .
while the oropharynx was the site of highest prevalence ( 47.2 %) , this cohort also included patients with nasopharyngeal , hypopharyngeal , laryngeal and oral cavity tumors .
the relatively high prevalence of hpv in cases of nasopharynx and oral cavity scc suggests that hpv may play an important role in these non - oropharynx hnsccs as well as in opscc .
a significant correlation was found between the presence of hpv dna and improved recurrence - free survival in opscc , with hpv dna - negative patients demonstrating an apparent greater risk of recurrence compared with hpv dna - positive patients .
opscc patients with hpv mrna expression ( active infection ) also displayed improved recurrence - free survival compared with opscc patients without hpv mrna expression ( p = 0.051 ) , in line with previous studies ( 6,9,32 - 35 ) .
although hpv dna - positive patients with nonoropharyngeal sccs also showed better recurrence - free and disease - free survival , the prognostic value did not reach statistical significance .
since opscc patients accounted for 34 % of subjects in our series , the fair prognostic significance of hpv status for non - opscc hnscc patients may be influenced by the generally excellent prognosis of patients with opscc .
indeed , isayeva et al systematically reviewed the published data regarding the prognostic significance of hpv in sccs of the oral cavity , larynx , sinonasal tract and nasopharynx and found no association between hpv status and treatment outcome ( 36 ) .
further studies are needed to clarify the influence of hpv infection on prognosis in non - opscc cases .
several studies have suggested that p16ink4a expression can be used as a surrogate marker for hpv infection in opscc ( 14,37 ) .
klaes et al defined p16ink4a staining as negative , sporadic , focal or diffuse and found a significant correlation between the presence of hr - hpv and strong diffuse p16ink4a expression ( 14 ) .
however , there are also several contradictory reports on the value of p16ink4a as a biomarker .
smith et al found no concordance between p16ink4a expression and hpv detection in 20 % of head and neck cancers ( 38 ) , possibly due to transcriptionally inactive infection or an alternate pathway of p16ink4a activation ( 39 ) .
using the same histological criteria as klaes et al ( 14 ) , hoffmann et al reported that 81.2 % of hpv dna - positive hnscc patients were also p16ink4a positive , compared with only 48.2 % of hpv dna - negative cases , including 3 cases with strong and diffuse p16ink4a staining .
moreover , no p16ink4a expression could be detected in 3 of 14 hpv dna +/ rna + hnscc lesions in their series .
they concluded that p16ink4a expression status alone is inadequate for identifying biological active or inactive hpv infections in hnscc ( 40 ) .
in the present study , the sensitivity of general p16ink4a expression for detecting hpv dna in hnscc was also low , and there was generally low rate of agreement between p16ink4a - positive status and hr - hpv e6 / e7 mrna expression in both hnscc ( kappa = 0.56 ) and opscc ( kappa = 0.57 ) .
these results indicate that p16ink4a expression alone is not suitable for identifying hpv - related tumors .
however , p16ink4a over - expression ( p16ink4a expression score >= 3 ) was a sensitive and specific marker for detecting hr - hpv mrna expression in both hnscc and opscc .
this result also underscores the potential of our scoring system for evaluating p16ink4a expression and determining prognosis .
recent studies have demonstrated a significant correlation between p16ink4a expression as a surrogate marker of hpv infection and fair prognosis in opscc .
lassen et al reported that p16ink4a - positive hnscc showed a better response to conventional radiotherapy than p16ink4a - negative hnscc , and ascribed this survival benefit to a better locoregional control rate ( 13 ) .
in a study by fischer et al ( 18 ) , p16ink4a - negative opscc patients demonstrated a more than 2 - fold greater risk of death compared with p16ink4a - positive patients .
although locoregional opscc relapse was independent of p16ink4aexpression , multivariate survival analysis indicated that p16ink4a expression was an independent prognostic indicator for opscc , but not hnscc , after adjustment for clinical t classification , clinical n classification , and treatment modality ( 18 ) .
in the present study , the combined evaluation of hpv dna status and p16ink4a overexpression could predict hpv e6 / e7 mrna expression in opscc with both high specificity ( 100 %) and sensitivity ( 94.4 %) .
furthermore , the combined evaluation of hpv dna status and p16ink4a overexpression was an independent prognostic indicator for hnscc in multivariate analysis .
given the time and expense of e6 / e7 mrna analysis , this combination may be particularly useful for larger scale clinical studies .
the combined evaluation of hpv dna status and p16ink4a overexpression was strongly correlated with hpv mrna expression in opscc .
since the combination of hpv dna - positive status and p16ink4a overexpression showed a close relation with fair recurrence - free survival in hnscc in multivariate analysis , the combination can serve as an accurate surrogate marker for biologically active hpv infection .
this combined evaluation appears to be a useful and reliable method for detecting hpv - related hnscc and determining its prognosis .

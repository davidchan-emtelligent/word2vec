cd82 / kai1 , a member of the tetraspanin superfamily , is a suppressor of metastasis and cd82 inhibits canonical wnt signaling via downregulation of several frizzled ( fzd ) isoforms , resulting in accumulation of beta - catenin at the cell membrane .
in this study , we investigated the mechanism through which cd82 inhibited fzd expression by examining the effects of micrornas ( mirnas ) .
the miranda algorithm predicted 11 mirnas from fzd sequences .
among these mirnas , cd82 caused upregulation of mir - 203 ( by 2.095 - fold ) and downregulation of mir - 338 - 3p ( by 0.354 - fold ) as compared with control cells .
transfection with mir - 203 and mir338 - 3p mimics or inhibitors revealed that mir - 203 downregulated fzd2 mrna ( by 0.268 - fold ) and protein expression ( by 0.701 - fold ) .
moreover , transfection with the mir - 203 mimic also inhibited cell migration .
therefore , these findings suggested that cd82 enhanced the expression of mir - 203 and directly downregulate fzd2 expression , suppressing cancer metastasis by inhibition of the wnt signaling pathway .

introduction cancer metastasis is the most crucial event affecting patient prognosis .
this multistep event involves the migration of cancer cells from the primary site , avoidance from host defense systems , and subsequent growth of cancer cells at secondary sites .
these malignant characteristics of cancer cells are controlled by a complex network of cancer - specific signaling pathways .
thus , elucidation of the signaling mechanisms controlling cancer cell migration and malignant characteristics will provide important insights into the development of chemotherapeutic agents to improve prognoses .
among the pathways involved in metastatic signaling , the wnt signaling pathway is a primary target .
the first step in this pathway is the binding of secreted wnt ligands to their receptor , frizzled ( fzd ) , a seven - pass transmembrane - type receptor with 10 isoforms ( fzd1 - fzd10 ) in humans .
binding of wnt ligands to the fzd - lrp5 / 6 complex leads the phosphorylation of lrp6 and recruits the axin - related protein complex .
this protein complex then releases beta - catenin , which acts as an effector of the canonical wnt signaling pathway .
released beta - catenin in the cytosol accumulates and then transduces the wnt signal to the nucleus thorough the tcf / lef complex .
in contrast , the noncanonical pathway , which is independent of beta - catenin , proceeds through wnt / planar cell polarity ( pcp ) and wnt / protein kinase c ( pkc ) .
both of these wnt signal pathways are crucial for embryonic development and cancer progression [ 1 ] .
for example , the expression of fzd1 and - 2 is correlated with cancer malignancy and prognosis in breast cancer [ 2 ] and colon cancer [ 3 ] .
however , despite the importance of the biological functions of these proteins , little is known about the gene regulatory mechanisms of wnts and fzds .
cd82 / kai1 , a member of the tetraspanin superfamily , was originally recognized as a t - cell activation accessory molecule [ 4 ] .
cd82 is also known to suppress metastasis during cancer progression [ 5 ] .
tetraspanins associate with cell surface receptors or proteins and modulate their functions .
moreover , our previous studies revealed a novel function for cd82 in e - cadherin - mediated cellular adhesion [ 6 ] .
cd82 inhibitsbeta - catenin tyrosine phosphorylation and increases the accumulation of e - cadherin / beta - catenin complexes at the cell membrane by stabilization of the complex .
this function strengthens hemophilic cancer cell adhesion in the primary cancer nest and inhibits invasion and metastasis .
we have also revealed that cd82 attenuates wnt signaling by downregulation of fzd2 , - 3 , - 5 , - 7 , and - 9 expression without regulating wnt orbeta - catenin expression , leading to inhibition ofbeta - catenin nuclear translocation [ 7 ] .
micrornas ( mirnas ) are a class of small noncoding rnas (~ 22 nucleotides ) that play important roles in the regulation of gene expression .
mirnas induce gene silencing by binding to target sites found within the 3 ' - untranslated region ( utr ) of the target mrna .
this gene silencing leads to inhibition of protein production by suppressing protein synthesis and / or by mrna degradation .
nearly 50 % of human mirnas are located in cancer - associated genomic regions or in fragile sites [ 8 ] .
in many types of human cancer , mirnas behave as oncogenes or anti - oncogenes , termed called onco - mirs and anti - onco - mirs , respectively [ 9 - 11 ] .
however , whether mirnas regulate the wnt signaling pathway in lung cancer is not yet known .
in this study , we examined the roles of mirnas in the regulation of fzd expression through cd82 in the wnt signaling pathway .
materials and methods antibodies mouse monoclonal antibodies against cd82 [ ts82b ] were purchased from abcam ( cambridge , uk ) .
the anti - fzd antibodies used in this study were as follows : rabbit polyclonal antibodies against fzd1 , fzd3 , fzd6 , fzd8 , fzd9 , and fzd10 ; goat polyclonal antibodies against fzd2 ( genetex , inc. , irvine , ca , usa ) ; and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against fzd4 , fzd5 , and fzd7 ( millipore , temecula , ca , usa ) .
cell culture the human cell line h1299 ( a non - small cell lung carcinoma cell line ) and its transfectant derivatives ( h1299 / zeo and h1299 / cd82 ) were established in our laboratory by transfection of a control vector or cd82 cdna and cell sorting - based clone selection techniques , as described previously [ 12 ] .
h1299 / zeo was a mock transfectants cell line exhibiting weak cd82 expression , while h1299 / cd82 overexpressed cd82 .
the protein levels of cd82 in h1299 / cd82 cells , as assessed by immunoblotting , were 20 times higher than that in wild - type and h1299 / zeo cells , and its cell surface expression , as assessed by flow cytometry , was approximately 9 - fold higher than that in wild - type and h1299 / zeo cells .
the cell lines used in this study were maintained in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ; sigma , st. louis , mo , usa ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ; icn biomedicals , aurora , oh , usa ) and 2 mm l - glutamine at 37degreesc and in an atmosphere of 5 % co2 .
transfection with short hairpin rna ( shrna ) h1299 / cd82 - sh.control and h1299 / cd82 - sh.cd82 cell lines were generated by transfection of h1299 / cd82 cells with plko.1 - puro control vector ( sigma ) and plko.1 - puro / sh.cd82 ( nm _ 002231 ; sigma ) , respectively , using lipofectamine ( invitrogen life technologies , carlsbad , ca , usa ) .
transfected cells were selected by resistance to puromycin ( sigma ) and pooled from the individual transfection .
the expression levels of cd82 in shrna - transfected h1299 cells were monitored by reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) and immunoblotting .
h1299 / cd82 - sh.control and h1299 / cd82 - sh.cd82 cells were maintained in dmem containing 10 % fbs and 2 mug / ml puromycin .
transfection with mirna mimics or mirna hairpin inhibitors h1299 / zeo and h1299 / cd82 cells were seeded at 2 x 105 cells per well in 6 - well plates and transfected with miridian microrna mimics , miridian microrna hairpin inhibitors , or controls ( thermo fisher scientific inc. , waltham , ma , usa ) .
all mirna mimics , mirna hairpin inhibitors , and controls were transiently transfected into cells using lipofectamine rnaimax ( invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
prediction of possible mirnas using a web - based application we searched for mirnas that potentially targeted fzds and wnts using a web - based prediction application , miranda ( http :// www.microrna.org ; released in august 2010 ) [ 13,14 ] .

target inhibition analysis of mirna we predicted the target site of mir - 203 in the 3'utr of fzd2 mrna by miranda software , and the specific complimentary sequence for the target site was synthesized using miscript target protector ( qiagen ) .
an mir - 203 mimic was transfected into h1299 cells with various concentrations of target protector according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
at 48 h after transfection , fzd2 mrna levels were measured by real - time pcr .

results prediction of mirnas that potentially targeted fzd2 , - 3 , - 5 , - 7 , and - 9 we have previously reported that cd82 downregulates the expression of fzd2 , - 3 , - 5 , - 7 , and - 9 but does not regulate wnt or other fzd isoforms [ 7 ] .
therefore , to identify mirnas that downregulate only fzd2 , - 3 , - 5 , - 7 , and - 9 , we first predicted common mirnas targeting fzd2 , - 3 , - 5 , - 7 , and - 9 using miranda [ 13 ] .
we excluded mirnas that also targeted other fzd isoforms and wnts from the predicted mirnas .
as a result , we selected 11 mirnas ( mir - 27a , mir - 27b , mir - 145 , mir - 185 , mir - 197 , mir - 203 , mir - 221 , mir - 222 , mir - 338 - 3p , mir - 376a , and mir - 376b ) that were potentially regulated by cd82 to target fzd2 , - 3 , - 5 , - 7 , and - 9 for further study ( table 1 ) .
the mirsvr scores of these mirnas , which indicate the possibility of their downregulation at the mrna level [ 14 ] , are also shown ( table 1 ) .

mir - 338 - 3p was significantly downregulated in h1299 / cd82 cells ( 0.354 - fold ) , whereas mir - 203 was significantly upregulated ( 2.095 - fold ) , as compared with h1299 / zeo cells .
additionally , knockdown of cd82 by shrna in h1299 / cd82 cells allowed recovery of mirna levels to those in h1299 / zeo cells .
these results suggested that cd82 specifically regulated these mirnas .
no significant differences in mir - 27a , mir - 27b , mir - 145 , mir - 185 , mir - 197 , mir - 221 , mir - 222 , mir - 376a , or mir - 376b expression levels were observed between h1299 / zeo and h1299 / cd82 cells ( fig 1 ) .

discussion the mechanisms regulating fzd expression have not been elucidated .
recently , researchers have reported that fzd is regulated by mirnas [ 16,17 ] .
therefore , in this study , we analyzed the effects of mirnas on fzd expression .
using the miranda algorithm [ 13,14 ] , we predicted 11 candidate mirnas that targeted specific fzds. of these , mir - 203 and mir - 338 - 3p were regulated by cd82 overexpression .
after subsequent analyses , only mir - 203 inhibited fzd2 expression at the mrna and protein levels .
as shown in fig 8 , fzd2 had one potential complimentary mir - 203 - binding site within its 3 ' - utr , suggesting that fzd2 was targeted by mir - 203 .
additionally , target inhibition assays designed for this binding site revealed that mir - 203 targeted fzd2 mrna directly .
moreover , mir - 203 also regulated cell migration , a critical component of metastatic progression , in cancer cells through cd82 .
thus , our data provided important insights into the regulation of the wnt signaling pathway by mirnas in cancer cells .

cd82 / kai1 is recognized as an antimetastatic factor and has been reported to attenuate or modify cell membrane receptor signaling , including integrin , epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) , and c - met pathways [ 6,12,15 ] .
we have previously reported that cd82 regulates canonical wnt signaling by downregulating specific fzds ( fzd2 , - 3 , - 5 , - 7 , and - 9 ) [ 7 ] .
these fzds are mainly part of the noncanonical wnt pathway ( wnt / pcp and wnt / pkc ) , with the exception of fzd9 .
therefore , cd82 inhibits both canonical wnt signaling and noncanonical wnt signaling by suppressing fzd receptor expression .
suppression of both wnt signaling pathways is known to contribute to cancer progression via various mechanisms .
additionally , our analysis demonstrated that mirnas were involved in the cd82 - dependent regulation of fzds , thereby providing insights into these complex regulatory mechanisms .
mir - 203 has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor in malignant melanoma [ 18 ] , glioma [ 19,20 ] , and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [ 21 ] , but as a tumor promoter in epithelial ovarian cancer [ 22 ] .
various types of mir - 203 target genes have been reported , including versican , an extra cellular matrix proteoglycan [ 18 ] , phospholipase d2 ( pld2 ) [ 20 ] , robo1 / erk / mmp9 [ 19 ] , pi3kca [ 23 ] , creb1 [ 24 ] , lasp1 , nuak1 , and sparc [ 25 ] .
this is the first report that mir - 203 directly regulated fzd2 mrna and protein levels .
fzd2 is one of the most important receptors in the noncanonical wnt pathway .
in many types of cancer , fzd2 expression is strongly correlated with poor prognosis [ 2,3,26,27 ] .
in particular , wnt5a / fzd2 signaling has been shown to control melanoma ca2 + homeostasis [ 28 ] , cellular migration , and invasion in colon cancer [ 3 ] .
interestingly , mir - 203 inhibits cancer stem cell maintenance by self - renewal inhibition through indirect induction of dkk1 , a secreted antagonist of the canonical wnt pathway [ 29 ] .
thus , mir - 203 can inhibit both canonical and noncanonical wnt pathways .
this function corresponds to that of cd82 and supports the potential crosstalk between cd82 and mir - 203 .
however , the mechanism through which cd82 downregulates mir - 203 is still unclear .
cd82 forms complexes with cell membrane receptors and modifies their signaling pathways .
we previously reported that cd82 attenuates egfr and c - met signaling by binding to these receptors [ 6,12,15 ] .
recently , egfr and c - met receptor tyrosine kinase were shown to control mirna expression [ 30 ] .
in this previous report , overexpression of mir - 203 in a549 cells was shown to reduce akt phosphorylation and the expression of its substrate gsk3beta .
this finding was also consistent with our previous report showing that overexpression of cd82 downregulates gsk3beta [ 7 ] .
furthermore , c - met receptor inhibits the expression of mir - 203 , and forced expression of cd82 attenuates c - met signaling in h1299 cells .
these reports suggest that cd82 enhances the expression of mir - 203 via attenuation of c - met signaling .
however , this indirect evidence needs to be confirmed in further studies .
importantly , in this study , we confirmed the functional effects of mir - 203 transfection in cancer cells .
transfection of h1299 / zeo cells led to a 20 % reduction in cell migration compared to parental h1299 / zeo cells , and this level of reduction was half of that in h1299 / cd82 cells ( 40 %) .
these results suggested that fzd3 , - 5 , and - 7 , which are also downregulated by cd82 expression , may contribute to cd82 function .
these mechanisms should be investigated in further studies .
in conclusion , we found that cd82 enhanced the expression of mir - 203 and directly downregulated fzd2 expression .
accumulating evidence has demonstrated the presence of abnormal mir - 203 expression in cancer stem cell .
therefore , this novel mechanism for the regulation of fzd2 expression via mir - 203 could be utilized for epigenetic therapy for cancer stem cells .

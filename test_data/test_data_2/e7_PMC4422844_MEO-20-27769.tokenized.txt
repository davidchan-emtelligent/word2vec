introduction progress testing has been widely used in medical schools to test scientific knowledge but has not been reported for assessing clinical skills .
development we designed a novel progress examination that included assessments of both clinical performance and underlying basic and social science knowledge .
this progress clinical skills examination ( pcse ) was given to 21 early medical students at the beginning and end of a 6 - week pilot test of a new medical school curriculum .
implementation this examination was feasible for early students , easy to map to curricular objectives , and easy to grade using a combination of assessment strategies .
future directions use of a pcse is feasible for early medical students .
as medical schools integrate clinical experience with underlying knowledge , this type of examination holds promise .
further data are needed to validate this examination as an accurate measure of clinical performance and knowledge .
progress test early clinical exposure assessment pilot integration progress testing , with origins at the university of maastricht , the netherlands ( 1 ) , and the university of missouri kansas city , is defined as ' a longitudinal , comprehensive examination of knowledge acquisition and retention ' ( 2 ) and a ' quality - controlled assessment tool for improving learning and teaching and the demonstration of educational standards' ( 3 ) .
it has also been described as an assay of ' functional knowledge ' ( 4 ) .
progress tests sample the ' complete knowledge domain ' ( 3 ) expected of graduating medical students and are delivered multiple times over the course of the educational program .
because progress testing assesses the whole knowledge domain , it can be used for unique curricula with an unusual learning trajectory .
the university of maastricht needed a rational assessment strategy for its problem - based learning curriculum , one that would drive continuous , deep , learner - driven knowledge acquisition rather than test - or course - driven ' binge learning ' .
the university of missouri program , with entry into medical school directly from high school , required its assessment of students to take that uniqueness into account , and sought to demonstrate the rigor of their educational strategy .
at this time , progress testing is taking place all over the world , and is described by a rich literature .
advantages of progress testing described by that literature include the provision of integrated data for learners , faculty , and the overall curriculum over time ( 5 ) ; early prediction of students requiring remediation ( 2 ) ; and stability of the assessment process , as the same progress test can be administered as long as the same knowledge domain is desired , irrespective of the curricular strategy .
progress tests provide a ' growth curve ' of knowledge that can illuminate curricular outcomes and support both learner and curriculum improvement .
albano et al .
( 6 ) demonstrated the differing ' kinetics' of six different curricula and also demonstrated little difference in final knowledge acquisition through the use of a common progress test sequence .
importantly , schuwirth et al .
( 4 ) demonstrated that students experience less overall stress and anxiety when progress testing is employed as the major assessment strategy .
progress testing has been applied to medical knowledge assessment but has not been described for clinical skills assessment .
nationally , medical educators are working to better integrate learning with actual performance through simulation or through work - based assessment .
the movement toward entrustable professional activities ( epas ) ( 7 ) requires the assessment of integrated performance and drives the need for integrated assessment strategies .
we have embarked on a curriculum renewal process characterized by the integration of ' necessary science ' ( defined as the foundational biological , psychological , and social sciences needed to function as a new resident ) and clinical skills throughout the entire medical education program .
for many of the same reasons that medical knowledge progress testing was developed in the united states and the netherlands , we needed to envision an assessment system that would support integration as the highest value for both our faculty and our students .
toward this end , we created a ' progress clinical skills examination ( pcse )' requiring demonstration of integrated clinical skills and the necessary science knowledge underpinning those skills .
we administered our pcse twice as a pilot with early learners .
little has been published about the use of a clinical skills exam with early medical students , and the feasibility in this population was not clear .
we describe the development , implementation , lessons learned , and the future directions of that pcse .
development setting the student group for the pcse was drawn from another pilot study , which included a 6 - week trial of an early clinical experience ( ece ) .
our student sample was determined by the needs of this pilot. of 21 students ( 9 male and 12 female ) , 7 had completed the first year of medical school , 9 had not yet matriculated , and 5 had completed a post - baccalaureate program .
this pilot group was selected to represent a broad range of academic backgrounds and a range of previous clinical experience .
all 21 students participated in the pcse at the beginning and at the end of the ece pilot test .
our planned new curriculum is built on a framework of approximately 120 chief complaints and concerns ( c3 ) topics , which define the competencies expected of our graduates .
the end - competency template for each c3 is divided into three sections .
the first section includes data gathering , problem identification and synthesis , and management .
the second section includes the necessary science underpinning each clinical skill .
the last section details the complexities and challenges we expect graduates to be able to identify and explore .
design of pcse the psce was designed as a multistation objective structured clinical examination ( osce ) .
in each station , students had 20 min with a standardized patient , family member , and / or healthcare team member , followed by 10 min to answer associated essay questions .
the pcse was blueprinted so that each station was linked to a specific c3 and each included assessments linked to all three parts of the end - competency template ( see table 1 ) .

we developed the essay questions to assess necessary science knowledge based on the relevant c3 end - competency template .
the questions sampled a broad range of content , including physiology , anatomy , biochemistry , public health , safety science , ethics , pharmacology , and epidemiology .
grading rubrics for each essay question were developed by faculty using key concepts and / or key words .
we also received feedback from students about the pcse as part of the pilot test evaluation .
the data from this project were reviewed by the michigan state university institutional review board and were determined to be exempt .
implementation a four - station clinical skills exam was given to all students at the beginning of the 6 - week pilot .
students interviewed and examined standardized patients and then answered three to six questions at a computer kiosk .
the first exam occurred in a single morning .
at the end of the pilot , the same four cases were used , along with four new cases .
the number of necessary science questions answered was limited to three .
the second exam occurred in a long afternoon .
the students were able to participate in the exam without difficulty , even though several had not started medical school and few had any clinical experience .
all students completed the essay questions in the time allotted .
three faculty members graded the essay portion of the pcse .
using the rubrics , a single faculty member could grade all 21 students' essays for a single station in less than an afternoon .
students valued the experience ; one student commented ' the pcse helped me get ready for the clinic .
i got less nervous .
it was like practice .
the sp 's were really good ' .
a faculty member commented ' the surprising thing was that many students felt that the pcse prepared them for clinic - an unintended consequence ' .
although the pcse was designed as an assessment of knowledge and skills , the exam was seen by students as another opportunity to practice for clinical care .
the delivery of the exam was different between the two points .
not only did the second iteration have more stations , it was also delivered after a multiple choice examination in the morning , and after a busy 6 - week pilot .
given these limitations , comparison of student performance data has limited utility .
however , students had no problems completing the longer pcse in the time allotted .
future directions as medical education moves toward a competency - based approach in which integrated clinical performance is the goal , the inclusion of a clinical skills component to progress examinations will be necessary to match assessments to curricular objectives .
our experience demonstrated that administration of the pcse to early medical students is feasible .
an important feature of this examination was the integration of the clinical encounter with essay questions to elaborate underlying necessary science , reflecting the integrated nature of the curriculum itself .
since this initial pcse pilot test , we have successfully administered this examination to a sample of first through fourth year students at our institution to demonstrate its validity and its response to curricular effort .
these administrations are providing baseline data as we transition to our new curriculum .
as medical education moves to a more integrated approach to curriculum and assessment , this type of examination holds promise .

insulin is an important peptide hormone that regulates food intake and olfactory function .
while a multitude of studies investigated the effect of insulin in the olfactory bulb and olfactory epithelium , research on how it modulates higher olfactory centers is lacking .
here we investigate how insulin modulates neural activity of pyramidal neurons in the anterior piriform cortex , a key olfactory signal processing center that plays important roles in odor perception , preference learning , and odor pattern separation .
in vitro we find from brain slice recordings that insulin increases the excitation of pyramidal neurons , and excitatory synaptic transmission while it decreases inhibitory synaptic transmission .
in vivo local field potential ( lfp ) recordings indicate that insulin decreases both ongoing gamma oscillations and odor evoked beta responses .
moreover , recordings of calcium activity from pyramidal neurons reveal that insulin modulates the odor - evoked responses by an inhibitory effect .
these results indicate that insulin alters olfactory signal processing in the anterior piriform cortex .
anterior piriform cortex insulin olfactory local field potentials fiber photometry slice recording national natural science foundation of china10.13039 / 50110000180931571082 introduction the sense of smell and status of satiety influence each other .
while the cue from the olfactory system modulates the eating behavior ( rolls , 2005 ; yeomans , 2006 ; soria - gomez et al. , 2014 ; lushchak et al. , 2015 ) , the status of satiety also dramatically affects the ability of the olfactory system to detect and discriminate odors in both humans and rodents ( pager , 1978 ; julliard et al. , 2007 ; albrecht et al. , 2009 ; marks et al. , 2009 ; stafford and welbeck , 2011 ; rolls , 2015 ) .
several peptide hormones , such as insulin , leptin and orexins are key factors that mediate the interplay between olfaction and food intake ( julliard et al. , 2007 ; prud'homme et al. , 2009 ; palouzier - paulignan et al. , 2012 ; brunner et al. , 2013 ; chelminski et al. , 2017 ) .
insulin is secreted by pancreatic beta - cells in response to blood glucose levels .
it plays important roles in regulating energy homeostasis ( sohn et al. , 2013 ) .
application of insulin into the third ventricle decreases food intake and body weight of rats ( air et al. , 2002 ) .
meanwhile , insulin and its receptors are found in various regions in the olfactory system , including the olfactory epithelium ( lacroix et al. , 2008 ) , the olfactory bulb ( ob ) ( banks et al. , 1999 ; aime et al. , 2012 ) and likely higher brain centers such as piriform cortex and anterior olfactory nuclei ( unger et al. , 1989 ) , suggesting that this peptide plays crucial role in olfaction .
since the ob contains one of the highest concentrations of insulin and insulin receptors within the central nervous system ( banks et al. , 1999 ) , the effect of insulin on the ob and underlying neural modulation have been extensively studied in the past decades .
for example , the molecular mechanisms of how insulin affects mitral cells have been revealed by identifying kv1.3 as a substrate for insulin - mediated phosphorylation in the ob ( fadool et al. , 2000 , 2011 ; colley et al. , 2004 ) .
moreover , a recent study deciphered how insulin modulates the neural activity of mitral cells in slice recording and a mathematical model was established to explain how insulin impacts odor detection and discrimination ( kuczewski et al. , 2014 ) .
besides the ob , other olfactory related brain centers , such as anterior piriform cortex ( apc ) , anterior olfactory nuclei , and olfactory tubercle , are also involved in processing , encoding / decoding of olfactory information , olfactory learning and odor perception ( wilson and sullivan , 2011 ; bekkers and suzuki , 2013 ; giessel and datta , 2014 ; cohen et al. , 2015 ; ghosh et al. , 2015 , 2017 ; bolding and franks , 2017 ; roland et al. , 2017 ; tantirigama et al. , 2017 ) .
the apc plays a key role in odor signal processing .
on the circuit level , it receives dense direct innervation from mitral and tufted cells , two main output neurons in the ob ( bekkers and suzuki , 2013 ; giessel and datta , 2014 ) .
functionally , the apc plays important roles in odor preference learning ( morrison et al. , 2013 ) , odor pattern separation ( chapuis and wilson , 2011 ; davison and ehlers , 2011 ) , olfactory learning ( cohen et al. , 2015 ; ghosh et al. , 2015 ) , and processing of odor objects ( wilson and sullivan , 2011 ) .
the strategies for encoding odor identity and temporal information by the apc also have been intensively investigated ( zhan and luo , 2010 ; miura et al. , 2012 ; gire et al. , 2013 ; bolding and franks , 2017 ; hu et al. , 2017 ; roland et al. , 2017 ) .
given the crucial roles of the apc in olfaction , and potential expression of insulin receptors ( unger et al. , 1989 ) , it is surprising that no study was performed to shed light on how insulin affects the neural activity of the apc .
the apc is a three - layered cortical region .
the layer 2 of the apc contains dense pyramidal neurons which receive direct sensory input from mitral / tufted cells on their apical dentrites ( poo and isaacson , 2011 ; tantirigama et al. , 2017 ) .
in the current study , we investigated the effect of insulin on the pyramidal neurons from layer 2 of the apc by patch - clamp slice recording , in vivo electrophysiology and fiber photometry .
we found a rather complex effect of insulin on this important higher olfactory center .
materials and methods animals male mice ( kunming , mus musculus ) were used in all experiments ( 21 - 30 days old for slice recording , and 8 - 16 weeks old for other experiments ) .
the number of mice used for each experiment is reported in the section " results. " mice were purchased from the national rodent experimental animal seed center ( shanghai , china ) and bred in the animal facilities of the xuzhou medical university .
they were housed in a vivarium with a 12 / 12 light / dark cycle with lights on at 8:00 a.m. experiments were performed during the light cycle .
food and water were available ad libitum .
all experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the xuzhou medical university institutional animal care and use committee .
slice preparation and recording mice were anesthetized with diethylether and decapitated .
the entire brain was quickly immersed in ice - cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( acsf ; composition in mmol / l : 119 nacl , 2.5 kcl , 1.3 mgcl2 , 2.5 cacl2 , 1.25 kh2po4 , 1.3 nahco3 , and 20 glucose ) .
osmolarity was 300 - 320 mosm and the ph was adjusted to 7.4 .
acsf was bubbled continuously with carbogen ( 95 % o2 / 5 % co2 ) .
coronal brain slices , 300 mum thick , were cut with a leica vt1000s vibratome ( leica biosystems , wetzlar , germany ) .
fresh slices were incubated in a chamber with carbogenated acsf and were incubated at 35degreesc for 1 h and then at room temperature ( 26degreesc ) before being transferred to the recording chamber .
slices were visualized with a 60x objective on an upright microscope ( eclipse fn1 , nikon ) .
apc was identified based on its location relative to the lateral olfactory tract ( lot ) and the compact density of cells in layer 2 .
pyramidal neurons in layer 2 in apc were recorded by patch clamp with an axopatch - 700b amplifier ( molecular devices ) .
the pyramidal neurons were identified by cell body morphology and location ( suzuki and bekkers , 2011 ; sheridan et al. , 2014 ) .
in current - clamp mode , for whole - cell action potential ( ap ) recording , pipettes were filled with an internal solution containing ( in mm ) : 140 k - methylsulfate , 4 nacl , 0.2 egta , 4 mgatp , 0.3 na3gtp , 10 phosphocreatine and 10 hepes , 310 mosm , ph 7.3 adjusted with koh .
a step current ( 200 pa with 500 ms duration ) was used to evoke ap firing .
the interval of each trial was 60 s and a total of 5 trials were used in both control and insulin conditions .
insulin ( human recombinant insulin , sigma , st louis , mo , united states ) was used at 1 mug.ml - 1 ( 172 nm ) ( fadool et al. , 2000 , 2011 ; colley et al. , 2004 ) .
the concentrations of tetra - ethylammonium ( tea , sigma , st louis , mo , united states ) and margatoxin ( sigma , st louis , mo , united states ) were 20 mm and 10 nm , respectively .
all drugs were dissolved in acsf and bath perfused over the entire slice .
a single cell was recorded from each slice .
in voltage - clamp mode , miniature - excitatory postsynaptic currents ( mepscs ) and lot - evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents ( eepscs ) were recorded at - 60 and - 70 mv holding potential respectively while the slices were bathed in acsf perfusion media including (+) - bicuculline ( 10 mumol / l , enzo ) to block gabaa receptor - mediated inhibitory synaptic currents .
the pipettes were filled with the internal solution containing ( in mm ) : 105 k - gluconate , 30 kcl , 10 hepes , 10 phosphocreatine , 4 atp - mg , 0.3 gtp - na , and 0.3 egta .
miniature - inhibitory postsynaptic currents ( mipscs ) were recorded at - 70 mv holding potential in slices bathed in acsf perfusion media containing d - ( - ) - 2 - amino - 5 - phosphonopentanoic acid ( 50 mum , apv ; tocris bioscience ) to block the n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) - type ionotropic glutamate receptors and 2,3 - dioxo - 6 - nitro - 1,2,3,4 - tetrahydrobenzo [ f ] quinoxaline - 7 - sulfonamide ( 20 mum , nbqx ; tocris bioscience ) to block the alpha - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - ioxazole - 4 - propionic acid ( ampa ) - type receptors .
the pipettes were filled with the internal solution containing ( in mm ) : 135 cscl , 2 na2atp , 0.2 egta , 10 hepes , 0.3 na3gtp , and 10 glucose , 310 mosm , ph 7.2 adjusted with csoh .
in both mepsc and mipsc recordings , aps were eliminated by blockage of na + channels with tetrodotoxin ( ttx , 1 mum ; acros , waltham , ma , united states ) .
the mepscs and mipscs were recorded separately .
the mepscs / mipscs were recorded for 30 min , and the insulin was applied to the slice at the end of the 5th min .
the eepscs were recorded for 15 trials in both control and insulin conditions under five different pulses ( 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , 0.25 , and 0.3 ma , respectively ) with a bipolar concentric electrode placed on the lot and the pulses ( 200 mus ) were delivered through a stimulus isolation unit ( a.m.p.i ) .
the interval between each trial was 20 s. data were acquired at 10 khz and low - pass filtered at 2 khz .
during the recording , the pipettes had a tip resistance of 3 - 5 momega .
the series resistance was always monitored during recording to avoid resealing the ruptured membrane , which would cause changes in both the kinetics and amplitude of the mepsc / mipsc .
recordings were excluded from analysis when the series resistance or capacitance deviated by more than 15 % from initial values .
data were collected and processed with pclamp10.2 .
distributions of insulin receptors ( irs ) we measured spatial expression of irs and camkii alpha ( a marker of pyramidal cells ) by immunostaining in the apc of the mice ( n = 5 ) .
the mice were euthanized and then intracardially perfused with 0.9 % saline followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer ( 0.1 m , ph 7.4 ) .
the brain was harvested and post - fixed for 24 h in 4 % paraformaldehyde at 4degreesc and then was cryoprotected with 30 % sucrose until it sank .
the tissue was sectioned coronally , 40 mum thick , with a cryostat ( leica ) .
for immunohistochemistry , brain cryosections were preincubated for 4h at room temperature with a blocking buffer containing phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) and 0.5 % triton x - 100 with 5 % normal serum from the host species of the secondary antibodies .
the sections were then incubated overnight at 4degreesc with rabbit anti - ir - beta primary antibody ( 1:50 ; # sc - 711 , santa cruz biotechnology ) and anti - mouse camkii alpha primary antibody ( 1:150 ; # 05 - 532 ; millipore ) diluted in the blocking buffer .
then , sections were washed with pbs and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies for immunostaining : alexa fluor 488 anti - rabbit ( 1:500 ; catalog # a11008 ; invitrogen ) , and alexa fluor 555 anti - mouse ( 1:500 ; catalog # a31570 ; invitrogen ) .
after the final wash , slides were incubated with dapi for nuclear staining , and were coverslipped with 50 % glycerol mounting medium .
images were obtained by confocal scanning microscopy ( zeiss , lsm710 ) and were processed via zen 2011 ( zeiss ) .
we manually drew 1 - 2 regions of interest ( rois ) in layer 2 of apc of the same size ( diameter = 50 mum ) in the different images from 5 mice .
the immunostained neurons were counted with the imagej using cell counter plugin .
surgery mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital ( 90 mg / kg ) and were mounted on a stereotaxic apparatus equipped with an electric heating pad .
the skin was cut and a small craniotomy was made above targeted areas at stereotaxic coordinates ( apc : ap , + 2.1 mm ; lateral , 2.0 mm ; dv : 4.0 mm ; ob : ap , + 4.3 mm ; lateral , 1.0 mm ; dv : 1.8 mm ) .
a cannula ( o.d = 0.48 mm , stainless steel needle , rwd life science company , shenzhen , china ) was implanted into the lateral cerebral ventricle ( icv ) for insulin application in vivo .
for viral injection and fiber implant for fiber photometry , the virus ( aav - camkii - gcamp6s , 1 mul , brainvta , wuhan , china ) was slowly injected ( 50 nl / min ) into the apc through a glass pipette , using a microsyringe pump ( the stoelting quintessential injector ; stoelting co. ) .
the glass pipette was left in place for 10 additional minutes and then slowly withdrawn .
following aav - camkii - gcamp6s virus injection , an optical fiber ( 200 mum o.d. , 0.37 numerical aperture ( na ) ; newdoon ) was placed in a ceramic ferrule and inserted toward the apc through the craniotomy .
the ceramic ferrule was supported with a stainless steel screw and dental acrylic .
a custom - made aluminum head plate was attached to the skull with stainless steel screws and dental cement .
fiber photometry after implant of the fiber , mice were individually housed for at least 10 days for recovery from the surgery and expression of the virus .
fluorescence emission was recorded with a fiber photometry system ( thinkerbiotech , nanjing , china ) using methods similar to previous studies ( guo et al. , 2015 ; li et al. , 2016 ) .
briefly , a laser beam from a 488 nm laser ( obis 488ls ; coherent ) was reflected by a dichroic mirror ( md498 ; thorlabs ) , focused through an objective lens ( x10 , na = 0.3 ; olympus ) and then coupled to an optical commutator ( doric lenses ) .
an optical fiber ( 200 mm o.d. , na = 0.37 , 1.5 m long ) coupled the light between the commutator and the implanted optical fiber .
the laser power was adjusted at the tip of the optical fiber to the level of 40 - 60 muw .
the gcamp6s fluorescence emission was bandpass filtered ( mf525 - 39 , thorlabs ) and detected by a photomultiplier tube ( r3896 , hamamatsu ) .
an amplifier ( c7319 , hamamatsu ) was used to convert the photomultiplier tube current output to voltage , which was further filtered through a low - pass filter ( 35hz cut - off ; brownlee 440 ) .
the analog voltage signals were digitalized at 500 hz and recorded by fiber photometry software ( thinkerbiotech , nanjing , china ) .
local field potential ( lfp ) recordings local field potentials were recorded in the apc using stainless steel electrodes ( catalog # 791000 ; a - m systems ) targeted to the apc stereotaxic coordinate ( ap , + 2.1 mm ; lateral , 2.0 mm ; dv : 4.0 mm ) with reference to a skull screw implanted posteriolateral to bregma .
signals were amplified ( 2000x , a - m systems ) , filtered at 0.1 - 300 hz , and sampled at 2 khz .
lfp signals along with odor stimulation event markers were recorded with a homemade recording system based on a national intruments sampling card ( ni - usb - 6009 ) .
for both fiber photometry and lfp recordings , insulin was applied via icv injection , immediately after the recordings in control condition were done .
the recordings under insulin condition started about 1 h later. between the two recording conditions , the mice were free - moving in their home cages .
odor stimulation awake mice were head - fixed with two horizontal bars ( fixed with head - plate by two screws ) and were able to maneuver on an air - supported free - floating styrofoam ball ( thinkerbiotech , nanjing , china ) .
different odors were presented by an odor delivery system ( thinkerbiotech , nanjing , china ) .
four odorants , isoamyl acetate , 2 - heptanone , phenyl acetate and benzaldehyde ( sinopharm chemical reagent co. shanghai , china ) were used .
the odors were dissolved in minal oil at 10 % dilution .
a stream of charcoal - filtered air flowed over the oil , and then was diluted to 1 / 20 by an olfactometer .
the odor stimulation was synchronously controlled with the data acquisition system by a solenoid valve , which was driven by a digital to analog converter .
air or odorized air were delivered to the nose at a constant rate of 1 l / min to eliminate the effect of the airflow .
for each odor , 20 trials were presented with inter - trial intervals of 30 s. the duration of each odor presentation was 2 s. measurement of insulin levels one hour before apc tissue separation , mice received icv injection from a microliter syringe connected to the needle implanted into the brain ( ap : - 0.5 mm ; ml : 1.0 mm ; dv : 3.0 mm ) with either nacl ( 0.9 %) or 14 mu insulin ( human , recombinant , expressed in yeast , sigma - aldrich ) administered in a 2 mul nacl vehicle over 60 s , using a 10 mul microliter syringe ( aime et al. , 2012 ) .
insulin was extracted from apc tissues according to the procedure of fadool et al .
( 2000 ) .
insulin level was determined using an insulin enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) kit ( nanjing jiancheng biology engineering institute , nanjing , china ) according to the manufacturer 's defined protocol .
experimental design and statistical analysis for the current - evoked aps ( figure 2 ) , firing properties for each neuron were analyzed using clampfit software ( molecular devices ) .
the distribution of inter - spike intervals ( isis ) was determined for the 5 trials prior to insulin application and 5 trials midway through the perfusion of insulin .
the burst index was calculated as t _ l / t _ f , where t _ f is the time interval between the first and second aps , and t _ l is the interval between the last two aps .
for a given pyramidal cell , insulin was considered to affect the isis of this cell significantly when p < 0.05 by a two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov test ( figures 2a - c,e1,e2 ) .
the first latencies of a given cell were compared by student t - test ( unpaired , p < 0.05 was considered as significant effect , figures 2d1,d2 ) .
the effect of insulin on latency / isi across the group of neurons recorded was tested by a paired t - test ( figures 2d3,e3 ) .
the correlation between two groups ( e.g. , figures 2d4,e4 , 5k,l , 6k,l ) was tested by liner regression , and the significance was further tested by an f - test .
for the mepsc and mipsc , the frequency and amplitude were characterized using minianalysis ( synaptosoft ) software with a bin of 30 s. the rising time and decay time of the mepsc / mipsc were characterized using clampfit software .
the data 5 min prior to insulin application ( 0 - 5th min , 10 bins ) was considered as control , and data for the 5 min following 2 min after insulin application ( 8th - 13th min , 10 bins ) was considered as the insulin condition .
the frequency / amplitude between the two conditions for each neuron was compared by unpaired t - test ( 10 bins / samples for each condition , figures 5c,d , 6c,d ) .
the averaged effect of insulin on frequency / amplitude between the two conditions across the group of neurons recorded ( 22 for mepsc and 20 for mipsc , respectively ) was compared by a paired t - test ( figures 5i,j , 6i,j ) .
for the eepsc , the amplitude was characterized using clampfit software .
the amplitudes were averaged for all the 3 trials under the same stimulation pulse prior or subsequent to insulin application .
for each neuron , the amplitude of eepsc evoked by 0.3 ma was normalized to 100 ( figure 7b ) , and the amplitude evoked by other current intensities and all currents intensities under insulin condition were normalized relative to this amplitude .
two - way anova ( effect on insulin and the intensities of stimuli ) was applied to test whether insulin affects the amplitudes significantly across intensity ( figure 7b ) .
a custom program written in matlab was used to analyze the lfp signals .
raw data of 5 s prior to the onset of odor stimulation were selected as the ongoing activities .
time - frequency transformation was performed based on this 5 s window ( hanning window ; fft size , 2048 ; frequency resolution , 0.977 hz ) , and the spectral power was calculated for each frequency resolution .
as in previous studies , lfp signals were divided into different frequency bands ( figure 8 ) : theta ( 2 - 12 hz ) , beta ( 15 - 35 hz ) , and gamma ( low , 36 - 65 hz ; high , 66 - 95hz ) .
for odor - evoked beta band lfp responses , windows 3 s prior to and 5 s after the onset of odor stimulation were selected ( figure 9 ) .
to obtain both high time and frequency resolution , this time course was divided into segments with 1 s duration and 90 % overlap .
time - frequency transformation was performed based on the 1 s windows .
the spectral power was normalized to db and calculated for each frequency bandwidth ; the power from all frequencies included within the bandwidth was averaged .
for each trial , the baseline was normalized to 1 , and all the trials for each odor stimulation were averaged based on the normalized data ( figure 9 ) .
photometry data were exported to matlab mat files from the photometry software files for further analysis .
the data were segmented based on the onset of odor stimulation within individual trials .
we derived the values of fluorescence change ( deltaf / f ) by calculating ( f - f0 ) / f0 , where f0 is the baseline fluorescence signal averaged over a 5 - s - long control time window , which was typically set preceding the onset of odor stimulation .
deltaf / f values were presented as heatmaps or average plots ( figure 10 ) .
results expression of insulin receptors in the pyramidal neurons of apc the apc is one of the brain areas that express high levels of insulin receptors in rats ( unger et al. , 1989 ) .
here we sought to confirm this finding in mice and asked whether the insulin receptors are expressed by pyramidal neurons .
in layer 2 of apc , where the soma of pyramidal neurons are located , we found that a large proportion of the dapi - positive cells were insulin - receptor immunopositive ( figure 1 , 67.4 % +/ - 5.3 , counted in 9 rois of 5 sections from 5 mice , total number of cells = 531 ) .
the insulin - receptor immunopositive signals were distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus .
nuclear translocation of the insulin receptor has been proposed to be involved in mediating insulin 's long term effects ( podlecki et al. , 1987 ) .
furthermore , specific staining of the pyramidal neurons identified by immunostaining for camkii alpha revealed that most of the insulin receptor immunopositive cells and pyramidal neurons were colocalized ( figure 1 ) .
in total , we found 92.2 % +/ - 0.02 of camkii alpha positive neurons were insulin receptor immunopositive , and 53.4 % +/ - 0.06 of insulin receptor immunopositive cells were camkii alpha positive ( counted in 9 rois of 5 sections from 5 mice , total number of cells = 200 camkii positive , 531 dapi labeled ) .
thus , these results indicate that the insulin receptors exist in a large percent of pyramidal neurons in the mouse apc .
figure 1 immunohistochemical characterization of the expression of insulin receptors in pyramidal neurons of the apc .
the ( bottom ) shows the enlarged image of the areas within white boxes in the ( top ) .
the white arrows indicate examples of pyramidal neurons ( red ) expressing insulin receptors ( green ) .
excitatory effects of insulin on current - evoked aps of the pyramidal neurons to test the effects of insulin on pyramidal neuron excitability , we recorded current - evoked aps from pyramidal neurons in apc slices .
we observed a substantial decrease elicited by insulin in the first latency of the current - evoked aps .
examples of the shortening of the latency are shown in figures 2a1,c1 .
this shortening was observed in most of the neurons recorded ( 23 / 38 , 60.1 % , 9 mice , figures 2d1,d2 ) , although no effect ( 3 / 38 , 7.9 %) or the opposite effect ( 12 / 38 , 31.6 %) were also found in other neurons ( figures 2d1,d2 ) .
on the average , insulin shortened the latencies significantly across the group of neurons recorded [ figure 2d3 , 24.1 +/ - 2.3 ms vs. 14.2 +/ - 1.8 ms , paired t - test , n = 38 neurons from 9 mice , t ( 37 )= 4.64 , p < 0.001 ] .
furthermore , we found a significant linear negative correlation between the first latency under control condition and normalized change in latency ( linear regression , n = 38 , r = 0.60 , p < 0.001 , figure 2d4 ) .
this correlation suggests that insulin tends to shorten the first latencies of pyramidal neurons with longer latencies .
figure 2 insulin modulates the first latency and isi of pyramidal neurons in current - evoked aps .
( a1,b1,c1 ) raw traces showing a depolarizing step of 0.2 na was repeated in the control condition ( black trace ) and during insulin ( red trace ) , under current - clamp mode .
the bottom panel shows the enlarged time windows of the raw traces within dashed boxes in the top panel .
( a2,b2,c2 ) cumulative probability of the isi of aps in control condition ( black ) and during insulin ( red ) for the representative neurons shown in ( a1,b1,c1 ) , respectively .
insulin significantly decreases isi ( a2 , within - cell kolmogorov - smirnov test , n = 38 and 62 isis for control and insulin , respectively , p < 0.001 ) , increases isis ( b2 , n = 59 and 49 , p = 0.003 ) or causes no significant effect ( c2 , n = 51 and 56 , p = 0.34 ) on the three representative neurons .
( d1,e1 ) comparison of the current - evoked latency ( d1 )/ isi ( e1 ) of aps between the control condition and during insulin for all 38 neurons .
dark red , latency / isi during insulin is significant longer than control ( mean value of latency / isi during insulin is larger than control with a p - value smaller than 0.05 for a given neuron ) ; blue , latency / isi during insulin is significant shorter than control ( mean value of latency / isi during insulin is shorter than control with a p - value smaller than 0.05 for a given neuron ) ; gray , no signifiant difference .
the pink line shows the diagonal , where latency / isi in control is equal to insulin .
( d2,e2 ) percent of neurons showing increased ( dark red ) , decreased ( blue ) , and no significant effect ( gray ) of insulin on latency ( d2 ) and isi ( e2 ) .
( d3,e3 ) comparsion of latency [ d3 , paired t - test , n = 38 , t ( 37 ) = 4.64 , p = 4.23 * e - 5 ]/ isi [ e3 , paired t - test , n = 38 , t ( 37 ) = 3.00 , p = 0.005 ] in control and insulin conditions across the group of neurons recorded .
the error bars represent mean +/ - se .
( d4,e4 ) relationship between normalized change of latency ( d4 )/ isi ( e4 ) induced by insulin and the latency / isi in control condition .
the significance of correlation was tested by liner regression , n = 38 for both latency ( d4 ) and isi ( e4 ) , the r and p - values are indicated in the plots .
in addition , we noticed that insulin application elicited a modest decrease on the isi of aps for a proportion of the neurons recorded ( example shown in figure 2a ) .
insulin also increased the isi of a small number of neurons , and caused no effect on the remaining neurons ( examples shown in figures 2b,c ) .
we found that the isi of more than half of the neurons recorded was affected by insulin ( 18 / 38 , 58.1 % , 9 mice , figures 2e1,e2 ) , among which 77.8 % ( 14 / 18 ) displayed a decrease in isi , and 22.2 % ( 4 / 18 ) showed an increase ( figures 2e1,e2 ) .
on the average , insulin shortened the isi slightly , but significantly , across the group of neurons recorded [ figure 2e3 , 46.7 +/ - 2.0 ms vs. 43.5 +/ - 1.8 ms , paired t - test , n = 38 neurons from 9 mice , t ( 37 ) = 3.00 , p = 0.005 ] .
finally , we found a significant linear negative correlation between the change in isi elicited by insulin and the isi for each neuron ( linear regression , n = 38 , r = 0.36 , p = 0.025 , figure 2e4 ) .
to determine whether the effects observed above were caused by insulin as opposed to other factors such as rundown , we performed a control experiment in 11 pyramidal neurons using inactivated insulin .
we found that the inactivated insulin affected neither the isi [ 50.7 +/ - 4.3 ms vs. 50.1 +/ - 4.3 ms , paired t - test , n = 11 neurons from 3 mice , t ( 10 ) = 0.35 , p = 0.73 ] nor latency [ 22.4 +/ - 4.6 ms vs. 19.2 +/ - 4.4 ms , paired t - test , n = 11 , t ( 10 )= 1.46 , p = 0.18 ] .
the resting membrane potentials ( rmp ) are elevated by insulin from figures 2a1,c1 , we also observed an obvious elevation of rmp during insulin ( red traces vs. black traces ) .
we compared the rmp under control and during insulin application for all the 38 neurons , and found that insulin elevated the rmp of most of the neurons [ figures 3a,b , - 66.5 +/ - 1.2 mv vs. - 58.7 +/ - 1.3 mv , paired t - test , n = 38 neurons from 9 mice , t ( 37 ) = 8.04 , p < 0.001 ] .
as a control , we did not find a significant change of rmp [ - 63.1 +/ - 2.6 mv vs. - 62.7 +/ - 3.1 mv , paired t - test , n = 11 neurons from 3 mice , t ( 10 )= 0.29 , p = 0.78 ] using the inactivated insulin .
furthermore , we did n't find a significant correlation between the rmp under control condition and normalized deltarmp induced by insulin ( figure 3c , linear regression , n = 38 , r = 0.23 , p = 0.17 ) , suggesting this is a common effect for all the neurons .

the error bars represent se .
( h ) comparison of effects of insulin on rmp without and in presence of tea .
n = 38 and 16 for without tea and in presence of tea , respectively ; unpaired t - test , t ( 52 ) = 2.28 , p = 0.027 .
the error bars represent se. next , we asked whether the elevation of the rmp was caused by blocking of potassium channels .
we selected tetra - ethylammonium ( tea ) and margatoxin , two potassium channel inhibitors known to block different kv1 and kv3 potassium channel subtypes ( ishikawa et al. , 2003 ) .
kv1.3 is the major contributor to insulin modulation of the activity of mitral cells in the ob ( fadool et al. , 2000 , 2011 ; palouzier - paulignan et al. , 2012 ) .
after potassium channels were blocked by tea , insulin still elevated the rmp significantly [ figures 3d,f , from - 62.0 +/ - 1.7 mv to - 58.3 +/ - 1.8 mv , n = 16 for each group from 6 mice , paired t - test , t ( 15 ) = 3.09 , p = 0.007 ] .
however , the increase elicited by insulin was significantly decreased [ figure 3h , from 11.5 % +/ - 1.4 to 5.8 % +/ - 2.0,unpaired t - test , n = 38 and 16 , t ( 52 ) = 2.28 , p = 0.027 ] , indicating that tea partly abolished the effect of insulin .
after application of both tea and margatoxin , we found that the effect of insulin on pyramidal neurons was almost completely abolished [ figures 3e,g , from - 60.2 +/ - 3.2 mv to - 59.3 +/ - 3.1 mv , n = 16 for each group from 6 mice , paired t - test , t ( 15 )= 0.99 , p = 0.34 ] .
therefore , these results show that potassium channels , perhaps kv1.3 , are the major contributors to the effect of insulin on the pyramidal neurons in apc .
since there are two types of pyramidal neurons in layer 2 of apc , sl ( semilunar ) and sp ( superficial pyramidal ) ( suzuki and bekkers , 2006 ; tantirigama et al. , 2017 ) , we next asked whether the effects of insulin differ between these neurons .
as reported in previous study ( suzuki and bekkers , 2006 ) , the sl and sp could be differentiated by morphology and burst index ( see materials and methods ) : the burst index is smaller than 2 for sl and larger than 2 for sp ( figure 4a ) .
for the 38 neurons , 20 were sl and 18 were sp ( figure 4a ) .
the rmp of sp was significantly lower than sl [ - 63.7 +/ - 1.6 mv vs. - 69.6 +/ - 1.5 mv , unpaired t - test , n = 20 and 18 , t ( 36 ) = 2.67 , p = 0.01 , figure 4b ] , which was consistent with previous studies ( suzuki and bekkers , 2006 ; sheridan et al. , 2014 ) .
however , we did not find any significant difference between sp and sl for the effect of insulin on isi [ 20.0 % +/ - 4.1 vs. 12.8 % +/ - 5.0 , unpaired t - test , n = 20 and 18 , t ( 36 ) = 1.12 , p = 0.27 , figure 4c ] , first latency [ 5.5 % +/ - 2.7 vs. 6.0 % +/ - 3.5 , unpaired t - test , t ( 36 ) = 0.13 , n = 20 and 18 , p = 0.90 , figure 4d ] , or rmp [ 12.6 % +/ - 1.9 vs. 10.3 % +/ - 2.1 , unpaired t - test , n = 20 and 18 , t ( 36 ) = 0.81 , p = 0.42 , figure 4e ] .
therefore , it is likely that insulin modulates the response of these two types of cells with same mechanisms and to a similar magnitude .

the error bars represent mean +/ - se. insulin increases the frequencies of mepsc and decreases mipsc to further investigate the effects of insulin on synaptic transmission in the pyramidal neurons of apc , we recorded mepscs and mipscs of the pyramidal neurons in the slices .
to ask whether insulin causes any effect on excitatory synaptic component , we recorded the mepscs while blocking all inhibitory synapses ( figures 5a,b , see materials and methods ) .
we found that insulin significantly changed the frequency and / or amplitude of the mepscs in some neurons .
figures 5a - d shows that the frequency [ figure 5c , 0.53 +/ - 0.05 hz vs. 0.85 +/ - 0.06 hz , unpaired t - test , n = 10 bins for both control and insulin , t ( 18 ) = 4.10 , p = 0.0007 ] and amplitude [ figure 5d , 7.8 +/ - 0.1 pa vs. 8.4 +/ - 0.2 pa , unpaired t - test , n = 10 bins for both control and insulin , t ( 18 ) = 2.32 , p = 0.03 ] of mepsc of a representative pyramidal neuron were both significantly increased by insulin .
we found that the mepsc frequencies of 50.0 % ( 11 / 22 ) of the neurons were significantly changed by addition of insulin , among which 72.7 % ( 8 / 11 ) were increased and 27.3 % ( 3 / 11 ) were decreased ( figures 5e,g ) .
for mepsc amplitudes , 36.4 % ( 8 / 22 ) neurons were significantly changed , among which 75.0 % ( 6 / 8 ) were increased and 25.0 % ( 2 / 8 ) were decreased ( figures 5f,h ) .
in general , insulin increased the frequencies of mepsc significantly [ figure 5i , 1.9 +/ - 0.3 hz vs. 2.1 +/ - 0.3 hz , paired t - test , n = 22 neurons from 11 mice , t ( 21 ) = 2.26 , p = 0.035 ] but caused not significant effect on the amplitude [ figure 5j , 9.9 +/ - 0.7 pa vs. 10.0 +/ - 0.6 pa , paired t - test , n = 22 neurons from 11 mice , t ( 21 ) = 0.60 , p = 0.55 ] across the group of neurons recorded .
the increased effect on the frequency of mepsc was observed for the application of insulin , but not for inactivated insulin [ 1.98 +/ - 0.18 hz vs. 1.89 +/ - 0.17 hz , paired t - test , n = 8 neurons from 3 mice , t ( 7 ) = 1.48 , p = 0.18 ] .
we did not find any difference between control and insulin for the rising time [ 8.60 +/ - 1.03 ms vs. 9.15 +/ - 1.28 ms , paired t - test , t ( 21 ) = 0.36 , n = 20 neurons from 7 mice , p = 0.72 ] or decay time [ 20.8 +/ - 2.05 ms vs. 25.4 +/ - 1.84 ms , paired t - test , t ( 21 ) = 1.76 , n = 20 neurons from 7 mice , p = 0.09 ] of the mipscs .
furthermore , we found a significant linear negative correlation between the frequency / amplitude of mepsc under control condition and normalized deltafrequency / normalized deltaamplitude ( figures 5k,l , linear regression , n = 22 neurons from 11 mice , r = 0.46 and 0.61 , p = 0.03 and 0.002 , respectively ) .
these correlations suggest that insulin tends to increase the frequency / amplitude of mepsc of the pyramidal neurons with lower frequency / amplitude .

we also recorded mipscs while blocking all the excitatory components to test whether there is an effect of insulin on inhibitory synaptic components ( figures 6a,b ) .
we found that insulin significantly changed the frequencies and / or amplitudes of the mipscs in some neurons .
figures 6a - d shows the frequency [ figure 6c , 2.1 +/ - 0.08 hz vs. 1.2 +/ - 0.05 hz , unpaired t - test , n = 10 bins for both control and insulin , t ( 18 ) = 9.25 , p < 0.001 ] and amplitude [ figure 6d , 12.7 +/ - 0.2 pa vs. 11.7 +/ - 0.3 pa , unpaired t - test , n = 10 bins for both control and insulin , t ( 18 ) = 2.76 , p = 0.01 ] of mipsc of a representatively pyramidal neuron are both significantly decreased by insulin .
we found the mipscs frequencies of 60.0 % ( 12 / 20 , 9 mice ) neurons were significantly changed by insulin , among which 16.7 % ( 2 / 12 ) were increased and 83.3 % ( 10 / 12 ) were decreased ( figures 6e,g ) .
for mipsc amplitudes , only 30.0 % ( 6 / 20 ) were significantly changed , in which 33.3 % ( 2 / 6 ) were increased and 66.7 % ( 4 / 6 ) were decreased ( figures 6f,h ) .
in general , insulin decreased the frequencies of mipsc significantly [ figure 6i , 1.3 +/ - 0.2 hz vs. 1.1 +/ - 0.1 hz , paired t - test , t ( 19 ) = 2.64 , n = 20 neurons from 7 mice , p = 0.016 ] and caused not significant effect on the amplitudes [ figure 6j , 11.9 +/ - 0.5 pa vs. 12.5 +/ - 0.7 pa , paired t - test , n = 20 neurons from 7 mice , t ( 19 ) = 1.74 , p = 0.10 ] across the group of neurons recorded .
these effects were observed for application of insulin , but not for inactivated insulin [ 1.26 +/ - 0.07 hz vs. 1.24 +/ - 0.06 hz , paired t - test , n = 11 neurons from 4 mice , t ( 10 ) = 1.11 , p = 0.29 ] .
we did not find any difference between control and insulin for the rising time [ 2.92 +/ - 0.27 ms vs. 2.88 +/ - 0.28 ms , paired t - test , t ( 19 ) = 0.19 , n = 20 neurons from 7 mice , p = 0.85 ] or decay time [ 13.7 +/ - 1.62 ms vs. 13.4 +/ - 1.12 ms , paired t - test , t ( 19 ) = 0.26 , n = 20 neurons from 7 mice , p = 0.80 ] of the mipscs .
interestingly , we found a significant linear negative correlation between the frequency , but not the amplitude of mipsc under control condition and normalized deltafrequency / normalized deltaamplitude ( figures 6k,l , linear regression , n = 20 neurons from 9 mice , r = 0.64 and 0.17 , p = 0.002 and 0.46 , for frequency and amplitude , respectively ) .
this correlation suggests that insulin tends to decrease the frequency of mipscs of the pyramidal neurons with higher frequencies .

insulin increases the amplitudes of lot - evoked epscs since the apc receives direct and dense innervation from the olfactory bulb through the lot , electrical stimulation of the lot should induce strong epscs in the pyramidal neurons of the apc .
we asked whether insulin has an effect on the lot - evoked epscs in the apc .
we found strong epscs in response to electrical stimulation of the lot ( figure 7a ) .
insulin increased the amplitudes of the epscs significantly [ figure 7b , two - way anova , n = 11 neurons from 4 mice , f ( 1,100 )= 12.7 , p = 0.0006 ] .

the black arrow indicates the response normalized to 100 ( 0.3 ma , control condition ) .
insulin modulates both ongoing and odor - evoked lfp signals in awake mice next , we investigated the effects of insulin on the neural activity of the apc in vivo .
we recorded the lfp signals from the apc with a single stainless steel electrode , and changed the insulin levels by injection in the icv ( see materials and methods , figure 8a ) .
in a parallel experiment , we tested the insulin level in the apc before and 1h after injection of insulin in the icv , and found that the insulin level increased significantly after injection [ 0.24 +/ - 0.03 ng / mg vs. 0.36 +/ - 0.03 ng / mg , unpaired t - test , n = 4 groups for both control and insulin , each group contains 3 mice , t ( 6 ) = 2.85 , p = 0.029 , figure 8b ] .
thus , using this method , we changed insulin levels in the apc .

two - way anova ( effect of insulin and different frequencies of each band as the two factors ) was performed to test the significance of the effect of insulin on lfps .
n = 9 mice ( 11 , 22 , 31 , and 30 frequencies for theta , beta , low gamma and high gamma bands , respectively ) , f ( 1,176 ) = 2.97 , f ( 1,352 ) = 2.55 , f ( 1,496 ) = 22.7 , and f ( 1,480 ) = 75.2 ; p = 0.09 , 0.11 , 2.5 * e - 6 , and 6.6 * e - 7 for theta ( d1 ) , beta ( d2 ) , low gamma ( d3 ) and high gamma ( d4 ) , respectively .
the error bars represent se. we compared the lfp signals in awake head - fixed mice ( n = 9 ) before and after insulin injection .
as in previous studies ( li et al. , 2014 , 2015 ) , the raw lfp signals were divided into different frequency bands : theta , 2 - 12 hz ; beta , 15 - 35 hz ; low gamma , 36 - 65 hz ; high gamma , 66 - 95 hz ( figure 8c ) .
an example is shown in figure 8c .
insulin caused no significant effect on theta and beta bands but decreased significantly low and high gamma bands of the lfp signals [ figure 8d , two - way anova , n = 9 mice ( 11 , 22 , 31 and 30 frequencies for theta , beta , low gamma and high gamma bands , respectively ) , f ( 1,176 ) = 2.97 , f ( 1,352 ) = 2.55 , f ( 1,496 )= 22.7 , and f ( 1,480 ) = 75.2 ; p = 0.09 , 0.11 , 2.5 * e - 6 , and 6.6 * e - 7 for theta , beta , low gamma and high gamma , respectively ] .
therefore , insulin mainly decreased the gamma ( both low and high ) bands of ongoing lfp signals in awake mice .
we also investigated the effects of insulin on odor - evoked lfp responses in awake mice .
figure 9a shows an example of responses to isoamyl acetate in an awake mouse , with strong beta response .
after application of insulin , the isoamyl acetate - induced increase in beta band was decreased ( figures 9a,b1 ) .
this phenomenon was also observed for other odorants ( e.g. , figures 9b2,b4 ) .

two - way anova was used to compare the control and insulin , f ( 1,64 ) = 6.8 , p = 0.01 .
the error bars represent se .
( e ) comparison of relative response induced by insulin ( odor response under control divided by odor response under insulin ) among different odors .
one - way anova was used to test the difference , f ( 3,32 ) = 0.39 , p = 0.76 .
when the effect of insulin on odorant - induced changes in lfp power was surveyed in different mice and odors , we found that insulin decreased the odor - evoked beta response significantly [ figures 9c,d , two - way anova , n = 36 , f ( 1,64 )= 6.8 , p = 0.01 ] across the group of mice recorded .
further analysis revealed that the decreased effect was not significant different among odors [ figure 9c , two way anova , n = 36 , f ( 3,64 ) = 1.36 , p = 0.26 ; figure 9e , one way anova , n = 9 mice for each group , f ( 3,32 ) = 0.39 , p = 0.76 ] .
therefore , our data indicate that insulin primarily decreases the odor - evoked beta responses .
since mice rely on the respiration / sniffing to sample the odor , the decreased responses may be caused by the change of sampling rate ( respiration rate ) after application of insulin .
we analyzed the theta oscillation of the ob lfp during the odor presentation which is highly correlated with the cycle of respiration / sniff in awake rodents ( rojas - libano et al. , 2014 ; li et al. , 2015 ) .
we found that there was no significant difference between control and insulin conditions [ 2.74 +/ - 0.13 hz vs. 2.56 +/ - 0.12 hz , n = 9 mice , paired t - test , t ( 8 )= 1.37 , p = 0.21 ] .
therefore , the decreased odor - evoked responses after insulin application are not due to the change of the odor sampling rate .
insulin modulates calcium signals of pyramidal neurons in awake mice the lfp signals reflect the local extracellular current - evoked by neural circuit activity in the apc .
to ask whether insulin modulates the odor evoked activity of pyramidal neurons in awake mice , we used fiber photometry to specifically record the calcium signals from pyramidal neurons .
we injected the virus aav - camk2 - gcamp6s into apc , and a fiber was implanted after the virus injection ( figure 10a ) .
ten days later , we found extensive expression of gcamp6s in layer 2 of the apc ( figure 10b ) .
odors evoked an increase in gcamp6s fluorescence in the awake head - fixed mice ( figure 10c , upper row ) .
after insulin application , the response amplitudes were dramatically changed for many odors and / or mice ( figures 10c,e ) .
in general , insulin significantly decreased odor - evoked calcium responses across the group of mice recorded ( figures 10e,f , two - way anova , n = 40 ( 10 mice with 4 odors ) , f ( 1,72 )= 19.8 , p = 3.1 * e - 5 ] .
the two - way anova also indicated that the effect on different odor responses was significantly different [ figure 10e , f ( 3,72 )= 4.4 , p = 0.007 ] .
further one - way anova revealed that the decreased effect caused by insulin on 2 - heptanone - evoked response was significantly larger than isoamyl acetate - evoked response [ figure 10g , n = 40 ( 10 mice with 4 odors ) , f ( 3,36 )= 4.4 , p = 0.01 ] .
therefore , consistent with the lfp results , the main effect of insulin is to decrease the odor evoked calcium responses of pyramidal neurons .

discussion our study provides new information on the effect of insulin on neural activity of pyramidal neurons in the apc , both in vitro and in vivo .
to our knowledge , this is the first study investigating how insulin modulates the ongoing and odor - evoked responses in olfactory cortex .
we demonstrate that locally the main effect of insulin is to increase the excitation of pyramidal neurons , and excitatory synaptic transmission to these neurons and decrease inhibitory synaptic transmission in vitro .
however , the data from in vivo lfp recordings indicate that insulin mainly decreases both ongoing activity and odor evoked beta response at the apc .
moreover , recordings of calcium activity from pyramidal neurons also reveal that insulin modulates the odor evoked responses by a prevailing inhibitory effect .
in addition to the excitatory effect , we also found an inhibitory effect of insulin on a minority of pyramidal neurons in slice recording .
this complicated dual modulation was also observed in mitral cells of the ob ( kuczewski et al. , 2014 ) .
a mathematical model has been established and predicts that the complicated action of insulin could impact odor detection and discrimination in opposite directions depending on the odor quality ( kuczewski et al. , 2014 ) .
this hypothesis is fully consistent with our in vivo studies in the apc which show that although insulin mainly decreases odor evoked responses ( both lfp and calcium signals ) in the majority of the cases , it also increases the responses in other situations ( figures 9 , 10 ) .
therefore , it 's likely that insulin affects the activity of pyramidal neurons of apc and mitral cells of the ob in a similar manner .
however , we find that the effects of insulin on pyramidal neurons are dependent on the basic properties of the neurons ( e.g. , isi and first latency of current - evoked aps , frequencies of mepsc and mipsc , figures 2 , 5 , 6 ) , this phenomenon has not been reported in the ob , indicating potential different molecular mechanisms / pathways that insulin takes effect on the two olfactory centers .
furthermore , the different effects ( excitatory , inhibitory or no effect ) of insulin on the pyramidal neurons might be due to the distribution of the insulin receptors ( figure 1 ) and / or different receptor sub - types across the neurons , and this is an open question for future studies .
in the intact brain there are two possible ways for modulation of the pyramidal neurons by insulin .
one is that insulin acts through insulin receptors in these neurons and modulates their activity directly .
the other is that insulin affects the activity of the neurons in other brain areas , e.g. , mitral cells of the ob , thereby modulating the activity of the pyramidal neurons through their neural projections .
this is an indirect pathway .
in our study , evidence of dense expression of insulin receptors in the pyramidal neurons and local effects of insulin through patch clamp studies in slices supports a direct effect of insulin .
we found that insulin tends to increase the excitation of pyramidal neurons , e.g. , the rmp was elevated , and isi and first latency were shortened by insulin ( figure 2 ) .
this is likely a direct effect of insulin on receptors expressed in the pyramidal neurons of piriform cortex ( figure 1 ) .
moreover , insulin significantly modulated the frequencies of both mepsc and mipsc of a substantial number of neurons while it did n't affect the amplitude of either mepsc or mipsc ( figures 5 , 6 ) , indicating strong pre - synaptic effects , which are an effect of insulin on other cells such as the neurons projecting from the ob and / or local interneurons in the apc .
an indirect effect of insulin on piriform cortex activity elicited by changes in brain areas projecting to olfactory cortex was more likely in the awake animals .
in vivo , insulin exerts effects widely in the brain ( aime et al. , 2012 ; palouzier - paulignan et al. , 2012 ) , including areas that project to olfactory cortex ( bekkers and suzuki , 2013 ; giessel and datta , 2014 ) , and densely express insulin receptors , including ob , hippocampus and hypothalamus .
on the other hand , in awake mice , modulatory projections such as cholinergic ( ma and luo , 2012 ; rothermel et al. , 2014 ) , serotonergic ( kapoor et al. , 2016 ; lottem et al. , 2016 ) and noradrenergic ( linster and cleland , 2016 ) inputs are active and dramatically modulate the olfactory system including apc .
the activity of these modulatory projections may be affected by insulin .
we find that insulin tends to increase the neural activity of pyramidal neurons in vitro ( figure 2 ) , but decreases neural activity in vivo ( figures 9 , 10 ) .
the difference between the slice and awake animal recordings is likely because of the effect of insulin on brain areas projecting to olfactory cortex .
this situation is similar to the action of insulin in the ob : while a prevailing excitatory effect was observed on the spontaneous firing of mitral cell in slice recording ( kuczewski et al. , 2014 ) , the number of neurons whose firing was decreased and increased by insulin were similar ( 8 vs. 7 ) during in vivo recordings ( cain , 1975 ) .
in behavioral studies , administration of insulin increased the threshold of odor perception in both human and rats ( aime et al. , 2007 , 2012 ; brunner et al. , 2013 ) .
this phenomenon is likely due to weaker odor - evoked responses in olfactory centers after application of insulin .
in the ob , insulin mainly increased spontaneous activity of the mitral cells ( kuczewski et al. , 2014 ) .
since weaker odor - evoked responses were observed with higher baseline activity in the mitral cells ( li et al. , 2011 , 2017 ; kato et al. , 2012 ; kollo et al. , 2014 ) , it is expected that weaker odor - evoked response would be observed during insulin application .
this prediction was confirmed in slice recordings where olfactory sensory stimulation mimics odor stimulation ( kuczewski et al. , 2014 ) .
however , the situation in apc is different , since the pyramidal neurons usually respond to odors with stronger firing increments when the baseline activity is higher ( murakami et al. , 2005 ) .
in the current study , insulin mainly decreased the ongoing activity of the lfp signals , thus it also decreased the odor evoked responses .
taken together , in both ob and apc , insulin decreased the odor evoked responses of the neurons by modulating their baseline activity .
this is consistent with insulin increasing the threshold of odor perception .
in the ob , the molecular mechanisms of how insulin affects the neurons have been studied ( fadool et al. , 2000 , 2011 ; palouzier - paulignan et al. , 2012 ) , and it was found that the potassium channel kv1.3 is the key target for insulin .
in the apc , we found that the effect of insulin to elevate the rmp of pyramidal neurons was abolished after both tea - sensitive and margatoxin - potassium channels were blocked , suggesting that kv1.3 is likely the major contribution to the effect of insulin observed in current study .
further studies are needed to decipher the detailed molecular mechanisms in the apc .
combining our results with the previous studies , we conclude that the effect of insulin on the olfactory central system is rather complex , caused by an overall network effect on the whole system not only one specific center .
investigating how the different olfactory centers interact with each other during the application of insulin in awake behaving animals is an open question for future studies .

background although current chemotherapy using bortezomib ( velcade ) against multiple myeloma in adults has achieved significant responses and even remission , a majority of patients will develop acquired resistance to bortezomib .
increased thioredoxin level has been reported to be associated with carcinogenesis ; however , the role of thioredoxin in bortezomib drug resistance of myeloma remains unclear .
methods we generated several bortezomib - resistant myeloma cell lines by serially passaging with increased concentrations of bortezomib over a period of 1.5 years .
thioredoxin expression was measured by real - time pcr and western blot .
results the role of thioredoxin in the survival of bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells was determined by specific shrna knockdown in vitro and in vivo .
thioredoxin inhibitor ( px12 ) was used to determine the effectiveness of thioredoxin inhibition in the treatment of bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells .
the effect of thioredoxin inhibition on mitophagy induction was examined .
the correlation of thioredoxin expression with patient overall survival was interrogated .
thioredoxin expression was significantly upregulated in bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells and the change correlated with the increase of bortezomib concentration .
thioredoxin gene knockdown using specific shrna sensitized bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells to bortezomib efficiency in vitro and in vivo .
similarly , pharmacological inhibition with px12 inhibited the growth of bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells and overcame bortezomib resistance in vitro and in vivo .
furthermore , inhibition of thioredoxin resulted in the activation of mitophagy and blockage of mitophagy prevented the effects of px12 on bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells , indicating that mitophagy is the important molecular mechanism for the induction of cell death in bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells by px12 .
moreover , inhibition of thioredoxin resulted in downregulation of phosphorylated mtor and erk1 / 2 .
finally , thioredoxin was overexpressed in primary myeloma cells isolated from bortezomib - resistant myeloma patients and overexpression of thioredoxin correlated with poor overall survival in patients with multiple myeloma .
conclusions our findings demonstrated that increased thioredoxin plays a critical role in bortezomib resistance in multiple myeloma through mitophagy inactivation and increased mtor and erk1 / 2 phosphorylation .
thioredoxin provides a potential target for clinical therapeutics against multiple myeloma , particularly for bortezomib - resistant / refractory myeloma patients .

these plasma cells proliferate in the bone marrow and frequently invade into the adjacent bone , causing skeletal destruction that finally results in fractures [ 3 , 4 ] .
in addition , multiple myeloma can cause anemia , renal insufficiency , frequent infection , and hypercalcemia and is associated with significant mortality and morbidity .
multiple myeloma accounts for about 1 % of all types of malignancy and 10 % of hematologic malignancies .
in 2017 , there were 30,280 new diagnoses and an estimated 12,590 deaths from myeloma in the usa alone .
existing therapies for multiple myeloma , including the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib ( btz ) and carfilzomib , have the potential of extending the overall survival but are not curative [ 5 ] .
bortezomib is one of the major drugs in the treatment of multiple myeloma [ 6 ] .
almost all myeloma patients will receive bortezomib during their course of treatment , yet nearly all patients will develop drug resistance to bortezomib [ 7 ] .
thus , to unmask the failure to cure , drug resistance mechanisms associated with bortezomib must be characterized .
thioredoxin ( txn ) is a 12 kda ubiquitous oxidoreductase .
along with nadph and thioredoxin reductase , thioredoxin constitutes the thioredoxin system , one of the major disulfide reductase antioxidant systems in mammalian cells .
thioredoxin is crucial in defense against oxidative stress and in maintaining the redox environment in the cell .
in addition , txn has multi - faceted roles [ 8 ] .
txn regulates a variety of redox - sensitive signaling pathways as well as ros - independent genes and exerts cytoprotective effects .
overexpression of thioredoxin has been implicated in the pathogenesis of advanced malignancies , including solid cancer and hematological malignancy [ 9 ] .
besides , there are increasing evidences of its role in the development of resistance to several chemotherapeutic agents including cisplatin and docetaxel [ 10 , 11 ] .
mitophagy , mitochondrial degradation by autophagic delivery to lysosomes , is the major degradative pathway in mitochondrial turnover .
mitochondria are the essential site of aerobic energy production in eukaryotic cells .
maintaining a healthy population of mitochondria is essential to the cellular redox homeostasis and the well - being of cell self - renewal [ 12 ] .
the role of mitophagy dysfunction in cancer pathogenesis is currently an area of active investigation but the findings varied [ 13 ] .
for instance , some studies suggested that a decrease in mitophagy led to the increase in the production of free radicals and subsequent genetic instability [ 14 , 15 ] , thus , favoring the development of cancer .
on the other hand , studies have found that mitophagy protected cancer cells from apoptosis [ 16 , 17 ] ; thus , an increase in mitophagy will promote cancer cell survival and progression .
it is highly likely that the double - edged roles of mitophagy dysfunction in cancer pathogenesis may change significantly depending on cancer cell types [ 18 ] .
however , the role of mitophagy in chemotherapeutics - induced drug resistance is still unknown and remains to be investigated .
we hypothesized that thioredoxin plays an important role in bortezomib drug resistance in multiple myeloma , providing a novel therapeutic target against cancer drug resistance in the treatment of multiple myeloma .
additionally , we aimed at investigating the effects of thioredoxin on mitophagy in bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells .

results upregulation of thioredoxin correlates with the development of bortezomib drug resistance in multiple myeloma cells to generate adaptive btz - resistant multiple myeloma cell lines , we cultured five different myeloma cell lines ( mm.1s , mm.1r , opm1 , rpmi8226 / dox , and ncih929 ) over a period of 1.5 years with gradually increased concentrations of btz .
at the end of the serial cultures , the ic50 of the btz - resistant myeloma cell lines to bzt has increased by 10 - 100 fold ( ranging from 7.06 to 110 fold ) ( fig. 1a , b and additional file 1 : fig. s1a - 1c ) .
compared to their parental btz - sensitive cells , btz - resistant myeloma cells demonstrated a significant upregulation of both thioredoxin mrna gene expression and protein expression ( fig. 1c - f and additional file 1 : fig. s1d - 1i ) .
importantly , thioredoxin protein expression increased in parallel to the increase in drug resistance to btz ( fig. 1e , f ) .
these data suggested that thioredoxin plays an important role in the development of bortezomib drug resistance in multiple myeloma. fig. 1 thioredoxin is upregulated in adaptive bortezomib - resistant multiple myeloma cells .
a and b generation of adaptive bortezomib - resistant myeloma cell lines : mm.1r cells ( a ) and rpmi8226 / dox cells ( b ) were cultured with serially increased concentrations of bortezomib over a period of 1.5 years .

four shrnas specific for human thioredoxin were transfected into mm.1r - btz - resistant myeloma cells and rpmi8226 / dox - btz - resistant myeloma cells .
thioredoxin knockdown efficiencies were determined by western blot .
as shown in fig. 2a , d , shtxn1 and shtxn3 were very effective in downregulating thioredoxin expression in both mm.1r - btz and rpmi8226 / dox - btz cells and were chosen for subsequent experiments. fig. 2 genetic deletion of thioredoxin reduced btz - resistant multiple myeloma growth both in vitro and in vivo in response to bortezomib treatment .

mm.1r - btz - resistant cells transduced with shnt or shtxn1 were injected subcutaneously into 1.5 gy - irradiated nod / scid mice .
ten days later , the mice were treated with buffer control or bortezomib at 0.5 mg / kg , i.p. , twice weekly .
the intensity of expression was semi - quantitated using image - pro plus 6.0 software and adjusted to beta - actin .
error bars , standard error of the mean ( sem ) ; * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.005 , **** p < 0.001 mm.1r - btz cells transduced with shtxn1 or shtxn3 showed increased sensitivity to bortezomib after 48 and 72 h of incubation in comparison to mm.1r - btz cells transduced with mock control shnt ( fig. 2b , c ) .
a similar phenotype was observed in rpmi8226 / dox - btz cells transduced with shtxn1 or shtxn3 ( fig. 2e , f ) .
we further explored the effects of thioredoxin gene knockdown on overcoming bortezomib resistance in vivo .
mm.1r - btz cells transduced with shnt and mm.1r - btz cells transduced with shtxn1 were subcutaneously injected into 1.5 gy total body irradiated nod / scid mice .
ten days later when the tumor was established , the mice were then treated with or without bortezomib ( 0.5 mg / kg , i.p. , twice weekly ) .
tumor growth was measured .
mm.1r - btz cells transduced with shnt formed tumor mass at day 10 post inoculation and progressed rapidly up to 1100 mm3 at day 25 after xenograft into the immunodeficient mice .
treatment with bortezomib did not affect tumor growth in mm.1r - btz cells transduced with shnt .
on the other hand , mm.1r - btz cells transduced with shtxn responded to bortezomib treatment and the tumor sizes of mm.1r - btz - shtxn1 cells were significantly smaller in size ( 451.75 +/ - 38.82 mm3 at day 25 ) when compared with mm.1r - btz - shnt tumors ( fig. 2g , p = 0.0003 ) .
these data suggested that genetic deletion of thioredoxin could abolish the cell growth advantage in btz - resistant multiple myeloma cells and re - sensitize these cells to bortezomib treatment .
treatment with thioredoxin inhibitor ( px12 ) inhibits the growth of bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells and re - sensitizes bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells to bortezomib we tested the effects of thioredoxin inhibitor on the survival and drug resistance in bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells in vivo and in vitro .
px12 , a commercially available thioredoxin - specific inhibitor , binds to the cys73 residue of thioredoxin , causing it to become irreversibly thioalkylated and biologically inactive [ 21 ] .
we found that px12 inhibited the growth of mm.1r - btz and rpmi8226 / dox - btz cells in a dose - dependent manner ( fig. 3a , c ) .
when px12 was combined with bortezomib , it could re - sensitize bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells to bortezomib ( fig. 3b , d ) .
we next explored the pharmacological therapeutic potential of px12 for the treatment of btz - resistant multiple myeloma in vivo .
for this purpose , equal volumes of mm.1r - btz tumor cells were xenografted into the nod / scid mice .
two weeks later when the tumor was formed , mice were treated with control buffer , btz alone ( 0.5 mg / kg , twice per week injection , i.p. ) , px12 ( 12 mg / kg , twice per week , i.p. ) , or the combination for additional 4 weeks .
as shown in fig. 3e - g , the combination of px12 with btz treatment had marked effects against mm.1r - btz tumor growth in nod / scid mice .
taken together , our findings demonstrate the potential of targeting thioredoxin to re - sensitize btz - resistant multiple myeloma to bortezomib treatment. fig. 3 pharmacological inhibition of thioredoxin confers btz - resistant myeloma cells growth arrest both in vitro and in vivo .

for this experiment , mice were treated with either btz ( 0.5 mg / kg , twice weekly , i.p. ) , px12 ( 12 mg / kg , twice weekly , i.p. ) or the combination .
error bars , standard error of the mean ( sem ) ; * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.005 , **** p < 0.001 inhibition of thioredoxin induces mitophagy in bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells mitophagy , the autophagy of mitochondria , is a highly specific quality control process and is currently under extensive investigation for its role in carcinogenesis , cancer progression , and resistance to chemotherapy [ 18 ] .
thioredoxin is an antioxidant and is important in maintaining redox homeostasis .
we reasoned that inhibition of thioredoxin would affect mitochondrial function and lead to the activation of mitophagy .
we further hypothesized that px12 inhibited the growth of btz - resistant myeloma cells and re - sensitized btz - resistant myeloma cells to bortezomib through the activation of mitophagy .
to test this hypothesis , we measured several mitophagy activation markers , including the conversion from lc3bi to lc3bii , the expression of petn - induced putative kinase 1 ( pink1 ) , and mitochondria membrane potential ( deltapsim by jc - 1 ) as well as the fusion of mitochondria and autophagosome under transmission electron microscopy .
microtubule - associated protein 1a / 1b - light chain 3 ( lc3 ) is a soluble protein that is distributed ubiquitously in cells .
during autophagy , the cytosolic form of lc3 ( lc3 - i ) is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form lc3 - phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate ( lc3 - ii ) .
increase in lc3 - ii and / or reduction in lc3 - i has become a reliable marker for autophagy and autophagy - related process [ 22 ] .
mm.1r - btz cells and rpmi8226 / dox - btz cells were treated with bortezomib , px12 , or the combination of bortezomib and px12 , and lc3b - i and lc3b - ii were measured by western blot analysis .
as shown in fig. 4a , b , px12 treatment significantly increased lc3b - ii expression compared to that in control group .
the combination of px12 and bortezomib had further increased lc3b - ii expression in mm.1r - btz cells and rpmi8226 / dox - btz cells .
pink1 is a mitochondrial serine threonine kinase and serves as a mitophagy - specific marker [ 23 ] .
similar to lc3b - ii , px12 treatment increased pink1 expression and the combination of px12 , and bortezomib had augmented effect on pink1 expression in both mm.1r - btz - and rpmi8226 / dox - btz - resistant cells ( fig. 4a , b ) , indicating the activation of mitophagy. fig. 4 pharmacological inhibition of thioredoxin by px12 triggers mitophagy in btz - resistant multiple myeloma cells .

as shown in fig. 4c , there were fewer intracellular autophagic vacuoles in mm.1r - btz cells treated with bortezomib .
the mitochondrial was intact and separated from autophagosome .
on the other hand , there was a significant increase ( by 2.3 fold ) in the autophagic response in mm.1r - btz cells treated with the combination of px12 and btz , reflected by an increase in the amount of autophagy and lysosomes and the engulfed mitochondria by autophagosome ( fig. 4d ) .
additionally , we measured mitochondrial membrane potential ( deltapsim ) using mitoprobe staining in mm.1r - btz cells treated with btz alone , px12 , or the combination .
when mitochondrial membrane depolarizes ( i.e. , the loss of deltapsim ) , jc - 1 aggregates accumulate as demonstrated by the increase in the jc - 1 fluorescence intensity in q4 area ( fig. 4e - h ) .
px12 treatment as well as the combination of px12 and btz led to accelerated deltapsim loss .
the percentage of mm.1r - btz cells undergoing mitophagy ( the cells in q4 ) drastically increase from 12.6 % in bortezomib alone treatment group to 30.1 % in bortezomib + px12 combination group ( fig. 4f , h ) .
to determine if the combination of px12 and bortezomib induced mitophay in vivo in tumor xenograft model , the tumors as described in fig. 3 were harvested at the end of experiments and lc3b - i and pink1 expression were measured by western blot analysis .
as shown in fig. 4i , lc3b - i was significantly reduced in the px12 + btz treatment group .
furthermore , pink1 expression was significantly increased in px12 + btz treatment group .
these data demonstrated the activation of mitophagy in vivo with px12 + btz treatment , which was consistent with our in vitro findings .
to determine if mitophagy activation mediates the effects of px12 + btz combination in btz - resistant multiple myeloma cells , we used bafilomycin , a mitophagy inhibitor , to block mitophagy .
mm.1r - btz myeloma cells and rpmi8226 / dox - btz myeloma cells were treated with px12 , btz , or px12 + btz with or without 5 mum of bafilomycin .
as shown in fig. 4j , k , bafilomycin reversed the inhibitory effect mediated by px12 + btz treatment .
taken together , our results supported our hypothesis that thioredoxin inhibition enhances bortezomib sensitivity in btz - resistant myeloma cells via mitophagy activation .
similarly , genetic deletion of txn in mm.1r - and rpmi8226 / dox - btz myeloma cells resulted in increased expression of pink1 and lc3b - ii , and the mitochondrial membrane depolarization as measured by jc - 1 aggregates ( fig. 5 ) , consistent with the induction of mitophagy. fig. 5 genetic deletion of thioredoxin using shrna triggers mitophagy in btz - resistant multiple myeloma cells .

this network analysis predicts several key hubs associated with mitophagy and thioredoxin according to the literatures search .
figure 6a , b revealed the predicted key proteins including mtor , erk1 / 2 , and pink1 and their potential relationships with mitophagy .
we subsequently performed western blot analysis to validate these interactions .
our results indicated that although the total protein levels were not affected , the phosphorylation level of mtor ( fig. 6c , d ) and erk1 / 2 ( fig. 6e , f ) decreased dramatically in mm.1r - btz - and rpmi8226 / dox - btz - resistant cells treated with btz + px12 , when compared to those in the btz group. fig. 6 inhibition of thioredoxin decreases mtor and erk1 / 2 phosphorylation .

as shown in fig. 6g - j , the inhibitory effects of btz and px12 co - treatment were reversed by mhy1485 or tbhq in a dose - dependent manner .
thus , our data demonstrate that mtor and erk1 / 2 phosphorylation could play a role in the effects mediated by btz + px12 treatment in bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells .
high expression of txn is associated with poor prognosis in multiple myeloma patients to investigate the clinical significance of tnx in multiple myeloma , we interrogated publicly available microarray datasets and checked tnx mrna level expression between normal plasma cells and multiple myeloma using the oncomine database .
as shown in fig. 7 , tnx expression was significantly increased in the cd138 + plasma cells of patients with myeloma compared to normal plasma cells and tonsillar lymphoid tissues in two different datasets [ 24 , 25 ] ( fig. 7a , b ). fig. 7 high expression of txn is associated with poor prognosis in patients with myeloma .

f - g kaplan - meyer analysis of overall survival in mulligan ( f ) and arkansas ( g ) myeloma microarray .
survival analysis was performed using a log - rank test .
* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.005 , **** p < 0.001 to determine the expression of thioredoxin in bortezomib relapsed / refractory myeloma patients , we isolated cd138 + cells and cd138 - cells from untreated newly diagnosed myeloma patients ( n = 3 ) , myeloma patients who have just completed bortezomib containing regimen induction therapy with residual myeloma cells ( n = 5 ) , and relapsed / refractory myeloma patients ( n = 5 ) who had previous exposure and resistant to bortezomib .
when compared to the cd138 - cells , tnx mrna was significantly increased in the cd138 + plasma cells , suggesting that txn is upregulated in myeloma cells in comparison to non - myelomatous cells of the same patient ( fig. 7c ) .
furthermore , consistent with the findings in our adaptive btz - resistant myeloma cell lines , txn expression demonstrated a trend for elevation in cd138 + myeloma cells after treatment with bortezomib or being refractory to bortezomib ( fig. 7d ) tnx expression has no notable difference in cd138 - non - myelomatous cells among new diagnosed , treated , and refractory myeloma patients ( fig. 7e ) .
in addition , we analyzed the correlation between thioredoxin expression and overall survival using the mulligan et al .
[ 26 ] and arkansas [ 27 ] microarray datasets .
compared to myeloma patients with low txn expression , patients with higher txn expression was associated with a shorter overall survival ( fig. 7f , g ) .
altogether , these findings demonstrated the clinical significance for txn in myeloma , especially in bortezomib - resistant multiple myeloma .
discussion multiple myeloma remains an incurable disease and nearly all myeloma patients will eventually develop resistance to currently available therapeutic agents including proteasome inhibitors .
bortezomib is the first proteasome inhibitor used in the treatment of myeloma , and it has dramatically changed the landscape of the care of patients with multiple myeloma .
bortezomib can induce deeper response , lead to higher response rate , and extend the survival of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and of patients with relapsed myeloma .
unfortunately , development of drug resistance to bortezomib is inevitable and poses a major challenge in our continuous improvement of clinical outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma .
therefore , it is critical and imperative to elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with or driving the development of bortezomib resistance .
this information is essential in our efforts to overcome or re - sensitize bortezomib resistance .
in the current study , we generated over a period of 1.5 years several adaptive bortezomib - resistant myeloma cell lines ( fig. 1 ) .
we have also analyzed and compared the expression of thioredoxin in cd138 + myeloma cells from newly diagnosed myeloma patients , myeloma patients that were treated with bortezomib containing regimen , and relapsed / refractory myeloma patients who had prior exposure to bortezomib ( fig. 7 ) .
we have demonstrated that over - expression of thioredoxin was associated with the development of drug resistance to bortezomib .
thioredoxin was previously found to promote tumor growth through inhibition of apoptosis , reduce sensitivity of the tumor to drugs [ 28 - 30 ] , and be associated with poor prognosis [ 29 ] .
raninga et al. has recently shown that compared to normal plasma cells , multiple myeloma cells had higher intrinsic oxidative stress and higher levels of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase expression and that thioredoxin over - expression was associated with resistance to nf - kappabeta inhibitors [ 28 ] .
using comparative proteomic profiling , dytfeld et al. showed upregulation of thioredoxin expression in bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells [ 29 ] .
our current studies were consistent with and validated these observations .
importantly , our current studies advance significantly from those studies .
we indeed showed that inhibition of thioredoxin by shrna knockdown or pharmacological approach with px12 could re - sensitize the bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells to bortezomib in vitro and in vivo in myeloma xenograft mouse models ( figs. 2 and 3 ) .
mechanistically , we have demonstrated that inhibition of thioredoxin re - sensitize bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells through the activation of mitophagy .
our studies provide molecular rationale and justification for targeting thioredoxin in the treatment of bortezomib relapsed / refractory myeloma .
we found that px12 - sensitized btz - resistant myeloma cells to bortezomib through the activation of mitophagy .
we confirmed the activation of mitophagy using several methods including lc3 western blotting , pink1 expression analysis , measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential , and the visualization of mitochondrial - autophagosome fusion with transmission electron microscopy ( fig. 4 ) .
using bafilomycin to inhibit mitophagy , we have demonstrated the important role of mitophagy in px12 - mediated effects .
thioredoxin - specific shrna knockdown revealed similar findings on the induction of mitophagy ( fig. 5 ) .
thioredoxin and thioredoxin system maintain the intracellular redox homeostasis by scavenging ros and regulating other redox proteins [ 31 , 32 ] .
inhibition of thioredoxin increases intracellular oxidative stress [ 33 , 34 ] .
increased production of ros stimulates the initiation of mitophagy [ 28 ] .
mitophagy is a cellular self - cannibalization process that captures and digests mitochondrial in lysosomes [ 35 ] .
the role of mitophagy in tumorigenesis remains a topic of debate .
on one hand , mitophagy is activated in transformed cells and is beneficial for tumor maintenance and progression .
on the other hand , excessive autophagy can act as a tumor - suppressive mechanism possibly through initiation of cell death or senescence [ 36 - 40 ] .
the outcome of mitophagy activation in cancer depends on the stage of the disease , cell types , oncogenic drivers , and the intensity of the activation signal [ 35 , 41 , 42 ] .
mitophagy is also found to be involved in chemoresistance .
our current study suggested that reduced level of mitophagy is associated with the development of drug resistance in multiple myeloma cells and that activation of mitophagy could re - sensitize myeloma cells to bortezomib killing .
our study provides evidence for future exploring mitophagy pathway for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma .
in the current study , we delineated the molecular events involved in the px12 + btz - induced mitophagy in mm cells .
we described 2 signal proteins ( p - mtor and p - erk1 / 2 ) that may play a role in px12 + btz - induced mitophagy and anti - myeloma effects in mm cells .
using chemical activator of mtor and erk , we demonstrated an important role of mtor and erk in the anti - myeloma effects induced by thioredoxin inhibition .
previous studies have demonstrated that various signal pathways are involved in autophagy , including pi3k / akt / mtor , erk1 / 2 and nf - kappab .
mtor ( mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase ) has been shown to control multiple cellular functions such as gene transcription , protein formation , cell proliferation and senescence and cell metabolism [ 43 ] .
mtor pathway is the master regulator of cellular metabolism and has been shown to be the major pathway regulating mitophagy .
akt was previously reported to control mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy .
in our system , we did not observe changes in akt expression or phosphorylation after px12 treatment .
in addition , we found that treatment with px12 resulted in desphosphorylation of erk1 / 2 .
our study suggested that inhibition of thioredoxin affects several molecular pathways that are important in the regulation of mitophagy .
erk1 ( p44 ) and erk2 ( p42 ) are two isoforms of erk that are activated downstream of ras in response to extracellular cues .
erk has been shown to induce autophagy in response to a number of anti - tumor / cytotoxic agents [ 44 , 45 ] .
inhibition of erk was associated with a decrease in autophagy and increased cellular sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf ) in breast cancer mcf - 7 cells [ 46 ] .
interestingly , our data showed that dephosphorylation of erk1 / 2 appears to be associated with the induction of mitophagy in btz - resistant mm cells .
additional studies are needed to further understand the erk1 / 2 pathway in btz resistance in multiple myeloma .
the discrepancy between reduced activity of erk1 / 2 in our current study and the findings in breast cancer could be due to different cancer type or to different drug sensitivity .
conclusions in summary , we showed that upregulation of thioredoxin expression correlated with the development of bortezomib drug resistance in multiple myeloma .
inhibition of thioredoxin by shrna or thioredoxin inhibitor re - sensitized bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells to bortezomib treatment .
we further showed that the combination of bortezomib and thioredoxin inhibitor suppressed the growth of bortezomib - resistant myeloma cells through mitophagy activation .
our study provides new insights in the molecular mechanisms associated with bortezomib drug resistance .
our work was the first to demonstrate the novel role of mitophagy in multiple myeloma treatment .

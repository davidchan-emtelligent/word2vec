the remaining ~ 10 % occur as a result of malignant progression from lower grade astrocytic tumours ( i.e. , secondary gbm ) .
although there are no certain causative environmental agents , prior radiation exposure may play a role .
we report on a patient who had been treated six years prior for a vestibular schwannoma with high - dose conventional radiotherapy and subsequently developed a rapidly fatal glioblastoma at the same location .
the diagnosis was confirmed by routine histopathology as well as more advanced techniques , such as whole genome copy number analysis .

introduction the use of radiotherapy in benign intracranial neoplasms is proven to be efficacious and is well - tolerated in the short - term .
however , longer term risks , although remote , are present .
these risks include radiation - induced malignancy , radionecrosis , and radiation - related neurocognitive decline .
this should be carefully discussed with the patient , particularly if the patient is young .
we present the diagnostic and management dilemma of a patient with a histology - proven vestibular schwannoma who was treated with conventional radiotherapy six years prior and subsequently developed a rapidly fatal brainstem glioblastoma ( gbm ) at the same location .
case presentation the patient had a history of vestibular schwannoma ( vs ) at the age of 37 , six years prior .
he had no family history or clinical signs of neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2 .
due to the large size of the lesion , he was treated with a course of preoperative external - beam radiotherapy 66 gray ( gy ) in 33 fractions .
this was followed by a planned left occipital craniotomy and tumour excision .
histology was consistent with a benign vestibular schwannoma .
postoperatively , he lost hearing function in the left ear but remained stable in clinical follow - up. he then complained of progressive unsteady gait and headache for several months .
a magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) scan revealed a large enhancing extra - axial mass ( 5.5 x 6.1 x 5.2 cm ) within the cerebellopontine angle ( cpa ) extending into the left internal auditory canal , in keeping with recurrent vs ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 magnetic resonance imaging at time of presentation a ) axial t1 - weighted contrast - enhanced image ; b ) coronal t1 - weighted contrast - enhanced image ; c ) sagittal t1 - weighted contrast - enhanced image this lesion caused a mass effect upon the brainstem and cerebellum , and the associated oedema caused effacement of the fourth ventricle and mild tonsillar herniation .
there was also a pseudomeningocele at the left cerebellopontine cistern .
clinically , he had nystagmus to the left and cranial nerve ( cn ) palsies on the left involving cn v , vii , viii , ix , and x. there was reduced sensation to light touch and cold with pain sensation on the right side .
based on radiological appearance , it was uncertain whether this could be a malignant transformation of the vestibular schwannoma .
in view of the mass effect and aggressive radiological appearance , the patient underwent craniotomy and surgical resection .
intraoperative findings revealed a grayish vascular tumour adherent to the dura and pseudomeningocele .
the tumour was maximally debulked up to the brainstem posteromedially .
histology revealed a high - grade glial tumour composed of hypercellular sheets of anaplastic cells within a fibrillary background with numerous mitoses , areas of necrosis , and microvascular proliferation ( figure 2 ) .
figure 2 histopathological examination of resected tumour histological examination revealed a highly cellular tumour with marked nuclear atypia and numerous mitoses ( yellow arrows ) in fibrillary background .
necrosis and microvascular proliferation were also present ( not shown ) .
the tumour cells were positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein ( gfap ) and retained atrx by immunohistochemistry .
they were negative for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( idh1 r132h ) and the h3k27m antibody .
whole genome copy number analysis using the oncoscan ( r ) platform ( affymetrix , santa clara , ca , usa ) showed the absence of 1p19q whole arm codeletion and mosaic gain of chromosome 7p ( figure 3 ) .
figure 3 whole genome copy number analysis whole genome copy number analysis using oncoscan affymetrix platform showed complex genetic aberrations , in particular , the absence of 1p19q whole arm codeletion and gain of chromosome 7p .
there was also a gain in chromosome 10q .
no associated chromosome 10q loss was found .
the features were those of a gbm .
o6 - methylguanine - dna methyltransferase ( mgmt ) promoter methylation was not detected .
in view of the histological findings , a spine mri was performed to screen for drop metastasis .
this revealed a small intrathecal enhancing nodule at the right side of the cauda equina at the level of l1 .
the differential diagnoses for this lesion were schwannoma or drop metastasis .
as the patient was asymptomatic for this lesion , the clinical decision was made for close monitoring for progression .
the patient continued with poor functional status postoperatively , and hence , he was offered palliative re - irradiation alone .
in view of the previous high dose received by the brainstem , a dose of 35 gy in 10 fractions was delivered using highly conformal arc therapy .
repeat mri brain done three months later showed the enhancing mass to be stable in size but with progression in the subependymal space and worsening hydrocephalus ( figure 4 ) .
figure 4 magnetic resonance imaging performed post - surgery and re - irradiation a ) axial t1 - weighted contrast - enhanced image ; b ) coronal t1 - weighted contrast - enhanced image ; c ) sagittal t1 - weighted contrast - enhanced image consequently , the patient underwent an elective third ventriculostomy to relieve the pressure .
unfortunately , he continued to decline functionally and passed away four months after initial diagnosis .
discussion this is a case of radiation - induced glioma ( rig ) in a young patient , which fulfills cahan 's criteria [ 1 ] .
the second histologically distinct tumour arising from the original radiation field was also confirmed by genome copy number to be an aggressive glioma with poor prognostic features .
although this technique was helpful in confirming the diagnosis , there are no known markers to distinguish radiation - induced gbm from primary gbm. from the presentation of symptoms arising from the second tumour , this case was challenging in terms of diagnosis and treatment strategy .
malignant transformation of a vs is exceedingly uncommon [ 2 ] , and the risk is known to be higher in nf - 2 - associated vs [ 3 ] .
the majority of the cases of malignant transformation appear to be sarcomatous [ 3 ] .
a recent review has suggested that the risk of secondary malignancy after stereotactic radiosurgery to be 0.04 % at 15 years [ 4 ] .
in comparison , the risk after conventionally fractionated radiotherapy appears to be slightly higher as reported in a series of patients with pituitary adenoma who received radiotherapy .
the cumulative risk of secondary brain tumours was 2.0 % and 8.5 % for 10 - year and 30 - year intervals , respectively [ 5 ] .
approximately half of these were meningiomas .
in another series , the risk of rig was estimated by tsang , et al. to be 1.7 % and 2.7 % in the 10 - year and 15 - year intervals , respectively [ 6 ] .
limited studies have shown no distinguishing histologic and molecular characteristics of rig from primary gbm [ 7 ] .
although we were unable to prove pathologically that this patient had rig , other supporting features included his age of presentation and location of the tumour .
the incidence of gbm peaks in the 75 - 84 age group [ 8 ] and is uncommon in the cerebellopontine angle , as seen in our patient .
paulino , et al. have suggested that patients with rig , who undergo re - irradiation , have a longer survival than the patients who do not [ 9 ] .
this is understandable due to the dose - response seen with glioma [ 10 ] .
however , many clinicians may be reluctant to offer re - irradiation to the full dose , given the potential cumulative neurotoxicity .
our patient was particularly challenging to manage as the brainstem had previously been irradiated to tolerance ( 54 gy ) .
advanced techniques , such as proton or heavy ion therapy , may be useful in re - treatment of similar cases .
future research in molecular profiling may uncover targetable mutations present in rig , which would provide more therapeutic opportunities for this group of patients .
conclusions the management of rig remains challenging .
the risk of rig , although low , should be carefully considered before patients undergo radiotherapy .
this is particularly so for young patients with benign pathology who are expected to have a normal life expectancy .
furthur research in the molecular profiling of rig and advanced re - irradiation techniques may help in the management of this group of patients .
the authors have declared that no competing interests exist .

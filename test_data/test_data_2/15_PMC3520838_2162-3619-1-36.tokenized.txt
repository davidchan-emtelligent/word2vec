cd19 is classified as a type i transmembrane protein , with a single transmembrane domain , a cytoplasmic c - terminus , and extracellular n - terminus .
cd19 is a biomarker for normal and neoplastic b cells , as well as follicular dendritic cells .
cd19 is critically involved in establishing intrinsic b cell signaling thresholds through modulating both b cell receptor - dependent and independent signaling .
cd19 functions as the dominant signaling component of a multimolecular complex on the surface of mature b cells , alongside complement receptor cd21 , and the tetraspanin membrane protein cd81 ( tapa - 1 ) , as well as cd225. through study of cd19 transgenic and knockout mouse models , it becomes clear that cd19 plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between humoral , antigen - induced response and tolerance induction .
this review also summarized latest clinical development of cd19 antibodies , anti - b4 - br ( an immunotoxin conjugate ) , blinatumomab ( bite ) , and sar3419 ( hub4 - dm4 ) , a novel antibody - drug conjugate .
rituximab , the first monoclonal antibody against cd20 molecule , has revolutionized lymphoma therapy [ 1,2 ] .
more monoclonal antibodies targeting different antigens are being developed for lymphoma therapy [ 3 ] .
cd19 is specifically expressed in normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells .
this review summarizes the molecular structure and functions of cd19 antigen as well as the clinical development of cd19 monoclonal antibodies for lymphoma therapy .
cd19 gene and antigen the human cd19 antigen is a 95 kd transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin ( ig ) superfamily [ 4,5 ] .
it is encoded by the 7.41 kilobite cd19 gene located on the short arm of chromosome 16 , 16p11.2 [ 6 ] .
the gene contains 15 exons and codes for the cd19 molecule with 556 amino acids ( figure 1 ) .
there are more than one mrna transcripts , though only two transcript isoforms have been isolated in vivo [ 5 - 7 ] .
structurally , the gene contains an unusually short 5 ' - untranslated region .
the proximal cd19 promoter lacks a tata box , and its major start sites are found within 50 bp of the initiation codon [ 8 ] .
figure 1 cd19 molecular structure .
cd19 is a type i one - pass transmembrane protein .
the two extracellular c2 ig - like domains are separated by a small helical non - ig domain with possible disulfide links .
the highly conserved , 242 amino acid cytoplasmic domain includes multiple tyrosine residues .
three key tyrosine residues are shown with their associated signaling kinases and molecules .
cd19 is classified as a type i transmembrane protein , with a single transmembrane domain , a cytoplasmic c - terminus , and extracellular n - terminus .
no significant homology exists between cd19 and other known proteins [ 9 ] .
the extracellular element contains two c2 - type ig - like domains divided by a smaller potential disulfide linked non - ig - like domain , as well as n - linked carbohydrate addition sites ( figure 2 ) .
the highly conserved cytoplasmic domain consists of 242 amino acids with nine tyrosine residues near the c - terminus [ 9 - 11 ] .
multiple studies have come to suggest that the biologic functions of cd19 are dependent on three cytoplasmic tyrosine residues - y391 , y482 and y513 .
experiments have shown that substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine at two of the positions , y482 and y513 , leads to inhibited phosphorylation of the other seven tyrosines [ 12 - 14 ] .
figure 2 cd19 associated signaling complex .
antigen - c3d complexes can engage the cd19 / 21 complex in both a bcr - independent or bcr - dependent fashion .
the cd19 complex includes complement receptor cd21 , which binds c3d - modified antigen .
kinetics of cd19 expression cd19 was first identified as the b4 antigen of human b lymphocytes through the use of anti - b4 monoclonal antibody ( mab ) against cd19 .
it is specifically expressed in normal and neoplastic b cells , as well as follicular dendritic cells [ 9,11,15 ] .
during b cell lymphopoiesis , the surface expression of cd19 first takes place around the time of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement [ 9 ] .
during this process , pax5 is required for the normal expression of cd19 .
this was proven by the fact that lymphoid progenitors in pax5 knockout mice arrest at the pro - b cell stage .
the surface density of cd19 is highly regulated throughout b cell development and maturation , until the loss of expression during terminal plasma cell differentiation [ 9,11 ] .
cd19 expression in mature b cells are 3 - fold higher than that found in immature b cells , with slightly higher expression in b1 cells than in b2 ( conventional b ) cells [ 11,12 ] .
cd19 is one of the most reliable surface biomarker for b cells .
it is expressed from pre - b cells until the terminal differentiation to plasma cells .
physiological function cd19 is critically involved in establishing intrinsic b cell signaling thresholds through modulating both b cell receptor ( bcr ) - dependent and independent signaling [ 16,17 ] .
it plays roles in the antigen - independent development as well as the immunoglobulin - induced activation of b cells .
cd19 is thus critical for the body to mount an optimal immune response .
cd19 works in complex with the bcr and other surface molecules to allow both direct and indirect recruitment and binding of various down - stream protein kinases [ 6,18 ] .
the protein kinases that interact with the cd19 complex include those belonging to the src family ( lyn , fyn ) , ras family , abl , btk , adapter molecules ( vav , grb2 ) , and pi3k [ 9 ] .
more recently , it has been recognized that cd19 is required for optimal mhc class ii - mediated signaling , through its modulation of tyrosine phosphorylation and akt kinase signaling [ 19 ] .
cd19 functions as the dominant signaling component of a multimolecular complex on the surface of mature b cells , alongside complement receptor cd21 ( cd2 ) , and the tetraspanin membrane protein cd81 ( tapa - 1 ) , as well as cd225 [ 9,13,18,20 ] ( figure 2 ) .
the cd19 complex functions to decrease the threshold for receptor - dependent signaling through modulating both intrinsic and receptor - induced signals [ 11,12,18 ] .
cd19 acts as a critical co - receptor for bcr signal transduction [ 13,21 ] .
as bcr signaling requires protein tyrosine kinase ( ptk ) activation , cd19 recruits and amplifies the activation of src - family protein tyrosine kinases such as lyn and fyn [ 9,13,22 ] .
upon bcr activation , cd19 also enhances bcr - induced signaling crucial for b cell expansion , through recruitment and activation of pi3k and downstream akt kinases [ 23 ] .
the cd19 / cd21 complex is also capable of , independent of the bcr , reacting and binding to activated complement fragment c3d .
this complex subsequently translocates into membrane " lipid rafts " domains , where tyrosine phosphorylated cd19 can then interact with co - localized kinases in the membrane to modulate bcr signaling [ 24 ] .
normally , more cd19 is found associated with cd21 than in complex with bcr , and a dramatic increase in b - cell activation results from the simultaneous binding of surface antigen by b - cell ig and of c3d by cd21 .
studies also showed that cd19 does not require cd21 for signal transduction , and cd19 / 21 complex signaling is induced by the binding of c3d to cd21 [ 13,14 ] .
cd81 functions as a part of the tetraspanin web as well as a chaperone protein .
it provides docking sites for molecules involved in various signal transduction pathways , and is important for the expression of cd19 .
cd19 expression in b cells of cd81 - / - mice were found to be ~ 30 - 50 % of that in wild type ( wt ) mice , while expression of cd21 and the bcr were at their respective wt levels [ 25,26 ] .
cd19 / cd38 have been shown to co - localize in lipid rafts and physically interact with another surface antigen receptor , cd38 , in mice b cell .
the two receptors have been shown to be a part of the b cell signaling complex [ 24,25 ] .
in vivo , cd81 - deficient mice show reduced cd19 expression and overall b cell signaling .
in the absence of cd81 expression , cd19 expression is halved [ 11 ] .
cd19 is thought to play duel roles in b cell activation .
first , it functions as an adaptor protein to recruit cytoplasmic signaling proteins to the membrane .
experiments have shown that cd19 tyrosine residues are phosphorylated .
the tyrosine phosphorylated cd19 can recruit sh2 domain - containing cytosolic proteins after ligation with the bcr .
the second role of cd19 is as a signal subunit for the cd19 / cd21 complex when colligated with the bcr , where ag bearing complement enhances b - cell activation via bcr - cd19 / cd21 coligation [ 4,12,21,27 ] .
in addition , cd19 is involved with , though not essential , in the regulation of bone marrow development through its actions on bone marrow cells via altering bcr signals [ 12 ] .
others have proposed a critical role for cd19 in the process of b cell development from their early differentiation events in the bone marrow to late maturation steps in the spleen [ 13 ] .
in developing b cells , cd19 is capable of modulating signal thresholds independent of the bcr .
in fact , cd19 signaling may play a role in controlling the progression of early pre - b to small , resting pre - b cells in the bone marrow by associating with components of the pre - bcr .
cd19 transgenic mice ( hcd19tg ) cd19 overexpression has been studied through use of hcd19tg mice which express a human cd19 transgene .
phenotypic analysis of hcd19tg mice show that cd19 overexpression is associated with a dramatic reduction (> 80 %) in the number of peripheral b cells , primarily due to impaired generation and early development of immature precursors in the bone marrow .
b cells of hcd19tg show a gene dosage dependent increase in proliferation in response to mitogens such as lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) , with homozygotes showing a much more dramatic increases in proliferation than that seen in cd19tg +/ - heterozygous mice .
b cells from hcd19tg +/+ mice also showed higher background proliferation , and survived longer than control cells in culture without any mitogen stimulation .
although hcd19tg mice have significantly reduced numbers of peripheral b cells , they show an overall increase in serum immunoglobulin levels (~ 40 % increase ) , but skewed responses of different immunoglobulin isotypes : igg2b levels increased by 168 % , igg3 levels decreased by 77 % , and iga levels remaining relatively unchanged .
cd19 overexpression therefore increases b cell sensitivity to transmembrane signaling and augments the overall susceptibility of b cells to induced differentiation .
the increase in b cell surface receptor expression may feedback to inhibit the development of bone marrow b precursors , linking overexpression to the observed decrease in peripheral b cells .
cd19 - / - mice in contrast to hcd19tg mice , cd19 deficient mice is associated with defects in later stages of b cell growth and maturation that take place in the spleen and peripheral lymph tissues .
cd19 deficiency had no significant effect on the number of b cell precursor in the bone marrow , nor on the size and morphology of b cells .
cd19 - / - mice instead show dramatic reductions in the total number and frequency of peripheral and splenic b cells , especially of b1 cells , a b cell subtype found in the peritoneal cavity that normally express higher igm levels than conventional b ( b2 ) cells , and low levels of igd .
the b cells obtained from the peritoneum of cd19 - / - mice predominantly expressed high levels of both igm and igd .
the proliferative capacity of b cells in cd19 - / - mice is consistently reduced in response to stimulation by a range of lps ( mitogen ) concentration , as well as in response to antibody cross - linking of surface igm .
cd19 is not required for clonal expansion , and b cells in cd19 deficient mice are able to proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells , albeit at reduced rates , consistent across all mitogen concentrations tested .
unlike the skewed response of ig isotypes in hcd19tg mice , levels of all immunoglobulin isotypes were significantly reduced in the cd19 - / - mice .
the overall 77 % reduction in ig levels is primarily contributed to changes in the frequency of b cell differentiation , not the decrease of peripheral b cell numbers .
in particular , the dramatic reduction of igg1 ( 86 % decrease ) and igg2a ( 84 % decrease ) hints that interactions between b cell and t cell , which facilitate these ig isotypes , are particularly affected in cd19 deficiency .
the reduced susceptibility to transmembrane signaling and lowered rates of proliferation in cd19 - / - mice leads to decreased formation of second follicles , germinal centers , and overall reduced ability of effective humoral immunity in response to t cell dependent antigen [ 28 ] .
in cd19 - deficient mice , loss of splenic marginal zone b cells has been observed , as well as significant deficiencies in specific peripheral b - cell subsets [ 12,13 ] .
furthermore , since cd19 is important both for b cell activation of t cell dependent antigen , as well as for b cell maturation and memory cell selection , mature cd19 - / - b cells are profoundly deficient in responding to antigens that require t - cell help [ 13,27 ] .
selectively silencing cd19 expression by sirna knockdown experiments leads not only to complete inhibition of cd19 - mediated calcium fluxes , but also a total halt in cd38 signaling , without affecting the surface expression of cd38 [ 24,25 ] .
these data provide additional support that cd19 is the main co - receptor in human b cells .
the critical importance has garnered cd19 the title of being a rheostat - for its crucial roles in the normal expansion and function of the peripheral b - cell pool [ 9 ] .
it contributes to maintaining the balance between humoral , antigen - induced response and tolerance induction , as even small modulations in cd19 expression can impact b cell signaling thresholds and dramatically affect the sensitivity and specificity of b cell mediated immunity [ 14,28,29 ] .
disease association the importance of cd19 can be seen through case studies as well as various studies of cd19 - deficient mice .
cd19 - deficient humans and mice exhibit hyporesponsiveness to transmembrane signals , and weak t cell - dependent humoral responses , leading to an overall impaired humoral immune responses [ 9,17 ] .
homozygous frame shift mutations of the cd19 gene have been documented to result in truncation of the three key cytoplasmic tyrosine residues .
patients with this type of cd19 gene mutations showed normal numbers of precursor and total b cells , but decreased numbers of cd27 + memory b cells and cd5 + b cells .
their b cells exhibit normal levels of cd81 and cd225 , but decreased cd21 and very low to undetectable cd19 .
the patients develop hypogammaglobulinemia , showing impaired antigen - induced bcr response and poor antibody response to rabies vaccination , as well as increased susceptibility to infection [ 18 ] .
studies showed that autoimmunity in cd19 transgenic mice depends on mhc class ii expression [ 19 ] .
this led to hypothesis that cd19 may play an important role in in vivo modulation of mhc class ii expression and signaling .
such discoveries have led to mounting interest in cd19 as a potential immunotherapy target for various autoimmune disorders , including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis .
though it is not known if cd19 contributes directly to b cell carcinogenesis , its expression is highly conserved on most b cell tumors [ 17 ] .
it is expressed in most acute lymphoblastic leukemias ( all ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemias ( cll ) and b cell lymphomas [ 30 ] .
in fact , the majority of b cell malignancies express cd19 at normal to high levels ( 80 % of all , 88 % of b cell lymphomas and 100 % of b cell leukemias ) [ 9 ] .
other b cell malignancies , in contrast , show diminished cd19 levels [ 31,32 ] .
although cd19 expression is observed in normal plasma cells , malignant plasma ( myeloma ) cells isolated from multiple myeloma patients have been shown to lack cd19 expression , while isolates from pre - myeloma patients show a mix of both cd19 - and cd19 + plasma cells [ 33 ] .
cd19 levels can potentially be useful as a diagnostic tool in distinguishing certain lymphoma subtypes .
follicular lymphoma , for example , has lower cd19 level more frequently than any other lymphoma subtypes .
low cd19 is also more common in cd10 - positive than in cd10 - negative diffuse large b cell lymphoma ( dlbcl ) [ 31 ] .
interestingly , cd19 , though a b cell hallmark , has also been observed in cases of myeloid malignancies , including in 2 % of aml cases .
rare cases of cd 19 - expressing myeloblastic leukemia ( aml - m2 ) in fact lack any myeloid surface antigens [ 34,35 ] .
recent studies have constructed one model of lymphomagenesis involving cd19 and the proto - oncogene c - myc .
a positive feedback pathway in which upregulated cd19 expression and phosphorylation , induced by constitutive c - myc overexpression , serve to further promote and stabilize c - myc signaling , whose downstream effectors include important cell cycle regulators like cyclin d2 .
dysregulation in these regulators subsequently enhance lymphomagenesis .
using transgenic c - myc mice , these studies have shown that cd19 expression , although not required for the malignant transformation in c - myc - derived lymphomas , accelerates lymphomagenesis and is associated with increased disease severity .
on the other hand , c - myc transgenic mice with cd19 deficiency , as compared to those expressing cd19 , exhibited reduced malignancies and significantly higher (> 80 %) increase in survival and life spans [ 17 ] .
cd19 monoclonal antibodies for lymphoma and leukemia therapy cd19 monoclonal antibodies have been explored for lymphoma therapy .
unconjugated mouse igg2a anti - cd19 monoclonal antibody ( mab ) was studied in six patients with progressive b cell lymphoma .
the dosage ranged from 225 mg to 1000 mg. transient reduction of tumor cells were seen .
one patient achieved partial remission twice [ 36 ] .
following the study , the mab was combined with interleukin - 2 to treat 7 patients with low grade lymphoma .
more tumor cell reduction was achieved in this study [ 37 ] .
an immunotoxin conjugate of anti - b4 - blocked ricin ( anti - b4 - br ) was studied as adjuvant therapy for patients with b - cell non - hodgkin 's lymphoma ( nhl ) in complete remission ( cr ) after autologous bone marrow transplantation [ 38 ] .
forty - nine patients post - autologous stem cell transplantation received the immunotoxin at a dose of 30 microg / kg daily for 7 days by continuous i.v. infusion.thirty one patients received two or more courses at 14 - day intervals .
the mean serum level on day 7 with the first course was found to be 0.77 +/ - 0.41 nm. twenty three patients developed human antimouse antibody and / or human anti - ricin antibody at a median of 22 days from the initiation of anti - b4 - br therapy ( range , 11 - 100 days ) .
a bi - specific t - cell engaging ( bite ( r )) antibody , blinatumomab , was engineered to direct cytotoxic t - cells to b - cells expressing cd19 .
an open - label , multicenter , single - arm , exploratory phase ii trial was conducted to evaluate efficacy and safety of bite in adult patients with relapsed / refractory b - precursor all .
blinatumomab was given at 15 mug / m2 / day as continuous intravenous infusion for 28 - days followed by a 14 - day rest .
a total of up to 5 cycles of blinatumomab treatment was given to responding patients at one of three dose levels .
a total of 18 patients were enrolled at the last update in 2011 .
twelve out of 18 patients ( rr 67 %) have achieved a complete remission within the first 2 cycles .
these responders included 3 patients with t ( 4 ; 11 ) and 1 patient with ph - positive b - precursor all .
four responders proceeded to allogeneic hsct .
major adverse events included pyrexia , chills , disseminated intravascular coagulation / cytokine release syndrome leading to treatment discontinuation , as well as fully reversible cns serious adverse events .
adding a cytoreductive pre - phase and implementing a lower initial dosing at 5 mug / m2 / day in cohort 2a during the first week eliminated further treatment discontinuations .
there were no treatment related deaths .
a maintenance dose of 30mug / m2 / day in cohort 2b increased the number of adverse events .
therefore , cohort 2a was selected for further clinical development in this patient population [ 39 ] .
sar3419 ( hub4 - dm4 ) is a novel antibody - drug conjugate [ 40 ] .
a humanized igg1 anti - cd19 monoclonal antibody was conjugated to a maytansine derivative dm4 through a cleavable disulfide - bond linker [ 41 ] .
dm4 , the maytansine derivative , is a potent tubulin inhibitor , which is specifically directed to cd19 - positive b cells by the anti - cd19 mab .
a phase i , open - label , dose - escalation study of sar3419 as a single agent was conducted as a first - in - human trial [ 42 ] .
sar3419 was administered intravenously every three weeks for up to six cycles to 39 patients with relapsed cd19 + b - cell lymphoma .
dose levels ranged from 10 to 270 mg / m2 .
the dose - limiting toxicities occurred in seven patients .
these included severe blurred vision associated with microcystic epithelial corneal changes .
the maximal tolerated dose ( mtd ) was 160 mg / m2 .
twenty - six patients ( 74 %) showed tumor response ; six of those patients achieved pr or cr. in particular , seven ( 47 %) of 15 patients who had rituximab - refractory disease had tumor shrinkage .
sar3419 had an elimination half - life in the range of 3 to 7 days .
therefore , sar3419 was shown to have a safe profile when administered to patients with relapsed b - cell lymphoma with the mtd at 160 mg / m2 .
conclusion and future directions cd19 is a biomarker for b cells .
cd19 functions as the dominant signaling component of a multimolecular complex on the surface of mature b cells , alongside complement receptor cd21 , and the tetraspanin membrane protein cd81 ( tapa - 1 ) , as well as cd225 .
cd19 plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between humoral , antigen - induced response and tolerance induction .
clinical development of cd19 monoclonal antibodies , anti - b4 - br , bite , and sar3419 ( hub4 - dm4 ) are still in the early phase .
it is forseeable that cd19 mab will be widely studied for therapies of lymphoma , leukemia and autoimmune disorders. through molecularly engineered chimeric antigen receptor , cd19 directed immunotherapy for refractory cll is promising [ 43,44 ] .
further study in controlled trial with more patients will be critical to validate this approach .

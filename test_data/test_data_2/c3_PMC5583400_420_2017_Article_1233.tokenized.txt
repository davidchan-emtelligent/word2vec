purpose to investigate the relationships between symptoms compatible with the sick building syndrome ( sbs ) in adults and building dampness and ventilation in single - family houses .
methods within the swedish betsi study , a national sample of single - family houses were inspected by professional building experts , and adults living in the houses answered a questionnaire on sbs .
relationships between building factors and sbs were analysed using logistic regression .
results of the respondents , 23 % reported having had weekly sbs symptoms during the last three months .
a large proportion of houses exhibited building or construction problems .
in total , 40 % of houses had dampness problems in the foundation , and this was related to a higher prevalence of both mucous and dermal symptoms , and any sbs symptoms .
furthermore , high air humidity was related to more symptoms , with the relationship with absolute humidity being stronger than that with relative humidity or moisture load .
symptoms were also more prevalent in houses with a high u value , reflecting a poor thermal insulation .
compared to natural ventilation , living in a house with mechanical supply and exhaust ventilation was related to a lower prevalence of general symptoms and any sbs symptoms , but there were only weak associations between measured air exchange rate and symptoms .
conclusions a large proportion of single - family houses have dampness problems in the foundation , and pollutants may enter the living space of the house and affect the health of the occupants .
furthermore , absolute air humidity should be measured more often in indoor air studies .

in the 1980s , the sick building syndrome ( sbs ) was defined as an increased prevalence of certain symptoms in groups of occupants of a building , and it was estimated that up to 30 % of new and refurbished buildings were affected ( who 1983 , 1986 ). the sbs symptoms include non - specific symptoms from the eyes , upper airways and skin , as well as general symptoms such as headache and fatigue .
throughout the years , a number of studies investigated these symptoms and their relation to different indoor environmental factors , as well as to personal factors ( norback 2009 ) .
however , most studies were performed in workplaces , mainly offices , and only a few investigated the importance of the indoor environment of homes .
in sweden , the national elib ( energy consumption in buildings ) survey was performed in the early 1990s and included data on sbs .
it found that among adults living in multi - family houses , around 20 % reported often having general symptoms such as headache , fatigue and nausea , and 15 and 8 % reported mucosal and skin symptoms , respectively .
the prevalences in single - family houses were around 10 , 8 and 5 % , respectively ( norlen and andersson 1993 ) .
more recently , prevalence of symptoms was reported by adults living in multi - family houses in stockholm , sweden ( engvall et al .
2010 ) , and a number of studies on sbs in relation to the home environment were performed in japan .
the prevalence of symptoms was reported to be between 10 and 19 % ( araki et al. 2010 ; takigawa et al. 2009 , 2012 ) .
still , there are few data on the prevalence of sbs among adults in single - family houses .
sbs is related to both personal and environmental factors ( norback 2009 ) .
among the personal factors are gender , age , atopy and smoking ( engvall et al. 2010 ; sahlberg et al. 2009 ) .
among the environmental factors are building dampness and mould , volatile organic compounds and building ventilation .
building dampness and mould are related to an increase of several diseases and symptoms of the airways and have also been related to both prevalence and incidence of sbs ( engvall et al. 2002 ; gunnbjornsdottir et al. 2003 ; shoemaker and house 2006 ; kanazawa et al. 2010 ; sahlberg et al. 2010 ; hulin et al. 2013 ) .
dampness problems may occur for a number of reasons , including leakages from roofs and installations and ground water intrusion into the foundation .
different kinds of foundations of houses have been shown to be related to dampness problems ( mahooti - brooks et al. 2004 ; hagerhed - engman et al. 2009 ; toyinbo et al .
2016 ) , but there are few studies on different kinds of constructions and their possible relationship with dampness - related sbs - type health effects , especially in adults .
however , also other building factors have been suggested to increase sbs , such as volatile organic compounds and its sources including emissions from building materials , paint , etc .
( takigawa et al. 2012 ; sahlberg et al. 2012 , 2013 ) .
buildings are ventilated in order to provide fresh air and remove pollutants from the indoor environment .
the importance of ventilation for sbs has been reviewed , and it has been concluded that sufficient air exchange is important in preventing sbs and should not be below approximately 0.5 air changes / h in dwellings .
it is also important that the ventilation system is well maintained and designed to minimize pressure differences over the building envelope for preventing harmful pollutants to infiltrate indoors ( wargocki et al. 2002 ; seppanen and fisk 2004 ; sundell et al. 2011 ) .
however , this evidence is partly indirect .
only a few studies have found a direct correlation between air exchange rate and health in homes .
furthermore , it has been discussed that current requirements for energy , perhaps resulting in tighter houses and reduced ventilation , may cause a deterioration of the indoor air quality with increased health problems as a result ( engvall et al. 2003 ; bone et al. 2010 ) .
many epidemiological studies on sbs symptoms have gathered data on both health and exposure through occupant questionnaires and may suffer from reporting bias as regards exposure .
in such studies , the possibilities to conclude on possible causal relationship are especially limited ( brauer et al. 2006 ) .
to assess the exposure by independent professionals might appear more reliable , but is also associated with various difficulties , apart from the major cost of investigating a large number of homes .
especially as regards dampness and mould , there is no golden standard for what to inspect or measure .
a number of studies have tried to validate different methods , including inspection of building characteristics and dampness , and measurement of mould spores and mould - related compounds ( haverinen et al. 2001 ; ren et al. 2001 ; roussel et al. 2008 ; who 2009 ; moularat et al. 2011 ; reponen et al. 2010 , 2013 ; crawford et al. 2015 ) .
several studies have shown a positive relationship between inspector - observed dampness problems and increased prevalence of health symptoms .
however , the studies are still not conclusive in terms of how health - related dampness exposures should be identified .
thus , there is still a need to find which dampness indicators are related to health problems .
the aims of the present study were to investigate : prevalence of indoor environmental problems in single - family houses with a focus on building dampness and ventilation , assessed by professional inspectors .
relationship between sbs symptoms and inspected building dampness and ventilation of single - family houses .
materials and methods betsi study the betsi ( buildings , energy use , technical status and indoor environment ) study was commissioned by the swedish national board of housing , building and planning in 2006 .
the aim was to get representative information of the status of swedish buildings , concerning certain parameters , as well as information on the relationships between health symptoms and the indoor environment .
as regards dwellings , a cross section of buildings in sweden was investigated using questionnaires , inspections and measurements .
the selection of buildings was performed by statistics sweden .
the buildings were selected by a multi - stage sampling procedure .
in a first step , 30 municipalities , out of totally 290 , were selected across sweden through a stratified random selection taking into account geographic and demographic characteristics .
the next step was selection of buildings , creating two samples , one consisting of single - family houses and one of multi - family houses .
data on all buildings and their construction year were obtained from the central building register in sweden .
stratified random sampling was used to sample buildings based on the construction year in five classes ( before 1960 , 1960 - 1975 , 1976 - 1985 , 1986 - 1995 and 1996 - 2005 ) aiming to get the same number of buildings in each age class .
since most buildings in sweden are old , there was an oversampling of new buildings. from these selected buildings , a subsample of buildings was chosen for inspections and technical measurements .
study population and questionnaire the current study presents data from a subsample of 821 single - family houses chosen for inspections and technical measurements .
the study population consist of all adults (>= 18 years ) living in these houses .
each adult received a questionnaire that included questions on health and personal factors .
the questionnaire was developed at the department of medical science , uppsala university , based on previous studies .
as an objective of the betsi study was to compare the prevalence of sbs symptoms with the previous elib study , the same questions on symptoms were used .
these questions originate from the mm - questionnaire which was developed at the orebro university hospital in sweden , starting in the early 1980s .
this questionnaire was tested for usefulness , reliability and validity and further developed on the basis of dozens of small pilot studies and information from external sources ( andersson et al. 1993 ; andersson 1998 ) .
the questions on sbs symptoms have been used in a large number of studies , both in sweden and internationally ( sundell and lindvall 1993 ; kemp et al. 1998 ; mizoue et al. 2004 ; sahlberg et al. 2012 ) .
the questions consist of an initial question : ' during the last 3 months , have you had any of the following symptoms ?' , followed by a list of symptoms , each with the possible responses ' yes , often ( every week )' , ' yes , sometimes ' , or ' no , never ' .
the list of symptoms included three categories and a total of nine questions : general symptoms ( fatigue ; headache ) , mucous membranes symptoms ( itching , burning , irritation of the eyes ; irritated , stuffy or runny nose ; hoarse , dry throat ; cough ) and dermal symptoms ( dry or flushed facial skin ; scaling , itching scalp or ears ; dry , itching , red skin on hands ) .
we also constructed a fourth category , any sbs symptoms , by combining the other three .
questionnaire data were collected in april - may 2008 .
inspections and measurements the houses were inspected by professional building experts according to a strict and comprehensive protocol developed by the national board of housing , building and planning , and all inspectors participated in a joint training before field work .
among aspects inspected were type of construction and fittings , general condition of the house and damages .
furthermore , drawings of the houses were checked for additional information of the construction , areas and volumes .
the overall heat transfer coefficient ( u value ) , reflecting the thermal transmittance and insulation , of the different construction materials and parts were noted , and the mean u value of the house was calculated .
a lower u value means better thermal insulation .
during the inspection , moisture content in wood in the attic roof was measured as well as in the crawl space ( if present ) , using a protimeter surveymaster ( r ) moisture meter ( general electric company , connecticut , usa ) .
starting at the inspection , relative humidity and temperature were monitored indoors and outdoors during two weeks as well as the air exchange rate .
humidity and temperature were logged by a datalogger ( mitec instrument , saffle , sweden ). from these data , absolute humidity and moisture load were calculated .
the air exchange rate was measured with measuring tubes using a tracer gas technique described in iso 16000 - 8:2007 .
perfluorocarbon tracer gas was used , and several tracer gas sources were positioned in the houses .
the gas was collected passively in charcoal tubes for long - term averages according to the standard .
air exchange rates were calculated for different parts of the house as well as the mean of the building .
inspections and measurements were performed from october 2007 - april 2008 , during which houses usually were heated and window airing less frequent .
a number of damages and constructions at risk for damage were recorded by the inspectors .
for the statistical analyses , we grouped them into problems from the foundation , outer walls and roof / attic , respectively .
problems that were recorded for each group are presented in table 1 .

relationships between health symptoms and building factors were analysed using logistic regression , adjusting for personal factors that previous studies have shown are related to symptom reports such as gender , age and smoking .
associations were expressed as odds ratios ( or ) with a 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) .
differences between groups were analysed by x 2 and anova .
in all statistical analyses , two - tailed analyses were applied .
results in total , questionnaires were received from 1160 occupants living in 605 houses ( 74 % of houses ). of these , 1097 occupants answered the questions on sbs symptoms , and 23 % reported any such symptoms. of the respondents , 49 % were female and 51 % were male , and mean age was 52.7 years , with a range from 18 to 89 .
regular smokers were 7.5 % .
the prevalence of general symptoms was 17 % , mucous symptoms 8.4 % , dermal symptoms 6.3 % and any sbs - type symptoms 23 % .
the prevalence of symptoms and personal factors are presented in table 2 .
symptom reports were more common in females than in males , and mean age was slightly lower among those reporting general and any sbs symptoms .
however , age was not related to reporting mucous or dermal symptoms and smoking was not related to reporting symptoms .

the prevalence of the different kinds of foundations was as follows : 45 % had a concrete slab on the ground , 30 % had a crawl space and 25 % had a basement .
as regards the type of ventilation system , 46 % had natural ventilation , 36 % mechanical exhaust system and 18 % had a mechanical supply and exhaust system .
prevalence of building factors and problems are presented in table 3 .
a large proportion of houses exhibited well - known building or construction problems , mainly concerning moisture problems .
however , most of these houses did not have a mouldy odour at the time of inspection .
mean air exchange rate was often lower than the national guideline of at least 0.5 ac / h ; 82 % of buildings did not meet this recommendation .
furthermore , 7.9 % did not meet the national recommendation of a moisture load not exceeding 3 g / m3 .
the u value decreased with year of construction ( p < 0.000 ) , with the newest buildings having about half the heat transmittance compared with houses build before 1960 .
however , there was also a substantial variation within each age group of buildings .

air humidity , both relative humidity , absolute humidity , and moisture load , were found to be important factors , being related to both general and mucous symptoms , and accordingly , to reporting any sbs symptoms .
among the risk factors for building dampness in the construction , problems in the foundation were most important , being related to both mucous and dermal symptoms , and reporting any sbs symptoms .
in total , 40 % of all houses had dampness problems in the foundation .
however , the prevalence of dampness - related risk factors varied between the different types of foundation. of houses with a concrete slab , 24 % had dampness - related damages or a risk construction in the foundation. of houses with a crawl space the proportion was 43 % , and of houses with a basement it was 51 % .
in table 5 , relationships between symptoms and the different types of foundations are presented .
a concrete slab with dampness risk factors was related to a higher prevalence of symptoms , and a crawl space without dampness risk was related to a lower prevalence , compared to living in a concrete slab house without dampness risk factors in the foundation .

discussion we found significant relationships between sbs - type symptoms in adults and the occurrence of several building factors that is usually regarded as problematic .
thus , the study could confirm that these problems also affect sbs - type symptoms in the occupants .
in this study , 821 single - family houses were chosen and the study population consisted of all adults living in these houses .
however , we do not have access to how many they were ; thus we cannot calculate an exact response rate of the questionnaire .
in total , questionnaires were received from 1097 occupants living in 605 houses ( 74 % of houses ) , corresponding to a mean of around 1.8 respondents per house .
in sweden , mean number of adults per single - family house is around 2.2 .
overall , this might indicate a response rate of around 65 % .
nowadays , questionnaire studies in sweden tend to have a responses rate of around 50 % .
a slightly higher response rate in our study may reflect a special interest among house owners for issues related to their dwelling .
building factors in randomly chosen houses were assessed and measured by professional building inspectors through a strict protocol , and without knowledge of the occupants' health status .
furthermore , data on health symptoms were collected independent of the inspection .
thus , the risk of selection or information bias should be low .
the weaknesses of the study rather lie in the cross - sectional design and its inherent limitation when it comes to understanding causality , and the multiple building factors recorded , leading to multiple statistical analyses and a relatively low statistical power .
a longitudinal study focusing on reported associations would be valuable .
a major aim of the study was to investigate what building dampness problems that can be observed during a non - destructive inspection were related to health symptoms .
in order to do so , we constructed dampness indexes for the different parts of the building ( foundation , outer walls , attic / roof ) .
each index contained data on three different levels of dampness problems : measured dampness , observed dampness and dampness risk constructions .
we found that these indices could indicate buildings having foundations with health - related problems .
however , it would be important to further elaborate the usefulness of such tools by analysing the different levels of dampness problems separately .
unfortunately , this was not possible in our study , due to lack of statistical power .
for houses with a concrete slab or crawl space , the factors included in the inspection of building dampness risks were successful in discovering different relationships to health in houses with a foundation that was classified as having problems compared to those without problems .
however , for houses with a basement , there was a tendency of a higher prevalence of symptoms , regardless of the dampness risk classification .
for basements , the dampness index included two questions ; ' insulation and wood frame on the inside of the outer wall ' and ' drainage not satisfactory ' .
although these are important risk factors , constructions below ground level may be associated with even more problems , not covered by the present index .
the study confirms that within a certain type of construction , there might be different details that are important for dampness conditions and health .
this is in accordance with a previous swedish study ( hagerhed - engman et al .
2009 ) in which problems were found for houses with a concrete slab foundation , but only in buildings built before 1983 , which would reflect that in older houses insulation was often placed above the slab , which is a well - known risk construction .
in recent years , the crawl space has been discussed as a risk construction , but our study found that also for the crawlspace there were houses without dampness problems and the occupants in these houses had the lowest prevalence of sbs symptoms .
it would be important to further investigate the characteristics of these crawl spaces and houses .
furthermore , these findings indicate that in a climate with relatively cold and dry air such as in sweden , dampness in the foundation might be the most important problem .
the results also confirm that building dampness problems that are important to health do not need to occur in the living space of the house .
due to air movements within the building , polluted air is transported from affected areas into the living space , including from the basement ( miranda et al. 2011 ; du et al. 2015 ) .
it is well known that in indoor environments with high air humidity , the presence of mould and house dust mites is increased , as well as the prevalence of e.g. respiratory symptoms ( who 2009 ) .
in our study , we used three measures of air humidity ( rh , ah , moisture load ) .
all were positively related to symptoms , but the statistical analyses tend to indicate that the relationship was strongest for absolute humidity .
relative humidity is the most commonly used air humidity variable in epidemiological studies .
our study supports the conclusions of a recent review ( davis et al .
2016 ) that stresses the importance of choosing an air humidity variable that is relevant according to the medical outcome under study and recommends a measure of moisture content ( e.g. ah ) to be used in most cases .
there was no relationship between sbs - type symptoms and the mean air exchange rate of the house .
however , the air exchange rate might differ between rooms , and we found a relationship between symptoms and the air exchange of the largest bedroom. of the different rooms in a dwelling , most occupants spend the largest amount of time in their bedroom , thus air exchange of the bedroom would be especially important .
we do not know which bedroom those who answered the questionnaire usually slept in , but in sweden it is common that in families with children the parents sleep in the largest bedroom .
the thermal transmittance of the house was related to general symptoms .
as expected , the u value was generally lower in newer houses , but analyses controlling for age of building showed similar results ( data not shown ) .
in fact , there was a substantial variability of u values within different age groups of buildings .
this indicates that the u value itself is the important factor related to health symptoms , and is not just a proxy for year of construction .
a low u value is typical of energy - efficient buildings .
occasionally it has been suggested that energy efficiency in buildings would result in poor indoor air quality and health problems ( sharpe et al. 2015 ) .
our study does not confirm such an assumption .
on the contrary , our study indicates a lower prevalence of sbs - type symptoms in buildings with a low thermal transmittance .
in total , 17 % reported general symptoms , 8.4 % mucous symptoms and 6.3 % skin symptoms .
these prevalences may be compared with those from the previous national swedish survey elib , performed in the early 1990s ( norlen and andersson 1993 ) .
for mucous and skin symptoms , the prevalences are very similar .
however , for general symptoms there is an increase , especially for ' fatigue ' .
in the present study , 15 % reported often being tired , while in the former it was 9 % .
the reason for this increase remains unclear .
very few respondents answered that they thought their symptoms were due to the indoor environment at home , that few it was not possible to perform any analyses on the possible relationship between such attributed symptoms and housing conditions .
however , we found relationships between symptoms and environment , even though the occupants themselves did not make such attributions .
thus , occupant complaints may not be a sufficient aspect when assessing health - related indoor environmental problems .
this study demonstrates relationships between the presence of dampness problems in the home and the health of the residents .
to evaluate the effect on health of remediation of such dampness problems should be important .
however , there are relatively few intervention studies that sought to investigate this issue .
in a cochrane review , the literature is summarized by sauni et al .
( 2015 ) .
they found no or moderate effects of the remediation on health and concluded that better studies are needed .
most previous intervention studies have focused on the effects on asthma and lower respiratory symptoms , but also effects on the kind of symptoms we have studied here , including general , dermal and upper respiratory symptoms , need to be evaluated .
conclusions dampness - related damages and risk constructions in single - family houses assessed by professional inspectors were related to sbs - type symptoms in the occupants , especially dampness problems in the foundation .
thus , pollutants from the foundation may enter the living space of the house and affect indoor air quality .
furthermore , high air humidity was related to more symptoms , with the relationship with absolute humidity being even stronger than that with relative humidity or moisture load .
this indicates that absolute humidity should be measured more often in indoor air investigations .

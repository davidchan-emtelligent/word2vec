anthropogenic global climate changes are one of the greatest threats to biodiversity .
distribution modeling can predict the effects of climate changes and potentially their effects on genetic diversity .
dna barcoding quickly identifies patterns of genetic diversity .
as a case study , we use dna barcodes and distribution models to predict threats under climate changes in the frog nanorana parkeri , which is endemic to the qinghai - tibetan plateau .
barcoding identifies major lineages w and e. lineage w has a single origin in a refugium and lineage e derives from three refugia .
all refugia locate in river valleys and each greatly contributes to the current level of intraspecific genetic diversity .
species distribution models suggest that global climate changes will greatly influence n. parkeri , especially in the level of genetic diversity , because two former refugia will fail to provide suitable habitat .
our pipeline provides a novel application of dna barcoding and has important implications for the conservation of biodiversity in southern areas of the qinghai - tibetan plateau .

introduction climatic changes influence organisms and an understanding of how this occurs is important for conservation .
more than one line of evidence documents the impact anthropogenic global climate change ( gcc ) exerts on organisms [ 1 ] .
explorations into how past climate changes influenced organisms may serve to predict future impacts of gcc .
genetic diversity is important in conservation because higher levels maintain the evolutionary potential of species .
however , the distribution of genetic diversity is often uneven across the range of a species and many factors may contribute to this .
environmental changes during glacial - interglacial cycling in the quaternary is one of the most important historical drivers of genetic patterns [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
for example , by retaining suitable habitat over several glacial cycles , refugia hold higher levels of genetic diversity compared with recently occupied areas [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
refugia also drive genetic distinctiveness within species owing to providing long - term geographic isolation .
a clear understanding a species' evolutionary history and its drivers is important for planning conservation [ 4 ] .
genetic analyses form the cornerstone of conservation planning , especially in defining objective evolutionarily significant units ( esus ) and management units ( mus ) [ 5 ] .
dna barcoding [ 6 ] , which uses a short , universal genetic marker ( coi in eukaryotes ) to identify matrilines and species , may serve to efficiently identify esus and mus .
species distribution models ( sdms ) also provide information useful for conservation planning [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] .
comparisons between sdms for current and the last glacial maximum ( lgm ) may provide a chance to explore the impacts of past climate changes to organisms .
as an extension of this application , sdms can compare the distributions of current and future habitats .
this allows assessments of the risk of local extirpation and extinction caused by future habitat degradation .
whereas both dna barcoding and sdms provide valuable insights , their synthesis may serve to evaluate threats of gcc to organisms .
the qinghai - tibetan plateau ( qtp ) , which covers more than 2.5 million km2 and has an average elevation of about 4000 m above sea level [ 10 ] , is the largest and highest plateau on earth .
unlike north america and europe , no unified ice sheet formed on the qtp during the lgm , yet its environment changed substantially .
the average temperature was from 6degreesc to 9degreesc lower than today and precipitation decreased by from 30 % to 70 % [ 11 ] .
in addition to climatic drivers , geographic features also play a role in the formation of patterns of genetic diversity .
in the southern qtp , two mountains stretch from east to west and the yarlung zangpo river ( yzr ; brahmaputra river ) ( fig. s2 ) occurs between them .
the nianqingtanggula mountains ( nm ; nyainqentanglha mountains ) in the east and gangdisi mountains ( gm ; kailas range ) in the west form the northern mountains and the himalayas form the southern boundary .
several rivers flow southward across the latter .
the complex geography may have offered refugia during dramatic quaternary climatic changes .
analyses of matrilineal dispersal are likely to reveal such history .
driven by the gcc , future severe temperature changes of the qtp may exceed those of lower elevations [ 12 ] .
thus , the gcc may impose enormous impacts on organisms living in the qtp .
we assess this possibility by synthesizing dna barcoding and sdms analyses .
because of their relatively low mobility and physiological requirements , amphibians are sensitive to environmental changes , especially temperature and precipitation .
further , amphibians retain high - resolution signals of historical responses to environmental perturbations [ 13 ] .
the environment on the qtp is harsh for amphibians ; suitable environment is rare except in the eastern and southern edges .
a previous study on rana kukunoris , a common frog on eastern qtp , revealed a unique genetic pattern compared to other taxa in the region [ 14 ] .
comparative amphibian studies from the southern qtp will yield insights into how environmental changes affect the biota fauna of the qtp .
nanorana parkeri , a median - sized frog belonging to the family dicroglossidae , is endemic to southern and southeastern tibet .
it occurs at elevations ranging from 2800 to 5000 m in valleys of the yzr and north of the nm [ 15 ] .
climate changes during lgm greatly affected this area .
our study evaluates samples from across the entire range of n. parkeri .
using the species as model system , we test the effectiveness of a pipeline that combines dna barcoding and sdms to identify future threats to genetic diversity in the face of gcc .
materials and methods ethics statement all the species included in our study ( table s1 ) are not endangered or protected species according to the " law of the people 's republic of china on the protection of wildlife " and " regulations for the implementation of the people 's republic of china on the protection of terrestrial wildlife " ( state council decree [ 1992 ] no. 13 ) .
the permission for field work in four major management areas ( 39 localities ) including xigaze , lhasa , nyingchi and qamdo was issued by the forestry department of xizang [ tibet ] autonomous region , china .
local people of the forestry bureaus involved and helped during the whole survey .
totally , 549 tissue samples including toe tips , muscle , livers , tadpoles and egg masses were obtained , following the animal use protocols approved by the animal care and ethics committee of the kunming institute of zoology , chinese academy of sciences .
for egg masses , we separated 5 - 10 eggs from egg mass and stored them in 95 % alcohol after removing egg jelly .
for adult , within each locality only five individuals were euthanized using clove oil firstly .
following euthanization , tissues dissected from adult specimens were preserved in 95 % ethanol .
more other adults were just cut two toe tips and then released .
tadpoles were also euthanized using clove oil firstly , then stored in 95 % alcohol after removing gut .
table s1 lists our samplings information , including species name , locality , gps coordinates , and accession nos .
in genbank etc .
population sampling and laboratory techniques our samplings covered the entire documented distribution range of n. parkeri ( fig. 1 , table s1 ) .
one individual of n. pleskei , n. ventripunctata and n. liebigii was used as an outgroup representative [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0103899.g001 figure 1 sampling sites and the maternal genealogy based on mtdna sequence data .
site numbers refer to table s1 .
colors of the matrilines match those of samplings localities on the map .
four localities containing two matrilines each are show in larger pie figures .
we extracted genomic dna using standard phenol - chloroform extraction protocol [ 18 ] .
partial sequences of cytochrome c oxidase subunit i ( coi ) were sequenced for all individuals using universal primers [ 19 ] .
pcr products were purified and used as the template dna for cycle sequencing reactions performed using bigdye terminator cycle sequencing kit ( v.2.0 , applied biosystems , foster city , usa ) and an abi prism 3730 dna analyzer .
sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses nucleotide sequences were checked by eye using lasergene 7.0 and aligned using clustalx 1.81 [ 20 ] with default parameters .
subsequently , the aligned sequences were checked and optimized in mega 4.0 [ 21 ] .
identical haplotypes for mtdna were collapsed using dnasp 5.10 [ 22 ] .
the overall value of nucleotide diversity ( pi ) and haplotype diversity ( h ) were also estimated using dnasp .
phylogenetic analyses of the coi data were conducted using bayesian inference ( bi ) , maximum likelihood ( ml ) and maximum parsimony ( mp ) .
bi analyses were performed using mrbayes 3.1.2 [ 23 ] .
we tested three different partition strategies based on codon positions ( no partition ; 1 + 2 , 3 ; and 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
the best strategy was chosen based on the bayes factor test [ 24 ] ( table 1 ) , as it represented a robust method testing partitioning strategies [ 25 ] .
nucleotide substitution models were selected for each data partition using the akaike information criterion in mrmodeltest v2.3 [ 26 ] .
bi analyses for each partition strategy were run 3 million generations while sampling trees every 1000 generations .
the first 50 % of the sampled trees were discarded as burn - in. the final analyses employing the best partition strategy were run for 10 million generations .
awty [ 27 ] was used to confirm satisfactory convergence of the topological split frequencies .
mp analyses were implemented using paup * 4.0b10 [ 28 ] .
heuristic searches with tbr were executed for 1000 random pseudoreplicates with all characters treated as unordered and equally weighted .
bootstrap analyses were conducted using 1000 replicates to assess nodal reliabilities .
ml analyses were conducted using raxml 7.0.4 [ 29 ] and the gtr + i + g model was implemented for each data partition .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0103899.t001 table 1 bayes factor of each partition strategy .

we built a median - joining network ( mjn ) using network 4.5 [ 30 ] to visualize the frequencies of the haplotypes .
to remove excessive links and median vectors , we used the mp option [ 31 ] .
divergence time estimation different demographic and molecular clock models were compared using path sampling and stepping - stone sampling ( table 2 ) [ 32 ] .
employing the best models , time to most recent common ancestor was estimated using beast 1.7.5 [ 33 ] .
due to the absence of a reliable fossil record and an established substitution rate of coi for n. parkeri , we used the divergence time between n. parkeri and n. pleskei ( 8.9 +/ - 2.7 ma ) [ 16 ] as a secondary calibration point .
model selection and partition scheme were the same as used in the bi analyses .
the final analyses involved two independent runs of 30 million generations each , while sampling trees every 1000th generation .
burn - in and convergence of the chains were determined with tracer 1.5 [ 34 ] .
the measures of effective sample sizes were used to determine the bayesian statistical significance of each parameter .

population structure and demographic analyses we explored population structure and genetic diversity landscape using spads 1.0 [ 35 ] .
groups of populations were defined as for samova [ 36 ] .
we explored values of k ( number of groups ) ranging from 2 to 10 with 100 simulated annealing processes .
the optimum value of k was identified by exploring the behavior of the indices fct and fsc .
spatial patterns of genetic diversity based on allelic richness ( ar ) and pi across the landscape were explored using the gdivpal function in spads .
to test for the influences of mountains and rivers on the genetic structure of n. parkeri , we measured the population structure by three independent analyses of molecular variance ( amova ) [ 37 ] : populations north and south of the yzr ; populations north of nm , west of the boundary of gm and nm , and the remaining ones ; and four groups according the results of the samova .
analyses were performed using arlequin 3.5 [ 38 ] and significance was assessed by 10000 permutations .
we investigated past changes of effective population size using the neutral test and mismatch distributions .
tajima 's d [ 39 ] and fu 's fs statistics [ 40 ] with 10000 coalescent simulations were calculated using arlequin .
pairwise mismatch distributions [ 41 ] were calculated for each group in arlequin .
the expected distribution under a model of sudden demographical expansion was generated using 10000 permutations .
the significance of deviations from this model was tested using the sum of squared deviation ( ssd ) and raggedness index ( rag ) .
all analyses were performed for each lineage separately because population subdivisions could have masked the effects of expansions .
species distribution modeling we inferred the potential geographic range of n. parkeri using the maximum entropy model implemented in maxent 3.3.3 [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] .
environmental variables from the worldclim database with resolutions of 2.5 arc - minutes [ 44 ] were downloaded as environmental layers .
because of the controversy about whether correlated variables should be removed or not , we used all of the 19 bioclimatic layers [ 45 ] .
all layers were cropped to span from 83degreese to 99degreese and from 26degreesn to 33degreesn .
random null distributions were built to test for the significance of our sdm .
for this test , we built a new sdm using 39 random points ( as same number as our sampling localities ) .
this process was repeated 100 times and the areas under the curves ( aucs ) were used as null distributions [ 46 ] .
assuming niche conservatism over time [ 47 ] - [ 49 ] , we predicted the former distribution of n. parkeri by projecting our model on lgm climatic layers .
predicted distributions during the lgm were generated by downloading both the community climate system model ( ccsm ) [ 50 ] and model for interdisciplinary research on climate ( miroc ) [ 51 ] from the worldclim database .
to predict the influences of gcc to this species , we also projected the model to climate data of the 2080 s based on miroc model under the a1b scenario .
in this way , we predicted the distribution changes in future .
results sequence information we obtained 549 partial coi sequences from 39 localities of n. parkeri , plus one sequence each from n. pleskei , n. ventripunctata and n. liebigii .
the fragment consisted of 539 base pairs , of which 35 positions exhibited variation and 27 were potentially parsimony informative , resulting in 23 haplotypes in n. parkeri .
all sequences were deposited in genbank ( table s1 ) .
the overall value of pi was 0.01746 +/ - 0.00055 and h was 0.678 +/ - 0.016 .
genealogical analyses of coi bayes factor test showed a preference for the partition strategy of 1 + 2 , 3 ( table 1 ) .
the best fit substitution model for the first and second codon was hky and gtr + g model was the best fit for third codon .
matrilineal genealogies obtained from bi , ml and mp analyses were nearly identical ( fig. 1 & fig. s1 ) and all methods recovered lineages east ( e ) and west ( w ) .
the boundary of gm and nm separated these two lineages .
lineage w was comprised of 6 haplotypes , which had no clear structure .
lineage e was comprised 17 haplotypes of which 12 formed highly supported sublineage e1 .
the mjn depicted patterns similar to those of the gene tree ( fig. 2 ) .
haplotypes h1 and h11 , which were more common than the other haplotypes , occupied central positions .

divergence time estimates results of model comparisons were shown in table 2 .
both path sampling and stepping - stone sampling suggested that the bsp demographic model under strict clock outperformed the alternative models .
the average divergence time estimations were shown in fig. 3. lineages e and w diverged about 1.4 ma ( 95 % ci : 0.6 - 2.4 ma ) .
lineage e diverged about 0.41 ma ( 95 % ci : 0.15 - 0.81 ma ) and the radiation of lineage w happened about 0.15 ma ( 95 % ci : 0.05 - 0.32 ma ) .

samples from lineage w grouped together ( fig. 4 , dark blue ) .
lineage e contained 3 groups , of which populations in the southern edges of the qtp formed two small groups ( localities 2 , 16 and 26 ; and locality 15 and 19 ) ; the remaining localities comprised the third group ( fig. 4 , light blue ) .
spatial patterns of genetic diversity based on ar and pi were shown in figure 5 and listed in table s3 .
several peaks indicated high levels of genetic diversity across the distribution of n. parkeri .
this was congruent with the pattern of lineage divergence .

for the sdms of n. parkeri , the auc of our data was 0.904 and this was significant better than that of a random model ( p < 0.001 ) .
the miroc model predicted that the distribution of n. parkeri at the lgm was much smaller than that of today ( fig. 7 ) .
the results based on ccsm model suggested a similar pattern , but with larger areas than those from miroc model .
both models suggested range fluctuations after the lgm in northern , high altitude areas .
the boundary area between gm and nm , where lineages w and e divided , has been unsuitable for n. parkeri since the lgm .
the predicted distribution under gcc assuming the a1b scenario was shown in figure 7 .
nanorana parkeri is predicted to have a larger distribution in the northwestern qtp .
however , the species' distribution will contract in the southeastern qtp .

discussion lineage divergence and esus esus , which can be determined by genetic differentiation at neutral markers caused by isolation , are important when considering conservation actions .
our study builds on the framework for delineating esus of n. parkeri by reconstructing the patterns of lineage divergence and its drivers .
our analyses suggest the recognition of esus that correspond to lineages w , e1 , e2 and e3 .
our research demonstrates that coi can quickly delineate esus .
the gene trees and mjn depict a clear east - west split for n. parkeri .
sdms suggest that unsuitable habitat between the gm and nm , both now and during the lgm , drives this pattern .
the boundary is the demarcation line of two qtp climatic zones that are largely congruent with the 400 mm precipitation line .
east of this line , the region is semi - humid , and to the west semi - arid [ 52 ] .
similar pattern was also found in hippophae tibetana [ 53 ] , [ 54 ] .
geographic features , such as rivers or mountains , appear to contribute little to the patterns of genetic divergence .
the yzr , which would impose a north - south split , does not drive population divergence .
the amova explains only 16.04 % of the genetic variation in this scenario .
elevations of nm range from 5000 m to 6000 m , but no substantial genetic divergence distinguishes frogs in south and north of nm. lineages e and w are separated by the boundary of gm and nm. however , habitat barriers and environmental differences more likely generate this pattern than geographical features .
two observations support this hypothesis .
first , populations of lineages w and e both occur south of the gm and nm. second , n. parkeri occurs along the yzr valley , which flows across the boundary and connects lineages w and e. the pattern of genetic divergence within each major lineage differs .
the 6 haplotypes in lineage w do not yield a clear pattern ( fig. 1 ) .
the network depicts a star - like haplogroup ( fig. 2 ) .
samova also suggests populations from w comprise a single group .
in contrast , lineage e differs in having three groups ( figs. 1 , 2 ) .
results from samova present the same pattern .
most northern populations form a group as do frogs from localities 15 , 19 ( e2 ) and localities 2 , 16 , 26 ( e3 ) .
the difference in patterns between e and w may owe to topography .
the intricate topography of the east himalayas , which is a global biodiversity hotspot , provides suitable habitats and generates barriers that limit dispersal for lineage e. other species exhibit a similar pattern ; populations in the fringes or southern slope of himalayas are genetically different from those on the qtp [ 54 ] , [ 55 ] .
expansion and contraction of distribution ranges caused by climate changes provided opportunity for populations divergence in qtp [ 54 ] - [ 57 ] .
the genetic pattern within n. parkeri suggests recognition of four esus , w , e1 , e2 and e3 .
certainly gene flow occurs within and between lineages e and w , as lineages or sublineages mix at localities 8 , 12 , 16 and 26 .
however , matrilineal uniqueness occurs in populations far from the boundary .
glacial refugia and genetic diversity of n. parkeri refugia in the qtp prevented extinction during the lgm .
in doing so , they conserved high levels of genetic diversity .
in contrast , genetic diversity in recently occupied areas is much lower because of founder effects [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
the identification of refugia is an important part of conservation because these areas preserve genetic diversity .
synthesizing dna barcoding and sdms , we quickly and effectively identify refugia for n. parkeri .
populations in refugia retain higher levels of diversity than population in newly occupied places ( fig. 5 and table s3 ) .
the multiple refugia hypothesis corresponds with patterns of mtdna divergence .
the matrilineal genealogy , mjn and samova analyses indicate the absence of genetic structure within lineage w. thus , lineage w likely originates from a single refugium .
the sdms indicate the presence of suitable habitat in the river valley near locality 27 ( fig. 7 ) and the area retains a much higher level of genetic diversity ( fig. 5 ) than other sites .
the neutral test and mismatch distribution analyses clearly detect a population expansion in lineage w. our analyses identify several refugia in lineage e. sublineage e1 may originate from a northern refugium near localities 7 and 8 , which occur in the valley at the confluence of the lhasa river and the yzr ( fig. 7 ) .
during the lgm the suitable environment harbored a high level of genetic diversity .
the absence of genealogical structure in sublineage e1 is congruent with a sudden population expansion , as are significantly negative values of tajima 's d and fu 's fs , and the mismatch distribution analyses .
further , our analyses identify two microrefugia in the river valleys along southern edges of the qtp .
localities 2 , 16 and 26 , which are in the yzr valley near nyingchi and medog , seemingly constitute a microrefugium .
the other microrefugium consists of localities 15 and 19 , which are also in a river valley .
this river flows southwards across the himalayas .
the lower elevations of the river valleys make them less susceptible to the influences montane glaciers .
river valleys in the himalayas , especially those connected with southern slopes , appear to offer microrefugia .
populations from sampling localities north of the nm also retain a high level of genetic diversity ( fig. 5 ) .
private haplotypes h4 ( locality 38 ) , h2 and h3 ( locality 33 ) , and h5 ( locality 37 ) occur here ( table s1 ) .
the sdms suggest that suitable habitat existed in northern areas of nm. this area appears to harbor another microrefugium .
however , these private haplotypes fail to cluster together and the most common haplotype in the area is h1 ( fig. 2 & table s1 ) .
thus , we cannot reject the hypothesis that these private haplotypes originated during population expansions after the lgm .
potential threats of gcc to n. parkeri our study suggests that the combination of dna barcoding and sdms can detect threats of gcc to the survival of species .
this pipeline facilitates conservation .
sdms predict that suitable habitat for n. parkeri may experience great shifts in the near future .
whereas the northwest qtp will offer suitable habitat for n. parkeri , the southeast qtp will become unsuitable .
although suitable habitat will experience an overall expansion , populations in the southeast qtp may experience sharp decreases in population size or become extirpated .
given that amphibians have poor dispersal abilities , the latter scenario may be an unfortunate consequence of gcc .
our pipeline suggests that many populations of lineage e may suffer from developing unsuitable habitats .
the microrefugium near nyingchi and medog will become unsuitable under this prediction ( fig. 7 ) .
fortunately , suitable habitat may persist in the two other refugia .
thus , genetic variation will decrease yet all may not be lost .
for lineage w , suitable habitat will disappear near the refugium at locality 27 .
loss of this refugium will greatly decrease the amount of genetic diversity .
our analyses suggest that genetic diversity of n. parkeri may greatly decrease .
although this facilitates effective conservation planning , we urge caution .
our sdms for the future assume a1b scenarios , which involve rapid global economic growth with a balance of fossil and non - fossil energy sources .
each of possible scenarios yields different predictions about the future climate .
all scenarios require constant adjustment according to global economic conditions .
the complex landscape in the southern qtp may supply suitable microhabitats for n. parkeri which cannot be detected by our sdms .
accordingly , we suggest the urgent development of an effective monitoring program , especially for populations in refugia that may lose suitable habitats .
conclusion dna barcoding detects the genetic structure of n. parkeri and serves to define esus .
our analyses recover major lineages e and w , which separate at the boundary of the gm and nm. habitat barriers and environmental differences , combined with geographic features , are the drivers of genetic divergences .
lineage e contains three parts : e1 , e2 and e3 .
thus our analyses define four esus that correspond to matrilines w , e1 , e2 and e3 .
genetic and environmental data identify four historical refugia , each of which corresponds to a lineage or sublineage .
lineage w originates from a refugium in river valley near locality 27 .
most populations of lineage e originate from a refugium in the river valley near lhasa .
two microrefugia occur in river valleys along the himalayas .
our analyses detect a population mixture after the lgm in some localities but these occurrences do not influence our designations of esus .
our study highlights the importance of valleys along the himalayas for biodiversity conservation .
based on climate models under gcc , we predict the potential distribution changes and threats to genetic diversity of n. parkeri .
our pipeline , which combines dna barcoding and sdms , is an effective approach in conservation .

in adult patients , left ventricular remodeling ( lvr ) patterns can predict cv risk .
however , few studies on lvr of coa patients exist due to lack of detailed geometric models .
the cardiac atlas project ( cap ) , a worldwide consortium for pooling standardized analyses of cardiac images for mapping heart shape and motion , provides a unique opportunity to study coa cardiac remodeling .
this study compares lv shape in a sample of coa patients pre - and post - stent to normal patients from the cap with the goal of developing model - based predictions of lvr to guide clinical management .
methods cardiac magnetic resonance images ( cmri ) and clinical data of five patients ( ages : 8 - 24 yrs. ) with native and re - coarctation of the aorta were collected with irb approval .
all study patients were potential candidates for stent implantation .
cmri 1 - 2yrs .
post - stent are currently available for four patients .
patient - specific geometric models were built from cmri using finite element guide - point modeling software ( cim , university of auckland , new zealand ) .
shape modes at end - systole ( es ) and end - diastole ( ed ) were derived using principal component analysis ( pca ) of a population ( n = 1991 ) of asymptomatic volunteers from the cap .
pc scores describing the deviation of each coa model from the asymptomatic pca model distribution at ed and es for various shape modes were calculated .
results figure 1 shows representative geometric models for a single patient and table 1 reports pc scores for all patients .
in order , pc modes ( m1 - m4 ) represent variance in : 1 ) lv size , 2 ) sphericity and wall thickness , 3 ) mitral valve orientation ( mvo ) , and 4 ) wall thickness and mvo .
most pc scores are < 2.0 , indicating model shapes are within two standard deviations of the control population .
at ed and es pre - stent , the largest absolute pc score for most patients is for m4 , which predominantly represents wall thickness and mvo .
generally , as the value for m4 post - stent decreases , the mode with the largest absolute pc changes for a particular patient even at one year post - stent .
this is consistent with recent literature showing that short - term lvr may occur in coa patients post - intervention .

the shape characteristic represented by each mode is noted .

patients 4 and 5 have not undergone 2 - year follow - up cmr .
corresponding models and pc scores for patients 3 - 5 are not available .

conclusions preliminary results with a small sample size comparing lv geometry of coa patients against an atlas - based population of controls show lv shape characteristics that are similar to the normal lv. notable characteristics post - stent include change in wall thickness and mitral valve orientation which reflect remodeling of the ventricle .
detailed quantification of cardiac shape can improve our understanding of the adverse effects of remodeling and , in combination with future patient - specific biomechanics models , advance the potential for early recognition of remodeling patterns to guide timely clinical management .

the disease is caused by germinal mutations in mismatch repair genes .
to date , hundreds of small pathogenic and possibly pathogenic dna variants ( small insertions , deletions and substitutions ) have been described for lynch syndrome worldwide .
because of the variety of small changes in mismatch repair genes only full screening ( exon by exon ) by dhplc / sequencing or hrm / sequencing seems to be the appropriate screening option .
however , full screening is still too expensive and time consuming .
a solution that uses the opportunity to reduce costs and improve diagnosis is the detection of recurrent mutations .
this approach has been successfully applied as a pre - screening method .
we have compared all identified changes in mmr genes detected to date from populations emanating from estonia , latvia , lithuania and poland to ascertain if there are any similarities in the mutation spectra that can be used in designing a rapid diagnostic test for recurrent mutations characteristic for the eastern baltic sea region .

dibutyl phthalate ( dbp ) is a commonly used plasticizer and additive to adhesives , printing inks and nail polishes .
because it has been found to be a powerful reproductive and developmental toxicant , a sensor to monitor dbp in some working spaces and the environment is required .
in this work polyaniline nanofibers were deposited on the electrode of a quartz crystal oscillator to form a quartz crystal microbalance gas sensor .
the coated quartz crystal and a non - coated quartz crystal were mounted in a sealed chamber , and their frequency difference was monitored .
when dbp vapor was injected into the chamber , gas adsorption decreased the frequency of the coated quartz crystal oscillator and thereby caused an increase in the frequency difference between the two crystals .
the change of the frequency difference was recorded as the sensor response .
the sensor was extremely sensitive to dbp and could be easily recovered by n2 purging .
a low measurement limit of 20 ppb was achieved .
the morphologies of the polyaniline films prepared by different approaches have been studied by sem and bet .
how the nanofiber - structure can improve the sensitivity and stability is discussed , while its selectivity and long - term stability were investigated .

introduction dibutyl phthalate ( dbp ) , which is soluble in various organic solvents , is a commonly used plasticizer as well as an additive to adhesives , printing inks and nail polishes [ 1 ] .
at least two decades ago , scientists found that dbp can be a powerful reproductive and developmental toxicant in laboratory animals [ 1 - 4 ] , particularly for males [ 5,6 ] .
the precise mechanism of action is not known , but the pattern of reproductive harm is consistent with other so - called anti - androgens or chemicals that interfere with the male hormones called androgens [ 1 ] .
being suspected as an endocrine disrupter , dbp was added to the california proposition 65 ( 1986 ) list of suspected teratogens in november 2006 [ 7 ] .
several methods have been reported for the determination of phthalates using fluorescence immunoassay [ 8 ] , high performance liquid chromatography [ 9 ] , and mass spectroscopy [ 10 ] .
although such techniques provide a low level of detection for phthalates , they are time consuming and have high instrumentation costs .
quartz crystal microbalance ( qcm ) sensors have been widely investigated due to their high sensitivity , durability and linearity for mass of the target materials [ 11 - 17 ] .
a qcm sensor can be constructed by coating the quartz crystal electrodes surface with a film capable of interaction with the analyte of interest [ 16,17 ] .
the operating principle of qcm sensors is based on the interaction between the surface of a quartz crystal coated with the sensing materials and the target materials .
the sauerbrey equation was developed for oscillation in air and only applies to rigid mass attached to the crystal [ 18 ] .
although a number of polymers have been successfully employed in the coating of qcm sensors [ 11,15 - 17 ] , dbp gas sensors based on coated qcm have seldom been investigated .
we study herein a qcm sensor with a nanofiber polyaniline film for highly sensitive dbp detection in air .
besides evaluating of the sensor performance , the way in which the nanofiber - structure of polyaniline can be used to improve the response feature of the qcm sensors is also investigated and discussed .
2. experimental section 2.1 .
materials aniline ( ar ) , dibutyl phthalate ( ar ) , ammonium peroxydisulfate ( ar ) , poly ( sodium - p - styrene sulfonate ) and hydrochloric acid ( ar ) were commercially available .
aniline was freshly distilled under vacuum prior to use .
deionized filtered water was used in all studies .
ethanol ( ar ) , acetaldehyde ( ar ) , acetone ( ar ) , dimethyl phthalate ( ar ) and diethyl phthalate ( ar ) were also all commercially available .
at - cut 6.0 mhz ( hc - 49 / u ) quartz crystals with electrodes on both sides were purchased from hosonic international ( hangzhou ) ltd. , china .
the crystals were rinsed in ethanol and then deionized water prior to use .
2.2 .
preparation of sensors with nanofiber polyaniline film polyaniline nanofibers used in this paper were synthesized in dilute aniline aqueous solution , using chemical polymerization methods .
according to the method published by epstein [ 19 ] , a dilute aniline solution was prepared by adding an equal amount of aniline ( ca .
8 mm ) and ammonium peroxydisulfate to the hydrochloric acid solution , which was then dispersed by ultrasonication .
polyaniline nanofiber was obtained after standing for 24 h. then a certain volume of the homogenous polyaniline solution was coated on the qcm .
after drying for 96 h at room temperature , the nanofiber polyaniline was deposited on the surface of qcm , whose sensing area is 0.5 cm2 , this forming a qcm sensor modified with a nanofiber - structured polyaniline film .
2.3 .
preparation of sensors with non - nanofiber polyaniline film in order to contrast with the polyaniline nanofibers sensing film and to study the effect on gas sensing properties of the nanofiber - structured polyaniline , the corresponding polyaniline without a nanofibrous structure was chosen as the contrast sensing material .
the polyaniline was prepared by adding aniline ( ca. 400 mm ) , ammonium peroxydisulfate ( ca. 400 mm ) and poly ( sodium - p - styrene sulfonate ) ( ca. 6 % , w / w ) to a hydrochloric acid solution .
the solution of non - nanofibrous polyaniline was obtained after standing for 24 h. a drop - coating method was used to form a polyaniline film on the surface of the electrode .
2.4 .
charaterization scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) observation was performed using a field - emission scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer ( fesem - eds , hitachi s4800 , tokyo , japan ) .
brunauer - emmett - teller ( bet ) nitrogen adsorption - desorption data were obtained on a micromeritics analyzer ( asap 2020 v3.01 e analyzer , micromeritics instrument corporation , norcross , ga , usa ) at 77 k. a measuring microscope ( 107ja precise measuring microscope purchased from shanghai csoif , co. , ltd. , shanghai , china ) was used to measure the polyaniline film thickness .
2.5 .
gas sensing experiments a sensing film coated crystal was used as a sensing qcm while an uncoated crystal was used as a reference qcm .
both of the reference and sensing qcm set in a 500 ml sealed chamber were exposed to dbp or analytical gases for 5 min at 20 degree celsius .
for each vapor sample , 10 ml pure dbp or other gases were left on the bottom of a 1,000 ml glass container for 3 h , so that saturated volatile organic compounds could be extracted in the headspace of the container as the analyte .
appropriate analyte concentrations were obtained in the test chamber by injecting known volumes of headspace gas via a gas tight syringe [ 16 ] .
moreover , a small plastic air bag was used to keep the pressure balance .
a driving circuit made the qcms oscillating and output the frequency difference .
when an gas to be analyzed was injected into the testing chamber , the frequency difference change was defined as the response of the sensor .
the frequency difference between reference and sensing qcms was measured continuously at 1 second intervals .
after the qcm sensor response stabilized , high - purity n2 was used to purge the chamber to recover the sensor .
3. results and discussion 3.1 .
sem and bet studies of sensing films the polyaniline film on the qcm sensor was deposited by platinum on the surface for sem observation .
it can be seen in figure 1 ( a ) that the nanofiber - structured polyaniline film consists of relatively uniform nanowires with diameters of approximately 60 nm. in comparison , figure 1 ( b ) shows the morphology of the polyaniline film , where there are no nanofibers , but only agglomerates and particulates .
nitrogen adsorption and desorption analyses were conducted to investigate the surface area and pore structures of polyaniline films .
table 1 lists the bet data of nanofiber - structured and non - nanofiber polyaniline , indicating the bet surface area of nanofibrous polyaniline was around 175 times larger than that of the contrast non - nanofiber polyaniline film .
3.2 .
optimization of the thickness of nanofiber - structured sensing films the thickness of the sensing film on the electrode was a key factor affecting the sensitivity of the sensor , which is controlled by the volume of the homogenous polyaniline solution coated on the qcm .
figure 2 shows the responses of the sensors with different thickness of the sensing films to 0.2 ppm dbp .
as the thickness of polyaniline films increased from 2.5 to 25.0 mum , the responses increased dramatically .
when the thickness of polyaniline films was more than 25.0 mum , the responses did not increase further .
in order to maintain the fastest response , the optimal thickness of polyaniline films was chosen as 25.0 mum .
3.3 .
sensitivity and repeatability the sauerbrey equation [ 18 ] gives the change in the oscillation frequency of piezoelectric quartz ( deltaf ) as a function of the mass ( deltam ) added to the crystal : ( 1 ) deltaf = - 2f02arhoqupsilonqdeltamwhere deltaf is the observed frequency change ( hz ) , f0 is the fundamental resonant frequency of the crystal , a is the active area of the crystal ( between electrodes ) , rhoq is the density of quartz and upsilonq is the shear wave velocity in the quartz .
when an analyte is injected into the testing chamber , the sensing film adsorbs the analyte and the sensing qcm 's frequency decreases .
the response , defined as the change of the frequency difference between the sensing qcm and the reference qcm , increases .
the recovery of the sensor could be achieved by high - purity n2 purging .
figure 3 illustrates the response cycles of a nanofiber - structured polyaniline based qcm sensor to 0.2 , 0.4 and 1.0 ppm dbp and purged by high purity n2 at room temperature .
the sensor showed a good repeatability for certain dbp concentrations and could be easily recovered by high - purity n2 purging .
the response time ( t90 ) of the sensor was less than 30 s. in figure 4 , the calibration curve of the nanofiber - structured polyaniline based qcm sensor is plotted .
the experiments were carried out cyclically with a cleaning step for 5 min in n2 and exposure to dbp for 5 min .
each response ( r ) of the sensor to dbp concentration ( c ) was repeatedly measured four times .
as seen from the figure 4 , responses of the sensor were almost linearly proportional to the dbp concentration in the range from 0.02 to 0.4 ppm .
the regression equation is r = 288.16 c + 2.25 with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 .
the limit of detection ( calculated as three times the signal - to - noise ratio ) was 0.02 ppm .
3.4 .
selectivity to investigate the selectivity , the responses of the sensor exposed to acetone , ethanol , acetaldehyde and dbp were measured and analyzed .
although the concentrations of acetone , ethanol and acetaldehyde ( 8 ppm ) were 10 times higher than that of dbp ( 0.8 ppm ) , the responses to acetone , ethanol and acetaldehyde were still far less than those to dbp ( as shown in figure 5 ) .
the sensor demonstrated an excellent selectivity to dbp from acetone , ethanol and acetaldehyde though they all have carbon - oxygen double bonds or single bonds .
the sensing mechanisms are different according to the characteristics of polyaniline and the target gas [ 20 ] .
in this work , the interaction of polyaniline with dbp is due to the strong tendency to form hydrogen bonding .
as dbp contacted with the polymer , hydrogen bonding was supposed to form between the polyaniline imine groups and the carboxyl groups of dbp .
this process made the mass of the film increase , and the frequency of qcm changed .
when nitrogen gas was injected into the chamber , hydrogen bonding would be destroyed and dbp was desorbed .
moreover , dbp as a plasticizer has a good compatibility polyaniline polymer .
such characteristics made dbp easily absorbed into polyaniline .
other plasticizers , such as dimethyl phthalate ( dmp ) and diethyl phthalate ( dep ) , which have the similar structures to dbp , can also be detected by the qcm sensor .
the sensor response ratio to dbp : dep : dmp was 100 : 90 : 78 .
3.5 .
long - term stability in order to assess the long - term stability , the response cycles of the sensor used immediately after fabrication were recorded and compared with those of the sensor stored for 60 days .
the experimental result is shown in figure 6 .
although the sensor was stored in a dry cabinet at room temperature for 2 months , its response amplitude and recovery remained almost unchanged .
3.6 .
nano - structure effects on the qcm sensor in order to investigate the effect of polyaniline nanofiber - structure on the performance of the qcm sensor , polyaniline coated sensors both with and without nanofiber - structure were fabricated and characterized .
the morphologies of the polyaniline films with and without nanofiber - structure were illustrated in figure 1 ( a,b ) , respectively .
the response cycles of both sensors to 0.4 ppm dbp are shown in figure 7 .
the average response amplitudes of the two sensors were 117.5 hz and 87.8 hz , respectively .
the response of the sensor with the nanofiber - structure was 33 % larger than the contrast .
not only was the efficient area of the film with nanofiber - structure larger than the contrast , some other nano - scale effects may have also been involved [ 20,21 ] .
as shown in figure 7 , the baseline of the sensor with a nanofiber - structure was much more stable than the one without nanofiber - structure , while the recovery rate improved significantly .
the porosity of the sponge - like nano - structure not only made the analyte adsorption easier , but also made the desorption more thorough .
a large overshoot in the frequency response was observed for the sensor without nanofiber - structure , while there was only a small one for the sensor coated with nanofiber - structured sensing film as shown in figure 7 .
in every dbp gas experiment , a high concentration analyte gas was injected into the 500 ml sealed chamber and diffused to equilibrium of a certain concentration in about 5 s , as the diffusion rate is 0.1 l / s , at normal temperature and pressure .
as a result of the high concentration of gas being injected close to the qcm sensor , the polyaniline membrane adsorbed much more dbp gas transiently in the beginning , however , as the gas diffused to the bulk medium , desorption happened in the membrane in the meantime , and the amount of dbp adsorbed came into equilibrium , until the adsorption and the desorption were balanced in the end .
because the desorption in non - nanofiber - polyaniline membrane is slower and harder to complete , the frequency of the qcm increased sharply and an overshooting happened due to the fact the quantity of qcm increased sharply when the high concentration of gas was injected .
on the contrary , because desorption of nanofiber - polyaniline is faster and easier , the equilibrium of the gas in the membrane can be achieved in a short time , and no overshooting can be detected .
the sponge - like nano - structured sensing film reduced the overshoot significantly .
this effect proved the proposal by gardner based on his non - linear diffusion reaction model [ 22 ] .
4. conclusions nanofiber - structured polyaniline films were prepared by a simple non - template method .
based on this film , a qcm sensor to sense dibutyl phthalate was developed and high sensitivity and long term stability were obtained .
in comparison with dbp qcm sensor fabricated in a similar way but without nanofiber - structures , the sensitivity and stability of the sensor with nanofiber - structured polyaniline film were significantly improved .
further studies on the qcm sensor response to other plasticizers need to be done and the selectivity of the sensor should be improved .
the simple and low - cost method has potential for the development of commercial sensitive dbp sensors for industrial and environmental applications .

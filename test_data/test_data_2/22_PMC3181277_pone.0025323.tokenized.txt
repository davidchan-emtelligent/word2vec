background transketolase - like 1 ( tktl1 ) induces glucose degradation through anaerobic pathways , even in presence of oxygen , favoring the malignant aerobic glycolytic phenotype characteristic of tumor cells .
as tktl1 appears to be a valid biomarker for cancer prognosis , the aim of the current study was to correlate its expression with tumor stage , probability of tumor recurrence and survival , in a series of colorectal cancer patients .
methodolody / principal findings tumor tissues from 63 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer at different stages of progression were analyzed for tktl1 by immunohistochemistry .
staining was quantified by computational image analysis , and correlations between enzyme expression , local growth , lymph - node involvement and metastasis were assessed .
the highest values for tktl1 expression were detected in the group of stage iii tumors , which showed significant differences from the other groups ( kruskal - wallis test , p = 0.000008 ) .
deeper analyses of t , n and m classifications revealed a weak correlation between local tumor growth and enzyme expression ( mann - whitney test , p = 0.029 ) , a significant association of the enzyme expression with lymph - node involvement ( mann - whitney test , p = 0.0014 ) and a significant decrease in tktl1 expression associated with metastasis ( mann - whitney test , p = 0.0004 ) .
conclusions / significance to our knowledge , few studies have explored the association between variations in tktl1 expression in the primary tumor and metastasis formation .
here we report downregulation of enzyme expression when metastasis appears , and a correlation between enzyme expression and regional lymph - node involvement in colon cancer .
this finding may improve our understanding of metastasis and lead to new and more efficient therapies against cancer .
introduction tumor development is caused by a sequential accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes that lead cells through a multistep process that renders healthy cells malignant [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] .
throughout this process , alterations that favor the formation of primary tumors usually differ from the adaptations required for advanced carcinogenesis [ 5 ] - [ 7 ] .
carcinogenesis onset is due to deregulation of cell - cell and cell - matrix growth inhibitory interactions and the accumulation of further genetic alterations that leads to activation of proto - oncogenes and inhibition of tumor - suppressor genes [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
after these early events , malignant transformation progresses , governed by a process of darwinian selection during which phenotypes , rather than genotypes , are selected .
this gives tumor cells an advantage over non - transformed cells .
this selection of phenotypes , independent of the associated genotypes , is the basis for the high genetic heterogeneity of cancer cells , since different ( epi ) genetic mechanisms can converge in similar phenotypes [ 7 ] , [ 9 ] .
one of the main phenotypic characteristics of cancer cells is the aerobic glycolysis associated with elevated , but inefficient , atp production , as well as high production of nadph and acids ( h +) such as lactate [ 10 ] .
this phenomenon , known as the " warburg effect " , was described by otto warburg in 1924 [ 11 ] .
it forms the basis for positron emission tomography ( pet ) , a technique that is widely used to detect alterations in glucose consumption in cancer patients .
the high glycolytic rate is not justified by energetic requirements , since more than 80 % of atp synthesis in tumor cells occurs through oxidative phosphorylation , and only about 17 % occurs through the embden - meyerhof pathway ( emp ) .
these proportions are similar to those found in non - tumor cells [ 12 ] .
on the other hand , nadph formation is important for tumor - cell metabolism , since it protects them against oxidative stress and provides fuel for the increased rate of fatty acid synthesis characteristic of cancer cells .
finally , lactate production and microenvironment acidification give tumor cells an advantage over healthy cells , by enhancing their invasiveness and metastasis [ 7 ] , [ 13 ] - [ 16 ] .
surprisingly , acidification of the environment is independent of emp , since in glycolysis - impaired cells this phenomenon is still observable [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
in addition to aerobic glycolysis , the pentose phosphate pathway ( ppp ) is important for tumor metabolism , since more than 85 % of the ribose necessary for nucleic acid synthesis in tumor cells is generated , directly or indirectly , from the nonoxidative branch of the ppp [ 19 ] .
therefore , the ppp lies at the basis of tumor metabolism regulation .
g6pdh and tkt , which control the pathway , are enough to explain the basic metabolic features acquired by tumor cells during their transformation. through the ppp , cells not only synthesize the nucleic acid precursors necessary to maintain the accelerated proliferation rate characteristic in cancer .
g6pdh regulates the flux of the oxidative branch through which nadph is synthesized and co2 is released , leading to matrix acidification by carbonic anhydrase .
the thiamine - dependent enzyme tkt shows the highest control coefficient over the non - oxidative branch of the pathway , revealing its key role in the regulation of the ppp [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
tkt has been postulated to link the ppp and the emp in cancer cells , allowing oxygen - independent glucose degradation [ 22 ] .
on the other hand , the role of tkt in tumor - cell metabolism has been underlined by reports of a significant decrease in tumor - cell proliferation following treatment with specific tkt inhibitors , both in vitro and in vivo [ 21 ] - [ 30 ] .
moreover , when tkt is activated by addition of its cofactor , thiamine , tumor growth is stimulated [ 31 ] .
one tkt and two transketolase - like genes ( tktl1 and tktl2 ) have been described in the human genome [ 32 ] .
this finding led to examine the expression of all three enzymes in cancer cells and conclude that tktl1 was the only one specifically upregulated in tumors [ 33 ] .
subsequent studies revealed that tktl1 is responsible for around 60 % or 70 % of transketolase activity in human hepatoma and colon - cancer cells [ 33 ] - [ 35 ] showing the important role played by this isoenzyme in these tumors .
it has been hypothesized that tktl1 could generate acetylcoa for fatty acid synthesis , which would link anaerobic glucose degradation and lipogenesis [ 32 ] .
moreover , overexpression of the enzyme has been reported in several tumor cells and tissues , e.g. in colon and urothelial cancer [ 33 ] , [ 36 ] , gastric cancer [ 37 ] , various gynecological cancers ( ovarian , granulose cell of the ovary and uterine cervix ) [ 38 ] - [ 40 ] , breast cancer [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] , papillary thyroid carcinomas [ 43 ] and non - small cell lung cancer [ 44 ] .
it has also been demonstrated that the specific inhibition of tktl1 expression by shrna triggers apoptosis and suppresses tumor growth [ 35 ] .
this correlation between the overexpression of tktl1 and tumor growth , poor survival and tumor recurrence , in addition with the transcriptional upregulation of the enzyme expression caused by promoter demethylation [ 45 ] led smith and coworkers to suggest the enzyme as a potential proto - oncogene [ 46 ] .
furthermore , it has also been proposed that tktl1 induces the malignant aerobic glycolytic phenotype by enhancing fructose - 6 - phosphate and glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate production , resulting in elevated fluxes to pyruvate and lactate [ 16 ] , [ 46 ] .
nevertheless , there is a need for more detailed study of the correlation of tktl1 with tumor progression in colorectal cancer , to elucidate its role in lymph - node affection and metastasis .
moreover , to date image quantification of enzyme expression in tissues has been performed by semiquantitative methods based on expert observation and subjective evaluation [ 38 ] , [ 47 ] proving the need of an improvement in the evaluation system that allow obtaining objective results .
here we present a new image analysis quantification method for the evaluation of immunostains that allow us to examine how tktl1 expression varies with the progression stage in a series of colorectal carcinomas .
samples are classified in four groups or stages of progression ( i to iv ) according to the american joint committee on cancer ( ajcc ) staging manual ( sixth edition ) , which takes into account transmural extension , lymph node involvement and presence of distant metastases .
possible correlations between tktl1 expression and tumor progression are explored , to determine its role during tumor development .
results patients expression of tktl1 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 63 patients with primary colorectal cancer ( crc ) .
demographic , clinical and tumor - related characteristics are listed in table s1 and table s2 .
after a median follow - up of 49 months , 26 patients had died .
immunohistochemical detection of tktl1 expression primary tumors incubated with anti - tktl1 antibody showed significant labeling , whereas control samples did not show any unspecific labeling ( figure 1 and figure 2 ) .
levene and cochrand tests did not establish that our data were normally distributed ( results not shown ) so we performed nonparametric tests to assess the significance of the differences. by applying mann - whitney u or kruskal - wallis tests , we confirmed that tktl1 expression was not gender - or age - dependent ( results not shown ) .
clinico - pathological and immunohistochemical data are summarized in table s1 .

tktl1 variations according to tumor stage the expression of tktl1 ranged : from 1.8 to 26.4 a.u .
( mean , 13.3 +/ - 7.9 ) in stage i tumors , from 4.0 to 37.3 a.u .
( mean , 20.8 +/ - 9.9 ) in stage ii , from 17.3 to 50.0 a.u .
( mean , 32.9 +/ - 11.5 ) in stage iii and from 3.7 to 41.3 a.u .
( mean , 13.7 +/ - 8.7 ) in stage iv ( figure 3a ) .
these data demonstrate that expression of tktl1 in stage iii tumors was higher than at any other stage ( kruskal - wallis test , p = 0.00003 , figure 3b ) .
however , one sample ( id. # 7118 ) showed an abnormally highly value ( 41.3 ) in comparison with the rest of the samples of this group .
the dixon 's q - test identified this value as an outlier with a confidence level of 99.9 % and , accordingly , it was excluded from the analysis .
after exclusion of this sample , tktl1 expression in stage iv tumors ranges from 3.7 to 20.8 a.u .
( mean , 12.0 +/ - 5.1 ) and expression of tktl1 in stage iii tumors become even more different ( kruskal - wallis test , p = 0.000008 ) .

( a ) each point corresponds to one sample .
in the stage iv group the cross represents an outlier .
averages are marked by a horizontal black line in each group .
( b ) this box - and - whisker plot shows the differences between groups .
the outlier of stage iv group is represented by a black square .
stage iii group is significantly different from the rest of groups ( kruskall - wallis test , p = 0.000008 ) .
tktl1 expression in stage iii tumors was significantly higher than at any other progression stage .
moreover , when considered separately , almost every individual stage showed significantly different values for tktl1 expression from both the previous and the subsequent stage : stage i showed a tendency to be lower than stage ii ( mann - whitney u test , p = 0.06 ) .
enzyme expression in stage ii tumors was significantly lower than in stage iii tumors ( mann - whitney test , p = 0.02 ) and stage iii values were significantly higher than those of stage iv ( mann - whitney u test , p = 0.000003 ) .
correlation between presence of distant metastasis and tumor tktl1 expression a strong decrease in primary tumor tktl1 expression was observed in patients who presented with distant metastasis .
indeed , samples from patients without metastases ( m0 ) exhibited expression values between 1.8 and 50.0 a.u .
( mean 23.5 +/ - 12.4 ) while values for samples from patients who developed distant metastasis ( m1 ) ranged from 3.7 to 20.8 a.u .
( mean 12.0 +/ - 5.1 ) ( mann - whitney u test , p - value = 0.0004 ) ( figure 4a ) .
taking into account the differences between m0 ( non - metastatic ) and m1 ( metastatic ) tumors , we performed the following comparisons only for samples from the m0 group .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0025323.g004 figure 4 correlation between tktl1 expression and tnm classifications .
these bar charts illustrate the correlation between transketolase - like 1 ( tktl1 ) expression and tumor classification values .
( a ) tumor tktl1 expression in patients who did not present with distant metastasis ( m0 ) is significantly higher than the expression in patients who had developed metastasis ( m1 ) ( mann - whitney u test , p = 0.0004 ) .
( b ) in patients who had not developed metastasis , expression of tktl1 tends to be lower in early stage tumors with respect to transmural invasion ( t1 - 2 ) than in more advanced tumors ( t3 - 4 ) ( p = 0.029 , mann - whitney u test ) .
( c ) lymph node invasion correlates with an increase in tktl1 expression in the primary tumor ( mann - whitney u test , p = 0.0014 ) .
tktl1 involvement in tumor progression with respect to transmural progression , early stage tumors ( t1 and t2 ) presented tktl1 expression values between 1.8 and 45.5 a.u .
( mean 16.5 +/ - 12.6 ) , while expression of the enzyme in more advanced primary tumor ( t3 and t4 ) ranged from 4.0 to 50.0 a.u .
( mean 25.5 +/ - 11.8 ) .
these data indicate a slight increase in tktl1 expression when local development of tumor increases ( mann - whitney u test , p = 0.029 , figure 4b ) .
tktl1 expression in samples without regional lymph - node involvement ( n0 ) ranged from 1.8 to 37.3 a.u .
( mean 18.6 +/ - 9.8 ) , whereas the corresponding values for those with regional lymph - node involvement ( n1 and n2 ) ranged from 17.3 to 50.0 a.u .
( mean 32.9 +/ - 11.5 ) ( mann - whitney u test , p = 0.0014 ) ( figure 4c ) .
tktl1 expression and survival univariate kaplan - meier analysis did not reveal significant association between tktl1 staining and survival in crc tissue samples ( mantel - cox log - rank test , p = 0.37 ) ( figure 5a ) .
on the other hand , when treatment is considered differences arise .
our data reveal a significant association between tktl1 expression and survival in patients treated with 5 - fluoroacyl ( mantel - cox log - rank test , p = 0.017 ) ( figure 5b ) , this correlation is not observed in untreated patients ( mantel - cox log - rank test , p = 0.993 ) ( figure 5c ) .

validation of the image analysis based immunostaining quantification method for the validation of the image analysis quantification method , 5 samples belonging to stage i , ii and iii of progression , and with different tktl1 expression level were analyzed by western blot .
immunodetection of tktl1 and actin as loading control showed a clear correlation between tktl1 expression determined by western blot and by immunohystochemical analysis ( figure 6 ) .

tktl1 protein and actin were analyzed by western blot using specific monoclonal antibodies .
tktl1 / act represents the quantitative analysis of tktl1 corrected by actin .
tktl1 ihc are the expression values of tktl1 determined by immunohystochemical analysis .
all the 5 colon cancer sample homogenates analyzed show similar expression values for tktl1 in both analyses .
discussion the expression of tktl1 has been detected and correlated with several kinds of cancer so far .
most of the authors reporting these correlations follow a protocol analogous to that described in the current paper , using the same antibody and kit for the immunological staining .
however , to date the evaluation of immunostaining was inaccurate , since it has been performed applying a semiquantitative system based on the assignment of scores by observers .
the current manuscript describes a new and more objective system to quantify the staining through computational image analysis .
this technique allows obtaining quantitative data from immunohystochemical staining leading to a more accurate evaluation of enzyme expression .
therefore the reported method is revealed as a really powerful tool for immunohystochemical quantification of protein expression that offers objective numerical data instead of arbitrary scores .
our results provide evidence that tktl1 expression in primary colorectal cancer is strongly correlated with tumor progression .
the capacity to degrade glucose under anaerobic conditions is critical to tumor growth , especially as the primary tumor expands and the internal cells are carried away from the basement membrane and their oxygen supply .
in this situation , tktl1 overexpression confers an advantage on malignant cells and allows them to grow faster .
our data show that tktl1 expression correlates strongly with local progression ( t ) and regional lymph node affection ( n ) .
this is the first time that the correlation between tktl1 expression and n classification has been reported in crc .
moreover , we show that the correlation is stronger than that between tktl1 expression and t classification ( figure 4b and c ) , which indicates that the effect of the enzyme increases as the tumor progresses .
this behavior is consistent with the finding that overexpression of tktl1 favors the anaerobic metabolization of glucose , increasing lactate production and inducing the environment acidification that enhances local invasiveness .
although our data do not reveal any significant association between tumor tktl1 staining and patient survival , the univariate kaplan - meier analysis plotted in figure 5a would tend to suggest that a larger sample might reveal a significant correlation .
furthermore , although the number of samples is small , correlation between tktl1 expression and survival in patients undergoing chemotherapy seems clear .
the observed correlation suggest that 5 - fluoroacyl may be efficient in treating tumors with high levels of tktl1 , those with a high rate of local progression ( figure 5b ) .
however , chemotherapy does not show any effect on survival of patients with tumors containing low levels of the enzyme , the most metastatic ones ( figure 5c ) .
these data suggest that tktl1 levels could be a potential biomarker for predicting tumor response to chemotherapy .
the current study also shows another interesting finding , the highly significant decrease in tktl1 expression observed when comparing non - metastatic patients ( m0 ) with metastatic ones ( m1 ) .
this downregulation of the enzyme when metastasis occurs , like the correlation with the regional lymph - node involvement , has not been reported before .
this is the first time that the expression of tktl1 has been correlated with tumor staging and metastasis formation in crc .
interestingly , similar behavior has been described in the incidence of mutated ras in crc : the incidence of mutation increases from ~ 7 % in early adenoma to ~ 55 % in intermediate , and to ~ 60 % in late carcinomas , but decreases to ~ 45 % in invasive carcinomas , indicating an implication of this mutation in cell aggressiveness but not in metastasized cells [ 7 ] , [ 48 ] .
the regulation of tktl1 expression in tumor cells is largely unexplored , but it has been proposed that it could be upregulated in response to hypomethylation [ 46 ] .
the mechanism responsible for global demethylation in cancer cells remains unknown , although ras family members have been implicated in the regulation of methylation [ 49 ] - [ 52 ] .
in most cases , ras - signaling has been related to hypermethylation and inhibition of tumor suppressor genes .
however , it has also been related to demethylation in some studies [ 53 ] - [ 56 ] .
here we propose a new role for ras - signaling in tumor transformation that consists of the activation by hypomethylation of different oncogenes , including tktl1 in crc .
notably , ras superfamily members have been implicated in the regulation of aerobic glycolysis by increasing glucose uptake and 6 - phosphofructo - 2 - kinase / fructose - 2,6 - bisphosphates 3 ( pfkfb3 ) expression [ 57 ] - [ 59 ] .
pfkfb3 activity causes the accumulation of fructose - 2,6 - bisphosfate ( f26bp ) and the subsequent upregulation of 6 - phosphofructo - 1 - kinase ( pfk - 1 ) activity , which finally leads to elevated lactate production .
the metabolic substrate for pfkfb3 and pfk - 1 reactions , which are essential for lactate production , is fructose - 6 - phosphate ( f6p ) , one of the products of tktl1 .
furthermore , tktl1 overexpression favors normoxic stabilization of the malignancy - promoting transcription factor hypoxia - inducible factor - 1alpha ( hif - 1alpha ) [ 16 ] and the upregulation of downstream glycolytic enzymes such as glucose transporter 1 ( glut1 ) and pfkfb3 [ 16 ] , [ 60 ] .
as we have seen , tktl1 plays an important role in pyruvate and lactate production via its final products , fructose - 6 - phosphate and glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate .
therefore , since pyruvate and lactate regulate hypoxia - inducible gene expression and inactivate hif - 1alpha decay [ 61 ] , [ 62 ] , tktl1 overexpression may stimulate the accumulation of hif - 1alpha in a hypoxic - independent manner and promote the expression of hif - 1 - regulated genes involved in glycolytic metabolism , angiogenesis and cell survival .
in short , during carcinogenesis onset , mutations in ras members could accumulate and lead to tktl1 promoter demethylation and activation of its expression .
this phenomenon would be selected because tktl1 activity would permit transformed cells to consume glucose in the absence of oxygen , produce lactate and acidify their microenvironment , thus strengthening its invasiveness .
tktl1 may also lead to hypoxic - independent hif - 1alpha stabilization and the subsequent overexpression of several glycolytic and angiogenic genes , providing a suitable environment for tumor progression .
regarding metastasis formation two possible mechanisms could explain observed data : i ) tktl1 overexpression not only lead to tumor progression , but also could enable metastasis formation , and when metastasis is established , tktl1 is no longer necessary , and like the incidence of mutated ras , it decreases .
ii ) tktl1 is necessary for tumor progression in situ and local invasiveness , but tumors that do not overexpress the enzyme are incapable of growing in its local environment and induce the metastatic behavior as a tumor survival strategy through a darwinian selection process .
this report sheds light on the role of tktl1 in tumor progression , and aims to be the first step towards a new approach to the study of metastasis and cancer therapy .
materials and methods ethics statement ethics approval for the study was obtained from the ethics committee at the hospital clinic of barcelona , written informed consent was obtained from all patients and all clinical investigation have been conducted according to the principles expressed in the declaration of helsinki .
patients in the current study , 46 men and 17 women ( 70 +/ - 11 years old ) with colorectal carcinoma ( crc ) that underwent surgery between november 2000 and october 2001 were included .
according to tnm classification of colon and rectal cancer of american joint committee on cancer ( ajcc ) , 9 patients presented with stage i tumors , 21 with stage ii , 16 with stage iii and 17 with stage iv. all patients were recruited at the gastroenterology department of the hospital clinic of barcelona , and were part of the epicolon project , a prospective , multicenter , nation - wide , population - based study was aimed at establishing the incidence and characteristics of inherited and familial colorectal cancer forms in spain [ 63 ] .
in this project , all newly diagnosed crc patients in any participating center during one - year period were included in the study .
after surgical resection , patients underwent standard therapeutic and follow - up measures according to recommended guidelines .
indeed , postoperative adjuvant treatment with 5 - fluorouracil and leucovorin was routinely given to patients with stage ii and iii tumours , and radiation therapy was indicated in patients with rectal cancer .
postoperative surveillance consisted of medical history , physical examination , and laboratory studies including serum carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) levels every three months , abdominal ultrasonography or computed tomography every six months , and chest radiograph and total colonoscopy once a year .
furthermore , all tumor recurrences detected during the follow - up were histologically confirmed .
immunohistochemical staining immediately after surgical resection , tumors were snap - frozen and kept in liquid nitrogen .
to perform the staining , crc sections were obtained using vibrotom cuts , were desiccated to prevent degradation and kept at ambient laboratory conditions until use .
colorectal cancer specimens were cut in sections of 2 to 5 microm , placed on slides and fixed with paraformaldehyde .
the slides were hydrated by rinsing them in decreasing concentrations of ethanol .
for antigen unmasking samples were heated to 65degreesc aprox .
in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer ( ph 6.0 ) for 5 min .
after rinsing in destilled h2o , inhibition of endogenous peroxidase was performed with a 10 min incubation with 3 % h2o2 .
slides were washed with pbs and incubated with 3 % bsa in pbs for 15 min to block unspecific staining .
afterward , sections were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti - tktl1 antibody ( clone jfc12t10 ) described previously by coy [ 32 ] at a concentration of 4 microg ml - 1 for 60 min in a humidified chamber at room temperature .
subsequently , slides were washed with pbs , incubated with biotinylated anti - mouse immunoglobulins ( biotinylated link , lsab + - kit , dakocytomation , hamburg , germany ) for 25 min and , after a new wash with pbs , treated with streptavidin - peroxidase ( streptavidin - hrp , lsab + - kit , dakocytomation , hamburg , germany ) for 25 min more .
finally samples were incubated with 3 - 3 ' - diaminobenzidine ( dab + chromogen , dakocytomation , hamburg , germany ) for 20 min at room temperature to obtain the staining .
tktl1 expression was evaluated with image analysis using a leica dm 4000 b microscope ( leica microsystems , germany ) , a monochromatic ieee - 1394 cfw - 1312m camera ( scion corporation , frederik , md , usa ) and the public domain nih imaging software program imagej , available via internet from url : http :// rsbweb.nih.gov / ij / .
the intensity was measured as " relative intensity / area " and quantified by interpolation into a calibration curve plotted using a grey scale .
for each sample 3 or 4 pictures from different areas were captured and the staining of a homolog area of a negative control , incubated with 3 % bsa in pbs without anti - tktl1 antibody , was subtracted .
values are presented as " relative valuex1000 " arbitrary units ( a.u. ) .
this kind of informatics quantification of the staining requires 8 - bit monochromatic images ( figure 2 ) and quantifies grey intensity within a calibration scale [ 64 ] , [ 65 ] giving an evaluation of the tktl1 expression that allows much more objective comparisons between samples than classifications by arbitrary scores .
protein extraction total protein was purified from 6 to 19 mg of frozen surgical specimens .
samples were sonicated at 4degreesc with a titanium probe in lysis buffer containing 20 mm hepes ph 7.5 , 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 0.4 m nacl , 0.4 % ( v / v ) triton x - 100 , 10 mm egta , 5 mm edta , 25 mm naf , 25 mm na beta - glycerophosphate , 1 mm dtt , 1x protease inhibitors , 0.4 mm pefabloc sc and 20 microg / ml pepstatin .
after sonication samples were centrifuged at 4degreesc and 16,000 rcf for 20 minutes .
protein concentration in the supernatants was measured using the bicinchoninic acid ( bca ) assay kit ( pierce , rockford , il , usa ) according to manufacturer instructions .
western blotting western blotting was performed by loading 30 microg of protein on a 10 % sds - polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinyl nitrocellulose transfer membrane ( bio - rad laboratories , richmond ) .
the membrane was blocked by incubation in tbs buffer ( 20 mm tris , ph 7.5 and 132 mm nacl ) containing 0.1 % of tween and 5 % of dry milk , for 1 h , at room temperature and washed three times with tbs - 0.1 % tween .
then , the membrane was blotted with 0.2 microg / ml mouse monoclonal anti - tktl1 antibody ( clone jfc12t10 ) overnight at 4degreesc .
the blot was washed three times with tbs - 0.1 % tween and incubated with hrp - conjugated rabbit anti - mouse secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature .
after secondary antibody incubation , the membrane was washed again three times with tbs - 0.1 % tween .
the blot was developed by enhanced chemiluminiscence using a chemiluminiscence ecl western blotting detection kit reagent and detected using las - 3000 imaging system ( fuji photo film ( europe ) tk tilburg , the netherlands ) .
to verify similar protein loading , after tktl1 detection the membrane was washed three times with tbs - 0.1 % tween and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti - actin antibody ( mp biomedicals , eschwege , germany ) according to manufacturer instructions .
secondary antibody incubation and blot development were performed as described for tktl1 .
statistical analyses all results are expressed as means +/ - sd. statistical analysis was performed using statgraphics software ( statgraphics.net , madrid , spain ) .
outliers were identified using dixon 's q - test , and differences between groups were analyzed by the mann - whitney u - test when two populations were compared and by the kruskal - wallis test when more than two populations were compared .
statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 , and statistical trend was defined as p < 0.1 .

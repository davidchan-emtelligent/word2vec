nonsyndromic deafness is genetically heterogeneous but phenotypically similar among many cases .
though a variety of targeted next - generation sequencing ( ngs ) panels has been recently developed to facilitate genetic screening of nonsyndromic deafness , some syndromic deafness genes outside the panels may lead to clinical phenotypes similar to nonsyndromic deafness .
in this study , we performed comprehensive genetic screening in a dominant family in which the proband was initially diagnosed with nonsyndromic deafness .
no pathogenic mutation was identified by targeted ngs in 72 nonsyndromic and another 72 syndromic deafness genes .
whole exome sequencing , however , identified a p.e313k mutation in nlrp3 , a gene reported to cause syndromic deafness muckle - wells syndrome ( mws ) but not included in any targeted ngs panels for deafness in previous reports .
follow - up clinical evaluation revealed only minor inflammatory symptoms in addition to deafness in six of the nine affected members , while the rest , three affected members , including the proband had no obvious mws - related inflammatory symptoms .
immunostaining of the mouse cochlea showed a strong expression of nlrp3 in the spiral ganglion neurons .
our results suggested that nlrp3 may have specific function in the spiral ganglion neurons and can be associated with both syndromic and nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness .

introduction hearing loss is a common sensory deficit that is genetically heterogeneous .
it is estimated that about 70 % of all inherited deafness is nonsyndromic , while the remaining 30 % is syndromic .
to date , more than 100 loci for nonsyndromic deafness have been mapped ( http :// hereditaryhearingloss.org /) and more than 400 syndromes have been described in which deafness is part of the anomalies .
in some cases , mutations in the same gene can cause both nonsyndromic and syndromic deafness .
while the number of causative genes is usually limited for each individual case of syndromic deafness , nonsyndromic deafness is often phenotypically similar among cases of different molecular etiologies , rendering the genetic diagnosis difficult for this type of hearing loss .
the advent of next - generation sequencing ( ngs ) provided an ideal tool to answer this challenge , as combined technologies of targeted genomic enrichment and high - throughput sequencing make it possible to sequence over a hundred deafness genes simultaneously at a reasonable cost [ 1 , 2 ] .
in recent years , a variety of targeted ngs panels have been implemented in genetic screening of deafness .
the number of targeted genes ranged from 50 to over 200 , typically including all known nonsyndromic deafness genes up to the date of the design and differing in the number of syndromic deafness genes [ 3 - 8 ] .
though those panels theoretically should able to cover most genes associated with nonsyndromic deafness , it remains possible that some syndromic deafness genes outside the panels may lead to clinical phenotypes similar to nonsyndromic deafness .
in this study , we showed one such example in a dominant family segregated with apparently nonsyndromic deafness .
after targeted ngs failed to identify any causative mutation in 144 known deafness genes , an e313k mutation in nlrp3 was revealed by whole exome sequencing which has been previously linked to syndromic deafness muckle - wells syndrome ( mws , omim # 191900 ) [ 9 ] .
reports on such cases may improve the precise genetic diagnosis of deafness .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
subjects a chinese han family ( family c277 ) segregated with autosomal dominant hearing loss was recruited through xinhua hospital , shanghai , china .
as shown in figure 1 , this family consisted of 9 affected family members and 1 unaffected family member .
all affected members had bilateral , late - onset sensorineural hearing loss .
the family members gave written , informed consent to participate in the present study .
this study was approved by the ethics committee of xinhua hospital , shanghai jiaotong university school of medicine .
2.2 .
clinical characterization the hearing levels of all affected family members were measured by air and bone conducted pure tone audiometry .
after detection of the p.e313k mutation in nlrp3 , the affected family members received a follow - up clinical evaluation focusing on the mws - related inflammatory symptoms including chronic fatigue , recurrent fever , headache , ocular symptoms such as conjunctivitis , uveitis , papillary edema , and opticus neuritis , oral ulcers , abdominal pain , proteinuria , musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthralgia , arthritis , and myalgia , and skin symptoms such as erythematous rash and cold - induced urticaria .
2.3 .
targeted ngs and whole exome sequencing genomic dnas from the 10 family members were extracted from whole blood using blood dna kit ( tiangen biotech , beijing , china ) .
targeted ngs of 144 known deafness genes ( see complete list of the genes in supplementary table s1 in supplementary material available online at http :// dx.doi.org / 10.1155 / 2016 / 3018132 ) was performed in proband iii - 3 using the mygenotics gene enrichment system ( mygenotics , boston , md , usa ) and the illumina hiseq 2000 sequencer ( illumina , san diego , ca , usa ) as previously described [ 10 ] .
whole exome sequencing was performed in family members i2 , iii2 , iii4 , and i1 using the agilent sureselect v5 + utr exome enrichment kit ( agilent , santa clara , ca , usa ) and the hiseq x ten sequencer ( illumina , san diego , ca , usa ) as previously reported [ 11 ] .
the reads were aligned to hg19 using the bwa software and the variants were called using the genome analysis toolkit ( gatk ) , both with the default parameters .
snvs and indels were presented using variant call format ( vcf ) version 4.1 and annotated using the annovar software .
to identify the candidate pathogenic mutations , exclusive filtering criteria were applied to the variants including the following : ( 1 ) snvs in nonsplicing region leading to synonymous amino acids ; ( 2 ) snvs and indels called in off - target regions ; ( 3 ) variants with maximum minor allele frequency ( maf ) greater than 0.001 in public databases 1000 genomes project , nhlbi exome sequencing project ( esp ) and the examination for architects in canada ( exac ) .
2.4 .
immunostaining of the mouse cochlea immunostaining of the mouse cochlea was performed as previously described [ 11 ] .
briefly , p60 mouse cochlea was extracted , perfused , and fixed in pfa overnight .
the cochlea was then washed in 0.1 m pbs , incubated in 5 % edta for 5 days , dehydrated in 30 % sucrose , embedded in oct , and frozen at - 20degreesc .
frozen sections ( 10 mum ) were obtained parallel to the modiolus .
the slides were rewarmed at room temperature for 30 minutes , washed in pbs , incubated with a blocking buffer containing 5 % donkey serum , 0.3 % triton x - 100 , and 1 % bsa in pbs for 1 hour at room temperature , incubated in the 1 : 500 mouse anti - tuj1 ( mms435p - 250 , covance , princeton , usa ) and 1 : 200 rat anti - nlrp3 ( mab7578 - sp , rnd , minneapolis , usa ) primary antibodies at 4degreesc overnight , and detected with 1 : 500 secondary antibodies conjugated to alexa 488 and alexa 594 ( jackson immunoresearch , west grove , usa ) .
the slides were mounted in prolong - gold antifade reagent with dapi ( invitrogen , carlsbad , usa ) and examined with confocal fluorescence microscopy ( lsm710 , zeiss , berlin , germany ) .
3. results 3.1 .
auditory characteristics the affected members in family c277 exhibited bilateral , late - onset , slowly progressive hearing impairment ( figure 2 ) .
the age at onset was around 20 years .
the hearing impairment began in the middle and high frequencies , gradually progressed to all frequencies , and eventually reached profound in the sixth decade .
there was no evidence of vestibular dysfunction in any member .
initial clinical evaluation of the proband iii3 revealed no significant abnormalities other than the hearing impairment .
3.2 .
exclusion of 144 known deafness genes to identify the genetic cause of the deafness in family c277 , we first screened 144 known deafness genes in proband iii3 including 72 nonsyndromic and 72 additional syndromic deafness genes .
targeted ngs generated 2514581 mapped reads with an averaged on - target sequencing depth of 299x .
92.4 % of the targeted regions were covered with at least 10x in depth .
a total of four heterozygous nonsynonymous candidate variants with maf of 0.01 or less were identified including p.q1495fs in pcdh15 ( nm _ 001142767 ) , p.m1209i in col4a3 ( nm _ 000091 ) , p.g204s in edn3 ( nm _ 207033 ) , and p.r36h in kcne1 ( nm _ 001127670 ) .
sanger sequencing in all 10 family members , however , revealed that none of the four variants segregated with the hearing loss phenotype in family c277 .
3.3 .
identification of the p.e313k mutation in nlrp3 to further investigate the genetic cause of the deafness in family c277 , we performed whole exome sequencing in affected family members i2 , iii2 , and iii3 and unaffected family member i1 .
the mean sequencing depth for i2 , iii2 , iii3 , and i1 was 76.67x , 93.72x , 91.05x , and 98.94x , respectively .
an averaged 98 % of the targeted region was covered by at least 5x in depth .
a total of seven nonsynonymous candidate variants with maf of 0.01 or less were identified in affected individuals i2 , iii2 , and iii3 but not in unaffected individual i1 .
sanger sequencing in all 10 family members revealed a p.e313k ( nm _ 001127462 : c.g937a ) mutation in nlrp3 , a gene not included in any of the targeted ngs panels for deafness in previous reports ( see section 4 for details ) , as the only pathogenic mutation segregating with the hearing loss phenotype .
the p.e313k mutation is located in the nbs domain of nlrp3 and changed an evolutionary conserved amino acid ( figure 3 ) .
this mutation was predicted as pathogenic by computer programs mutation taster , sift , and provean ( prediction scores of 0.794 , 2.80 , and - 3.02 , resp. ) .
it was not seen in 300 chinese han normal hearing controls .
3.4 .
characteristics of the autoinflammatory abnormalities the p.e313k mutation in nlrp3 has been previously reported to be associated with inherited autoinflammatory disease muckle - wells syndrome ( mws ) [ 9 ] .
a follow - up clinical evaluation therefore was performed in all 9 affected family members focusing on the mws - related autoinflammatory features ( table 1 ) .
different from the previous report , in six of the nine affected members only minor inflammatory symptoms were present including conjunctivitis and uveitis ( n = 4 ) , oral ulcers ( n = 3 ) , arthralgias and arthritis ( n = 1 ) , and erythematous rash ( n = 2 ) .
the rest three affected members i2 , ii5 , and iii3 had no obvious mws - related inflammatory symptoms .
none of the nine affected members had chronic fatigue , recurrent fever , headache , pericarditis , abdominal pain , and proteinuria .
the occurrence of the mws - related inflammatory symptoms was apparently not associated with age .
the affected individual i2 was 80 years old but did not have any inflammatory symptoms .
on the contrary , the affected individual iii - 4 was only 27 years old but showed conjunctivitis , uveitis , and erythematous rash at a quite early age .
3.5 .
expression of nlrp3 in the spiral ganglion neurons immunostaining showed that nlrp3 was strongly expressed in the spiral ganglion neurons of adult ( p60 ) mouse cochlea ( figure 4 ) .
its expression was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm similar to the neural marker tuj1 .
4. discussion in this study , we identified a p.e313k mutation in nlrp3 as the pathogenic cause of the deafness in family c277 .
nlrp3 encodes a pyrin - like protein expressed in innate immune cells such as neutrophils , monocytes , and dendritic cells [ 12 ] .
the nlrp3 protein contains a pyrin domain , a nucleotide - binding site ( nbs ) domain where the e313 amino acid residue resides , and a leucine - rich repeat ( lrr ) motif ( figure 3 ( c )) .
it plays an important role in inflammation , immune response , and apoptosis , while the neurological function of nlrp3 was only implicated in the sensorineural hearing loss [ 13 ] .
dominant mutations in nlrp3 may lead to a spectrum of inflammatory diseases including familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome ( fcas , omim # 120100 ) , muckle - wells syndrome ( mws , omim # 191900 ) , and chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome ( cinca , omim # 607115 ) .
the p.e313k mutation in nlrp3 has been previously reported to be associated with mws [ 9 ] .
mws is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by episodic skin rash , arthralgias , recurrent fever , and renal amyloidosis as well as late - onset sensorineural hearing loss .
in a large dominant family of european descent in the report [ 12 ] , a majority or all of the thirteen affected family members with the p.e313k mutation in nlrp3 had mws - related inflammatory symptoms including chronic fatigue ( 100 %) , recurrent fever ( 31 %) , headache ( 54 %) , ocular symptoms such as conjunctivitis ( 85 %) and uveitis ( 77 %) , oral ulcers ( 46 %) , pericarditis ( 23 %) , abdominal pain ( 31 %) , renal amyloidosis ( 77 %) , musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthralgias ( 85 %) , arthritis ( 69 %) , and myalgia ( 54 %) , and erythematous rash ( 54 %) .
on the contrary , family c277 in our study exhibited a much milder degree of mws - related inflammatory symptoms , in which only 44 % of the nine affected members had conjunctivitis and uveitis , 33 % with oral ulcers , 18 % with erythematous rash , and 11 % with arthralgias and arthritis ( table 1 ) .
chronic fatigue , recurrent fever , headache , pericarditis , abdominal pain , renal amyloidosis , or myalgia was not reported in any of them .
three affected members , i2 , ii5 , and iii3 , were free of mws - related inflammatory symptoms other than the hearing loss ( i.e. , nonsyndromic deafness ) .
the hearing loss in family c277 , therefore , should be regarded as a mixed syndromic ( ii1 , ii2 , ii7 , iii1 , iii2 , and iii4 ) and nonsyndromic ( i2 , ii5 , and iii3 ) deafness depending on the specific affected individuals .
the key symptom in this family overall , however , should be the hearing loss as the inflammatory symptoms were either relatively minor or completely absent .
we speculated that the complicate genotype - phenotype correlation of the p.e313k mutation in nlrp3 can be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors .
the different genetic background of the ethnicity may explain the phenotypic difference observed between the chinese and european families with the same mutation .
the environmental factors may explain the intrafamilial difference observed in family c277 .
due to the mild inflammatory symptoms , the disorder of family c277 was indeed initially diagnosed as nonsyndromic deafness .
to our knowledge , however , nlrp3 was not included in any of the major targeted ngs panels for deafness in the previous and current studies ( supplementary table s2 ) .
the p.e313k pathogenic mutation , therefore , was not identified until whole exome sequencing was performed .
on the other hand , our immunostaining results showed that nlrp3 is strongly expressed in the spiral ganglion neurons of mouse cochlea ( figure 4 ) , implicating a specific role of nlrp3 in the inner ear function .
previous reports showed that early treatment with il - 1 inhibitors anakinra or canakinumab in patients with nlrp3 mutations can improve hearing and prevent irreversible renal damage from amyloidosis [ 12 , 14 ] .
the early genetic diagnosis of nlrp3 mutations , therefore , is essential for proper clinical intervention .
our study suggested that syndromic deafness genes such as nlrp3 should be recognized and targeted for genetic screening of nonsyndromic deafness by targeted ngs .
5. conclusions nlrp3 may have specific function in the spiral ganglion neurons of the cochlea .
mutations in nlrp3 can be associated with both syndromic and nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness .
such genes should be recognized and targeted for genetic screening of nonsyndromic deafness .

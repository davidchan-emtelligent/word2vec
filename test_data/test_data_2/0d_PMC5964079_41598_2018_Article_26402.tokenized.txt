species adulteration in herbal products ( hps ) exposes consumers to health risks .
chemical and morphological methods have their own deficiencies when dealing with the detection of species containing the same active compounds in hps .
in this study , we developed a rapid identification method using the recombinase polymerase amplification ( rpa ) assay to detect two species , ginkgo biloba and sophora japonica ( as adulteration ) , in ginkgo biloba hps .
among 36 ginkgo biloba hp samples , 34 were found to have ginkgo biloba sequences , and 9 were found to have sophora japonica sequences .
during the authentication process , the rpa - lfs assay showed a higher specificity , sensitivity and efficiency than pcr - based methods .
we initially applied the rpa - lsf technique to detect plant species in hps , demonstrating that this assay can be developed into an efficient tool for the rapid on - site authentication of plant species in ginkgo biloba hps .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 introduction herbal products ( hps ) diversely refer to products prepared using plant - derived materials and include dietary supplements , teas , extracts , natural health products and traditional medicines1 .
hps are widely used to treat a variety of health conditions and highly demanded because of their multiple nutritional and medical values2 .
the world health organization ( who ) reported that traditional herbal medicines contribute $ 83 billion us dollars to the global hp market , and international hp trade shares have rapidly increased at approximately 15 % annually3,4 .
however , the lack of standardized methods for the quality assessment of hps poses serious risks to consumers worldwide .
misidentification and substitution of raw materials are the main factors that cause safety problems .
raw materials , such as bark , roots , leaves and seeds , from different plant species must be processed into capsules , tablets , teas or powders during the production process ; thus , using a morphological method ( even under a microscope ) to identify processed herbals in these products is not suitable .
chemical methods are required for the quality assessment of hps to test the main active components according to the chinese pharmacopeia ( 2015 ) ; however , chemical methods are also not sufficient for the assessment of hps because they are complex botanicals and not single - active ingredient products .
chemical methods always encounter barriers when distinguishing different herbal species that share similar chemical compounds within the complex prescription5 .
species adulteration and substitutions with chemical equivalents have had seriously adverse consequences on the health and safety of consumers6 .
ginkgo biloba extract , one of the most popular and scientifically explored hps , is sold worldwide for its symptomatic treatment of deficiencies in memory , concentration , and depression due to organic brain diseases7 .
flavone glycosides ( 24 %) are the standard testing components of commercially sold ginkgo biloba hps8 , and their content in sophora japonica extract is also quite high .
sophora japonica is derived from a completely different genus and has low costs .
therefore , raw sophora japonica materials can be deliberately adulterated as fillers in ginkgo biloba extract to meet market levels and cut production costs .
chemical studies have made only an assumption about this adulteration according to the chemical profile of the detected hp samples9,10 .
a dna - based molecular method is still required to confirm both the listed species ingredients and unlisted fillers used in hps .
an on - site detection method using a dna - based technique will help solve the adulteration problem in hps .
in recent years , researchers have paid increasing attention to dna - based methods for the detection of hps4,11,12 .
polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) is considered a gold standard detection protocol for most dna - based methods .
however , pcr requires high - cost equipment , such as electrophoresis systems , sensors and fluorescence detection optics13 , and detecting pcr amplification results is commonly labour - intensive and has costly read - out processes .
these requirements definitely hinder pcr - based methods from being developed into a rapid on - site authentication method for non - scientist users , such as enterprises and government regulators14 .
thus , development of an efficient technique applicable to the on - site detection of hps is necessary .
recombinase polymerase amplification ( rpa ) is a recently developed isothermal amplification method that offers high sensitivity and specificity for dna detection15 .
rpa can complete an entire reaction at a constant and low temperature , lower than 40 degreesc16 .
this technique includes a nucleoprotein complex formed by the recombinase enzyme , a oligonucleotide primer and dna polymerase i17 .
the nucleoprotein complex and oligonucleotide primer facilitate strand exchange , and dna polymerase i , a staphylococcus aureus homologue , elongates the primer .
rpa is more rapid , convenient and efficient than traditional pcr amplification18 .
for non - specialists and detection conditions with time and resource constraints , less complicated devices , such as lateral flow strips ( lfs ) , can be preferentially selected to detect amplification results19 .
rpa - based testing combined with the lfs assay has been successfully utilized in the fields of in vitro diagnostics , virus detection and pathogen authentication20 - 22 .
however , no use of this assay for the rapid on - site identification of hps has been developed or reported .
herein , we aimed to develop the rpa - lfs assay as a rapid on - site detection method to identify ginkgo biloba and sophora japonica ( as adulterants ) ingredients in ginkgo biloba hps .
results development of species - specific sequences , primers and probes a 114 - bp sequence unique to ginkgo biloba was generated from the alignment of 27 chloroplast rbcl ginkgo biloba sequences , and a 104 - bp sequence unique to sophora japonica was generated from the alignment of 24 internal transcribed spacer 2 ( its2 ) sophora japonica sequences .
details regarding these two sequences are provided in the supplementary information .
basic local alignment search tool ( blast ) results showed that only the targeted species have the corresponding unique sequences found in this study ( supplementary figure s1 ) .
the species specificities of these two sequences were therefore ensured , and the presence of the species was confirmable by the presence of these two sequences in dna extracted from hp samples .
the species specificities of the probes were also evaluated by blast , showing 100 % similarity with the sequences of the targeted species in the ncbi database except for two sophora japonica sequences , which had similarities as high as 98 % ( supplementary figure s2 ) .
details on the primers and probes designed in this study are listed in table 1 .

species - specific motifs were successfully sequenced after pcr amplification with pure dna and the dna mixture using the primers yxf / yxr and hmf / hmr , as expected .
positive rpa results were obtained by lfs after amplification with pure dna and the dna mixture using manually designed primers , yxsf / yxsr and hmsf / hmsr , and probes .
the validity result was shown as positive control in subsequent experiments .
detection of hp samples with pcr - based methods and sequencing to determine whether the hp samples contained sophora japonica or ginkgo biloba , dnas extracted from tea and natural health products ( nhps ) were amplified by pcr using the primers yxf / yxr and hmf / hmr .
the pcr products were visualized after gel electrophoresis , and the bands in the red frames were targeted sequences that were successfully sequenced ( figs 1 and 2 ) .
ginkgo biloba ingredients were found in all 8 tea samples , and no sophora japonica ingredients were observed ( fig. 1 ) .
except for those of samples nhp09 and nhp11 , the pcr products of all other nhp samples were successfully sequenced and identified to contain ginkgo biloba ( fig. 2a ) .
the gel shown in fig. 2b was overexposed to enhance the luminosity of the bands .
the effect comparison of this gel under multiple exposures is shown in supplementary figure s3 .
although the luminosities of bands in lanes 2 , 10 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 and 27 were hardly visible even when overexposed ( fig. 2b ) , the pcr products concentrated with the primer pair hmf / hmr in the corresponding lanes were still successfully sequenced .
pcr products of the other hp samples amplified with the primer pair hmf / hmr were neither visible nor sequenced .
the sequencing results of all hp samples are summarized in supplementary table s1 .

detection of hp samples with the rpa - lfs assay to verify the utility of the rpa method , dnas extracted from tea and nhps were amplified with the primers yxsf / yxsr and hmsf / hmsr and the probes yp and hp. the detection results of 8 tea samples , visualized on lfs tests and obtained using the rpa - lsf assay , were in 100 % accordance with those obtained using the pcr - based method and sequencing ( fig. 3 ) .
the rpa - lsf detection results of nhps amplified with the primer pair yxsf / yxsr also perfectly matched the pcr results ( fig. 4a ) .
however , in the rpa - lsf detection of nhps amplified with the primer pair hmsf / hmsr , adulterated sophora japonica ingredients were detected in 9 samples ( fig. 4b ) .
among these 9 samples , nhp06 and nhp07 were detected to have sophora japonica ingredients that were not observed in the pcr - amplified products .

sensitivity and specificity of the rpa - lfs assay the rpa amplification products of dna diluted 1 to 3 times were successfully detected by lfs , while the amplification of dna 10 - fold serially diluted 4 times was not detectable ( fig. 5 ) .
after diluting pure dna 104 times , the concentration of the diluted dna was too low to be measured .
approximately 1 ng of purified dna was thus determined to be required for the rpa - lfs assay .
the specificity test results for the rpa - lfs assay ( fig. 6 ) indicated that the assay was capable of detecting the targeted species ingredients with high specificity among other flavone - abundant species , including crataegus pinnatifida , epimedium brevicornu , selaginella tamariscina and arisaema heterophyllum .

discussion because the adulteration rate of commercial hps is indeed high , identifying hps at the molecular level is necessary .
in our previous studies , we focused on the identification of ingredients in hps based on species - specific sequences13,23,24 .
we used pcr electrophoresis and sequencing techniques in different cases .
we detected high adulteration rates in various herbal products , including american ginseng , agelicae sinensis , and lonicera japonica .
this study also indicated high adulteration rates in manufactured ginkgo biloba products .
in total , unlisted sophora japonica ingredients were detected in 9 of 36 hps .
among these hp samples , no adulteration was detected in tea samples , most likely because tea products are always obtained by simple processes , and some morphological characteristics of the species can thus be reserved .
compared to tea , products in powder , tablets or capsules are much more prone to adulteration due to their lack of traceable morphological and chemical characteristics .
together , these results demonstrate that more attention must be paid to the assessment and quality control of hps .
molecular authentication methods have proven to be powerful tools for making this assessment and acting as quality control systems25 .
although dna - based identification methods have substantial advantages for assessing hps , obstacles remain that must be overcome26 .
first , raw herbal materials always undergo rigorous manufacturing procedures , such as boiling or grinding , which unavoidably lead to various degrees of dna degradation .
dna degradation further decreases the rate of successfully pcr - amplifying molecular markers , such as traditional dna barcode its and its2 sequences27 .
as a result , these molecular markers may fail to identify species ingredients in hps .
in contrast , shorter sequences are proposed to more efficiently identify hps .
our previous studies proposed a new molecular marker method , termed the nucleotide signature , that utilizes a very short , species - specific sequence .
the nucleotide signature method showed high identification success rates in herbal medicine products .
in this study , our short , species - specific probes , primers and amplification targets were designed based on nucleotide signature sequences .
consequently , only two of 36 ginkgo biloba hp samples failed to contain ginkgo biloba sequences , most likely due to serious dna degradation .
second , traditional pcr - based methods have the potential disadvantage of low accuracy in the downstream detection of amplification products .
in this study , we used electrophoresis to first detect the pcr products and then utilized the sequencing technique to determine the presence of species - specific sequences in the hp samples .
pcr products of sophora japonica - specific sequences in samples nhp 18 , nhp 19 and nhp 27 were hardly visible in an ethidium bromide - stained gel ; however , they were successfully sequenced .
consequently , simply relying on the pcr electrophoresis detection system is not sufficiently accurate. by contrast , the rpa - lfs detection results conformed with the sequencing results , demonstrating that the accuracy of the rpa - lfs method is higher than that of the traditional pcr - based method .
third , some disadvantages of the sequencing technique procedure do exist , including long test periods , high costs and potential judgement inaccuracies caused by sequencing contamination12,28 .
in this study , we used the rpa - lsf assay to circumvent the sequencing process , thus avoiding these possible disadvantages .
the rpa - lsf assay has a series of unique advantages in many aspects .
first , we herein showed that this assay has a high detection sensitivity .
pcr products were not obtained from the nhp 06 and nhp 07 samples amplified with the primer pair hmf / hmr , while sophora japonica dna in these two samples was successfully amplified and detected by the rpa - lsf assay , demonstrating that the rpa - lsf assay indeed had a higher sensitivity than the pcr - based method .
in addition , this conclusion was also directly drawn by comparing the sensitivity measurements in this study ( 1 ng ) to those of our previous study ( 8 ng ) 13 .
yang et al. reported that the sensitivity of rpa is lower than that of rt - qpcr29 ; however , its sensitivity can still be improved using self - avoiding molecular recognition systems ( samrs ) 30 .
second , the rpa - lsf assay has a high amplification efficiency of short sequences , especially of those no more than 200 bp in length .
this specialty makes the rpa technique an ideal choice for circumventing potential dna degradation in hps .
additionally , the entire detection process after dna extraction can be completed in only 30 min without complicated equipment or skills .
this would provide supervision department officers higher work efficiency than any of the other methods discussed thus far .
finally , the rpa - lsf assay is highly specific for the detection of targeted species because of species - specific probes and specially designed primers .
the specificity test showed that no cross - reactivity existed between ginkgo biloba and sophora japonica , and the assay detected only the targeted species among the other common plant species containing abundant flavone compounds .
due to its high specificity , the sequencing technique could be avoided to save time and cost .
however , the extreme high species - specificity of this assay is sometimes a double - edged sword .
on the one hand , accurate detection results are obtained , but on the other hand , the high species - specificity may not be convenient when multiple species in hps must be detected .
fortunately , the rpa assay has been reported to simultaneously amplify and detect dna from multiple parasites when used in combination with specially designed lfs assays31 .
similar systems can be developed for the simultaneous rapid authentication of multiple species components in hps .
conclusion the rpa - lsf assay was initially developed to detect ginkgo biloba and sophora japonica in hps .
in this study , the high efficiency , specificity and sensitivity of this assay were highlighted .
the rpa - lsf assay overcame the disadvantage of chemical methods in identifying different species with similar chemical profiles .
this assay could replace pcr - based methods and be used as a rapid on - site identification method for hps without requiring advanced equipment or complicated professional skills .
further development of this assay for other herbal species could greatly expand the application of commercial hp molecular authentication .
undoubtedly , the utility of the rpa - lsf assay in regulating hps will help further complete assessment and quality control systems and significantly benefit science , industry and consumers .
methods and materials materials and species - specific sequences a total of 36 ginkgo biloba hp samples were bought online , including 28 samples of ginkgo biloba leaf extract and 8 samples of ginkgo biloba leaf tea .
the samples of ginkgo biloba leaf extract used in this study were produced in five different countries , america , australia , china , germany and japan , and all the tea products were produced in china .
details regarding these samples are listed in table s1 .
the manufacturers' names are not shown to protect their identities .
a total of 27 chloroplast rbcl ginkgo biloba sequences were downloaded from the ncbi database , and 24 its2 sophora japonica sequences were generated from our previous study .
to search short and species - specific motifs , the sequences were aligned using mega software , and the blast method was used to verify the species specificities of the motifs .
primers pairs and probe design potential primers for pcr amplification of the species - specific motifs were designed using primer 6.0 software .
the primers and probes used for rpa were manually designed based on suggestions given by twistdx instruction ( www.twistdx.co.uk ) .
verification of species - specific sequences , primers and probes to obtain a positive control , pure ginkgo biloba and sophora japonica dna samples were extracted from the leaves of these two species using a tiangen plant dna kit ( tiangen biotech , china ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
ginkgo biloba dna was amplified with primers yxf / yxr in a 25 microl volume comprising 12.5 microl of 2x taq pcr mix ( tiangen biotech ) , 2.0 microl of forward and reverse primers ( 2.5 microm , total of 4.0 microl of primers ) , 2.0 microl of template dna , 1.0 microl of mg2 + and 5.5 microl of sterile water .
after optimization , pcr amplification of the ginkgo biloba - specific sequence was performed under the following conditions : initial denaturation at 95 degreesc for 2 min , followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 degreesc for 1 min , annealing at 45 degreesc for 30 s , extension at 72 degreesc for 30 s , and a final elongation step at 72 degreesc for 7 min .
similarly , after optimization , sophora japonica dna was amplified with primers hmf / hmr in a 25 microl volume under the following conditions : initial denaturation at 95 degreesc for 2 min , followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 degreesc for 1 min , annealing at 52 degreesc for 30 s , extension at 72 degreesc for 30 s , and a final elongation step at 72 degreesc for 7 min .
then , the dna mixtures of these two species were amplified with primers yxf / yxr and hmf / hmr .
all the pcr reactions were carried out using the geneamp ( r ) pcr 9700 system ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) .
the pcr products were bi - directionally sequenced by the major engineering laboratory of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences university .
rpa amplifications of ginkgo biloba dna , sophora japonica dna and the dna mixture were performed with primers yxsf / yxsr and hmsf / hmsr using the twist amp nfo kit ( twistdx , cambridge , united kingdom ) .
rpa amplification was carried out in a 50 microl volume comprising 2.1 microl of forward and reverse primers ( 10 microm ) , 0.6 microl of probe ( 10 microm ) , 29.5 microl of rehydration buffer , 5 microl of template dna , 8.2 microl of sterile water and 2.5 microl of mgac .
the mixture was incubated in a water bath at 39 degreesc for 20 min , and 5 microl of the amplification product was then diluted in 45 microl of psbt assay buffer .
next , 10 microl of each diluted rpa product was loaded on the lateral flow dipstick ( milenia biotec gmbh , germany ) , which was inserted into 200 ml of psba running buffer .
dna extraction , amplification and sequencing to verify the species in hps for the extraction of dna from ginkgo biloba tea leaves , a total of 20 - 30 mg of tea was placed into a 2.0 - ml centrifuge tube .
then , the sample was milled using a ball - milling machine ( restch , germany ) , and genomic dna was isolated from the resulting powders using a tiangen plant dna kit ( tiangen biotech ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
total dna from one sample was finally dissolved in 50 microl of sterile water .
for the extraction of dna from ginkgo biloba leaf extract , a total of 50 - 60 mg of extract was placed into a 2.0 - ml centrifuge tube ; six tubes were run in parallel for one sample .
three tubes were eluted through one absorption column , and two absorption column products from one sample were finally dissolved in 50 microl of sterile water .
except for the number of tubes ran in parallel , all protocols for the tea and extract samples were the same .
the species - specific sequences within dna extracted from 36 hp samples were amplified by pcr with primers yxf / yxr and hmf / hmr using the same volumes and conditions described above .
the pcr products were bi - directionally sequenced by the major engineering laboratory of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences university .
recombinase polymerase amplification to verify the utility of the rpa - lfs assay rpa amplification of dna isolated from 36 hp samples was performed with primers yxsf / yxsr and hmsf / hmsr according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( twistdx , www.twistdx.co.uk ) .
the amplification products were detected using a lateral flow dipstick ( milenia biotec gmbh ) .
then , the detection results of the rpa - lfs assay were compared with the sequencing results of each sample .
determination of the sensitivity and specificity of the rpa - lfs assay to determine the threshold amount of dna needed for the rpa - lsf assay , pure ginkgo biloba and sophora japonica dna extracted from raw leaves was ten - fold serially diluted to different ratios , ranging from 1 to 4 times .

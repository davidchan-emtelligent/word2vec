hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( hcm ) is the most common cause of scd among the young patients .
scd is often the first manifestation of the disease .
there are 5 major risk factors for scd in patients with hcm .
however , no single risk factor can be used as a screening test in assessment of scd .
nowadays new non - invasive risk factors , such as t - wave alternation ( twa ) , are being studied .
they may provide important information on the patient 's susceptibility to life threatening arrhythmias .
methods the study involved 33 hypertensive heart disease ( hhd ) patients and 22 hcm patients .
all patients underwent echocardiography test ( echo ) and 24h holter monitoring with mtwa evaluation using the modified moving average method .
the evaluation involved maximum mtwa figures in 24h ( mtwa max ) , mtwa figures at the heart rate of 100 / min ( mtwa 100 ) and at 5:00 am ( mtwa 5:00 ) .
results the common group demonstrated a weak direct correlation between the thickness of ventricular septum ( ivsth ) and mtwa max , as well as a weak reverse correlation between the left ventricular posterior wall thickness ( lvpwth ) and mtwa 100 .
these correlation were revealed primarily in hhd patients who demonstrated correlation between mtwa max and ivsth , between mtwa 5:00 and ivsth , lvpwth , as well as between mtwa 100 and lvpwth .
the hcm patients did not demonstrate correlation between mtwa and the thickness of left ventricular wall .
the patients with non - obstructive hcm ( n = 15 ) demonstrated significantly higher mtwa 100 in comparison to the patients with obstructive hcm ( n = 5 ) .
the presence of higher scd risk factors in the hcm patients ( n = 6 ) did not influenced mtwa figures .
the mtwa figures in the hhd and hcm patients differed insignificantly , with the only exception of higher mtwa 5:00 in the hhd in comparison to the hcm group .
conclusions mtwa figures correlate with the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy , however the revealed correlations are weak .
the causes of lower mtwa 100 in patients with more intensive hypertrophy ( reverse correlation ) as well as in patients with obstructive hcm in comparison with non - obstructive hcm call for additional studies .

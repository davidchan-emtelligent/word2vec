objective to investigate the local epidemiology of klebsiella penumoniae carrying bla ctx - m - 15 in southern china and to characterize the genetic environment of bla ctx - m - 15 .
methods pcr and dna sequencing were used to detect and characterize the genetic contexts of bla ctx - m - 15 .
the clonal relatedness of isolates carrying bla ctx - m - 15 was determined by pulse - field gel electrophoresis .
conjugative plasmids carrying bla ctx - m - 15 were obtained by mating and were further subject to restriction analysis and replicon typing .
results a total of 47ctx - m - 15 esbl - producing isolates of k. pneumoniae were collected from nine hospitals in china from october 2007 to october 2008 .
isolates were clustered into various clonal groups .
the local spread of bla ctx - m - 15 was mainly mediated by one major conjugative plasmid as determined by s1 - pfge and restriction analysis .
a 90 - kb plasmid belonging to incompatible group fii was the major carrier of bla ctx - m - 15 in k. pneumoniae .
except bla tem - 1 , the resistance genes such as bla shv , bla dha - 1 , bla oxa - 1 , qnrb , qnrs , aac ( 3 ) - ii , and aac ( 6 ') - ib were not found in the plasmid .
in the comparing of conjugative gene sequence , it is 100 % identical with the plasmid pkf3 - 94 , which was found in k. pneumonia from zhejiang province of china previously .
conclusions bla ctx - m - 15 was prevalent in k. pneumonia of southern china .
the dissemination of bla ctx - m - 15 appeared to be due to the horizontal transfer of a 90 - kb epidemic plasmid .

introduction ctx - m enzymes have emerged as the predominant type of extended - spectrum beta - lactamases ( esbl ) produced by clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae in the world [ 1 ] .
at present , more than 90 ctx - m variants have been designated ( http :// www.lahey.org / studies / other.asp ) , of which ctx - m - 15 is the most prevalent variant globally [ 2 ] .
the global spread of bla ctx - m - 15 is largely due to escherichia coli of sequence type ( st ) 131 and incfii plasmids [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
in china , bla ctx - m - 14 has been the dominant bla ctx - m variant , especially in e. coli [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
a recent small - scale investigation shown that 64.7 % ( 11 / 17 ) e. coli isolates and 27.3 % ( 3 / 11 ) k. pneumoniae isolates carried bla ctx - m - 14 [ 7 ] .
interestingly , 64.3 % of the bla ctx - m - 14 genes were mainly located on an incf plasmid in the 14 bla ctx - m - 14 - positive isolates , which indicate the incf plasmids plays a main role in dissemination of bla ctx - m - 14 among the e. coli isolates in china [ 7 ] .
the resistant rate of ceftazidime has increased sharply in both e. coli and k. pneumoniae recently in china [ 8 ] .
however , the data about bla ctx - m - 15 in klebsiella pneumoniae is scarce , especially the clonal relatedness of the plasmids in k. pneumoniae isolates carrying bla ctx - m - 15 in china .
owing to ctx - m - 15 enzyme hydrolyse ceftazidime at a higher rate than cefotaxime , it was speculated that bla ctx - m - 15 gene may be emerging and spreading in china .
our previous study has also shown that bla ctx - m - 15 had emerged as the more common type of bla ctx - m genes in k. pneumoniae in guangzhou during 2007 to 2008 , and revealed that 28.3 % and 26.1 % esbl - producing k. pneumoniae isolates carried bla ctx - m - 14 and bla ctx - m - 15 , respectively [ 9 ] .
the mechanisms responsible for the high prevalence of bla ctx - m - 15 in k. pneumoniae occurred in the period remained undetermined .
therefore , all of the 47 k. pneumoniae isolates carrying bla ctx - m - 15 from our previous study were studied for clonal relatedness and were also subjected to plasmid analysis including replicon typing and restriction analysis .
this study show that bla ctx - m - 15 was prevalent in k. pneumoniae of southern china and the dissemination of bla ctx - m - 15 appeared to be due to the spread of a 90 - kb epidemic plasmid .
materials and methods clinical isolates clinical k. pneumoniae isolates carrying bla ctx - m - 15 identified in our pervious study [ 9 ] were collected from nine hospitals , as part of the moh national antimicrobial resistant investigation net ( mohnarin ) program from october 2007 to october 2008 .
briefly , nine hospitals are scattered geographically over the three cities in southern china , hospital a , b , c , d , e are located in the city i , and hospital f , g , h in the city ii , and hospital k in the city iii .
hospital a , b , c are close to each other , and the nearest distance between two hospitals is about 1 km , the city ii and city iii are far from the city i , and the distance is about 100 km and 300 km , respectively .
sometimes , the same patients may walk through the hospitals in one city for treatment .
all the 181 isolates k. pneumoniae producing esbls were screened by pcr with special primers for all known ctx - m type encoding gene [ 9 ] .
purified pcr products were directly sequenced from both ends or cloned in pmd18 - t and then sequenced .
the dna sequences and deduced amino acid sequences were compared to genes in genbank or the beta - lactamases classification system ( www.lahey.org / studies / webt.html ) to conform the subtypes of beta - lactamase genes .
the species identification for all isolates was performed using the vitek - 2 ( biomerieux , marcy l'etoile , france ) automated microbiological analyzing system .
antimicrobial susceptibility testing antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates and their transconjugants carrying bla ctx - m - 15 was performed using the microdilution method according to clinical and laboratory standards institute ( clsi ) guidelines [ 10 ] .
antimicrobial agents tested were ampicillin , ampicillin - sulbactam , piperacillin , piperacillin - tazobactam , cefoperazone - sulbactam , cefoxitin , cefotaxime , ceftazidime , cefepime , imipenem , aztreonam , amikacin and ciprofloxacin .
all of the agents were provided by the chinese national institute for the control of pharmaceutical and biological products , except for cefoperazone - sulbactam , which was obtained from pfizer ( new york , ny ). e. coli atcc 25922 was used as the control strain .
isolates were classified as susceptible or resistant according to the interpretative standards recommended by clsi .
clonal relatedness of isolates carrying bal ctx - m - 15 pulsed - field gel electrophoresis ( pfge ) analysis of xbai - digested genomic dna was performed to determine the genetic relatedness of ctx - m - producing k. pneumoniae isolates using a chef - mapper xa system ( bio - rad laboratories , hercules , ca , usa ) as described by seifert [ 11 ] .
the interpreting criteria were described by tenover [ 12 ] combining upgma ( unweighted pair group method with hierarchic averages ) method , isolates were assigned the same pulsetype if the value of dice coefficient of similarity was > 80 % [ 13 ] .
conjugation conjugation experiments were performed in broth as described previously [ 14 ]. k. pneumoniae strains of different clones carrying bla ctx - m - 15 were used as donor strains , while a rifampicin - resistant variant of e. coli strain c600 , c600 ( rif r ) , was used as the recipient .
transconjugants were selected on mh agar ( oxoid , basingstoke , uk ) supplemented with ceftazidime ( 2 microg ml - 1 ) plus rifampicin ( 300 microg ml - 1 ) .
plasmid analysis plasmids from transconjugants were prepared using a modified alkaline lysis method [ 15 ] .
plasmid dna was linearized with the s1 enzyme followed by pfge [ 16 ] .
the estimation of the plasmid size was compared with the molecular weight marker , salmonella braenderup h9812 .
plasmids were restricted with ecori .
plasmid replicons were determined using the pcr - based replicon typing scheme ( pbrt ) by using eighteen pairs of primers to perform pcr which recognized f,fia , fib , fic , hi1 , hi2 , i1 - ic , l / m , n , p , w , t , a / c , k , b / o , x , y and fii replicons as described by carattoli [ 17 ] .
all the primers and targets were listed in table s2 .
to further determine the backbone of the plasmid , the genes traf , trah , tran , trau , traw and trbc , specific to the backbone of f system and ought to demonstrate the relationship of plasmid [ 18 ] , were employed to analyze the backbone of the 90 - kb plasmid by pcr and sequenced .

results of the microdilution method showed that both types of esbl - producing strains had low resistance to imipenem , piperacillin / tazobactam and cefoperazone / sulbactam , with the resistance rate of 2.1 % , 10.6 % and 14.9 % , respectively .
the third - generation cephalosporin and cefepime had an antimicrobial resistance rate ranging from 57.4 % to 89.5 % ( table s1 ) .
clonal relatedness of isolates carrying bla ctx - m - 15 according to the patterns of pfge isolates , 30 pulsotypes were designated for 47 bla ctx - m - 15 - producing k. pneumoniae isolates ( fig. s4 ) .
besides 25 individual pulsotypes , the remaining 22 isolates collected from three hospitals were classified into 5 pulsotypes , designated types a , b , c , d and e ( fig. 1 ) .
five isolates from hospital a belonged to type a , 3 isolates from hospital a and 3 isolates from hospital b belonged to type b , 4 isolates from hospital b belonged to type c , 2 isolates from hospital b and 2 isolates from hospital c belonged to type d , 3 isolates from hospital c belonged to type e. in summary , the small clonal dissemination just occurred in each hospital or near hospital .
there is no a predominant clone carrying bla ctx - m - 15 found in this study .

plasmids carrying bla ctx - m - 15 to determine the role of plasmid in dissemination of bla ctx - m - 15 , the single 90 - kb conjugative plasmids were subject to analyzed .
firstly , all the 90 - kb plasmids were confirmed to be the incfii group by pcr - based replicon typing ( pbrt ) .
restriction analysis revealed that the twenty - one 90 - kb plasmids restricted with ecori had highly similar patterns ( figure 2 ) .
the sequences of traf , trah , tran , trau , traw and trbc in all the 90 - kb plasmids were 100 % identical to the plasmid pkf3 - 94 which is an epidemic plasmid carried bla ctx - m - 15 in zhejiang province of china [ 18 ] .
meanwhile , these sequences were found to have low identities to those of plasmid pc15 - 1a though both were in similar size .
besides , we also found that the length of ecori - ecori fragment of pkf3 - 94 mated with some restriction fingerprints of the epidemic plasmid theoretically , as shown in table s3 , there are 13 restriction fragments digested by ecori in pkf3 - 94 with the similar length of fragments of the restricted plasmids .

the similar patterns were defined with >= 80 % similarity ( upgma , dice ; black vertical line ) .
21 transconjugants containing a single 90 - kb conjugative plasmid carrying bla ctx - m - 15 were analyzed .
to demonstrate that the bla ctx - m - 15 is located on the 90 - kb plasmid of the remaining 9 transconjugants which contains multi - plasmid ( 60 - kb , 90 - kb , 160 - kb ) ( fig. s2 ) , the 90 - kb plasmid dna was acquired by plasmid electrophoresis and gel extraction , and then it was used as a template , bla ctx - m - 15 was amplified by pcr and sequenced .
together , these results indicated that all the 90 - kb plasmid harbored bla ctx - m - 15 .
genetic environment of bla ctx - m - 15 to compare the resistance region between the 90 - kb plasmid and other epidemic plasmids carrying bla ctx - m - 15 , the common elements involved in the mobilization and expression of bla ctx - m - 15 gene were analyzed .
the insertion of isecp1 was observed at 48 bp upstream of the start codon of all the 47 ctx - m - 15 group genes by dna sequence analysis .
is26 , related to the transmission of beta - lactamase genes such as dha - 1 , cfe - 1 , acc - 1 and shv - 2a , was usually found in the incfii plasmid [ 19 ] - [ 20 ] .
however , pcr amplification with primers specific for the tnpa genes of is26 was negative for all 47 ctx - m - 15 groups .
in addition , bla tem - 1 was detected in all the 90 - kb plasmid of transconjugants by sequenced .
other resistance genes such as bla shv , bla dha - 1 , bla oxa - 1 , qnrb , qnrs , aac ( 3 ) - ii , and aac ( 6 ') - ib were not found in the 90 - kb plasmids consistent with the mic data .
discussion here , we show that k. pneumoniae carrying bla ctx - m - 15 have emerged in southern china .
the local spread of bla ctx - m - 15 in k. pneumoniae was not mainly due to one or several dominant clones as various pulsotypes were identified in this study , though there were some medical tourism might occurred among the nine hospitals in the study period , unlike the situation seen in e. coli st131 [ 21 ] .
in contrast to the diversity of clonal relationships , many local isolates harbored a 90 - kb incfii plasmid carrying bla ctx - m - 15 , suggesting that this plasmid appeared to be a major vehicle mediating the local dissemination of bla ctx - m - 15 in k. pneumoniae .
indeed , previous reports [ 1 ] suggested that plasmid is one major factor responsible for the worldwide spread of bla ctx - m - 15 .
for example , in e. coli , many plasmids carrying bla ctx - m - 15 found in france , tunis , bangui and india [ 22 ] - [ 23 ] , shared common features with pc15 - 1a from canada [ 3 ] .
furthermore , emergence of k. pneumoniae isolates producing ctx - m - 15 were also found in european countries and bla ctx - m - 15 transfer were mediated by incfii - related plasmids with different sizes among part of them [ 24 ] .
in this study , non - clonal isolates of k. pneumoniae from different hospitals had the same plasmid carrying bla ctx - m - 15 .
to our best knowledge , this is the first evidence of an epidemic plasmid carrying bla ctx - m - 15 in k. pneumoniae .
incfii - related plasmids are narrow - host range plasmids that are frequently involved in the worldwide dissemination of the bla ctx - m - 15 gene [ 1 ] .
however , unlike plasmids belonging to other incompatibilty groups , incfii - related plasmids possess a great versatility of intracellular adaptation by the rapid evolution of the regulatory sequences of the replicons .
therefore , the backbones of incfii - related plasmids exhibit a significant heterogeneity in terms of the size and number of replicons [ 25 ] .
a genetic comparison of two widely distributed bla ctx - m - 15 - carrying incfii - related plasmids pc15 - 1a and pek516 revealed three genetic events potentially accounted for all of the differences [ 26 ] though a 60 - kb region is higher homologous between the two plasmid which is originated from the non - r - determinant region of plasmid r100 [ 4 ] .
for the 90 - kb incfii - related plasmid identified in this study , it appeared to have genetic components in both the backbone and the resistance region with different origins from those of plasmid r100 .
in contrast , this 90 - kb plasmid appears to be closer to pkf3 - 94 as both plasmids originated from k. pneumoniae , belonged to the incfii group , carried bla tem and bla ctx - m - 15 , and had the same traf , trah , tran , trau , traw and trbc sequences .
the close relatedness between the 90 - kb plasmid and pkf3 - 94 was also evidenced by their almost identical ecori restriction patterns , suggesting that the two plasmids may contain a common backbone .
interestingly , this 90 - kb plasmid was not detected to harbor certain resistance genes such as bla oxa - 1 , qnrb , qnrs , and aac ( 6 ') - ib , which were usually found in other incfii - related plasmid carrying bla ctx - m - 15 .
the phenomenon is also found in the resistance region of pkf3 - 94 as only the isecp1 - bla ctx - m - 15 genetic stucture ( positions 88110 - 88985 ) and bla tem - 1 ( positions 89767 - 90627 ) but no is26 found on pkf3 - 94 .
incfii - related plasmids are complex and sophisticated vehicles mediating the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes .
incfii - related plasmids may co - exist with other inc type plasmids and even are able to co - exist each other due to the differences on the inc sequence , which controls incompatibility in the same hosts [ 27 ] .
the co - existence of plasmids were evidenced that three different sizes of plasmids existed in 9 out of 30 transconjugants containing 90 - kb incfii plasmid .
the extensive recombination between different plasmids or plasmid fusions could facilitate incfii - related plasmids to acquire various resistance genes and therefore generate new vehicles encoding multiple resistances .
it could be predicted that the local 90 - kb incfii - related plasmid or pkf3 - 94 plasmid may evolve into plasmids with new phenotypes by acquiring multiple resistant genes during their further spread .
in summary , this study reveals that a high prevalence of bla ctx - m - 15 genes in k. pneumoniae was contributed to a 90 - kb incfii - type plasmid which has different backbone structure with the epidemic plasmid found in europe and other countries .
it looks like that the epidemic incfii plasmid carrying bla ctx - m - 15 is not restricted in southern china but might have been spread the whole country .

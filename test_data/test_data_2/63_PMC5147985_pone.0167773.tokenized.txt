hydrophobins - - secreted small cysteine - rich , amphipathic proteins - - foster interactions of fungal hyphae with hydrophobic surfaces , and are involved in the formation of aerial hyphae .
phylogenetic analyses of tricholoma vaccinum hydrophobins showed a grouping with hydrophobins of other ectomycorrhizal fungi , which might be a result of co - evolution .
further analyses indicate angiosperms as likely host trees for the last common ancestor of the genus tricholoma .
the nine hydrophobin genes in the t. vaccinum genome were investigated to infer their individual roles in different stages of the life cycle , host interaction , asexual and sexual development , and with respect to different stresses .
in aerial mycelium , hyd8 was up - regulated .
in silico analysis predicted three packing arrangements , i.e. , ring - like , plus - like and sheet - like structure for hyd8 ; the first two may assemble to rodlets of hydrophobin covering aerial hyphae , whereas the third is expected to be involved in forming a two - dimensional network of hydrophobins .
metal stress induced hydrophobin gene hyd5 .
in early steps of mycorrhization , induction of hyd4 and hyd5 by plant root exudates and root volatiles could be shown , followed by hyd5 up - regulation during formation of mantle , hartig ' net , and rhizomorphs with concomitant repression of hyd8 and hyd9 .
during fruiting body formation , mainly hyd3 , but also hyd8 were induced .
host preference between the compatible host picea abies and the low compatibility host pinus sylvestris could be linked to a stronger induction of hyd4 and hyd5 by the preferred host and a stronger repression of hyd8 , whereas the repression of hyd9 was comparable between the two hosts .

introduction the mutualistic ectomycorrhizal symbiosis of basidiomycetes with tree roots plays an important role in forest ecosystems , where trees are connected via fungal mycelia leading to better nutrient and water distribution [ 1 ] .
based on the interaction , the plant benefits from mineral supply , resistance against pathogens , growth promotion and increased metal tolerance , whereas the fungus is supported with growth promoting factors , vitamins and up to 30 % of net photosynthetic carbohydrates ( for review [ 2 ]) .
more than 50 % of the mrnas were differentially expressed upon host interaction in pisolithus tinctorius [ 3 ] .
knowledge on ectomycorrhiza ( ecm ) increased significantly , when studies of gene expression , carbohydrate metabolism or nitrogen transport became available for different ectomycorrhizal fungi .
signaling involved in host recognition , e.g. by abietic acid , oligopeptides , phytohormones , volatiles , and hydrophobins , has been discussed ( for reviews , see [ 2 , 4 , 5 ] and citations therein ) .
more than 6,000 fungal species are estimated to form ecm , with the fungus functionally replaces root hairs by hyphae extending into the surrounding soil , coating the short roots with a pseudoparenchymatic mantle , and penetrating into the extracellular space to form the characteristic hartig ' net , where the exchange of nutrients between both partners takes place ( for review [ 2 ]) .
the genus tricholoma is widely distributed , with 90 - 100 species world - wide , 65 - 70 of which are found in europe [ 6 ] .
these basidiomycetes typically form late stage ecm , associated with slow growth and high adaptive capacity leading to high host specificity .
within the genus , three clades are separated , easily distinguishable by their cap colours with brown , yellow and white / grey capped tricholoma species [ 7 ] .
their mode of living includes saprotrophic growth on plant litter and ectomycorrhiza developed on diverse gymnosperm and angiosperm host trees including pinus , picea , fagus and quercus .
only after the symbiotic association is established , the fungus is capable to form fruiting bodies .
however , the signals that trigger the formation of fruiting bodies remain elusive .
the species t. vaccinum undergoes mutualistic symbiotic interactions with conifers , predominantly spruce , and rarely pine [ 6 , 8 ] .
in axenic co - cultures host specificity is seen with compatible interactions established within weeks , while low compatibility interactions need several months for development [ 8 ] .
in nature , 98 % of the harvested fruiting bodies are found under the native host spruce ( picea abies ) , while 2 % occur near the low compatibility host pinus sylvestris [ 6 ] .
using co - cultures , differential gene expression was analyzed with respect to mycorrhization and host specificity [ 9 ] .
the mediators of interaction between host and fungus in mycorrhiza can be either volatiles or secreted proteins and small organic molecules .
signalling molecules of the plant can be expected in the released exudates that include carbohydrates , low molecular weight aliphatic and aromatic acids , fatty acids , enzymes , phytohormones like indole - 3 - acetic acid , and amino acids like tryptophan , or in the volatiles that may contain ethanol , acetaldehyde and monoterpenes like 1,8 - cineole [ 4 ] .
different chemical composition of tree root exudates , e.g. organic acids , are reported for conifers p. abies and p. sylvestris also in relation to environmental conditions [ 10 , 11 ] .
additionally , ethanol is known to be accumulated in roots especially during hypoxia [ 12 ] .
volatiles of both , the tree and the fungus , include terpenes like pinenes , camphene and limonene , 1 - octen - 3 - ol and 3 - octenone [ 13 ] , and fungus derived sesquiterpenes affect root architecture [ 13 , 14 ] .
plant - derived phytohormones were shown to increase growth and hyphal ramification in t. vaccinum , and the fungus is able to produce indole - 3 - acetic acid [ 8 , 15 ] .
hydrophobins are small , secreted proteins , about 100 amino acids long , with low sequence homologies .
they cluster into class i ( basidiomycetes ) and class ii ( mainly ascomycetes ) with respect to their solubility ; and all contain a consensus of eight cysteine residues' spacing , with disulfide bridges being formed [ 16 ] .
the first hydrophobin characterized was sc3 from schizophyllum commune , a white rot basidiomycete .
this protein plays an essential role in formation of aerial mycelium .
structure predictions as well as pictures showing the formation of rodlet like structures formed on aerial hyphae allowed for an identification of structure - function association in this well - studied system [ 17 - 21 ] .
after secretion of soluble monomers into the medium , it aggregates and covers the hydrophilic hyphae upon conformational change at hydrophilic / hydrophobic interfaces .
the lowered surface tension allows hyphae to breach the surface and grow into the air .
a deltasc3 mutant lacks aerial mycelium , and is easily wettable [ 22 ] .
a further characteristic of hydrophobins covering aerial hyphae is their ability to form rodlet structures , with class i aggregates being smaller in size ( 7 - 15 nm ) , insoluble in water and harder to dissolve as compared to class ii hydrophobins [ 23 , 24 ] .
the protein sc3 is posttranslationally modified by o - glycosylation at thr19 and ser42 with addition of 16 to 22 mannosyl residues [ 25 ] .
similar glycosylation was predicted for hyd1 of t. terreum , since the anti - sc3 antibody recognized primarily the glycosylated molecular pattern [ 26 ] .
using immuno - fluorescence imaging , a host - specific enrichment of this hydrophobin protein in the hartig ' net during a compatible interaction was shown with the native host p. sylvestris , while the low compatibility interaction with spruce showed expression only with hyphae in the mantle of tricholoma mycorrhizal roots [ 26 ]. with s. commune , other hydrophobin genes were shown to be present only in fruiting bodies ( sc1 and sc4 ; [ 27 ]) .
differential roles for different hydrophobins thus is already established with a system that is genetically tractable. with respect to tricholoma , different roles of single hydrophobins might explain the host or substrate specificity [ 26 ] , and further hypothetic functions might be inferred from differential expression , as was the case with the s. commune proteins .
biotic and abiotic factors affect the regulation of hydrophobin genes [ 28 , 29 ] .
in s. commune as well as in lichens , a specifically expressed hydrophobin lines air channels of fruiting bodies or thalli [ 30 ] .
changes in the environment lead to hydrophobin repression , e.g. exposure to cadmium that was suggested to cause a re - direction of metabolic fluxes in paxillus involutus with cysteine being used to form , e.g. , glutathione that is important for complexation and detoxification of heavy metals [ 31 ] .
functions of hydrophobins include regulating cell wall integrity , conidiospore hydrophobicity ( dewa of aspergillus nidulans ) , adhesion in pathogenic interactions ( mpg1 of magnaporthe grisea ) , as well as ectomycorrhizal interactions [ 32 ] .
however , the biological function of hydrophobins is not strictly defined. with this study , a structure prediction using in silico analyses was performed to elucidate the relation between structure and function for aerial hyphae formation of one of the encoded hydrophobins that is found up - regulated in aerial hyphae .
numbers of genes coding for hydrophobins in different basidiomycetes differ , and a probable functional specialization of the different members of the family has been proposed [ 33 ] .
here , we aimed at investigating differential expression of hydrophobins using of all nine hydrophobin genes of t. vaccinum [ 34 ] .
the expression patterns allowed us to infer potential roles for each of the hydrophobins in this fungus which mainly grows as a dikaryon .
previous efforts to produce monokaryons by protoplasting were not successful and the absence of auxotrophic mutants prevents knock - out analyses .
the present work refines our knowledge on hydrophobin regulation , especially with regard to ecm that impacts ecology of forest growth and woodland ecosystem function and stability , as well as the processes involved in establishing the mycorrhizal association .
materials and methods organisms and culture conditions the tricholoma strains used in this study were obtained from the jena microbial resource center ( jmrc , see supporting table 1 in s1 file ) or by collecting fully grown , fresh fruiting bodies around jena , germany (+ 50degrees 55 ' 11.29 , + 11degrees 31 ' 30 ) .
the genome sequence of t. vaccinum gk6514 [ 34 ] was used to obtain hydrophobin sequences from all strains ( ncbi genbank accession numbers : supporting table 2 in s1 file ) .
for dna or rna extraction from fruiting bodies , the samples were ground in liquid nitrogen within 1 h of collection .
to exclude contamination , its pcr was performed [ 35 ]. t. vaccinum was cultivated on half - concentrated mmnb [ 36 ] .
to induce substrate mycelium on soil containing solid media , 10 g / l of commercially available potting soil ( compo gmbh , germany ) was diluted in distilled water .
for metal treatments , 20 d liquid cultures in half - concentrated mmnb were treated for 24 h with sublethal concentration of 0.5 mm nicl2 , cacl2 , cucl2 and 0.05 mm cdcl2 .
the sublethal concentrations had been established by a dilution series that defined inhibitory effects to fungal growth as a dikaryon ( data not shown ) .
the time of 24 h was necessary since the ( non - synchronous ) fungal cells are slow - growing at > 12 h doubling times .
further , we could not record substantial differences in gene expression in shorter time spans .
seeds ( landesforst mecklenburg - vorpommern , germany ) were germinated and grown as previously described [ 9 ] .
root exudates of ten one - month - old plants of p. abies or p. sylvestris were collected under sterile conditions by transferring plantlets into 1 ml sterile pipette tips of a sterile pipette tip box ( standard rack , greiner bio - one gmbh , frickenhausen , germany ) containing 100 ml 20 % mmna solution ( supporting figure 1 in s1 file [ 36 , 37 ]) .
the incubation was performed in a moisture chamber .
after one week of incubation , the liquid was filtered ( millipore 0.22 mum , millipore ) and 70 ml half - concentrated mmnb of a 20 d liquid culture was treated for 24 h with 15 ml of root exudate before extracting rna .
a treatment for 24 hours was necessary to induce gene regulation of the slow - growing ( non - synchronous ) fungal cells and to have a substantial portion of induced hyphae .
for the investigation of potential active substances known from root exudates , indole - 3 - acetic acid ( iaa ) and ethanol were tested .
a pre - grown liquid culture ( 20 d , half - concentrated mmnb ) was supplemented with 0.01 % ethanol or iaa ( 0.1 , 0.01 , 0.001 mm ) dissolved in 0.01 % ethanol for 24 hours .
for the early transcriptional answer of the mycobiont to the exposure to root volatiles , t. vaccinum was cultivated with host on one side containing half - concentrated mmnb of a two - compartment split petri dish on a cellophane membrane ( wilhelm isermann kg , walsrode , germany ) either for 4 or for 20 days .
the plant was placed on mmna medium with root inside , stipe and leaf outside of the dish ( supporting figure 1 in s1 file ) .
an axenic petri dish system was used to synthesize ectomycorrhiza ( supporting figure 1 in s1 file ) as previously described by krause and kothe [ 9 ] , but here the complete seedling was enclosed in the petri dish .
the system was incubated for 6 - 8 weeks , until the typical morphology of ectomycorrhizal root tips was observed .
the mycorrhized area of the root was harvested , aerial mycelium removed and total rna extracted .
quantitative real - time pcr because of low biomass production of the fungus , at least three independent biological replicates were combined , and two technical replicates for each rna isolation were performed [ 38 ] with two reverse transcriptions using 1 mug or 0.1 mug of total rna ( quantitect reverse transcription kit , qiagen ) .
all cdnas were measured 3 times for each gene ( maxima sybr green qpcr master mix , thermo fisher , waltham , ma , usa ) using a smartcycler ii thermocycler ( cepheid , sunnyvale , ca , usa ) .
for amplification of the target hydrophobin genes hyd1 through hyd9 , as well as the reference genes act1 ( actin ) and tef1 ( translation elongation factor ef1alpha ) , oligomers were synthesized by eurofins ( gibco , karlsruhe , germany ; supporting table 3 in s1 file ) .
neither the actin gene nor the elongation factor responded with differential regulation to the different treatments ( supporting figure 2 in s1 file [ 39 , 40 , 41 ]) .
the primers span an intron to identify potential genomic dna contamination visible in different pcr product lengths , e.g. for tef1 150 bp with dna in comparison to 100 bp with cdna .
primer efficiencies were calculated based on the slope of a standard curve generated from series of different cdna concentrations .
the data were normalized and quantified relative to the expression of the reference genes and corrected for the calculated efficiency [ 42 , 43 ] .
unspecific binding of primers to plant rna and genomic dna was not observed .
for expression analysis of t. vaccinum fruiting bodies different primers ( hyd1 - 8fb , supporting table 3 in s1 file ) were used according to the minor changes in the nucleotide sequence .
for the data analysis the efficiency of the primers was set to 100 % .
its and hydrophobin pcr isolated genomic dna [ 44 ] was used for its1 / its4 pcr [ 45 ] with initial denaturation for 120 s at 95degreesc ; 45 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95degreesc , annealing for 30 s at 56degreesc , and extension for 48 s at 72degreesc and hydrophobin amplification with a gradient pcr ( initial denaturation for 120 s at 95degreesc , 45 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95degreesc , annealing for 30 s at 52 - 58degreesc , and extension for 30 s at 72degreesc ; with primers hyd1 - 9ampl , supporting table 3 in s1 file ) .
the amplicons were ligated into a cloning vector ( pdrive , qiagen ) and sequenced with t7 and sp6 primers ( gatc biotech ag ) .
its sequences were compared against ncbi and unite database entries for phylogenetic analyses .
alignments were created with mafft ( version 7.221 [ 46 ] by online server , using q - ins - i strategy for its , default settings for hydrophobin genes and blossum 80 protein substitution matrix ) .
the program mrbayes ( version 3.2 ) was used for phylogenetic analysis [ 47 , 48 ] .
prediction of potential glycosylation sites was performed ( http :// www.imtech.res.in / raghava / glycoep ) .
phylogenetic analyses for all datasets , two runs with each 1,000,000 generations in four chains were performed , with sampling every 100 generations , and with a burn - in of 20 percent ( gtr + g was assumed for its sequences , dayhoff model for hydrophobin protein sequences ) .
full length hydrophobin gene and mature protein sequences were combined to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree .
in order not to confuse the lineages within basidiomycetes by rooting the tree in one of them , the outgroup class ii hydrophobin of paracoccoides brasiliensis was chosen .
bayestraits version 2.0 [ 49 ] was used to obtain ancestral states by maximum likelihood ( default ) and bayesian method ( default , burnin 50000 ) .
the calculation of abundance of tricholoma under a specific host tree was adopted from kriegelsteiner [ 6 ] .
to allow for calculation of ratios , the numbers were classified from percent into classes ( a = 0 % ; b = 1 - 24 % ; c = 25 - 49 % ; d = 50 - 74 % ; e = 75 - 99 % ; f = 100 % , supporting table 4 in s1 file ) .
bayesian results were analyzed with tracer version 1.5 [ 50 ] and visualized with figtree version 1.4.2 [ 51 ] .
the rates of nonsynonymous ( dn ) and synonymous ( ds ) nucleotide substitutions per site for each of the orthologous groups were estimated separately using the crann software [ 52 ] with the hydrophobin 1 gene of moniliophthora roreri mca 2997 ( xm _ 007854886 ) as outgroup .
hydrophobicity was predicted with protscale [ 53 ] with the kyte & doolittle scale [ 54 ] .
secretion signals were checked with signalp ( version 3.0 [ 55 ]) and glycosylation sites with glycoep [ 56 ]) .
i - tasser was used to predict a 3d structure for t. vaccinum hydrophobins [ 57 ] using dewa [ 58 ] , hfb2 [ 59 ] , and eas [ 60 ] as templates with haddock driven prediction to model protein - protein interactions ( f86 = active ; s85 - g89 = passive or f54 = active ; v52 - d55 = passive ; solvent = water [ 23 , 61 ]) .
protein calculator ( innovagen ab , sweden ) was used for the prediction of ph net charge .
the similarities of the secondary structure of the hydrophobins were calculated with matras [ 62 ] .
amino acid similarities of hydrophobins from t. vaccinum fruiting body and t. vaccinum gk6514 were additionally calculated with alignx ( a component of vector nti , invitrogen , 2008 ) to allow for protein similarity comparisons .
to find motifs in mycorrhiza specific genes ( ald1 ( hm363121 ) , mte1 ( kp137511 ) , phospholipase [ 9 ]) their promoters ( - 1000 bp to + 50 bp ) were analyzed with meme suite [ 63 ] and tomtom [ 64 ] to compare against a database of known dna motifs .
statistical treatments fold change values were calculated via deltadeltact method [ 38 ] .
to compare groups , a two - tailed unpaired student 's t - test was used for qrt - pcr data on the fold change values .
significance levels were set to * p - value < 0.05 , ** p - value < 0.005 , *** p - value < 0.005 .
groups of data are given as average values +/ - standard deviation .
results class i hydrophobins of t. vaccinum nine hydrophobin genes were identified from a genomic sequence of t. vaccinum gk6514 based on the lenght of the probable gene , position of introns and the cysteine motif in encoded protein ( table 1 ) .
the hydrophobicity pattern of all hydrophobins from t. vaccinum was consistent with class i hydrophobins ( supporting figure 3 in s1 file ) .
the t. vaccinum proteins shared the typical length of hydrophobins with approximately 100 amino acids , except for hyd7 , which features an extended n - terminus ( 120 amino acids in total ) .
for this protein , as well as for hyd8 , a comparatively high number of putative glycosylation sites were predicted ( see table 1 ) .
as expected , all conceptually translated hydrophobins showed secretion signal peptides and the respective consensus for signal sequence proteases ( supporting figure 4 in s1 file ) .

the average intron length was typical for basidiomycetes with 61 bp ( max 86 , min 50 bp ) .
because of an inverted tandem duplication , the genes hyd3 and hyd4 ( 62 % identity ) are linked with 1163 bp separating the genes including a shared promoter .
duplication for hyd1 and hyd6 with 92 % gene and 93 % protein identity was more recent .
under no tested condition , hyd6 mrna was detectable .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0167773.g001 fig 1 gene and genomic structure of hydrophobins in t. vaccinum .
( a ) the exons of hydrophobin genes are visualized by arrows ; the asterisk shows the position of the 5th cysteine residue within a splice site .
( b ) the genomic structure is presented for the scaffolds of t. vaccinum genome .
in total , 43 tricholoma sequences could be identified with 9x hyd1 , 10x hyd2 , 4x hyd3 , 6x hyd4 , 2x hyd5 , 6x hyd7 , 6x hyd8 ( supporting table 2 in s1 file ) .
there was no hyd6 group , as hyd6 is a duplication of hyd1 and therefore clusters within this group .
in addition , no further hyd9 could be found in other tricholoma species , indicating a strain dependent duplication ( fig 2 ) .
inverse tandem duplication creating genes hyd3 and hyd4 of t. vaccinum gk6514 is assumed to have resulted from a recent event .
the t. vaccinum hydrophobins except hyd7 cluster with the closely related species t. terreum and five ( of eight ) t. matsutake and seven ( of twelve ) hydrophobins of the mycorrhizal fungus laccaria bicolor ( supporting figure 5 in s1 file ) .
thus , hyd7 - like hydrophobins form a separate cluster .
the gene clustering with potential similar regulatory schemes may be indicative of similar functions. t. matsutake hyd7 shows closest sequence similarity , as well as hydrophobicity plot similarity to tvhyd3 of t. vaccinum and sc4 of s. commune with function in fruiting bodies [ 27 ] .
within the same branch of hydrophobins , tmhyd6 is orthologous to tvhyd8 , tvhyd4 and s. commune sc3 ( supporting aerial mycelium formation [ 16 ]) also visible with ph versus net charge profiles ( supporting figure 6 in s1 file ) .
the host specific hyd5 group clustered with hydrophobins of the t. vaccinum fruiting body , t. albobrunneum , t. terreum ( shown to be involved in host interaction as well [ 26 ]) and two sequences of t. matsutake .
their characteristics in hydrophobicity and net charge versus ph are similar .
the rates and patterns of nucleotide substitutions were analyzed by calculating the non - synonymous ( dn ) and synonymous ( ds ) values. of the 102 pair - wise comparisons , 20 showed a dn / ds ratio > 1 , representing a relaxed or positive selection in the hyd1 , hyd3 , hyd4 and hyd7 groups .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0167773.g002 fig 2 consensus phylogram of hydrophobins from genus tricholoma .
gene sequences conceptually translated and protein sequences were used from t. albobrunneum ( ta ) , t. imbricatum ( ti ) , t. fracticum ( tfr ) , t. fulvum ( tf ) , t. imbricatum ( ti ) , t. matsutake ( tm ) , t. terreum ( tt ) , t. ustaloides ( tu ) , t. vaccinum ( tv ) , and fruiting body ( fb ) .
bayesian posterior probability values are shown above corresponding branches ; branch lengths are proportional to evolutionary distances .
the class ii hydrophobin pbhyd2 from the ascomycete paracoccidioides brasiliensis has been included as outgroup .
since we wanted to relate the hydrophobin lineages to functions in mycorrhization , it was necessary to show relationships to other tricholoma species based on its sequences .
the phylogeny of tricholoma species shows three main clusters coinciding with different fruiting body colours ( supporting figure 7 in s1 file ) .
we found the grey - capped tricholoma to be basal , and brown as well as yellow capped species derived. with respect to mycorrhization , the brown and grey tricholoma species are known to mainly form ecm with conifers [ 6 ] , with only few broadleaf associations being present .
the yellow capped species establish mainly strongly compatible ecm interactions with conifers while rarely accepting broadleaved trees such as fagus as low compatibility partners [ 6 ] .
however , the prediction for the ancestral state of host preference showed associations with angiosperms , fagus and betula and / or quercus .
both methods , the markov chain monte carlo and maximum likelihood predictions , revealed fagus and quercus as being ancestral host trees .
in addition , and using only maximum likelihood , a highly compatible association with betula could be seen .
regulatory motifs in hydrophobin gene promoters to find indications for a regulation based on mycorrhizal interactions and to suggest potential roles for single hydrophobins , we checked the promoter regions of hydrophobin genes in comparison with mycorrhiza specific genes ald1 , mte1 and the gene encoding phospholipase b [ 9 ] for regulatory motifs ( fig 3 ) .
using the yeast database regulatory elements corresponding to binding regions for,gcn4 ( activator of amino acid biosynthetic genes ) , mot3 ( repression in hypoxia ) , skn7 ( response to oxidative stress and involved in osmoregulation ) , met32 ( transcriptional regulation of methionine biosynthesis and sulfur metabolism ) , and rim101 ( alkaline response , cell wall assembly , alkaline - stimulated haploid invasive growth and sporulation ) were identified .

predictions were obtained from meme suite and tomtom analysis .
aerial hydrophobins of t. vaccinum to compare hydrophobin coating of aerial mycelium to substrate mycelium growing on compost soil or submerged in liquid media , expression analyses were performed .
although soil did not show significant induction of aerial mycelium formation , a general induction of hydrophobin genes was seen .
this was not the case for hyd8 that was repressed also in immersed culture , but strongly induced in floating mycelium , while hyd9 showed the opposite regulation ( fig 4a ) .
in floating mycelium , in addition to hyd8 , the slight induction of hyd3 and hyd4 was observed .
this is in accordance with the high number of potential glycosylation sites of hyd8 as the major aerial mycelium hydrophobin .

since hydrophobins on aerial hyphae are known to show a distinct rodlet structure , tertiary structure prediction was performed using the well studied spore wall hydrophobin dewa of a. nidulans as a template ( supporting table 5 in s1 file ) .
high similarity was observed for all hydrophobins , with short unaligned n - and c - termini ( supporting figure 8 in s1 file ) .
while there is little conservation of predicted alpha - helices , turns or ungrouped residues were seen and tertiary structure prediction showed the ability to interact for all hydrophobins , alone or in combination .
phenylalanine f86 of hyd8 was active in forming a ring - like super - structure of 7 nm diameter composed of four hydrophobin molecules in one layer ( fig 5a , supporting figure 8 in s1 file ) , while f54 was able to initiate a plus - like structure of hexamers ( fig 5b , supporting figure 8 in s1 file ) .
these plus - like subunits could assemble to a rodlet structure with a diameter of 15 nm. a sheet - like structure was additionally predicted from a packing arrangement ( fig 5c ) .
the in silico analyses indicated the highest incidence for hyd8 to form rodlet structures well supporting this hydrophobin as the major aerial hyphae coating molecule ( fig 4a ) .
the remaining tertiary structures might instead be involved in hypha - hypha contact , host interaction or contact to other surfaces .

host recognition t. vaccinum undergoes mutualistic symbiotic interactions with conifers , predominantly spruce and rarely pine .
this interaction involves the close contact of plant and fungal surfaces in the soil environment .
hydrophobin expression patterns in response to root exudates , root volatiles and in mycorrhizal root tips of p. abies and p. sylvestris were obtained .
depending on the host plant , significant differences in expression profiles of hydrophobins were observed ( fig 4b - 4e ) .
for an early recognition of a potential host , root exudates induced hyd4 , while hyd9 was repressed with both hosts ( fig 4b ) .
compounds found on a regular basis within root exudates , iaa and ethanol , were tested and a significant induction was observed for hyd8 and hyd5 with ethanol at physiologically relevant concentrations of 0.01 % and / or iaa ( fig 4c ) .
statistically significant induction was additionally detected for hyd3 at 0.01 and 0.001 mm iaa .
for hyd4 , the highest induction was observed for ethanol , significantly decreasing with iaa addition .
closer contact to the tree host was tested using root volatiles .
this treatment led to an induction of hyd5 with both hosts ( fig 4d ) .
the gene hyd4 was induced near p. abies , which is in contrast to the spruce root exudates tested above .
after mycorrhiza was established , hyd5 was induced in both interactions with significantly higher induction for the preferred host p. abies ( fig 4e ) .
in addition , the aerial hyphae hydrophobin genes hyd8 and hyd9 were repressed .
fruiting body formation t. vaccinum can produce fruiting bodies only in contact with a host tree .
therefore , we examined fruiting bodies collected near jena .
the homology of the fruiting body its sequence ( kt315517 ) was 99 % compared to t. vaccinum ( fj845444 ) and 92 % for t. vaccinum gk6514 ( ay573538 ) reflecting the known divergency within one species ( see discussion ) .
we examined all nine hydrophobin genes ( without amplificates for hyd6 and hyd9 ) and compared their expression to non - mycorrhizal mycelium of t. vaccinum gk6514 grown on compost soil to obtain patterns specific to fruiting body tissues and not responsive to the soil environment .
induction of hyd3 and hyd8 was detected ( fig 4f ) with 93 % and 87 % sequence identity to t. vaccinum gk6514 hyd3 and hyd8 ( supporting figure 4 in s1 file ) .
metal response in t. vaccinum metal stress was tested , since cell wall adsorption could link metal tolerance to the cell surface and hence hydrophobins covering the hyphae .
exposure for 24 h was chosen to avoid morphological changes , e.g. production of aerial mycelium in long term cultivation .
in all treatments , hyd5 was induced , with significant differences between calcium and copper treatments and between nickel and cadmium treatments ( fig 6 ) .
for cadmium treated mycelium , a general induction of hydrophobin genes ( hyd1 , hyd3 , hyd4 , hyd5 and hyd7 ) was seen .
a specific reduction of hyd9 was visible for the copper treatment .

discussion throughout the life cycle of t. vaccinum , the nine hydrophobin genes are differentially expressed ( fig 4 ) .
the total number corresponds to eight genes with t. matsutake or nine with l. bicolor 81306 , while l. bicolor s238n - h82 carries twelve hydrophobin genes [ 28 ] .
the latter fungus , however , has been found to also contain a high number of transposable elements accelerating evolution [ 28 ] .
differential expression of , among others , hydrophobin genes has been observed by plett et al .
[ 28 ] , which led the authors to conclude that the hydrophobin gene family might have evolved with multiple members to aid the symbiotic lifestyle of ectomycorrhizal fungi .
however , the number of hydrophobin genes in the first fungal species in which hydrophobins have been described , the white rot saprophytic basidiomycete s. commune , is even larger with 12 hydrophobin encoding genes [ 65 ] .
the number of branches in our phylogenetic tree ( fig 2 ) indeed is high which might , just as indicated by plett et al .
[ 28 ] , be a result of co - evolution in plant symbiosis .
the lowering of the surface tension by hydrophobins correlated with a role in aerial mycelium as shown for the s. commune aerial hyphae hydrophobin sc3 .
specifically for the up - regulated hyd8 , hydrophobicity plots showed a similarity ( supporting figure 3 in s1 file ) that might indicate a similar function .
the deletion of sc3 in s. commune resulted in a flat phenotype [ 22 ] , comparable to the substrate mycelium growing on compost soil with repressed hyd8 supporting a functioning in aerial mycelium formation for this hydrophobin .
the regulation of hyd4 and hyd5 reflected host preference .
in early steps of mycorrhization , after recognition of a potential host through root exudates , hyd4 was induced ( fig 4b ) .
this answer is refined in close contact through root volatiles , where only the preferred host induced hyd4 and significantly improved hyd5 expression ( fig 4d ) .
the hydrophobin expression profiles of hyd4 and hyd5 with respect to host specificity could explain , as one factor in the complex gene regulation , the differences in duration for host colonization with different host trees , i.e. few weeks for development of compatible mycorrhiza and three to four months for low compatibility interactions ( fig 4e ). with respect to host specificity , the regulation of hyd4 through exudates may be linked to plant defence .
the net charge profile of hyd4 ( supporting figure 6 in s1 file ) , indicative of surface charge , was similar to that observed for p. tinctorius hydpt - 1 also regulated early in mycorrhization [ 66 ] .
the changes in the ph versus net charge profile may be linked to a function in the adaptation of the hyphal surface to the prevailing conditions in the rhizosphere , where steep gradients from acidic root surfaces to soil occur [ 67 , 68 ] .
the regulatory motif for rim101 , known from saccharomyces cerevisiae for adaptation to alkaline conditions , and from a. nidulans pacc involved in ph response , might be associated with transcription factor binding in t. vaccinum as well .
additionally , the hydrophobicity pattern and phylogenetic analysis of hyd5 showed similarity to lbh9 of l. bicolor [ 28 ] and hyd1 of t. terreum ( fig 2 [ 69 ]) .
the final step in the life cycle of a mycorrhizal fungus is the production of fruiting bodies as place of sexual spore formation .
hydrophobins like s. commune sc4 are specifically expressed in fruiting bodies to avoid water clogging of gas channels [ 70 ] .
similarity to t. vaccinum proteins is seen with hydrophobicity patterns of hyd3 and hyd8 ( supporting figure 3 in s1 file ) , both induced in fruiting bodies ( fig 4f ) .
the role of hyd8 in general decoration of aerial hyphae would be in line with decorating the aerial hyphae of the pileus .
since only fruiting bodies , not all aerial mycelium , contain gas channels , the differential expression pattern of hyd3 would coincide with its lining gas channels within fruiting bodies .
the ability of hydrophobins to form rodlet structures was connected with decoration of hyphae .
using in silico analysis , the potential formation of three distinct structures by all hydrophobins of t. vaccinum was demonstrated ( fig 5 ) .
interestingly , one region of the hydrophobins was highly variable and could be decisive to create hydrophobins with different properties in evolution ( supporting figure 8 in s1 file ) .
the proteins with the longest variable bend were the aerial mycelium induced hydrophobins ( genes hyd3 , hyd4 , hyd8 ) and hyd9 ( supporting figure 8 in s1 file ) .
the main aerial hydrophobin with the longest bend , hyd8 , was shown to potentially form rodlets of expected sizes from ring - like structures [ 24 ] .
rodlets of the plus - like structures are more complex , with four of these subunits assembling to one layer and then forming rodlets by stacking ( fig 5b ) .
for the n. crassa protein eas , stacking by the cys3 - cys4 loop was shown to allow rodlet formation [ 23 ] .
however , the t. vaccinum cys3 - cys4 loop seems too short for the interaction and stacking like in eas .
the third prediction shows similarity to the crystal structure of hfbii , which forms a sheet - like layer ( fig 5c [ 21 ]) .
the result is a two dimensional network of proteins which could occur , for example , at an interface where its viscoelastic properties could add to the stability of adhesion .
as with many different hydrophobin arrangements observed [ 20 ] , the t. vaccinum hydrophobins represent a modular system to establish contact between surfaces .
mycorrhizal fungi are able to enhance metal resistance of their host [ 71 ] .
during metal exposure , regulation of hydrophobin gene expression had been shown before [ 31 , 72 , 73 ] .
potentially , protection of the hyphae by increasing hydrophobicity and hence lowering uptake of toxic metals through hyd5 could play a role ( fig 6 ) .
the ancestral host with ectomycorrhiza has been debated for some time .
for tricholoma , we could show that an angiosperm plant is the likely ancestral host as fagus and quercus were revealed by two independent methods to be the likely ancestral host trees ( supporting figure 7 in s1 file ) .
prior studies postulated independent origins for ecm with angiosperms and gymnosperms [ 74 ] .
host changes and loss of symbiosis have occurred repeatedly within the agaricales [ 75 ] .
surface interactions with the host through hydrophobins , located at the interface between plant and fungus , are likely involved in host switching .
adaptation to a host might be the cause for nucleotide changes in the hyd5 group after gene amplification .
the hyd4 sequences showed even higher numbers of exchanges between different members of this subgroup ( see fig 2 ) , which implies that the first root contact needs less adaption as it seems based on a less conserved hydrophobin function .
both hyd4 and hyd5 , in contrast to general hydrophobins hyd1 or hyd8 , showed accelerated evolution ( dn / ds > 1 ) and a relaxed or positive selection , e.g. for host adaption .
as seen earlier [ 7 ] , its sequence divergence between t. vaccinum isolates was found ; in this study t. vaccinum below p. abies near jena ( germany ) and t. vaccinum fj845444 from canada is 1 % , while 8 % were found between t. vaccinum gk6514 and a strain ( ay573538 ) from nassreith , austria .
our extensive expression profiling thus could provide insight into the evolution and function of hydrophobins .
it suggests an important role of the different hydrophobins for aerial mycelium , fruiting body and ectomycorrhiza establishment and functioning ( fig 7 ) .

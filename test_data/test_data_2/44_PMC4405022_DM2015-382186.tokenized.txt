mixed phenotype acute leukemia ( mpal ) is a complex entity expressing both lymphoid and myeloid immunophenotyping .
in the present study , 47 mpal , 60 lymphoid antigen - positive acute myeloid leukemia ( ly + aml ) , and 90 acute myeloid leukemia with common myeloid immunophenotype ( ly - aml ) patients were investigated .
we found that , in mpal patients , there were high proportions of blast cells in bone marrow and incidence of hepatosplenomegaly , lymphadenopathy , and philadelphia chromosome .
the overall survival ( os ) and relapse - free survival ( rfs ) in mpal patients were significantly shorter than those in ly + aml and ly - aml. with regard to the patients with normal karyotype only , the os and rfs of mpal were significantly lower than those of the ly + aml and ly - aml ; but there were no significant differences in os and rfs among the patients with complex karyotype .
the os rates of 3 groups with complex karyotype were lower than those of patients with normal karyotype .
in cox multivariate analysis , complex karyotype was an independent pejorative factor for both os and rfs .
therefore , mpal is confirmed to be a poor - risk disease while ly + aml does not impact prognosis .
complex karyotype is an unfavorable prognosis factor in aml patients with different immunophenotype .
mixed immunophenotype and complex karyotype increase the adverse risk when they coexist .
1. introduction acute leukemia ( al ) is usually classified as myeloid or lymphoid according to the morphologic , antigenic , cytogenetic , and molecular profile of the blasts .
however , close to 2 to 5 % of cases [ 1 , 2 ] , the lineage of blast cells is not clear because both of the expression of lymphoid and myeloid immunophenotyping can be detected .
in 1995 , criteria for the diagnosis of al with biphenotypic marker were established by the european group for the immunological characterization of leukemia ( egil ) explicitly [ 3 ] , and then this scoring system was improved for al with ambiguous lineages in 1998 .
this scoring system is based on the immunological markers including myeloid or t / b lymphoid blasts specifically to classify biphenotypic al and clinical outcome measurements for many years .
in these criteria , new mixed phenotype acute leukemia ( mpal ) diagnostic classification was established for the clinic treatment and research of this disease .
according to this criteria , the term of mpal ( or biphenotypic or true mixed acute leukemia ) refer to acute leukemias containing the two lineages with specific antigens scores higher than 2 in more than one lineage regardless whether one or more than one population of blasts is seen .
moreover , in ly + aml myeloid blasts coexpress lymphoid antigens but lymphoid antigen score is less than 2 points .
hitherto , although lack of the mpal cases research according to the who 2008 classification was reported , it is well known that mpal appears to be a complex entity with different biological characters [ 4 ] and low survival rates [ 5 ] .
furthermore , following studies demonstrated that expressing both myeloid and lymphoid markers have been regarded as a negative prognostic factor in al [ 6 , 7 ] .
to date , randomized studies about outcome in ly + aml patients have led to inconsistent conclusions and there is lack of reports comparing clinic characteristic and outcome in mpal with ly + aml .
as the result , the therapy for this subtype of leukemia is not consistent .
the goal of present study was to analyze the molecular genetic , cytogenetic , and immunophenotypic features of patients with mpal according to who 2008 classification and the relationship between clinic outcomes and laboratory characteristics .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
patients a total of 197 patients with acute myeloid leukemia diagnosed according to who 2008 criteria [ 8 ] , who were hospitalized at the nanfang hospital ( guangzhou , china ) between january 2002 and october 2013 , were retrospectively enrolled in this study. of these , 47 were patients with mixed immunophenotype acute leukemia ( mpal ) , 60 were with lymphoid antigen - positive acute myeloid leukemia ( ly + aml ) , and 90 were with acute myeloid leukemia with common myeloid immunophenotype ( ly - aml ) .
they were matched based on the subtypes , gender , and age ( table 1 ) .
aml after myelodysplastic syndrome ( mds ) or chronic myeloid leukemia ( cml ) and cases being pml / raralpha - positive were excluded .
cases were classified by morphology and simultaneously by cytochemistry for myeloperoxidase ( pox ) , sodium fluoride sensitive naphthalene acetic acid esterase ( nae / naf ) , and glycogen ( pas ) .
study protocol underwent thorough review and approval process at the hospital 's ethics committee .
informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study .
2.2 .
immunophenotyping fcm immunophenotyping was performed on isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells by flow cytometry after collection according to standard procedure .
all cases were profiled by a panel of leukocyte - associated markers , including cmpo , cd117 , cd13 , cd33 , cd14 , cd15 , cd64 , and cd11b / c for the myeloid lineage ; cycd3 , cd2 , cd5 , cd7 , and cd8 for t - cell lineage , cycd79a , cd22 , cd19 , cd10 , cd22 , and cd20 for b - cell linage ; and cd34 and hla - dr for the stem / progenitor cell clone .
a marker was considered positive when more than 20 % of the blasts showed a positive signal .
2.3 .
cytogenetics conventional cytogenetic analysis was carried out on direct preparations or 24 h unstimulated culture of bone marrow cells according to standard technique of g - banding .
meanwhile , the abnormal cloning was defined based on the criteria from international system for cytogenetic nomenclature ( iscn ) .
fish studies aimed at detecting aml1 / eto , pml / rara , cbfbeta / myhll , bcr / abl , and mll rearrangements as well as p53 , del ( 5q ) , del ( 7q ) , del ( 20q ) , and + 8 were performed according to manufacturer 's instructions .
2.4 .
treatment protocols patients who received at least 2 circles of chemotherapy were involved in current study in order to analyze clinic outcome .
all patients received induction and maintenance treatment according to guidelines set by the hematological society of the chinese medical association .
the induction treatments were as follows : ( 1 ) combined aml / all regimens ( doalp and doap ) , ( 2 ) all - type induction therapy ( vdlp and vdcp ) , and ( 3 ) aml - type induction therapy ( da / dae / ha / ta ) .
meanwhile , they received postremission therapy as follows : ( 4 ) 3 circles of consolidation therapy and less than 3 circles of md - ara - c / hd - mtx , ( 5 ) equal to or more than 3 circles of md - ara - c / hd - mtx or more than 3 circles of hyper - cvad - a / b or autotransplantation after 5 median circles of standard - dose induction therapy , which ranges from 3 to 10 circles , and ( 6 ) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after 3 to 6 circles of consolidation or intensive therapy .
the distribution of cases of induction regimen and consolidation therapy was summarized in table 2 .
2.5 .
statistical analysis the two independent samples nonparametric tests were used for comparison of quantitative data .
kaplan - meier method was used to estimate the long survival of patients .
cox univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors related to os and rfs .
the pearson chi 2 tests were used for the analysis of qualitative data .
all analyses were done with spss version 17.0 , and p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be associated with statistical significance .
3. results 3.1 .
patients patient characteristics were summarized in table 1 .
we identified 47 new patients with mpal which was diagnosed using the who 2008 classification .
compared with ly + aml or ly - aml patients , mpal patients displayed a higher ratio of lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly ( 63.8 %) and higher percentage of blasts in bone marrow ( 67.6 %) .
however , there were no statistical differences between the two groups of ly + aml and ly - aml .
3.2 .
immunophenotype immunophenotype data showed that the positive incidence of cd34 in mpal ( 76.6 %) and ly + aml ( 81.7 %) subtypes was significantly higher than in ly - aml group ( 47.8 %) .
on the contrary , a marker of differentiated cells , cd117 , was significantly lower in mpal cases ( 8.5 %) than ly + aml ( 61.7 %) and ly - aml ( 51.1 %) .
3.3 .
cytogenetics 15 out of 37 mpal patients with available karyotypic data ( 40.5 %) had complex karyotype .
complex karyotype that frequently appeared in mpal was observed in lower incidence in ly + aml ( 11 / 51 , 21.6 %) and ly - aml ( 18 / 90 , 20 %) .
however , it seemed that mpal patients had the lowest incidence of normal karyotype ( 27.0 %) in the three groups ( p = 0.003 ) , and there were no statistical differences between the two groups of ly + aml and ly - aml .
philadelphia chromosome and fused bcr - abl gene incidence were highest in mpal group of patients ( table 1 ) .
fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) examination was done in 34 mpal patients , with details given in table 1 .
both mll gene rearrangement and fused aml1 / eto gene were found to be positive in 1 ( 2.9 %) out of 34 cases analyzed , and bcr / abl rearrangement was present in 7 ( 20.6 %) out of 34 cases .
3.4 .
comparison of various immunophenotype on survival outcomes patients who received at least 2 circles of chemotherapy were involved in current study in order to analyze clinic outcome .
the overall survival ( os ) and relapse - free survival ( rfs ) rates for 35 mpal , 55 ly + aml , and 79 ly - aml patients according to who 2008 criteria were shown in table 2 and figure 1 .
the os and rfs were varied significantly among the three groups according to who 2008 classification ( p = 0.022 and p = 0.014 ). by applying the results of paired comparison , we found that the os in mpal was significantly shorter than that in ly + aml ( p = 0.046 ) and ly - aml patients ( p = 0.006 ) .
meanwhile , the rfs in mpal was also significantly shorter than that in ly + aml ( p = 0.019 ) and ly - aml group ( p = 0.007 ) .
however , the os and rfs were not significantly different between ly + aml and ly - aml groups ( table 2 and figure 1 ) .
3.5 .
treatment response and outcome in ly + aml and ly - aml groups with normal karyotype , complete remission ( cr ) rates were 88.5 % ( 23 / 26 ) and 80.4 % ( 37 / 46 ) after a second induction regimen , which was higher than the cases with complex karyotype ( p = 0.013 and p = 0.029 ) .
however , in mpal group , there was no difference in cr rate between normal karyotype and complex karyotype patients ( 77.8 % versus 46.2 % , p = 0.138 ) .
meanwhile , the overall final complete remission rate after two cycles of chemotherapy of aml patients with different immunophenotype ( mpal , ly + aml , and ly - aml ) had no statistical differences in the same genetic background .
details were shown in table 3 .
when only patients with normal karyotype were considered , mpal patients appeared to have low median survival time ( 6.4 months ) compared with ly + aml ( 29 months ) and ly - aml ( 46 months ) patients .
there was significant difference in overall and relapse - free survival rates among mpal , ly + aml , and ly - aml patients with normal karyotype ( p = 0.002 and p = 0.004 ). by applying the results of paired comparison , the os rate of mpal patients was significantly lower than that of the ly + aml ( p = 0.008 ) and ly - aml ( p = 0.001 ) , but no statistical differences were found between ly + aml and ly - aml patients .
the rfs in mpal with normal karyotype was significantly lower than that in the ly + aml ( p = 0.02 ) and ly - aml ( p = 0.002 ) , but there was no statistical difference between the latter two groups , as shown in figure 2. with regard to the patients with complex karyotype ( except for the cases with ph + chromosome or bcr / abl fusion gene ) , there were no statistical differences among the 3 groups in os and rfs .
the median survival time of patients with complex karyotype in three groups was 7.5 months in mpal , 9.4 months in ly + aml , and 15 months in ly - aml , respectively ( figures 3 , 4 , and 5 ) .
the os and rfs rates of mpal , ly + aml , and ly - aml patients with either normal or complex karyotype were shown , respectively , in figures 3 , 4 , and 5 .
except for the ly + aml group , the rfs rates of mpal and ly - aml patients with complex karyotype were lower than those in patients with normal karyotype ( p = 0.05 and p = 0.04 ) .
there were statistical differences of os between mpal patients with normal and complex karyotype ( p = 0.005 ) .
meanwhile , mpal patients with normal karyotype had distinctly longer median survival time than those with complex karyotype ( median 18 months versus 6 months ) .
furthermore , statistical differences were also found in the ly + aml and ly - aml patients between normal and complex karyotype ( p = 0.027 and p = 0.038 ) .
in the two groups ( ly + aml and ly - aml ) , median survival time was 37.4 and 46 months for patients with normal karyotype versus 7.3 and 15 months for patients with complex karyotype ( figures 3 , 4 , and 5 ) .
in order to clarify whether the parameters with impact on survival added information to other known prognostic factor , analysis of the relative value of the prognostic factors for outcome were based on cox 's proportional hazards regression models for dfs and os. in univariate analysis , 6 variables were included ( age , gender , peripheral white blood cells , blasts in bone marrow , chromosome karyotype , and immunophenotype ) to attempt identifying risk factors relating to os. age , peripheral white blood cells , mpal , complex karyotype , and abnormal karyotype were shown to display adverse prognostic significance on os ( table 4 ) .
however , in multivariate analysis for os , only peripheral white blood cells ( wbc ) and complex karyotype maintained its deleterious independent factor ( table 4 ) .
meanwhile , when analysis was performed in the overall patients , mpal ( p < 0.05 ) and complex karyotype ( p < 0.01 ) in univariate analysis and complex karyotype ( p < 0.01 ) in multivariate analysis were also poor prognostic factors on rfs ( tables 4 and 5 ) .
so it was showed that complex karyotype was an independent pejorative factor for both os and rfs .
4. discussion aml is a genetically heterogeneous disease with widely different treatment outcomes and disparate survivals .
thus , it is important to propose prognostic model effectively for subtype of aml subtypes diagnosis and evaluations of outcome .
now , the most important prognostic factors for aml are age and chromosome karyotype [ 9 , 10 ] .
however , although patients have the same age and chromosome karyotype , the prognosis varies due to other factors , such as mixed phenotype acute leukemia ( mpal ) .
for classification of biphenotypic acute leukemia , several classification systems were released including egil1998 criteria .
although in the last decade , egil1998 scoring system was used widely in clinical practice , limitation still existed because diagnosis of al subtypes strictly according to immunophenotype did not include morphocytology , cytochemistry , and cytogenetics .
also , importantly , another limitation was when immunophenotyping was done only by flow cytometry ; it was difficult to rule out the integral deviation caused by false negative and positive .
in 2008 , new who classification system for classification of mpal was proposed .
in the new scoring system , many parameters such as the flow cytometry , immunohistochemical staining , cytochemical staining , and immune - electron microscopy were used in order to diagnose al subtypes [ 11 , 12 ] .
according to the who 2008 classification of leukemia [ 8 ] , mpal is an independent and uncommon entity .
hitherto , only two largest mpal series which followed the who 2008 criteria have been published , which include the chinese experience published by yan et al. in 2012 with 117 patients [ 4 ] and the european series published by matutes et al. in 2011 [ 12 ] .
here , we conducted a retrospective chart review of 47 mpal patients according to these criteria .
similar to previous reports [ 7 , 12 ] , the proportion of blasts in bone marrow and the incidence of invasion in lymph node , liver , and spleen in mpal group was significantly higher than that in ly + aml and ly - aml groups. and , in the current study , the median age of 34 years at diagnosis and a slight predominance of the male population ( 63.8 %) is similar to that reported by yan et al .
[ 4 ] .
our results also showed a high incidence of philadelphia chromosome positive ( 21.6 %) or bcr - abl translocation ( 20.6 %) in mpal , which was consistent with the report by atfy et al .
[ 13 ] .
as reported by matutes et al .
[ 12 ] and bachir et al .
[ 14 ] , we also observed a high incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities in mpal with only a small number of the cases displaying a normal karyotype .
the previous studies showed that survival in biphenotypic acute leukemia was shorter than in other acute leukemia patients whatever adults or children [ 6 , 7 , 15 - 17 ] .
according to our data , there were distinct os and rfs differences among mpal , ly - aml , and ly + aml .
however , there were no significant differences in os and rfs between ly - aml and ly + aml patients .
these results demonstrated that mpal may be a poor prognostic indicator in aml .
however , it needed to be taken with caution because of the high incidence of complex karyotype in mpal patients included .
therefore , all patients with normal karyotype were considered only , and it was found that the survival of mpal patients was also worse than that in ly + aml and ly - aml .
meanwhile , factors relating to survival were evaluated with the cox proportional - hazards regression model .
as a result , in multivariate analysis , only patients with complex karyotype predicted a shorter os and rfs .
notably , within the mpal group , patients with complex karyotype had shorter survival compared with normal karyotype patients .
similar phenomena were also found on os in ly + aml and ly - aml groups .
these findings demonstrated that complex karyotype was strongly associated with adverse outcome in aml , which was in harmony with several early studies [ 18 , 19 ] .
it also indicated that , when combining mixed immunophenotype and complex karyotype , patients had the shortest os and rfs .
interestingly , with regard to patients with complex karyotype only , there were no statistical differences among the 3 groups in os and rfs .
why did ly + aml and ly - aml patients with complex karyotype present similar survival time with mpal ?
a possible explanation could be that complex karyotype has a more significant impact on clinical outcome in aml patients with no matter which subtype of immunophenotype .
several studies also demonstrated that complex karyotype is a poor prognosis factor [ 18 , 19 ] , and complex karyotype has a high frequency of p53 mutation , which may be associated with poor outcome in aml [ 19 ] .
however , the information of complex karyotype in mpal is limited because of the rarity of cases .
larger prospective studies are required to confirm the findings presented in this study .
though there were lots of studies about outcome when stratifying patients according to immunophenotype or cytogenetic abnormalities , none of these studies analyzed immunophenotyping on the basis of different genetic features in the prognostication .
in multivariate analysis for os , in addition to complex karyotype , peripheral white blood cells ( wbc ) were also found as risk factor as it was also established in report by mikulic et al .
[ 20 ] .
however , all other investigated clinical and biological parameters did not show any significant differences between ly + aml and ly - aml , which was consistent with those of casasnovas et al .
[ 21 ] .
to our knowledge , though there were many studies comparing mpal patients with aml patients , this is the first report about the analysis of clinical feature and prognosis outcome between mpal and ly + aml patients .
in conclusion , mpal is confirmed to be a poor - risk acute leukemia subtype with normal chromosome karyotype , while ly + aml does not impact prognosis .
complex karyotype is an unfavorable prognostic factor in aml patients with different immunophenotype .
moreover , mixed immunophenotype and complex karyotype increase the adverse risk when they coexist .

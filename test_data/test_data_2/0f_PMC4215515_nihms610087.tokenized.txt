th17 and th22 cells are thought to function as innate regulators of mucosal antimicrobial responses , tissue inflammation and mucosal integrity , yet their role in persistent siv infection is still unclear .
here we compared th17 and th22 cells in their phenotype , effector / cytokine function , and frequency in blood and intestinal mucosal tissues , and correlate levels with mucosal damage in siv - infected rhesus macaques .
we found that th17 / th22 cells share similar features in that both highly produce tnf - alpha and il - 2 and express ccr5 in intestinal tissues ; yet very few show cytotoxic functions , as evidenced by lack of ifn - gamma and granzyme b production .
further , th17 / th22 cells display distinct tissue - specific distributions .
both th17 and th22 cells and cytokine secretion were significantly depleted in both blood and intestine in chronically siv - infected macaques .
the frequency of th17 and th22 cells in the intestine positively correlated with percentages of intestinal cd4 + t cells and negatively with damage to intestinal mucosa , and plasma viral loads in siv infection .
these findings indicate th17 and th22 cells share considerable functions , and may coordinate in innate mucosal immune responses , and their regional loss in the intestine may be associated with local mucosal immune dysfunction in persistent hiv / siv infection .
th17 th22 siv hiv intestine mucosal immunology introduction progressive human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) and simian immunodeficiency virus ( siv ) infection is characterized by massive , early loss of cd4 t cells from the intestinal mucosa , as well as by structural disruption of the gut barrier and increased microbial translocation [ 1 - 4 ] .
we and others have shown il - 17 - producing cells are preferentially depleted in the gastrointestinal ( gi ) tracts of hiv - infected humans and siv - infected rhesus macaques ( rms ) [ 5 - 7 ] .
in contrast , th17 cells are maintained at relatively normal levels in the gi tract of siv - infected natural host species , hiv - infected long - term nonprogressors , as well as some patients on antiviral therapy [ 8 - 11 ] .
since they are mostly restricted to mucosal tissues , and since siv and hiv largely replicate in intestinal tissues , it has been suggested these cells may help control infection , as indicated by experiments in macaques correlating levels of the pre - existing th17 cell pool with subsequent limited siv replication [ 12,13 ] .
however , selective loss of th17 in mucosal tissues is associated with compromise of the mucosal barrier , resulting in dissemination of microbial products through the gut into the systemic circulation , [ 14 ] , which in turn results in systemic immune activation , thus contributing to siv / hiv pathogenesis [ 3,12 ] .
th17 cells are able to produce effector cytokines including il - 17 , il - 21 and il - 22 , and mediate host defense against a variety of intestinal pathogens , and they have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases [ 15 - 20 ] .
in addition to host defense and inflammation , il - 17 is also crucial for maintenance of tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells [ 21 ] .
notably , il - 22 is made by both th17 cells and innate lymphoid cells ( ilc ) , as well as a distinct subset of cd4 helper t cells termed th22 cells , which are an important source of il - 22 [ 6,22 ] .
il - 22 is important in promoting innate immune defenses against bacterial and fungal infections in mucosal tissues , and in maintaining mucosal barrier integrity , mucus production , and mucosal tissue remodeling and repair [ 23 - 29 ] .
although th17 and th22 cells share some features , they apparently have distinct roles in the pathogenesis of diseases [ 30 ] .
similar to th17 cells , th22 cells represent a distinct subset of t helper cells , with differentiation - dependent transcription factors distinct from those of th1 , th2 , and th17 cells .
these cells produce il - 22 independent of ifn - gamma and il - 17 [ 31 - 33 ] and their genes encode proteins involved in tissue remodeling and angiogenesis [ 32 ] .
th22 cells are also dramatically depleted during chronic hiv infection , accompanied by compromised epithelial integrity and increased microbial translocation [ 29,34 ] .
th17 / th22 cells may also respond differently to different microenvironments or diseases such as infection , autoimmune disease or allergy [ 35,36 ] .
however , the characterization , and dynamics of th17 / th22 cells in hiv / siv infection is still unclear .
here we characterized the phenotype , polyclonal functions , and tissue distribution of th17 and th22 cells in peripheral blood and intestinal tissues , examined the effects of siv infection on th17 / th22 subsets in siv - infected macaques , and correlated their levels with intestinal cd4 t cells , disruption of intestinal mucosal tissues in vivo , and maintenance of epithelial cells in vitro .
our data show that both il - 17 and il - 22 - producing ( th17 / th22 ) cells are significantly depleted in blood and intestine in persistently siv - infected animals , especially in intestinal tissues , in which th17 / th22 cells highly express ccr5 .
loss of intestinal th17 and th22 cells correlated with reductions in intestinal cd4 + t cells during siv infection , accompanied by damage to the mucosal barrier .
moreover , we show both il - 17 and il - 22 promote intestinal epithelial survival in vitro .
these findings suggest that th17 cells functionally cooperate with th22 cells , and both appear critical in maintaining innate immunity and regulating homeostasis of the gut barrier in hiv / siv infection .
results characterization of th17 and th22 cells in healthy rhesus macaques th17 and th22 cells were defined here defined based on cd3 + cd4 + expression , and their ability to produce il - 17 or / and il - 22 , and levels of each subset were compared in peripheral blood and intestinal tissues of normal ( uninfected ) macaques .
as shown in figure 1a and 1b , th17 cells were present in peripheral blood and intestinal mucosal tissues , yet th17 cells could be divided into two populations based on il - 22 secretion .
similarly , some th22 cells also produced il - 17 , suggesting th17 / th22 cells share overlapping functions .
however , th22 cells showed tissue - specific distribution , as considerable numbers of il - 17 + ( 2.15 %) or il - 17 - th22 cells ( 3.36 %) were detected in peripheral blood , yet dual positive il - 17 + il - 22 + th22 cells were predominantly found in intestinal tissues ( 13.5 % vs 2.46 %) .
notably , the th22 cell subsets , which produced il - 22 but not il - 17 , were relatively rare in mucosal tissues ( figure 1c ) .
as shown in figure 1b and 1c , frequencies of il - 17 + il - 22 - , il - 17 + il - 22 + and il - 17 - il - 22 + cd4 t cell subsets were similar in blood , however , only a small fraction of il - 17 - il - 22 + cd4 t cells were detected in intestinal tissues ( figure 1 ) .
we further examined the ability of th17 / th22 cells isolated from peripheral and intestinal mucosal tissues to produce other effector cytokines .
approximately 50 % of peripheral blood th17 cells were able to secret tnf - alpha or il - 2 .
in contrast , almost all th17 cells from intestinal tissues produced tnf - alpha and il - 2 ( figure 2a , p < 0.05 ) .
both peripheral and intestinal th17 cells produced little ifn - gamma and undetectable levels of granzyme b , suggesting these were not cytotoxic cells .
moreover , blood th17 cells did not express the major hiv / siv coreceptor ccr5 , yet considerable numbers of intestinal th17 cells (~ 40 %) were ccr5 - positive ( figure 2a ) , consistent with previous reports [ 8 ] .
however , in comparison to th17 cells , th22 cells displayed very similar tissue - specific patterns of tnf - alpha and il - 2 secretion , low levels of granzyme b and high ccr5 expression ( figure 2b ) .
notably , intestinal th22 cells were distinct from th17 cells , as indicated by slightly higher capacity to produce ifn - gamma compared to either peripheral or intestinal th17 cells ( figure 2c ) .
these data suggest that th17 / th22 cells share many innate immune functions , and many are direct viral target cells for hiv / siv infection , at least in the intestinal tract .
nonetheless , some intestinal and blood th17 and th22 cells represent distinct functional cell populations as evidenced by the existence of separate il - 22 - th17 and il - 17 - th22 cell subsets in tissues ( figure 2 ) .
collectively , these common and divergent features suggest that th17 cells and th22 cells have many overlapping functions , and both il - 17 and il - 22 may play cooperative roles in regulating mucosal immune responses .
depletion of both th17 and th22 cell subsets occurs in siv - infected macaques to investigate the effects of persistent siv infection on th17 / th22 cell subsets in rhesus macaques , we examined their changes in peripheral blood and jejunum .
in normal , healthy animals , the frequency of th17 and th22 cells were similar in blood ( 1.98 % vs. 2.07 % , respectively ) ( figure 3a and 3c ) , but levels of th17 cells were significantly higher than th22 cells in jejunum ( 6.85 % vs. 3.43 % , p < 0.0001 ) ( figure 3b and 3d ) .
there was also a substantial reduction in frequency of both th17 and th22 cells in the peripheral blood and intestinal mucosal tissues in chronically siv - infected animals , compared with uninfected controls ( p < 0.001 ) ( figure 3 ) .
as shown in figure 4 , all th17 / th22 cell subsets in blood and mucosal tissues were significantly depleted in persistent siv infection .
thus , despite distinct differences in cytokine production , both subsets are depleted , resulting in loss of the major sources of both il - 17 and il - 22 in tissues , which likely contributes to the pathogenesis of hiv / siv infection .
th17 and th22 cells are involved in homeostasis of intestinal epithelial cells , and their loss correlates with disruption of mucosal lymphoid tissues and intestinal cd4 + t cell depletion since both il - 17 and il - 22 play important roles in maintaining mucosal barrier integrity and regulating the function of epithelial cells [ 21,26,37 ] , we stimulated intestinal cells with il - 22 or / and il - 17a for 24h immediately ex vivo , and compared the frequency of live epithelial cells after 24 hrs culture .
percentages of epithelial cells were consistently higher in the presence of il - 22 , il - 17a or both , compared with media controls without stimulation ( figure 3a and 3c ) .
however , there were no significant differences in rates of epithelial cell proliferation ( ki - 67 expression ) between stimulated cells and controls under transient culture ( 24hrs ) ( figure 3b ) , nonetheless , increased survival of epithelial cells ex vivo suggest that il - 22 and il - 17a are both critical for maintaining the viability and homeostasis of intestinal epithelial cells .
we further examined il - 17 and il - 22 producing cells in intestinal tissues by confocal microscopy .
in uninfected animals , single - stained il - 17 + , il - 22 + or dual - stained il - 17 + il - 22 + cells were examined in the intestine ( figure 5d ) .
notably , both il - 17 and il - 22 - producing cells were markedly reduced in chronically siv - infected macaques ( figure 5e ) , consistent with the flow cytometry data ( figures 3 and 4 ) .
both immunohistochemistry and histopathology showed siv - infected animals had mucosal damage characterized by increased collagen deposition ( figure 5f and g ) , and blunting , shortening , and fusion of intestinal villi in the intestinal lamina propria ( figure 5f and 5h ) , compared with uninfected controls ( figure 5g and 5i ) .
these findings suggest that loss of th17 / th22 cells , and the local loss of their crucial cytokines in intestinal tissues is linked with compromised homeostasis of the intestinal mucosal barrier , resulting in the microbial translocation and systemic activation characteristic of siv and hiv infections .
levels of siv peak in plasma 14 ~ 21 days after infection of macaques , followed by gradual reductions in peripheral cd4 t cells ( figure 6a and 6b ) .
however , hiv / siv infection is characterized by profound and rapid depletion of cd4 t cells in the gastrointestinal tract , and levels of residual cd4 t cells inversely correlate with maintenance of intestinal architecture and disease progression in aids [ 38 - 40 ] .
increasing evidence suggests specific subsets of cd4 + t cells ( th17 / th22 ) are responsible for maintaining mucosal epithelial integrity .
we thus correlated levels of th17 / th22 cells with total intestinal cd4 t cells in the gi tract , and with plasma viral loads during siv infection .
the results showed that levels of intestinal th17 cells positively correlated with both total cd4 t cells ( r2 = 0.306 , p < 0.0001 ) ( figure 6c ) and th22 cells ( r2 = 0.796 , p < 0.0001 ) ( figure 6e ) during siv infection .
similarly , levels of th22 cells also positively correlated with total cd4 t cells in intestine , and indirectly with plasma viral loads in plasma in siv infection ( figure 6d and f ) , consistent with previous reports describing disease progression associated with the loss of th17 and / or th22 cells [ 7,41 ] .
discussion hiv / siv infection results in massive loss of cd4 t cells in gi tract , accompanied by compromised mucosal immunity , disruption of the mucosal barrier , and subsequent microbial translocation associated with sustained systemic immune activation that drives hiv replication and persistence .
here , we simultaneously characterized distinct subsets of th17 and th22 cd4 t cells in peripheral blood and in the small intestine ( jejunum ) , compared their levels in chronically siv - infected macaques with uninfected controls , and correlated their levels with disruption of intestinal mucosal architecture .
similar to prior reports in the large intestine [ 7 ] these results show that il - 17 and il - 22 - producing ( th17 / th22 ) cells share common features and functions including their distribution , phenotype , and cytokine production , yet both are largely restricted to mucosal tissues .
both subsets were persistently depleted in intestines of siv - infected animals , and their depletion directly correlates with loss of total intestinal cd4 + t cells during siv infection .
these findings suggest that th17 and th22 cells have overlapping functions , yet are both critical in maintaining innate immunity and mucosal integrity .
th17 and th22 cells represent distinct cd4 t cell lineages , yet they possess a number of similar features [ 30 - 33 ] .
th17 / th22 cells are involved in host defense , maintenance of mucosal integrity and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease [ 13,23 - 25,42,43 ] .
th17 cell differentiation is controlled by the transcription factor retinoid orphan receptor gammat ( rorgammat ) , and these cells are often able to also produce il - 22 [ 44 ] , thus sharing some functions with th22 cells .
th22 cells are mostly localized to mucosal tissues , and are crucial for protecting host mucosal tissues against bacterial infections by their il - 22 production [ 45 ] .
further , although innate lymphoid cells ( ilcs ) are also able to produce il - 22 [ 6 ] , th22 cells are considered to be a major source of il - 22 [ 22 ] .
here we found that il - 17 + il - 22 + cd4 t cells were the predominant th22 cell type in intestinal tissues , with far higher frequencies than il - 17 - th22 cells ( figure 1a and 1c ) .
based on their relative proportions and capacity for secretion in tissues and blood , we speculate that il - 17 + il - 22 + cd4 t cells may be th22 cells , but not th17 cells , but these relationships need to be further investigated .
nonetheless , it is clear that th17 and th22 cells have overlapping functions , and may play coordinated roles in maintaining innate immunity and mucosal structure .
siv infection resulted in marked reductions in both th17 / th22 cells , especially in the jejunum , in which mucosal lymphoid tissues were disrupted .
similar results were recently reported in the large intestine of siv - infected macaques [ 7 ] .
we speculate this loss is due to direct viral infection since at least in the gut , these cells express both cd4 + and ccr5 + .
circulating blood th22 cells express higher levels of the hiv co - receptor ccr5 than th17 cells in humans [ 34 ] .
however , expression of ccr5 appears tissue - specific for both th17 and th22 cells , as both are mostly ccr5 - negative in the peripheral blood yet highly positive for ccr5 in the gastrointestinal tract .
this is also consistent with other reports of ccr5 expression on th17 cells in rms [ 8,46 ] which suggests intestinal th17 / th22 cells could be direct targets of hiv / siv .
in macaques with chronic siv infection , very few il17 / il - 22 - producing cells were detectable ( figurescells in elite control over hiv 3 - 5 ) .
this loss of th17 / th22 cells , which are a major source of il17 / il22 in the gut , correlated with reductions of total intestinal cd4 + t cells ( figure 6 ) , and combined , may be a major factor attributing to the breakdown of mucosal epithelial integrity [ 7,47 ] , leading to microbial translocation and chronic immune activation [ 3 ] .
it is increasingly recognized that il - 17 , in combination with il - 22 , is crucial for protection against bacterial infections in mucosal tissues , and for maintenance of the mucosal barrier by promoting intestinal epithelial tight junction integrity [ 7,12,14,48,49 ] .
thus , depletion of either th17 / th22 cells and other il - 17 / il - 22 - producing cells such as ilcs [ 6 ] results in compromise of mucosal integrity and progression to aids .
therefore , therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving il - 17 / il - 22 producing cells or their function during hiv infection may prevent the loss of epithelial integrity and prevent the microbial translocation which leads to immune activation and higher levels of siv / hiv replication [ 7,34,41,47,50 ] .
in conclusion , th17 and th22 cells display common and distinct phenotypes , and their distribution and function differs between peripheral blood and intestinal mucosal tissues in macaques .
consistent with previous reports in the colon of siv - infected macaques [ 7 ] , here we show both subsets are severely depleted during pathogenic siv infection , and their loss correlates with disruption of the intestinal barrier and the overall loss of intestinal cd4 t cells .
these findings suggest that despite their separate lineages , th17 cells share overlapping features and functions with th22 cells , and may synergistically play major roles in regulating homeostasis of intestinal barriers , and in hiv infection , their loss may be associated with local mucosal immune dysfunction .
experimental procedures animals and virus blood and / or tissues from a total of 93 adult indian rhesus macaques ( macaca mulatta ) , which were negative for siv , type d retrovirus , and stlv - 1 infection were examined to track th17 and / or th22 cells .
all animals were housed at the tulane national primate research center in accordance with the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international standards , and all studies were reviewed and approved by the tulane university institutional animal care and use committee. of the 93 animals , 60 animals were uninfected controls , and others were chronically infected with sivmac251 and examined in the chronic , asymptomatic stages of infection with either no overt signs of disease ( chronic asymptomatic ; n = 33 ) .
to examine cells from intestine tissues at necropsy , macaques were euthanized for tissue collection as uninfected controls ( n = 60 ) , or in chronic infection ( siv infection more than 3 months ) ( n = 23 ) .
for some animals chronically infected with siv , only blood was examined ( n = 10 ) .
th17 cells were analyzed in blood from all 93 animals , and th22 cells were also examined in blood from 21 uninfected , 15 chronically siv - infected , and jejunum cells were examined from 21 uninfected and 15 chronically siv - infected animals .
cell isolation and processing mononuclear cells from peripheral blood and intestinal tissues were isolated and processed as previously described [ 51 ] .
briefly , total peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from edta - treated venous blood by density gradient centrifuge with lymphocyte separation media ( mp biomedicals , llc , santa ana , ca ) as per manufacturers instruction .
tissues were collected from the jejunum within minutes of euthanasia and processed immediately for cell suspensions using enzymatic digestion as previously described [ 6 ] .
phenotyping flow cytometry for surface and intracellular staining was performed using standard protocols [ 52 ] .
cells were stained with : cd3 ( sp34 ) , cd4 ( l200 ) , ccr5 ( 3a9 ) , epithelial antigen ( ber - ep4 , dako ) , tnf - alpha ( mab11 ) , ifn - gamma ( b27 ) , granzyme b ( gb11 ) , il - 2 ( ma1 - 17h12 ) , il - 17 ( ebio64cap17 , ebioscience ) , il - 21 ( 3a3 - n2.1 ) and il - 22 ( il22jop , ebioscience ) , ki67 ( b56 ) , live / dead fixable aqua dead cell stain kit ( invitrogen , grand island , ny ) , all antibodies and reagents were purchased from bd biosciences pharmingen ( san diego , ca ) unless otherwise noted .

data was analyzed with flow jo software ( tree star , ashland , or ) .
ex vivo tissue culture and multi - color confocal microscopy fresh jejunum tissues were obtained from rhesus macaques within 30 min of necropsy and explants prepared and stimulated for detection of il - 17 + or / and il - 22 + cell subsets .
tissues were cut into 1 cm2 sections and cultured in complete rpmi medium ( 10 % heat inactivated fetal calf serum , l - glutamine , penicillin , and streptomycin ; invitrogen ) either alone ( unstimulated media ) or with 100ng / ml phorbol 12 - myristate - 13 - acetate ( pma ) plus 0.5mg / ml calcium ionophore ( stimulation medium ) for 4 hours in the presence of 2microm monensin ( sigma , st.louis , mo ) to block protein transport and release .
tissues were then processed and stained as previously described [ 6 ] .
in brief , tissues were embedded and snap frozen in optimum cold temperature compound ( oct ) and 7um frozen sections were stained using unconjugated primary antibodies ( il - 17 and il - 22 ) followed by appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to alexa 488 ( green ) , alexa 568 ( red ) or ( molecular probes , eugene , or ) .
formalin fixed , paraffin embedded intestinal tissues from uninfected or siv - infected animals were stained for routine histopathology with hematoxylin and eosin , or for immunohistochemistry , with unconjugated primary antibodies ( desmin , d33 , ms - 376 - s1 , fisher scientific ; collagen , polyclonal , ab292 , abcam ) and to - pro - 3 ( life technology ) counterstaining .
confocal microscopy was performed using a leica tcs sp2 confocal microscope equipped with three lasers ( leica microsystems , exton , pa ) .
individual optical slices representing 0.2 um and 32 to 62 optical slices were collected at 512 x 512 pixel resolution .
nih image ( version 1.62 , bethesda , md ) and adobe photoshop ( version 7.0 , san jose , ca ) were used to assign colors to the channels collected : hnpp / fast red ( roche , indianapolis , in ) , which fluoresces when exposed to a 568 - nm wavelength laser , appears red and alexa 488 ( molecular probes ) appears green ( figure 5a and 5b ) .
cell stimulation lymphocytes ( 106 ) from blood and jejunum were stimulated in vitro with 0.1 microm phorbol 12 - myristate - 13 - acetate ( pma ) and 0.5 microg / ml ionomycin ( sigma - aldrich , st.louis , mo ) , cells were cultured for 4 hours in the presence of 5 microg / ml brefeldin a ( sigma - aldrich ) then stained for cell surface markers , fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde , permeabilized in cytofix / cytoperm solution ( bd biosciences ) , and intracellularly co - stained with fluorochrome - labelled antibodies for the cytokines .
for examining the effects of il - 22 / il - 17a on maintenance of intestinal epithelial cells , total cell suspensions containing epithelial cells and lymphocytes isolated from the intestine were stimulated with il - 22 ( 10 ng / ml , biolegend ) , il - 17a ( 10 ng / ml , biolegend ) or both and survival in vitro was compared with controls without cytokine stimulation .
after 24 hours , cells were stained with dead / lived cell staining kit and cell surface markers , and percentages of live epithelial cells were analyzed .
cells were acquired with a lsr ii cytometer ( becton dickinson ) .

background one of the primary reasons for hospitalisation among elderly individuals with heart failure ( hf ) is poor self - care .
self - awareness of having hf may be a key - element in successful self - care .
the prevalence of self - awareness of hf , and how it is affected by age - and hf - related factors , remains poorly understood .
the aims of the present study were to determine the prevalence of self - awareness of hf in participants , >= 80 years of age , and to investigate the association between this self - awareness and age - related and hf - related factors .
methods a single - centre observational study was conducted in which non - hospitalised participants ( 80 +) with objectively verified hf were identified ( n = 90 ) .
the statement of having hf or not having hf was used to divide the participants into two groups for comparisons : aware or unaware of one 's own hf. logistic regression models were completed to determine the impact of age - and hf - related factors on self - awareness .
results twenty - six percent ( 23 / 90 ) were aware of their own hf diagnosis .
no significant differences were found between the participants who were aware of their own hf diagnosis and the participants who were not .
neither age - nor hf - related factors had influence on the prevalence of self - awareness .
conclusions prevalence of self - awareness of own hf in the oldest old is insufficient , and this self - awareness may be influenced by external factors .
one such factor is likely the manner in which the hf diagnosis is relayed to the patient by health care professionals .
keywords heart failure oldest old prevalence self - awareness 80 + issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background the prevalence of heart failure ( hf ) increases with age [ 1 ] and is as high as 22 % among the oldest old , i.e. , people older than 80 [ 2 ] .
elderly individuals with hf are high consumers of healthcare , and poor hf - specific self - care is one of the primary reasons for hospitalisation [ 3 ] .
one of the primary tasks of nurses is to ensure that the person they care for has the ability to conduct hf - specific self - care , and educational interventions conducted by nurses have been proven to improve such self - care in elderly hf patients [ 4 ] .
however , the components that enable the elderly to engage in this specific self - care have yet to be determined [ 5 ] .
for elderly individuals to conduct hf - specific self - care , a prerequisite is that the elderly individual is self - aware of having hf , i.e. , the patient has been informed about the diagnosis and the information has been understood .
previous studies [ 6 - 8 ] that examined the prevalence of self - awareness of hf among patients over 45 years of age with hf found the prevalence to be between 25 - 46 % .
halling and berglund [ 7 ] defined hf based on diagnosis by a primary care physician , regardless of if any objective examinations were the basis for the diagnosis or not .
the risk is , therefore , that elderly were erroneously included or excluded in that study .
furthermore , gure and colleagues [ 6 ] defined hf through medicare claims , and , as the authors themselves noted , there is a financial incentive for healthcare systems to report hf - diagnoses to medicare , even in cases in which an elderly patient has not been diagnosed with hf ; i.e. , participants in their study may have been incorrectly defined as having hf. okura and colleagues [ 8 ] chose to examine both outpatient and inpatient medical records .
a participant in the study by okura et al .
[ 8 ] was considered to have hf if the hf diagnosis was validated with two major criteria or one major and two minor criteria developed by the framingham heart study [ 9 ] .
according to the european society of cardiology ( esc ) guidelines [ 10 ] , hf is a syndrome and a diagnosis of it must be based on clinical signs and symptoms ( i.e. , dyspnoea , oedema or fatigue ) in conjunction with an objective verification .
thus , an hf diagnosis should be verified with an electrocardiogram ( ecg ) and echocardiography or chest x - ray , and preferably also by measuring plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides .
because none of the above - mentioned studies [ 6 - 8 ] used the esc guidelines' recommendations , the potential for selection bias may be present in all three studies .
thus , because of methodological issues in previous studies , some uncertainty remains regarding the prevalence of self - awareness of own hf diagnosis .
because the oldest old is the age group with the highest percentage of hf , this age group should be given priority when self - awareness of own hf - diagnosis is researched .
self - awareness of having a particular illness is arguably crucial to make adequate health decisions and self - awareness may , therefore , be seen as a part of the individual 's health literacy .
thus , self - awareness should not only be influenced by how health information is communicated by the health care professionals [ 11 ] , but also by age - related factors , such as cognitive impairment , dependency in daily functioning and depression [ 12 - 15 ] .
hf - related factors that could be expected to be related to self - awareness of own hf diagnosis ought to be the severity of the illness [ 6 ] , i.e. , functional capacity in relation to hf - symptoms .
there should also be a relationship between the time span linking the date of the hf diagnosis to the date of the questioning , if the patient is aware .
in summary , to conduct hf - specific self - care , a self - awareness of own hf diagnosis needs to be present .
there is a lack of studies that have investigated the prevalence of self - awareness of own hf diagnosis in the oldest old with an objectively verified hf , as well as factors associated with this self - awareness .
our hypothesis is that the prevalence of self - awareness of own hf diagnosis is low in the oldest old and that there is a relationship between this self - awareness and age - and hf - related factors .
the purpose of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of self - awareness of one 's own hf and the association of age - and hf - related factors in people 80 years of age or older with objectively verified hf. methods population study participants were included over a relatively long period of time to build up a sufficient study group and overcome the impact of high mortality in this elderly cohort with hf. therefore , the sample for the present study was collected from the swedish national study on aging and care - blekinge ( snac - b ) .
the snac - b study is a longitudinal , population - based cohort study , conducted in a middle - sized municipality in sweden .
at baseline ( in 2001 ) , the municipality contained approximately 60 600 inhabitants , and the municipality contains both rural and urban areas .
the distribution of age , gender , and functional ability within this sample is similar to that of other rural and urban populations in medium - sized swedish municipalities [ 16 ] .
snac - b includes ten age cohorts ( 60 , 66 , 72 , 78 , 81 , 84 , 87 , 90 , 93 and 96 years ) , of which the four youngest cohorts were randomly selected and the oldest cohorts included all of the inhabitants in respective age cohorts .
invitation to participate was sent by mail , and those who did not respond to the written invitation were also invited to participate through a phone call .
in total , 2 312 community residents were invited and 1 402 agreed to participate in snac - b [ 16 ] .
data from the snac - b study and the other snac sites are available after application to the principal investigator for each site .
more information about available data and contact information can be found at https :// snacsweden.wordpress.com / .
the methodology for the present study has previously been described [ 17 ] , and implies reviews of inpatient records of those snac - b participants who were 80 years and older in 2012 ( n = 1003 ) to identify participants with an objectively verified hf. two hundred - and - forty - one participants had no computerized medical record and were therefore excluded .
to be included in our study the participant 's inpatient record should include : ( a ) notes about hf symptoms ( dyspnoea , oedema or fatigue ) ; ( b ) a pathological ecg ; and ( c ) an objective confirmation of the hf diagnosis by either echocardiography or chest x - ray .
for inclusion in our study , the participant also had to be at least 80 years old when diagnosed with hf. since self - awareness of own hf diagnosis and hf - specific self - care is equally important regardless of housing , participants were included irrespective of whether they lived in their own homes or in a sheltered accommodation. participants .
>= 80 years of age , were followed - up every three years between 2001 and 2012 , i.e. , at four different occasions ( fig. 1 ). fig. 1 flowchart of when informants >= 80 years old ( in 2012 ) were diagnosed with heart failure ( hf ) ( n = 265 ) and reasons for exclusion data collection and measurements after giving written informed consent , the participants included in our study underwent the study examination .
the date of the survey and demographic data were collected .
if the participant was not able to answer the questions , an immediate family / primary caregiver was asked to assist .
specially trained nurses conducted the surveys at the research centre or in the participant 's own home , which was sometimes preferred to minimise the dropout rate .
the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki [ 18 ] , and ethical approval was obtained from the regional research ethics committee at lund university ( lu 605 - 00 , lu 744 - 00 ) .
assessing self - awareness the participants were asked about hf in the following way : " have you been diagnosed with hf ? ?
( in the baseline 2001 - 03 protocol ) and " have you in the last three years received the diagnosis of hf ? ?
( in the following survey 's protocols ). by combining the objective hf diagnosis and the answers on the hf - questionnaire in the survey that immediately followed the hf diagnosis , two groups were identified : one included participants who were aware of their diagnosis , and the other included participants who were unaware of having a diagnosis of hf. age - related factors cognitive ability the mini mental state examination ( mmse ) measures cognition and has a maximum score of 30 .
low scores indicate poor cognitive ability [ 19 ] .
the cut - off scores suggested by folstein , folstein , mchugh , and fanjiang [ 20 ] were used , i.e. , > 27 = normal cognition ; 21 - 26 = mild ; 11 - 20 = moderate ; and 0 - 10 = severe cognitive impairment .
due to a small sample size in the groups suffering from moderate and severe cognitive impairment , these two groups were merged .
daily functioning because the performance of hf - specific self - care often involves complex interaction with the environment , and requires a certain level of cognitive functioning , this self - care is included as part of the instrumental activities of daily living ( iadl ) [ 21 ] .
for this reason iadl was chosen to be used when evaluating the participants' daily functioning .
the capacity of participants to perform the instrumental activities : shopping , cooking , cleaning , and transportation were used to describe and compare the dependency in daily functioning .
this brief instrument is considered to be sufficient to describe older people 's daily functioning [ 22 ] .
the participants' own statement of independence ( defined as 0 ) , or dependence ( defined as 1 ) was obtained , and then summed to a total score and categorised according to the following : 0 = excellent daily functioning ; 1 = mild impairment ; 2 = moderate impairment ; 3 = severe impairment ; and 4 = total impairment in daily functioning .
risk of depression the montgomery and asberg depression rating scale ( madrs ) [ 23 ] is a 10 - item scale rating risk for depression ( score - range 0 - 60 ) .
in the present study , a shorter version with nine items of madrs was used .
the question regarding concentration difficulties has a low inter - item correlation [ 24 ] and was removed .
snaith et al. ' s proposed cut - off criteria for the original version were used , i.e. , no risk of depression = 0 - 6 ; mild risk = 7 - 19 ; moderate risk = 20 - 34 , and >= 35 = high risk [ 25 ] .
heart failure - related factors functional capacity new york heart association ( nyha ) classification system measures functional capacity in relation to hf symptoms [ 26 ] .
the participants' own assessment of symptoms when physically active was obtained and were classified as follows : nyha i = no symptoms during normal physical activity ; nyha ii = symptoms ( shortness of breath ) when climbing a staircase one floor ; nyha iii = symptoms when dressing ; and nyha iv = symptoms even at rest .
time - span between diagnosis - survey the time - span between the diagnosis and the following snac - b - survey was measured in months and summarized on an individual basis .
statistical analysis data used for analyses were taken from the snac - b survey , which immediately followed a hf diagnosis , and missing data led to exclusion of the specific variable .
to avoid low numbers in the cross table , cognition , daily functioning , functional capacity and risk for depression were dichotomised ( normal cognition / impaired cognition ; excellent daily functioning and mild impairment / moderate , severe , and total impairment in daily functioning ; nyha i / nyha ii - iv ; risk for / no risk for depression ) .
categorisation , absolute numbers and proportions were used to describe the study participants and to determine which of the studied variables could be associated with the self - awareness of own hf diagnosis .
total scores are presented as means with standard deviation ( sd ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) for the mean .
differences between the groups aware / unaware were calculated using the chi - square test for nominal data and the mann - whitney u test for interval data .
two logistic regression models ( enter ) were completed .
model one included only the hf - related factors and model two included both age - related and hf - related factors .
results are presented as odds ratios ( or ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) .
the hosmer - lemeshow chi - square test was used to assess the models' goodness - of - fit .
to investigate interactions and collinearity among independent variables , tests for variance inflation factor ( vif ) were conducted and were found to be acceptable .
a p - value of <= 0.05 was considered to be significant .
all statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics for windows ( version 22.0. armonk , ny : ibm corp ) .
results out of 265 snac - b participants with a hf diagnosis in their inpatient record , 62 ( 23.4 %) were too ill for inclusion in the study , or died before self - awareness of their hf diagnosis could be established .
another 113 were excluded due to other reasons , detailed in fig. 1. ultimately , a total of 90 participants were included in our study .
neither gender differences nor differences in age at hf diagnosis were found between the excluded and the included individuals with hf ( p = 0.186 / 0.730 ) .
an average of 18.4 months ( sd 14.6 ) passed between the date of the hf diagnosis and the date of the survey .
the average age of the participants at the time of hf diagnosis was 85.9 years old ( sd 4.9 ) and the majority of the participants were women ( 63.3 %) .
physical and mental impairments were common , and 7 ( 8.5 %) lived in a sheltered accommodation .
impaired cognitive ability was found in 57 ( 63.3 %) participants , and 17 ( 18.9 %) were moderately / severely cognitively impaired .
two of these had so profound cognitive impairments that they received help from their spouses to answer the questions in the survey .
almost 30 % had a risk of depression , highly reduced functional capacity ( nyha iii - iv ) was present in 28 ( 31.3 %) of the participants , and 30 ( 33.7 %) had a severe or total need of assistance in their daily functioning .
self - awareness of own hf diagnosis one fourth ( 23 / 90 ) of the participants were self - aware of their own hf diagnosis , and self - awareness of own hf was equally distributed over the different years of the study ( p = 0.093 ) .
self - awareness of own hf diagnosis was often not present in high functioning participants , i.e. , more than one in three participants were cognitively intact ( i.e. , mmse total score >= 27 out of 30 possible ) , and 42 % were excellent functioning or only slightly impaired in their daily functioning. and , despite the fact that nearly 60 % demonstrated hf symptoms ( i.e. , nyha ii - iv ) , self - awareness of hf diagnosis was infrequent .
participants who were self - aware of their diagnosis were the same age at diagnosis , and they were equally mentally and physically impaired as the participants who were unaware of their diagnosis ( p = 0.297 to 0.857 ) .
additionally , the time - span between the date of the hf diagnosis and the date of the survey were the same between the two groups ( p = 0.133 ) .
thus , no association was found between self - awareness of own hf diagnosis and age - related or hf - related factors ( table 1 ) .

in model 1 only hf - related factors were included , while in model 2 both hf - and age - related factors were included hosmer - lemeshow chi - square test : model 1 = 0.229 ; model 2 = 0.625 discussion the most striking result of our study was that only a small percentage of the oldest old were aware of their diagnosis of hf. our findings are consistent with previous studies [ 6 - 8 ] with different study designs , different age cohorts , and larger study populations .
thus , it appears that most individuals with hf are not aware that they have hf , including the oldest old .
however , almost 20 % of the participants were moderately / severely cognitively impaired .
this fact should have an impact on the result , especially since only two of the participants had the help of their spouses to answer the questionnaires .
however , the logistic regression analysis ( table 2 , model 2 ) demonstrated that the degree of cognitive functioning did not have any impact on whether self - awareness of one 's own hf diagnosis was present or not .
the non - significant results could , however , be a reflection of a small sample size .
nevertheless , the univariate analyses ( table 1 ) revealed an absence of a tendency for significant findings , and the study would have needed to be up to 30 times larger to reach significance in all of the included variables .
furthermore , even if the small differences in cognitive functioning that were made visible between the groups were significant , the clinical relevance of these findings could be questioned .
additionally , gure and colleagues' [ 6 ] included approximately 5600 elderly people in their study , and they also found that the degree of cognitive functioning was not related to self - awareness of one 's own hf diagnosis , as was shown in our study .
thus , the degree of cognitive functioning should have a minor impact on whether the oldest old with hf are self - aware of their own hf diagnosis or not , as was shown by our study .
according to riegel , dickson , and faulkner [ 27 ] , hf - specific self - care can be explained by the theory of naturalistic decision making ( ndm ) .
this theory explains human decision making in real life , and depends on the interaction between the decision - making person , the problem and the environment .
the authors further reveal how several actors ( both the ill person and health professionals ) interact in most ndm situations and that the level of interest and commitment can vary between these two actors [ 27 ] .
the manner in which health professionals provide information about the hf diagnosis ( i.e. , an environmental factor ) can thus affect whether the ill person is aware of the diagnosis or not as well as if hf - specific self - care is conducted or not .
imprecise expressions such as " a bad heart " and " ventricular dysfunction " are often used by health professionals , when informing of hf diagnosis [ 28 , 29 ] , and the prevalence of self - awareness had probably been increased if more imprecise paraphrases of the term " heart failure " had been included in the hf - questionnaire .
however , when health professionals use complex terminology , people with hf lose interest in the information provided [ 29 ] , and the usage of euphemisms when informing patients about hf could be perceived as not recognising the severity of the illness , which may undermine the importance of conducting hf - specific self - care .
thus , the health professionals' usage of the specific term " heart failure " when informing about the diagnosis should be regarded as an important factor for a successful ndm process and the conductance of hf - specific self - care .
this assumption should therefore be further explored .
one of the strengths of the present study is that the study population was drawn from a large , representative , population - based study , with low internal loss of the studied variables .
thus , the results should be considered generalisable to the oldest old with hf. however , despite telephone calls to encourage participation in the study , 73 / 163 were never examined .
though , only 11 of these dropped out as a result of refusal .
the majority ( 85 %) dropped out because they considered themselves to be too ill or were already deceased ( fig. 1 ) .
we chose to study the oldest old with hf , an elderly cohort known with high morbidity and mortality [ 30 ] .
consequently , the study 's generalisability to those oldest old who are very old or very morbid at hf diagnosis may be compromised .
this , however , underscores the difficulty of studying the oldest old with hf. the chosen study design ( to include study participants over a long period of time ) has been used before [ 17 ] , and increased the study population .
additionally , the participants with hf had their diagnosis objectively verified .
this ensures that the participants studied actually had hf. however , the excluded participants who had a non - objectively verified hf diagnosis ( 20 %) may well have had more hf markers ( i.e. , higher nyha classification , higher dependency in daily functioning , etc. ) .
an experienced physician may , therefore , have chosen to diagnose hf without conducting an objective verification , which would have led the participant to be wrongly excluded from our study .
it could , therefore , be argued that the results may not be generalisable to individuals with more hf markers .
however , the results of our study indicate that hf markers had no association with self - awareness of own hf diagnosis , indicating that the results should be generalisable also to the more seriously ill .
there are probably factors that , in conjunction with the manner in which the information of the hf diagnosis is communicated , can be related to the awareness of one 's own hf diagnosis .
the psychological aspect of who / what the individual believes is responsible for their personal health , e.g. , health locus of control ( hloc ) [ 31 ] , may perhaps have a relationship with the self - awareness of the presence of hf. initially , we included hloc , but due to high internal dropouts , hloc was later excluded .
in our study , hloc was completed independently by the participant , which may be difficult for the cognitively impaired .
most of our participants were cognitively impaired , which could explain the high internal dropout rate .
this fact further illustrates the difficulty in studying the oldest old with hf. however , by the use of the study design presented herein , we managed to establish the relationship between self - awareness of one 's own hf diagnosis and those interpersonal factors that are typically studied in hf trials .
conclusions there is a low prevalence of self - awareness of hf in the oldest old .
factors that could be linked to elderly with hf were found to have no association with this awareness .
thus , external circumstances such as the manner in which the elderly patients are informed about hf , in conjunction with interpersonal factors not covered by the present study , may have a higher impact on the self - awareness of own hf diagnosis than the age - and hf - related factors investigated in this study .
this relationship should therefore be further investigated .

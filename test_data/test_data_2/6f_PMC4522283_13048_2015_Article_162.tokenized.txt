micrornas ( mirnas ) are endogenous , small , noncoding single - stranded rna molecules approximately 22 nucleotides in length .
mirnas are involved in the post - transcriptional regulation of various important cellular physiological and pathological processes , including cell proliferation , differentiation , apoptosis , and hormone biosynthesis and secretion .
ovarian follicles are the key functional units of female reproduction , and the development of these follicles is a complex and precise process accompanied by oocyte maturation as well as surrounding granulosa cell proliferation and differentiation .
numerous mirnas expressed in the ovary regulate ovarian follicle growth , atresia , ovulation and steroidogenesis and play an important role in ovarian disorders .
this review considers recent advances in the identification of mirnas involved in the regulation of ovarian function as well as the possible influence of mirnas on ovarian - derived disorders , such as ovarian cancer , polycystic ovarian syndrome and premature ovarian failure .

keywords microrna ovary follicle ovarian disorder issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 discovered in 1993 by ambros and colleagues , micrornas ( mirnas ) are endogenous , small , noncoding single - stranded rna molecules 22 - 24 nucleotides ( nt ) in length [ 1 ] .
primary mirna transcripts ( pri - mirnas ) are several kilobases long and undergo substantial processing in the nucleus , resulting in the generation of a 70 - to 90 - nt stem - loop precursor mirna ( pre - mirna ) .
pre - mirnas undergo substantial processing by dicer , a double - stranded mirna duplex , to form mature mirnas .
mature mirnas play pivotal roles in regulating translation by binding to the 3 ' - untranslated regions ( 3 ' - utrs ) of their target mrnas [ 1 - 4 ] .
exosome - mediated mirna transfer is a major mechanism of genetic exchange between cells [ 5 ] .
kosaka et al. reported that circulatory mirnas are released with exosomes , including mirnas , mrnas and proteins , and are subsequently transferred to recipients to resume their functions [ 6 ] .
mirnas are involved in the regulation of various important cellular physiological and pathological processes , including cell proliferation , differentiation , apoptosis , and hormone biosynthesis and secretion [ 5 , 7 ] .
the human ovary contains approximately 10,000 primordial follicles at birth that are prepared for the long duration of the fertile period .
folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis are complex processes involving intraovarian gene expression , signaling pathways , and endocrine and paracrine factors [ 8 , 9 ] .
the phosphorylation and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten / phosphatidylinositol - 3 kinase / protein kinase b ( pten / pi3k / akt ) signaling pathway contributes to oocyte proliferation , survival , migration and metabolism [ 10 ] .
wingless - type mmtv integration site family member 4 ( wnt4 ) is required for antral follicle development by regulating granulosa cell functions [ 11 ] , the transforming growth factor beta ( tgf - beta ) superfamily members ( including gdf9 , growth differentiation factor 9 and bmp15 , bone morphogenetic protein 15 ) are major regulators of follicle development [ 12 ] , and mirnas are involved in granulosa cell proliferation and apoptosis [ 13 ] .
here , we review recent findings regarding mirna expression profiles in the ovary and the potential roles of mirna in ovarian function and ovarian disorders .
we believe that a better understanding of ovarian mirna function will lead to a new era of female reproductive health .
mirna profiles in the ovary mirnas are expressed in the ovary and are involved in the regulation of mammalian reproduction .
mirna expression profiles have been identified in numerous species ( additional file 1 : table s1 ) , including human , mouse , bovine , sheep , chicken , fish , swine and equine species [ 14 - 21 ] .
timoneda et al. performed a systematic study of porcine mirna expression and found that let - 7a , mir - 25 and mir - 106a are preferentially expressed in the ovary [ 22 ] .
li et al .
[ 21 ] evaluated the mirna transcriptome in the adult porcine ovary and testis via deep sequencing technology .
they reported that mir - 21 - 5p , mir - 143 - 3p and members of the let - 7 family were the top unique mirnas for both the ovary and testis and that these mirnas play cellular housekeeping roles during ovarian and testicular development .
mir - 378 , mir - 1 , mir - 206 , mir - 379 , mir - 127 , and mir - 411 are downregulated in the ovary compared with the testis ; by contrast , mir - 10b , mir - 26a , mir - 21 , mir - 140 , and mir - 101 are upregulated in the ovary but not in the testis .
furthermore , most of the differentially expressed mirnas located on the x chromosome ( x - linked mirnas ) are significantly upregulated in the ovary compared with the testis and are co - expressed with x - linked mirnas .
regardless of species , the let - 7 family , mir - 21 , mir - 99a , mir - 125b , mir - 126 , mir - 143 , mir - 145 , and mir - 199b are the most predominant mirna populations in the ovary [ 23 ] .
mirna expression is organ specific and closely related to organ function , particularly in the ovary .
the ovary contains oocytes and multiple somatic cell types such as granulosa cells , theca cells and cumulus cells .
the expression and function of mirnas are associated with different cell types ( additional file 2 : table s2 ) .
in total , 58 mirnas are predominantly expressed in the bovine fetal ovary compared with somatic tissue .
among them , eight mirnas ( bta - mir - 99a , bta - mir - 10b , bta - mir - 199a - 3p , bta - mir - 199a - 5p , bta - mir - 424 , bta - mir - 100 , bta - mir - 455 , and bta - mir - 214 ) are expressed at a 10 - fold greater level in the fetal bovine ovary compared with somatic tissue pools .
further analyses indicate that bta - mir - 424 and bta - mir - 10b are highly abundant in germinal vesicle ( gv ) oocytes [ 20 ] .
such expression patterns indicate that these mirnas are maternally inherited and may potentially be involved in the maternal transcript turnover during zygotic gene activation .
various mirnas are involved in oocyte maturation , such as mir - 2 , mir - 7 , mir - 184 , mir - 100 , mir - 9b , let - 7 , mir - 79 , mir - 133 , mir - 275 and mir - 252 [ 24 - 26 ] .
in different stages of the oocytes , mirna expression has been shown to differ .
mir - 2 and mir - 133 are considerably more abundant in the first metaphase ( mi ) compared with the gv stage , and they both inhibit cyclin b translation by downregulating the 3 ' - utrs of the crab cyclin b gene [ 25 ] .
some mirnas , such as the let - 7 family , play a housekeeping role in the ovary , independent of species [ 21 , 27 ] .
mirna in granulosa cells is expressed differentially in the follicular and luteal stages .
mir - 503 has been found to be downregulated during the fsh - responsive follicular development stage and luteinization and upregulated during the later stage before ovulation [ 28 ] .
in characterizing the mirna profile in human cumulus granulosa cells ( cgcs ) , xu et al. demonstrated that the let - 7 family was the most abundant mirna in these cells in both polycystic ovarian syndrome ( pcos ) patients and normal cycling women [ 27 ] .
compared with normal cycling women , mir - 10a - 5p , mir - 1307 - 3p , mir - 423 - 5p , mir - 1273 g - 3p , mir - 199a - 3p , mir - 185 - 5p , and mir - 483 - 5p are upregulated in the cgcs of pcos patients , and mir - 483 - 5p suppresses notch3 and mitogen - activated protein kinase 3 ( mapk3 ) expression in human cgcs by directly binding the 3 ' - utrs of notch3 and mapk3 mrna [ 27 ] .
bioinformatics and gene ontology analysis revealed that the target genes of these predominantly expressed mirnas in the ovary are involved in cell cycle regulation ; cellular growth , proliferation and apoptosis ; endocrine system disorders ; and ovarian functions [ 29 ] .
in addition , a recent study demonstrated that mir - 143 inhibited primordial follicle formation by reducing the expression of cyclin - dependent kinases ( cdks ) 4 and 6 and cyclins b1 , d2 , and e2 in pregranulosa cells [ 30 ] .
furthermore , mir - 181a inhibits mouse ovarian granulosa cell proliferation by targeting activin receptor iia [ 31 ] , and mir - 26b promotes ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis by targeting the ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( atm ) gene during follicular atresia [ 32 ] .
finally , mir - 132 and mir - 212 expression are associated with hormonal regulation in ovulation and luteinization [ 33 ] .
mirnas and ovarian function mirnas and ovarian follicle development mirnas are involved in the entire process of ovarian follicle development , including follicle growth , atresia and ovulation .
in each stage of follicle development , different growth factors contribute to stage - specific functions in different cell types [ 8 , 9 ] .
mirnas also play an important role in the regulation of follicular development .
mcbride et al .
[ 19 ] identified mirna expression profiles at different stages of follicle development , including small follicles ( 1.5 - 3.5 mm ) , medium follicles ( 4.0 - 5.5 mm ) , pre - ovulatory follicles , early corpora lutea , late corpora lutea , and corpus albicans .
mir - 21 , mir - 125b , let - 7a and let - 7b are the most abundantly expressed mirnas across the different development stages .
mir - 199a - 3p , mir - 145 and mir - 31 are over - expressed at the follicular stage and exhibit a marked decrease in the follicular - luteal transition. by contrast , mir - 503 , mir - 21 and mir - 142 - 3p are generally expressed at lower levels during the follicular stages and exhibit significant increases in luteal tissues [ 19 ] .
zhang et al .
[ 31 ] reported that mir - 181a was reduced in preantral and antral follicles of mice compared with primary follicles .
mir - 181a suppressed activin receptor iia ( acvr2a ) expression and decreased the phosphorylation of the activin intracellular signal transducer mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 ( smad2 ) in mice granulosa cells , leading to regulation of granulosa cell proliferation and ovarian follicle development [ 31 ] .
folliculogenesis begins with the breakdown of germ cell clusters and the formation of primordial follicles .
zhang et al. revealed that mir - 143 was expressed in pregranulosa cells using in situ hybridization .
mir - 143 inhibits the formation of primordial follicles by suppressing pregranulosa cell proliferation and downregulating the expression of genes related to the cell cycle , including cyclin d2 , cdk4 and cdk6 [ 30 ] .
during folliculogenesis , more than 99 % of ovarian follicles undergo atresia , and the roles of mirnas in regulating follicle development and atresia were recently elucidated .
differentially expressed mirnas were constructed for healthy , early atretic , and progressively atretic follicles [ 32 ] .
hsa - mir - 936 , p - mir - 1281 , hsa - mir - 26b , mmu - mir - 1224 , hsa - mir - 10b , p - mir - 466 g - b , p - mir - 1275 , hsa - mir - 574 - 5p , r - mir - 26b , hsa - mir - 149 * , hsa - mir - 1275 , and hsa - mir - 99a are upregulated during follicle atresia , whereas r - let - 7a , hsa - let - 7i , hsa - mir - 92b , hsa - mir - 92a , p - mir - 923 , hsa - mir - 1979 , r - mir - 739 , hsa - mir - 1308 , hsa - mir - 1826 , p - mir - 1826 , and ssc - mir - 184 are downregulated during this process .
mir - 26b , which is upregulated during follicular atresia , increases dna breaks and promotes granulosa cell apoptosis by directly targeting atm .
follicle atresia is triggered by granulosa cells apoptosis [ 34 , 35 ] .
mirnas are involved in granulosa cell apoptosis .
mir - 34s induces cell apoptosis and growth arrest through the activation of p53 and the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor p21 [ 36 , 37 ] .
tu et al. reported that mir - 34a promoted granulosa cell apoptosis in pig ovarian follicles by targeting the inhibin beta b ( inhbb ) gene [ 38 ] .
carletti et al. reported that mir - 21 was highly induced by luteinizing hormone ( lh ) in murine granulosa cells and that the suppression of mir - 21 activity in vitro caused granulosa cell apoptosis [ 39 ] .
advanced reports indicate that mirna is associated with oocyte maturation .
the oocyte initiates meiosis at the beginning of dna synthesis and remains in mi phase until the resumption of meiosis .
before ovulation , oocytes become secondary oocytes after completing the first meiosis and stop at metaphase ii ( mii ) of meiosis until fertilization [ 26 , 40 ] .
xiao et al .
[ 26 ] reported that transgelin 2 ( tagln2 ) , which encodes an actin protein , participates in ovarian development and maturation .
in addition , mir - 133b regulates oocyte maturation through its potential target tagln2 at both the transcription and translation levels .
dicer is a ribonuclease that is required for the synthesis and processing of mature functional mirnas .
dicer is expressed in both oocytes and granulosa cells of the mouse ovarian follicle [ 19 ] .
the role of dicer in pre - ovulatory follicle development and ovulation has also been elucidated .
lei et al .
[ 28 ] reported that conditional inactivation of dicer1 in follicular granulosa cells led to increased primordial follicle pool endowment , accelerated early follicle recruitment and an increase in degenerate follicles in dicer conditional knockout ( cko ) ovaries .
dicer1 regulates follicle development by downregulating mir - 503 , an ovary - specific mirna , as well as mir - 503 target genes , such as anti - mullerian hormone ( amh ) ; inhibin beta a subunit ( inhba ) ; cytochrome p450 , family 17 , subfamily a , polypeptide 1 ( cyp17a1 ) ; cytochrome p450 , family 19 , subfamily a , polypeptide 1 ( cyp19a1 ) ; zona pellucida glycoproteins ( zps ) ; growth differentiation factor 9 ( gdf9 ) and bone morphogenetic protein 15 ( bmp15 ) .
dicer1 inactivation in female mice causes abnormal follicular morphology and infertility [ 28 , 40 , 41 ] .
these studies demonstrate that dicer plays important roles in follicle growth and oocyte maturation .
multiple factors are involved in follicle development , such as the tgf - beta superfamily members [ 42 , 43 ] , ligand stimulation of type i ( also referred to as activin receptor - like kinases ( alks )) and smads [ 44 - 46 ] .
mirna regulates follicle development by affecting these factors .
a recent study revealed that mir - 224 expression is regulated by the tgf - beta / smad pathway .
mir - 224 overexpression enhances tgf - beta1 - induced granulosa cell proliferation by targeting smad4 , which is a key regulator involved in ovarian follicle growth and female fertility , whereas inhibition of endogenous mir - 224 partially suppresses tgf - beta1 - induced granulosa cell proliferation , indicating an important biological role of mir - 224 in regulating gene expression during folliculogenesis [ 47 ] .
mirnas also influence ovulation indirectly .
hasuwa et al. examined the role of mir - 200b and mir - 429 in anovulation and infertility in female mice [ 48 ] .
mir - 200b and mir - 429 suppressed the expression of zinc - finger e - box binding homeobox 1 ( zeb1 ) in the pituitary gland where these mirnas are highly expressed ; moreover , mir - 200b and mir - 429 inactivation restrained lh biosynthesis , suggesting that mir - 200b and mir - 429 support ovulation by indirectly functioning in the hypothalamus - pituitary - ovarian axis .
mirnas and ovarian steroidogenesis folliculogenesis is a highly dynamic process that is closely associated with alterations in circulating hormone levels .
given the indispensable role of mirnas in ovarian follicle development and female fertility , the relationships between ovarian hormones and mirnas have recently been investigated .
a study on granulosa / cumulus cells reported the expression of several mirnas ( mir - 23a , mir - 23b , mir - 542 - 3p , mir - 211 , and mir - 17 - 5p ) in ovarian somatic cells , and the authors speculated that mirna target genes , including cyclooxygenase - 2 , steroidogenic acute regulatory protein ( star ) , and cyp - 19a1 ( aromatase ) , regulate granulosa / theca cells proliferation , differentiation and steroid biosynthesis [ 43 ] .
mirnas regulate ovarian steroid hormones by targeting hormone receptors as well as affecting hormone biosynthesis and release .
for example , estradiol ( e2 ) plays an important role in ovarian follicle development , and the production of e2 is tightly controlled by aromatase .
xu et al. reported that aromatase expression and estradiol synthesis in granulosa cells are post - transcriptionally downregulated by mir - 378 and that mir - 378 affects estradiol synthesis by binding the 3 ' - utr of the aromatase coding sequence [ 49 ] .
conversely , mir - 133b stimulates ovarian estradiol synthesis by targeting foxl2 , which mediates the transcriptional repression of star and cyp19a1 to promote estradiol biosynthesis [ 50 ] .
mirnas not only regulate estradiol synthesis but also estradiol release .
estradiol release is promoted by mir - 383 in ovarian granulosa cells , and mir - 383 inhibits rna binding motif single - stranded interacting protein 1 ( rbms1 ) by altering its mrna stability , leading to the inactivation of c - myc and steroidogenesis in granulosa cells [ 51 ] .
finally , mir - 423 - 5p and mir - 378 regulate estradiol synthesis by targeting cyp19a1 mrna and repressing cyp19a1 protein content and enzyme activity in newborn piglets [ 52 ] .
conversely , the mirna expression profile is profoundly influenced by circulating hormones .
mir - 132 and mir - 212 expression are increased following human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) induction [ 33 ] , and the expression of 31 micrornas is altered after follicle - stimulating hormone ( fsh ) treatment .
specifically , mir - 29a and mir - 30d expression is downregulated in the short term but upregulated in the long term following fsh induction [ 53 ] .
sirotkin et al. [ 54 ] first demonstrated that mirnas control reproductive functions , resulting in enhanced or inhibited release of ovarian progestagen and androgen .
thirty - six mirnas , including let - 7b , let - 7c , mir - 15a , mir - 17 - 3p , mir - 96 , mir - 92 , mir - 108 , mir - 133b , mir - 134 , mir - 135 , and mir - 146 , inhibited progesterone release , whereas 16 mirnas ( mir - 16 , mir - 24 , mir - 25 , mir - 122 , mir - 145 , mir - 182 , mir - 18 , mir - 125a , mir - 147 , mir - 32 , mir - 103 , mir - 143 , mir - 150 , mir - 152 , mir - 153 and mir - 191 ) promoted progesterone release in granulosa cells .
in addition , let - 7a , let - 7b , let - 7c , mir - 16 , mir - 17 - 3p , mir - 24 , mir - 25 , mir - 26a , mir - 108 , and mir - 122 inhibited testosterone release .
moreover , pathological factors significantly influence mirna expression in the mammalian ovary .
bisphenol - a ( bpa ) is an environmentally ubiquitous endocrine system - disrupting chemical .
veiga - lopez et al. studied the effect of bpa on mrna and mirna expression and reported that bpa increased cyp19 and 5alpha - reductase mrna expression , disrupted the sheep ovarian transcriptome and altered the fetal ovarian mirna expression profile [ 55 ] .
in addition , ovarian mirna expression , including mir - 497 and mir - 15b , is influenced by prenatal testosterone treatment [ 56 ] .
mirnas and ovarian disorders recent studies have reported that differential expression and dysregulation of mirnas are associated with ovarian diseases , such as ovarian cancer , pcos and premature ovarian failure ( pof ) [ 13 , 57 ] .
mirnas and ovarian cancer ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy .
recently , multiple studies have profiled mirnas in ovarian cancer compared with normal tissues to identify differentially expressed mirnas [ 58 - 61 ] .
iorio et al .
[ 58 ] were the first to compare genome - wide mirna expression profiles from both ovarian cancer tissues and normal ovary tissues and reported that mirna expression was differentially regulated in the two groups ; mir - 200a , mir - 141 , mir - 200c , and mir - 200b were overexpressed in ovarian cancer , and mir - 199a , mir - 140 , mir - 145 , and mir - 125b1 were the most downregulated mirnas .
these four downregulated mirnas had a common target oncosuppressor , namely , brca1 - associated protein ( bap1 ) .
shapira and his colleagues [ 60 ] collected presurgical plasma samples from women with confirmed serous epithelial ovarian cancer , benign neoplasms and no known pelvic mass to assess mirna profiles .
twenty - two mirnas were differentially expressed between healthy controls and the ovarian cancer group , whereas a six - mirna - profile subset ( mir - 106b , mir - 126 , mir - 150 , mir - 17 , mir - 20a , and mir - 92a ) could distinguish between benign and ovarian cancer patients .
mirnas play significant roles in the early diagnosis , prognosis and chemotherapy sensitivity of ovarian cancer .
a recent study related to stage i ovarian tumors revealed that mir - 30a and mir - 30a * are markers of clear - cell tumors , whereas mir - 192 and mir - 194 are markers of mucinous tumors [ 62 ] .
langhe et al .
[ 63 ] reported that 4 mirnas ( let - 7i - 5p , mir - 122 , mir - 152 - 5p and mir - 25 - 3p ) are significantly downregulated in ovarian cancer patients .
the target genes of these differentially expressed mirnas are involved in wnt signaling , akt / mtor and tlr - 4 / myd88 , which play roles in ovarian carcinogenesis and chemoresistance .
these results indicate the roles of let - 7i - 5p , mir - 122 , mir - 152 - 5p and mir - 25 - 3p as diagnostic biomarkers in ovarian cancer .
in a prognostic study , merritt investigated dicer messenger rna ( mrna ) and drosha levels in invasive epithelial ovarian cancer patients and compared the results with clinical outcomes .
low dicer expression was significantly associated with advanced tumor stage , and low drosha expression was associated with suboptimal surgical cytoreduction [ 64 ] .
another study by marchini [ 65 ] et al. confirmed that mir - 200c downregulation is associated with overall and progression - free survival ( pfs ) independent of clinical covariates in stage i epithelial ovarian cancer .
further research by park [ 66 ] identified the pivotal role of the mir - 200 family in the epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) , which is a decisive step toward tumor cell invasion and metastasis and is positively correlated with poor patient prognosis .
mir - 200 suppressed the emt by directly downregulating the expression of the e - cadherin transcriptional repressors zeb1 and zeb2 ( smad - interacting protein 1 , sip1 ) , thus reducing e - cadherin expression and promoting the emt [ 66 ] .
in studies of the serous subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer , mir - 506 was found to be a robust emt inhibitor through direct targeting of the e - cad repressor snai2 [ 67 ] , the vimentin gene ( vim ) and n - cad gene ( cdh2 ) [ 68 ] , suggesting that mir - 506 inhibits multiple targets in the emt network and is associated with good prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer .
regarding the therapeutic role of mirnas in ovarian cancer , gu et al .
[ 69 ] reported that three mirnas ( hsa - mir - 146a , hsa - mir - 148a and hsa - mir - 545 ) are predominantly expressed in patients with wild - type brca1 / 2 ovarian cancers who may benefit from platinum - based chemotherapy .
these mirnas target brca1 / 2 , which is the key gene involved in the dna damage response and dna repair processes , leading to the increasing sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy [ 69 ] .
mirnas and pcos pcos is a multifactorial endocrine disorder affecting approximately 5 - 10 % of all women of reproductive age [ 70 - 72 ] .
hossain et al .
[ 73 ] established a rat pcos model via dihydrotestosterone ( dht ) induction to investigate pcos - associated ovarian mirna expression profiles and found that the differential expression of regulatory mirnas is associated with pcos pathogenesis in rat ovaries .
this study showed that 25 mirnas , which were designated as ovarian mirnas , were highly and differently expressed in the ovary in pcos and normal rats .
most of the mirnas in the ovary that promote the cystic conditions are localized in the follicular theca cells of dht - treated ovaries .
further research explored the dysregulated molecular pathways related to altered mirnas in pcos rat ovaries .
mir - 222 was confirmed to be expressed in theca cells by in situ localization , and the expression was reported to be repressed by androgens , which regulate cell proliferation by targeting p27 / kip1 .
in addition , mir - 222 overexpression was associated with reduced eralpha protein and signaling as well as expression of the eralpha target genes .
the findings may offer new insights for pcos pathogenesis research [ 73 ] .
sang et al .
[ 74 ] assessed mirna expression in human follicular fluid of pcos patients and identified numerous mirnas that play important roles in steroidogenesis .
mir - 132 and mir - 320 are expressed at a significantly reduced level in the follicular fluid of polycystic ovary patients compared with healthy controls .
in addition , mir - 132 , mir - 320 , mir - 520c - 3p , mir - 24 and mir - 222 regulate estradiol concentrations , and mir - 24 , mir - 193b , and mir - 483 - 5p regulate progesterone concentrations in pcos patients .
pcos is characterized by polycystic ovaries , hyperandrogenism , insulin resistance ( ir ) and chronic anovulation [ 75 ] .
mirnas are also involved in metabolic processes .
for example , mir - 93 is overexpressed in pcos and is associated with decreased glut4 and increased ir [ 76 ] .
additionally , mirna - 21 , mirna - 27b , mirna - 103 and mirna - 155 play important roles in metabolic processes and are influenced by obesity and circulating androgen concentrations in pcos patients [ 77 ] .
mirnas and premature ovarian failure ( pof ) pof is an ovarian disorder of multifactorial origin that is defined as the occurrence of amenorrhea , hypergonadotropism and hypoestrogenism in women aged younger than 40 years [ 78 ] .
recent studies based on samples from both plasma and ovarian tissues have identified mirnas involved in pof development .
dang et al. reported reduced mir - 22 - 3p plasma levels in pof of han chinese patients compared with control women .
in addition , decreased mir - 22 - 3p expression was correlated with the diminished ovarian reserve [ 79 ] .
our previous studies identified the differentially expressed mirnas in plasma between pof and normal cycling women and the roles of mirnas in regulating many signaling pathways [ 13 ] .
mir - 23a is upregulated in the plasma of pof patients , and mir - 23a overexpression decreases xiap and caspase - 3 levels and increases apoptosis in human granulosa cells .
these results indicate that mir - 23a potentially induces granulosa cell apoptosis by inhibiting xiap expression both at the mrna and protein levels in vitro [ 13 ] .
in addition , kuang et al .
[ 80 ] identified a total of 63 upregulated and 20 downregulated mirnas in ovarian tissue samples from 4 - vinylcyclohexene diepoxide ( vcd ) - induced rat pof models compared with samples from normal rats .
further studies confirmed that mir - 29a and mir - 144 are downregulated in pof tissues and potentially regulate prostaglandin biosynthesis by targeting pla2g4a , whereas various upregulated mirnas , including mir - 27b , mir - 190 , mir - 151 and mir - 672 , are involved in the apoptotic process and hormone stimulation [ 80 ] .
recent studies indicate that mirna single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) are associated with disease susceptibility .
a study related to mirna polymorphism analysis identified the association between combined genotypes and haplotypes of mir - 146ac > g , mir - 196a2t > c , and mir - 499a > g and pof in korean women ; the results indicate that the transcriptional aberration of mir - 146a and mir - 196a2 induced by mirna snps is potentially involved in pof development [ 81 ] .
conclusions and future directions mirnas are post - transcriptional regulators in both physiological and pathological processes .
a single mirna may target several mrnas , and a single mrna may be regulated by multiple mirnas .
many mirnas are expressed in the ovary and are involved in ovarian follicle development , atresia , ovulation and ovarian steroidogenesis by targeting specific genes and regulating various signaling pathways .
mirnas also play important roles in ovarian diseases .
however , studies on mirnas in the ovary have mainly focused on expression profiles rather than their regulation and function networks .
identifying mirnas that are specific to different reproductive organs will help guide researchers to better understand the underlying mechanisms of reproductive disorders .
in addition , identifying upstream or additional regulators of mirnas , their target genes and their roles in the related signaling pathways will further shed light on the importance of specific mirnas for both the development and function of the ovary , paving the way for new therapeutic strategies by controlling the key factors in the regulatory networks .
furthermore , recent studies have demonstrated that snps located in mirna genes or mirna binding sites potentially modify mirna regulation , thus affecting phenotypes and disease susceptibility .
therefore , a combination of mirna expression profiles with genome - wide snp genotyping might help distinguish among potential disease - related biomarkers .
a better understanding of the regulation of ovarian function by mirnas may offer a theoretical foundation for ovarian diseases .

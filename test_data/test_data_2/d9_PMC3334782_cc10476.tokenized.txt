introduction combined with massive lung aeration loss resulting from acute respiratory distress syndrome , hepatopulmonary syndrome , a liver - induced vascular lung disorder characterized by diffuse or localized dilated pulmonary capillaries , may induce hypoxaemia and death in patients with end - stage liver disease .
methods the case of such a patient presenting with both disorders and in whom an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used is described .
results a 51 - year - old man with a five - year history of alcoholic cirrhosis was admitted for acute respiratory failure , platypnoea and severe hypoxaemia requiring emergency tracheal intubation .
following mechanical ventilation , hypoxaemia remained refractory to positive end - expiratory pressure , 100 % of inspired oxygen and inhaled nitric oxide .
two - dimensional contrast - enhanced ( agitated saline ) transthoracic echocardiography disclosed a massive right - to - left extracardiac shunt , without patent foramen ovale .
contrast computed tomography ( ct ) of the thorax using quantitative analysis and colour encoding system established the diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome aggravated by hepatopulmonary syndrome .
according to the severity of the respiratory condition , a veno - venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was implemented and the patient was listed for emergency liver transplantation .
orthotopic liver transplantation was performed at day 13 .
at the end of the surgical procedure , the improvement in oxygenation allowed removal of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( day 5 ) .
the patient was discharged from hospital at day 48 .
three months after hospital discharge , the patient recovered a correct physical autonomy status without supplemental o2 .
conclusions in a cirrhotic patient , acute respiratory distress syndrome was aggravated by hepatopulmonary syndrome causing life - threatening hypoxaemia not controlled by standard supportive measures .
the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation , by controlling gas exchange , allowed the performing of a successful liver transplantation and final recovery .
acute respiratory distress syndrome hepatopulmonary syndrome hypoxaemia extracorporeal membrane oxygenation orthotopic liver transplantation introduction extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) has the capacity to support gas exchange as well as haemodynamics and is , therefore , a rescue therapeutic option for life - threatening respiratory and / or cardiac failure .
ecmo has been tested in acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) [ 1,2 ] and before and after lung transplantation [ 3 ] .
another potential use of ecmo could be the management of life - threatening hypoxaemia in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome ( hps ) , selected for orthotopic liver transplantation ( olt ) .
hps , a liver - induced vascular lung disorder , is characterized by diffuse or localized dilated pulmonary capillaries and , less commonly , pleural and pulmonary arteriovenous communications coexisting with normal alveolar ventilation [ 4 ] .
hypoxaemia is usually responsive to oxygen therapy [ 4 ] , but olt appears as the only successful treatment [ 5,6 ] .
however , in the most severe forms of hps ( pao2 < 50 mmhg on room air ) , olt is associated with increased respiratory morbidity / mortality due to frequent post - operative worsening of hypoxaemia [ 5,7 ] .
one case of successful use of ecmo in the management of life - threatening hypoxaemia following olt for hps has been reported [ 8 ] but there are no data concerning its use in the pre - operative management .
materials and methods we here report the use of ecmo as a bridge to olt in a patient with refractory hypoxaemia resulting from combined ards and hps .
results diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome a 51 - year - old man was admitted to our institution for haematemesis in a context of acute alcoholic intoxication .
he had a five - year history of alcoholic cirrhosis with several episodes of bleeding from oesophageal varices and one episode of acute alcoholic hepatitis treated by corticosteroids .
no hypoxaemia was detected during his medical follow - up and successive hospitalizations .
on admission ( day 1 ) , he was in respiratory failure with platypnoea .
his arterial oxygen saturation ( sao2 ) before intubation was 87 % at rest in a supine position while breathing 15 l / minute oxygen ( o2 ) via a high concentration o2 face mask .
immediate tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation ( mv ) support were required .
on mv , ph , paco2 and pao2 , were 7.29 , 77 mmhg , and 58 mmhg , respectively , using 100 % o2 , a tidal volume ( tv ) of 6 ml / kg of ideal body weight and a positive end - expiratory pressure ( peep ) of 10 cmh2o .
inhaled nitric oxide at 40 parts per million did not result in any improvement in gas exchange .
chest radiograph demonstrated moderate bilateral pleural effusion without clear evidence of alveolar consolidation and the diagnosis of hps was suspected .
two - dimensional contrast - enhanced ( agitated saline ) transthoracic echocardiography disclosed a hyperkinetic systolic profile with low left ventricular filling pressures .
the main abnormality was a massive right - to - left extra - cardiac shunt , without patent foramen ovale , confirming the diagnosis of hps .
diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome contrasting with bedside anterior chest radiography , contrast computed tomography ( ct ) of the thorax demonstrated bilateral consolidations of lower lobes with dilated pulmonary vessels , moderate right pleural effusion and no evidence of pulmonary embolism ( figure 1a ) .
the diagnosis of focal ards was made according to previously described criteria [ 9 ] .
secondary analysis of ct sections with the colour encoding system of the software lungview ( r ) ( institut national des telecommunications , evry , france ) [ 10,11 ] , confirmed the presence of enlarged pulmonary vessels within consolidations , suspected on mediastinal windows ( figure 1a ) .
quantitative analysis of the whole lung according to a technique previously described [ 12 ] , demonstrated an increase in lung tissue ( 938 ml ) predominating in the upper lobes ( 578 ml ) , a massive loss of lung aeration predominating in the lower lobes ( 99 ml of gas ) and the presence of hyperinflation of the upper lobes ( 463 ml ) , a pattern strongly evocative of focal acute respiratory distress syndrome [ 13 ] .
beside lung failure , the first 24 hours after admission were marked by the development of circulatory shock requiring norepinephrine , acute renal failure and acute liver failure with cell necrosis : aspartate amino transferase ( asat ) = 1340 iu / l , alanine aminotransferase ( alat ) = 600 iu / l , alkaline phosphatase ( ap ) = 104 iu / l , gamma - glutamyl transpeptidase ( gamma - gt ) = 80 ui / l , total bilirubin = 60 mumol / l , prothrombine time ( ptt ) = 40 % , platelet count = 147 g / l. despite the negativity of all bacteriological samplings , an empiric broad - spectrum antibiotic therapy was urgently started given the high suspicion of pneumonia .
figure 1 chest ct performed on day 3 and day 37 after the onset of refractory hypoxaemia .
a ) chest computed tomography ( ct ) on day 3 following the onset of refractory hypoxaemia showing a bilateral consolidation of lower lobes with a right pleural effusion extending to the main fissura ( upper ct section , parenchymal window ) .
large vessels are opacified within each lower lobe consolidation ( middle ct section , mediastinal window ) .
the application of a colour encoding system ( lower part of the figure ) confirms the consolidation of lower lobes [ red colour , characterizing nonaerated lung regions with ct attenuations > - 100 hounsfield densities ( hu )] , shows the hypervascularization of lung consolidations ( black colour , characterizing pulmonary vessels containing contrast material with ct attenuations > + 200 hu ) and evidences the hyperinflation of upper lobes ( white colour , characterizing hyperinflated lung regions with ct attenuations < - 900 hu ) .
normally ( dark grey colour , characterizing lung regions with ct attenuations ranging between - 900 and - 500 hu ) and poorly aerated lung regions ( light grey colour , characterizing lung regions with ct attenuations ranging between - 500 and - 100 hu ) are located to upper lobes .
b ) the same ct sections obtained at day 20 following liver transplantation ( 37 days after the onset of refractory hypoxaemia ) showing a persisting consolidation of the right lower lobe without pleural effusion .
large vessels are not anymore opacified within the consolidation ( middle ct section , mediastinal window ) .
the application of the colour encoding system ( lower part of the figure ) confirms the consolidation , the presence of hyperinflated lung regions in upper lobes .
it does not show anymore hypervascularization within the right consolidation , suggesting a regression of hps .
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation over the next seven days , function of the involved organs stabilized with the exception of the lung , gas exchange remaining precarious ( ph : 7.47 , paco2 : 40 mmhg , and pao2 : 51 mmhg under 100 % fio2 ) .
according to the severity of the respiratory condition , the french network for organ sharing national review board was petitioned and the patient was listed for transplantation with an urgent united network for organ sharing ( unos ) 1a status .
facing the life - threatening hypoxaemia with failure of conventional ventilatory support to control gas exchange , even though he was given a high priority status , the patient was considered to be a candidate for ecmo as a bridge to transplantation .
at day 8 , a veno - venous ( v - v ) ecmo was percutaneously placed with a 24 - french venous drainage cannula in the right jugular vein , and a 19 - french venous return cannula in the right femoral vein .
according to previous recommendations demonstrating the superiority of polymethylpentene oxygenators over polypropylene oxygenators [ 14,15 ] , the ecmo device consisted of the medtronic carmeda heparin - bound system , a quadrox pls 2050 ( r ) oxygenator ( maquet gmbh , rastatt , germany ) , and a rotaflow rf32 ( r ) centrifugal pump ( maquet gmbh , rastatt , germany ) , a flow probe and 3 / 8 - in. internal diameter heparin - bound tubing .
because of the heparin - bound tubing sets , systemic administration of heparin was limited to an intravenous bolus of 75 iu / kg before cannulation .
human albumin ( 5 % , 500 ml ) with physiological saline ( 500 ml ) supplemented with 1,000 iu of heparin was used as a priming solution .
correct position of both cannulae was verified by transoesophageal echocardiography .
under the ecmo support , controlled mv using a constant inspiratory flow was used with a tv of 4 ml / kg , a respiratory frequency of 22 / minute , a peep of 10 cmh2o and fio2 60 % .
the objective was to maintain ecmo flow above 3 to 4 l / minute without ever reducing it below 1 l / minute to avoid the risk of cannula clotting .
liver transplantation the patient remained stable under ecmo support until he underwent , after six days on a waiting list , uncomplicated olt from a deceased donor on day 13 , ( ecmo day 5 ) .
during that period , the platelet count remained between 100 and 130 g / l. the procedure was performed under v - v ecmo .
it required seven units of packed red blood cells , four units of fresh frozen plasma , eight units of human albumin ( 4 % , 500 ml ) , and one liter of colloid .
cold and warm ischemic times were 400 minutes and 41 minutes , respectively .
at the end of the surgical procedure , the improvement in oxygenation allowed removal of ecmo ( day 13 ) .
despite an episode of methicillin resistant staphylococcus epidermidis ventilator - associated pneumonia treated intravenously by glycopeptids , nitric oxide could be stopped on day 20 .
on the same day , a ct of the chest demonstrated a marked improvement as compared with the pre - operative ct. as shown in figure 1b , the left lower lobe was completely re - aerated whereas the right lower lobe appeared atelectatic , free of enlarged pulmonary vessels .
quantitative analysis of the whole lung revealed a decrease in lung tissue ( from 938 to 815 ml ) , a partial re - aeration of the lower lobes ( from 99 to 591 ml ) and the persistence of some degree of hyperinflation in the upper lobes ( from 463 to 213 ml ) .
transthoracic lung ultrasound revealed a limited hemi - diaphragm excursion , suggesting post - surgical diaphragmatic dysfunction with corresponding passive right lower lobe atelectasis .
on day 27 , the patient 's trachea was successfully extubated .
beside lung function improvement , liver function also improved from day 18 with normalization of liver enzymes and coagulation factors .
on day 30 , laboratory parameters showed asat = 33 iu / l , alat = 42 iu / l , ap = 72 iu / l , gamma - gt = 115 iu / l , total bilirubin = 10 mumol / l , ptt = 90 % , platelet count = 238 g / l. at discharge from the intensive care unit ( day 36 ) , the patient remained o2 dependent ( 5 l / minute ) with an arterial blood gas demonstrating ph , paco2 , and pao2 at 7 , 42 , 35 and 92 mmhg , respectively .
the patient was discharged from hospital at day 48 .
three months after hospital discharge , the patient recovered a correct physical autonomy status without supplemental o2 .
discussion this report describes the case of a patient with deep hypoxaemia resulting from the combination of acute respiratory distress and hepatopulmonary syndromes and refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation support .
the life - threatening respiratory condition was markedly improved by ecmo , allowing successful olt .
to our knowledge , this is the first case report describing the use of ecmo as a bridge to liver transplantation in a cirrhotic patient with life - threatening hypoxaemia resulting from combined ards and hps .
diagnosis of hepatopulmonary syndrome hps is defined as a triad of liver disease - induced portal hypertension , increased alveolar - arterial gradient on room air , and intrapulmonary vascular dilatation .
the latter is evidenced by contrast - enhanced echocardiography detecting the presence of microbubbles injected into an upper extremity vein within the left atrium [ 4 - 6 ] .
the overperfusion of normally aerated lung regions reduces ventilation / perfusion ratios and causes hypoxaemia .
it can be moderate ( pao2 between 60 and 80 mmhg breathing room air ) and well tolerated , or severe ( pao2 <= 60 mmhg breathing room air ) , with progressive development of shortness of breath [ 6 ] .
platypnoea , defined by an increased dyspnoea when moving from supine to upright position , and orthodoexia , defined by a decrease in pao2 > 5 % or > 4 mmhg when moving the patient from supine to upright position , are characteristic features of hps : both are related to upright position - induced blood flow redistribution to lung zones with prominent vascular dilatations , a phenomenon resulting from the absence of pulmonary vascular tone [ 16 ] .
in our patient , hypoxaemia was not diagnosed during the medical follow - up preceding olt , likely because hypoxaemia was moderate and well tolerated .
at hospital admission , however , platypnoea was present , raising the possibility of hps , a hypothesis confirmed by a positive transthoracic contrast - enhanced echocardiography .
causes of the patient 's refractory hypoxaemia the patient 's life - threatening and refractory hypoxaemia was the result of three additive mechanisms : hps , ards and mv - induced lung hyperinflation .
the patient 's ards was characterized by a massive loss of lung aeration , affecting exclusively the lower lobes , and an excess of inflammation predominating in the upper lobes .
such a lung morphology , found in a majority of patients meeting criteria for ards , is generally associated with arterial hypoxaemia poorly responsive to peep [ 11 ] .
in our patient , hps - induced vascular dilatation predominantly found in nonaerated lower lobes ( figure 1a ) , contributed to increase the pulmonary shunt and rendered hypoxaemia totally refractory to peep and inhaled nitric oxide .
in addition , focal lung morphology exposes patients to mv - induced lung hyperinflation [ 11,17 ] .
despite the reduction of tv to 6 ml / kg , lung hyperinflation is observed in one - third of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [ 18 ] .
as observed in our patient , it predominates initially in non - dependent and caudal lung regions [ 19 ] and can lead to late air cysts and bronchiectasis in the same lung regions [ 20 ] .
the immediate effect of mv - induced hyperinflation is to redistribute pulmonary regional blood flow away from upper lobes towards non - aerated lower lobes , thereby further increasing pulmonary shunt and worsening hypoxaemia .
the presence of hps - induced vascular dilatation in lower lobes is another aggravating factor explaining why patient 's life - threatening hypoxaemia could be reversed only by ecmo .
treatment of hepatopulmonary syndrome the medical options in the case of severe hps - related hypoxaemia are limited .
patients with severe hypoxaemia at rest should receive continuous long - term low - flow oxygen therapy [ 6 ] .
the benefit provided by trendelenbourg positioning , insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt , embolisation or pharmacological treatments , including inhaled nitric oxide and nitric oxide inhibitors , have been reported but never confirmed in larger studies [ 6 ] .
several studies have demonstrated that hps - induced severe hypoxaemia can reverse after olt [ 7,21,22 ] .
according to the 2004 european respiratory society recommendations , the indication of olt is firm if pao2 is between 50 and 60 mmhg but is discussed on an individual basis if pao2 is below 50 mmhg [ 6 ] .
in our patient , hypervascularization within lower lobes was not anymore visible on lung ct performed 20 days after olt , suggesting partial regression of hps .
three months after olt , the patient was definitively weaned from nasal o2 , suggesting total reversal of hps in a delay similar to what has been previously reported [ 23 ] .
indications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo may be deployed as arterio - venous ecmo providing both cardiac and respiratory support or as v - v ecmo , which only provides oxygenation [ 2 ] .
a recent clinical report describes the case of a 12 year - old child who , in the early post - operative period following olt , developed life - threatening hypoxaemia attributed to an exacerbation of sepsis - induced ards by the existence of a pre - transplantation hps [ 8 ] .
facing the failure of conventional mv combined with inhaled nitric oxide to provide adequate control of oxygenation , the patient was considered to be a candidate for v - v ecmo .
he remained 18 days on ecmo support , was successfully weaned and remained well for longer than one year post - transplantation .
this report led us to consider that ecmo could be a potential therapeutic option in our patient and proposed as a bridge to liver transplantation .
it is unlikely that hps alone , without concomitant loss of lung aeration may justify ecmo .
in fact , the combination of massive loss of lung aeration and hps - induced vascular dilatation in lower lobes with mv - induced hyperinflation in upper lobes led to life - threatening hypoxaemia refractory to any conventional treatment .
in our patient , ecmo could , via a better control of gas exchange , lower the risk of hypoxaemia - related organ failure during waiting time before olt and during the surgical procedure .
furthermore , ecmo initiated preoperatively could efficiently prevent hps - related worsening of postoperative hypoxaemia .
beside its potential benefits , ecmo may have some harmful effects .
the use of an extracorporeal circuit , requiring systemic anticoagulation , and often leading to thrombocytopenia carries a potential risk of bleeding complications , especially in a cirrhotic patient who may already have thrombocytopenia and compromised liver function tests .
moreover , a higher incidence of infectious complications related to the intravascular insertion of the ecmo cannulae can be dreaded in a cirrhotic patient .
more data concerning the safety issues associated with the use of ecmo in patients with hps are , therefore , needed .
conclusions in conclusion , we report the case of a patient with ards , aggravated by hps and mv - induced hyperinflation , responsible for life - threatening hypoxaemia not controlled by standard supportive measures .
the use of ecmo , by controlling gas exchange , allowed the performing of successful olt .
these preliminary data , therefore , suggest that ecmo could have a place in patients eligible for olt .
it provides the basis to test this strategy in a larger number of patients presenting a combination of acute parenchymal disease and hps .

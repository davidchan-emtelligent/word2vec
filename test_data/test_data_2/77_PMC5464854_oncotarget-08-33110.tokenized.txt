nidogen - 1 ( nid1 ) has been identified as a novel candidate diagnostic biomarker of ovarian cancer in our previous study .
nevertheless , the role of nid1 in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer is unclear .
in the present study , we demonstrated that nid1 was a mesenchymal associated gene and its high expression was significantly correlated with shorter overall survival of ovarian cancer patients .
the ectopic expression of nid1 in ovcar - 3 cells revealed a epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) phenotype accompanied by enhancement of motility , invasiveness and cisplatin resistance , whereas the knockdown of nid1 was sufficient to convert hey cells into epithelial phenotype with decreased capability of motility , invasiveness and cisplatin resistance .
mechanistic studies disclosed that nid1 activated erk / mapk signaling pathway to promote emt .
collectively , our findings have uncovered the molecular mechanisms of nid1 in promoting ovarian cancer metastasis and chemoresistance , and provide a rationale for the therapeutic potential of nid1 suppression in ovarian cancer .
ovarian cancer nid1 emt metastasis chemoresistance introduction ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy worldwide [ 1 ] .
in china , it showed an increasing trend in incidence and mortality for ovarian cancer , with an estimated 52 100 new cases and 22 500 deaths from this disease in 2015 [ 2 ] .
the lethality of ovarian cancer is mainly attributed to the fact that most ovarian cancers are undiagnosed until advanced stages .
despite the evolution of surgical techniques and chemotherapy regimens , most patients with advanced - stage ovarian cancer experience a relapse , with a median progression - free survival of only 18 months [ 3 ] .
ovarian cancer to data is still a poorly understood disease with an extremely poor prognosis .
to provide insight that will enable the development of new therapeutics , it is of paramount importance to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regarding the migratory and invasive properties of ovarian cancer cells .
epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) is a complex multi - step process whereby epithelial cells lose their polarity and acquire the migratory characteristics of mesenchymal cells .
concurrent with a loss of epithelial markers ( e - cadherin , alpha - catenin , gamma - catenin , etc. ) , cells undergoing emt gain mesenchymal cell markers ( n - cadherin , vimentin , fibronectin , etc . )
[ 4 ] .
there is a greater flexibility in this transitional process , during which cells linger in intermediary stages and they frequently undergo a partial emt program , rather than a complete emt program [ 5 ] .
emt has been recognized to be pivotal for embryonic development , tissue fibrosis and cancer progression .
moreover , emt is an initiating event in metastasis of epithelial cancers .
genetic and epigenetic alterations can induce migration and invasion of carcinoma cells , possibly through an emt .
at secondary sites , these cells form a new carcinoma through a mesenchymal - epithelial transition ( met ) [ 6 ] .
epithelial ovarian cancers constitute 90 % of ovarian cancers , thus emt is also essential for the acquisition of the metastatic property in ovarian cancer [ 7 , 8 ] .
basement membrane is a thin layer of highly specialized extracellular matrix , which underline cells and separate cells from and connect them to their interstitial matrix [ 9 ] .
cancer cells must cross basement membrane barriers to spread and then seed at new sites by recruiting a basement membrane - containing vascular supply to expand , therefore the basement membrane is closely linked with cancer invasion and metastasis [ 10 ] .
the main components of basement membrane include collagen iv , laminins , perlecan and nidogens. of these , nidogens are linkers connecting collagen iv and laminin networks , further stabilizing three - dimensional structure of the basement membrane [ 11 ] .
the nidogen family in human consists of two members , nidogen - 1 ( nid1 ) and nidogen - 2 ( nid2 ) .
in the previous ovarian cancer relevant proteomic study , we found nid1 was a candidate diagnostic biomarker for ovarian cancer ; it is elevated in the peripheral blood of ovarian cancer patients compared to normal controls [ 12 , 13 ] .
to date , few studies have reported on the non - structural role of nid1 .
nid1 enhanced cell spreading in hek293t cells [ 14 ] , or promoted skin wound healing [ 15 , 16 ] .
in addition , inhibition of nid1 reduced the migration and invasion of etv5 overexpressing endometrial cancer cells [ 17 ] .
however , its detailed function in ovarian cancer remains unknown .
taking a close relationship between cancer metastasis , emt and basement membrane into consideration , we wondered whether nid1 involved in ovarian cancer emt and thus metastasis .
in this study , we present the first evidence that nid1 promotes the migration , invasion and chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells via emt and its molecular mechanism involves the activation of erk / mapk signaling .
results nid1 is a mesenchymal associated gene epithelial ovarian cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease and the publicly available ovarian cancer cell lines undoubtedly present distinct morphologic characteristics .
beaufort and colleagues characterized a series of ovarian cancer cell lines into a spindle subtype and an epithelial subtype , based on hierarchical clustering using differentially expressed genes [ 18 ]. of these , nid1 showed high expression in the spindle subtype , rather than the epithelial subtype ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 1a ) .
additionally , gene expression analysis of high - grade serous ovarian cancer tissues were performed and then designated four molecular subtypes (" immunoreactive " , " differentiated " , " proliferative " , and " mesenchymal ") , from the australian ovarian cancer study and the cancer genome atlas research network study [ 19 , 20 ] .
the four molecular subtypes were then applied to the mayo clinic cohort [ 21 ] and the bonome cohort [ 22 ] .
for both , expression of nid1 was significantly elevated in the " mesenchymal " subtype than that in the other three subtypes ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 1b and 1c ) .
moreover , high expression of nid1 was correlated with shorter overall survival of ovarian cancer patients ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 1d and 1e ) .
the relevance of its high expression and the spindle as well as the " mesnencymal " subtype shows that nid1 probably imparts emt - prone phenotype to ovarian cancer cells .
figure 1 nid1 was a meshenchymal associated gene ( a ) nid1 expression level in indicated ovarian cancer cell lines with two morphological subtypes ( 10 epithelial and 3 spindle ) .
the ovarian cancer cell line gene expression data processed by 2log normalization was extracted from the helleman cohort ( gse53418 ) .
statistical analysis was done using two - sided independent student 's t test .

the gene expression datasets of 174 and 185 high - grade serous ovarian cancer tissue processed by 2log normalization were extracted from the mayo clinic cohort ( gse53963 ) ( b ) and the bonome cohort ( gse26712 ) ( c ) , respectively .
statistical analysis was done using two - sided independent student 's t test .
( d - e ) prognostic significance of nid1 in ovarian cancer .
kaplan - meier plot of overall survival of patients with high - grade serous ovarian cancer were obtained from the mayo clinic cohort ( gse53963 ) ( d ) and the bonome cohort ( gse26712 ) ( e ) , respectively .
the survival curves were compared using the log - rank test .
p - values were two - sided and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
nid1 regulates the phenotype of ovarian cancer cells through emt process to obtain further insights into the emt - promoting capability of nid1 in ovarian cancer , we first generated the stable ovcar - 3 monoclone with ectopic expression of nid1 .
the ovcar - 3 - nid1 - mc cells showed markedly enhanced nid1 mrna ( p < 0.01 ; figure 2c ) and nid1 protein levels ( figure 2b ) , with a shift from cobblestone - like morphology to a spindle shape ( figure 2a and figure 2d ) .
furthermore , ovcar - 3 - nid1 - mc cells demonstrated a decrease in the epithelial marker e - cadherin but an increase in mesenchymal marker vimentin and the emt transcription factor twist - 2 , compared to ovcar - 3 - vector cells ( figure 2b and figure 2c ) .
consistent with this , immunofluoresence detection showed the coherent change of vimentin , whereas no change of e - cadherin , in ovcar - 3 - nid1 - mc cells ( figure 2d ) .
it appears stable expression of nid1 in ovcar - 3 cells cause a partial emt process .

similar results were observed in nid1 - silencing hey cells .
the hey - nid1 - si798 and hey - nid1 - si2983 cells showed significantly reduced nid1 mrna ( p < 0.05 ; figure 3c ) and nid1 protein levels ( figure 3b ) .
nid1 knockdown resulted in a dramatic reversion towards the epithelial phenotype , which altered cell morphology from a spindle shape to a cobblestone - like shape ( figure 3a and figure 3d ) .
re - expression of the epithelial marker e - cadherin was detected in hey cells after nid1 silencing , along with unchanged levels of the mesenchymal marker vimentin and the emt transcription factor twist - 2 ( figure 3b ) .
immunofluoresence analyses showed that nid1 knockdown changed e - cadherin in its cellular distribution not its expression level .
compared to its cytosolic localization in hey - nc - sirna cells , e - cadherin alternatively appeared on the plasma membrane / cell junction in both of hey - nid1 - si798 and hey - nid1 - si2983 cells ( figure 3d ) .
it indicates that nid1 silencing induces a partial met process in ovarian cancer cells .
this finding is in accordance to the aforementioned clues from ectopic nid1 expression relevant experiments .
the present results lend support to the emt - promoting role of nid1 in ovarian cancer .

erk / mapk signaling pathway is involved in emt process induced by nid1 previous studies have reported that mapk pathways and pi3k / akt pathway involve in cancer cell migration and invasion via upregulating twist in a variety of human cancers [ 23 - 26 ] .
therefore , we ascertained whether these pathways function in the emt - promoting role of nid1or not .
as shown in figure 4 , ectopic expression of nid1 increased the abundance of phosphorylated ( activated ) erk1 / 2 , whereas it did n't change the levels of phosphorylated ( activated ) jnk , phosphorylated ( activated ) p38 and phosphorylated ( activated ) akt1 .
conversely , nid1 knockdown slightly reduced the abundance of phosphorylated erk1 / 2 ( supplementary figure 1 ) .
thus , we hypothesized that the emt - promoting function of nid1 in ovarian cancer cells might result from the activation of erk / mapk pathway .
to address this issue , ovcar - 2 - nid1 - mc cells were treated with a mek1 inhibitor ( u0126 ) , which significantly reduced the level of phosphorylated erk1 / 2 .
importantly , u0126 abrogated the nid1 - induced expression of vimentin and twist - 2 afterwards , without alteration of e - cadherin expression ( figure 5a and 5b ) .
these findings reveal that nid1 impinges on erk / mapk signaling pathway to foster the emt of ovarian cancer cells .

nid1 exacerbates ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion emt is currently considered as a key event for tumor metastasis , we next determined the effect of nid1 on ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion .
matrigel migration / invasion assays showed that migratory and invasive ovcar - 3 - nid1 - mc cells were both more than migratory and invasive ovcar - 3 - vector cells ( p = 0.024 ; figure 6b and p = 0.210 ; figure 6c ) .
concordantly , the wound - healing capacity of ovcar - 3 - nid1 - mc cells was dramatically greater than that of ovcar - 3 - vector cells ( figure 6a ) .
nid1 overexpression did n't significantly affect the proliferation rate of ovcar - 3 cells ( p = 0.591 ; figure 6d ) .
figure 6 expression of nid1 in ovcar - 3 cells facilitated cell migration and invasion ( a ) representative scraping wounds formed by ovcar - 3 - vector and ovcar - 3 - nid1 - mc cells were measured at 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 days after wounding ( scale bar = 100 mum ) .

means and s.ds at each time point are shown from three independent experiments performed in triplicates .
statistical analysis was done using two - sided paired student 's t test or independent student 's t test .
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
in contrast , nid1 silencing in hey cells reduced cell migration and invasiveness .
compared to hey - nc - sirna cells , hey - nid1 - si798 and hey - nid1 - si2983 cells both exhibited weaker migration capacity ( p = 0.105 , p = 0.033 ; figure 7a ) , as well as invasion capacity ( p = 0.049 , p = 0.087 ; figure 7b ) .
together , these data suggest a positive role of nid1 in the motility and invasiveness of ovarian cancer cells associated with partial emt process .

nid1 promotes the cisplatin - based resistance of ovarian cancer cells taking the relevance of emt with chemoresistance of cancer cells into consideration , we further investigated the effects of nid1 on cisplatin - based resistance in ovarian cancer cells .
koti and colleages performed the whole transcriptome profiling with 28 high - grade serous ovarian cancer tissues , which were divided into the platinum - sensitive group and the platinum - resistant group [ 27 ] .
the nid1 level was remarkably higher in the resistant group than that in the sensitive group ( p = 0.025 ; figure 8a ) , and its level was positively correlated with the well - characterized drug efflux transporters mdr1 ( p = 0.041 , figure 8b ) and abcg2 ( p = 0.008 ; figure 8c ) , respectively .
figure 8 the gene expression datasets of 28 high - grade serous ovarian cancer tissue processed by 2log normalization was extracted from the koti group ( gse51373 ) nid1 expression level was indicated in the platinum - sensitive group and the platinum - resistant group ( a ) correlations between the expression levels of nid1 and mdr1 ( b ) or abcg2 ( c ) were evaluated with the pearson correlation test .
( d ) the cell viability of ovcar - 3 - vector and ovcar - 3 - nid1 - mc cells treated with various concentrations of cisplatin was measured by cck - 8 assay .
( e ) quantitative rt - pcr for mdr1 and abcg2 in the indicated cells , with gapdh as the quantitative control .
( f ) the cell viability of hey - nc - sirna , hey - nid1 - si798 and hey - nid1 - si2983 cells treated with various concentrations of cisplatin was measured by cck - 8 assay .
( g ) quantitative rtpcr for mdr1 and abcg2 in the indicated cells , with gapdh as the quantitative control .
three independent experiments were performed in triplicates .
statistical analysis was done using twosided independent student 's t test .
* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 .
these results described above suggested that nid1 might contribute to chemoresistance .
to test this premise , we examined cisplatin - sensitivity of ovcar - 3 - vector cells and ovcar - 3 - nid1 - mc cells .
compared to ovcar - 3 - vector cells , ovcar - 3 - nid1 - mc cells exhibited higher cisplatin resistance ( p < 0.05 ; figure 8d ) and correspondingly higher expression levels of mdr1 and abcg2 ( p < 0.01 ; figure 8e ) .
furthermore , the cisplatin - sensitivity of nid1 - silencing hey cells were detected as well .
hey - nc - sirna cells showed slightly higher cisplatin resistance ( p < 0.05 ; figure 8f ) and higher expression levels of mdr1 and abcg2 ( p < 0.05 ; figure 8g ) , relative to nid1 - silencing hey cells .
discussion we previously demonstrated that nid1 was elevated in the peripheral blood of ovarian cancer patients compared to normal controls [ 12 , 13 ] .
its abnormal expression level probably alter the integral organization of basement membrane and its functions .
in the present study , nid1 was also indicated as a mesenchymal associated protein , based on its higher expression in spindle - and mesenchymal - subtypes ( figure 1 ) .
furthermore , nid1 promoted the emt process of ovarian cancer cells whereby they lose their epithelial characteristics and acquire certain mesenchymal properties ( figure 2 ) .
in classical emt , cancer cells undergoing emt present a loss of epithelial markers ( e - cadherin , etc. ) and a gain of mesenchymal cell markers ( vimentin , etc. ) .
nevertheless , the expression patterns of emt markers do not follow this model in this study .
the immunofluoresence detection did n't show the alteration of e - cadherin in nid1 - overexpressed ovcar - 3 cells .
accordingly , vimentin did n't change obviously in nid1 - silencing hey cells .
they all suggest ovarian cancer cells undergo a partial emt process .
a partial emt state has been noted in many developmental , wound healing , fibrosis , and cancer processes , with the existence of intermediate hybrid epithelial and mesnechymal phenotype [ 5 ] .
the complexity of emt in ovarian cancer cells probably stems from their heterogeneous nature .
epithelial ovarian cancer is the predominant form of ovarian cancer , comprising several histological subtypes based on tumor cell morphology .
the four major histological subtypes include serous , mucinous , clear cell , and endometrioid. of these , the serous type is the most common , originating from fallopian tube epithelium .
ovcar - 3 cells and hey cells are of the serous ovarian cancer subtype .
previous reports indicate that intermediate states of emt display the highest plasticity , and thus represent an appropriate stage within which to induce or reverse emt [ 28 ] .
however , ovcar - 3 cells and hey cells present epithelial phenotype and mesenchymal phenotype , respectively .
the effect of nid1 is limited , therefore these ovarian cancer cells separately retain partial intrinsic characteristics during the transition to their opposite phenotype .
twist - 1 and twist - 2 are bhlh transcription factors responsible for emt .
twist - 1 has been reported in a role in mapk pathway to mediate emt [ 23 , 24 ] .
however , our data suggested that emt induced by nid1 was associated with aberrant activation of erk / mapk pathway which then functions on twist - 2 , not twist - 1 ( figure 2b and figure 5a ) .
integrins are heterodimeric cell surface glycoproteins consisting of alpha and beta subunits and mediate the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) .
the binding of integrins and the ecm leads to the recruitment of focal adhesion kinase ( fak ) to the newly formed focal adhesion sites .
subsequently , fak acts as a phosphorylation - regulated signaling scaffold , which activates downstream effectors ( such as erk / mapk pathway , jnk / mapk pathway and pi3k / akt pathway ) and then results in cell migration and invasion [ 29 ] .
as a critical component in basement membrane , nid1 was able to bind with integrin alpha3beta1 [ 30 ] .
therefore , we examined if integrin - fak signaling involved in the activation of erk / mapk pathway by nid1 .
herein we demonstrated that integrin alpha3 was also expressed in ovcar - 3 - vector cells and ovcar - 3 - nid1 - mc cells ( supplementary figure 2 ) .
ectopic expression of nid1 enhanced the phosphorylation of fak at y397 ( figure 4 ) .
furthermore , treatment of pf573228 ( an fak inhibitor ) remarkably reduced the level of phosphorylation y397 in fak as well as that of phosphorylated erk1 / 2 , but it hardly changed the expressions of emt - relevant markers ( supplementary figure 3 ) .
all these points raised the possibility that the diminution of integrin - fak signaling provoked other downstream pathways which compensated the effects of erk / mapk inactivation .
in this context , fak is inapplicable as an drug target in ovarian cancer treatment .
the emt has been implicated in two of the most important process responsible for cancer - related mortality : progression to distant metastatic disease and acquisition of therapeutic resistance [ 31 ] .
we demonstrated nid1 promoted ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion ( figure 6 and figure 7 ) .
there are few reports with respect to the pathological role of nid1 in cancer progression .
in agreement with our observation , inhibition of nid1 reduced the migration and invasion of etv5 - overexpressed endometrial cancer cells [ 17 ] .
in addition , we found nid1 favored cisplatin - based resistance of ovarian cancer , with refractory patients having the higher expression level of nid1 , nid1 - overexpressed cells having higher cisplatin resistance and nid1 - silencing cells having weaker cisplatin resistance ( figure 8a , figure 8d and figure 8f ) .
the occurrence of cisplatin - resistance is correlated with a plethora of molecular mechanisms , including enhancing cytotoxic agents extrusion by atp - binding cassette ( abc ) transporters [ 32 ] .
herein we proposed that nid1 exacerbated resistance of ovarian cancer cells via upregulating the expression of mdr1 and abcg2 ( figure 8e and figure 8g ) , two well - known abc transporters .
besides nid1 , several regulators , such as hpip , nanog and foxm1 , have been reported to promote emt of ovarian cancer cells and then confer them drug resistance , involving pi3k / akt pathway , stat3 pathway , etc [ 33 - 36 ] .
the aforementioned results implicated that nid1 - overexpressed ovarian cancer cells potentially exhibited cancer stem cell - like characteristics which imparts the metastatic and chemoresistant advantage to cells .
as an example , the expression level of cd44 ( one ovarian cancer stem cell marker ) was increased in nid1 - overexpressed ovcar - 3 cells but decreased in nid1 - depleted hey cells ( supplementary figure 4 ) .
recent evidence has highlighted a link between emt and cancer stem cells that favor metastasis and therapeutic resistance of tumors , and the subtypes of cancer stem cells that display therapeutic resistance and phenotypic plasticity may be promising therapeutic targets [ 37 ] .
in further work , we would focus on these issues .
in summary , our study shows that nid1 is a mesenchymal associated gene and is significantly correlated with poor prognosis of ovarian cancer .
moreover , nid1 plays a critical role in ovarian cancer cell migration , invasion and chemoresistance by partial emt process .
the underlying mechanism involves , at least in part , the activation of erk / mapk signaling pathway .
thus , nid1 may represent a candidate prognostic indicator and a potential therapeutic target of ovarian cancer .

cell viability assay cytotoxicity assay was determined by cell counting kit - 8 ( beyotime , jiangsu , china ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
ovarian cancer cells were seeded in 96 - well plates at 1x104 cells per well and then treated with the indicated concentration of cisplatin ( meilun biotechnology , liaoning , china ) for 24h .
three independent experiments were performed in triplicates .
statistical analysis ovarian cancer microarray data were downloaded from the public geo database ( gse53418 , gse53963 , gse26712 and gse51373 ) .
all statistical analyses were carried out using the spss software , version 16.0 ( spss inc , chicago , il , usa ) .
independent student 's t test was performed to analyze the significance of markers' mrna level , cell proliferation assay and cell viability assay .
paired student 's t test was applied in transwell migration / invasion assay .
overall survival curves were plotted by the kaplan - meier method and compared by log - rank test .
correlations between protein expression levels were evaluated with pearson correlation test .
all comparisons were two - tailed , and p values of < 0.05 were taken to be statistically significant .

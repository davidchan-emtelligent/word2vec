environmental stress elevates the level of jasmonic acid ( ja ) and activates the biosynthesis of nicotine and related pyridine alkaloids in tobacco ( nicotiana tabacum l. ) by up - regulating the expression of putrescine n - methyltransferase 1 ( ntpmt1 ) , which encodes a putrescine n - methyl transferase that catalyzes nicotine formation .
the ja signal suppressor jasmonate zim domain 1 ( ntjaz1 ) and its target protein , ntmyc2a , also regulate nicotine biosynthesis ; however , how these proteins interact to regulate abiotic - induced nicotine biosynthesis is poorly understood .
in this study , we found that high - temperature ( ht ) treatment activated transcription of ntmyc2a , which subsequently stimulated the transcription of genes associated with ja biosynthesis , including lipoxygenase ( lox ) , allene oxide synthase ( aos ) , allene oxide cyclase ( aoc ) , and 12 - oxophytodienodate reductase ( opr ) .
overexpression of ntmyc2a increased nicotine biosynthesis by enhancing its binding to the promoter of ntpmt1 .
overexpression of either ntjaz1 or proteasome - resistant ntjaz1deltac suppressed nicotine production under normal conditions , but overexpression only of the former resulted in low levels of nicotine under ht treatment .
these data suggest that ht induces ntmyc2a accumulation through increased transcription to activate nicotine synthesis ; meanwhile , ht - induced ntmyc2a can activate ja synthesis to promote additional ntmyc2a activity by degrading ntjaz1 at the post - transcriptional level .

nicotine is the main alkaloid produced by cultivated tobacco ( n. tabacum l. ) , constituting ~ 0.6 - 3 % of the tobacco leaf dry weight .
nicotine is synthesized in the root from ornithine and arginine by way of putrescine .
putrescine is either metabolized to higher polyamines , such as spermidine and spermine , or conjugated with cinnamic acid derivatives or fatty acids in all higher plants ; however , it is also converted into n - methylputrescine in plants that produce nicotine or tropane alkaloids .
thus , putrescine n - methyltransferase ( pmt ; ec 2.1.1.53 ) participates in the first committed step of alkaloid biosynthesis ( chattopadhyay and ghosh , 1998 ; chou and kutchan , 1998 ) .
n - methylputrescine is then oxidized by a diamine oxidase ( ec1.4.3.6 ) and cyclized spontaneously to the l - methyl - a ' - pyrrolinium cation , which is condensed with nicotinic acid or its derivative .
quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase ( qaprt ; ec2.4.2.19 ) serves as the entry - point enzyme in the pyridine nucleotide cycle , which supplies nicotinic acid .
after biosynthesis in the tobacco root , nicotine is translocated to the leaf via the xylem and stored in the leaf vacuole with the help of a tonoplast - localized transporter .
nicotine can be demethylated in both leaves and roots , but it is primarily demethylated in senescing leaves ( wagner et al. , 1986 ; chou and kutchan , 1998 ) .
the accumulation of nicotine in tobacco is affected by environmental factors , culture practices , and plant hormone levels .
for example , the application of nitrogen fertilizer or jasmonic acid ( ja ) markedly increases nicotine biosynthesis ( de luca and st pierre , 2000 ; shoji et al. , 2000 ; facchini , 2001 ; goossens et al. , 2003 ; paschold et al. , 2007 ) .
however , little is known about the underlying mechanism .
ja and its oxylipin derivatives , collectively called jasmonates , play important roles in multiple physiological processes , including defense responses against abiotic and biotic stresses ( farmer et al. , 2003 ; robert - seilaniantz et al. , 2011 ) .
the jasmonate signal reprograms the transcriptional profiles that determine a set of physiological responses ( chini et al. , 2007 ; niu and figueroa , 2011 ) .
myc2 , a basic helix - loop - helix ( bhlh ) transcription factor in arabidopsis thaliana , and its homologs regulate the expression of a broad range of jasmonate - responsive genes by directly binding to their g - boxes ( xu and timko , 2004 ; gangappa and chattopadhyay , 2013 ) .
recently , the jasmonate signal was also found to regulate another bhlh factor , ice1 , to enhance arabidopsis tolerance to freezing stress ( hu et al. , 2013 ) .
the jasmonate signal is involved in the biosynthesis of defense - related secondary metabolites .
the perception of a ja signal through ja - ile by the receptor f - box protein coronatine insensitive1 ( coi1 ) leads to the formation of a stable coi1 / ja - ile complex , which subsequently degrades the jasmonate zim domain ( jaz ) protein family via the 26s proteasome complex ( chung et al. , 2008 ; sheard et al. , 2010 ; yan et al. , 2013 ) .
in the absence of ja - ile , jaz proteins bind to their target proteins , such as myc2a , to inactivate the downstream ja signal .
however , once jazs have been degraded in the presence of ja - ile , myc2a is released to activate the downstream components of the ja signaling pathway alone or in cooperation with other transcription factors ( lorenzo et al. , 2004 ; chini et al. , 2007 ) .
the function and stability of jazs are strictly controlled by endogenous hormones and exogenous environmental signals .
for example , the gibberellin - responsive della proteins interact with jazs to promote their degradation in arabidopsis ( hou et al. , 2010 ; yang et al. , 2012 ; qi et al. , 2014 ) .
zhang et al. reported that the tobacco transcription factors ntmyc2a and ntmyc2b form a nuclear complex with ntjaz1 to regulate jasmonate - induced nicotine biosynthesis ( zhang et al. , 2012 ) , suggesting that ntjaz1 and ntmyc2 interact to control nicotine biosynthesis .
to explore the underlying molecular mechanism whereby environmental factors affect nicotine biosynthesis , we examined the effect of several environmental stress factors , including high temperature ( ht , 32degreesc ) , wounding , salinity , and heavy metal stress , on nicotine production .
we found that ht treatment effectively enhanced nicotine biosynthesis in tobacco .
further analysis demonstrated that ht increased transcription of ntmyc2a .
on the one hand , ht - induced ntmyc2a can bind the promoter region of ntpmt1 to induce nicotine synthesis .
on the other hand , ht - induced ntmyc2a increased the expression of genes including ntlox , ntaos , ntaoc , and ntopr and finally induced the accumulation of ja .
ntmyc2a - mediated ja accumulation further decreased the stability of ntjaz1 thus promoted additional ntmyc2a activity for accelerate ja biosynthesis .
based on these findings , we propose that ntmyc2a plays the bifunctional roles in ht - induced nicotine biosynthesis at the transcriptional and post - transcriptional level .
overall , our results reveal a novel mechanism that ht induces nicotine biosynthesis by precisely modulating ntmyc2a in tobacco .

results ht induces the accumulation of nicotine and up - regulates the transcription of ntmyc2a to investigate the effects of different environmental factors on nicotine biosynthesis in roots from 4 - week - old hydroponic tobacco seedlings , we monitored the effects of various stresses , such as ht , wounding , salinity , and heavy metal cadmium treatment , on different alkaloid content , including nicotine , nornicotine , and anatabine .
we found that ht , wounding and salinity treatments increased the contents of nicotine , nornicotine in tobacco roots , but cadmium treatment only increased the contents of nicotine and nornicotine , but not anatabine ( figure 1a ) .
among these treatments , ht treatment resulted in the greatest increase in these alkaloid content ( figure 1a ) .
in a time course experiment , ht treatment caused a gradual increase in nicotine , nornicotine , and anatabine , which still sustained high level after 9 days of treatment ( figure 1b ) .
given that ntpmt1 is the key enzyme in the nicotine biosynthesis pathway ( shoji and hashimoto , 2011 ; zhang et al. , 2012 ) , we evaluated the effect of ht on ntpmt1 accumulation in tobacco roots using ntpmt1 antibody .
we found that the level of ntpmt1 increased after 1 day of ht treatment and remained high for at least 9 days of ht treatment ( figure 1c ) .

ht induces ntmyc2a transcripts and activates the ja synthesis pathway ntmyc2a acts as the key transcriptional factor to regulate nicotine synthesis in tobacco ( zhang et al. , 2012 ) .
to understand the role of ntmyc2a in nicotine synthesis under different stresses , we determined the transcriptional level of ntmyc2a after 12 h of stress treatment .
as shown in figure 2a , we found that all of these treatments , including wounding , ht , and saline or heavy metal exposure , could increase the transcriptional level of ntmyc2a in tobacco root tissue .
among these treatments , the effect of ht was substantially higher .
we also measured the time course effect of ht treatment on the transcription of ntmyc2a in tobacco root tissue .
ht treatment activated expression of ntmyc2a after 6 h and had a maximal effect after 24 h ( figure 2b ) .
the sustained activation of ntmyc2a transcripts even after 72 h of ht treatment ( figure 2b ) suggested that ntmyc2a may play a role in ht - induced nicotine biosynthesis .
figure 2 ht induces ntmyc2a transcripts .
data are the mean +/ - sd from triplicate experiments .
bars with different letters are significantly difference at p < 0.05 ( tukey 's test ) .
( a ) the effects of different treatments on ntmyc2a expression in the roots of tobacco seedlings .
four - week - old tobacco seedlings were exposed to leaf wounding , ht , salinity at 100 mm nacl , heavy metal at 30 mum cdcl2 , or under normal condition at 24degreesc as the control ( ck ) , for 24 h , and transcripts of ntmyc2a were measured .
( b ) time course showing the effect of ht on the transcriptional level of ntmyc2a in the roots of tobacco seedlings .
four - week - old tobacco seedlings were grown at 32degreesc for the indicated periods of time , and the transcriptional level of ntmyc2a was measured by quantitative rt - pcr .
it is reported that ntmyc2a binds to the core g - box motif [ 5 ' - cacgt ( t / g ) - 3 '] as well as to the g - box - related motif sequences [ ca ( c / t )( g / a ) tt or ca ( c / t )( g / a ) tg ] ( shoji and hashimoto , 2011 ). by searching the promoter region , we found a series of ntmyc2a - recognized g - box or g - box - related motifs in promoters of genes associated with ja biosynthesis , including ntlox , ntaos , ntaoc , and ntopr ( figure 3a ; see supplementary file 1 for detailed information ) .
these results hint that ntmyc2a may bind these motif to activate their expression .
to further investigate the role of ntmyc2a in regulating the transcription of ja biosynthesis genes , we generated transgenic tobacco expressing 6ha - fused ntmyc2a driven by a 35s promoter ( ntmyc2a - 6ha lines ) .
quantitative rt - pcr analysis showed that three transgenic tobacco lines all expressed high levels of ntmyc2a compared with actin as the control ( supplementary figure 1a ) .
ha immunoblots of these lines showed that this protein was well expressed within root tissues ( supplementary figure 1b ) .
based on complementary chip - pcr studies , ntmyc2a strongly interacted with selected components of ntaos , ntaoc , and ntopr promoters , such as the g - motif 5 ' - cacgt ( t / g ) - 3 ' , but showed less interaction with fragments with other g - motifs , such as catat ( t / g ) in the promoter of ntlox ( figure 3b ) .
to test this possibility , we measured changes in ntmyc2a - induced gene expression in tobacco root tissue over a time course of ht treatment .
indeed the expression of these four genes was increased after 6 h of ht treatment , and these levels were sustained for the entire 96 h of ht treatment ( figure 3c ) .
mean wile , we found the higher transcriptional levels of ntlox , ntaos , ntaoc , and ntopr in the transgenic ntmyc2a - 6ha lines compared those in the control wild type lines ( supplementary figure 2 ) .
these data are consistent with a previous study ( shoji and hashimoto , 2011 ) showing that ntmyc2a binds to different g - motifs with varying affinities and indicate that the g - motif may be important for the binding of ntmyc2a to regulate the expression of ja synthesis - related genes under ht stress .

ht treatment induced a gradual increase in both ja and ja - ile in tobacco roots , and the levels of ja and ja - ile gradually increased after ht treatment and remained high for at least 9 days of treatment ( figure 4a ) .
we also found that the application of exogenous meja treatment increased the nicotine content in tobacco seedlings ( figure 4b ) .
these data correlated with the above finding that ht increased the transcripts of genes associated with ja biosynthesis including ntlox , ntaos , ntaoc , and ntopr ( figure 3c ) .
diethyldithiocarbamic acid ( dieca ) ja biosynthesis in plants .
application of dieca partly suppressed ht - induced nicotine biosynthesis ( supplementary figure 3 ) , which further supports the role of ja signaling in ht - induced nicotine biosynthesis .
figure 4 ja and nicotine biosynthesis are induced by ht and meja treatment , respectively .

high temperature promotes ntjaz1 degradation ja promotes the degradation of ntjaz1 , which also participates in nicotine biosynthesis ( shoji et al. , 2008 ) .
as ht induced ja accumulation , it is possible that ht also triggers the degradation of ntjaz1 in tobacco roots .
to test this hypothesis , we generated transgenic tobacco plants that constitutively express a gfp fusion of ntjaz1 driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus ( camv ) 35s promoter ( ntjaz1 - gfp lines ) .
western blotting using gfp antibody showed a higher level of ntjaz1 - gfp in the root tissue of transgenic ntjaz1 - gfp lines as compared with the non - transgenic control line ( supplementary figure 4 ) , confirming that a higher level of ntjaz1 - gfp is present in the transgenic ntjaz1 - gfp lines .
obvious gfp fluorescence was also detected in the root tips of transgenic ntjaz1 - gfp plants ( figure 5a ) .
the degradation of ntjaz1 was observed by monitoring the gfp signal in ntjaz1 - gfp lines .
the intensity of gfp fluorescence in the roots of ntjaz1 - gfp plants decreased gradually during ht treatment ( figure 5a , middle panel ) in contrast these lines under normal condition as the control ( figure 5a , upper panel ) .
consistent with this , immunoblotting analysis using anti - gfp demonstrated that ht obviously induced ntjaz1 - gfp degradation in the tobacco root tissue compared with those line under normal condition as the control ( figure 5b ) .
figure 5 ht and meja induce the degradation of ntjaz1 - gfp .
( a,b ) ht induces ntjaz1 - gfp degradation .
four - week - old transgenic ntjaz1 - gfp # 2 seedlings were subjected to ht treatment at 32degreesc or under normal condition at 24degreesc ( ck ) for the indicated times .
the degradation of ntjaz1 - gfp was monitored by gfp fluorescence intensity .
for proteasome inhibitor mg132 treatment , mg132 at 10 mum were used .
( b ) western blotting analysis of the stability of ntjaz1 - gfp after ht treatment at 32degreesc or under normal condition using anti - gfp .
anti - actin was used as a loading control .
( c ) meja treatment induces the degradation of ntjaz1 - gfp .
two - week - old transgenic ntjaz1 - gfp # 2 seedlings were exposed to 100 mm meja for the indicated times .
degradation of ntjaz1 - gfp was monitored by western blotting as in ( b ) .
proteasome - mediated ubiquitination modulates jaz degradation in arabidopsis ( chung et al. , 2008 ; yan et al. , 2013 ) .
we thus investigated whether ntjaz1 degradation under ht treatment also depends on the proteasome - mediated ubiquitination pathway .
we treated a ntjaz1 - gfp line with mg132 , a specific inhibitor of the 26s proteasome , to suppress the proteasome - mediated ubiquitination pathway , and found that ht did not efficiently reduce gfp fluorescence in the root tips of the mg132 - treated ntjaz1 - gfp plants ( figure 5a , bottom panel ) , which suggests a role for the proteasome - mediated ubiquitination pathway in ht - induced ntjaz1 protein degradation .
application of exogenous meja also accelerated ntjaz1 - gfp degradation in the tobacco root tissue ( figure 5c ) .
ht enhances the binding of ntmyc2a to the promoter of ntpmt1 ntmyc2a can bind to the g - motif within the promoter of ntpmt2 to activate ntpmt2 expression ( shoji and hashimoto , 2011 ) .
we also searched on g - box in the ntpmt1 ( supplementary file 2 ) .
to further investigate the effect of ht on the binding capability of ntmyc2a to ntpmt1 in vivo , we generated a construct in which the luciferase gene is driven by the ntpmt1 promoter and co - transformed this construct into tobacco root protoplasts along with the ntmyc2a - 6ha construct by polyethylene glycol - mediated co - transformation .
we observed significant luminescence in tobacco root protoplasts co - expressing pntpmt1 : luc and ntmyc2a - 6ha ( figures 6a,b ) ; however , the luminescence intensity increased after the protoplasts were subjected to ht at 32degreesc for 30 min .
luminescence was observed in the two controls , root protoplasts co - transformed with pntpmt1 : luc with the empty effector vector and protoplasts coexpressing ntmyc2a - 6ha and pntpmt1 - m1 : luc , which harbors a mutation ( cacgca ) in the g - box motif of ntpmt1 ( supplementary figure 5 ) .

chip results were normalized to input chromatin , and a fragment in the actin2 promoter was used to normalize the data .

bars with different letters are significantly difference at p < 0.05 ( tukey 's test ) .
we also performed chip assays using the transgenic myc2a - 6ha line and anti - gfp notably , our assays showed that , among the g - box - containing ( f2 ) and non - g - box - containing ( f1 and f3 ) regions , only the g - box - containing region was greatly enriched by anti - gfp in the chip assays ( figures 6c,d , supplementary file 2 ) .
these results demonstrate that ntmyc2a specifically associates with the g - box region in the promoter of ntpmt1 .
ht releases free ntmyc2a from the ntmyc2a - ntjaz1 complex ntjaz1 can sequester ntmyc2a under normal conditions ( zhang et al. , 2012 ) .
in addition , ja treatment can promote ntjaz1 degradation to release free ntmyc2a and subsequently activate the transcription of ntpmt1 and nicotine synthesis ( shoji et al. , 2008 ) .
to investigate whether ht treatment also releases ntmyc2a from the ntmyc2a - ntjaz1 complex to activate nicotine synthesis , we generated a construct containing gfp fused to ntjaz1 ( ntjaz1 - gfp ) or to a version of ntjaz1 that lacks the jas motif ( ntjaz1deltac - gfp ; figure 7a ) .
ntjaz1deltac is resistant to proteasome - mediated degradation ( shoji et al. , 2008 ) .
we also generated a transgenic line expressing ntjaz1deltac driven by the 35s promoter ( ntjaz1deltac - gfp ) .
western blotting indicated a high level of ntjaz1deltac - gfp accumulation in these transgenic lines ( supplementary figure 4 ) .
ht treatment obviously induced the degradation of ntjaz1 - gfp in the root tissue of transgenic ntjaz1 - gfp lines but did not induce the degradation of ntjaz1deltac - gfp in the root tissue of transgenic ntjaz1deltac - gfp lines ( figures 7a,b ) .
consistence with it , we found that co - expression of ntjaz1deltac also repressed ntmyc2a - induced pntpmt1 - luc activity at 24degreesc .
in contrast , ht treatment abolished the inhibitory effect of ntjaz1 on ntmyc2a - induced pntpmt1 - luc activity but did not significantly inhibit the effect of ntjaz1deltac on ntmyc2a - induced pntpmt1 - luc activity ( figures 6a,b ) , which suggest the possibility that ht accelerated the nicotine biosynthesis through releasing the inhibitory effect of ntjaz1 on ntmyc2a function .
figure 7 ntjaz1 and ntjaz1deltac suppress the ntmyc2a - mediated up - regulation of ntpmt1 transcription .
( a ) schematic diagrams of the fused ntjaz1 - gfp and ntjaz1deltac - gfp lacking the jas domain .
( b ) evaluation of ntjaz1 - gfp and ntjaz1deltac - gfp stability in transgenic ntjaz1 - gfp and ntjaz1deltac - gfp lines , respectively , under ht conditions .
the transgenic ntjaz1 - gfp # 2 and ntjaz1deltac - gfp # 3 lines were treated with ht for the indicated times , and the stability of ntjaz1 - gfp and ntjaz1deltac - gfp was monitored using anti - gfp .
anti - actin was used as the loading control .
the root tissue of ntjaz1 - gfp and ntjaz1deltac - gfp seedlings exhibited lower nicotine biosynthesis under normal conditions at 24degreesc compared with that of the non - transgenic tobacco .
ht treatment at 32degreesc for 5 days obviously increased nicotine biosynthesis in the root tissue of the non - transgenic line .
ht also increased the nicotine content in the ntjaz1 - gfp lines , in contrast , ht treatment did not significantly induce nicotine biosynthesis in the ntjaz1deltac - gfp lines as compared with that in the ntjaz1 - gfp or non - transgenic control lines ( figure 8 ) .
these data indicate that ntjaz1deltac , as the dominant - negative form of ntjaz1 , suppresses ht - induced nicotine biosynthesis after ht treatment .
figure 8 overexpression of ntjaz1deltac results in the suppression of ht - induced nicotine biosynthesis .
three individual transgenic ntjaz1 - gfp and ntjaz1deltac - gfp plants were subjected to normal conditions or ht treatment , and the nicotine content in the roots was measured after 5 days of treatment .
data are the mean +/ - sd from triplicate experiments .
bars with different letters are significantly difference at p < 0.05 ( tukey 's test ) .
discussion ja signaling has multiple roles in the plant defense response against pathogen infection and insect attack and controls diverse developmental processes , such as stamen development , root growth , trichome formation , and secondary metabolism ( facchini , 2001 ; farmer et al. , 2003 ; yang et al. , 2012 ) .
recently , ja was reported to function in the plant response to abiotic stress ; for example , cold stress enhances arabidopsis tolerance to freezing stress by activating ja signaling and inducing the ice1 - cbf pathway ( hu et al. , 2013 ) .
in this study , we found that ht treatment obviously induced the accumulation of ja and ja - ile in tobacco root and that this effect was more striking than the effect of other stresses , such as cold , salinity , and heavy metal stress .
ja signaling is involved in nicotine biosynthesis in tobacco ( shoji et al. , 2008 ) .
in our experiment , we also found that ht induced nicotine accumulation and up - regulated ntpmt1 transcription and accumulation of its protein .
it is possible that ht - induced ja biosynthesis triggers nicotine biosynthesis , as pretreatment with the ja biosynthesis inhibitor dieca ( farmer et al. , 1994 ; hu et al. , 2003 ) markedly suppressed ht - induced nicotine biosynthesis , whereas the addition of exogenous meja promoted pmt1 accumulation and nicotine biosynthesis .
these observations support the notion that ht induces ja biosynthesis , which subsequently triggers nicotine biosynthesis .
in agreement with this , a previous study showed that silencing of ja signal receptor ntcoi1 , which blocks the ja signaling pathway in plants , suppresses ja - responsive nicotine biosynthesis in tobacco ( shoji et al. , 2008 ) .
it is possible that ja signal transduction also play the role in ht - induced nicotine biosynthesis .
thus , our data demonstrate that de novo ja biosynthesis is necessary for nicotine biosynthesis .
ntmy2a belongs to the basic helix - loop - helix transcriptional factor .
in tobacco , there are at least 23 bhlh subfamilies containing 190 bhlh genes were identified ( rushton et al. , 2008 ) .
the transcription factors ntmyc2a and ntmyc2b form nuclear complex with the ntjaz1 repressor to regulate nicotine biosynthesis ( zhang et al. , 2012 ) .
silencing of ntmyc2b in tobacco hairyroots strongly decreased transcript levels of jasmonate - responsive structural genes , including those involved in nicotine biosynthesis ( shoji and hashimoto , 2011 ) .
here we found that ht treatment increased the transcriptional level of ntmyc2a .
the chip experiments further confirmed that ntmyc2a can recognize and specifically bind the g - motif within the promoter region of ntlox , ntaos , ntaoc , and ntopr , all of which are the key genes associated with ja biosynthesis in tobacco .
ht treatment also increased the transcriptional levels of ntlox , ntaos , ntaoc , and ntopr , which agrees with the finding that ht induced ja and ja - ile accumulation .
it is possible that ht treatment increased the transcriptional levels of ntmyc2a , which then bound to the g - motif of ja biosynthesis - associated genes including ntaos , ntaoc , and ntopr to activate their expression , ultimately resulting in ja and ja - ile accumulation .
in arabidopsis , jazs function as important transcriptional repressors in the ja signaling response ( chini et al. , 2007 ) .
the jaz proteins contain the zim motif and the highly conserved jas motif , and most jazs are rapidly degraded by meja application , insect herbivory , and mechanical wounding in a coi1 - dependent and 26s proteasome - dependent manner ( steppuhn et al. , 2004 ; chung et al. , 2008 ) .
in tobacco , 12 members of jaz family have been identified in tobacco , these full - length ntjazs proteins could be clustered into five main subgroups by phylogenetic analysis ( oh et al. , 2012 ) .
ja signaling induces degradation of the ntjaz1 proteins , which stimulates nicotine biosynthesis , and this effect is abolished in transgenic coi1 - silenced tobacco plants ( shoji et al. , 2008 ) .
here , we found first that ht treatment accelerated the disappearance of gfp fluorescence and ntjaz1 - gfp degradation in the transgenic ntjaz1 - gfp line , an effect that could be blocked by mg132 .
second , the truncated form of ntjaz1deltac , which lacks the jas domain , showed resistance to ht - induced protein degradation in the transgenic ntjaz1deltac - gfp lines .
these data indicate that ntjazs are subjected to 26s proteasome - mediated degradation under ht treatment .
atjaz proteins can bind to and inactivate a set of transcription factors , such as atwrkys , atmycs , and atice1 , and the ja signal can activate these transcriptional factors ( hu et al. , 2003 ; zhang et al. , 2012 ; qi et al. , 2014 ) .
tobacco jaz proteins can be rapidly degraded after meja treatment , whereas the truncated form lacking jas motif did not .
transgenic plants expressing the non - degradable jaz form did not efficiently accumulate nicotine after meja treatment .
consistent with this , we found that ht induced the degradation of ntjaz1 - gfp in the transgenic ntjaz1 - gfp lines but did not induce the degradation of ntjaz1deltac - gfp in the transgenic ntjaz1deltac - gfp lines .
our in vivo luciferase activity analysis demonstrated that ntjaz1 suppressed ntmyc2a - induced ntpmt1 transcription and that this effect was reversed by ht treatment .
additionally , the transgenic expression of ntjaz1deltac suppressed ntpmt1 transcription , and this effect was not reversed by ht treatment .
as ht led to the efficient degradation of ntjaz1 , but not of ntjaz1deltac , which lacks the jas domain and is resistant to coi1 - dependent degradation , ht may disrupt the interaction between ntjaz1 and ntmyc2a to activate the expression of ntpmt1 and thereby nicotine biosynthesis .
in contrast , ht cannot disrupt ntmyc2a and ntjaz1deltac binding , thereby maintaining ntmyc2 in an inactive state .
in agreement with this , we found that the transgenic ntjaz1 - gfp and ntjaz1deltac - gfp lines produced lower levels of nicotine than the wild type under normal conditions , but that only the ntjaz1deltac - gfp line continued to exhibit reduced nicotine biosynthesis under ht treatment .
similar to the non - transgenic line , ht treatment also up - regulated ntpmt1 transcription and nicotine biosynthesis in the ntjaz1 - gfp line , as ht efficiently degraded ntjaz1 and thereby removed its inhibitory effect on ntmyc2a - induced ntpmt1 transcription .
in agreement with our results , a previous report showed that transgenic ntcoi1 - rnai , ntjaz1deltac - gus , and ntjaz3deltac - gus lines exhibited lower levels of ntpmt1 transcripts and of nicotine ( shoji et al. , 2008 ) .
to explain the molecular mechanism underlying ht - induced nicotine biosynthesis in tobacco , we propose the following simplified model ( figure 9 ) .
under normal conditions , the ntjaz1 repressors physically interact with ntmyc2a transcription factors , attenuating their transcriptional function and thereby repressing expression of downstream structural genes involved in nicotine biosynthesis .
however , ht stress induces the production of endogenous ja - ile , which is perceived by ntcoi1 as the key regulator in the jasmonate signaling pathway .
ntcoi1 then recruits ntjaz1 and mediates its degradation via the 26s proteasome pathway .
as a result , ntmyc2a is released and activates the expression of ntpmt1 and subsequently induces nicotine biosynthesis .
certainly , we cannot exclude other possible mechanisms in addition to coi1 - dependent jaz degradation , as the ability of jazs to bind mycs is also modulated by other factors , such as dellas ( qi et al. , 2014 ) .
furthermore , chromatin remodeling factor had6 and ethylene - responsive factor erf19 also influence the level of myc2a - induced ntpmt1 transcription ( shoji and hashimoto , 2011 ) .
taken together , our data reveal the novel molecular mechanism underlying nicotine biosynthesis in tobacco plants subjected to ht. figure 9 hypothetical model of the function of ntjaz1 and ntmyc2a in ht - induced nicotine biosynthesis .
under normal conditions , ntmyc2a forms a complex with the ntjaz1 repressor and ntmyc2a cannot bind to the promoter of ntpmt1 to activate its expression .
ht conditions induce ja biosynthesis to generate ja and ja - ile .
the presence of ja - ile promotes the interaction between jaz1 and coi1 to induce jaz1 degradation via the 26s proteasome .
as a result , free ntmyc2a is released to activate ntpmt1 expression by binding to the g - box element in the promoter region of ntpmt1 and induce nicotine biosynthesis .
meanwhile , high temperature also increased the level of myc2a transcripts , which bind the promoter regions of genes associated with ja biosynthesis to activate ja biosynthesis .
other transcriptional factors , such as erf , may be involved in this process to synergistically activate ntpmt1 transcription with ntmyc2c .

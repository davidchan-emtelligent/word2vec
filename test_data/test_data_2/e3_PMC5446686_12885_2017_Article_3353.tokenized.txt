background the role of irinotecan for elderly patients with ld - sclc has been unclear , and the timing of trt combined with chemotherapy has not been fully evaluated .
methods patients aged > 70 years with untreated , measurable , ld - sclc , performance status ( ps ) 0 - 2 , and adequate organ function were eligible .
treatment consisted of induction with carboplatin on day 1 and irinotecan on days 1 and 8 , every 21 days for 4 cycles , and sequential trt ( 54gy in 27 fractions ) .
carboplatin doses were based on auc of 4 and 5 ( levels 1 and 2 , respectively ) , with a fixed irinotecan dose ( 50 mg / m2 ) .
primary objective of the phase ii study was overall responce rate .
results forty - three patients were enrolled and forty - one were finally analyzed ( median age : 75 years [ range 70 - 86 years ) ; males 31 ; ps 0 / 1 / 2 , n = 22 / 18 / 1 ] .
two patients were excluded because of protocol violation ( ascertained to be extensive disease ) .
twelve patients were accrued at phase i and the number of patients with carboplatin dose - limiting toxicities at levels - 1 ( n = 6 ) and - 2 ( n = 6 ) were 1 ( grade 3 hypertension ) and 2 ( grade 4 thrombocytopenia ) , respectively .
the phase ii trial was expanded to 29 additional patients receiving the level 1 carboplatin dose , total of 35 patients .
the median number of chemotherapy cycles was 4 ( range 1 - 4 ) , and the median radiation dose was 54gy ( range 36 - 60 ) .
toxicities were generally mild .
there were 4 complete and 27 partial responses ( response rate 88.6 %). with a median follow - up of 52 months , the median progression - free and overall survival times of phase ii were 11.2 and 27.1 months , respectively .
conclusions induction chemotherapy of carboplatin plus irinotecan and sequential trt was well tolerated and effective for elderly patients with ld - sclc .
additional confirmatory studies are warranted .

keywords ld - sclc irinotecan sequential radiotherapy elderly carboplatin phase i phase ii noneissue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background approximately 30 % to 40 % of patients with small - cell lung cancer ( sclc ) are older than 70 years , and in japan , the proportion of sclc patients who are elderly is increasing [ 1 - 3 ] .
however , because this population of elderly patients is frequently excluded from clinical trials , there is no established standard chemotherapeutic regimen for elderly patients with sclc .
to the best of our knowledge , there have not been any randomized control trials for elderly patients with ld - sclc , and we could only find several small phase ii studies that enrolled these patients [ 4 - 7 ] .
concurrent chemoradiotherapy , which is standard for younger patients , might be effective ; but because of the risk of a higher degree of toxicity for even " extremely healthy elderly patients " , we supposed that induction chemotherapy plus sequential radiotherapy would be more suitable for most elderly patients .
the japan clinical oncology group ( jcog ) conducted a randomized control trial comparing cisplatin plus irinotecan ( ip regimen ) with cisplatin plus etoposide ( ep regimen ) for extensive disease ( ed ) - sclc patients aged <= 70 years [ 8 ] .
the trial was terminated at the interim analysis because ip provided significantly better overall survival ( os ) than ep. however , subsequent trials [ 9 - 13 ] did not confirm that ip improved survival over ep. nevertheless , the standard regimen was changed in japan to ip for patients with ed - sclc who were aged <= 70 years .
these results suggested that irinotecan - based chemotherapy should be reasonable for elderly japanese patients with sclc .
since cisplatin - based chemotherapy might be harmful for elderly patients with sclc and comorbidities , carboplatin might be an appropriate alternative option .
rossi et al. reported a meta - analysis that showed that cisplatin and carboplatin for sclc had different toxicity profiles , and the difference between the efficacy of the 2 agents was not statistically significant [ 13 ] .
therefore , the use of a carboplatin - based regimen for elderly patients with sclc might be also reasonable .
according to meta - analyses [ 14 , 15 ] , concurrent chemoradiotherapy is more effective for patients with ld - sclc than induction chemotherapy and sequential radiotherapy .
however , some studies have found that the use of irinotecan for concurrent chemoradiotherapy led to unacceptable toxicities [ 16 , 17 ] .
to avoid the severe toxicity induced by thoracic radiation , a protocol consisting of carboplatin plus irinotecan induction therapy and sequential radiotherapy may be worth considering , because it addresses both safety and efficacy .
in this phase i / ii clinical study , we evaluated the efficacy of irinotecan for elderly ld - sclc patients , as well as investigated its potential for a future phase iii study .
methods patient eligibility patients were registered at the central data center where the following eligibility criteria were confirmed : cytologically or histologically confirmed sclc ; age 70 years or older ; ld , defined as disease confined to a single hemithorax ( including ipsilateral and contralateral supraclavicular nodes and <= 1 - cm of ipsilateral pleural effusion as measured by computed tomography ( ct ) without malignant cells ) ; no prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for sclc ; eastern cooperative oncology group ( ecog ) performance status ( ps ) of 0 - 2 ; at least 1 measurable target lesion ; no prior history of systemic chemotherapy for another cancer .
the criteria for adequate organ function included : white blood cell ( wbc ) count >= 4000 / mul , neutrophil count >= 2000 / mul , platelet count >= 100,000 / mul , hemoglobin level >= 9.0 g / dl , serum aspirate aminotransferase ( ast ) and alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) concentrations <= 2.0x upper limit of normal ( uln ) , creatinine level <= 1.5 mg / dl , creatinine clearance >= 40 ml / min , and arterial oxygen pressure >= 70 torr .
patients were excluded from the study if they had either interstitial pneumonia or pulmonary fibrosis on chest radiography , or any severe concomitant disease ( severe cardiac disease , severe infection , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , severe hepatic disorder , active bleeding ) .
written informed consent was obtained from every patient .
the protocol was approved by the institutional review committee of each of the participating institutions .
evaluation for enrollment all patients were required to undergo ct of the thorax and the upper abdomen , either ct or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the brain , and either a radioisotopic bone scan or positron emission tomography ( pet ) for assessing disease stage .
a complete blood cell count and a blood chemistry panel were also obtained at enrollment .
after the treatment protocol was started , chest radiography was performed at least 1 time per chemotherapy cycle , and blood testing was performed every week .
ct was repeated every 2 cycles to evaluate the target lesions .
tumor response was assessed using the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.0 , and toxicity was assessed using the national cancer institute common terminology criteria for adverse events , version 3.0 .
phase i section the primary endpoint for the phase i trial was to determine the recommended dose ( rd ) .
based on a previous study [ 14 ] , the following dose levels of irinotecan were evaluated : level 1 , 50 mg / m2 of irinotecan intravenously ( iv ) on days 1 and 8 plus carboplatin iv with a dose based on the area under the curve ( auc ) of 4 on day 1 ; level 2 , 50 mg / m2 of irinotecan iv on days 1 and 8 plus carboplatin auc 5 on day 1 .
irinotecan was not administered on day 8 for wbc < 3000 / mm3 , platelet count < 100,000 / mm3 , or if diarrhea of grade 1 or higher occurred .
when the toxicities did not recover until 3 days ahead of planned day 8 , the day 8 irinotecan administration was withdrawn .
chemotherapy was repeated for up to 4 cycles , unless disease progression was observed or there was unacceptable toxicity .
however , termination of the chemotherapy protocol and initiation of radiotherapy was permitted if the response after the second chemotherapy cycle was stable disease .
a treatment delay of up to 2 weeks was permitted .
granulocyte colony - stimulating growth factor ( g - csf ) could be used in accordance with the package insert .
if g - csf was administered , the criteria for administering the next chemotherapy cycle should be satisfied both after day 21 and 2 or more days after the discontinuation of g - csf .
antiemetic prophylaxis with 5 - ht3 receptor antagonists plus dexamethasone was routinely used .
dose modification was only allowed for the level 2 cohort of patients , as follows : grade 4 leukopenia or neutropenia lasting 4 days or more ; grade 4 thrombocytopenia ; or grade 3 non - hematological toxicities , except for nausea / vomiting , anorexia , hyponatremia , and creatinine elevation .
when dose modification was needed , the next treatment cycle was started with carboplatin auc 4 on day 1 plus irinotecan 40 mg / m2 on days 1 and 8 every 21 days .
when level 1 patients developed toxicity to these modified doses , the chemotherapy protocol was terminated .
likewise , when level 2 patients developed similar toxicity again after dose modification , the chemotherapy protocol was terminated .
the dose level was escalated based on the development of toxicity during chemotherapy cycles and was not escalated for each patient .
dose limiting toxicity ( dlt ) was considered to be any of the following adverse events observed during the initial 2 chemotherapy cycles : grade 4 thrombocytopenia ; grade 4 febrile neutropenia ; grade 4 neutropenia or leucopenia for >= 4 days ; grade 3 nonhematological toxicity ( except for nausea / vomiting , hyponatremia , and creatinine elevation ) ; and delay of the next cycle for >= 14 days .
the dose escalation schematic is shown in fig. 1 ; if 1 or zero of the initial 6 patients receiving level 1 chemotherapy developed dlt , then 6 patients received level 2 treatment .
if 1 or zero of the 6 patients receiving level 2 chemotherapy developed dlt , the dose was considered to be the rd. if 2 or more of the patients receiving level 2 chemotherapy developed dlt , level 1 was considered to be the rd. if 2 or more of the initial 6 patients receiving level 1 chemotherapy developed dlt , the rd could not be defined , and no phase ii trial would be conducted .
dlt was monitored until the end of the first 2 chemotherapy cycles. fig. 1 dose escalation schematic of phase i phase ii section and statistical analysis the primary endpoint of the phase ii study was the overall response rate ( orr ) .
based on the simon two - stage design , the phase ii trial was designed to detect the difference between orrs of 0.60 and 0.80 with more than 80 % power ( exact binomial test for one sample proportion , 1 - sided ˛ = 0.05 ) .
thirteen patients , including those who received the rd in the phase i trial , were enrolled in an interim analysis , and the new regimen was considered worthy of further investigation if tumor response was observed in >= 9 patients .
for the phase ii study , an additional 22 patients were enrolled ; and the total number of patients in the phase ii trial was 35 .
the secondary endpoints were os , progression - free survival ( pfs ) , toxicity , and rate of treatment completion .
the patient cohort completing treatment was considered to be those patients who received both 2 cycles of protocol chemotherapy and >= 50 gy of thoracic radiotherapy ( trt ) .
the kaplan - meier method was used to estimate the median values of time - to - events , such as os and pfs ; and the confidence intervals ( cis ) were calculated using the brookmeyer and crowley method .
all statistical analyses were performed using bellcurve for excel ( social survey research information , tokyo , japan ) .
thoracic radiotherapy trt was begun on day 22 of the fourth chemotherapy cycle and was administered at 2gy / day for 5 consecutive days / week for a total of 54 gy. postchemotherapy treatment volumes were used for radiotherapy .
every patient underwent three - dimensional conformal radiation therapy ( 3d - crt ) planning .
the dose constraints for the lung were a mean lung dose ( mld ) < 20 gy and a v20 of 35 % or less .
the target volume included the lung tumor and involved lymph nodes , with margins of 1.0 - 1.5 cm. the maximum dose to the spinal cord was 40 gy. to guarantee the intensity of radiotherapy , the total duration of trt was <= 56 days .
thoracic radiotherapy alone without the use of chemotherapy was permitted on day 22 of the second chemotherapy cycle if tumor response was not obtained .
the initiation of trt was permitted only for patients with the following clinical parameters : wbc >= 2000 / mm3 , pao2 >= 65 torr on room air , ps = 0 - 2 , and no interstitial pneumonia or pulmonary fibrosis on chest radiography .
trt was suspended when the patient developed 1 or more of the following : grade 3 nonhematological toxicities : ps of 3 - 4 , grade >= 2 pneumonitis , temperature >= 38 degreesc , or grade >= 2 hypoxemia with pao2 decrease of 10 torr .
thoracic radiotherapy was restarted if there was improvement , but antifebrile agents within 24 h of trt were not allowed .
the trt protocol was terminated for grade >= 3 pneumonitis or if trt had been suspended for 14 days because of the other toxicities .
treatment after protocol antitumor treatment was permitted after the protocol when the tumor was confirmed to be progressive disease .
patients who achieved a complete response ( cr ) could receive prophylactic cranial irradiation ( pci ) , but pci was not mandatory .
results forty - three patients were enrolled from december 2006 through june 2013 at 12 institutions .
thirty - seven patients , which included 6 patients from the phase i trial who were treated with the rd level , were enrolled in the phase ii trial ( 2 patients were found to have ed - sclc after registration and were excluded from the analysis ) .
the median age of all eligible patients in the study was 75 years ( range , 70 - 86 years ) .
only one patient had an ecog ps of 2 ; 10 patients had n3 disease ( table 1 ) .

at level 2 , 2 of 6 patients developed a dlt of grade 4 thrombocytopenia .
moreover , 1 patient with grade 4 thrombocytopenia also developed grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 glaucoma .

trt dose and trt toxicity during the phase ii trial the trt doses ranged from 36 to 60 gy , and 25 patients ( 71.4 %) received the planned dose of 54 gy. one patient terminated trt because of disease progression .
the toxicities that occurred during trt are summarized in table 3 .
grade 3 radiation pneumonitis was observed in 2 ( 5.7 %) patients , one receiving a total trt dose of 44 gy and the other receiving 54 gy. the treatment was terminated , and each patient was treated with systemic corticosteroids .
both patients achieved complete recovery ; no tumor progression had been detected by the time of last follow up. treatment completion of the 35 patients in the phase ii study , 29 ( 82.9 %) received 2 or more cycles of protocol chemotherapy and trt >= 50 gy. follow up after the phase ii study seven ( 20 %) of 35 patients underwent pci .
twenty - three patients ( 66 %) developed recurrence , and 18 patients received other systemic chemotherapy .
five patients ( 14 %) underwent brain radiotherapy .
the first sites of recurrence were primarily distant metastases ( central nervous system : n = 11 ; others : n = 12 ) , and no obvious tendency was observed .
eleven patients developed locoregional recurrence in the trt field , and 4 of these also developed distant metastasis .
two patients died of another disease without confirmation of relapse , and the others died of sclc progression .
progression - free and overall survival the median pfs of all 41 patients was 10.8 months ( 95 % ci , 9.3 - 12.3 months ) .
the median pfs of the phase ii trial was 11.2 months ( 95 % ci , 8.5 - 13.8 , months ; fig. 2 ) .
the median os of all 41 patients was 25.3 months ( 95 % ci , 18.0 - 32.6 months ) .
the median os of the phase ii trial was 27.1 months ( 95 % ci , 17.0 - 37.2 months ; fig. 3 ) .
the median duration of follow up of patients in the phase ii trial was 52 months. fig. 2 progression - free survival fig. 3 overall survival discussion based on several reports , the standard treatment for patients with ld - sclc is concurrent chemoradiotherapy , regardless of the age of the patient [ 18 ] .
however , concurrent chemotherapy is sometimes too toxic for fragile elderly patients , even if they are otherwise suitable for antitumor treatment .
individualized treatment for patients with sclc has not yet been developed .
therefore , a treatment regimen that is applicable for most elderly patients is needed , especially in countries that have an aging population , such as japan .
some studies have found that irinotecan is effective for elderly patients with sclc .
we recently reported the results of 2 clinical trials that examined the efficacy and toxicity of ci regimen for sclc , and found that the ci regimen appeared to have promise for the treatment of sclc [ 19 , 20 ] .
moreover , other investigators also found that ci regimens showed acceptable activity and toxicity for patients with sclc , not only for elderly but also younger patients [ 21 - 23 ] .
schmittel et al. conducted a randomized phase iii trial to compare ci with carboplatin plus etoposide ( ce regimen ) for the treatment of patients with ed - sclc [ 21 ] .
although this trial failed to show the superiority of irinotecan over etoposide in combination with carboplatin with regard to pfs as the primary endpoint , os was marginally better with the ci regimen .
another study that compared ci with ce for ed - sclc was conducted in norway [ 22 ] .
the primary endpoint of os was significantly better in the ci arm , which also obtained slightly better quality of life ( qol ) .
we conducted a safety and efficacy phase i / ii study of the ci regimen and sequential trt .
the results were generally acceptable , and not inferior to previous studies of elderly patients [ 24 , 25 ] .
several long - term survivors were observed despite the increased mean age of the study cohort .
the estimated 5 - year survival rate of 30 % was very promising ( table 4 ) .
however , our study required a long enrollment period because there were few patients with ld - sclc who had adequate organ function for the treatment used in our study .

all the patients with grade - 3 or higher adverse events generally improved , and there were no treatment - related deaths .
most patients with sclc have a history of cumulative smoking exposure , which leads to increased frailty [ 26 , 27 ] .
therefore , the recruitment of elderly sclc patients for chemoradiotherapy is generally difficult .
nevertheless , our study protocol achieved good efficacy and acceptable toxicity .
in addition , the survival results were not inferior to the results from a recent study of younger patients with ld - sclc [ 28 , 29 ] .
although some patients had to terminate chemotherapy , all of the study patients achieved sufficient recovery from adverse effects , so that they could undergo sequential trt .
irinotecan sometimes causes severe diarrhea or interstitial pneumonitis in patients with sclc .
however , our study patients with diarrhea generally had a mild and manageable course , which might be attributed to the use of a dose of irinotecan that was lower than the standard dose for sclc .
according to the tolerability data from the phase ii study , we believe that treatment using the level 2 dose would not be suitable for rd. we previously administered the same chemotherapy ( level 1 of this protocol ) to elderly ed - sclc patients , and 7 patients ( 70 %) required treatment delays of >= 7 days because of grade 3 neutropenia or grade 3 thrombocytopenia [ 20 ] .
although the patients had ed - sclc , the other eligibility criteria of their study were similar to those in our study .
although the standard therapy for ld - sclc is " concurrent chemoradiotherapy " , we used sequential trt in this study .
several meta - analyses [ 15 , 30 - 32 ] reported that early initiation of trt was advantageous , but we were concerned that concurrent radiotherapy would lead to severe toxicities in this study cohort of frail patients .
syukuya et al. reported that they selected only 5 of 20 elderly (>= 75 years ) patients with ld - sclc to receive concurrent trt [ 33 ] .
elderly patients with ld - sclc tend to have a history of heavy smoking and many comorbidities , so their decision to only enroll 5 patients for concurrent chemo radiotherapy was based on the frailty of their patients .
moreover , 2 of their 5 elderly patients ( 40 %) who received concurrent trt terminated treatment because of severe toxicity .
the results of their study indicated that the safety of treatments for most elderly patients with ld - sclc is of particular concern .
okamoto et al. reported that the first cycle of the ep regimen plus concurrent trt for elderly patients with ld - sclc led to a high frequency of febrile neutropenia ( 8 of 12 ) [ 19 ] .
we do not rule out the use of concurrent trt , but we would not generally consider using it for elderly ld - sclc patients .
in our study , the dose intensity of trt was generally satisfactory , and few patients developed severe pneumonitis and esophagitis .
the sequential trt field was usually restricted because of tumor shrinkage due to induction chemotherapy .
the smaller field might have accounted for the reduced rate in our patients of severe toxicities due to trt .
the japanese jcog 0202 study was published while our study was ongoing [ 29 ] .
the investigators compared ip with ep , using concurrent trt , for patients with ld - sclc aged 20 - 70 years .
they anticipated that the ip regimen would be superior , but the os ( primary endpoint ) of patients receiving ip was not improved over ep. the results of their study cast doubt on the superiority of irinotecan over etoposide ; however , results of another study have supported the superiority of irinotecan [ 34 ] .
additional trials that compare these 2 agents are needed .
there are several limitations to this study .
it was not a comparative study , had a small phase ii component , and no results allowed us to make a conclusion regarding the superiority of the ci regimen .
the radiation fields for sequential trt might have accounted for the lower incidence of trt toxicity ; whether or not sequential trt might have been the best strategy for managing the disease is unclear .
in addition , because the toxicities in phase ii were generally mild , an rd midway between levels 1 and 2 might be better for phase ii. although this study allowed the inclusion of patients with a ps of 2 , only 1 such patient was enrolled .
therefore , we could not clearly show the efficacy and safety for patients with a ps of 2 .
moreover , we enrolled 43 patients from 12 institutions , all of whom had an ecog ps of 0 - 2 .
considering the very small number of average patients per institute , there seems to have been great heterogeneity based on institutions , and it might be difficult to popularize in general .
finally , we could not easily determine if the patients included in our study could safely receive cisplatin based regimens .
a meta - analysis found that there was no significant difference between the efficacy of cisplatin and of carboplatin for the treatment of sclc [ 13 ] , so we considered it was not suboptimal treatment .
conclusions induction chemotherapy consisting of a ci regimen and sequential trt was well tolerated and effective for elderly patients with ld - sclc .
further confirmatory studies are warranted .

genome sequencing of the yellow - pigmented , thermophilic bacterium thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 resulted in a 2.29 mb draft genome that encodes for 2312 proteins .
the genetic relationship between various strains from the genus thermus was assessed based on phylogenomic analyses using a concatenated set of conserved proteins .
the resulting phylogenetic tree illustrated that thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 clusters together with thermus scotoductus sa - 01 , despite being isolated from vastly different geographical locations .
the close evolutionary relationship and metabolic parallels between the two strains has previously been recognized ; however , neither strain 's genome data were available at that point in time .
genomic comparison of the thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 and t. scotoductus sa - 01 , as well as other closely related thermus strains , revealed a high degree of synteny at both the genomic and proteomic level , with processes such as denitrification and natural cell competence appearing to be conserved .
however , despite this high level of similarity , analysis revealed a complete , putative calvin - benson - bassham ( cbb ) cycle in nmx2.a1 that is absent in sa - 01 .
analysis of horizontally transferred gene islands provide evidence that nmx2 selected these genes due to pressure from its hco3 - rich environment , which is in stark contrast to that of the deep subsurface isolated sa - 01 .
thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 thermus scotoductus sa - 01 genome roche 454 comparison calvin - benson - bassham the rapid growth in the number of completely sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes has made the field of comparative genomics more feasible than ever .
this , in turn , has started to highlight the importance of studying the microevolutionary relationships between closely related genomes .
microevolutionary processes are central to our understanding of the mechanisms of evolution , specifically the differential effects of selection on different types of genomic sequences ( jordan et al. 2002 ) .
databases contain multiple sets of closely related genomes from the genus thermus for microevolutionary studies ( chung et al. 2000 ; bricio et al. 2011 ) .
especially relevant to this study are the strains thermus sp. nmx2 .
a.1 and t. scotoductus sa - 01 .
these two strains , isolated from a hot spring in new mexico and a deep gold mine in south africa , respectively , share high 16s rrna gene sequence similarity (> 98 %) in spite of their vast geographical separation ( hudson et al. 1989 ; kieft et al. 1999 ) .
furthermore , kieft et al .
( 1999 ) showed that the two strains displayed distinct metabolic similarities : both strains were able to grow on lactate with o2 , no3 - , mn ( iv ) , s0 , and fe ( iii ) - nta as terminal electron acceptors and both grew optimally at ~ 65degrees ( ph 6.5 - 7.0 ) .
dissimilatory reduction of iron ( bester et al. 2010 ) and other metals by unique protein functionalities ( opperman and van heerden 2007 ; cason et al .
2012 ) in these two thermus strains is unusual within this genus , thus prompting further microevolutionary studies .
the genome of t. scotoductus sa - 01 was recently fully sequenced and assembled ( gounder et al. 2011 ) .
along with the genome sequence of thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 , presented in this paper , an opportunity now exists to identify the genetic differences between these metabolically similar strains , as well as other available thermus genomes .
in the present study we illustrate that , despite the genomic similarities of t. scotoductus sa - 01 and thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 , they do harbor unexplored species differences when compared to each other as well as with other members of the genus thermus .
the most striking differences were observed when comparing the genes of the putative cbb cycle .
materials and methods genome sequence and annotation thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 was generously provided by prof. t. l. kieft ( new mexico tech ) ( hudson et al. 1989 ) .
cell mass for dna isolation was obtained by aerobic culture in attc medium 697 ( 4 g / l yeast extract , 8 g / l peptone , and 2 g / l nacl ; ph 7.5 ) at 68degrees .
the bacterial strain was verified by 16s rrna gene sequencing and comparing it to the deposited genbank sequence ( accession number l09661.1 ) .
genomic dna of thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 was sequenced by gatc biotech using a 1 / 4 flx plate , providing an approximate 87 - fold coverage .
de novo assembly was performed using the roche 454 newbler software .
annotation was performed using the ncbi prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline ( released 2013 ) .
identification and analysis of horizontally acquired genomic islands identification of genomic islands in concatenated contigs was performed using seqword gene island sniffer ( swgis ) ( bezuidt et al. 2009 ) .
genomic islands sharing dna sequence similarities were searched by blastn through the pre _ gi database ( pierneef et al. 2015 ) .
phylogenomic inference complete genome sequences of thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 strain was compared against complete genomes of 10 reference thermus / meiothermus strains ( t. scotoductus sa - 01 , t. igniterrae attc 700962 , thermus sp. cbb us3 uf1 , t. aquaticus y51mc23 , thermus sp. rl , t. thermophilus hb27 , t. thermophilus hb8 , t. oshimai jl - 2 , m. ruber dsm 1279 , and m. silvanus dsm 9946 ) .
blastp search revealed 1389 clusters of orthologous proteins shared by all these organisms .
all protein sequences were aligned by muscle and each alignment was edited by gblocks ( talavera and castresana 2007 ) .
the resulting edited alignments were concatenated into an artificial amino acid superalignment of 377,241 residues .
a phylogenetic tree was inferred by the neighbor - joining algorithm implemented in mega 6.0 ( tamura et al. 2013 ) .
homologous protein phylogenetic tree three sequential orthologous sequences from the cbb cycle from thermus spp. were manually concatenated into an artificial amino acid sequence .
the selected proteins were : ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain ( ec 4.1.1.39 ) , ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain ( ec 4.1.1.39 ) , and the fructose - 1,6 - bisphosphate , glpx type ( ec 3.1.3.11 ) .

nmx2.a1 , and thermus sp. yim 77409 .
a phylogenetic tree was inferred by the neighbor - joining algorithm implemented in mega 6.0 using paracoccus yeei atcc baa - 599 as an outlier group ( tamura et al. 2013 ) .
chromosomal alignment contigs obtained from the de novo assembly were aligned and ordered with mauve by using the t. scotoductus sa - 01 chromosome as template ( darling et al. 2004 ) .

the bidirectional best hits were selected using the proteome comparison tool in patric ( https :// www.patricbrc.org ) ( wattam et al. 2014 ) .
pathway genome database construction a pathway genome database ( pgdb ) was constructed using the pathologic module of the pathway tools software ( http :// brg.ai.sri.com / ptools /) ( karp 2001 ; karp et al. 2002 ) .
genes and proteins were imported into pathologic from the annotated genome sequences in genbank file format and metacyc ( caspi et al. 2014 ) was selected as the reference pathway database .

taxonomic position of thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 the resulting 1389 clusters of orthologous proteins from the blastp search over available thermus and meiothermus genomes were used in muscle alignments .
the muscle alignments were concatenated into a superalignment of 377,241 amino acid residues and this alignment was used to construct a neighbor - joining phylogenetic tree in mega 6.0 .
the resulting phylogenetic tree ( figure 1 ) illustrates that thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 clusters together with t. scotoductus sa - 01 , which was the closest species in terms of phylogeny .
the close evolutionary relationship and metabolic parallels between the two strains has previously been recognized , despite the fact that neither strain 's genome data were available at that point in time ( kieft et al. 1999 ; balkwill et al. 2004 ) .

nmx2 a.1 comprises 132 contigs ( genbank accession number : atni00000000.1 ) .
mauve was used to order the contigs of the thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 using the chromosome of t. scotoductus sa - 01 as the template ( figure 2 ) .

there are many similarities between t. scotoductus sa - 01 ( a ) and thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 ( b ) .
the boundaries of the different colored blocks indicate break points in the chromosomes while the vertical red lines indicate contig boundaries .
a high degree of synteny is observed .
additionally , the red blocks in the depiction of the t. scotoductus sa - 01 chromosome indicate genomic islands acquired by horizontal gene transfer ( gounder et al .
2011 ) , which were absent in the contigs of the genome of thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 .
finally , thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 also has genes ( toward the extreme right of the thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 depiction ) which are not present within the t. scotoductus sa - 01 chromosome .
these may be either genomic islands acquired by thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 or the genes that were lost by sa - 01 after separation of the two lines from the common ancestor ( gounder et al. 2011 ) .
the bidirectional blast ( bi - di blast ) results ( supplemental material , table s1 ) indicate the comparison of the forward and reverse orfs of thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 against the selected related strains .
an inspection of table s1 shows that thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 is highly similar to t. scotoductus sa - 01 , as already illustrated by mauve and phylogenetic analysis ( see figure 1 and figure 2 ) .
a total of 1153 genes are shared by all the thermus strains used in the analysis .
thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 contains unique genes not present in any of the other thermus strains used in the analysis .
all the genes ( 54 in total ) that were unique to thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 were annotated as hypothetical proteins , except for a nitrate abc transporter ( tnmx _ 11560 ). of special interest are 12 orfs ( tnmx _ 12205 to tnmx _ rs11770 ) that form a gene cluster encoding for putative enzyme homologs of the cbb pathway ( figure s2 ) .
although these cbb genes were identified in other thermus strains , it was surprisingly not observed in the closely related t. scotoductus sa - 01 .
a search for horizontally transferred genomic islands using swgis predicted only one genomic island of seven hypothetical genes in the contig 123 .
dna similarity search through pre _ gi revealed similar genes in the genomic island # 2 in the genome of cellvibrio gilvus atcc 13127 ( nc _ 015671 ) .
in the latter genome , all these genes were annotated as heavy metal translocation proteins .
finding only one genomic island was unexpected as 8.3 % of the orfs in thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 had no homologs in the ncbi nonredundant database .
however , it is known that thermus organisms are prone to exchange of genetic material by uptake of naked dna molecules from the environment , especially the genes of closely related bacteria of themus / meiothermus ( kumwenda et al. 2014 ) .
it is possible that the prediction methods did not detect putative alien genes because the genome was only partially assembled or because of amelioration if the genes were acquired a long time ago .
genes involved in dna uptake some thermus strains have been shown to possess natural competence and are able to take up both linear and circular dna with high efficiency ( friedrich et al. 2003 ; murugapiran et al. 2013 ) .
this was also demonstrated for t. scotoductus sa - 01 ( gounder et al. 2011 ) .
thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 , just like t. scotoductus sa - 01 , contains all the homologs of dna transport genes , suggesting that thermus sp .
nmx2 a.1 is naturally competent .
these include the genes that encode homologs for : pilc ( tnmx _ 02375 ) , pild ( tnmx _ 02985 ) , pilf ( tnmx _ 03090 ) , pilm ( tnmx _ 08400 ) , piln ( tnmx _ 08405 ) , pilo ( tnmx _ 08410 ) , pilq ( tnmx _ 08420 ) , and pilw ( tnmx _ 08415 ) .
similar to t. scotoductus sa - 01 , the nmx2.a1 - strain does not contain the gene encoding for pila , which is present in t. thermophilus hb27 ( gounder et al. 2011 ) .
in addition , genes encoding for homologs of competence proteins comea ( tnmx _ 10095 ) , comec ( tnmx _ 10100 ) , comf ( tnmx _ 06510 ) , dpra ( tnmx _ 09235 ) , and fima ( tnmx _ 04555 ) were also identified in thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 .
bi - di blast analyses of 17 sequenced thermus genomes also revealed that the majority of genes involved with dna uptake are present in all 17 genomes .
twelve of these dna uptake genes share at least a 75 % protein identity across all the above - mentioned genomes .
when surveying the core proteome ( 75 % protein identity cut off for all proteins ) of the 17 strains , the proteins responsible for natural competence are present .
this indicates that natural competence in the thermus genus is strongly conserved and will undoubtedly afford these bacteria the opportunity to potentially expand their metabolic repertoire .
genes involved in denitrification several studies have illustrated the partial denitrification pathways in different strains of thermus ( cava et al. 2008 ; gounder et al. 2011 ; murugapiran et al. 2013 ; paraiso and hedlund 2013 ; alvarez et al. 2014 ) .
in most thermus strains , the genes required in the first step of the denitrification process ( reducing nitrate to nitrite ) are encoded on a self - transferable dna element called the nitrate respiration conjugation element ( nce ) .
the nce encodes the complete nitrate respiratory apparatus comprising two hetero - tetrameric enzymes , nrc and nar , as well as the regulatory components required for their expression under anoxic conditions in the presence of nitrate ( cava and berenguer 2006 ) .
like a large number of thermus strains , thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 also displays a truncated denitrification phenotype , terminating in the production of nitrous oxide instead of dinitrogen .
this is probably due to the absence of a periplasmic nitrous oxide reductase ( nosz ) ( gounder et al. 2011 ; murugapiran et al. 2013 ; alvarez et al. 2014 ) .
bi - di blast analyses revealed that thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 , like the very closely related t. scotoductus sa - 1 , possesses a complete nar operon ( narghjikt ) with high sequence identity between the two operons (> 90 %) .
seven other thermus strains [ t. igniterrae atcc700962 , both t. oshimai strains ( dsm12092 and jl - 2 ) , t. antranikianii , t. thermophilus yim77409 , thermus sp 2.9 , and two strains of t. scotoductus ( dsm8553 and dsm21543 )] all have complete nar operons with similarly high sequence identities ( all > 75 %) when compared to thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 .
all 17 strains' genomes encode for the membrane - bound nitrate reductase narg catalytic subunit homolog that is responsible for nitrate reduction , but with varying sequence identities in comparison to the thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 narg ( tmnx _ 11710 ) ( cava et al. 2008 ; alvarez et al. 2014 ) .
all 17 strains also contain the narc homolog , a cytochrome c - containing nitrate reductase that allows the transfer of electrons from menaquinol to extracellular acceptors when intracellular nitrate becomes scarce ( cava et al. 2008 ; alvarez et al. 2014 ) .
genes encoding homologs of nitrite respiration proteins nird ( large subunit ) and nirj appear to be present in all 17 sequenced genomes , including nmx2.a1 , albeit differently dispersed among the strains .
strikingly , the small subunit of nird is only found in thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 ( tnmx _ 11570 ) and t. thermophilus sg0.5jp17 - 16 , albeit with a low sequence identity of 32 % .
delta - blast using tnmx _ 11570 as the query indicated that the closest match ( 68 % identity ) was with a protein containing a rossman fold nad ( p )+ binding site from deinococcus deserti .
interestingly , the simultaneous presence of homologs of cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase ( nirs ) and copper nitrite reductase ( nirk ) could only be found in t. oshimai jl - 2 and dsm12092 , t. scotoductus sa - 01 , and thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 .
the reduction of nitrite in bacteria is performed by either nirk or nirs , but not both ( murugapiran et al. 2013 ) .
thus , the presence of both nirs and nirk homologs in the above - mentioned denitrificant thermus strains is exceptional ( gounder et al. 2011 ; alvarez et al. 2014 ) .
as previously mentioned , thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 displayed an incomplete denitrification phenotype that terminated with the formation of nitrous oxide .
the formation of nitrous oxide from nitric oxide is facilitated by a heterotrimeric nitric oxide reductase ( large subunit norb and two small subunits norc and norh ) .
norb , norc , and norh are present in thermus sp .
nmx2a.1 ( tnmx _ 05775 , tmnx _ 05780 , and tnmx _ 05770 ) as well as t. thermophilus ( strains jl - 18 , sg0.5jp17 - 16 , and yim77409 ) , thermus sp .
2.9 , t. scotoductus sa - 01 , and both strains of t. oshimai ( jl - 2 and dsm12092 ) .
the current genome data of sequenced thermus strains highlight the variability of denitrification and that incomplete denitrification pathways appear to be common phenotypes in thermus .
given the fact that thermus is naturally competent , the variability in denitrification phenotype is indicative of a dispensable thermus genome .
genes involved with pigment metabolism a common characteristic of several thermus strains is their yellow pigmentation due to beta - carotene biosynthesis .
beta - carotene and its hydroxylated products have been implicated in membrane stability and dna protection from uv - radiation in thermus ( yokoyama et al. 1995 ; tian and hua 2010 ) .
it is now known that the initial oxidized products of beta - carotene in thermus are produced with the aid of a cytochrome p450 monooxygense ( cyp450 ) ( momoi et al. 2006 ) .
bi - di blast analyses showed that 15 out of the 17 strains had a cyp450 homolog ; only t. scotoductus strains sa - 01 and dsm8553 ( also known as strain se - 1 ) did not possess a cyp450 homolog .
this result seems plausible given where these strains were isolated : the sa - 01 strain was isolated in a mine 3.2 km below the surface ( kieft et al .
1999 ) and strain dsm8553 was isolated from tap water ( kristjansson et al. 1994 ) .
the native electron transport system for cyp175a1 in t. thermophilus hb27 , namely a ferredoxin nad ( p )+ reductase and [ 3fe - 4s ] , [ 4fe - 4s ] ferredoxin has been described and shown to effectively shuttle electrons to cyp175a1 to catalyze the hydroxylation of beta - carotene ( mandai et al. 2009 ) .
thermus sp .
nmx2a.1 possesses homologs of [ 3fe - 4s ] , [ 4fe - 4s ] ferredoxin ( tnmx _ 07470 ) , and ferredoxin nad ( p )+ reductase ( locus tag : tnmx _ 01055 ) proteins that display 99 % and 91 % identity , respectively , toward the known t. thermophilus hb27 electron transport proteins .
based on delta - blast results , it would seem as if thermus species typically harbor one cytochrome p450 monooxygenase gene .
the genome of thermus sp .
nmx2a.1 revealed two cytochrome p450 monooxygenase gene homologs ( tnmx _ 06310 and tnmx _ 12660 , partially sequenced ) that displayed 98 % and 63 % amino acid identity , respectively , when compared to cyp175a1 .
based on the high amino acid sequence identity and the fact that the substrate binding sites ( yano et al .
2003 ) for both cyp175a1 and tnmx _ 06310 are identical , it is plausible to suggest that tnm _ 06310 also encodes a putative beta - carotene hydroxylase .
genes involved in carbon fixation the cbb cycle is a series of enzyme - catalyzed reactions responsible for the fixing of carbon .
the limiting reaction in this cycle is carried out by the multimeric enzyme ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase / oxygenase or ' rubisco ' , which catalyzes the first major step of carbon fixation in the cbb cycle : a process in which ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate reacts with atmospheric co2 and h2o to form two molecules of 3 - phosphoglycerate ( badger and price 2003 ; mcnevin et al. 2007 ) .
the ability to perform this reaction is the defining step in identifying the presence of the cbb - cycle in most organisms .
multimeric rubisco ( comprising large and small subunits ) is found in plants and most autotrophic organisms , photosynthetic bacteria , algae , and even in some archaea ( andersson 2008 ; ichikawa et al. 2008 ) .
homologs of cbb cycle genes , including type 1 rubisco , were identified in a gene cluster of thermus sp .
nmx2a.1 .
a search through the pre _ gi database for sequence similarity with known genomic islands revealed a similar syntenic operon in the genomic island # 6 on the second chromosome of the genome of ralstonia eutropha h16 ( nc _ 008314 ) .
however , in contrast to ralstonia , dna composition comparison showed that these genes were native for thermus genomes and most likely this operon in nmx2a.1 emerged in result of recombination of genes with other thermus organisms by dna uptake ( kumwenda et al. 2014 ) .
bi - di blast analyses indicated that , excluding rubisco , the putative cbb cycle enzyme homologs could be identified in all 17 thermus strains , except for one enzyme that is responsible for regenerating ribulose - 1,5 - bisphosphate from ribulose - 5 - phosphate , namely phosphoribulokinase ( prk ) .
pathway tools was also unable to annotate a prk to complete the cbb - cycle ( figure s1 ) .
a survey of several thermus genomes revealed two adjacent ribulose - phosphate 3 - epimerases in the cbb - gene cluster ( figure s2 ) and further pathway tools analyses indicated that one of these is the enzyme responsible for the reaction 2.7.1.19 usually catalyzed by the prk ( figure s1 ) .
delta - blast using the smaller of the two epimerases from thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 ( tnmx _ 12225 ) produced at least 500 positive results for ribulose - phosphate 3 - epimerase from a wide variety of bacteria .
when the larger epimerase ( tnmx _ 12230 ) was subjected to the same delta blast , it showed that about 3 % of the results were for ribulose - phosphate 3 - epimerases containing a conserved protein domain called nucleoside / nucleotide kinase ( nk ) , which were almost exclusively confined to meiothermus / thermus strains .
strikingly , the remaining blast results were for prks from various bacteria and cyanobacteria .
tnmx _ 12230 was also analyzed in the brenda enzyme information system and was surprisingly identified as a prk .
brenda also identified theos _ rs08585 and n686 _ rs06455 , from t. oshimai jl - 2 and t. scotoductus k12 , respectively ( figure s2 ) , as prks .
the results are indicative of a possible misannotation of these proteins as epimerases instead of putative prks .
however , given the location of tnmx _ 12230 and other nk - region - containing epimerases in the cbb - gene cluster and the blast results , it could be argued that these epimerases are possibly prks , a crucial enzyme for regenerating the sugar substrate for rubisco and thus completing the cbb - cycle .
bi - di blast ( table s1 ) indicated that the rubisco homolog is not ubiquitously found in all species of thermus .
for example , the rubisco homolog is not present in any t. thermophilus strain except for t. thermophilus yim77409 .
as for the t. scotoductus strains , bi - di blast analyses revealed that both rubisco subunits are present in t. scotoductus dsm21543 but that t. scotoductus k12 only possesses the large rubisco subunit ( figure s2 ) .
no homologs of the rubisco subunits were identified in t. scotoductus strain dsm8553 and sa - 01 .
the absence of rubisco in the latter strain was surprising , given the very close similarity displayed between thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 and t. scotoductus sa - 01 on protein level ( figure 1 ) .
figure 3 shows the phylogenetic analysis of the artificially concatenated amino acid sequence containing the two ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase subunits and the fructose - 1,6 - bisphosphate , glpx type proteins .
figure 3 consensus phylogenetic tree of selected ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain ( ec 4.1.1.39 ) , ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain ( ec 4.1.1.39 ) , and the fructose - 1,6 - bisphosphate , glpx type ( ec 3.1.3.11 ) from thermus spp. rooted with an outlier .
these cbb - cycle proteins were selected for phylogenetic analyses due to their adjacent gene topology and orientation on the selected thermus genomes ( figure s2 ) .
an evolutionary relationship between the proteins from thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 and the six other thermus proteins is evident .
interestingly , a close evolutionary relationship with the proteins from t. islandicus dsm 21543 is observed with that from thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 .
the thermus strains depicted in figure 3 were isolated from vastly different geographical locations that range from iceland , portugal , and the usa ( hudson et al. 1989 ; williams et al. 1996 ; chung et al. 2000 ; bjornsdottir et al. 2009 ) .
reviewing the environments from which these thermus strains were isolated could illuminate the reasons for the presence of these carboxylases in a few thermus strains .
table s2 and table s3 contain some geographical and physico - chemical data of sites from which rubisco - containing thermus strains were isolated .
although the hot spring water these various thermus spp. reside in are from widespread geographical locations , there seems to be a common thread : appreciable amounts of hco3 - and co2 coupled with water ph ranging from neutral to alkaline .
the hco3 - in these hot springs has its origin from various carbonates in rocks , sediments , and soils that are heated from ultradeep geothermal activity , biogenic co2 that dissolves in water , or even co2 escaping from the soil ( mcgee et al. 2006 ) .
it would seem as if thermus strains that harbor rubisco genes are isolated from hot springs that have readily available hco3 - . further supporting this hypothesis is that t. thermophilus hb27 , t. thermophilus hb8 , and t. scotoductus sa - 01 were all isolated from environments with very low levels of hco3 - and do not contain the complete cbb cycle , having never had the need to acquire them , as was the case for thermus sp .
nmx2.a1 .
further , t. scotoductus sa - 01 was isolated from the deep subsurface , an environment where it was shown that the cbb cycle genes were almost completely absent and carbon metabolism occurs predominantly by the reductive acetyl - coa pathway ( simkus et al. 2016 ) .
thermus strains containing the type i rubisco homolog were isolated from hot springs with temperatures that range from 50 - 88degrees .
these high temperatures decrease oxygenation levels in the water .
given rubisco 's binding preference for o2 as opposed to co2 , the less oxygenated water could mean that rubisco would be able to bind co2 more freely .
this might explain why no homologs for carboxysome proteins were identified for any of the rubisco - containing thermus strains ( table s2 ) .
interestingly , homologs for carbonic anhydrases were identified for most rubisco - containing thermus strains but for none of the rubisco - devoid thermus strains ( file s1 , table s2 and table s3 ) .
we speculate that the putative cbb - cycle could be active to fix carbon in rubisco - containing thermus strains in the presence of bicarbonate , carbonic anhydrase , and low oxygenation .
since carbon fixation requires energy , a possible source of energy for chemolitotrophic growth could be the oxidation of sulfur compounds ( gounder et al. 2011 ; murugapiran et al. 2013 ; table s1 ) .
we conclude that rubisco - containing thermus strains can probably fix carbon as chemolitotrophes , and that rubisco - devoid thermus strains are likely obligate chemo - heterotrophs .

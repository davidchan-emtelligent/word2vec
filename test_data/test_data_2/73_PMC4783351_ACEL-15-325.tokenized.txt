summary the endocannabinoid system can modulate energy homeostasis by regulating feeding behaviour as well as peripheral energy storage and utilization .
importantly , many of its metabolic actions are mediated through the cannabinoid type 1 receptor ( cb1r ) , whose hyperactivation is associated with obesity and impaired metabolic function .
herein , we explored the effects of administering rimonabant , a selective cb1r inverse agonist , upon key metabolic parameters in young ( 4 month old ) and aged ( 17 month old ) adult male c57bl / 6 mice .
daily treatment with rimonabant for 14 days transiently reduced food intake in young and aged mice ; however , the anorectic response was more profound in aged animals , coinciding with a substantive loss in body fat mass .
notably , reduced insulin sensitivity in aged skeletal muscle and liver concurred with increased cb1r mrna abundance .
strikingly , rimonabant was shown to improve glucose tolerance and enhance skeletal muscle and liver insulin sensitivity in aged , but not young , adult mice .
moreover , rimonabant - mediated insulin sensitization in aged adipose tissue coincided with amelioration of low - grade inflammation and repressed lipogenic gene expression .
collectively , our findings indicate a key role for cb1r in aging - related insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction and highlight cb1r blockade as a potential strategy for combating metabolic disorders associated with aging .

consequently , impaired responsiveness to insulin , termed insulin resistance , is a key component of the metabolic syndrome and a prelude to type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2dm ) .
importantly , a number of studies have now linked aging with development of insulin resistance in rodents as well as obese and nonobese individuals ( rowe et al. , 1983 ; o'shaughnessy et al. , 1992 ) .
however , those factors which contribute to aging - related insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction remain poorly understood .
initiation of insulin - induced signalling stems from the activated insulin receptor kinase which can bind and regulate a number of downstream intracellular targets , including the insulin receptor substrate ( irs ) family of proteins and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( pi3k ) ( johnston et al. , 2003 ) .
the subsequent pi3k - mediated generation of phosphatidylinositol - ( 3,4,5 ) - triphosphate ( pip3 ) promotes translocation of protein kinase b ( pkb , also known as akt ) to the plasma membrane where it undergoes phosphorylation / activation by upstream kinases at its two key regulatory sites , thr308 and ser473 ( of pkbalpha / akt1 ) , respectively .
activated pkb / akt stimulates glycogen synthesis and glut - dependent glucose uptake by phosphorylating and inactivating gsk3 ( glycogen synthase kinase 3 ) and the rab gtpase - activating protein as160 ( akt substrate of 160 kda ) , respectively ( cross et al. , 1995 ; sano et al. , 2003 ) .
proper regulation of these cellular processes is therefore crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis by controlling glucose storage and utilization .
growing evidence indicates that the endocannabinoid system ( ecs ) is intimately involved in the physiological control of food intake and energy expenditure , through its ability to target central and peripheral sites including skeletal muscle , liver and adipose tissue ( pagotto et al. , 2006 ) .
many of the biological actions of the ecs are mediated through g - protein - coupled cannabinoid type 1 ( cb1r ) and type 2 ( cb2r ) receptors which can be activated by several endogenous ligands , including anandamide ( aea ) and 2 - arachidonoylglycerol ( 2 - ag ) .
importantly , ecs dysregulation has been linked to abdominal obesity and other risk factors for type 2 diabetes ( engeli et al. , 2005 ; osei - hyiaman et al. , 2005 ; matias et al. , 2006 ) .
for example , genetic and diet - induced obese animal models display elevated endocannabinoid levels in the hypothalamus and peripheral tissues ( di marzo et al. , 2001 ; osei - hyiaman et al. , 2005 ; matias et al. , 2006 ) .
furthermore , increased circulating levels of aea and 2 - ag , as well as elevated levels of 2 - ag within visceral adipose tissue , have been reported in obese and / or hyperglycaemic type 2 diabetic patients ( bluher et al. , 2006 ; matias et al. , 2006 ) .
in accord with this , hyperactivation of cb1r - induced signalling has been implicated in numerous metabolic abnormalities including hyperphagia , insulin resistance , glucose intolerance and impaired lipid homeostasis ( engeli et al. , 2005 ; jbilo et al. , 2005 ; osei - hyiaman et al. , 2005 ) .
conversely , genetic or pharmacological cb1r blockade improves metabolic status , for example by promoting reductions in body weight and fat mass , as well as enhancing insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance .
indeed , these beneficial responses may be mediated through central appetite suppression and / or through direct modulation of peripheral energy metabolism ( bensaid et al. , 2003 ; ravinet trillou et al. , 2003 , 2004 ; jbilo et al. , 2005 ; pagotto et al. , 2006 ; osei - hyiaman et al. , 2008 ; jourdan et al. , 2010 ) .
despite advances in our understanding of metabolic regulation by the ecs , as well as previous reports of age - related deregulation of cannabinoid receptors and endocannabinoid hydrolysing enzymes ( pascual et al. , 2013 , 2014 ) , little is known regarding the involvement of this signalling system in aging - associated metabolic dysfunction .
herein , we explored the effects of chronic ( 14 day ) administration of rimonabant ( sr141716 ) , a potent and selective cb1r inverse agonist ( landsman et al. , 1997 ) , on the energy budgets of young ( 4 month old ) and aged ( 17 month old ) adult male mice .
physical activity ( pa ) and body temperature ( tb ) were monitored throughout the 14 - day experiment using implanted transmitters , and resting metabolic rate ( rmr ) by indirect calorimetry .
this protocol permitted investigation of the effects of chronic rimonabant treatment upon different components of energy intake and expenditure , as well as body weight and fat mass .
in addition , the impact of rimonabant upon key metabolic signalling pathways was determined in skeletal muscle , adipose tissue and liver isolated from young and aged mice .
we show that aging was associated with a marked reduction in skeletal muscle and liver insulin sensitivity , which coincides with increased body fat mass .
intriguingly , this aging - related insulin desensitization concurred with increased muscle and hepatic cb1r gene expression , indicative of enhanced endocannabinoid / cb1r tone within these tissues .
strikingly , rimonabant improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in aged , but not young , adult mice .
moreover , cb1 blockade induced a marked loss in body fat mass , concomitant with its ability to reduce adipogenic capacity and counteract low - grade inflammation in aged epididymal fat tissue .
together , our findings reveal a novel role for the ecs in aging - related metabolic dysfunction and identify cb1r as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of metabolic disorders associated with the aging process .
results the anorectic and weight reducing effects of rimonabant are more profound in aged versus young adult c57bl / 6 mice rimonabant treatment significantly reduced daily food consumption in young mice from day 2 ( 2.5 +/ - 0.11 g to 1.8 +/ - 0.13 g ; p < 0.05 ) until day 4 ( 2.5 +/ - 0.08 g to 2.1 +/ - 0.08 g ; p < 0.05 ) of the treatment period ( fig. 1a ) .
no significant differences in food intake were observed in response to the cb1r blocker in young mice for the remainder of the 14 - day study period .
strikingly , rimonabant triggered a more profound and prolonged decrease in daily food consumption in aged mice ( fig. 1b ) , including a marked reduction from 2.7 +/ - 0.22 g to 0.51 +/ - 0.09 g ( p < 0.05 ) at treatment day 3 .
this preceded a more protracted recovery period , whereby daily food intake was significantly reduced until day 10 , excluding treatment days 7 and 9 .
it should be noted that the observed reduction in food consumption in young and aged control - treated mice on days 10 and 11 was likely attributable to the fasting period which preceded the glucose tolerance test on day 11 .
in accord with its more robust anorectic response in aged mice , rimonabant also promoted a greater reduction in total body mass in aged animals compared to younger counterparts ( fig. 1c ) .
corresponding statistical analysis of the auc ( area under the curve ) revealed a significant 8.5 % decrease in the auc representing aged animals treated with rimonabant versus control , compared to the 3.5 % ( not significant ) reduction in auc mediated by cb1r blockade in young mice ( fig. 1d ) .
it should be noted that there were no significant differences between vehicle control and rimonabant treatment groups at baseline in both young and aged mice .

rimonabant does not alter parameters of energy expenditure in young and aged mice next , we explored the possibility that the observed reductions in body mass in response to rimonabant may also be associated with increased systemic energy expenditure ( zhang et al. , 2012 ) .
for example , rimonabant has been previously reported to increase energy expenditure in diet - induced obese c57bl / 6 mice ( zhang et al. , 2012 ) .
however as shown in fig. 2 , neither physical activity ( fig. 2a and b ) , body temperature ( fig. 2c and d ) or resting metabolic rate ( rmr ) ( fig. 2e and f ) , were significantly altered by rimonabant treatment in young and aged mice .
the hyperactivity on days 10 or 11 coincided with removing the food prior to performing the gtt .
therefore , these data indicate that it is unlikely that cb1r blockade promotes reductions in body weight through altering energy expenditure in young or aged mice .

young and aged adult male c57bl / 6 mice treated with rimonabant ( rim ) or vehicle control ( con ) had their physical activity ( a , b ) and body temperature ( c , d ) monitored daily during the 14 - day study period as indicated .

aging - related insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver coincides with increased cb1r gene expression numerous studies have linked aging with development of insulin resistance ( rowe et al. , 1983 ; o'shaughnessy et al. , 1992 ; sczelecki et al. , 2013 ) .
in accord with this , we report a marked reduction in the ability of insulin to phosphorylate / activate pkb at its two key regulatory sites thr308 ( by 1.7 - fold ; p < 0.05 ) and ser473 ( by 1.6 fold ; p < 0.05 ) in aged versus young soleus tissue ( fig. 3a ) .
in addition , aged gastrocnemius muscle also displayed a significant 1.7 - fold decrease in insulin - induced pkb / akt473 phosphorylation relative to tissue from younger mice ( fig. 3b ) .
strikingly , this aging - related impairment in insulin sensitivity coincided with a 1.8 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) increase in cb1r mrna abundance in aged versus young gastrocnemius muscle , in contrast to the 1.3 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) decrease in cb2r mrna ( fig. 3c ) .
in addition , analysis of respective liver samples similarly revealed a significant 1.7 - fold reduction in insulin - induced pkb473 phosphorylation in aged versus young tissue ( fig. s1a ) , concurring with a marked 3.8 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) increase in hepatic cb1r gene expression ( fig. s1b ) .
therefore , these data indicate that impaired insulin action in aged skeletal muscle and liver is associated with enhanced ecs / cb1r tone .
figure 3 aging - related insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is associated with reduced insulin sensitivity and upregulated cb1r gene expression .
lysates prepared from soleus ( a ) and gastrocnemius muscle ( b ) from young and aged mice stimulated with or without insulin were immunoblotted using phospho and native pkb / akt antibodies as indicated .

rimonabant improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in aged but not young mice based on our observation that reduced insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and liver concurs with enhanced ecs / cb1r tone , we hypothesized that cb1r antagonism may act to ameliorate aging - related insulin desensitization .
strikingly , rimonabant treatment significantly enhanced insulin - stimulated pkb / akt308 and pkb / akt473 phosphorylation by 3 - fold and 1.5 - fold respectively , in aged soleus muscle ( fig. 4b ) , but not in solei of younger mice ( fig. 4a ) .
moreover , treatment with the cb1r blocker also augmented insulin - induced pkb / akt473 phosphorylation ( by 1.8 - fold ; p < 0.05 ) in aged gastrocnemius muscle ( fig. s2 ) .

allied to its insulin - sensitizing action within aged skeletal muscle , rimonabant also significantly enhanced insulin - stimulated pkb / akt473 phosphorylation ( by 1.8 fold ) in aged livers , in contrast to conveying a slight repressive ( although not significant ) effect in hepatic tissue from younger mice ( compare fig. s3a and b ) .
importantly , in accord with these improvements in insulin - induced signalling in aged skeletal muscle and liver , we further report enhanced glucose tolerance in aged mice administered rimonabant , as determined by gtt ( fig. 4d ) .
intriguingly , this improvement in glucose tolerance was not manifested in younger mice treated with the inverse cb1r agonist ( fig. 4c ) .
statistical analysis revealed an 11 % decrease in the auc representing aged animals treated with rimonabant versus control ( p < 0.05 ) , compared to the 3.4 % ( not significant ) reduction in response to cb1r blockade in younger mice ( fig. 4e ) .
moreover , this rimonabant - mediated improvement in glucose tolerance coincided with the partial (~ 50 %) normalization of fasting plasma insulin levels , which were found to be 3.8 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) higher in aged versus young mice ( fig. s5a ) .
together , these findings indicate enhanced insulin sensitivity following rimonabant administration in aged mice , and reveal age - dependent effects of cb1r inhibition upon insulin action and systemic glucose homeostasis .
rimonabant downregulates abundance of the catalytic subunit of pp2a in skeletal muscle in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism ( s ) by which rimonabant acts to improve insulin sensitivity , we first explored the possibility that cb1r blockade may function by positively modulating upstream insulin receptor signalling .
however , as shown in fig. 5a , administration of rimonabant did not alter protein abundance of the insulin receptor beta subunit , irs - 1 , pten , or the p85 regulatory subunit of pi3k in aged gastrocnemius muscle .
moreover , cb1r inhibition did not significantly alter phosphorylation of irs - 1 at ser307 ( fig. 5b ) , a site whose phosphorylation in response to cb1r activation has been associated with suppressed irs - 1 / pkb dependent signalling ( liu et al. , 2012 ) .
indeed , this is consistent with our previous work demonstrating the ability of rimonabant to enhance insulin sensitivity in rat l6 myotubes , an in vitro skeletal muscle model , without altering upstream irs - 1 / pi3k signalling ( lipina et al. , 2010 ) .
therefore , we next focussed on alternative pathways involving the potential modulation of phlpp1 and pp2a ( protein phosphatase 2a ) , two key negative regulators which act to dephosphorylate and inactivate pkb / akt ( resjo et al. , 2002 ; liu et al. , 2012 ) .
rimonabant treatment did not alter levels of phlpp1 protein in aged gastrocnemius muscle ( fig. 5a ) but did , however , promote a significant 1.8 - fold reduction in the protein abundance of the pp2a catalytic subunit ( pp2ac ) in the same tissue ( fig. 5c ) .
notably , we also observed a modest ( 1.3 - fold ) increase in pp2ac protein abundance in gastrocnemius muscle of aged versus young mice , although this was not found to be significant ( fig. 5d ) .
allied to these observations in vivo , we further demonstrate that the ability of the selective cb1r agonist acea to inhibit insulin - induced pkb / akt308 phosphorylation in l6 myotubes is completely prevented by co - treatment with either rimonabant or okadaic acid , a potent pp2a inhibitor ( fig. 5e ) .
together , these data implicate pp2a as a key component in cb1r - induced insulin resistance , whereby its repression in response to cb1r blockade may serve to alleviate its inhibitory action towards pkb / akt .
figure 5 rimonabant - mediated improvement in insulin sensitivity coincides with repressed pp2a in skeletal muscle .
gastrocnemius muscle tissue lysates from young and aged mice treated with rimonabant ( rim ) , or vehicle control ( con ) as indicated , were immunoblotted using the antibodies shown ( a - d ) .
in addition , l6 myotubes were incubated with 1 mum acea , 100 nm rimonabant and / or 100 nm okadaic acid in serum - free medium prior to stimulation with insulin or vehicle control ( 20 nm for 10 min ) ( e ) .
resulting cell lysates were immunoblotted using phospho ( thr 308 ) and native pkb / akt antibodies .
values presented are the mean +/ - sem from 3 independent experiments .

rimonabant conveys anti - adipogenic and anti - inflammatory effects in aged epididymal fat tissue it is now widely acknowledged that obesity increases the risk of developing insulin resistance ( everhart et al. , 1992 ) .
in accord with this , our dxa analysis revealed that body fat mass of aged mice was 2.3 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) higher in comparison to their younger counterparts ( fig. 6a ) .
intriguingly , rimonabant treatment in aged mice led to a 1.5 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) reduction in body fat mass , but exhibited no significant effect in younger animals ( fig. 6a ) .
consistent with its observed anti - obesity action in older mice , rimonabant markedly decreased mrna levels of the lipogenic gene fatty acid synthase ( fas ) by 4 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) in aged epididymal fat tissue ( fig. 6b ) .
however , there was a tendency for rimonabant to reduce mrna abundance of srebp - 1 ( sterol regulatory element binding protein - 1 ) , a transcriptional regulator of fas , as well as the pro - adipogenic gene ppargamma2 ( peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ) , although the effects were not significant in each case ( fig. 6b ) .
in addition , rimonabant treatment significantly induced mrna abundance of the lipolytic enzyme atgl ( adipose triglyceride lipase ) by 1.9 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 6b ) .
therefore , these data indicate that cb1r blockade may act to reduce body fat in aged mice , at least in part , by impairing and / or inducing pro - adipogenic and lipolytic processes , respectively .
figure 6 rimonabant reduces body fat mass and conveys both anti - adipogenic and anti - inflammatory responses in adipose tissue of aged mice .

because adipose tissue is a key site for production and secretion of insulin - desensitizing pro - inflammatory cytokines , we subsequently explored the possibility that rimonabant may convey anti - inflammatory actions within this tissue ( wang et al. , 2011 ) .
as shown in fig. 6c , we report a 1.5 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) increase in the protein abundance of ikappabalpha ( inhibitory subunit of nf kappa b alpha ) , a key repressor of nf - kappab - driven pro - inflammatory cytokine gene expression , within epididymal fat tissue of aged mice treated with rimonabant ( fig. 6c ) .
accordingly , this coincided with a significant 1.4 - fold reduction in the mrna abundance of il - 6 ( interleukin - 6 ) , an established nf - kappab target gene ( fig. 6d ) , as well as a 1.3 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) decrease in plasma il - 6 levels ( fig. s5b ) .
moreover , in accord with its anti - inflammatory response , rimonabant treatment was found to almost completely suppress protein abundance of the macrophage marker cd68 in aged epididymal fat tissue , indicative of reduced macrophage infiltration ( fig. s4 ) .
notably , rimonabant has also been reported to increase expression of adiponectin , an insulin - sensitizing adipokine , in adipose tissue of obese fa / fa rats and in cultured 3t3 f442a adipocytes ( bensaid et al. , 2003 ) .
in accord with this , we demonstrate a significant 1.2 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) increase in plasma levels of adiponectin following rimonabant treatment in aged mice ( fig. s5c ) .
therefore , the ability of cb1r antagonism to counteract low - grade inflammation and / or increase levels of adiponectin may , at least in part , contribute to its insulin - sensitizing action in aged epididymal fat , as demonstrated by the 1.5 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) augmentation in insulin - induced pkb308 phosphorylation ( fig. 6e ) .
importantly , these findings indicate anti - adipogenic , pro - lipolytic and anti - inflammatory actions conveyed by rimonabant within aged adipose tissue which may , at least in part , underlie its ability to improve systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in older mice .
discussion a number of animal studies and clinical trials have previously described the anti - obesity and insulin - sensitizing effects of cb1r antagonism ( ravinet trillou et al. , 2003 ; jbilo et al. , 2005 ; alonso et al. , 2011 ) .
this study reveals for the first time , a protective role for cb1r inhibition against aging - related metabolic dysfunction in mice .
we report that rimonabant improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in aged mice , whereas the cb1r blocker failed to convey these same beneficial responses in younger animals .
this coincided with the ability of rimonabant to induce a more profound anorectic response and greater reduction in body fat mass in older mice .
crucially , we demonstrate increased cb1r gene expression in aged skeletal muscle and liver , indicative of enhanced endocannabinoid / cb1r tone in response to aging .
notably , our findings are consistent with previous work reporting high fat diet - induced increases in cb1r tissue expression in younger animals , together with the amelioration of dyslipidaemia and lipogenesis , as well as improved insulin sensitivity in mice deficient for cb1r ( osei - hyiaman et al. , 2008 ) .
indeed , it is possible that the improvements in insulin sensitivity that are conveyed by rimonabant in aged mice may be due , at least in part , to reductions in adiposity .
however , it should be noted that previous studies utilizing hyperinsulinaemic - euglycaemic clamps and / or itt ( insulin tolerance test ) , have documented the ability of rimonabant to improve insulin sensitivity without promoting significant reductions in body fat mass or visceral fat in db / db mice and diet - induced obese dogs , respectively ( kim et al. , 2012 ; nam et al. , 2012 ) .
together with our previous work reporting direct insulin - sensitizing actions by rimonabant in rat skeletal l6 myotubes ( lipina et al. , 2010 ) , these findings indicate that cb1r inhibition may at least partly enhance insulin sensitivity in aged mice independently of its ability to normalize age - related adiposity .
notably , rimonabant - mediated insulin sensitization in aged skeletal muscle coincides with the ability of the cb1r blocker to repress expression of the catalytic subunit of pp2a , a key negative regulator of pkb / akt ( andjelkovic et al. , 1996 ) .
moreover , pharmacological inhibition of pp2a , similar to rimonabant provision , were both shown to prevent cb1r - induced insulin desensitization in rat skeletal l6 myotubes .
in contrast , rimonabant treatment in aged mice failed to alter the expression of several key upstream insulin signalling components .
in addition , we have previously reported the ability of rimonabant to enhance insulin sensitivity in l6 myotubes without impacting upon irs - 1 / pi3k signalling ( lipina et al. , 2010 ) .
therefore , these findings indicate that it is unlikely that cb1r blockade conveys its insulin - sensitizing effects through modulating upstream signalling components , but instead , acts to alleviate pp2a - mediated repression of pkb / akt , at least in skeletal muscle .
in accord with its insulin - sensitizing actions , the ability of rimonabant to reduce body fat was markedly enhanced in aged mice .
this may be due , at least in part , to its more effective inhibition of food intake in aged animals , although the exact processes underlying this anorectic response remain unclear .
one possible explanation may involve aging - related increases in endocannabinoid / cb1r tone in regions of the brain associated with appetite regulation , such as the nucleus accumbens ( maldonado - irizarry et al. , 1995 ; winters et al. , 2012 ) .
indeed , these changes may be brought about by increased cb1r expression , or in response to the altered activity of enzymes implicated in the synthesis and / or degradation of endocannabinoids ( pascual et al. , 2013 ) .
consequently , such a scenario may convey the apparent augmentation of rimonabant 's anorectic response in older mice .
furthermore , cb1r inhibition may counteract the appetite inducing effects of peptides such as ghrelin , whose circulating levels have been shown to increase with aging in mice ( senin et al. , 2013 ; lin et al. , 2014 ) .
cb1r blockade has also been shown to promote reductions in body fat mass through direct peripheral actions in adipocytes ( jbilo et al. , 2005 ; jourdan et al. , 2010 ) .
in accord with this , we report the ability of rimonabant to repress or induce lipogenic and lipolytic genes , respectively , in aged epididymal fat tissue .
indeed , cb1r inhibition may act to diminish aging - associated lipogenesis , a process known to be transduced in response to cb1r activation , as well as promoting increased lipolytic drive either directly or indirectly , for example through activation of the sympathoadrenal system ( jbilo et al. , 2005 ; molhoj et al. , 2010 ) .
furthermore , the anti - inflammatory response conveyed by the cb1r blocker in aged epididymal fat may also contribute to its insulin - sensitizing actions , in particular considering the fact that adipose tissue serves as a key site for the production and secretion of insulin - desensitizing inflammatory cytokines such as il - 6 and tnfalpha ( gnacinska et al. , 2009 ; gustafson , 2010 ) .
notably , previous pair - feeding studies carried out in rodents have revealed that the beneficial metabolic effects conveyed by chronic (> 1 week ) pharmacological blockade of cb1r , or cb1r deficiency , may arise through food intake dependent or independent ( e.g. increased energy expenditure ) mechanisms ( cota et al. , 2003 ; jbilo et al. , 2005 ; herling et al. , 2008 ; nogueiras et al. , 2008 ) .
whilst this present study did not permit us to discriminate between these two different modes of action directly , our findings indicate that rimonabant is unlikely to convey its metabolic improvements in aged mice by increasing energy expenditure .
indeed , this was demonstrated by the lack of significant change in several parameters of energy expenditure including physical activity and resting metabolic rate following administration of the inverse cb1r agonist .
however , we cannot rule out the possibility that rimonabant may act to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and / or oxidative capacity within individual tissues , thereby contributing to their improved metabolic status ( jbilo et al. , 2005 ; tedesco et al. , 2008 ) .
indeed , to support this possibility we report a 2.5 - fold ( p < 0.05 ) increase in pgc - 1alpha protein abundance in gastrocnemius muscle of aged mice treated with rimonabant , although no such increase was observed in aged epididymal fat tissue in response to cb1r inhibition ( fig. s6 ) , thereby suggesting tissue - specific actions .
in an attempt to further address this issue , future work comparing the metabolic effects of rimonabant and peripherally acting cb1r antagonists ( e.g. am6545 ) , which display low blood brain barrier penetration , may help delineate the relative contribution of hypophagic and peripherally targeted responses conveyed by cb1r blockade ( tam et al. , 2010 ) .
indeed , such studies may involve analysis of insulin signalling as well as utilizing hyperinsulinaemic - euglycaemic clamps to assess insulin sensitivity in vivo .
in addition , our findings also raise the question as to whether rimonabant promotes its beneficial responses by functioning to inhibit constitutive / tonic cb1r activity ( i.e. inverse cb1r agonism ) , or alternatively , by acting as a receptor antagonist ( bouaboula et al. , 1997 ; xie et al. , 2007 ) .
follow up studies assessing the effects of cb1r stimulation and / or inhibition upon metabolic processes in primary cells ( i.e. hepatocytes , muscle cells and adipocytes ) isolated from young and aged animals , may prove useful in identifying age and / or tissue - specific effects of cb1r antagonism / inverse agonism .
in conclusion , our findings reveal age - dependent effects of cb1r inhibition upon metabolic function in vivo .
we demonstrate that cb1r blockade leads to a marked reduction in food intake and body fat mass , concomitant with improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance , in aged mice .
notably , these beneficial responses are either absent or less prominent in younger animals .
moreover , we report that insulin resistance in aged skeletal muscle and liver coincides with increased endocannabinoid / cb1r tone .
therefore , these findings reveal a previously unknown role for cb1r in conferring aging - induced metabolic dysfunction and identify cb1r inhibition as a potential strategy to counteract age - associated impairments in energy homeostasis .
experimental procedures animal studies male c57bl / 6 mice at 6 weeks of age ( charles river , ma , usa ) were housed in a controlled 12 h light / dark environment and maintained ad libitum on a standard control diet ( d12450b ; research diets , new brunswick , nj , usa ) until 4 months ( young ) or 16 months ( aged ) of age .
at 16 months , mice were implanted intraperitoneally with temperature transmitters ( pdt - 4000 e - mitter ; mini mitter , bend , or , usa ) under general anaesthesia ( mixture of isoflurane and oxygen ) .
mice were allowed 14 days to recover prior to experimental treatment .
over the next 14 days , animals were administered 3 % ( v / v ) ethanol in dh2o ( vehicle control , n = 15 ) or sr141716 ( 10 mug g - 1 , n = 15 ) by oral gavage .
during this time mice had ad libitum access to food and water , with body mass and food intake measured daily .
the average body weights ( mean +/ - sem ) of young control and rimonabant - treated mice at the start of experimentation were 29.18 +/ - 0.45 g and 29.09 +/ - 0.39 g , respectively .
the average body weights of aged control and rimonabant - treated mice at the start of experimentation were 41.15 +/ - 1.43 g and 41.23 +/ - 1.17 g , respectively .
body temperature and general activity mice in their home cages were placed onto transponder energizers ( er - 4000 receiver ; mini mitter ) allowing noninvasive monitoring of body temperature and physical activity throughout the study period .
the vitalview data acquisition system ( mini mitter ) was used to collect the data at 1 min intervals .
resting metabolic rate ( rmr ) rmr was determined in animals after 8 - 9 days of treatment using an open - flow respiratory system described previously ( krol et al. , 2003 ) .
all measurements took place during the light phase between 0700 and 1630 .
briefly , fresh air was pumped through a sealed perspex chamber containing the mouse and placed within an incubator set at 30 degreesc , within the thermo - neutral zone for c57bl / 6 mice ( speakman & keijer , 2012 ) .
air was pumped through the chamber at a rate of 500 - 700 ml min - 1 which was monitored using an alexander wright dm3a flow meter .
air leaving the chamber was dried using silica gel and passed through a gas analyser ( servomex xentra ) .
gas concentrations were measured continuously , and values recorded every 30 s for 180 min .
oxygen consumption rates were determined using the lowest 20 consecutive values ( 10 - min interval ) and co2 production over the highest 20 consecutive values ( 10 min interval ) .
data ( ml o2 min - 1 ) were converted to energy equivalents ( kj day - 1 ) using the weir equation and the mean respiratory quotient ( rq ) for each group ( vo2 *( 1.106 + 3.941 / rq )* 4.184 * 60 * 24 )/ 1000 ) .
body masses were determined before and after each run .
dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry ( dxa ) analysis fat mass ( fm ) and fat free mass ( ffm ) of mice were determined twice at day 0 and day 14 using dxa ( ge medical systems ultrasound and bmd , bedford , uk ) .
animals were anesthetized using an isoflurane / oxygen mixture for the duration of the scan (~ 3 min ) .
data were corrected using a calibration formula generated by linear regression of fat content as determined by dxa as previously described ( johnston et al. , 2005 ) .
glucose tolerance test following gavage on day 10 , animals received a clean cage and food was removed from the hopper .
the next morning a blood sample was taken via the tail tip to measure basal fasting glucose concentration ( ultratouch glucometer , lifescan , uk ) .
mice were then injected intraperitoneally with glucose ( 2 g kg - 1 body weight ) and glucose concentration determined 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 min after injection .
mice were refed after the final measurement .
analysis of blood metabolites ( plasma insulin , il - 6 and adiponectin ) fasting plasma insulin levels were measured using a mercodia insulin elisa kit ( mercodia , sweden ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
analysis of plasma il - 6 and adiponectin was determined using mouse il - 6 and adiponectin quantikine ( r ) elisa kits ( both from r & d systems , abingdon , uk ) , respectively , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
dissection on day 15 , mice were culled by co2 overdose .
half the mice received an injection of insulin ( 2 mu g - 1 ) 10 min prior to cull .
careful excision of muscle ( soleus and gastrocnemius ) , gonadal fat and liver was performed prior to being snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at - 80 degreesc .
blood serum specimens were also isolated and snap - frozen .
muscle culture , cell / tissue treatments and analysis methods for culturing and treating rat l6 myotubes and their preparation for immunoblotting , rna extraction , conventional rt - pcr and real - time quantitative ( qpcr ) analysis have been previously described ( lipina et al. , 2010 ; turban et al. , 2012 ) .
for animal tissue , frozen tissue was ground using a pestle and mortar prior to homogenization with ice - cold lysis buffer .
resulting cell / tissue debris was removed from crude lysate by centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min at 4 degreesc , and the resulting supernatant used for western blot analysis .
proteins from cell / tissue lysates ( 30 mug ) were subjected to sds - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted as previously described ( lipina et al. , 2010 ; turban et al. , 2012 ) with antibodies against irs - 1 ( santa cruz , ca , usa ) , phospho - irs - 1ser307 ( merck - millipore ) , phlpp1 ( merck - millipore , darmstadt , germany ) , pten ( santa cruz ) , cd68 ( santa cruz ) , p85 - pi3k ( merck - millipore ) , phospho - pkb / akt ( ser473 and thr308 ; new england biolabs , hitchin , herts , uk ) , native pkb / akt ( new england biolabs ) , pgc - 1alpha ( abcam , cambridge , uk ) , gapdh ( sigma , poole , dorset , uk ) , insulin receptor beta - subunit ( merck - millipore ) or the catalytic subunit of pp2a ( pp2ac , dsst , university of dundee ) .
primary antibody detection was carried out using anti - rabbit igg - hrp or anti - mouse igg - hrp - linked antibody ( new england biolabs ) as appropriate by ecl .
resulting band intensities were quantified using imagej software ( nih , bethseda , md , usa ) .
statistical analysis data were analysed using graphpad prism ( graphpad , san diego , ca , usa ) .
statistical analysis was performed using one - way or two - way anova ( with bonferroni post hoc test ) or student 's unpaired t - test as appropriate and considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 .
metabolic rate data were analysed using ancova as recommended by tschop et al .
( tschop et al. , 2012 ) using body composition parameters as covariates .

bacillus anthracis lethal toxin ( lt ) is a key virulence factor of anthrax and contributes significantly to the in vivo pathology .
the enzymatically active component is a zn2 + - dependent metalloprotease that cleaves most isoforms of mitogen - activated protein kinase kinases ( mkks ) .
using ex vivo differentiated human lung epithelium we report that lt destroys lung epithelial barrier function and wound healing responses by immobilizing the actin and microtubule network .
long - term exposure to the toxin generated a unique cellular phenotype characterized by increased actin filament assembly , microtubule stabilization , and changes in junction complexes and focal adhesions .
lt - exposed cells displayed randomly oriented , highly dynamic protrusions , polarization defects and impaired cell migration .
reconstitution of mapk pathways revealed that this lt - induced phenotype was primarily dependent on the coordinated loss of mkk1 and mkk2 signaling .
thus , mkks control fundamental aspects of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility .
even though lt disabled repair mechanisms , agents such as keratinocyte growth factor or dexamethasone improved epithelial barrier integrity by reducing cell death .
these results suggest that co - administration of anti - cytotoxic drugs may be of benefit when treating inhalational anthrax .
introduction inhalational anthrax is an infectious disease caused by the uptake of aerosolized spores of the gram - positive bacterium bacillus anthracis into the airways .
alveolar macrophages and lung - resident dendritic cells ingest these spores and migrate to nearby lymph nodes , where intracellular germination and release of vegetative bacteria occurs .
after a slow onset b. anthracis divides rapidly in the circulatory system , resulting in fulminant disease characterized by respiratory distress , haemorrhage , shock and sudden death of the host [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
the rapid and lethal development of b. anthracis sepsis is triggered by massive release of a tripartite bacterial exotoxin [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
anthrax toxin consists of protective antigen ( pa ) , lethal factor ( lf ) and edema factor ( ef ) .
pa constitutes the receptor - binding and carrier protein , which is responsible for host cell attachment , complex formation with lf and ef , cellular entry of the toxin complex and intracellular release of lf and ef to endocytic organelles or the cytoplasm [ 5 ] .
ef is a calcium - and calmodulin - dependent adenylate cyclase that raises intracellular levels of camp , a second messenger altering the activity of signaling molecules including guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( i.e. epac ) , protein kinases ( i.e. pka ) and certain ion channels [ 6 ] .
the pathological consequences of the combined binary edema toxin ( et ; pa and ef ) range from imbalance of fluid homeostasis and edema formation in lungs to inhibition of chemotaxis and phagocytosis , and suppression of angiogenesis in endothelial cells .
lf is a zn2 + - dependent metalloprotease that specifically cleaves almost all of the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) kinases ( mkks ) [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
the cleavage occurs close to the n terminus of mkks and removes the so - called d - domain , a mapk docking motif , thereby decreasing mkk - mapk binding affinity and mkk - induced phosphorylation and activation of mapk .
mkks provide a crucial link from many cell surface receptors to erk , jnk and p38 , and thus mediate the regulation of many transcriptional networks by mitogenic and stress signals .
binary lethal toxin ( lt ; pa and lf ) has been connected to caspase - 1 - dependent cell death of susceptible innate immune cells , to endothelial cell apoptosis , and to cell cycle arrest in epithelial cells [ 9 ] .
lt alters the host immune response by abolishing cytokine production and expression of co - stimulatory molecules .
recently , lt was linked to decreased neutrophil chemotaxis due to reduced actin filament assembly and to inhibition of actin - based motility of the intracellular pathogen listeria monocytogenes in hela cells [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
not all of lt 's detrimental effects on host cells seem to be a consequence of abolished mkk function .
specifically , lt - induced cell death has not been conclusively linked to mkks [ 3 ] , suggesting that other lf target proteins may exist .
although interference with anti - bacterial responses of the host innate and adaptive immune system is important for b. anthracis' ability to replicate rapidly , non - immune cells seem to contribute to the severity and fatality of b. anthracis infection when bacterimia - induced toxin concentrations reach considerable levels .
injection of mice with purified lt results in increased vascular leakage , pleural edema and hypoxic tissue injury [ 12 ] .
similarly , pathological features in systemic anthrax infection in rhesus monkeys , chimpanzees and inhalational anthrax victims are hemorrhages , pleural effusion and edema [ 13 ] .
this phenotype suggests that the barrier function of the endothelium might be affected by lt. in fact , lt caused significant endothelial barrier dysfunction in primary human microvascular endothelial cells [ 14 ] .
this effect was not caused by apoptosis , although caspase - dependent apoptosis in lt - treated huvec was reported elsewhere [ 15 ] .
the observed increase in permeability , causing fluid leakage , could not be mimicked by suppressing all three map kinase pathways with chemical inhibitors and thus , the underlying mechanism of endothelial junction disruption by lt remains unresolved .
the clinical manifestation of anthrax rarely includes bronchopneumonia in the earlier stages of the disease .
in contrast , the final sepsis and shock stage of infection is characterized by respiratory distress and pulmonary edema .
this may indicate that the airway epithelium plays not only a role in dissemination of b. anthracis infection [ 16 ] , but that breakdown of the lung epithelial barrier is also a crucial , late event in anthrax lethality .
in this study , we report that lethal toxin has a profound destructive effect on the barrier function of differentiated human airway epithelium .
this lt - induced phenotype is the consequence of altering major components of the mammalian cytoskeleton and microtubule network , causing a state of permanent paralysis where turnover of structural components is greatly reduced .
lung epithelial cell functions , which require sustained dynamic regulation such as directed migration and multicellular junction reorganization , were abolished by lt. the structural paralysis of airway cells is mapk pathway - dependent and can be efficiently counteracted by introducing non - cleavable mkk mutants .
as this approach is currently not a therapeutic option , several compounds recognized for lung - protective function were assessed for their ability to reduce toxin - induced barrier damage .
results lethal toxin destroys the barrier function of human mucociliary lung epithelium to study the effect of b. anthracis toxins on the respiratory epithelium , a three - dimensional ( 3d ) model of polarized , mucociliary lung epithelium was established .
primary human lung epithelial cells were grown on extracellular matrix - coated filters in air - liquid interface for 3 - 4 weeks .
the differentiated phenotype was characterized by a marked morphological change , giving rise to a multicellular layer consisting of basal cells , non - ciliated cells , ciliated cells and goblet cells ( figure s1a ) .
the ex vivo differentiated airway cells formed tight and adherens junction complexes , produced mucus and expressed defensins and surfactant ( figure s1b - d ) .
human lung epithelial cells expressed both anthrax receptors , tem8 / atr and cmg2 ( figure s1e ) as previously demonstrated in human lung tissue for tem8 [ 17 ] .
this model system was used to determine if circulating b. anthracis exotoxins alter lung epithelial cell functions .
addition of protective antigen ( pa ) alone or edema toxin ( et ; pa and ef ) into the media in the bottom chamber did not alter barrier function ( figure s2a ) , while basolateral application of lethal toxin ( lt ; pa and lf ) caused a significant decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and a substantial increase in permeability of the layer to fluorescently labeled albumin applied from the apical side ( figure 1a ) .
transmission electron microscopy revealed that treatment of the 3d epithelium with lt caused an expansion of the epithelial layer and the appearance of large paracellular spaces ( figure 1b ) .
staining of the untreated and lt - treated epithelium with the tight junction marker zo1 showed disruption of the apical junction network at multicellular connection sites ( figure 1c ) .
when exposed to lt , human lung epithelial cells cultured in typical 2d conditions , did not exhibit any signs of apoptosis as judged with caspase 3 - mediated cleavage of poly ( adp - ribose ) polymerase ( parp ) cleavage , by analysis of phosphatidylserine exposure , by dna laddering or by transferase mediated dutp nick end labeling ( tunel ) staining .
however , up to 5 % of cells detached during the first 48 hours of treatment .
this loss of attached cells did not accelerate substantially after prolonged incubation in growth factor - containing media , although lt - treated cells failed to resume proliferation ( figure s2b ) .
in polarized lung epithelium a minor , but reproducible increase of cell death was observed after 48 hours of lt treatment ( figure 1d ) , which would be sufficient for loss of barrier function if junction complex remodeling is disturbed .

data are represented as mean +/ - sem of 3 inserts , n = 3 .
increase and redistribution of junction proteins by lethal toxin comparison of tight junctions ( tj ) in untreated versus lt - treated 3d model systems did not reveal clear differences in zo1 distribution between two adjacent cells ( figure 1c ) .
analysis of lung epithelial cells grown in 2d conditions undergoing lt treatment clearly showed an increase of the tj marker zo1 along the border of adjoining cells ( figure 2a ) .
zo1 was concentrated in punctate structures lining cell - cell contacts .
similarly , the adherens junction ( aj ) protein e - cadherin was up - regulated in cells exposed to lt ( figure 2b ) .
although the overall cell morphology of lung epithelial cells was retained , e - cadherin - containing cell junctions were less focused and more dispersed .
subcellular fractionation did not only confirm the confocal analysis , but indicated a redistribution and enrichment of both junction proteins in the cytoskeletal fraction ( figure 2c ) .

lethal toxin - induced reorganization of the cytoskeleton and microtubule network the apical junctional complex , composed of tjs and ajs , is intimately connected with the actomyosin cytoskeleton via several connections including a zo1 - cortactin linkage and an e - cadherin - catenin - rho gtpase axis .
confocal images of untreated and lt - treated lung epithelial cells revealed a circular pattern of ordered actin bundles in star - like formation as well as large , distinct filamentous actin - containing protrusions ( figure 3a ) .
as f - actin content in general was enhanced ( figure 3a , 3f ) , analysis of the actin depolymerization / polymerization cycle was performed .
quantification of remaining f - actin filaments after 1 hour of cytocholasin b treatment showed delayed actin depolymerization in cells exposed to lt ( figure 3b ) .
after washout f - actin filaments repolymerized into the originally observed phenotypes in control and lt - treated cells ( data not shown ) .
incubation of lt - treated cells with latrunculin a , which prevents actin polymerization by forming complexes with actin monomers , produced a depolymerization delay similar as illustrated for cytocholasin b ( data not shown ) .
the microtubule network and the actin cytoskeleton are interdependent , and thus profound actin reorganization is likely accompanied by changes in the microtubular system .
untreated primary lung epithelial cells displayed a radial meshwork of thin and wavy alpha - tubulin - containing structures .
exposure to lt produced a different pattern , where long microtubules extended straight to the cell periphery and into the large protrusions , resembling a " combed " phenotype ( figure 3c ) .
depolymerization of microtubules with nocodazole was delayed in toxin - treated cells as visualized by staining for stable microtubules using an antibody recognizing acetylated tubulin ( figure 3d ) .
we also noticed increased attachment of lung epithelial cells after 24 - 48 hours of incubation with lt. confocal analysis of vinculin - containing focal adhesions ( fa ) revealed a more elongated fa phenotype ( figure 3e ) , although the total number of focal contacts remained unchanged .
a substantial increase of proteins connected to focal adhesions such as vinculin , paxillin and cortactin and their redistribution to the cytoskeletal fraction was observed ( figure 3f ) .

mkk / mapk inhibition mimics lethal toxin - mediated lung cell motility defects the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton regulates spatial organization of transmembrane proteins and thus plasma membrane dynamics required for polarization and directed migration .
the altered physical state of lt - treated lung epithelial cells suggested distinct mechanical properties of these cells after intoxication .
time - lapse videomicroscopy of randomly migrating lung epithelial cells showed leading edge formation and persistent movement of polarized cells .
after 24 - 48 hours of lt treatment cells remained stationary lacking microtubule organizing center ( mtoc ) polarization , but ruffled profoundly , exhibiting large , highly mobile protrusions , as visualized by actin and tubulin staining ( figure 4a , movie s1 , s2 ) .

cells were left untreated or treated with lt , catalytically inactive lt ( e687c ) , 3inh combination , or inhibitors for mkk1 / 2 ( u0126 ) , p38 ( sb203580 ) or jnk ( jnkii ) for 48 h before the scratch was performed .
scale bar represents 100 microm .
( e ) quantification of experiment shown in ( d ) .
data ( mean +/ - sem ) are represented as width of the wound of 4 - 8 different areas with 2 inserts / condition .
the overall analysis of variance between all groups was highly significant : f6,604 = 675.4 , p < 0.0001 .
lt was efficiently taken up into lung epithelial cells grown in 2d and 3d conditions , cleaving mkk1 - 7 ( except mkk5 ) in 1 - 2 hours as observed in other cell types .
even after 48 hours of incubation with lt , mkk cleavage was sustained and mkk proteins could not be detected ( figure s3b - c ) .
as reported earlier in macrophages [ 18 ] , this loss of mkks is not due to reduced mkk transcription ( figure 3d ) .
as mapks have been implicated in cytoskeletal dynamics and their upstream signaling partners mkks represent the only identified lt targets , we reasoned that the striking , lt - induced cell morphology changes could be triggered by lt - mediated disabling of the erk , jnk or p38 pathway .
inhibition of these signaling cascades can be mimicked by incubation with chemical inhibitors of the kinase activity of mkk1 / 2 ( u0126 ; for downstream erk1 / 2 inhibition ) , of jnk ( jnkii ) and of p38 ( sb203580 ) .
all three inhibitors altered the morphological phenotype and cell motility of lung epithelial cells , although jnk inhibition changed the cell shape in a distinct manner , leading to overall cell contraction .
the combined use of all three inhibitors , a treatment mimicking lt action on mapk activity , resembled closely the lt - induced phenotype ( figure 4b , movie s3 , s4 , s5 , s6 , s7 and s8 ) .
formation and orientation of a single stable protrusion together with the polarization of the mtoc is a prerequisite for directed migration .
the morphology observed in lung epithelial cells after lt exposure suggested defects in cell functions , which rely on directed migration such as chemotaxis or wound healing .
using growth factors as chemotactic stimulus , complete inhibition of lung epithelial cell migration through boyden chambers was observed when cells were treated with lt or the three inhibitor combination ( figure 4c ) .
both , untreated and lt - treated cells , were reseeded on fibronectin - coated filters for these experiments , since adherence on collagen or fibronectin matrix was not altered after exposure of cells to lt ( figure s3a ) .
in all conditions attachment to the top of the filter occurred similarly well .
polarized primary lung epithelial cell layers exhibit a rapid wound healing response where even a large wound closes in 18 - 22 hours .
scratch assays were performed on untreated or lt - treated epithelial layers , which were then compared to wounded 3d layers treated with mkk / mapk inhibitors ( figure 4d , 4e ) .
catalytically active lt inhibited wound closure , while an inactive lt mutant ( lt e687c ) had no effect .
application of mkk1 / 2 , jnk or p38 inhibitors in combination resembled the lt - induced block in wound healing , while each inhibitor by itself led only to partial inhibition .
role of rho gtpases in lt - mediated motility defects the changes in cytoskeletal and microtubule dynamics including the pronounced membrane ruffling of lt - treated cells suggested alterations in the activity of rho gtpases .
cdc42 , rac1 and rhoa have been well established as mediators of dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton , microtubule dynamics and junction maintenance in epithelial cells [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
the distinct protrusion and stress fiber formation may indicate aberrant rho gtpase activation by lt. thus , cell lysates from untreated and lt - treated lung epithelial cells were probed for rho gtpase activity using pulldown assays .
while rac1 and rhoa activity did not change , an increase in active gtp - bound cdc42 was observed ( figure s4a ) .
directed migration is dependent on tight spatio - temporal control and cycling between on and off states , and could be disrupted by locking cdc42 into the activated state .
although increased rhoa activity was not detected , we probed if inhibition of downstream effectors of rho , rock - 1 and mlck , could suppress some of morphological features of lt - treated cells .
the rock - 1 inhibitor y27632 rescued partially the lt - mediated increase of e - cadherin and the diffuse junction expansion , while the mlck inhibitor ml - 7 was ineffective ( figure s4c and data not shown ) .
however , y27632 did not prevent the lt - induced permeability increase in polarized 3d lung epithelium ( figure s4b ) .
the phosphorylation status of cofilin , a rock - 1 / pak target required for motility [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , was also analyzed .
untreated and lt - treated lung epithelial cells did not differ in their phospho - cofilin content ( data not shown ) .
rescue of migration defects by non - cleavable mkks emerging data implicate signaling by map kinases and mkk - containing scaffolds in cellular processes required for migration [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
as the combination of chemical inhibitors for all three mapk pathways reproduced the lt - induced phenotype in lung epithelial cells , mutants for all six , lt - targeted mkks were prepared .
the lt cleavage sites for mkks have been identified [ 25 ] and single or multiple mutations were introduced into wildtype mkks to destroy these sites .
transiently transfected mkk mutants were tested for expression , resistance to lt cleavage and their ability to relay exogenous signals to specific downstream mapks in lt - treated cells ( figure s5a ) .
non - cleavable mkks were cloned into gfp - coexpressing lentiviral vectors to virally transduce primary lung epithelial cells .
live cell imaging indicated that introduction of single mkk mutants did not rescue the lt phenotype ( data not shown ) .
in order to transduce cells stepwise with pairs of mkks required for signaling to erk1 / 2 , jnk , or p38 ( mkk1,2 ; mkk4,7 ; mkk3,6 ) selection and sorting of cells was necessary .
thus , immortalized human lung epithelial cells ( sale ) were used , which have been extensively characterized in the laboratory and show many of the hallmarks of primary lung epithelial cells .
sale cells transduced with gfp in combination with non - cleavable mkks ( figure s5b ) were subjected to a wound healing assay in 2d cell culture conditions as only primary , low passage cells can differentiate to the typical multicellular , polarized epithelial layers .
in these conditions , expression of all three mkk pairs permitted efficient wound closure in lt - treated cells ( figure 5a ) .
we tested if chemotaxis in boyden chambers would be restored by expression of non - cleavable mkks .
only introduction of the non - cleavable mkk1,2 pair overcame the lt - induced block in directed migration ( figure 5b ) .
non - cleavable mkk3,6 expression slightly improved the lt - mediated inhibition of chemotaxis , but was clearly less effective .
time - lapse videomicroscopy confirmed that expression of the mkk1 / mkk2 mutant pair , which cannot be altered by lt and maintains its ability to signal to mkk1,2 targets including erk1,2 , restored reorientation of the mtoc , leading edge formation and motility ( figure 5c , movie s9 , s10 , s11 and s12 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0004755.g005 figure 5 lt - mediated migration defects are mkk - dependent .

partial rescue of barrier function by keratinocyte growth factor and dexamethasone extensive denudation of the lung epithelium will not occur during anthrax infection .
as shown , lung epithelial cells ceased to proliferate , but did not succumb to extensive cell death ( figure s2b ) .
the lt - induced decrease in barrier function is likely caused by expulsion of single cells from the layer , which cannot be repaired due to the mechanical stiffness and motility defects caused by mkk cleavage .
in accord , inhibition of mkk / mapk signaling by chemical compounds was not pro - apoptotic , but reduced barrier integrity ( figure 6a ) .
as lt inhibitors are not yet available and introduction of non - cleavable mkk1,2 is not a viable treatment option , a screening for barrier - protective drugs was initiated .
compounds , which have been used successfully for treatment of lung epithelial injury were tested for their ability to protect barrier integrity during lt exposure [ 26 ] - [ 28 ] .
two compounds , keratinocyte growth factor ( kgf ) and dexamethasone , rescued barrier function significantly ( figure 6b - c ) .
both compounds did not alter lt - induced changes of the cytoskeletal or microtubule network in 2d conditions ( data not shown ) .
we reasoned that if less cells would be expelled from the epithelial layer , the disruption of multicellular junctions would be reduced , even if lt - paralyzed motility had not been restored .
supporting this hypothesis , kgf and to a lesser degree dexamethasone reduced lt - mediated epithelial cytotoxicity considerably ( figure 6d ) , and thus seem to protect barrier integrity of the lung epithelium by extending cell survival .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0004755.g006 figure 6 keratinocyte growth factor and dexamethasone partially rescue lung barrier function by reducing cell death .
( a ) permeability measurements were performed in the ex vivo differentiated nhbe treated with or without lt ( 1 microg / ml lf / pa ) , a three inhibitor combination ( 3inh / u0126 , sb203580 , jnkii ) or catalytically inactive lt ( 1 microg / ml lf e687c / pa ) for 48 h .
( b - d ) polarized nhbe layers were treated for 1 h with kgf ( 250 ng / ml ) or dexamethasone ( 10 microm ) before lt ( 1 microg / ml ) was added for 48 h. layers were analyzed for resistance ( b ) , permeability ( c ) and ldh release ( d ) .
data ( a - d ) are represented as mean +/ - sem of 3 inserts / condition .
the overall analysis of variance in a - d between all groups was highly significant : ( a ) f3,10 = 145.6 , ( b ) f5,19 = 22.6 , ( c ) f5,12 = 36.4 , ( d ) f5,12 = 63.3 , p < 0.0001 .
discussion in this study , the effect of long term exposure of lung epithelium to b. anthracis lethal toxin , which enters every mammalian cell type and acts by blocking intracellular mkk - mapk signaling cascades permanently , was determined .
mkk - mapk pathways mediate crucial signals from the extracellular milieu to gene transcription , thus affecting cell proliferation , apoptosis , differentiation and inflammatory mediator release .
accumulating evidence suggests that mapks might also control cell migration , although the precise mechanism remains obscure [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
after 24 hours of lt exposure , complete mkk1 - 7 ( except mkk5 ) deficiency was observed in lung epithelial cells , which was maintained over the observation period of up to 4 days .
lt - mediated cytoskeletal alterations , present after the first 24 hours , were sustained even when a depolymerization / repolymerization cycle was induced by addition and subsequnent removal of depolymerizing agents .
the presence of multiple overlapping cytoskeletal targets , which control actin and microtubule dynamics indicate that coordinated input from all three major mapk pathways might be important for maintenance of cell shape and motility .
the distinct morphological and functionally paralyzed phenotype caused by exposure of primary human lung epithelial cells to lt supports this notion .
some networks involved in motility may have redundancy , as the successful 2 - dimensional wound closure by three different pairs of non - cleavable mkks suggests .
on the other hand , introduction of single non - cleavable mkks into lung epithelial cells was not sufficient for reversal of paralyzed actin and microtubule networks .
thus , one may speculate that mkk1 and mkk2 may trigger not only erk1 and erk2 signaling pathways .
mkks may participate in interactions with molecules essential for connecting membrane dynamics with actin assembly such as cortactin or mp1 [ 24 ] , [ 29 ] .
the morphological phenotype of lt - treated lung epithelial cells showed mechanical stiffness of the cell body with increased f - actin content and redistributed focal adhesion proteins in concert with highly dynamic , randomly oriented protrusions .
upregulation of beta - actin by lt was also reported by comparative proteomics studies on mouse macrophages [ 30 ] .
in contrast , fmlf - stimulated f - actin filament assembly was reduced in lt - treated neutrophils [ 10 ] .
the same group reported decreased actin assembly of listeria rocket tails in hela cells exposed to lt [ 11 ] , which was linked to defective actin monomer transport by hsp27 , a phosphorylation target of p38 mapk .
in our study , f - actin content was increased and introduction of non - cleavable mkks upstream of p38 mapk rescued 2 - dimensional lung epithelial wound healing only if signaling by both , mkk3 and mkk6 , was restored .
this rescue was not specific for the mkk3 / mkk6 pair and did not improve chemotaxis .
the cytoskeletal networks of neutrophils that are required for priming responses , polarization , and chemotaxis are quite distinct , and likely controlled by different signaling pathways than those important for cytoskeletal responses and junction formation in other cell types .
endothelial cells , which also form a tight barrier , seem to undergo cell elongation after lt treatment and succumb more or less to apoptosis [ 14 ] , [ 31 ] .
mkk / mapk signaling seems not to be required for all cytoskeletal remodeling processes .
for example , the actin reorganization required for phagocytosis was fully maintained in bone marrow - derived murine macrophages subjected to prolonged lt treatment ( strain c57bl / 6 ; unpublished observations ) .
the plasma membrane of lt - exposed lung epithelial cells showed multiple , highly active protrusions without formation of a leading edge or mtoc polarization .
development and extension of protrusions is under control of rho gtpases .
the observed enhancement of cdc42 activity in lt - treated cells might be a redistribution effect of signaling molecules , including unidentified cdc42 gaps , once mkks have been cleaved and degraded .
as gtpase cycling between the on and off state is essential for protrusion formation , this increase of cdc42 activity may cause deregulation of the cdc42 - gsk3 - apc pathway [ 32 ] .
blocking gsk - 3 leads to randomly oriented protrusions and inhibition of mtoc re - orientation [ 33 ] .
additionally , gsk - 3 - mediated phosphorylation of the focal adhesion protein paxillin is erk - dependent [ 34 ] .
deregulation of the cdc42 - gsk - 3 pathway by lt intoxication is supported by observations that gsk - 3 protein levels decrease considerably in lt - treated macrophages [ 35 ] .
introduction of non - cleavable mkk1 and mkk2 into lung epithelial cells restored normal protrusion formation and migration towards a chemotactic gradient , suggesting that the mkk1 / 2 - erk1 / 2 signaling axis serves as important upstream regulator of protrusion formation .
forming a tight barrier is one of the key functions of the lung epithelium .
assuming that our polarized lung epithelial cell model reflects the airway epithelium in vivo , our data suggest that this barrier will be destroyed by uptake of high lt quantities over a prolonged time during the final stage of anthrax infection .
in addition , the observed cytoskeletal changes will lead to an inability to repair the epithelium .
the initial damage seems not to be massive cell death and tight junction destruction , but rather expulsion of senescent single cells as observed as prerequisite for listeria invasion [ 36 ] .
in healthy conditions , rapid formation of new multicellular junctions will repair the damage and restore the barrier .
exposure to lt increases cytotoxicity and thus the expulsion rate , and hinders repair by mkk cleavage - induced inhibition of actin and microtubule dynamics in the neighboring lung epithelial cells .
treatment with kgf or the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone alleviated lt - mediated barrier damage significantly , thus providing a potential therapeutic option for anthrax victims .
both of these agents have previously been implicated in lung epithelial repair mechanisms [ 37 ] .
although we could not confirm direct effects of these drugs on cytoskeletal dynamics , our data point to a decrease in lt - induced cytotoxicity , specifically after kgf pretreatment , and thus to enhanced survival of lt - exposed polarized lung epithelial layers .
the respiratory distress of critically ill anthrax patients might be caused by lt - mediated breakdown of the respiratory barrier and influx of fluid into the lungs .
preventative therapy with kgf may strengthen the airway barrier and improve lung function .

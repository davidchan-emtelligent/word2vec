background we surveyed a population of injection drug users ( idus ) frequenting the mobile baltimore city needle exchange program ( bnep ) to investigate self - care factors associated with chronic wounds , a significant cause of morbidity especially among older idus .
methods participants >= 18 years old completed a survey regarding chronic wounds ( duration >= 8 weeks ) , injection and hygiene practices .
study staff visually verified the presence of wounds .
participants were categorized into four groups by age and wound status .
factors associated with the presence of chronic wounds in participants >= 45 years were analyzed using logistic regression .
results of the 152 participants , 19.7 % had a chronic wound. of those with chronic wounds , 18 were >= 45 years old ( 60.0 %) .
individuals >= 45 years old with chronic wounds were more likely to be enrolled in a drug treatment program ( odds ratio ( or ) 3.4 , 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 1.0 - 10.8 ) and less likely to use cigarette filters when drawing up prepared drug ( or 0.2 , 95 % ci 0.03 - 0.7 ) compared to the same age group without chronic wounds .
compared to individuals < 45 years old without chronic wounds , individuals >= 45 with a chronic wound were more likely to report cleaning reused needles with bleach ( or 10.7 , 95 % ci 1.2 - 93.9 ) and to use the clinic , rather than an emergency room , as a primary source of medical care ( or 3.4 , 95 % ci 1.1 - 10.4 ) .
conclusions older idus with chronic wounds have different , and perhaps less risky , injection and hygiene behaviors than their peers and younger idus without wounds in baltimore city .
because of these differences , older idus with wounds may be more receptive to community - based healthcare and substance abuse treatment messages .
keywords chronic wounds injection drug use aging harm reduction issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 background older injection drug users ( idus ) are a growing subgroup of active idus and idus seeking treatment [ 1 - 5 ] .
it is estimated that the number of adults 50 years or older with substance use problems will double from an annual average of 2.8 million ( 2002 - 06 ) to 5.7 million by 2020 [ 6 ] .
age - associated health complications and ongoing chronic drug use may further intensify the social marginalization of older idus , which may diminish quality of life , access to health care and social productivity [ 7 , 8 ] .
furthermore , injection drug use has been associated with accelerated biologic aging [ 9 , 10 ] and the premature onset of health conditions normally associated with aging [ 3 , 11 , 12 ] .
due to these life course differences and evidence that idus have higher overall mortality rates , older idus are of growing interest to public health researchers and are typically defined as individuals older than 40 - 50 years [ 13 , 14 ] .
overall , older idus report impaired mental and physical health and functioning compared to age - and gender - matched population standards [ 15 , 16 ] .
older idus often self - reported health conditions such as deep vein thrombosis , skin ulcers , respiratory problems , diabetes , hypertension , hepatitis , and liver cirrhosis [ 8 , 15 ] .
studies on venous damage and chronic venous insufficiency ( cvi ) in idus revealed that cvi develops prematurely in idus [ 11 , 12 ] .
certain risky injection drug use behaviors such as sharing needles , subcutaneous injection ( skin - popping ) , injecting a mixture of heroin and cocaine ( speedballing ) , using cigarette filters to draw up prepared drug , and injection under unhygienic conditions , have been linked to adverse outcomes such as abscesses , skin and soft tissue infections , injection site ulcers , and endocarditis [ 17 - 25 ] .
local and national public health authorities have implemented harm reduction measures to raise awareness and to educate idus regarding these risky behaviors .
however , efforts have not been focused on raising awareness of the long - term consequences of injection - related venous damage among idus , which can lead to cvi and lower extremity ulcers .
the effectiveness of these programs may also be attenuated by an individual 's severity of addiction , socio - cultural environment and prior exposure to harm reduction messages [ 5 ] .
some studies have determined that older idus who started injecting at a young age , as opposed to later in adulthood , were more likely to have high - risk injection practices including sharing of injection equipment and more frequent injection [ 26 , 27 ] .
in addition , the existing literature regarding the aging idu population focuses on general physical and mental health conditions or injection - related behaviors [ 13 , 15 , 16 , 26 - 29 ] .
the injection behaviors and socio - demographic characteristics of idus living with chronic wounds have not been well explored , even though chronic wounds are a significant health concern among older active or former idus .
we examined the prevalence of chronic wounds and associated injection - related behaviors among an idu population accessing needle exchange services from the baltimore city mobile needle exchange program ( bnep ) , which has been in operation since 1994 [ 30 ] .
we were interested specifically in determining whether there were distinctions between the demographics and behaviors of older idus living with chronic wounds as compared to their peers and younger idus .
an improved understanding of the behaviors of older idus may help inform prevention strategies and both skin - and drug - related treatment efforts for individuals living with chronic wounds .
methods we conducted a cross - sectional study among active idu participants of the bnep , age >= 18 years , regardless of wound status .
data collection occurred between may 2012 and november 2013 and was conducted at five different exchange sites , though most participants were from site a and site b , which were 1.9 miles apart and demographically distinct .
site a is frequented primarily by african americans and site b is frequented primarily by caucasians .
site c was near several local exotic dance clubs and was geographically separate from sites a and b. all participants provided written , informed consent and completed a paper - administered survey including questions addressing demographics , injection behaviors , pre - injection skin care , wound history , wound care , and general medical history .
surveys required approximately 20 minutes and upon completion , participants were given a $ 10 gift card for local businesses .
chronic wounds were defined as open areas on the skin that had been present and non - healing for >= 8 weeks .
study team members visually verified the presence of chronic wounds at the time of the survey .
this study was approved by the johns hopkins medicine institutional review board .
participants were stratified into four groups by reported age (< 45 years or >= 45 years ) and wound status ( presenting with a current chronic wound or without a current chronic wound ) .
the primary outcome was considered the presence of a chronic wound among participants >= 45 years .
this outcome was independently compared to three distinct reference groups : 1 ) participants < 45 years without chronic wounds ; 2 ) participants >= 45 years without chronic wounds ; 3 ) participants < 45 years with chronic wounds .
all variables were categorical except for age and number of times a needle was used , which were continuous variables .
predictor variables associated with the primary outcome group were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression .
odds ratios predicting risk of outcomes of interest with 95 % confidence intervals were assessed .
t - tests were used to compare means and / or proportions .
p values <= 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
statistical analysis was performed using stata 12 ( statacorp , college station , tx ) .
results a total of 152 individuals were surveyed .
the overall prevalence of chronic wounds was 19.7 % ( n / n = 30 / 152 ). of the 152 individuals , 73 were younger than 45 years ( 48.0 %) and 79 were aged 45 years or older ( 52.0 %). of those with chronic wounds , 12 were in individuals younger than 45 years ( 40.0 %) and 18 were in individual aged 45 years or older ( 60.0 %) ( p = 0.121 ) .
we focused our analysis on the latter subgroup of participants : idus who were 45 years of age or older with at least one current chronic wound .
this group accounted for 11.8 % of all study participants ( 18 / 152 ) .
within the particular subgroup of interest ( idus age >= 45 years with chronic wound ( s )) , the median age was 55 years with an interquartile range ( iqr ) of 46 - 58 .
the participants were primarily male ( 61.1 %) , african american ( 72.2 %) , reported having stable housing ( 94.4 %) , and had a self - reported hiv prevalence rate of 27.8 % ( 5 / 18 ) .
they reported long histories with injection drug use , most having injected for greater than 15 years ( 94.4 %) .
the most frequently reported injection behaviors included daily heroin injection ( 72.2 %) , daily speedball injection ( 55.6 %) , leg injection ( 61.1 %) and cleaning the injection site with alcohol before injecting ( 72.2 %). of the nine participants who reported reusing their needles ( 9 / 18 , 50.0 %) , seven of eight reported cleaning their needles with bleach prior to reuse ( 87.5 %) .
older idus with chronic wounds also reused their needles less frequently compared to their peers without wounds ( p = 0.021 ) and compared to younger idus without wounds ( p < 0.001 ) .
see table 1 for additional information on demographics , injection practices and medical history for all participants , participants in the outcome group ( idus age >= 45 years with chronic wound ( s )) , and participants in the three reference groups .

discussion the high prevalence of chronic wounds in our community - recruited idu study population ( 19.7 %) and the disproportionate overrepresentation of older idus with chronic wounds ( 60 %) suggests the need for focused interventions to improve awareness of injection - related venous damage and chronic wounds in idus to better prevent and treat this condition .
upon comparing older idus with chronic wounds to their same - aged peers without chronic wounds and to younger idus with and without wounds , this group of older individuals with wounds appeared to engage in behaviors that were more consistent with self - care habits and less - risky injection practices .
for example , they were more likely to have stable housing , use a clinic rather than an emergency room as the primary source of medical care , participate in a drug treatment program , clean needles with bleach , and clean their injection site with alcohol before injection .
they were also less likely to have been recently in jail or prison , or to have used cigarette filters to draw up prepared drug .
use of cigarette filters , rather than needle exchange - distributed packed cotton filters , is considered riskier behavior and generally discouraged by harm reduction advocates because it is less effective at filtering particles out of the drug and can be associated with endocarditis or phlebitis [ 23 , 31 ] .
it is possible that older idus with wounds are in a different stage of life , as they have survived for many years with substance abuse issues and have perhaps learned to cope with their substance abuse and chronic health conditions better than younger idus .
it remains to be determined if these differences in behaviors surrounding injection and cleanliness are a result of living with a chronic wound , maturing as an injection drug user and / or the internalization of the syringe exchange program 's ongoing harm reduction messages and education .
older idus with wounds were more likely to be african american even after adjusting for exchange site .
in contrast , younger idus were more likely to be caucasian .
these findings may be a reflection of the drug use patterns in baltimore city and at the bnep sites that were surveyed .
this suggests that there are racial and / or socio - cultural differences among younger caucasian idus that may lend preference for certain , and perhaps riskier , injection - related and other destabilizing behaviors that may lead to increased rates of homelessness and incarceration , among other factors , that we observed in this analysis .
understanding these differences within local subgroups of an idu population may facilitate more targeted harm reduction efforts .
other findings from this study are consistent with a population engaged in long - term injection drug use , which can lead to venous scarring and venous disease .
as idus mature in their injection drug use habits , there may be increasing reliance on injecting into veins in other locations such as the leg or neck , as we observed among the older idus with wounds .
chronic wounds appear to be associated with prolonged drug use , even among the younger idus , as the majority of younger idus with chronic wounds had also been injecting for at least 15 years .
injecting into the leg together with prolonged injection drug use , resultant venous damage and physiologic aging of the veins , likely puts older idus at heightened risk for both cvi and lower extremity ulcers [ 32 ] .
our study had limitations .
participants were active members of the bnep , and therefore they may report different injection and skin care practices than idus not accessing community - based harm reduction services and education .
the survey also relied upon self - reported data .
additionally , there were limitations associated with the small sample size of individuals with chronic wounds , however the overall cohort size and survey design was sufficient to characterize some behaviors as truly distinct in the population with chronic wounds .
despite these potential limitations , we report for the first time self - care behaviors among older idus living with chronic wounds in a mobile metropolitan needle exchange program in baltimore city .
conclusions our findings suggest that older idus with chronic wounds have different , and perhaps less risky , injection and hygiene practices than their peers and younger idus without wounds .
moreover , older idus with chronic wounds may represent a different demographic among those using illicit substances and a distinct idu subgroup that may be more receptive to local healthcare and / or substance abuse treatment messages .
this subgroup may also be more likely to engage in meaningful relationships and therapeutic alliances with medical providers to address drug use and / or health conditions previously neglected .
future public health and harm reduction interventions to raise awareness of the known associations between injection practices , venous damage , and chronic wounds among idus who have recently initiated injecting and among idus who have a prolonged injection history may represent valuable measures to prevent long - term wound - associated morbidity and disability .
harm reduction programs should consider including such educational information and referrals to local wound care centers in their regular encounters with idus .

introduction since the emergence and first practical use of concrete as a building material in the late nineteenth century , concrete has become one of the most versatile and widely produced materials in the world .
increasing population and living standards in both developing and developed countries will lead to an ever increasing demand for concrete materials .
it has been predicted that concrete will continue to be the most popular industrial material [ 1 ] .
nevertheless , memorable structures , such as dams of hydroelectric plants , bridges crossing rivers and lighthouses are intended to serve for centuries while being destined to perpetually expose to various attacks by their surroundings .
concrete has the potential to be damaged if it is subjected to freeze - thaw cycles .
the american concrete institute ( aci ) has established specifications for the protection of concrete placed during cold weather .
the aci defines cold weather as period when more than three successive days have a mean daily air temperature less than 40 f ( fahrenheit ) .
it is thus important to fully understand the mechanical characteristics [ 2 ] of plain concrete after freeze - thaw cycles in order to predict the structural response and the structure life .
the freezing and thawing durability [ 3,4,5 ] of concrete is of the utmost importance in countries with subzero temperature conditions , such as the aa zone , russia , northern europe and china , etc .

bertil persson [ 7 ] outlined laboratory and analytical studies of salt frost scaling and internal frost resistance of self - compacting concrete that contains an increased amount of filler , different air content and dissimilar methods of casting .
cheng et al .
[ 8 ] investigated the influence of freeze - thaw cycles on the compressive strength , flexural strength and cleavage strength of plain concrete .
qin [ 9 ] investigated the strength and deformation characteristics of plain concrete under uniaxial and multiaxial compression after different cycles of freeze - thaw , the influence of stress ratio and number of freeze - thaw cycles on the strength and strain were then analyzed .
gokce et al .
[ 10 ] introduced some information about freezing and thawing resistance when air - entrained or non - air - entrained concrete is used as recycled coarse aggregate in air - entrained concrete .
the dynamic modulus of elasticity and weight loss were the main focus for most previous research on plain concrete suffering from freezing and thawing cycles .
these studies , however , did not provide information on the strength and deformation of concrete under uniaxial compressive stress states , especially information on the strength and deformation of the concrete specimens under uniaxial tensile stress states .
hence , this paper studied the compressive strength , tensile strength , cleavage strength , flexural strength and the ultrasonic velocity of plain concrete specimens with water - cement ratio 0.55 after different cycles of freeze - thaw according to the test method of long - term and durability on ordinary concrete gb / t 50082 - 2009 [ 11 ] .
2. experimental procedures 2.1 .
materials and mix proportions in this investigation , local materials were utilized .
a chinese standard ( gb175 - 2007 ) [ 12 ] type i 425 # portland cement ( which has standard compressive strength of 42.5 mpa at the age of 28 days ) was used .
natural river sand with fineness modulus of 2.6 was used .
coarse aggregate was a crushed stone with diameters between 5 mm and 10 mm. the mix proportions is as follows : cement ( 360 kg / m3 ) , sand ( 611 kg / m3 ) , coarse aggregate ( 1241 kg / m3 ) , water ( 198 kg / m3 ) .
the mixing was accomplished after putting all the coarse and fine aggregate into the mixer .
these ingredients were mixed for about one minute , then the water was added within one minute .
the mixing continued for about two minutes after all water was added. and then the air content ( it was 1.9 %) was measured .
2.2 .
samples and testing programs concrete prisms with size of 100 mm x 100 mm x 100 mm ( to determine the compressive strength , tensile strength and cleavage strength ) and 100 mm x 100 mm x 400 mm ( to determine the weight , the dynamic modulus of elasticity and flexural strength ) were cast in steel molds .
the major stress direction was always applied to surface which was perpendicular to the ground surface .
all cast specimens ( the number of the test specimens is 106 ) were compacted through external vibration and demolded 24 h later .
thereafter , all the specimens were cured in a condition of 20 +/ - 3 degreesc and 95 % relative humidity ( rh ) for 23 days .
some of the specimens ( the number of the specimens was 85 ) were then immersed in water for 4 days prior to the freeze - thaw cycles .
the freeze - thaw cycling test was performed following the test method of long - term and durability on ordinary concrete gb / t 50082 - 2009 at the age of 28 days .
the temperature of concrete samples was controlled by a pt sensor embedded in the center of the concrete sample .
the temperature of the sample center ranged from - 17 +/ - 2 degreesc to 8 +/ - 2 degreesc .
in a single cycle , the temperature of the specimens cools from 6 degreesc to - 15 degreesc and then warmed to 6 degreesc all within 2.5 - 3 h in water .
the compressive strength , tensile strength , stress - strain curve , dynamic modulus of elasticity and weight loss of the specimens were tested and recorded at 0 , 15 , 25 , 40 , 50 freeze - thaw cycles .
at least three specimens were measured for each testing item .
three layers of butter and three layers of plastic membranes were used as a friction - reducing pad when compressive strength was tested .
the tensile tests were conducted in a special triaxial testing machine [ 13 ] ( designed by state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering , dalian university of technology ) that is capable of developing independent compressive or tensile force and can have random ratios .
the testing of the specimens can be carried out by strain - control , and the loading speed was 0.002 mm per second .
the loads were applied by means of the loading jacks operated by air hydraulic pumps .
the jacks were equipped with spherical , self - aligning heads to obtain uniform distribution of stress on the specimens .
the tensile strength was measured according to the loading mode in [ 14 ] .
3. results and discussions 3.1 .
failure modes figure 1 shows the failure modes of plain concrete under uniaxial compressive and cleavage load .
the splitting tensile strain along the unload plane ( s ) was the cause of failure for both .
it was obvious that the influence of freeze - thaw cycles on plain concrete did not change the splitting tensile mode from occurring according to the experiment .
there was no great change in the failure modes for plain concrete specimen after freeze - thaw cycles .
the tensile strain will be caused in the direction of free surface because of the action of compressive load or cleavage load , and the crack forms when the tensile strain was larger than the ultimate tensile strain of the specimen .
it was noticed that the cracks on the loaded surface have a random direction because of the influence of coarse aggregates .
the failure mode of the specimens under tension load or cleavage load was always instantaneous , controlled by a single crack propagating rapidly at the center of the specimen .

the relative dynamic modulus of elasticity and weight loss the parts of the relative dynamic modulus of elasticity ( rdme ) and weight loss of plain concrete of water - cement ratio 0.55 after accelerated freeze - thaw cycling tests are given in table 1 .
they were mean values of three specimens .
materials - 05 - 01698 - t001 _ table 1 table 1 the relative dynamic modulus of elasticity ( rdme ) and weight loss of plain concrete after different cycles of freeze - thaw .

the dynamic modulus of elasticity is the proportion of stress to strain when the stress is least under the action of dynamic loads .
the dynamic modulus of elasticity can be measured by means of longitudinal vibration or flexural vibration .
it reflects the elasticity performance of material , similarly to the initial tangential modulus under static loads .
the loss of the dynamic modulus of elasticity with freeze - thaw cycles means the loss of the elasticity performance .
the rdme is the ratio of the dynamic modulus of elasticity measured after a certain number of freeze - thaw cycles to the initial value prior to freeze - thaw cycles .
as table 1 shows : the rdme decreased to 46.8 % after 50 cycles of freeze - thaw .
equation ( 1 ) is the mathematic expression between the rdme and number of freeze - thaw cycles through analyzed the experimental results according to the least square regression method : ( 1 ) d = 100.9338 - 1.0675.n where d is the relative dynamic modulus of elasticity , n is the number of freeze - thaw cycles , correlation coefficient is 0.998 .
equation ( 2 ) gives the relationship between the weight loss and number of freeze - thaw cycles : ( 2 ) w = - 0.0666 + 0.0344.n where w is the weight loss after different cycles of freeze - thaw , correlation coefficient is 0.995 .
table 1 presents the computed results of the rdme and weight loss according the equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) respectively .
the weight loss of concrete specimens is caused by surface separation or scale off .
the rate of freeze - thaw cycling in the laboratory conditions was much higher than in the natural environment .
thus , it is reasonable that the scaling observed was more severe during the freeze - thaw cycles .
the reason is as follows : the weight variation of concrete was caused by water movement and surface separation .
concrete is a three - phase composite structure at microscopic scale , a mortar matrix , aggregate and the interfacial transition zone between the two .
microcracks exist at cement paste - aggregate interfaces within concrete even prior to any load and environmental effects .
in repeated cycles of freeze - thaw in a wet environment , water will enter the cracks during the thawing process of the freeze - thaw cycle .
if the mass of surface separation is larger than the water absorbed by the concrete specimens , the weight of the concrete specimens will decrease .
3.3 .
strength characteristics the tensile stress and the compressive stress were , respectively , calculated by dividing the tensile load and the compressive load by the area of loading section ( 0.01 m2 ) .
these values were then used in the analysis of the test results .
in this paper , compression is denoted as negative , tension as positive .
table 2 gives the parts of the compressive strength and tensile strength of plain concrete after different cycles of freeze - thaw .
they were mean values of three specimens .
materials - 05 - 01698 - t002 _ table 2 table 2 compressive strength and tensile strength of plain concrete after different cycles of freeze - thaw .

furthermore , after 75 cycles of freeze - thaw , it decreased to about 28.8 % of the initial tensile strength .
after 50 cycles of freeze - thaw , the compressive strength decreased to about 50.6 % of the initial compressive strength .
as the freeze - thaw cycles were repeated , the tensile strength and the compressive strength decreased .
the reason is as follows : the microcosmic cracks were caused after the action of freeze - thaw cycles , the direction and distribution of microcosmic cracks are stochastic .
the number of the microcosmic cracks increased and the width of the microcosmic cracks become broad as freeze - thaw cycles increased .
when the specimen is under the action of compressive loads , the cracks are caused in the direction parallel to the compressive load .
when the specimen is under the action of tensile loads , the cracks are caused in the direction vertical to the tensile load .
the effective area will become less with the initiation and growth of every new crack .
this reduction of the effective area further causes an increase in the stress concentration at critical crack tips .
the results were analyzed by the least square regression method , a mathematic expression between the tensile strength , compressive strength normal value and numbers of freeze - thaw cycles is given out : ( 3 ) ftd = 1.8684 - 0.0186.n where ftd is the tensile strength after different cycles of freeze - thaw , correlation coefficient is 0.979 .
( 4 ) fcd = - 19.775 + 0.1942.n where fcd is the compressive strength after different cycles of freeze - thaw , correlation coefficient is 0.998 .
the computed results of the tensile strength and compressive strength according to the equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) were given in table 2 .
table 3 gives the flexural strength and cleavage strength of plain concrete after freeze - thaw cycles .
the cleavage strength can be drawn through the equation as following [ 15 ] : ( 5 ) fts = 2fpia = 0.637fa where fts denotes the cleavage strength , f is the failure load , a is the area under cleavage load .
the flexural strength can be drawn through the equation as following [ 15 ] : ( 6 ) fctm = plbh2 where fctm denotes the flexural strength , p is the failure load , l is the span of support , b is the width of section of concrete specimen , h is the height of section of concrete specimen .
as seen from table 3 : the flexural strength and cleavage strength decreased to 54.1 % and 55.4 % of the initial value after 50 cycles of freeze - thaw respectively .
the results were analyzed by the least square regression method , a mathematic expression between the tensile strength , compressive strength normal value and numbers of freeze - thaw cycles is given out : ( 7 ) fctmd = 4.5865 - 0.039.n where fctmd is the flexural strength after different cycles of freeze - thaw , correlation coefficient is 0.959 .
( 8 ) ftud = 2.1278 - 0.020.n where ftud is the cleavage strength after different cycles of freeze - thaw , correlation coefficient is 0.988 .
the computed results of the flexural strength and cleavage strength according the equations ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) were given in table 3 .

stress - strain relationships figure 2 depicts the stress - strain curves of plain concrete specimens of water - cement ratio 0.55 suffering from different cycles of freeze - thaw under uniaxial compressive and tensile load .
it can be seen that the stress - strain curves of concrete under uniaxial compression went flat as the freeze - thaw cycles increased , the peak value of strain increased with freeze - thaw cycles increased .
while for plain concrete specimens of water - cement ratio 0.55 under uniaxial tension , the peak value of strain decreased with freeze - thaw cycles increased .

3.5 .
ultrasonic velocity ultrasonic velocity is the speed at which sound travels through a given material .
it is affected by density and elasticity .
velocity remains constant in a given material .
after 0 , 25 , 50 , 75 , 100 cycles of freeze - thaw , the decreasing percentage of the ultrasonic velocity is 100 % , 92.08 % , 85.45 % , 72.69 % and 61.65 % respectively .
it can be seen the ultrasonic velocity decreased as freeze - thaw cycles were repeated .
4. discussion after 50 cycles of freeze - thaw , the rdme decreased to 46.8 % , while the compressive strength , tensile strength , flexural strength and cleavage strength decreased to about 50.6 % , 43.5 % , 54.1 % and 55.4 % of the initial value , respectively .
according to gb / t 50082 - 2009 and the astm c666 standard test [ 16 ] , the specimen reaches failure if the rdme dropped to 60 % or less , or its weight loss exceeded 5.0 % .
however , it can be seen that this criterion for failure of concrete may be not appropriate according to the experimental data .
the experimental data within this paper is in agreement with the data in references [ 8 ] and [ 9 ] ( it is not suitable to take the rdme decreased to 60 % and weight loss decreased 5 % as the damage criterion for plain concrete suffers from freeze - thaw cycles according to the testing result .
the experimental results of strength should be considered. ) .
namely , the loss of strength exceeds 60 % of the initial value when the rdme decreased to about 60 % .
the effect of freeze - thaw cycles on the dynamic modulus of elasticity , compressive strength , tensile strength , flexural strength and cleavage strength compressive strength is presented in figure 3 .
figure 3 relationship between change of strength , rdme and number of freeze - thaw cycles .
concrete is a three - phase composite structure at microscopic scale , a cement matrix , aggregate and the interfacial transition zone between the two .
on the other hand , in considering the concrete specimen under the compressive load , tensile load , cleavage load , the initiation and growth of every new crack , the load carrying area will be reduced .
this reduction in load carrying area causes a further increase in the stress concentration at critical crack tips .
the effective area becomes thus little when the specimen suffers from compressive load , tensile load , cleavage load and the concentration of stress is caused again .
the strength decreased as freeze - thaw cycles increased .
5. conclusions based on the experimental work in this study and the discussion about the test results , the following conclusions can be drawn : ( 1 ) the compressive strength , tensile strength , flexural strength and cleavage strength decreased as the freeze - thaw cycles increased .
the loss of compressive strength and tensile strength after the action of freeze - thaw cycles was evident .
according to gb / t 50082 - 2009 [ 11 ] , the concrete specimen failed if its rdme dropped to 60 % or less , or if its weight loss exceeded 5.0 % , but this metewand may be not appropriate according to the experimental data .
the strength guidelines should be taken into account .
( 2 ) the stress - strain curves of concrete under uniaxial compression went flat as the freezing and thawing cycles increased .
the peak value of strain under uniaxial compression increased with freeze - thaw cycles increased , while the peak value of strain under uniaxial tension decreased with freeze - thaw cycles increased .
( 3 ) the results will help enable structure design and maintenance by considering the freeze - thaw durability of concrete .
therefore , in deciding the damages in concrete caused by freezing , the study of the ice formation process in concrete pores is critical .

background signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( stat3 ) is a transcription factor that regulates various cellular processes such as cell survival , angiogenesis and proliferation .
in the present study , we examined that betulinic acid ( ba ) , a triterpene from the bark of white birch , had the inhibitory effects on hypoxia - mediated activation of stat3 in androgen independent human prostate cancer pc - 3 cells .
methodology / principal findings ba inhibited the protein expression and the transcriptional activities of hypoxia - inducible factor - 1alpha ( hif - 1alpha ) under hypoxic condition .
consistently , ba blocked hypoxia - induced phosphorylation , dna binding activity and nuclear accumulation of stat3 .
in addition , ba significantly reduced cellular and secreted levels of vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , a critical angiogenic factor and a target gene of stat3 induced under hypoxia .
furthermore , ba prevented in vitro capillary tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) maintained in conditioned medium of hypoxic pc - 3 cells , implying anti - angiogenic activity of ba under hypoxic condition. of note , chromatin immunoprecipitation ( chip ) assay revealed that ba inhibited binding of hif - 1alpha and stat3 to vegf promoter .
furthermore , silencing stat3 using sirna transfection effectively enhanced the reduced vegf production induced by ba treatment under hypoxia .
conclusions / significance taken together , our results suggest that ba has anti - angiogenic activity by disturbing the binding of hif - 1alpha and stat3 to the vegf promoter in hypoxic pc - 3 cells .
introduction signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( stat3 ) is one of stat protein family and constitutively active in a wide range of human cancer cells [ 1 ] .
activated stat3 proteins by cytokines and growth factors form homo - or heterodimers , and then translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus , where they are binding to the promoter of various gene products involved in anti - apoptosis ( bcl - 2 , bcl - xl and survivin ) , proliferation ( cyclin d1 ) , and angiogenesis ( vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf )) [ 2 ] .
interestingly , recent studies reported that stat3 is activated in response to hypoxia , a common feature of various solid tumors [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
activated stat3 mediates the up - regulation of hypoxia inducible factor alpha ( hif - 1alpha ) , a major regulator to adapt under hypoxic conditions by increasing its stability and transcriptional activity [ 5 ] .
thus , recently stat3 and hif - 1alpha are attractive target molecules by natural compounds and herbal extracts in cancer research .
betulinic acid ( ba ) , initially reported as a human melanoma - specific inhibitor , is a triterpenoid mainly derived from the bark of the white birch ( betula pubescens ) [ 6 ] .
recent evidences suggest the anti - cancer effects of ba [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , anti - inflammatory [ 9 ] and anti - viral [ 10 ] activities via various signaling pathways such as epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) [ 11 ] , hedgehog [ 12 ] , signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( stat3 ) [ 13 ] and nuclear factor - kappa b ( nf - kappab ) [ 14 ] .
nonetheless , there is no evidence that ba mediates anti - cancer activity through inhibiting stat3 signaling in solid tumors .
thus , in the present study , we investigated the roles of stat3 and hif - 1 alpha in ba induced anti - angiogenic activity in hypoxic pc - 3 prostate cancer cells by mtt assay , western blotting , immunocytochemistry , elisa and emsa .
results cytotoxic effect of betulinic acid ( ba ) against pc - 3 cells cytotoxic effect of ba ( fig. 1 ) was evaluated by mtt assay .
pc - 3 cells were treated with various concentrations of ba ( 0 , 12.5 , 25 , 50 or 100 microm ) for 24 h. cell viability was reduced to 78.49 +/ - 5.67 and 62.64 +/ - 1.26 % at concentrations of 12.5 and 25 microm , respectively , and sustained to ~ 60 % at over 25 microm ( fig. 2a ) .

( a ) pc - 3 cells were treated with various concentrations of ba ( 0 , 12.5 , 25 , 50 or 100 microm ) for 24 h. cell viability was analyzed by mtt assay .
( b ) cells were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 0.5 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 or 24 h. cell lysates were prepared and subjected to western blotting to determine the expression of hif - 1alpha .
( c ) cells were treated with or without ba ( 5 or 10 microm ) under normoxic or hypoxic condition for 4 h. cell lysates were prepared and subjected to western blotting to determine the expression of hif - 1alpha .
( d ) nuclear extract was prepared from the cells treated with ba ( 0 , 10 , 20 or 40 microm ) under normoxia or hypoxia for 4 h. hif - 1alpha transcription activity was measured by using transam hif - 1 transcription factor assay kit .

effect of betulinic acid ( ba ) on hypoxia - induced hif - 1alpha activation in pc - 3 cells hypoxia is a hallmark of solid tumors [ 15 ] and hif - 1alpha is a transcription factor that responses to hypoxia [ 16 ] .
to examine whether ba can affect hif - 1alpha induced by hypoxia , we first determined the best time point of hypoxia - induced hif - 1alpha expression in pc - 3 cells .
cells were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 0.5 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 or 24 h. hif - 1alpha expression was dramatically induced under hypoxic condition for 4 h ( fig. 2b ) .
then , cells were treated with or without ba under hypoxia for 4 h. ba decreased hypoxia - induced hif - 1alpha expression in a dose - dependent manner compared with hypoxia control ( fig. 2c ) .
in addition , hypoxia significantly activated hif - 1alpha transcription while ba treatment inhibited the hypoxia - mediated transcriptional activation of hif - 1alpha in a dose - dependent manner ( fig. 2d ) .
these results suggest that ba has the ability to inhibit the expression as well as transcription of hif - 1alpha in hypoxic pc - 3 cells .
effect of betulinic acid ( ba ) on hypoxia - induced stat3 activation in pc - 3 cells recent studies reported that a transcription factor stat3 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of hif - 1alpha [ 17 ] .
in our study , hypoxia enhanced phospho - stat3 level while normoxia did not affect it. ba treatment inhibited hypoxia - mediated stat3 phosphorylation in a dose - dependent manner ( fig. 3a ) .
also , emsa revealed that ba prevented the stat3 / dna binding activity under hypoxia in a dose - dependent manner ( fig. 3b ) .
furthermore , imunocytochemical ( icc ) staining with anti - hif - 1alpha antibody showed a significant nuclear expression of hif - 1alpha under hypoxic condition .
in contrast , ba treatment attenuated hif - 1alpha expression in the nucleus in hypoxic pc - 3 cells ( fig. 3c ) , suggesting its inhibitory effect on the nuclear translocation of hif - 1alpha .

dab ( brown ) and hematoxylin - eosin was used as a substrate and a counterstaining , respectively .
effects of betulinic acid ( ba ) on hypoxia - induced angiogenesis hypoxia is one of angiogenesis inducers through hif - 1alpha activation [ 18 ] .
thus , the inhibitory effect of ba was evaluated on hypoxia - mediated angiogenesis .
vegf , a critical angiogenesis factor [ 19 ] , was evaluated at the secreted cellular and protein levels by elisa and western blotting , respectively .
ba significantly reduced vegf production in a dose - dependent manner by elisa ( fig. 4a ) .

( c ) huvecs were treated with vegf ( 20 ng / ml ) as positive control or the culture supernatant from pc - 3 cells treated with or without ba ( 10 microm ) under normoxia or hypoxia .
tube formation assay was performed using growth factor reduced matrigel .
cells were fixed with diff - quick solution , photographed randomly under an axiovert s 100 light microscope at x100 magnification and counted .
additionally , huvec tube formation assay , which is known as a typical angiogenesis in vitro model , was performed to confirm anti - angiogenic effect of ba on hypoxia - mediated angiogenesis .
vegf was used as a positive control of angiogenesis induction .
huvecs mixed with the supernatants from pc - 3 cells were cultured in the absence or presence of ba under hypoxia .
as shown in fig. 4c , hypoxia - induced tube formation was prevented by ba treatment in pc - 3 cells while clear tube formation was exhibited in untreated control under hypoxia , suggesting that ba inhibits hypoxia - mediated angiogenesis .
effects of betulinic acid ( ba ) on the binding of stat3 and hif1 alpha to vegf promoter in hypoxic pc - 3 cells recent studies revealed that stat3 activation is directly link to the transcriptional regulation of vegf by binding to the vegf promoter [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
in light of this event , we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation ( chip ) assay .
as shown in fig. 5a , the binding activity of stat3 and hif - 1alpha to the vegf promoter was detected under hypoxia ( lanes 5 - 8 ) compared with normoxia ( lanes 1 - 4 ) .
notably , ba treatment suppressed the binding of stat3 and hif - 1alpha to vegf promoter in hypoxic condition ( lanes 9 - 12 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0021492.g005 figure 5 effect of betulinic acid ( ba ) on stat3 binding on the vegf promoter in hypoxic pc - 3 cells .
( a ) pc - 3 cells were treated with or without ba ( 10 microm ) under normoxia or hypoxia for 4 h. the immunoprecipitated dna with rabbit normal igg , hif - 1alpha or stat3 antibody was amplified by pcr analysis for vegf promoter .
( b ) cells were transiently transfected with sirna for scramble or stat3 for 24 h and treated with or without ba ( 10 microm ) for 18 h under hypoxia .
vegf levels in the culture supernatants were measured by using a quantikine vegf elisa kit .

# , p < 0.05 vs control , and * , p < 0.05 vs control sirna .
cell lysates were subjected to western blotting for phospho - stat3 , stat3 and hif - 1alpha .
in order to confirm the critical role of stat3 in anti - angiogenic regulation of ba in hypoxic pc - 3 cells , stat3 sirna transfection was carried out in pc - 3 cells .
treatment with either ba or stat3 sirna reduced the production of vegf by 39.6 % and 45.9 % respectively , compared with untreated control .
furthermore , ba treatment significantly reduced vegf production by 63.25 % in stat3 sirna - transfected pc - 3 cells ( fig. 5b ) .
western blotting revealed that sirna for stat3 , but not control , efficiently blocked stat3 ( fig. 5b ) .
discussion prostate cancer classified as an adenocarcinoma is the second most common malignant tumors in american men , with estimates of 192,280 new cases and approximately 27,360 deaths in 2009 [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
betulinic acid ( ba ) , a plant - derived pentacyclic lupane - type triterpenoid , can be extracted from various plants such as sarracenia flava [ 24 ] , diospyros spp. , inga punctata [ 25 ] , ziziphus spp. , and vauquelinia corymbosa [ 26 ] .
several groups reported anti - cancer activity of ba in various cancers including lung , colorectal , breast , prostate and cervical cancer [ 27 ] , but not normal cells [ 28 ] .
also , ba completely inhibited tumour growth without toxicity in athymic mice bearing human melanomas [ 6 ] .
moreover , anti - cancer activity of ba was exerted by inducing apoptosis in the cancer cells .
for example , ba - induced apoptosis was independent of p53 in neurorectodermal tumor [ 29 ] and melanoma cells [ 30 ] .
in neuroblastoma cells , ba induced apoptosis through loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential , reactive oxygen species ( ros ) production and caspase activation [ 31 ] .
interestingly , karna and colleagues recently reported that ba inhibited the expression of hif - 1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) in human endometrial cancer cells [ 32 ] .
however , the regulatory mechanisms whereby ba inhibits angiogenesis are not fully understood .
in the present study , we found that ba suppressed hypoxia - mediated protein accumulation , transcriptional activation and nuclear localization of hif - 1alpha in pc - 3 cells .
consistent with the results of karna 's paper , our data also showed that ba significantly inhibited vegf secretion and protein expression in hypoxic pc - 3 cells .
additionally , in vitro tube formation assay further confirmed anti - angiogenenic effect of ba in hypoxic pc - 3 cells .
recently , niu and colleagues suggested that constitutively activated stat3 up - regulated vegf and induced tumor angiogenesis [ 20 ] .
also , wei and colleagues reported that stat3 activation regulates the expression of vegf and human pancreatic cancer angiogenesis furthermore , several papers described the role of stat3 as a potential modulator of hif - 1alpha - induced vegf signaling in cancer cells [ 4 ] , [ 33 ] .
in this regard , the effect of ba on stat3 and hif - 1alpha activation was examined in hypoxic pc - 3 cells in our study .
consistent with the evidences by pandey and colleagues that ba suppressed stat3 activation in multiple myeloma cells [ 13 ] , ba prevented hypoxia - induced tyrosine phosphorylation , dna binding activity and nuclear translocalization of stat3 , suggesting the inhibitory effect of ba on stat3 activation .
vegf promoter contains various transcription factor binding sites including stat3 [ 20 ] as well as hif - 1 [ 34 ] .
physical interaction of stat3 with hif - 1 controls vegf transcriptional activation by their binding to the vegf promoter [ 4 ] .
in our study , hypoxia promoted the binding of stat3 and hif - 1alpha to the vegf promoter in pc - 3 cells .
in contrast , ba remarkably inhibited the binding of stat3 and hif - 1alpha to the vegf promoter site under hypoxic condition .
additionally , silencing stat3 using its specific sirna significantly enhanced ba - mediated inhibition of vegf production , implying the involvement of stat3 in anti - angiogenic regulation of ba in hypoxic pc - 3 cells .
similar to our study , gariboldi and colleagues reported that nvp - aew541 , a igfr1 inhibitor , disrupted igf / stat3 / hif1 pathway in human glioblastoma cells [ 35 ] .
leeman - neill and colleagues also reported that guggulsterone inhibited stat3 and hif - 1alpha and suggested a biologic rationale for further clinical investigation ba for human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( hnscc ) therapy [ 36 ] .
collectively , our data demonstrate that ba suppressed expression and transactivation of hypoxia - induced hif - 1alpha , stat3 , vegf as well as capillary tube formation in pc - 3 cells .
it is noteworthy that anti - cancer activity of ba is exerted by inhibiting angiogenesis via inhibition of binding of stat3 and hif - 1alpha to the vegf promoter in pc - 3 cells .
thus , our findings suggest that ba can be a potent anti - angiogenic agent by targeting stat3 / hif - 1alpha / vegf signaling for prostate cancer therapy .

the cells were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde solution for 10 min at room temperature and blocked in blocking buffer ( 10 % bsa / triton x - 100 in pbs ) containing 6 % horse serum for 1 h at room temperature .
the slides were incubated with anti - stat3 ( 1:100 ) antibody overnight at 4degreesc and then probed with anti - mouse or rabbit biotinylated antibodies ( vector labs , burlingame , ca ) for 1.5 h at room temperature .
the expression was detected by using vector abc complex / hrp kit ( vector labs , burlingame , ca ) and color - developed with 3,3 ' - diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride in dark .
the specimens were then counterstained with hematoxylin - eosin ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo ) and analyzed under a microscope ( leica microsystems res. , wetzlar , germany ) .

ship pi3k metastasis the src - homology - 2 - containing inositol - 5 ' - phosphatase , ship ( also known as ship1 ) , is a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( pi3k ) pathway by hydrolyzing the pi3k - generated second messenger phosphatidylinositol - 3,4,5 - triphosphate ( pip3 ) to pi - 3,4 - p2 .
ship expression is restricted primarily to hematopoietic cells , but has also been reported in mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) and osteoblasts [ 1 ] .
ship levels can be reduced by inactivating mutations , single nucleotide polymorphisms , or mir - 155 activity [ 2 ] , and ship expression decreases in the aging msc compartment of murine bone marrow , skewing hematopoiesis toward production of myeloid cells [ 1 ] and potentially leading to the development of myeloproliferative syndromes or myeloid neoplasms with age .
it is unknown whether ship levels change during the aging process in hematopoietic cells , although aberrant pi3k activity in human neutrophils increases with age , potentially via reduction in ship , and negatively impacts neutrophil migration and function [ 3 ] .
while reduction of ship has been associated with the development of leukemias and lymphomas [ 4 ] , the potential role of ship in solid tumor growth has received very little attention to date , likely because most researchers believe neoplasms derived from non - hematopoietic tissues should not be affected by ship status .
however , there is a great deal of evidence that normal cells in the stroma ( e.g. , fibroblasts , endothelial cells , inflammatory cells ) have a profound influence on the development and growth of solid primary tumors and tumor metastases .
stephen paget 's seed - and - soil hypothesis identified the soil in distant tissues as a key limitation of metastatic tumor growth , and recent evidence suggests that inflammatory cells may act as fertilizer for the metastatic soil , with aggregates of normal cells ( often derived from the bone marrow ) creating permissive niches that support future metastatic tumor growth in tissues [ 5 ] .
cells that suppress the immune response against tumor cells may be particularly important , with myeloid - derived suppressor cells ( mdscs ) , alternatively - activated m2 macrophages ( mphis ) , and regulatory t cells ( tregs ) often being elevated in tissues that support metastatic tumor growth .
expansion and activity of each of these immune suppressive cell types are known to be restricted by ship [ 4 ] and it stands to reason that loss of ship may lead to increased immune suppressive cell accumulation and activity in tissues , suppressed t - cell mediated anti - tumor immunity , and therefore increased metastatic tumor growth .
support for this concept comes from studies in which ship has been deleted in various mouse strains .
specifically , deleting ship from c57bl / 6 mice leads to runted mice that overproduce myeloid cells and die at 12 - 16 weeks of age from massive myeloid cell infiltration of the lungs [ 4 ] .
this myeloid infiltrate includes elevated numbers of hyper - responsive mast cells ( leading to increased histamine and th2 cytokines / chemokines in the lungs ) .
ship - / - c57bl / 6 mice are both m2 and th2 skewed , in part due to hyperactive basophils that constitutively produce il - 4 .
loss of ship dramatically increases myelopoiesis , which forces erythropoiesis out of the bone marrow and into the spleen , causing splenomegaly .
in addition , ship - / - c57bl / 6 mice possess an increased number of hyper - resorptive osteoclasts and reduced numbers of osteoblasts [ 1 ] , and consequently suffer from severe osteoporosis .
a critical feature of ship - / - c57bl / 6 mice is that their myeloid progenitors are significantly more responsive to low levels of cytokines , growth factors , and chemokines than their wild - type counterparts , which explains why ship - / - c57bl / 6 mice display enhanced myelopoiesis , with overproduction of granulocytes , mast cells , and m2 - skewed mphis .
in keeping with the presence of m2 - skewed mphis , we observed enhanced growth of lewis lung carcinoma primary tumours in ship - / - c57bl / 6 mice compared to wild - type mice [ 4 ] .
we recently reported that deleting ship in balb / c mice results in a much milder pathology than deleting ship in c57bl / 6 mice [ 6 ] ; this was surprising since balb / c mice are intrinsically more m2 / th2 skewed .
because of the milder pathology , ship - / - balb / c mice live a normal lifespan , without evidence of overt osteoporosis or wasting , and display only mild pulmonary inflammation , alveolar wall thickening and myeloid hyperplasia .
however , these mice do possess m2 - skewed mphis that are significantly more immunosuppressive than mphis from wild - type mice , and we have shown that highly suppressive m2 mphis within the lungs promote metastatic tumour growth [ 7 ] .
in keeping with these data , challenging ship - / - balb / c mice with metastatic 4t1 mammary carcinoma cells causes the mice to develop red and inflamed ears , paws and tails , dramatically lose weight , and die from necrohemorrhagic inflammatory pulmonary disease within 14 days of tumour implantation .
moreover , unlike tumor - free ship - / - balb / c mice , 4t1 tumor - bearing ship - / - balb / c mice possess mdscs that express arginase i and are far more immuno - suppressive than their wild - type counterparts .
importantly , while primary 4t1 tumor growth is not significantly different in wild - type and ship - / - balb / c mice , there are 7.5 - fold more metastatic tumor cells in the lungs of mice lacking ship .
our work demonstrates that ship represses the metastasis of mammary tumors in balb / c mice by restricting the development and immunosuppressive properties of myeloid cells [ 6 ] .
if ship expression and activity are indeed reduced during the aging process , the concomitant elevation in pi3k signaling in hematopoietic cells may predispose people to reduced neutrophil function , myelo - proliferative disorders , leukemias , and lymphomas .
our data suggest that reduction of ship also increases the risk of developing solid tumors and predisposes cancer patients to metastatic disease .
we have identified ship as a new player in solid tumor metastasis , and support future work to test activators of ship for the management of metastatic cancer .

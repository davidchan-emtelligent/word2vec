the epidemic of kuru is now known to have been transmitted among the fore by ritual consumption of infected organs from deceased relatives .
as cannibalism was suppressed by government patrol officers during the 1950s , most transmission had ceased by 1957 , when the kuru research programme first commenced .
as predicted in the 1960s , the epidemic has waned , with progressive ageing of kuru - affected cohorts over the years to 2007 .
the few cases seen in the twenty - first century , with the longest incubation periods , were almost certainly exposed as children prior to 1960 .
although the research programme had almost no role in bringing the kuru epidemic to an end , it did provide important knowledge that was to help the wider world in controlling the later epidemics of iatrogenic and variant creutzfeldt - jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy .
kuru creutzfeldt - jakob disease cannibalism 1 .
introduction in their invitation letter for the 2007 meeting , john collinge and michael alpers wrote : ' the epidemic of kuru may not be entirely over but the end is certainly in sight , with at most only one death expected during the year .
this is a cause for celebration ' .
the end of kuru celebrates the end of a tragedy for the fore , albeit one that is still deeply felt by those who lived through the epidemic .
we join all those at the london meeting in thanking michael alpers and john collinge for imagining that such a meeting could ever be possible , and for ensuring that so many fore were able to attend and to contribute to its success through their personal stories .
the scientific story of kuru has been summarized recently ( see collinge et al. ( 2006 ) and the papers included in this issue ) .
a detailed account of the early years of kuru research , highlighting carleton gajdusek 's personal history and involvement , will soon be published ( anderson in press ) .
table 1 gives an abbreviated timeline of early theories about kuru .
2. student beginnings i was still at high school in 1957 when gajdusek and zigas wrote their first paper on kuru ; in the years that followed , carleton was the main player in an all - consuming programme of research to understand its aetiology .
my small part in the story began in 1962 when as a medical student attending a walter and eliza hall institute ( wehi ) seminar i heard macfarlane burnet speak about kuru ; needless to say , it fired my youthful imagination .
burnet was a leading virologist and immunologist , and won the nobel prize in 1960 for the theory of acquired immunological tolerance .
gajdusek worked at wehi , where burnet was the director , before starting the kuru project ( see anderson ( in press ) for a detailed account of their interactions ) .
mac burnet encouraged me to read the published papers , and i corresponded with michael alpers in 1963 .
michael and i did not meet , however , until 1969 , because when i first went to papua new guinea in 1964 michael had moved to the national institutes of health to work with gajdusek .
burnet was also corresponding with p. r. j. burch , a radiation physicist in leeds who had developed mathematical models to explain the age - specific incidence of autoimmune and other chronic diseases ( burch 1963 ) .
burch went on to fit one of his models to the age incidence of kuru , and burnet showed me burch 's manuscript ; unfortunately , burch had misinterpreted the available data , thereby invalidating the model .
after this was pointed out , burch responded quickly by fitting a different model to correctly interpreted data .
i do not think burch 's paper on kuru was ever published , but the experience left me with a healthy respect for the pitfalls of modelling .
the irony is that in recent years i have taken up mathematical modelling in my own research ( mathews et al. 2007 ) .
burnet also spoke to me about the work of shirley glasse ( now lindenbaum ) , an australian anthropologist working with robert glasse on the ethnography of kuru ( glasse 1964 ) .
they had obtained details of the sorcery that was believed by the fore to be the cause of kuru .
however , the work of the glasses also suggested that kuru was of relatively recent origin , that it spread from place to place and that it might even be transmitted by cannibalism ( glasse 1962 , 1963 ; lindenbaum 1979 ) .
although michael alpers has recently introduced an alternative term , transumption , since the word ' cannibalism ' can be seen to be pejorative , i have used the older term , since it was the one in use at the time .
shirley was in melbourne in 1964 and , over tea in her parents' home , she showed me the genealogies of kuru - affected families that she and robert had collected during their fieldwork in 1961 - 1963. with shirley 's approval , i later obtained copies of the genealogies , and thought about ways to quantify the data that they had collected .
at the end of 1964 , after medical finals , it was arranged that i should travel to okapa and spend six weeks looking at the epidemiology of kuru with dick hornabrook , a queen square - trained neurologist from new zealand , who was oversighting the australian research effort on kuru .
dick and fay hornabrook made me feel very welcome ; i was enchanted by the landscape and the fore people , fascinated by the disease , but troubled by the impact it was having upon them ( figure 1 ) ; there was nothing that western medicine could do to help , and even the attempts to take care of the many kuru orphans at the awande lutheran mission were fraught with problems .
dick told me that by 1964 there were fewer cases of kuru among young children than had been reported by gajdusek & zigas ( 1957 ) ; similar trends were noted by alpers & gajdusek ( 1965 ) .
i was encouraged to connect the genealogical information from the glasses with the emerging changes in epidemiology .
early in my residency year at the royal melbourne hospital , the lancet published my quantitative analysis of the glasse genealogies and recent changes in kuru incidence ( mathews 1965 ) .
the glasse data showed very clearly that kuru was of very limited time depth , particularly in south fore villages .
families from purosa could recall many deaths from causes other than kuru in the years before 1920 , whereas the earliest deaths from kuru did not appear until ca 1930 .
informants also suggested that kuru was first noticed at uwami , near awande , and had taken some 20 years to reach purosa .
the obvious conclusion was that with such a recent origin for kuru , the particular genetic theory proposed by henry bennett ( bennett et al. 1958 , 1959 ) was probably wrong .
furthermore , the march of kuru was consistent with a slowly spreading infectious disease , with the possibility of vertical spread from mother to child to account for the ' early onset ' cases in children ; an implication was that the incubation period could be as long as the age of the children affected ( i.e. at least 4 years ) .
importantly , the age of the early onset cases seemed to be rising from year to year ( figure 2 ) .
burnet wrote an appendix to my lancet paper in which he developed the theory that kuru was caused by a hepatitis - like virus , introduced into the fore in the early decades of the twentieth century ( burnet 1965 ). that was the closest that i ever came to being a co - author on a paper with burnet , or for that matter with any nobel prize winner !
hadlow ( 1959 ) had pointed out the similarity of kuru and scrapie ; this observation , together with the glasses' research suggesting that kuru was spreading like a slowly transmissible disease , led gajdusek and colleagues to proceed to inoculation experiments in primates .
their persistence was vindicated in may 1965 when the first chimpanzee ( georgette ) developed symptoms of kuru , just 20 months after intracerebral inoculation with brain material from a human patient ( gajdusek et al. 1966 ) .
3. full - time in papua new guinea in early 1966 , i was employed by the public health department to succeed dick hornabrook as coordinator of australian kuru research in papua and new guinea .
coralie and i travelled to okapa via goroka , with our son in our arms , and a daughter on the way ( our two daughters were born in goroka hospital in 1966 and 1967 ) ; we quickly settled into a busy life marked by field trips into a beautiful but challenging environment ( figure 3 ) , by getting to know the friendly fore people and by the intriguing social interfaces between local people , researchers , the australian administrators and the many missionaries in the area .
for extended periods when no other medico was available , i was also responsible for medical and surgical care at the okapa hospital ; at such times , i was grateful for the old - style teaching from our obstetrics professor in melbourne about how to deal with an obstructed labour or death in utero ! with the wisdom of hindsight , i sometimes shudder at the other procedures that we were forced to undertake when it was not possible to evacuate patients to goroka .
we also had many scientific visitors , and coralie can tell many stories about looking after them amidst our growing family , helping with emergency operations in the okapa hospital and providing assistance on field trips and at autopsies .
my appointment in new guinea had been arranged by burnet but , as pointed out by warwick anderson , who has scrutinized the early correspondence and records , i was naively unaware of the political and personal tensions between gajdusek , burnet and the other players .
however , from my perspective , there was no alternative but to cooperate with gajdusek ; any other course would have seemed unethical .
we welcomed gajdusek and his colleagues into our home when they visited ; we were excited by his fund of stories , his drive and his intellect ; and we were inspired to work hard to meet his requirements for kuru data , additional biological samples from kuru patients and unaffected fore , and film footage. with ray spark , who joined in 1967 , and a group of fore assistants , we documented every new case of kuru and its clinical course , and obtained genealogical information and stories about the spread of kuru from family informants .
copies of all our fieldwork notes , clinical examinations and notes , genealogies and kuru stories , and most of the biological samples and film collected were sent to gajdusek 's laboratory in bethesda .
owing to continuing requests for biological samples ( blood and cerebrospinal fluid ) , and autopsy material , we felt that we were at risk of putting undue pressure on patients and their families to obtain the necessary consent .
we spent many hours explaining our research , and its objectives , and in building rapport , but it was never possible to be certain that consent , when it was given , was free of implied duress in a cross - cultural environment that was still very colonial .
a chapter of my md thesis ( mathews 1971 ) was devoted to the ethics and propriety of our research with the fore .
4. epidemiological studies supporting the cannibalism hypothesis gajdusek and zigas provided us with access to epidemiological details of all known kuru cases in the village file , for the era from 1957 to 1963 ; we added in the cases seen by hornabrook and myself , and checked the details against census data to complete the records through to early 1968 ; subsequent work by many people , but most particularly by michael alpers , has tracked the epidemic through to its dying stages , 50 years after the first cases were reported in the scientific literature ( alpers 2008 ) .
during our time among the fore , i used the available epidemiological data , together with my own genealogical data and ' kuru stories ' , to further test the specific predictions made by the genetic theory , by the ' slow virus' theory with horizontal and vertical transmission and by the cannibalism theory .
a paper in the papua new guinea medical journal ( mathews 1967a ) provided additional support for the epidemic spread of kuru .
it also showed that in the south fore , there had been almost no cases of kuru in children born since 1954 ; the average age of kuru cases was rising year by year , suggesting that vertical transmission , or transmission to young children , had ceased in the 1950s ( figures 2 and 4 ) .
this was hard to accommodate with the original genetic theory , but was consistent with cannibalism or other forms of transmission to women and children .
an obvious implication was that as the kuru epidemic matured , the average age of cases would continue to increase , with an eventual decline in overall incidence .
nevertheless , in that paper ( mathews 1967a ) , the genetic theory could be rescued as a possible explanation for some of the differences in the incubation period , coincidentally anticipating the effect of the codon 129 polymorphism ( collinge et al. 2006 ) .
the implications of horizontal transmission ( to explain kuru in adults ) and vertical transmission ( to explain kuru in children ) were further developed in another lancet paper ( mathews 1967b ) .
for sibships born before 1940 , there was a birth order effect for kuru in males and in females developing kuru before the age of 20 years ; the higher risk in later - born siblings was consistent with an acquired agent , but did not discriminate between direct transmission to the child and transmission through the mother .
brothers concordant for kuru tended to die at a similar age , suggesting exposure at a similar age rather than at a similar time .
kuru occurred at an earlier average age in women in later - born cohorts , suggesting that in the early stages of the epidemic females were exposed at a common time , rather than at a common age ; in the mature epidemic , the reverse may have applied .
the ages of male kuru cases , putting an upper limit on the lengths of presumptive incubation periods , ranged from 4 or 5 to 40 or more years .
this 1967 paper argued that it was possible to accommodate all the epidemiology with the idea that there was horizontal transmission to women , and vertical transmission to offspring , together with an increase in the incubation period over the maturing epidemic owing to stochastic variation , selection and / or differential genetic susceptibility .
nevertheless , that model had complex features .
robert glasse 's original hypothesis ( glasse 1963 , 1967 ) , that kuru was transmitted through the practice of eating relatives who had died from the disease , seemed simpler .
a major attraction of that theory was that as men rarely participated at cannibal feasts , there was a ready explanation for horizontal transmission being largely confined to women .
young children were exposed because they accompanied their mothers and also ate kuru - contaminated tissues , including brain ; this provided a simple explanation for ' vertical transmission ' or early onset kuru .
in a paper with robert glasse and shirley lindenbaum ( mathews et al .
1968 ) , we showed that the cannibalism theory was supported by a wealth of epidemiological and ethnographic evidence ; there were also consistent stories about named individuals who had taken part in ritual feasts and subsequently died themselves from kuru ( table 2 ) .
i later wrote up unpublished details of kuru fieldwork in my md thesis ( mathews 1971 ) and in a monograph edited by dick hornabrook ( mathews 1976 ) .
those data allowed kuru incubation periods to be estimated from the stories of known exposures of named individuals who subsequently developed kuru ( table 2 ) .
common exposure period analysis for pairs of affected relatives provided similar estimates , and supported the argument for post - natal transmission to males in early childhood. by assuming that affected brothers may have had a common exposure , it was possible to deduce a mean minimum age of exposure of 1 - 6 years for males , a mean minimum incubation period of 3 - 6 years and a mean maximum incubation period of 10 - 14 years for the era ( 1930 - 1967 ) covered by the data collected ( mathews 1971 ) .
clearly , the incubation period has increased subsequently with the ageing of kuru - affected cohorts .
perhaps the most important epidemiological observation was the disappearance of childhood kuru , with an increase , year by year , in the ages of people affected by kuru ( figure 2 ) .
the simplest interpretation was that new transmissions of kuru were stopping in the 1950s , when government patrols suppressed cannibalism .
the ageing of the kuru - affected cohorts , together with the lengthening of the incubation period in the post - transmission epidemic , can explain the observed increases in age of kuru onset .
indeed , as michael alpers reports in his paper ( alpers 2008 ) , none of the victims of kuru in the years since 1968 were born after 1960 , when transmission had almost certainly ceased .
this , together with the waning of the epidemic , provides the best proof that the epidemic was indeed transmitted by cannibalism , albeit with incubation periods that could be as short as 4 years , but occasionally in excess of 40 years .
5. cjd , oral transmission and carleton 's nobel prize carleton 's laboratory achieved the successful transmission of creutzfeldt - jakob disease ( cjd ) to chimpanzees in 1967 .
he was out bush at the time the telegram came to okapa , announcing the breakthrough , so it was handed to me. coralie and i recognized it as the harbinger of the nobel prize , which was to follow in 1976 .
for reasons that are unclear , gajdusek was often sceptical about kuru being transmitted by consumption of contaminated tissues ; when pressed , he would argue that the agent was more likely to have been transmitted by accidental inoculation through wounds or lesions of the skin or gastrointestinal tract .
nevertheless , by 1980 , his laboratory had shown that kuru and cjd could both be transmitted orally to spider monkeys , apparently in the absence of lesions that could provide a parenteral portal of entry ( gibbs et al. 1980 ) .
during the 1980s , the prion story began to emerge , showing that what had originally been thought of as a slow virus was actually an aberrant form of a normal protein ( prusiner 1982 ; collinge et al. 2006 ) .
the prion diseases were classified as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ( tses ) .
the later epidemics of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) and variant cjd ( vcjd ) were to show , in a very dramatic way , that prion - induced diseases other than kuru were also orally transmissible .
6. looking back in a coda to this personal tale , as deputy chief medical officer for the australian government from 1999 to 2004 , i was belatedly drawn back into the tse story owing to a need to provide policy advice to protect australia from both bse and vcjd .
one of our strategies was to call on the expertise of michael alpers and colin masters , two australians who had made major contributions to the understanding of the transmissible encephalopathies .
the tse committee on which we served together allowed me to revisit the kuru story , learn about prions and consolidate friendships from the past. of course , i had ended my active involvement in kuru research at a very much earlier stage when we moved in 1968 from okapa back to melbourne , to allow me to take a position in the clinical research unit at wehi .
over the intervening years , i have realized what a great privilege it was to be involved in the kuru story , to interact with burnet and gajdusek , michael alpers and shirley lindenbaum , and the many others who visited us in new guinea .
i corresponded with robert glasse , but sadly we never met ; he died in 1993 .
i corresponded with other researchers while in okapa , some of whom i later met at gajdusek 's nobel prize celebration in bethesda , or by happenstance in later life .
above all , it was a privilege to work with the fore people , to have made friends with many of them and to have played a small part in explaining what had caused their tragic disease .
an irony is that although the fore have seen at first hand the very same evidence that has led science to attribute kuru to cannibalism , most fore people , even today , still believe that it was caused by sorcery .
it is also humbling to remember that the intervention that eventually prevented kuru ( i.e. the suppression of cannibalism by government patrol officers ) was almost complete by the time that research on the problem commenced .
although medical science contributed very little to the end of kuru , the understanding triggered by research on the kuru problem has been of great value in helping to control the subsequent epidemics of bse and vcjd in the wider world .
we should pause to thank the fore for that , as well as the many talented researchers who have provided us with such deep understanding of the tses in the years since 1957 !
it is a pleasure to acknowledge the friendship and support of inamba kibita , daniel kosa , kege yasinamu , anumma , kalako , kura , abote , aiyo , igena , igabe , amuka , weri , komi and other local people who worked on the kuru research programme during our time at okapa , and taught me so much about their life and culture .
hani and yat , both now deceased , and tokaba , helped coralie with the house and children , and looked after them when i was away , or when we were on patrol together .
mane pumped the water every day .
macfarlane burnet and dr roy scragg ( director of the department of public health , territory of papua and new guinea ) made the kuru experience possible .
shirley lindenbaum , dick hornabrook , carleton gajdusek and michael alpers provided friendship , encouragement and access to data .
alex nilsson and ray spark were stalwart in support , and taught me much .
drs michael powell , john edmonds and neville hoffman were supportive friends when oversighting okapa hospital .
mr noel fowler and other officers provided local advice and support through the department of district administration at okapa .

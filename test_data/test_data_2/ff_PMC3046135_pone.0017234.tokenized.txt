autophagy is a cellular self - digestion process activated in response to stresses such as energy deprivation and oxidative stress .
however , the mechanisms by which energy deprivation and oxidative stress trigger autophagy remain undefined .
here , we report that activation of amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk ) by mitochondria - derived reactive oxygen species ( ros ) is required for autophagy in cultured endothelial cells .
ampk activity , ros levels , and the markers of autophagy were monitored in confluent bovine aortic endothelial cells ( baec ) treated with the glycolysis blocker 2 - deoxy - d - glucose ( 2 - dg ) .
treatment of baec with 2 - dg ( 5 mm ) for 24 hours or with low concentrations of h2o2 ( 100 microm ) induced autophagy , including increased conversion of microtubule - associated protein light chain 3 ( lc3 ) - i to lc3 - ii , accumulation of gfp - tagged lc3 positive intracellular vacuoles , and increased fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes .
2 - dg - treatment also induced ampk phosphorylation , which was blocked by either co - administration of two potent anti - oxidants ( tempol and n - acetyl - l - cysteine ) or overexpression of superoxide dismutase 1 or catalase in baec .
further , 2 - dg - induced autophagy in baec was blocked by overexpressing catalase or sirna - mediated knockdown of ampk .
finally , pretreatment of baec with 2 - dg increased endothelial cell viability after exposure to hypoxic stress .
thus , ampk is required for ros - triggered autophagy in endothelial cells , which increases endothelial cell survival in response to cell stress .
introduction autophagy is a tightly regulated catabolic process involving the degradation of cellular components using lysosomal machinery .
this process plays an important role in cell growth , development , and homeostasis by maintaining a balance between the synthesis , degradation , and subsequent recycling of cellular products .
autophagy is a major mechanism by which a starving or stressed cell reallocates nutrients from ancillary processes to more essential ones [ 1 ] - [ 2 ] .
for example , autophagy can be induced by hypoxia [ 3 ] , energy deprivation [ 4 ] , starvation [ 5 ] and ischemia [ 6 ] .
mechanistically , autophagy is initiated when the autophagosome , a double - membrane structure , is formed to surround certain targeted cytoplasmic proteins and organelles .
this process and the double - membrane structures are associated with the conversion of the microtubule - associated protein light chain 3b - i ( lc3 - i ) to lc3b - ii. the protein / organelle containing autophagosome fuses with a lysosome to degrade its inner contents [ 1 ] .
lysosomes can be disrupted by chloroquine or bafilomycin a to block autophagosome degradation and provoke autophagosome accumulation , which is marked by an increase in lc3 - ii [ 7 ] .
increasing evidence suggests that autophagy plays an important role in the cardiovascular system under physiological and pathological conditions including ischemia - reperfusion injury in the heart and other organs [ 8 ] , cardiomyopathy [ 9 ] , myocardial injury , atherosclerosis [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , and vascular pathology in alzheimer 's disease [ 12 ] .
reactive oxygen species ( ros ) and reactive nitrogen species ( rns ) are reported to be important in mediating autophagy [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
ros have also been reported to stabilize autophagosomes during periods of nutrient deprivation , hypoxia , ischemia - reperfusion injury , and general cell stress [ 15 ] .
for example , during cellular starvation or nutrient deprivation , increased generation of mitochondrial - derived hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) induces oxidation and consequent inhibition of atg4 , the cysteine proteases ( autophagins ) which play crucial roles in autophagy by proteolytic activation of atg8 paralogs for targeting to autophagic vesicles by lipid conjugation , as well as in subsequent deconjugation reactions [ 16 ] .
despite of growing evidence that the redox regulation of the cysteine protease atg4 by ros correlates with the occurrence of autophagy , the mechanistic details of how ros / rns initiates autophagy remain to be elucidated .
ampk is a serine / threonine kinase , which operates as a metabolic switch that is engaged in conditions when cellular atp is becoming depleted .
upon activation , ampk induces formation of the tuberous sclerosis complex to inhibit phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) , which triggers autophagy through two downstream signaling partners , ribosomal protein s6 kinase and 4e - binding protein 1 ( 4 - ebp1 ) [ 17 ] .
some recent reports have implicated ampk with regulation of autophagy .
for example , aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide ( aicar ) treatment and glucose deprivation of human mammary cancer derived cells ( mcf - 7s ) inhibit autophagy [ 18 ] .
matsui and colleagues also reported that in cardiac myocytes , autophagy is induced by inhibition of mtor , a phenomenon that protects against cell death [ 19 ] .
published studies from our laboratory and others have established an intricate balance between ampk signaling and the redox state of vascular endothelial cells .
ros and rns mediate ampk activation induced by a wide range of stimuli , including hyperglycemia [ 20 ] , hypoxia [ 21 ] , treatment with metformin [ 22 ] , nicotine [ 23 ] , and therapy with statin drugs [ 24 ] .
conversely , ampk activation inhibits the formation of ros by nadph oxidase and stimulates nitric oxide ( no ) by endothelial no synthase ( enos ) [ 25 ] .
further , ampk has also been implicated in c - jun n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) activation , nuclear factor ( nf ) - kappab mediated transcription , e - selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( vcam - 1 ) expression in endothelial cells [ 26 ] .
however , whether or not ampk is involved in ros - triggered autophagy is unknown .
2 - deoxy - d - glucose ( 2 - dg ) is a relatively specific blocker for glycolysis because it cannot be further metabolized by hexokinase .
therefore , 2 - dg triggers glucose deprivation without altering other nutrients or metabolic pathways [ 27 ] .
in addition , 2 - dg is reported to activate ampk , increase ros in cancer cells [ 28 ] , and trigger autophagy [ 29 ] .
thus , 2 - dg appears to be an ideal tool to dissect the interactions between autophagy , ros , and ampk .
however , while 2 - dg induces autophagy in cancer cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , its ability to trigger autophagy in endothelial cells has not been demonstrated .
in this study , we provide the first demonstration that ampk is required for ros - triggered autophagy in endothelial cells exposed to 2 - dg. materials and methods materials bovine aortic endothelial cells ( baec ) were obtained from lonza biologics , inc .

results 2 - dg induces autophagy in endothelial cells to establish whether 2 - dg exposure triggered autophagy in endothelial cells , baec were exposed for 2 to 24 hrs to 5 mm 2 - dg , a dose comparable to the physiologic concentration of d - glucose , and the conversion of lc3 - i to lc3 - ii was then determined .
exposure of baec to 2 - dg for 24 hrs markedly increased the conversion of the cytoplasmic lc3 - i to the autophagosomal membrane - bound lc3 - ii , indicating 2 - dg might induce autophagy ( fig. 1a ) .
however , rather than inducing autophagy , an increase in lc3 - ii could instead be due to 2 - dg repressing autophagosome fusion with lysosomes and degradation of lc3 - ii. to determine the mechanism of 2 - dg action , we examined the effect of disrupting lysosomal function using chloroquine and bafilomycin a. these compounds increase lysosomal ph and interfere with the function of lysosomal enzymes [ 7 ] , thereby increasing autophagosome accumulation in the cell .
baecs treated with 2 - dg and chloroquine or bafilomycin a had higher levels of lc3 - ii than cells treated with 2 - dg alone ( fig. 1b ) , which indicates 2 - dg acts by inducing autophagosome formation and does not disrupt their downstream maturation into autophagolysosomes .

cell lysates analyzed by western blot using antibody against lc3 ( n = 3 ; one - way anova : * p < 0.05 vs control ) .
e : baec were transduced adenovirus vectors encoding sod1 or catalase for 48 hrs and then exposed to 5 mm 2 - dg for 24 hrs ( n = 3 ; two - way anova , * p < 0.05 , gfp vs. 2 - dg , sod1 vs 2 - dg + sod1 , catalase vs 2 - dg + catalase , p < 0.05 , 2 - dg vs. 2 - dg + catalase overexpression ) .
f : the accumulation of lc3 ii ( green ) , localization of lc3 ii lysosomes ( red ) , and dapi ( blue ) staining of nuclei in response to sod1 or catalase overexpression and 2 - dg treatment were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy .
to confirm the effect of 2 - dg on autophagosome formation , immunofluorescence analysis of baec expressing gfp - lc3 and stained with lysotracker ( an organelle - selective , fluorescent probe that labels and tracks acidic organelles , such as lysosomes ) was preformed .
2 - dg increased formation of autophagosomes , indicated by increase in the number and distribution of gfp - tagged lc3 spots ( fig. 1c ) .
treatment of cell with both 2 - dg and chloroquine further increased the number and distribution of lc3 - gfp spots in these cells .
further , 2 - dg increased fusion of gfp - lc3 tagged vacuoles with lysosomes , which is indicated by co - localization of gfp - lc3 with lysotracker stained vesicles ( fig. 1c , merged image ) .
this demonstrated that 2 - dg treatment increased fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes , a definitive event in the induction of cellular autophagy .
together , these data show that 2 - dg induces conversion of lc3 - i to lc3 - ii and triggers autophagy in endothelial cells .
h2o2 mediates 2 - dg - induced autophagy current literature indicates that h2o2 induces autophagy in hela cells and hek293 cells [ 14 ] , [ 33 ] .
these findings are intriguing because nutrient starvation ( such as 2 - dg treatment ) is known to generate ros in a variety of cell types .
we therefore tested whether h2o2 could also trigger autophagy in endothelial cells .
treatment of baec for 30 min with h2o2 ( 100 microm ) increased the lc3 - ii - to - actin ratio 1.6 - fold ( fig. 1d ) .
we also reasoned that blocking the effects of ros should mitigate the phenotype of 2 - dg - induced autophagy .
we tested this hypothesis by assessing the effect of 2 - dg on the conversion of lc3i to lc3ii in baec overexpressing either sod1 or catalase from an adenovirus vector .
sod1 is an enzyme that buffers o2 - by converting it to h2o2 and catalase then scavenges h2o2 ( figure s1 in text s1 ) .
both sod1 and catalase overexpression decreased 2 - dg - enhanced lc3 - ii conversion .
2 - dg treatment of cells expressing the gfp negative control had a 2.0 - fold increase in lc3 - ii conversion , which was higher than the 1.5 - fold increase observed in sod1 - overexpressing cells and 1.4 - fold increase in catalase - overexpressing cells ( fig. 1e ) .
to further elucidate the effect of antioxidant enzyme overexpression on 2 - dg - induced autophagosome formation , immunofluorescence analysis of baec expressing gfp - lc3 was preformed .
2 - dg treatment ( lower three panels ) increased formation of autophagosomes ( green fluorescent spots ) compared to non - 2 - dg treated cells ( fig. 1f ) .
however , sod1 and catalase overexpression attenuated the 2 - dg - mediated formation of autophagosomes .
overall these results indicate that ros are critically involved in 2 - dg - induced autophagy and that h2o2 treatment of endothelial cells induces autophagy .
2 - dg induced ampk activation in a dose - and time - dependent manner to further establish if ros is responsible for 2 - dg - induced ampk activation , we performed a time - course study to determine if ros production proceeds ampk activation .
confluent baec were stimulated with 5 mm 2 - dg for 5 to 120 min , and ampk activation was measured by monitoring phosphorylation of ampkalpha - thr172 .
as depicted in fig. 2a , 2 - dg treatment increased the phosphorylation of ampkalpha - thr172 within 5 min , and this reached a maximum of 2.8 - fold greater than that in 2 - dg untreated cells by 10 min after treatment without affecting the total ampk levels .
after 10 min , phosphorylated ampkalpha - thr172 levels decreased and returned to basal levels by 60 min after treatment .
acc is a well - established downstream target of ampk and is activated by phosphorylation of ser79 .
we measured acc - ser79 phosphorylation and observed a similar time course for acc activation as that for ampk ( figure s1 in text s1 ) .
further , 2 - dg increased the phosphorylation of ampk - thr172 ( fig. 2b ) and acc - ser 79 ( figure s1 in text s1 ) in a dose - dependent manner .
2 - dg also increased ampk activity to 4 - fold after 5 min compared to basal activity and reached a peak 5.5 - fold higher than basal activity after 10 min ( fig. 2c ) .
these data establish that 2 - dg induces ampk activation in both a time - and dose - dependent manner .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0017234.g002 figure 2 time - course and dose - response for 2 - dg - induced ampk activation .
a : confluent baec monolayers were treated with 2 - dg ( 5 mm ) for the indicated times .
cell lysates were analyzed by western blot using antibody against p - ampk and ampkalpha1 / 2 ( n = 3 ; one - way anova : * p < 0.05 vs. control ) .
b : confluent baec monolayers were treated with the indicated concentration of 2 - dg for 10 min ( n = 3 ; one - way anova : * p < 0.05 vs. control ) .
c : baec were incubated with 5 mm of 2 - dg for the indicated times .
ampk was immunoprecipitated from cell lysis with an antibody against ampkalpha bound to protein a / g agarose overnight at 4degreesc .
ampk activity was determined by sams phosphorylation using a [ 32p ] atp assay ( n = 3 ; one - way anova , * p < 0.05 vs. control ) .
ampk is required for 2 - dg - induced autophagy in cancer cells , ampk is reported to be a key regulator of autophagy via a mechanism that involves inactivation of mtor [ 30 ] and cardiac myocytes [ 31 ] .
we therefore explored whether ampk was also involved in 2 - dg - induced autophagy in endothelial cells .
baec were transduced with an adenovirus vector encoding a dominant - negative ampk ( ampk - dn ) to block cellular ampk functions .
2 - dg treatment of cells expressing the gfp negative control for 24 hrs induced a 2 - fold increase in lc3 - ii levels , but ampk - dn overexpression blocked the 2 - dg - induced increase in lc3 - ii levels ( fig. 3a ) .
we confirmed these results by sirna - mediated silencing of the ampkalpha gene , which is the critical catalytic subunit of ampk in huvec ( fig. 3b ) .
as observed in baec , 2 - dg treatment increased lc3 - ii levels 2 - fold by 24 hrs post treatment in cells transfected with non - targeted control sirna , but transfection with ampkalpha1 / 2 - targeted sirna dramatically inhibited ampk expression and reduced the 2 - dg - induced increase in the lc3 - ii levels to 1.3 - fold ( fig. 3b ) .
taken together , these data show that ampk is required for 2 - dg - induced autophagy in endothelial cells .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0017234.g003 figure 3 2 - dg - induced autophagy is ampk - dependent .
a : baec were transduced with adenovirus vectors encoding dominant negative ampk ( ampk - dn ) for 48 hrs and then treated with 5 mm 2 - dg for 24 hrs ( n = 3 ; two - way anova , * p < 0.05 , gfp vs. 2 - dg , p < 0.05 , 2 - dg vs. 2 - dg + ampk - dn ) .
b : huvec were transfected with ampk - targeted sirna or control sirna for 24 hrs then treated with 5 mm 2 - dg for 24 hrs .
cell lysates were analyzed by western blot using antibody against lc3 ( n = 3 ; two - way anova , * p < 0.05 , vehicle vs. 2 - dg , p < 0.05 , control sirna vs. ampk sirna ) .
c : baec were treated with 1 mm aicar , 10 nm rapamycin , or 5 mm 2 - dg for 24 hrs and then analyzed by western blot to determine the level of phospho - ampk - thr172 ( p - ampk ) , phos - acc - ser79 ( p - acc ) , phos - mtor - ser2448 ( p - mtor ) , mtor , phos - p70s6k - thr389 ( p - p70s6k ) , p70s6k , phos - 4ebp1 - thr37 / 46 ( p - 4ebp1 ) , and lc3 .
ampk induces autophagy via downstream mtor signaling the mtor integrates the input from several upstream pathways by sensing the nutrient levels , bioenergetic status , and redox state of the cell [ 34 ] .
we hypothesized that mtor signaling was involved in the 2 - dg induced ampk - mediated induction of autophagy .
we therefore examined phosphorylation status of ampk and mtor after aicar , 2 - dg , and rapamycin treatment .
the 70 - kda ribosomal protein s6 kinase ( p70s6k ) and eukaryote initiation factor 4e binding protein 1 ( 4e - bp1 ) are the two well - characterized targets of mtorc .
when we probed baec by western blot analysis , we observed that both aicar and 2 - dg led to the phosphorylation of ampk as well as its upstream activator acc ( fig. 2c ) .
as predicted , both aicar and 2 - dg also attenuated the phosphorylation of mtor and its two targets , p706k and 4e - bp1 .
similarly , the canonical mtor inhibitor rapamycin increased of lc3 - ii levels without affecting ampk phosphorylation ( fig. 2c and figure s2 in text s1 ) .
thus , we concluded that 2 - dg induced autophagy via activation of ampk , which functions through the downstream inhibition of the mtor signaling pathway .
ros is involved in 2 - dg - induced ampk activation , which can be attenuated by anti - oxidant treatment recent studies using cancer cell lines [ 28 ] and c. elegans [ 35 ] showed that glucose deprivation activated ampk by production of ros .
however , it is not clear whether ros also regulate 2 - dg - induced ampk activation in endothelial cells .
to evaluate this , we first examined the effects of antioxidants on 2 - dg - induced ampk activation in baec .
pre - treatment of baec with tempol ( an o2 - scavenger ; 10 microm ) or nac ( a thiol antioxidant ; 2 mm ) significantly reduced 2 - dg - enhanced phosphorylation of ampk .
in addition , nac inhibited acc phosphorylation induced by 2 - dg ( fig. 4a and b , figure s2 in text s1 ) .
we further assayed ampk activity in baec by quantifying phosphorylation of the sams peptide , an ampk substrate , using a [ 32p ] - atp assay .
after treatment with 2 - dg ( 5 mm ) , ampk activity was 3 - fold greater than baseline within 10 min , and nac treatment caused ampk activity to drop from 3 - fold to 2 - fold over baseline levels ( fig. 4c ) .
finally , we overexpressed antioxident proteins sod1 or catalase to further examine the involvement of ros ( figure s3 in text s1 ) .
overexpression of either sod1 or catalase , but not gfp , attenuated 2 - dg - enhanced phosphorylation of ampk and acc ( fig. 4d ) .
in the sams peptide phosphorylation assay , 2 - dg treatment increased ampk activity 7 - fold , and this was enhanced 2 - fold by overexpression of sod1 and 2.5 - fold by overexpression of catalase ( fig. 4e ) .
overall these results indicate that ros are involved in 2 - dg - induced ampk activation in endothelial cells , a phenomenon that is reversible if ros levels are suppressed with anti - oxidants .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0017234.g004 figure 4 inhibitory effects of antioxidants on 2 - dg - induced ampk activation in baec .
a , b : confluent baec monolayers were pretreated with 10 microm 4 - hydroxy - tempol ( tempol ) or 2 mm n - acetyl - cysteine ( nac ) for 30 min and then treated with 5 mm 2 - dg for 10 min .
cell lysates were subjected to western blot analysis using antibodies against p - ampk , p - acc , ampkalpha1 / 2 , and beta - actin ( n = 3 ; two - way anova ,* p < 0.05 , 2 - dg vs. control , tempol + 2 - dg vs. tempol , nac + 2 - dg vs. nac , p < 0.05 2 - dg vs 2 - dg + tem or nac ) .
c : baec were pretreated with nac and then stimulated with 2 - dg. ampk activity was determined by sams phosphorylation using a [ 32p ] atp assay ( n = 3 ; two - way anova , * p < 0.05 , vehicle vs 2 - dg , nac vs 2 - dg + nac , p < 0.05 2 - dg vs. 2 - dg + nac ) .
d , e : confluent baec monolayers were transduced with adenovirus vectors encoding sod1 or catalase for 48 hrs and then treated with 5 mm 2 - dg for 10 min .
phosphorylation of ampk and ampk activity were detected , as described in the matierals and methods ( n = 3 ; two - way anova , * p < 0.05 , gfp vs. 2 - dg , sod1 vs 2 - dg + sod1 , catalase vs 2 - dg + catalase , p < 0.05 , 2 - dg vs. 2 - dg + sod1 or catalase overexpression ) .
2 - dg increases intracellular h2o2 levels in endothelial cells we next determined the effect of 2 - dg on ros production in endothelial cells using cm - h2dcfda as an intracellular h2o2 probe .
it is known that ampk activation by aicar reduces the generation of ros [ 20 ] .
to circumvent the confounding potential of ros attenuation by ampk activation , we detected intracellular h2o2 in 2 - dg - stimulated huvec transfected with ampk - targeted sirna .
as expected , the intracellular h2o2 levels in cells in which ampkalpha1 / 2 was knocked down were significantly higher than in cells transfected with the non - targeted control sirna following a 10 - min , 5 - mm 2 - dg treatment ( fig. 5a ) .
pre - treatment with a catalase inhibitor 3 - amino - 1,2,4 - triazine ( atz ) and thioredoxin reductase inhibitor 1 - chlo - 2,4 - dinitrobenzene ( dncb ) led to a significantly increased intracellular h2o2 level in 2 - dg - treated baec ( fig. 5b and c ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0017234.g005 figure 5 2 - dg increases intracellular synthesis of h2o2 to induce autophagy .
a : huvec were transfected with ampk - targeted sirna for 24 hrs .
then the cells were incubated in ebm media without phenol red and treated with 5 mm of 2 - dg for 10 min .
cm - h2dcfda ( 10 microm ; invitrogen ) was added for 30 min before quantification of fluorescence ( excitation at 485 nm and emission at 545 nm ) .
( n = 3 ; two - way anova ,* p < 0.05 , 2 - dg vs. vehicle ) .
b : baec were pre - treated with 3 - amino - 1,2,3 - triazine ( atz , 100 microm ) and 1 - chloro - 2,4 - dinitrobenzene ( dncb , 100 microm ) for 30 min and then treated with 2 - dg for 5 or 10 min .
intracellular h2o2 levels were detected by fluorescence using cm - h2dcfda .
( n = 3 ; two - way anova ,* p < 0.05 , atz + dncb vs. vehicle , p < 0.05 , 2 - dg + atz + dncb vs. atz + dncb ) .

intracellular h2o2 levels were detected by fluorescence using cm - h2dcfda .
( n = 3 ; t - test ,* p < 0.05 , 2 - dg vs. vehicle ) .
d,e : huvec were transfected with atg4 - targeted sirna or control sirna for 24 hrs and then treated with 5 mm 2 - dg for 24 hrs .
cell lysates were analyzed by western blot using antibody against lc3 ( n = 3 ; two - way anova , * p < 0.05 , vehicle vs. 2 - dg , p < 0.05 , control sirna vs. atg4 sirna ) .
suppression of atg4 attenuates 2 - dg induced autophagy sherz - shouval et al .
[ 16 ] recently reported that ros are essential for autophagy and specifically regulate the activity of atg4 .
although these studies were done in chinese hamster ovary and hela cell lines , it is likely that these results can be extrapolated to endothelial cells as well .
based on these findings , we examined atg4 expression in huvec after 2 - dg treatment or after transfection of atg4 - targeted sirna .
as shown in fig. 5d , silencing of atg4 efficiently blocked atg4 expression in huvec .
further , 2 - dg treatment of atg4 - silenced cells led to an attenuated increase in lc3 - ii levels .
these findings are consistent with the observation that h2o2 inhibits atg4 , which in turn promotes lipidation of atg8 leading to increased autophagy .
ros - dependent ampk activation is independent of changes in the amp - to - atp ratio scott et al. found that there are regulatory amp - and atp - binding sites in the subunits of ampk [ 36 ] .
as a consequence , high concentrations of atp antagonize ampk activation that results from amp binding to the heterotrimer .
2 - dg appears to induce ampk activation primarily through the decrease in intracellular atp levels that results from blocking glycolysis .
we speculated that ros - mediated ampk activation via glucose deprivation might not depend on a change in the amp - to - atp ratio .
we therefore quantified the adp : atp and amp : atp ratios in baec exposed to 2 - dg at different time points after treatment .
both amp : atp and adp : atp ratios significantly increased by 5 min after 2 - dg addition ( fig. 6a ) .
neither pretreatment of baec with tempol or nac ( fig. 6b ) nor overexpression of sod1 or catalase inhibited the observed increase in these ratios ( fig. 6c ) .
this is the first study to demonstrate that 2 - dg - induced ampk activation is mediated by ros and is likely independent of the amp : atp nucleotide ratio .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0017234.g006 figure 6 inhibition of ampk by antioxidants is independent of the amp : atp ratio .
a : confluent baec monolayers were treated with 5 mm of 2 - dg for the indicated times .
cells were lysed by perchloric acid and centrifuged as described in the materials and methods .
the ultrafiltrate was injected into a jasco hplc , and atp , adp , and amp were monitored at 260 nm .
( n = 4 ; one - way anova , * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , control vs. 2 - dg treatment ) .
b : baec monolayers were pre - treated with 10 microm tempol or 2 mm nac and then treated with 5 mm of 2 - dg for 5 min .
the amp : atp ratio in cell lysates was measured by hplc ( n = 5 ; two - way anova ,* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , 2 - dg vs. vehicle , tempol vs. 2 - dg + tempol , nac vs. 2 - dg + nac ) .
c : baec overexpressing sod1 or catalase were treated with 5 mm 2 - dg for 5 min .
the amp : atp ratio in cell lysates was measured by hplc .
( n = 3 ; * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , two - way anova , gfp vs. 2 - dg , sod1 vs. 2 - dg + sod1 , catalase vs. 2 - dg + catalase ) .
mitochondria are the sources of ros in 2 - dg - treated endothelial cells mitochondria , nad ( p ) h oxidase , and xanthine oxidase [ 37 ] can generate ros in both physiological and pathological conditions .
we sought to identify the major sources of ros synthesis in 2 - dg - treated endothelial cells .
mito - tempol is a synthetic tempol derivate that preferentially scavenges o2 - from mitochondria .
pre - treatment of cells with 10 microm mito - tempol for 30 min dramatically decreased 2 - dg - induced phosphorylation of ampk ( fig. 7a ) .
further , overexpression of mnsod , a sod isoform located in the mitochondrial matrix ( figure s3 in text s1 ) , attenuated the 2 - dg - induced phosphorylation of ampk and acc ( fig. 7b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0017234.g007 figure 7 activation of ampk by 2 - dg is mediated by mitochondrial ros independent of nad ( p ) h oxidase and xanthine oxidase .
a : confluent baec monolayers were pre - treated with 10 microm mito - tempol for 30 min and then treated with 5 mm of 2 - dg for 10 min .
cell lysates were analyzed by western blot using antibody against p - ampk ( n = 3 ; two - way anova , * p < 0.05 , vehicle vs 2 - dg , p < 0.05 , 2 - dg vs. 2 - dg + mito - tem ) .
b , c , e : confluent baec monolayers were transduced with adenovirus vectors encoding mnsod ( b ) , ucp2 ( c ) , or p47phox and p67phox dominant negative mutants ( e ) for 48 hrs and then treated with 5 mm 2 - dg for 10 min .
( n = 3 ; two - way anova , * p < 0.05 , gfp vs 2 - dg + gfp , mnsod vs 2 - dg + mn sod , ucp2 vs 2 - dg + ucp2 , p < 0.05 gfp vs. mnsod or ucp2 ) .
d : huvec were transfected with control sirna or ucp - 2 - targeted sirna for 24 hrs .
then the cells were treated with 5 mm of 2 - dg for 10 min .
( n = 3 ; two - way anova , * p < 0.05 , 2 - dg vs vehicle , p < 0.05 control sirna vs. ucp2 sirna ) .
f : confluent baec monolayers were pre - treated with allopurinol ( 100 microm ) or oxypurinol ( 30 microm ) for 30 min and then treated with 5 mm of 2 - dg for 10 min .
mitochondrial uncoupling protein - 2 ( ucp - 2 ) is a mitochondrial anion carrier protein that mediates mitochondrial proton leakage and uncouples atp synthesis from oxidative phosphorylation .
ucp - 2 overexpression ( figure s3 in text s1 ) dramatically decreased the 2 - dg phosphorylation of ampk and acc ( fig. 6c ) .
consistently , transfection of ucp - 2 - targeted sirna , but not control sirna , enhanced both basal phospho - ampk levels and 2 - dg - induced ampk phosphorylation in huvec ( fig. 7d and figure s3 in text s1 ) .
to further identify the sources of ros in these cells , we used infected cells with adenovirus vectors carrying dominant negative subunits of nadph oxidase to induce nad ( p ) h oxidase dysfunction .
p47phox and p67phox are subunits of the nadph oxidase that activate nad ( p ) h oxidase activity by binding with gp91phox on the mitochondrial membrane [ 38 ] , but expression of dominant negative p47phox ( p47 - dn ) and p67phox ( p67 - dn ) lead to nad ( p ) h oxidase dysfunction .
p47 - dn or p67 - dn overexpression did not affect 2 - dg - induced ampk and acc phosphorylation ( fig. 7e and figure s3 in text s1 ) .
moreover , incubation of baec with the xanthine oxidase inhibitors , allopurinol and oxypurinol , did not block 2 - dg - induced ampk and acc phosphorylation ( fig. 7f and g ) .
these findings strongly suggest that mitochondria are the main source of ros induced by 2 - dg in baec .
ampk - regulated autophagy contributes to endothelial cell survival under hypoxic conditions we next sought to demonstrate the physiological relevance of our findings .
for this purpose , we exposed baec to hypoxic conditions and treated them with 2 - dg to determine the role that autophagy plays under hypoxic conditions .
as showed in figure 8a , we observed increased cell death in baec after 12 hrs of hypoxia .
interestingly , 2 - dg pre - treatment prevented the hypoxia - induced cell death .
we quantified the release of lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) from cells as a marker of plasma membrane damage , reflecting the degree of cell death .
ldh release , and therefore cell death , in baec pre - treated with 2 - dg ( 5 mm ) was significantly lower than that in untreated cells ( fig. 8a ) .
in these experiments , we were also able to demonstrate that whereas 2 - dg protected cells from hypoxia - induced death , pre - treatment with 3 - methyladenine ( 3 - ma ) , an autophagy inhibitor , partially blocked the 2 - dg - induced protection ( fig. 8b ) .
in contrast , sod1 or catalase overexpression blocked the 2 - dg - induced protection and cell survival under hypoxic conditions ( fig. 8c ) .
finally , ampk - dn overexpression prevented 2 - dg - induced cell survival ( fig. 8d ) .
together , these results show that 2 - dg induces autophagy through ampk activation in a ros - dependent manner , thereby protecting cells from hypoxia - induced cell death .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0017234.g008 figure 8 inhibitory effect of 2 - dg - induced autophagy on cell death during hypoxia is dependent on ros and ampk .
a : baec cells were incubated in the absence 5 mm 2 - dg for 24 hrs under normoxia ( 21 % oxygen ) or hypoxia ( 1 % oxygen ) conditions for 12 hrs .
ldh in media was measured to assess cytotoxicity .
( n = 4 ; two - way anova , * p < 0.05 , normoxia vs hypoxia , p < 0.05 vehicle vs. 2 - dg treatment ) .
b : baec were pretreated with 3 - methyladenine ( 3 - ma ) for 0.5 hr and then treated with 5 mm 2 - dg for 24 hrs .
then , baec were incubated in hypoxic conditions for 12 hrs .
( n = 4 ; * p < 0.05 , two - way anova , vehicle vs. 2 - dg treatment , p < 0.05 , 2 - dg vs. 2 - dg + 3 - methyladenine ) .
c : baec were transduced with adenovirus vectors encoding sod1 or catalase for 48 hrs and then treated with 5 mm 2 - dg for 24 hrs .
then , baec were incubated in hypoxic conditions for 12 hrs .
( n = 4 ; two - way anova , * p < 0.05 , vehicle vs. 2 - dg treatment , p < 0.05 , gfp + 2 - dg vs. sod1 or catalase overexpression + 2 - dg ) .
d : baec were transduced with adenovirus vectors encoding ampk - dn or ampk - ca for 48 hrs and then treated with 5 mm 2 - dg for 24 hrs .
then , baec were incubated in hypoxic conditions for 12 hrs .
( n = 4 ; two - way anova , * p < 0.05 , vehicle vs. 2 - dg treatment , p < 0.05 , gfp vs. ampk - dn ) .
e : the model for 2 - dg - induced autophagy in endothelial cells .
2 - dg increased h2o2 production by mitochondria and the amp : atp ratio in endothelial cells .
h2o2 subsequently increased ampk activation , independent of a change in the amp : atp ratio .
ros - dependent activation of ampk by 2 - dg is required for autophagy .
discussion the present study has , for the first time , demonstrated that ampk activation by mitochondrial ros is required for the induction of autophagy in endothelial cells .
mechanistically , we found that ros , via ampk activation , increase autophagy by inhibition of mtor and atg4 activity and ros - triggered autophagy increases endothelial cell survival under hypoxic conditions .
thus , our results reveal a novel signaling pathway in which mitochondrial ros activate ampk that in turn increases autophagy .
induction of autophagy then serves to increase endothelial cell survival ( fig. 8e ) .
glucose deprivation induces a depletion of intracellular atp [ 39 ] , which consequently elevates the amp : atp ratio and activates ampk [ 29 ] .
recent study has demonstrated that glucose deprivation increases o2 - and h2o2 generation in human colon and breast cancer cells [ 40 ] .
our results demonstrate that 2 - dg induces autophagy in endothelial cells , a phenomenon not previously reported in this cell type .
specifically , we have shown that whether ampk is activated via nutritional stress ( as in exposure to 2 - dg ) or by induction of ros synthesis , endothelial cells activate an autophagy signaling pathway rather than a cell death pathway .
this result is consistent with other published data .
for example , matsuda et al. reported that 2 - dg induces autophagy in a / j mouse peritoneal macrophages [ 41 ] .
this process is also likely to be involved in the ability of 2 - dg to prevent brain injury induced by ischemia - reperfusion [ 42 ] .
2 - dg is also reported to decrease phosphorylation of mtor and its downstream targets , p70s6k and 4e - bp1 , in human breast cancer cells , leading to a reduced carcinogenic response and attenuated tumorigenicity [ 43 ] .
ampk activation also represses mtor activity in cells with reduced energy stores or after aicar treatment [ 44 ] .
consistent with these findings , our results demonstrate that 2 - dg induces autophagy through an ampk - regulated pathway , and sirna - mediated ampk knockdown prevents conversion of lc3 - i to lc3 - ii. most compelling of all , in our validation of data showing the involvement of h2o2 in 2 - dg - enhanced phosphorylation of ampk , we were also able to demonstrate that ros are involved in the coordinated role of 2 - dg and ampk on autophagy .
overall , these data indicate a novel autophagy signaling pathway important for endothelial cell survival .
our results have further demonstrated that ros might be a general mechanism for ampk activation under certain physiological conditions , including glucose deprivation .
consistent with these findings , cai et al. demonstrated that glucose deprivation induces ros production to activate ampk in pancreatic beta cells [ 45 ] .
several groups , including our own , have previously shown that diverse stimuli can induce ros generation , and in general , this results in ampk activation .
exposure to different oxygen concentrations , ranging from frank hypoxia [ 46 ] to hyperemia [ 47 ] , triggers ampk activation via mitochondrial ros production .
in addition , many exogenous stimuli , such as free fatty acids , including palmitic acid and arachidonic acid [ 48 ] , pharmacological stimuli , such as metformin [ 22 ] , etoposide , and resveratrol have all been observed to increase ampk activation through a mitochondrial ros mechanism .
all of these compounds are potentially important drug treatments .
metformin is a common treatment for diabetes and metabolic syndrome .
etoposide is a cancer therapeutic agent that inhibits topoisomerase ii activity , and resveratrol is a botanical phytoallexin that has shown beneficial effects on hyperglycemia in animal models of diabetes [ 49 ] .
phosphorylation of ampk via ros is also seen to occur in skeletal muscle during both stretch [ 50 ] and contraction [ 51 ] .
these data support our concept that ampk is an important redox sensor that effectively operates in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions .
another important finding in this study is that 2 - dg - induced ros - activated ampk activation prevents mitochondrial ros generation using a feedback system .
our data suggest an intricate balance between ampk signaling and the redox state of vascular endothelial cells .
ampk activation maintains redox homeostasis by inhibiting intracellular ros production from mitochondrial , nad ( p ) h oxidase or by increasing anti - oxidant gene expression .
our group previously reported that ampk activation up - regulates ucp - 2 expression to prevent oxidant stress [ 52 ] .
additional indirect evidence of these redox regulating properties has been described .
for example , aicar induces ampk activation and attenuates the ros production seen in hyperglycemia [ 20 ] .
rosiglitazone , a thiozolidinedione drug , also induces ampk activation and prevents hyperglycemia - induced ros production [ 53 ] .
ampk activation can also inhibit ros production from other sources , such as nad ( p ) h oxidase and adiponectin exposure [ 54 ] .
moreover , ampk has also been implicated in the regulation of anti - oxidant enzyme expression in endothelial cells by directly regulating the forkhead box o ( foxo ) 1 and 3 transcription factors [ 55 ] to induce expression of thioredoxin ( trx ) , which is an important ros scavenger .
indeed , investigators have also identified ampk - foxo - trx as being involved in the cellular antioxidant defense mounted against disparate ros / cell stress triggers , such as shear stress [ 56 ] and free fatty acid stimulation [ 48 ] .
ampk activation was also reported to increase the expression of mnsod [ 57 ] , and ampkalpha1 deletion decreases the expression of sod , catalase , gamma - glutamylcystine synthase , and trx [ 58 ] .
therefore , ampk activation appears to be an important target for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis .
endothelial dysfunction is one of the earliest events that occurs in a number of cardiovascular diseases , including atherosclerosis , hypertension , and diabetes .
endothelia dysfunction is characterized by accelerated endothelial cell death [ 59 ] .
ampk expression levels and activation are reduced in the early stages of these cardiovascular diseases [ 26 ] , [ 60 ] .
thus , the defects in the ros - ampk - autophagy pathway described in these studies may contribute to the initiation and progression of endothelial dysfunction .
therefore , greater insight into the complex autophagic and apoptotic regulatory controls in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle system is likely to lead to improved clinical treatments for related diseases .

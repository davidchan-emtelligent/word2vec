pertussis is still among the principal causes of death worldwide , and its incidence is increasing even in countries with high vaccine coverage .
although all age groups are susceptible , it is most severe in infants too young to be protected by currently available vaccines .
to induce strong protective immunity in neonates , we have developed bpze1 , a live attenuated bordetella pertussis strain to be given as a single - dose nasal vaccine in early life .
bpze1 was developed by the genetic inactivation or removal of three major toxins .
in mice , bpze1 was highly attenuated , yet able to colonize the respiratory tract and to induce strong protective immunity after a single nasal administration .
protection against b. pertussis was comparable to that induced by two injections of acellular vaccine ( apv ) in adult mice , but was significantly better than two administrations of apv in infant mice .
moreover , bpze1 protected against bordetella parapertussis infection , whereas apv did not .
bpze1 is thus an attractive vaccine candidate to protect against whooping cough by nasal , needle - free administration early in life , possibly at birth .
synopsis although vaccination has strongly reduced the incidence of whooping cough in many countries , this disease still causes approximately 300,000 deaths per year , mainly in young children that are not fully vaccinated .
efficient protection against pertussis requires at least three vaccine doses and is not achieved before the age of 6 mo. a new strategy to induce strong protective immunity in neonates is to mimic as closely as possible natural infection without inducing the disease , by the use of a live attenuated b. pertussis strain to be given as a single - dose nasal vaccine .
the authors examined in the mouse model the efficacy of a genetically attenuated strain , bpze1 .
this strain colonizes the mouse respiratory tract , but appears to be highly attenuated as evidenced by histopathological studies .
in addition , a single nasal administration of this strain protects against challenge with virulent b. pertussis better than two administrations of acellular vaccine in infant mice .
moreover , bpze1 provides protection against infection with bordetella parapertussis responsible for a milder pertussis - like syndrome , which was not seen after vaccination with acellular vaccine .
these results show that bpze1 could be an efficient , single - dose nasal vaccine to protect early in life against whooping cough .

doi : 10.1371 / journal.ppat.0020065 introduction whooping cough , or pertussis , is a severe childhood disease responsible for high mortality rates before the introduction of effective vaccines in the second half of the 20th century .
the success of these vaccines has led to the opinion that the disease is essentially under control , although worldwide 200,000 to 400,000 pertussis - linked deaths are still recorded annually , and the disease still ranks sixth among the causes of mortality due to infectious agents [ 1 ] .
although mostly prevalent in developing countries , the disease is also re - emerging in the developed world [ 2,3 ] , including the united states , where the incidence has increased nearly 10 - fold over the last 20 y [ 4 ] .
unexpectedly , the epidemiology of pertussis has changed in countries with high vaccine coverage , where cases of adolescent and adult pertussis are increasingly frequent [ 5 ] .
this is probably due to progressive waning of vaccine - mediated immunity during adolescence .
often atypical and therefore difficult to diagnose , pertussis is generally not life - threatening in adults and in many cases remains unnoticed .
however , infected adults constitute an important reservoir for transmission of the disease to very young children , too young to be fully vaccinated , and therefore at risk to develop severe disease associated with high mortality rates .
pertussis vaccination usually begins at 2 mo of age , and optimal protection requires at least three immunizations .
generally , the three doses are given at 1 - to 2 - mo intervals , implying that optimal protection is only achieved at the age of 6 mo. to reduce the incidence of pertussis in the very young and most vulnerable age groups , early immunization , possibly at birth , would thus be highly desirable .
however , numerous studies in humans and in animal models have suggested that the neonatal immune system is too immature to effectively induce vaccine - mediated protective immunity [ 6,7 ] .
the ifn - gamma production especially , which is indicative of a th1 response that is essential to the development of protective immunity to pertussis [ 8 ] , appears to be significantly reduced in human newborns , compared to older children or adults [ 9 ] .
this is also reflected by the fact that significant amounts of antigen - specific ifn - gamma are only produced after several months (>= 6 mo ) in children vaccinated with pertussis vaccines , especially with acellular vaccines ( apv ) [ 10 ] .
natural infection with bordetella pertussis has long been considered to induce strong and long - lasting immunity that wanes later than vaccine - induced immunity [ 5,11 ] .
furthermore , infection with b. pertussis induces measurable antigen - specific th1 - type immune responses even in very young children ( as young as 1 mo of age ) [ 12 ] .
these observations suggest that live vaccines applicable by the nasal route , in order to mimic as closely as possible natural infection , may be attractive alternatives over the currently available vaccines .
in this report , we describe the development of such a live vaccine candidate through genetic attenuation of b. pertussis to diminish pathogenicity while maintaining the ability to colonize and induce protective immunity .
this vaccine candidate was found to induce protection in infant mice after a single intranasal administration that is superior to the protection provided by the current apv .
in addition , it provided protection against infection with bordetella parapertussis , which was not seen after vaccination with apv .
results construction of b. pertussis bpze1 recent advances in the understanding of b. pertussis virulence at the molecular level [ 13 ] have allowed us to rationally design a strategy for attenuation by removing or altering genes that are involved in the pathogenesis of whooping cough .
three virulence factors were genetically targeted : tracheal cytotoxin ( tct ) , pertussis toxin ( ptx ) , and dermonecrotic toxin ( dnt ) .
tct is responsible for the destruction of ciliated cells in the trachea of infected hosts [ 14,15 ] and may thus be involved in the cough syndrome .
tct is a breakdown product of peptidoglycan in the cell wall of gram - negative bacteria , which generally internalize it into the cytosol by the ampg transporter protein to be re - utilized during cell wall biosynthesis. b. pertussis ampg is inefficient in the internalization of peptidoglycan breakdown products .
we therefore replaced the b. pertussis ampg gene by e. coli ampg .
the resulting strain expressed less than 1 % residual tct activity ( figure 1a ) .

( c ) southern blot analysis of the dnt locus in bpsm ( lane 1 ) and bpze1 ( lane 2 ) .
the lengths of the size markers are indicated in base pairs ( bp ) are shown in the left margin .
ptx is a major virulence factor responsible for the systemic effects of b. pertussis infections and is composed of an enzymatically active moiety , called s1 , and a moiety responsible for binding to target cell receptors ( for review , see [ 16 ]) .
however , it is also one of the major protective antigens , which has prompted us to replace the natural ptx genes by a mutated version coding for an enzymatically inactive toxin .
this was achieved by replacing arg - 9 by lys , and glu - 129 by gly in s1 , two key residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis , respectively .
allelic exchange was used to first delete the ptx operon , and then to insert the mutated version .
the presence of the relevant toxin analogs in the b. pertussis culture supernatants was detected by immunoblot analysis , although the mutant strain consistently produced slightly lower levels of anti - ptx antibody reactive material than the parental strain ( figure 1b ) .
finally , allelic exchange was used to remove the dnt gene ( figure 1c ) .
although the role of dnt in the virulence of b. pertussis is not certain , it has been identified as an important toxin in the closely related species bordetella bronchiseptica and displays lethal activity upon injection of minute quantities ( for review , see [ 16 ]) .
in vitro characterization of b. pertussis bpze1 since some of the genetic alterations in bpze1 may potentially affect the bacterial cell wall synthesis , we compared the size and shape , as well as the in vitro growth rate , of bpze1 with those of the parental strain bpsm ( see materials and methods for reference ) .
the growth rate of bpze1 did not differ from that of bpsm ( figure 2a ) , and no difference in bacterial shape or size was detected between bpze1 and bpsm , as evidenced by electron microscopy analysis ( figure 2b ) .
however , the cell wall of bpze1 appeared to be consistently somewhat thinner than that of bpsm .

the results are expressed as means (+/ - standard error ) of percentages of binding bacteria relative to the bacteria present in the inoculum from three different experiments .
to determine whether the absence or alterations of any of the targeted toxins in bpze1 affect adherence properties of b. pertussis , we compared the attachment rates of bpze1 with those of bpsm , using the human pulmonary epithelial cell line a549 and the murine macrophage cell line j774 , two cellular models often used to study the adherence of b. pertussis .
no statistically significant difference in the adherence capacities to either cell line was observed between the two strains ( figure 2c ) .
attenuation of b. pertussis bpze1 to determine whether the mutations introduced into b. pertussis bpze1 have resulted in attenuation , yet allow the organism to colonize the respiratory tract , 8 - wk - old balb / c mice were intranasally infected with bpze1 or bpsm , and colonization was followed over time .
bpze1 was able to colonize and persist in the lungs of mice as long as bpsm ( figure 3a ) .
however , the peak of multiplication seen 7 d after infection with bpsm was consistently lacking in mice infected with bpze1 .
studies done with strains mutated in individual toxin genes indicated that this is due to the mutations in the ptx locus ( unpublished data ) .
when the lungs were examined for histopathological changes and inflammatory infiltration , infection with bpsm was found to induce strong peri - bronchiovascular infiltrates and inflammatory cell recruitment 7 d after infection , associated with a strong hypertrophy of the bronchiolar epithelial cells ( figure 3b ) .
in contrast , no such changes were seen in bpze1 - infected animals , and the histology of the bpze1 - infected mice was similar to that of the control mice that had received sterile phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) instead of the bacteria .
similar results were obtained when infant mice ( 3 wk old ) were used instead of adult mice ( see figure s1 ) the bpsm infection - induced inflammation lasted for at least 2 mo ( unpublished data ) .
these results indicate that the mutations introduced into bpze1 have resulted in drastic attenuation , but allow the bacteria to colonize and persist for up to 1 mo. figure 3 in vivo characterization of b. pertussis bpze1 ( a ) lung colonization by bpsm ( solid lines ) and bpze1 ( dotted lines ) of adult mice infected intranasally with 106 cfu of bpze1 or bpsm .

( b ) histological analysis of lungs from bpze1 ( upper panel ) or bpsm - infected ( middle panel ) adult mice compared to controls given pbs ( lower panel ) .
one week after infection , the lungs were aseptically removed and fixed in formaldehyde .
sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin , and examined by light microscopy .
( c ) susceptibility of bpze1 - infected mice to infection by m. tuberculosis .
balb / c mice were infected intranasally with 106 cfu of bpze1 ( filled columns ) or received pbs ( open columns ) and were intranasally infected one week later with 5 x 104 m. tuberculosis h37rv .
one week ( left columns ) and 5 wk ( right columns ) after m. tuberculosis infection , the m. tuberculosis cfus present in the lungs were counted .
the results are expressed as mean (+/ - standard error ) cfus from four mice per group .
to test whether intranasal vaccination with bpze1 may predispose mice to other respiratory infections , bpze1 - vaccinated mice were infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis , the most prevalent bacterial pathogen of the respiratory tract , and the mycobacterial colony counts were determined 1 and 5 wk after infection .
no significant difference was observed between mice immunized with bpze1 prior to m. tuberculosis infection and those that had received pbs instead of bpze1 ( figure 3c ) .
protection against b. pertussis challenge after intranasal vaccination of adult mice with bpze1 to evaluate the protection offered by bpze1 , we compared the effect of a single intranasal administration of this strain to 8 - wk - old balb / c mice on the subsequent colonization by the wild - type challenge strain bpsm with that of two intraperitoneal ( ip ) immunizations with 1 / 5 of a human dose of apv .
this apv immunization protocol has been described as the best to correlate with pertussis vaccine efficacy in human clinical trials [ 17,18 ] .
as shown by the total clearance of bacterial colony counts in the lungs 7 d after challenge infection , a single intranasal administration of bpze1 and two ip immunizations with apv provided similar levels of protection ( figure 4a ) .
high bacterial loads were found in the control mice that had received two injections of pbs instead of the vaccine .

the dashed lines in panels ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( d ) represent the limit of bacterial counts .
protection against b. pertussis challenge after intranasal vaccination of infant mice with bpze1 since the principal targets of novel pertussis vaccines are young infants , which are not protected with the currently available vaccines , we have developed an infant ( 3 - wk - old ) mouse model [ 19 ] and used it here to compare the efficiency of vaccination with bpze1 with that of vaccination with apv .
a single nasal administration of bpze1 fully protected infant mice against challenge infection ( figure 4b ) , as complete bacterial clearance was observed in the lungs 1 wk after challenge .
in contrast , substantial numbers of bacteria remained in the apv - vaccinated animals 1 wk after challenge infection .
the difference in bacterial load between the bpze1 - vaccinated and the apv - vaccinated mice was statistically significant , indicating that in the infant mouse model , a single intranasal administration with bpze1 provides better protection than two systemic administrations of apv .
in addition , we consistently observed a strong reduction in the bacterial load of the challenge strain 3 h after administration when the mice had been immunized with bpze1 compared to the apv - immunized animals ( figure 4c ) , indicating that vaccination with bpze1 reduces the susceptibility to infection by the challenge strain .
this effect was seen in both 8 - wk - old and in infant mice .
in contrast , apv had no effect on the bacterial counts 3 h after infection , when compared to the control mice .
protection against b. parapertussis challenge after intranasal vaccination with bpze1 there is increasing concern about b. parapertussis infection in children , especially in immunized populations [ 20,21 ]. b. parapertussis causes a milder pertussis - like syndrome , the frequency of which is probably largely underestimated .
furthermore , the incidence of b. parapertussis infections has been increasing over the last decades , possibly due to the fact that pertussis vaccines are known to have low or no protective efficacy against b. parapertussis [ 22,23 ] .
in contrast , infection by b. pertussis has recently been reported to protect against b. parapertussis infection in the mouse model [ 24 ] .
we therefore assessed bpze1 for protection against b. parapertussis using the infant mouse model .
whereas two administrations of apv did not provide any protection against b. parapertussis , a single intranasal administration of bpze1 provided strong protection , as measured by the low numbers of b. parapertussis counts in the lungs of the vaccinated mice 1 wk after challenge ( figure 4d ) .
immune responses induced by bpze1 vaccination although the mechanisms of protective immunity against b. pertussis infection are not yet completely understood , clear evidence of a role for both b cells and ifn - gamma has been demonstrated in mice [ 18 ] .
vaccination of infant mice with either one nasal dose of bpze1 or two ip administrations of apv induced high titers of serum immunoglobulin g ( igg ) against filamentous hemagglutinin ( fha ) ( figure 5a ) , a major surface antigen of b. pertussis [ 25 ] , and against ptx ( figure 5b ) , both present in apv , as well as against a b. pertussis whole cell lysate ( figure 5c ) .
following b. pertussis challenge , positive anamnestic responses were measured in bpze1 - and in apv - vaccinated animals , as indicated by an increase in anti - fha , anti - ptx , and anti - b. pertussis whole cell lysate igg titers , compared to primary responses before b. pertussis infection .
similar results were obtained in 8 - wk - old mice , as shown for the anti - fha responses in figure s2 .
examination of the anti - fha igg1 / igg2a ratios showed that these ratios were higher after apv administration , characteristic of a th2 - type response , than after bpze1 vaccination ( figure 5d ) .
after challenge , the anti - fha - igg1 / igg2a ratio remained substantially higher in the apv - vaccinated mice than in the bpze1 - vaccinated animals .
figure 5 immune responses induced in infant mice by bpze1 or apv immunization ( a ) anti - fha , ( b ) anti - ptx , ( c ) anti - b. pertussis igg heavy and light chain ( h + l ) titers , and ( d ) anti - fha igg1 / igg2a ratios before ( open columns ) or 1 wk after bpsm challenge ( filled columns ) in bpze1 or apv immunized 3 - wk - old mice , compared to controls .
( e ) ifn - gamma to il - 5 ratios produced by fha - , ptx - or cona - stimulated splenocytes from 8 - wk - old mice vaccinated 2 mo before with bpze1 ( filled columns ) or apv ( open columns ) , compared to controls ( gray columns ) .
antibodies and cytokines were measured in individual mice , and the results are expressed as mean values (+/ - standard error ) for four mice per group tested in triplicate .
analysis of b. pertussis antigen - specific cytokine patterns induced by bpze1 or apv vaccination of 8 - wk - old mice confirmed that bpze1 administration favors a stronger th1 - type response than apv vaccination .
this was revealed by the fact that the ratios of ifn - gamma over il - 5 produced by splenocytes stimulated with fha or ptx , or with the polyclonal activator cona were significantly higher in bpze1 vaccinated mice than in apv vaccinated mice ( figure 5e ) .
for technical reasons , these experiments could only be performed in adult mice .
discussion pertussis is the first infectious disease whose incidence is increasing in countries with high vaccine coverage , highlighting the limits of current vaccine strategies .
the fact that natural b. pertussis infection , even very early in life , is able to induce a strong and long - lasting th1 response [ 12 ] prompted us to develop a live attenuated b. pertussis vaccine strain to be given by the nasal route as an alternative over the currently available vaccines .
on the basis of experimental infections of primates , huang et al .
[ 26 ] in 1962 had already come to the conclusion that ultimate protection against whooping cough probably best follows a live b. pertussis inoculation .
in veterinary medicine , attenuated bordetella strains have been used to vaccinate against bordetellosis in dogs and piglets .
a live attenuated bordetella bronchiseptica strain has been shown to provide strong protection against kennel cough in dogs [ 27 ] after nasal administration .
this protection was seen as early as 48 h after vaccination .
intranasal vaccination with live attenuated b. bronchiseptica has also been shown to protect against atrophic rhinitis in 2 - d - old piglets [ 28 ] , indicating that in a live attenuated form , bordetella vaccines can be highly active in newborn animals .
previous attempts to genetically attenuate b. pertussis as a live vaccine candidate have met with rather limited success .
based on a strategy used for the successful attenuation of salmonella vaccine strains [ 29 ] , roberts et al .
[ 30 ] have deleted the aroa gene of b. pertussis .
the aroa mutant was indeed highly attenuated , but it had also lost its capacity to colonize the respiratory tract of the intranasally vaccinated animals , and induced protective immunity only after repeated administrations of high doses .
we took advantage of the knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of b. pertussis virulence and developed the highly attenuated strain bpze1 .
this strain contains genetic alterations leading to the absence or inactivation of three major toxins , ptx , tct , and dnt .
in contrast to the aroa mutant , this strain was able to colonize the mouse respiratory tract and to provide full protection after a single intranasal administration .
the protection in adult mice was indistinguishable from that induced by two administrations of 1 / 5 of a human dose of apv .
an important difference , however , was seen in infant mice , in which a single administration of bpze1 fully protected , whereas apv only offered partial protection .
in the context of the difficulties to induce protection in infants early in life with the currently available vaccines , these results provide hope for the development of novel vaccination strategies that may be used in the very young children , possibly at birth .
in addition , bpze1 protected against b. parapertussis , whereas apv did not .
therefore the use of bpze1 should also have an impact on the incidence of whooping cough caused by b. parapertussis in infants , provided that potential programmatic obstacles to replace the current vaccines with a live attenuated strain can be overcome .
although the recent replacement of first generation , whole - cell vaccines by new apv in many countries has significantly reduced the systemic adverse reactions observed with whole - cell vaccines , it has not abolished the need for repeated vaccination to achieve protection .
this makes it unlikely to obtain protection in very young children (< 6 mo ) that present the highest risk to develop severe disease .
in addition , the wide - spread use of apv has revealed new , unforeseen problems .
repeated administration of apv may cause extensive swelling at the site of injection [ 31 ] .
in approximately 5 % of the cases , this swelling involves almost the entire limb and lasts for more than a week .
although the mechanism of this swelling has not been characterized yet , it has been proposed to be due to an arthus hypersensitivity reaction caused by high antibody levels induced by the primary immunization [ 32 ] .
however , it could also be related to the th2 skewing of the immune response , as , compared to whole - cell vaccines , apv administration induces more th2 - type cytokines in vaccinated children [ 10 ] and causes a delay in the th1 development ( f. mascart , m. hainaut , a. peltier , v. verscheure , j. levy , and c. locht , unpublished data ) .
delayed maturation of th1 function has been associated with a risk for atopy in genetically pre - disposed individuals [ 33 ] .
the two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive .
compared to apv , the immune response to bpze1 administration is less biased towards the th2 arm , and since bpze1 is administered mucosally , no swelling reaction can occur .
the use of live attenuated bacteria as vaccines raises the issue of their biosafety .
as such , they fall under the directives and guidelines for genetically modified organisms susceptible to be released into the environment .
these guidelines and directives describe several objectives that have to be met , including hazard identification and environmental risk assessment [ 34 ] .
potential pathogenicity needs to be carefully considered , especially in immunocompromised individuals , such as those infected with hiv .
the natural biology of b. pertussis is particularly interesting in that regard .
although pertussis in hiv - infected subjects has been described occasionally , it is rather rare in aids patients [ 35 ] .
in its genetically attenuated form , b. pertussis would therefore not be expected to cause major problems in hiv - infected children , especially if severe aids is an exclusion criterion , as it is for many vaccines. b. pertussis colonization is strictly limited to the respiratory epithelium , without extrapulmonary dissemination of the bacteria , which naturally excludes systemic bacteremia of the bpze1 vaccine strain .
if nevertheless unforeseeable safety problems occurred , the vaccine strain can be eliminated early following vaccination by the use of macrolide antibiotics , such as erythromycine , to which essentially all b. pertussis isolates are sensitive .
a further concern , as for any live vaccine , is the potential release of the vaccine strain into the environment , and the consequences of such a release. b. pertussis is predominantly a human pathogen , and there is no known animal vector or reservoir .
moreover , unlike b. bronchiseptica , survival of wild - type b. pertussis in the environment is extremely limited [ 36 ] .
pertussis is usually spread by coughing individuals , and there appears to be limited asymptomatic carriage [ 37 ] .
coughing cannot be assessed in the mouse models used in this study .
however , due to the nature of the genetic alterations in bpze1 , in particular the strong reduction of tct and the genetic inactivation of ptx , this strain would not be expected to induce coughing .
active ptx has been shown to be required for cough induction in a coughing rat model , although the mechanism is not known [ 38 ] .
if the vaccine strain were nevertheless to be transmitted to non - vaccinated individuals , this would at worst result in increased vaccine coverage .
the consequences of each of these potential hazards can thus be graded as negligible and can easily and rapidly be controlled by antibiotic treatment if necessary .
advantages of the use of bpze1 include the relatively low production costs , making it especially attractive for developing countries , its needle - free , easy , and safe mode of administration , and its potential to induce mucosal immunity in addition to systemic immunity .
although , surprisingly , the role of mucosal immunity against pertussis has not been much addressed , the fact that b. pertussis is a strictly mucosal pathogen , makes it likely that mucosal immune responses may contribute significantly to protection .
none of the currently available vaccines induces any significant mucosal response .
the use of live attenuated b. pertussis for mucosal vaccination offers yet another advantage. b. pertussis can be used for the presentation of heterologous antigens to the respiratory mucosa ( for review , see [ 39 ]) the use of bpze1 as a heterologous expression platform may thus be helpful for the generation of multivalent vaccines against a variety of respiratory pathogens .
however , since intranasal delivery of bpze1 also induces strong systemic immune responses , as shown here by both the high levels of anti - fha antibodies and of antigen - specific ifn - gamma production , it may also be used for the production of antigens to which systemic immune responses are desired .
materials and methods bordetella strains and growth conditions .
the b. pertussis strains used in this study are all derived from b. pertussis bpsm [ 40 ] , and b. parapertussis is a streptomycin - resistant derivative of strain 12822 ( kindly provided by dr. n. guiso , institut pasteur de paris , france ) .
all bordetella strains were grown on bordet - gengou ( bg ) agar ( difco laboratories , detroit , michigan , united states ) supplemented with 1 % glycerol , 20 % defibrinated sheep blood , and 100 mug / ml streptomycin .
for cell adherence assays , exponentially growing b. pertussis was inoculated at an optical density of 0.15 at 600 nm in 2.5 - ml modified stainer - scholte medium [ 41 ] containing 1 g / l heptakis ( 2,6 - di - o - methyl ) beta - cyclodextrin ( sigma , st. louis , missouri , united states ) and supplemented with 65 muci / ml l - [ 35s ] methionine plus l - [ 35s ] cysteine ( nen , boston , massachusetts , united states ) and grown for 24 h at 37 degreesc.the bacteria were then harvested by centrifugation , washed three times in phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) , and resuspended in rpmi 1640 ( gibco , grand island , new york , united states ) at the desired density. m. tuberculosis h37rv was grown in sauton medium or on middlebrook 7h11 agar ( difco laboratories ) at 37 degreesc .
construction of b. pertussis bpze1 .
the different steps followed to construct b. pertussis bpze1 can be found in protocol s1 .
briefly , we first replaced by allelic exchange the b. pertussis ampg gene in the bpsm genome by escherichia coli ampg .
next , allelic exchange was used to delete the ptx operon and to then insert a mutated version coding for enzymatically inactive ptx .
finally , the dnt gene was deleted from the resulting b. pertussis strain .
analysis of tct production .
for sensitive quantitation of tct production , culture supernatants of b. pertussis grown to logarithmic phase were collected , subjected to solid phase extraction [ 42 ] , and derivatized with phenylisothiocyanate ( pitc ; pierce biotechnology , rockford , illinois , united states ) .
the resulting phenylthiocarbamyl ( ptc ) derivatives were separated by reversed - phase high - performance liquid chromatography using a c8 column ( perkin elmer , wellesley , california , united states ) and detected at 254 nm. the amount of b. pertussis ptc - tct in each sample was determined by comparing the peak area and elution time with an identically processed tct standard .
cell - adherence assay .
to analyze adherence properties of the b. pertussis strains , their attachment rates to the human pulmonary epithelial cell line a549 ( atcc n ccl - 185 ) and the murine macrophage cell line j774 ( atcc n tib - 67 ) were measured as previously described [ 43 ] .
transmission electron microscopy .
the single - droplet negative staining procedure was used as described previously [ 44 ] with the following modifications : 20 mul of a suspension at approximately 109 bacteria / ml were absorbed for 2 min onto form formvar carbon - coated nickel grids ( 400 mesh ; electron microscopy sciences ems , washington , pennsylvania , united states ) .
after 30 s air - drying , the grids were stained for 2 min with 20 mul of 2 % phosphotungstic acid ( ph7 ) ( ems ) and examined after air - drying under a transmission electron microscope ( hitachi 7500 ; hitachi , tokyo , japan ) at 60 kv and high resolution .
intranasal infection and vaccination .
the 3 - wk - old and 8 - wk - old female balb / c mice were kept under specific pathogen - free conditions , and all experiments were carried out under the guidelines of the institut pasteur de lille animal study board .
mice were intranasally infected with approximately 4 x 106 bacteria in 20 - mul pbs , and kinetics of colony - forming units ( cfu ) in the lungs were measured as previously described [ 45 ] .
for vaccination with apv ( tetravac ; aventis - pasteur , lyon , france ) , mice were immunized ip with 20 % of the human dose and boosted 1 mo later using the same dose .
for challenge infections with bordetella , mice were intranasally infected 2 mo after vaccination with approximately 4 x 106 bpsm or b. parapertussis in 20 - mul pbs .
for challenge infection with m. tuberculosis , mice were intranasally infected with 5 x 104 m. tuberculosis h37rv in 20 - mul pbs 1 wk after vaccination with bpze1 .
antibody determination .
sera were collected , and antibody titers were estimated by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( elisa ) as previously described [ 45 ] .
cytokine assays .
spleen cells from individual mice were tested at different time points after immunization for in vitro cytokine production in response to heat - killed b. pertussis bpsm ( 106 cells / ml ) , 5.0 mug / ml ptx ( purified from b. pertussis bpgr4 [ 46 ] as previously described [ 47 ] , and heat - inactivated at 80 degreesc for 20 min ) , 5.0 mug / ml fha ( purified from b. pertussis bpra [ 48 ] as previously described [ 49 ]) , 5 mug / ml concanavalin a ( sigma ) or medium alone as control .
supernatants were removed from triplicate cultures after 72 - h incubation at 37 degreesc and 5 % co2 , and ifn - gamma and il - 5 concentrations were determined by immunoassays ( bd opteia set ; pharmingen , san diego , california , united states ) .
statistical analysis .
the results were analyzed using the unpaired student t test and the kruskal - wallis test followed by the dunn post - test ( graphpad prism program ) when appropriate .
differences were considered significant at p <= 0.05 .
supporting information figure s1 lung colonization and histological analysis of lungs from bpsm - or bpze1 - infected infant mice ( a ) the 3 - wk - old balb / c mice were infected intranasally with 106 cfu of bpsm ( solid lines ) or bpze1 ( dotted lines ) .
the results are expressed as mean (+/ - standard error ) cfus from three to four mice per group and are representative of two separate experiments .
the dashed line represents the limit of bacterial counts .

tracheal rupture is a rare complication of endotracheal intubation .
we present a case of tracheal rupture that was diagnosed intraoperatively after the use of an nim emg endotracheal tube .
a 66 - year - old female with a recurrent multinodular goiter was scheduled for total thyroidectomy .
induction of anesthesia was uncomplicated .
intubation was atraumatic using a 6 mm nim emg endotracheal tube ( ett ) .
approximately 90 minutes into the surgery , a tracheal tear was suspected .
after confirming the diagnosis , conservative treatment with antibiotic coverage was favored .
the patient made a full recovery with no complications .
diagnosis of the tracheal tear was made intraoperatively , prompting early management .
1. introduction tracheal rupture is a rare iatrogenic complication , most commonly due to blunt trauma outside the hospital setting .
it is occasionally a complication of surgical manipulation of the trachea .
it can also complicate orotracheal intubation due to the tip of endotracheal tube ( ett ) getting caught in the fold of posterior trachea during insertion .
diagnosis usually waits until after extubation based on clinical suspicion and confirmed by bronchoscopy .
if not properly managed , severe respiratory distress and even death may result .
we present a case of tracheal rupture that was diagnosed intraoperatively via bronchoscopy and managed conservatively .
2. case presentation a 66 - year - old female with a history of a subtotal thyroidectomy 20 years ago was scheduled for a total thyroidectomy due to a recurrent symptomatic multinodular goiter .
she presented with increasing dysphagia , dyspnea , and a nontender neck mass .
preoperative fine - needle aspiration showed benign follicular hyperplasia .
ct scan revealed an enlarged thyroid nodule on the left lobe measuring 4.7 x 3.1 cm with deviation of the trachea to the right ( figure 1 ) .
other significant medical history included diabetes , hypertension , and hyperlipidemia .
after induction of anesthesia with propofol and succinylcholine , a 6 mm medtronic nerve integrity monitor ( nim ) emg ett was inserted over a stylet for an uneventful intubation .
approximately 90 minutes into the surgery , a gurgling noise was perceived from the operative site .
this was followed by an increase in inspiratory peak pressure and desaturation to 85 % .
tube placement was confirmed by laryngoscopy , and the cuff was further inflated with 2 ml of air to minimize leaks .
fiber optic bronchoscopy revealed blood around the ett , which was suctioned resulting in improved respiratory parameters .
after removal of the thyroid gland , the anterolateral aspect of the trachea was examined and palpated .
no anterolateral tear was found .
a repeat flexible bronchoscopy revealed a 5 cm tracheal tear on the posterior wall approximately 2 cm above the carina ( figure 2 ) .
tracheomalacia was noted distal to the ett .
flexible endoscopy performed at this time to rule out esophageal tear was unrevealing .
the surgical incision was closed 4 hours after the start of the procedure .
the nim emg ett was exchanged for a regular ett .
the patient was then transferred to the icu .
on cmv ( pip of 25 cm h2o , fio2 100 %) , the abg showed ph 7.32 , pco2 40 , po2 96 , and o2 saturation 96 % .
a chest x - ray revealed no evidence of pneumomediastinum or subcutaneous emphysema .
in the sicu , she was started on iv antibiotics and was monitored for respiratory distress .
on postoperative day ( pod ) 1 , she was put on cpap trials and a flexible bronchoscopy confirmed the intraoperative findings .
subsequently , she was extubated and placed on supplemental oxygen via face mask .
a chest x - ray was unchanged other than a new mild pleural effusion .
a flexible bronchoscopy done on pod 5 showed the tracheal rupture in the initial healing phase .
she was transferred to the general floor on pod 6 .
a flexible bronchoscopy done on pod 8 showed further healing of the tracheal rupture ( figure 3 ) .
the remainder of her hospital course was uneventful , and she was discharged on pod 12 .
followup as an outpatient ( week 17 ) revealed a fully healed tracheal tear with evidence of tracheomalacia ( figure 4 ) .
3. discussion one of the rare complications of intubations is a tracheal tear .
estimates of its incidence in the last decade have ranged from approximately 0.05 % to 0.37 % of all orotracheal intubations [ 1 ] .
a variety of risk factors both mechanical and anatomical predispose a patient to such an injury .
notable risk factors include a difficult intubation , the use of a stylet , prolonged intubation , and over inflation of the cuff .
patient risk factors include advanced age , female sex , tracheal anomalies , history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and congenital tracheal anomalies such as tracheomalacia [ 2 - 4 ] .
it presents more frequently in women owing to a weaker pars membranosa and the use of endotracheal tubes of a larger size than appropriate for women [ 5 ] .
usually diagnosed postoperatively , common symptoms include subcutaneous emphysema , mediastinal emphysema [ 6 ] , pneumothorax , and hemoptysis .
tears under 2 cm are often asymptomatic [ 3 ] .
chest x - ray and ct scan show pneumomediastinum and / or pneumopericardium [ 3 , 6 ] .
ventilation studies can show a persistent air leak .
bronchoscopy is needed for definitive diagnosis and to evaluate the extent of the tear .
current management options for tracheal rupture are divided into conservative and surgical therapy .
in most iatrogenic cases , the wound is limited , and the airway is maintained , allowing for conservative management .
in traumatic injuries with loss of continuity in the proximal and distal part of the trachea , surgical intervention is required [ 3 ] .
surgical intervention is also recommended for complicated cases with rupture that extends into the main bronchi [ 4 ] .
a study done by cuesta et al. showed that conservative management is effective regardless of causation , size , or site of injury [ 7 ] .
conservative therapy includes orotracheal intubation , iv antibiotics , and parenteral nutrition .
the cuff pressure of the ett must be kept low and the tidal volume 5 - 6 ml / kg to expedite healing of the tear [ 6 ] .
extubation must be performed as soon as possible .
bronchoscopy should be utilized to monitor healing of the tear .
in this patient , the tracheal wall may have been compromised because of her undiagnosed tracheomalacia .
the tracheomalacia , in turn , may have been a sequela of the original surgery and her long - standing goiter .
although in this case intubation was atraumatic , the use of an nim emg ett in conjunction with undiagnosed tracheomalacia may have precipitated the tear .
the nim emg tube uses a silicone elastomer cuff to allow better tracheal conformity and minimal tissue trauma .
the designed elasticity may predispose the silicone - based cuff to asymmetrically inflate at very high cuff pressure [ 8 ] .
diagnosis of tracheobronchial injury can be made in a wide range of time periods .
however , a delay in the diagnosis has been shown to have poor outcomes [ 4 ] .
in our patient , the diagnosis of the tear was made intraoperatively , allowing a focused early management .

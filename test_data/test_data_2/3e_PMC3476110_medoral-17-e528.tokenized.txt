objectives : the aim of this study was to compare in vitro root fracture resistance following root canal filling with ah 26 using lateral condensation , beefill , and thermafil techniques .
study design : eighty extracted human mandibular premolars with similar dimensions were selected .
in order to standardize the roots , measurements were taken in two separate regions of the teeth - - at the cemento - enamel junction and 8 mm apically from the junction - - buccolingual as well as mesiodistal for every tooth .
teeth were then randomly divided into five groups ( n = 16 ). with the exception of the non - prepared group ( group 1 ) , instrumentation was done in all groups .
in group 2 , instrumentation but no filling was performed ; in group 3 , the obturation was done with ah 26 + gutta - percha ; in group 4 , with ah 26 + beefill and in group 5 , ah 26 + a thermafil obturator was used .
all the roots were mounted vertically in copper rings and filled with acrylic resin , exposing 8 mm of the coronal part .
a universal testing machine was used for the strength test .
results : the results were analyzed using the one - way anova test .
the significance between the groups was tested with temhane 's t2 test .
the results indicate that instrumentation of root canals had a significant effect on fracture resistance ( p < 0.05 ) .
in addition , there were no differences between the root canal obturation techniques ; furthermore , these techniques did not create a statistically important resistance to vertical fracture ( p > 0.05 ) .
conclusions : the results suggest that instrumentation of root canals significantly weakens the tooth structure to fracture and the root canal obturation techniques that are used are not able to form reinforcement .
key words : ah 26 , obturation technique , vertical fracture .
introduction an important cause of endodontic failure is root fracture , which is a serious clinical concern and results almost inevitably in extraction of the tooth or resection of the affected root ( 1 - 3 ) .
endodontically treated teeth are dramatically susceptible to root fracture ( 4,5 ) .
it has been reported that vertical root fractures result largely from operative procedures performed in the root canal after the root canal treatment ( 6 ) .
excessive loss of tissue during chemomechanical preparation ( 1,7,8 ) and excessive pressure during filling procedures ( 9 ) may play an important role in decreasing the resistance of teeth to fracture .
the researchers have examined the effects of root canal preparation techniques ( 1 ) , irrigation solutions ( 7 ) , root canal filling materials ( 2,5,7,10 - 12 ) and root canal filling methods ( 4,7,12,13 ) on the tooth 's resistance to fracture .
clinicians have long sought to reinforce the remaining tooth structure .
coronal reinforcement has been suggested with adhesive dental materials ( 7,14 ) , crown placements ( 11,15 ) , or fiber posts ( 15,16 ) to prevent unfavorable fractures after obturation .
however , in some cases , even properly restored teeth may fracture .
therefore , one of the goals of filling the root canal must be to reinforce the root canal dentin to increase fracture resistance ( 17 ) .
it is suggested that materials that can adhere to the root canal dentin surface will strengthen the remaining tooth structure ( 7,10 ) .
it was noted that ah 26 has a very good adhesion capability to dentin , as well as to gutta - percha ( 18 - 20 ) .
it has also been found that this effective adhesiveness capability does not change with heat application ( 21,22 ) , and that when used with gutta - percha , it increases resistance to vertical fracture ( 17,21 ) .
cold lateral condensation , warm vertical condensation ( beefill ) , and thermafil techniques are canal - filling methods widely used in endodontics ; they are very different from each other when it comes to implementation .
it is known that the different implementation procedures weaken the roots in different ways ( 12 ) .
at the same time , the possible increase in resistance to vertical root fracture through mechanisms such as adaptation and mechanical locking ( 11,17 ) shows a difference in canal - filling goals as a result of these different procedures .
the aim of the present study is to compare the fracture resistance of root canals filled with ah 26 and the cold lateral condensation , beefill , and thermafil techniques .
material and methods eighty extracted human mandibular premolars with single canals that were approximately of the same dimension were selected and stored in saline solution until required .
in order to standardize the roots used , measurements were made from every specimen at the cementoenamel junction ( cej ) and 8 mm more apical from the junction , in the buccolingual as well as mesiodistal direction of every specimen .
in this way , four measurements were taken for each specimen .
the measurements were made using a digital compass ( guanglu , china ) .
the following example measurements were included in the study the cej buccolingual diameter was 6.5 +/ - 0.3 mm and the mesiodistal diameter was 4.7 +/ - 0.2 ; in the 8 mm apical region , the buccolingual diameter was 4.8 +/ - 0.3 mm and the mesiodistal diameter was 3.1 +/ - 0.3 .
all teeth were examined with a microscope of 25x magnification to detect any preexisting fractures ; only intact teeth were included .
teeth were sectioned from the cej with a diamond bur used at high speed .
the verification of the samples being single canalled was done by an expert using a # 15 canal file ( dentsply maillefer , ballaigues , switzerland ) .
later during the instrumentation , only two samples were discovered to be double canalled and were removed from the experiment ; these were replaced with two different samples of the same dimensions .
except in the non - prepared group ( group 1 ) , the working length was determined to be 1 mm short of the apical foramen using a size 15 k - file .
the root canals were instrumented to an iso size 45 file at the apex and flared using a # 4 gates - glidden drill ( mani , japan ) .
during the instrumentation , irrigation with 1 ml of 2.5 % sodium hypochlorite ( wizard , rehber chemistry , istanbul , turkey ) was provided and a final rinse of 1 ml of 15 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( wizard , rehber chemistry , istanbul , turkey ) was used in order to remove the smear layer .
root canals were then flushed with saline solution and dried with paper points .
teeth were randomly divided into five groups of 16 teeth each .
group 1 : in this group , no root canal instrumentation was carried out .
a cavity for temporary filling was drilled into the canal to 1 mm below the cej with a # 4 gates glidden bur .
group 2 : in this group , root canals were not obturated and the group served as control .
the canal opening was sealed with cavit ( 3m espe ag , germany ) .
group 3 : the teeth were obturated with lateral condensation using ah 26 ( dentsply de trey gmbh , germany ) and gutta - percha ( aceone - endo , aceonedent. co. geonggi - do , korea ) .
ah 26 was mixed according to the manufacturer 's instructions and placed into the root canal with a lentulo spiral filler ( dentsply maillefer , ballaigues , switzerland ) .
a # 45 master gutta - percha cone was fit to the working length .
then , the gap for accessory cones was created consecutively using the numbers 35 , 30 , 25 , 20 , and 15 finger spreaders ( dentsply maillefer , ballaigues , switzerland ) .
excess gutta - percha was removed 1 mm below the canal opening .
the canal opening was sealed with cavit .
group 4 : the teeth were filled using the beefill ( vdw , munich , germany ) .
ah 26 was applied to the canal walls with a lentulo spiral filler .
number 45 master gutta - percha was fitted 3 mm short of the working length with a tug - back .
the beefill down - packing device was used for obturation of the apical part of the root canal system .
the coronal part of the root canal was filled with a backfilling device .
the heated gutta - percha was vertically compacted with pluggers ( dentsply maillefer , ballaigues , switzerland ) .
the canal opening was sealed with cavit .
group 5 : the prepared teeth were obturated using the thermafil technique with a plastic carrier .
ah 26 was placed into the root canal with a lentulo spiral filler .
a size 45 thermafil obturator with plastic carrier was heated in the thermaprep ( r ) plus oven ( densply , maillefer , ballaigues , switzerland ) .
the heated obturator was slowly inserted into the canal to the previously determined working length .
a plugger was used to condense the coronal gutta - percha around the carrier until the gutta - percha hardened .
the canal opening was sealed with cavit .
all roots were stored in 100 % humidity for two weeks to allow the sealer to set .
preparation of the mechanical test all the roots were mounted vertically in copper rings ( 20 mm high and 20 mm in diameter ) , filled with acrylic resin ( imicryl , konya , turkey ) , exposing 8 mm of the coronal part .
a universal testing machine ( instron corp. ma , usa ) was used for the strength test .
the acrylic blocks were placed on the lower plate of the machine .
the upper plate included a steel spherical tip with a diameter of 4 mm. the tip contacted a slowly increasing vertical force ( 1mm min - 1 ) until fracture occurred .
the force when the fracture occurred was recorded as newtons .
the results were analyzed using the one way anova test ( spss 10.0 , spss , chicago , usa ) .
significance between the groups was then tested with the temhane 's t2 test .
all statistical analysis was performed at the 95 % level of confidence .
results the distribution of median fracture values of each group are shown in ( table 1 ) .
temhane 's t2 test results indicated that preparation of the root canals significantly weakened the root structure to fracture ( p < 0.05 ) .
in addition , based on the results of this experimental study , there were no differences found between the root canal obturation techniques that were tested and these techniques did not create a statistically important resistance to vertical fracture .
table 1 force that is required to cause vertical root fracture ( measured in newtons ) .
discussion there is a perception that root canal treatment weakens tooth structure and predisposes teeth to fracture ( 13 ) .
researchers have examined the effects of different endodontic instrumentation and obturation techniques on vertical fractures , as well as how different root canal filling materials and techniques affect the resistance of the remaining tooth structure to vertical fractures ( 10,12,13,17,23 ). by standardizing the specimens , researchers have obtained valuable data showing that their experimental situations were appropriate .
however , effective factors such as preserving situations of the teeth , the height of the part of the tooth that remains outside of the acrylic base , the angle at which the tooth is placed inside the acrylic , and the length and shape of the steel tip showed quite a bit of variance among the studies .
even though every study resulted in valuable information according to the requirements of the study , researchers could reach different conclusions based on such factors ( 11,17 ) .
in this study , all of the controllable factors apart from the filling technique were standardized as much as possible .
all roots were instrumented using the same technique .
the age of the patient , the gutta - percha type used , and dentine sclerosis were not taken into account .
in order to standardize the conditions , the study included two separate regions of the teeth - - at the cej and 8 mm more apically from the junction - - with similar buccolingual as well as mesiodistal dimensions , on single canal mandibular premolar teeth .
it was mentioned that in previous studies measurements were done only the cej of the roots ( 5,7 ) .
in the present study , during the selection and standardization of the specimens , there were many roots with a similar diameter in the cej but that showed a difference in the 8 mm more apical section ; because of this , they were not be included in the study .
thus , we selected roots that were as similar as possible and assigned them randomly into groups .
because of its good adhesion capability to dentin and gutta - percha , ah 26 was used in this study ( 18 - 20,24 ) , and it has also been determined that this adhesion capability did not change with heat application ( 21,22 ) .
in this way , same adhesive capability was used for all three groups .
in this study , it was found that non - prepared group ( group 1 ) had higher resistance to vertical fracture than the prepared but unfilled group ( group 2 ) ( p < 0.05 ) .
the finding that preparation weakens roots and makes teeth susceptible to vertical fracture is supported by previous studies ( 4,5 ) .
this study showed that there was not statistical difference between the canal filled groups and the unfilled group ( p > 0.05 ) .
it has been reported that ah 26 was better than other tested materials and showed a resistance to fracture compared to unfilled group ( 17 ) .
it has also been found that there was no difference between the materials that were compared to ah 26 and that it had more resistance compared to the unfilled group ( 5,13 ) ; however , it has also been shown that ah 26 provided less resistance than the materials that 's compared to and there was no difference with the unfilled group ( 12 ) .
lateral and vertical gutta - percha compactions and thermo - plasticized gutta - percha techniques involve different procedures in endodontic therapy .
researchers have examined these techniques in terms of issues such as sealing ability ( 25 - 27 ) , caused to root strains ( 23 ) , and the effect of resistance to vertical fracture ( 12 ) .
in this study , which evaluated the effects of filling techniques that include different procedures on vertical fracture resistance , it was found that there is no statistically significant difference between the filling techniques , and that these techniques cannot form a resistance to vertical fracture ( p > 0.05 ) .
in studies that examine the resistance of various sealers to vertical fractures , researchers have reported different results concerning lateral condensation techniques .
some studies indicated that the lateral condensation group had higher resistance to vertical fracture than the unfilled group ( 5,13,17 ) , but there were also studies that indicate that there was no statistical difference between these techniques ( 7,11,12 ) .
in teixeira 's study ( 12 ) , which tested the effects of obturation and lateral condensation techniques on the fracture resistance , no statistically significant difference between these groups was found in relation to these two techniques and the unfilled group .
the results that we attained from our research support this study .
however , to our knowledge , there are no studies regarding the effects of thermafil technique on fracture resistance .
the results of this research showed that advantages or disadvantages of filling techniques such as homogenous , voids , spreader tracts , lack of surface , adaptation and amount of sealer were not effective on reinforcement of the roots .
under the conditions of this study , the resistance of the root to vertical fracture is decreased with instrumentation , and the root canal obturation techniques used are not able to provide reinforcement .

in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , members of the protein disulfide isomerase ( pdi ) family perform critical functions during protein maturation .
herein , we identify the previously uncharacterized pdi - family member erp90 .
in cultured human cells , we find erp90 to be a soluble er - luminal glycoprotein that comprises five potential thioredoxin ( trx ) - like domains .
mature erp90 contains 10 cysteine residues , of which at least some form intramolecular disulfides .
while none of the trx domains contain a canonical cys - xaa - xaa - cys active - site motif , other conserved cysteines could endow the protein with redox activity .
importantly , we show that erp90 co - immunoprecipitates with erfad , a flavoprotein involved in er - associated degradation ( erad ) , through what is most likely a direct interaction .
we propose that the function of erp90 is related to substrate recruitment or delivery to the erad retrotranslocation machinery by erfad .
introduction in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , critical protein maturation steps including n - glycosylation and disulfide - bond formation take place .
upon folding , native proteins can exit the er by the secretory pathway , whereas misfolded proteins and incompletely assembled protein complexes are generally retained by a protein quality control machinery [ 1 ] .
terminally misfolded proteins are degraded by the er - associated degradation ( erad ) pathway , which involves the retrotranslocation of protein substrates to the cytosol and proteasomal degradation [ 2 ] - [ 5 ] .
to alleviate unfolding , erad substrates that contain disulfide bonds might also have to be reduced before retrotranslocation [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
recently , erdj5 , a member of the protein disulfide isomerase ( pdi ) family , has been demonstrated to facilitate this reduction step for certain erad substrates [ 8 ] .
the electron donor for erdj5 remains to be identified , and neither is it clear whether erdj5 is the only reducing pdi - family member involved in erad .
the pdi family encompasses around twenty members in mammalian cells [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
these proteins perform functions in oxidative folding , protein retention , as chaperones and in erad .
all pdi - family members contain one or more domains with a thioredoxin ( trx ) fold .
this fold typically consists of an n - terminal betaalphabeta motif , a connecting loop containing one alpha - helix , and a c - terminal betabetaalpha motif .
the beta - strands form a central beta - sheet that is surrounded by the alpha - helices .
redox - active pdi - family members contain one or more so - called a type trx - like domains with an active site cxxc motif ( c : cys , x : any amino acid ) that localizes to the n - terminus of the second alpha - helix [ 11 ] .
the non - catalytic b type trx - like domains lack the active - site cysteines , but instead provide important functionalities in substrate binding and / or chaperone activity [ 12 ] - [ 14 ] .
we recently identified the er - luminal flavoprotein erfad ( er flavoprotein associated with degradation ; also known as foxred2 ) that participates in erad steps before retrotranslocation from the er , although the precise mechanism of action remains unresolved [ 15 ] .
erfad has also been shown to be upregulated by amyloid beta in rat cortical neurons and sh - sy5y cells [ 16 ] .
this upregulation correlated with amyloid beta neurotoxicity , the inhibition of proteasome activity and induced er stress - mediated cell death [ 16 ] .
erfad comprises consensus motifs for binding of the two redox cofactors flavin adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate .
when purified from human cells the protein binds flavin adenine dinucleotide , and we have proposed a potential redox - function of the protein in erad [ 15 ] .
in cells , erfad interacts with the erad factors os - 9 , erdj5 , and sel1l [ 15 ] .
here , we identify and characterize the previously unknown pdi - family member erp90 as a further interaction partner of erfad .
results co - immunoprecipitation with erfad identifies erp90 we recently found erfad to interact with a number of well - known erad components and several other proteins in a complex that could be stabilized by crosslinking [ 15 ] .
to further characterize this protein complex we sought to identify additional components .
to this end , we used a hek293 - derived cell line stably expressing erfad with an ha tag inserted immediately prior to the c - terminal keel sequence ( a11 cells , [ 15 ]). from a [ 35s ] - methionine - labeled extract of these cells we immunoprecipitated erfad - ha ( figure 1a ) .
the experiment revealed one clear candidate interacting protein that was not recovered from control cell lysates .
this protein had an apparent size of ~ 90 kda and contained endoglycosidase h ( endoh ) - sensitive glycans indicating localization in the early secretory pathway ( figure 1b ) .
the interaction was not dependent on the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds since the protein could be precipitated under reducing conditions ( figure 1a , lane 3 ) .
a similar result was obtained after pretreatment with the oxidant diamide ( figure 1a , lane 4 ) .
upscaling of the co - immunoprecipitation ( co - ip ) experiment allowed protein identification using an endoh - treated sample ( figure 1b ) .
after excision of the protein band from a sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) gel and trypsin digestion , mass spectrometry identified two proteins : sel1l ( as previously published [ 15 ]) and a hitherto uncharacterized protein ( refseq : np _ 065835 ; gene name : kiaa1344 ) ( figure s1 ) .
based on its mobility by sds - page and its er localization ( see below ) , we named this protein erp90 .
since we identified both sel1l and erp90 from the same band of the endoh - treated sample , a more detailed analysis necessitated the use of an erp90 antibody .
thus , we raised an antibody against a single purified domain of erp90 ( trx3 ; see below ) expressed in e. coli .
after affinity purification , this antiserum recognized the antigen ( data not shown ) , but did not detect a band corresponding to endogenous erp90 by western blot analysis of cell lysates .
however , we were able to re - precipitate endogenous erp90 from lysates of radioactively labeled a11 cells following ip of erfad - ha ( fig. 1c , lane 4 ) .
using this approach , and comparing to the migration of sel1l , we could demonstrate that the glycosylated 90 kda band coprecipitating with erfad - ha was erp90 ( fig. 1c ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0017037.g001 figure 1 identification of erp90 as novel protein interacting with erfad - ha .
( a ) immunoprecipitation of erfad - ha. cells stably expressing erfad - ha ( a11 ) and control cells ( frt ) not overexpressing the protein were [ 35s ] pulse - labeled for 16 hours , treated as indicated , triton x - 100 lysates immunoprecipitated with anti - ha , and samples separated by reducing sds - page .

( c ) immunoprecipitations on lysates of a11 cells that were [ 35s ] pulse - labeled to steady state were performed with anti - ha. the immunoprecipitate was either analyzed directly ( lane 1 ) or reimmunoprecipitated using ha - ( lane 2 ) , sel1l - ( lane 3 ) or erp90 - ( lane 4 ) antibodies .
the positions of the individual proteins are indicated and the glycosylated 90 kda band coprecipitating with erfad - ha can thereby be attributed to erp90 .
the hairline indicates that one lane has been removed .
erp90 is a member of the pdi family the human erp90 cdna encodes a protein of 825 amino acids ( figure 2a and 2c ) .
the n - terminal 27 residues are predicted to constitute an er signal sequence , whereas no obvious er retrieval motif is present at the c - terminus ( see below ) .
the mature erp90 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 90.5 kda. by secondary structure prediction we identified five potential trx - like domains ( trx1 - 5 ) in erp90 ( figure 2b ) .
such domains are a hallmark of proteins of the pdi family [ 11 ] .
however , none of the five trx domains in erp90 contain the typical active - site cxxc motif of redox - active trx - like domains .
blast searching revealed the pdi - family member erp57 as the closest homologue of erp90 .
specifically , similarity is observed between the trx3 - 5 domains of erp90 and the abb ' domains of erp57 , with the erp90 trx3 and erp57a domains showing the highest sequence similarity ( figure s2 ) .
it is noteworthy that the regular secondary structure elements determined experimentally in erp57abb ' show a high degree of conservation with those predicted in the corresponding region of erp90 ( figure s2 ) , supporting the assignment of the erp90 trx3 - 5 domains .

( c ) the amino acid sequence of erp90 with the five trx domains color - coded as in ( a ) .
above the sequence , the location of predicted secondary structure elements are shown ( cylinders indicate alpha - helices , and arrows beta - strands ) .
the n - terminal helix is part of the signal sequence .
cysteines are colored yellow , and the asterisks (*) mark four consensus sites for n - glycosylation .
database searching revealed orthologs of erp90 in a number of vertebrates , urochordates and in s. purpuratus ( a sea urchin ) , but not in the model organisms s. cerevisiae , d. melanogaster and c. elegans .
an alignment of different erp90 orthologs revealed high conservation over almost the complete erp90 sequence ( figure s3 ) .
for instance , the sequence identity between the human ( residues 42 - 819 ) and xenopus tropicalis sequences was 48 % .
human erp90 contains a total of 10 cysteine residues in the mature protein and four predicted n - glycosylation sites ( figure 2c ) .
three of the five predicted trx - like domains contain short conserved di - cysteine motifs ( trx1 : cx8c , trx2 : cx9c , trx3 : cx6c ; figure 2c and s3 ) .
in trx1 and trx3 these motifs are located in equivalent positions with the first cysteine placed in the loop following beta3 and the second positioned in alpha3 .
several pdi proteins contain similar motifs in this position , e.g. erp57a ( figure s2 ) where the two cysteines form a structural disulfide .
the cx9c motif in trx2 localizes in a different position to a predicted loop region further c - terminal in the sequence ( see fig. 2c ) .
in addition , a seventh cysteine in position 664 ( trx5 ) is conserved in almost all orthologs ( figure s3 ) .
it is noteworthy that one of the four consensus sites for n - glycosylation in the human erp90 sequence is also conserved in a high number of orthologs ( n460 located in the predicted loop between alpha3 and beta4 in trx3 ) , indicating an important structural and / or functional role .
the human erp90 protein contains a c - terminal extension compared to its orthologs the erp90 gene is located on chromosome 14q22.1 , and is predicted to cover 121.91 kb of genomic dna and contain 21 exons .
the transcript length is predicted to 4.56 kb excluding the polya tail ( figure 3a ) .
we confirmed this prediction by northern blot analysis using probes directed against the erp90 mrna ( figure 3b ) .
here , we detected one clear band that migrated at approximately 5 kb. subsequent in silico ( not shown ) and rt - pcr analyses showed a broad tissue and cell line distribution of human erp90 transcripts ( figure 3c ) .

vertical lines indicate positions of the 21 predicted exons .
( b ) northern blot detection of the erp90 mrna in human tissue - culture cells .
a nitrocellulose membrane with rna from three different human tissue - culture cell lines was hybridized with a radioactively labeled erp90 cdna probe ( top ) .
the rrna signals served as loading controls ( bottom ) .
( c ) rt - pcr analysis of erp90 .
total rna was isolated from various human tissue - culture cells , reverse transcribed and amplified with primers specific for erp90 and actin .
hela : cervical epithelial carcinoma ; huh7 , hepg2 : hepatocellular carcinoma ; cf - pac - 1 : pancreatic adeno carcinoma ; a375 , meljuso : melanoma ; ht1080 : fibrosarcoma breast cancer ; ovcar3 , skov3 : ovarian epithelial carcinoma ; lrb003 , lrb010 : embryonic stem cells .
curiously , the human erp90 protein is predicted to contain an additional six amino acids at the c terminus compared to all other orthologs ( figure s3 ) .
moreover , the c - terminal four residues of the orthologs display similarity to a canonical kdel er - retrieval sequence ( figure s3 ) .
to determine the sequence of the erp90 c - terminus we first isolated total mrna from both hek293 and ht1080 cells , and performed reverse transcription .
we then amplified a region of the erp90 cdna that covers the 3 ' end of the erp90 open reading frame and the beginning of the 3 ' untranslated region .
subsequent sequencing of the pcr products revealed that the human erp90 gene in both cell lines indeed does encode for a c - terminally extended form of the protein ( data not shown ) .
identification of a disulfide bond in recombinant erp90 trx3 for biochemical studies on erp90 we first expressed the full - length protein in e.coli .
however , we only succeeded in purifying small amounts of erp90 extracted from inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions .
we therefore decided to purify a single thioredoxin - like domain of erp90 .
due to the relatively high sequence similarity with erp57a ( figure s2 ) , we chose to work with erp90 trx3 .
using this domain , we tested whether the cysteines in the cx6c motif form a disulfide bond .
here , we employed a gel shift assay based on alkylation with the maleimide reagent 4 - acetamido - 4 ' - maleimidylstilbene - 2,2 ' - disulfonic acid ( ams ) ( figure 4b ) .
ams efficiently reacts with free , but not with oxidized cysteines .
in our experience , for proteins up to around 50 kda modification of even just two cysteines with ams ( molecular weight : 499 da ) can add sufficient additional mass to introduce a detectable mobility shift by sds - page ( see e.g. [ 17 ]) .
while the untreated erp90 trx3 domain did not shift upon ams incubation , we observed full modification when erp90 trx3 was incubated with the reductant dithiothreitol ( dtt ) at 95degreesc under denaturing conditions prior to ams treatment ( figure 4b , compare lanes 2 and 3 ) .
when incubating erp90 trx3 with dtt at 25degreesc under native conditions only a minor fraction of the trx3 molecules became accessible for modification with ams ( figure 4b , lane 4 ) .
these data indicate that the two cysteines of the cx6c motif in erp90 trx3 form a structural disulfide bond , as is the case for the cysteines of this motif in erp57a [ 18 ] - [ 20 ] , the a - domain of yeast pdi ( pdi1pa ) [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] and in all six trx - like domains of erdj5 [ 23 ] .

the samples were then subjected to sds - page and proteins were visualized by coomassie - staining .

erp90 is a soluble glycoprotein of the er to analyze endogenous erp90 in cells , we used our erp90 antiserum in a double ip approach ( see material and methods ) .
thereby , we were able to precipitate endogenous erp90 as well as overexpressed myc - erp90 from lysates of radioactively labeled cells ( figure 5a and s4 , respectively ) .
as expected for an er protein with four potential n - glycosylation sites , the band representing endogenous erp90 showed increased mobility upon endoh cleavage ( figure 5a ) .
due to the rather low quality of the erp90 antiserum we used transient expression of myc - tagged erp90 in hek293 cells for further experiments .
the myc - erp90 used was the full - length human protein including the c - terminal extension that we verified by rt - pcr ( see above and figure s3 ) .

hek293 cells transiently overexpressing myc - erp90 were lysed after preincubation with the cell - permeable alkylating agent nem to block free cysteines .

then , originally oxidized cysteines were modified with ams .
the resulting samples were analyzed by western blotting with anti - myc .

crude membranes were isolated and extracted with sodium carbonate .

the distribution of myc - erp90 , erp57 ( a soluble er protein ) and tmx3 ( an er membrane protein ) was visualized by western blotting .
asterisk , background band .
( e ) confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of hek293 cells transiently expressing myc - erp90 .
hek293 cells transiently co - expressing myc - erp90 ( red ) and gfp - kdel ( green ) were fixed , and stained with anti - myc .
a merged image is shown in the right panel .
in accordance with the results for endogenous erp90 we found that myc - erp90 migrated at ~ 95 kda ( figure 5b ) .
myc - erp90 displayed endoh sensitivity and , upon dtt treatment , decreased gel mobility was observed ( figure 5b ) .
thus , at least some of the 10 cysteines in mature erp90 were engaged in intramolecular disulfide bonds .
to confirm the presence of disulfide bonds in erp90 we used an alternative approach that has previously been applied to visualize the cx6c disulfide bond in erp57a [ 17 ] .
we first blocked free cysteines in situ using the alkylating agent n - ethyl maleimide ( nem ) .
after cell lysis , we then reduced disulfide - bonded cysteines and modified them with ams. by this procedure , only cysteines that were oxidized in the cell become modified with ams .
this approach confirmed that some of the cysteines in erp90 are engaged in disulfide bonds ( figure 5c ) , in agreement with the in vitro analysis of trx3 ( fig. 4b ) that was performed under comparable experimental conditions ( i.e. sds denaturation at high temperature , reduction and then modification with ams ) .
next , we used alkali extraction of crude membranes isolated from hek293 cells expressing myc - erp90 to investigate whether the protein was soluble or membrane - bound .
the membranes were extracted using sodium carbonate at ph 11.3 , and the soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation before analyzing the presence of myc - erp90 in either fraction by western blotting .
we found all myc - erp90 in the same fraction as erp57 ( the control for soluble proteins ) , but not in the fraction containing the membrane protein tmx3 ( figure 5d ) , clearly indicating erp90 to be a soluble protein .
the endoh sensitivity of erp90 already indicated a localization of the protein to the secretory pathway .
however , due to the absence of an er - retrieval signal it remained unclear whether erp90 indeed was an er - resident protein .
using immunofluorescence microscopy we observed a reticular staining pattern for transiently expressed myc - erp90 and co - localization with an er - targeted variant of the green fluorescent protein ( gfp - kdel ) ( figure 5e ) .
at the same time , a small fraction of myc - erp90 was detected in the culture medium ( data not shown ) .
however , we consider the latter finding to be a likely result of overexpression , which could well saturate the retention mechanism for erp90 .
overall , the data show that erp90 is a soluble , disulfide - containing glycoprotein of the er .
erp90 forms a stable interaction with erfad next , we wanted to characterize the interaction between erfad and erp90 in more detail .
we first immunoprecipitated erfad - ha from a11 cells using anti - ha , and then analyzed the precipitate by western blotting with anti - erp90 ( figure 6a ) .
we also immunoprecipitated myc - tagged erp90 overexpressed in hek293 cells with anti - myc , and analyzed the eluted proteins by western blotting with anti - erfad ( figure 6b ) .
the results clearly showed that erfad - ha specifically co - precipitated endogenous erp90 ( figure 6a , compare lanes 2 and 4 ) and myc - erp90 co - precipitated endogenous erfad ( figure 6b , compare lanes 2 and 4 ) .
importantly , ip of erfad from [ 35s ] - methionine - labeled hek293 cell lysates followed by re - ip against erp90 confirmed the interaction between the two endogenous proteins ( figure 6c , lane 4 ) .
to obtain an indication of whether erp90 and erfad interact directly , we tested if we could purify the complex of erp90 and erfad from metabolically labeled cells that expressed tagged versions of both proteins ( 3b2b - myc - erp90 cells expressing erfad - flag and myc - erp90 ) ( figure 6d ) .
first , we immunoprecipitated erfad - flag under native conditions taking care to elute the precipitated proteins under mild conditions using the flag peptide .
we then performed a second native ip against the myc tag of erp90 .
when we analyzed this latter precipitate we found that the predominant species purified were erfad - ha and myc - erp90 ( figure 6d , lane 3 ) suggesting a stable and direct interaction between erfad and erp90 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0017037.g006 figure 6 analysis of the erp90 - erfad interaction .
( a ) erp90 co - immunoprecipitates with erfad - ha. ips from a11 or hek293 cell lysates were performed with anti - ha , and analyzed by western blotting with antibodies against erp90 and the ha tag .
0.2 % of the total lysate were directly analyzed as input .
asterisk , background band .
( b ) erfad co - immunoprecipitates with myc - erp90 .
anti - myc immunoprecipitates from lysates of hek293 cells transiently overexpressing myc - erp90 or an empty vector ( mock ) were subjected to western blotting using the indicated antibodies .
asterisk , background band .
( c ) endogenous erfad co - immunoprecipitates endogenous erp90 .
erfad was immunoprecipitated from [ 35s ] pulse - labeled hek293 cells using a pre - immune serum or an erfad antiserum .
the immunoprecipitate was either analyzed directly ( lanes 1 and 2 ; one tenth of first immunoprecipitate loaded ) or re - immunoprecipitated with antibodies against erfad ( lane 3 ) or erp90 ( lane 4 ; three times the amount compared to the erfad re - immunoprecipitation in lane 3 ) .
the hairline indicates where a lane has been removed from the autoradiograph .
( d ) overexpressed erfad - his - flag and myc - erp90 can be co - purified .
3b2b - myc - erp90 cells were [ 35s ] pulse - labeled overnight and subjected to anti - flag ip. erfad - his - flag and its interacting partners were eluted with the flag peptide under native conditions ( lanes 1 and 2 ) , and subsequently re - immunoprecipitated with anti - myc under native conditions ( lane 3 ) .
discussion in this study we identify erp90 as a new member of the pdi family and an interaction partner of the erad component erfad .
moreover , our preliminary data indicate that , like erfad [ 15 ] , erp90 can be crosslinked to a larger complex of proteins .
at least certain of the bands in the two complexes immunoisolated with antibodies against erfad and erp90 , respectively , migrate at the same apparent molecular mass ( data not shown ) .
based on these finding we cannot rule out entirely that erfad and erp90 interact indirectly through other components of this complex .
however , since the interaction between the two proteins withstands re - ip and because other proteins were much less abundant in the precipitate , we currently favor the idea that the interaction is direct .
the interaction between erp90 and erfad strongly implies a functional link .
this notion is reinforced by the presence of the two proteins in the same set of organisms .
since we did not succeed in performing sirna - mediated knockdown experiments of erp90 to study an involvement of erp90 in erad , we can presently only speculate about the function of erp90 in relation to erfad .
while erfad likely catalyzes a redox reaction , erp90 could recruit misfolded proteins to the complex by virtue of its redox - inactive thioredoxin - like domains .
substrates bound by the complex of erfad and erp90 could then be delivered and handed over to sel1l , a function resembling the one recently described for os - 9 and grp94 [ 24 ] .
alternatively , erfad and erp90 could work on substrates already bound by sel1l or os - 9 , and potentially also assist the transfer of substrates from either of these proteins to a retrotranslocation channel .
finally , erp90 could perform a cxxc - independent redox function , conceivably in collaboration with the redox - active erfad , through the conserved c664 or even the cx9c motif in the trx2 .
future work should allow us to distinguish between these various possibilities .

a polyclonal serum against erp90 ( anti - erp90 ) was generated by immunizing rabbits with the trx3 domain of erp90 purified from e. coli ( see below ) .
the obtained antiserum ( 56e ) was affinity purified as follows : after sds - page , purified erp90 trx3 was blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane .
the membrane was stained with ponceau red and the region containing erp90 trx3 was cut out .
the obtained nitrocellulose " strips " were blocked and then incubated with the anti - erp90 serum overnight at 4degreesc .
strips were then washed , transferred to low salt buffer ( 10 mm tris / hcl ph 7.5 ; 10 mm nacl ) , and the antibodies eluted with a low ph buffer ( 100 mm glycine / hcl ph 2.8 ) .
the eluted antibody was immediately neutralized with 5 m naoh and 1 m tris , dialyzed overnight into pbs , concentrated , and supplemented with glycerol ( to 50 %) .
cell lines the generation of cell lines overexpressing erfad - ha ( a11 ) and erfad - his - flag ( 3b2b ) has been described [ 15 ] .

the cell lysate was then incubated at 95degreesc for 5 - 10 min and either analyzed directly or treated with tcep at 25degreesc for 15 min .
ams was added to a final concentration of 20 mm , and incubated in the dark for 1 h at 25degreesc followed by the addition of laemmli sample buffer .
samples were analyzed by sds - page and western blot. e. coli expression , purification and ams modification of recombinant erp90 trx3 a fusion protein of maltose binding protein ( mbp , positioned n - terminally ) and the trx3 domain of erp90 ( positioned c - terminally ) connected with a factor xa ( fxa ) cleavage site was expressed in the shuffle t7 express strain of e. coli ( new england biolabs , ma , usa ) .
shuffle cells pre - transformed with a plasmid for erv1 and dsbc expression regulated by an arabinose - inducible promotor ( pfh255 ; kindly provided by dr. lloyd ruddock , university of oulu ) were transformed with pmal - c2x / mbp - xa - erp90 trx3 .
lb broth containing 100 microg / ml ampicilin and 34 microg / ml chloramphenicol was inoculated with a single colony and grown overnight at 37degreesc .
this culture was diluted to od600 0.05 and grown at 37degreesc .
at od600 ~ 0.3 , the incubation temperature was changed to 16degreesc .
at od600 ~ 0.4 , pre - expression of erv1 and dsbc was induced by the addition of 0.5 % w / v arabinose , and 40 min later , 0.5 mm iptg was added to induce expression of erp90 trx3 .
cells were grown overnight , pelleted , and resuspended in lysis buffer ( 20 mm tris - hcl , 200 mm nacl , 1 mm edta , 0.1 % triton x - 100 ( v / v ) , 100 microm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , complete edta - free protease inhibitor tablet ( roche , switzerland ) , ph 7.4 ) .
after sonication , the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,500 g for 30 min at 4degreesc .
the cleared lysate was loaded at rt onto an amylose resin ( new england biolabs , ma , usa ) gravity - flow column pre - equilibrated with column buffer ( 20 mm tris - hcl , 200 mm nacl , ph 7.4 ) .
the column was extensively washed with column buffer and eluted in the same buffer containing 10 mm maltose .
pooled elution fractions were incubated in 10 mm nem at 4degreesc for 1 h to block free thiols and dialyzed against fxa buffer ( 20 mm tris - hcl , 50 mm nacl , 1 mm cacl2 , ph 7.4 ) .
the mpb - erp90 trx3 fusion protein was cleaved with 3.5 u fxa ( qiagen , germany ) per mg protein for 12 h at rt. fxa was inactivated by the addition of 200 microm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and the cleaved protein was dialyzed against low salt buffer ( 20 mm tris - hcl , 20 mm nacl , ph 8.5 ) before loading it onto a 1 ml mono q hr 5 / 5 anion - exchange column ( ge healthcare , uk ) mounted on an aktaexplorer .
subsequent to washing in low salt buffer , proteins were eluted with a linear gradient developed over 40 min at 1 ml / min into high salt buffer ( 20 mm tris - hcl , 0.5 m nacl , ph 8.5 ) .
the correct molecular mass of erp90 trx3 was verified by matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization mass spectrometry ( expected : 13039 da ; experimentally determined : 13036 da ) .
the purified protein was used for gel shift assays after alkylation with ams .
aliquots of erp90 trx3 in 20 mm tris - hcl , 1 m nacl , ph 8.5 were incubated under native or denaturing conditions ( 2 % sds ) , and treated with 10 mm dtt at 95degreesc ( sds - containing sample ) or room temperature ( rt ) ( all other samples ) for 5 min .
thiol - disulfide exchange reactions were quenched and proteins were precipitated with 10 % tca followed by the addition of 0.1 % deoxycholate .
samples were incubated on ice for 30 min , centrifuged 15 min at 4degreesc at 16,100 g and the supernatant was removed .
the pellet was resolubilized and denatured in 0.5 m tris - hcl , 2 % sds , 0.04 % ( w / v ) bromocresol purple , ph 7.0 and incubated at 95degreesc for 2 min .
following the addition of 15 mm ams , the samples were titrated with 1.5 m tris - hcl , ph 8.8 until the color changed from yellow to purple ( bromocresol purple changes color between ph 5.2 - 6.8 ) , and incubated in the dark for 1 h at rt followed by the addition of laemmli sample buffer .
samples were analyzed on coomassie - stained 18 % tris - glycine sds - page gels .
metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitations pulse - chase experiments with [ 35s ] express protein labeling mix ( perkinelmer ) and ip from cell lysates were performed as described [ 15 ] .

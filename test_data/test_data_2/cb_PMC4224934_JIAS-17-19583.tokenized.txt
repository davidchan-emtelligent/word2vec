introduction the approved dose of tenofovir disproxil fumarate , 300 mg once daily , was established in clinical trials in combination with efavirenz , which does not significantly affect tenofovir concentrations .
combining tenofovir with lopinavir / r , darunavir / r or atazanavir / r increases tenofovir concentrations , which could raise the risk of renal adverse events .
newly approved tenofovir tablets are available at lower strength ( 200 or 250 mg ) for use in paediatrics .
methods a literature search was used to assess the effects of lopinavir / r , darunavir / r and atazanavir / r on tenofovir plasma cmax , auc and cmin ( geometric mean ratio and 90 % confidence intervals ) .
assuming linear dose - proportional pharmacokinetics ( as observed in dose - ranging studies ) , the 250 mg tablet was predicted to achieve plasma concentrations 17 % lower than the 300 mg dose , and the 200 mg tablet to achieve plasma levels 33 % lower .
effects on tenofovir plasma cmax , auc and cmin concentrations were assessed for combined dosing of each protease inhibitor with 250 or 200 mg daily doses of tenofovir , versus standard dose tenofovir ( 300 mg daily ) without protease inhibitors .
results in drug - drug interaction studies , lopinavir / ritonavir significantly increased tenofovir cmax , auc and cmin .
effects of each pi on tenofovir cmin were greater than effects on cmax or auc .
using a 250 mg paediatric dose of tenofovir with lopinavir / ritonavir , tenofovir cmin was predicted to remain higher than tenofovir 300 mg used with efavirenz ( gmr = 1.26 , 95 % ci 1.14 - 1.38 ) .
similar results were observed for use of tenofovir 250 mg with atazanavir / ritonavir ( gmr = 1.07 , 95 % ci 1.01 - 1.13 ) and with darunavir / ritonavir ( gmr = 1.14 , 95 % ci 0.99 - 1.31 ) .
predicted tenofovir auc levels for the 250 mg dose with protease inhibitors were all within the bioequivalence range , relative to use with efavirenz .
using a 200 mg paediatric dose of tenofovir with lopinavir / ritonavir , the tenofovir cmin was predicted to be bioequivalent to tenofovir 300 mg used with efavirenz ( gmr = 1.02 , 95 % ci 0.92 - 1.11 ) .
similar results were observed for use of tenofovir 200 mg with atazanavir / ritonavir ( gmr = 0.86 , 95 % ci 0.82 - 0.91 ) and with darunavir / ritonavir ( gmr = 0.92 , 95 % ci 0.80 - 1.05 ) .
all three results were within the bioequivalence limits of 0.8 - 1.25 .
conclusions use of approved paediatric doses of tenofovir ( 200 - 250 mg once daily ) in combination with lopinavir / r,darunavir / r or atazanavir / r could compensate for known drug interactions .
this dose modification could potentially improve renal safety .

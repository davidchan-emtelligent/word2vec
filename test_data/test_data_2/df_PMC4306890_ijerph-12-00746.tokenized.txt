a mathematical model for the simulation of the removal of hydrophilic compounds using biotrickling filtration was developed .
the model takes into account that biotrickling filters operate by using an intermittent spraying pattern .
during spraying periods , a mobile liquid phase was considered , while during non - spraying periods , a stagnant liquid phase was considered .
the model was calibrated and validated with data from laboratory - and industrial - scale biotrickling filters .
the laboratory experiments exhibited peaks of pollutants in the outlet of the biotrickling filter during spraying periods , while during non - spraying periods , near complete removal of the pollutant was achieved .
the gaseous outlet emissions in the industrial biotrickling filter showed a buffered pattern ; no peaks associated with spraying or with instantaneous variations of the flow rate or inlet emissions were observed .
the model , which includes the prediction of the dissolved carbon in the water tank , has been proven as a very useful tool in identifying the governing processes of biotrickling filtration .
biotrickling filtration air pollution control volatile organic compounds mathematical modelling 1 .
introduction control of volatile organic compound ( voc ) emissions from industry is nowadays a priority in air quality regulation .
in the european union ( eu ) , directive 1999 / 13 / ec , recently modified by directive 2010 / 75 / eu , pursues the reduction of voc emissions .
according to data from the european environment agency , the sector of " solvents and product use " contributes 44 % of the emissions of non - methane voc in the eu ; a reduction of 42 % from 1990 to 2012 has been reported with a release of 2951 gg in 2012 [ 1 ] .
the industrial use of solvents typically releases waste gas streams where the flow is high (> 1000 m3.h - 1 ) and the voc concentration is low (< 5 g.m - 3 ) .
bioprocesses are best suited to the control of these emissions due to the low concentration of pollutants [ 2 ] .
among bioprocesses , biotrickling filtration is recommended for compounds with henry 's law constants below 0.1 [ 3 ] , such as ethanol , n - propanol or isopropanol , the main pollutants of the waste gas streams emitted from flexible food packaging industries ( flexographic sector ) .
a biotrickling filter ( btf ) consists of a column filled with an inert packing material , where the biomass attaches to the media and develops a biofilm .
in this configuration , the gas and liquid phases circulate through the column in co - or counter - current mode .
depending on the operation mode , the btf process involves a continuous or intermittent trickling of water .
despite the fact that btfs have been successfully applied for the treatment of air pollutants , the use of btfs depends on the increase of operational knowledge to allow the robustness of the performance .
as has been recognized , the performance of btf is markedly dependent on the operational conditions .
parameters , such as liquid velocity , gas velocity and empty bed residence time ( ebrt ) and inlet concentrations , may hinder the performance of field - scale btfs [ 4,5,6 ] .
thus , further research for a better understanding of the role of those parameters would be desirable [ 7 ] .
several efforts have been made to adapt the operational conditions of laboratory experiments to emulate the operational conditions usually experienced in industrial applications [ 6 ] .
one of the most common practices in industrial btfs in comparison with laboratory studies is the use of intermittent trickling of water .
san valero et al .
[ 8 ] observed that a spraying regime of 15 min every 1.5 h resulted in peaks of concentration coinciding with the irrigation of the bed when treating isopropanol .
we concluded that the frequency of irrigation is a crucial parameter in terms of the achievement of low emissions under intermittent loading of highly - soluble compounds .
biotrickling filtration involves a complex combination of several physical , chemical and biological processes ; further investigation , in order to integrate the phenomena occurring during treatment , is required .
mathematical modelling is a fundamental tool in the development of an understanding of the process .
additionally , as pointed out by lu et al .
[ 9 ] , effective modelling can lead to the development of a trustworthy performance equation that decreases the time and cost of experimentation on the pilot scale .
thus , phenomenological models based on the main mechanisms on biofiltration seem to be useful in improving the understanding of btfs and in identifying the governing processes involved in their operation .
the phenomenological model most commonly used during the last few decades was developed by ottengraf and van den oever [ 10 ] for biofilters operating under steady - state conditions .
following this study , many models for biofilters have been reported in the literature , adding new phenomena , such as adsorption in the packing material and the inhibition kinetics of microbial growth , among others [ 11 ] .
as an example , shareefdeen et al .
[ 12 ] included both oxygen and substrate inhibition effects ; this model was improved by assuming the partial coverage of the support particles by biofilm and by modelling the adsorption on the uncovered particles by using the freundlich isotherm [ 13 ] .
most mathematical models of btfs and trickle bed biofilters are based on mechanisms that have been used to describe biofilter behavior .
usually , a three - phase model ( gas - liquid - biofilm ) is used to describe these configurations .
the main difference with biofilter models is related to the presence of a liquid phase , often simulated as an intermediate step between the gas phase and the biofilm .
in steady state conditions , mpanias and baltzis [ 14 ] were the first to develop a model that takes into account the kinetic limitations arising from the availability of vocs and oxygen in btf .
this model was extended to voc mixtures [ 15 ] .
concerning non - steady state conditions , okkerse et al .
[ 16 ] presented a dynamic btf model for the degradation of volatile acidifying pollutants , as well as mass accumulation and mass distribution along the column .
zhu et al .
[ 5 ] proposed a dynamic three - phase system with a non - uniform bacterial population to show the effect of mass transfer limitations due to the water phase in the reactor for the removal of diethyl ether .
kim and deshusses [ 17 ] developed a dynamic btf model for the removal of h2s with gas and liquid phase flowing counter - current , where the biofilm on the packing material was not completely wetted .
in this model , a fraction of the pollutant was transferred directly from the gas phase to the biofilm , while another fraction was transferred through the liquid phase to the biofilm .
recently , almenglo et al .
[ 18 ] modified the kim and deshusses model by assuming a stagnant liquid fraction distributed homogeneously along the bed ; mass balances in the biofilm were divided into " flowing " biofilm ( which is in contact with flowing liquid ) and " stagnant " biofilm ( which is in contact with stagnant liquid ) .
lee and heber [ 19 ] proposed a model modified from that of alonso et al .
[ 20 ] in order to develop a genetic algorithm to estimate the unknown parameters in ethylene removal .
iliuta et al .
[ 21 ] developed a predictive dynamic model in a trickle - bed bioreactor based on the macroscopic volume - averaged mass and momentum balance equations coupled with classical diffusion and bioreaction equations to illustrate the influence of biomass accumulation on a bioreactor for toluene removal .
these authors showed that shifting from a biofilter to a trickle - bed bioreactor reduces the removal efficiency , due to an extra liquid - film mass transfer resistance step .
however , despite the fact that these models provide valuable information on the understanding of the behavior of bioreactors , there is still a lack of information with respect to models adapted to industrial emissions characterized by an intermittent spraying pattern , variable gas flow rate and variable inlet concentration .
in this regard , more effort is required to obtain more realistic simulations and to identify the main differences in the observed behavior between the laboratory scale and the industrial scale .
as was pointed out by devinny and ramesh [ 22 ] , no single model has become generally accepted .
the aim of the present research is to go deeper into the intricacies of the treatment of hydrophilic compounds using biotrickling filtration technology .
for this purpose , a mathematical model was developed to simulate the performance of btfs , taking into account the main operational conditions found in the industry .
the model presented herein was prepared for simulating systems with complex inlet concentration patterns , gas flow rates and cyclic conditions of spraying .
an intermittent spraying regime implies that the liquid phase varies during the filter operation , making it necessary to distinguish two different situations , corresponding to spraying and non - spraying periods .
in addition , the operation of btf usually requires more than one spraying pattern during the same day related to periods with different feeding conditions or clogging control , among others .
in this regard , the model is able to combine these two different patterns .
the following objectives have been achieved : ( 1 ) developing a dynamic mathematical model based on different behaviors during spraying and non - spraying periods combined with variable inlet concentration and variable gas flow rate ; ( 2 ) calibrating and validating the model with data from btf at the laboratory scale using isopropanol as the target pollutant ; and ( 3 ) validating the model with data from a btf located in an industrial facility from the flexographic sector .
2. experimental section 2.1 .
experimental set - up and btf operational conditions for the experiments at laboratory scale two sets of independent data were used to test the mathematical model .
the first set corresponds to data from laboratory experiments using isopropanol as the target pollutant .
the experiments were performed using a laboratory - scale btf composed of three cylindrical methacrylate modules in series , with a total bed length of 100 cm and an internal diameter of 14.4 cm. the btf was filled with a random packing material of 25 mm in diameter ( flexiring : superficial area ( a ) = 207 m2.m - 3 ; porosity of the packing material ( thetapm ) = 0.92 ) , using a volume of the bed of 16.32 l. the btf had 20 cm of free spaces at the top and bottom of the column and was equipped with 3 equidistant sampling ports .
the stream was contaminated with isopropanol , which was introduced through the bottom of the column .
a recirculation solution was fed into the bioreactor in counter - current mode with respect to the air flow using a centrifugal pump at 2.5 l.min - 1 from a tank with 3.5 l of solution .
an air stream polluted with vocs was supplied to the btf for 16 h per day ( starting at 8:00 am ) , while the rest of the time ( 8 h ) , the btf was supplied with clean air , maintaining a constant air flow rate .
a btf inoculated with activated sludge ran for more than 3 months with an inlet load ( il ) of 30 g - c.m - 3.h - 1 , ebrt of 60 s and intermittent spraying. with this il , two consecutive intermittent spraying patterns ( run 1 and run 2 ) were applied during a minimum of a 2 - week period .
table 1 summarizes the performance of the system during the last 5 days ( from monday to friday ) of each of the runs ( 1 and 2 ) .
then , the inlet load was increased to 60 g - c.m - 3.h - 1 for 2 weeks .
run 3 ( table 1 ) summarizes the performance of the system during the final week ( from monday to wednesday ) .
each run started with clean water in the recirculation tank .
no purges were undertaken until the end of each run .
the pressure drop was negligible (< 1 pa.m - 1 ) .
the liquid hold - up ( thetal ) had an average value of 0.093 +/ - 0.003 .
the biofilm content was gravimetrically determined ( mass contained in two rings extracted from each of the three sampling ports ) .
the volume fraction of the biofilm ( thetab ) calculated from the biofilm content of the bioreactor ( specific gravity of 1 ) resulted in a value of 0.18 +/ - 0.04 .
the water content of the biofilm was measured as 95 +/ - 3 % ; 50 kg.m - 3 of biomass concentration ( xv ) , which was selected as the average value for modelling purposes .

2.2 .
experimental set - up and btf operational conditions for the field scale data from an industrial btf ( vocustm , pas solutions bv , the netherlands ) located at a flexographic industry site were used .
the waste gas stream was composed of a mixture of vocs ( 63 % ethanol , 22 % ethyl acetate , 13 % 1 - ethoxy - 2 - propanol ) .
the manufacturing shift of this industrial site was 18 h of emissions per day ( from 6 to 24 h ) during 5 days a week ( working days ) , with several emission sources .
the btf system consisted of a packed reactor with a volume of 49 m3 filled with polypropylene rings ( flexiring 50 mm : a = 102 m2.m - 3 ; thetapm = 0.93 ) , plus a recirculation tank with a maximum water capacity of 15 m3 .
the bioreactor was operated in counter - current mode ; air from the factory was blown into the bottom of the column continuously ( polluted air for 18 h per day and clean air for 6 h per day ) .
the btf began operating in june 2009 .
two sets of data ( from monday to thursday ) with different spraying frequency ( october 2009 , and january 2011 ) were selected ( table 2 ) .
during weekends , clean air was blown on the btf , and the spraying frequency was kept the same as those applied during non - voc feeding periods in working days in order to promote the removal of the accumulated vocs in the water tank .
volumes of water in the recirculation tank were 6.5 and 12.8 m3 ( 25 % of the volume renewed with fresh water on sundays ) , and the liquid flow rates were 30 and 32 m3.h - 1 for run 4 and run 5 , respectively .
the pressure drop was lower than 15 pa.m - 1 .
the system worked for more than 3 months under each of the selected conditions .
table 2 summarizes the performance of the system during the 4 days of each run .
the volume fraction of the mobile liquid phase in the bioreactor was approached by measuring the quantity of accumulated water in the bioreactor during spraying ; a value of 0.05 was obtained ( thetal ) .

analytical methods in the laboratory experiments , the gas concentration of isopropanol was measured using a total hydrocarbon analyzer ( nira mercury 901 , spirax sarco , spain ) .
the response factor of the total hydrocarbon analyzer was determined by gas chromatography ( model 7890 , agilent technologies , usa ) .
the determination of the total organic carbon ( toc ) in water was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer ( toc - vchs , shimadzu corporation , japan ) .
at the industrial scale , the inlet and outlet gas voc concentrations were continuously monitored using a total hydrocarbon analyzer ( rs 53 - t , ratfisch analysensysteme gmbh , germany ) .
the air flowed during the whole day , and the air flow rate was monitored continuously by using a pitot tube ( 19 '' pitot tube , testo ag , germany ) .
2.4 .
model development the model was based on the fact that btfs are usually operated in intermittent spraying mode .
the intermittent spraying regime implies two different behaviors of the system .
thus , a mobile liquid phase and a stagnant liquid phase were considered during the spraying period and non - spraying period , respectively .
thus , a three - phase model ( gas - liquid - biofilm ) is proposed here based on the mass balances of the gas and liquid phases and the biofilm .
two different systems of partial differential equations were used , depending on whether the spraying or the non - spraying period was simulated .
the conceptual scheme of the btf and the model derivation are shown in figure 1 .
for model development , the following assumptions were made : ( 1 ) the gas phase flows in a plug flow regime along the filter bed .
( 2 ) axial dispersion is neglected .
( 3 ) the adsorption of pollutant in the packing material is negligible .
( 4 ) the active biofilm is formed on the external surface of the packing material , and no reaction occurs in the pores .
the biofilm covers the surface of the packing material , and its thickness ( delta ) is much smaller than the size of the solid particles , so a planar geometry is assumed .
( 5 ) the packing material is completely covered by the biofilm .
( 6 ) the biodegradation kinetics are described by a monod expression , indicating the oxygen limitation .
( 7 ) the diffusion inside of the biofilm is described by fick 's second law .
( 8 ) a mobile liquid phase is assumed during the spraying period , and a stagnant liquid phase is considered during the non - spraying period .
( 9 ) the gas - liquid interface is in equilibrium according to henry 's law .
( 10 ) the mass flux at the gas - liquid and the liquid - biofilm interfaces can be expressed by mass transfer coefficients .
( 11 ) the presence of biomass in the bioreactor increases resistance to the mass transfer between the gas and the liquid phase .
thus , the overall mass transfer coefficients experimentally determined in abiotic conditions are corrected by a factor ( alpha1 ) varying between 0 and 1 .
( 12 ) there is no reaction in the liquid phase .
according to the assumptions made above , the mass balances during both periods are described in the next subsection .

bold lines indicate the boundary conditions. eq. means equation .
2.4.1 .
mass balances during the spraying period during the spraying period , the pollutant and the oxygen are transferred from the gas phase to the mobile liquid phase and then to the biofilm , where the biodegradation takes place .
the mass balance of the gas phase is described according to equation ( 1 ) for a system in counter - current operation : ( 1 ) thetagdcgidt = - vgdcgidz - alpha1klai ( cgihi - cli ) where i denotes the pollutant ( p ) or the oxygen ( o ) .
thus , for component i , cgi and cli are the concentrations of gas and liquid phases , respectively ; klai is the overall mass transfer coefficient ; hi represents the dimensionless henry 's law constants expressed as the concentration of the gas phase / concentration of the liquid phase ; t denotes time ; z is the distance from the bottom of the column ; vg is the superficial air velocity ; and thetag is the porosity of the bed calculated as thetag = thetapm - thetal - thetab .
the boundary condition of equation ( 1 ) is given by : ( 2 ) z = 0 cg = cgiin where cgiin is the inlet concentration of the component i. the mass balance of the mobile liquid phase is given by : ( 3 ) thetaldclidt = vldclidz + alpha1klai ( cgihi - cli ) - diabeta ( cli - si,1 ) where for component i , di is the diffusion coefficient in water ; si,1 is the concentration in the biofilm interface ; vl is the superficial liquid velocity ; and beta is the thickness of the liquid - biofilm interface .
the boundary condition of equation ( 3 ) is given by the mass balance in the recirculation tank : ( 4 ) z = z dclidt = qlvt ( cliz = 0 - cliz = z ) where z is the height of the column ; ql is the liquid flow rate ; and vt is the volume of the recirculation tank .
cli z = 0 and cli z = z are the concentrations of the component i in the liquid phase at the bottom and top of the column , respectively .
the mass balance of the biofilm is given by : ( 5 ) dsidt = f ( xv ) did2sidx2 - mumaxxvyispsp + kpsoso + ko where si is the concentration inside the biofilm of component i ; f ( xv ) is the correction factor of the diffusivities in water due to the biomass calculated by fan 's equation [ 23 ] ; xv is the concentration of the biomass ; mumax is the specific growth rate of the biomass ; kp and ko are the half - saturation constants of the pollutant and oxygen , respectively ; and , for component i , yi is the yield coefficient .
the boundary conditions for the mass balance of the biofilm are given by : ( 6a ) x = delta dsidx = 0 ( 6b ) x = 0 si = cli where delta is the biofilm thickness .
2.4.2 .
mass balances during the non - spraying periods during the period without spraying , the pollutant and the oxygen are transferred from the gas phase to the stagnant liquid phase and then to the biofilm , where biodegradation takes place .
the according mass balances are presented below .
the mass balance of the gas phase is given by equation ( 7 ) : ( 7 ) thetagdcgidt = - vgdcgidz - alpha2alpha1klai ( cgihi - cli ) where alpha2 is a switch parameter that weights the gas - liquid mass transfer resistance .
a value of 100 is assumed to indicate that the gas - liquid mass transfer resistance is negligible .
a value of 1 indicates that a resistance to the gas - liquid mass transfer contributes to reducing the pollutant max flux diffusing to / from the biofilm .
the boundary condition of equation ( 7 ) is given by : ( 8 ) z = 0 cg = cgin the mass balance of the stagnant liquid phase is given by : ( 9 ) thetaldclidt = alpha2alpha1klai ( cgihi - cli ) - diabeta ( cli - si,1 ) the mass balance in the biofilm is given by : ( 10 ) dsidt = f ( xv ) did2sidx2 - mumaxxvyispsp + kpsoso + ko with the boundary conditions : ( 11a ) x = delta dsidx = 0 ( 11b ) x = 0 si = cli 2.4.3 .
numerical solution the partial differential equations given above constitute two second - order nonlinear distributed systems .
in order to solve them , the method of lines ( mol ) was chosen .
for a numerical problem solution , z is divided into n sections with n + 1 equi - spaced node points .
similarly , the biofilm thickness is divided into m sections with m + 1 points , resulting in two ordinary differential equation ( ode ) systems of 2 ( n + 1 )( m + 3 ) equations .
the next step is to discretize the spatial variables .
the parameters of n and m were optimized as 20 and 40 , respectively .
the resulting ode systems were found to be stiff .
therefore , they were integrated using the ode23t function of matlab .
3. results and discussion 3.1 .
model calibration the calibration of the mathematical model presented herein was carried out with the experimental run 1 ( table 1 ) .
figure 2 shows the monitoring of the pollutant concentration in the gas phase ( a.1 ) and the evolution of the dissolved carbon concentration in the water tank ( a.2 ) from monday to friday ( 0 to 120 h ) .
in figure 2 ( a.1 and a.2 ) , time 0 h refers to monday 8:00 am. as an example of the daily patterns , data for wednesday ( 48 to 72 h ) is shown in figure 2 ( b.1 and b.2 ) .
as is shown in figure 2 ( a.1 and b.1 ) , the outlet gas stream exhibited peaks of pollutant emission coinciding with the spraying periods ( six peaks per day ) .
during the periods without spraying , nearly complete removal of the pollutant was obtained .
for every day , a similar dynamic pattern was observed .
during the feeding of air polluted with voc ( 0 - 16 h ) , the pollutant leak associated with the first spraying of each day ( 0 h ) was much lower than the rest of the peaks .
the leak increased during the second spraying ( 4 h ) , reaching a quasi - stable maximum during the third and fourth spraying ( 8 h , 12 h ) .
after cutting off the supply of voc ( at 16 h ) , the immediate peak ( 16 h ) was similar to those obtained previously , but after some hours , the outlet gas emission during spraying was drastically reduced ( 20 h ) .
the evolution of the peaks during the non - voc feeding period indicated that the accumulated substrate in the system was consumed ; the gas - phase leak at 20 h of each day was nearly in equilibrium with the organic liquid concentration in the tank .
the dissolved carbon concentration in the water tank was monitored during spraying at working hours on alternate days ( figure 2 ( a.2 , b.2 )) .
as can be seen , the daily concentration increased with each spraying , indicating that the pollutant is absorbed in water .
the outlet gas emissions of the second to fifth daily peaks were more than three - times higher than the predicted equilibrium concentration with the dissolved carbon concentration in the water .
the variations of the liquid concentration in the recirculation tank between days indicated that the accumulated pollutant in water would be degraded in the btf during spraying in night periods ( 16 - 24 h ) .

the parameters for the calibration of the model are summarized in table 3 .

during non - spraying , the mass transfer resistance between the gas and stagnant liquid was considered negligible ( alpha2 = 100 ) , and during spraying , the gas - liquid mass transfer resistance was assumed to be equal to that determined under abiotic conditions ( alpha1 = 1 ) .
the value proposed for micromax , herein , 2 x 10 - 5 s - 1 , appears to be in agreement with the values obtained in the literature for the treatment of isopropanol .
bustard et al .
[ 28 ] compiled data from different models proposed by different authors , with values ranging between 1.77 x 10 - 5 s - 1 and 2.58 x 10 - 5 s - 1 .
the relative error deviation between experimental elimination capacity ( ec ) ( 29.8 g - c m - 3 h - 1 ) and simulated ec ( 31.8 g - c m - 3 h - 1 ) for run 1 was 6.7 % , indicating the feasibility of the model to reproduce the overall removal , although the dynamic pattern deviated from the experimental one .
as an example , figure 3 shows the results for wednesday ( 48 to 72 h ) .
the model predicts the existence of pollutant peaks associated with the mass transfer resistance of the gas - liquid film .
the model predicts the sharp decrease of the gas - phase outlet concentration after spraying stops , corroborating that mass transfer resistance during non - spraying was negligible .
the coupling of the spraying and non - spraying set of equations also predicts the periodical decrease of the dissolved carbon concentration in the water tank when the btf works using clean air ( from 64 to 72 h in figure 3 ) .
this behavior is associated with the voc desorption from the liquid to the gas phase and its biodegradation in the biofilm .
however , the model underestimates the concentration of the outlet emissions in the case of the second to fifth peaks .
in a second stage , the gas - liquid mass transfer flux was reduced by applying a correction factor in order to predict the maximum peak ( alpha1 = 0.23 ) .
as can be seen in figure 3 , this increase in the resistance to mass transfer overestimates the first two peaks after voc feeding resumption after 8 h running with clean air .
experimental data indicated that the supply of vocs , followed by long non - supply voc periods ( 8 h per day ) , caused a cyclical variation in the resistance to mass transfer between the gas phase and liquid phase over time .
this variation could be associated with a transient evolution in the physical properties due to biological reactions .
for example , the accumulation of water and extracellular polymeric substances ( eps ) could act as a periodical transfer barrier , deteriorating the removal efficiency of the system .
when clean air was supplied , the accumulated voc in the system could be biodegraded , and part of the formed eps could disappear from the system , linked to the consumption by the microorganisms .
in this regard , zhang and bishop [ 29 ] suggested that eps could be used as a substrate and concluded that eps was biodegradable by its own producers , as well as by other microorganisms , during periods without feeding of voc .

( a ) outlet concentration of voc in the gas phase .
( b ) concentration of the dissolved carbon in the water tank .
the calibration of the model ends by fitting the daily variation of the correction factor of gas - liquid mass transfer resistance over time .
the same daily variation was assumed for the five days of run 1 .
the results of the model calibration are shown in figure 4 ( five days of run 1 ) .
figure 4 ( b.1 and b.2 ) zoom in on the plot of the wednesday data ( 48 to 72 h ) , and values of alpha1 are labelled. by using the proposed approach herein , the relative error ( for the whole of run 1 ) between experimental ec ( 29.8 g - c.m - 3.h - 1 ) and simulated ec ( 30.5 g - c.m - 3.h - 1 ) was improved by 2.3 % .
the model is able to better predict the dynamic variations in the outlet gas - phase emissions and in the dissolved carbon concentration in the recirculation tank than in previous calibration steps .

model validation the mathematical model was validated by using two sets of independent experiments at the laboratory scale ( run 2 and run 3 , table 1 ) to check the capability of the model to predict the evolution of the system over five days and three days , respectively .
experimental data along with the results of the model simulations are shown in figure 5 .
the model is capable of reproducing the cyclical performance by using a different spraying duration ( run 2 ) or inlet load ( run 3 ) .
the relative error between experimental ec and simulated ec was 3.7 % and 2.4 % for run 2 and run 3 , respectively .
in both cases , the model shows a daily evolution of the outlet gas - phase concentrations : the gradual increase of the peaks when the air polluted with voc is supplied to the btf and its decrease when clean air is supplied ; the model successfully predicts the available experimental data regarding outlet voc emissions .
the model also simulates the variations of the dissolved carbon in the water tank : the accumulation of dissolved carbon when the btf is fed with voc - polluted air and its decrease when clean air is used , showing good agreement with the available experimental toc concentrations .
for example , the model predicts the increase of the experimental organic carbon concentration from 55 ( after purging the tank at 52 h ) to ~ 400 mg - c.l - 1 after the third daily spraying during run 3 .
in spite of increasing the driving force , the intermediate purge had a negligible impact on the outlet voc emissions ( a similar experimental peak was obtained at the third daily spraying of days 2 and 3 ) .
this corroborates that the gas - phase emission during spraying could be associated with the high resistance of the gas - liquid mass transfer .

model simulations to assess the impact of the calibration parameters , micromax , beta and ks , on the voc outlet concentration and on the concentration of the dissolved carbon in the water tank , model simulations were carried out modifying by +/ - 50 % each parameter individually from the value listed in table 3 .
the rest of the model parameters are listed in table 3 .
figure 6 shows the application of this study to run 1 ( wednesday data , 48 to 72 h ) .
when micromax was increased to 50 % , the model predicted lower values in the maximum concentration of the gas phase during the spraying periods ( 161 mg - c.m - 3 ) .
the predicted concentrations of the dissolved carbon in the water tank were lower ( 178 mg - c.l - 1 ) than those obtained with the optimal value ( 224 mg - c.l - 1 ) of micromax , while during the periods fed with clean air , the dissolved carbon concentration decreased faster ( 24 mg - c.l - 1 ) than that obtained with the calibrated value ( 58 mg - c.l - 1 ) .
in contrast , when the micromax was decreased by 50 % , higher peaks were obtained during spraying periods ( max peak 187 mg - c.m - 3 ) .
it is important to note that the decreasing of the outlet concentration after a spraying was slower than the experimental decrease , indicating that the process was controlled by the kinetics .
the dissolved carbon concentration was higher ( 320 mg - c.l - 1 ) than that obtained with the optimal value of micromax .
when beta was increased up to 50 % , greater concentrations in the gas and in the liquid phase were obtained ( max values 182 mg - c.m - 3 and 281 mg - c.l - 1 , respectively ) ; while beta was decreased by 50 % , lower peaks in the outlet gas phase and a lower concentration in the water tank were achieved ( max values 153 mg - c.m - 3 and 140 mg - c.l - 1 , respectively ) .
the parameter beta is related to the transfer of pollutant and oxygen between liquid and biofilm , and this analysis shows that this parameter is one of the most sensitive in the modelling of the treatment of isopropanol by btf .
when ks was modified +/ - 50 % , the model appeared less sensitive to modifications of this parameter , obtaining a neglecting effect in the gas phase and less impact in the concentration of the dissolved carbon in the water tank than with the other parameters .

experimental data correspond to the wednesday data ( 48 to 72 h ) of run 1 .
3.4 .
model application to industrial unit processes the model proposed herein was applied by using experimental data from two different periods from an industrial btf located at a flexographic industry site ( run 4 and run 5 ) .
experimental data from both runs have a two - year spacing .
table 4 shows the voc composition of the industrial emission and the diffusion coefficient in water and henry 's law constant for each compound that composed the voc emission .
figure 7 shows the experimental data and the model simulations for both runs .
in this figure , time 0 h refers to monday 00:00 am. in contrast to those obtained in the laboratory experiments , the gaseous outlet emissions showed a buffered pattern , and no peaks associated with spraying or with instantaneous variations of the flow rate or inlet emissions were observed .
during voc inlet emissions coming from the factory ( from 6:00 am to 12:00 pm ) , the outlet gas concentrations of the btf were not clearly related to the spraying pattern ; a continuous gradual increase of them was observed every day .
during night periods ( from 00:00 to 6:00 am ) , a slow decrease in the outlet emissions was observed ; the voc accumulated in the biofilm during periods receiving inlet emissions was not totally stripped or degraded over 6 hours , while when the bioreactor was operated with clear air for more than 24 h ( weekends ) , the outlet gas concentration became negligible ( data between 0 and 6 h in figure 7 ) .
the industrial btf was acting as an absorption - desorption system during voc feeding - non - voc feeding cycles .
this seems to indicate that there is a difference in the rate - limiting steps between the treatment of hydrophilic voc by biotrickling filtration at the industrial scale and for laboratory units .
this finding was one of the challenges of this work .
based on these two observations ( no peaks during spraying and continuous outlet emissions during non - voc feeding periods ) , it was assumed that : ( 1 ) there was an extra mass transfer resistance between the gas and liquid phases during non - spraying periods not observed in the laboratory experiments ; and ( 2 ) a thick biofilm was developed .

as the industrial btf worked under conditions of variable gas velocities , the overall mass transfer coefficient for the pollutant was estimated for each simulated time point , applying the correlation proposed by san - valero et al .
[ 24 ] , using the gas velocity and the weighted average value of henry 's law constant of the voc mixture ( equation ( 12 )) .
this weighted average henry 's law constant was calculated using the percentage composition of each compound and its henry 's law constant ( table 4 ) .
( 12 ) klap = hp3600 ( 11.59 ( vg3600 ) 0.85 ) the overall mass transfer of oxygen was experimentally determined in the laboratory , obtaining a value of 0.0066 s - 1 for this packing material .
the biofilm thickness ( delta ) was fitted to 500 microm in order to reproduce the slow desorption occurring during periods without supplying vocs ( every day from 0 am to 6 am ) .
during spraying , it was assumed that there is similar mass transfer resistance to that in the laboratory systems ( alpha1 = 0.23 ) .
the emergence of the extra mass transfer resistance during non - spraying was related to the creation of a stagnant liquid phase .
the switch parameter alpha2 was set to one to consider the resistance to mass transfer within the gas - liquid interface during non - spraying periods .
simulation of both runs started with clean water ( voc accumulated in the water tank during working days was removed at the weekend ) .
in the case of run 5 , the recirculation tank on wednesday at 4 pm ( 64 h of run 5 in figure 7 ) was renewed with fresh water ; this was included in the simulation .
figure 7 experimental data and model results of the industrial btf installed in a flexographic industry site : ( a ) run 4 ( b ) run 5 .
as can be seen in figure 7 , the correspondence between the calculated and the experimental voc emissions is quite good .
relative errors between simulated and experimental data were 1.6 % and 2.2 % for run 4 and run 5 , respectively .
during the course of the biological process , vocs were degraded , but a part of the load is cyclically absorbed - desorbed following the daily cycles of voc feeding - non voc feeding .
the thick biofilm works as the sink ( every day from 6 am to 12 pm ) and source ( every day from 0 am to 6 am ) of the pollutant .
the dynamic mathematical model approaches these phenomena through the existence of two resistances in series ( gas - liquid , liquid - biofilm ) that keep constant by operating the btf with or without irrigation .
this work appears as one of the first attempts to go more deeply into the modelling of the dynamic response associated with intermittent conditions ( irrigation and inlet emissions ) , focusing on the observed differences between laboratory and industrial btfs .
in future work , the results of the model could be integrated into a software tool for the design and control of industrial btfs .
4. conclusions a dynamic general model to simulate the removal of isopropanol emissions by biotrickling filtration has been developed .
the model was built as a coupled set of equations for spraying and non - spraying periods in order to represent the intermittent irrigation usually performed in industrial applications .
the model has been evaluated by using laboratory experiments working under intermittent spraying and intermittent voc feeding to the bioreactor .
the model predicts not only the overall performance , but also the outlet emission peaks occurring during spraying and the sharp decrease of gas - phase outlet concentration after spraying stops , indicating that mass transfer resistance during non - spraying was negligible .
practical applications of this model to predict the outlet voc emissions in industrial btf treating a mixture of pollutants were demonstrated .
in this case , the thick biofilm and the mass transfer resistance between gas and stagnant liquid during non - spraying were the two main different characteristics from the model application to laboratory data .

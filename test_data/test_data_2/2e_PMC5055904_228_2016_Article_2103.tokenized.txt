purpose until recently , surgery was the only remaining choice for moderate to severe chronic ulcerative colitis patients who failed standard treatment or when it was not tolerated .
anti - tnfalpha treatment is a new , non - invasive option for the management of ulcerative colitis .
the objective of this study was to assess the cost - effectiveness of induction and maintenance treatment up to 1 year of ulcerative colitis with adalimumab / standard care and standard care alone in poland .
methods a markov model was used to estimate the expected costs and effects of adalimumab / standard care and a standard care alone .
for each treatment option , the costs and quality adjusted life years were calculated to estimate the incremental cost - utility ratio .
the analysis was performed from the perspective of the polish public payer and society over a 30 - year time horizon .
different direct and indirect costs and utility values were assigned to the various model health states .
results the treatment of ulcerative colitis patients with adalimumab / standard care up to 1 year instead of a standard care alone resulted in 0.14 additional years of life with full health ( qalys ) .
the incremental cost - utility ratio of adalimumab / standard care compared to the standard care alone is estimated to be 76,120 euro / qaly gained from nhf perspective and 71,457 euro / qaly gained from social perspective .
conclusions the biologic treatment of ulcerative colitis patients with adalimumab / standard care is more effective but also more costly compared with standard care alone .

keywords ulcerative colitis cost - utility adalimumab economic analysis indirect costs issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer - verlag berlin heidelberg 2016 introduction ulcerative colitis ( uc ) is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel disorder characterized by an inflammatory reaction involving the colonic mucosa [ 1 , 2 ] .
the clinical course is unpredictable and marked by alternating periods of exacerbation and remission , which may occur spontaneously or in response to treatment changes or intercurrent illnesses [ 3 , 4 ] .
although progress has been made in the overall management of the disease , no medical cure has been discovered [ 5 ] .
the introduction of anti - tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( anti - tnfalpha ) treatment allowed a new option for the management of ulcerative colitis and is expected to decrease the rate of colectomies or at least to extend the time to surgery , compared with standard treatment .
adalimumab / standard care superior efficacy compared to standard care alone in moderate to severe non - acute uc has been well established by the clinical trials [ 6 , 7 ] .
on the other hand , the use of biologics constitutes a heavy burden for the public payer , so its usage can be limited in many countries .
in poland , patients with severe uc who are not able to have cyclosporine therapy and do not respond to standard care have the possibility to receive the induction treatment with infliximab , which consists of three administrations of the drug .
at present , there is no biological maintenance treatment of ulcerative colitis reimbursed in poland , hence patients often lose their response or remission , which were achieved during the induction phase .
additionally , the lack of biological maintenance treatment leads to an increased rate of colectomies .
adalimumab , nor any other biologic therapy , is not reimbursed from public funds in uc treatment at all .
in this connection , there was a need for economic evaluation of uc induction and maintenance therapy with a tnfalpha inhibitor at polish settings .
this study uses an economic evaluation to assess the cost - effectiveness of induction and maintenance treatment up to 1 year of ulcerative colitis with adalimumab / standard care and standard care alone in poland .
methods overview a markov model was used to estimate the expected costs and effects of adalimumab / standard care and standard care alone used in the induction and maintenance treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis ( model structure , inputs , transition probabilities , costs of health states , and utilities are presented in fig. 1 , tables 1 and 2 ) .
for each treatment option , the costs and quality adjusted life years ( qalys ) were calculated to estimate the incremental cost - utility ratio ( icur ) .
the analysis was taken from the perspective of the polish public payer and also from expanded social perspective ( indirect costs included ) .
ulcerative colitis could be a lifelong disease , which is why the 30 - year time horizon was selected for the base - case analysis .
costs and outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 5 and 3.5 % , respectively .
figure 1 structure of markov model for patients with uc. the cycle length during induction phase is 1 week , from week 9 , it is 8 weeks .
all complications after surgery ( state 10. ) are assumed to be temporary and resolved during the 8 - week period .
it was assumed that the probability of death will be the same for each clinical state .

the average weight and age of a patient was 75.37 kg ( range : 73.60 - 77.14 ) and 39.60 years ( 95 % ci : 38.05 - 41.15 ) , respectively , and the percentage of women was 42.7 % ( 95 % ci : 35.6 - 45.5 %) .
this was based upon baseline data from the reference clinical trial ulcerative colitis long - term remission and maintenance with adalimumab 2 ( ultra 2 ) [ 6 ] .
based on the current practice and reference clinical trial , in the model adalimumab was assumed to be administered in a dose of 160 mg at week 0 , 80 mg at week 2 , and 40 mg every other week beginning at week 4 up to 1 year [ 6 , 7 ] .
model structure the modeling was carried out based on a markov - type cohort simulation process and implemented in microsoft excel 2007 with visual basic for applications tool ( microsoft corporation , redmond , wa ) .
the patient enters this model when starting the induction treatment .
the time horizon is divided into two periods : from week 0 to 8 ( period 1 ; induction treatment ) and the weeks from nine ( period 2 ; maintenance treatment ) .
the cycle length during period 1 is 1 week , and cycles in period 2 last 8 weeks .
after the ninth cycle , the response to induction therapy and remission was assessed and biological treatment was continued only in responders ( patients who responded or experienced remission ) .
mayo score was used to assess the uc activity ( scores can range from 0 to 12 , with higher scores indicating more severe disease activity ) : values from 0 to 2 means remission , 3 - 5 mild disease , 6 - 12 moderate - severe disease [ 6 ] .
the clinical response was defined as a decrease from the baseline in the total mayo score by at least 3 points and at least 30 % , with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1 .
clinical remission was defined as a total mayo score of 2 points or lower , with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point [ 6 ] .
in accordance with polish clinical practice , for standard care , it is assumed that in both the induction and maintenance phases , 100 % of patients have both corticosteroids and aminosalicylates , 80 % have mercaptopurine , and 20 % have azathioprine .
patients who have neither remission nor response to induction treatment with the tnfalpha inhibitor / standard care or standard care alone will stop the treatment , move to an active disease state and start standard care alone or will have a colectomy .
if one of the treatments ( adalimumab / standard care or standard care alone ) led to a clinical response or remission , the patient continued with the treatment in the maintenance phase .
maintenance treatment with adalimumab is restricted to 1 year in base - case analysis and no limitation for biological treatment was assumed in sensitivity analysis ( adalimumab administered until loss of response or death , according to what occurs first ) .
patients who experienced the response or remission can sustain or lose it during the next cycle .
the treatment can be discontinued when unacceptable adverse events occur ; in this case , the patient moves to a standard care alone state .
patients who failed adalimumab / standard care or standard care alone treatment continued standard care in the maintenance phase , but they could have a colectomy if their disease remained active .
patients can experience remission or response during standard care , the same as during standard care alone treatment .
standard care is continued regardless of whether the patient has remission , response , or is in an active disease state .
all patients who had a colectomy can experience temporary complications and finally achieve clinical remission after surgery ( see : fig. 1. ) .
it was assumed that all complications occur immediately after surgery ( in the same cycle ) and are resolved during the 8 - week period .
certain adverse events were not included in the model .
in accordance with reference clinical trial [ 6 ] , adalimumab treatment was generally well tolerated and the overall safety profile of adalimumab was comparable with that of placebo .
a similar proportion of patients in each study group experienced treatment emergent adverse events , which were nonserious , mild , or moderate in severity , and were considered not related or probably not related to study drug [ 6 ] .
there is no evidence that patients with uc have lower life expectancy ; thus , the probability of death was calculated on a basis of life expectancy table for general polish population ( www.stat.gov.pl ) .
it was assumed that the probability of death will be the same for each clinical state .
no data was found on the different probability of death from particular clinical states of model for natural course of the disease .
clinical inputs transition probabilities in the model were calculated based on the response , remission rates , and discontinuation due to adverse event rates which came from randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial .
the ultra 2 study evaluated the efficacy of adalimumab in induction and maintenance of clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who received concurrent treatment with oral corticosteroids or immunosuppressants [ 6 ] .
as the definitions of remission and response were overlapping in ultra 2 study [ 6 ] , responders from this analysis excluded those who achieved remission .
the above provides the separation of these two states in a model .
in ultra 2 study , the effectiveness was assessed at week 8 ( after induction treatment ) , at week 32 , and at week 52 ( maintenance treatment ; data available only for week 8 and week 52 [ 6 ]) .
transition probabilities for adalimumab / standard care after discontinuation of the biological treatment were assumed to be the same as for the standard care alone arm .
clinical parameters and utility values used in the model are presented in table 1 .
a proportion of non - responders to medical treatment underwent surgery .
to derive the probability of colectomy , we used the data from the study by feagan et al .
[ 12 ] estimating that during the 52 - week period , 3.68 % ( 15 per 408.1 patient - years ) and 4.75 % ( 11 per 231.7 patient - years ) of patients treated with adalimumab / standard care and standard care alone have a colectomy , respectively .
using the above data as our basis , we calculated the probability of a colectomy in 1 cycle ( table 1 ) .
patients undergoing surgery either achieved post - surgery remission and maintained it through the whole time horizon or suffered from immediate post - surgery complications , which were assumed to occur during the same cycle as surgery and resolved in 8 - week period .
the probability of surgery complications was calculated based on the study by arai et al .
[ 9 ] and fazio et al .
[ 8 ] ( table 1 ) .
after resolving the complications within the 8 - week period , it was assumed that patients achieve post - surgical remission , just as patients who did not experience any complications .
costs costs were considered from a national health system ( national health fund , nhf ) perspective and from social perspective , and therefore , direct medical and indirect costs were included .
the costs were presented in 2015 polish zloty ( pln ) , and the results were presented in euros ( euro ; euro1 = 4.2 pln ) .
direct medical costs considered in the model included those related to initiation and maintenance treatment with adalimumab ( drug and administration costs ) , standard care , monitoring and hospitalization costs , surgery costs , and treatment of complications after surgery costs .
the costs of drugs used in the study population are based on the actual unit prices of reimbursement medical products .
table 2 presents all drugs' unit costs .
the dosage of drugs used in standard care , as well as monitoring costs was determined by expert opinion .
indirect costs come from study carried out in poland on 202 patients with uc ( unpublished ) .
they include absenteeism , presenteeism , and costs of leaving earlier the labor market , separately for remitted patients and those with active disease .
indirect costs generated by patients in remission were assigned to responders ( patients with respond or remission ) , and indirect costs generated by patients with active disease were assigned to the rest .
utilities and quality of life a systematic review was made to identify the utility values for different health states in the model .
after analysis of the available data , we chose the values presented by woehl et al .
[ 10 ] because this study is the most useful for source utility values of different stages included in the model ; it reported eq - 5d utility values and was carried out on 18,573 patients from the uk ( table 1 ) .
the utility values were reported for following states : remitting disease , mild disease , and moderate to severe disease .
these categories of disease severity were based on the simple colitis activity index .
we assumed that the utility value for moderate to severe disease that responded to treatment was equal to the value for mildly active disease by woehl et al .
[ 10 ] .
in patients during the treatment or who are in an active disease state or had complications after surgery , the utility value was assumed to be as in active moderate to severe disease .
we assumed that in the post - surgery remission state , the utility value would be lower than that in the remission after the treatment state , which reflects the effect of chronic complications after a colectomy on the patient 's quality of life .
all utility values are presented in table 1 .
an alternative set of utility values was used in the sensitivity analyses , based on the study by arseneau et al .
[ 11 ] .
there was no change in the sensitivity analyses in utility value for remission after surgery state ; to all other states , different utility values were assigned and are presented in table 1 .
economic analysis the primary outcome of this simulation study was the icur of the treatment with adalimumab / standard care and the standard care alone , expressed as an incremental cost per qaly saved .
the icur was calculated by dividing the difference in total costs ( from the public payer 's and social perspective ) by the difference in effectiveness in qalys between adalimumab / standard care and standard care alone .
sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of our findings were conducted .
variability of cost - effectiveness results according to the change of key variables was assessed using one - way sensitivity analysis .
values used in sensitivity analysis for clinical , cost , and utility parameters are presented in table 1 and 2 .
parameter uncertainty was evaluated using probabilistic sensitivity analysis ( psa ) .
results base - case analysis the results of the base - case analysis are presented in table 3 .
the treatment of uc patients with adalimumab / standard care instead of the standard care alone resulted in 0.140 additional years of life in full health .

the incremental cost per qaly gained was euro76,120 from nhf perspective and euro71,457 from social perspective ( table 3. ) .
sensitivity analysis results of various one - way sensitivity analyses are presented in supplementary materials .
the range of icur values obtained during the one - way sensitivity analysis was from 38,924 euro / qalyg to 265,081 euro / qalyg from nhf perspective and from 34,244 euro / qalyg to 260,504 euro / qalyg from social perspective .
biological treatment with no time restriction ( until disease progression , i.e. lose of response , or death ) resulted in icur value equals 97,672 euro / qalyg from nhf perspective and 92,448 euro / qalyg from social perspective .
the difference in qaly between adalimumab / standard care and standard care alone was 0,480 with assumption of no time limitation of biological treatment .
the results of the psa , testing the whole range of all the uncertain parameters , are presented as a cost - effectiveness acceptability curve ( fig. 2 ) .
the mean icur and the 95 % confidence interval for adalimumab / standard care when compared to the standard care alone was 73,909 euro / qalyg , 95 % ci : 56,745 - 107,058 from the public payer 's perspective and 69,270 euro / qalyg , 95 % ci : 52,132 - 102,190 from social perspective .
the results of the psa suggest adalimumab / standard care to be cost - effective with a wtp equals about euro73,800. fig. 2 cost - effectiveness acceptability curve showing the probability that adalimumab with standard care is cost - effective vs. standard care alone at a range of different threshold values discussion using a 30 - year time horizon and the restriction for the duration of tnfalpha inhibitor therapy to 1 year , adalimumab / standard care treatment turned out to be more effective and more costly option compared with the standard care alone in poland .
one year biologic treatment provided an icur value of 71,457 - 76,120 euro / qalyg , depending on the perspective .
biologic treatment came to be more effective but less cost - effective for the public payer and society when there is no restriction for treatment duration .
the present economic model is the first study which assesses the biological maintenance treatment of uc in poland and is the first study which included indirect costs of the disease .
we used the data from randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of biological treatment , as there is no data concerned polish patients .
such a model can offer support to the decision makers as long as it reflects real - world conditions .
even though the present study evaluated the cost - effectiveness of adalimumab in the polish setting , the results could be adopted by the healthcare system in other countries .
to use this economic evaluation in other country , it should be checked : ( 1 ) if the patients' characteristics are similar , ( 2 ) if the comparator corresponds to the clinical practice in this country , and ( 3 ) if the treatment pattern is similar [ 13 ] .
additionally , the country - specific costs of drug and medical procedures should be included .
in our analysis , we did not include mortality due to uc because there is an evidence which indicates that patients with uc have normal life expectancy , subsequently , meaning that treatment will not influence the survival .
additionally , mortality was not an outcome in the reference clinical study .
we also did not include treatment - related adverse events , as they have a relatively small impact on the cost and quality of life .
some assumptions had to be made concerning the utility values .
the utility value for mildly active disease was assigned to patients who responded to treatment , while in patients who had complications after surgery , the utility value was assumed to be as that in active moderate to severe disease .
a systematic review by xie carried out in october 2014 was found , concerned the economics of adalimumab for ulcerative colitis [ 14 ] .
author identified three economic analysis for adalimumab in uc. only one of them ( ali et al .
[ 15 ]) compared adalimumab / standard care with standard care alone .
this study is available only in a form of abstract , and limited information about the methodology is provided .
the results were presented only in a form of icur values , which were for adalimumab vs. standard care pound96,733 and pound22,087 over 1 - year and 5 - year horizons ( 2010 values ) , respectively .
it was impossible to compare the results of above study with ours as limited information about the model inputs , assumptions , and structure is provided in the abstract .
we also performed our own review of published economic analysis for study subject .
we found two additional studies for adalimumab / standard care compared with standard care alone in uc. both studies were presented in a form of abstract ; full texts are not available [ 16 , 17 ] .
no results concerning the effectiveness were presented .
the icur values obtained in the above studies for adalimumab / standard care vs. standard care alone were c $ 96,812 over 5 - year horizon ( 2013 values ) [ 16 ] and euro46,815 over 10 - year horizon ( 2013 values ) [ 17 ] .
as in the case of previous study , it is hard to compare our results with the above because only abstracts with limited information about methodology , inputs , and assumptions are available .
all three published economic analyses showed that adalimumab / standard care compared with standard care alone in uc seems to be a cost - effective treatment option .
it is worth to mention that none of the identified studies included indirect costs .

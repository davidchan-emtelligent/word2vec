previous studies showed that mir - 373 had the capacity to induce tumor suppressor gene e - cadherin expression in prostate cancer cells .
however , whether mir - 373 can activate the expression of e - cadherin in human bladder cancer ( bca ) cells and inhibit cells remains to be elucidated .
here , we found that both mir - 373 and e - cadherin were low expressed in bca tissues and cell lines , and significantly correlated with tumor stage , grade , and lymph node metastasis .
in addition , decreased e - cadherin expression or low expression of both mir - 373 and e - cadherin is associated with poor overall survival in patients with bca .
transfection of mir - 373 into bca cells readily activated e - cadherin expression by targeting promoter .
moreover , mir - 373 exhibited robust capacity to inhibit cells proliferation , suppress migration and invasion by enhancing e - cadherin expression , and significantly suppress the growth of xenografts and metastasis in nude mice .
altogether , our findings indicate that mir - 373 may as a tumor suppressor in bca by activating e - cadherin expression .
rna activation mir - 373 bladder cancer proliferation metastasis introduction in the urinary system , bladder cancer ( bca ) is the most common malignant tumor .
there are approximate 60,490 male and 18,540 female newly diagnosed cases and 16,870 deaths both male and female in united states in 2017 [ 1 ] .
furthermore , bca is the primary cause of death among urinary tumors in china [ 2 ] .
although more than 70 % of bca patients are non - muscular invasive cancer based on initial diagnosis , they have a high risk of recurrence and progression after local therapies [ 3 ] .
the newly diagnosed muscle invasive cases are usually managed by radical surgery , radiotherapy and even systemic treatment , but the prognosis is still poor [ 4 , 5 ] .
down - regulation expression of specific tumor suppressor genes was confirmed to largely contribute to bca initiation , proliferation and metastasis , so targeted gene therapy would be an effective strategy for its treatment [ 6 ] .
epithelial cadherin ( e - cadherin ) belongs to cadherin family and locates on 16q23 [ 7 ] .
as an essential tumor suppressor gene , e - cadherin is one of the most important genes in maintaining epithelial cell - cell adhesion and normal tissue structure [ 8 ] .
loss or decrease of e - cadherin could promote epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) and induce cancer cells invasion and migration [ 9 ] .
moreover , e - cadherin plays a key role in tumor progression , survivin expression , tumor size and overall survival in human bca [ 10 ] .
micrornas ( mirnas ) are a cluster of endogenous small non - coding rnas ( ncrnas ) and related to cell proliferation , development and apoptosis [ 11 ] .
rna activation ( rnaa ) is a newly detected mechanism for the positive regulation gene expression at the transcriptional level , in which endogenous mirnas or synthetic ordouble - stranded rnas ( dsrnas ) are complementary to specific promoter sequences of target genes [ 12 , 13 ] .
there is increasing evidences showed that some of the specific tumor suppressor genes activated by rnaa can cause anti - tumor effects in a variety of cancer cells [ 14 - 17 ] .
it was manifested that a putative mir - 373 could induce e - cadherin expression by targeting specific promoter sequences in prostate cancer pc - 3 cells [ 13 ] .
moreover , mir - 373 was demonstrated to be low expressed in a variety of cancers and restoration of it could significantly inhibit tumor progression [ 18 - 21 ] .
in the present study , we examined the role of mir - 373 in bca cells development .
we found that mir - 373 could robustly enhance e - cadherin expression in bca cells by targeting its promoter , and inhibit cells growth and metastasis .
our results indicate that mir - 373 may serve as a new candidate anti - cancer drug for bca management .
results mir - 373 and e - cadherin expressions are reduced in bca tissues and cells and are correlated with bca progression to assess the potential value of mir - 373 and e - cadherin in bca , we detected both mir - 373 and e - cadherin expression in bca cells and clinical tissues .
the expression levels of mir - 373 and e - cadherin were decreased in 3 bca cell lines including ej , 5637 and t24 cells compared with sv - huc - 1 cells ( figure 1a , 1b ) .
then , we evaluated the mir - 373 and e - cadherin expression levels in 40 pairs of bca and the corresponding adjacent normal tissues .
the outcomes showed that mir - 373 and e - cadherin expressions were also significantly lower in tumor tissues than adjacent normal tissues ( figure 1c , 1d ) .
furthermore , we analyzed the relationships between mir - 373 , e - cadherin expression and the clinicopathologic factors of bca , as shown in table 1 , mir - 373 and e - cadherin expressions ( t / n ) were related to tumor stage , grade , and lymph node metastasis ( p < 0.05 ) .
these suggest that mir - 373 and e - cadherin may act as tumor suppressors in bca .
figure 1 combined low expression levels of mir - 373 and e - cadherin were associated with poor overall survival in patients with bca ( a ) e - cadherin and ( b ) mir - 373 expressions were reduced in ej , 5637 and t24 cell lines compared with primary normal human bladder epithelial cells ( sv - huc - 1 ) , (* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 ) .
both ( c ) e - cadherin and ( d ) mir - 373 expressions were reduced in human bca tissues compared with the expressions in adjacent normal tissues .
both ( e ) and ( f ) showed positive correlation between mir - 373 and e - cadherin expression levels in bca and adjacent normal tissues .
statistical analysis was performed using the pearson correlation coefficient analysis , with r and p values as indicated .
( g ) kaplan - meier curves and log - rank test showed that high e - cadherin expression was associated with favorable overall survival when compared with low e - cadherin expression ( p = 0.0083 ) .
( h ) patients with low expression levels of mir - 373 and e - cadherin survived significantly shorter than those with high mir - 373 or e - cadherin expression levels did ( p = 0.0046 ) .

result showed that the expression level of mir - 373 was positively correlated with the level of e - cadherin expression in bca and adjacent normal tissues ( figure 1e ; r = 0.63 , p < 0.0001 and figure 1f ; r = 0.56 , p < 0.0001 ) .
low level of e - cadherin expression or decreased expression level of both mir - 373 and e - cadherin is correlated with poor overall survival ( os ) in patients with bca first , we analyzed the relationship between e - cadherin expression and os of bca patients .
choosing the median - fold change ( t / n ) in e - cadherin expression as the cutoff value , the os of patients with high e - cadherin expression was significantly longer than those of low e - cadherin expression ( figure 1g ; hr = 5.31 , 95 % ci : 2.09 - 27.15 ; p = 0.0083 ) [ 22 ] .
then a multivariate cox analysis was performed to assess whether e - cadherin is an independent prognostic factor for bca .
the report showed that low e - cadherin expression in bca was related to poor prognosis for os ( hr = 3.98 , 95 % ci : 1.21 - 17.02 ; p = 0.021 ) , independent of other cliniclopathologic variables ( table 2 ) , which suggesting that e - cadherin might be served as an independent prognostic factor for bca .
we next analyzed selected patients' subgroups based on the combination of mir - 373 and e - cadherin expression .
based on the median - fold change in mir - 373 and e - cadherin expression , bca patients were divided into two subgroups ( high mir - 373 or e - cadherin group , low mir - 373 and e - cadherin group ) .
according to the levels of mir - 373 and e - cadherin expression , kaplan - meier curves suggested that bca patients with high levels mir - 373 or e - cadherin expression survived longer than those with low levels of mir - 373 and e - cadherin expression did ( figure 1h ; hr = 6.74 , 95 % ci : 2.98 - 42.77 ; p = 0.0046 ) .
similarly , the multivariate cox regression model indicated that low expression level of mir - 373 and e - cadherin in bca was correlated with a poor prognosis for os ( hr = 5.29 , 95 % ci : 2.02 - 33.96 ; p = 0.014 ) , independent of other clinicopathologic factors ( table 2 ) .

the cells transfection ratios were tested by quantitative real - time pcr ( qrt - pcr ) ( figure 2a ) .
the expression of e - cadherin mrna was significantly increased after mir - 373 mimic transfection ( figure 2b ) .
induction of e - cadherin protein expression was further confirmed by western blot ( figure 2d ) .
moreover , we co - transfected sicdh1 ( silencing e - cadherin expression ) and mir - 373 mimic into bca cells and found that e - cadherin expression was dramatically abrogated compared with mir - 373 group ( figure 2c , 2e ) .
figure 2 mir - 373 can effectively activate e - cadherin expression both in ej and 5637 cells ( a ) transfection ratio was tested by qrt - pcr , dscontrol and mir - 373 were significantly increased in mimic group than baseline in ej and 5637 cells .
( b ) induction of e - cadherin mrna expression was detected by qrt - pcr in both ej and 5637 cells .
the results were normalized to gapdh .
** p < 0.01 compared with mock and dscontrol groups .
( d ) induction of e - cadherin protein expression was detected by western blot analysis .
beta - actin levels were also detected and served as an internal control .
( c and e ) expression of e - cadherin mrna and protein was detected by qrt - pcr and western blot respectively .
gapdh and beta - actin served as internal control respectively .
e - cadherin expression was dramatically decreased in co - transfection group compared with the mir - 373 group .
mir - 373 interacts with e - cadherin gene promoter others and we have found that the sequences of mirnas or dsrnas are complementary to target genes specific promoter sequences is one of the possible mechanisms rnaa [ 23 - 25 ] .
to identify whether a putative mir - 373 activating e - cadherin in bca cells by targeting specific site in the promoter , we conducted chip assay by using biotinylated mir - 373 which was transfected into ej and 5637 cells .
the biotin was covalently linked to either the 5 ' - end or the 3 ' - end of mir - 373 and dscontrol antisense .
before they were used in chip assay , we first tested rnaa activity of these biotinylated mir - 373 in ej and 5637 cells .
as shown in figure 3a , linking a biotin group to the 5 ' - end of mir - 373 ( mir - 373 - 5 ' - bio ) abolished activation of e - cadherin , whereas 3 ' - end of mir - 373 ( mir - 373 - 3 ' - bio ) did not affect its activating activity .
figure 3 mir - 373 interacts with e - cadherin promoter ( a ) mir - 373 and dscontrol covalently linked to biotin at the 3 ' - end or at the 5 ' - end of the strand. and linking a biotin group to the 5 ' - end of the strand of mir - 373 abolished activation of e - cadherin , whereas biotin labeling at the 3 ' - end did not significantly affect mir - 373 activity (** p < 0.01 ) .
( b ) schematic illustration of the primers capable of amplifying e - cadherin promoter at different regions .
locations are shown relative to the tss .
( c and d ) the biotin - labeled mir - 373 pulled down promoter proximal dna ( - 728 / - 603 ) more effectively than the dscontrol rna did (** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 ) .
in contrast , there was no difference in the binding of mir - 373 and dscontrol rnas to the dna upstream of the e - cadherin promoter that served as a negative control .
after 72h later , mir - 373 or dscontrol was transfected alone , the specific dna was pulled down through with a well - characterized biotin antibody and then amplified by qrt - pcr with specific primers at different locations ( figure 3b ) .
one set of primers amplifying the e - cadherin promoter from - 1235bp to - 1013bp relative to the transcription start site ( tss ) acted as a negative control .
as shown in figure 3c and 3d , both 3 ' - end and 5 ' - end of the biotin - labelled mir - 373 pulled down promoter proximal dna ( from - 728 to - 603 ) more effectively than the dscontrol did .
on the contrary , there was no significant difference in the binding of mir - 373 and dscontrol rnas to the negative control ( - 1235 to - 1013 ) .
these outcomes suggest that mir - 373 induces gene expression by directly interacting with the e - cadherin promoter .
mir - 373 inhibits bca cells proliferation mainly through activating e - cadherin expression in order to elucidate the inhibitory effect of mir - 373 on bca cells , we enforced mir - 373 expression in ej and 5637 cells via mirna mimics .
both ej and 5637 cells displayed progressive retarded growth compared to dscontrol group from 48h after transfection of mir - 373 mimics measured by mts assay ( figure 4a ). and knockout of e - cadherin evidently weakened the anti - proliferative effect regulated by mir - 373 in both cell lines ( figure 4b ) .
furthermore , we performed the colony formation assay and detected that mir - 373 transfected cells formed colonies significantly fewer and smaller than dscontrol group ( figure 4c ) .
in addition , the colony formation rates of mir - 373 transfected both ej and 5637 cells were significantly lower than dscontrol treatment ( figure 4e ). and the colony formation ability of the bca cells was restored after co - transfection of sicdh1 compared with mir - 373 group ( figure 4d and 4f ) .

while co - treatment with sicdh1 , the amounts of colony were much more compared with mir - 373 groups (** p < 0.01 ) .
to further confirm the changes of cell proliferation induced by mir - 373 , an edu assay was conducted and the outcomes showed over - expression of mir - 373 suppressed cells proliferation in two bca cell lines ( figure 5a and 5c ) .
while co - treatment with sicdh1 , the cells proliferation ability was restored ( figure 5b and 5c ) .
then , the ej cells were stably transfected mir - 373 or dscontrol , and the transfected ej cells were used to generate the xenograft model in nude mice .
as shown in figure 5d , lenti - mir - 373 significantly inhibited xenograft tumor growth .
besides , the average tumor volume and weight in lenti - mir - 373 group was remarkably decreased and lightened compared with the lenti - dscontrol group at 4 weeks post injection , respectively ( figure 5e and 5f ) .

mir - 373 inhibits downstream genes' expression of e - cadherin we further detected the influences of mir - 373 on the expression of genes associated with cell proliferation and migration in two bca cell lines .
the results showed mir - 373 caused a marked decrease of cyclind1 , c - myc and mmp2 mrna levels in both ej and 5637 cells ( figure 6a and 6b ) .
the protein levels of these genes were further identified by western blotting and the variation trend was highly consistent with the trend of mrna levels ( figure 6d ) .
then , we blocked e - cadherin expression and examined the expression of associated genes .
as shown in figure 6a and 6c , mir - 373 failed to decrease cyclin d1 , c - myc and mmp2 mrna levels after sicdh1 co - transfection .
the protein analysis of immunoblot further proved that ( figure 6e ) .
figure 6 mir - 373 inhibits e - cadherin 's downstream genes cyclin d1 , c - myc and mmp2 expression the expression of e - cadherin , cyclin d1 , c - myc and mmp2 mrnas were detected by reverse transcription pcr ( rt - pcr ) ( a ) and qrt - pcr ( b and c ) .
gapdh served as a loading control .
mir - 373 increased e - cadherin and suppressed cyclind1 , c - myc and mmp2 mrnas expression .
after co - transfected with sicdh1 , mir - 373 failed to up - regulate e - cadherin or down - regulated cyclin d1 , c - myc and mmp2 mrna levels (* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 *** p < 0.001 ) .
( d ) expression of cyclin d1 , c - myc and mmp2 protein were detected by western blot .
beta - actin served as a loading control .
cyclin d1 , c - myc and mmp2 proteins were lower compared with mock and dscontrol group in ej and 5637 cells .
( e ) co - transfected with sicdh1 contributed to the targeted genes significant increase in two cell lines .
mir - 373 suppresses bca cells migration and invasion primarily via activating e - cadherin expression as we all know , e - cadherin could inhibit tumor cells' emt .
hence , we tested the effects of mir - 373 in migration and invasion capacities of bca cells .
wound healing assay indicated that transfection of mir - 373 led to slower wound closing speed than dscontrol group from 12h in tested cells ( figure 7a and 7b ) .
furthermore , compared to individual transfect mir - 373 , sicdh1 co - transfected ej and 5637 cells recovered to close the wound fast within 24 h ( figure 7c and 7d ) .
next , the transwell assay was performed to further evaluate cells migration and invasion capability .
compared with dscontrol , mir - 373 displayed a potent inhibition on migration of the tested cell lines .
likewise , invasion capability of bca cells was tested by matrigel invasion chamber assay .
as speculation , mir - 373 can markedly attenuate ej and 5637 cells' invasion ability compared with dscontrol group .
moreover , depletion of e - cadherin dramatically restored cells invasion and migration compared with mir - 373 transfection alone ( figure 7e and 7f ) .
these results demonstrated that mir - 373 could attenuate the migration and invasion ability of bca cells mainly by inducing e - cadherin expression .
figure 7 mir - 373 suppresses bca cells migration and invasion ej and 5637 cells were transfected with 50 nm of mir - 373 and dscontrol for 72 h .
( a and c ) representative wound healing images were pictured at 0 , 12 and 24 h .

while sicdh1 co - transfected ej and 5637 cells recovered to close the wound faster within 24h compared to mir - 373 treatment alone (* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 ) .
( e ) representative photographs of transwell assay ( x200 ) .
( f ) number of migrated and invaded cells was quantified .
results are plotted as percent (%) relative to dscontrol group .
mir - 373 exerted a potent inhibiting effect on migration and invasion of the both cell lines (* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 ). and depletion of e - cadherin dramatically restored cells invasion and migration capacity (* p < 0.05 ) .

* p < 0.05 compared to lenti - dscontrol group .
( h ) representative photographs of metastatic nodules in the liver .
number of nodules was quantified .
** p < 0.01 compared to lenti - dscontrol group .
bioluminescence imaging showed that fluorescence signal in lenti - mir - 373 group was remarkably weaker than lenti - dscontrol group , which means that less metastasis was occurred in lung tissue after mir - 373 up - regulation ( figure 7g ) .
otherwise , we also noticed that the number of metastatic nodules in the liver was significantly reduced in lenti - mir - 373 groups compared with lenti - dscontrol group ( figure 7h ) .
discussion in the present study , we found that the mir - 373 activated e - cadherin expression via directly targeting the promoter to study its inhibition on the cell proliferation , invasion and migration in bca .
besides , mir - 373 could also dramatically inhibit the growth of bca xenografts and metastasis in nude mice. and several proliferation related genes ( cyclin d1 and c - myc ) were decreased following mir - 373 transfection .
the metastasis associated gene mmp2 was also decreased after mir - 373 treatment .
most importantly , after co - transfection with sicdh1 , the anti - tumor effects of mir - 373 were markedly weakened , which indicated that mir - 373 inhibited bca cells proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo mainly by activating e - cadherin expression .
as far as know , this is the first study of the role of mir - 373 role in bca .
mir - 373 act as a tumor suppressor role during bca progression by recovering e - cadherin expression which leads to down - regulation of cyclin d1 , c - myc and mmp2 , therefore inhibits cells proliferation , migratory and invasive capacity .
although the clinicopathological role of mir - 373 has not been estimated in bca , down - regulation of mir - 373 has been discovered in several different types of cancers [ 18 - 21 , 26 ] .
however , opposite results are also found for mir - 373 in several cancer types [ 22 , 27 , 28 ] .
our results also indicated that knockout of e - cadherin also induces stronger proliferation ability and higher cell motility in ej and 5637 cells .
briefly , e - cadherin plays an important role in the mir - 373 suppressed emt signaling pathway [ 29 ] .
conversely , e - cadherin deletion in bca specimens have been associated with the tumor recurrence , metastasis and poor survival of bca patients [ 30 - 32 ] .
rnaa is a gene transcriptional activation phenomenon discovered in recent years , which leads to changes in chromatin structure through targeting gene promoter - specific sequences induced by small ncrnas [ 12 , 33 ] .
rnaa requires complementary sequences between dsrna or mirna and its targeted genes , which may be one of the most important possible mechanisms .
huang et al .
[ 23 ] have proved that 3 endogenous mirnas can enrich rna polymerase ii ( rnap ii ) and trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 ( h3k4me3 ) at the transcription start site through direct interaction with the promoter region of ccnb1 .
functionally , mirna activated ccnb1 expression and regulated tumor progression. and we also proved that mir - 1236 , mir - 1180 and mir - 370 could activate the expression of suppressor gene p21 [ 34 - 36 ] .
in the present study , we tested rnaa activity of these biotinylated mir - 373 in ej and 5637 cells , linking a biotin to the 5 ' - end of mir - 373 ( mir - 373 - 5 ' - bio ) abolished activation of e - cadherin , whereas biotin labeling at the 3 ' - end of mir - 373 did not affect mir - 373 's activating activity .
this result is consistent with previous observations [ 19 ] .
mirnas have been reported to play key roles in carcinogenesis and manipulating signal pathways in bca [ 37 ] .
study verified that complementary sequence of specific sits is one of the prerequisites of mirnas suppression or activation [ 37 , 38 ] .
however , even fully complementarity may not always represent bona fide mirnas target region without experimental validation [ 39 ] .
in previous study , we screened out 4 mirnas which highly complementary to p21 promoter sequences [ 40 ] .
however , there are only 3 mirnas were validated to activate p21 expression via targeting the promoter , thereby inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of human bca cells [ 35 , 41 ] .
the mirna with a higher complementary score failed to activate p21 expression , probably because different target sites had different thermodynamic properties , distance from tss and chromatin / dna accessibility [ 42 ] .
li lc have found that the intrinsic conditions of targeted gene promoters ( e.g. , dna methylation ) may impair rnaa regulation [ 12 ] .
the differences in promoter environments of different cell types may affect the number of target genes .
the examples of differential induction of target genes were detected in hct - 116 , lncap and pc - 3 cells , in which csdc2 and e - cadherin were differentially susceptible to gene induction by mir - 373 [ 13 ] .
however , it is unfortunately that the precise mechanism of rnaa remains largely unclear [ 33 , 43 ] .
so far , sifting action ncrnas target sites from target gene promoter is still a hit - or - miss process [ 42 ] .
therefore , further research is required to improve the target forecasting and convenient to gain preferable rnaa .

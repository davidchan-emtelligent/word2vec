how to bring together key sets of health systems stakeholders , including affected communities , health workers , health system managers , health policy - makers and researchers , as well as non - state and non - health sector actors , is a critical challenge .
stakeholder engagement plays important roles across intersecting research , policy and management processes , from selecting and defining the most relevant research questions to address policy and management concerns , to designing and conducting research , learning from and applying evidence , making changes to policy and programmes , and holding each other accountable [ 2 ] .
the articles in this supplement examine some of the tools and approaches used to facilitate stakeholder engagement in implementation research , and describe learning from the experience of the future health systems ( fhs ) research programme consortium .
over the past decade , the fhs consortium , comprised of teams from afghanistan , bangladesh , china , india and uganda , have worked closely with the people and organisations leading the transformation of health systems in each of their own countries .
they have pursued approaches that allow key actors to ' learn by doing ' .
in doing so , they find how implementation research can be usefully employed by providers , beneficiaries , officials and key local actors to improve the delivery of health services , particularly for poor and marginalised populations [ 3 ] .
the articles in this series demonstrate how teams are able to reflect on learning processes that occurred through interactions between researchers and other stakeholders .
they have taken place over many years , allowing the teams to compare experiences across different countries , tools and stakeholder groups , as well as a range of conceptual models .
paina et al .
[ 4 ] outline how teams in bangladesh , india and uganda used theories of change to facilitate iterative interactions with different stakeholders and the design and implementation of interventions .
typically , theories of change are used by project planners or researchers to clarify the design or evaluation logic of a project .
in the cases described , the theories of change and their revision processes provided useful platforms for planning , communication and learning for those implementing the programmes and with intended beneficiaries .
in doing so , the theories of change helped to highlight accountabilities of key actors .
ekirapa - kiracho et al .
[ 5 ] discuss two participatory methods for engaging with stakeholders , namely participatory social network analysis and participatory impact pathways analysis ( pipa ) in india and uganda , and derive lessons about when and how to apply these tools .
they found that , whereas both methods helped to identify stakeholders and provide a deeper understanding of the type of networks and dynamics within the network , pipa had a higher potential for promoting collaboration between the stakeholders , and to help provide an evaluation of the programme from the perspective of the communities affected .
kananura et al .
[ 6 ] further examine how pipa and other active monitoring and evaluation techniques were able to bring together researchers , village health teams and their supervisors at sub - county and district levels in uganda .
they were able to identify critical problems and identify feasible solutions using a number of techniques to share data and reflection .
as teams implemented solutions , they continued to carry on with further problem - solving cycles , gaining confidence in their ability to solve problems .
the uganda team also explored the influence of participatory action research ( par ) on strengthening management capacity in eastern uganda [ 7 ] .
a key characteristic of par is that it enables participants to do their own research as a basis for actions they will take .
in this case , the uganda team is using par to focus on implementation issues in the healthcare system .
their findings indicate that a par approach enhanced health managers' capacity to collaborate with others , be creative , attain goals and review progress .
the enabling factors included the expanded interaction spaces , encouragement of flexibility , empowerment of local managers and the promotion of reflection and accountability .
tension and conflict across different management functions was apparent , particularly to balance collaboration and control over some processes .
these tensions meant that managers needed to learn to simultaneously draw upon and use different competencies , which the authors demonstrate through use of a competing values framework .
this shows how building management capacity is a complex process , and can be enhanced by finding ways to bring different perspectives and stakeholders together , in part to overcome conflicts that emerge .
bennett et al .
[ 8 ] draw upon three studies conducted through fhs in afghanistan , bangladesh and uganda .
all three cases involved complex interactions between the research teams and other stakeholders , among different stakeholders , and between stakeholders and the intervention .
the research planned by the research teams focused primarily on feasibility and effectiveness , however , in practice , the research teams also had critical insights into other factors such as sustainability , acceptability , cost - effectiveness and appropriateness .
in each case , in addition to stakeholder analyses , other project management tools were used to engage stakeholders in addressing implementation issues , which served to help the projects succeed and complement the primary research .
the roundtable discussion provides interesting insights from the perspective of health system policy - makers and managers in three countries [ 9 ] .
all highlight the importance of research to inform decisions , and identify a number of successful ways in which they have worked , as well as some of the remaining challenges .
all three point to the need for continued capacity - building to produce and use research , with the policy - maker from india noting that researchers still have a long way to go in presenting research in ways that enable policy - makers to use the research findings to make informed decisions .
the health systems managers from uganda and afghanistan highlight the gains made by expanding partnerships with community members and researchers .
whereas their experience has raised their own expectations , they also feel that they are now able to use data in their daily work and take on new challenges , and better meet the needs of their communities .
each of the articles embody a collaborative approach to ' learning by doing ' , which is particularly appropriate for addressing implementation issues .
implementation research is providing significant insights into how to enhance the acceptability , fidelity and reach of health interventions , particularly for disadvantaged people .
however , in order to take advantage of the capabilities of stakeholders and be able to address continuously emerging challenges , it seems that considerable flexibility is needed in both how research is conducted , as well as how interventions are implemented based on this research .
in other words , to continue to learn and do. funding this research was funded by the uk department for international development through a grant ( po5467 ) to the future health systems ( fhs ) consortium , which included the costs of publication .

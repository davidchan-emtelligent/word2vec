the savoring beliefs inventory ( sbi ) is a measure designed to assess attitudes toward savoring positive experience within three temporal orientations : the past ( reminiscence ) , the present moment ( present enjoyment ) , and the future ( anticipation ) .
the aim of this study was to validate the structure of the sbi - - french version .
the scale was tested with 335 french - speaking participants .
two models were estimated : a one - factor model representing a general construct of savoring and a three - factor model differentiating between anticipation , present enjoyment , and reminiscence .
several indicators of model fit were used : the root mean square error of approximation ( rmsea ) , the comparison fit index ( cfi ) , the tucker - lewis fit index ( tli ) , and the standardized root mean residual ( srmr ) .
a chi - square difference test was used to compare the two models .
the model fit of the three - factor model assessed by the srmr showed to be excellent , while it could be considered as satisfactory according to the cfi and tli coefficients .
rmsea , however , was slightly less adequate .
the model fit for the one - factor model seemed less adequate than the three - factor solution .
further , the chi - square difference test revealed that the three - factor model had significantly better fit than the one - factor model .
finally , the reliability of the four scores ( anticipating pleasure , present moment pleasure , reminiscing pleasure , and total score ) was very good .
these results show that the french version of the sbi is a valid and valuable scale to measure attitudes regarding the ability to savor positive experience , whether it be in anticipation , reminiscence , or the present moment .
savoring positive affect emotion regulation wellbeing happiness schweizerischer nationalfonds zur forderung der wissenschaftlichen forschung10.13039 / 501100001711105319 _ 163355fonds de la recherche scientifique - fnrs10.13039 / 501100002661 introduction subjective wellbeing does not rely solely on the absence of distress , dysfunctional psychological processes , and mental disorders , nor on the ability to cope with negative experiences ( bryant and veroff , 1984 ; trompetter et al. , 2017 ) .
the experience of positive emotions and , above all , the savoring of these pleasant emotions , have an independent and singular input for subjective wellbeing ( bryant , 1989 ; carl et al. , 2013 ; hurley and kwon , 2013 ) .
savoring characterizes the ability to generate , increase , and prolong enjoyment , with a deliberate attentiveness to and awareness of the pleasure ( bryant , 2003 ; jose et al. , 2012 ) .
facing the same positive event , two individuals will anticipate , enjoy , and reminisce to different extents and , therefore , experience different levels of positive emotions and wellbeing .
thus , it is not only the frequency of pleasant experiences or the ability to feel pleasure that matters to wellbeing but also the capacity to upregulate positive emotions .
the ability to savor positive emotions has as much importance as dampening negative emotions has for subjective wellbeing ( nelis et al. , 2011 ) .
a large number of scales measure dysfunctional attitudes and emotional regulations ( e.g. , garnefski and kraaij , 2006 ; innamorati et al. , 2013 ) .
however , the exclusive use of these scales might not paint a reliable picture of one 's emotional functioning , nor of one 's subjective wellbeing ( nelis et al. , 2011 ) .
a few measurements exist that capture one 's ability to savor .
such scales would shed light on the strengths and limitations of an individual .
such evaluation would , consequently , guide therapy into relying on some emotional competencies and reinforcing or developing the weaker savoring abilities .
scales evaluating the ability to savor would also enable the evaluation of the effects of psychotherapy and any approach that intends to foster wellbeing , for example , interventions targeting emotional regulation and anhedonia ( meyer et al. , 2012 ; favrod et al. , 2015 ) .
to date , scales measuring positive emotion regulation in depth are limited to a few , including the responses to positive affect scale ( rpa ) ( feldman et al. , 2008 ) , the emotion regulation profile - revised ( erp - r ) scale ( nelis et al. , 2011 ) , and the savoring beliefs inventory ( sbi ) ( bryant , 2003 ) .
the rpa focuses on the tendency to dampen positive emotions and to ruminate positively .
positive rumination consists of recurrently thinking of positive emotions or events ( e.g. , successes ) .
the erp - r measures several strategies related to emotion down - regulation and upregulation and includes both maladaptive and adaptive strategies .
the adaptive positive emotion upregulation strategies include displaying positive emotions , mindfully savoring the present moment , capitalizing ( i.e. , celebrating and communicating about positive events ) , and positive mental time traveling ( i.e. , reminiscing or anticipating positive events ) .
other scales include only a few items that focus on positive emotion upregulation , such as the emotion regulation questionnaire ( gross and john , 2003 ) .
the sbi was created to evaluate individuals' attitudes regarding savoring positive experiences .
its strength is its focus on positive upregulation of emotions and its inclusion of the three temporal orientations : the past ( reminiscence ) , the present moment ( present enjoyment ) , and the future ( anticipation ) ( bryant , 2003 ) .
the sbi is composed of 24 items , each temporal orientation being represented by 8 items .
half of the items are positively formulated ( e.g. , " i find it easy to enjoy myself when i want to ") , while the other half is negatively framed ( e.g. , " i do n't like to look forward too much ") .
thus , the scale measures , on the one hand , the propensity to savor pleasure and the beliefs in the capacity of savoring , and on the other hand , the negative attitudes concerning savoring and the difficulties one might have regarding the ability to savor .
the sbi has been validated in english - speaking populations ( college students and elderly people ) and shows good psychometric properties , as seen in the six studies conducted by bryant ( 2003 ) .
indeed , the total score of the sbi showed very good internal consistency ( cronbach 's alpha between 0.88 and 0.94 ) , and the subscales demonstrated moderate to high internal consistency ( cronbach 's alpha between 0.68 and 0.89 ) .
three - week test - retest correlations indicated strong temporal reliability ( sbi total score , r = 0.84 ; anticipating subscale , r = 0.80 ; present moment subscale , r = 0.88 ; and reminiscing subscale , r = 0.85 , all p < 0.0001 ) .
the sbi total score correlated positively with various variables indicating good convergent validity , i.e. , affect intensity ( study 3 , r = 0.48 ) , optimism ( study 4 , r = 0.50 ) , extraversion ( study 4 , r = 0.42 ) , happiness intensity ( study 3 , r = 0.45 ; study 6 , r = 0.56 ) , percent of time happy ( study 3 , r = 0.55 ; study 6 , r = 0.61 ) , gratification ( study 1 , r = 0.39 ; study 2 , r = 0.37 ) , and self - esteem ( study 1 , r = 0.39 ; all p < 0.05 , bonferroni - adjusted ) .
good discriminant validity was evidenced by negative correlations between the sbi total score and hopelessness ( study 4 , r = - 0.41 ) , neuroticism ( study 2 , - 0.38 ) , physical anhedonia ( study 4 , r = - 0.56 ) , social anhedonia ( study 4 , r = - 0.57 ) , strain ( study 2 , r = - 0.33 ) , and percent of time unhappy ( study 3 , r = - 0.35 ; study 6 , r = - 0.57 ; all p < 0.05 , bonferroni - adjusted ) .
regarding gender differences , numerous studies have provided evidence that women experience joy and naturally savor pleasure to a greater extent than men do ( e.g. , diener et al. , 1999 ; gentzler et al. , 2016 ; but for a more complex review of the question , please refer to zuckerman et al. , 2017 ) .
bryant found that women scored higher than did men on the sbi total scale [ f ( 1.445 ) = 11.21 , p < 0.001 ] , the anticipating subscale [ f ( 1.445 ) = 9.18 , p < 0.003 ] , the present moment subscale [ f ( 1.445 ) = 4.97 , p < 0.03 ] , and the reminiscing subscale [ f ( 1.445 ) = 10.96 , p < 0.001 ] ( bryant , 2003 ) .
to date , there has not been any translation of the sbi into other languages .
the goal of this study was to validate the french translation of the sbi and to determine which factor structure is more appropriate for the scale .
materials and methods participants participants were 335 volunteers who were enrolled in the la source school of nursing sciences in lausanne as pre - graduate students or as professionals in continuous education courses ( 19.09 % male and 80.91 % female ) .
the mean age was 28.09 years ( sd = 9.72 ) .
participants responded voluntarily and anonymously , there was no way they could be identified , and no personal data concerning their health were collected .
they did not receive credit to participate .
this study is outside the scope of the swiss human research act because no personal data concerning human diseases and concerning the structure and function of the human body ( hra art. 2 ) were collected .
therefore , this study did not need to be authorized by an ethics committee .
instrument the sbi is a self - assessment questionnaire composed of 24 items , divided into three temporal orientations , past , present , and future , each represented by 8 items .
half of the items are positively formulated , while the other half are negatively framed .
each item is rated on a 7 - point likert scale ranging from " strongly disagree " to " strongly agree. " the total score of the sbi is calculated by subtracting the sum score of the negatively framed items from the sum score of positively phrased items .
the three subscales - - anticipating pleasure , present moment pleasure , and reminiscing pleasure - - are calculated in the same fashion .
the anticipating pleasure subscale measures savoring a future positive event beforehand , the present moment pleasure subscale measures enjoying positive events when they occur and the reminiscing pleasure subscale measures recalling past positive events after they have occurred .
the original english version of the sbi was independently translated by three native french - speaking members of our workgroup , jf , cf and an , and compared until full agreement was found .
the translation was authorized by the author of the original version .
statistical analyses all reverse - scored items were re - coded before data - analysis .
for the confirmatory factor analysis ( cfa ) , item data were treated as categorical ordinal , and the models were estimated using a robust weighted least squares estimator with adjustments for the mean and variance ( wlsmv ) .
the hypothesized three - factor scoring structure was first tested ( bryant , 2003 ) .
it included an anticipating pleasure factor ( items 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 , 16 , 19 , and 22 ) , a present moment pleasure factor ( items 2 , 5 , 8 , 11 , 14 , 17 , 20 , and 23 ) , and a reminiscing pleasure factor ( items 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , and 24 ) .
because a total score was also considered in the original scale , this model was compared to a more parsimonious structure including one general savoring factor .
several indicators of model fit were used , such as the root mean square error of approximation ( rmsea ) , the comparison fit index ( cfi ) , the tucker - lewis fit index ( tli ) , and the standardized root mean residual ( srmr ) .
rmsea < 0.06 , srmr < 0.08 , and cfi / tli > 0.95 are interpreted as having good fit , while values of rmsea <= 0.08 , srmr < 0.10 , and cfi / tli >= 0.90 are considered as indicating acceptable fit ( hu and bentler , 1999 ; kline , 2005 ) .
one should note , however , that interpretation of global fit indexes in models with ordered categorical indicators is not as well established as it is with continuous indicators ( hu and bentler , 1999 ) .
while simulation studies suggest that these cut - off values work reasonably well with categorical outcomes ( yu , 2002 ; muthen , 2004 ) , exact cut - off scores may not perfectly apply in the context of this study .
accordingly , alternative models were compared using a robust chi - square test using the difftest procedure .
the reliability of the three subscales was estimated with mcdonald 's model - based omega ( omega ) coefficient ( canivez , 2016 ) .
age and gender differences were assessed by regressing each of the latent scores on the age and gender variables .
all statistical analyses were performed with the mplus statistical package version 7.4 .
results cfa as shown in table 1 , the model fit of the three - factor model assessed by the srmr was shown to be excellent , while it could be considered satisfactory according to the cfi and tli coefficients .
rmsea , however , was slightly less adequate .
overall model fit could be considered as satisfactory and , as indicated on figure 1 , all factor loadings were supported .
factor correlations were high , suggesting that items could potentially be explained by a single dimension .
a simpler one - factor model was estimated and compared to the three - factor structure .
model fit seemed less adequate than the three - factor solution although all factor loadings were supported ( figure 2 ) .
because these two models were statistically nested , they could be compared using a robust chi - square difference test .
result confirmed that the three - factor model had significantly better fit than the one - factor model and should therefore be preferred ( deltachi2 = 130.598 , deltadf = 3 , p < 0.001 ) .
although statistically equivalent to the three - factor model , a higher - order model with three first - order factors loading onto a single overarching latent construct of savoring was estimated .
the goal was to allow the determination of which of the three factors had the highest or lowest loading on the overarching construct .
the loadings were high and quite similar ( anticipating pleasure = 0.917 , present moment pleasure = 0.817 , reminiscing pleasure = 0.893 ) .
the reliability of the four scores ( omega anticipating pleasure = 0.879 , omega present moment pleasure = 0.860 , omega reminiscing pleasure factor = 0.851 , omega total score = 0.941 ) was very good ( canivez , 2016 ) .
additionally , when regressed on age and gender , the four latent scores ( total score , anticipating pleasure , present moment pleasure , and reminiscing pleasure ) were not significantly related with these socio - demographic variables ( table 2 ) .

the results of the cfa indicated that the hypothesized three - factor structure of the french sbi was adequate , and all items contributed significantly to their corresponding factor : anticipating pleasure , present moment pleasure , and reminiscing pleasure .
the model - based reliability of all scores was very good .
the three types of pleasure savoring were substantially correlated and shared between 53 and 67 % of their variance .
these results suggest that individuals able to experience pleasure in one of these three subdomains were more likely to be able to do so in the two other dimensions .
however , based on the comparison between the one - and three - factor models , these three types of savoring may not be considered as undifferentiated and may represent theoretically meaningful and distinct dimensions .
despite the large amount of shared variance , there are theoretical benefits to conceptualizing savoring beliefs with three subscales rather than one ( bryant , 2003 ) .
the high correlation between the three subscales suggests that respondents are likely to have similar scores , on average .
however , this will not always be the case , and , in our opinion , these differences may allow the identification of important clinical conditions .
taken together , these results show that the sbi is a valid instrument to investigate savoring capacities in the three examined time frames .
in the original scale , compared to men , women showed higher mean scores on sbi total score and the different subscales ( bryant , 2003 ) , which was not the case here .
further , in our sample , age was not related to any of the scores of the sbi .
our study has several limitations that could be the focus of future studies .
first , our sample comprised only students in the mental health field , which might not be representative of the general population in terms of savoring abilities .
further , our sample was relatively young and included a large majority of females .
a study involving a more representative sample of the french - speaking population , including more males and elderly people , would further help understanding the different savoring abilities .
second , to further validate the french version of the sbi , concurrent and divergent validity must be examined .
further research on the psychometric characteristics of this scale may also include different clinical groups ( e.g. , people diagnosed with depression or schizophrenia ) .
finally , experimental designs may be used to examine the scale 's sensitivity to change before and after psychosocial interventions .
the current study showed that the french version of the sbi is an internally valid instrument with very good model - based reliability .
the results showed that the french version of the sbi was successfully adapted from the american version .
this scale may , therefore , be a valuable tool for french - speaking clinicians and researchers who need to explore savoring attitudes , for instance , in relation to the maintenance or the development of wellbeing , as well as for the development of new interventions focusing on pleasure with clinical populations ( nguyen et al. , 2016 ) .
the french version of the sbi completes the available scales for assessing pleasure in this language ( favrod et al. , 2009 ; chaix et al. , 2017 ) .

introduction high body mass index has been associated with increased risk for various cancers , including breast cancer .
here we describe studies using 7,12 - dimethylbenz ( a ) anthracene ( dmba ) to investigate the role of obesity in dmba - induced mammary tumor susceptibility in the female zucker rat ( fa / fa ) , which is the most widely used rat model of genetic obesity .
method fifty - day - old female obese ( n = 25 ) and lean ( n = 28 ) zucker rats were orally gavaged with 65 mg / kg dmba .
rats were weighed and palpated twice weekly for detection of mammary tumors .
rats were killed 139 days after dmba treatment .
results the first mammary tumor was detected in the obese group at 49 days after dmba treatment , as compared with 86 days in the lean group ( p < 0.001 ) .
the median tumor - free time was significantly lower in the obese group ( p < 0.001 ) .
using the days after dmba treatment at which 25 % of the rats had developed mammary tumors as the marker of tumor latency , the obese group had a significantly shorter latency period ( 66 days ) than did the lean group ( 118 days ) .
at the end of the study , obese rats had developed a significantly ( p < 0.001 ) greater mammary tumor incidence ( 68 % versus 32 %) compared with the lean group .
the tumor histology of the mammary tumors revealed that obesity was associated with a significant ( p < 0.05 ) increase in the number of rats with at least one invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma compared with lean rats .
conclusion our results indicate that obesity increases the susceptibility of female zucker rats to dmba - induced mammary tumors , further supporting the hypothesis that obesity and some of its mediators play a significant role in carcinogenesis .
introduction obesity has been identified as an epidemic in the usa for more than two decades , yet the proportion of overweight and obese adults in the population continues to grow .
the most recent data from the 1999 - 2000 national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes ) [ 1 ] showed that almost 65 % of adults in the usa are overweight , defined as having a body mass index ( bmi ) greater than 25 kg / m2 .
this is a significant increase from the 56 % for adults reported as overweight in nhanes iii , which was conducted between 1988 and 1994 .
the prevalence of obesity , defined as a bmi of 30 kg / m2 or greater , also increased dramatically from 23 % to 31 % during the same period .
it is estimated that the prevalence of obesity in adults will rise to 39 % by the year 2008 .
this trend has alarming health and economic implications , because obesity is associated with major causes of morbidity and mortality such as diabetes , cardiovascular disease and several types of cancers , including breast cancer [ 2,3 ] .
breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor among women , being the second leading killer of women in the usa [ 4 ] .
epidemiological studies link breast cancer and obesity in postmenopausal women [ 4 - 6 ] ; almost half of breast cancer cases among postmenopausal women occur in those with a bmi in excess of 29 kg / m2 [ 7 ] .
although a number of studies have shown that excess weight is a risk factor for breast and other cancers , calle and coworkers [ 8 ] concluded that 20 % of all deaths from cancer in women aged over 50 years old could be attributed to being overweight or obese .
in experimental models , higher body weight has been associated with an increase in both spontaneous and chemically induced mammary tumors in various strains of mice [ 7,9 - 12 ] .
in order to understand better the mechanisms that are associated with obesity and cancer , we have turned our attention to zucker rats as a model .
the zucker rat ( fa / fa ) is the best known , most widely used rat model of genetic obesity .
obesity in the zucker rat is inherited as an autosomal - recessive trait caused by a mutation ( fa ) in the leptin receptor gene [ 13,14 ] , discovered by zucker and zucker [ 15,16 ] .
animals homozygous for the fa allele become noticeably obese by age 3 - 5 weeks , and by 14 weeks of age more than 40 % of their body is composed of lipids [ 17 ] .
many investigators have used this model to study the development , etiology , associated pathogenesis , possible treatment , and putative mechanisms of severe obesity [ 18 ] .
obese zucker rats develop hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance before they develop obesity - associated , non - insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus in a manner similar to that in humans [ 19 ] .
lean zucker rats , in contrast , exhibit normal metabolic function and are considered ideal controls .
consequently , this model is an ideal one in which to investigate the relationship between obesity and mammary tumor development .
there has been only one study published that used female zucker rats as a model to investigate the role of obesity in mammary tumor development [ 20 ]. that study used n - methyl - n - nitrosourea ( mnu ) as a carcinogen and reported that lean rats developed more mammary tumors than did obese ones .
because of its similarity to human breast cancer , researchers have widely used the 7,12 - dimethylbenz ( a ) anthracene ( dmba ) - induced rat mammary carcinoma model to investigate breast carcinogenesis .
in the present study we observed that dmba - induced mammary tumors in obese zucker rats develop faster than they do in lean counterparts , and that obese animals were at more than double the risk for developing dmba - induced mammary tumors .
therefore , our results suggest that this model parallels the epidemiological data and is an appropriate model in which to investigate the mechanism ( s ) that underlie the role of obesity in mammary tumor development and possible prevention strategies .
materials and methods experimental design all animal protocols were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the university of arkansas for medical sciences .
obese fa / fa ( n = 25 ) and lean ( n = 28 ) zucker rats were purchased at age 6 weeks ( harlan industries , indianapolis , in , usa ) and housed in the animal facilities at the arkansas children 's hospital research institute .
rats were housed two per cage in polycarbonate cages and allowed free access to water and regular chow ( harlan - teklad , madison , wi , usa ) .
at the age of 50 days , all rats received via gavage 65 mg / kg dmba ( sigma chemical co. , st. louis , mo , usa ) , a chemical procarcinogen used widely to produce mammary adenocarcinoma in rats , in sesame oil [ 21,22 ] .
rats were weighed twice per week .
beginning 2 weeks after dmba treatment , all rats were palpated twice weekly to detect mammary tumors .
the detection date and location of each mammary tumor was recorded for each rat .
rats were killed 139 days after dmba treatment .
all mammary tumors were excised , counted , and weighed .
rats with tumor masses exceeding 2.5 cm in diameter were killed early for humane reasons , in accordance with our institutional animal care and use committee - approved animal protocol .
sections of all tumors were placed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin for histopathologic analysis .
sections ( 5 mum ) of the paraffin - embedded tumors were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic analysis .
pathology a board - certified anatomic pathologist ( sk ) evaluated tumors in a blinded protocol and classified them as benign or intraductal proliferation , as shown by multiple papillomas or with ductal hyperplasia , ductal carcinoma in situ , or invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma .
statistical analysis a one - way analysis of variance [ 23 ] was used to analyze body weight following dmba treatment .
the tumor - free times were plotted using a kaplan - meier curve [ 24 ] and the median times were compared using a generalized wilcoxon test [ 25 ] .
when there is no censoring , this test is equivalent to a mann - whitney rank sum test .
fisher 's exact test [ 26 ] was used to compare the percentage of rats with tumors and tumor histology in each group .
the median numbers of tumors per tumor - bearing rat ( multiplicity ) for each group were compared using the nonparametric mann - whitney test [ 27 ] .
statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 , and all p values were unadjusted for multiple comparisons .
for the few rats that were killed early because of tumor burden , we assumed that the number of tumors remained constant until the end of the study .
data analyses were generated and plots were constructed using spss ( c ) version 12.0 for windows ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) .
results body and organ weights as expected , all rats gained weight during the course of the experiment .
the average body weights ( mean +/ - standard error ) are shown in fig. 1a .
obese rats gained significantly ( p < 0.001 ) more weight than did lean rats .
at the beginning of the study ( 7 days before dmba treatment ) the mean body weights of lean and obese rats were 102.5 +/ - 1.5 g and 148 +/ - 3.5 g , respectively .
at the end of the study , the final mean body weights for lean and obese rats were 262.3 +/ - 4.2 g and 517.2 +/ - 17.9 g , respectively .
the obese rats gained approximately twice the weight of the lean rats .
obesity was associated with a significant increase in liver ( p < 0.001 ) and kidney ( p < 0.001 ) weights compared with those in the lean group ( table 1 ) .
this increase in liver weight in obese rats also was evident when liver weight was expressed as percentage of body weight ( p < 0.001 ) ; however , kidney weight as a percentage of body weight was not affected significantly by obesity .
time course for tumor formation , latency and multiplicity the time course of palpable mammary tumor detection is shown in fig. 1b , and data are presented in table 2 .
the tumor latency ( the number of days after dmba treatment until detection of the first mammary tumor ) was shorter in obese rats than in the lean rats .
the first mammary tumor detected in obese rats was 49 days after dmba treatment versus 86 days in lean rats , which represents a significant 37 - day delay for the development of mammary tumors in lean rats ( table 2 ) .
in addition , it took only 66 days after dmba treatment for 25 % of the obese rats to develop mammary tumors versus 118 days in lean rats - a delay of 52 days .
the median tumor - free time was significantly lower in the obese group ( p < 0.001 ; fig. 1b ). by the end of the study ( 139 days after dmba treatment ) , 68 % of obese rats had developed mammary tumors as compared with only 32 % of the lean rats ( p < 0.001 ; fig. 1b ) .
the median number of mammary tumors per tumor - bearing rat ( multiplicity ) increased from one tumor per rat in the lean group ( range : one to four tumors per rat ) to two tumors per rat in the obese group ( range : one to four tumors per rat ; table 2 ) .
for further comparison of mammary tumor development we evaluated tumor multiplicity at three time points ( 70 , 105 and 139 days after dmba treatment ) .
as demonstrated in fig. 1c , the obese rats developed mammary tumors earlier than did lean rats .
at 70 days after dmba treatment , several rats in the obese group had one to three tumors each , whereas no mammary tumors were detected in the lean group .
at 105 days after dmba treatment there were several rats in the obese group with tumors , including five rats with one tumor each , four rats with two tumors , two rats with three tumors , and one rat with four tumors .
this is in contrast to the lean group , in which only three rats had one tumor each and one rat had two tumors .
at 139 days after dmba treatment , there were seven rats in obese group with one tumor each , three rats with two tumors , four rats with three tumors , and three rats with four tumors .
in contrast , the lean group had five rats with one tumor each , two rats with two tumors , one rat with three tumors , and one rat with four tumors .
these findings indicate for the first time that obese zucker rats are an excellent model for investigating the role of obesity in dmba - induced mammary tumor development .
mammary tumor characteristics mammary tumor histology data and morphology are presented in table 2 and fig. 2 , respectively .
nine rats ( 32 %) in the lean group developed mammary tumors compared with 17 rats ( 68 %) in the obese group .
only two rats ( 7 %) in the lean group had at least one tumor graded as intraductal proliferation compared with four rats ( 16 %) in the obese group .
five rats ( 19 %) in the lean group had at least one tumor graded as ductal carcinoma in situ , compared with six rats ( 24 %) in the obese group .
obesity significantly increased ( p < 0.05 ) the number of rats ( 7 rats , 28 %) with at least one tumor graded as invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma compared with the lean group ( 2 rats , 7 %) .
a total of 53 mammary tumors were detected in the study ; 37 tumors ( 70 % of the total tumors ) were detected in the obese group versus 16 tumors ( 30 % of the total tumors ) in the lean group .
obesity was associated with a nonsignificant increase in tumor weight .
discussion higher body weight is associated with increased incidence of both spontaneous and chemically induced mammary tumors in various strains of mice [ 9,10,12,28 ] .
for example , the leprdb and lepob - tgfalpha transgenic mouse model , used to investigate the effects of obesity on tumorigenesis , are leptin deficient or have a leptin receptor defect .
however , these mice do not develop mammary tumors and therefore are not a suitable model in which to study the role of obesity in breast cancer [ 29 ] .
in the present study we observed that obese zucker rats are more susceptible to dmba - induced tumorigenesis than are lean rats .
these data clearly demonstrate the following when dmba was administered as a carcinogen to female zucker rats : obese rats developed mammary tumors at a faster rate than did lean rats ; obese rats exhibited shorter latency periods , both at the time of appearance of the first tumor and at the day at which tumor incidence reached 25 % , than lean did rats ; obesity resulted in a greater incidence of mammary tumors ; obese rats developed significantly more invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma than did lean rats ; and obese rats had a higher tumor multiplicity , albeit not statistically significantly so , compared with lean rats .
using sprague - dawley female rats , klurfeld and colleagues [ 30 ] studied the effects of calorie restriction on mammary tumor induction by dmba in rats fed a high - fat diet .
they found that a 25 % calorie restriction resulted in a significant reduction in mammary tumor incidence and tumor weight in both control rats and rats fed a high - fat diet .
further experiments implicated decreased serum insulin and insulin - like growth factor i levels in the inhibition of mammary tumor promotion in calorie restricted rats [ 31 ] .
in agreement with the present data in female zucker rats , genetically obese la / n - cp ( corpulent ) female rats developed more mammary tumors than did phenotypically lean littermates when they were treated with dmba .
klurfeld and coworkers [ 28 ] reported that calorie restriction ( 40 %) reduced tumor incidence to 27 % , compared with the 100 % tumor incidence observed in obese animals fed ad libitum .
those investigators suggested that calorie restriction resulted in decreased insulin levels , implicating hyperinsulinemia in obese ad libitum fed rats as a mechanism in increased tumor promotion .
the number of overweight and obese americans has doubled in the past two decades , which may have an impact on cancer risk and survival [ 1 ] .
the association between obesity and breast cancer risk has been inconclusive in a number of epidemiologic studies .
several studies have reported that increased body mass in premenopausal women is not associated with increased risk for breast cancer , whereas the same studies have demonstrated a positive association between increased body mass and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women [ 32,33 ] .
recent epidemiologic studies have suggested that the age at which a woman gains weight may be a more relevant factor in determining breast cancer risk [ 34 ] .
our results are in contrast to those of a previous study , which used mnu as a carcinogen to induce mammary tumors .
in that study [ 20 ] the authors reported that lean and obese rats had developed tumors at the same rate at 29 weeks after mnu treatment .
however , 50 % of the lean rats developed carcinomas of the mammary gland , as compared with only 10 % of the obese rats .
also , they reported a higher incidence of colorectal tumors in obese rats than in lean rats .
although mnu and dmba both produce mammary tumors in female rats , these tumors arise by different mechanisms of action [ 35 ] .
mnu is a direct acting carcinogen and does not require metabolic activation in order to form adducts that damage dna [ 36,37 ] .
dmba is a procarcinogen that requires metabolic activation by cytochrome p450 enzymes to reactive metabolites ( dihydrodiolepoxides ) that can form mutagenic dna adducts [ 35 ] .
these reactions are catalyzed principally by cyp1a2 in the liver and cyp1a1 and cyp1b1 in peripheral tissues such as the mammary gland .
our findings are consistent with those reported for induction of colon cancer with azoxymethane in mature , genetically obese male zucker rats .
in that study [ 38 ] obese zucker rats had significantly more colonic aberrant crypt formation than did any of the lean rats .
although the mechanism for an association with colon carcinogenesis is unknown , it is hypothesized that insulin and leptin resistance may play a role because leptin levels are typically threefold higher in the genetically obese zucker ( fa / fa ) rats than in their lean counterparts , because of the leptin receptor defect in these animals [ 39 ] .
however , recent results from epidemiological studies do not support the hypothesis that plasma leptin is a risk factor for breast cancer [ 40 ] .
nevertheless , body composition and weight are considered breast cancer risk factors that may influence prognosis [ 41 ] .
the relevance of dmba is that humans are exposed to dmba and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons through environmental or dietary sources , which may function in a synergistic manner with obesity and breast carcinogenesis .
exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in meats cooked at high temperature has been implicated in the development of breast cancer [ 42,43 ] .
we have demonstrated that obesity increases the susceptibility of female zucker rats to development of mammary tumors when dmba is used as the inducing carcinogen .
the mechanisms responsible for the observed increased risk for developing mammary tumors with obesity are not clearly understood .
several mechanisms may play roles in explaining the relationship we observed between obesity and increased mammary tumor development , including adipose associated hormones , adipokines , and inflammation [ 44 ] , which are manifested by the general genetics of the animals ; the exact relationships remain undefined and further work is needed .
future experiments with this model will focus on delineating the mechanisms responsible for this increased susceptibility to mammary cancer .
conclusion in conclusion , we have demonstrated that obesity increases the susceptibility of female zucker rats to development of mammary tumors when dmba is used as the inducing carcinogen .
the mechanisms responsible for the observed increased risk for developing mammary tumors with obesity remain to be defined .

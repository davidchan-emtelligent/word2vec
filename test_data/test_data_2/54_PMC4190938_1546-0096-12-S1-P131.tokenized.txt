moreover , serious adverse events are rare .
however , in dutch patients , mtx intolerance , defined as gastro - intestinal side effects occurring not only after , but also before administration of mtx and when thinking of the drug , occurred frequently .
mtx intolerance could lead to non - compliance and hence to decreased efficacy , eventually resulting in the necessity to replace it by more costly biologicals .
furthermore , it was observed significantly more often with subcutaneous ( sc ) than oral ( po ) administration , contrary to widely held views .
this finding was unexpected and the question about the choice of route of administration when starting mtx in daily clinical practice is still unsolved .
objectives the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of mtx intolerance and its association with the route of administration in a german cohort of jia patients to aid physicians in the choice of route of administration .
methods a cross - sectional study of jia patients on mtx was performed .
primary outcome was intolerance to mtx , which was determined using the validated methotrexate intolerance severity score ( miss ) questionnaire .
clinical and laboratory parameters , among which the route of administration , were compared between the intolerant and tolerant groups in univariate and multivariate analysis .
results of 179 jia patients on mtx , 73 ( 40.8 %) were intolerant. of the 46 patients who received exclusively mtx subcutaneous , 43.5 % were intolerant versus 29.5 % of 95 who received exclusively mtx po ( p = 0.100 ) .
the former experienced significantly more behavioural complaints ( 76.1 % versus 47.4 % , p = 0.001 ) and showed a trend towards more abdominal pain after mtx intake ( 43.5 % versus 27.4 % , p = 0.056 ) .
route of administration was associated with mtx intolerance in multivariate analysis , next to the duration of mtx use and the number of active joints .
conclusion the prevalence of mtx intolerance was high .
it was higher in patients on mtx sc , but not significantly , and they did experience more adverse effects than those on mtx po. therefore , and in the light of other studies in the field demonstrating more adverse effects in patients on mtx sc , po administration of mtx should be favoured over sc administration when starting mtx .

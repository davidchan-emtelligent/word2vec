background anca - associated systemic vasculitis ( aasv ) is characterized by leukocytoclasis , accumulation of unscavenged apoptotic and necrotic neutrophils in perivascular tissues .
dysregulation of neutrophil cell death may contribute directly to the pathogenesis of aasv .
methods neutrophils from healthy blood donors ( hbd ) , patients with aasv most in complete remission , polycythemia vera ( pv ) , systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) and renal transplant recipients ( tp ) were incubated in vitro , and the rate of spontaneous apoptosis was measured by facs .
plasma levels of cytokines and sfas were measured with cytometric bead array and elisa .
expression of pro / anti - apoptotic factors , transcription factors c / ebp - alpha , c / ebp - beta and pu.1 and inhibitors of survival / jak2 - pathway were measured by real - time - pcr .
results aasv , pv and ra neutrophils had a significantly lower rate of apoptosis compared to hbd neutrophils ( aasv 50 +/ - 14 % vs. hbd 64 +/ - 11 % , p < 0.0001 ) .
in ra but not in aasv and pv , low apoptosis rate correlated with increased plasma levels of gm - csf and high mrna levels of anti - apoptotic factors bcl - 2a1 and mcl - 1 .
aasv patients had normal levels of g - csf , gm - csf and il - 3 .
both c / ebp - alpha , c / ebp - beta were significantly higher in neutrophils from aasv patients than hbd .
levels of sfas were significantly higher in aasv compared to hbd .
conclusion neutrophil apoptosis rates in vitro are decreased in aasv , ra and pv but mechanisms seem to differ .
increased mrna levels of granulopoiesis - associated transcription factors and increased levels of sfas in plasma were observed in aasv .
additional studies are required to define the mechanisms behind the decreased apoptosis rates , and possible connections with accumulation of dying neutrophils in regions of vascular lesions in aasv patients .
introduction aasv is characterized by leukocytoclasis , infiltration and accumulation of unscavenged apoptotic or necrotic neutrophils in perivascular tissues and fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls [ 1 ] [ 2 ] .
activated , apoptotic and necrotic neutrophils are seen in histological samples from patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( gpa ) with respiratory disease [ 3 ] .
histological evidence suggests that neutrophil apoptosis may play a central role in the pathogenesis of aasv and production of anca ( anti - neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ) [ 4 ] [ 5 ] .
injection of brown norway rats with syngenic apoptotic neutrophils was shown to induce anca but not aasv , suggesting that additional factors are required for disease pathogenesis [ 6 ] .
higher levels of plasma pr3 have been reported in patients with quiescent aasv ( in remission ) compared to healthy blood donors ( hbd ) [ 7 ] [ 8 ] .
furthermore , membrane pr3 - positive ( mpr3 +) neutrophils are more abundant in individuals with quiescent aasv indicating that pr3 plays an active role in the pathogenesis of aasv and not just a marker of inflammation .
it has been shown that pr3 can trigger cultured endothelial cell apoptosis ; however , the mechanism was not defined [ 9 ] .
pr3 activates procaspase - 3 into a specific 22 - kda fragment , localized to the plasma membrane - enriched compartment and segregated from its target cytosolic proteins that promote apoptosis , thus causing activation but not apoptosis [ 10 ] .
vong et al showed that recombinant pr3 or the membrane fraction of cells stably - transfected with pr3 can cleave annexin - a1 ( anxa1 ) , suggesting that anxa1 may be a physiologically relevant substrate for pr3 [ 11 ] ; anxa1 was recently recognized as an important inducer or promotor of neutrophil apoptosis .
harper et al reported faster apoptosis in neutrophils from patients with active vasculitis compared to neutrophils from patients with quiescent vasculitis or from hbd ; neutrophils from patients with active vasculitis also had higher levels of mpr3 and superoxide production [ 12 ] .
pr3 can be mobilized to the plasma membrane in the absence of prior neutrophil priming and independent of degranulation during the apoptotic process [ 13 ] .
kantari et al showed that phospho - lipid scramblase - 1 ( plscr - 1 ) interacts with pr3 and promotes its translocation to the plasma membrane in a flip - flop manner during apoptosis [ 14 ] .
however , the level of mpr3 is similar in apoptotic and non - apoptotic primed neutrophils , implying that the mpr3 on apoptotic neutrophils may be a result of minor trauma during neutrophil isolation [ 15 ] .
our group has previously shown that the level of mpr3 on aging neutrophils is slowly decreasing and is not a pre - apoptotic marker [ 16 ] .
thus , pr3 seems to be linked to neutrophil apoptosis , though the exact nature of this relationship is not clear .
as there is definite evidence for increase pr3 and neutrophil accumulation in aasv , it is likely that neutrophil apoptosis may contribute to disease pathogenesis .
accumulation of neutrophils in aasv tissues may occur as a result of either an increase in granulopoiesis , defective apoptosis or impaired clearance of apoptotic neutrophils .
based on elevation of pr3 in quiescent aasv and its link to neutrophil apoptosis , we hypothesized that the neutrophil apoptosis in aasv is dysregulated even during remission .
in this study , we focus on early events explaining the origin of anca by studying patients in remission ; our attempt was to confirm abnormality in apoptotic rate in aasv and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the hypothesized dysregulation .
the rates of spontaneous in vitro apoptosis were noted in neutrophils from aasv patients most in complete remission or with mild activity and other study populations ; these were analyzed in relation to clinical data .
the expression of selected genes and proteins involved in neutrophil survival was evaluated in relation to apoptosis .
methods patients during the period between september 2006 and february 2008 , 44 aasv patients ( most in complete remission or having mild activity ) from the department of nephrology , lund university hospital were recruited into the current study .
patients diagnosed with aasv were classified as gpa or microscopic polyangiitis ( mpa ) using the european medicines agency ( emea ) algorithm [ 17 ] .
the vasculitis activity status of all patients was determined using the birmingham vasculitis activity score ( bvas ) [ 18 ] .
aasv patients were receiving the following treatments at time of sampling : 21 patients - cytotoxic drugs and steroids ; 10 patients - cytotoxic drugs ; 5 patients - steroids ; 8 patients - no treatment ( table 1 ) .
none of the patients had received biological treatment .

additional study participants included hbd from the local blood bank , tp recipients from the department of nephrology , pv patients from the department of haematology , sle and ra patients from the department of rheumatology , all at lund university hospital ( table 1 ) .
none of the disease controls was treated with biological treatment .
this study was approved by the regional ethical review board and performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki .
informed signed consent was obtained from all study participants .
blood sampling and separation leukocytes were isolated by centrifugation on polymorphprep ( axis - shield , oslo , norway ) .
plasma band was used to measure levels of different cytokines .
the neutrophil band was used to study neutrophil survival , apoptosis and necrosis by facs and to extract rna for real time pcr .
neutrophil in vitro culture and facs isolated neutrophils were cultured in aim - v medium ( neither calf nor human serum was used ) and incubated in an incubator with 5 % co2 in humid atmosphere , at 37degreesc , for 20 h. an aliquot ( 106 neutrophils ) was taken and incubated for 5 min in the dark with 1 microl annexin - v ( marker of apoptosis from invitrogen , molecular probes , oregon , usa ) and 10 microl 7 - aad ( marker of necrosis from bd - biosciences , san jose , ca , usa ) .
annexin - v was conjugated with alexa 488 while 7 - aad was conjugated with pe ( phycoerythrin ) .
neutrophils were then analyzed by flow cytometry using bd facscanto ii ( bd pharmingen , ca , usa ) to report % of apoptotic , necrotic or alive cells after 20 h of in vitro culture .
rna extraction total rna was extracted with rneasy mini kit ( qiagen , vwr international , west chester , pa , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
rna purity was evaluated by spectrophotometric analysis using nanodrop ( saveen & werner , malmo , sweden ) .
quantitative pcr assay cdna was prepared from total rna using taqman reverse transcription kit ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
briefly , reverse transcription was performed using random hexamers , multiscribe reverse transcriptase , rnase inhibitor , dntps , 5.5 mm mgcl2 , reverse transcription buffer , and 200 ng total rna in a volume of 50 microl .
the reaction cycle was 25degrees / 10 min , 48degrees / 30 min and 95degrees / 5 min .
quantitative pcr assays were performed in an abi prism 7000 sequence detector ( applied biosystems , ca , usa ) with taqman universal master mix ung under standard conditions .
assay on demand provided a unique combination of forward and reverse primers and fluorescent mgb - probes for each target gene ( bax , mcl - 1 , bcl - 2a1 , c - iap2 , c / ebp - alpha , c / ebp - beta , pu.1 , ship - 1 , socs1 and socs3 ) .
cyclophilin a expression was used as an internal control for data normalization .
each 25 microl reaction contained the amount of cdna produced from 10 ng rna .
all reactions were performed in triplicates .
q - pcr data were analyzed using the deltadeltact method with normalization to cyclophilin a and standard 2 ( - deltadelta ct ) calculations [ 19 ] .
measurement of neutrophil growth factors and soluble fas in plasma by elisa and cytometric bead array ( cba ) g - csf , gm - csf , il - 3 and soluble fas ( sfas ) were measured in plasma with the quantikine ( r ) elisa kit ( r & d systems , abingdon , uk ) , which was used according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
g - csf , gm - csf , il - 3 , tnf - alpha , ifn - gamma , il - 1beta , il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 6 and il - 8 were simultaneously analyzed in 50 microl plasma by flow cytometry using the bd cba human soluble protein flex set system ( bd pharmingen , ca , usa ) according to the manufactures instructions .
statistical analysis for continuous variables , an unpaired t - test was used to measure statistical significance of differences between two groups .
results are presented as mean +/ - sd. for data sets that follow a non - gaussian distribution , statistical significance was measured using a mann - whitney test .
results are presented as median and range or interquartile range ( iqr ) .
one - way anova with bonferroni 's post - test was used to compare data from more than two groups .
correlations were analyzed using pearson rank test .
spearman rank test was used for non - parametric data .
a two - sided p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .
results neutrophil apoptosis in vitro apoptosis , necrosis and survival of neutrophils from 44 patients with aasv , 93 hbd , 20 tp recipients , 17 pv , 21 sle and 21 ra patients was quantified after 20 h in culture as described in the method section .
the results showed a significantly higher rate of survival ( mean +/ - sd 34 +/ - 13 % vs 23 +/ - 9 % , p < 0.0001 ; figure 1a ) and lower rate of apoptosis ( 50 +/ - 14 % vs 64 +/ - 11 % , p < 0.0001 ; figure 1b ) in aasv neutrophils compared to neutrophils from hbd .
similar results were obtained when examining neutrophils from ra and pv patients , with survival rates of 31 +/ - 13 % and 49 +/ - 15 % ( p = 0.015 and p < 0.0001 ) , and apoptosis rates of 57 +/ - 12 % and 41 +/ - 14 % ( p = 0.027 and p < 0.0001 ) .
for necrosis there was no significant difference between neutrophils from aasv , pv and ra neutrophils compared to hbd neutrophils ( data not shown ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0032439.g001 figure 1 rate of neutrophil survival and apoptosis .
neutrophils isolated from 60 hbd , 44 aasv patients , 8 pv patients , 18 tp , 21 sle patients , and 20 ra patients were cultured in vitro in aim - v medium .
the percentage of surviving neutrophils ( 1a ) and apoptotic neutrophils ( 1b ) was measured after 20 hours .
% neutrophil survival = % of annexin - v negative and 7 - aad negative cells after 20 hour culture .
% neutrophil apoptosis = % of annexin - v positive and 7 - aad negative cells after 2o hour culture .
hbd = healthy blood donors .

sle = systemic lupus erythematosus .
ra = rheumatoid arthritis .
no correlation between neutrophil apoptosis and clinical data to ascertain that the reduced rate of apoptosis was not a consequence of gender , age , renal function , general inflammation or treatment , apoptosis rates were correlated with clinical data for the aasv patients .
no significant correlations were found with gender ( men and women had similar rates : 49 +/ - 11 % vs. 51 +/ - 15 % ; p = 0.5 , n = 22 for men and n = 22 for women ) or age ( spearman r = 0.01 , p = 0.9 , n = 44 ) .
there was no correlation with serum creatinine concentration ( spearman r = - 0.13 , p = 0.4 , n = 44 ) or estimated gfr ( spearman r = 0.1 , p = 0.5 , n = 44 ) .
similar results were observed for patients with gpa and mpa ( 49 +/ - 12 % vs 53 +/ - 16 % ; p = 0.4 ; n = 31 for gpa and n = 13 for mpa ) .
there was no correlation with crp ( spearman r = - 0.11 , p = 0.5 , n = 44 ) .
regarding disease activity , no conclusion could be drawn ; since patients in remission ( bvas < 2 , n = 31 ) had comparable apoptosis rates as patients with moderate vasculitis activity ( bvas 2 - 5 , n = 11 ) .
patients with high vasculitic activity ( bvas > 5 , n = 2 ) had tendency towards lower apoptosis rate ( 51 +/ - 14 % and 52 +/ - 9 % vs 28 +/ - 13 % ; p = 0.09 ) ; this difference was not significant , though the number of patients was too small to draw a definite conclusion .
we could not demonstrate any influence ongoing steroid treatment on the measured rate of apoptosis , as there was no correlation between neutrophil apoptosis and the dose of prednisolone mg / day ( spearman r = - 0.11 , p = 0.5 ) .
we divided the patients into two subgroups ; a subgroup treated with steroids and a subgroup without steroids : there was no difference between the two subgroups in regard to neutrophil apoptosis ( 49 +/ - 13 % vs 51 +/ - 15 % , p = 0.6 ) .
for anti - proliferative drugs the situation was somewhat more complex ; the 27 aasv patients who were on treatment tended to have lower apoptosis rates as compared to the 8 patients who were off all kinds immunosuppressive treatment ( 47 +/ - 12 % vs 57 +/ - 15 % ; p = 0.02 ) , with no obvious difference between drugs .
the 10 methotrexate treated patients had a mean rate of 46 +/ - 11 % , compared with 48 +/ - 12 % for 10 patients on azathioprine and 48 +/ - 13 % for 7 patients on mycophenolate mofetil ( p = 0.94 ) .
in contrast , 11 renal transplant recipients on mycophenolate mofetil had a mean apoptosis rate of 57 +/ - 16 % .
plasma factors potentially influencing neutrophil survival in aasv the plasma levels of g - csf , gm - csf , il - 3 , tnf - alpha , ifn - gamma , il - 1beta , il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 6 and il - 8 were measured using cytometric bead analysis ( cba ) , and g - csf , gm - csf , il - 3 and sfas were also quantified using elisa .
for most cytokines examined , there were no significant difference between hbd and aasv .
il - 3 was below the detection limit in all tested samples .
g - csf was elevated in plasma samples from 10 / 44 aasv patients ( median , range : 31.7 , 20 - 72 pg / ml ) and 4 / 21 ra patients ( 26.9 , 17 - 43 pg / ml - table 2 ) , but there was no correlation between the plasma levels of g - csf and the rates of neutrophil survival and apoptosis in these patients .
patients were divided into two subgroups according to their g - csf levels ; there was no difference between the two subgroups in their neutrophil survival / apoptosis ( table 2 ) .
g - csf was also detected in 10 / 93 hbd ( 28.3 , 15 - 46 pg / ml ) , which is slightly lower than aasv , but the difference was not significant ( p = 0.29 ) .

aasv = anca - associated systemic vasculitis .
pv = polycythemia vera .
tp = renal transplant recipients .
ra = rheumatoid arthritis .
neutrophils from 31 aasv patients and 23 hbd had similar mrna expression of survival / jak2 - pathway inhibitors ( ship - 1 , socs1 and socs3 ; p > 0.05 ) .
mrna expression of growth factor receptors was analyzed in 19 aasv patients and 9 hbd ; no significant differences were noted ( g - csfr , gm - csfr alpha and beta ; p > 0.05 ) .
discussion neutrophils release reactive oxygen species and proteases into the tissue microenvironment , leading to tissue inflammation and injury .
when cultured in vitro , in the absence or presence of insufficient concentrations of neutrophil survival factors , these cells undergo spontaneous apoptosis [ 20 ] .
neutrophils are removed from tissues via necrosis or apoptosis , followed by phagocytosis by macrophages [ 21 ] [ 22 ] .
defects in apoptotic pathways could lead to the persistence of auto - reactive t - or b - cells and development of autoimmune disease , including aasv [ 23 ] .
our study is the first to demonstrate a lower rate of spontaneous apoptosis and longer in vitro survival in neutrophils from aasv patients as compared to neutrophils from hbd , sle patients , and tp. decreased apoptosis was also noted in neutrophils from pv and ra patients , in accordance with previously published data [ 24 ] [ 25 ] .
an accelerated rate of apoptosis and decreased phagocytosis by macrophages for neutrophils from sle patients has been reported previously [ 26 ] .
contrary to our results , harper et al. showed that neutrophils from aasv patients , especially those with active disease , have an accelerated rate of apoptosis [ 12 ] .
in this study involving 8 patients with active systemic vasculitis and 17 patients in remission , apoptosis was correlated with high mpr3 expression and high intracellular superoxide production .
the neutrophils , however , were incubated in dmem medium with 10 % autologous serum , and in our study we did not use serum / plasma in the culture of neutrphils in aim - v medium .
they assessed neutrophil apoptosis after 12 and 18 hours while we assessed neutrophil apoptosis after 20 hours .
another difference is in the methods used to assess apoptosis .
while we used simultaneous labeling of neutrophils by annexin - v and 7 - aad with subsequent measurement by facs , harper et al have used neutrophil morphology and fluorescence microscopy to define apoptotic neutrophils .
in our study we had only two patients with active disease ( bvas > 5 ) , as we chose to study patients in remission in an attempt to understand early pathophysiological mechanisms and to exclude inflammation .
delayed neutrophil apoptosis has been associated with several diseases and syndromes including sepsis , sleep apnea , cystic fibrosis , pneumonia , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , behcet disease in the remission phase of uveitis , inflammatory bowel disease , systemic inflammatory response syndrome after major trauma and kawasaki disease [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] .
the occurrence of reduced apoptosis in such a variety of disorders suggests a common underlying factor , such as chronic inflammation .
however , we did not observe any correlation between rate of apoptosis and markers of inflammation or clinical parameters ( crp , bvas score , gfr ) .
moreover , most of our aasv patients were having no or mild vasculitis activity as revealed by undetectable / low plasma levels of most of the cytokines tested in our study .
although the use of immunosuppressive drugs may have confounded the results , the difference between aasv and tp patients suggests that drugs could at most account for only a minor part of the prolonged neutrophil survival .
increased proportion of cd177 +/ pr3 + subpopulation of neutrophils is seen in aasv , sle , as well as in states associated with increased granulupoiesis such as sepsis .
no correlation between rate of apoptosis and proportion of cd177 +/ pr3 + neutrophils was evident in our data .
growth factor signaling prolongs survival through production of anti - apoptotic factors and / or down regulation of pro - apoptotic factors .
the expression of anti - apoptotic bcl - 2a1 is up - regulated by g - csf , gm - csf and lps , which also promote neutrophil survival [ 31 ] [ 32 ] , while mcl - 1 is up - regulated by gm - csf , il - 1 and lps [ 33 ] .
c - iap2 , an inhibitor of apoptosis protein ( iap ) , is selectively up - regulated by g - csf , but not by gm - csf [ 34 ] .
the pro - apoptotic factor bax is down - regulated in response to g - csf , gm - csf , il - 3 and ifn - gamma [ 35 ] .
in our study , the mrna levels of these factors showed no correlation with reduced apoptosis or necrosis in neutrophils from aasv or pv patients .
however , expression of bcl - 2a1 and mcl - 1 was significantly higher in neutrophils from ra patients than in hbd , table 4 .
alteration in neutrophil growth factor signaling may cause abnormalities in apoptosis .
we measured the expression of transcription factors involved in steady - state and emergency granulopoiesis [ 36 ] [ 37 ] .
the mrna levels of these factors ( c / ebp - alpha , c / ebp - beta and pu.1 ) were significantly higher in aasv patients than in hbd , but were normal in patients with ra or tp recipients .
the target genes of these transcription factors include many important neutrophil proteins , including g - csf receptor , gm - csf receptor , myeloperoxidase , pr3 , elastase , lysozyme and lactoferrin [ 38 ] [ 39 ] .
thus , elevated expression of these proteins in aasv neutrophils may enhance their susceptibility / sensitivity to cytokines .
also , the transcription factors may stimulate neutrophil survival and granulopoiesis directly , independent of g - csf and gm - csf and their respective receptors [ 40 ] [ 41 ] .
increase of c / ebp - beta indicates ongoing granulopoiesis via the emergency pathway , which may lead to an increased amount of naive neutrophils in the circulation with possibly an altered phenotype .
neutrophils from aasv patients had similar mrna expression of survival / jak2 - pathway inhibitors and growth factor receptors as compared to hbd , suggesting that they may not be directly involved in reduction of apoptosis .
plasma contains a multitude of neutrophil growth factors .
previous experiments measuring various cytokines ( known to increase neutrophil survival ) failed to show conclusive results .
christensson et al. showed that aasv patients , in remission , had higher circulating levels of soluble fas than hbd and other disease controls [ 42 ] .
sfas is a circulating receptor of death signals in the plasma ; its presence in plasma prevent interaction between fas and fasl ( fas ligand ) , leading to prolonged survival [ 43 ] .
we found significantly elevated sfas levels in patients with aasv , suggesting a possible role in delaying apoptosis , although the biological significance of this finding is unclear .
elevated levels of sfas could also be related to lymphocyte activation , which is already reported in aasv even during quiescent disease [ 44 ] [ 45 ] .
g - csf , gm - csf and il - 3 , enhance neutrophil survival and delay or prevent neutrophil apoptosis [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] .
plasma levels of il - 3 levels were normal in all vasculitis patient subgroups examined in this study .
gm - csf levels were higher than normal in 4 ( of 44 ) aasv patients and in 8 ( of 20 ) ra patients , table 3 .
interestingly , these 8 ra patients exhibited delayed neutrophil apoptosis as compared to the other ra patients , indicating different mechanisms for delayed apoptosis in ra and aasv .
all other cytokines ( tnf - alpha , ifn - gamma , il - 1beta , il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 6 and il - 8 ) tested in this study were undetectable in almost all plasma samples from healthy controls , and in most of the samples from aasv patients .
this may be secondary to the fact that most of our patients were in complete remission .
even though levels of g - csf , gm - csf and il - 3 , were not elevated in aasv , they could still cause delayed apoptosis if aasv neutrophils were to have increased sensitivity to these cytokines .
our results show no difference between aasv patients and hbd regarding mrna expression of g - csf - receptor ( cd114 ) and gm - csf - receptor ( cd116 ) .
no previous studies on cd114 or cd116 expression have been published in regards to vasculitis patients , although studies on these receptors have been done in other inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowl disease and showed low / defective cd116 [ 49 ] .
future studies addressing these issues could be very interesting .
in summary , we find decreased spontaneous apoptosis in aasv , ra and pv , but mechanisms seem to differ .
our data demonstrating decreased apoptosis , increased mrna levels of the c / ebp - alpha and c / ebp - beta transcription factors , together with previous findings of increased proportion of double positive cd177 +/ pr3 + cells and increased transcription of the pr3 gene provides evidence for an altered neutrophil phenotype in aasv .
a higher rate of neutropoiesis / granulopoiesis in aasv together with a lower rate of neutrophil apoptosis , may contribute to neutrophil accumulation in regions of inflammation .
a definite mechanism for the delayed apoptosis in aasv could not be defined , our results are compatible with a role for an unidentified circulating factor , but intrinsic mechanisms cannot be ruled out .
novel survival pathways are emerging that have been reviewed recently by witko - sarsat et al [ 50 ] , describe a cytosolic scaffold protein , proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( pcna ) , a cell cycle regulatory protein that is usually used by proliferating cells in proliferation , is used by neutrophils in regulating / inhibiting apoptosis .
a recent study by witko - sarsat et al showed increased pcna expression ( both on mrna and protein level ) in neutrophils from aasv patients and that may give an explanation for our yet unexplained finding of prolonged neutruphil survival [ 51 ] .
however , this postulate must be tested simultaneously in the same samples / neutrophils .
improved understanding of mechanisms by which neutrophil survival and apoptosis are regulated will help explain the pathophysiology of aasv and may have implications for the diagnosis and treatment , also of related diseases .

the chinese formula bushen - yizhi ( bsyz ) has been reported to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction .
however the mechanism is still unclear .
in this study , we employ an aging model , samp8 mice , to explore whether bsyz could protect dementia through sirt1 / endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) stress pathway .
morris water maze and the fearing condition test results show that oral administration of bsyz ( 1.46 g / kg / d , 2.92 g / kg / d and 5.84 g / kg / d ) and donepezil ( 3 mg / kg / d ) shorten the escape latency , increase the crossing times of the original position of the platform and the time spent in the target quadrant , and increase the freezing time .
bsyz decreases the activity of acetylcholinesterase ( ache ) , and increases the activity of choline acetyltransferase ( chat ) and the concentration of acetylcholine ( ach ) in both hippocampus and cortex .
in addition , western blot results ( bcl - 2 , bax and caspase - 3 ) and tunel staining show that bsyz prevents neuron from apoptosis , and elevates the expression of neurotrophic factors , including nerve growth factor ( ngf ) , postsynapticdensity 95 ( psd95 ) and synaptophysin ( syn ) , in both hippocampus and cortex .
bsyz also increases the protein expression of sirt1 and alleviates er stress - associated proteins ( perk , ire - 1alpha , eif - 2alpha , bip , pdi and chop ) .
these results indicate that the neuroprotective mechanism of bsyz might be related with sirt1 / er stress pathway .
aging dementia bushen - yizhi formula sirt1 er stress introduction senescence is characterized by a complex process of molecular , cellular , and organ damage [ 1 ] .
it leads to progressive loss of function and increases susceptibility to death and disease including cardiovascular disease , diabetes , osteoporosis , cancer etc .
aging is a well - established risk factor for dementia [ 2 , 3 ] , which aggravates with increasing age [ 4 ] .
as reported , the prevalence of dementia is about 1 percent at the age of 60 , doubles every 5 years , and reaches 30 to 50 percent by the age of 85 [ 5 ] .
who estimates that the rate of dementia will be doubled every 20 years , and reaching 115.4 million in 2050 [ 6 ] .
the clinical syndromes of dementia including acquired losses of cognitive , emotional abilities severe enough to interfere with daily functioning and the quality of life [ 7 ] .
it is a progressive accumulation of damaged molecules ( dna oxidation / mutation , protein modification , protein aggregation , lipid peroxidation ) and impaired energy metabolism ( calorie intake , insulin resistant , oxyradical production , glycation ) in brain cells [ 8 ] .
as more people are living longer , dementia is becoming more common in the population .
however , limited proposed aging interventions have received good press. with the aging population increase , appropriate interventions of dementia are urgently needed .
bushen - yizhi formula ( bsyz ) , a traditional chinese medicine compound recipe , consists of she chuang zi ( cnidium monnieri ( l. ) cuss. , fruit ) , ren shen ( panax ginseng c. a. mey. , rhizome ) , zhi he shou wu ( preparata of polygonum multiflorum thuna. , radix ) , mu dan pi ( paeonia suffruticosa andr. , cortex ) , nv zhen zi ( ligustrum lucidum ait. , fruit ) and gou qi ( lycium barbarum l. , fruit ) ( ait .

in our previous studies , we found that bsyz could protect against dementia .
in a multi - center , randomized , double - blind , controlled clinical trial , patients with dementia show significant increase in mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) scores after treatment of bsyz .
in animal experiments , bsyz could ameliorate the spatial memory and object memory impairments through cholinergic pathways , ngf signaling and anti - apoptosis in ibotenic acid ( ibo ) induced cognitive dysfunction [ 9 , 10 ] .
however , the neuroprotective mechanism of bsyz is still obscure .
the unfolded protein response ( upr ) is a stress response of the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) to a disturbance in protein folding [ 11 - 13 ] .
aging is recognized as a major modifier of the outcome of er stress .
accumulated evidences show a shift of the upr towards its proapoptotic state during aging with decreased or increased expression of the components of the upr [ 14 - 16 ] .
in addition , upr can be regulated by sirtuin 1 ( sirt1 ) .
sirt1 reduced er stress and apoptosis of brown adipocyte in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting smad3 / atf4 signal [ 17 ] .
sirt1 mitigated mir - 204 - mediated vascular er stress to preserve cav1 - dependent endothelial function [ 18 ] .
sirt1 belongs to the sirtuin family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( nad +) - dependent deacetylases , which is involved in aging , stress response , maintenance of genomic integrity , and energy metabolism [ 19 ] .
in this study , we employed an aging - related model , samp8 ( senescence - accelerated mouse prone 8 ) [ 20 ] , to explore whether bsyz could improve cognitive dysfunction through er stress signal .
we treated the mice with three different doses ( 1.46 g / kg / d , 2.92 g / kg / d and 5.84 g / kg / d ) of bsyz .
we explore the potential mechanism of bsyz on ameliorating dementia might be through sirt1 / er stress signal .
results bsyz improves learning and memory of samp8 mice in morris water maze test , the time for mice to find the hidden platform was declined progressively during the five training days ( figure 1a and 1b ) .
in contrast to senescence - accelerated resistant mice 1 ( samr1 ) group , the period of time to find the hidden platform remarkably increased in senescence - accelerated mouse prone 8 ( samp8 ) group .
however , bushen - yizhi ( bsyz , low - dose , middle - dose and high - dose ) and donepezil ( don , a drug for dementia prevention ) obviously shortened escape latency when compared with samp8 group , especially for high - dose group ( p < 0.001 , figure 1a ) .
the samp8 group presented a chaotic and longer swimming path , which were improved by bsyz and don ( figure 1b ) .
on the sixth day , the probe trial was performed by removing the platform and allowing the mice to swim freely to estimate their spatial - working memory ( figure 1c and 1d ) .
samp8 group presented a less time spent in target quadrant , fewer times crossing the position of the removed platform ( p < 0.001 ) , which were ameliorated by bsyz and don .
the swimming speed of samp8 group was significantly decreased ( p < 0.001 ) compared with samr1 group , but no obvious difference was observed among samp8 , bsyz and don groups ( figure 1e ) .

in fear conditioning test ( fct ) , differences were observed between samr1 and samp8 group in both the contextual and the cued recall paradigms .
samp8 group presented less freezing time and freezing times ( p < 0.001 , figure 2a and 2b ) .
these were ameliorated after treatment of bsyz and don .
these results demonstrated that treatment with bsyz remarkably reversed the cognitive deficits in samp8 mice .

bsyz improves the cholinergic nerve system in samp8 mice to illuminate the potential mechanism of bsyz in ameliorating cognition deficiency in samp8 mice , the activities of cholinergic marker enzymes and the level of acetylcholine ( ach ) were detected .
a remarkable increase of acetylcholinesterase ( ache ) activity in samp8 both in hippocampus and cortex ( p < 0.001 , p < 0.01 , figure 3b and 3e ) , while the treatment with bsyz and don significantly decreased the ache activity .
the activity of choline acetyltransferase ( chat ) and concentration of ach in samp8 group was decreased sharply in both hippocampus and cortex , whereas bsyz and don enhanced the activity of chat and increased the concentration of ach significantly ( figure 3a , 3c , 3d and 3f ) .
thus , bsyz could protect cognitive deficits by influencing cholinergic nervous system .

bsyz decreases neuronal apoptosis in samp8 mice as shown in figure 4a and 4b , the expression of apoptosis - related proteins bax and cleaved caspase - 3 increased and bcl - 2 decreased in samp8 both in hippocampus and cortex .
both bsyz and don increased the bcl - 2 expression and decreased the bax and cleaved caspase - 3 expressions .
tunel staining was also performed ( figure 4c ) .
tunel - positive cells were stained deep brown in the cortex .
compared with samr1 mice , tunel - positive cells in the cortex of samp8 were prominently increased .
bsyz and don markedly attenuated the neuronal apoptosis in samp8 mice .
these results demonstrated that bsyz could improve the ability of anti - apoptosis in samp8 mice .

bsyz ameliorates neurodegeneration in samp8 mice as shown in figure 5 , the expression of neurotrophic factors including nerve growth factor ( ngf ) , postsynapticdensity 95 ( psd95 ) and synaptophysin ( syn ) was sharply decreased in samp8 .
while under the treatment of bsyz and don , the proteins regain to the normal level ( figure 5a and 5b ) .
nissl 's staining was further detected ( figure 5c ) .
in the hippocampal subfield of samp8 , the neurons were significantly shrunken , irregularly arranged , and weakly stained , which indicated that neurons were diffusely deteriorated or dead and a great many nissl bodies lost in these neurons .
significant difference was shown between samp8 group and bsyz group , which displayed regularly arranged , deeply stained and normal form neurons .
these results indicated that bsyz could ameliorate neurodegeneration in samp8 mice .

bsyz actives sirt1 and attenuates endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) stress in samp8 mice as shown in figure 6 , the expression of sirt1 decreased in both hippocampus and cortex ( p < 0.05 , p < 0.01 ) , but increased in bsyz ( middle - and high - dose ) and don group ( p < 0.01 ) .
next we measured the protein levels of the two er stress transducers , perk and ire - 1alpha and the expression of chaperones bip ( figure 7a and 7b ) .
there was an increase in active forms of the effectors of upr ( p - perk , p - ire - 1alpha ) and bip in samp8 group as compared with the samr1 , while decreased after the administration of bsyz .
to further evaluate the consequences of er stress , we next measured the expression levels of chop , pdi and eif - 1alpha .
both chop and p - eif - 1alpha in samp8 are up - regulated compared with samr1 , while down - regulated after the intervention of bsyz .
the expression of pdi sharply decreased but increased under the effect of bsyz and don both in hippocampus and cortex ( figure 7c and 7d ) .
these results indicated that the effect of bsyz on protecting cognitive deficits might be related with sirt1 / er stress pathway in samp8 mice .

discussion in this study , we demonstrate that chinese formula , bsyz , is capable of mitigating age - associated cognitive decline in samp8 mice .
a four - week - administration of bsyz protected the learning and memory , improved central cholinergic neurotransmission and ameliorated apoptosis in both hippocampus and cortex .
in addition , bsyz activated sirt1 and attenuated endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) stress , which might be an important mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of bsyz .
senescence - accelerated mouse prone 8 ( samp8 ) inherits early onset and irreversible advancement of senescence based on longevity curves and phenotypic changes characteristic of aging [ 21 ] .
the mice share similar characteristics with aged humans , such as reduced lifespan , lordosis , hair loss , reduced physical activity [ 22 ] , elevated biomarkers of oxidative stress [ 23 ] , inflammation [ 24 ] , mitochondrial dysfunction [ 25 ] , brain microvessel defect sand blood - brain barrier dysfunction [ 26 ] .
the principal phenotypic characteristic is progressive cognitive decline and neurodegenerative changes [ 27 ] .
numerous studies have reported that samp8 mice have significant memory dysfunction in spatial learning and memory tasks , active and passive avoidance response tasks , fear conditioning and object recognition memory tasks [ 28 ] .
these features demonstrate that samp8 is a successful dementia model .
in this study , we found that bsyz could improve the learning and memory of samp8 mice , which is according with our previous studies [ 9 , 10 ] .
donepezil ( don ) showed the similar effect on elevating the availability of ach in the brain , which has been documented as critical for the effective management of alzheimer 's disease and used as a positive control in ameliorating memory and cognitive impairments [ 29 , 30 ] .
choline acetyltransferase ( chat ) is a presynaptic cholinergic enzyme , which synthesizes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine ( ach ) .
chat activity has been found to be reduced in neurodegenerative disease disease [ 31 , 32 ] .
the neurotransmitter ach is released from the presynaptic neuron into the synaptic cleft .
then ach binds to ach receptors on the postsynaptic membrane , relaying the signal from the nerve [ 33 ] .
acetylcholinesterase ( ache ) , also located on the postsynaptic membrane , terminates the signal transmission by hydrolyzing ach [ 33 , 34 ] .
our previous studies have shown that bsyz could modulate cholinergic system in ibotenic acid ( ibo ) - treated rat and scop - treated mice [ 10 , 35 ] .
in this study , we also detect the cholinergic system in samp8 mice .
results proved that bsyz could regulate cholinergic system .
the level of ach and the activity of chat increased and the activity of ache decreased in both cortex and hippocampus in bsyz groups compared with samp8 group .
synapses , established by presynaptic axonal terminals and postsynaptic dendritic spines [ 36 , 37 ] , are the specialized intercellular junctions that mediate the transmission of information between neurons .
many studies have reported that the impairment of cognitive ability , learning and memory , is associated with alternation in synaptic [ 38 , 39 ] .
postsynapticdensity 95 ( psd95 ) and synaptophysin ( syn ) reflect the distribution and density of synapses , which are closely associated with synaptic remodeling .
nerve growth factor ( ngf ) is required for synaptogenesis during neural development .
in our study , neurons were found to be impaired .
after the treatment of bsyz and don , the low expression of psd95 , syn and ngf was recovered .
meanwhile , nissl 's staining also proved the neuroprotective effect of bsyz .
these results demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of bsyz .
sirt1 has been directly implicated in neuronal protection against stress in cultured cells [ 40 ] .
in mice , sirt1 has been shown to protect against neurodegeneration in the p25 over expression model [ 41 ] , as well as in wallerian degeneration slow mice [ 42 ] .
in this study , a down - expressed sirt1 was found in samp8 mice brain , while bsyz up - regulated this .
some studies indicate that sirt1 participates in the er stress response related to inadequate nutrients uptake and its activation protects cardiomyocytes from er stress - induced cell death [ 43 ] .
activation of sirt1 in the liver of both diet - and obesity - induced t2dm mice strongly attenuated upr activation by decreasing eif2 - alpha phosphorylation , xbp - 1splicing , and chop expression [ 44 ] .
a sirt1 activator , resveratrol , could significantly restore cardiac function , reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis , and ameliorate er stress [ 45 ] .
in addition , the activation of sirt1 decreased acetylation of heat - shock factor protein 1 ( hsf1 ) to modulate the er stress in n1e115 dopaminergic cells [ 46 ] .
sirt1 attenuates endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by palmitate in hepg2 cells via induction of oxygen - regulated protein 150 ( orp150 ) [ 47 ] .
activation of sirt1 can protect cardiac cells from er stress through eukaryotic initiation factor 2 ( eif - 2a ) deacetylation [ 48 ] .
the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) is a major cellular organelle of the biosynthesis of proteins and the transport of synthesized proteins [ 12 , 13 ] .
several studies have linked er function and its stress response pathways to aging [ 12 , 49 ] .
er stress and activation of the upr has been implicated in abnormal protein processing and neuronal death in cognitive dysfunction [ 50 ] .
the unfolded protein response ( upr ) is an adaptive cellular response to the disturbance of normal er functions that attenuates the aggregation of unfolded or misfolded proteins and promotes cell survival [ 12 , 51 , 52 ] .
there are three branches of the upr that are initiated by distinct er stress sensors located on the er membrane : inositol - requiring enzyme ( ire - 1alpha ) [ 12 ] , pkr - like endoplasmic reticulum kinase ( perk ) and activating transcription factor 6 ( atf6 ) [ 12 , 53 ] .
increased p - perk and p - eif2alpha have been reported in postmortem analyses of brains from patients with neurodegenerative diseases [ 54 - 57 ] .
when prolonged or overwhelming er stress , the upr fails to restore er homoeostasis , then the apoptotic cascade is activated [ 58 , 59 ] .
in this study , high expressions of phosphorylate perk ( p - perk ) and phosphorylate ire - 1alpha ( p - ire - 1alpha ) in samp8 group indicate the occurence of er stress , accompanied with an increase of chaperones binding immunoglobulin protein ( bip ) .
bsyz and don group decrease the expressions to attenuate er stress .
perk directly phosphorylates the subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 ( eif - 2a ) , which attenuates global mrna translation to protect cells from er stress - mediated apoptosis at the initial phase of the upr [ 51 , 60 ] and the downstream protein c / ebp homologous protein ( chop ) , which indicates the apoptosis .
down - regulated proteins , chop and p - eif - 2a , were found in bsyz and don groups , which were contrary to samp8 group .
in addition , the protein disulfide isomerase ( pdi ) , a chaperone , is a part of the quality - control system ensuring correct folding of proteins [ 61 , 62 ] .
the expression of pdi increased under the administration of bsyz and don .
bax protein exerts the effect of promoting cell apoptosis , while bcl - 2 present an opposite distinct capacity of anti - apoptosis .
bax activities are regulated though their interaction with bcl - 2 family members .
in our study , the apoptotic indexes bax / bcl - 2 and cleaved caspase - 3 expressions significantly decreased after the treatment of bsyz both in hippocampus and cortex .
additionally , tunel staining showed that bsyz significantly attenuated the neuronal apoptosis in samp8 mice .
these results indicated that bsyz protects against neuronal apoptosis might be related with sirt1 / er stress pathway .
in this study , we illustrate that bsyz could ameliorate cognitive dysfunction , which might be related with sirt1 / er stress pathway .
the further mechanism is still need to study .

western blot analysis the tissues of hippocampus and cortex were homogenized and lysed in sample buffer ( 0.5 m tris / hcl ph 6.8 , 50 % glycerol , 10 % sodium dodecyl sulphate ( sds ) , 1 : 100 inhibitor proteases and phosphatases cocktail ) .
the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4degreesc and then denatured by boiling at 100degreesc with 1 : 4 lodding buffer .
the same amount of protein ( 30 mug ) was fractionated by sds - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( page ) and subsequently transferred onto a polyvinylide fluoride sheets ( pvdf ) membranes .
the membranes were blocked in 5 % skim milk that dissolved in tris - bufferedsaline - tween - 20 ( tbst ) for 1 h at room temperature .
the membranes containing the protein were incubated with anti - sirt1 , anti - perk , anti - p - perk , anti - ire - 1alpha , anti - p - ire - 1alpha , anti - eif - 2alpha , anti - p - eif - 2alpha , anti - bip , anti - pdi , anti - chop , anti - caspase - 3 , anti - bcl - 2 , anti - syn , anti - psd95 , anti - bax , anti - ngf and mouse anti - beta - actin overnight at 4degreesc .
then the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti - rabbit or anti - mouse for 1 h at room temperature .
routinely , protein load was monitored by using a super enhanced chemiluminescence reagent ( ecl ; applygen technologies inc. , beijing , china ) .
tunel staining brain paraffin sections were washed in xylene and rehydrated through a graded series of ethanol and double distilled water .
then , the sections were washed in pbs and incubated with 50 mul tunel reaction mixture for 1 h at 37degreesc in dark .
further incubation with 50 mul converter - pod was performed at 37degreesc for 30 min .
the sections were then rinsed with pbs and stained with dab substrate for 10 min at room temperature .
tunel staining was performed using the in situ cell death detection kit ( roche diagnostics gmbh , mannheim , germany ) .
images were analyzed by using a light microscope and leica qwin plus ( leica microsystems , wetzlar , germany ) .
statistical analysis experimental values were given as means +/ - s.e.m. all statistical analysis was performed with spss 19.0 statistical software ( ibm , endicott , ny ) .
two - way analysis of variance ( anova ) was applied to analyze differences in data for the biochemical parameters among the different groups , followed by dunnett 's significant post - hoc test for pair - wise multiple comparisons .
the level of statistical significance for all tests was p < 0.05 .

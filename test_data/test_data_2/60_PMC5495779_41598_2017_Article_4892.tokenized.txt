transportation networks are one of the fundamental tools for human society to work , more so in our globalized world .
the importance of a correct , efficient design of a transportation network for a given region or country cannot be overstated .
we here study how network design is affected by the geography of the towns or nuclei to be connected , and also by the decision process necessary to choose which connections should be improved ( in a generic sense ) first .
we begin by establishing that delaunay networks provide an efficient starting point for the network design and at the same time allow us to introduce a computationally amenable model .
subsequent improvements lead to decentralized designs in geographies where towns are more or less homogeneously distributed , whereas radial designs arise when there is a core - periphery distribution of nodes .
we also show that optimization of delaunay networks outperforms that of complete networks at a lower cost , by allowing for a proper selection of the links to improve .
in closing , we draw conclusions relevant to policy making applied to designing transportation networks and point our how our study can be useful to identify mechanisms relevant to the historical development of a region .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction in spite of having received much attention in fields such as mathematics or sociology , particularly building on the pioneering work of erdos and renyi1 , 2 , the concept of complex network has become ubiquitous in many sciences and applied fields after the models introduced by watts and strogatz3 and by barabasi and albert4 .
the subsequent surge of activity , triggered by those two papers , has brought the physics' community to lead the research effort in the study of networks , fostered by increased computing power and the availability of large databases of real networks5 .
studies have focused on a huge variety of systems including transportation networks , phone call networks , the internet and the world wide web , the actors' coappearance network in movie databases , scientific coauthorship , citation and collaboration networks as well as systems of interest in biology and medicine , such as neural networks , ecological networks or genetic , metabolic and protein networks6 .
during the first decade of the 2000s , the newly arrived science of complex networks has focused mainly on topological properties such as connectivity , clustering , centrality , community or modular structure , etc. , trying to connect those features with the behavior of the systems under consideration and their dynamics .
however , in recent years it has been realized that it is often necessary to consider the networked systems as being embedded in some underlying , possibly metric space7 .
one evident instance of this issue arises from spatial networks , where the constituent entities can be analyzed by forming a network in which links are defined by direct connections on the corresponding level of description .
in that context , it is clear that the cost of establishing a new link is not the same for all cities , as it crucially depends on their distance , measured in the underlying space in between .
similarly , other properties of the network may depend on the metrics as well .
it is worth mentioning that , in fact , quantitative geography has studied similar problems since almost 50 years ago8 and nowadays topics such as human mobility , design and planning of transportation networks , or city structure are being abundantly studied from interdisciplinary perspectives based on a spatial network approach9 , 10 .
among spatial networks , transportation networks are particularly important , in so far as they govern key aspects of our society and are relevant to the understanding of many problems , such as disease spread , congestion , urban sprawl , and the structure of cities11 .
the viewpoint we adopt in this paper contributes to the research on network growth and , more specifically , on network improvement , seeing modifications to the network as the result of rational decisions by relevant actors in response to market conditions and policy initiatives12 , 13 .
the question of network development and , in particular , its evolutionary nature , has been frequently overlooked by transportation planners and engineering , and understanding this issue is crucial given the enormous investments involved in this process .
indeed , effective investments and operations on infrastructure networks shapes the priorities for economic development of many regions and nations , and finding adequate plans and responses is a challenge for transportation policy - makers and professionals .
it has been argued that top - down decision - making processes do not take properly into account the interconnected and interdependent nature of current transportation systems , and may lead to socially and economically undesirable outcomes .
on the other hand , individual decisions and actions could eventually accumulate into development processes which are both path dependent and unpredictable .
our research intends to shed light on how different decision making procedures interplay with the geography and the pre - existing network and what are the corresponding outcomes at the level of the connected entities .
methods as stated above , the aim of this paper is to study how transportation networks evolve under different decision - making processes and starting from different geographies and types of connection network .
we discuss below how we deal with each one of these aspects .
for the convenience of the reader , we include in fig. 1 a flow chart of our model so the integration of each of the aspects discussed below can be easily assessed .
figure 1 flow chart of our model , showing the integration of the differerent features .
geography the first ingredient of our approach is a given geography of the region or country under consideration , understood as the positions of the population centers ( towns , cities , villages ) the network connects .
to be sure , there is an infinite number of geographies one can consider , each with its own specific features and particular problems .
however , in the spirit of addressing general problems , we focus on the differences between countries where the population concentrates in the periphery as compared with those in which the population is more uniformly distributed through the territory .
very roughly speaking , the former case would resemble a country like spain or the united states , whereas the latter one would be similar to germany , for instance .
in addition , we will consider the effect of having a central hub and also the effect of having more or less towns .
to this end we will use the following basic systems : a set of towns located on a circle , on two circles , with or without a town in a geographically centered position , or else a set of towns randomly scattered in the region under consideration .
examples of these basic configurations are shown on fig. 2. figure 2 representative examples of the different geographical distributions considered .
( a ) circunference setup .
this corresponds to the case of an island whose center is difficult to access , so communications take place along the coast such as , e.g. , iceland .
( b ) circunference and central point setup .
regions with a large part of the population leaving in the periphery and in a central town .
( c ) double circunference and central point setup .
as in ( b ) , but with a belt of intermediate towns between the center and the periphery , typically less populated thanthe others .
( b and c ) exemplify countries such as france or spain , while choosing ( b or c ) for the description depends on the relevance ( actual or modeled ) of the intermediate towns .
( d ) random setup .
towns are uniformly distributed in the considered region , such as in , e.g. , germany , where such a distribution arises from a history of small kingdoms that became integrated only recently .
pre - existing network as we have already stated , the purpose of our research is to understand how to improve an already existing transportation network .
in this respect , it is important to note that this is a very general approach to the problem .
communication or transportation networks exist since many centuries ago .
in ancient times , when the first societies started to appear , there were paths between neighboring villages , possibly used only by people on foot or on horseback , but they were bona fide paths .
later road or railway networks , from the roman empire road network to the current highways , can then be considered as improvements on that first set of paths ( notice that the new connection needs not lay exactly on top of the previous one , it should just link the same two cities ) .
therefore , we will look at how transportation networks change , in the understanding that this allows us to understand the status of the network at very many different moments in history just by changing the choice of pre - existing network. with the goal stated in the previous paragraph in mind , once we adopt a specific geography from those presented in the previous subsection , we need to specify the current state of the connections among towns .
in choosing models for those , we restricted ourselves to two connected networks : the complete network , i.e. , there is a direct connection bewteen any two nodes ( which may be more realistically associated to large towns connected by direct flights , but could in principle correspond to any mode of transport ) , and a delaunay network .
a delaunay triangulation14 for a set of points in a plane is a connected network such that no point in the set is inside the circumcircle of any triangle in the network .
in this way , the resulting network maximizes the minimum angle of all the angles of the network triangles , leading to less obtuse forms .
it is interesting to note that the dual graph15 of the delaunay triangulation is a voronoi graph16 .
delaunay networks are appropriate for the purposes of modeling a pre - existing transportation network , which in this case could be thought of as formed by roads or railroads , because another of its properties is that it contains the nearest neighbor graph as a subgraph , meaning that there are direct links from any town to its closest neighboring one .
furthermore , it can be seen17 that the maximum distance between two nodes following paths on a delaunay network is at most twice the distance as the bird flies , while in actual geographical terms is much smaller , between 1.05 and 1.0918 .
to implement the delaunay network , we used the built - in matlab19 command delaunay .
in the next section , we will see that , in fact , delaunay networks are indeed a good representation of efficient transportation networks .
an additional comments is in order here regarding our choice of pre - existing networks .
first , it could be argued that another suitable starting point would be a minimum spanning tree ( mst ) 20 .
however , msts are not very good models for transportation networks because they lack redundancy by definition ( trees have no cycles ) and are highly inefficient in terms of total transportation costs .
although mst are extremely efficient in terms of construction costs , they are much less efficient in terms of transportation time , as it may well be the case that two nodes that are very close geographically end up having to travel a very long path to reach each other .
a limited increase in redundancy , along with a few extra links , may lead to a substantial decrease in transportation time and to an increase in the network resilience against problems in any of its links , while very moderately increasing the constructions costs .
on the other hand , msts are very sensitive to geographical changes : adding one node to the system or displacing one may lead to drastic changes in the new mst .
therefore , we do not consider this option here for its lack of applicability .
decision - making processes in this work , we focus on the case in which decisions are taken by an external agent ( government department , transport authority , etc ) who tries to improve a pre - existing network by considering and balancing the interests of the different actors , in our case , the towns to be connected .
it is important to understand this point because , as we will now define , decisions will be taken by an apparently " democratic " procedure , but this is not actual voting but rather the manner in which the external decision - maker weighs in the different characteristics of the town and the gains in network efficiency .
therefore , the alternative to our model would not be an external decision - making , but an external decision - making that uses other criteria for her choices ( such as promoting a specific town , or a specific region ) .
in the above spirit , we complete our approach to the evolution of the transportation network by considering the case in which at every time step a particular link of the network is chosen and an investment is allocated to its improvement , leading to a reduction of the time needed to travel it by a factor of 75 % .
for the decision - making processes , i.e. , for the procedure to choose links , we will restrict ourselves to bottom - up approaches ( which , however , could also be seen as top - down if the decision - makers considered criteria based on the population distribution to choose the parts of the network to be improved ) and , specifically , to the following ones , that touch upon different aspects of the weighting of towns and their main goal : decision - making process type i : each town has one vote on the link to be improved .
the aim of this rule is to reduce the total cost of travels .
connections have a weight proportional to travel time .
decision - making process type ii : each town has one vote , weighted by its population , on the link to be improved .
the aim here is to reduce the total cost in terms of the mean time spent by the population in traveling .
connections have a weight proportional to travel time .
decision - making process type iii : each town has one vote , weighted by its population .
the goal is different in this case , the rule attempts to increase total traffic .
traffic is determined by a gravitational model21 that is proportionally to the size of the connected nodes and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them ( measured in time ) .
when travel time is decreased by the connection improvement , the traffic is increased .
this procedure puts more weight on connections with relevant nodes , be it by proximity or by population .
in our model , the vote of each town is decided based on its own optimal choices , as determined by the minimal spanning tree originating from them .
the minimal spanning tree for the towns is determined by using the dijkstra algorithm22 , 23 .
results efficiency : delaunay triangulation vs complete networks the first step in our research program is to establish the efficiency of delaunay triangulations as an underlying transportation network among a set of cities .
this is due to the fact that we are considering improving a pre - existing network , and there are a number of reasons why using a complete network as a starting point is less suitable .
indeed , the number of links agents must consider in order to find their optimal link to improve grows much faster in complete networks than in delaunay networks , to the point that it becomes impractical or even impossible when the number is sufficiently large .
in addition , if the number of links that can be improved is too large , the possibilities that the agents reach a consensus decrease accordingly .
in fact , the existence of all one - to - one direct links favors a dispersion in the votes , leading very often to situations in which there are as many candidates for improvement as nodes .
while this problem becomes less serious when new links are created , as nodes may prefer indirect paths that benefit from the improvements , it is is very sensitive to the initial configuration ( path dependence ) that is quite random due to the lack of consensus .
thus , in terms of modeling difficulties , it is clear that if the pre - existing network is a complete one , the required computing power is much larger , as all connections among towns are now eligible to be improved .
in addition , in this case the variablity of the link length is much larger , and can include links whose improving cost is beyond the whole budget for improving the network .
it is then clear that reaching any kind of consensus among the towns , to decide on which connection should be improved , would be almost impossible .
this is not the case when using a triangulation as underlying network , as then most links are similar in length and improving cost .
however , and more importantly , as we will now see , the complete network is also not a very efficient network in terms of construction costs and therefore it is not a good choice in our modeling procedure .
in what follows , we will consider that a network is efficient if it provides a transportation service similar to that of a complete network , but at a lower construction cost , i.e. , with less connections between cities .
in this respect , prior to the improvement process , delaunay networks are much more efficient than complete networks .
indeed , as can be seen in fig. 3 the total costs of transport , measured in terms of the average time it takes to travel between two destinations , are somewhat larger for the delaunay system , but they are strongly compensated by a much smaller construction cost ( note that in the complete network all n ( n - 1 )/ 2 links have to be built ) .
in a delaunay network , its size depends basically on the number of nodes to connect and not on their specific geographical location , contrary to the situation in a complete network .
in fact , delaunay networks turn out to be more efficient because many links belong to many different trajectories .

node configurations : circunference ( magenta ) , circunference with a center ( red ) , double circunference with a center ( black ) and random ( blue ) .
smaller symbols correspond to individual realizations , larger symbols to the mean for each case ( preexisting network / geographical distribution ) .
when we now turn to the dynamic evolution of the transportation system by iterated single - link improvements , we find that complete networks only perform better for the first few modifications , but subsequently the co - utilization of links in the delaunay networks mentioned earlier makes them perform better .
figure 4 shows that this is the case for different numbers of nodes , while we have found that their distribution does not lead to significant differences .
generally speaking , the improved links are shorter in the delaunay network , leading to lower costs .
on the other hand , it can be seen from the plot that total transportation costs for systems with 9 nodes are different than those of 12 and 25 nodes .
the reason for this result is that the larger the number of nodes , the more links have to be improved for the delaunay network to have more efficiency .
it is clear that when no links are improved the complete network is necessarily more efficient than the delaunay one , and subsequently plots always cross each other .

filled symbols : complete network .
the decision - making process is of type i ( one town , one vote ). of course , other triangulation schemes could have led to similar results .
the fact that we have chosen the delaunay algorithm in this work is due to a number of competitive advantages with respect to alternative triangulations .
thus , delaunay triangles have their angles as similar as possible , implying more efficiency in so far as with a minimum number of links a larger surface is connected .
this , along with the fact that the typical number of links a node has is about 6 , implies in turn that angles are close to 60degrees .
interestingly , if one looks to the examples of france or spain , there is a clearly visible hexagonal structure in the road system , highly resemblant of a structure generated by delaunay process .
dynamics let us now focus on the results from a more general viewpoint .
our thorough computational study allows us to look into the different factors shaping up transportation networks and assess their effects .
our starting point is the choice of decision - making process .
as shown in fig. 5 , it turns out that for processes i and ii the improvement of the transportation network leads to decreasing gains , while for process iii we observe that the initial decrease is slower than in the other two cases , although the curve finally saturates in values around what arises from the other two decision - making algorithms .
this occurs because process iii leads to work on short links between close nodes that have a lot of traffic , while contributing less to global improvements .
in all the geographies considered in the present work , the general result of the different decision - making processes is qualitatively the same .

the decision - making process is of type i ( one town , one vote ; triangles ) , type ii ( weighted by population , squares ) and type iii ( weighted by traffic , circles ) .
on the other hand , geography does have a clear effect on cost considerations .
the transportation network shows lower costs for the case of uniform and double circumference maps , two situations that have very similar costs .
costs increase subsequently in the case of a circumference with a central node , while the single circumference turns out to be the most expensive as can be observed from fig. 6. figure 6 total transportation costs for a region with 12 towns for the two types of connecting networks considered , the four geographical distributions and the three decision - making processes .

node configurations : circunference ( magenta ) , circunference with a center ( red ) , double circunference with a center ( black ) and random ( blue ) .
the decision - making process is of type i ( one town , one vote ). of course , the dynamical evolution of the transportation network arising from the sequential decision process we are analyzing here leads to changes in the centrality of the different nodes .
in this respect , it is important to keep in mind that centrality is a non local property , in so far as it dependes on the position of the node in the network but also on the connections among other networks .
our approach in this paper allows us to look into this issue from a global viewpoint , accounting correctly for the changes in centrality and beyond what is usually the case in economic studies .
in fact , most research carried out from the viewpoint of economics focuses on degree centrality , a local quantity , precisely because its locality makes it very visible for the general public ; however , a more rigorous approach should be based on the betweenness centrality as intermediation effects are important for the whole network .
to illustrate the different effects , fig. 7 shows how centrality is distributed among the network nodes .
the first improvement leads to a node with very large centrality , but as the process advances centrality becomes more and more equally distributed as measured by the gini index of the centrality distribution .
this phenomenon is observed for all three decision - making processes .
if we now consider the betweenness centrality , the behavior is different : the values of the magnitude become less concentrated initially , but inequality increases after an intermediate number of improvements , for which the distribution of centrality is the most equitable one .
in this case , decision - making processes of type iii lead to oscillations in the gini index which are not observed in the other two systems .

the decision - making process is of type i ( one town , one vote ; triangles ) , type ii ( weighted by population , squares ) and type iii ( weighted by traffic , circles ) .

discussion in this paper , we have presented a novel approach to understanding how transportation networks arise and can be improved by means of sequential decision processes .
this is a much more realistic approach than those based on global optimizations , which usually lead to non local prescriptions involving several links that , on the other hand , may require resources beyond the budgets typically available to institutions to improve transport .
another difficulty of a global procedure ( or a sequential procedure based on a complete network ) is that in practice it would be almost impossible to make substantiated decisions as to which connections should be improved. of course , it goes without saying that sequential processes have the drawback that they may lead to suboptimal behavior ; however , the cost of globally optimizing a network involving many nodes makes the task prohibitively expensive even if restricted to delaunay networks .
in addition , failure to complete the designed network from a global viewpoint may lead to gross inefficiencies and equally suboptimal networks .
therefore , sequential decision processes are an important object of study .
we stress that we are looking here at a specific decision procedure in which nodes vote one option only to improve in the next round .
having the option of voting for several options might have an effect ( more on complete networks than on delaunay ones ) but we do not believe it is going to lead to qualitative changes and , in any event , it can be easily incorporated to the model .
the results presented in the paper are examples supporting these conclusions , but we have carried out a much more thorough study involving all combinations of the ingredients of the model , other geographical distributions and perturbations of specific distributions by modifying the positions or the populations of one node .
the results of this study are available in a dedicated website24 ( where evolution is relevant , the plots in the website show movies of the network development as a function of time ) and fully confirm the robustness of the conclusions above .
one of the most relevant conclusions of this work is that decentralized designs tend to be more efficient when the geography consists of homogeneously distributed nodes , while radial designs perform better when the important nodes are in the periphery without a specially relevant central node .
dynamically , a center - periphery layout tends to be more advantageous , although when many improvements are carried out the centralized and decentralized designs become more similar .
it is interesting to realize that when decisions are decentralized , the lack of regional coordination may lead to absence of investments in densely populated regions , which calls for a multilevel decision process that incorporates the structure at different scales in an appropriate manner .
figure 8 illustrates this by showing an snapshot , after a sizable number of improvements have been made , for the four geographical distributions we are considering .
figure 8 snapshot of the network of improved connections among 15 towns after 18 iterations in the four geographical distributions considered starting from a delaunay network and the type i decision process .
distributed decision systems turn out to favor big investments , with large benefits in the form of long links that join different parts of the geography .
smaller investments with a high benefit / cost ratio but focused on a local scale are selected against , as agents value them according to the individual benefit and only a few agents have something to win from locally relevant links .
it is also the case that when two important nodes are close in the geography they share investment decisions about far away links , while if there are more than two relevant nodes the competition among them may facilitate more drastic changes in the network improvement process .
in any event , all these points make it clear that the discussion typically held in many countries about the convenience and efficiency of a centralized vs a decentralized transportation network is not the correct one to pose .
any consideration of this issue is highly conditioned by the budget available to improve the networks and by the geography , including population density .
in this respect , another relevant conclusion of our work is that sequential improvement of a preexisting transportation network , based on efficiency criteria does not change much the most important centrality , the betweenness / intermediation one , and its effects concentrate on the more visible , local , degree centrality .
this means that if the goal of an improvement policy is to equilibrate the differences between nodes in terms of their intermediation capabilities , the choices of the connections to work on should be guided by criteria different than pure efficiency and include this idea of achieving a level - playing field .
the scale at which one looks at the problem is also an important point , and the optimal network for a given region changes drastically if it seen on its own or included at different levels in a country or a continent .
we believe that the approach we have presented here , based on considering a pre - existing network well described by a delaunay triangulation , may be very useful for policy - making consideration of different alternatives .
finally , it is interesting to note that our approach can also be very valuable in connection with historical research .
when available data allow to track the time evolution of a transportation network ( see , e.g. , ref .
25 ) , our model could be used to check which decision - making processes ( the ones we are considering here or even others ) are compatible with the historical development .
we thus believe that this paper would stimulate further work using our tools in different fields and directions .

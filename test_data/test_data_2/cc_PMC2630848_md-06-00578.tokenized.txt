acetylcholinesterase - inhibiting activity of marinoquinoline a ( 1 ) , a new pyrroloquinoline from a novel species of a marine gliding bacterium rapidithrix thailandica , was assessed ( ic50 4.9 mum ) .
two related pyrrole derivatives , 3 - ( 2 ' - aminophenyl ) - pyrrole ( 3 ) and 2,2 - dimethyl - pyrrolo - 1,2 - dihydroquinoline ( 4 ) , were also isolated from two other strains of r. thailandica .
the isolation of 3 from a natural source is reported here for the first time .
compound 4 was proposed to be an isolation artifact derived from 3 .
the two isolated compounds were virtually inactive in the acetylcholinesterase - inhibitory assay ( enzyme inhibition < 30 % at 0.1 g l - 1 ) .
pyrroloquinolines phenylpyrroles gliding bacteria rapidithrix thailandica acetylcholinesterase inhibitors 1 .
introduction one of the most important roles of acetylcholine in the brain is to govern the connectivity among neurons , thereby regulating the brain 's cognitive functions .
a deficit in acetylcholine , especially in the basal forebrains , is a neurochemical characteristic of patients clinically diagnosed with alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) .
using acetylcholinesterase ( ache ) inhibitors to retard the catabolic hydrolysis of acetylcholine , therefore compensating such deficiency particularly at the synaptic terminals , has been suggested as one of the most direct remedies for ad treatment .
to date , only three ache inhibitors ; donepezil , rivastigmine , and galantamine , have been approved by us fda for the treatment of ad. whereas it is arguable whether such drugs provide a long - term treatment or are merely a symptom intervention , they are one of only a few effective approaches available for the treatment of ad [ 1,2 ] .
recently , we reported the isolation and structure elucidation of marinoquinoline a ( 1 ) , a new alkaloid possessing an unprecedented pyrrolo [ 2,3 - c ] quinoline skeleton from a novel marine gliding bacterium rapidithrix thailandica [ 3,4 ] .
the structural similarity between 1 and tacrine ( 2 ) , a potent ache inhibitor , prompted us to subject the compound to the ache inhibiting assay , as well as to search for additional pyrrole / pyrroloquinoline derivatives from the bacterium .
here , the isolation and structure determination of the phenylpyrrole analogs of 1 will be reported , along with the ache - inhibiting activity of 1 and related compounds .
2. results and discussion marinoquinoline a ( 1 ) was obtained from the gliding bacterium r. thailandica tistr 1742 as reported earlier [ 3 ] .
given the close resemblance between 1 and 2 , we speculated that 1 might bind to the enzyme ache in a manner similar to that of 2 .
consequently , 1 was assayed against ache using torpedo californica ache .
as expected , the compound exhibited a strong inhibition with an ic50 of 4.9 +/ - 0.9 mum ( referred to standard galantamine , ic50 0.6 +/ - 0.1 mum ) with no appreciable cytotoxicity against the panel of cancer cell lines (> 80 % cell viability at 20 mum ) .
based on the promising results , two other strains of r. thailandica were selected for the chemical investigation in an effort to discover related pyrrole / pyrroloquinoline derivatives .
the gliding bacterial strains tistr 1749 and sh5.13.2 were separately isolated from a submerged sea grass blade collected from fossil shell beach park , krabi province , and from debris collected from koh - kham , chonburi province , respectively .
the 16s rdna analysis of the bacterial isolates suggested that they were identical to each other .
the blast search with the 16s rdna gene sequences in genbank database indicated that both strains belonged to the gliding bacterium r. thailandica , gen .
nov. , sp. nov .
( family flammeovirgaceae ) , with 99 % similarity in gene sequences to the type strain tistr 1750t [ 4 ] .
the large scale fermentations of strains tistr 1749 and sh5.13.2 were carried out in skim milk and cy media , respectively .
amberlite xad - 16 , added to the fermentation broths of each strain , was harvested and eluted with meoh , and each extract was subjected to the further chromatographic separation .
extract from the strain tistr 1749 yielded 3 and 4 , whereas that of sh5.13.2 yielded 3 as the main product .
compound 3 possesses a molecular formula of c10h10n2 according to the molecular ion signal at m / z 158 observable in the ei mass spectrum .
this was confirmed by the high resolution mass of 158.0852 ( ei ; calc for c10h10n2 158.0842 ) .
the 1h nmr spectrum ( 500 mhz , dmso - d6 , table 1 ) showed nine resonances , seven of which belonged to two aromatic spin systems , while the other two were exchangeable proton signals .
the first aromatic spin system , resonating at delta 6.55 ( ddd , j = 7.5 , 7.3 , 1.3 hz ; h - 5 ') , 6.69 ( dd , j = 7.9 , 1.3 hz ; h - 3 ') , 6.88 ( ddd , j = 7.9 , 7.3 , 1.3 hz ; h - 4 ') , and 7.10 ( dd , j = 7.5 , 1.5 hz ; h - 6 ') , was characteristic to a 1,2 - disubstituted benzene ring .
another spin system was elucidated as 3 - substituted pyrrole moiety according to the characteristic proton signals at delta 6.25 ( ddd , j = 2.5 , 2.3 , < 1 hz ; h - 4 ) , 6.83 ( ddd , j = 2.5 , 2.3 , 2.3 hz ; h - 5 ) , and 6.96 ( ddd , j = 2.3 , 2.3 , < 1hz ; h - 2 ) .
this agreed well with the observation of the low - fielded exchangeable proton at delta 10.90 ( br s ) , typically assigned to h - 1 of pyrrole .
the connection of the two aromatic rings was achieved via the hmbc long - range correlation from c - 3 to h - 6 ' .
the presence of a primary amino group was deduced from the characteristic ir absorption band at numax 3400 cm - 1 , and from the exchangeable proton resonance at delta 4.70 ( br s , 2h ; 2 ' - nh2 ) .
attachment of the amino group onto c - 2 ' ( delta 144.8 ) of the phenyl ring furnished the structure of 3 as 3 - ( 2 ' - aminophenyl ) - pyrrole .
the noe between each pair of protons along the circumference of the structure , i.e. , h - 1 < - - > h - 2 < - - > 2 ' - nh2 < - - > h - 3 ' < - - > h - 4 ' < - - > h - 5 ' < - - > h - 6 ' < - - > h - 4 < - - > h - 5 < - - > h - 1 , strongly supported the proposed structure .
the structure of 3 has been proposed as one of theoretical biosynthetic intermediates of the antibiotic pyrronitrin ( 5 ) [ 5 - 7 ] , previously reported from several pseudomonads and related bacteria [ 5,8 - 10 ] .
this hypothesis was challenged in a recent report by kirner et al [ 11 ] , who suggested that 3 was in fact either a side product or biosynthetic dead - end of 5 .
in either case , however , 3 has never been actually isolated from any natural sources .
the molecular formula of 4 was proposed to be c13h14n2 as deduced from the high resolution mass at m / z 198.1122 in the hr - ei mass spectrum ( calc for c13h14n2 198.1154 ). from the 1h nmr spectrum ( 500 mhz , dmso - d6 , table 2 ) , seven proton resonances characteristic of a 1,2 - disubstituted benzene ( delta 6.45 , ddd , j = 7.7 , 7.5 , 1.0 hz , h - 7 ; 6.50 , dd , j = 7.9 , 1.0 hz , h - 9 ; 6.73 , ddd , j = 7.9 , 7.7 , 1.3 hz , h - 8 ; and 7.08 , dd , j = 7.5 , 1.3 hz , h - 6 ) and of a 2,3 - disubstituted pyrrole ( delta 6.20 , dd , j = 2.6 , 2.4 hz , h - 5 ; 6.64 , dd , j = 2.8 , 2.6 hz , h - 4 ; and 10.74 , br s , h - 1 ) suggested that 3 and 4 were closely related .
the 40 mass units higher than that of 3 , and the additional nmr signals , which include those of a quarternary carbon at delta 52.1 ( c - 2 ) and two geminal methyl at deltah 1.42 ( s , 6h ; 2 - ch3 ) and deltac 30.6 ( 2c ) , indicated that 4 was a dimethyl dihydroquinoline analog of 3 .
the structure of 4 was therefore proposed as 2,2 - dimethyl - pyrrolo - 1,2 - dihydroquinoline .
also , similar to 3 , a network of noes along the circumference of the structure was observed , which strongly supported the proposed structure of 4 .
whereas the fermentation broth of strain tirtr 1749 led to the isolation of two major components , that of sh5.13.2 primarily yielded only 3 .
the difference in the chemical compositions between the two strains raised the questions whether 4 was genuinely produced by r. thailandica tistr 1749 or whether the compound was in fact an isolation artifact .
careful examination of the 1h nmr spectra of the meoh extract and subsequent fractions showed that only after the first chromatographic step , in which acetone was extensively used , were all the resonances related to 4 , especially the prominent methyl signal , observable .
this suggested that 4 was potentially an artifact , presumably generated from sio2 - catalyzed pictet - spengler reaction between 3 and acetone .
this was also supported by the absence of 4 in the extract from strain sh5.13.2 , where acetone was avoided .
the ache inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity of 3 and 4 were assessed .
surprisingly , both were inactive in the ache inhibition and in the cytotoxicity bioassays ( enzyme inhibition < 30 % at 0.1 g l - 1 ; > 80 % cell viability at 20 g l - 1 , respectively ) .
despite sharing a related skeleton , the three compounds exhibited different activities .
it is proposed here that the binding behavior to ache of the pyrroloquinolines may relate to the extended aromaticity of the quinoline moiety of 2 , which may have pi , pi - interaction in the gorge of ache [ 12,13 ] .
in summary , we have demonstrated the potential of 1 as a new and potent ache inhibitor .
the investigation of two other strains of the novel marine gliding bacterium r. thailandica also led to the isolation of pyrrole derivatives , 3 and 4 .
although 4 was suggested here as a possible isolation artifact generated from the condensation between 3 and acetone , the structures of the two isolated compounds have nonetheless never been reported from any natural and wild - type bioresources .
in addition , without any intermediates related to 5 observable in the extract , the isolation of 3 as a major component from the marine gliding bacterium confirms the previous conclusion contributed in [ 11 ] that , unless produced from otherwise entirely different biosynthetic pathway , 3 ( and presumably 1 ) can be presumed as a biosynthetic dead - end branched from that of 5 , which are commonly found in several terrestrial bacteria .
3. experimental 3.1 .
general unless stated otherwise , all chemicals , chromatographic solvents , and media were used as purchased .
sea water for all media preparation was filtered through cotton plug before used .
the classical chromatographic separations were all performed using sio2 ( scharlau ( r ) , 230 - 400 mesh ) , whereas the size - exclusion one was operated on a sephadex lh20 ( ge helathcare ( r )) column .
preparative hplc was performed on a water ( r ) 600e multisolvent delivery system , which was connected to a water ( r ) 484 uv detector , and a rheodyne ( r ) 7125 injector port .
ir spectra were obtained from a jasco ir - 810 infrared spectrometer .
uv spectra were measured on a spectronic genesys 5 spectrometer .
mass spectra were operated on a micromass lct mass spectrometer .
the nmr experiments were performed on a 500 - mhz ft - nmr varian unity inova 500 spectrometer , and were all referenced to the solvent signals ( dmso - d6 ; delta 2.49 of trace c2d5hso for 1h ; delta 39.7 for 13c ) as the internal standard .
3.2 .
bacterial isolation and purification the gliding bacteria tistr 1749 and sh5.13.2 were isolated from a submerged sea grass blade collected from fossil shell beach park , krabi province , and from debris collected from koh - kham , chonburi province , respectively .
for each isolate , a small piece of the collected specimen was cut and allowed to stand at an ambient temperature on a petri dish of either swg medium ( for tistr 1749 ) containing ( g l - 1 of sea water ) monosodium l - glutamate ( 1 ) , nh4no3 ( 0.01 ) , k2hpo4 ( 0.01 ) , agar ( 15 ) [ 14 ] ; or a crystal violet - supplemented ( 1 g l - 1 ) swg medium ( for sh5.13.2 ) [ modified from 15 ] .
once swarm colonies were observed , a cut piece of agar medium bearing one clean edge of each colony was transferred to a new subculture plate of sap2 solid medium , containing ( g l - 1 of sea water ) tryptone ( 1 ) and agar ( 15 ) [ 14 , modified from 16 ] .
the pure culture of the strain tistr 1749 was obtained by means of micromanipulation technique [ 3,14 ] , whereas that of sh5.13.2 was via repeated subculturing on sap2 medium at ambient temperature .
the reference culture of the strain tistr 1749 was lodged at the culture collection of thailand institute of scientific and technological research , pathum - thani , thailand , and that of sh5.13.2 was at the marine biotechnology laboratory , department of industrial biotechnology , faculty of agro - industry , prince of songkla university , songkhla , thailand .
3.3 .
taxonomic identification the taxonomic identification of both strains was based on the 16s rdna analysis , performed as described in [ 3,14 ] .
in brief , the 16s rdna was amplified by pcr technique using the 16s rdna universal primers bf1 and br1 .
the purification of the pcr products was carried out using gfx pcr dna and gel band purification kit ( amersham ( r )) .
sequencing reaction was performed using the abi prism bigdye terminator cycle sequencing kit ( applied biosystem ( r )) .
sequencing was edited and assembled using the bioedit program [ 17 ] and partial 16s rdna sequences were compared with those available in the dna databases using the blastn algorithm for close evolutionary relatives .
the complete 16s rdna sequences determined for representative strains of each group were aligned with the sequences of reference organisms derived from the database using the clustalx 1.8 .
3.4 .
large scale fermentation the medium for pre - culture and large - scale production of each strain of the gliding bacteria was as followed ; sap2 liquid medium ( g l - 1 of sea water ) containing tryptone ( 1 ) , yeast extract ( 1 ) [ 14 , modified from 16 ] ; cy medium ( g l - 1 of sea water ) containing casitone ( 10 ) , malt extract ( 2 ) , yeast extract ( 1 ) [ modified from 18 ] ; skim milk medium ( g l - 1 of sea water ) containing skim milk powder ( 5 ) , yeast extract ( 3 ) [ modified from 19 ] .
the pre - culture of each bacterial strain was performed separately in 250 - ml flasks each containing 30 ml of sap2 liquid medium ( 72 h , 25degreesc , 200 rev min - 1 ) .
a 5 - ml portion of the pre - culture broth from each strain was then separately transferred into a 250 - ml flask ( x80 ) of 100 - ml production medium as stated accordingly .
an in promptu extraction was carried out using amberlite xad - 16 resins ( 2 g per 100 ml medium ) , added prior to sterilizing of each aforementioned production medium .
after a 7 - day incubation ( 25degreesc , 200 rev min - 1 ) , the resin beads from each strain were separately harvested via nylon mesh , rinsed with water , and extracted with meoh ( 2x100 ml ) .
3.5 .
extraction and compound isolation the isolation of 1 was as per our previous report .
the identification was performed on the basis of spectral analysis , from which all impurities were undetectable .
the meoh extract from the fermentation broth of the strain tistr 1749 was subjected to a solvent partitioning protocol to yield hexane - , ch2cl2 - , and n - buoh - extracts .
the ch2cl2 - extract , which showed prominent 1h nmr signals for phenylpyrroles , was selected for the further isolation .
the chromatography of the extract on a sio2 column ( step gradient solvents , ramping from 20 to 30 % acetone in hexane , then 5 to 50 % meoh in ch2cl2 ) , then on a sio2 hplc column ( 250x7 mm econosil ( r ) , 10 mum ; continuous gradient 5 to 35 % i - proh in hexane in 15 min , 2 ml min - 1 ; 254 nm ) yielded 3 ( 12 mg ; tr 19 min ) and 4 ( 27 mg ; tr 13 min ) .
the meoh extract from the broth of sh5.13.2 was directly chromatographed over sephadex lh20 ( meoh ) , followed by rp - c18 hplc ( 250x10 mm phenomenax ( r ) , 10 mum ; 70 % aq meoh , 5 ml min - 1 ; 210 nm ) , and 3 ( 35 mg ; tr 31 min ) was obtained .

bioactivity determination the ache inhibitory assay was conducted ( in triplicate ) according to the protocol described by ingkaninan et al [ 20 , modified from 21 ] .
to a solution of 125 mul 5,5 ' - dithiobis [ 2 - nitrobenzoic acid ] ( 3 mm ) , 25 mul acetylthiocholine iodide ( 1.5 mm ) , 50 mul tris - hcl buffer ( ph 8.0 ; 5.0 mm ) , and 25 mul of each tested compound in tris - hcl buffer was added 25 mul torpedo californica ache ( type vi - s , ec 3.1.1.7 ; 0.28 u ml - 1 ; sigma ( r )) .
the developing yellow color was measured at 405 nm over 2 min with a 5 - s interval using a ceres uv900c microplate reader ( bio - tek instrument ) .
the resulting velocity was calculated and used for the determination of the enzyme activity .
the ic50 of each compound was calculated using prism ( r ) software ( graph pad inc. ) , and was referred to the potency of standard galantamine ( ic50 0.6 +/ - 0.1 mum ) .
cytotoxicity determination was performed according to the sulphorrhodamine b assay protocol described in [ 22 ] .

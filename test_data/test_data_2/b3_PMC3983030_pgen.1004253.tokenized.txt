bdellovibrio bacteriovorus invade gram - negative bacteria in a predatory process requiring type iv pili ( t4p ) at a single invasive pole , and also glide on surfaces to locate prey .
ras - like g - protein mgla , working with mglb and romr in the deltaproteobacterium myxococcus xanthus , regulates adventurous gliding and t4p - mediated social motility at both m. xanthus cell poles .
our bioinformatic analyses suggested that the gtpase activating protein ( gap ) - encoding gene mglb was lost in bdellovibrio , but critical residues for mglabd gtp - binding are conserved .
deletion of mglabd abolished prey - invasion , but not gliding , and reduced t4p formation .
mglabd interacted with a previously uncharacterised tetratricopeptide repeat ( tpr ) domain protein bd2492 , which we show localises at the single invasive pole and is required for predation .
bd2492 and romr also interacted with cyclic - di - gmp - binding receptor cdga , required for rapid prey - invasion .
bd2492 , romrbd and cdga localize to the invasive pole and may facilitate mgla - docking .
bd2492 was encoded from an operon encoding a tamab - like secretion system .
the tama protein and romr were found , by gene deletion tests , to be essential for viability in both predatory and non - predatory modes .
control proteins , which regulate bipolar t4p - mediated social motility in swarming groups of deltaproteobacteria , have adapted in evolution to regulate the anti - social process of unipolar prey - invasion in the " lone - hunter " bdellovibrio .
thus gtp - binding proteins and cyclic - di - gmp inputs combine at a regulatory hub , turning on prey - invasion and allowing invasion and killing of bacterial pathogens and consequent predatory growth of bdellovibrio .
author summary bacterial cell polarity control is important for maintaining asymmetry of polar components such as flagella and pili .
bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a predatory deltaproteobacterium which attaches to , and invades , other bacteria using type iv pili ( t4p ) extruded from the specialised , invasive , non - flagellar pole of the cell .
it was not known how that invasive pole is specified and regulated .
here we discover that a regulatory protein - hub , including ras - gtpase - like protein mgla and cyclic - di - gmp receptor - protein cdga , control prey - invasion .
in the deltaproteobacterium , myxococcus xanthus , mgla , with mglb and romr , was found by others to regulate switching of t4p in social ' swarming ' surface motility by swapping the pole at which t4p are found .
in contrast , in b. bacteriovorus mgla regulates the process of prey - invasion and romr , which is required for surface motility regulation in myxococcus , is essential for growth and viability in bdellovibrio .
during evolution , b. bacteriovorus has lost mglb , possibly as t4p - pole - switching is not required ; pili are only required at the invasive pole .
a previously unidentified tetratricopeptide repeat ( tpr ) protein interacts with mgla and is essential for prey - invasion .
this regulatory protein hub allows prey - invasion , likely integrating cyclic - di - gmp signals , pilus assembly and tamab secretion in b. bacteriovorus .

introduction bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a small , predatory deltaproteobacterium which invades other gram - negative bacteria wherein it replicates .
bdellovibrio can encounter their prey by fast motility , driven by rotation of a single flagellum in liquid environments [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , or by slow gliding motility on solid surfaces [ 3 ] , but do not show social - or s - motility a process that is shown by other deltaproteobacteria ( discussed below ) .
in bdellovibrio invasion into the prey cell periplasm requires t4p , thus pilus - minus cells are incapable of host / prey - dependent ( hd ) growth and must be cultivated on artificial media as hi - host / prey - independent - cells [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
in flagellate hd bdellovibrio the t4p are at the non - flagellar pole and prey - invasion occurs only from that anterior pole .
on surfaces a flagellum is not present and the bdellovibrio glide bidirectionally .
both hd and hi bdellovibrio can glide and invade prey on surfaces .
our study began by examining the genetics of surface motility control in bdellovibrio .
this work led us to find that proteins known for surface motility control in a second deltaproteobacterium , myxococcus xanthus , have evolved to control predatory invasion of bacteria by bdellovibrio .
regulation of surface motility in the deltaproteobacterium m. xanthus ( which is always non - flagellate ) , has been well characterised by pioneering work of the sogaard - andersen [ 6 ] , mignot [ 7 ] , zusman [ 8 ] , hartzell [ 9 ] and kaiser [ 10 ] groups for its two types of bidirectional surface motility .
these are social ( s ) - motility , swarming movement of streams of cells using retraction of t4p at alternate poles of the cells ; and adventurous ( a ) - motility , characterised by the movement of individual cells on a surface .
a - motility ( or gliding ) , is thought to be powered by cell envelope - spanning motor - protein complexes , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , though the precise mechanism of movement is still being revealed [ 13 ] - [ 15 ] .
in m. xanthus , t4p localize to one pole at a time .
occasionally , m. xanthus cells reverse direction ; this involves a switch in the polarity of the two motility systems , including a switch in the pole at which t4p assembly occurs .
thus , m. xanthus cells can assemble t4p at both poles but at any one time , t4p are found only at one pole [ 16 ] .
recent data suggest that the four putative gliding motor - gene operons in the b. bacteriovorus hd100 genome are evolutionarily linked to those a - motility gene clusters in myxococcus [ 17 ] , with subtle distinctive absences and additions likely reflecting bdellovibrio morphology and gliding differences .
bdellovibrio exhibits a - motility on surfaces in a gliding process that does not use t4p [ 3 ] .
in this gliding , a - motility , individual bdellovibrio cells move bidirectionally , cells can follow each other along previous paths and reversals of individual cells and re - orientations are seen .
gliding may be a particularly important mechanism by which bdellovibrio explores biofilms and locates bacteria to prey upon [ 3 ] , [ 18 ] .
it is critical for hd bdellovibrio to be able to explore or leave solid surfaces by gliding ( when its flagellum cannot operate ) .
unlike other non - predatory bacteria , bdellovibrio hd cells cannot replicate outside prey without acquiring " hi mutations " to do so [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , thus without surface motility they could be trapped and starve. b. bacteriovorus gliding motility is slow , with cells moving , on average , 16 microm hr - 1 [ 3 ] compared to the 24 - 36 microm hr - 1 of myxococcus [ 21 ] .
both b. bacteriovorus and m. xanthus show reversals in gliding direction .
in myxococcus , reversals during surface motility are known , from the work of the sogaard - andersen and mignot labs , to be regulated by a ras - like gtpase , mgla , which polarises the cell during gliding [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , and gtpase - activating protein ( gap ) protein mglb , which activates the gtpase activity of mgla to inhibit cellular reversals [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
mgla is important for activation of both the a - and s - motility " engines " ( s motility engines are t4p ) , at the alternating leading pole , during bidirectional movements [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
in the absence of mgla , myxococcus is both a - and s - non - motile .
this means that mgla in m. xanthus , in conjunction with interacting partner romr , regulates the localization / pole - switching activity of both t4p and gliding engine component proteins , in this bipolar bacterium .
chemotactic signals via the frz system control cellular reversals in m. xanthus [ 22 ] via the romr response regulator ; romr receives signals from the chemosensory frz system and this modulates mgla activity [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
although romr is conserved in bdellovibrio , the genes encoding the frz apparatus are not .
bdellovibrio gliding is controlled by the bacterial secondary messenger cyclic - di - gmp .
a diguanylyl cyclase ( dgca ) mutation abolishes gliding , rendering bdellovibrio cells unable to glide out of a consumed prey cell bdelloplast on a surface , even 2 hours after making lytic pores in it [ 25 ]. the c - di - gmp receptor cdga ( gvnef - a degenerate ggdef protein ) was found to be present at the predatory pole of b. bacteriovorus and deletion of cdga slowed prey - invasion significantly , showing a link between c - di - gmp signalling and predation [ 25 ] .
whilst the b. bacteriovorus hd100 genome encodes mgla ( bd3734 ; accession : np _ 970444.1 ) , it does not encode an mglb homologue [ 23 ] .
this report caused us to ask how bipolar switching might be achieved during bdellovibrio gliding on surfaces ; and whether the non - equivalent poles of the monoflagellate bdellovibrio in liquids might correlate with an alternative role for mglabd .
here we show that mglabd is required for predatory invasion , as well as being associated with changes in gliding reversal behaviour in b. bacteriovorus , but is not required for gliding motility per se. this activity of mglabd occurs without an mglb partner , but in a cell with a romrbd homologue .
both of these latter proteins are important to the control of bipolar motility in myxobacteria .
however we show that romrbd has an essential role for growth in bdellovibrio .
we also report a previously undescribed interacting protein partner of mgla , and show that mglabd and romrbd interact with this tetratricopeptide repeat protein ( tpr ) which is also required for predation .
tpr is expressed from an operon that encodes a tamab transport system and again tama was essential for growth .
implications of this for predation and the onset of predatory growth upon prey - invasion are discussed .
whilst mglamx is involved in regulation of t4p - mediated social motility in m. xanthus , we show that mglabd is involved in bdellovibrio in the control of pilus extrusion for the process of t4p - mediated invasion of prey cells at the single predatory pole .
we show that a complex of proteins , additional to the t4p , is required at the ' biting ' pole to organise the prey - entry machinery .
results mgla is required for predatory invasion by b. bacteriovorus hd100 to investigate the role of mglabd , a deletion strategy was adopted screening for possible bdellovibrio mutants in both prey / host - dependent ( hd ) and host - independent ( hi ) growth modes .
all attempts to inactivate mgla in host / prey - dependent b. bacteriovorus hd100 were unsuccessful , despite screening many more cells than required to generate other bdellovibrio deletion strains [ 26 ] ( 364 revertants obtained from second crossover events , but no deletion mutants , from three separate conjugations ) ; suggesting that mglabd is essential for an aspect of the predatory life cycle .
three host - independent ( hi ) deltamglabd strains were obtained through sucrose - suicide counter - selection from a total of 76 screened .
when challenged with prey , deltamglabd hi b. bacteriovorus strains were unable to lyse e. coli in either a soft agar prey - lawn on the surface of ypsc plates , or in liquid culture ( figure 1a ) .
introduction of wild type mglabd by in cis complementation method ( as described previously [ 25 ]) restored predation ( figure 1b ) confirming that mglabd is essential for predatory growth .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1004253.g001 figure 1 predation and in cis complementation of b. bacteriovorus deltamgla hi strains , on e. coli prey .
( a ) predation efficiency of the deltamgla hi strain was assayed against predatory and non - predatory controls by the reduction of e. coli numbers over 48 hours .
three wild - type hi strains ( hid13 , hid26 and hid50 ) reduced e. coli numbers in liquid cultures by up to four logs ( grey region shows known natural variation in predation rate between different wild - type hi isolates ) .
the deltamgla hi strain showed no reduction in e. coli numbers , comparable to a previously - studied , non - predatory deltapila hi strain , and to e. coli with no added b. bacteriovorus .
( b ) reintroduction of the mgla orf in cis to the deltamgla hi strain in plasmid pk18 : : mgla restored predatory growth .
error bars represent 1 sd from the mean ( for predation - testing of delta bd2492 strain see figure s5 ) .
the deltamgla hi b. bacteriovorus strain could not reduce e. coli numbers in liquid culture , though this strain could still attach to the exterior of potential prey cells ( figure 2 ) .
a parallel assay showed that 43.5 % of wild - type b. bacteriovorus hi cells attached to , or had entered , e. coli prey cells after 1 hour ( figure 2a ) but no deltamgla hi strain formed prey - bdelloplasts ( bdellovibrio cause the prey to round - up into ' bdelloplast ' structures after invasion ) , even after 22 hours .
figure 2 also shows that both the deltamgla hi and deltapila hi ( deltabd1290 , which is known to lack pili and is obligately host - independent [ 4 ]) could still attach to e. coli prey cells , albeit at a lower frequency .
this suggests that pili are not a prerequisite for attachment , ( although they are required for prey - invasion [ 4 ] , [ 5 ]) , and suggests that the deltamgla hi predatory defect is not due to the inability of the bdellovibrio cell to attach to prey cells .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1004253.g002 figure 2 host - independent invasion and attachment assays of deltamgla strain and wild - type controls .
( a ) attachment assay : after 1 hour , 21.0 % of e. coli cells were attached to and invaded by wild - type bdellovibrio hi strain hid26 cells .
a further 22.5 % of e. coli cells were attached to , but not invaded by hid26 cells .
23.0 % and 17.4 % of e. coli cells were attached to by deltamgla hi and deltapila hi , respectively .
the deltamgla hi and deltapila hi strains never invaded to form bdelloplasts .
the attachment assay has the following variability : percentage points ( pp ) : wt 43.5 %+/ - 15.5 pp ; deltamgla 23.0 %+/ - 4.2 pp ; deltapila 17.4 %+/ - 7.3 pp .
( b ) invasion assay : hi wild - type bdellovibrio control hid50 was able to infect e. coli prey cells ( 26.3 % of e. coli cells invaded to form bdelloplasts after 22 hours , 45 / 171 e. coli cells ) .
bdellovibrio deltamgla hi strain could not invade e. coli prey ( 0.0 % of e. coli cells invaded to form bdelloplasts after 22 hours , 0 / 319 e. coli cells ) .
fluorescent images show representative fluorescent e.coli s17 - 1 : : pmal _ p2 - mcherry cells , either uninfected or rounded to form bdelloplasts .
the nature of the predatory defect of the deltamgla hi strain was analysed further by microscopy , using a fluorescent e.coli s17 - 1 : : pmal _ p2 - mcherry prey strain [ 27 ] .
addition of the deltamgla hi strain to e.coli s17 - 1 : : pmal _ p2 - mcherry and incubation for 22 hours demonstrated that although deltamgla hi cells could attach to the outside of a prey cell , they could not invade to form bdelloplasts ( figure 2b ) .
a wild - type hi b. bacteriovorus strain ( hid50 ) successfully invaded e. coli cells and killed them ( as shown in figure 1 ) and at the 22 hour stage was shown to have formed bdelloplasts from 26.3 % of the remaining e. coli , compared to zero bdelloplasts for the deltamgla hi strain .
thus the deletion of mglabd abolished a process required for prey - invasion .
the b. bacteriovorus mgla mutant is hypo - piliated the deltamgla hi strain showed a similar phenotype to that observed in a pilus - minus ( deltapila ) strain , which was known to be unable to invade prey cells [ 4 ] .
we hypothesised that b. bacteriovorus deltamgla might be defective in the synthesis or extrusion of pili , preventing prey cell invasion .
this seemed plausible given that mgla regulates both the pole - switching of the a - motility and type iv pilus - mediated s - motility systems in m. xanthus .
transmission electron microscopy of hi bdellovibrio cultures grown to an od600 of 0.2 - 0.3 showed that a wild type hi control had pili in 14.3 % of cells , whilst deltamgla hi had pili in only 2.3 % of cells analysed ( p = 0.02 ) .
these data suggested that mglabd regulates formation of pili ; loss of mgla reduces the number of piliated cells .
but , in contrast to the deltapila strain which completely lacks pilus fibres , the total inability of deltamgla cells to invade , despite the presence of a low ( but significant ) frequency of piliated cells , suggests that these few pili present in the deltamgla cells are not competent to facilitate invasion .
this could be due to a defect in pilus retraction upon attachment to prey surfaces , or a requirement for another mgla - controlled factor to mediate invasion .
candidate mglabd - interacting proteins for invasive processes are discussed later .
mglabd controls gliding reversal frequency but not gliding per se knowing that mglabd controls pilus - mediated bacterial invasion in b. bacteriovorus , but that in m. xanthus both pilus - mediated s - motility and gliding a - motility are mgla controlled , we used time - lapse microscopy to observe deltamgla and wild - type b. bacteriovorus strains for gliding motility on 1 % agarose / cahepes .
surface motility in b. bacteriovorus begins after a period of incubation on an agarose surface and allows exploration of environments for potential prey .
in contrast to recent studies in myxococcus xanthus which showed that a deltamglamx strain is non - motile on surfaces [ 7 ] , and a mgla g21v strain displays hyper - reversals during a - motility [ 6 ] , we found that bdellovibrio deltamgla cells showed sustained gliding runs on surfaces ( figure 3 ) , indicating that mglabd is not absolutely required for bdellovibrio cells to glide .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1004253.g003 figure 3 b. bacteriovorus deltamgla hi cells show sustained gliding motility ; mgla - his8 hd cells show hyper - reversals .
( a ) b. bacteriovorus deltamgla hi cells showed gliding motility on 1 % agarose / cahepes .
gliding was sustained and progressive ( cells were not hyper - reversing ) , as in the arrowed cell which moved at 9.49 microm hr - 1 .
each panel is a 15 minute timepoint , starting from 540 minutes after the cells were added to the agarose surface ( three " bystander " cells that have not yet commenced gliding represent a stationary marker ) .
( b ) b. bacteriovorus mgla - his8 hd cells showed a high incidence of reversals during gliding motility on 1 % agarose / cahepes compared to wild - type cells .
each larger panel shows a " trail - montage " of 60 minutes of gliding motility ( 150 second per frame ) : mgla - his8 cells show no progressive gliding motility ( reversing rapidly ) , whilst wild - type cells show sustained runs of gliding ( seen as curving trails with direction changes ) .
( c ) smaller panels show individual wild - type and mgla - his8 hd cells gliding from an original start point ( indicated by white dashed region ) , starting at 180 minutes after addition to the agarose surface and at 150 second intervals ; arrow indicates direction of movement .
a bdellovibrio strain with c - terminally his8 - tagged mglabd , expressed from the endogenous bd3734 promoter in cis , with a plasmid promoter - driven wild - type copy of mglabd , could be grown predatorily , in contrast to the deltamgla strain which was non - predatory .
in a previous study in m. xanthus , the presence of tagged mglamx protein in conjunction with wild - type mglamx allowed gliding to remain fully functional [ 7 ] .
in contrast to the sustained gliding motility of the deltamglabd strain ( figure 3a ) , the predatory b. bacteriovorus hd100 mgla - his8 showed increased reversals during gliding : on average 9.0 reversals hr - 1 ( n = 28 ) , significantly more than wild - type hd100 cells with an average of 3.2 reversals hr - 1 ( n = 21 ) ( p < 0.001 ) ( figure 3b,c ) .
the same hyper - reversal phenotype was also observed in b. bacteriovorus hd100 mgla - mcherry cells ( data not shown ) .
differences between mglabd and mglamx sequences may reflect diverse functions in monopolar predation versus bipolar surface motility mglabd ( bd3734 ) shares significant sequence similarity ( figure 4 ) with mglamx ( mxan1925 accession : yp _ 630169.1 ) , with 64 % protein identity and 82 % similarity ( needle global alignment ) .
the majority of residues shown to be important for mglamx function [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] are conserved in mglabd ( figure 4a - d ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1004253.g004 figure 4 protein alignment of mglamx and mglabd .
mglamx ( mxan1925 ) alignment with mglabd ( bd3734 ) shows significant sequence similarity between the two proteins .
( a ) the p - loop is conserved in b. bacteriovorus , although a serine is present in place of a glycine residue at position 21 ( signified by arrow ) .
the pm1 / g1 threonine residue ( b ) and pm3 ( c ) ; and g2 ( d ) motifs are all conserved between the two proteins ( for mgla genes , encoding mgla g21 , co - occurring with mglb genes see figure s1 ) .
the p - loop region ( 19gxxxxgkt26 ) of mglamx was shown by sogaard andersen and co - workers to be important for gtp hydrolysis , and for mgla function [ 28 ] , and substitutions in this region , such as g21v , were reported to decrease hydrolysis [ 6 ] .
the p - loop region of mglabd contains a natural serine at residue 21 ; the corresponding g12s substitution in eukaryotic g protein ras activates ras protein [ 30 ] , essentially locking the protein in a gtp - bound state , in the same way as a ras g12v substitution .
this suggests that mglabd exists in a permanently gtp - bound state .
the g21 - equivalent residue is a conserved glycine across 7 deltaproteobacterial genera ( figure s1a ) which all also have a conserved mglb gene , though in bdellovibrio the equivalent residue is a serine .
the difference at residue 21 in the mglabd sequence suggested to us a reason why we did not observe conservation of the gene encoding mglb in bdellovibrio , as the gap activity of an mglb would likely be ineffective on a permanently gtp - bound mgla protein such as that suggested by the mglabd sequence with s at position 21 .
we thought that it might also explain the lack of a bdellovibrio frz system [ 23 ] , which stimulates motility reversals in m. xanthus , as a mutation , causing mglamx g21v , bypasses the requirement for frz for reversals in that deltaproteobacterium [ 6 ] .
thus we turned to examine the presence of mglb in the deltaproteobacterial relatives of bdellovibrio .
we also tested the conserved romrbd protein , while also looking for other proteins , specific to bdellovibrio , with which mglabd might interact .
in m. xanthus , romr is found at both poles of the cell and interacts with both mgla and mglb to link the frz system to regulate polarity control [ 23 ] , [ 24 ]. b. bacteriovorus has lost the mglb gene the majority of sequenced deltaproteobacteria genomes contain both mgla and mglb , and these are often co - transcribed at the same locus , including in m. xanthus where the mglbmx protein has an important role in motility [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 31 ] .
although the mgla gene product in b. bacteriovorus hd100 shares extensive sequence similarity with other mgla proteins , there is no mglb homologue in the hd100 genome , despite neighbouring genes ( dnax , recr , mgla and a duf149 - encoding gene ) showing conserved synteny to other deltaproteobacteria that do have an mglb .
the closely related b. bacteriovorus tiberius [ 32 ] also lacks an mglb homologue .
the predatory , invasive , marine bacterium bacteriovorax marinus is also closely related to b. bacteriovorus , although the bdellovibrio and bacteriovorax genera have diverged separately from myxobacteria .
a 16s rrna phylogenetic tree of the deltaproteobacteria shows the ancestral lineage leading to bdellovibrio and bacteriovorax diverged from the ancestral lineage leading to the clade including myxococcus xanthus [ 33 ] and in that divergent bdellovibrio branch we detect mglb loss ( figure s1a ) .
we found that in b. marinus , which also has an mgla gene ( bms _ 0054 ) , there is an adjacent putative mglb homologue ( bms _ 0053 ) , both genes lying downstream of recr ( figure s1b ) .
bms _ 0053 shares only limited sequence similarity with other mglb roadblock domain proteins ( bms _ 0053 , 168 residues , shares 22 % identity and 43 % similarity ( needle global alignment ) with m. xanthus mglb protein , 159 residues , figure s1c ) .
this highly divergent mglb homologue in bacteriovorax is likely still functional , since no frameshift or nonsense mutations have arisen in the b. marinus lineage , and protein sequence length is conserved ; however , its function is unclear .
we are unable to test whether mglb is under positive selection ( dn / ds > 1 ) in bacteriovorax because synonymous substitution rates are saturated for available sequence comparisons ( ds > 2 ) .
the bacteriovorax mgla homologue is much more conserved ( 66 % identity and 83 % similarity to mglabd ) and may function in an analogous predatory role to that of b. bacteriovorus .
mglabd interacts with tpr - ( tetratricopeptide repeat ) domain protein bd2492 in vivo as mglabd had both similarities and differences to mglamx , we sought to identify proteins that interact with mgla homologue bd3734 in b. bacteriovorus as we reasoned that these proteins might have a predatory role .
we used a pull - down co - purification assay with proteins from the predatory b. bacteriovorus strain producing mglabd with a c - terminal his8 tag from the endogenous mglabd promoter , mentioned above .
for the co - purification assay , a host - independent isolate of the mglabd - his8 strain was used , as previous array data showed that mglabd transcription is up - regulated in wild type hi cells , ( which remain predatory but are longer than attack phase bdellovibrio ) .
whole cell lysates of this hi strain were used in the assay , in which the bait his - tagged protein mglabd binding to talon - nx cobalt - charged resin allowed interacting proteins to be identified ( figure s2 ) that were not present in the control without the his - tag .
mglabd co - purified with bd2492 ( accession : np _ 969302.1 ) ( figure s2 ) - a b. bacteriovorus protein with a hypothetical annotation , with predicted tetratricopeptide repeat ( tpr ) domains typically involved in protein - protein interactions .
bands were excised from the gel and analysed by lc - ms / ms. corresponding regions of the wild - type hid13 control lane were also analysed , and neither mglabd nor bd2492 were found in these regions , suggesting that mglabd and bd2492 ( tprbd ) interact in vivo .
confirmation that mglabd and tprbd proteins interact by bacterial two - hybrid and heterologous co - expression in e. coli the mgla orf and bd2492 orf were cloned into put18c and pkt25 vectors containing t18 and t25 fragments of adenylate cyclase , respectively [ 34 ] .
the bacterial two - hybrid assay for mgla and bd2492 showed a strong signal ( figure s3a - b ) suggesting that the two b. bacteriovorus proteins interact .
this interaction was supported by the observation that mgla co - purifies with his6 - tagged bd2492 in nickel - affinity chromatography of e. coli lysates heterologously expressing these two proteins from plasmid pd2492n / 3734 ( figure s4 ) .
gel filtration and sds - page of purified mgla and bd2492 - his6 indicated that the mgla - bd2492 complex has an mw of approximately 63 kda and exists predominantly as a heterodimeric complex of 1:1 stoichiometry ( data not shown ) .
tprbd is required for predatory invasion by b. bacteriovorus hd100 as the b. bacteriovorus mgla mutant was non - predatory , we tested whether bd2492 ( encoding tprbd ) was essential for predatory growth .
all attempts to inactivate bd2492tpr in host - dependent b. bacteriovorus hd100 were unsuccessful ( 68 revertants obtained from second crossover events , but no deletion mutants ) .
two host - independent ( hi ) deltabd2492 strains were obtained through sucrose - suicide counter - selection from a total of 10 screened .
when challenged with prey , deltabd2492tpr hi strains were unable to lyse e. coli in liquid culture ( figure s5 ) .
as with the deltamgla hi strains , the deltabd2492tpr hi strains could still attach to e. coli prey cells ( attachment assay ; 26.6 % of e. coli cells had attached bdellovibrio ) , but could not invade to form bdelloplasts ( invasion assay ; 0 / 389 e. coli cells ) .
the b. bacteriovorus deltabd2492tpr hi strain was still able to glide on 1 % agarose cahepes ( data not shown ). b. bacteriovorus genes bd2492 , bd2494 and bd2495 are co - transcribed and syntenic in other deltaproteobacteria tpr gene bd2492 is co - transcribed with bd2494 and bd2495 ( figure s6 ) .
the same gene synteny is also found in m. xanthus ( mxan _ 5763 - 5766 ) and b. marinus sj ( bms _ 0137 - 140 ) ( figure 5 ) where the gene encoding a tpr domain protein is followed by genes encoding homologues of bd2494 and bd2495 .
in m. xanthus , the genes encoding homologues of bd2492 and bd2494 ( mxan _ 5766 and mxan _ 5764 ) are interrupted by a gene encoding a putative sec system atpase , mxan _ 5765 .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1004253.g005 figure 5 gene synteny of bd2492 - bd2495 homologues is conserved in b. bacteriovorus , m. xanthus and b. marinus .
genes encoding a tpr domain protein are followed by genes encoding a duf490 domain protein and an omp85 superfamily protein in all three bacterial species .
in m. xanthus , the three genes are interrupted by a gene encoding a putative sec system atpase , mxan _ 5765 .
percentage protein sequence identities and similarities with the b. bacteriovorus protein ( needle global alignment ) are shown underneath ( for operon - confirmation of bd2492 - 2495 see figure s6 ). b. bacteriovorus gene bd2492 encodes a hypothetical 353 amino acid tetratricopeptide repeat ( tpr ) protein ; tprpred ( http :// tprpred.tuebingen.mpg.de / tprpred ) was used to predict tpr domains [ 35 ] .
tprpred confirmed that both bms _ 0137 ( 524 residues ; accession : yp _ 005034048.1 ) and mxan _ 5766 ( 1031 residues ; accession : yp _ 633903.1 ) are also predicted to contain tpr domains .
all three tpr domain proteins do not have predicted signal sequences , as predicted by signalp [ 36 ] .
bd2494 is a predicted transmembrane protein with a duf490 domain .
both bms _ 0139 ( accession : yp _ 005034049.1 ) and mxan _ 5764 ( accession : yp _ 633901.1 ) also contain predicted duf490 domains .
bd2495 is a surface antigen variable number repeat domain protein of the ( outer membrane protein ) omp85 ( tama / bama / yaet ) superfamily , hereafter termed tamabd ; homologues of which are conserved in both b. marinus ( bms _ 0140 ; accession : yp _ 005034050.1 ) and m. xanthus ( mxan _ 5763 ; accession : yp _ 633900.1 ) .
romrbd in b. bacteriovorus interacts with tprbd by bth and both proteins are located at the prey - invasion pole as mentioned in the introduction , romrmx interacts with the mglamx signalling system to regulate surface motility in response to frz system signals [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , but the frz system is not conserved in bdellovibrio .
we assessed the interaction of the romrbd ( bd2761 ; accession : np _ 969553.1 ) with the mgla - interacting protein tprbd ( bd2492 ) by bacterial two - hybrid ( figure s3a ) .
romrbd shares homology with the rec domain and c - terminal region of romrmx , whilst the remainder of the protein is less well conserved ( figure s7 ) .
romrbd and tprbd interact in the bth assay ( figure s3a , c ) .
we found that romrbd and mglabd interacted weakly , but not significantly ( p = 0.18 ) ( figure s3b - c ) .
fluorescent tagging of romrbd and tprbd with c - terminal mcherry revealed that both proteins are localised at only one pole of the cell .
co - incubation with e. coli prey cells confirmed that both romrbd - mcherry and tprbd - mcherry are found at the anterior , prey - interaction pole of b. bacteriovorus cells ( figure 6 ) .
fluorescent tagging of mglabd with mcherry typically showed cells with diffuse fluorescence localization in cells directly after applying to 1 % agarose / cahepes ( i.e. not gliding ) ( figure 6 ) ; 63 % of hd100 mgla - mcherry bdellovibrio had diffuse fluorescence , the remainder showing a unipolar focus ( 28.4 %) or bipolar foci ( 8.6 %) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1004253.g006 figure 6 b. bacteriovorus romr - mcherry and bd2492 - mcherry localised at the prey - interaction pole ; mgla - mcherry showed variable diffuse foci. b. bacteriovorus cells were incubated with e. coli s17 - 1 prey cells for 5 minutes , allowing sufficient time for some of the bdellovibrio cells to attach to prey .
panels - a : the lower prey - cell shows a typical attached bdellovibrio cell , with a romr - mcherry focus at the anterior ( attached ) pole of the bdellovibrio .
b : the rightmost prey - cell shows a typical attached bdellovibrio cell , with a bd2492 - mcherry focus at the anterior ( attached ) pole of the bdellovibrio .
c : mgla - mcherry bdellovibrio cells had variable foci , including diffuse and unipolar localisations. from left to right , all panels show brightfield , fluorescent , and merged images and a graphical representation .
fluorescent exposure = 2 seconds .
romrbd and tprbd interact with invasion - pole protein cdga , a degenerate gvnef c - di - gmp binding protein which is required for rapid prey - invasion by b. bacteriovorus we found earlier that the bdellovibrio deltamgla strain does not show a hyper - reversal or non - motility phenotype ( figure 3 ) .
thus , the regulation of mglabd localization in the control of gliding reversals ( in the absence of mglb and frz ) is likely to employ an alternative signalling system to that of m. xanthus .
previous work suggested that this could be c - di - gmp as we have shown [ 25 ] that lack of ggdef protein bd0367 dgca abolished gliding exit from bdelloplasts .
we had also had previously noted a link between a c - di - gmp binding protein and prey - invasion in bdellovibrio [ 25 ] .
degenerate ggdef ( gvnef ) protein cdga , bd3125 ( accession : np _ 969891.1 ) , is located at the prey invading pole of b. bacteriovorus and lack of this polar protein causes a very significant slowing of prey - invasion with bdelloplast formation taking 40 - 90 minutes compared to 30 - 40 minutes for wild type [ 25 ] .
we concluded in that paper that " cdga organises processes at the bdellovibrio " nose " that are crucial to rapid prey - invasion " .
in our current study , we found that both romrbd and tprbd ( though not mgla ) interacted with cdga in the bacterial two - hybrid assay ( figure s3 ) , supporting this idea. whether romrbd has a role in the regulation of gliding motility will be the subject of a subsequent study , but our interaction data suggested a link between romrbd and predatory growth ( as deltacdga was affected in predation [ 25 ]) , so we tested for a romrbd deletion strain .
romrbd is essential in b. bacteriovorus given the cdga and tprbd interactions found at the b. bacteriovorus invasive pole , we speculated that romrbd would be required for prey - invasion .
attempts to delete romrbd , both predatorily ( hd ) and host - independently ( hi ) , were unsuccessful ( hd 104 ; hi 120 revertants screened ) , suggesting that romrbd is required for both predatory and host - independent bdellovibrio growth .
tamabd , encoded from the operon encoding tprbd is also essential in b. bacteriovorus as romrbd interacted , by bth , with tprbd , encoded in an operon with the tamab genes , we speculated that the tamab complex would also be required for predatory growth .
attempts to delete tamabd also proved unsuccessful ( hd 140 ; hi 97 revertants screened ) , suggesting that tamabd is also essential for both phases of bdellovibrio growth .
discussion here we report that b. bacteriovorus use homologues of adventurous / social motility - control proteins for the process of predatory invasion of other bacteria .
whilst non - invasive m. xanthus utilise the proteins mgla and mglb to control bipolar , bidirectional surface motility [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] in bdellovibrio mglabd has evolved to function without an mglb homologue ( the mglb gene is absent ) to regulate prey entry at a single pole .
a unipolar role for the b. bacteriovorus homologues of the m. xanthus motility proteins there are three lines of evidence to suggest this : ( 1 ) the deletion of mglabd caused a non - prey - invasive phenotype ( figure 1 ) and severely reduced pilus formation on the cell surface ; ( 2 ) the natural substitution in mglabd of serine for glycine ( figure 4 ) at the position equivalent to residue 21 in mglamx suggests that mglabd exists in a permanently gtp - bound state , and is not involved in the gtpase cycle which is key to the alternate bi - polar switching of motility proteins in m. xanthus [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] ; ( 3 ) romr - mcherry is unipolar in b. bacteriovorus ( figure 6 ) , in contrast to its asymmetric bipolar localization in myxococcus , controlling mglamx positioning .
romrbd is localised only at the prey - invasion pole and has a different phenotype to romrmx we had hypothesised that romrbd might be involved in regulating pole activity to control gliding motility .
as romrbd was found at the predatory pole only , this suggested an alternative role .
we could not detect a significant interaction between romrbd and mglabd by bth , but we did detect a significant interaction with bd2492 tpr protein ( figure s3 ) , which is also at the anterior pole ( discussed later ) .
the romrbd location at the anterior pole of b. bacteriovorus puts it where prey - invading t4p are located .
lotte sogaard - andersen 's group showed that an mgla mx deletion mutant resulted in unipolar romrmx , with romrmx and t4p , ( used in that bacterium for bipolar social motility ) , found at the same pole [ 37 ] .
sequence - and localization - differences between unipolar romrbd and mglabd ( in the absence of an mglb ) in b. bacteriovorus , versus those in m. xanthus ( which has mglb ) , might explain why t4p are only found at the anterior bdellovibrio pole where they control prey - invasion .
deletion of romrbd abolished bdellovibrio growth in both hi and predatory conditions , but in m. xanthus romr is viable with abolition of gliding motility and reduction of t4p - dependent social motility [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
thus romrbd , which does show some sequence divergence from romrmx ( figure s7 ) , could be reporting t4p activity and prey - invasion , at the anterior pole , back to initiate bdellovibrio growth .
it should be recalled that predatory " attack phase " bdellovibrio do not replicate outside prey , but initiate replication when prey are entered [ 20 ] .
absence of mglb in bdellovibrio is consistent with unipolar romrbd our bth interaction data were too weak to prove a significant interaction between romrbd and mglabd .
this could be interpreted to mean that romrbd transiently docks with mglabd when romrbd is complexed at the pole , that other partner proteins are required to contribute to this interaction , or that they do not interact , in contrast to published data for mglamx [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
our finding that romrbd is unipolar fits with evidence in m. xanthus that mglbmx is required for bipolar localization of romrmx [ 23 ] and the apparent loss of mglb from the prey - invasive bdellovibrio lineage in evolution .
the bdellovibrio - like invasive b. marinus has a putative mglb gene , the product of which shows only limited sequence similarity to other mglb roadblock domain proteins ( figure s1 ) .
this mglbbm gene is highly divergent from mglbmx but likely still functional .
it may be undergoing selection to evolve an alternative function , while the b. marinus mgla gene is maintained for a predatory role analogous to that in b. bacteriovorus .
mgla and mglb were shown to be conserved by keilberg and co - workers in many deltaproteobacteria but also occur in some evolutionarily distant bacteria such as the green non sulphur bacteria , acidobacteria and deinococcus - thermus group , figure s3 in ref [ 23 ] .
the authors calculated the following : out of a total of 70 species with ( at least one ) predicted mgla homologue 87 % = 61 / 70 species have mglb and an mgla. of the 9 without mglb , 4 bacteria had mgla g21 with no mglb ; 5 had mgla a / s21 with no mglb. of these 9 with no mglb , only b. bacteriovorus and one other species , ( a soil acidobacterium named candidatus koribacteria versatilis ) , have predicted romr homologues .
thus bacteria with romr and mgla and b may have interacting protein complexes that move between poles ; but our study on b. bacteriovorus is the first to examine the situation in a bacterium where mgla and romr are present but mglb is not .
as mentioned above , we detected an interaction with an additional protein that could contribute to the localization of mglabd and romrbd at the single prey - invasion pole of bdellovibrio .
this was with the unipolar tetratricopeptide repeat tpr protein , bd2492 ( tprbd ) shown using both his - tag pull - downs and bth for mgla and bth for romr .
tprbd could sequester either mglabd or romrbd at the prey - invasive pole , regulating their freedom to interact with each other , or promoting an interaction on the tprbd surface .
deletion of bd2492tprbd abolished prey - invasion in the same manner as deltamglabd ( figure s5 , figure 1 ) .
it was not possible to monitor localization of fluorescently tagged proteins informatively in the hi derivative strains of the non - predatory deltamglabd and deltabd2492 mutants .
this is because hi derivatives have pleomorphic cell morphotypes ( hi cells naturally differ greatly in length and shape ) [ 38 ] , and indeed some long hi cells are predatory at both poles [ 25 ] .
tpr gene bd2492 is in an operon with tamab genes the bd2492 gene is located upstream of , and is co - expressed ( figure 5 , figure s6 ) in an operon with , gene bd2494 , which encodes a transmembrane protein with a c - terminal duf490 domain , homologous to the tamb component of the tamab autotransporter - secretion system [ 39 ] .
bd2494 might dock with tprbd at the prey - invasive nose .
the last gene in the operon ( bd2495 ) encodes a 7 - potra ( polypeptide - transport - associated ) - domain , outer membrane protein ( omp ) member of the omp85 superfamily .
the omp85 protein family includes the bama component of the bam complex , known to receive and assemble beta barrel proteins during outer membrane growth [ 40 ] .
the family also includes the tama component of the tamab complex , which aids autotransporter secretion [ 39 ] ; and two - protein secretion ( tps ) proteins [ 41 ] .
the tama and tamb genes are typically adjacent in proteobacteria [ 39 ] , suggesting that the adjacent b. bacteriovorus bd2494 - 2495 genes encode a tamab - like transporter .
thus our finding that mglabd and romrbd interact with a tpr protein ( figure s3 ) , encoded from the 5 ' gene of a tamab - like operon , suggests that the bd2494 - 2495 tamab - like transport activity might be required for omp / autotransporter proteins involved in predation .
this may account for our observation that some pili are present on the deltamgla mutant but that despite this , it does not invade due to an effect on tamab - dependent predatory protein transport .
similarly , the deltabd2492 mutant was also non - predatory ( figure s5 ) , but attached to prey .
this suggests that either : tprbd and mglabd are important in the positioning of proteins ( probably bd2494 - 5 tamabbd ) at the predatory pole of the b. bacteriovorus cell to facilitate prey entry ; or that binding of romrbd and mglabd to tprbd affects its activity , and that of the tamabbd complex , regulating predatory protein secretion .
reinforcing our observation ( mentioned above ) that romrbd is essential , we found , by attempting to delete bd2495 , that tamabd was also essential for both hd and hi growth of bdellovibrio .
this suggests that the activity of the tamab complex ( possibly involving a tpr - mediated interaction with romrbd ) is required for secretion of proteins required for prey - invasion and both predatory and hi growth .
potential candidates for tamab export are proteins involved in the synthesis / secretion / maturation of extracellular polysaccharide ( eps ) or polyelectrolytes ; an earlier study proposed that romr was responsible for stimulating polyelectrolyte secretion in m. xanthus [ 37 ] .
we cannot yet define whether romrbd activates a tamab dependent process that is essential for predatory and hi growth , or whether it reports on the activity of a tamab complex , via its interaction with tprbd , to regulate bdellovibrio growth .
this will be the subject of a further extensive genetic study .
conserved synteny of the tpr tamab genes in myxococcus although a tpr protein interaction with mglamx or romrmx has not been previously reported , the mxan _ 5766 gene encoding a tpr domain protein , from a gene cluster with similar synteny to the b. bacteriovorus bd2492 - 2495 genes ( figure 5 ) , has previously been implicated in m. xanthus s - motility by transposon studies carried out by the hartzell group [ 42 ] .
the low percentages of tpr orf similarity / identity between mxan _ 5766 and bd2492 could reflect the greatly different protein sizes and may indicate interactions with additional protein partners in m. xanthus .
however , in m. xanthus , similar tpr interactions with romr , mgla and tamab - like proteins could play a role in bipolar motility control. whether or not this is the case in m. xanthus , it is clear that tpr , and likely tamabbd , proteins play an important role in defining the single , active , predatory pole of bdellovibrio .
a protein hub controlling predatory invasion we propose a predatory regulatory ' hub ' of proteins at the b. bacteriovorus prey - invasive pole ( figure 7 ) , with the tamab - associated bd2492 - 5 tprbd protein complex involved in the organisation / assembly of omps or autotransporters at the predatory pole .
this is reflective of tamab protein functions in other bacteria ( discussed in [ 39 ]) .
such protein secretion could facilitate predation directly or produce other extra - cellular compounds such as eps or polyelectrolytes , as mentioned above , which contribute to predatory invasion .
predatory proteins could be secreted in outer membrane vesicles ( omvs ) ; sar and arf gtpases ( homologous to mgla ) have functions in vesicle transport [ 43 ] and m. xanthus vesicles likely have an extra - cellular predatory role in the " wolf - pack " [ 44 ] hunting of m. xanthus [ 45 ] .
our studies show that the directed prey - invasion of bdellovibrio requires a protein encoded by a tamab operon , suggesting synergies in tamab - mediated predation and cell interaction processes of b. bacteriovorus and m. xanthus which is worthy of further investigation .
regulatory protein hubs are reported to control pili and flagella in other bacteria [ 46 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1004253.g007 figure 7 model for b. bacteriovorus predatory - pole regulation during prey - invasion and its relationship to m. xanthus bipolar motility - control proteins .
during prey - invasion ; tamabd , romrbd and cdga protein interactions occur ( see figure s2 , s3 s4 ) at the single b. bacteriovorus pole .
this could control localization of the tamabd - like omp at the prey - interaction pole or activate it to receive , ( via its potra domains ) , and secrete predatory outer membrane or autotransporter proteins .
the action of this secretion via bd2495 tama is essential to both predatory and hi lifestyles , and romrbd , ( which is also essential ) , may regulate or report the activity of the tamab transport system , at the single predatory pole .
additional regulation of this activity could be influenced by c - di - gmp for which cdga , ( another hub protein that binds romr and tpr bd2492 ) , is a receptor in bdellovibrio .
mglabd interacts with bd2492 at the predatory pole but also is found more diffusely in the cell .
mgla interactions may regulate prey entry via tpr bd2492 , as deletion of mgla or tpr bd2492 abolishes prey - invasion but not prey attachment .
mgla deletion in bdellovibrio greatly reduces the level of type iv pilus formation at the single anterior pole .
in contrast keilberg and co - workers showed that m. xanthus romr and mglb localise bipolarly asymmetrically , while mgla typically localises at the leading cell pole , during surface movement , to regulate both a - and s - motility ( m. xanthus after [ 23 ]) .
evolutionary comparisons in myxococcus and bdellovibrio considering evolutionary differences that led bdellovibrio to prey - invasion via a single pole , we also suggest that the absence of mglb in b. bacteriovorus ( and the high degree of divergence of this gene in b. marinus ) , is because mglb is no longer required for pole switching of pili : b. bacteriovorus pili are found at only one - the non - flagellar , prey - invasive pole [ 4 ] .
this is also concordant with b. bacteriovorus cells being incapable of s - motility ( which would require pole - switching of t4p ) and instead using t4p at a single pole for prey - invasion .
however , the absence of an mglb homologue does suggest that an alternative mechanism for regulating reversals during gliding motility is likely to exist .
the mechanism by which reduced incidence of pili or a change in their retraction state is caused , in the b. bacteriovorus deltamglabd strain , remains to be determined .
capeness and coworkers have recently shown that regulation of bdellovibrio pilus retraction status does correlate with prey - invasion [ 26 ] .
pilus retraction occurs through secretin pilq [ 47 ] , which is required for predation in b. bacteriovorus [ 18 ] .
the om - assembly of a pilus - biogenesis protein such as pilq could be affected by the bd2492 - 5 tamab complex activity .
alternatively , omps required for secretion of eps might be perturbed at the bdellovibrio pole , preventing pilus retraction ; eps is required for pilus retraction in m. xanthus [ 48 ] .
these considerations will be the subject of a subsequent study .
the mgla / romr - tpr interactions reported in this paper may have evolved from ancient interactions common to ancestors of m. xanthus and bdellovibrio , and are now used in b. bacteriovorus for prey - invasion control .
they may also underlie the motility and " wolf - pack " predation of myxobacteria , but the function of the m. xanthus tpr protein homologue remains to be explored .
pioneering work by mignot / theodoly has shown that adhesion during gliding motility is mediated by slime deposition [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] on a solid surface and that gliding directionality is controlled by mglamx [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] and other interacting proteins .
in nature gliding of m. xanthus may occur on top of prey bacterial biofilms and we hypothesise that the bd2492 - 5 tamab associated system may have a role in producing vesicles , not only for gliding , but to damage prey cells as part of the m. xanthus wolf - pack lytic process .
cyclic - di - gmp signalling at the predation control hub in m. xanthus , chemotactic phospho - transfer signalling , involving frz proteins , governs the localization of soluble romrmx , mglamx and mglbmx proteins to alternately activate or deactivate each cell pole for surface - motility directionality [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
in b. bacteriovorus , we detected an interaction between romrbd and the cdga gvnef domain c - di - gmp binding protein ( figure s3 ) which has been shown to affect prey entry [ 25 ] .
there is no frz system in bdellovibrio [ 23 ] but our finding that cdga binds romrbd ( figure s3 ) suggests that this c - di - gmp signalling pathway could contribute to romrbd localization in the control of the prey - invasive pole .
further work is underway to define any signalling - link to romrbd and cdga from our previous observations that c - di - gmp synthases control gliding motility , predation and the switch from predatory to host - independent growth [ 25 ] .
the data we present here show how the " phenotype space " and function of b. bacteriovorus mgla has diverged from that in m. xanthus .
mglabd functions in the control of unipolar prey - invasion : a critical process in the predatory lifecycle of b. bacteriovorus .
our present observations indicate ( figure 7 ) that mglabd , romrbd and the interacting tpr - domain protein tprbd and tamabbd complex act at a single pole in b. bacteriovorus to facilitate prey - invasion via a mechanism that has diverged from that which controls m. xanthus s - motility .

figure s5 predation of b. bacteriovorus deltabd2492 hi strains assayed against predatory wild - type controls .
( a ) predation efficiency of the deltabd2492 hi strain was assayed against predatory and non - predatory controls by the reduction of e. coli numbers over 48 hours .
wild - type hi strain hid26 reduced e. coli numbers in liquid cultures by over four logs .
the deltabd2492 hi strain showed no reduction in e. coli numbers , comparable to a known non - predatory deltapila hi strain , and to e. coli with no added b. bacteriovorus .
( b ) reintroduction of the bd2492 orf in cis to the deltabd2492 hi strain in plasmid pk18 : : bd2492 restored predatory growth .

figure s6 b. bacteriovorus genes bd2492 - 2495 are co - transcribed .
rt - pcr on b. bacteriovorus hd100 attack - phase rna showed that bd2492 and bd2494 ( left ) are co - transcribed , as are bd2494 and bd2495 ( right ) .
this suggests that the three genes are all co - transcribed in the same operon .

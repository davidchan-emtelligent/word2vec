training can induce cross - modal plasticity in the human cortex .
a well - known example of this phenomenon is the recruitment of visual areas for tactile and auditory processing .
it remains unclear to what extent such plasticity is associated with changes in anatomy .
here we enrolled 29 sighted adults into a nine - month tactile braille - reading training , and used voxel - based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging to describe the resulting anatomical changes .
in addition , we collected resting - state fmri data to relate these changes to functional connectivity between visual and somatosensory - motor cortices .
following braille - training , we observed substantial grey and white matter reorganization in the anterior part of early visual cortex ( peripheral visual field ) .
moreover , relative to its posterior , foveal part , the peripheral representation of early visual cortex had stronger functional connections to somatosensory and motor cortices even before the onset of training .
previous studies show that the early visual cortex can be functionally recruited for tactile discrimination , including recognition of braille characters .
our results demonstrate that reorganization in this region induced by tactile training can also be anatomical .
this change most likely reflects a strengthening of existing connectivity between the peripheral visual cortex and somatosensory cortices , which suggests a putative mechanism for cross - modal recruitment of visual areas .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction sensory and motor training induces changes in grey and white matter1,2 .
while a substantial body of research exists on this phenomenon , most of it pertains to local changes within the specific sensory system being trained , such as plasticity of the visual cortex in response to visual or visuo - motor training3 - 5 , or plasticity of the auditory cortex in response to audio - motor training6 .
the anatomical mechanisms associated with training that relies on cross - modal plasticity spanning distant brain systems remain largely unknown .
cross - modal plasticity is known to occur when the brain adapts to changes in the input that it receives , notably changes caused by sensory deprivation7,8 .
in the blind , for example , the visual cortex becomes recruited for auditory and tactile processing , such as braille reading9 - 13 , while in the deaf , the auditory cortex becomes recruited for visual and tactile processing14 - 18 .
this phenomenon exists also in non - deprived subjects ; in professional pianists , the auditory cortex becomes recruited for visuomotor processing19 ; in sighted braille readers , the ventral visual stream becomes recruited for tactile braille reading20 , while in users of sensory substitution devices which transform vision to audition , the ventral visual stream becomes recruited for auditory object perception21 .
characteristically , such reorganization can also affect low - level sensory cortices22,23 .
while there are some substantial studies on the anatomical underpinnings of cross - modal plasticity , they nonetheless have two major limitations .
first , almost all of them have been performed in sensory - deprived subjects .
second , none of them used a longitudinal design .
we do know then that anatomical reorganization occurs in the visual cortex of the blind24 - 27 and the auditory cortex of the deaf28 - 32 , and , importantly , several studies show that these changes can be related to cross - modal plasticity rather than to sensory deprivation itself27,31,32 .
however , it is unclear whether similar anatomical mechanisms operate in non - deprived individuals .
we reasoned that a longitudinal study in adult , non - deprived subjects could demonstrate to what degree large - scale anatomical flexibility of the brain is preserved beyond the typical developmental windows characterized in childhood .
in addition , we wanted to determine the extent in which anatomical and functional changes are related to each other in the course of cross - modal plasticity .
these two facets of the same phenomenon were studied mostly in separate subject samples enrolled in different tasks and trainings .
we sought to apply a multimodal imaging approach , which combines structural and functional methods in the same group .
in our recent study , we showed that after nine months of training , tactile braille reading recruits the ventral visual cortex in sighted adults20 .
here , we used voxel - based morphometry ( vbm ) and diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) data from the same group of subjects to describe structural reorganization associated with learning this skill .
additionally , we used resting - state fmri data to relate potential structural changes to the long - distance functional connectivity between visual and somatosensory - motor cortices .
based on our previous study20 and results from blind subjects27 , we expected to observe anatomical reorganization induced by the braille training in the visual cortex .
furthermore , since braille reading is a tactile - motor task , we expected that this anatomical reorganization will occur in a section of the visual cortex that has inherent functional connections to somatosensory and motor cortices .
results braille training was completed by 29 sighted adults , mostly braille educators and special education studies students , specializing in blindness and related disabilities ( experimental group ) .
before training , the subjects were familiar with visually - presented braille but unable to read it tactually ( see behavioural results ; see supplementary information online for discussion of potential impact of subjects' prior familiarity with visual braille , and of visual braille learning during the study on our results ) .
the same subject group has been already described in our previous articles20,33,34 .
all subjects from the experimental group underwent baseline and after - training mri sessions .
additionally , 19 out of 29 originally recruited subjects participated in a follow - up mri session , nine months after the end of the training .
to ensure that observed anatomical changes were specific to the experimental group , we also recruited a longitudinal control group of 15 subjects ( see methods ) .
subjects in this group were not familiar with braille reading and received no training .
they were scanned at a baseline session and then at the eighteen - month interval , corresponding to the baseline and follow - up sessions in the experimental group .
finally , another group of 31 control subjects was included to test for generality of effects observed in the resting - state fmri functional connectivity analysis in the experimental group ( see methods ) .
behavioural results detailed behavioural results are reported elsewhere33,34 .
briefly , at the beginning of the study , subjects from the experimental group were familiar with visually - presented braille but unable to read it tactually .
at the baseline testing session , 26 subjects from the experimental group ( out of 29 included in this study ) were unable to read tactually even a single braille word per minute ( fig. 1a ) .
one subject managed to read one word and two subjects read two words .
moreover , subjects could recognize tactually only a few braille letters , and their mean letter reading speed was 2.28 letters per minute ( fig. 1b ; lpm ; sd = 1.72 ; range = 0 - 7 ) .
this was in contrast to their reading skills in visually - presented braille .
even in the baseline session , subjects from the experimental group were able to perform a lexical decision task on braille words and pseudowords presented visually ( see methods ; mean accuracy = 78 % , mean reaction time = 4.6 s. ; see supplementary fig. s1 ) .
figure 1 behavioural outcomes of the tactile braille training .
individual results of ( a ) the braille word reading test and ( b ) the braille letter reading test were plotted for baseline , after - training and follow - up sessions .
group means are illustrated as red dots .
during training , subjects from the experimental group significantly progressed in their tactile braille reading skills .
in the after - training testing session , their word reading speed was 6.2 words per minute ( fig. 1a ; wpm ; sd = 3.94 ; range = 0 - 17 ; after - training vs. baseline session : t ( 28 ) = 7.99 , p < 0.001 ) and their letter reading speed was 18.4 lpm ( fig. 1b ; sd = 4.81 ; range = 10 - 29 ; after - training vs. baseline session : t ( 28 ) = 19.87 , p < 0.001 ) .
during training , subjects checked their exercises visually ( see methods ) .
consequently , following training we also observed progress in their visually - presented braille reading skills .
in the lexical decision task , their mean accuracy increased to 88 % ( supplementary fig. s1 ; after - training vs. baseline session : t ( 27 ) = 4.72 , p < 0.001 ) and their mean reaction time decreased to 3.8 s .
( supplementary fig. s1 ; after - training vs. baseline session : t ( 24 ) = 7.05 , p < 0.001 ) in the follow - up testing session , the subjects' tactile braille reading was slower than in the after - training session - their word reading speed was 3.63 wpm ( fig. 1a ; sd = 3.36 ; range = 0 - 11 ; after - training vs. follow - up session t ( 18 ) = 4.16 , p = 0.001 ) and their letter reading speed was 13.7 lpm ( fig. 1b ; sd = 5.39 ; range = 4 - 23 ; after - training vs. follow - up session t ( 18 ) = 5.72 , p = 0.001 ) .
nevertheless , 17 out of 19 subjects tested in the follow - up session were still able to read whole braille words at a speed of at least 1 wpm .
neuroimaging results to identify regions in which grey matter volume had been altered following the training , we performed a whole - brain comparison between after - training and baseline scans in the experimental group .
following the training , the most pronounced increase in grey matter volume was observed in the early visual cortex ( fig. 2a ; peak mni = - 11 - 69 12 , t = 6.56 ) .
this effect was confined to the anterior end of the calcarine sulcus , where the peripheral visual field is represented35 , and was observed in 27 out of 29 subjects ( fig. 2b ) .
grey matter volume increases were also found in the left cerebellum and the left premotor cortex ( fig. 2a and supplementary table s1 ) .
in contrast , we did not observe any significant grey matter volume increases in the control group .

based on our apriori hypothesis to find anatomical reorganization in the visual cortex , we then applied an independent region - of - interest ( roi ) analysis , to describe the time - course of grey matter volume changes in the peripheral early visual cortex and to statistically test whether this reorganization was specific to the experimental group ( fig. 2c ; see methods for roi definition procedures ) .
this analysis confirmed that in the experimental group , the grey matter volume in the peripheral early visual cortex had increased ( after - training vs. baseline scan : t ( 18 ) = 4.42 , p < 0.001 ) .
moreover , this effect was specific to the experimental group ( group x scan interaction : f ( 1 , 29 ) = 4.66 , p = 0.039 ) and was still present nine months after the end of training ( follow - up vs. baseline scan in the experimental group : t ( 18 ) = 3.94 , p < 0.001 ; the results of whole - brain follow - up vs. baseline and follow - up vs. after - training vbm analyses can be found in supplementary tables s2 and s3 ) .
the roi analysis thus confirmed that tactile braille training induced grey matter reorganization in the peripheral part of the early visual cortex .
in both groups , we also observed significant grey matter volume decreases with time ( baseline vs. after - training contrast in the experimental group and baseline vs. follow - up contrast in the control group ; see fig. 2a and supplementary table s1 ) .
however , a between - group interaction analysis did not reveal any effects specific to the experimental or the control group .
we then performed a whole - brain dti white - matter connectivity analysis ( fig. 3 ) .
its results were congruent with the pattern of grey matter volume changes .
following tactile braille training , we observed an increase in fractional anisotropy ( fa ) in white - matter bundles within the peripheral part of the left early visual cortex ( fig. 3a ; peak mni = - 12 - 75 1 , t = 5.04 ) .
this increase was observed in 23 out of 29 subjects ( fig. 3b ) .
the location of this effect closely matched the changes in grey matter volume detected with vbm ( fig. 3c ) .
we also found fa increases in frontal lobes and in right - hemipsheric perisylvian regions ( see fig. 3a and supplementary table s4 ) .
no significant fa increases were observed in the control group .

error bars represent standard error of the mean .
next , an independent roi analysis was applied to the peripheral early visual cortex , using procedures similar to those previously applied to vbm data ( fig. 3d ; methods ) .
this analysis revealed that fa in the peripheral early visual cortex had significantly increased in the experimental group ( after - training vs. baseline scan : t ( 18 ) = 3.60 , p = 0.002 ) .
this effect was specific to this group only ( group x scan interaction : f ( 1 , 29 ) = 4.95 , p = 0.034 ) and was still present at nine months after the end of the braille training ( follow - up vs. baseline scan in the experimental group : t ( 18 ) = 5.03 , p < 0.001 ; the results of whole - brain follow - up vs. baseline and follow - up vs. after - training dti analyses can be found in supplementary tables s5 and s6 ) .
thus , the roi analysis confirmed that braille training induced white - matter reorganization in the peripheral early visual cortex .
to facilitate the interpretation of this effect , we also tested for changes in axial diffusivity ( ad ) and radial diffusivity ( rd ) in the experimental group ( fig. 3d ; methods ) .
following braille training , we observed decreased rd in the peripheral early visual cortex ( after - training vs. baseline scan : t ( 18 ) = 3.18 , p = 0.005 ) .
this effect was present also in the follow - up scan ( follow - up vs. baseline scan : t ( 18 ) = 3.11 , p = 0.006 ) .
in contrast , no changes were found in ad. in the experimental group , we also observed significant fa decreases following the braille training ( baseline vs. after - training contrast ; fig. 3a ; supplementary table s4 ) .
while these effects were not detected in the control group ( baseline vs. follow - up contrast ) , no statistically significant between - group interaction was found .
to relate anatomical reorganization in the experimental group to training outcomes , we correlated training - related ( after - training - baseline ) changes in grey matter volume ( vbm analysis ) and fa ( dti analysis ) with training - related changes in behavioural variables ( tactile braille word reading speed , tactile braille letter reading speed , visual braille word reading speed and visual braille word reading accuracy ; see behavioural result and methods ) and with age .
however , we did not detect any significant correlation , neither in the whole - brain analysis , nor in the roi analysis of the peripheral early visual cortex ( see supplementary figure s2 ) .
additionally , the roi approach was used to correlate training - related changes in grey matter volume and fa in the peripheral early visual cortex with each other .
these two variables were positively correlated ( r ( 27 ) = 0.618 , p < 0.001 ; supplementary figure s2 ) .
finally , we used resting - state fmri functional connectivity analysis to test whether the peripheral part of the early visual cortex is preferentially connected to somatosensory - motor cortices .
to this aim , we compared , in the experimental group , the before - training functional connectivity of the peripheral early visual cortex with the before - training functional connectivity of the central early visual cortex ( seed - to - whole - brain functional connectivity analysis ; see methods ) .
we found that , compared to its central counterpart , the peripheral early visual cortex is preferentially connected with numerous brain regions , including the insula , the inferior frontal gyrus , the parietal lobe and the cerebellum ( fig. 4a ; see also supplementary table s7 ). of particular importance to our hypotheses , we also observed preferential connectivity between the peripheral early visual cortex and somatosensory - motor cortices ( fig. 4a ; supplementary table s7 ) .
notably , this preferential connectivity was present already before the onset of the braille training .
we did not observe a change in the functional connectivity of peripheral early visual cortex following the training .
figure 4 the peripheral part of early visual cortex was preferentially connected to somatosensory and motor cortices even before the onset of braille training .

results are shown for the experimental ( a ) and control ( b ) groups .
thresholds : false discovery rate of q < 0.05 , cluster extent threshold of p < 0.05 .
the primary somatosensory cortex ( areas 1 , 2 , 3a and 3b ) is marked with light cyan .
the secondary somatosensory cortex ( areas 5 and 7 ) is marked with dark cyan .
masks of somatosensory areas were obtained from the anatomy spm toolbox .
to test for generality of effects observed in the resting - state fmri analysis in the experimental group , the same comparison between functional connectivity of the peripheral early visual cortex and functional connectivity of the central early visual cortex was performed in control subjects ( see methods ) .
using this independent dataset , we replicated results observed in the experimental group , particularly the preferential functional connectivity between the peripheral early visual cortex and somatosensory - motor cortices ( fig. 4b ; supplementary table s8 ) .
discussion to the best of our knowledge , this study is the first to describe the anatomical mechanisms associated with learning a skill that relies on cross - modal recruitment of a sensory cortex .
an increasing number of studies has been showing that convergence of information from different senses can occur not only in multisensory areas in temporal and parietal lobes36,37 , but at the level of primary sensory cortices as well38,39 .
such multisensory effects are particularly well - documented in the early visual cortex40 , and , in line with these results , non - human anatomical data indicates that early visual areas are monosynaptically connected with distant , non - visual regions , including auditory and somatosensory cortices41 - 43 .
this long - range connectivity was shown to be denser in the anterior part of the early visual cortex41,42 , which represents the peripheral visual field35 .
in our study , it is exactly the peripheral early visual cortex that underwent structural reorganization specifically linked to the tactile braille reading training ( see interaction analyses in figs 2c and 3d ) .
the effect was observed for both grey and white matter .
in the case of white matter , changes were observed mainly in radial diffusivity , which might suggest increased myelination44 - 46 ( see supplementary information for further discussion ) .
in addition , in line with earlier reports , resting - state fmri showed that the peripheral early visual cortex is preferentially connected to somatosensory and motor cortices even before the onset of braille training ( see also ref.47 ) .
this initial " connectivity bias " might have thus underlain the reorganization of this region described in our article ( see also7,48 ) .
previous notable studies have already reported functional recruitment of the early visual cortex for non - visual tasks .
following blindness , this region becomes critical for braille reading , language and memory49 - 52 .
in the sighted , studies report activations in the early visual cortex induced by tactile and auditory discrimination tasks23,53 - 59 .
following several days of blindfolding and tactile training , this region becomes necessary for recognition of single braille characters22 .
based on such reports , it was proposed that the early visual cortex can subserve spatial processing , regardless of the modality of input60 .
intensive training or sensory deprivation might lead to reweighting of visual and non - visual inputs that reach this region , which results in " unmasking " of non - visual activations .
our data are consistent with this hypothesis .
both a " connectivity bias " and the functional role of early visual cortex in spatial processing of braille characters might have contributed to the structural plasticity observed in our study .
as reich and colleagues13 have speculated , early visual areas might become involved in analysing simple geometrical features of individual braille letters .
in line with this interpretation , in our previous study on braille reading in sighted subjects , the activation of the early visual cortex was modulated by single braille letter recognition speed , but not by whole - word braille reading speed .
whole - word braille reading speed , in turn , modulated activity in higher - level ventral visual regions20 .
in our study , we also detected grey matter volume and fa decreases with time ( see figs 2a and 3a as well as supplementary tables s1 and s4 ) .
however , no interaction between the experimental group and the control group was observed , which suggests that most of observed decreases are likely to be associated with non - specific , physiological effects , such as ageing , which can be detected at timescales similar to the timescale of our study61 - 64 ( see also supplementary discussion ) .
in our previous study , we demonstrated that the ventral visual cortex becomes critical for braille reading in sighted adults20 .
here , we analysed the same group of subjects and showed that learning to read braille induces specific , anatomical reorganization in the peripheral early visual cortex .
based on our results , we hypothesize that this change reflects strengthened anatomical connectivity between visual and somatosensory cortices - a mechanism that is likely to support cross - modal recruitment of the visual cortex for tactile input .
in combination with previous studies , our data suggests that , as a results of training , tactile input might be first transferred from somatosensory to early visual cortices , most likely for detailed spatial analysis13,22,55,60 .
this information is then further processed in high - level visual areas , which have the capacity to process complex perceptual input and link it with meaning13,65 - 67 .
future studies should use methods sensitive to the temporal dynamics of brain computations , such as eeg or chronometric tms , to verify and further refine the model of training - induced cross - modal plasticity of visual cortices proposed here .
an alternative explanation of our results is that structural reorganization of the early visual cortex reflects visual imagery and is not directly linked to tactile input transfer and processing .
in this view , structural changes in the early visual cortex would be triggered by increased reliance on visual images of braille when one learns to read this script tactually .
while we cannot entirely exclude such an explanation , it is highly unlikely that visual imagery alone could account for structural changes observed in the early visual cortex .
our data show that reorganization specific to the braille training was observed only in the anterior part of this region , which represents the peripheral visual field35 .
yet , when read visually , braille characters are viewed in the central visual field , like any other script .
if visual imagery was behind the changes in the early visual cortex during the training , one should expect training - related effects centred on the representation of the central visual field .
the spatial location of the observed structural changes thus argues against the critical role of visual imagery .
moreover , in our previous fmri study on the same group of subjects , we showed that visual imagery itself cannot explain visual cortex activations during braille reading20 .
thus , converging evidence from functional and structural data suggests that changes in the visual cortex during braille training are indeed linked to tactile input transfer and processing .
it is interesting that braille training induced anatomical reorganization in the peripheral early visual cortex without inducing detectable changes in functional connectivity of the same region .
in our study , functional connectivity was calculated based on resting - state fmri data , which is likely to make this measure sensitive to relatively stable and unspecific features of functional networks , persisting even when no task is performed .
in contrast , our interpretation of results observed in this study assumes that detected anatomical changes support highly specific functional interactions between the early visual cortex and the somatosensory cortex , which occurs only during complex tactile activities ( see above ) .
such changes might not have direct consequences to resting - state functional connectivity patterns .
notably , in our previous study , we observed that braille training did induce a change in functional connectivity of the ventral visual cortex20 , which , as a relatively high - level cortical region , might have higher functional flexibility than the early visual cortex .
it is possible , that with time and additional training , also the early visual cortex would change its pattern of resting - state functional connections .
we also did not find correlations between training - induced anatomical reorganization and the behavioural outcomes of the training .
however , other studies5,68,69 also often fail to find such correlations , which suggests that the relationship between anatomical plasticity and behaviour might be more complex and perhaps mediated by other variables ( see also : ref.70 ) .
it might be the case that anatomical brain reorganization emerges from the interaction between multiple factors , such as the amount of training , its subjective hardness , objective behavioural outcomes and individual neuroplastic capabilities of the cortex .
there are several ways in which the transfer of tactile input from the somatosensory cortex to the peripheral early visual cortex could occur .
it could be thus achieved through polysynaptic pathways , leading to the visual system via multisensory regions in parietal lobes36,42 .
alternatively , tactile - induced recruitment of the visual cortex could be supported by direct connectivity between somatosensory and early visual cortices .
a strong and left - lateralized reorganization of white matter in the peripheral early visual cortex , observed in our study ( see fig. 3 ) , seems to support the latter .
indeed , white - matter pathways that directly link the primary somatosensory cortex and the early visual cortex were detected in rodents43,71 .
nevertheless , the existence of such connectivity in primates remains speculative72 .
in monkeys , one study reported direct connectivity between the peripheral early visual cortex and area pe , which is considered to be analogous to the human secondary somatosensory cortex42 .
however , it remains to be determined whether similar pathways exist in humans , and whether tactile - induced recruitment of the visual cortex is indeed supported by direct , monosynaptic connectivity .
whichever route , parietal of direct , turns out to be valid , we can nonetheless conclude that training in tactile braille reading induces anatomical reorganization in the visual cortex .
this suggests that the adult human brain can adapt its structural properties to support a global change in the cortical processing hierarchy and that this flexibility ( see also ref.73 ) might underlie the distinctively human capacity to efficiently learn complex skills .
methods subjects the experimental group included 29 subjects ( 26 females , 3 males ; mean age = 29.34 ; sd = 7.52 ; range = 22 - 49 ) , mostly braille educators and special educations studies' students , specializing in blindness and related disabilities .
before the study , they were familiar with reading visually presented braille , but unable to read it tactually ( see behavioural results ) .
all were right - handed , fluent in polish , had normal or corrected - to - normal vision and no neurological or psychiatric disorders .
all subjects underwent an mri session before the onset of nine - month braille training ( baseline session ) and immediately after its end ( after - training session ) .
nineteen subjects participated in a follow - up mri session nine months after the training had ended .
all declared that they had not trained in tactile braille reading after the training had ended .
data from the same subjects were reported in our previous studies20,33,34 .
in addition , 15 individuals ( 12 females , 3 males ; mean age = 25.53 ; sd = 3.30 ; range = 21 - 32 ) participated in the study as a longitudinal control group .
all were right - handed , fluent in polish , had normal or corrected - to - normal vision , no neurological or psychiatric disorders and no familiarity with tactile or visual braille reading .
the control group did not undergo training .
it was matched for age , sex and education to the experimental group ( all p > 0.05 ) .
the size of the control group was similar to the size of the experimental group at the follow - up session , for unbiased roi interaction analyses ( see statistical analysis section ) .
the control group was scanned twice : first at a baseline session and then in a follow - up session after 18 months .
the control - group scans corresponded with the baseline and follow - up sessions in the experimental group .
to test for generality of effects observed in the resting - state fmri functional connectivity analysis of the experimental group , we performed an additional resting - state fmri analysis on a separate control group of 31 subjects ( 17 females , 14 males ; mean age = 27.29 ; sd = 4.54 ; range = 19 - 37 ; due to time constraints , resting - state fmri data were not collected from the longitudinal control group ) .
the inclusion criteria were the same as in the longitudinal control group .
the research described in this paper was approved by the committee for research ethics of the institute of psychology of the jagiellonian university ( decision 28 / 06 / 2012 ) .
an informed consent and a consent to publish were obtained from each of the participants .
all experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations .
braille training and behavioural measures the experimental group underwent braille training and behavioural testing .
its details are reported elsewhere33,34 .
in short , the braille training lasted for nine months and was based on individual exercises to be performed while blindfolded .
the subjects were instructed to train for approximately 20 minutes each day on one a4 braille printout .
the progress in tactile braille reading was tested monthly , starting from the 5th month of the course to its end .
additionally , the same tests were performed also in the follow - up session .
subjects were blindfolded and asked to read tactually as many braille letters as possible in sixty seconds .
then , the same procedure was repeated for whole braille words .
subjects from the experimental group were familiar with visually presented braille at the beginning of the course .
during the course , they checked their tactile braille exercises visually , which constituted a form of visual braille reading training .
to control for potential improvements in visual braille reading , we measured its speed and accuracy with a lexical decision task ( detailed results in ref.34 ) .
subjects completed the lexical decision task on visual braille at the beginning and at the end ( i.e. , in the 9th month ) of the course .
they were instructed to visually read braille strings appearing on the screen for 8 seconds and decide , as fast and as accurately as possible , whether they formed a valid polish word or not and to indicate their choice with a mouse button .
mri and fmri data acquisition all data were acquired on the same siemens magnetom tim trio 3 t scanner with a 32 - channel head coil .
high - resolution t1 - weighted images were acquired using a mprage sequence ( 176 slices ; fov = 256 ; tr = 2530 ms ; te = 3.32 ms ; voxel size = 1 x 1 x 1 mm ) .
two sets of diffusion - weighted images ( 64 directions ; b - value = 1000 s / mm2 ; fov = 256 ; tr = 8700 ms , te = 92 ms ; voxel size = 2 x 2 x 2 mm ) , along with two images with no diffusion gradient applied ( b - value = 0 ) , were also acquired .
in addition to structural scans , resting - state fmri data were collected in the same scanning session .
a gradient - echo planar imaging sequence sensitive to blood - oxygen - level dependent contrast ( 282 volumes ; 33 contiguous axial slices ; tr = 2190 ms ; te = 30 ms ; voxel size = 3 x 3 x 3.6 mm ) was used .
during the resting - state fmri scan the subjects were asked to fix their gaze on the point displayed on the screen and to relax , but not fall asleep .
data preprocessing t1 - weighted images were preprocessed with vbm8 toolbox ( http :// dbm.neuro.uni - jena.de / vbm /) and spm8 software ( www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk ) .
we used the standard vbm8 longitudinal routine , including : 1 ) within - subject registration of all scanning time - points 2 ) intra - subject bias correction 3 ) segmentation of the different tissues classes 4 ) linear ( i.e. , affine ) and nonlinear ( i.e. , dartel ) registration and normalization to the mni space .
finally , the grey matter images were smoothed with a 6 mm fwhm gaussian kernel .
diffusion - weighted images were preprocessed with the tract - based spatial statistics approach ( tbss ) 74 implemented in the fsl 5.06 software ( fmrib software library , fmrib , oxford , uk ) 75 .
tbss is widely - used and reliable approach to analyse dti data across the whole - brain76,77 .
thanks to its automaticity , it overcomes many pitfalls of tractography - based methods ( see for example : 78 ) .
for each subject , diffusion - weighted images were affine registered to the first b0 image to correct for subject motion and eddy current induced distortion .
brain mask was created from the b0 image using bet79 .
next , the fdt toolbox80 was used to fit the tensor model and compute the fractional anisotropy ( fa ) , axial diffusivity ( ad ) and radial diffusivity ( rd ) maps81 .
further processing of the maps was optimized for longitudinal analysis82,83 .
first , the maps were smoothed with a 1 - voxel median filter to account for small , within - subject registration errors between time points and increase test - retest reliability .
next , subject - specific templates were created based on data from first two time points ( i.e. baseline and after - training in the experimental group , and baseline and follow - up in the control group ) for each subject , the maps from these time points were registered to each other and the halfway point was computed between pair of images .
the mean images were created by averaging the two registered images for each subject .
then , fa template images were non - linearly transformed on the mean fa template provided by fsl ( fmrib58 _ fa ) and then affine transformed on the standard mni space .
next , they were used to create the study - specific mean fa image which was skeletonized with a threshold fa > 0.2 to generate the white - matter tract skeleton representing tracts common to all subjects .
individual fa images from both time points were then projected onto the reference skeleton generated in the previous step .
finally , the registration matrices and skeleton projections obtained during processing of fa maps were applied to ad and rd maps .
for roi comparison between the follow - up scan and the baseline scan in the experimental group , these two time points were registered to each other using the same procedure .
the resting - state fmri data were preprocessed with the dparsf toolbox ( data processing assistant for resting - state fmri ) 84 and spm8 ( www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk ) .
the first ten volumes of each participant 's scan were discarded for signal stabilization and so that the participants could adapt to the noise of the scanner .
slice - timing correction and head - motion correction were then applied , t1 images were segmented , and both anatomical and functional images were normalized to mni space .
two steps specific to the functional connectivity analysis - regression of nuisance covariates and bandpass filtering - were performed to reduce spurious variance unlikely to reflect neuronal activity .
nuisance regression was performed first to avoid attenuation of the signal caused by mismatch in the frequencies of the data and regressors85 .
nuisance variables included : a ) white matter signal ; b ) cerebrospinal fluid signal ; c ) 24 head motion parameters : 6 parameters of the current volume , 6 of the preceding volume and a quadratic term for each of these values86 ( see also87,88 ) ; and d ) a separate regressor for every volume that displayed a mean frame displacement value higher than 0.589 .
given that global signal regression can disturb meaningful signal90 - 92 , we did not include global signal as a regressor .
after the regression of nuisance covariates , a bandpass filter ( 0.01 - 0.08 hz ) was applied .
the resulting images were smoothed with a 5 mm fwhm gaussian kernel .
the functional connectivity measure ( fc ) was then calculated according to standard procedures .
for each seed , subject and scan , we computed a voxel - wise correlation of time courses between seed regions and the rest of the brain .
these correlation maps were next transformed into fisher 's z value maps , which were subsequently used in the statistical analysis .
statistical analysis similar statistical analyses were applied to vbm and dti data .
in the case of vbm , parametric paired t - tests were applied to compare baseline , after - training and follow - up scans in the experimental group as well as baseline and follow - up scans in the longitudinal control group across the whole - brain .
when necessary , the whole - brain interactions between groups were tested in 2 x 2 anovas , with scanning session as a within - subject factor and group as a between - subject factor .
these comparisons were assigned a false discovery rate threshold of q < 0.0593 and an additional cluster - extent threshold of p < 0.05 .
in the case of dti , the same comparisons were performed with permutation ( i.e. , non - parametric ) paired t - tests , implemented in the fsl randomise utility94 .
given that permutation tests were shown to be more robust than their parametric counterparts95 , and that only small subset of voxels were included in the dti comparisons ( i.e. , only voxels in which fa > 0.2 - see data preprocessing ) , a more lenient voxel - wise threshold was assigned , namely p < 0.001 .
results that survived this voxel - wise threshold were then corrected for multiple comparisons using a cluster extent threshold of p < 0.05 .
in addition , for illustrative purposes , we plotted individual grey matter volume ( fig. 2b ) and fa changes ( fig. 3b ) in the experimental group in the early visual clusters detected in the whole - brain analysis ( grey matter volume change cluster size : 1760 voxels ; peak mni = - 11 - 69 12 ; fa change cluster size : 212 voxels ; peak mni = - 12 - 75 1 see supplementary tables s1 and s4 ) .
note that this was done only to assess between - subject consistency of observed effects and no statistical conclusions can be inferred from this particular analysis , since this particular roi selection was not fully orthogonal to the data presented96 .
the obtained individual values were also correlated with each other , as well as with subjects' age and behavioural variables - training - related changes ( performance at baseline session subtracted from the performance in the after - training session ) in tactile braille word reading speed , tactile braille letter reading speed and , as a control analyses , visual braille word reading speed and visual braille word reading accuracy ( supplementary figure s2 ) .
to test for correlation between anatomical and behavioural changes at the whole - brain level , above - mentioned behavioural variables were also included in regression models , with training - related changes in grey matter volume or fa as dependent variables ( scans from the baseline session subtracted from the scans in the after - training session ; the same statistical thresholds as in other whole - brain analyses were used - see above ) .
based on the results of the whole - brain analyses and our apriori expectation to find training - induced changes in the visual cortex , a region - of - interest ( roi ) analysis ( figs 2c and 3d ) was then conducted to describe the time - course of anatomical changes in the early visual cortex and to test whether this reorganization is specific to the experimental group .
to avoid double - dipping96,97 , the rois were defined based on the after - training vs. baseline contrast in 10 braille learners who did not participate in the follow - up session .
then , only the remaining 19 subjects from the experimental group and the participants in the longitudinal control group were tested .
thus , definition of rois and further analysis were performed on independent datasets .
rois were defined as 10 mm x 10 mm cubes centred on peaks of increase in grey matter ( for vbm ) or fa ( for dti ) in the left hemisphere , following the training .
in the case of dti , the roi was further constrained by including only voxels in which fa > 0.2 ( i.e. , excluding voxels with no data - see data preprocessing ) .
in the resting - state fmri functional connectivity analysis , we compared the functional connectivity of two seeds : the peripheral and the central part of the early visual cortex .
the analysis was performed on two datasets : before - training data from the experimental group and data from the control group of 31 subjects that were not familiar with braille reading , neither in tactile nor in visual modality ( see subjects section ) .
seed definitions were based on the early visual cortex mask ( v1 and v2 masks combined ) , as implemented in the anatomy spm toolbox98 .
in line with the principle of retinotopic organization of the early visual cortex35 , the peripheral seed was defined as the anterior part of the mask ( i.e. , all voxels anterior to y = - 85 mni coordinate were included ) .
the central seed was defined as the remaining , posterior part of the same mask ( all voxels posterior to y = - 85 mni coordinate ) .
the functional connectivity patterns of these two seeds were then compared with a parametric paired t - test .
the comparison was assigned a false discovery rate threshold of q < 0.05 and an additional cluster - extent threshold of p < 0.05 .
importantly , defining peripheral and central seeds based on different mni coordinates ( e.g. , boundary at y = - 80 or y = - 90 ) did not significantly change the outcome .
all key comparisons in our study were performed in a repeated - measure design , in which each subject is his / her own control .
thus , the between - subject variability in demographic measures or behavioural outcomes of the braille training did not affect findings reported in the study .

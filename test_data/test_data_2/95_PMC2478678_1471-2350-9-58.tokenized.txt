background brca2 germ - line mutations predispose to breast and ovarian cancer .
mutations are widespread and unclassified splice variants are frequently encountered .
we describe the parental origin and functional characterization of a novel de novo brca2 splice site mutation found in a patient exhibiting a ductal carcinoma at the age of 40 .
methods variations were identified by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography ( dhplc ) and sequencing of the brca1 and brca2 genes .
the effect of the mutation on splicing was examined by exon trapping in cos - 7 cells and by rt - pcr on rna isolated from whole blood .
the paternity was determined by single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) microarray analysis .
parental origin of the de novo mutation was determined by establishing mutation - snp haplotypes by variant specific pcr , while de novo and mosaic status was investigated by sequencing of dna from leucocytes and carcinoma tissue .
results a novel brca2 variant in the splice donor site of exon 21 ( nucleotide 8982 + 1 g - - > a / c.8754 + 1 g - - > a ) was identified .
exon trapping showed that the mutation activates a cryptic splice site 46 base pairs 3 ' of exon 21 , resulting in the inclusion of a premature stop codon and synthesis of a truncated brca2 protein .
the aberrant splicing was verified by rt - pcr analysis on rna isolated from whole blood of the affected patient .
the mutation was not found in any of the patient 's parents or in the mother 's carcinoma , showing it is a de novo mutation .
variant specific pcr indicates that the mutation arose in the male germ - line .
conclusion we conclude that the novel brca2 splice variant is a de novo mutation introduced in the male spermatozoa that can be classified as a disease causing mutation .
background germ - line brca2 ( mim # 600185 ) mutations in female carriers confer a lifetime risk exceeding 80 % for breast cancer and 20 % for ovarian cancer , and a moderate increased risk of other cancer types [ 1,2 ] .
studies have indicated that the risk of ovarian cancer is greatest in women with brca2 mutations localized in nucleotides 3035 - 6629 [ 3,4 ] .
several genes are likely to be involved in breast cancer predisposition , but no susceptibility gene aside brca2 and brca1 is likely to account for a large fraction or a major increase in risk [ 5 ] .
the brca2 gene spans approximately 70 kb and is composed of 27 exons , which encodes a protein of 3418 amino acids .
brca2 is involved in homologous recombination [ 6,7 ] , but is also suggested to play a role in transcriptional regulation [ 8 ] and cell cycle control [ 9 ] .
mutations are distributed throughout the entire coding region of brca2 and to date numerous deleterious mutations have been reported ( breast cancer information core [ bic ] ; [ 10 ]) .
the majority of patients with brca1 or brca2 associated breast and / or ovarian cancer have a family history , although healthy male carriers may obscure the apparent dominant trait .
several brca2 founder mutations have been identified , including the ashkenazi jewish nucleotide 6174delt mutation and the icelandic nucleotide 999del5 mutation [ 11,12 ] .
in contrast , only two mutations in brca2 and one in brca1 have been reported as de novo mutations [ 13 - 15 ] , but since a positive family history is one of the criteria for mutation screening , it is possible that we overlook a number of patients with these mutations .
here we report the functional characterization of a novel de novo brca2 splice site mutation located in the intervening sequence ( ivs ) of exon 21 ( nucleotide 8982 + 1 g - - > a / c.8754 + 1 g - - > a ) in a danish breast cancer patient with a family history of breast cancer .
the parental origin of the mutation is assigned to the father .
methods patients family b49363 is a 23 member , three - generation kindred with two affected subjects .
a 40 year old woman was referred to genetic counseling two months after she had breast - conserving surgery at roskilde county hospital with radical excision of an 8 mm large invasive ductal carcinoma .
the tumor was estrogen and progesterone receptor positive and had malignancy grade ii. the patient received adjuvant radiotherapy followed by seven series of chemotherapy with cef and tamoxifen .
the patient 's mother had a mastectomy at age 59 with excision of a 22 mm large estrogen and progesterone receptor positive invasive ductal carcinoma , malignancy grade ii , and postoperatively she received tamoxifen .
following verbal and written consent , blood and tumour samples were collected from the proband for mutation screening and after renewed consent a third blood sample was collected for rna analysis .
moreover , blood and tumour samples from the patient 's mother , and blood samples from the patient 's father and sister were collected .
the family history was verified using the registry of the dbcg ( danish breast cancer cooperative group ) , hospital medical records and pathology reports , and genetic counselling was provided for each family member .
since the study is part of normal diagnostic procedures no ethical approval was obtained .
the study was conducted in accordance with the helsinki declaration .
brca1 and brca2 screening genomic dna was purified from whole blood using the qiaamp dna mini kit ( qiagen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
brca1 and brca2 were amplified using intronic primer pairs flanking each exon .
pcr products were pre - screened by dhplc ( denaturing high performance liquid chromatography ) using the wawe system ( transgenomic ) and sequenced using an abi3730 dna analyzer ( applied biosystems ) .
sequence variations were verified in a new blood sample .
moreover genomic dna was examined by mlpa analysis ( mrc - holland ) .
the brca1 variant is numbered according to genbank accession number u14680 , in which the a in the aug start codon has number 120 , whereas the brca2 variant is numbered according to genbank accession number nc _ 000059 , in which a in the aug start codon has number 229 .
moreover , the brca1 and brca2 variants are numbered according to genbank accession number nc _ 000017.9 and nc _ 000013.9 using the guidelines from the human genetic variation society [ 16 ] .
vector constructs the pspl3 vector was obtained from gibco - brl .
pspl3 - brca2 - wild - type and pspl3 - brca2 - mutant plasmids , containing brca2 exon 21 and flanking intron sequences , were constructed by pcr using purified dna from human blood samples and the following oligonucleotides : brca2 - f , 5 ' - gatcacgaattcttcctggaaaacttatagca - 3 ' and brca2 - r 5 ' - gatcacctcgagttagggtagaggattatcaagtaca - 3 ' .
the pcr products were treated with ecori and xhoi and cloned into the pspl3 vector .
all constructs were verified by sequencing .
cell culture and transfections cos - 7 cells were cultured in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) containing 4500 mg / l glucose supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum , 100 u of penicillin per ml , and 100 mug of streptomycin per ml at 5 % co2 and 37degreesc .
one day before transfection , cells were seeded in 6 - well culture dishes at a density of 4 x 105 cells / well .
cells were transfected with a total of 4 mug plasmid dna using fugene 6 transfection reagent ( roche ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
transfection efficiencies for each series were determined by cotransfection of pegfp plasmid ( clontech ) .
the next day the media was changed and after another 24 h the cells were harvested and total rna was isolated using trizol reagent ( invitrogen ) .
exon trapping analysis first strand cdna was synthesized using 1 mug rna , 20 mum sa2 primer ( 5 ' - atctcagtggtatttgtgagc - 3 ') and m - mulv reverse transcriptase ( new england biolabs ) .
the cdnas were amplified with pspl3 vector - specific primers ( 5 ' - tctgagtcacctggacaacc - 3 ' and 5 ' - atctcagtggtatttgtgagc - 3 ') and the pcr products were resolved on a 2 % agarose gel .
all experiments were repeated three times .
rna analysis a fresh blood sample was obtained from the patient .
total cellular rna was isolated with trizol ( invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
for reverse transcription - pcr ( rt - pcr ) , cdna was synthesized using the amv reverse transcriptase ( promega ) as described by the supplier .
the cdna were amplified with the brca2 specific primers 5 ' - cggcctgctcgctggtat - 3 ' and 5 ' - gccttcctaatttccaactggatctg - 3 ' resulting in a 503 bp fragment .
the samples were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining .
finally , the bands were purified , cloned into pcr - blunt ii - topo ( invitrogen ) and sequenced using an abi3730 dna analyzer ( applied biosystems ) .
snp chip analysis genomic dna was applied to 250k styi (~ 238.000 snps ) snp - microarray chips and processed according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( affymetrix , uk ) .
briefly , 250 ng of genomic dna was digested with styi and ligated to adapters .
adapter - ligated dna was amplified , purified , fragmented and labeled with biotin and hybridized to the arrays for 18 h. the affymetrix 450 fluidics station and the affymetrix 3000 g7 gene scanner were used to wash , stain , and scan the arrays .
the cel files were analysed using the brlmm algorithm from affymetrix genotyping analysis software ( gtype ) .
relationship was inferred by estimating the pairwise identical by descent ( ibd ) sharing , as described [ 17 ] .
assignment of parental origin variant specific primers were designed using the software primer3 in combination with clustaiw alignments .
the primer sets distinguish the wild - type allele ( brca2 c.8754 + 1 - g forward : 5 ' - agacccagcttaccttgacg - 3 ') from the mutation carrying allele ( brca2 c.8754 + 1 - a forward : 5 ' - cagacccagcttaccttgaaa - 3 ') , and the two snp alleles in rs4942485 ( rs4942485 * a reverse : 5 ' - ctacattacagatggctaatatctgatt - 3 ' and rs4942485 * g reverse : 5 ' - cattacagatggctaatatctgaac - 3 ' .
primer sets were tested on homozygote controls and unspecific annealing was avoided after introducing mismatches ( marked in bold ) .
pcr was carried out using standard conditions according to the manufacturer 's protocols using the expand high fidelityplus taq dna polymerase ( roche ) .
allele sizes were : brca2 c.8754 + 1 - g and rs942485 - g = 2297 bp , brca2 c.8754 + 1 - * a and rs942485 - g = 2298 bp , brca2 c.8754 + 1 - g and rs942485 - a = 2300 bp , brca2 c.8754 + 1 - * a and rs942485 - a = 2301 bp. results and discussion the patient was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40 .
since her mother had breast cancer at the age of 59 ( fig. 1 ) , the patient was referred to genetic counselling .
no other family members had breast or ovarian cancer .
we analysed the entire coding region and the exon - intron boundaries of brca1 and brca2 from genomic dna by dhplc and sequencing and for large genomic rearrangements by mlpa analysis .
the analysis revealed a polymorphism in exon 11 of brca1 ( nucleotide 1186 a - - > g / c.1067 a - - > g ) , which is observed in approximately 5 % of a control group [ 18 ] , and a nucleotide 8982 + 1 g - - > a / c.8754 + 1 g - - > a mutation in brca2 that has not previously been reported in the bic database ( fig. 2 ) .
the mutation occurs at the first base of the conserved gu splice donor site of intron 21 .
the mutation was verified in a second blood sample as well as in breast cancer tumour tissue .

figure 2 identification of the brca2 nucleotide 8982 + 1 g - - > a / c.8754 + 1 g - - > a variant .
dna was purified from whole blood and brca2 exon 21 was amplified using the primers 5 ' - ctttgggtgttttatgcttgt - 3 ' and 5 ' - ctggcacatcactgaaaatc - 3 ' and sequenced .
the analysis revealed a nucleotide 8982 + 1 g - - > a / c.8754 + 1 g - - > a mutation in brca2 ( sense strand ) .
the nucleotide 8982 + 1 g - - > a / c.8754 + 1 g - - > a mutation and the cryptic splice site are underlined .
to functionally characterize the brca2 nucleotide 8982 + 1 g - - > a / c.8754 + 1 g - - > a variant , a fragment containing brca2 exon 21 ( 122 bp ) , 449 bp of intron 20 ( ivs20 ) and 408 bp of intron 21 ( ivs21 ) containing the wild - type or the nucleotide 8982 + 1 g - - > a / c.8754 + 1 g - - > a variant , respectively , was cloned into the minigene vector pspl3 containing exons from hiv - tat under the control of the sv40 promoter ( fig. 3a ) [ 19 ] .
constructs containing either the wild - type or the mutant ivs21 sequence was transfected into cos - 7 cells .
after 48 hours mrna was purified and examined by rt - pcr .
the splicing products were separated on a 2 % agarose gel .
the wild - type construct yields a product of 299 bp and a product of 177 bp if exon 21 is excluded from the transcript ( exon skipping ) .
moreover a larger product than 299 bp would demonstrate that additional intron sequence is included in the transcript .
the normal wild - type brca2 exon 21 ( pspl3 - brca2 - wt ) generated one transcript comprising the expected 299 bp , while the brca2 nucleotide 8982 + 1 g - - > a / c.8754 + 1 g - - > a mutant ( pspl3 - brca2 - mut ) yielded a band with slightly higher mobility ( fig. 3b ) .
sequencing revealed , that it contained an additional 46 bp from intron 21 generating a transcript of 345 bp ( fig. 3c ) , indicating that it activates a cryptic splice site following these 46 bp ( fig. 1 ) .
to provide direct evidence for the aberrant splicing , rna was isolated from whole blood of the affected patient and rt - pcr was performed before the products were analysed on a 1 % agarose gel ( fig. 4 ) .
two pcr products - one with the expected size of the wild - type ( 503 bp ) and an additional rt - pcr product ( 549 bp ) - were amplified from the patient .
cloning and sequence analysis of the latter verified the inclusion of 46 bp of intron 21 ( data not shown ) .

( b ) cos - 7 cells were transfected with pspl3 - brca2 - exon 21 wild - type or pspl3 - brca2 - exon 21 mutant plasmids .
total rna was isolated , rt - pcr analysis was performed and the pcr products ( in duplicates ) were resolved on a 2 % agarose gel .
the 299 bp product corresponds to wild - type exon 21 ( unaltered splicing ) , while the 345 bp product corresponds to exon 21 and the inclusion of 46 bp of intron 21 .
the sizes of the dna marker are indicated to the right .

figure 4 rt - pcr was performed on rna purified from whole blood from the proband .
the cdna was amplified with specific brca2 primers .
the sample was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining .
two rt - pcr products ( 503 bp and 549 bp ) were obtained from the patient ( lane 1 ) .
the sizes of the dna marker are indicated to the left .
the pcr products were cloned and sequence analysis revealed that the 549 bp band contained the inclusion of 46 bp of intron 21 ( data not shown ) .
we examined the patient 's mother , who was affected with the same type of breast cancer at the age of 59 years , for the same mutation , but she did not have this mutation in either dna purified from blood or breast cancer tumour samples .
therefore mosaicism was excluded .
moreover , the father and the patient 's sister did not carry the mutation .
to establish the paternity we performed a snp microarray analysis using 250k sty gene array ( affymetrix ) .
the analysis provided the relatedness estimates ( table 1 ) , where k0 is the probability that pairs of individuals at a random loci share no allele identical by descent ( ibd ) , k1 is the probability that pairs of individuals at a random loci share one allele ibd , and k2 the probability that pairs of individuals at a random loci share two allele ibd .
the expected relatedness for full siblings is k0 = 0.25 , k1 = 0.5 , k2 = 0.25 , for parent offspring k0 = 0 , k1 = 1 , k2 = 0 , for unrelated k0 = 1 , k1 = 0 , k2 = 0 , which in all cases fits in this family .
we therefore conclude that the identified mutation in the proband is a de novo mutation in brca2 .
in contrast to the previously identified de novo brca2 nucleotide 3034del4 and brca1 nucleotide 3888delga mutations [ 14,15 ] , the mutation reported in our study resides in a new position not previously reported in the bic database .
this was also the case with the brca2 nucleotide 7260insa mutation [ 13 ] .
several other variants have been detected in the vicinity of the splice donor site in exon 21 , including nucleotide 8982 g - - > a / c.8754 g - - > a ( reported once ) , nucleotide 8982 + 1 a - - > g / c.8754 + 4 a - - > g ( reported seven times ) , nucleotide 8982 + 5 g - - > a / c.8754 + 5 g - - > a ( reported once ) and nucleotide 8982 + 5 g - - > t / c.8754 + 5 g - - > t ( reported once ) , suggesting that this region could be prone to mutations .
table 1 relatedness estimates .
individual individual k0 k1 k2 relationship 1 2 0.23 0.49 0.28 full siblings 1 3 0.01 0.99 0.00 parent offspring 1 4 0.01 0.99 0.00 parent offspring 2 3 0.01 0.98 0.01 parent offspring 2 4 0.01 0.99 0.01 parent offspring 3 4 0.98 0.02 0.00 unrelated relationship was infered by estimating the pairwise identical by descent ( ibd ) sharing as described in [ 17 ] .
k0 is the probality that pairs of individuals at a random loci share no allele ibd , k1 the probality that pairs of individuals at a random loci share one allele ibd , and k2 the probality that pairs of individuals at a random loci share two allele ibd .
the expected relatedness for full siblings is k0 = 0.25 , k1 = 0.5 , k2 = 0.25 , for parent offspring k0 = 0 , k1 = 1 , k2 = 0 , and for unrelated k0 = 1 , k1 = 0 , k2 = 0 .
the individual number is indicated in figure 1 .
to determine the parental origin of the mutation , variant specific pcr was performed using primers designed to distinguish between two snp alleles and the mutation carrying allele from the wild - type allele .
the father was homozygote for the haplotype gg , while the mother was homozygote for the haplotype ga ( see fig. 1 ) .
pcr analysis of the proband revealed a band using mutant brca2 and rs4942485 * g primers , indicating that the haplotype * ag must derive from the father , and that the mutation therefore arose in the testicular germ cells changing brca2 nucleotide 8982 + 1 / c.8754 + 1 from g to a. this is in agreement with previous findings in brca1 [ 14 ] , whereas the studies describing de novo mutations in brca2 were unable to determine parental origin [ 13,15 ] .
examinations of other cancer families , including men2b and retinoblastoma families have indicated that de novo mutations primarily occur in the male germ line [ 20,21 ] and that the fathers age is a major determinant since mutations accumulate during life [ 22 ] .
it is , however , noteworthy that the age of the probands parents in our study was only 19 and 21 years at the time of birth of their affected daughter .
conclusion we conclude that the brca2 nucleotide 8982 + 1 g - - > a / c.8754 + 1 g - - > a mutation is a de novo mutation arising from the male germ line .
the mutation is not previously reported in the bic database .
it leads to the activation of a cryptic splice site 46 base pairs 3 ' of exon 21 and introduces a premature stop codon and thereby a truncated brca2 protein .
therefore , this mutation can be classified as a disease - causing mutation .
analysis of intronic brca1 and brca2 variants by functional splicing assays can provide information that can be used clinically .

purpose eribulin , a synthetic analog of the natural product halichondrin b , is a microtubule dynamics inhibitor .
in this study , we report the pharmacokinetic profiles of eribulin in mice , rats , and dogs following intravenous administrations with optimized and validated bio - analytical methods .
methods eribulin was administered at 0.5 and 2 mg / kg in mice , 0.5 and 1 mg / kg in rats , and 0.08 mg / kg in dogs .
tumor and brain penetration of eribulin was also evaluated in lox human melanoma xenograft models .
concentrations in plasma , tumor , and brain were measured by the lc - ms / ms method .
results the profiles of eribulin were characterized by extensive distribution , moderate clearance , and slow elimination in the three species .
the pharmacokinetics are linear in mice and rats .
in xenograft mice , the penetration into the brain was low , as expected , since eribulin is a p - glycoprotein substrate .
in contrast to disposition in brain , the exposure of eribulin was approximately 20 - 30 times higher in tumor than that in plasma and half - lives were 17.8 - 35.9 h after both single and multiple dose regimens .
conclusions eribulin was distributed rapidly and eliminated slowly in mice , rats , and dogs .
the exposure of eribulin was approximately 20 - 30 times higher in tumor than in plasma in xenograft mice .
these results might be caused by eribulin 's mechanism of action including increased perfusion in tumor by vascular remodeling effect .
keywords eribulin tumor pharmacokinetics xenograft issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer - verlag gmbh germany 2017 introduction eribulin ( fig. 1 ) , a synthetic analog of the natural product halichondrin b , is currently being used as an anti - cancer agent .
eribulin has sub - nanomolar growth inhibitory activities in vitro against numerous human cancer cell lines as well as marked in vivo activities at 0.1 - 1 mg / kg against human xenografts via irreversible mitotic blockade [ 1 , 2 ] .
eribulin 's mode of action is distinct from other tubulin inhibitors , and it involves binding to specific sites on the growing positive ends of microtubules to inhibit their growth [ 2 - 4 ] .
eribulin also induces vascular remodeling , suppresses migration and invasion of cancer cells , and reverses the epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition in cancer cell lines [ 5 - 7 ]. fig. 1 chemical structures of eribulin and is. a eribulin .
molecular weight 729.90 .
b is. molecular weight 730.88 eribulin has been approved for treatment of metastatic breast cancer who has previously received at least two chemotherapeutic regimens including an anthracyclines and a taxane and unresectable or metastatic liposarcoma who have received a prior anthracycline - containing regimen in the us. phase iii trials revealed improvement in overall survival in such patients treated with eribulin , compared with the conventional treatments [ 8 - 10 ] .
pharmacokinetic ( pk ) profiles of eribulin have been reported in clinical studies .
the pk profile of eribulin was characterized by an extensive volume of distribution , slow - to - moderate clearance , and slow elimination .
area under the plasma concentration versus time curve ( auc ) and maximum plasma concentration ( c max ) increased in almost direct proportion to the dose of eribulin ( 0.25 - 4 mg / m2 ) [ 11 - 13 ] .
a mass balance study with radiolabeled eribulin in patients with advanced solid tumors showed that more than 80 % of administered radioactivity was excreted in feces , where unchanged eribulin was 61.9 % , whereas renal excretion of eribulin was 8.9 % [ 14 ] .
these results indicate that metabolism and renal clearance contribute to the elimination of eribulin in a minor way .
preclinical studies have shown that higher brain penetration of eribulin was observed in atp - binding cassette subfamily b ( abcb ) member 1a - deficient mice , a subpopulation that naturally lacks the abcb1a - encoded p - glycoprotein ( p - gp ) , compared with the wild - type mice , suggesting that eribulin is likely to be a p - gp substrate [ 15 ] .
the efficacy and toxicity of anti - cancer drugs in the treatment of tumors are highly dependent on the ability of the drugs to distribute into tumor tissue at the optimal therapeutic dose .
in a preclinical study , eribulin exhibited wide in vivo therapeutic windows [ 1 ] .
in phase ii and iii clinical studies , eribulin showed a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer compared with treatment of physician 's choice [ 8 ] , with manageable safety profiles .
the most common grade 3 / 4 adverse events ( ae ) were neutropenia ( 45.2 %) , leukopenia ( 13.9 %) , and asthenia / fatigue ( 8.8 %) .
although peripheral neuropathy was a common ae leading to treatment discontinuation , the peripheral neuropathy typically improved in later cycles .
thus , eribulin showed balanced profile of efficacy and safety in preclinical and clinical settings .
there has not been a report of preclinical pk profiles of eribulin in tumor - bearing mice or in other preclinical species .
in this study , pk profiles of eribulin in mice , rats , and dogs following intravenous administration were investigated with optimized and validated bio - analytical methods .
in addition , brain and tumor penetration of eribulin were evaluated in a xenograft model to further characterize anti - tumor activity in terms of its disposition .
materials and methods chemicals and reagents eribulin and the internal standard ( is , er076349 ) were synthesized at eisai research institute ( eri , andover , ma ) ( fig. 1 ) .
all reagents used in this study were of analytical grade .
mouse , rat , and beagle control plasma containing edta as the anticoagulant were purchased from bioreclamationivt ( westbury , ny ) , cocalico biologicals inc .
( reamstown , pa ) , or biological specialty corp .
( colmar , pa ) .
pk studies in mice , rats , and dogs male balb / c mice ( 22 - 24 g ) and jugular vein cannulated male sprague - dawley rats ( 226 - 250 g ) were purchased from charles river laboratories ( wilmington , ma ) .
male purebred beagle dogs ( approximately 8 kg and 6 - 8 months old ) were selected from the stock colony in covance ( princeton , nj ) .
dosing solutions of eribulin were freshly prepared by dissolving eribulin in deionized water , and administered intravenously via tail veins in mice and rats and cephalic veins in dogs .
the doses studied were 0.5 and 2 mg / kg in mice , 0.5 and 1 mg / kg in rats , and 0.08 mg / kg in dogs .
according to the conversion of doses based on body surface area [ 16 ] , the doses in this study would be equivalent to the 1.4 mg / m2 clinical dose of eribulin .
blood specimens were collected from each species at predetermined time points ( 5 , 15 , 30 min , and 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , and 48 h for mice ; 5 , 7.5 , 10 , 15 , 25 , 40 min , and 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 , and 48 h for rats ; 5 , 7.5 , 10 , 15 , 25 , 40 min , and 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 , and 48 h for dogs ) and stored in tubes containing sodium edta as anticoagulant .
plasma levels of eribulin from all species were determined by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry ( lc - ms / ms ) .
all the studies using laboratory animals were approved either by the eisai ( andover , ma ) institutional animal care and use committees ( iacucs ) or the iacuc of the contract research organization that conducted the study , and adhered to all of the applicable institutional and governmental guidelines for the humane care and use of laboratory animals .
tumor and brain penetration in xenograft model tumor and brain penetration of eribulin was evaluated in lox human melanoma xenograft models as previously described [ 1 ] .
in brief , female ncr lox tumor - bearing nu / nu mice ( n = 3 / time point / dose group ) were given a single 1.0 or 2.0 mg / kg intravenous dose of eribulin or 0.5 or 1.0 mg / kg intravenously once every 2 days for three doses ( q2dx3 ) .
blood , tumor , and brain tissues were collected from each animal at predetermined time points ( 15 , 30 min , and 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , and 36 h postdose ) .
concentrations of eribulin in brain , tumor , and plasma were determined by lc - ms / ms. analysis of plasma samples analysis of eribulin in mouse , rat , and dog plasma was performed using a validated lc - ms / ms method with modifications for human plasma as previously described [ 17 ] .
in brief , an aliquot of plasma sample was mixed with 500 ng / ml of is and extracted with a c8 spe cartridge .
the eluent was collected and evaporated to dryness in a 35 degreesc water bath under nitrogen , and then reconstituted with methanol , water , and formic acid ( 50:50:1 ; by volume ) .
each sample was analyzed on a quattro ultima micromass triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ( micromass limited , beverly , ma ) using electrospray ionization under positive ion mode .
eribulin was monitored at precursor ion as a mass - to - charge ratio ( m / z ) at 730.4 and product ion m / z at 712.5 , and is was monitored at precursor ion m / z at 731.4 and product ion m / z at 681.5 .
mobile phases a and b consisted of acetonitrile , water , and formic acid ( 13:87:0.1 ; by volume ) , and acetonitrile , tetrahydrofuran , and formic acid ( 70:30:0.1 ; by volume ) , respectively .
aliquots were injected onto a c18 metachem polaris 3 mum , 30 mm x 2.0 mm column ( agilent , santa clara , ca ) .
retention times for eribulin and is were 4.2 and 4.5 min , respectively .
calibration and quality control standards were freshly prepared in each analytical run using appropriate blank plasma .
peak areas of eribulin and is were calculated and integrated using quanlynx 3.5 ( micromass limited ; beverly , ma ) .
analysis of brain and tumor samples lc - ms / ms analyses of eribulin in brain and tumor samples were performed .
in brief , tumor or brain tissue was prepared by homogenizing the specimen with three times its weight of phosphate - buffered saline using a polytron pt 1200 tissue homogenizer ( kinematica ag , lucern , switzerland ) .
the brain or tumor homogenate was vortexed with is and 0.1 n sodium hydroxide in a polypropylene tube .
following addition of nano - pure water and further mixing , a solution of ethyl acetate , methanol , and ethanol ( 90:5:5 , by volume ) was added into the mixture , shaken horizontally , and then centrifuged at 4 degreesc .
an aqueous phase of the mixture was frozen in a dry ice / isopropyl alcohol bath to retrieve the organic phase .
the collected organic phase was transferred to a polypropylene tube and dried under nitrogen at 35 degreesc .
the residue was then reconstituted with methanol / water ( 1:1 , by volume ) containing 0.1 % formic acid .
a shimadzu co - sense high - performance liquid chromatography system ( shimadzu scientific instruments , columbia , md ) was used for gradient elution of eribulin .
aliquots were injected onto a polaris c18 - a column ( 30 mm x 2.0 mm ) with a constant temperature of 30 degreesc .
retention times for eribulin and is were approximately 4.5 min and 4.6 min , respectively .
detection of the eluents was conducted using an api4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ( sciex , framingham , ma ) using electrospray ionization under positive ion mode .
eribulin was monitored at precursor ion m / z 730.5 and product ion m / z 712.5 , and the is was monitored at precursor ion m / z 731.5 and product ion m / z 681.5 .
pk analysis pk parameters of eribulin were estimated through noncompartmental analysis using winnonlin 4.0.1 ( certara , princeton , nj ) .
eribulin plasma concentrations below the quantification limit were left blank at time 0 and treated as 0 at other time points .
nominal time was used for all analyses with the exception of actual time deviations greater than 10 % for sampling time prior to 24 h , or 1 h for sampling time post 24 h. the actual time was used for those cases .
for mice pk , the parameters were calculated based on mean concentration of each time point , because the blood at each point was collected from independent animals .
plasma concentrations and pk parameters of eribulin are expressed as mean or mean +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) using excel 2000 ( microsoft , redmond , wa ) in rats and dogs .
penetration of eribulin into tumor and brain was assessed by the tumor penetration index ( tpi ) and brain penetration index ( bpi ) , respectively , which were calculated as the ratio of the auc in the tumor or brain to that in the plasma .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using sigmastat 2.03 ( spss inc. ; chicago , il ) .
one - way analysis of variance was used to examine the concentration effects on pk parameters among groups with p value less than 0.05 considered statistically significant .
outliers when applicable were rejected based on the dixon 's criteria [ 18 ] .
results linearity and lower limit of quantification plasma levels of eribulin were linear from 0.5 to 500 ng / ml for all species studied .
regression coefficients of the calibration curves were greater than 0.979 in all matrices investigated .
the quantification limit was 0.5 ng / ml for plasma and 2 ng / g for tumor and brain , with the exception of the multiple dose study , which was 4.0 ng / g for brain samples .

in mice , the volume of distribution at the steady state ( v ss ) of eribulin in mice was 6.44 or 12.2 l / kg when administered at 0.5 or 2 mg / kg , respectively .
the v ss at 0.5 mg / kg might be underestimated , because the profile was not characterized properly .
in rats , the mean v ss averaged 36.3 or 44.1 l / kg when 0.5 or 1 mg / kg of eribulin , respectively , was administered , with no statistical difference between the two doses ( p = 0.597 ) .
in dogs , the mean v ss was 20.4 l / kg following administration of 0.08 mg / kg of eribulin , with no major inter - day fluctuation ( data not shown ) .
total body clearance ( cl ) of eribulin was moderate in all species tested .
in mice , the cl was 2.14 or 2.79 l / h / kg at a 0.5 or 2 mg / kg dose , respectively .
in rats , the cl was 2.04 or 1.61 l / h / kg at a 0.5 or 1 mg / kg dose , respectively , with no statistical difference ( p = 0.335 ) between the two doses .
in dogs , the cl was 1.06 l / h / kg when administered 0.08 mg / kg of eribulin .
elimination of eribulin was slow in all species studied .
in mice , the terminal half - lives ( t 1 / 2 ) were 3.6 or 6.9 h after 0.5 or 2 mg / kg , respectively .
in rats , the t 1 / 2 were 15.9 or 27.9 h after 0.5 or 1 mg / kg , respectively , and there was no statistical difference between these two doses ( p = 0.064 ) .
similar values were obtained in dogs .
overall , the results suggest linear pharmacokinetics of eribulin in the dose range tested .
compartmental analysis ( data not shown ) in general supported the above observation .

data are expressed as mean +/ - sd ( n = 3 ) plasma pk profiles of eribulin following single and multiple intravenous administrations ( q2dx3 ) to lox tumor - bearing mice were characterized by extensive distribution ( v ss : 6.79 - 8.03 l / kg ) , moderate clearance ( cl : 2.22 - 2.86 l / h / kg ) , and moderate elimination ( t 1 / 2 : 2.2 - 5.1 h ) .
penetration of eribulin into the tumors was fast ( t max = 0.25 - 1.0 h ) .
the calculated tpi showed that exposures to eribulin were approximately 20 - 30 times higher in tumor than in plasma after both single and multiple dose administration .
the tpi following multiple dosing was slightly higher than that observed after single dosing , but it is not possible to conclude that there was accumulation of eribulin in the tumor after multiple dosing because of the variability associated with estimating t 1 / 2 and auc from time 0 to infinity ( auc0 - inf ) .
the bpi of eribulin in mice was poor , with exposures ranging from approximately 13 - 45 % of those observed in plasma after a single dose administration .
discussion pk profiles of eribulin in mice , rats , and dogs were characterized by high volume of distribution , moderate clearance , and slow elimination .
the clearance was similar in the three species .
in xenograft female mice , the parameters were similar to those of male balb / c mice .
however , the volume of distribution showed species differences ; it was smaller in mice compared with rats and dogs .
the reason behind the species differences is uncertain .
the disposition profile of eribulin was biphasic , with a rapid distribution phase ( within minutes ) followed by a long elimination phase .
the eribulin half - lives were shorter in mice compared with rats and dogs .
the high volume of distribution suggests that eribulin is extensively distributed extravascularly .
this is expected due to low protein binding of eribulin and its good membrane permeability .
overall , the pk profiles are similar between animals and humans [ 11 , 12 , 19 ] .
in a preclinical study , eribulin showed wide in vivo therapeutic windows [ 1 ] .
we investigated eribulin exposure in tumor and brain using a xenograft model .
efflux transporters , such as p - gp , are expressed in the blood - brain barrier and in cancer cells , which is one of the expected reasons for resistance against anti - cancer chemotherapy [ 20 ] .
eribulin is likely to be a p - gp substrate as it shows greater brain penetration in abcb member1a - deficient mice than that in wild - type mice [ 15 ] .
in the present study , the bpi in xenograft mice showed low distribution in brain compared with that in plasma , indicating that eribulin is a p - gp substrate and would have a little effect in the central nervous system .
on the other hand , the tpi of eribulin indicated that tumor exposure was approximately 20 - 30 times higher than that in plasma after both single and multiple dose regimens .
tumor penetration of other tubulin - binding drugs , such as paclitaxel , in xenograft mice has been well studied .
hamaguchi reported that the tpis of paclitaxel in colon tumor - bearing mice were 1.07 and 1.49 [ 21 ] and those of eribulin in our study were 17.2 - 33.9 .
the half - lives of paclitaxel and eribulin in tumor were 7.02 - 8.06 and 17.8 - 35.9 h , respectively .
these results suggest that eribulin has higher tumor retention than paclitaxel ; however , a direct comparison cannot be made as these are different studies evaluating distinct tumor types .
the mechanism of retention in tumor is a balance between distribution and elimination , and depends on both tumor - and drug - specific parameters [ 22 , 23 ] .
among drug - specific characteristics , a possible reason to explain the high tumor retention of eribulin is related to its mechanism of action .
eribulin showed irreversible mitotic block leading to apoptosis and complete loss of long - term viability at 5 days postwashout [ 2 ] .
thus , once eribulin reaches the target tumor cells and binds to high - affinity sites , it will be retained inside the tumor and have persistent activity .
towle et al. also reported that paclitaxel is classified as a drug with reversible activity , suggesting that paclitaxel and eribulin have distinct mechanisms [ 2 ] .
additional mechanisms may contribute to a higher distribution of eribulin into tumor tissues .
eribulin was reported to have an effect on vascular normalization and reoxygenation .
eribulin - induced remodeling of vasculature leads to uniform tumor perfusion across all tumor regions in human breast cancer [ 6 ] and soft tissue sarcoma [ 24 ] .
tumor microenvironment is abnormal compared with that of nonmalignant tissues , and eribulin - induced increased tumor perfusion increased the ability of subsequently administered drugs to reach tumor areas that had previously been poorly perfused .
overall , the high tpi of eribulin , in combination with its diverse mechanism of action , would account for its balanced profile of efficacy and safety .
in the clinical study , eribulin also showed longer activity in tumor [ 19 ] .
significant morphologic changes ( bundle formation ) , induced by eribulin , were observed in the microtubules of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor cells in vivo for at least 24 h , and the plasma concentrations of eribulin are maintained well above the levels required for the activity in vitro ( sub - nm ) for > 72 h [ 19 ] .
regarding retention of higher concentration , the limited metabolism of eribulin would contribute to slow elimination in humans .
furthermore , the vascular remodeling effect of eribulin observed in preclinical studies was also confirmed in clinical studies .
optical imaging technology revealed that oxygen saturation was increased in tumors after eribulin infusion , suggesting that eribulin induces tumor reoxygenation and perfusion [ 5 ] .
thus , the recovery of tumor perfusion might also contribute to longer retention of eribulin in human .
in conclusion , eribulin was distributed rapidly and eliminated slowly in mice , rats , and dogs .
in female xenograft mice , eribulin pk parameters were similar to those of male balb / c mice .
eribulin exposure was approximately 20 - 30 times higher in tumor than in plasma after both single and multiple intravenous dose administrations .
these results might be caused by eribulin 's mechanism of action including increased perfusion in tumor by due to the remodeling effect .
the results of the present study may help to explain the well - balanced efficacy and safety of eribulin in clinical studies .

background chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy is an inflammatory disease that occurs in approximately 30 % of patients infected by the protozoan trypanosoma cruzi , and it has a profile of high morbidity and mortality .
the worst prognosis and the progression of this cardiomyopathy are associated with an exacerbated immune response and the production of proinflammatory cytokines , which also occur in other cardiomyopathies .
some nutrients , including omega - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufas ) , promote the inhibition and / or stimulation of cytokine production .
the objective of this trial is to study the effects of omega - 3 pufa supplementation on the inflammatory response and lipid profile in patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy .
methods / design this is a parallel , randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blind clinical trial with 40 patients that will be conducted at a reference unit for chagas disease patients , where the patients will be selected .
the study will include patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy who are 18 years of age or older .
the exclusion criteria are ( a ) ongoing diarrheal disease , ( b ) inflammatory bowel disease , ( c ) diabetes or other endocrine disease , ( d ) use of fibrates , niacin , or statins , ( e ) use of anti - inflammatory drugs , ( f ) pregnant and lactating women , ( g ) use of vitamin , mineral , or omega - 3 supplementation during the previous 30 days , ( h ) hospital admission during the study , and ( i ) other associated cardiomyopathies .
the intervention will be treatment with omega - 3 pufas at a dose of 3 g / day for 8 weeks , compared to placebo ( corn oil ) .
the primary endpoints will be the concentrations of inflammatory markers ( interleukin ( il ) - 1 , il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 6 , il - 10 , tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) alpha , interferon ( ifn ) gamma , and transforming growth factor ( tgf ) beta ) .
secondary endpoints will be the fasting glucose , lipid , and anthropometric profiles .
for statistical analysis , we plan to run either a t test or wilcoxon test ( numerical variables ) and pearson 's chi2 or fisher 's exact test ( categorical data ) , as appropriate .
discussion evidence suggests that the anti - inflammatory action of omega - 3 pufas may have beneficial effects on chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy , as shown for other cardiomyopathies , due to improved control of the inflammatory response .
at the end of the study , we predict that patients will have lower inflammatory markers and an improved metabolic and anthropometric profile .
trial registration current controlled trials nct01863576 chagas disease trypanosoma cruzi chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy omega - 3 cytokines lipid profile nutritional assessment background chagas disease is endemic in latin american countries , where approximately 8 to 10 million people are infected with trypanosoma cruzi [ 1 ] .
in brazil , the number of infected people is approximately 1.9 million , or 1 % of the brazilian population [ 2 ] .
the etiologic diagnosis of chagas disease is performed by detection of the parasite by parasitological methods ( direct or indirect ) and confirmed by two different serological techniques indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) [ 3 ] .
chagas disease has two distinct clinical phases : acute and chronic [ 3 ] .
the chronic phase has three forms : indeterminate , cardiac involvement , and / or digestive involvement [ 3 - 5 ] .
in most cases , acute disease is not recognized at onset , and the individual remains asymptomatic with no evidence of damage to any organ but with reactive serology for chagas disease and low parasitemia during the chronic phase [ 4 ] .
after two or more decades , 20 % to 30 % of patients progress to the cardiac stage of the disease , when the majority of the deaths and severe complications related to the disease occur [ 6 - 8 ] .
therefore , chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy ( ccc ) is an important clinical form of chagas disease due to its impact on morbidity and its high mortality , worsening of the quality of life , and limitation of the ability to work .
it is characterized by a myocarditis with multifocal mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates , varying degrees of fibrosis , constant low - grade tissue parasitism , and low or undetectable parasitemia [ 9 ] and it occurs earlier and more severely in males [ 8,10 ] .
patients in the chronic cardiac phase may manifest heart failure , ventricular and atrial arrhythmias , atrioventricular blocks , thromboembolism , stroke , and sudden death [ 2,7,11 ] , which together carry a high economic and mortality burden .
once settled , ccc is progressive and tends worsen due to overlap with inflammation , cell destruction , and fibrosis .
some hypotheses have been proposed to explain the nature of the cardiac inflammatory reaction , mainly persistent heart immune response and reaction to the parasite [ 12 ] .
cytokines are important mediators in the maintenance of the inflammatory process , and they can stimulate or inhibit the immune response [ 13 ] .
among the several cytokines studied in t. cruzi infection , interferon gamma ( ifngamma ) has been associated with host resistance to infection in both experimental models and humans [ 14,15 ] .
transforming growth factor beta ( tgfbeta ) production is increased in t. cruzi infection , and this increase is most likely related to the fibrotic process observed in ccc [ 16 ] .
these results suggest that cytokines play essential roles in controlling ccc morbidity [ 17 - 19 ] .
some nutrients are associated with the inhibition and / or stimulation of cytokine production , including polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufas ) .
omega - 3 pufas ( linolenic acid , eicosapentaenoic acid , and docosahexaenoic acid ) are found in vegetables ( soy , canola , linseed ) and cold - water fish ( mackerel , sardines , salmon , herring ) .
pufas are precursors to the biosynthesis of several important metabolites , especially eicosanoids ( prostaglandins , leukotrienes , thromboxanes , lipoxins , and others ) , synthesized from arachidonic acid [ 20 ] .
omega - 6 pufas ( such as linoleic acid : 18:2n - 6 ) and omega - 3 pufas ( such as linolenic acid : 18:3n - 3 ) are fundamental to the body and have important roles in cell metabolism , including influencing membrane fluidity , promoting the release of cytokines , and acting as adhesion molecules on macrophages .
thus , changes in their synthesis and metabolism may be associated with endothelial and hemodynamic changes that contribute to the increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [ 21 ] .
the fatty acid composition of inflammatory cells can be modified by increasing the intake of marine n - 3 fatty acids , which leads to a higher content of eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( dha ) .
a number of cell culture studies have reported that both epa and dha decrease the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappab ( nfkappab ) in response to inflammatory stimuli , such as lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokines [ 22 ] .
omega - 3 pufas reduce arachidonic acid content in cell membranes , resulting in the synthesis of eicosanoids that have weaker inflammatory properties than the eicosanoids derived from omega - 6 pufas [ 23 ] .
omega - 3 supplementation is safe and well tolerated in infectious disease as demonstrated in hiv - infected patients treated with antiretroviral therapy [ 24,25 ] , and on host resistance to infection from plasmodium berghei or plasmodium falciparum , the causative agents of malaria [ 26 ] , which like chagas disease is a parasitic infection .
several studies involving supplementation of the diet with marine n - 3 pufas in healthy human volunteers have demonstrated decreased production of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnfalpha ) , interleukin 1beta ( il - 1beta ) , il - 2 , and il - 6 [ 22,23,27 ] .
omega - 3 pufa supplementation for 8 weeks has been associated with an increase of peripheral mononuclear cells with high concentrations of epa and dha , which have an immunomodulating effect [ 28 ] .
in healthy adults , fish oil supplementation at 5 ml / day for 8 weeks reduced the production of il - 6 but did not change the production of il - 10 , tnfalpha , or ifngamma [ 29 ] .
long - chain omega - 3 pufa ( epa and dha ) plasma levels are inversely associated with the risk of sudden death [ 30 ] and may reduce the risk of ischemic heart disease [ 31 ] .
epa and dha are also involved in the reduction of plasma very - low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( vldl - c ) and triglycerides [ 32 ] .
a study conducted by the italian group gissi - hf at 326 cardiology sites and 31 internal medicine sites selected 6,975 patients with heart failure diagnosis to receive 1 daily capsule containing 1 g of omega - 3 pufas ( n = 3,494 ) or placebo ( n = 3,481 ) [ 33 ] .
the total mortality of the supplemented group was 27 % , and that of the placebo group was 29 % ( adjusted hr 0.91 ; 95.5 % confidence interval ( ci ) 0.833 to 0.998 ; p = 0.041 ) .
hospital admissions due to cardiovascular events were 57 % in the omega - 3 pufa group versus 59 % in the placebo group ( adjusted hr 0.92 ; 99 % ci 0.849 to 0.999 ; p = 0.009 ) .
the advantages of n - 3 pufas , which were reduced fatal events and hospital admissions from cardiovascular causes , suggest that they have an effect on the mechanisms leading to progression of heart failure [ 33 ] .
supplementation with 1 g / day of omega - 3 pufas in capsules can decrease cardiovascular events by 10 % ( death , myocardial infarction , stroke ) in coronary arterial disease patients [ 34 ] .
some studies that assessed the effect of omega - 3 supplementation on the immune response used epa and / or dha at 1 g to 9 g per day , similar to the ingestion levels of greenland eskimos : 6 to 14 g / day , corresponding to 2.7 % to 6.3 % of their total calorie intake .
the highest doses can reduce arachidonic acid in peripheral mononuclear cells [ 35 ] .
studies conducted in heart failure patients have not shown adverse events after omega - 3 supplementation [ 33,36 ] .
in contrast , studies in pregnant women and cancer patients have reported gastrointestinal changes ( diarrhea , flatulence , gastroesophageal reflux , nausea ) , although no differences between the treatment and placebo groups were noted [ 37,38 ] .
few studies have evaluated the nutritional status of chagas patients .
three studies have evaluated patients with the digestive form of the disease .
in two of these studies [ 39,40 ] , there was a high prevalence of malnutrition (> 60 %) .
the other study evaluated ten patients diagnosed as having megaesophagus , and only one had malnutrition .
the others were eutrophic or overweight [ 41 ] .
a study performed in sao paulo , brazil , assessed the nutritional state of 66 chagas patients and found a high prevalence of overweight and obesity ( 94 %) and large waist circumference ( 55 %) .
the indeterminate form of the disease was the most prevalent and constituted 71 % of cases [ 42 ] .
there are no reports in the literature on the nutritional assessment of ccc patients .
supplementation with omega - 3 pufas may lead to increased bodyweight in patients with heart cachexia , as reported by a study that assessed 14 patients with severe heart failure supplemented with 8 g / day omega - 3 pufas or placebo [ 43 ] .
although several studies have shown the beneficial effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids on inflammatory processes , dyslipidemia , and cardiovascular diseases , there are no reports about food intake and pufa supplementation in ccc patients .
thus , the objective of this study is to assess the effects of omega - 3 pufa supplementation on the lipid profile and the proinflammatory and anti - inflammatory cytokine profiles in ccc patients .
methods / design study design this is a parallel , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trial with balanced randomization ( 1:1 ) .
settings the proposed clinical trial will be held at a single site , the evandro chagas clinical research institute ( ipec ) , which is one of the technical scientific units of the oswaldo cruz foundation ( fiocruz ) .
ipec is a 93 - year - old institution that is fully dedicated to clinical research on infectious diseases , including chagas disease .
ipec is a major reference center for chagas disease research , care , and training .
participants ( inclusion and exclusion criteria ) patients will be recruited from the cardiology ambulatory service at ipec / fiocruz , rio de janeiro , brazil , during the period determined for screening until the minimum estimated sample size is reached .
all patients had a previous epidemiologic history of chagas disease confirmed with at least two chagas serology tests ( indirect immunofluorescence and elisa ) , and clinical evaluations , electrocardiographic and echocardiographic data obtained recently .
selected patients will be older than 18 years , males and females with ccc at stage b ( no heart failure symptoms but with segmental or global left ventricular systolic dysfunction by echocardiogram ) , stage c ( symptomatic heart failure ) , or stage d ( end - stage heart failure ) , according to the current brazilian chagas disease consensus [ 3 ] .
the following exclusion criteria will be applied : diarrheal disease ; inflammatory bowel syndrome ; diagnosis of diabetes or other endocrine pathologies ; use of fibrates , niacin , or statins ; use of anti - inflammatory drugs ; pregnant and lactating women ; vitamin mineral or omega - 3 supplementation during the previous 30 days ; hospital admission during the study ; and the presence of cardiomyopathies other than ccc .
interventions : omega - 3 versus corn oil placebo each participant will receive five omega - 3 capsules per day ( 1.8 g epa and 1.2 g dha ) or placebo for 8 weeks ( figure 1 ) .
the omega - 3 and corn oil capsules will be provided by relthy laboratorios ltda .

endpoints the primary endpoint of this study will be the cytokine profile .
il - 1 , il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 6 , il - 10 , tnfalpha , ifngamma , and tgfbeta will be measured in the serum of patients using specific sandwich enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays .
capture and detection antibodies will be obtained from ebioscience ( san diego , ca , usa ) .
the tests will be conducted according to the manufacturer 's instructions and performed in triplicate .
the first secondary endpoint will be the lipid profile .
total cholesterol , triglycerides , and high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hdl - c ) will be measured with enzymatic colorimetric assays using siemens reagents on a siemens dimension rxl chemistry analyzer ( siemens healthcare diagnostics , tarrytown , ny , usa ) .
low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl - c ) and vldl - c will be calculated according to the friedewald equation [ 44 ] .
another secondary endpoint of this trial will be anthropometric measures .
the anthropometric assessment will consist of body mass index ( bmi ) , waist circumference , tricipital skinfold thickness , and arm circumference [ 45,46 ] .
bmi will be determined using the standard formula : bmi = weight / height2 [ 47 ] .
procedures , follow - up , and data collection after patients are selected by cardiologists , they will be seen by study nutritionists , who will explain the study procedures to the patients and administer the free and informed consent form .
the patients who agree to participate in the study will sign the consent form and undergo the initial assessment .
the following data will be collected and evaluated in the study : sociodemographic data ( age , sex , ethnicity / race , education , and domicile ) , clinical data ( functional class and vital signs ) , alcoholism , smoking , prescription drugs , 3 - day food record [ 48 ] , 24 - h recall [ 49 ] , anthropometric assessment ( height , weight , bmi , waist circumference , tricipital skinfold thickness , and arm circumference ) , lipid profile ( total cholesterol , triglycerides , hdl - c , ldl - c , and vldl - c ) , and cytokines ( il - 1 , il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 6 , il - 10 , tnfalpha , ifngamma , and tgfbeta ) .
clinical , nutritional , and anthropometric assessments will take place immediately before starting the intervention and after 4 and 8 weeks during the study ; lipid profile and cytokines will be evaluated before the intervention and at the end of 8 weeks .
each patient will be followed for 8 weeks .
compliance with study treatment will be assessed by the 3 - day treatment recall and the number of omega - 3 / placebo capsules returned .
at every visit , the patients will be asked about the number of doses of the prescribed treatment that they did not take during the previous 3 days , and the ratio between the number of doses taken and the number prescribed will be calculated .
the capsules will be dispensed at the beginning of the study and after 4 weeks , and the returned capsules will be verified at weeks 4 and 8 .
the dietary omega - 3 pufa intake will be followed - up during the study ( first visit and weeks 4 and 8 ) by analyzing the 24 - h recall and 3 - day food record , which are considered indirect methods of analyzing the diet , current dietary standards of a certain population , and their development over time [ 50 ] .
patients may be excluded from the study in case of complications during follow - up , such as significant changes in intestinal transit , use of anti - inflammatory drugs , and hospital admissions .
other complications will be assessed by the study team .
all endpoints will be collected at time 0 and 8 weeks after omega - 3 / placebo supplementation starts .
safety monitoring patients will be followed up by a multidisciplinary team at three time points : study start , week 4 , and week 8 .
possible complications will be assessed by the study cardiologist and pharmacist .
the safety assessment will consist of monitoring adverse events , such as changes in the digestive tract , physical exams , and laboratory tests .
events , onset , and duration will be reported to the cardiologist , who will determine if it is necessary to suspend supplement use .
regular intake of omega - 3 pufas is not a risk to health .
according to the us food and drug administration ( fda ) , the maximum intake of 3 g / day epa + dha is considered safe [ 51 ] .
randomization and concealment after the screening phase , patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups of 20 patients each : intervention group or control group .
assignment to either group will be performed by a computer - generated 1:1 randomization .
this assignment will occur within randomly ordered blocks of size 4 or 6 .
this procedure will be conducted using r project software with package ' blockrand ' [ 52 ] .
the allocation sequence will be concealed from the researchers , who will enroll and assess participants in sequentially numbered , opaque , sealed , stapled envelopes .
to prevent subversion of the allocation sequence , the name and date of birth of the participant will be written on the envelope before the envelope is opened .
the information in the envelope will be transferred onto the allocation card inside the envelope .
corresponding envelopes will be opened only after the enrolled participants have completed all baseline assessments and at the time of allocation to the intervention .
these procedures will be carried out by a professional without access to the baseline evaluation results .
the blister packaging and gel capsules of omega - 3 pufas and placebo will be identical .
they will be identified by the lot number on the package , which will be retained in the pharmacy , and only the blisters will be provided to patients .
the pharmacist responsible for distribution and compliance assessment will be the only person who can access this information .
blinding the nutritionists and physician that will perform the initial evaluation before randomization , the monthly evaluations and anthropometric profile , and the final evaluation of the health care questionnaires after the end of the patient follow - up will be blinded to the patients' assignments .
statistical methods the epidata [ 53 ] and statistical package for social sciences [ 54 ] software will be used for data entry and analysis , respectively .
for categorical data , we will use pearson 's chi2 or fisher 's exact test to verify the association between variables in the two groups ( omega - 3 and placebo ) .
statistical analysis will be performed by descriptive analysis , with numerical variables expressed as the mean and standard deviation ( sd ) or median and interquartile range .
the kolmogorov - smirnov test will be used to test the normality of the sample distribution .
the student t test will be used in cases with a normal distribution to compare means between the two groups .
the wilcoxon test will be used in cases with a non - normal distribution .
p values < 0.05 will indicate a significant association in all of the statistical tests used .
minimum sample size estimation the minimum estimated sample size is 40 patients according to previous data , considering a prevalence of 60 % of inadequate pufa intake [ 55 ] .
the following parameters were considered : baseline ifngamma = 3,986 +/ - 738 pg / ml , ifngamma after n - 3 pufa supplementation = 2,922 +/ - 1,275 pg / ml [ 56 ] , power = 0.8 , and alpha = 5 % .
we used the r project software with package ' epicalc ' version 1.02 [ 57 ] to obtain this estimate .
ethical issues the study was approved by the research ethics committee of the evandro chagas clinical research institute ( ipec / fiocruz ) , registration number caae - 0037.0.009.000 - 10 [ 58 ] .
it is registered at clinicaltrials.gov , number nct01863576 .
all study supplies and data collected will be used exclusively in this study , and its results will be made public , whether they are favorable or not .
discussion omega - 3 pufa intake is associated with beneficial health effects .
omega - 3 pufas are helpful in the prevention and treatment of pathologies such as inflammatory diseases , hypertension , hypertriglyceridemia , metabolic syndrome , and heart diseases .
an italian study of heart failure patients showed a reduction in mortality and hospital admissions due to cardiovascular events , suggesting beneficial effects of omega - 3 pufas on the progression of heart disease [ 33 ] .
omega - 3 administration is effective at treating hypertriglyceridemia .
according to clinical trials , supplementation with 2 to 4 g of epa / dha per day may reduce triglyceride levels by 25 % to 30 % [ 59 ] by decreasing the liver synthesis of vldl - c [ 34 ] .
omega - 3 supplementation for chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy may be similar to other cardiomyopathies and promote reductions in triglyceride and vldl - c levels .
omega - 3 has beneficial effects against heart cachexia after 18 weeks of supplementation [ 43 ] .
women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and bmi between 25 and 40 kg / m2 , however , exhibited no significant changes in bmi after supplementation for 8 weeks [ 60 ] .
the period of treatment in this study may not be long enough to observe significant anthropometric changes after omega - 3 administration with no other associated instruction or intervention .
the action of omega - 3 pufas is most likely related to their anti - inflammatory effects , which are not yet completely understood ; however , it is known that omega - 3 pufa supplementation reduces arachidonic acid content in cell membranes , resulting in the synthesis of eicosanoids that are less inflammatory than the ones derived from omega - 6 pufas [ 23 ] .
omega - 3 pufas can also decrease activation of nfkappab in response to inflammatory stimuli , such as lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokines [ 22 ] .
a meta - analysis of the effects of fish oil supplementation on the inflammatory markers of patients with chronic heart failure showed that circulating tnfalpha , il - 1 , and il - 6 ( proinflammatory cytokines ) decreased after a supplementation period of 3 to 12 months with an epa and dha dose of 600 to 5,540 mg / day .
these data suggest that supplementation with higher doses of omega - 3 pufas or longer follow - up times are associated with more substantially decreased cytokines [ 61 ] , which could benefit ccc patients .
a clinical trial evaluated 3 - month omega - 3 pufa supplementation in patients with heart failure .
patients were divided into three groups : placebo , 1 g / day omega - 3 pufas , and 4 g / day omega - 3 pufas .
only the 4 g / day group had an improvement in ventricular function with an increase in the ejection fraction and endothelial function and a reduction in il - 6 [ 36 ] .
we will use 3 g / day omega - 3 pufas in our study based on recent results suggesting higher efficacy when compared to the usual 1 g dose , in addition to the fact that 3 g / day is considered safe by the fda [ 51 ] .
according to a recent american college of cardiology and american heart association ( acc / aha ) heart failure guideline , omega - 3 supplementation is reasonable to use as adjunctive therapy in heart failure patients ( class of recommendation iia , level of evidence b ) [ 62 ] .
the worse prognosis and progression of ccc are related to increased immune response with the production of proinflammatory cytokines and the inhibition of anti - inflammatory cytokines , which also occur in other cardiomyopathies [ 63,64 ] .
in chagas disease , heart tissue is an important target of t. cruzi infection , and substantial amounts of proinflammatory cytokines , chemokines , and enzymes , including inducible nitric oxide synthase and metalloproteinases , are produced , resulting in inflammation and cardiac remodeling in response to parasite infection [ 65 ] .
higher levels of ifngamma and tnfalpha are associated with lower levels of il - 4 and il - 10 , in both cardiac and more severe forms of chagas disease , and high levels of il - 10 or moderate levels of ifngamma are associated with the indeterminate form [ 15,66 ] .
omega - 3 and omega - 6 pufa intake may lead to an increase in il - 10 production , as shown in an experimental study in wistar rats supplemented with ethyl - eicosapentaenoic acid and ethyl - gamma - linolenic acid compared to a group supplemented with palm oil [ 67 ] .
thus , omega - 3 pufa supplementation in ccc patients may lead to increased il - 4 and il - 10 , reducing the inflammatory effect on heart tissue .
omega - 3 pufa supplementation , due to its anti - inflammatory effects , is expected to decrease the serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines , which are associated with the proliferation of parasites and the fibrotic process characteristic of chagas myocarditis .
we thus suppose that the benefits to ccc patients with regard to the immunological profile could translate into a less severe progression of cardiomyopathy , with subsequent reduction in morbidity , in addition to secondary gains in the lipid profile .

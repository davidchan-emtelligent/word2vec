the presence of cell - free micrornas ( mirnas ) has been detected in a range of body fluids .
the mirna content of plasma / serum in particular has been proposed as a potential source of novel biomarkers for a number of diseases .
nevertheless , the quantification of mirnas from plasma or serum is made difficult due to inefficient isolation and lack of consensus regarding the optimal reference mirna .
the effect of haemolysis on the quantification and normalisation of mirnas in plasma has not been investigated in great detail .
we found that levels of mir - 16 , a commonly used reference gene , showed little variation when measured in plasma samples from healthy volunteers or patients with malignant mesothelioma or coronary artery disease .
including samples with evidence of haemolysis led to variation in mir - 16 levels and consequently decreased its ability to serve as a reference .
the levels of mir - 16 and mir - 451 , both present in significant levels in red blood cells , were proportional to the degree of haemolysis .
measurements of the level of these mirnas in whole blood , plasma , red blood cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that the mirna content of red blood cells represents the major source of variation in mir - 16 and mir - 451 levels measured in plasma .
adding lysed red blood cells to non - haemolysed plasma allowed a cut - off level of free haemoglobin to be determined , below which mir - 16 and mir - 451 levels displayed little variation between individuals .
in conclusion , increases in plasma mir - 16 and mir - 451 are caused by haemolysis .
in the absence of haemolysis the levels of both mir - 16 and mir - 451 are sufficiently constant to serve as normalisers .
introduction micrornas ( mirnas ) , a class of 18 - 25 nt long non - coding rnas , are post - transcriptional modulators of gene expression [ 1 ] - [ 3 ] .
they are involved in the regulation of normal physiological processes and there is rapidly increasing evidence that they also play a prominent role in cancer [ 2 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] and non - malignant conditions such as heart disease [ 6 ] .
recently a number of studies have shown that mirnas are readily detectable in body fluids , and the presence of specific mirna patterns in plasma of diseased ( cancer ) patients has raised the possibility of their use as biomarkers [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] .
mirnas in plasma / serum seem to be more stable than mrna and this has been attributed to their encapsulation into microvesicles [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
more recently , association of extracellular mirnas with nucleophosmin [ 12 ] , argonaute 2 [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] and high density lipoproteins [ 15 ] has been demonstrated , suggesting alternative mechanisms of mirna export and transport in the circulatory system .
since the first reports revealing the presence of mirnas in plasma and serum , numerous studies have identified distinct mirna expression patterns associated with disease and have proposed them as candidate biomarkers [ 9 ] .
however , when comparing the methods applied in different studies , a consensus on the best methods for the measurement and accurate quantification of disease - related mirna patterns in body fluids has yet to be reached .
when developing mirnas as biomarkers one of the first issues to consider is that each body fluid appears to have a normal spectrum of mirnas [ 8 ] , presumably a reflection of normal physiology .
mirnas in plasma and serum are thought to contribute to the ( normal ) functioning of the circulatory and the immune system [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
moreover , different blood cell components seem to be characterised by a distinct mirna profile .
while red blood cells ( rbcs ) contain high levels of mir - 451 and mir - 16 , these mirnas , which are thought to play a role in erythropoiesis [ 16 ] , [ 18 ] , were found at low levels in leucocytes and platelets [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
mirnas in blood may also be present in cell - derived microvesicles , exosomes and apoptotic bodies , which seem to shuttle specific subsets of mirnas to recipient cells [ 21 ] - [ 23 ] .
the measurement and exact quantification of mirna are further hampered by the low yields of rna in serum or plasma , complicating normalisation strategies that are based on quantification of total rna .
one of the most frequently used strategies to overcome this problem when quantifying mirnas is the use of a reference gene for normalisation between samples , usually a commonly expressed mrna , mirna or other small rna .
a number of groups have proposed the use of a stably expressed mirna such as mir - 16 or the small nucleolar rna rnu6b as a normaliser [ 24 ] - [ 27 ] , but others have reported significant variation in the levels of these normalisers [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
this has led to the adoption of normalisation strategies based on the detection / quantification of ' spiked in ' synthetic mirnas [ 30 ] - [ 32 ] .
since mir - 16 is one of the most abundant mirnas present in rbcs [ 20 ] , we theorised that haemolysis may be responsible for increasing levels of this candidate reference gene .
in this study we assessed the variation of mir - 16 levels in plasma samples from healthy individuals , patients with malignant mesothelioma ( mm ) and coronary artery disease ( cad ) .
we found comparable mir - 16 levels in the different groups of samples , but only in the absence of haemolysis .
only in plasma samples with a haemoglobin content equivalent to an absorbance of less than 0.2 at 414 nm were the levels of mir - 16 similar enough to be suitable for normalisation .
results plasma mir - 16 levels show little variation between individuals with different physiological conditions investigating the variation of a number of potential reference genes we found that while four moderately abundant mirnas , hsa - mir - 16 , - 15b , - 24 and - 451 were readily detectable in plasma samples the small nucleolar rna rnu6b could not be detected in any sample ( data not shown ) .
levels of the four mirnas were compared in the plasma ( without obvious signs of haemolysis ) of nine healthy volunteers , eighteen patients with mm and ten patients with cad .
while the cq ( quantification cycle ) values for mir - 15b and - 24 varied between healthy and diseased individuals , those of mir - 451 showed less variation and those of mir - 16 varied by only 2 cycles ( figure 1a ) .
furthermore , measurements of mir - 16 levels in plasma obtained at three separate occasions from the same individual varied by less than 1 cycle ( figure 1b ) .

as it is known that mir - 451 and mir - 16 are abundantly present in rbcs , we separately analysed normal and discoloured ( pink ) samples from the same collection .
samples that were considered to be haemolysed due to pink discolouration indeed showed increased absorbance at 414 , 541 and 576 nm ( figure 2a ) confirming the presence of free haemoglobin [ 33 ] .
in the haemolysed samples the concentration of both mir - 451 and mir - 16 was significantly higher ( figure 2b ) , with an increase in absolute copy number per microl plasma of up to 8 - fold as compared with non - haemolysed samples .

rbcs represent the major source of mir - 16 and mir - 451 in whole blood measurement of both mir - 451 and mir - 16 levels in whole blood as well as rbcs , peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) and plasma separated by ficoll - paque revealed that rbcs represent the most likely source of variation in levels of these mirnas in plasma / serum .
the number of copies of both mir - 451 and mir - 16 in ( whole ) blood mainly derived from rbcs , while pbmcs and plasma were found to contribute less than 1 % of copies of both mirnas ( table 1 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0024145.t001 table 1 levels of mir - 16 and mir - 451 in different fractions of blood .
hsa - mir - 16 hsa - mir - 451 whole blood 1.15e + 12 1.09e + 12 rbcs 1.09e + 12 1.03e + 12 pbmcs 2.19e + 06 2.23e + 04 plasma 6.32e + 08 8.38e + 08 mirnas were isolated and quantified from either whole blood or different blood fractions separated by ficoll gradient .
copy numbers per milliliter whole blood were calculated for each mirna based on a standard curve generated using synthetic oligonucleotides with sequences corresponding to the mature mirna sequence .
determination of a threshold of free haemoglobin below which levels of erythrocyte mirs display little variability while gross haemolysis can be identified easily by change in colour of the plasma , we theorised that an increase of mirna levels might occur even before noticeable colour change of the supernatant plasma .
to investigate the effect of haemolysis on the levels of mirnas we artificially introduced haemolysis by serially diluting lysed rbcs in non - haemolysed plasma from a healthy donor .
while a change in plasma colour due to haemolysis was only visible when the rbc concentration exceeded 0.125 % ( v / v ) , the absorbance of the main haemoglobin related peak at 414 nm increased above background from a rbc concentration of as little as 0.016 % ( figure 3 ) .
this increase in lambda 414 absorption correlates with an increase in free haemoglobin concentration ( mg / dl ) as well as the levels of ldh in the samples .
in contrast the other potential indicators of haemolysis , alt and ast , were only significantly increased in samples with visible haemolysis ( table s1 ) .
the level of the rbc - enriched mirnas mir - 451 and mir - 16 increased with increasing percentage of free haemoglobin. with as little as 0.031 % ( v / v ) rbcs added to plasma , a concentration at which haemolysis of the sample was visually not apparent , the number of copies / microl plasma was higher than the mean mir - 16 level detected in 25 non - haemolysed samples ( 1.12x106 +/ - 0.49x106 copies / microl plasma ) .
levels of mir - 15b also increased with haemolysis , but at much lower absolute levels , whereas mir - 24 levels were unchanged in the presence of haemolysis ( figure s1a ) .
measurement of three more mirnas present at moderate levels in plasma showed that while mir - 92a levels also increases with the degree of haemolysis those of mir - 155 and mir - 625 * remained stable ( figure s1b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0024145.g003 figure 3 relationship between free haemoglobin and mirna content of plasma samples .
a dilution series of lysed rbcs in plasma ( top ) was prepared and haemoglobin content measured by absorbance at 414 nm [ 33 ] .
rna was isolated from the samples indicated by the box and levels of mir - 16 and mir - 451 were quantified using a standard curve .
while a change in plasma colour is only clearly visible from a rbc concentration of 0.125 % ( v / v ) the amount of free haemoglobin as well as this of both mir - 451 and mir - 16 already substantially increased at a rbc concentration of 0.031 % ( v / v ) .
analysing our series of haemolysed and non - haemolysed plasma samples ( 9 healthy , 20 mm and 16 cad ) , we further assessed the levels of all four mirnas .
we found that using an absorbance at 414 nm of higher than 0.2 as cut - off to distinguish haemolysed and non - haemolysed plasma ( figure 4a , p < 0.001 ) significantly decreased the variability in both mir - 451 ( figure 4b , p = 0.008 ) and mir - 16 ( figure 4c , p = 0.026 ) levels .
exclusion of haemolysed plasma did not reduce the variability in mir - 15b ( figure 4d , p = 0.893 ) and mir - 24 ( figure 4e , p = 0.086 ) levels .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0024145.g004 figure 4 determination of a cut - off level of free haemoglobin to distinguish haemolysed from non - haemolysed plasma .
levels of free haemoglobin , mir - 451 , - 16 , - 15b and - 24 were measured in a cohort of non - haemolysed ( circles , n = 23 ) and haemolysed ( squares , n = 22 ) plasma samples from healthy volunteers and mm or cad patients .
applying a cut - off at an absorbance at 414 nm of higher than 0.2 ( a ) to remove haemolysed samples from the analysis significantly decreased the variability for both mir - 451 ( b ) and mir - 16 ( c ) , and showed that in non - haemolysed samples mir - 16 and mir - 451 levels showed little variation in samples from individuals with different physiological conditions .
in contrast the variability of mir - 15b ( d ) and mir - 24 ( e ) levels was not reduced by exclusion of haemolysed samples .

effect of haemolysis on potential mirna biomarkers for cad to investigate the effect of haemolysis on mirnas proposed as biomarkers , we measured levels of mir - 92a and mir - 155 , two mirnas previously shown to be present at lower levels in the plasma of cad patients than in healthy controls .
the levels of mir - 92a were also elevated in haemolysed plasma of two mm , 1 cad patient and 1 healthy control compared with matched non - haemolysed samples from the same individuals .
in contrast to mir - 16 and mir - 451 , however , the increase in mir - 92a calculated by using the 2 - deltacq [ 34 ] method did not seem to correlate with the degree of haemolysis ( figure 5a ) .
in contrast to mir - 92a , the levels of mir - 155 were only increased in two out of four haemolysed samples ( figure 5a ) .
quantification of mirna using the 2 - deltadeltacq [ 34 ] method with normalisation to mir - 16 resulted in lower mirna levels in haemolysed than in non - haemolysed samples ( figure 5b ) , although the measurement in the dilution series ( figure s1b ) showed a correlation between the degree of haemolysis and mir - 92a levels .
similar results were also obtained for measurement of mir - 15b and mir - 24 in the same samples ( data not shown ) .

discussion a number of recent studies have shown that mirnas are detectable in a variety of body fluids and mirnas in plasma and serum have attracted particular attention as candidate biomarkers for a range of diseases [ 9 ] .
however , although mirnas are readily detectable in both plasma and serum , the identification of disease - specific mirnas or mirna expression patterns is complicated by the fact that the majority of mirnas in blood do not seem to be affected by the presence of disease .
studies profiling the mirna content of normal serum have for example shown that there is extensive overlap between the mirna profiles of serum and blood cells , suggesting a physiological role for these mirnas [ 28 ] , [ 35 ] .
detailed studies have provided evidence that mir - 451 and mir - 16 are involved in the late stages of erythropoiesis , and that mir - 451 is erythroid specific [ 18 ] , [ 20 ] .
in contrast , mir - 155 was found at higher levels in platelets and b / t lymphocytes , and mir - 223 was found in high levels in granulocytes and monocytes , suggesting that they play a role in the differentiation of these cell types [ 16 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 36 ] .
in addition to mirnas present in different blood cell types , the contents of microvesicles represent another source for both normal and disease - specific mirnas found in the circulation .
microvesicles ( mvs ) are released by normal cells including haematopoietic lineages [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 35 ] , and are thought to act as a shuttle to deliver nucleic acids , including mirnas , to recipient cells [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
furthermore it was shown that mvs released by tumour cells contain cancer - specific mirna signatures that differentiate them from mvs released by normal cells [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
comparisons between cellular and exosomal mirna content also showed that several mirnas can be found in higher concentrations in exosomes than in the corresponding tumour cell , suggesting selective packaging of mirnas into exosomes [ 22 ] .
the quantification of mirnas in blood is complicated by the high protein content and low rna concentrations of plasma / serum .
even with the use of carrier molecules to improve isolation [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] , yields are often at or below the threshold for accurate quantification by spectrophotometric analyses [ 41 ] .
the low yields of rna extracted from plasma make a quantification of mirnas in copies per nanogram total rna difficult .
these problems are not unique to plasma or serum .
a recent study evaluating the use of different reference rnas for a range of tissue samples has shown that normalisation to total rna input is highly unstable [ 42 ] .
an additional argument against the use of total rna as a normaliser is the observation that the total plasma / serum rna content may change ( increase ) with disease state [ 43 ] .
a frequently used alternative approach for normalisation is the use of a ubiquitously expressed rna or mirna as reference gene .
while the small nucleolar rna rnu6b is often used for normalisation when quantifying mirnas from tissue samples [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] , levels of this small rna were found to be variable in a significant number of studies [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 35 ] , [ 46 ] .
a range of mirna candidates for normalisation has also been evaluated , with mir - 16 the most frequently used .
however , while some studies showed that mir - 16 was present at similar levels in samples from healthy individuals and diseased patients [ 25 ] - [ 27 ] , [ 47 ] , other studies suggested that mir - 16 levels were not consistent enough to be used for normalisation [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
we have shown that the plasma levels of mir - 16 from healthy controls as well as patients with either mm or cad were very similar ( figure 1a ) .
the low coefficient of variance of mir - 16 in individuals with and without disease , together with the observation that the levels of mir - 16 in plasma taken at separate occasions from the same individual varied by less than one cq in rt - qpcr ( figure 1b ) strengthen our conclusion that mir - 16 levels can serve as a reference for normalisation .
quantification of mir - 451 and mir - 16 levels in blood and its different components showed that the level of both mirnas in whole blood are dominated by the mirna content of red blood cells and that only a fraction is derived from plasma or pbmcs (< 1 %) .
thus the increase in mir - 16 levels is likely to be caused by rupture of rbcs .
in vitro haemolysis is a relatively common phenomenon during collection of blood .
occasionally , when multiple tubes from the same sampling were separated , both haemolysed and non - haemolysed plasma were obtained .
using non - haemolysed and haemolysed plasma isolated from the same collection we were able to show that levels of both mir - 451 and mir - 16 in plasma increased with the degree of haemolysis ( figure 2 ) .
these data are in line with a recent study showing that the levels of certain mirnas , such as mir - 16 can vary with haemolysis [ 48 ] .
using a dilution series of rbcs in plasma , we confirmed that the levels of both mirnas were already significantly increased before a change in plasma colour from yellow to pink was visible ( figure 3 ) , while other mirs such as mir - 24 and mir - 155 remained unchanged ( figure s1 ) .
applying these data to a series of control and patient samples with different degrees of haemolysis we found that using a cut - off level based on measurement of free haemoglobin allowed us to distinguish between non - haemolysed and haemolysed plasma .
removing haemolysed samples resulted in significantly decreased variance in levels of both mir - 451 and mir - 16 ( figure 4 ) .
a number of studies have investigated the potential use of mirnas , including mirs - 92a and - 155 , as plasma biomarkers of heart disease [ 24 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 49 ] - [ 51 ] .
mir - 92a is a member of the mir - 17 ~ 92 cluster of regulators of angiogenesis with expression predominantly in endothelial cells [ 52 ] , [ 53 ] , whereas mir - 155 was found to be highly expressed in platelets as well as being involved in maturation of b and t cells [ 16 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 36 ] .
comparing levels of mir - 92a and mir - 155 in non - haemolysed and haemolysed plasma collected from patients revealed that , like mir - 16 and mir - 451 , the absolute levels of mir - 92a are increased in haemolysed plasma .
in contrast only half of the haemolysed samples showed an increase in mir - 155 .
most importantly , however , the magnitude of increases in mir - 92a and mir - 155 , as well as mir - 15b and mir - 24 were less prominent than for mir - 16 and mir - 451 .
this has implications for quantification via the 2 - deltadeltacq method , especially when haemolysed samples are used .
applying 2 - deltadeltacq with mir - 16 as normalising reference ( figure 5b ) falsely suggested that both mir - 92a and mir - 155 were present at lower levels in haemolysed than in non - haemolysed plasma taken during the same sampling from the same patient .
this discrepancy highlights that a change in mir - 16 and mir - 451 levels due to even minimal haemolysis makes these mirnas inappropriate for use as normalisers between samples .
the measurement of mirnas in plasma or serum is a young and quickly evolving field .
besides a necessity for a consistent and optimised rna isolation procedure , the strategy applied for normalisation of plasma mirna levels represents a crucial step in accurate quantification .
we and others have shown that mir - 16 , the most commonly used reference mirna , is present at similar levels in plasma from healthy controls and patients with different diseases .
however , our finding that haemolysis can significantly affect the levels of plasma mirnas has implications for the use of mir - 16 as normaliser .
low - level haemolysis during the collection of plasma samples is a frequently occurring event which increases the plasma levels of rbc - derived mirnas .
it also has the potential to influence the measurement of any candidate mirna biomarker ( s ) that is also present in rbcs .
this suggests that the measurement of free haemoglobin in plasma samples might be a simple test method to determine whether a sample is suitable for mirna analysis using a normalisation strategy based on an endogenous mirna .

synthetic rnas synthetic rnas corresponding in sequence to the mature sequences of hsa - mir - 16,hsa - mir - 451 , hsa - mir - 15b and hsa - mir - 24 were synthesised by integrated dna technologies .
rna isolation total rna was isolated using the mirvana paris mirna isolation kit ( ambion / applied biosystems ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions for isolation of total rna , with the addition of a second phenol - chloroform extraction of the aqueous phase obtained after the first extraction to aid in removal of the high protein content .
following the denaturing step , 100 microg of mussel glycogen ( roche ) was added as carrier to aid rna isolation .
isolated rna eluted in 100 microl h2o was quantified using a nanophotometer ( implen ) with readings at 260 and 280 nm. rna samples were stored at - 80degreesc until further processing .
real - time rt - qpcr quantification of mirna content in rna from plasma was performed using stem - loop primers for reverse transcription and taqman primers / probe specific for each mirna ( applied biosystems , see table s2 for taqman assay ids ) .
for reverse transcription we used the taqman microrna reverse transcription kit ( applied biosystems ) with the following reaction conditions : 30 min at 16degreesc , followed by 30 min at 42degreesc and 5 min at 85degreesc .
for each plasma sample the reaction was carried out in a total reaction volume of 5 microl with a fixed volume of 1.67 microl isolated rna as template .
for absolute quantification of mirnas we generated standard curves using synthetic rnas ( integrated dna technologies ) corresponding in sequence to the mature mirnas detected .
a dilution series of these synthetic rnas ranging from 109 to 104 mirna copies per qpcr reaction was generated in the presence of 1 ng / microl yeast trna ( roche ) .
the reverse transcriptions for the standard curves were performed in a total reaction volume of 10 microl with 2.96 microl of a synthetic mirna solution of appropriate concentration using the same reaction conditions as for the plasma samples .
all cdna was used immediately in qpcr reactions or stored at - 20degreesc for use within one week .
following reverse transcription , as recommended by the manufacturer , the cdna was further diluted by addition of 28.9 microl h2o in order to achieve a final dilution of 1:15 of the rt product .
2.25 microl of the diluted rt product were then used as template in a triplicate qpcr with a total reaction volume of 10 microl .

relative levels of mirnas in haemolysed and non - haemolysed plasma ( figure 5 ) were calculated using either the 2 - deltacq or the 2 - deltadeltacq method [ 34 ] .
briefly , in case of 2 - deltacq ( figure 5a ) deltacq was calculated for each mir by subtracting the cq of the non - haemolysed samples from its matching haemolysed value .
for 2 - deltadeltacq calculations for each sample the first deltacq was calculated by subtracting the mir - 16 value from the cq of the mir of interest .
the deltacq of the non - haemolysed sample was then subtracted from that of its matching haemolysed sample .

monoubiquitination is a major histone post - translational modification .
in humans , the histone h2b k120 and histone h4 k31 residues are monoubiquitinated and may form transcriptionally active chromatin .
in this study , we reconstituted nucleosomes containing h2b monoubiquitinated at position 120 ( h2bub120 ) and / or h4 monoubiquitinated at position 31 ( h4ub31 ) .
we found that the h2bub120 and h4ub31 monoubiquitinations differently affect nucleosome stability : the h2bub120 monoubiquitination enhances the h2a - h2b association with the nucleosome , while the h4ub31 monoubiquitination decreases the h3 - h4 stability in the nucleosome , when compared with the unmodified nucleosome .
the h2bub120 and h4ub31 monoubiquitinations both antagonize the mg2 + - dependent compaction of a poly - nucleosome , suggesting that these monoubiquitinations maintain more relaxed conformations of chromatin .
in the crystal structure , the h2bub120 and h4ub31 monoubiquitinations do not change the structure of the nucleosome core particle and the ubiquitin molecules were flexibly disordered in the h2bub120 / h4ub31 nucleosome structure .
these results revealed the differences and similarities of the h2bub120 and h4ub31 monoubiquitinations at the mono - and poly - nucleosome levels and provide novel information to clarify the roles of monoubiquitination in chromatin .

introduction in eukaryotes , genomic dna is folded into a higher - order structure called chromatin and is accommodated within the nucleus [ 1 ] .
the nucleosome is the basic repeating unit of chromatin , and histone proteins are highly conserved components .
in the nucleosome , four core histones , h2a , h2b , h3 and h4 , specifically form the h2a - h2b and h3 - h4 heterodimeric complexes with histone - fold domains and two each of the h2a - h2b and h3 - h4 dimers constitute the histone octamer [ 2 ] .
the 145 - 147 base - pair dna segments are left - handedly wrapped by about 1.7 turns around the histone octamer in the nucleosome [ 3 - 5 ] .
the activities of genomic dna , such as transcription , must be regulated in chromatin [ 6 ] .
however , the dna is generally inaccessible in chromatin , and therefore the dna - binding proteins functioning in transcription must overcome the chromatin barrier [ 7 - 10 ] .
numerous histone modifications and histone variants contribute to the structural and physical versatility of nucleosomes and affect the chromatin dynamics , and thus play a crucial role to accomplish the regulation of genomic dna in chromatin [ 10 - 21 ] .
acylation , methylation and phosphorylation are well - known chemical modifications of histones [ 11 - 15 ] .
in addition , the covalent attachment of a small protein , ubiquitin , has also been identified as a histone lysine modification [ 22 ] .
these histone modifications are considered to function in organizing the chromatin domains , such as transcriptionally active euchromatin and inactive heterochromatin .
for example , histone acetylation is commonly detected in euchromatic regions , and histone methylations , such as the h3 k9 and k27 methylations , are predominantly found in heterochromatic regions [ 12 - 14 ] .
similarly , for histone ubiquitination , histone h2b k120 ( k123 for budding yeast ) monoubiquitination is present in transcriptionally active genes [ 23 - 25 ] .
histone h4 k31 monoubiquitination is reportedly also associated with active chromatin regions [ 26 ]. by contrast , histone h2a monoubiquitination is mainly found in facultative heterochromatin , such as the inactive x chromosome , and in regions containing silenced genes [ 27 - 30 ] .
therefore , the monoubiquitination of individual histones at certain amino acid residues may have a distinct function and probably affects the structure and physical properties of the nucleosome .
accordingly , h2b k120 monoubiquitination reportedly inhibits the compaction of poly - nucleosomes in vitro [ 31 ] .
however , the molecular mechanism by which the ubiquitin molecule affects the chromatin conformation has not been clarified yet .
in this study , we prepared human histones h2b and h4 , in which ubiquitin molecules were chemically conjugated at h2b - 120 and h4 - 31 , respectively .
we then performed biochemical and structural analyses of nucleosomes and poly - nucleosomes containing these monoubiquitinated histones h2b and h4 in vitro .
2. results 2.1 .
reconstitution of nucleosomes containing monoubiquitinated histones h2b and h4 to study the effect of the histone monoubiquitination on the characteristics of the nucleosome , we prepared histones h2b and h4 that were monoubiquitinated at positions 120 and 31 , respectively .
to do so , the h2b k120c and h4 k31c mutants , in which the h2b k120 and h4 k31 residues were replaced by cysteine , respectively , were purified as recombinant proteins , and the ubiquitin molecule was chemically conjugated by a disulfide bond to the h2b c120 and h4 c31 residues [ 32 ] .
in this study , the h2b and h4 proteins that were monoubiquitinated at the 120 and 31 positions by this method were named h2bub120 and h4ub31 , respectively .
we then reconstituted the nucleosomes containing h2bub120 or h4ub31 and purified them by preparative native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
the purified h2bub120 and h4ub31 nucleosomes migrated slowly on the native polyacrylamide gel , when compared with the unmodified nucleosome , due to the two conjugated ubiquitin molecules ( figure 1a ) .
an analysis by sds - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the monoubiquitinated h2b and h4 were stoichiometrically incorporated into the nucleosomes , and only trace amounts of ubiquitin - free h2b and h4 were detected ( figure 1b ) .
these results indicated that the h2bub120 and h4ub31 molecules were properly assembled into the nucleosomes .

2.2 .
monoubiquitinations of h2b and h4 differently affect the nucleosome stability we then tested the stability of the h2bub120 and h4ub31 nucleosomes by a thermal stability assay .
in this assay , nucleosome disruption was monitored as the fluorescence signal of sypro orange bound to thermally denatured histones , which are released from the nucleosome ( figure 2a ) .
consistent with the previous results [ 33 ] , the unmodified nucleosome was disrupted with a bi - phasic denaturation curve , in which the first peak ( tm = 70 - 71degreesc ) and second peak ( tm = 82 - 83degreesc ) corresponded to the dissociation phases for h2a - h2b and h3 - h4 from the nucleosome , respectively ( figure 2b ) .

( d ) thermal stability curves of the h4ub31 nucleosomes in the presence ( filled diamonds ) or absence ( open diamonds ) of 10 mm dithiothreitol .
the normalized fluorescence intensities were plotted against each temperature from 60degreesc to 90degreesc .
means +/ - s.d .
( n = 3 ) are shown .
the derivative values of each stability curve are represented in ( b - d ) , with standard deviations ( n = 3 ) .
in these samples , the ubiquitin molecule was easily detached by a reducing agent , such as dithiothreitol .
we then performed the thermal stability assay under conditions with or without dithiothreitol .
under the monoubiquitinated conditions ( without dithiothreitol ) , the first peak of the h2bub120 nucleosome was substantially shifted towards a higher temperature ( tm = 72 - 73degreesc ) , when compared with the experiments under the deubiquitinated conditions ( with dithiothreitol ) ( figure 2c ) .
these results indicate that the h2b monoubiquitination at position 120 enhances the association of h2a - h2b with the nucleosome .
interestingly , under the monoubiquitinated conditions ( without dithiothreitol ) , the h4ub31 nucleosome exhibited a distinct thermal denaturation curve , in which the second peak slightly shifted toward a lower temperature , and the height of the first peak was drastically increased ( figure 2d ) .
this thermal denaturation profile of the h4ub nucleosome is very similar to that of a nucleosome with unstable h3 - h4 , such as a nucleosome with the centromere - specific h3 , cenp - a [ 34 ] .
therefore , the h4 k31 monoubiquitination may destabilize the association of h3 - h4 with the nucleosome .
this characteristic thermal denaturation profile of the h4ub31 nucleosome disappeared in the presence of dithiothreitol ( figure 2d ) , indicating that the h4 monoubiquitination at position 31 is actually responsible for decreasing the nucleosome stability , in contrast with the h2b monoubiquitination .
2.3 .
crystal structure of the nucleosome containing h2b and h4 monoubiquitinations we next studied whether the monoubiquitinations of h2b and h4 affect the nucleosome structure .
we successfully reconstituted the nucleosome containing both h2bub120 and h4ub31 , and thus the h2b - k120 and h4 - k31 monoubiquitinations are not mutually exclusive ( figure 3a,b ) .
we then determined the crystal structure of the nucleosome containing h2bub120 and h4ub31 ( the h2bub120 / h4ub31 nucleosome ) .
in the crystal structure , the nucleosome core structure was not changed by the h2b and h4 monoubiquitinations , although the ubiquitin molecules were not visible ( figure 3c ) .
we confirmed that the ubiquitin molecules were not detached and were still covalently conjugated to the nucleosomal histones h2b and h4 in the crystals ( figure 3d ) .
in the crystals , the h2bub120 / h4ub31 nucleosomes contacted each other with a space that could accommodate four ubiquitin molecules ( figure 3e,f ) .
therefore , the ubiquitin moieties conjugated to the nucleosomal h2b and h4 were located between the h2bub120 / h4ub31 nucleosomes in the crystal and were quite flexible .

recently , the crystal structure of the h2bub120 nucleosome bound to the deubiquitinating module of the saga complex ( saga - dub ) was reported [ 35 ] .
in the complex , saga - dub directly bound to the acidic patch of the nucleosome surface and the ubiquitin molecule , but did not contact the nucleosome surface , except for its conjugation site .
in the saga - dub - nucleosome complex , the ubiquitin molecule was clearly visible , because its flexibility is restricted by binding to saga - dub .
2.4 .
the h4 monoubiquitination at position 31 inhibits chromatin compaction , similar to the h2b monoubiquitination the h2b k120 monoubiquitination reportedly suppresses chromatin compaction [ 31 ] .
to test whether the h4 monoubiquitination also affects chromatin compaction , we reconstituted poly - nucleosomes with h2bub120 or h4ub31 ( figure 4a ) .
twelve nucleosomes were assembled on tandem repeats of 208 base - pair 601 dnas ( figure 4a ) .
the h2bub120 and h4ub31 poly - nucleosomes were both reconstituted as efficiently as the unmodified poly - nucleosome ( figure 4b,c ) .
the restriction enzyme ( scai ) digestion analysis confirmed that trace amounts of the nucleosome - free 601 dna segments were detected ( figure 4d ) .
these results indicated that the h2bub120 and h4ub31 poly - nucleosomes were properly reconstituted .

( e ) analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity analyses of the polynucleosomes .
sedimentation velocity analyses of the unmodified ( open circles ) , h2bub120 ( open triangles ) and h4ub31 ( open diamonds ) poly - nucleosomes were performed in the absence of mgcl2 .
the sedimentation coefficient ( s20,w ) distributions were calculated by the enhanced van holde and weischet method .
( f ) sedimentation velocity analyses of the unmodified ( closed circles ) , h2bub120 ( closed triangles ) and h4ub31 ( closed diamonds ) poly - nucleosomes were performed in the presence of 1.25 mm mgcl2 .
the sedimentation coefficient ( s20,w ) distributions were calculated by the enhanced van holde and weischet method .
we then performed a sedimentation velocity analysis by analytical ultracentrifugation [ 36 ] .
consistent with a previous report [ 31 ] , the h2bub120 poly - nucleosome exhibited sedimentation values of about 30s , similar to the unmodified poly - nucleosome in the absence of mg2 + ion ( figure 4e ) , but migrated more slowly than the unmodified poly - nucleosome in the presence of mgcl2 ( 1.25 mm ) ( figure 4f ) .
these results indicate that the h2b monoubiquitination reproducibly suppressed the mg2 + - dependent chromatin compaction .
we then tested whether the h4 monoubiquitination at position 31 affects chromatin compaction , because like the h2b monoubiquitination , it may also function in transcription activation [ 26 ] .
our sedimentation velocity analysis revealed that the h4ub31 poly - nucleosome also exhibited slow sedimentation , similar to that of the h2bub120 poly - nucleosome , in the presence of mg2 + ion ( figure 4f ) .
the sedimentation values of the h4ub31 poly - nucleosome were indistinguishable from those of the unmodified and h2bub120 poly - nucleosomes in the absence of mg2 + ion ( figure 4e ) .
these results indicated that the monoubiquitination at position 31 of h4 antagonizes chromatin compaction , similar to the h2b k120 monoubiqitination .
3. discussion monoubiquitination of core histones has been identified as a major histone modification [ 11 - 14,22 ] .
substantial amounts ( about 1 - 5 % for h2b ) of core histones are monoubiquitinated in cells [ 22 ] , suggesting that the contribution of histone monoubiquitinations in genome function may be important .
in this study , we focused on the h2b and h4 monoubiquitinations , which are found in the transcriptionally active loci of genomes , and reconstituted nucleosomes with ubiquitin molecules conjugated at the h2b - 120 and / or h4 - 31 positions .
we then performed biochemical and structural analyses .
monoubiquitinations of the h2b k120 and h4 k31 residues have been proposed to stimulate transcription [ 23,24,26,37,38 ] .
consistent with this idea , the poly - nucleosomes containing h2bub120 or h4ub31 formed a more relaxed conformation , when compared with that of the unmodified poly - nucleosomes , under the physiological mg2 + conditions ( figure 4 ) .
these results suggested that the h2b k120 and h4 k31 monoubiquitinations may confer a relaxed chromatin formation that is favourable for transcription factor binding and rna polymerase passage .
however , we found that the impact on the nucleosome stability is different between the h2bub120 and h4ub31 nucleosomes ( figure 2 ) , although the structure of the nucleosome core particle was not affected ( figure 3 ) .
our thermal stability assay revealed that the stability of the h4ub31 nucleosome is lower than that of the unmodified nucleosome ( figure 2 ) .
in the nucleosome structure , the h4 k31 residues are located close to the dna ( figure 3c ) and may interact with the dna backbone by water - mediated hydrogen bonding [ 4 ] .
the h4 k31 monoubiquitination may disrupt these interactions and cause nucleosome instability .
to our surprise , we found that the h2bub120 nucleosome is more stable than the unmodified nucleosome ( figure 2 ) .
similar nucleosome stabilization by h2b k123 monoubiquitination in yeast has been reported [ 39 ] .
in contrast with the k31 residue of h4 , the h2b k120 residues are exposed to the solvent in the nucleosome ( figure 3c ) [ 3,4,40 ] and may not affect the histone - dna interactions within the nucleosome .
a plausible explanation for the h2b monoubiquitination - mediated stabilization of the nucleosome is that the ubiquitin molecules conjugated to the nucleosomal h2b molecules may interact with the histones within the nucleosome .
the acidic patch may be an interactive site for the ubiquitin .
although the ubiquitin molecule does not directly interact with the histone surface in the saga - dub - nucleosome complex , the ubiquitin molecule conjugated to the h2b k120 residue is located in a position that can directly interact with the acidic patch of the nucleosome surface , in the absence of saga - dub [ 35 ]. by contrast , the ubiquitin molecule conjugated to the h4 k31 residue may be too far away to directly interact with the acidic patch .
understanding the mechanism of nucleosome stabilization by the h2b monoubiquitination at position 120 is an important issue to be addressed next .
the different stabilities between the h2bub120 and h4ub31 nucleosomes suggest the distinct roles of the h2b and h4 monoubiquitinations .
for example , the h4 k31 monoubiquitination renders the nucleosome more displacable and may facilitate rna polymerase passage through nucleosomal dna in gene bodies. by contrast , the h2b k120 monoubiquitination may function as a mark for specific chromosome loci by its stable association .
given that these monoubiquitinations are incorporated into gene body regions , the different stabilities of the h2bub120 , h4ub31 and unmodified nucleosomes may regulate the velocity of the rna polymerase passage , and thus may control rna production .
further studies of genomic localizations , gene expression and chromosome dynamics will clarify how the monoubiquitinations of histones contribute to the control of genomic dna function in cells .

preparation of poly - nucleosomes the poly - nucleosomes for the sedimentation velocity analysis were reconstituted with the histone octamer and the dsdna containing twelve 208 base - pair widom601 dna sequence repeats ( histone octamer / widom601 sequence ratio = 1.8 ) , as described previously [ 49 ] .
briefly , the dna was mixed with the histone octamer in a 2 m nacl solution , containing 10 mm tris - hcl ( ph 7.5 ) and 1 mm edta .
the nacl concentration was gradually decreased to 250 mm , using a peristaltic pump .
the reconstituted poly - nucleosomes were further purified by non - denaturing agarose - acrylamide composite gel ( 0.7 % agarose and 2 % acrylamide ) electrophoresis , using a prep cell apparatus ( bio - rad ) .
4.8 .
analytical ultracentrifugation analysis the poly - nucleosomes reconstituted on the 12 widom601 sequence repeats were dialysed against 10 mm tris - hcl ( ph 7.5 ) buffer , in the absence or presence of 1.25 mm mgcl2 .
sedimentation velocity analyses were performed with a proteomelab xl - i analytical centrifuge ( beckman coulter ) .
the samples ( od260 = 0.6 - 0.8 ) were incubated for 2 h at 20degreesc under vacuum conditions and were then centrifuged at 22 000 rpm in 12 mm double - sector cells .
collected data were analysed by the enhanced van holde - weischet method , using ultrascanii 9.9 revision 1927 [ 50 ] .
sedimentation coefficients ( s20,w ) were calculated with a partial specific volume of 0.65 ml g - 1 [ 36 ] .
4.9 .
scai analysis the scai analysis was performed by the method reported previously [ 42,49 ] .
the poly - nucleosomes ( 30 microm ) reconstituted on the 12 widom601 sequence repeats were treated with scai ( 14 units ) in a reaction solution , containing 15 mm tris - hcl ( ph 7.5 ) , 55 mm nacl , 1 mm dithiothreitol , 100 microg ml - 1 bsa , 5 % glycerol and 0.5 mm mgcl2 .
after incubation at 22degreesc for 12 h , the samples were analysed by non - denaturing 5 % acrylamide gel electrophoresis with etbr staining .

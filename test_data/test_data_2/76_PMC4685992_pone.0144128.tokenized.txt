whole - cell matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization time - of - flight mass spectrometry ( whole - cell maldi - tof ms ) has been widely adopted as a useful technology in the identification and typing of microorganisms .
this study employed the whole - cell maldi - tof ms to identify and differentiate wild - type and mutants containing constructed single gene mutations of burkholderia pseudomallei , a pathogenic bacterium causing melioidosis disease in both humans and animals .
candidate biomarkers for the b. pseudomallei mutants , including rpos , ppk , and bpsi isolates , were determined .
taxon - specific and clinical isolate - specific biomarkers of b. pseudomallei were consistently found and conserved across all average mass spectra .
cluster analysis of maldi spectra of all isolates exhibited separate distribution .
a total of twelve potential mass peaks discriminating between wild - type and mutant isolates were identified using clinprotools analysis .
two peaks ( m / z 2721 and 2748 da ) were specific for the rpos isolate , three ( m / z 3150 , 3378 , and 7994 da ) for ppk , and seven ( m / z 3420 , 3520 , 3587 , 3688 , 4623 , 4708 , and 5450 da ) for bpsi .
our findings demonstrated that the rapid , accurate , and reproducible mass profiling technology could have new implications in laboratory - based rapid differentiation of extensive libraries of genetically altered bacteria .

introduction the matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization time - of - flight mass spectrometry ( maldi - tof ms ) approach is currently becoming a revolutionizing technology for use in the identification and typing of several diverse microorganisms , e.g. , gram - positive and negative bacteria , yeast , and fungi [ 1 - 7 ] .
this is a newly developed platform , which has been increasingly utilized in various microbiological applications , including routine clinical diagnosis , microbial systematics , environmental microbiology , epidemiological studies , and biodefense detection [ 8 - 11 ] .
maldi - tof ms offers rapid , robust , and economic analysis in comparison to conventional phenotypic and molecular techniques , making it an attractive and desirable tool for rapid microbial examination [ 12 , 13 ] .
whole - cell maldi - tof ms analysis requires simple steps in sample preparation without additional analyte extraction steps .
there are two possible methods : 1 ) utilizes single colonies grown on culture media deposited directly on a maldi target plate , then overlaid with a matrix solution ; and 2 ) exploits the mixture of whole cells suspended in a matrix solution before being analyzed using a mass spectrometer [ 14 ] .
conceptually , mass spectral pattern profiles obtained from the whole - cell maldi - tof ms method encompass unique mass profiles for particular microbial species [ 15 ] , enabling the discrimination of each microbial type. with the biotyper - based identification process , the maldi mass spectra are subsequently matched against the reference spectra entries in a database , rendering scores for the reliable identification of test isolates at genus , species , and subspecies levels [ 16 , 17 ] .
currently , whole - cell maldi - tof ms is being increasingly adopted and evolved for detection of antibiotic resistance , recombinant proteins , and plasmid insertion in bacteria [ 18 - 23 ] .
in vibrio parahaemolyticus , the ability to differentiate the wild - type and mutant strains with single gene deletions , according to their unique mass spectra , has been reported using whole - cell maldi - tof ms [ 24 ] .
moreover , when combining it with sophisticated algorithms , this approach can generate potential biomarkers pertaining to each microbial type and strain [ 17 ] .
this allows for a more advanced level of identification and classification among microorganisms. b. pseudomallei is a pathogenic bacterium causing melioidosis disease in both humans and animals .
it is endemic in northeastern thailand and northern australia , with the high mortality rates of approximately 40 % and 20 % , respectively [ 25 , 26 ] .
moreover , b. pseudomallei has been classified by the centers of disease control and prevention ( cdc ) as a category b bioweapon agent [ 27 ] .
identification and characterization of b. pseudomallei isolates have been relied on various molecular methods , which were pcr - based or hybridization - based techniques , such as multilocus sequence typing ( mlst ) , ribotyping , restriction fragment length polymorphism ( rflp ) , and microarray - based comparative genome hybridization ( cgh ) [ 28 - 31 ] .
although , these methods provide sufficient bacterial identification , they are time - consuming , labor intensive , and have high costs [ 32 , 33 ] .
maldi - tof has emerged as an alternative identification tool to rapidly and accurately detect b. pseudomallei in blood cultures of septicemic patients , and thus would be beneficial for medical diagnosis and prevention of melioidosis [ 34 ] .
additionally , maldi - tof ms has been applied for discovering of the potential taxon - specific and source - specific biomarkers for b. pseudomallei in different samples [ 35 , 36 ] .
a recent report from cox et al. has further shown the utility of phage - amplification - based maldi - tof ms as a rapid tool in determining ceftazidime resistance in b. pseudomallei [ 37 ] .
however , to the best of our knowledge , there have been no known reports of the use of whole - cell maldi - tof ms in the differentiation between b. pseudomallei wild - type and mutants derived from single gene mutations. with the availability of extensive libraries of genetically modified microorganisms in the laboratories , whole - cell maldi - tof ms could be utilized as a rapid laboratory - based technique to classify bioengineered bacteria .
in the present study , four isolates , including one strain of wild - type pp844 and three constructed mutants ( rpos , ppk , and bpsi ) , were analyzed .
the rpos , ppk , and bpsi isolates were constructed by gene knockdowns in the respective location [ 38 - 40 ] .
these isolates have been widely examined for their roles in oxidative stress response , quorum sensing regulation , and the pathogenesis of b. pseudomallei [ 38 - 42 ] .
we assessed the applicability of the whole - cell maldi - tof ms for rapid identification and differentiation between the b. pseudomallei wild - type and mutants containing constructed single gene mutations .
we then investigated the specific biomarkers of each mutant isolate .
materials and methods bacterial isolates and growth conditions the four bacterial strains utilized for maldi - tof ms in this study were the wild - type clinical isolate pp844 , isolated from blood culture , and the three constructed rpos , ppk , and bpsi mutants carrying gene disruption in rpos , ppk , and bpsi genes , respectively .
gene disruption , using the pknock - tcr suicide vector , was carried out in pp844 for the construction of rpos and bpsi mutants and in nf10 / 38 for the ppk isolate .
these mutants have been characterized with their gene disruptions by molecular biology methods as previously published [ 38 - 40 ] .
bacterial samples were kept in 80 % glycerol and managed under bsl3 conditions .
each bacterial strain was recovered from storage at - 80degreesc by culturing on luria - bertani ( lb ) agar .
for the selection of mutants , tetracycline was supplemented into the medium with a final concentration of 60 mug / ml. a single colony was picked and grown in lb broth with aerobic shaking at 37degreesc for 16 hours .
all of the overnight - cultured bacteria were then inoculated into 0.1 % inoculum and aerobically incubated at 37degreesc for 3 hours with agitation .
subsequently , the bacteria were serially diluted and grown on ashdown 's selective agar to ensure selection for growth of b. pseudomallei and incubated at 37degreesc for 7 days to obtain the colonies .
maldi - tof sample preparation the microbial samples for maldi - tof analysis were prepared using previously described method [ 36 ] .
in brief , the colonies which were grown on ashdown 's agar plate were transferred into 900 mul of water and then deactivated with 300 mul of ethanol .
the pellet was collected by centrifugation and mixed with a matrix solution containing 10 mg sinapinic acid in 1 ml of 50 % acetonitrile with 2.5 % trifluoroacetic acid .
two microliters of bacterial extract , with concentration approximately 0.3 - 0.5 mug / mul , were spotted on a maldi steel target plate ( mtp 384 ground steel plate , bruker daltonik , gmbh , bremen , germany ) and were dried at room temperature .
the escherichia coli dh5alpha was used as a positive control and the matrix solution without bacterial cells was used as a negative control .
twenty - four spots ( n = 24 ) from each sample were deposited on a target plate for determination of experimental reproducibility , thus each isolate was repeatedly examined twenty - four times .
after drying , the target plate was subjected to analysis in the maldi - tof instrument .
ms instrumentation maldi - tof analysis was carried out in an ultraflex iii tof / tof mass spectrometer utilized with a 337 nm n2 laser and was operated by flexcontrol software ( bruker daltonik , gmbh , bremen , germany ) .
the machine was run in the linear positive mode and mass spectra in the range of 2 - 20 kda were collected .
the following instrumental parameters were used : acceleration voltages of 25.00 and 23.45 kv for ion source 1 and ion source 2 , respectively , with a lens voltage of 6.0 kv. external calibration was performed to determine mass peak accuracy using a proteomasstm peptide & protein maldi - ms calibration kit ( sigma aldrich , st. louis , mo , united states ) consisting of human acth fragment 18 - 39 ( m / z 2465 ) , bovine insulin oxidized b chain ( m / z 3465 ) , bovine insulin ( m / z 5731 ) , equine cytochrome c ( m / z 12362 ) , and equine apomyoglobin ( m / z 16952 ) .
each spectrum was compiled from 500 laser shots , with a 50 hz laser .
data acquisition and analysis the twenty - four raw maldi spectra of each isolate acquired from the mass spectrometer were subjected to spectral processing , including peak detection , smoothing , baseline subtraction , and recalibration using flexanalysis 3.0 software ( bruker daltonik , gmbh , bremen , germany ) .
these spectra were used for pattern matching analysis to identify bacterial species using biotyper 2.0 software ( bruker daltonik , gmbh , bremen , germany ) and for determining candidate biomarkers of each mutant using clinprotools 2.2 software ( bruker daltonik , gmbh , bremen , germany ) .
a reference spectrum of the wild - type pp844 incorporated into biotyper database was generated .
single maldi mass spectra of all test isolates were subjected to the pattern matching analysis using biotyper 2.0 , with all peaks compared to the reference spectra in the database .
the first ranked microorganism query ( top hit ) with a score in the log scale ranging from 0 - 3 was obtained and bacteria identified at the genus ( a score between 1.7 - 1.89 ) and species levels ( a score >= 1.9 ) .
determination of candidate biomarkers for each mutant was analyzed by clinprotools 2.2 .
the software conducts data processing such as baseline subtraction , recalibration , and normalization to diminish measurement variations in the analysis , and data interpretation with statistical calculation included , allowing the generation of potential biomarkers from maldi profiles [ 43 ] .
moreover , three major statistical tests , consisting of anderson - darling ( ad ) , t - test / anova ( tta ) , and wilcoxon / krustal - wallis ( w / kw ) tests , have been incorporated into clinprotools to appropriately analyze the data with normal or non - normal distribution .
data with a normal distribution are subjected to tta test , while those of a non - normal distribution subjected to w / kw test and ad test determines whether test data are based on normal distribution assumption ( considering p - value of > 0.05 for normal distribution and of <= 0.05 for non - normal distribution ) .
the setting parameters for spectra preparation in clinprotools were : a resolution of 800 ppm , a mass range of 2000 - 20000 da , a top hat baseline subtraction with 10 % minimal baseline width , enabling null spectra exclusion , and recalibration with 500 ppm maximal peak shift and 30 % match calibrant peaks .
all maldi spectra were normalized against total ion current ( tic ) .
to identify candidate biomarkers of individual mutants , the average mass spectrum of each mutant was compared to that of wild - type pp844 ( pair test ) .
thus , degree of freedom value of each analysis ( 2 sample classes ) was 1 .
the average mass peak list of each pair test was acquired , after statistical analysis , based on the total average spectrum with a signal to noise threshold of 5.00 , and mass peak intensities were used in the peak calculation process .
the selected mass peaks , which exhibited p - values from ad test of <= 0.05 ( see table 1 ) , were subsequently analyzed using w / kw test .
specific biomarkers for a given mutant were manually selected according to p - values of w / kw statistics ( p < 0.001 ) and exhibited > 2 - fold differences in average peak intensity compared to wild - type .
the " leave one out " mode was used for cross validation analysis using quick classifier ( qc ) model .
the principal component analysis ( pca ) created based on the euclidian distance method and the unsupervised hierarchical clustering ( dendrogram ) constructed from pca - derived data were used to examine the clustering of all isolates .

a set of twenty - four single spectra of the wild - type pp844 strain was constructed as the reference spectrum and incorporated into biotyper database .
single maldi spectra of all isolates acquired from flexanalysis were subsequently subjected to bacterial identification analysis to achieve an identification score for each isolate .
scores acquired from biotyper analysis ranging from logarithmic scale 0.00 - 3.00 indicate levels of microorganism identification as follows : ( 1 ) a score >= 1.9 refers to a reliable identification at species level , ( 2 ) a score between 1.7 - 1.89 indicates a confident identification at genus level , and ( 3 ) a score < 1.7 denotes unreliable identification [ 12 , 35 ] .
our wild - type and mutants possessing scores ranging from 2.43 - 2.81 were identified as b. pseudomallei at the species level , the scores obtained for wild - type , rpos , ppk , and bpsi isolates were 2.81 , 2.54 , 2.64 , and 2.43 , respectively .
karger et al .
[ 35 ] have previously established five taxon - specific biomarkers , including m / z 4410 , 5794 , 6551 , 7553 , and 9713 da , that are commonly found in mass profiles of b. pseudomallei using the whole - cell maldi - tof ms approach .
these taxon - specific biomarkers were also shown to be conserved among environmental and clinical b. pseudomallei strains [ 36 ] .
to examine whether the five prominent biomarkers were presented in our maldi spectra , we determined these biomarkers in an average spectrum generated from twenty - four raw replicate spectra of each respective strain .
it was observed that all of the average spectra in both the wild - type and mutant isolates exhibited high similarities in peak patterns , with differing peak intensities ( fig 1 ) .
all isolates used in this study were confirmed as b. pseudomallei by the identification scores obtained from biotyper analysis and the existence of the five b. pseudomallei - specific biomarkers presented in our maldi average spectra ( appearing as vertical dashed lines in fig 1 ) .
however , the observed bacterial morphology of all isolates cultured on ashdown 's selective agar illustrated distinct colony phenotypes ( fig 2 ) , their components of ionized cell surface represented more reliable taxonomic identification as b. pseudomallei species based on whole - cell maldi - tof ms analysis .

five effective species - specific biomarkers , including m / z 4410 , 5794 , 6551 , 7553 , and 9713 , were detected in all of the average mass spectra examined ( the vertical dashed lines ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0144128.g002 fig 2 colony morphology of b. pseudomallei .
colony morphology of the strains was observed after incubation at 37degreesc for 7 days .
the rpos ( b ) , ppk ( c ) , and bpsi ( d ) mutants which contained each single gene mutation in rpos , ppk , and bpsi genes , respectively , showed distinct morphology from the wild - type ( a ) .
identification of clinical isolate - specific biomarkers the two b. pseudomallei , pp844 and nf10 / 38 , were clinical isolates used as parental strains for mutant construction .
pp844 was isolated from the blood culture of a patient , admitted to srinagarind hospital , khon kaen province , thailand , where melioidosis is endemic .
it was identified as b. pseudomallei based on its biochemical characteristics , colonial morphology on selective media , antibiotic sensitivity profiles , and reaction with polyclonal antibody [ 44 ] .
nf10 / 38 was a blood culture isolate , obtained from the national institute of health , ministry of public health , thailand [ 45 ] .
target gene disruption was carried out in pp844 for the construction of rpos and bpsi mutants and in nf10 / 38 for the ppk strain , as previously reported [ 38 - 40 ] .
all bacterial isolates were kept as glycerol stocks for conducting experiments in laboratory and were cultivated on ashdown 's selective agar to affirm the absence of any microorganism contaminations .
all laboratory operations were performed under bsl3 conditions .
our previous studies using clinprotools software revealed that the four biomarkers specific to clinical isolates ( m / z 3658 , 6322 , 7035 , and 7984 da ) displayed significantly higher peak intensities in the clinical average spectrum than those of the environmental average spectrum in b. pseudomallei [ 36 ] .
each average maldi spectrum obtained of both the wild - type and the three mutants contained the four typical clinical isolate - specific biomarkers ( m / z 3658 , 6322 , 7035 , and 7984 da ) as shown in fig 3 , supporting their clinical origin .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0144128.g003 fig 3 clinical isolate - specific biomarkers in b. pseudomallei average mass spectra .
all four biomarkers , including m / z 3658 , 6322 , 7035 , and 7984 da , were detected in all of the average mass spectra examined ( the vertical dashed lines ) .
cluster analysis to determine whether maldi profiles of each mutant with a single gene mutation were distributed in a distinct cluster , the total of single maldi spectra of pp844 , rpos , ppk , and bpsi isolates were subjected to pca and unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses using clinprotools. e. coli dh5alpha was used as an outgroup species in analyses .
all isolates exhibited distinctly separate distribution , as illustrated by results of pca score plot ( fig 4a ) .
the unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis derived from the pca scores , resulting in a dendrogram ( fig 4b ) , revealed that pp844 , rpos , and ppk clustered in the same clade .
in addition , the rpos and ppk isolates were grouped closer and displayed the shortest distance among all the bacterial isolates tested .
this indicated a high similarity in maldi profiles between rpos and ppk .
it was observed that a clade of bpsi isolate showed a greater distribution from the others .
hence , based on this study , the whole - cell maldi - tof ms technique could be used to distinguish b. pseudomallei mutants containing single gene disruptions from the wild - type pp844 .

( b ) dendrogram derived from pca scores demonstrates that b. pseudomallei pp844 , rpos , and ppk clustered on the same clade , while a clade of bpsi showed a greater distance than others .
candidate biomarkers comparison between maldi spectra of pp844 , rpos , ppk , and bpsi isolates revealed visually slight , but significant changes in mass intensities .
to determine the biomarkers specific to each strain observed from the whole - cell maldi - tof ms analysis , the average mass spectrum of each of the three mutants was individually compared against that of the pp844 wild - type ( pair test ) using clinprotools .
we employed the statistical approach incorporated with clinprotools to provide the average mass peak list of each pair test ( signal to noise threshold of 5.00 in the mass range of 2 - 20 kda ) .
subsequently all peaks were evaluated referring to fold differences of average peak intensities and the p - value from w / kw statistical calculation .
the average peak intensity was calculated from peak intensity of the respective mutant isolate divided by that of the wild - type .
as listed in table 1 and displayed in fig 5 , the specific biomarkers for each mutant displayed significant differences ( p < 0.001 ) and > 2 - fold differences in average peak intensity. with these analyses , the mass peaks at m / z 2721 and 2748 da were identified for the rpos isolate , while the peaks at m / z 3150 , 3378 , and 7994 da were specific for ppk .
a total of seven mass peaks were defined for bpsi isolate , with a mass ranging from m / z 3000 - 6000 , including m / z 3420 , 3520 , 3587 , 3688 , 4623 , 4708 , and 5450 da. moreover , quick classifier ( qc ) model , a univariate sorting algorithm that statistically calculates individual peak area , was used to evaluate cross validation of all data sets .
a value of 100 % was obtained , indicating high reliability of the model prediction and thus accurate classification of test isolates .
in addition , the area under the roc curve ( auc ) value of individual mass peaks was determined , with each mass peak showed the auc value of 1 , indicating 100 % sensitivity ( all true positives were found ) and 100 % specificity ( no false positives were found ) .
however the same level of specificity and sensitivity might not be achieved if larger number of samples was examined .
all together these mass peaks , unique to each isolate , could be potential biomarkers in order to facilitate the differentiation of the corresponding b. pseudomallei wild - type and mutants .

all of the candidate biomarkers were selected from clinprotools analysis on the basis of w / kw statistics with significance at p < 0.001 and exhibiting average peak intensity differences > 2 - fold .
the biomarkers at m / z 2721 and 2748 da were identified for rpos ( a ) , m / z 3150 , 3378 , and 7994 da for ppk ( b ) , and m / z 3420 , 3520 , 3587 , 3688 , 4623 , 4708 , and 5450 da for bpsi ( c ) .

discussion in the present study , we have accomplished the accurate identification of b. pseudomallei wild - type and mutant isolates with scores ranging from 2.43 - 2.81 using biotyper analysis .
five taxon - specific biomarkers previously determined among b. pseudomallei species , including m / z 4410 , 5794 , 6551 , 7553 , and 9713 da [ 35 ] , were investigated .
these five prominent species - specific biomarkers were detected on the average spectra of the wild - type and mutants ( fig 1 ) , which were confirmed as the b. pseudomallei species , in agreement with the results previously reported [ 35 ] .
these results indicated the capacity of the whole - cell maldi - tof technique to consistently produce conserved and stable mass peaks in the examined bacterial species .
moreover , as shown in fig 2 , these mutants , whose parent was clinical b. pseudomallei isolates , exhibited various different phenotypes that did not conform to those morphologies previously observed [ 46 ] .
nonetheless their maldi profiles identified them as b. pseudomallei species .
these results implied that maldi profiles generated from desorbed components of bacterial cell surface were more reliable than identification based on colony morphology .
however , it could also be possible that certain proteins affected by the mutated genes were responsible for the distinct colony appearances .
as displayed in figs 1 and 3 , the maldi mass patterns for these wild - type and mutants were relatively similar , with nearly identical and differential peak intensities observed .
similar concentrations of each bacterial isolate ( see materials and methods ) were used in sample preparation , mass peaks could then be compared .
nearly identical peak intensities observed for isolates in each pair test could be referred as internal controls for comparison .
each sample displayed differential peak intensities at particular mass peaks , thus reflected different protein expressions .
this could possibly be caused by gene knockdown in each mutant .
the mutants examined in our study , including rpos , ppk , and bpsi , have shown their roles involving the regulation of stress responses , virulence , and pathogenicity of b. pseudomallei .
rpos is an alternative sigma factor encoded from the rpos gene and plays a role in the stationary growth phase in response to carbon starvation and oxidative stress [ 38 , 47 ] , and could regulate apoptotic cell deaths in mouse macrophages [ 48 ] .
the ppk gene is naturally conserved in all cell types and encodes a polyphosphate kinase enzyme to synthesize inorganic polyphosphates ( poly p ) [ 49 ] .
its role in b. pseudomallei is essential for the virulence properties , such as oxidative stress response , motilities , and biofilm formation [ 39 ] .
the bpsi protein , encoded from the bpsi gene , regulates acyl - homoserine lactone ( ahl ) production and functions in the quorum sensing ( qs ) system [ 50 ] , an important system involved in cell survival under oxidative conditions , as well as pathogenicity and production of virulence factors [ 40 - 42 ] .
as shown in fig 3 , the clinical isolate - specific biomarkers appeared in all mass spectra of wild - type and mutants .
consequently , the b. pseudomallei rpos , ppk , and bpsi isolates exhibited a clinical source manner whilst bearing target gene mutations , emphasizing their parental strains originated from the clinical source .
these results accentuated that the whole - cell maldi - tof ms could reproducibly generate reliable conserved biomarkers .
thus , the ability to rapidly and accurately identify these mutants using the clinical isolate - specific biomarkers would be advantageous for tracking original source of isolates .
the results of the pca and dendrogram clarified that all examined isolates were separately distributed , with rpos and ppk clustered at a much closer distance ( fig 4a and 4b ) .
it was notable that patterns of rpos and ppk mass profiles contained a high degree of similarity but were not identical , reflecting disruptions of these two genes and the corresponding patterns in their altered protein expressions .
despite high similarity of their maldi profiles , there is no known evidence concerning cross - talk regulation or correlation between rpos and ppk in b. pseudomallei .
interestingly , bpsi further separated from the others , indicating different and unique ionized protein patterns .
other proteins associated with the qs system , in response to ahls that play role in communication between bacteria and pathogenesis [ 40 - 42 ] , might contribute to the mass profiles observed with the bpsi mutant strain .
hence , our results supported that the whole - cell maldi - tof ms technique could be a promising method to distinguish mutants with altered single gene mutations .
our conclusions are in agreement with hazen et al [ 24 ] , where whole - cell maldi - tof ms in vibrio parahaemolyticus was used to differentiate the two mutant strains , opar ( quorum sensing regulator gene ) and muts ( mismatch repair gene ) bearing single gene deletions .
the use of sophisticated algorithms complementary with whole - cell maldi tof ms can also generate potential biomarkers specific for each isolate type or strain [ 17 ] , thus providing greater identification and classification of microorganisms .
in our study , biomarker analysis of maldi profiles of all isolates , rigorously performed with data processing methods and statistical analysis such as those featured in clinprotools to reduce bias and measurement variations ( see materials and methods ) resulted in accurate data interpretation .
in addition , through tic normalization in clinprotools , all of the twelve biomarkers demonstrated especially low values of coefficient of variation ( ranging from 0.07 - 0.28 , table 1 ) of each mass peaks , indicating sensitive and reliable data analysis in this study .
for the first time , we obtained a total of twelve candidate biomarkers that could be specified for rpos ( m / z 2721 and 2748 da ) , ppk ( m / z 3150 , 3378 , and 7994 da ) , and bpsi ( m / z 3420 , 3520 , 3587 , 3688 , 4623 , 4708 , and 5450 da ) .
these mass peaks containing the auc value of 1 could thus be potential biomarkers for the differentiation of the corresponding b. pseudomallei wild - type and mutants .
the whole - cell maldi - tof ms routinely detects mass peaks in the range of 2 - 20 kda which are small - size protein molecules , reflecting ribosomal proteins , nucleic - acid binding proteins , and cold shock proteins [ 4 , 51 , 52 ] .
an initial attempt to annotate the twelve biomarkers of the three mutant isolates using the expasy tagident tool identified these mass peaks corresponding to ribosomal proteins , cold shock - like proteins , and uncharacterized proteins ( unreported data ) .
other small to midsize molecules might also be encompassed in mass spectra in addition to those detected proteins .
maldi - tof / tof ms and maldi - tof ms combined with the shotgun nanolc - ms / ms analyses could be more straightforward approaches to identify the biomarkers on maldi mass spectra [ 53 - 56 ] .
our study has extended the utilization of whole - cell maldi - tof ms for distinguishing between wild - type and mutants possessing altered single gene mutations .
this whole - cell maldi - tof ms approach would benefit several laboratories that need to rapidly identify and classify extensive libraries of bacterial constructions based on maldi mass profiles .
moreover , to enhance the distinction power of maldi - tof , the creation and expansion of a local database in each laboratory should be considered .
this will allow for specific biomarker detection for more accurate identification and differentiation of microorganisms [ 8 , 12 , 15 ] .
conclusions there are several advantages , compared to conventional approaches , offered by whole - cell maldi - tof ms making it a powerful tool in microbiological research .
the distinctive spectral profiles generated from whole - cell maldi - tof ms is beneficial to species examination .
in addition to the ability to identify and type microbial isolates at different taxonomic levels , there is an increasing utilization of this technology in the detection of antibiotic resistance , recombinant proteins , and plasmid insertion in bacteria .
we demonstrated the efforts to use the whole - cell maldi - tof ms for distinguishing between b. pseudomallei wild - type and mutants , including pp844 , rpos , ppk , and bpsi , and further clarified the potential biomarkers that were specific to each isolate .
these whole sets of biomarkers could thus be employed in the identification and differentiation of individual b. pseudomallei , in particular of mutant isolates .

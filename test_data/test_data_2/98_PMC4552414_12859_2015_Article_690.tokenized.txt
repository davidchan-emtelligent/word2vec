the correct figure is provided here as fig. 1. the name of additional file 1 should be " supplemental figures " , not " sensitivity performance comparison for each test database. " the university of maryland , college park is located in college park , maryland , not college park , baltimore , maryland .
the correct addresses are provided in this erratum. fig. 1 illustration of simulated sequence fragmentation .
this example illustrates the four different ways in which the fragmentation scheme 1323 would be applied to a toy input test database with only three clusters containing sequences from only four organisms .
the four resulting test sets represent a cross of two variables , arranged here into rows and columns .
the sequences in the top row ( a & b ) have been split into even subsequences .
the sequences in the lower row ( c & d ) have been randomly fragmented into uneven subsequences .
in the left column ( a & c ) , the user - defined integer assigned to each organism directly determines the number of subsequences into which each sequence is split .
in the right column ( b & d ) , these integers are first mapped to all sequences within a cluster , but are then shuffled within that cluster before fragmentation the online version of the original article can be found under doi : 10.1186 / s12859 - 015 - 0625 - x. reference 1 .

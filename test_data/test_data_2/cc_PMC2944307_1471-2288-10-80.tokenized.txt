background poor response is a major concern in public health surveys .
in a population - based oriscav - lux study carried out in grand - duchy of luxembourg to assess the cardiovascular risk factors , the non - response rate was not negligible .
the aims of the present work were : 1 ) to investigate the representativeness of study sample to the general population , and 2 ) to compare the known demographic and cardiovascular health - related profiles of participants and non - participants .
methods for sample representativeness , the participants were compared to the source population according to stratification criteria ( age , sex and district of residence ) .
based on complementary information from the " medical administrative database " , further analysis was carried out to assess whether the health status affected the response rate .
several demographic and morbidity indicators were used in the univariate comparison between participants and non - participants .
results among the 4452 potentially eligible subjects contacted for the study , there were finally 1432 ( 32.2 %) participants .
compared to the source population , no differences were found for gender and district distribution. by contrast , the youngest age group was under - represented while adults and elderly were over - represented in the sample , for both genders .
globally , the investigated clinical profile of the non - participants was similar to that of participants .
hospital admission and cardiovascular health - related medical measures were comparable in both groups even after controlling for age .
the participation rate was lower in portuguese residents as compared to luxembourgish ( or = 0.58 , 95 % ci : 0.48 - 0.69 ) .
it was also significantly associated with the professional status ( p < 0.0001 ) .
subjects from the working class were less receptive to the study than those from other professional categories .
conclusion the 32.2 % participation rate obtained in the oriscav - lux survey represents the realistic achievable rate for this type of multiple - stage , nationwide , population - based surveys .
it corresponds to the expected rate upon which the sample size was calculated .
given the absence of discriminating health profiles between participants and non - participants , it can be concluded that the response rate does not invalidate the results and allows generalizing the findings for the population .
background poor response rate and sample representativeness are major concerns in prevalence public health surveys [ 1 - 5 ] .
nevertheless such studies are based on voluntary participation which depends basically on the subjects' willingness to take part .
the literature shows that response rates vary tremendously among surveys and are decreasing in most industrialized countries [ 6 ] .
in addition , the participation to health surveys requiring physical , anthropometric and blood examination of subjects tends to be even lower in comparison to only - questionnaire surveys [ 7 - 9 ] .
several factors affect the collaboration and participation of subjects , such as population characteristics , cultural attitudes , way of initial contact , length of time needed for full participation , follow - up procedure , legitimacy of the research from the subject 's viewpoint , and subject 's interest by the research topic [ 7 - 9 ] .
noteworthy , only few published studies drew attention to the real denominator ( total eligible sample ) to calculate the true participation rate .
this makes a comparison of response rates across similar studies quite difficult .
traditionally , a high response rate is dictated as a rule of thumb of good survey practice .
it is considered as an indicator of quality survey estimates , by presuming that a high response rate is associated with a more representative sample and hence with lower bias [ 10 ] .
though several studies showed that non - response can yield information with large potential bias [ 11,12 ] , recent empirical findings , based on relevant methodological studies by groves and colleagues , suggest however that changes in non - response rates do not necessarily alter survey estimates .
the link between non - response rate and bias is indirect and more complex [ 6 ] .
more and more , there is less support for the hypothesis that low response rate produces systematically high non - response bias estimates [ 6,13,10 - 16 ] .
moreover , the same group of experts in the field advised to anticipate the coverage error by applying a prior well - defined sampling frame so as to retain the value of unbiased sample despite low response rates [ 6,14,13 ] .
in short , non - response bias is a much more complex phenomenon than mere non - response rates , which needs to be investigated consistently in epidemiological surveys [ 17 ] .
the literature shows that non response is generally managed in two ways .
the first is by using response - enhancement strategies during survey development and data collection .
this approach is to influence positively the response rate [ 14,18 ] , particularly among those initially reluctant , as for example incentives for participation and reminders to non - responders [ 19 - 22 ] .
the second approach is the post - survey adjustment of data using weighting techniques to correct for non - response errors [ 18 ] .
observation of cardiovascular risk factors in luxembourg ( oriscav - lux ) is a nationwide cross - sectional cardiovascular monitoring survey , conducted between november 2007 and january 2009 , under the auspices of luxembourg 's ministry of health and co - financed by the ministry of research .
its major public health objective was to establish baseline information on the prevalence of various potentially modifiable cardiovascular risk factors among the non - institutionalized general adult population , aged 18 - 69 years .
luxembourg is a small country surrounded by belgium , france and germany , with a total population of 493,500 inhabitants ( statec official estimate , 2009 ) over an area of about 2,600 km2 .
luxembourgish people constitute approximately 56.3 % of the population , while the well - integrated foreign residents , constituting more than 150 nationalities , are mostly portuguese ( 16.2 %) , french ( 5.8 %) , italians ( 3.9 %) and belgians ( 3.4 %) .
the response rate attained 30 % in the oriscav - lux survey .
however , the low participation rate does not necessarily result in a selection bias [ 23,24 ] .
ideally , a separate investigation on non - participants is recommended to reveal potential outcome differences that might indicate reasons for non - participation and subsequent potential non - participation bias [ 5,23 ] .
to address this concern , the present paper aimed to 1 ) investigate the representativeness of the oriscav - lux sample with respect to the general population , and 2 ) compare the known demographic and cardiovascular health - related characteristics of participants and non participants .
methods overview of the survey the oriscav - lux survey was primarily designed to collect baseline cardiovascular health data from adult subjects aged 18 - 69 years residing in luxembourg .
such an epidemiological survey was never undertaken before in this country .
its methodology is described in detail elsewhere [ 25 ] .
basically , a representative random sample was drawn from the national health insurance registry , stratified by gender ( male and female ) , age ( 5 - year categories ) and geographic districts of residence ( luxembourg , diekirch and grevenmacher ). with a 98 % social coverage rate , the registry is considered as the most complete list of inhabitants available in luxembourg .
the minimal representative sample size was calculated to 1285 subjects to ensure statistical power [ 26 ] .
however , based on literature review and previous evidence with such multiple - stage population - based studies , a high non - participation rate was expected , including refusal , invalid addresses and non - response .
assuming a response rate of 30 % and a proportion of 5 % of institutionalized subjects in each stratum , the sample size was augmented to 4496 subjects .
the distribution of selected subjects in each stratum was proportional to their distribution in the source population ( adult population of 18 to 69 years residents in luxembourg ) .
pregnant women , people living in institutions , subjects outside the age range 18 - 69 years and those deceased before recruitment were excluded .
briefly , full participation included three major stages : ( i ) self completion questionnaire on demographic and socio - economic status , personal and family history of cardiovascular diseases and relevant cardiovascular risk factors including tobacco and alcohol consumption , physical activity , dietary habits and medication intake ; ( ii ) physical and anthropometric measurements ; and ( iii ) blood , urine and hair tests .
measures to increase participation intensive efforts were made to increase the response rate , not only during survey preparation but also during the participants' recruitment phase .
at kick - off phase , survey publicity , including flyers and media articles , were diffused to provide the selected individuals ample information about the study objectives , relevance to public health policies , ways of participation and participant 's rights .
a telephone number for inquiries was supplied and the oriscav - lux website was set up. a detailed personal invitation letter with a prepaid reply envelope addressed to the research centre was enclosed with each mailing .
the selected subjects were asked to send their approval and phone number for follow - up contact and appointment ; otherwise , they were requested to mention the reason of refusal with the purpose of obtaining a prior idea on the reasons of non - participation .
up to three written invitations ( first letter and 2 reminders ) were sent at monthly intervals to those who did not respond spontaneously .
they were followed by several telephone contacts by skilled personnel , in order to recruit the remaining non - respondents .
those who refused were not contacted again .
the field - nurses and phone interviewers were all trained and supplied with detailed manuals .
reluctant cases were followed up by the project manager by means of personal phone contact , to discuss the potential reasons and give them the opportunity to ask further questions about the study .
to ensure smooth and well organized data collection , several investigation centers dispatched all over the national territory were prepared to welcome the participants , every morning and occasionally on saturdays .
home visits were also proposed to those who had transport difficulties related to their health status .
due to the cultural diversity in luxembourg , all documents ( invitation letter , coupon - answer , consent and questionnaires ) were translated into the three most spoken languages : german , portuguese and english .
the translated questionnaires , originally established in french , were independently back - ward translated into french to ensure the validity [ 27 ] .
multi - lingual field - nurses and phone interviewers were employed .
these measures were taken to increase the potential participation of the minorities .
another method of increasing response rate was providing anonymity to the subject , by using only research identification number and code - bar for each participant 's file .
a clear sentence was written over the communicated documents , pointing out the approval of the national ethical committee and the national council for private data protection .
in addition , mutual benefit theory was applied , aiming to maximize the participation , by supplying the participants with their biological results complemented by the cardiologist notes .
in case of abnormal findings , they were advised to consult their family doctor .
complementary information the general inspectorate of social security ( igss ) of luxembourg manages the national health insurance registry , also called the " medical administrative database " , from which the oriscav - lux sample of 4496 subjects was selected .
interestingly , besides information about the name , gender , age group , nationality , professional status and address of every resident in luxembourg , the register contains hospital discharge and medications consumption data .
therefore , complementary anonymous information from the " medical administrative database " was obtained by means of subsequent official request to the igss for both participants ( 1432 subjects ) and non - participants ( 3018 subjects ) .
the requested data concerned cardiovascular health - related conditions , such as medications intake , hospital admissions and medical measures recorded in year 2006 prior to recruitment .
specifically , the requested information comprised ( i ) prescribed medications , including anti - diabetics , anti - thrombotics , cardiac therapy , antihypertensive drugs , diuretics , peripheral vasodilatators , vasoprotective agents , beta - blocking agents , calcium channel blockers , agents acting on the renin - angiotensin system and serum lipid reducing agents ; ( ii ) hospitalizations due to chronic conditions , such as malignant neoplasm of the colon , bronchus , lung , prostate , breast , thyroid ; mental and behavioral disorders due to use of tobacco , alcohol and nutritional disorders , severe mental retardation , hypertensive diseases , ischemic heart disease , cardiac arrest , cardiac failure , cerebro - vascular disease , atherosclerosis , chronic liver cirrhosis , acute and chronic renal failure , and ( iii ) other cardiovascular - related medical measures , such as hemodialysis for renal failure , cardiac pacemaker , thyroid gland scintigraphy , cardiac catheterization and coronary angioplasty .
these data are indicators of morbidity covering a time period of 12 months prior to the study launch .
information concerning the distribution of the resident population of luxembourg was available freely from the national statistics and economic studies service ( statec ) .
ethical aspects as long as the additional requested data were anonymous , the participant 's consent was not necessary to make the link between data collected through the oriscav - lux survey and the medical administrative database .
statistical methods all statistical analyses were carried out using the sas 9.2 (( c ) sas institute inc. , cary , nc , usa ) .
results were presented as numbers and percentages .
to study the oriscav - lux sample representativeness , the sample distributions were compared to the source population distributions according to the stratification criteria ( sex , age and district of residence ) by classical chi - squared tests .
to test whether demographics characteristics and health status affected the participation rate , participants and non - participants were compared by univariate logistic regression analysis .
the dependent variable was the participation to the oriscav - lux study while the independent variables were , respectively , prescribed medication , hospitalization ( yes or no ) , cardiovascular health - related medical measures ( yes or no ) , nationality and professional status .
associations were expressed as odds ratios ( or ) together with their 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) .
age - adjusted ors were also computed by logistic regression analysis to account for the effect of age .
all tests were two - sided , with a p - value of 0.05 or less considered statistically significant .
results recruitment process the oriscav - lux subjects' recruitment process is depicted in figure 1 .
among the 4496 subjects constituting the random stratified sample drawn from the luxembourg population , 12 were institutionalised and therefore excluded ( primary exclusion before sending the invitation letter ) .
after invitation , other 32 cases , including pregnant women ( n = 21 ) , severe mentally ill individuals ( n = 5 ) , one prisoner and 5 deceased subjects were also excluded before recruitment ( secondary exclusion ) .
thus , a total of 4452 subjects were potentially eligible to take part in the study .
figure 1 the oriscav - lux subject 's recruitment flowchart .
primary exclusion before invitation includes 12 addresses of institutionalized subjects .
secondary exclusion after sending the invitation letter includes 32 subjects ( pregnant women , mentally ill and deceased cases ) .
tertiary exclusion from the database after recruitment (> 69 years old ) .
nearly 5 % ( 213 subjects ) were no longer residing at their home address , identified by the post office as " return to sender " , were classified as invalid addresses .
further , 502 subjects ( 11.3 %) absolutely refused to participate and were labeled as negative answers ; 1545 ( 34.7 %) subjects replied positively and were classified as positive answers ; the 2192 ( 49.2 %) individuals who never returned the response - coupon despite 3 invitation letters were considered as " non - respondents " .
among initially positive answers , 80 persons refused to continue , were listed as " withdrawal cases " , in addition to 31 subjects could n't come to repeated appointments because of unavailability .
the " invalid addresses " , " negative answers " , " non - respondents " , " withdrawal cases " and those how could n't participate were grouped in a single category called " non - participation " , constituting 67.8 % of the eligible sample .
finally , a total of 1434 ( 32.2 %) was successfully recruited , hence achieving the prior calculated sample size and the expected response rate .
two participants reached 70 years of age at the time of recruitment were excluded later from the analysis ( tertiary exclusion ) .
table 1 shows the impact of response - enhancement measures on participation rate .
the two postal reminders and the repeated phone contacts enabled further recruitment of 323 ( 7.3 %) and 37 subjects ( 0.8 %) , respectively .
thus the participation rate was increased from 24 % ( 1072 / 4452 ) , then to 31.3 % ( 1395 / 4452 ) and finally up to 32.2 ( 1432 / 4452 ) until the end of the study .

for those who did , the reasons were : lack of time to participate ( 33 cases ) , prolonged absence in particular for university students abroad ( 44 cases ) , permanent medical control ( 23 cases ) , personal reasons ( 5 cases ) and absence of interest in the topic ( 3 cases ) .
sample representativeness to assess the representativeness , the recruited sample ( 1432 participants ) was compared to the source population ( 298,521 individuals ) according to the stratification criteria : gender , age category and district of residence .
as seen in table 2 , the oriscav - lux sample was representative of the population for gender and district of residence , but not for age categories .
this age difference was significant for both men ( p = 0.0004 ) and women ( p = 0.0003 ) .
compared to the source population , the younger age group of 18 - 29 years was under - represented , whereas adults and elderly were over - represented in the sample .

the distribution between participants and non - participants was comparable in terms of the cardiovascular morbidity indicators , including prescribed medications , hospital admission and medical measures ( table 3 ) .
globally , the clinical profile was not dissimilar to that of participants .
concerning prescribed medications , the or was 1.4 ( 95 % ci : 1.13 - 1.73 ) for serum lipid reducing agents medication , showing a significant difference between participants and non - participants ( 10.7 % versus 7.89 % , p = 0.002 ) , but this association disappeared after age adjustment ( p = 0.12 ) .
all prescribed medications in participants were generally similar to those in non participants after age adjustment , except for calcium channel blockers ( p = 0.04 ) and for anti - diabetic medications ( p = 0.049 ) .
the odds ratios for hospital admission ( or = 0.54 , 95 % ci : 0.26 - 1.13 ) and for cardiovascular health - related medical measures ( or = 1.16 , 95 % ci : 0.69 - 1.93 ) did not reveal any significant association with participation , even after age - adjustment , although it was borderline for hospital admission ( p = 0.05 ) .

the referent category is participation in the oriscav - lux study for dependent variable .
the referent category is prescribed medication , hospitalization and medical measures for the independent variables .
the recruited sample was representative of the source population with respect to nationality ( p = 0.40 ) ( data not shown ) .
however , as seen in table 3 , the participation was significantly associated with the nationality ( p < 0.0001 ) .
the participation rate was lower in portuguese residents as compared to luxembourgish ( or = 0.58 , 95 % ci , 0.48 - 0.69 ) .
similarly , the participation was significantly associated with the professional status ( p < 0.0001 ) .
there were 1.12 % farmers , 31.56 % employees , 10.82 % state employees , 2.37 % independent intellectual workers , 21.51 % from working class among participants against 0.7 % , 26.24 % , 7.12 % , 1.76 % and 28.79 % , respectively , among non - participants .
all ors were statistically significant , except for the " independent intellectual " category .
after age - adjustment , the or for " farmer " category was no longer significant .
overall , only subjects from the " working class " category were less receptive to the study as compared to the other professional categories .
discussion as non - participation can affect the validity of epidemiological studies , assessment of non - respondents characteristics is important in the critical appraisal of health research .
for the same reason , the application of effective strategies to increase response could improve the quality of health surveys and may reduce selection bias .
the key objectives of this paper were to analyze the sample representativeness , and to test the null hypothesis that response rate is not influenced by known demographic or health - related characteristics .
in addition , it purposed to assess the impact of pro - active measures to increase participation to the national oriscav - lux survey .
in spite of all the forethought and persistence efforts , there are almost always some uncooperative individuals who fail to respond [ 5 ] .
the two postal reminders enabled further recruitment of 323 subjects , leading to 7.3 % increase in response rate .
further , 37 subjects accepted to participate following repeated phone contacts , hence raising the participation rate from 24 % up to 32.2 % at the end of the study .
whatever the cause , non - respondents may not be a random subgroup and the respondents may not be representative of the parent population .
a recent systematic review [ 28 ] has examined ways to enhance the response rate , including personalized letters of invitation originating from universities or public authorities , careful layout and user - friendly questionnaires , stamped return envelopes , follow up contacts .
indeed , in the oriscav - lux survey , almost all these measures were applied .
likewise , from our experience , we could suggest that multilingual personnel and documents translations , particularly the questionnaire , to another non - official language ( s ) , augmented considerably the participation of those who prefer answering in their mother language .
moreover , sending by posted mail the cardiologist 's feedback regarding clinical and biological results proved to be attractive to the participants .
interestingly , asking the sampled subjects to mention otherwise the reason of refusal was helpful as a prior exploration of non - participation .
though the majority of those who refused ( negative answers ) did not indicate the cause , several reasons were nonetheless expressed by the subjects , such as : lack of time to participate , prolonged absence of young 18 - 29 years adults doing their university studies abroad , which was confirmed by the under - participation level in this age group .
the recent research developments in the field of population surveys in such small country made the population more solicited and hence keen to participate only to interesting topics .
individuals under permanent medical control seemed to be less disposed and less convinced by the necessity to participate to such surveys .
other personal reasons and absence of interest to the topic were also pointed out .
the main goal of obtaining higher response rates in epidemiological studies is to increase the likelihood of sample representativeness and to decrease " selection bias " [ 26,29 ] , also denoted " non - response bias " in the text .
the sample representativeness analysis have shown that there was no significant difference of the recruited oriscav - lux sample by gender and district of residence as compared with the source population , but the study sample contained a slightly higher proportion of older population and less young adults .
this finding was expected as most of the young adults were not available due to their prolonged absence for studying abroad .
in addition , the cardiovascular focus of the oriscav - lux study might not be a priority for young age groups who usually enjoy a good health .
conversely , the over - representativeness of the older people might be reasonably due to their perception for the need to clinical check - up , especially when counseling by a cardiologist was provided freely .
therefore , in the oriscav - lux survey , the potential consequence of age - related non - response bias was handled by adjusting the sample for age , by using the most recent available distribution of the luxembourg 's population ( statec database ) .
according to the research questions , future analyses will be performed after sample weighting to take into account the complex sampling design .
empirically , a low response rate does not necessarily result in a biased sample or , conversely , a high response rate may yield a biased sample [ 6,30 ] .
in practice , an " acceptable " or " tolerable " level of non - participation cannot be generalized , because it depends on the study nature , population characteristics and the event under investigation [ 5 ] .
although in certain studies a small amount of bias may distort the results , the extent of bias should not necessarily be proportional to the non - response rate [ 5,6 ] .
in order to address this issue properly , it is necessary to obtain information about the characteristics of non - participants [ 31 ] .
the literature provides insights regarding the characteristics associated with lower participation , including younger [ 32 ] or older age [ 33,34 ] , female sex [ 33,34 ] , lower socio - economic status [ 4,35 ] , lower occupational status [ 36 ] , non - western origin [ 37 ] , comorbidity [ 38,39 ] , and less favorable lifestyle [ 40,41 ] .
these findings vary markedly according to the setting , study topic , method and number of contacts , characteristics of the target population and the available data for participants - non participants profile comparison .
it was reported that those who participate in clinical trials and respond to public health surveys are generally healthier and at less risk than those who refuse participation , also called the " healthy participant effect "[ 1,8,38,42 - 44 ] , though an example of opposite findings was noticed [ 45 ] .
to this end , it was important to investigate the morbidity profile of non - participants in the oriscav - lux population .
globally , the morbidity profile - related difference between the participants and non - participants was not significant .
though the participants under lipid - reducing agents were proportionally more numerous than the non - participants , this divergence ( dissimilarities of the fractions of the exposed and non - exposed )[ 35 ] disappeared after age adjustment .
our results suggest that non - participation in the oriscav - lux survey was not related to the morbidity profile .
compared to non - participants , participants tended to be older people of luxembourgish nationality , working as employees or state employees .
across the literature , age seems to have a varying effect [ 46 ] ; participation either increased with age [ 37,47,48 ] or , in the contrary , was higher among the young groups [ 19,49 ] .
the age difference was probably related to different awareness of the cardiovascular disease problems between young and old people .
such aspects appear to be less attractive to younger age group .
in addition , luxembourg is a small country with limited local higher education possibilities ; most young adults of 18 - 29 years were not available during the study period .
our intensive efforts to fix appointments during the holiday periods increased moderately their participation , but could not surmount their under - representativeness in the sample .
job grade showed that the probability of participation among state employees was 2.03 times higher than that of those coming from working - classes and 1.94 times after age - adjustment .
this finding is close to that observed in most other similar studies in france [ 46 ] , great britain [ 5,50,51 ] and united states [ 52 ] .
the difficulty to get temporary free leave from work may hence limit the attendance of working - class group .
strengths and limitations the present comparative study has major strong points .
first , we analyzed non - participation not only according to traditional demographic background but also according to cardiovascular health characteristics .
second , the comparison study was based on reliable data obtained by means of a request to official authorities , without the need of prior research authorization or subject 's consent .
third , the national health insurance authorities keep a reasonably complete " medical administrative database " of the general resident population of the country .
for health care reimbursement purposes , this database is subject to regular updates , which was confirmed by the relatively low number of invalid addresses .
this enabled us to select a national representative sample and to obtain further information on the main cardiovascular health - related conditions .
in view of high cost and low or even possibly decreasing participation rates in population surveys , data collected from ongoing routine databanks may represent a good alternative option for health monitoring in the future .
in oriscav - lux , it was not possible to apply a short version of the original self - reported health behaviors questionnaire as an alternative approach to obtain information about the salient outcome indicators ( smoking , alcohol consumption , dietary habits and physical activity ) .
for the reason that , after all enhanced efforts to contact and recruit the non - respondents and reluctant cases , it was irrational to re - contact them for an otherwise shorter questionnaire .
according to the best of our knowledge , no previous cardiovascular population - based study has reported a similar methodology , based on survey data and national " medical administrative database " .
the igss data could not supply information about some relevant socioeconomic features , such as the education level , income and marital status , which can be seen as a limitation .
such information would allow investigating the impact of socio - economic differences and its potential bias on the non - participation rate [ 35 ] .
therefore , in future analyses , this issue should be interpreted prudently .
conclusion in conclusion , the present article provides an insight regarding the strategies applied to increase response rate , sample representativeness and the characteristics of non participants .
the 32.2 % participation rate obtained represents the realistic achievable for this type of survey , corresponding to the expected rate , upon which the sample size was calculated .
the potential non - response bias of the oriscav - lux data was determined by the degree of similarities between the characteristics of participants and non - participants .
given the absence of divergent cardiovascular health - related profiles , we concluded that the response rate did not invalidate our data and allows generalizing the results for the population .
collectively , these results suggest that pro - active strategies to increase response rate in health surveys may yield unbiased estimates of entire population characteristics .

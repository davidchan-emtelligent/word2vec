further development in thyroid surgery is directed towards limitations of postoperative complication rates .
the specific complications after thyroid surgery are hypoparathyroidism and recurrent laryngeal nerve ( rln ) palsy ( uni - or bilateral ) .
the former , although mostly transient in character , has a frequency reaching up to 60 % in cases of total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection because of thyroid cancer .
at present , only meticulous preparation by experienced surgeons , together with pth and calcium concentration monitoring , may be helpful in prevention and early diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism .
subsequent substitutive therapy with calcium and vitamin d metabolites should prevent hypocalcaemia .
recent two decades was the time of intensive development of intraoperative neuromonitoring ( ionm ) of laryngeal nerves .
nowadays this technique , although still developing , has a stable place in thyroid surgery .
intraoperative neuromonitoring - at its present form - cannot prevent laryngeal nerve palsy , nevertheless together with stage thyroidectomy and careful preparation allows to avoid the most serious complication in thyroid surgery - bilateral rln palsy .
recently developed continuous intraoperative neurmonitoring of vagal nerve is a promising tool and probably the next step in modern prevention of rln palsy .
efforts in further development and standardization of the technique will hopefully result in the technique of ionm , allowing not only to intraoperatively diagnose but also to prevent rln palsy .
further efforts are needed in limiting the invasiveness of the procedure .

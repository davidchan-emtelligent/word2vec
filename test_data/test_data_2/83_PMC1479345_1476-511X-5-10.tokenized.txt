introduction herein , we expand our previous work on the effects of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids ( lc - pufa ) on the murine hepatic transcriptome using novel statistical and bioinformatic approaches for evaluating microarray data .
the analyses focuses on key differences in the transcriptomic response that will influence metabolism following consumption of fung ( rich in 20:4n6 ) , fish ( rich in 20:5n3 , 22:5n3 , and 22:6n3 ) and comb , the combination of the two .
results using a variance - stabilized f - statistic , 371 probe sets ( out of 13 k probe sets in the affymetrix mu11k chip set ) were changed by dietary treatment ( p < 0.001 ) .
relative to other groups , comb had unique affects on murine hepatic transcripts involved in cytoskeletal and carbohydrate metabolism ; whereas fung affected amino acid metabolism via ctnb1 signaling .
all three diets affected transcripts linked to apoptosis and cell proliferation , with evidence fish may have increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation via various transcription factors , kinases , and phosphatases .
the three diets affected lipid transport , lipoprotein metabolism , and bile acid metabolism through diverse pathways .
relative to other groups , fish activated cyps that form hydroxylated fatty acids known to affect vascular tone and ion channel activity .
fa synthesis and delta 9 desaturation were down regulated by comb relative to other groups , implying that a fa mixture of 20:4n6 , 20:5n3 , and 22:6n3 is most effective at down regulating synthesis , via ins1 , srebp , ppar alpha , and tnf signaling .
heme synthesis and the utilization of heme for hemoglobin production were likely affected by fung and fish .
finally , relative to other groups , fish increased numerous transcripts linked to combating oxidative such as peroxidases , an aldehyde dehydrogenase , and heat shock proteins , consistent with the major lc - pufa in fish ( 20:5n3 , 22:5n3 , 22:6n3 ) being more oxidizable than the major fatty acids in fung ( 20:4n6 ) .
conclusion distinct transcriptomic , signaling cascades , and predicted affects on murine liver metabolism have been elucidated for 20:4n6 - rich dietary oils , 22:6n3 - rich oils , and a surprisingly distinct set of genes were affected by the combination of the two .
our results emphasize that the balance of dietary n6 and n3 lc - pufa provided for infants and in nutritional and neutraceutical applications could have profoundly different affects on metabolism and cell signaling , beyond that previously recognized .
background microarrays and related technologies such as rt - pcr have accelerated our ability to understand the effects of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids ( lc - pufa ) and their derivatives on the transcriptome , implied metabolome , and lipid signaling cascades in various species and tissues [ 1,2 ] .
transcription factors indicated thus far include peroxisome proliferator activated receptors ( ppars ) , hepatic nuclear - 4alpha ( hnf - 4alpha ) , nuclear factor kappabeta ( nf - kappabeta ) , retinoid x receptor alpha ( rxralpha ) , sterol regulatory element binding protein - 1c ( srebp - 1c ) , and liver x receptors ( lxr ) [ 1,3 ] .
several studies have examined effects of lc - pufa on the focused and global transcriptome [ 4 ] , with some examining the effects of n6 / n3 lc - pufa ratios using precursors of 20:4n6 ( such as 18:2n6 ) , and precursors of 22:6n3 ( such as 18:3n3 ) or 22:6n3 itself [ 5 - 9 ] .
we are not aware of works comparing arachidonic acid ( aa ) , eicosapentaenoic ( epa )/ docosahexaenoic acids ( dha ) , and the combination of aa and epa / dha in liver and other tissues of mice nor other organisms .
in the present study and previous works , we fed mice diets enriched with fungal oil enriched in aa ( fung ) , fish oil ( fish ) , or a combination of the two ( comb ) .
in our first study , we examined the microarray transcriptional profile in liver and hippocampus , focusing on genes affecting lipid metabolism via known transcriptional signatures ( ppars , srebps , etc. ) , and provided supporting lipidomic data [ 1 ] .
we documented and refined our statistical approaches used to select differentially regulated genes [ 10,11 ] .
thereafter , we focused in hepatic and hippocampal genes implicated in : behavior [ 12 ] ; cancer etiology [ 13,14 ] ; and obesity [ 15 ] .
lastly , we examined changes to all differentially regulated genes in liver [ 16 ] and hippocampus [ 17 ] .
these works have been described in reviews [ 3,18 - 21 ] .
what is still lacking is a more comprehensive evaluation of how n6 and n3 lc - pufa differentially affect the murine hepatic transcriptome and how such events might translate to affects on metabolism [ 4 ] .
to address this challenge , we re - evaluated our original microarray data [ 1 ] using new statistical approaches , pathway mapping , and updated literature .
results and discussion comparison of diets on a genomic scale in mouse liver , there were 371 probe sets varying between diets using an f - statistic ( p < 0.001 ; genesight ( tm ) software ( biodiscovery , inc. ) .
sets were evaluated by principal component analysis ( pca ) analysis ( fig. 1 ) and retained 63 % of the variance of the original data .
figure 1 principle component analysis scatter plot showing the five arrays used , represented by 371 most highly differentiated probe sets .
spatially closest arrays have the most similar genomic profiles .
super imposed are numbers of probes sets significantly different at p < 0.001 in six pair wise comparisons .
probes differing between arrays would not necessarily be the same in each comparison .

the number of significantly different genes between pairs of diets ( f - statistic ; p < 0.001 ) is superimposed on the pca plot ( fig 1 ) .
the two replicate control ( cont ) groups were very similar based on pca , as expected .
numbers of pair wise probes differing between cont and - fung , - fish , and - comb were 160 , 204 , and 208 , respectively ( p < 0.001 ; fig. 1 ) , indicating cont and fung were most similar to one another .
numbers of probes differing between fung - fish , fung - comb , and fish - comb were 127 , 127 , and 153 , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) .
at p < 0.001 , only 13 genes ( 0.001 x 13,000 ) are expected to appear by chance .
using set intersection analysis on probes from pair wise comparisons , 20 - , 27 - and 44 probes differentiated fung , fish and comb from one another , respectively ; most being down regulated ( table 1 ) .
63349 _ s in fung - comb , and c78039 in fung - fish overlapped between sets .

the smallest set of probes ( a subset of probes described in fig. 1 ) differentiating each group ( fung , fish , comb ) from all others at p < 0.001 was determined with set intersection analysis .
there is one row for each set of differentiating probes .
columns show numbers of genes in the list , up (+) and down ( - ) regulated .
almost all differentiating genes were down - regulated in pair wise comparisons .

fish was more similar to cont than fung or comb , which clustered together .
however , cross bar height shows fish is not profoundly closer to cont , than fung or comb .

pathway analysis pathway analysis ( figs. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ) was performed on selected transcripts differentiating the groups ( table 3 ; described in next section ) .
it is not always possible from transcript data alone to correctly predict whether a pathway will be up or down regulated since post translational and dimerization events , and promoter / enhancer sequences ultimately affect dna binding activation / signal transduction .
the various diets provided different ratios of n6 / n3 lc - pufa .
thus , the dietary groups affected similar global signaling pathways ; but differentially affected down stream signaling cascades and the magnitude / direction of change to specific transcripts .
generalized descriptions of the signaling cascades are provided below ; detailed descriptions of specific transcripts are included in the subsequent section , " comparison of diets on an individual gene level. " unreferenced literature emanates from ingenuity software directly .

comb decreased dbi ( diazepam binding inhibitor ) ( via myc ) and decreased tcf2 ( transcription factor 2 ) ( via myc targets pcaf and crebp ) .
comparison of diets on an individual gene level herein , we focus on genes implicated in pathway analysis ( figs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ) and linkable to specific functions ( tables 2 , 3 ) .
for brevity , signaling cascades cannot be described in their entirety .
in table 2 , pathways are selected based on enrichment analysis .
table 3 includes genes that are individually most differentially regulated between diets .
up and down regulation are always relative to the other two groups even if not explicitly stated for brevity ( e.g. , down regulation by fung indicates down regulation by fung relative to fish and comb ) .
unreferenced literature emanates directly from ingenuity - or affymetrix netaffx programs .
for readability , gene and protein abbreviations are followed by full names in brackets .
table 2 genes differentiating fung , fish , and comb , using gene ontology classifications and enrichment analysis .
genes differentiating fung , fish , and comb , using gene ontology ( go ) classifications and enrichment analysis .
differentially regulated genes ( gea model ) were subjected to enrichment analysis to select go terms " enriched with " these genes .
two broad go categories included are " biological process " and " molecular function " .
specific go terms are included and specific genes within each gene term differentiating the diets are parenthesized , alphabetized , and separated by commas .
rows are sorted for consistency with table 3 where possible .
differentiating genes were selected at p < 0.001 , and go terms computed at p < 0.01 ; p is the probability a random gene for each go term will have as many genes with the same go term as the actual list .
the biological process category " metabolism " was excluded as it was too general .
genes in tables 2 - 3 are not identical because of the different statistical approaches utilized .
enrichment analysis placed acadm ( acetyl - coenzyme a dehydrogenase , medium chain ( mcad ) in both the fa oxidation and electron transport categories ; it was removed from the latter .

its activity is controlled by d - cyclins and cdk inhibitor p16 ( ink4a ) .
cdk4 also phosphorylates rb ( retinoblastoma ) protein which affects cell cycle progression .
fish down regulated cdk4 ( cyclin - dependent kinase 4 ) , which could inhibit cell cycle progression .
ppp1ca / ppp2c - beta ( protein phosphatases 1ca and - 2b ) are serine / threonine phosphatases with myosin phosphatase activity ; and roles in glycogen metabolism , rna processing , and cell cycle regulation .
fish increased ppp1ca and ppp2cb which could affect cell proliferation .
camk2b ( calcium / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase iibeta , cam - kii , ckii ) is required for cell division via ins1 signaling ( fig. 6 ) .
specifically , ckii phosphorylates sag ( sensitive to apoptosis gene ) , leading to degradation of ikappabalpha and p27kip1 , and cell proliferation via g1 / s phase transition [ 32 ] .
sag also inhibits lipid oxidant - induced apoptosis by inhibiting metal ion - induced release of cytochrome c and activating caspase .
camk2b was down regulated with fish ( and possibly its oxidation products acting on sag ) , which may induce apoptosis / inhibit cell proliferation .
ckii can also phosphorylate numb / numbl proteins in vitro ; and in vivo , cam - ki phosphorylates numbl in rat liver .
numbl was down regulated by fung ( increased by fish ) via ins1 - app signaling ( fig. 6 ) .
the cam - kii - numbl kinase cascade may affect axonal growth .
numbl also interacts with additional binding proteins in liver ( e.g. , 14 - 3 - 3 proteins ) , thus new functions for numbl are being discovered [ 33 ] .
ckii may also affect fa beta - oxidation by altering cpt - 1 ( carnitine paltmitoyl transferase ) phosphorylation [ 34 ] .
dusps ( dual specificity phosphatases or mitogen - activated protein kinase phosphatase , mkps ) negatively regulate mapk / erk - , sapk / jnk - , and p38 - mitogen activated protein kinase - induced cellular proliferation [ 35 ] .
dusps 1 and - 9 were down regulated by comb , which could increase proliferation [ 36 ] .
ptpra ( protein tyrosine phosphatase , receptor type , a ) de - phosphorylates and activates src family tyrosine kinases , and may regulate integrin signaling , cell adhesion and proliferation .
ptpra was down regulated by comb ( increased with fish ) which could affect cell proliferation .
plk1 ( polo - like kinase homolog ) acts through ctnb1 signaling ( fig. 5 ) to influence g2 / m dna damage check point regulation and induce mitotic entry of cells .
ntrk1 ( neurotrophic tyrosine kinase , receptor , type 1 ) acts through ins1 / hras signaling ( fig. 6 ) to affect the cell cycle via protein tyrosine kinase signaling .
plk1 and ntrk1 were decreased by comb .
plk is known to be increased in response to g1 / s activation in mouse liver ( induced by partial partial hepatectomy ) , hence a decrease in plk1could decrease cell progression [ 23 ] .
transcription factors fish oil may decrease map kinase activity ( p38 , p44 / 42 , jnk / sapk ) leading to decreased ap - 1 ( activator protein 1 ) binding activity , down regulated il - 6 - and tnf signaling , and decreased mitosis [ 22,37,38 ] .
jund1 was down regulated by fish , which could inhibit cell cycle progression .
usf - 2 ( upstream stimulating factor 2 ) is an e - box binding factor which activates many of the same genes activated by the basic helix - loop helix ( bhlh ) transcription factor , srebp - 1 .
usf - 2 is post - translationally phosphorylated [ 39 ] and may repress myc - induced proliferation and transformation [ 40,41 ] .
fish down regulated usf2 ( confirmed with real time - polymerase chain reaction , rt - pcr ) [ 1 ] , which could inhibit proliferation .
usf - 2 also binds fasn ( fatty acid synthase ) e - box [ 42 ] .
using a different gene selection model , fish down regulated nfy ( nuclear factor y ) .
nf - y binds y - box motifs in fa synthase [ 1 ] ( and inverted ccaat / attgg motifs in peroxisomal beta - oxidation transcripts ) [ 43 ] .
taken together , fish may down regulate fasn and decrease fa synthesis , via srebp / sre , usf - 2 / e - box , and nfy / y - box interactions .
nfkbia ( nuclear factor of kappa light chain gene enhancer in b - cells inhibitor , alpha ) inhibits apoptosis by inhibiting apoptosis activator nfkb1 ( nuclear factor of kappa light chain gene enhancer in b - cells 1 , p105 ) .
fish down regulated nfkbia which could activate apoptosis .
hnf3gamma is implicated in obesity , hyperlipidemia , and diabetes .
it regulates glucagon transcription , insulin resistance , and pancreaticgamma cell function [ 44 ] .
oxidative stress activates the related transcription factor foxo3a , which in turn activates sterol carrier protein 2 ( scp2 ) , protecting fa from further oxidation [ 45 ] ; however , hnf3gamma regulation is not known .
comb down regulated hnf3gamma and the gluconeogenic transcript g6pc ( glucose - 6 - phosphatase , catalytic ( g6pase ) , which could affect the balance between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis .
activating transcription factors ( atf ) are basic region - leucine zipper ( bzip ) proteins [ 46 ] .
atf5 can repress human camp - induced gene transcription [ 47 ] and may inhibit apoptosis and promote g1 / s transitions [ 23 ] .
comb decreased atf5 would could increase apoptosis and inhibit g1 / s progression .
using a different gene selection model [ 1 ] , comb decreased the related factor , atf4 [ 48 ] .
amino acid metabolism enrichment analysis indicated fung differed from other groups via changes to transcripts involved in amino acid metabolism and having transaminase function ( table 2 ) .
ornithine - delta - aminotransferase ( oat ) has role in arginine / proline metabolism , and the urea cycle , acting through ctnb1 ( fig. 5 ) .
oat converts l - ornithine to 2 - ketoglutarate [ 49 ] .
fung increased oat which could reduce ornithine for polyamine ( putrescine , spermidine , and spermine ) synthesis via ornithine decarboxylase , having subsequent affects on cell proliferation .
dct ( dopachrome tautomerase ) and sf3a1 / sf3a2 ( splicing factors 3a ) also act through ctnb1 ( fig. 5 ) and affect tyrosine metabolism .
fung decreased dct and increased sf3a 2 .
eprs ( glutamyl - prolyl - trna synthetase ) has roles in glutamate metabolism , and also death receptor signaling , cell cycle g1 / s check point regulation , and leukotriene ltc4 synthesis .
eprs was down regulated by comb via tgfb1 signaling ( fig. 4 ) , which would affect amino acid metabolism and cell cycle regulation .
tpsab1 ( mast cell protease 7 ) has roles in proteolysis and wnt / beta catenin signaling .
tbsab1 was also down regulated by comb via tgfb1 ( fig. 4 ) .
fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism as previously reported , lc - pufa studied in our microarray experiments [ 1 ] likely increased fa beta - oxidation via pparalpha [ 50 ] ; decreased fa synthesis via down regulation of srebp and its signaling cofactors [ 51 ] ; and increased glucose synthesis via pck1 ( phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 ) .
in starvation experiments in mice , similar sets of transcripts were altered in the liver : apoa4 , cyp4a14 , and ech1 were increased ; and scd1 , fasn , and fabp5 were decreased [ 52 ] .
in response to g1 / s activation in mouse liver ( induced by partial partial hepatectomy ) [ 23 ] , apoa4 , cyp4a14 , and ech1 were increased ; and fasn , thrsp , and fabp5 were decreased [ 52 ] .
lc - pufa feeding thus mimicked the fasted metabolic state , and a state in which normally quiescent hepatocytes are dividing [ 53 ] .
all groups up regulated mitochrondrial and peroxisomal fa beta - oxidation transcripts ( tables 2 , 3 ) [ 1 ] , but no obvious trends concerning up or down regulation of beta - oxidation emerged between groups in the present re - investigation .
interestingly , comb ( providing a mixture of fatty acids in fung and fish ) differed most from the other groups with respect to transcripts involved in fa synthesis ( table 2 ) .
comb down regulated : acetyl coa biosynthesis via acas2 ( acetyl - coenzyme a synthetase 2 ) ; fa biosynthesis via thrsp ( spot14 ) ; entry of accoa into the cytoplasm for fa synthesis via acly ( atp citrate lyase ) ; and fa synthesis via fasn .
fasn was down regulated more with fung than fish .
comb also down regulated scd1 ( stearoyl - coenzyme a desaturase 1 ) which could result in less monounsaturated fa being stored in triacylglycerol , cholesterol ester , and phospholipids ( pl ) pools , and potentially decreased obesity [ 54 ] .
our pl lipidomic data were consistent with the changes in scd [ 1,15 ] .
fish increased fa elongation via up regulation of elovl3 ( a long - chain fatty acyl elongase ) ; this elongase may be srebp1a - regulated [ 1,55 ] .
lypla2 ( lysophospholipase 3 ) hydrolyzes mitogenic lysopl such as lysophosphatidylcholine [ 56 ] .
fish down regulated lypla2 , which could increase pla2 - induced mitogenicity and affect other cellular processes .
cytochrome p450 metabolism using enrichment analysis ( table 2 ) , fung affected numerous p450 transcripts , including por ( p450 cytochrome oxidoreductase ) , cyp2a4 , - 2b9 , - 3a11 , - 3a16 , - 3a41 , and - 4a10 ( up regulation of 4a10 confirmed with rtpcr ; [ 1 ]) .
cyp4 is activated by pparalpha - rxr .
murine cyp4a - 10 can form omega / omega - 1 hydroxylated 20:4n6 and hydroxylated - epoxylated 20:4n6 [ 57,58 ] .
similar products from 20:5n3 and 22:6n3 have not been reported .
these fa derivatives can affect : ion channel activity ; regulate vascular tone and systemic blood pressures ; and inhibit oxidative stress in mouse liver models [ 58,59 ] .
fish up regulated cyp4a10 ( verified with rt - pcr ) [ 1 ] , and the related cyp 4a14 using a different gene selection model [ 1 ] , which may result in the physiological changes noted above .
calcitriol ( 1,25 ( oh2 ) d3 ; vitamin d ) binds vitamin d receptor ( vdr ) .
vdr - rxr heterodimers then bind vdre ( vitamin d - responsive elements ) in genes in various organs including liver .
activated vdr regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis and inhibits cell growth .
in hepatocytes , via xenobiotic - responsive elements ( er6 , dr3 , and dr4 ) , vdr also induces cyps 3a4 , - 2b6 and 2c9 [ 60 ] .
cyp24 degrades 1,25 ( oh ) 2d3 to 1,24,25 ( oh ) 3d3 , a product with decreased hormonal activity .
cyp24 expression is activated by 1,25 ( oh ) 2d3 , phorbol esters , and jnk ( c - jun n - terminal kinase ) , acting on vdre [ 61 ] ; and pxr ( pregnane x receptor ) agonists [ 62 ] .
fung down regulated cyp24 which could increase 1,25 ( oh ) 2d , and decrease mitogenesis .
fung did not up regulate cyps 2b6 , - 2c9 , and - 3a4 , but up regulated family members , cyp2b9 , - 3a11 and - 3a16 , which are also major drug detoxifying enzymes [ 1 ] .
lipid transport fatp - 1 ( fatty acid transport protein 1 ; slc27a1 ) transports fa across the cell membrane in liver .
thereafter efflux is prevented by coa esterification , via acs ( acyl coa synthase ) [ 63 ] .
slc27a1 and acs are pparalpha regulated [ 63 ] .
slc27a1 was down regulated by fung , likely through pparalpha , and this could lead to less fa transported into the liver for various purposes including triacylglycerol formation. through pparalpha , cd36 is implicated in long chain free fa uptake in adipocytes and liver .
cd36 also affects cell proliferation , angiogenesis , and tumor metastasis [ 64,65 ] ; and is a receptor for thrombospondin , collagen type i , and oxidized ldl on macrophages [ 66 ] .
contrary to work in cancer cells where the fish oil component dha reduced cd36 [ 67 ] , herein , fish up regulated cd36 which could increase uptake of fa into liver , and increase cell proliferation .
apoc1 inhibits lipoprotein lipase dependent triacylglycerol hydrolysis in mice , independent of very - low - density lipoprotein receptor and apociii [ 68 ] .
fung decreased apoc1 , which could lead to a lowering of circulating triacylglycerol .
e - fabp ( fatty acid binding protein 5 , epidermal ) transports fa intracellularly in liver and other organs [ 69 ] .
fabp5 may be pparalpha regulated based on clustering analysis [ 1 ] and the fact that a pparalpha ligand decreased fabp [ 70 ] .
herein , fish decreased fabp5 ( verified with rt - pcr ) [ 1 ] , similarly to that reported in rats [ 70 ] .
fish - induced decrease in fabp5 could alter intracellular lc - pufa transport [ 71 ] .
hepatic uptake of bile acids is mediated by various proteins including slc ( solute carrier family ) members .
slc10a1 was down regulated by fish , which could decrease hepatic uptake of bile acids during bile acid recycling , increasing circulating cholesterol levels [ 72 ] .
slc4a2 was up regulated by fung , which could affect biliary bicarbonate secretion , possibly via hnf signaling - hnf1alpha is regulated by slc4a2 in human cells [ 73 ] .
the related factor , hnf - 3g , was increased by fung relative to comb .
aqp8 ( aquaporin 8 ) facilitates hepatic bile secretion [ 74 ] .
comb down regulated aqp8 ( aquaporin 8 ) possibly through srebp1a [ 55,75 ] .
decreased aqp8 could decrease biliary cholesterol secretion and water secretion into bile [ 55 ] and conceivably increase circulating cholesterol .
comb affected transcripts involved in apolipoprotein metabolism ( apoa4 , apoc2 ) , pl transport ( pltp , phospholipid transfer protein ) , and oxysterol binding ( osbpl5 , oxysterol binding protein - like 5 ) ( table 2 , enrichment analysis ) .
comb down regulated apoa4 and apoa4 precursor ( confirmed with rt - pcr ) [ 1 ] , likely through pparalpha [ 70,76 ] .
changes to apoa4 mediated by comb could affect reverse cholesterol transport from periphery to liver , since apoa4 is an hdl component .
apoe is involved in cholesterol transport and has anti - inflammatory properties [ 77 ] .
the fish - induced increase in apoe could enhance delivery of ldl cholesterol to liver and decrease serum triacylglycerol .
heme synthesis and oxygen transport alas1 and - 2 ( aminolevulinic acid synthases 1 and - 2 ) control the rate limiting steps in heme synthesis ; alad ( aminolevulinate , delta dehydratase ) is the second enzyme in this pathway .
alas1 and alas2 were respectively increased - and decreased with fung , complicating the interpretation of how groups affected heme production .
there was evidence the diets affected heme utilization .
hbb - a1 ( hemoglobin alpha , adult chain 1 ) and hbb - b1 ( hemoglobin , beta adult major chain ) are classes of hemoglobin .
heme is incorporated into not only hemoglobulins for oxygen transport ; but also eicosanoid enzymes ; and lipid peroxidases and heme - binding proteins which reduce damaging lipid peroxides [ 78 ] .
hbb - a1 was increased with fish and hbb - b1 was decreased with comb ( fish > fung ) indicating more heme may be incorporated into hemoglobin with fish relative to fung .
responses to oxidative stress and inflammation fish increased transcripts utilized to combat oxidative stress .
this is expected since key fa in fish having 5 - 6 double bonds vs. 2 - 4 double bonds for the key fa in fung , are more oxidizable [ 79 ] .
peroxidase transcripts increased by fish included gpx1 ( glutathione peroxidase 1 ) , prdx2 , prdx4 ( peroxiredoxins ) , and mpo ( myeloperoxidase ) .
peroxiredoxins are a new family of antioxidant proteins [ 80 ] .
prdx2 is a putative biomarker for progression of metastasis in melanoma cells , emphasizing its importance in controlling oxidative stress [ 81 ] .
mpo is a heme - containing protein with roles in atherosclerosis and alzheimer 's disease [ 82 ] .
additional proteins with roles in oxidative stress were aldh1a7 ( aldehyde dehydrogenases , increased with fish ) , hspcb ( a heat shock protein , decreased with fung ) , hspb1 ( hsp25 / p27 , decreased with fish ) , mif ( macrophage migration inhibitory factor , decreased with fish ) , c5r1 ( complement component 5 , receptor 1 , dramatically decreased with fish ) , cd72 ( cd72 antigen , dramatically decreased with fish ) , cryaa ( crystallin , alpha a , decreased with fish ) , and hpxn ( hemopexin , decreased with comb , fung > fish ) [ 78 ] .
using enrichment analysis ( table 2 ) , additional transcription factors linked to oxidative stress distinguishing fish , included : aldh1a1 , aldh2 ( aldehyde dehydrogenases ) , hspa8 , and hspb8 ( heat shock proteins ) .
globally , fish had the most profound effects , increasing oxidative stress markers .
the increase in aldha7 was expected since more reactive aldehydes , such as 4 - hydroxy - 2 - nonenal , are expected to be formed from reactions between oxygen radicals and the highly oxidizable lc - pufa in fish oil , including dha .
aldehyde dehydrogenases prevent lipid damage by destroying reactive aldehydes , and may be srebp1a regulated [ 55,83 ] .
oxidant stress inducing drugs are known to increase aldh1a1 in rat liver , as well as transcripts for hsp ( see below ) [ 84 ] .
transcripts for aldehyde dehydrogenases , hsp , and cd36 ( all were increased with fish ) are also known to increase with high fat feeding in mouse liver , consistent with the fact that high fat induces an oxidant stress [ 85 ] .
changes to hsps would enable cell survival and recovery in response to oxidative stress and have been previously found to be changed following fish oil consumption [ 86 ] .
hsps also have roles in cytoskeletal actin dynamics in response to stress [ 87 ] and may account for changes to some cytoskeletal transcripts observed herein .
hspb1 encodes hsp25 and hsp27 [ 88 ] .
lc - pufa may affect transcription as well as post - translational phosphorylation of hsps via erk , pkcdelta , tgfbeta , p38 , and mk2 .
mk2 ( map kinase 2 ; also known as mapkapk2 or mitogen activated protein kinase - activated protein kinase 2 ) is activated by erk .
these signaling cascades are partly shown in figs. 3 - 4 .
hsps in turn activate transcription of antioxidant defense genes such as sod2 ( mn superoxide dismutase ) .
this in turn activates expression of inflammatory factors including tnfalpha ( tumor necrosis factor alpha ) , il1beta ( interleukin 1 beta ) , and nfkappabeta ( nuclear factor kappa beta ) [ 89 ] .
changes to these transcripts up - and down stream of hsps were not found but the upstream activator of hsps , jund , was decreased with fish ( fig. 3 ) .
lc - pufa , particularly from fish oil , affect neutrophil and macrophage functioning .
down regulation of mif ( macrophage migration inhibitory factor ) by fish could increase hypersensitivity [ 90 ] , opposite that expected for fish oil which typically down regulates immune responses .
c5r1 ( complement factor 5a receptor ) promotes local inflammation and is a potent chemo - attractant for neutrophils and macrophages [ 91 ] .
its down regulation by fish would decrease some inflammatory responses .
cd72 prevents differentiation of naive b cells into plasma cells , blocking production of low - affinity antibodies .
it also activates map kinase and bcr ( b cell antigen receptor ) - mediated calcium influx .
down regulation of cd72 with fish may promote apoptosis / inhibit proliferation of b cells [ 92 ] .

fung had the most profound affects on amino acid metabolism affecting tyrosine ( dct , sf3a2 ) and ornithine ( oat ) metabolism , via ctnb1 signaling .
heme synthesis was likely altered via fung ( alas1 increased , alas2 decreased ; via ins1 - stat3 signaling ) .
hemoglobin synthesis may have been increased with fish relative to fung ( hba - a1 , hbb - b1 ) .
carbohydrate metabolism was most profoundly affected by comb via decreases to foxa3 ( ins1 signaling ) , bat2 ( ctnb1 signaling ) , hnf3g , and g6pc .
lipid metabolism and transport all three diets increased numerous transcripts involved in fa beta - oxidation ( acadm , aldh1a1 , aldh1a7 , aldh2 , crat , cpt1a , cpt2 , and ech1 ) and activated by pparalpha .
fa synthesis ( acly thrsp , fasn ) and desaturation ( scd ) were down regulated by comb relative to other groups , implying that a fa mixture of aa , epa , and dha is most effective at down regulating synthesis through ins1 , srebp , pparalpha , and tnf signaling .
fish up regulated elongation of fa via elovl2 / 3 .
lipid transport was also altered by the dietary groups .
fung decreased slc27a1 which could decrease transport of fa into the liver ; whereas fish increased cd36 ( via pparalpha signaling ) , which could increase transport of fa into the liver .
fish decreased fabp5 which could affect intracellular fat transport ( via tgfbeta - pparalpha signaling ) ; and increased abce1 ( via fabp - snca signaling ) .
understanding changes to apolipoprotein transcripts is complicated since mice and humans metabolize cholesterol and triacylglycerol differently ( e.g. , mice carry most of their cholesterol in hdl particles ) and apolipoprotein polymorphisms have large impacts on cholesterol metabolism .
fung decreased apoc1 ( via ins1 signaling ) which could lead to reduced circulating triacylglycerol .
fish increased apoe which could enhance delivery of cholesterol and triacylglycerol to liver , decreasing serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol .
comb decreased apoa4 ( via pparalpha signaling ) , which could affect transport of cholesterol to the liver .
bile acid metabolism was affected by all three diets .
relative to fung , fish may have decreased biliary bicarbonate secretion ( slc4a2 ) and bile acid uptake by hepatocytes ( slc10a1 ) ; whereas , comb may have decreased biliary cholesterol secretion ( aqp8 ) .
relative to other groups , fish activated cyps 4a10 and - 14 ( via pparalpha signaling ) , which hydroxylate aa and possibly dha , forming products which affect vascular tone and ion channel activity .
cell proliferation and apoptosis interpreting changes to transcripts implicated in cell proliferation is particularly complicated since transcribed proteins are ultimately regulated by pos - translational modifications and protein - protein interactions .
fish may have decreased cell proliferation via decreased tcea2 ( myc - pol2ra signaling ) , usf2 ( bhlh transcription factor ) , jund , yy1 ( bhlhzip transcription factor and il6 - tnf signaling ) , hoxa13 ( tgfb1 - bmp2 signaling ) , fgfr3 ( ins1 - stat3 signaling ) , cdk4 ( d - cyclin - ink4a signaling ) and tef .
fish also decreased two phosphatase transcripts ( rab5c , eef2 ) linked to cell proliferation ; and altered three transcripts that might increase cell proliferation ( decreased bop1 , increased cd36 and abce1 ) .
fung may have increased cell proliferation via changes to phosphates including dusp9 ( jun - cdkn2a signaling ) , ppp1ca ( ins1 - hras ) , ptpn , and ppp2cb ; and the kinase and ptpra ( src tyrosine kinase signaling ) .
contrastingly , fung could have also decreased cell proliferation via decreased ighmbp2 ( tgfb1 - hgf signaling ) , cyp24 ( vdre signaling ) , ccnb1 ( less cdk1 activation ) , and tcfe3 ( bhlh - zip tf ) .
comb also affected transcripts implicated in cell proliferation ( see table 4 for details ) .
relative to other groups , fish likely increased apoptosis via camk2b ( ins1 / hras signaling ) , and nfkbia ( nfkappab signaling ) , but there was also evidence of changes to transcripts that would decrease apoptosis ( e.g. , via decreased dvl2 ) .
fung and comb may also have increased apoptosis , but through different signaling cascades than noted for fish .
oxidative stress and inflammation with respect to combating oxidative stress , relative to other groups , fish increased various peroxidases ( gpx1 , prdx2 , prdx4 , mpo ) ; increased an aldehyde dehydrogenase ( aldh1a7 , possibly via srebp1a signaling ) ; and affected heat shock proteins ( hspb1 coding hsp25 / 27 was decreased , hspcb was increased ) .
these observations are consistent with the major lc - pufa in fish ( 20:5n3 , 22:5n3 , 22:6n3 ) being more oxidizable than the major fa in fung ( 20:4n6 ; and small amounts of 22:4n6 and 22:5n6 formed endogenously following consumption ) .
conclusion overall , diets rich in 20:4n6 , 20:5n3 / 22:6n - 3 , and the combination of the two , had unique affects on the murine hepatic transcriptome , signaling cascades , and the predicted metabolome .
the balance of dietary n6 and n3 lc - pufa used in nutritional / neutraceutical applications could have profoundly different affects on metabolism and cell signaling , beyond that previously recognized .
future studies are needed to evaluate the effects of various ratios of n6 and n3 lc - pufa on the transcriptome in diverse species , and in numerous tissues .
methods experimental diets , feeding and dissection conditions for obtaining mouse liver , nucleic acid preparation , and gene expression analysis using the murine 11k genechip have been previously published [ 1,10,11 ] .
the above information is summarized ; new procedures are described in detail .
diets diets contained 90 % fat - free ain93g rodent diet , 0.4 % milk fat , 1.2 % palm olein , 1.9 % sunflower oil , 1.5 % soybean oil and 2.1 - 5.1 % medium chain triacylglycerol oil [ 1 ] .
medium chain triacylglycerol oil in cont was partly replaced with : 1.1 % fungal oil ( providing 0.5 dietary wt % aa and 1.0 en % aa ) in fung ; 1.9 % fish oil ( providing 0.5 dietary wt % dha and 1.0 en % dha ) in fish ; and 1.1 % fungal oil and 1.9 % fish oil in comb .
aa and dha levels were provided at levels known to affect neurotransmitter levels and behavior in rats [ 93 ] ; and were not excessively high ( 2 - 3 fold higher than that recommended for infants , with slower delta 6 desaturase activity than rodents ) .
statistical and gene selection procedures principle component analysis and hierarchical clustering pca was performed with genesight ( tm ) software ( biodiscovery , inc. ; fig. 1 ; p < 0.001 ) .
probe set measurements from mu11k a and b arrays were combined , creating 13 k probe sets .
to reduce data dimensionality , 371 probe sets differentiating the four groups from one another was pre - selected from the 13 k following : log transformation ; centering values on each array by subtraction of the array mean value ; and selecting probe sets whose expression was most significantly affected by diet , using an f - statistic .
to address the paucity of replicate arrays ( only two replicates for cont ) , residuals derived from multiple genes were binned with a global error assessment ( gea ) model [ 11 ] .
within - group variance was calculated per gene by combining 500 residual measurements from genes of similar intensity .
set intersection was used to find the smallest set of probes differentiating the four groups from one another ( table 1 ; p < 0.001 ) .
tables 2 , 3 described below include gea - selected genes ( p <= 0.001 , 0.001 < p <= 0.005 , 0.005 < p <= 0.010 as indicate by asterisks in the table 3 legend ) .
hierarchical clustering included the 371 probes and used euclidean distance metric and average linkage ( fig. 2 ) .
fold change calculations labeled rna from 5 pooled mice per group was hybridized to mu11k affymetrix chip arrays " a " and " b " , each with 6.5 k probe sets .
expression values for each probe set were calculated with affymetrix software .
data were log transformed discarding non - positive values , and log mean values subtracted to compare arrays .
for cont , two mu11k chips were used to calculate a mean ; a single mu11k chip was used for other groups .
differential regulation for each dietary pair comparison was computed by subtracting normalized , log transformed values .
differential expression ( de ) values were converted to fold change ( fc ) values : if de > 0 , fc = antilog ( de ) ; if de < 0 , fc = - antilog ( - de ) .
enrichment analysis enrichment analysis was performed on differentiating gene lists , ranking gene ontology ( go ) terms by frequency of occurrence ( table 2 ) [ 94 ] , using biodiscovery , inc. software .
gene lists and go term assignments from affymetrix ids were mapped to gene symbols to minimize false positives resulting when a large number of probe sets correspond to a single gene .
differentiating genes were selected at p < 0.001 , and the most significant go terms were computed at p < 0.01 .
p is the false positive rate , the probability of a random gene for each go term having as many genes with the same go term as the actual list [ 94 ] .
consistency analysis chip sets a and b above had multiple oligonucleotide probe sets for some genes with affymetrix 's unigene cluster mapping .
two differentially regulated genes ( hba - a1 , acly ) had multiple probe sets but the direction of differential regulation was consistent in pair wise comparisons ( table 3 ) .
pathway analysis ( figs. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ) pathway analysis was performed ( ingenuity systems software , redwood city , ca ) to derive biological and signaling connections amongst the differentially regulated genes in table 3. of the 127 genes in table 3 , the program selected 66 focus genes having direct - and 132 having indirect connections , totaling 198 genes for pathway analysis .
direct connections require any two nodes ( genes or gene products ) to make direct physical contact .
indirect connections permit intermediate factors between nodes .
the 198 genes were divided into 13 networks .
networks 1 - 5 had 15 - , 12 - , 13 - , 13 - and 5 focus genes , respectively .
the remaining 8 networks had 1 gene each and were not considered .
network diagrams including these 58 focus genes and some connection genes were redrawn for simplicity ( figs. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ) .
the 5 networks were independent from one another , except for an indirect connection via jun linking figs. 3 , 4 .
abbreviations were from genecards [ 95 ] .
functional , biological , and pathway information sources functional and biological information on genes was obtained from : afffymetrix netaffx analysis center [ 96 ] ; embl bioinformatic harvester [ 97 ] ; genecards [ 95,98 ] ; medminer [ 99,100 ] ; and ncbi entrez gene [ 101 ] .

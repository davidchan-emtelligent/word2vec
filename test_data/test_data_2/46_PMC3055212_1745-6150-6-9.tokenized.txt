background b lymphocyte stimulator ( blys ) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily of ligands that mediates its action through three known receptors .
blys has been shown to enhance the production of antibodies against heterologous antigens when present at elevated concentrations , supporting an immunostimulatory role for blys in vivo .
methods we constructed a fusion protein consisting of human blys and pneumococcal surface adhesin a ( psaa ) and used this molecule to immunize mice .
the immunostimulatory attributes mediated by blys in vivo were evaluated by characterizing immune responses directed against psaa .
results the psaa - blys fusion protein was able to act as a co - stimulant for murine spleen cell proliferation induced with f ( ab ') 2 fragments of anti - igm in vitro in a fashion similar to recombinant blys , and immunization of mice with the psaa - blys fusion protein resulted in dramatically elevated serum antibodies specific for psaa .
mice immunized with psaa admixed with recombinant blys exhibited only modest elevations in psaa - specific responses following two immunizations , while mice immunized twice with psaa alone exhibited undetectable psaa - specific serum antibody responses .
sera obtained from psaa - blys immunized mice exhibited high titers of igg1 , igg2a , igg2b , and igg3 , but no iga , while mice immunized with psaa admixed with blys exhibited only elevated titers of igg1 following two immunizations .
splenocytes from psaa - blys immunized mice exhibited elevated levels of secretion of il - 2 , il - 4 and il - 5 , and a very modest but consistent elevation of ifn - gamma following in vitro stimulation with psaa .
in contrast , mice immunized with either psaa admixed with blys or psaa alone exhibited modestly elevated to absent psaa - specific recall responses for the same cytokines .
mice deficient for one of the three receptors for blys designated transmembrane activator , calcium modulator , and cyclophilin ligand [ caml ] interactor ( taci ) exhibited attenuated psaa - specific serum antibody responses following immunization with psaa - blys relative to wild - type littermates .
taci - deficient mice also exhibited decreased responsiveness to a standard pneumococcal conjugate vaccine .
conclusion this study identifies covalent attachment of blys as a highly effective adjuvant strategy that may yield improved vaccines .
in addition , this is the first report demonstrating an unexpected role for taci in the elicitation of antibodies by the psaa - blys fusion protein .

background b lymphocyte stimulator ( blys , also designated tall - 1 , thank , baff , tnfsf13b , and tnfsf20 ) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily of ligands [ 1,2 ] .
blys is expressed by activated t cells , activated macrophages , and dendritic cells [ 1,3,4 ] and has been implicated in autoimmune disorders characterized by the presence of pathological concentrations of self - antigen - reactive antibodies , such as systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) [ 5 ] and rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) [ 6 ] .
biological activity of blys is mediated via three receptors present on b and t cells designated transmembrane activator and calcium - modulator and cyclophilin ligand [ caml ] interactor ( taci ) , b - cell maturation antigen ( bcma ) and baff receptor ( br3 or baff - r ) [ 7 ] .
a functionally related molecule , designated april ( a proliferation inducing ligand ) [ 8 ] has also been described in mice and humans .
april binds to taci and bcma but not to baff - r [ 9 ] .
our laboratory has been interested in attempting to define mechanisms that influence the elicitation of antibody responses in the mammalian host .
in this regard , we have been interested in strategies that increase the magnitude and diversity of antibody isotypes and cell - mediated immune responses to antigens of interest , while minimizing non - specific and frequently deleterious immune responses that normally accompany the use of powerful adjuvants such as complete freund 's adjuvant ( cfa ) and other bacterially derived products [ 10 ] .
therefore , blys was of considerable interest to us given numerous reports in the literature that demonstrated direct effects of blys on b cells .
transgenic mice that over - express the human ortholog of blys exhibit marked splenomegaly characterized by elevated numbers of b cells , as well as elevated concentrations of serum antibodies [ 11,12 ] .
a similar , though transitory elevation in serum immunoglobulin has also been observed following daily administration of purified blys to mice .
one of these studies demonstrated an elevation only in serum igm and iga , but not igg [ 1 ] , while another study noted elevation in the serum concentrations of igm , iga , igg and ige [ 13 ] .
yet another study demonstrated that daily administration of blys to mice immunized with t - independent , or t - dependent antigens resulted in substantial elevations of antigen - specific serum antibody titers [ 14 ] .
collectively , these observations provided us the rationale to evaluate the ability of blys to act as a co - stimulant for a t - dependent antibody response in vivo .
to that end we constructed a genetic fusion of blys to the test antigen psaa ( pneumococcal surface adhesin a ) [ 15 ] .
psaa is one of a number of highly conserved proteins expressed by streptococcus pneumoniae that are currently being investigated for possible inclusion in a third - generation protein - based pneumococcal vaccine that can extend protective coverage to capsular serotypes not represented in the currently licensed second - generation polysaccharide - diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccines [ 16 ] .
immunity to psaa has previously been shown to be protective against pneumococcal infection , and the development of strategies that can enhance the immunogenicity of this , as well as other pneumococcal protein antigens for possible use in future vaccines are therefore of interest .
we reasoned that optimal stimulation of immune responses might be achieved when the antigenic stimulus ( psaa ) and the co - stimulatory signal ( blys ) were temporally and spatially linked .
our results indicate that fusion of blys to the test pneumococcal antigen psaa , results in enhanced psaa - specific cellular and antibody responses , compared to immune responses elicited by simple co - administration of blys together with psaa or psaa alone in the absence of conventional adjuvants .
this study also reports an unexpected role for taci in the enhanced immunogenicity of the psaa - blys fusion in the immunized host .
results expression , purification and characterization of recombinant proteins we constructed a series of plasmids that were used to direct the expression of recombinant proteins in e. coli ( figure 1a ) .
recombinant proteins containing blys were purified from inclusion bodies following iptg induction of the relevant e. coli expression strains .
psaa was purified from the soluble fraction of iptg induced e. coli lysates as previously described [ 17 ] .
evaluation of the recombinant proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) ( figure 1b ) showed protein bands of the expected molecular masses , and western blot with psaa - specific antisera ( figure 1c ) confirmed the same .
we used standard proliferation assays to test the biological activity of psaa - blys .
the results of 8 independent experiments performed using splenocytes from balb / c mice and c3h / hej mice demonstrated that psaa - blys was able to enhance the viability of splenocytes when used alone ( figure 1d ) , or when used in conjunction with f ( ab ') 2 anti igm fragments as a b cell proliferation stimulus ( figure 1e ) .
these data confirmed that psaa - blys retained the stimulatory [ 12 ] and co - stimulatory [ 1,2 ] activities previously described for blys .
we were unable to demonstrate any co - stimulatory activity of blys when used in conjunction with suboptimal concentrations of hamster anti - mouse cd3epsilon to stimulate t cell proliferation .
previous experiments by others have observed blys - mediated t cell co - stimulation only when blys is immobilized on culture plates , but not in soluble form [ 18,19 ] .
however , we were able to demonstrate a potent stimulation of ifn - gamma secretion by splenocytes in response to blys together with suboptimal concentrations of anti - cd3epsilon , ( data not shown ) .
these data are consistent with previous observations that blys has t cell co - stimulatory activity [ 18 - 20 ] .
figure 1 design , purification and characterization of recombinant proteins .
a , diagrammatic representation of recombinant proteins purified from lysates of e. coli .
purified recombinant proteins were subjected to sds - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were detected by direct staining with coomassie blue ( b ) , or by western blot using a psaa - specific mouse anti - serum ( c ) .
the ability of blys - containing fusion protein to enhance the viability of splenocytes from c3h / hej mice was tested in the absence ( d ) or presence of a suboptimal concentration of polyclonal f ( ab ') 2 anti - mu ( e ) .
antibody responses elicited by immunization previous studies in our laboratory had established that immunization of mice with psaa at 100 pmol ( 3.7 mug per mouse ) in the absence of adjuvants resulted in the elicitation of low to undetectable psaa - specific antibodies .
we therefore chose this concentration of protein for all immunization experiments with psaa .
mice immunized once with psaa exhibited the expected low to undetectable psaa - specific serum antibody responses ( figure 2a ) .
mice immunized once with the psaa - blys fusion protein ( psaa - blys ) exhibited a robust psaa - specific antibody response ( figure 2a ) .
mice immunized once with equimolar concentrations of psaa and blys ( 3.7 mug psaa + 1.9 mug blys , corresponding to 100 pmol of each ) exhibited no elevation of psaa specific serum antibodies ( figure 2a ) .
antibody responses following a second immunization of mice with the same antigen combinations ( psaa , psaa + blys , or psaa - blys ) resulted in no psaa - specific antibody response to psaa immunization , a modestly elevated psaa - specific antibody response to psaa + blys , and a far more robust psaa - specific response to psaa - blys ( figure 2b ) .
figure 2 evaluation of antigen - specific and non - specific immunoglobulin responses .
psaa specific serum antibody responses were determined for balb / c mice immunized with the indicated recombinant proteins .
mice were immunized on weeks 0 and 3 and bled at weeks 2 and 5 for evaluation of primary ( a , c and e ) and secondary ( b , d and f ) antibody responses to psaa , human blys and dsdna , respectively , as indicated .
serial dilutions of individual sera from 5 mice were tested for total ( igkappa ) antibodies to specific antigens by elisa and are plotted as means +/ - sem for 5 mice per group .
g , mice immunized twice with the indicated antigens as in figure 2b were boosted with psaa alone and bled at week 9 for psaa specific antibody responses .
h , the relative immunogenicities of psaa administered with various adjuvant formulations was tested in c3h / hej mice .
groups of mice were immunized once and bled after 2 weeks for the evaluation of psaa - specific total antibody responses by elisa .
data are presented as means +/ - sem for 5 mice per group .
because mice with elevated levels of blys ( blys transgenic mice , [ 12,21 ]) tend to exhibit high titers of circulating autoantibodies , we sought to evaluate the effect of immunizations with blys on the levels of autoantibodies in our experiments .
to that end mice immunized once ( figure 2c ) or twice ( figure 2d ) with psaa - blys , psaa + blys or blys alone all failed to exhibit elevated dsdna - specific antibody responses .
in contrast , sera from non - immunized 6 - month - old mice of the autoimmune prone mrl / lpr strain ( positive dsdna antibody control ) exhibited high titers of dsdna specific antibodies .
we also observed that mice immunized once with psaa - blys , psaa + blys or blys alone exhibited undetectable human blys - specific antibodies ( figure 2e ) , while immunization twice with psaa - blys or psaa + blys exhibited modest but detectable human blys - specific antibody responses .
mice immunized twice with psaa alone or blys alone had undetectable human blys - specific antibody responses ( figure 2f ) .
we subsequently used lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) resistant c3h / hej mice to simultaneously rule out an lps contamination effect on immune responses elicited by the recombinant proteins , and to evaluate the ability of a series of adjuvant formulations to prime for a primary psaa - specific antibody response .
as shown in figure 2g , psaa emulsified in freund 's complete adjuvant exhibited the most robust psaa - specific antibody responses , followed in order of effectiveness by the psaa - blys fusion protein , and psaa admixed with cpg containing oligodeoxynucleotides ( cpg ) .
the remaining admixed combinations of psaa + non - cpg containing oligodeoxynucleotides ( non - cpg ) or psaa + blys were not effective at eliciting a primary psaa - specific antibody response .
evaluation of the igg subclass distribution of psaa specific antibodies elicited by the different psaa immunization regiments are summarized in figure 3a .
these data demonstrated that mice immunized twice with psaa , or psaa + blys exhibited psaa specific antibodies exclusively of the igg1 subclass .
these results contrasted markedly with the subclass distribution of psaa - blys immunized mice , which exhibited dramatic elevations for igg1 , igg2a , igg2b and igg3 subclasses .
contrary to our expectations however , none of the immunization regimens resulted in a psaa - specific serum iga response ( data not shown ) .
collectively these data indicate that covalent linkage of blys to a test antigen results in a highly immunogenic protein , which is more effective at eliciting antibody responses than is the test antigen merely admixed with blys .
figure 3 evaluation of antigen - specific immunoglobulin subclass and cytokine production .
a , the igg subclass distribution of psaa - specific antibodies was determined by elisa for sera obtained from balb / c mice at week 5 ( following 2 immunizations as outlined in figure 2 ) .
data are presented as means +/ - sem for 5 mice per group .
b , for elispot assays , c3h / hej mice immunized with the indicated antigens at week 0 , and boosted with psaa alone at week 2 .
splenocytes were prepared from individual mice at week 3 were stimulated with soluble psaa for the evaluation of psaa - stimulated cytokine secreting cells , or with elispot plate - immobilized psaa for the enumeration of psaa - specific antibody secreting cells ( asc ) .
the data for cytokine spots are combined from two experiments with 3 mice per group and the data for asc are from one experiment with 3 mice per group .
spots from individual mice and group means are shown .
evaluation of psaa - specific cellular recall responses the marked elevations in psaa - specific serum igg2a and igg3 antibodies following immunization with psaa - blys led us to become interested in evaluating , by elispot , the cytokine secretion profiles of t cells generated by exposure to blys at the time of initial ( primary ) antigenic exposure .
the data for cytokine secretion assays are summarized in figure 3b .
spleen cells from mice primed with psaa - blys responded with the production of il - 2 , il - 4 , and il - 5 and very modest but consistent ifn - gamma production .
mice primed with psaa or psaa + blys exhibited only modest elevations in il - 2 , il - 4 and il - 5 in response to psaa stimulation , while the ifn - gamma responses were below those observed for unstimulated control cultures .
we used elispot to evaluate frequencies of psaa - specific antibody secreting cells in the spleens of immunized mice .
psaa - blys primed mice had larger numbers of psaa - specific asc than mice primed with either psaa or psaa + blys .
overall , evaluation of the cellular responses supports the conclusion that fusion of psaa to blys resulted in a superior immunogen compared to psaa mixed with ( but not covalently linked to ) blys , or to psaa alone .
evaluation of antibody responses in taci - deficient mice a previous report demonstrated that mice deficient in expression of taci , one of the 3 known blys receptors , are unable to mount normal antibody responses to polysaccharide antigens ( ti - 2 ) , while the antibody responses to t - dependent ( td ) protein antigens remain normal [ 22 ] .
we immunized mice with a variety of antigens to characterize the antibody responses .
our data demonstrate that taci - deficient mice mount an attenuated primary ps - specific antibody response following immunization with either purified type 3 ps ( figure 4a ) or to a type 3 ps - crm197 conjugate vaccine ( figure 4b ) .
taci - deficient mice were able to mount normal antibody responses to the td antigens klh ( figure 4c ) and dt - b ( figure 4d ) .
the primary serum antibody responses were also essentially identical between taci - deficient and taci - expressing littermates following a single immunization with either klh or dt - b ( data not shown ) .
immunization of mice with psaa - blys , followed by a boost with psaa alone revealed that taci - deficient mice failed to mount a robust psaa - specific serum antibody response following either the primary immunization ( figure 4e ) or a boost with psaa ( figure 4f ) .
these results were interesting given our expectation that psaa - blys would be acting as a td antigen .
in subsequent experiments , we demonstrated that immunization of taci - deficient mice with psaa in cfa followed by a boost with psaa alone elicited psaa - specific antibody responses of equal magnitude to those of taci - sufficient wild type ( taci +/+) or heterozygous ( taci +/ - ) mice ( data not shown ) .
these results support our contention that that the defective antibody responses to psaa - blys by taci - deficient mice point to a specific requirement for taci in the immune response to psaa - blys .
figure 4 evaluation of antigen - specific immunoglobulin responses in taci - deficient mice .
taci - deficient mice ( - / - ) , wild type (+/+) or heterozygous (+/ - ) littermates were immunized with type 3 ps [ ps ] ( a ) or type 3 ps - crm197 conjugate [ conj ] ( b ) and evaluated for ps specific serum antibodies by elisa 2 weeks later .
taci - deficient or wild type littermates were immunized at weeks 0 and 2 with klh [ 50 mug / mouse ] ( c ) , or dt - b [ 2 mug / mouse ] ( d ) , and evaluated for specific antibody at week 4 by elisa .
for psaa - specific serum antibody responses , taci - deficient , wild type , and heterozygous mice were immunized with 100 pmol of psaa - blys fusion protein at week 0 ( 1degrees ) and boosted with psaa at week 3 ( 2degrees ) .
mice were bled at weeks 2 and 6 for the evaluation of primary ( e ) or secondary ( f ) psaa - specific serum antibodies , respectively , by elisa .
data are presented as means +/ - sem for sera from individual mice ( 4 - 5 mice per group ) .
in a - d a405 values for preimmune sera ( diluted 1:100 ) were subtracted to generate specific absorbance for sera at 1:100 dilution .
discussion blys has been the subject of extensive investigations following its initial discovery and characterization as a b lymphocyte stimulator .
many of the investigations have focused on characterizing the role of blys in the generation and maintenance of b cell driven autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus , and rheumatoid arthritis .
we undertook these experiments to characterize the effects of blys on the induction of cellular and humoral immune responses to a heterologous antigen .
our experiments suggest that blys is a potent molecular adjuvant when administered to mice in the form of a fusion protein conjugated to the target antigen .
a mild adjuvant effect of blys was observed for mice immunized with admixtures of blys and psaa , and moderate increases in psaa - specific antibodies were only evident following two immunizations with the admixture .
these psaa - specific antibody responses were further increased in the tertiary response following a boost with psaa alone .
this enhancing effect of blys coadministration on psaa - specific antibody responses is consistent with previous reports demonstrating the ability of blys to enhance the viability of suboptimally activated b cells [ 23 ] , and to promote the survival of plasmablasts [ 24 ] .
we therefore suggest that enhanced viability of psaa - specific b cells / plasmablasts , rather than other mechanisms , such as increased t cell help was responsible for the observed difference in antibody responses between psaa + blys and psaa .
this notion is indirectly supported by our ready demonstration of a survival effect of blys on cell viability in vitro , and because the psaa - specific cytokine production elicited by primary immunizations with psaa + blys and psaa alone were similar .
although the tertiary antibody responses following two immunizations with psaa + blys admixtures followed by psaa alone were almost as high as the tertiary antibody responses observed for two immunizations with the psaa - blys fusion protein followed by psaa alone , this response remained restricted to the igg1 subclass in the former cohort , while the latter cohort maintained the broad igg subclass distribution observed for the secondary responses to psaa - blys ( data not shown ) .
conjugation of blys to psaa clearly produced increased psaa - specific responses over those observed with psaa and blys admixtures .
we hypothesize that this resulted from efficient antigen capture via blys specific receptors and subsequently improved antigen presentation and t cell costimulation , as has been shown for a model system utilizing a fusion of antigen to il - 2 [ 25 ] .
the broad igg subclass distribution of igg responses elicited in response to immunization with the fusion protein suggest that the modest increases observed in antigen specific ifn - gamma production may have been sufficient to drive the production psaa - specific igg2a [ 26 ] .
alternatively , the efficient production of this subclass and other igg subclasses may have been driven by blys mediated enhancement of cytokines not studied here , such as il - 27 which has been shown to direct the production of igg2a in the absence of ifn - gamma [ 27 ] .
our results demonstrate that continuous administration of large amounts of blys are not required to observe at least some enhancing effects on the immune response to coadministered antigens , and suggests that unconjugated blys may find utility as an adjuvant administered with antigen as an admixed bolus , particularly in situations where conjugation to target antigens of interest is not feasible .
our results demonstrate that the human ortholog of blys (~ 85 % amino acid identity and 94 % similarity to murine blys within the c - terminal extracellular domain ) [ 1 ] is biologically active in mice .
we observed a modest but reproducible anti - hblys response in mice immunized twice with psaa - blys , but we did not investigate whether these antibodies were capable of inhibiting the biological activities of exogenous ( human ) or endogenous ( murine ) blys .
future studies to address the functional consequences of an anti - blys response are of interest [ 28 ] , wherein we would evaluate the ability of multiple immunizations with psaa - blys to attenuate disease progression and autoantibody production in an mrl / lpr mouse model of sle or in a collagen induced arthritis mouse model of ra [ 29,30 ] .
strategies aimed at attenuating the biological activity of blys are justified , given the presence of increased levels of endogenous blys in the circulation of mrl / lpr mice [ 11 ] , as well as the frequently observed elevation of blys in ra and sle patients [ 5,6,31 ] .
numerous studies have demonstrated b cell and t cell co - stimulatory attributes of blys. of the three receptors described for blys , baff - r has been identified as the main receptor on b and t cells through which blys exerts its co - stimulatory effects [ 19,32 ] , while taci has been shown to be dispensable for the proliferation of purified b cells in response to stimulation with blys and anti - mu [ 33 ] .
the majority of b cells , as well as a subset of t cells express baff - r [ 19 ] , while taci is expressed on a subset of b cells , including marginal zone ( mz ) b cells [ 19 ] and memory b cells [ 34 ] .
other studies have shown that splenic b cells , which normally express low levels of surface taci can be induced to express high levels of taci by stimulation with anti - mu [ 35 ] or toll - like receptor ( tlr ) ligands like cpg containing oligodeoxynucleotides ( cpg odn ) [ 36 ] .
investigation of the expression of taci on t cells has produced conflicting results .
one report has shown that a polyclonal affinity purified antibody raised against taci binds to a subset of phorbol myristoyl acetate ( pma ) - activated human t cells [ 37 ] , while another study with taci - specific monoclonal antibodies raised against murine and human taci failed to show taci expression on the surface of resting or activated murine or human t cells , respectively [ 19 ] .
the third receptor for blys , bcma appears to be expressed exclusively on spleen and bone marrow plasma cells [ 34 ] .
the initial characterization of mice deficient in bcma revealed no overt abnormalities in the lymphoid cell compartment , and these mice mounted normal antibody responses to all antigens [ 38 ] .
however , a more recent study has demonstrated that bcma - deficient mice exhibit a defect in the survival and maintenance of long - lived bone marrow plasma cells [ 39 ] .
mice deficient in baff - r have reduced numbers of b cells (~ 10 % of baff - r intact littermates ) and exhibit attenuated responses to td antigens , but close to normal responses to ti - 2 antigens [ 40,41 ] .
the phenotype of blys deficient mice is even more severe than that of baff - r deficient mice , and these mice exhibit impaired immunoglobulin responses to both ti - 2 and td antigens , in addition to ~ 10 fold reductions in total b cells and baseline immunoglobulin concentrations , relative to blys intact littermates [ 41,42 ]. by contrast , taci - deficient mice have increased numbers of b cells (~ 200 % of taci intact littermates ) and exhibit a defective response to ti - 2 antigens , while retaining the capacity to mount normal responses to td antigens [ 22,33 ] .
on the basis of these published observations , we might have expected that baff - r would be the main receptor through which blys ( as a biologically active fusion partner to the t dependent antigen psaa ) would exert its immunostimulatory effects .
our observation that the relatively potent immunogenicity exhibited by psaa - blys depended on taci expression was therefore unexpected .
this observation suggests that the enhanced immunogenicity of psaa - blys was not simply the result of a carrier effect wherein potentially immunogenic peptide fragments from human blys that are not identical to those derived from endogenous ( murine ) blys could provide additional linked t - cell - epitopes that could have contributed to the immunogenicity of the fusion protein .
a possible explanation for our results is provided by recent article that has reported very high levels of taci expression on murine bone marrow - derived dendritic cells ( bmdc ) [ 30 ] .
expression of baff - r and bcma was also observed on these bmdc preparations , but at much lower levels than observed for taci .
a separate study has also reported taci expression , but no baff - r expression on human monocyte - derived dendritic cells ( dc ) [ 43 ] .
the discovery of taci expression on dc is key , because dc are widely acknowledged to be essential to the priming of naive t cells for a productive immune response in vivo [ 44 ] .
if the significant expression of taci on dc is confirmed for naturally arising dc populations in the mammalian host , it would suggest that the potent immunogenicity of psaa - blys is primarily facilitated by the binding of the fusion protein to dc via taci .
in the absence of evidence for taci expression by dc , we would be prompted to entertain the hypothesis that b cells were the primary apc ( by virtue of their expression of taci ) responsible for the enhanced immunogenicity of psaa - blys .
although there is evidence that antigen - specific b cells can serve as effective apc for naive cd4 + t cells specific for the same antigen [ 45 ] , the large number of such antigen - specific b cells that would be required in vivo to have an impact makes this hypothesis less appealing .
the observation that t cells derived from a taci - deficient mouse strain ( independently generated on a genetic background similar to that used for the taci - deficient mice used in our experiments ) respond to in vitro co - stimulation with anti - cd3 and blys in a fashion similar to wild type ( taci sufficient ) littermates [ 19 ] suggests that a deficit in t cell responses due to taci ablation cannot explain the attenuated immunogenicity of psaa - blys in our taci - deficient mice .
it is also curious that the expected presence of psaa - specific activated t cells apparently failed to support a psaa - specific antibody response via other co - stimulatory pathways known to be critical for t - dependent ( td ) antibody responses , such as the cd40 - cd40l ( cd154 ) axis [ 46 ] .
in summary , our data are consistent with the hypothesis that dc - mediated antigen presentation of psaa - blys via the binding of blys to taci is essential for initiating ( priming ) the psaa - specific immune response , followed by subsequent enhancement of this immune response via blys mediated agonistic effects such as immunoglobulin class switching [ 47 ] , enhanced b and plasma cell survival [ 14 ] , and t cell co - stimulation [ 19,32 ] .
future studies using mice deficient in the other two known receptors for blys ( baff - r and bcma ) should help to define the relative importance of each blys receptor in the induction of immune responses by psaa - blys .
additionally , immunization of cd4 + t cell - deficient mice [ 48 ] , and mice deficient in cd40l [ 49 ] ( which have defective antibody responses to td antigens but intact responses to ti antigens ) with the psaa - blys fusion may shed more light on the t - dependence or - independence of the response to psaa - blys .
one of the main arguments against using blys as an adjuvant is its propensity to promote autoantibody production when present at elevated concentrations for prolonged periods of time .
the fact that we were unable to demonstrate an elevation in dsdna specific antibodies following one or two immunizations with a blys containing protein antigen would argue that transient elevation in blys concentrations by itself might not be sufficient to induce autoantibody production .
another possibility is that the seemingly modest blys - specific antibody response elicited by our constructs might have been capable of neutralizing some of the biological activities of blys and thereby attenuating autoantibody production .
alternatively , the amounts of blys administered in our experiments may have been insufficient to drive self - sustaining autoantibody production .
consistent with the latter view is the observation that while daily injections of mice with up to 75mug of blys ( 3 mg / kg ) for 14 days resulted in elevated quantities of total serum antibodies , these antibody levels returned to baseline within 2 weeks following cessation of the blys injections [ 13 ] .
the utility of blys as a vaccine adjuvant has recently been demonstrated in a murine model of pulmonary pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [ 50 ] .
in this study mice administered an adenoviral vector containing blys coding sequences ( adjuvant ) along with a heat killed whole cell p. aeruginosa vaccine ( pa ) exhibited higher antibody concentrations than mice vaccinated with either pa alone or pa and an empty adenoviral vector .
blys co - administration elicited elevated numbers of pa - specific cd4 + t cells secreting ifn - gamma but not il - 4 .
the blys - treated pa - vaccinated mice were solidly protected from lethal pulmonary challenge with live p. aeruginosa , while pa vaccinated mice not receiving blys were not significantly protected .
this protection correlated positively with a substantial reduction of live bacteria in the lungs of challenged mice , and was dependent on cd4 + t cells , as vaccination of mice deficient in cd4 + t cells with both pa and blys were unprotected .
the critical contribution of cd4 + t cells to protection was further underscored by the observation that blys co - administration elicited similar pa - specific antibodies in cd4 + t cell intact and cd4 + t cell - deficient mice .
conclusions there is need for more and improved vaccines that protect against pneumonias with a bacterial aetiology .
although antibody - dependent mechanisms have long been assumed to be exclusively responsible for protection against extracellular bacteria at mucosal surfaces , several reports have recently demonstrated an antibody - independent role for cd4 + t cells in protective immunity against respiratory infections .
to that end , il - 17 [ 51 ] and ifn - gamma [ 52 ] production by cd4 + t cells have been shown to be protective .
the protective action of both il - 17 and ifn - gamma results from the ability of these cytokines to direct the activation and infiltration of neutrophils to sites of infection for enhanced bacterial killing .
as such , the development of protective vaccines against mucosal infection must incorporate the capacity for eliciting cell - mediated ( cd4 + t cell ) responses characterized by ifn - gamma and / or il - 17 production in response to antigens from such pathogens .
this study suggests that covalent attachment of blys can be an effective adjuvant strategy that might yield improved vaccines .
the elicitation of psaa - specific antibodies belonging to the igg1 , igg2 and igg3 subclasses , as well as the modestly increased numbers of ifn - gamma secreting cells supports the notion that blys effectively facilitates the induction of a broad range of humoral and cell - mediated immune responses .
another study has also demonstrated that blys dramatically expands il - 17 secreting cd4 + t cells [ 30 ] .
collectively , these data suggest that the effectiveness of vaccines that protect against bacterial pneumonias caused by gram - positive ( streptococcus pneumoniae ) and gram - negative ( p. aeruginosa ) organisms can be enhanced by exploiting the immunostimulatory attributes of blys as an adjuvant .
methods mice and immunizations six - to eight - week old female balb / c , c3h / hej , and mrl / mpj - faslpr / j ( mrl / lpr ) mice were purchased from the jackson laboratory , bar harbor , maine .
mice deficient in taci have been previously described [ 22 ] .
the genetic background of the taci knockout mouse colony is equally 129svj and c57bl / 6 [ 22 ] , and brother sister matings were used to generate taci +/+ , taci +/ - and taci - / - genotypes .
the genotyping of taci mice was performed by pcr using the primers mts - 1 , 5 ' cctcaggccaggagcttttagggagaa 3 ' ; mt - as2 : 5 ' ccagcatcccctctgctctggttttat 3 ' ; and neo - s1 , 5 ' cctgggtggagaggctttttgcttcct 3 ' .
primers mt - s1 and mtas2 amplify a 440 bp pcr fragment from the wild type locus and primers neo - s1 and mt - as2 amplify a 300 bp pcr fragment from the disrupted taci locus .
the pcr conditions used were one cycle at 95degreesc for 5 minutes , followed by 35 cycles ( 92degreesc for 1 min. , 64degreesc for 1 min. , and 72degreesc for 1 min. ) followed by a 10 min .
cycle at 72degreesc .
amplified products were electrophoresed through 1.2 % tris - borate - edta buffered agarose gels , and stained with ethidium bromide to visualize the amplified pcr products .
all mice were housed under specific pathogen - free conditions , with sterile food and water ad libitum .
the case western reserve university institutional animal care and use committee approved all animal experiments .
for immunizations , groups of 5 - 6 mice were injected intraperitoneally ( i.p. ) with antigens in 100 mul of phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) .
mice were immunized with 100 pmol of recombinant antigens ( psaa , psaa - blys , blys , or equimolar mixtures of blys and psaa ) unless otherwise indicated .
in some experiments synthetic phosphorothioate cpg containing oligodeoxynucleotide ( odn ) 1826 ( 5 ' tccatgacgttcctgacgtt 3 ') and non - cpg odn 1972 ( 5 ' tccaggacttctctcaggtt 3 ') ( gifts from clifford harding , case western reserve university ) were used as adjuvant and control odns , respectively at 50 mug admixed with 100 pmol psaa in pbs per mouse .
complete freund 's adjuvant ( cfa ; sigma ) was used as a 1:1 ( v / v ) emulsion with 100 pmol psaa in pbs .
sera were prepared from blood collected from mice via the tail vein and were stored at - 20degreesc until used for assays .
plasmid construction and recombinant protein purification a plasmid encoding the soluble extra - cellular domain of human blys was constructed by cloning a pcr amplified fragment of blys ( amino acids 140 - 285 ) into pet27b + ( novagen ) at the ncoi and xhoi sites .
a plasmid encoding psaa fused to the n - terminus of soluble blys was made by ligating the psaa coding sequence from the previously described p29 - psaa plasmid [ 17 ] into pet27 - blys at the xbai and hindiii sites .
this action replaced the signal peptide sequence in pet27 - blys with an s - tag sequence .
recombinant proteins were expressed and purified from lysates of the e. coli expression strain bl21 ( de3 ) ( novagen ) by metal affinity chromatography according to the manufacturers instructions ( novagen ) .
the purified recombinant proteins were dialyzed extensively against pbs containing 50 mm tris ( ph 8.8 ) .
protein concentrations were estimated using a bradford kit ( bio - rad ) and filter sterilized using 0.22 mum syringe filters ( millipore ) prior to storage at 4degreesc .
endotoxin ( lps ) contamination of recombinant proteins was measured using a limulus amebocyte lysate kit ( lal ; sigma ) and were determined to be below the level of detection (< 50 endotoxin units / ml ) .
additional recombinant proteins used in these experiments were non - lipidated putative protease maturation protein a ( ppma ; amino acids 21 - 309 ) of streptococcus pneumoniae [ 53 ] , and the non - toxic b fragment of diphtheria toxin ( dt - b , amino acids 202 - 535 ) [ 54 ] .
each was cloned as a pcr amplified gene fragment into pet29b + plasmid ( novagen ) at ncoi and xhoi .
these recombinant proteins were expressed and purified from lysates of recombinant e. coli as described above .
additionally , keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( klh ) purchased from sigma was used as a t - dependent antigen , and type 3 capsular polysaccharide ( ps ) from streptococcus pneumoniae was used as a type 2 t - independent antigen .
a glycoconjugate vaccine consisting of type 3 ps covalently linked to diphtheria toxoid ( crm197 ) was a gift of dr. ron eby , wyeth vaccines .
gel electrophoresis and western blot for detection of recombinant proteins recombinant proteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) under reducing conditions , and either stained directly with coomassie blue to visualize the proteins , or else electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride ( pvdf ) membranes ( bio - rad , hercules , ca ) for protein detection by western blot .
the pvdf membranes were reacted first with polyclonal mouse psaa - specific antisera , followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti - mouse igg .
positively reacting protein bands were visualized by incubation in 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolylphosphate - nitroblue tetrazolium ( bcip - nbt ) chromogenic phosphatase substrate ( sigma ) .
in vitro assay for blys bioactivity standard co - stimulation assays were performed to demonstrate that the recombinant blys proteins produced for these experiments retained their ability to stimulate b cells .
splenocytes from c3h / hej mice or balb / c mice were seeded into individual wells of a 96 well plate at 5 x 105 cells per well in rpmi supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( rpmi - 10 ) .
serial dilutions of recombinant psaa or psaa - blys in rpmi - 10 and a f ( ab ') 2 fragment of goat anti - mouse igm ( mu heavy chain specific ) in rpmi - 10 were added to wells in triplicate .
the final volume was 200 mul per well .
plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37degreesc in 5 % co2 .
alamar blue ( accumed ; 20 mul per well ) was added at 48 hrs , and plates were incubated at 37degreesc for an additional 20 - 24 hours .
absorbances at 570 nm and 600 nm were read using a bio - rad plate reader .
data are presented as specific absorbance ( a570 - a600 ) .
increased absorbance is directly proportional to the amount of reduction of alamar blue in stimulated cultures , which in turn is directly proportional to the number of viable cells in each well [ 55 ] .
recombinant psaa and psaa - blys were tested at 1000 nm - 15.6 nm in four - fold dilution steps , and f ( ab ') 2 anti - mu or control goat f ( ab ') 2 were each used at 1 mug / ml. similar t cell co - stimulation assays were performed using recombinant blys and a hamster anti - mouse cd3epsilon monoclonal antibody ( southern biotechnology associates , birmingham , al ) as the primary t cell stimulus .
an isotype - matched hamster antibody of irrelevant specificity from the same vendor was used as a control in these assays .
the alamar blue procedure described above was used for the evaluation of t cell proliferation by splenocytes from balb / c and c3h / hej mice .
characterization of antibody responses elisa was used to characterize psaa - specific antibody responses in mice immunized with psaa , psaa and blys or psaa - blys fusion protein generated in these experiments .
briefly , 96 - well plates ( immulon i , dynatech , chantilly , va ) were coated with recombinant psaa ( 2 mug / ml , 100 mul per well ) overnight at 4degreesc .
serial dilutions of sera were added to the wells in duplicate .
alkaline phosphatase ( ap ) - conjugated antibodies specific for murine immunoglobulins were used as the secondary reagent .
the plates were developed by adding p - nitrophenyl phosphate ( sigma ) and read at 405 nm using a spectrophotometer ( molecular devices , inc. ) .
relative antibody concentrations were determined by performing elisa on serial dilutions of individual sera .
ap - conjugated antibodies specific for murine immunoglobulins ( ig ) were purchased from southern biotechnology associates , birmingham , al. to test for the elicitation of human blys - specific antibodies following immunization of mice with the blys - containing recombinant proteins and mixtures described above , elisa assays were performed as described above , except that the microtiter plates were coated with recombinant blys ( 2 mug / ml , 100 mul / well ) .
to test for the elicitation of autoantibodies in mice that had received blys or psaa - blys as part of the immunization regiment , we performed elisa assays to detect the presence of double - stranded ( ds ) dna specific antibodies .
immunlon i plates were coated with calf thymus dna ( sigma ) at 2.5 mug / ml , 100 mul per well overnight at 4degreesc .
plates were washed and incubated with serial dilutions of antisera from immunized mice .
sera from 6 - month - old mrl / mpj - faslpr / j ( mrl / lpr ) mice were included as positive ( dsdna reactive ) controls , and sera from 3 - month - old balb / c mice were included as negative ( dsdna non - reactive ) controls .
following washes , bound antibodies were detected using ap - conjugated goat anti - mouse igkappa , after incubation with p - nitrophenyl phosphate as described above .
antibodies specific for klh and dt - b were assessed by elisa in the sera of klh and dt - b immunized mice using immulon 1 microtiter plates coated with klh ( 10 mug / ml , 100 mul per well ) or dt - b ( 2 mug / ml , 100 mul per well ) , and were developed as described for psaa - specific antibody detection .
type 3 ps - specific antibodies elicited in response to immunization with type 3 ps or its crm197 conjugate were assessed by elisa using polysorp plates ( nunc , roskilde , denmark ) coated with type 3 ps ( 10 mug / ml , 100 mul / well ) , as previously described [ 17 ] .
evaluation of cellular psaa - specific recall responses cytokine recall responses specific for psaa were evaluated using an enzyme linked immunospot ( elispot ) assay .
this assay has been shown to be suitable for enumeration of low frequencies of antigen specific cellular responses following in vivo priming with antigen [ 56 ] .
assays were performed essentially as described , with minor modifications [ 56 ] .
briefly , plates ( immunospot , resolution technology , columbus , oh ) were coated overnight at 4degreesc with the cytokine - specific capture abs specified below .
the plates were blocked with 1 % bsa in pbs for 1 h at room temperature and washed four times with pbs .
subsequently , freshly isolated spleen cells from groups of mice primed with psaa , psaa + blys , psaa - blys fusion protein , or psaa in complete freund 's adjuvant , and boosted with psaa in pbs were plated at 1 x 106 per well in flat - bottom , 96 - well microtiter plates in serum - free hl - 1 medium ( biowhittaker , walkersville , md ) supplemented with l - glutamine at 1 mm , in the presence or absence of recombinant psaa .
after 24 or 48 h of cell culture in the incubator , the cells were removed by washing three times with pbs and four times with pbs containing 0.05 % tween ( pbst ) .
detection abs were added and incubated at 4degreesc overnight ( either horse radish peroxidase ( hrp ) - labeled or biotinylated ) .
the plates were washed three times with pbst .
for biotinylated detection mabs , streptavidin - hrp ( dako , carpenteria , ca ) was added at 1:3000 dilution , incubated for 2 h at room temperature , and removed by washing twice with pbst and twice with pbs .
the spots were visualized by adding hrp substrate 3 - amino - 9 - ethylcarbozole ( pierce , rockford , il ) .
the following combinations of capture and detection mabs were used for il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 5 , and ifn - gamma assays respectively : jes6 - 1a12 ( 5 mug / ml ) and jes6 - 5h4 - biotin ( 2 mug / ml ) , bvd4 - 1d11 ( 2 mug / ml ) and bvd4 - 24g2 - biotin ( 2.5 mug / ml ) , trfk5 ( 5 mug / ml ) and trfk4 - hrp ( 2 mug / ml ) , and r46a2 ( 5 mug / ml ) and xmg1.2 - hrp ( 2 mug / ml ) .
image analysis of elisa spot assays was performed on a series 1 immunospot image analyzer ( resolution technology , columbus , oh ) customized for analyzing elisa spots to meet objective criteria for size , chromatic density , shape , and color .
detection of psaa - specific antibody secreting cells ( asc ) was assessed for splenocytes from immunized mice by a slight modification of the elispot assay described above .
briefly , plates were coated with psaa in place of cytokine capture antibodies , and splenocytes were added to wells , as above .
following incubation , detection of total psaa - specific asc was effected by incubation of washed wells with hrp - conjugated anti - mouse igkappa , followed by spot development with 3 - amino - 9 - ethylcarbozole .
reviewers' comments reviewer 1 : jonathan yewdell , national institute of allergy and infectious diseases , laboratory of viral diseases immunogenicity , the ability of a substance to elicit an immune response , is the difference between a vaccine protecting an individual against a given infectious disease vs. the individual suffering the consequences of infection .
there are two elements to immunogenicity .
one is the antigen itself .
the antigen must be given in a form that elicits the right type of adaptive immune response , which is some combination of antibodies ( produced by b cells ) and t cells .
the other element is the adjuvant , which activates elements of the innate immune system to in turn license b and t cells to become activated .
the need for adjuvants ( charlie janeway 's famous dirty little secret ( 1 )) to induce effective immunity to most non - infectious antigens ( infectious agents typically have considerable adjuvant activity of their own ) is probably the greatest stumbling block to improving vaccines to infectious diseases .
a significant number of individuals simply do n't respond to many vaccines , a problem that is greatly exacerbated with age .
better adjuvants would also allow use of lower doses of antigen , saving money and potentially lives , when to cite a cogent example , amounts of vaccine are limited and swine flu is on the march .
in the past , adjuvants were based on empirical observation of increased immunogenicity .
many of the best adjuvants ( e.g. complete freund 's adjuvant , heat killed mycobacteria emulsified in mineral oil ) have such severe side effects that their use is proscripted even in experimental animal studies .
there is but one fda approved adjuvant for use in humans , alum ( alas ) .
after 30 years of basic research into the molecular basis of immunity , the fruits are beginning to ripen , and there is a wealth of information regarding the molecular switches downstream of adjuvant activation of innate immunity .
gor et al. focus on one such switch , the wonderfully named blys ( b lymphocyte stimulator ) , expressed by immune cells to interact with receptors on b and t lymphocytes .
they convincingly show that conjugation of blys synthesized in bacteria to a medically important antigen ( pneumococcal surface adhesin a ) increases antibody responses , in a manner dependent on one of the three known blys receptors , taci .
intriguingly , the adjuvant effect of blys required covalent conjugation of blys to antigen ( i.e. immunizing a mixture of antigen plus blys did not enhance immunogenicity ) , pointing the way to future studies on the processing and presentation of antigen to b cells , a field with tremendous opportunity for making basic discoveries , not to mention additional studies on other antigens ( e.g. flu vaccine ) .
in summary , this is a fine study in an area of research , immune adjuvant development , of great interest from both basic and translational aspects .
one of the most telling findings is figure 2 , panel h , where the impressive adjuvant effects of blys still fall far short of complete freund 's adjuvant , pointing to the need for increased funding for adjuvant research .

reviewer 2 : michael cancro , department of pathology and laboratory medicine , university of pennsylvania school of medicine ( nominated by andy caton , wistar institute ) the fusion protein is expressed as expected and the fused blys retains biological activity , based on the viability assays in figure 1 .
the data in figure 2 show that the fusion protein yields higher titres of psa specific antibodies than immunization with psa alone or psa with simultaneously administered free blys .
these data also indicate that no dsdna - binding antibodies are generated upon a brief blys or psa - blys exposure .
accordingly , the central idea may have merit , but questions remain regarding the basis for and import of these enhanced titers .
first , it is not clear whether this reflects the biological activity of blys - blys receptor interactions in promoting b cell survival / activation per se , or instead represents a " carrier " effect that enhances t cell activation , and does not rely on blys 's native biological activity .
the fusion protein involved human blys with some linkers , and will thus contain sequences that might be presented to and recognized by mouse t cells , making this a plausible possibility .
since a carrier effect requires linked recognition , treatment groups with simultaneous free blys administration do not address this concern .
a number of approaches might be taken to address this , but the most incisive might be a direct measure of whether any t cells specific for human blys epitopes are generated .
this might be accomplished by a t cell proliferation or il - 2 induction assay using apcs pulsed with hblys plus t cells from the psa - hblys primed mice .
alternatively or in addition , one might construct similar fusion proteins with either human blys that has had its receptor - binding site disrupted , which should not enhance ; or with mouse blys , which should .
the second question arises upon noting that antibody levels are enhanced about 5 - fold over controls in most of the primary immunizations .
this increase is fairly modest , and is dwarfed by the ~ 1000 - fold differences observed when cfa is used as an adjuvant .
thus , one wonders what the absolute magnitude ( on a weight per volume basis ) of the antibodies might be , and whether the increases in titre would afford increased protection .
accordingly , the paper would be strengthened by a fully quantitative ( mcg / ml ) assessment of the serum antibody , and by including some measure of whether the increases with blys - psa yield significant shifts in the infectivity per se or in an in vitro surrogate for virulence / adhesion .
the results with the taci deficient mice are intriguing , although they seem somewhat tangential to the rest of the manuscript .
while the observation is interesting , additional experiments are required to assess their import and relationship , if any , to the main thrust of the article .
a minor point is the implication that the viability assay used in figure 1 necessarily reflects cell division .
this is unlikely in panel d of figure 1 , inasmuch as blys alone does not induce cell division , but indeed fosters survival in vitro .
assays directly discerning survival and division , rather than just the relative number of viable cells at the end of culture , would more directly interrogate the biological activities of the fusion product ( e.g. ; flow cytometric analysis of cfse plotted against either topro or dapi ) .
nonetheless , the biological activity of blys in the fusion protein indeed seems to be preserved .
this point is only made for precision .
author 's response we did consider the possibility , cited by the reviewer , that the enhanced immune response to psaa covalently linked ( versus not linked ) to blys could have been due to carrier function as opposed signalling through blys receptors .
while we agree that mutating the receptor - binding site on blys would have been a valuable way to address the importance of signalling through blys receptors , when these studies were carried out , the receptor - binding site on blys was not defined .
in support of the interpretation that the increased immunogenicity of psaa - blys versus psaa alone or psaa + blys , taci - deficient mice exhibited a smaller increment than taci - expressing mice in the antibody response as a result of covalently linking blys to psaa .
since earlier work ( von bulow et al. , 2001 ) and our own studies established that taci - deficient mice responded normally to other typical protein ( i.e. , thymus - dependent , or td ) antigens , we think it is unlikely that the substantially decreased magnitude of the antibody response to psaa - blys of taci - / - mice , in comparison to taci +/+ mice , is attributable to an effect of taci - deficiency on the t cell response .
however , we acknowledge that it would have been useful to assess the cd4 + t - cell response to human blys in the mice immunized with psaa - blys .
we agree that quantitation of antibody responses in mcg / ml is preferable when possible .
when these studies were performed there were few commercial reagents available , and we did not have a monoclonal antibody specific for blys to use in establishing the standard curve required for such quantitation .
the results with the taci - deficient mice are not tangential in our view .
since as noted , above , taci - deficient mice responded normally to other typical protein ( i.e. , thymus - dependent , or td ) antigens ( klh and diphtheria toxoid ; also see von bulow et al. , 2001 ) , we believed it was relevant that taci - / - mice exhibited a reduced response to psaa - blys , relative to taci +/+ mice .
this result argues against blys functioning purely as a carrier protein , since if taci - deficiency substantially reduced the responses of cd4 + t cells , then we and others ( von bulow et al. , 2001 ) should not have found that taci - / - mice generated antibody responses to various protein immunogens comparably to taci +/+ mice .
we do agree with the reviewer that there are other aspects of the role of taci that would require further experiments .
the figure legend has been modified to reflect the reviewer 's insight , which is appreciated .
reviewer 3 : rachel gerstein , department of microbiology and physiological systems , university of massachusetts medical school psaa is a protein antigen from streptococcus pneumoniae .
efforts to generate a potent vaccine for s.p. that protects independent of capsule antigen serotype have not succeeded .
since the serotype is determined by the capsular polysaccharide , investigation of protein antigens from s.p. is important .
also , a serious limitation for vaccines are the adjuvants available for use in humans ; the most potent known adjuvants used in animal models cause side - effects , and so new adjuvants that are both effective and safe for use in humans are needed .
it would be helpful to state in more detail the rationale for using psaa as a model antigen .
blys is an essential cytokine that controls b cell development and homeostasis .
the authors made a fusion protein , psaa - hblys , which is readily expressed in e. coli and purified .
when cultured with mouse splenocytes , more cells are recovered when compared to culture with spa alone or a sub - optimal amount of anti - mu to stimulate b cell proliferation .
it is clear from the literature that blys promotes increased b cell viability and / or prevents apoptosis , so the experiment shows that the fusion has the activity expected for bio - active blys on mouse b cells .
psaa - specific antibody responses in mice were determined using elisa .
importantly , anti - dna abs are not detected ( blys over - expression in vivo leads to lupus and other autoimmune manifestations ) .
particularly impressive are the levels of specific ag when the secondary response is measured - much higher than when psaa + blys is given as separate molecules in priming .
interestingly , psaa alone can boost if psaa - blys or psaa + blys is given in the primary .
the authors discuss potential mechanisms behind this observation .
one goal of the study was to consider this fusion system as an adjuvant strategy - in this regard , when psaa - blys was compared to psaa + cfa , cfa was the most potent but psaa - blys is better than psaa + cpg ( another adjuvant that can promote antibody formation ) , so the blys conjugate does have activity as an adjuvant .
in figure 3 , the broad igg subclass distribution of the response to psaa - blys is documented .
also in figure 3 , asc are measured 1 week after boost ( in spleen ) and very few are detected .
although not central to the paper , the authors might consider using the same time points after boost as the elisa data and also examining the bone marrow , a major repository of asc .
in figure 4 , taci - deficient mice are compared to wt and heterozygous deficient mice .
interestingly , when mice are immunized using psaa - blys and boosted with psaa , the taci ko do not respond well when either primary or secondary responses are measured .
the interpretation and discussion of this result are thought provoking , given that the major defect previously noted in taci - deficient mice is in responses to ti - 2 antigens , and psaa is assumed to be a td antigen .
given the documented role of blys in augmenting ti responses , it seems worth considering as to whether there is a ti - component to the psaa - blys response .
overall , the ms reports data that will be of interest to immunologists and vaccinologists .
the experiments are done with appropriate rigor and reveal a potent affect for boosting specific antibody responses without resorting to problematic strong adjuvants .
author 's response we have added text to the background section ( p .
6 ) addressing the rationale for using psaa as a model antigen .
the reviewer has made the excellent point that the effect of blys is increased cell viability and not proliferation .
we have altered the figure legend to indicate that this is a viability / proliferation assay .
in the materials and methods section (" in vitro assay for blys bioactivity ") , we have described the alamar blue assay which was used to assess increased cell numbers , whether due to proliferation ( as in anti igm treated cultures ) or to increased viability ( as in cultures containing recombinant blys ) .
we have added material to the discussion section on the ability of psaa alone to boost if psaa - blys or psaa + blys is given in the primary. with reference to cytokines measured , we used an elispot assay .
the numbers of cytokine secreting spots are not very high using this assay , even for mice immunized with cfa , but they are clearly elevated for psaa - blys compared to psaa or psaa + blys primed mice .
in subsequent studies , we might increase the number of immunizations administered prior to assessment of cellular responses to accentuate any possible differences between groups that are reflected in the antibody production data .
we have changed the text in the abstract and throughout to reflect the very modest but consistent ifn - gamma production observed .
the reviewer has also made very reasonable points about using matching time points for the cellular and humoral responses , as well as including an assessment of asc in the bone marrow to obtain a more complete picture of the responses elicited , and we concur .
to address the insightful comments by the reviewer , we would like to briefly revisit some of our experimental observations and the assumptions underpinning our interpretation and presentation of the data .
we did not perform specific experiments to determine whether the psaa - blys response is a t cell dependent ( td ) response in the classical sense , in that we have not performed immunization experiments using cd4 + t cell - deficient mice .
rather , we proceeded with the calculated assumption that psaa is a td antigen .
this is supported by circumstantial observations such as the lack of repeating motifs in the primary amino acid sequence for psaa , the monomeric nature of the recombinant protein ( as determined by migration patterns through non reducing / non denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ) , the non - immunogenicity of psaa in the absence of adjuvants in both balb / c and c3h / hej mouse strains , and the ability to elicit elevated secondary antibody responses dominated by the igg subclasses other than igg3 , following primary immunization with standard adjuvants ( cfa , ifa ) .
these features are not characteristic of ti antigens .
perhaps we have inadvertently converted it ( psaa ) to a ti antigen by fusion to blys .
indeed one ( we ) should not be surprised if some aspects of the immune response resemble those elicited in response to classical t cell independent ( ti ) antigens , given that one of the blys receptors , taci is required for responses to ti antigens .
however , unlike classical ti antigens ( e.g. polysaccharides ) , which never had the capacity to elicit classical t cell help via mhc restricted antigen presentation , peptides derived from psaa in the psaa - blys fusion should still retain this capacity , and should therefore be influenced by the immunological mechanisms involved in td responses , such as the involvement of dc in the priming of the immune response .
if psaa - blys is indeed a ti antigen , we would still have to explain other features of the ig response elicited by it , such as the boostability of the response , which is not observed with classical ti antigens like polysaccharides , but is a hallmark of td responses .
additional indirect support for our assumption that t cells are critical to the immune response to psaa , whether fused to blys or not , comes from the recent finding that polymerized bacterial flagellin , a protein which was long held to be a t - independent antigen has instead been found to be a t dependent antigen ( c.j. sanders , y. yu , d.a. moore , 3rd , i.r. williams , and a.t. gewirtz , humoral immune response to flagellin requires t cells and activation of innate immunity. j immunol 177 ( 2006 ) 2810 - 18 ; pmid 16920916 ) .
for these reasons , we feel that the discussion of taci expression on dc is pertinent because it would be surprising ( and very possibly a first , since flagellin should now be considered a td antigen ) if there were no contribution of t cells to the response to an exogenous protein antigen ( psaa - blys ) .
although cd4 + t cell help for antibody responses to some viral antigens may be minimal , these antigens differ from psaa - blys in that they are primarily endogenously synthesized and largely presented on mhc class i. it would also be equally surprising if b cells were found to be the primary apc responsible for initiating the psaa - blys response .
this is underscored by the observation that one of the mechanisms for inducing tolerance to antigens is to exploit ag presentation by b cells , both activated and non - activated .
in this regard , our discussion of taci expression by dc represents the more conservative viewpoint ( namely that dc are the primary apc for productive responses to td antigens , and that virtually all proteins that have been studied to date thus far are invariably td antigens ) .
we did not mention the role of taci in class switching in the interest of focusing more directly on the observation that there was no psaa - specific antibody elicited in response to psaa - blys immunization in the absence of taci .
we certainly appreciate the reported role of taci in immunoglobulin class switching but we did not perform any specific experiments to address this in our current studies .
we do however now mention in the discussion ( p. 23 ) that blys mediates class switching , and the corresponding reference cited specifically states that taci and baff - r are involved in antibody isotype switching .
in summary , we acknowledge that the answer to the td / ti nature of the response to psaa - blys is an important issue , but we will have to address it in future studies .
because we are prepared for the possibility that both ti and td mechanisms are involved in the response to psaa - blys , experiments using t cell deficient mice ( to study the ti question ) would have to be carried out in conjunction with experiments using animals with defects in pathways known to affect td responses ( cd40 - cd40l axis , ox40 - ox40l axis , etc. ) , as well as a robust means to compare the responses elicited across the various experimental cohorts in order to obtain satisfactory resolution to this question .
yes indeed .
we have stated in the discussion that unambiguous instances of b cells being able to prime naive t cells for a productive immune response are rare .
the role of b cells in the blys - mediated response ( other than producing antibodies ) can only be addressed meaningfully after further experimentation to define the apc involved , the td vs. ti nature of the response , etc .
we have deleted the last paragraph from the conclusion , as we have not supplied experimental data on blys - mediated enhancement of responses to ti antigens , and to avoid confusion .
we appreciate the positive comments on the manuscript and also appreciate the highly insightful observations and questions posed in this review .

astrocytes , the most heterogeneous glial cells in the central nervous system ( cns ) , execute a multitude of homeostatic functions and contribute to memory formation .
consolidation of synaptic and systemic memory is a prolonged process and hours are required to form long - term memory .
in the past , neurons or their parts have been considered to be the exclusive cellular sites of these processes , however , it has now become evident that astrocytes provide an important and essential contribution to memory formation .
astrocytes participate in the morphological remodeling associated with synaptic plasticity , an energy - demanding process that requires mobilization of glycogen , which , in the cns , is almost exclusively stored in astrocytes .
synaptic remodeling also involves bidirectional astroglial - neuronal communication supported by astroglial receptors and release of gliosignaling molecules .
astroglia exhibit cytoplasmic excitability that engages second messengers , such as ca2 + , for phasic , and cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( camp ) , for tonic signal coordination with neuronal processes .
the detection of signals by astrocytes and the release of gliosignaling molecules , in particular by vesicle - based mechanisms , occurs with a significant delay after stimulation , orders of magnitude longer than that present in stimulus - secretion coupling in neurons .
these particular arrangements position astrocytes as integrators ideally tuned to support time - dependent memory formation .

studies performed in the early 1960s on patients who underwent bilateral medial temporal lobe surgery , recognized the hippocampus as a fundamental region for memory formation ( scoville and milner , 1957 ) .
subsequently , two distinct memory systems , declarative ( explicit ) memory for facts and events , for people , places , and objects (" knowing that ") and non - declarative ( implicit ) memory , the memory for perceptual and motor skills (" knowing how ") , have been defined ( dudai and morris , 2013 ) .
both systems rely on similar , if not identical , mechanisms associated with reinforcement of synaptic transmission , which involve morphological changes at the synapse that outlast memory stabilization ( attardo et al. , 2015 ) .
this morphology - based mechanism was considered by cajal ( 1894 ) ; who linked " cerebral gymnastics " ( box 1 ) with morphological alterations of dendrites and terminals of neurons .
box 1 cerebral gymnastics and memory formation " cerebral gymnastics are not capable of improving the organization of the brain by increasing the number of cells , because it is known that the nerve cells after the embryonic period have lost the property of proliferation ; but it can be admitted as very probable that mental exercise leads to a greater development of the dendritic apparatus and of the system of axonal collaterals in the most utilized cerebral regions .
in this way , associations already established among certain groups of cells would be notably reinforced by means of the multiplication of the small terminal branches of the dendritic appendages and axonal collaterals ; but , in addition , completely new intercellular connections could be established thanks to the new formation of [ axonal ] collaterals and dendrites.

new york , ny : oxford university press. p. 87. contemporary views assume that memory formation , although it is an outcome of a myriad of interactive processes , occurs in the form of molecular events at the level of an individual synaptic connection , which is termed synaptic plasticity .
these synaptic changes integrate through multiple synaptic connections involving larger neuronal networks , and are finally expressed at the behavioral level ( kandel et al. , 2014 ) .
memory formation and astrocyte morphology micro - anatomical changes that are part of memory formation are not exclusively related to neurons and their parts , but involve non - neuronal cells , which in many areas of the human brain exceed the number of neurons ( azevedo et al. , 2009 ) .
these non - neuronal cells include astrocytes , an abundant and arguably the most heterogeneous glial cell type in the central nervous system ( cns ) .
it is generally acknowledged that astroglia actively participate in information processing via cytosolic calcium signals ( verkhratsky et al. , 1998 ; rusakov et al. , 2011 ) .
a single astrocyte is intimately associated with many neurons and with their synaptic contacts .
a single rat cortical astrocyte enwraps 4 - 8 neuronal bodies and 300 - 600 dendrites ( halassa et al. , 2007 ) , and astrocytes are in contact with synapses .
in the rat hippocampus , an individual astrocyte can cover ( by perisynaptic processes ) up to 140,000 synapses ( bushong et al. , 2002 ) .
human hippocampal astrocytes are substantially larger and a single human astrocyte may be associated with ~ 2 million synapses ( oberheim et al. , 2006 ) .
abundant morphological interactions of astrocytic processes with neurons are not restricted to the hippocampus , being a widespread property of cns tissue .
close morphological apposition allows astrocytes to receive signals from the synaptic cleft and feedback by releasing their own signaling molecules .
release of many of these molecules occurs through a secretory pathway that uses cytoplasmic vesicles , which store chemical messengers .
on stimulation , the vesicle membrane fuses with the plasmalemma , a process termed regulated exocytosis .
the role of secretory vesicles in astrocytes was proposed in 1910 when nageotte ( 1910 ) suggested , based on his microscopic observations , that glial cells ( astroglia in particular ) act as secretory elements in the cns .
this hypothesis has been confirmed experimentally in the last two decades by identifying vesicular release of gliosignaling molecules , which are often termed gliotransmitters ( vesce et al. , 1999 ; haydon , 2001 ; parpura and zorec , 2010 ; zorec et al. , 2012 ) .
although there is some skepticism that this mechanism exists in astroglia ( fujita et al. , 2014 ; sloan and barres , 2014 ) , bidirectional astrocyte - neuron signaling is well accepted , and it is generally recognized that vesicle - based mechanisms participate in the heterocellular signaling that occurs at a morphofunctional unit known as the tripartite synapse ( araque et al. , 1999 ; perea et al. , 2009 ) .
this bidirectional communication is part of the wider gliocrine system ( vardjan and zorec , 2015 ) , which reflects the secretory role of astrocytes , which release an extensive number of gliosignaling molecules ( verkhratsky et al. , in press ) .
these molecules are largely not involved in synaptic processes but rather regulate various brain functions through " volume " transmission ( vardjan and zorec , 2015 ; zorec et al. , 2015 ) .
astroglia - derived signaling molecules are secreted into the extracellular space and are transported throughout the tissue parenchyma to distant places in the cns , likely taking advantage of the glymphatic convective system ( thrane et al. , 2014 ) .
during implicit memory consolidation of pavlovian threat conditioning , astrocytic processes retract from synapses in the lateral amygdala , allowing these synapses to enlarge , suggesting that contact with astroglial processes opposes synapse growth during memory consolidation ( ostroff et al. , 2014 ) .
in other words , if astrocytic processes enwrap synapses and the latter need to expand during memory formation , astrocytes may hinder this remodeling , demonstrating how astrocytic structural plasticity enables morphological remodeling of synapses associated with memory formation .
under physiological conditions , including reproduction , sensory stimulation , and learning , astrocytes display a remarkable structural plasticity .
distal astrocytic processes can undergo morphological changes in a matter of minutes , thus modifying the geometry and diffusion properties of the extracellular space and relationships with adjacent neuronal elements , especially with synapses .
this type of astroglial plasticity has important functional consequences because it modifies extracellular ionic homeostasis and neurotransmission , thus ultimately modulating neuronal function at the cellular and system levels ( oliet and piet , 2004 ; theodosis et al. , 2008 ) .
the mechanisms responsible for morphological changes in astrocytes are not known , but these may likely involve adrenergic receptors and generation of second messenger camp ( vardjan et al. , 2014 ) , which are discussed in the following section .
astrocyte morphology , camp and metabolism astrocytes are capable of a remarkable morphological plasticity .
astroglial cells in vitro have a flattened polygonal appearance , however stimulation of the beta - adrenergic camp - dependent signaling cascade results in rapid morphological remodeling with astrocytes assuming a stellate morphology with numerous processes ( shain et al. , 1987 ; bicknell et al. , 1989 ; hatton et al. , 1991 ; shao et al. , 1994 ; won and oh , 2000 ; gharami and das , 2004 ; vardjan et al. , 2014 ) .
this remodeling occurs within the time frame of memory consolidation ( minutes to hours ) and involves cytoskeletal reorganization , including the restructuring of actin filaments , microtubules , and intermediate filaments ( goldman and abramson , 1990 ; safavi - abbasi et al. , 2001 ) .
an example of this adrenergic receptor / camp - mediated morphological remodeling of astrocytes is shown in figure 1 ( vardjan et al. , 2014 ) .
similar morphological plasticity may take place in vivo in long - term memory formation because noradrenaline ( na ) , derived from projections of neurons located in the locus ceruleus ( lc ) , operates as a neuromodulator in hebbian learning ( johansen et al. , 2014 ) .
under similar training conditions , changes in astrocytic shape have indeed been observed ( ostroff et al. , 2014 ) .
moreover , the existence of structural - functional changes of the astrocyte - neuron interactions during memory processes have been detected ( lavialle et al. , 2011 ; bernardinelli et al. , 2014 ; perez - alvarez et al. , 2014 ) .

tight association between the synaptic membranes and astrocytes is considered essential for homeostatic control of the synaptic cleft , including rapid removal of the neurotransmitter glutamate ( bergles and jahr , 1997 ) and potassium from the extracellular space ( orkand et al. , 1966 ; verkhratsky and nedergaard , 2014 ) .
thus , retraction of astrocytic membrane from the synapse during memory formation ( ostroff et al. , 2014 ) may facilitate the spillover of neurotransmitter and thus affect synaptic transmission ( rusakov and kullmann , 1998 ) .
at the same time , memory formation is associated with morphological growth of synaptic elements together with enhanced protein synthesis and rearrangement of receptor proteins , all of which increase the energy consumption ( harris et al. , 2012 ) .
how energy substrates , needed for adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) synthesis , are delivered to synapses where synaptic plasticity takes place is still an open question .
a simple assumption would be that pyruvate is provided to the mitochondria by glycolysis within the neuron .
however , the morphology of astrocytes , with extensive end feet plastering blood vessels , is well suited to take up glucose from blood and distribute either glucose itself , or pyruvate or lactate derived from glucose , to astrocytic processes surrounding synapses , possibly by diffusion through gap junctions integrating astroglial syncytia ( rouach et al. , 2008 ) .
in support of this mechanism , diffusion of glucose within astrocytes is relatively rapid ( kreft et al. , 2013 ) and may well support glucose delivery via interconnected astrocytes in situ .
although synapses are the main energy consumers in the brain , glycogen , the only cns energy storage system , is present mainly , if not exclusively , in astrocytes .
memory consolidation in young chickens requires glycogenolysis ( gibbs et al. , 2006 ; hertz and gibbs , 2009 ) .
the successful consolidation of memory from short - term to long - term memory requires neuronal na release ( gibbs et al. , 2010 ) .
therefore , it appears that na , released from neurons , such as those from locus coeruleus , initiates astrocytic morphological changes and activates astroglial energy metabolism .
thus , na may be considered as an integrator of the metabolism , morphology and function of astrocytes .
in the adult operational ( i.e. , awake ) brain , na is the main signaling molecule that triggers astroglial ca2 + signaling ( ding et al. , 2013 ) , which represents the universal form of glial excitability ( verkhratsky et al. , 1998 ) .
astrocytes as hubs for the network reset system the lc is the primary source of na in the cns .
it is localized in the brainstem and projects widely , and is thus able to synchronously activate neural networks in several brain regions .
this may be regarded as a functional " reset " for many brain networks ( bouret and sara , 2005 ; sara , 2015 ) .
axons of lc neurons project to the spinal cord , the brain stem , the cerebellum , the hypothalamus , the thalamic relay nuclei , the amygdala , the basal telencephalon , and the cortex , although some cortical areas receive more abundant innervation ( chandler et al. , 2014 ) .
in all these structures , synchronous activation of lc projections ( bouret and sara , 2005 ) leads to coherent and synchronized electrical activity , possibly reflected by gamma waves on an electroencephalogram ( sara , 2015 ) .
lc innervation mediates arousal and the sleep - wake cycle , attention and memory , behavioral flexibility , behavioral inhibition and stress , cognitive control , emotions , neuroplasticity , posture , and balance ( benarroch , 2009 ) .
the effects of na are mediated through alpha - and beta - adrenergic receptors ( alpha / betaars ) which are expressed in neurons , microglia , and astrocytes .
the ars were among the first receptors to be causally linked to astroglial ca2 + signaling ( salm and mccarthy , 1989 ; kirischuk et al. , 1996 ) .
increases in astroglial ca2 + were observed in vivo after stimulation of the lc in anesthetized animals ( bekar et al. , 2008 ) .
in awake animals , stimulation of lc neurons triggered ( by activation of alpha - ars ) widespread astroglial ca2 + signals , which appeared in almost all astrocytes in the field of study ( ding et al. , 2013 ) .
this synchronous response may represent the means by which neural networks are coordinated .
simultaneously , through activation of beta - ars , the camp - dependent pathways are activated ; this in turn instigates rapid degradation of glycogen , which serves as the main energy reserve in the brain ( prebil et al. , 2011 ; kreft et al. , 2012 ) and initiates morphological plasticity of astrocytes ( vardjan et al. , 2014 ) .
vesicular release of gliosignaling molecules by having secretory vesicles clustered close to the plasma membrane , which is a hallmark of the active zone of the presynaptic terminal , the delay between the incoming stimulus and secretion is minimized , being as short as 100 mus ( sabatini and regehr , 1999 ) .
at the same time , vesicle - based release of chemical messengers can exhibit much longer delays in stimulus - secretion coupling .
in astrocytes , the mechanism prolonging the time between the arrival of the stimulus and the release of transmitters has been naturally selected , because the maximal speed of regulated exocytosis in astroglia appears much slower than that in neurons ( gucek et al. , 2012 ; neher , 2012 ; zorec et al. , 2015 ) .
regulated exocytosis also plays a role in many forms of cell - to - cell communication besides release of transmitters , being for example critical for the delivery of transporters , ion channels and antigen presenting molecules to the cell surface ( gucek et al. , 2012 ) .
vesicular trafficking and release , which have evolved ~ 3 billion years ago in arhaea ( spang et al. , 2015 ) , is fundamental for signaling and communication within the relatively large eukaryotic cell volume .
communication within large cells could no longer be supported by diffusion - based processes , which provide effective and rapid transport of molecules within the submicron range .
hence the development of subcellular organelles , such as secretory vesicles , presented a solution for the " signaling problem " in the relatively large volume of eukaryotic cells , to which astrocytes belong ( gucek et al. , 2012 ) .
an ideal approach to monitor the rate - limiting processes of regulated exocytosis in astrocytes at the cellular level is to measure changes in the plasma membrane area , which reflects the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane .
this can be monitored by measuring membrane capacitance ( cm ) , which is linearly related to the membrane area ( neher and marty , 1982 ) .
this technique was used in cultured astrocytes ( kreft et al. , 2004 ) to test the hypothesis that an increase in [ ca2 +] i , after photolysis of caged ca2 + ( neher and zucker , 1993 ) , elicits an increase in the whole - cell cm. a half - maximal increase in cm of these astrocytes was attained at ~ 27 mum [ ca2 +] i , which is similar to the ca2 + - dependency of regulated exocytosis in various types of neurons , recorded by a similar technique ( heidelberger et al. , 1994 ; bollmann et al. , 2000 ; kreft et al. , 2003a ) .
in contrast to neurons , however , a rather small , within 100 nm , increase in [ ca2 +] i from the resting level was sufficient to induce glutamate release from astrocytes , as detected by glutamatergic effects on nearby neurons , used as sniffer cells ( parpura and haydon , 2000 ) .
a similar high - affinity ca2 + sensing mechanism for vesicular release was reported in pituitary endocrine cells ( kreft et al. , 2003b ) .
at present , astrocytes appear to be the slowest secretors of all the excitable mammalian cells investigated thus far .
the kinetics of cm increase is at least two orders of magnitude slower than the kinetics of regulated exocytosis recorded by a similar technique in neurons ( kreft et al. , 2004 ; neher , 2012 ) .
the ca2 + - dependent increases in cm were sensitive to tetanus toxin ( which cleaves synaptobrevin 2 and cellubrevin ) , indicating a soluble n - ethyl maleimide - sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor and soluble nsf attachment protein receptor ( snap ) - based vesicular mechanism ( kreft et al. , 2004 ) .
why is regulated exocytosis in astrocytes so slow ?
one reason is the distinct slow kinetics of molecular mechanisms regulating the vesicle membrane - plasmalemma merger .
the number of snare molecules per vesicle , which is relatively low in astrocytes ( singh et al. , 2014 ) , may also contribute to the slow kinetics of regulated exocytosis .
slow delivery of vesicles to the plasma membrane fusion sites may also play a significant role .
the vesicle dynamics is an amazingly elaborate system , regulated by increases in [ ca2 +] i ( potokar et al. , 2013 ; vardjan et al. , 2015 ) .
for example , the complexity of vesicle traffic regulation in astrocytes is characterized by two typical , yet opposing , properties of vesicles that contain peptides , such as atrial natriuretic peptide , and / or atp , and those that carry amino acids , such as glutamate and d - serine , and are labeled by the glutamate transporter vglut1 ( potokar et al. , 2005 , 2013 ; vardjan et al. , 2012 ; vardjan and zorec , 2015 ) .
glutamatergic vesicles speed up with an increase in [ ca2 +] i ( stenovec , 2007 ) , whereas the same increase in [ ca2 +] i slows down peptidergic vesicles and endolysosomes ( potokar et al. , 2010 ) .
glutamatergic and peptidergic vesicles have the capacity to recycle .
the mobility of recycling peptidergic vesicles was studied in cultured astrocytes ( potokar et al. , 2008 ) and in intact brain slices ( potokar et al. , 2009 ) .
at rest , peptidergic vesicles moved faster and more directionally than after the exposure of astrocytes to ionomycin to increase [ ca2 +] i ( potokar et al. , 2008 ) .
the effect of increased [ ca2 +] i was dramatic ; the movement of vesicles was almost halted , with only a jitter associated with random diffusional movement remaining .
at least some of the peptidergic vesicles carry atp and a similar attenuation was observed in their mobility when astrocytes were stimulated ( pangrsic et al. , 2007 ) .
what is the physiologic significance of differential mobility of vesicles carrying specific cargo , for example , classic chemical transmitter vs. neuromodulators or neuropeptides ?
an increase or decrease in vesicle mobility may affect the efficiency of vesicle merger with the plasma membrane and the subsequent cargo discharge .
it is possible that vesicles engaged in the dichotomous regulation of vesicle traffic exhibit different vesicle sizes , which may determine the nature of vesicle traffic and fusion with the plasmalemma , as was reported for endocrine cells ( flasker et al. , 2013 ) .
increased mobility of glutamatergic vesicles ( which can quickly refill using vgluts ) may indicate that they could be discharged at multiple loci at times of increased ca2 + excitability , resulting in more diffuse signaling as opposed to spatially precise information transfer so characteristic of neuronal synaptic transmission .
this speculation seems to be aligned with the ability of astrocytes to modulate synaptic transmission at a long temporal domain and via broad extrasynaptic access sites to neurons .
impaired astrocytic vesicle traffic has been tentatively associated with intellectual deficiency ( id ) .
symptoms of id appear early in life and the disease affects about 2 % of the population .
family studies have demonstrated a relatively large number of x chromosome - linked forms of id ( xlid ) with an incidence of about 0.9 - 1.4 in 1000 males ( turner , 1996 ) .
one of the first genes found to be mutated in patients with xlid is gdp dissociation inhibitor 1 ( gdi 1 ; d'adamo et al. , 1998 ) , which encodes for guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor ( alphagdi ) , a protein physiologically involved in regulating gdp - bound rab proteins .
the identification of gdi1 association with id suggested that vesicular traffic in neural cells is an important pathway for the development of cognitive functions ( d'adamo et al. , 2002 ; bianchi et al. , 2009 ) .
although the importance of alphagdi in neuronal function has been demonstrated , it is unclear whether its role in glia vesicle trafficking contributes to the disease .
the alphagdi protein regulates the function of rab gtpases , such as rab 4 and rab 5 , which have been shown to regulate vesicle dynamics in astrocytes ( potokar et al. , 2012 ) , and it is likely that impaired vesicle traffic in astrocytes contributes to id , which is linked to impaired cognitive processes involving memory formation .
conclusion astroglial cells control homeostasis in the cns to support many processes including memory formation .
astrocytes contribute to memory as signaling hubs and as structures that alter their morphology and recruit energy resources for memory consolidation .
excitation - secretion coupling in astrocytes is loose and this may be of particular importance to support the slowness of the overall memory - related structural dynamics in the cns .

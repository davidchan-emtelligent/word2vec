unhealthy lifestyle characteristics such as low physical activity ( pa ) and high plasma glucose levels ( pgls ) may lead to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adulthood .
the aim of this study was to investigate ( i ) the level of physical activity ; ( ii ) the prevalence of pre - diabetes and ( iii ) the relationship between pa and plasma glucose level in a rural ellisras adult population aged 18 to 28 years .
a total of 713 young adults ( 349 males and 364 females ) who took part in the ellisras longitudinal study participated in the study .
fasting plasma glucose levels were analysed using accutrend glucose meters .
physical activity data was collected using a validated questionnaire .
linear regression was used to assess the relationship between pa and pre - diabetes .
the prevalence of pre - diabetes was between 45.7 % and 50.2 % and that of physical inactivity was 67.3 % and 71.0 % for males and females , respectively .
there was no significant ( p > 0.05 ) relationship between pa and pre - diabetes ( beta = 1.016 ; 95 % confidence interval from 0.352 to 2.777 ) .
the health benefits of pa increased with the increasing frequency , duration and intensity of exercise .
the prevalence of pre - diabetes was found to be very high in this population .
our results suggest that greater physical activity is associated with low plasma glucose levels .
physical activity plasma glucose levels prediabetes rural young adults south africa 1 .
introduction the number of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2dm ) was noted to be increasing worldwide and is expected to be 592 million by the year 2035 [ 1,2 ] .
hossain et al .
[ 3 ] added that this increase is closely linked to the upsurge in obesity .
furthermore , lloyd - jones et al .
[ 4 ] note that t2dm is a risk factor of vascular disease with 65 % of all deaths in people with diabetes due to cardiovascular disease .
although the improvement of the population 's knowledge and awareness of the risk factors associated with t2dm is essential to prevent future complications of the disease [ 5 ] , such information appears to be limited to rural populations where modernisation and industrialisation take place [ 6 ] .
physical activity ( pa ) , such as household , occupational , travel - related and occupational activities , plays an important role in the control of both weight and plasma glucose , thus reducing the likelihood of developing t2dm [ 7 ] .
physical activity improves insulin sensitivity , which helps with the uptake of glucose by cells [ 7 ] .
little is known about the benefits of pa on the prevention and treatment of t2dm in the rural south african population .
preliminary results of the ellisras longitudinal study ( els ) showed a decreased pa in both girls and boys over time [ 8 ] .
it was also shown that t2dm did not existing in the sample population of ages three to 15 years [ 9 ] .
however , the prevalence of obesity , overweight and hypertension was reported to be on the rise among the ellisras children over time , indicating the possibility of the emergence of diabetes [ 10 ] .
as the age of the els sample increases , the possibility of unknown cases of chronic diseases arises in the population .
currently no study has assessed the relationship between pa and blood glucose in ellisras adults ; thus , this study attempts to address the gap .
the aim of this study was , therefore , to investigate the levels of pa , the prevalence of pre - diabetes , the relationship between pa and plasma glucose level , and the risk of developing diabetes amongst ellisras rural young adults aged 18 to 28 years .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
geographical area ellisras , now known as lephalale , is a deep rural area situated within the northwestern area of the limpopo province , south africa .
about 50,000 people reside in 42 settlements [ 11 ] .
these villages are approximately 70 km from the ellisras town ( 23degrees40 's , 27degrees44'w ) , which is adjacent to the botswana border .
the iscor coal mine and the matimba electricity power station are the two major sources of employment for many ellisras residents .
the remaining workforce is involved in subsistence farming and cattle rearing while the minority is in education and civil service .
unemployment , poverty , and low life expectancy play a significant role in rural south african populations , and the ellisras rural area is no exception [ 12 ] .
2.2 .
sample details of the els research design and sampling have been reported elsewhere [ 13 ] .
for the purpose of this analysis , data collected in december 2014 and january 2015 are included .
in total , 717 young adults ( 352 males and 365 females ) , aged 18 to 28 years , who are part of the els took part in the survey .
the ethics committee of the then university of the north , now known as university of limpopo , granted ethical approval prior to the survey ( project identification id : mrec / p / 204 / 2013 : ir ) .
permission was granted by tribal authorities and the principals of schools .
participants read and signed informed consent .
2.3 .
physical activity the international physical activity questionnaire [ 14 ] was found to be reliable and valid .
the questionnaire was used to record data on work , leisure , and travel activities both on week days and weekends .
the score for these activities were attained by multiplication of the number of reported activities with the number of days engaged in those activities per week .
the total pa score was calculated as a summation of the types of activities for each participant .
the duration of these periods was added up to give a mean duration for moderate to vigorous physical activities during weekdays and weekends .
metabolic equivalents ( mets ) express the energy cost of physical activities as a multiple of the resting metabolic rate and yield a score in met - minutes .
met - minutes were obtained by multiplying the met score ( 8 for vigorous and 4 for moderate activity ) by the minutes performed [ 15 ] .
the principal investigator with the help of ellisras local teachers translated the questionnaire from english to the two local spoken languages ( northern sotho and setswana ) and then translated back to english .
the back translation to english showed no disparity with the northern sotho and tswana languages .
the senior northern sotho and tswana speaking physiology and environmental health department students of the university of limpopo who were specifically trained for using this questionnaire , interviewed the participants at local schools / halls ; with each interview lasting for about 30 min .
2.4 .
fasting plasma glucose participants were asked to fast for 8 - 10 h before blood collection .
all collections were done by a registered nurse at a local schools / halls .
fasting venous blood samples were collected in the morning [ 16 ] .
fasting blood samples were collected into 4 ml grey top vacutainer tubes ( vacutainer bdtm ) containing sodium fluoride and oxalate .
samples were then placed in a cooler box with ice ( 0 - 8 degreesc ) on site .
at the laboratory , fasting blood samples were centrifuged to obtain plasma at 2500 rpm for 15 min .
clotted and hemolysed samples were discarded .
plasma was stored at - 80 degreesc for later analysis .
measurements were done in the university of limpopo 's medical sciences laboratory using access supplied by beckman coulter .
2.5 .
dietary intake diet was measured using the 24 h recall method , which is a valid method to determine group dietary intakes [ 17 ] .
senior northern sotho speaking dietetic students of the university of limpopo , specifically trained in using socioeconomic questionnaire and the 24 h recall method , interviewed the participants at local schools on the dietary intake over the previous 24 h. for each participant , the interview took place on one weekday and on one weekend day in order .
an average of two days 24 h dietary intake was then made for each participant .
estimated portion sizes of foods consumed were recorded using a pre - tested questionnaire and food models simulating average portions of local foods [ 18,19 ] .
dietary data was analysed using local food tables and software [ 18 ] and compared with recommended intake [ 20 ] .
2.6 .
employment information was collected regarding employment by means of a questionnaire .
participants were asked to answer ' yes' if they are employed and ' no ' if not .
2.7 .
statistical analysis descriptive statistics of the three pa domains ( work , leisure , travel ) together with the plasma glucose concentration were reported .
all participants were classified as inactive , minimally active , or sufficiently active according to the international physical activity questionnaire ( ipaq ) [ 14 ] cut - off point that categorises physical activity as inactive (< 600 met - min / week ) , moderately activity ( 600 - 1500 met - min / week ) and sufficiently active (>= 1500 met - min / week ) .
the american diabetes association [ 21 ] cut - off points were used to define pre - diabetes as plasma glucose level between 5.6 and 6.9 mmol / l ( inclusive ) .
chi - square test was used to compare two or more sets of nominal data that have been arranged into categories by frequency counts of large samples , while the fisher 's exact test was used when the expected cell frequencies were smaller ( less than five ) .
a linear regression model was used for assessing the relationship between physical activity levels and plasma glucose unadjusted and adjusted for family history of diabetes , age , gender and dietary intake .
logistic regression was used to assess the risk of developing pre - diabetes for unadjusted and adjusted for family history of diabetes , age , gender and dietary intake .
all the statistical analyses were done using spss software ( version 23 , ibm , armonk , ny , usa ) .
statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 .
3. results a high unemployment rate ( 68.2 %) was reported amongst the els sample aged between 18 to 28 years .
table 1 shows descriptive statistics for met - min / week in the work , leisure and travel domains and the proportions of total physical activity with the corresponding plasma glucose concentrations of each age group .
males ( an average of 783.05 met - min / week ) were significantly ( p < 0.05 ) more active than females ( an average of 777.52 met - min / week ) .
plasma glucose concentrations were significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher for females ( 5.66 mmol / l ) compared to those of males ( 5.53 mmol / l ) .
table 2 shows the percentage distribution across pa categories of inactive , minimally and sufficiently active based on met - min / week .
the majority of the participants ( males = 67.3 % ; females = 71.0 %) could be classified as inactive ( i.e. , less than 600 met - min / week ). of the remaining participants , 9.4 % and 10.1 % males and females were , respectively , classified as minimally active ( i.e. , pa levels between 600 and 1500 met - min / week ) and 23.3 % males and 18.9 % females were sufficiently active ( at least 1500 met - min / week ) .
table 3 shows the descriptive statistics for the 24 h dietary intake recall by gender of ellisras rural young adults aged 18 to 28 years .
the intake of carbohydrates was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher for males ( 109.9 ) compared to females ( 105.3 ) .
fat intake was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher for females ( 21.0 g ) compared to males ( 16.9 g ) .
the prevalence of pre - diabetes is shown in figure 1 for the ellisras rural young adults aged 18 to 28 years .
the prevalence of pre - diabetes was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher in females ( 50.2 %) than in males ( 45.7 %) .
only 0.5 % of females had diabetes whilst no males had diabetes .
linear regression showed a significant ( p < 0.05 ) relationship between pa and pre - diabetes for the work category both unadjusted and adjusted for family history of diabetes , age , gender and dietary intake ( beta = 0.004 , 95 % ci : 0.003 to 0.005 ) ; however , no significant relationship was shown between the total physical activity and pre - diabetes .
logistic regression showed no significant relationship between pa and pre - diabetes , both unadjusted and adjusted for family history , age , gender and dietary intake ( beta = 0.016 , 95 % ci : 0.364 to 2.832 ) .
4. discussion the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between pa and the plasma glucose level amongst ellisras rural young adults aged 18 to 28 years .
a significant positive relationship between physical activity and glucose level was recorded in the current study .
the results of this study showed that there was an overall low level of physical activity amongst ellisras females as compared to males .
it was also observed that males spend generally more time doing work - related activities than females .
micklesfield et al .
[ 22 ] found similar results in adolescents of the mpumalanga province of south africa .
our study supports an assertion by amosun et al .
[ 23 ] that over a third of south african children are inactive ( 67.3 % males and 71.0 % females in this study ) .
furthermore , the low levels of physical activity in this population may be attributed to factors such as poverty [ 24 ] and environmental factors such as crime , lack of security , time constraints , inability to afford exercise equipment and lack of recreational facilities [ 25 ] .
the overall plasma glucose concentrations for females ( average 5.67 mmol / l ) were significantly higher than those of males ( average 5.51 mmol / l ) .
this is similar to what mccollum et al .
[ 26 ] found , although their study was based on an older population , where women were significantly older than men , and had less education and lower incomes ( which may lead to the consumption of unbalanced diets ) .
in the current study the prevalence of pre - diabetes was high ( males = 45.7 % ; females = 50.2 %) compared to the 25 % ( for both genders each ) found by okafor [ 27 ] in nigeria .
this difference could be due to the high levels of inactivity ( males = 67.3 % ; females = 71.0 %) and high family history of diabetes ( males = 21.6 % ; females = 28.5 %) in this population .
the high prevalence and long - term implications on health make diabetes a major concern for developing countries [ 28 ] .
the logistic regression showed no significant relationship between pa and pre - diabetes .
this was different from the findings by hu et al .
[ 29 ] who studied 70,102 nurses in the united states .
the contradiction may be due to the large difference in sample size between the two studies , with the later study having probably assumed more than 80 % power at the 0.05 significance level .
this study is cross - sectional ; thus , longitudinal data needs to be collected in order to conclude on the causal relationship between pa and t2dm in this population .
furthermore , diabetes is a multi - faceted disease with numerous risk factors ; physical activity alone is not enough to predict the possibility of developing diabetes , as reported in other studies [ 23,24 ] .
however , physical activity plays an important role in the control of both body weight and plasma glucose , thus reducing the likelihood of developing t2dm [ 7 ] .
recall of the time spent doing physical activity could introduce bias in the study , particularly in sub - saharan africa , given the illiteracy level [ 8 ] .
however , well - trained fieldworkers were reported to provide accurate information in south africa and nigeria [ 30 ] as was the case in the current study .
5. conclusions the prevalence of pre - diabetes ( 46 %) was high in this group of ellisras young adults aged between 18 to 28 years .
our results suggested that physical activity was associated with low plasma glucose levels , although the logistic regression showed no relationship between physical activity and pre - diabetes .
further studies are needed to investigate the development of biological and behavioural risk factors for diabetes in rural south african populations over time .

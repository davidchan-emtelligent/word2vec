the subjective representation of " time " is critical for cognitive tasks but also for several motor activities .
the neural network supporting motor timing comprises : lateral cerebellum , basal ganglia , sensorimotor and prefrontal cortical areas .
basal ganglia and associated cortical areas act as a hypothetical " internal clock " that beats the rhythm when the movement is internally generated .
when timing information is processed to make predictions on the outcome of a subjective or externally perceived motor act , cerebellar processing and outflow pathways appear to be primarily involved .
clinical and experimental evidence on time processing and motor control points to a dysfunction of the neural networks involving basal ganglia and cerebellum in movement disorders .
in some cases , temporal processing deficits could directly contribute to core motor features of the movement disorder , as in the case of bradykinesia in parkinson 's disease .
for other movement disorders , the relationship between abnormal time processing and motor performance is less obvious and requires further investigation , as in the reduced accuracy in predicting the temporal outcome of a motor act in dystonia .
we aim to review the literature on time processing and motor control in parkinson 's disease , dystonia , huntington 's disease , and tourette syndrome , integrating the available findings with current pathophysiological models ; we will highlight the areas in which future explorations are warranted , as well as the aspects of time processing in motor control that present translational aspects in future rehabilitation strategies .
the subjective representation of " time " is critical for cognitive tasks but also for motor activities .
recently , greater attention has been devoted to improve our understanding of how temporal information becomes integrated within the mechanisms of motor control .
experimental evidence recognizes time processing in motor control as a complex neural function supported by diffuse cerebral networks including cortical areas , cerebellum , and other subcortical structures ( ivry and spencer , 2004 ; coull and nobre , 2008 ) .
timing is an essential component of motor control primarily within two types of motor tasks : ( i ) when producing sequential rhythmic movements or sustained movements of a definite duration ( explicit timing ) ; ( ii ) when the temporal information is used implicitly , such as when coordinating our movements to those of moving objects or individuals within the external environment ( implicit timing ) .
in this review , we will provide a brief description of the neural network supporting motor timing focusing only on instrumental information to explain the link between timing and motor control in movement disorders .
then we will review available data on motor timing in parkinson 's disease , dystonia , huntington 's disease , and tourette syndrome , and discuss how this body of evidence integrates with the available information on the pathophysiology of these movement disorders .
finally , we will discuss the translational aspects of the explored neural mechanisms with respect to future rehabilitation strategies .
timing and time perception movement disorders neural pathways motor control rehabilitation the neural network of motor timing explicit timing when performing explicit timing tasks , we make an explicit use of temporal information ( e.g. , estimates of the duration of different stimuli or of their inter - stimulus intervals [ isi ]) in order to represent precise temporal durations through a sustained or periodic motor act ( coull and nobre , 2008 ) .
functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) ( bengtsson et al. , 2004 , 2005 ; lewis et al. , 2004 ; jahanshahi et al. , 2006 ; bueti et al. , 2008 ) and non - invasive brain stimulation ( koch et al. , 2003 ; dusek et al. , 2011 ; vicario et al. , 2013 ) studies of motor timing have consistently identified brain regions crucial to time processing , in particular supplementary motor area ( sma ) , basal ganglia ( bg ) , cerebellum and right - inferior frontal and parietal cortices .
the synchronization - continuation paradigm has been frequently used to study the neural substrates of explicit motor timing .
this paradigm allows for the study of both externally triggered and internally triggered movements as it involves : ( i ) a synchronization phase , in which subjects are asked to tap in synchrony with a train of tones separated by a constant isi , and ( ii ) a continuation phase , in which subjects are requested to continue tapping at the previous rate in the absence of the auditory cue .
using fmri paradigms , rao et al .
( 1997 ) showed that the continuation ( internally triggered ) phase , but not the synchronization ( externally triggered ) phase , activates the sma , the left - caudal putamen , and the left ventrolateral thalamus .
these findings support the existence of a hypothetical " internal clock " that beats the rhythm when the movement is internally generated ( pastor et al. , 1992b ; meck and benson , 2002 ; francois - brosseau et al. , 2009 ) , and involves the sensorimotor circuit of the bg ( figure 1 ) .
indeed , it has been proposed that several parallel , segregated loops through the bg connect back to distinct cortical areas ( namely motor , associative , and limbic network ) ( alexander et al. , 1986 ) .
the sensorimotor loop connects the motor areas in the cortex with the caudolateral striatum territories playing a role in stimulus - response habitual control ( redgrave et al. , 2010 ) .

neural networks involved in explicit and implicit timing and their possible contribution to time processing abnormalities in movement disorders are shown .
gpe , globus pallidus external ; gpi , globus pallidus internal ; stn , subthalamic nucleus ; sma , supplementary motor area ; m1 , primary motor cortex ; ppc , posterior parietal cortex .
the role of the bg in timing was further substantiated by demonstrating that they are activated during motor , but also perceptual , time processing tasks ( bueti et al. , 2008 ) involving both sub - second and supra - second temporal intervals ( jahanshahi et al. , 2006 ) .
noteworthy , the associative basal ganglia circuit is particularly active during externally triggered tasks ( figure 1 ) .
the cerebellum , instead , is more often activated ( i ) during motor than perceptual explicit timing tasks ( bengtsson et al. , 2005 ; jahanshahi et al. , 2006 ; bueti et al. , 2008 ) , ( ii ) when a synchronization to an external rhythm is required ( del olmo et al. , 2007 ) , and ( iii ) when processing involves sub - second rather than supra - second intervals ( lewis and miall , 2003a,b ) .
implicit timing timing is implicit when temporal information can optimize performance on a non - temporal task .
the processing of time - dependent features of a movement is crucial in predicting whether the outcome of the movement will be consistent with its ultimate goal , or will result in an execution error .
when temporal information is processed to predict the outcome of self - executed or externally - driven movements , cerebellar outflow pathways are primarily involved .
indeed , cerebellar networks optimize self - executed actions by recalibrating predictions , capturing the sensory consequences of the same actions ( bell et al. , 2008 ; synofzik et al. , 2008 ; izawa et al. , 2012 ) .
when subjects use temporal information inherent to the spatial - temporal trajectory of a dynamic visual stimulus to predict its final position , fmri studies revealed activation in the left inferior parietal cortex ( assmus et al. , 2005 ) , sensorimotor regions of the premotor and parietal cortices ( field and wann , 2005 ) , and cerebellum ( o'reilly et al. , 2008 ) .
we recently showed that the cerebellum is engaged when temporal information is processed to predict the temporal outcome of a motor act ( avanzino et al. , 2015a ) .
we developed an ad hoc task in which participants were required to observe a movement in a video and then predict the end of the same movement ( avanzino et al. , 2013 , 2015a ; martino et al. , 2015 ) .
crucially , a few seconds after its onset , the video was darkened for a given time interval , thus the task could be performed only by extrapolating time - related features of observed motion sequence. by this task , we have shown that inhibiting the activity of the lateral cerebellum with 1 hz - repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation induced a deterioration of timing performance selectively when subjects were asked to estimate the duration of a body segment movement ( handwriting ) and not of a movement involving an inanimate object ( avanzino et al. , 2015a ) .
this finding may suggest that cerebellar sub - regions are specifically involved in processing temporal features of movements belonging to the human motor repertoire .
evidence on motor timing abnormalities in movement disorders ( box 1 ) parkinson 's disease the notion that the mechanisms underlying time processing are abnormal in pd has been suggested by some pivotal observations .
pastor et al .
( 1992a,b ) reported that the accuracy in timing of repetitive alternating wrist movements , time estimation and time reproduction on a verbal task were impaired in pd patients " off " medication , indicating timing mechanisms abnormalities in pd already at a perceptual level and possibly related to dysfunction of an " internal clock " that is modulated by dopamine .
box 1 brief description of the selected scientific papers on time processing and motor control in parkinson 's disease , dystonia , huntington 's disease , and tourette syndrome .
condition explicit motor timing ( paced and self - paced finger tapping [ pft and s - pft ] ; repetitive wrist movements ; time reproduction tasks ) explicit perceptual timing ( time production / estimation and time discrimination tasks ) implicit motor timing ( temporal expectation tasks ; in musician 's dystonia : time analysis of performed musical scales or finger tapping performance on keyboard ) implicit perceptual timing ( temporal expectation tasks ) parkinson 's disease * reduced accuracy for both sub - second and supra - second intervals * inconsistent changes in performance variability ( increased on pft tasks , decreased with time reproduction )* inconsistent effects of dopaminergic medication on performance * reduced accuracy for suprasecond intervals ( evidence of improvement with dopaminergic medication , which needs to be replicated ) * no obvious changes * not explored huntington 's disease * reduced accuracy and increased performance variability observed more consistently for supra - second intervals , with changes observed in symptomatic and pre - symptomatic subjects ( in the latter , performance changes increase as estimated years to onset decrease ) * reduced accuracy for suprasecond intervals * not explored * not explored dystonia * no obvious changes on pft tasks * no obvious changes * in musician 's dystonia , reduced accuracy of the affected hand * variable finger tapping performance on keyboard , depending on finger affected * in writer 's cramp and cervical dystonia , reduced accuracy on temporal prediction of hand motion , but not of inanimate object motion tourette syndrome * reduced accuracy on time reproduction tasks for supra - second intervals , with performance variability influenced by dopamine d2 receptor blockers * no obvious changes * not explored * not explored afterwards , impaired time reproduction was confirmed during paced finger tapping in pd ( o'boyle et al. , 1996 ; elsinger et al. , 2003 ) and assessed in " on " and " off " conditions ( jones et al. , 2008 ) .
using the synchronization - continuation task to investigate both de novo and treated pd subjects , jones et al .
( 2011 ) showed that treated pd patients tapped ahead of the beat at the 250 ms rate , respect to de novo and healthy subjects without any difference between " off " and " on " conditions .
this observation , resembling the clinical phenomenon of festination that typically occurs in pd for fast repetitive movements , suggested an influence of either chronic pharmacological treatment or disease progression .
altogether , the continuation phase highlighted major differences likely reflecting the difficulties of pd subjects with internally generated movements .
more recently , using a modified version of the synchronization - continuation paradigm with a motor imagery task , we showed that pd patients exhibited a selective deficit in motor timing for internally triggered sequential movements separated by a supra - second interval , and that this deficit was better explained by a defect of motor planning ( avanzino et al. , 2013 ) .
bienkiewicz and craig ( 2015 ) showed that abnormalities in sensorimotor synchronization in pd are not limited to finger tapping task but rather extend in the context of a beat interception task based on aiming movements .
the type of task required prospective motor control ( i.e. , coupling movement to neural based dynamic information that helps anticipate when the beat is going to sound ) suggesting that bg circuitry might undermine also the temporal prediction ability .
overall , the motor timing abnormalities observed in pd indicate that the bg are mainly involved in explicit timing mechanisms ( see also martinu et al. , 2012 ) .
accordingly , a recent study showed that the implicit timing of salient events seems largely unaffected by pd ( de hemptinne et al. , 2013 ) .
it is worthwhile to underline that the tight interaction between difficulties with cognitive timing and spatio - temporal control of movement emerges not only from experimental findings , but also from the clinical aspects of pd. bradykinesia ( slowness of movement initiation and execution ) is particularly evident for internally generated sequential movements ( mcintosh et al. , 1997 ; heremans et al. , 2012 ) , commonly occurs in gait and can manifest as slow shuffling strides , an accelerating gait , or highly variable and random stride times ( baltadjieva et al. , 2006 ; almeida et al. , 2007 ) .
related to the neural network supporting motor timing abnormalities in pd , evidence demonstrated decreased activation within the sensorimotor cortex , cerebellum , and medial premotor system in pd patients compared to controls during paced finger tapping ( elsinger et al. , 2003 ) .
dopamine supplementation did not improve task performance , but partially " normalized " brain activation patterns .
in a pet study pd patients presented a significantly enhanced activation of the cerebellum , thalamus and substantia nigra reticulata during a synchronization - continuation task , compared to healthy subjects ( jahanshahi et al. , 2010 ) .
moreover , pallidal over - activation and cortical regions under - activation were observed in pd subjects in the " off " state , but switching to the " on " state was associated with increased striato - frontal functional connectivity .
this study and others ( husarova et al. , 2013 , 2014 ) supported the idea that motor timing networks are modulated by dopaminergic stimulation and that pd patients activate an alternative timing network relying more on cerebellar activation than healthy controls .
summarizing the behavioral and imaging evidence on the influence of dopaminergic medication on motor timing , so far results are mixed and therefore conclusions are unclear .
the role of the bg oscillatory activity in motor timing has been evidenced in a group of 12 pd patients implanted for subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation ( stn - dbs ) ( wojtecki et al. , 2011 ) .
supra - second time reproduction performance was significantly improved during " on " stimulation ( 130 - hz ) compared to no stimulation , whereas milliseconds timing was not affected .
huntington 's disease huntington 's disease ( hd ) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder , caused by an expansion of cag triplet repeats in the huntingtin gene on chromosome 4 .
the monogenic etiology of hd allowed investigating timing in both symptomatic and pre - symptomatic individuals .
explicit timing abilities progressively deteriorate in mutation carriers as they approach clinical disease onset .
early - moderate hd patients exhibited marked irregularity of tapping rates on the synchronization - continuation paradigm ( freeman et al. , 1996 ) .
in pre - symptomatic hd mutation carriers , reproduction of supra - second intervals accuracy decreases with estimated time to onset , hinton et al .
( 2007 ) and rowe et al .
( 2010 ) .
a self - paced variant of the same tapping task was also used to investigate the relationship between timing performance and disease progression .
performance on self - paced finger tapping was associated with disease progression ( michell et al. , 2008 ; tabrizi et al. , 2009 ; bechtel et al. , 2010 ) , showing high sensitivity in separating mutation carriers from non - carriers already from the earliest stages ( tabrizi et al. , 2009 ; bechtel et al. , 2010 ) .
a similar pattern of timing deterioration was observed on non - rhythmic motor reproduction of supra - second intervals , which became less precise as disease onset approached and progressed further as disease advanced ( beste et al. , 2007 ; wild - wall et al. , 2008 ; rao et al. , 2014 ) .
functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) confirmed that performance on paced finger tapping was associated with reduced neural activation in subcortical regions ( putamen , caudate , thalamus ) in pre - symptomatic hd mutation carriers closer to disease onset ( zimbelman et al. , 2007 ) .
this subgroup of pre - symptomatic patients under - activated the sma , left - anterior insula and right - inferior frontal gyrus during the finger tapping task .
conversely , those far from onset exhibited more efficient compensatory activation of other brain areas ( sensorimotor cortex , medial frontal cortex and cerebellum ) ( zimbelman et al. , 2007 ) .
overall , the progressive involvement of cortico - basal ganglia sensorimotor and associative loops in hd patients is reflected by a similarly progressive timing deficit that is more selective for explicit , cognitive - controlled timing tasks rather than implicit timing tasks .
dystonia dystonia is a network movement disorder associated with maladaptive plasticity of motor output coupled to disordered sensorimotor integration .
dysfunction in both cortico - basal ganglia and cerebello - thalamo - cortical networks is believed to give rise to the involuntary tonic and phasic muscle contractions that characterize dystonia .
timing has been assessed mainly in task - specific forms of dystonia , triggered by complex movements like musical playing or writing .
kinematic analyses of scales or finger tapping performed on a digital piano by pianists with dystonia showed inaccuracies in tone and interval duration and rhythmic inconsistency ( jabush et al. , 2004 ; furuya and altenmuller , 2013 ) .
this may represent a mere consequence of the motor overflow during musical performance , since part of these measures improved with botulinum toxin therapy ( jabush et al. , 2004 ; furuya et al. , 2014 ) .
further , explicit timing performance in these patients appeared similar to control subjects ( van der steen et al. , 2014 ) , suggesting that direct extrapolation of temporal properties while performing timed movements may be preserved in dystonia .
on the other hand , we showed that patients with either task - specific ( writer 's cramp ) ( avanzino et al. , 2013 ) or non - task - specific ( cervical ) dystonia ( martino et al. , 2015 ) are less accurate in predicting the temporal outcome of a visually perceived movement , and that this is observed for human body , but not inanimate object , motion .
this supports the view that patients with dystonia manifest subtle differences in extrapolating temporal properties during the perception of hand / arm movements .
such deficit may be linked to an abnormal internal model of motor commands reflecting dysfunction of cerebellar outflow pathways .
the selective implicit timing task abnormalities support the notion that dystonia is a broader network disorder , in which the crucial nodes are located not only in the bg and the sensorimotor cortex , but also in the cerebellum .
tourette 's syndrome tourette 's syndrome ( ts ) is associated with the abnormal maturation of cortico - basal ganglia loops .
timing abilities are underexplored in ts. in an early report , discrimination between different time intervals in untreated patients was comparable to healthy subjects ( goldstone and lhamon , 1976 ) .
more recently goudriaan et al .
( 2006 ) reported that time estimation and reproduction of time intervals spanning from 2 to 20 s did not differ between ts and healthy adults .
however , these authors measured time intervals using a manual stopwatch , which is poorly accurate .
a study by vicario et al .
( 2010 ) has documented higher accuracy in the processing of supra - second intervals in ts children with lower tic severity , compared to age - matched healthy volunteers ( vicario et al. , 2010 ) .
this result was explained by suggesting the existence of an effective compensatory modulation phenomenon , in correspondence of the prefrontal cortex , leading to better tic inhibition and increased precision in explicit processing of supra - second time intervals .
dopaminergic modulation seems also relevant to temporal discrimination in ts patients , as dopamine receptor blockers like pimozide may improve patients' variability on this task ( vicario et al. , 2016 ) .
overall , ts has been investigated mainly for perceptual aspects of timing , revealing greater accuracy of temporal discrimination of supra - second intervals associated with lower tic severity .
as already suggested for other behavioral abnormalities in ts ( mueller et al. , 2006 ; jackson et al. , 2007 ) , this behavioral gain appears to be more linked to adaptive mechanisms facilitating tic suppression rather than to core pathogenic mechanisms .
translational aspects in rehabilitation strategies knowledge on abnormalities in time processing for motor control has been already applied to plan rehabilitative strategies in movement disorders .
for pd , rehabilitation approaches to compensate defective internal rhythm generation by the bg have been designed .
rhythm - related interventions ( such as external sensory cueing or music ) have been extensively used in motor rehabilitation .
most studies showed that gait impairment in pd could be significantly improved by rhythmic ( auditory ) stimulation ( lim et al. , 2005 , 2010 ) or musically cued gait training ( benoit et al. , 2014 ) .
rhythmic external cueing was also found to improve upper limb movements of pd patients ( vercruysse et al. , 2012 ) , and even assist motor learning ( nieuwboer et al. , 2009 ) .
however , synchronization with a fixed - tempo may be critical in pd subjects ( bienkiewicz and craig , 2015 ; young et al. , 2016 ) and the effect may be very limited in time since learning may be specific to cued rather than non - cued performance .
thus , novel strategies have been recently proposed involving interactive systems providing adaptive rhythmic stimulations ( hove and keller , 2015 ) video ( pelosin et al. , 2013 ) or mirror visual feedback training ( bonassi et al. , 2016 ) .
the motor timing abnormalities observed in hyperkinetic disorders might have a role in disease monitoring ( hd ) , development of novel rehabilitative strategies ( dystonia ) , or monitoring of existing interventions ( tic disorders ) .
self - paced finger tapping and time reproduction of supra - second intervals have proved to be sensitive sub - clinical markers of disease progression in hd , and their application to experimental trials of disease - modifying treatments is potentially very rewarding .
several experimental approaches aimed to promote the re - organization of sensory - motor regions to improve motor control and symptoms of dystonia ( avanzino et al. , 2015b ) .
available information in dystonia shows reduced accuracy in extrapolating temporal properties during the perception of body movements .
sensory - motor integration is central to new physiological models of motor control , whereby motor outflow generated by the primary motor cortex is associated with the generation of efferent copies that allow anticipating the sensory consequences of the motor program ( perruchoud et al. , 2014 ) .
this anticipatory ability could be crucial to motor performance , and could be influenced also by perceptual experiences of internal and external movements .
within this theoretical framework , temporal expectations tasks applied to external or internal movements might be exploited as rehabilitative strategies to improve the ability to anticipate " on - line " the sensory consequences of motor output in dystonia .
finally , cognitive control over tics is an important component of behavioral treatment strategies ( piacentini et al. , 2010 ; van de griendt et al. , 2013 ) .
predictors of response to behavioral treatments for tics are still uncertain , and performance on tasks assessing cognitive control of motor actions may represent a useful predictive marker .
interestingly , preliminary studies of time processing in ts suggest a possible link between cognitively controlled tasks and timing , indicating that time processing tasks might be considered in future studies on cognitive predictors of response to behavioral treatment ( jung et al. , 2013 ; vicario et al. , 2013 ) .

several studies have shown remarkable temporal distribution of these mortality figures , with a disproportionately higher number of patients dying within the first few months of commencing haart .
purpose of the study to identify the aetiologies and factors associated with the deaths of hiv - infected persons enrolled into the hiv care program at our hospital .
methods the study setting is a 230 - bed hospital located in the north eastern region of nigeria , with hiv prevalence of 5.2 % .
hiv services are supported by management sciences for health through usaid .
a cross sectional study was conducted .
the case files of all recorded deaths were retrieved from the medical records department and information on age , sex , date of enrolment , date of commencement of anti - retroviral drugs , duration of haart , w.h.o clinical stage , cd4 cell count and aetiologies / factors associated with the mortalities were extracted and analyzed .
summary of results a total of 1510 hiv positive patients were enrolled in our centre ( 63 % f , 47 % m ) with 758 on haart .
80 patients ( 5.2 %) had died as at the time of the review .
63 % of mortality cases were in patients < 40yrs old and 82 % presented with who stage 3 or 4 disease .
the aetiology of death was tb in 40 % , suspected tb in 16.25 % , hiv wasting syndrome in 8.75 % , septic abortion in 1.25 % and hbv in 1.25 % .
in 30 % of the cases however , the cause was not ascertained before death .
52 % of mortality cases occurred before haart commencement , 35 % occurred within the first 3 months of haart initiation .
60 % of deaths occurred in patients with cd4 + t - cell counts < 200cells / ul conclusions advanced hiv disease , severe immunodeficiency , tb co - morbidity and possibly delay in starting haart were found to be associated with increased mortality in our centre .
thus , strategies to reduce mortality must include earlier diagnosis of hiv infection and timely initiation of haart .

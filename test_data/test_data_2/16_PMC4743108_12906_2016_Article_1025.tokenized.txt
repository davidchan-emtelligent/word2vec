background integrative medicine ( im ) provides patient - centered care and addresses the full range of physical , emotional , mental , social , spiritual , and environmental influences that affect a person 's health .
im is a " whole systems " approach that employs multiple modalities as opposed to an isolated complementary therapy .
thus , studying outcomes of im is more challenging than evaluating an isolated intervention .
practice - based research networks ( pbrns ) allow for clinicians / investigators at multiple diverse sites using common methodology to pool their data , increase participant sample size and increase generalizability of results .
to conduct real - world , practice - based research , the bravewell collaborative founded bravenet in 2007 as the first national integrative medicine pbrn .
methods and design patients receiving integrative medicine effectiveness registry ( primier ) is a prospective , non - randomized , observational evaluation conducted at fourteen clinical sites .
participants receive a non - standardized , personalized , multimodal im approach for various medical conditions .
using the redcap electronic platform , an anticipated 10,000 study participants will complete patient - reported outcome measures including patient reported outcomes measurement information system ( promis ) - 29 , perceived stress scale - 4 , and the patient activation measure at baseline , 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 , 18 and 24 months .
extractions from participants' electronic health records include im services received , as well as icd diagnostic codes , and cpt billing codes associated with each im visit .
repeated - measures analyses will be performed on data to assess change from baseline through 24 months with planned subgroup analyses to include specific clinical population and specific im intervention or combinations .
discussion as the primier registry grows , we anticipate that our results would provide an indication of the promise of pbrn research efforts in im. analyses will incorporate a large sample of participants and an expected 10 - year observation period and will provide the ability to evaluate the effect of im on outcomes for specific clinical populations and specific im interventions or combinations .
as such , primier will serve as a national platform for future evaluations of im best practices .

employing a personalized strategy that considers the patient 's unique conditions , needs , and circumstances , im uses the most appropriate interventions from an array of scientific disciplines to heal illness and help people regain and maintain optimal health [ 1 ] .
because im is a " whole systems " approach that employs multiple modalities in concert as opposed to an isolated complementary therapy , studying outcomes is more challenging than evaluating an isolated pharmaceutical or botanical intervention [ 2 ] .
" patient - reported outcome " ( pro ) measures are health data provided directly by patients , rather than outcomes that reflect the assessment of an investigator or clinician , as typically seen in clinical research .
a pro is an individual patient 's self - reported assessment of their feelings or functions as they are dealing with diseases or conditions , and this assessment has important implications both in clinical practice and in research .
pro data are especially important in evaluating the effectiveness of health care for chronic conditions , where a primary goal of treatment is to improve patients' function and to reduce symptoms associated with the condition [ 3 , 4 ] .
criticisms of the use of pros in clinical research have been the wide range of instruments used , often to measure similar outcomes , and the lack of standardization between outcome measures [ 4 ] .
the recent development [ 5 ] of the nih - funded patient - reported outcomes measurement information system ( promis ) suite of item banks and short forms for assessing health outcome domains related to quality of life and chronic conditions has been cited by researchers as a viable solution to these concerns [ 4 , 6 ] .
single - site studies in im are generally too small to identify differences in outcomes across sociodemographic or clinical subgroups .
multi - institutional scientific networks are able to recruit large numbers of participants for observational and interventional trials .
practice - based research networks ( pbrns ) allow for clinicians / investigators at multiple diverse sites using common methodology and a single coordinating / data analysis center to pool their data as well as increase generalizability of results. by collecting data in the context of patients receiving their clinical care , the results are more reflective of " real world " outcomes .
given the growth of the number of clinics providing im [ 7 ] and the resulting need for these clinics to conduct real - world , practice - based research , the bravewell collaborative founded bravenet in 2007 as the first national im pbrn .
bravenet , a registered pbrn with the agency for healthcare research and quality ( ahrq ) , was established with the intent that it would provide data on im 's use , effectiveness , safety , costs , and patient satisfaction .
as of early 2015 , bravenet consists of 14 im clinics that have robust patient populations as well as strong research capabilities .
in this description of our study protocol , we describe the approach taken to conduct a multi - site prospective observational cohort study of pros in our network of im clinics .
the patients receiving integrative medicine interventions effectiveness registry ( primier ) provides an opportunity to better understand which im interventions patients are receiving , and how these interventions impact both clinical measures and pros , such as quality of life .
because randomized controlled trials can only examine one or two specific interventions for a narrowly defined condition - - and because im often uses highly individualized combinations of interventions to treat multiple conditions simultaneously - - the evidence base to support clinical decision making in im is not progressing rapidly enough to address the widespread use of this approach in our health care system [ 8 ] .
there have been a few attempts to conduct randomized trials of im interventions .
however , these have been limited by : small sample size and inadequate power [ 9 ] ; generalizability and resource intensiveness [ 10 ] ; and retention challenges potentially related to participant dissatisfaction with being randomized to the non - im arm , as well as limited follow - up [ 11 ] .
methods overview in 2013 , bravenet created and launched primier ( patients receiving integrative medicine interventions effectiveness registry ) , a multi - institutional project designed to uniformly collect pros and extract electronic health record ( ehr ) data into a large national registry .
the goal of primier is to provide a framework that can be used for evidence - based practice , discernment of best practices of im , and quality improvement .
primier is listed in the registry of registries ( ropr id : 40 ) , which is maintained by ahrq and clinicaltrials.gov ( nct01754038 ) .
the intent is that primier will continue to expand over time , including more publicly - funded as well as private im centers with ever increasing data which could be used for the mentioned objectives .
at present , primier is 2 years into an anticipated 10 - year study timeframe .
active enrolling sites are expected to grow significantly beyond the present 14 recruiting centers .
research setting and eligibility criteria as of june 30 , 2015 , the bravenet pbrn includes the 14 member sites listed in table 1 as well as the bravenet data and statistical coordinating center .
most of our sites are specialty care , integrative medicine clinics , although an increasing number of member clinics have primary care capacities .
the study is open to any patient age 18 or over who is seen by a provider for clinical purposes at any of the sites .
study participants must be willing and able to provide informed consent , to participate , and to be contacted in the future by study personnel .
patients who are involved only in an education program or one - time activity are excluded from participation .

in addition , the einstein human research protection program and duke university health systems institutional review board approved the study as the bravenet data and statistical coordinating center .
the study is registered in clinical trials.gov ( nct01754038 ) .
screening procedures and enrollment potential participants receive primier enrollment information either from clinic or research staff .
patients who decide to participate in primier log onto the primier website and electronically enroll directly into the registry .
online registrants are able to provide informed consent upon opening the first screen on their initial visit to the website .
if they do not have computer access or are uncomfortable with technology , patients may provide informed consent and complete the survey questionnaire by pen and paper .
following enrollment in primier , pro measures are obtained at 2 - month intervals for the first 6 months , then every 6 months through the end of year two .
this information is combined with data extracted from the participants' ehr .
we anticipate approximately 10,000 participants to be enrolled in primier .
data collection primier currently uses the research electronic data capture ( redcap ) system as an online research management tool to collect patient reported data .
redcap is a secure , web - based application designed exclusively to support data capture for research studies [ 12 ] .
redcap , which was initiated with funding from the national institutes of health , allows researchers to create study - specific websites for capturing participant data securely through an intuitive interface for users to enter data and have real time validation rules ( with automated data type and range checks ) at the time of entry .
redcap further allows automated data export procedures for seamless data downloads to excel , spss , sas , and stata .
developed by vanderbilt university , redcap currently supports 994 academic / non - profit consortium partners and over 100,000 research end - users ( http :// project - redcap.org ). from august 2013 to may 2015 , primier patient surveys were collected using the patient reported outcomes measurement information system ( promis ) assessment center at northwestern university .
the database was changed to redcap in may 2015 to give the bravenet coordinating center ( albert einstein college of medicine ) the ability to modify the survey and create one registry database instead of maintaining individual site databases as had been necessary with the assessment center platform .
data collection schedule with the exception of the tobacco and alcohol use questionnaires and ehr data , all other data measures are collected seven times : at baseline and at two , four , six , 12 , 18 , and 24 months .
tobacco and alcohol use are asked at baseline , 12 , and 24 months , and medical record data are pulled at baseline and every 6 months .
see table 2 for the schedule of data collection , and the following demographics , outcome measures , and utilization / intervention data sections for more detail .

lifestyle behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco use , nutrition and exercise habits , and use of opioid medication are also asked of all participants .
these questions , shown in the additional file 1 , are not scored and will be treated categorically in data analyses .
patient - reported outcome measures primier uses the promis - 29 instrument as the core pro measure along with the perceived stress scale - 4 ( pss - 4 ) [ 13 ] and the patient activation measure ( pam ) [ 14 ] .
created with funding from the national institutes of health , the promis suite of pro instruments provides clinicians and researchers access to efficient , valid , and responsive self - reported measures of health , including symptoms , function , and well - being .
the promis - 29 instrument includes four - item short forms covering seven distinct domains including physical function , anxiety , depression , fatigue , pain intensity and pain interference , satisfaction with social role , as well as sleep disturbance .
questions are answered using standard one through five likert scales .
the promis - 29 has been validated as performing as well as a variety of legacy pro measures [ 15 ] , and the four - item subscales for depression and anxiety have been found to have good internal reliability among chronic pain patients [ 16 ] .
a crosswalk has been developed and validated between promis pain interference and the pain interference subscale of the brief pain inventory [ 17 ] , and between the promis fatigue short form and the modified fatigue impact scale [ 18 ] .
promis depression has also been cross - walked with several common depression measures ( e.g. , beck depression inventory - ii and center for epidemiologic study - depression ) [ 19 ] .
in addition to the promis - 29 , we include one promis question to assess global quality of life .
the perceived stress scale - 4 ( pss - 4 ) is a brief , validated , and widely used psychological instrument for assessing a participant 's perception of stress level .
based on an original 14 - item scale [ 20 ] , the pss - 4 consists of four questions to measure the degree to which participants perceive situations in their lives as stressful [ 13 ] .
it includes questions related to perceived unpredictability , uncontrollability , and overload .
this short version is recommended for a brief assessment when respondent time is limited .
participants choose responses ranging from never ( 0 ) to very often ( 4 ) with a total score ranging from 0 to 16 .
a recent study on the pss - 4 reconfirms its reliability [ 21 ] .
the patient activation measure ( pam ) is a brief , validated instrument for gauging the knowledge , skills and confidence essential to managing one 's own health and healthcare [ 14 ] .
the 13 - item pam assessment ( a short form of the original 22 - item instrument ) [ 22 ] divides participants into one of four progressively higher activation levels .
each level addresses a broad array of self - care behaviors and offers insight into the characteristics that drive health activation [ 22 ] .
positive changes in activation have been associated with positive changes in a variety of self - management behaviors [ 23 ] .
improvement in patient activation has been shown to be strongly related to improvements in clinical outcomes such as decreased pain , increased utilization of prevention screenings , and a reduction in emergency room visits [ 23 ] .
the four levels are defined as : level 1 - does not believe that he / she has an active or important role ; level 2 - lacks confidence and knowledge to take action ; level 3 - beginning to take action ; and level 4 - maintaining behavior over time .
the pam has been used in several studies of im interventions [ 24 - 26 ] .
utilization / intervention data in addition to providing pro measures , participants report the primary condition ( s ) or symptom ( s ) for which they are receiving treatment and the type of im practitioner from whom they are receiving care based on questions from the national health interview survey .
at each data collection point , patients are asked to rate or describe their change in symptoms , etc .
since beginning care at the im clinic [ 27 ] .
patients report whether they are experiencing chronic pain , defined as 4 or greater on an 11 - point visual analog scale .
primier also collects information on what im interventions patients have utilized in the past 6 months .
utilization of im treatments is captured through two methods : 1 ) as reported by the study participants using patient visit questionnaires ; and 2 ) as reported by the sites through an electronic or paper medical record extraction process .
each site abstracts the following data points from their participant 's electronic medical and administrative records : dates of all appointments to the im clinic , im services received , diagnostic codes ( international classification of diseases - 9 : icd - 9 ) associated with each im visit , and billing codes ( current procedural terminology : cpt ) associated with each visit .
these data are encrypted and sent electronically to the bravenet data coordinating center .
additional data fields will be added from patient visits to any clinic ( i.e. , not limited to im clinic visits ) as relevant to specific studies of interest , for example , height , weight , pain , and lipid panels .
data analyses general statistical considerations all subjects who complete baseline measurements , >= 1 follow - up visit at a bravenet clinic , and who are followed for at least 6 months in the study will be included in statistical analyses .
counts and percentages will be reported on categorical variables whereas continuous variables will be expressed as means and standard deviations ( sds ) and / or medians ( 25th and 75th percentiles ) .
the wilcoxon rank - sum test or chi - square test ( fisher 's exact as appropriate ) will be used to quantify comparisons as deemed necessary .
future data analysis in observational studies like primier , there is no treatment randomization .
therefore , to minimize the effects of potential stable moderators ( e.g. , sex ) , channeling bias , and / or time - varying confounders , a marginal structural model ( msm ) approach will be utilized to analyze the final primier database .
an msm analysis is a weighted repeated measures approach using im modality as a time - varying covariate as well as accounting for baseline characteristics .
weights produce a pseudo - population with a balance in both time - invariant and time - varying covariates , allowing for causal treatment comparisons using standard repeated measures models .
the weighting will also be adjusted to account for missing data , providing validity under missing at random or missing completely at random .
in order to incorporate adjustment for patients with missing visits , the same weight approach is used .
however , instead of using a flag to designate im modality , a flag denoting whether the patient remained in the study is used .
the final weight for each patient 's observation is computed by multiplying the im modality selection weights and the censoring weights .
there are four major components which need to be computed / assessed to perform a msm analysis : 1 ) weight estimates for each subject visit adjusting for im modality , 2 ) weight estimates for each subject visit adjusting for study discontinuation , 3 ) an a priori chosen vector of time - independent variables , such as baseline characteristics , 4 ) an a priori chosen im modality or set of im modalities which will be assigned as the " treatment of interest " and tracked throughout time .
adjusted mean outcomes by study time as well as resulting f - test p - values will be reported by outcome measure .
as our sample size increases and the proportion of those completing long term follow - up assessments grows , we will be able to evaluate the impact of im on pain scores in subgroups including but not limited to : sex , bmi < 30 vs bmi >= 30 , and < 40 on the promis depression subscale vs >= 40 on promis depression subscale .
the potential of the varying impacts of im on subgroups will be assessed by including interaction terms , i.e. , subgroup by im , in the msm model .
in the case that the interaction terms are statistically significant , separate msm analyses will be performed within each subgroup .
also , the weight estimates for each subject visit will be computed adjusting for dose of modality or modalities of interest ( e.g. , acupuncture or im physician visit ) instead of im modality in the msm analysis .
accounting for modality dosing by visit over the course of the study may potentially create more robust weight estimates for each subject by providing more information than just a binary response variable .
sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of retention rate will be performed on pre - specified subgroups of subjects who completed : 75 % of surveys over the study period 50 % of surveys over the study period 25 % of surveys over the study period all analyses will be conducted using sas ( cary , nc ) .
discussion the bravenet pbrn has the potential to provide valuable information regarding the benefits of im in real world settings .
the primier project is already demonstrating changes in pro measures in participants receiving care at our collaborating clinical sites .
at this early stage , the initial primier cohort contributing a full 6 months of data is not large enough to accurately assess which interventions or which combination of interventions have had the greatest effect on pam scores , depression and stress scores , or other pros .
nor is there yet the ability to discern which im interventions are most effective at improving symptoms in specific clinical populations receiving care at the bravenet clinics .
however , as participation and the retention rate increase , we will be able to refine our analysis and further examine which modalities or combinations thereof are most effective .
for example , we will be able to address the question of which im approaches are most effective in treating pain , which is by far the most common reason that patients seek care at our clinics [ 28 - 30 ] .
moreover , what is the optimal dosing of acupuncture for specific cancer conditions or does elevated depressive symptomology influence the effectiveness of mind / body interventions in patients with physical ailments ?
as the primier database grows and with increased demographic diversity provided by additional future sites , bravenet is well - poised to address some of the important questions that remain unanswered in the field .
the goal of primier is to create a registry of sufficient size so that we can explore subsequent hypotheses .
for example , we may hypothesize that pain patients who receive acupuncture weekly for 8 weeks would have significantly improved outcomes on the promis - 29 measures at 12 months than pain patients who receive acupuncture less frequently than weekly .
another example of a hypothesis to be tested would compare the cohort of patients with baseline elevated depressive symptomology (< 40 on the promis depression subscale ) vs non - depressive symptomology (> 40 on promis depression ) on patient activation measure at 12 months. from our prior mapping study of im in the united states [ 31 ] , and from a bravenet registry study [ 28 - 30 ] , we learned that im center leaders across the country perceived that their interventions were most useful in patients with complaints of chronic pain , depression , and stress .
in a different study of patients with a chief complaint of chronic pain seen at the bravenet sites , we previously reported that an im approach to pain not only decreased pain , but depressive symptomology and stress as well [ 29 ] .
both of these studies were limited by virtue of either one - time only assessment [ 28 - 30 ] or small sample size [ 29 ]. from a more mature primier dataset , we should be able to ascertain which particular treatment modalities offer the greatest reduction in pain , as well as changes on measures of depressive symptomology and stress as examples .
the primier project offers a unique opportunity to assess the effectiveness of im clinic intervention in a wide variety of clinical conditions .
as the dataset grows and the duration of follow - up increases , we expect to be able to derive preliminary information to develop specific research proposals to address the difficult - to - treat conditions for which patients seek our care .
given the rapid increase in the number of clinical settings offering im services , the public is continuing to seek out these therapies to augment and integrate with conventional medical practices .
while randomized controlled trials assess the efficacy of specific interventions for specific patient populations in " controlled settings " , observational studies evaluate the effectiveness of treatments in the real world of clinical practice .
the highly individualized nature of im interventions also can make the randomized controlled trials model problematic , since treatments often evolve over time as a function of a given individual 's response to treatment .
although there is now a growing body of randomized controlled trial research on the efficacy of integrative medicine approaches for a variety of conditions [ 32 - 38 ] , in many ways this body of research does not accurately describe the real world practice of im because of the controlled nature of the clinical trial paradigm .
in contrast , observational research designs , despite some inherent limitations , present a promising option .
bell et al. suggest that observational designs are appropriate for studying complex interventions , despite the absence of randomization [ 2 ] .
treatment approaches consisting of multiple modalities or components present unique challenges .
in their 2014 protocol of an im primary care trial , herman and colleagues provide a useful overview of how truly integrative approaches to care ( as opposed to single - modality offerings ) can be described as complex interventions [ 39 , 40 ] .
these complex interventions present challenges of " unpacking " , due to the wide range of potential treatment combinations and patient diagnoses [ 39 ] .
currently , we do not know what the makeup of the population for primier will be ( i.e. , what conditions and comorbidities patients will have and what combinations of therapies they might receive ) .
for example , as in the registry study [ 28 ] , we may see a higher proportion of patients with pain as compared with other symptoms .
because our initial goal is to establish a registry from which to conduct subsequent research , a key feature of the project is that we are not driving the interventions or the population characteristics ; rather , that makeup is clinically driven .
therefore , our work is subject to some limitations , from the standpoint of conventional health outcomes research .
authors of other multimodal studies have cited limitations such as the inability to determine the relative efficacy of components in a multifaceted study or intervention , [ 11 , 39 ] noting that the most beneficial elements of a intervention may vary from patient to patient depending on individual needs and personal characteristics [ 41 ] .
bell argues that treatments that combine modalities ( conventional and / or complementary ) should be studied in combination as well [ 2 ] .
herman notes that larger effect sizes may be achieved in more controlled settings [ 39 ] ; however , this is a tradeoff for studying a heterogeneous patient population receiving individualized , sometimes complex care .
maiers et al. acknowledge the limited generalizability of an integrative care plan for low back pain , while also pointing out how the adaptability of integrative care models can make them more generalizable in some respects [ 10 ] .
while data from individual primier sites may be similarly limited in their generalizability , the inclusion of sites and patient populations from around the country will provide a larger and more diverse sample than comparable studies to date .
although we recognize the importance of including economic analyses in studies of im , not all of the medical costs for enrolled patients' care will be available to the extracts from our electronic health record ( e.g. , if a patient received care at an emergency department outside the study site health system ) .
every effort will be made to conduct appropriate health economic analyses with primier , but this is an important limitation .
any other limitations in our analyses will be discussed in future reporting of the study results .
notwithstanding , observational research using pros will uniquely enable us to describe the results of this type of individualized and dynamic care [ 42 ] .
the exploration of im in real - world settings is consistent with the strategic plan of the national institutes of health , national center for complementary and integrative health ( formerly the national center for complementary and alternative medicine ) .
specifically , by seeking to " increase understanding of ' real world ' patterns and outcomes of [ complementary and alternative medicine ] use and its integration into health care and health promotion " , [ 43 ] primier will serve as a national platform for future evaluations of im best practices .
in providing the means to begin determining these best practices , the bravenet pbrn will be able to define the most effective im interventions in a timely fashion , making valuable information readily available that will help guide patients , providers , and payors to improve health and well - being for all .

ppars are nuclear receptors activated by ligands .
activation of ppargamma leads to a reduction of adhesion and motility in some cancer models .
ppargamma transcriptional activity can be negatively regulated by jnk - mediated phosphorylation .
we postulated that the use of agents able to inhibit jnk activity could increase the effectiveness of ppargamma ligands .
we analysed the effects of rosiglitazone ( ppargamma ligand ) and as601245 ( a selective jnk inhibitor ) alone or in association on adhesion and migration of caco - 2 , ht29 , and sw480 human colon cancer cells and investigated , through microarray analysis , the genes involved in these processes .
cell adhesion and migration was strongly inhibited by rosiglitazone and as601245 .
combined treatment with the two compounds resulted in a greater reduction of the adhesion and migration capacity .
affymetrix analysis in caco - 2 cells revealed that some genes which were highly modulated by the combined treatment could be involved in these biological responses .
rosiglitazone , as601245 and combined treatment down - regulated the expression of fibrinogen chains in all three cell lines .
moreover , rosiglitazone , alone or in association with as601245 , caused a decrease in the fibrinogen release .
arhgef7 / beta - pix gene was highly down - regulated by combined treatment , and western blot analysis revealed that beta - pix protein is down - modulated in caco - 2 , ht29 and sw480 cells , also .
transfection of cells with beta - pix gene completely abrogated the inhibitory effect on cell migration , determined by rosiglitazone , as601245 and combined treatment .
results demonstrated that beta - pix protein is involved in the inhibition of cell migration and sustaining the positive interaction between ppargamma ligands and anti - inflammatory agents in humans .
introduction ppargamma belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily consisting of a group of approximately 50 transcription factors involved in many different biological processes and considered as important targets in the development of new drugs [ 1 ] .
the ppargamma activation by agonists regulates lipid storage in adypocytes [ 2 ] , inhibits proliferation and induces differentiation and apoptosis in a number of cancer cells [ 3 ] .
thus , the ppargamma ligands have been considered as potential drugs for different types of cancer .
endogenous ppargamma ligands include unsaturated fatty acids and several prostanoids such as 15 - deoxy - prostaglandin j2 ( 15d - pgj2 ) and 15 - hydroxy - eicosatetranoic acid ( hete ) , which are metabolites of arachidonic acid [ 4 ] .
synthetic ligands comprise the insulin - sensitizing thiazolindinedione ( tzd ) class ( troglitazone , pioglitazone and rosiglitazone ) that are used to treat diabetes mellitus [ 5 ] - [ 6 ] and several non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) , in particular indomethacin and ibuprofen , that are weak ppargamma agonists at high micromolar concentrations [ 7 ] .
the sensitivity of the different cell types to ppargamma ligands mostly depends on the ppargamma expression and activity .
high levels of ppargamma expression have been reported in adipose and colon tissues .
the latter is the major tissue expressing ppargamma in epithelial tissues [ 1 ] .
despite this observation , the number of studies investigating ppargamma in human subjects with colon cancer is limited .
in specimens from colon cancer patients , immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a correlation between ppargamma and cell cycle - related molecules but no association was detected between ppargamma and patient survival [ 8 ] .
more recently , ogino and collaborators demonstrated , in colorectal cancer patients , that the expression of ppargamma is associated with a good prognosis [ 9 ] , in accordance with the previous data reported by jackson and collaborators [ 10 ] , which demonstrated that ppargamma ( mrna and protein ) expression levels were significantly depressed in colorectal cancer cells compared with matched non - malignant tissue .
in animal studies , a deficiency in intestinal ppargamma was associated with enhanced tumorigenicity in small intestine and colon of apcmin /+ mice [ 11 ] .
similarly , in mouse models of colon cancer , ppargamma agonists inhibited tumor growth or colon carcinogenesis [ 12 ] - [ 14 ] .
these data support the hypothesis that ppargamma ligands may inhibit colorectal tumour progression and may be an important therapeutic target .

values are detected by measuring the luminescence released by the metabolically active cells .
the values , expressed in rlus are the means s.d. of three separate experiments .
one of the most important aspects in cancer progression , is the acquisition of invasive behaviour , a multi - stage process which involves cancer cells adhesion to the vassel endothelium and the motility through the extracellular matrix .
it has been demonstrated that ppargamma agonists affect these parameters not only in the control of cell inflammation [ 15 ] but also in several types of cancer cells [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
besides ligand binding , ppargamma genomic activity can be modulated by various cellular processes .
indeed , mitogenic hormones , growth factors and pro - inflammatory signals are all known to reduce the ability of ppargamma to respond to ligand stimulation .
the mechanisms that control this down regulation are complex and comprise phosphorylation [ 18 ] , ubiquitination [ 19 ] , sumoylation [ 20 ] and cytoplasmic shuttling [ 21 ] .
a key down - regulating mechanism involves phosphorylation by various mitogen activated kinases ( mapks ) , which are central signalling components in the regulation of cell proliferation , differentiation survival , stress response and apoptosis [ 22 ] .
in particular , it has been reported that c - jun - terminal kinase ( jnk ) phosphorylates ppargamma and negatively regulates its transcriptional activity [ 23 ] .
on the basis of these observations we postulated that the use of agents able to inhibit jnk activity could increase the effectiveness of ppargamma ligands .
as601245 [ 1,3 - benzothiazol - 2 - yl - ( 2 - {[ 2 - ( 3 - pyridinyl ) ethyl ] amino } - 4 - pyrimidinyl ) acetonitrile ; jnk inhibitor v ] has been selected as a potent and selective jnk inhibitor with anti - inflammatory properties [ 24 ] , and has been used in the present work to assess its involvement with anti - carcinogenic effects displayed by rosiglitazone in colon cancer cells .
in particular , we examined the effects of rosiglitazone and as601245 , alone or in association , on adhesion and migration of human colon cancer cells , and investigated the genes involved in the these processes , through microarray analysis ( affimetryx genechip ) .

realtime rt - pcr to confirm the affymetrix results , we selected 5 genes that had shown a > 2 - fold change in expression for further study by real time pcr in a separate experiment .
two of these ( ganab and mt2a ) were found to be increased in affymetrix analysis , whereas the others two were found to be decreased ( fga and fgfr2 ) .
finally , one gene ( arhgef7 ) was found to be highly decreased in combined treatment , only .
moreover , we analysed the expression of the three chains of fibrinogen in caco - 2 , ht29 and sw480 cells .
cells were treated with 1 % dmso as the vehicle or with 50 microm rosiglitazone , 0.1 microm as601245 , or rosiglitazone plus as601245 for 24 hours ; total rna from 3 biological replicates of each treatment was isolated using trizol reagent ( invitrogen , milano , italy ) , then total rna was quantified with a nanodrop ( thermo scientific ) spectrophotometer to measure rna concentration and analyzed on an agilent 2100 bioanalyser to monitor rna quality and integrity .
total rna was reverse transcribed into cdna in a 20 microl reaction using the taqman ( r ) high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit provided by applied biosystems .
500 ng of total rna was used as the starting material from each sample .
for each realtime pcr reaction , the reverse transcribed sample was used as a template .
to test assay linearity , a cdna pool was first serially diluted .
reactions were carried out in the presence of the commercial taqman ( r ) gene expression assays and a 1x concentration of the taqman ( r ) universal pcr master mix ( applied biosystems ) .
target mrna was quantified using an abi 7900 ht fast realtime pcr system ( applied biosystems ) .
primers were purchased from applied biosystems : ganab ( glucosidase , alpha ; neutral ab , hs00929274 _ m1 ) , mt2a ( metallothionein 2a , hs02379661 _ g1 ) , fga ( fibrinogen alpha chain , hs00241027 _ m1 ) , fgb ( fibrinogen beta chain hs00905942 _ m1 ) fgg ( fibrinogen gamma chain hs00241037 _ m1 ) fgfr2 ( fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 , hs01552926 _ m1 ) and arhgef7 ( rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( gef ) 7 , hs00388776 _ m1 ) .
the taqman probes were labelled with a 5 ' reporter dye ( fam , 6 - carboxyfluorescein ) and a 3 ' quencher dye ( tamra , 6 - carboxytetramethylrhodamine ) .
realtime pcr reactions were carried out in triplicate in microamp optical 384 - well plates in a total volume of 10 microl / well .
data were analyzed by the abi sequence detection system ( sds ) software using the relative quantification .
the fold changes are determined by the deltadeltact method as described in applied biosystems user bulletin no .
2. briefly , the level of each target mrna was normalized to the level of the 18s ribosomal rna ( housekeeping gene ) in order to obtain the deltact and then the deltadeltact was calculated against the dmso treatment .

results are expressed as fold change versus dmso - treated control cells .
results rosiglitazone and as601245 affect cell proliferation preliminary experiments demonstrated that cell proliferation was affected by rosiglitazone and by as601245 until 96 hours , in a concentration - dependent way in all three lines of colon cancer cells tested ( fig. 1 ) .
however , the drug doses effective in inhibiting cell proliferation by 50 % ( ic50 ) were rather high .
in caco - 2 cells , ic50 was 150 +/ - 25 microm for rosiglitazone and 2.5 +/ - 1 microm for as601245 .
the doses able to reduce cell proliferation by 20 % ( ic20 ) were : 50 microm +/ - 12 for rosiglitazone and 0.1 microm +/ - 0.1 for as601245 .
ic50 and ic20 doses were very similar in all three cell lines tested .
the ic20 doses of rosiglitazone and as601245 , defined in caco - 2 cells , were then used for the microarray experiments in this cell line .

results are expressed as fold change versus dmso - treated control cells .
n.d. : not detectable .
cell adhesion and migration after rosiglitazone and as601245 treatments in the adhesion assay , performed after 24 hours from the start of treatment , the addition of 50 microm rosiglitazone alone resulted in a reduction of cell adhesion to huvec by about 55 % in caco - 2 cells and by 58 % and 59 % in ht29 and sw480 cells , respectively ( fig. 2 ) .
the level of inhibition was gradually reduced by treating the cells with lower doses of rosiglitazone .
in a first set of experiments , cell adhesion capacity was assayed in hct116 cells , also .
in this cell line , cell adhesion was inhibited by 71 % after treatment with 50 microm rosiglitazone and by 59 % after treatment with 10 microm rosiglitazone ( data not shown ) .
the treatment with 50 microm as60124 reduced the adhesion by about 55 , 72 and 60 % in caco - 2 , ht29 and sw480 cells , respectively .
the percentage of inhibition was gradually reduced by treating the cells with lower doses of as601245 and the treatment with 0.1 microm as601245 did not significantly affect this parameter .
to verify whether the combined treatment of rosiglitazone and as601245 could have an additive effect in inhibiting cell adhesion , 0.1 microm as601245 was associated with increasing doses of rosiglitazone .
in all three cell lines the combination of 0.1 microm rosiglitazone with 0.1 microm as601245 showed an additive effect in reducing cell adhesion .
the combined treatment of 0.1 microm as601245 with the higher doses of rosiglitazone increased the effect of rosiglitazone alone reaching the maximum level of inhibition .
all three types of cells showed a similar response to the treatments .

control cells and transfected cells were plated onto the apical side of matrigel - coated filters in serum - free medium supplemented with drugs at different concentrations ( 10 , 50 microm rosiglitazone ; 0.1 , 1 , 10 , 50 microm as601245 ) and with the association of different drug concentrations for 24 hours .
chemoattractant utilized was 20 % fcs supplemented medium , placed in the basolateral chamber .
the cells migrated to the bottom of the filters were stained using crystalviolet and counted ( 5 fields of each triplicate filters ) using an inverted microscope .
control migration was 45 +/ - 8 , 51 +/ - 8 and 33 +/ - 4 cells / microscope field for caco - 2 , ht29 , sw480 cells , respectively , and 49 +/ - 5 , 50 +/ - 6 and 30 +/ - 6 cells / microscope field for caco - 2 , ht29 and sw480 cells , respectively , after transfection with beta - pix carrying plasmide and empty plasmide .
data are expressed as mean +/ - sem ( n = 5 ) of the percentage of inhibition versus the control migration .
migration was examined in caco - 2 , ht29 , and sw480 cell lines .
the number of migrated cells / microscope field in untreated control cells was 45 +/ - 8 for caco - 2 cells , 50 +/ - 3 for ht29 cells and 40 +/ - 3 for sw480 cells .
the value of migration of control cells exposed to the vehicle ( 1 % dmso ) was 44 +/ - 6 for caco - 2 cells , 51 +/ - 8 for ht29 cells and 40 +/ - 5 for sw480 cells .
moreover , to exclude that the results obtained in treated cells may depend on cell proliferation , we analysed cell migration in untreated cells and in cells treated for 24 hours with the highest concentrations of rosiglitazone or as601245 ( 50 microm ) in presence of mitomycin c. results obtained demonstrated that the migration values were similar in absence or in presence of mitomycin c ( cells / microscope field was 45 +/ - 8 for control caco - 2 cells and 44 +/ - 6 for caco - 2 control cells treated with mitomycin ; 50 +/ - 3 for control ht29 cells and 49 +/ - 5 for cells treated with mitomycin ; 40 +/ - 3 for control sw480 cells and 42 +/ - 8 for cells treated with mitomycin ) .
the percentages of inhibition in rosiglitazone treated cells were : 65 % and 64 % for caco - 2 cells , 79 % and 80 % for ht29 cells and 60 % and 63 % for sw480 , with and without mitomycin , respectively ; the percentages of inhibition of as601245 treated cells were : 55 % and 50 % for caco - 2 cells , 80 % and 75 % for ht29 cells and 92 % and 87 % for sw480 cells , with and without mitomycin , respectively ) .
in fig. 3 are reported the migration results obtained in cells treated with rosiglitazone , as601245 and both substances , expressed as the percentage of inhibition with respect the migration of cells exposed to the vehicle only ( 1 % dmso ) .
the migration was significantly inhibited by 10 and 50 microm rosiglitazone and as601245 in all three cell lines .
the treatments with different combinations of concentrations under 50 microm of both compounds produced an additive effect in inhibiting cell migration .
the combined treatment with concentrations of 50 microm rosiglitazone or as601245 did not produce additive effects ( data not shown ) , probably because these concentrations , alone , produced a percentage of inhibition close to the plateau .
microarray analysis of gene expression in caco - 2 cells to analyze whether the cell responses to the treatments with rosiglitazone , as601245 or with both substances were a consequence of a specific gene pathway modulation , we performed the microarray analysis by using the affimetryx genechip platform .
since the inhibition of cell adhesion and migration by rosiglitazone and as601245 was very similar in all three cell lines of colon cancer examined , we select caco - 2 cell line to perform this analysis , 24 hours after the treatments .
the doses used in this study were those able to induce an ic20 inhibition of caco - 2 cell proliferation ( 50 microm rosiglitazone and 0.1 microm as601245 ) .
the number of genes significantly modulated by rosiglitazone and by as601245 was very high .
the complete list of the genes modulated by rosiglitazone , as601245 and by the combined treatment is reported in the supporting information s1 .
the venn diagram ( fig. 4 ) shows that rosiglitazone modulated 1260 genes , as601245 modulated 3245 genes and , the combined treatments modulated 1188 genes .
among the genes affected by rosiglitazone alone or as601245 alone , 1118 were common in both of the two groups .
the combined treatment affected 735 genes which were present in both the rosiglitazone and as601245 groups , and 173 genes which were not affected by either rosiglitazone or as601245 , alone .
table 1 indicates the genes affected by rosiglitazone , by as601245 , and by the combined treatment with rosiglitazone and as601245 , arranged with respect to the relative biological functions and listed on the basis of the p - value .
the genes mainly affected by both individual treatments belong to cancer , genetic disorders , cell cycle , cell death and gastrointestinal disease groups .
the combined treatments affected mainly genes belonging to cancer and cell death functions .
the top ten genes changed the most by the rosiglitazone treatment , with respect to 1 % dmso treated cells , are reported in tab .
2. rosiglitazone treatment mainly increased the cyp1a1 ( 9.6 fold change ) gene expression which encodes a member of the cytochrome p450 superfamily of enzymes and increased ( from 6.06 to 2.79 fold changes ) the expression of a group of genes coding for metallothioneins ( mt1x , mt1e , mt1g , mt1h , mt2a , mt1m ) .
among genes down - regulated by rosiglitazone , the first was the fga gene ( - 3.42 fold change ) .
the other genes which codify for the fibrinogen chains ( fgb and fgg ) were down regulated by - 2.29 and - 2.02 fold , respectively .
other genes down - regulated by rosiglitazone belonged mainly to two functional groups : " cancer " ( rps27a , sorbs2 , stip1 , fga , fgfr2 , ssh3 , epn1 ) and cell death ( sorbs2 , stip1 , gas2 , epn1 ) .
tab.3 illustrates the genes modulated by the treatments with as601245 with respect to 1 % dmso treated cells .
in this case also , the gene most up - regulated was cyp1a1 ( 5.329 fold change ) .
the other genes up - regulated belonged mainly to the " growth of cells " function ( bmo2k , dlst , il6st , mga ) and the " transcription " function ( nfat5 and thrap3 ) .
the down - regulated genes belonged mainly to the " cancer " biofunction ( rps27a , hnrnpa1 , stip1 and tfdp1 ) .
after combined treatment with rosiglitazone and as601245 ( tab .
4 ) the major part of the top ten up - regulated genes were up - regulated by treatments with the single substances , also .
cyp1a1 was up - regulated by 11.09 fold .
il6st was induced by as601245 ( 2.8 fold change ) and by the combined treatments ( 4.1 fold change ) .
metallothionein genes were induced by the combined treatment to a lesser extent than that determined by rosiglitazone treatment .
conversely , the up - regulation of ap3d1 and nfat5 after combined treatment was similar to that observed after treatment with as601245 alone .
among the down - regulated genes , the three genes codifying the fibrinogen chains ( alpha , beta , gamma ) reached the top ten positions , while they were down - regulated to a lesser extent by rosiglitazone alone .
moreover , arhgef7 ( rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor )/ betapix gene was highly down - regulated by the combined treatment .
among the genes up regulated by the rosiglitazone treatment , only a few have a ppre putative sequence in the promoter , indicating that the major part of rosiglitazone functions were developed in a ppargamma - independent way .
since the inhibition of jnk could increase the affinity of activated ppargamma for the ppre sequences , we investigated , among the genes activated by rosiglitazone , by as601245 and by the combined treatment , the genes having ppre sequences by using the genome - wide library of high - confidence predicted ppar target genes as published by lemay and collaborators [ 27 ] ( tab. 5 ) .
it is noteworthy that , after combined treatments , the number of activated genes , containing ppre sequences , greatly increased ( 7 genes were up - regulated , after treatment with rosiglitazone alone , and 17 genes were up - regulated , after the combined treatment ) .
gene expression evaluation by realtime pcr to confirm results obtained by microarray analysis , realtime pcr of 5 selected genes ( 2 up - regulated and 3 down - regulated ) was performed .
results , reported in tab .
6 , indicated that the up or down fold changes obtained by microarray analysis were similar to those obtained in realtime pcr .
some discrepancies were found only for mt2a and fga that did not change in as601245 treated cells if evaluated in microarray analysis , whereas they were decreased by - 1.2 and - 2 fold , respectively , if analysed in realtime pcr .
to assess whether the inhibition of the expression of the three chains of fibrinogen , observed after rosiglitazone , as601245 and combined treatment with 50 microm rosiglitazone and 0.1 microm as601245 , was a common response of the colon cancer cells , we determined by realtime pcr the expression of the three chains of fibrinogen in caco - 2 , ht29 and sw480 cells .
results obtained are reported in tab 7 and demonstrated that the inhibition of the expression of fibrinogen chains ( except for sw480 cells , in which the alpha chain of fibrinogen is not detectable ) was a common response to the treatments of all three cell lines .
fibrinogen release since the expression of all three chains of fibrinogen are highly down - regulated by combined treatment with rosiglitazone and as601245 , the release of fibrinogen from caco - 2 cells in the culture medium was determined in control cells , in cells treated with a single compound ( 50 , 10 and 1 microm rosiglitazone or 0.1 microm as601245 ) and in cells treated with both substances ( 50 microm rosiglitazone plus 0.1 microm as601245 ) .
results , reported in fig. 5 , indicate that rosiglitazone reduced in a dose - dependent way the amount of fibrinogen released in the culture medium ( a 47.2 % reduction after treatment with 50 microm rosiglitazone and a 42 % reduction after treatment with 10 microm rosiglitazone ) , whereas 1 microm rosiglitazone or 0.1 microm as601245 did not significantly affect this parameter .
interestingly , the reduction of fibrinogen release after combined treatment with 50 microm rosiglitazone and 0.1 microm as601245 was significantly higher ( a 60 % reduction ) than that produced by the treatment with 50 microm rosiglitazone , alone .
evaluation of beta - pix protein expression in caco - 2 , ht29 and sw480 colon cancer cells since the microarray analysis and real - time pcr indicated that arhgef7 / beta - pix gene was highly down - regulated after combined treatment with rosiglitazone and as601245 , we analysed the expression of beta - pix protein in caco - 2 cells , and in the other cell lines of colon cancer previously examined in this study : ht29 and sw480 cells .
the beta - pix expression was analysed after treatment with 1 , 10 and 50 microm rosiglitazone , 0.1 , 1 and 10 microm as601245 , and after combined treatment with 50 microm rosiglitazone and 0.1 microm as601245 .
results indicated that both rosiglitazone and as601245 decreased in a dose - dependent way the beta - pix expression , starting from 10 microm rosiglitazone and 1 microm as601245 in caco - 2 cells , while in the other two lines the dose - dependence was not so evident ( fig. 6 ) .
combined treatment was more effective in decreasing the beta - pix expression than the treatments with the highest dose of rosiglitazone in ht29 and sw480 cells , whereas in caco - 2 cells the effect of combined treatment was not so evident .
evaluation of cell migration in beta - pix transfected cells to asses the role of beta - pix protein as a target for the rosiglitazone and as601245 inhibitory effect on cell invasiveness , we performed transient transfection of caco - 2 , ht20 and sw480 cells with plasmide constructs containing the beta - pix gene , as described under " materials and methods. fig. 7 ( panel a ) shows beta - pix expression in caco - 2 , ht29 and sw480 cells and in cells transfected with the plasmide empty or containing beta - pix gene .
the transfection with beta - pix gene resulted in a 6 fold increase of beta - pix protein with respect to the caco - 2 control cells and about a 4 fold increase of beta - pix protein with respect to the ht29 an sw480 control cells .
to verify whether the endogenous increase of beta - pix protein could affect the response to the rosiglitazone and as60124 treatment , we analysed the migration capacity after drug treatment in control and transfected cells. fig. 7 ( panel b ) reports the percentage of migration inhibition , with respect to the untreated cells , 24 hours after treatment with different concentrations of rosiglitazone and as601245 and the combinations of two drugs .
the beta - pix transfection abrogated the inhibition of cell migration determined by rosiglitazone , as601245 and combined treatment in all three cell lines , thus indicating that beta - pix protein was an important target for rosiglitazone and as601245 inhibitory action .
discussion results obtained demonstrated that the combined treatment with rosiglitazone and as601245 increases the anticancer effects of the two substances in colon cancer cells .
in particular cell adhesion and migration were reduced by the rosiglitazone alone and they were further reduced by the combined treatment of rosiglitazone and as601245 .
in this paper we demonstrated that rosiglitazone strongly inhibited cell adhesion at doses ( 1 microm ) ineffective in modulating other parameters .
this important datum may be related to the inhibition of expression of all fibrinogen chains ( fga , fgb and fgg ) caused by rosiglitazone alone ( fga was inhibited by - 3.426 fold , fgb by - 2.09 fold and fgg by - 2.02 fold ) .
interestingly , both inhibition of cell adhesion and the inhibition of fibrinogen chain expressions were enhanced by the combined treatment with the jnk inhibitor and rosiglitazone .
although little literature data is available about the effect of ppar ligands in cell adhesion , reddy and collaborators [ 28 ] reported that ppargamma ligands inhibited chemotaxis of pmn suggesting that ppar ligands influence cell adhesion and migration .
moreover , we demonstrated that rosiglitazone not only inhibited fibrinogen chain expressions , but also reduced the amount of fibrinogen released by the cells .
it is well known that the increase of fibrin ( ogen ) is correlated with an increase of risk of metastasis [ 29 ] .
these results may suggest that ppargamma ligands could effectively inhibit the first steps of the metastatic process .
the results obtained about the inhibition of migration by rosiglitazone and as601245 also support the hypothesis that ppargamma ligands and anti - inflammatory drugs can reduce cancer cell invasiveness .
recently it has been demonstrated that ppar gamma agonists 15d - pgj ( 2 ) and rosiglitazone significantly reduced eosinophil migration into the peritoneal cavity [ 30 ] and that ciglitazone reduced both wound - induced migration and chemotaxis of breast cancer cells [ 31 ] in a ppargamma - dependent and ppargamma - independent manner .
as far as it regards jnk inhibitors in the control of cell migration and invasion , it has been reported that jnk2 - selective peptide inhibitors inhibited breast cancer cell migration [ 32 ] and that jnk suppression inhibited cell migration in human lovo colon cancer cells [ 33 ] .
the results obtained in the microarray experiments suggested that the arhgef7 / beta - pix gene could be an important target for rosiglitazone and as601245 action .
the inhibition of beta - pix expression was confirmed by the realtime pcr and western blot analysis .
interestingly , beta - pix protein content was decreased , by rosiglitazone and as601245 , in all three lines of colon cancer , suggesting that this effect could be a common feature of rosiglitazone and as601245 action .
beta - pix protein belongs to a family of cytoplasmic proteins that activate the ras - like family of rho proteins by exchanging bound gdp for gtp .
it forms a complex with the small gtp binding protein rac1 and recruits rac1 to membrane ruffles and to focal adhesions [ 34 ] .
the small gtpase rac1 is a well - characterized modulator of cell migration [ 34 ] .
in addition , the role of beta - pix in cell migration has recently been stressed by the results demonstrating that the restoration of beta - pix expression by genetic manipulation , restored the migratory ability of mesenchymal stromal cells ( mdcs ) from patients of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , and the inhibition of beta - pix expression with shrna , reduced the migration of healthy mscs [ 35 ] .
on the basis of these results , we postulated that beta - pix protein could be involved in the rosiglitazone and as601245 inhibition of cell migration .
indeed , the results obtained by the transfection experiments confirmed the role played by beta - pix protein in this contest , since our data demonstrated , for the first time , that beta - pix transfection completely abrogates the inhibition of colon cancer cell migration caused by rosiglitazone , as601245 or by combined treatment with both compounds .
although the treatment with 0.1 microm as601245 increased the number of ppre containing genes activated by 50 microm rosiglitazone , the most quantitatively important genes up - modulated by rosiglitazone are the metallothionein genes ( mt1x , mt1e , mt1g , mt1h , mt2a ) which do not contain ppre sequences .
metallothionein genes can be induced by anti - inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone [ 36 ] and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , such as chloroquina , diclofenac and indometacin [ 37 ] .
metallothioneins provide protection against metal toxicity [ 38 ] and oxidative stress [ 39 ] .
in cancer cells , metallothionein expressions are increased , decreased or not changed in relation to the cancer types [ 40 ] .
in particular , a significant decrease in the amount of metallothionein proteins in colorectal adenoma and carcinoma , as compared with normal colorectal mucosa , has been reported [ 41 ] .
thus , the increase of metallothionein expression by rosiglitazone may be ascribed to both the anti - neoplastic and anti - inflammatory effects exerted by rosiglitazone in colon cancer cells [ 42 ] .
taken together , our data demonstrated , in colon cancer cells , the effectiveness of combined treatments with ppargamma agonists and a jnk inhibitor in reducing cell adhesion and migration , and are in agreement to the data indicating a positive interaction between ppargamma ligands and anti - inflammatory agents in humans [ 43 ] .

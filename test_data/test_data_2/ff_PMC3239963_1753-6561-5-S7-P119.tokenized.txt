even though , the biosynthesis of the lignin constituents - the monolignols - is well characterized , little is known about the genetic control of the natural variation in lignin content and composition .
the few association studies performed to date in forest species only uncover 5 - 20 % of the heritable variation of quantitative traits such as wood composition .
the " missing heritability " can be explained in part by the low resolution of these pioneering association studies in forest species .
however , as observed in genome - wide association studies with humans , a large proportion of the " missing heritability " is likely to occur due to other factors , such as the abundance of rare alleles observed in forest species and complex epistatic interaction between genetic elements .
causal rare alleles and genetic interactions remain undetectable with current statistical methods .
in order to shed light on possible interactions between lignin biosynthesis genes and other pathways , we analyzed the transcriptome of 181 genotypes of a pseudo - backcross family of populus .
the analyses allowed identification of genes and pathways that were highly co - expressed with genes involved in the biosynthesis of monolignols .
correlations at the transcript level offer initial evidence of possible interactions between genetic elements for the production of monolignols .
methods a previously published microarray data [ 1 ] was utilized .
briefly , this microarray contains a gene expression probe for every gene annotated in the genome of populus trichocarpa ( v1.1. ) .
microarray chips were hybridized with cdna synthesized from xylem tissue of 181 genotypes from a pseudo - backcross pedigree of populus trichocarpa x p. deltoides .
this family was also analyzed for lignin content on xylem tissue [ 2 ] .
genetic differences in gene expression allowed us to correlate the transcript abundance of 23 previously identified xylem - specific monolignol biosynthetic - genes [ 3 ] against the cdna levels of all annotated genes of populus .
correlation was estimated based on spearman 's rank method in r. the top correlated genes ( r > 0.75 , p - value < 0.001 ) were clustered with the 23 monolignol biosynthetic - genes based on a " modulated modularity clustering " method [ 4 ] .
the genes clustered with the 23 monolignol biosynthetic - genes were go annotated based on the blastp best hit against the arabidopsis gene models .
a fisher 's exact test was applied to identify go terms enriched within these clusters .
results utilizing a correlation threshold of 0.75 ( p - value < 0.001 ) , 1369 genes were correlated with at least one of the 23 monolignol biosynthetic - genes .
these genes were clustered together with the lignin phenotypic trait and 78 genes that were correlated with lignin ( r > 0.45 ) .
the 23 monolignol genes were clustered in four groups , containing a total of 936 genes ( figure 1 ) .
surprisingly , the lignin trait itself did not cluster with any other gene , and the vast majority ( 75 %) of the top 78 lignin - correlated genes were grouped on clusters 12 and 15 .
clusters 14 and 16 did not have lignin - correlated genes .
we analyzed the go annotation among genes within the four monolignol - related clusters .
a fisher 's exact test was utilized to find go terms enriched within these clusters when compared to all annotated genes in the genome of populus .
sixty - nine go terms were significantly enriched ( fdr < 0.01 ) among genes clustered with the 23 monolignol genes : 11 terms are from the ontology cellular component ( cc ) , 26 from molecular function ( mf ) and 32 from biological process ( bp ) .
as expected , most of these mf and bp terms (> 65 %) are related to lignin , cellulose and hemicellulose biogenesis .
this high specificity indicates that even the genes with unknown mf and bp ( 260 of the 936 monolignol clustered genes ) might be involved in cell - wall biogenesis .
enriched go terms not directly related to cell - wall biogenesis include " drought - recovery " , " salicylic acid catabolism " , " response to cadmium ion " and " response to zinc ion " .
in addition to the significantly enriched go terms , we also constructed a co - expression network including the core , most highly correlated genes ( r > 0.85 ) within each of the four identified , monolignol biosynthetic clusters .
these networks , representing the most likely interacting genes , will be presented .
figure 1 symmetrical correlation matrix depicting clusters of genes highly co - expressed ( r > 0.75 ) with 23 xylem - specific monolignol biosynthetic - genes .
clusters 12 , 14 , 15 and 16 contain the 23 monolignol genes , as shown .
genes within these clusters were analyzed for gene ontology term enrichment .
additionally , co - expression networks were built within these four clusters .
conclusion this work presents a set of approximately 900 genes highly co - expressed with xylem - specific monolignol biosynthesis genes .
many of these genes are currently annotated with unknown function , or are not known to be involved in cell - wall biogenesis .
we offer initial evidence towards a role or interaction of these genes in the biosynthesis of lignin and possibly other cell - wall components .

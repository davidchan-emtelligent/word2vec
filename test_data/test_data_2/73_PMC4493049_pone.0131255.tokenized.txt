objectives to investigate whether a value of information analysis , commonly applied in health care evaluations , is feasible and meaningful in the field of crime prevention .
methods interventions aimed at reducing juvenile delinquency are increasingly being evaluated according to their cost - effectiveness .
results of cost - effectiveness models are subject to uncertainty in their cost and effect estimates .
further research can reduce that parameter uncertainty .
the value of such further research can be estimated using a value of information analysis , as illustrated in the current study .
we built upon an earlier published cost - effectiveness model that demonstrated the comparison of two interventions aimed at reducing juvenile delinquency .
outcomes were presented as costs per criminal activity free year .
results at a societal willingness - to - pay of euro71,700 per criminal activity free year , further research to eliminate parameter uncertainty was valued at euro176 million .
therefore , in this illustrative analysis , the value of information analysis determined that society should be willing to spend a maximum of euro176 million in reducing decision uncertainty in the cost - effectiveness of the two interventions .
moreover , the results suggest that reducing uncertainty in some specific model parameters might be more valuable than in others .
conclusions using a value of information framework to assess the value of conducting further research in the field of crime prevention proved to be feasible .
the results were meaningful and can be interpreted according to health care evaluation studies .
this analysis can be helpful in justifying additional research funds to further inform the reimbursement decision in regard to interventions for juvenile delinquents .
the study was financed by an unrestricted grant from the dutch organisation for health research and development in the netherlands ( grant number 80 - 82435 - 98 - 10104 ) .

introduction in order to guide policy decisions , it would be helpful to know the cost - effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing juvenile delinquency .
so far , cost - effectiveness analyses have informed an increasing number of reimbursement decisions in mental health - care [ 1,2 ] .
accordingly , the number of cost - effectiveness analyses in the field of crime prevention is increasing [ 2 - 10 ] .
the inputs in a cost - effectiveness analysis can be uncertain , as available information about the costs and effects of interventions is rarely perfect .
as a result , the decision whether or not to reimburse an intervention is marked by uncertainty .
when a decision to reimburse an intervention turns out to be incorrect , it could lead to suboptimal interventions being approved .
these interventions create costs in terms of foregone benefits and resources [ 11 - 15 ] .
further research may eliminate this uncertainty and optimize the reimbursement decision .
this study aims to estimate the added value of future cost - effectiveness research .
this type of analysis is referred to as a ' value of information ' analysis and was introduced as part of statistical decision theory [ 16,17 ] .
it has already been applied in other research areas , such as engineering and environmental risk analysis [ 18 ] , before being introduced into health technology assessment [ 11 - 15,19 ] , where the application of this analysis is now widely adopted , as well as in the field of mental health care [ 20,21 ] .
a value of information analysis reveals the value of conducting additional research and identifies the type of research that would be most useful .
its results can inform about further research on specific parameters , and more precisely inform the decision about which intervention should be reimbursed [ 22 ] .
furthermore , a value of information analysis can be used to prioritize future research , for example by highlighting the merits of certain types of research which might add to the reduction of the parameter uncertainty in cost - effectiveness analysis [ 15,23,24 ] .
the potential value of further research could then be weighed against the costs of conducting this research in order to determine whether it is worthwhile ( i.e. [ 11,12 ]) .
because a value of information analysis has not yet been applied in the field of crime prevention , we will present an example of this analysis based on an existing cost - effectiveness model in crime prevention and treatment [ 25 ] .
we used two interventions aimed at reducing juvenile delinquency in the netherlands , in adolescents aged 12 - 18 years .
these interventions can be applied to prevent juvenile delinquency or used to prevent juveniles committing crimes in future , for example after an adolescent has been punished under the juvenile criminal laws .
juvenile law in the netherlands applies to adolescents aged 12 - 17 years [ 26 ] .
not only the criminal act itself is important , but there is a strong focus on for example the background and moral development of the adolescent [ 26 ] .
as the present study was set up as an illustration , data was used solely to demonstrate the method .
we did not aim to test the superiority of one of the interventions that were used to illustrate the method .
therefore , this article merely presents a demonstration of the relevance of a value of information analysis in the field of crime prevention and treatment .
the presented input data and results should be interpreted in this context .
we will start with a short summary of an earlier illustrative cost - effectiveness analysis [ 25 ] , and then introduce and illustrate the value of information analysis .
methods interventions we compared two interventions aimed at reducing juvenile delinquency .
the ' kursushuis' intervention ( translated and referred to as the course house ) consists of a domestic foster home where several adolescents live for about 10 months and professional care is at close hand .
the treatment costs and effects were described by slot et al .
[ 27 ] .
the second intervention is a systemic intervention named functional family therapy ( fft ) , which lasts about 4 to 6 months .
the costs and effects of this intervention were obtained from a multicentre quasi - experimental study in the netherlands [ 28 ] .
the medical ethical committee of the vu university amsterdam approved this study ( number 2008 / 152 ) .
cost - effectiveness model the markov model that was used for the value of information analysis consists of three mutually exclusive model states : a ) criminal behaviour , b ) no criminal behaviour , and c ) dead [ 25 ] ( fig 1 ) .
the time horizon of the model was 20 years , with a cycle length of six months [ 25 ] .
a societal perspective was taken and results were expressed as costs per criminal activity free year ( cafy ) [ 25 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0131255.g001 fig 1 markov model .
nmr = natural mortality rate .
tpa2a = transition probability of staying in state a .
tpa2b = transition probability of moving from state a to state b .
tpb2a = transition probability of moving from state b to state a .
tpb2b = transition probability of staying in state b. in line with health economic guidelines [ 29 ] , the input parameters in the model were threefold .
the first group of parameters were the transition probabilities .
these reflect the probability that an adolescent transitions through the states .
the measure of time an adolescent spends in a non - criminal state is used to estimate a cafy .
criminal activity was based on the adolescents' self - reported contact with the police in connection with he / she having committed one or several crimes ; having had no contacts was defined as criminal - activity free and having had one or more contacts as criminally active .
transition probabilities were extrapolated until the age of 30 , as we integrated parts of the long - term stabilising effects described by moffitt [ 25,30 ] .
dying because of committing crimes was not reflected in the cafy .
adolescents were assumed to face a risk of death equivalent to the age specific mortality rates in the general population [ 31 ] .
the second group consisted of costs of health - care use , productivity losses , and other societal costs such as costs of the criminal justice system .
both costs outside health care , and health care costs were included , such as the costs of visiting a psychiatrist or psychologist .
as the family system is involved in the interventions provided , we included both the costs of the adolescent and those of one of the parents .
the model state costs were fixed over time until the adolescent was 23 years .
it was assumed that from that age onwards not all cost categories ( such as a family guardian or foster care ) would remain relevant .
the third group comprised the intervention costs .
the costs of one completed fft treatment was calculated to be approximately euro10,900 per adolescent , whereas the course house was about euro37,800 ( retrieved from slot et al. [ 27 ]) .
both costs were extrapolated to 2013 euro 's accounting for inflation based on the consumer price index [ 32 ] .
the cost and effects in the model were discounted ( i.e. [ 33,34 ]) , according to the guidelines for economic evaluations in the netherlands [ 29 ] .
to represent the uncertainty of each model parameter , we assigned parameter distributions ( s1 table ) .
in a probabilistic analysis , uncertainty was simulated by running the model 10,000 times using a cohort of subjects and each time taking different parameter estimates from the parameter distributions [ 11,12 ] .
these 10,000 unique sets of parameter values were used to estimate the mean expected cost - effectiveness .
for further details on the cost - effectiveness model , we refer to schawo et al .
[ 25 ] .
cost - effectiveness analysis the stochastic model resulted in the relative cost - effectiveness outcomes of the course house intervention compared with fft , represented as incremental costs / cafy ( table 1 ; fig 2 ) .
it showed that the course house was more effective than fft , but also produced higher costs .
the cumulative number of cafys for the course house exceeded the number of cafys for fft by 0.7 , while the incremental costs of the course house exceeded those of fft by euro26,800 , thereby positioning the intervention in the north east quadrant of the cost - effectiveness plane [ 35 ] ( fig 2 ) .
the incremental cost - effectiveness ratio ( icer ) of the course house compared with fft was 39,000 euro / cafy .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0131255.g002 fig 2 incremental cost - effectiveness plane for course house compared with fft ( 10,000 simulations ) .
fft = functional family therapy cafy = criminal activity free year .

a the results represented were averaged over the 10,000 simulations run .
b the icer was calculated as the difference in cost divided by the difference in cafys between the course house and fft .
c the nmb was calculated by multiplying cafys by the wtpvalue of euro71,700 per cafy and subtracting cost .
the course house is cost - effective compared with fft , because the nmb of the course house is higher than the nmb of fft .
due to decimals , the numbers in the table multiplied do not give the exact nmb values represented in this table .
parameter uncertainty the influence of parameter uncertainty on the model outcomes was shown in the cost - effectiveness acceptability frontier ( ceaf ) .
in the ceaf , the probability of being cost - effective compared to the other intervention is shown for the intervention with the highest expected net monetary benefit ( nmb ) for a range of societal willingness - to - pay ( wtp ) values per cafy , and is therefore cost - effective compared with the alternative , given a certain wtp [ 36,37 ] .
here , the overall maximum expected net benefit guides the decision on which intervention is cost - effective compared with the alternative intervention [ 36,37 ] .
the nmb was calculated by multiplying cafys by the wtp value per cafy and subtracting cost [ 11,12 ] .
the ceaf is illustrated in the results' section .
value of information analysis in the value of information analysis , the parameter uncertainty in the model is monetarized .
more precisely , we estimated the value of ' knowing everything ' : the ' expected value of having perfect information ' ( evpi ) [ 12,14 ] .
having perfect information would eliminate parameter uncertainty and optimize the reimbursement decision .
in estimating the ' value of knowing everything ' , the evpi places an upper boundary on the value of performing further research [ 11,12 ] .
it can be interpreted as the maximum value society ' should ' be willing to pay for additional evidence to reduce decision uncertainty around which intervention is preferred and , therefore , inform the reimbursement decision in the future [ 11,12 ] .
the evpi is computed by first taking the difference between the expected nmb with perfect information and the expected nmb with current information per simulation .
this difference is equal to the expected benefits foregone when making the decision based on current evidence [ 11,12 ] .
comparing the evpi estimates with the costs of this future research reveals whether further research is worthwhile .
as the value of further information is related to the size of the eligible population of adolescents to be treated , the evpi was multiplied with the eligible population of adolescents in the population evpi ( pevpi ) .
about 825 adolescents annually were assumed to be eligible for fft in the netherlands .
when we discount this number over five years , which is the assumed lifetime of the intervention for which additional research would be useful [ 11,29 ] , it resulted in an eligible population of 3,820 adolescents .
we assumed that the eligible number of adolescents for the course house was equal to that for fft .
in a value of information analysis one could also focus on specific groups of model parameters .
to identify the model parameters that contribute to most of the uncertainty and for which future research is the most promising , we estimated the expected value of partial perfect information ( evppi ) [ 11,12 ] .
the evppi was estimated using the sheffield accelerated value of information application of strong et al .
[ 38 ] .
multiplying the evppi values with the eligible population results in the population evppi ( pevppi ) .
the evpi and evppi not only depend on the uncertainty of the model parameters , but also on the wtp per cafy .
in the absence of a wtp per cafy in the netherlands , we used wtp estimates to reduce crime of cohen et al .
[ 39,40 ] .
these wtp values per crime indicate the value society wants to pay to prevent one crime , for example euro32,200 per burglary ( table 2 ) .
table 2 provides an overview of these estimates , adjusted for inflation and purchasing power parities [ 41 ] .
although wtp to prevent one crime is definitely not equal to wtp per cafy , we used it to illustrate what is meant by wtp in crime prevention and how the concept can be used in a value of information analysis .
we hereby implicitly assumed that one crime is committed per year , and thus exactly one crime per year is avoided in a cafy .
we estimated the evpi and evppi for various wtp values , and we chose an average wtp value to illustrate the result in the results section , which was euro71,700 ( table 2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0131255.t002 table 2 willingness - to - pay values for crimes ( cohen & piquero , 2009 ) .

results model uncertainty the ceaf shows that fft had the highest nmb for a wtp ranging from euro0 - euro39,000 ( fig 3 ) .
at a wtp of euro39,000 , fft was cost - effective in 49 % of the 10,000 model simulations , or a probability of 0.49 , whereas the course house was cost - effective in 51 % of the simulations .
above the euro39,000 wtp , the course house had the highest nmb and thus was the optimal intervention .
this switching point in the ceaf is where the nmb for fft is equal to the nmb of the course house .
at this point , the wtp was exactly equal to the icer value ( euro39,000 per cafy ) .

fft = functional family therapy .
cafy = ciminal activity free year .
wtp = willingness - to - pay .
the ceaf ( fig 3 ) shows a large error probability .
at the wtp of euro71,700 the course house was cost - effective in 57 % of the 10,000 model simulations , which suggests that there is an error probability of 0.43 that could be reduced by collecting additional evidence .
value of information analysis in order to know the value of reducing the error probability and to assign a value to additional research , we estimated the evpi .
table 3 illustrates the evpi estimation ( based on soeteman et al. [ 21 ]) .
the table shows the generated nmb for each intervention for 6 of the 10,000 simulations , given a wtp value of euro71,700 per cafy .
the evpi was determined as follows : first , we assumed that decision makers have perfect information for each simulation instead of making one single choice over all simulations .
for example , for simulation 1 and 2 , this would result in the choice for fft ( see table 3 ) .
second , we determined the choice based on current information .
in this case , the course house had the highest expected nmb ( euro641,200 ) over all simulations and hence was the preferred intervention .
finally , we took the difference between the decision based on perfect information per simulation and the optimal choice over all simulations .
this difference resulted in the evpi value or the benefits foregone per simulation .
the expectation of all benefits foregone over the 10,000 simulations is the evpi per adolescent , which is euro46,000 at a wtp value of euro71,700 per cafy .
perfect information for an individual adolescent was thus valued at euro46,000 .
multiplying this evpi value by 3,820 eligible adolescents resulted in a pevpi of euro176 million .
this pevpi value suggests that , at a societal wtp value of euro71,700 per cafy , there is room to reduce the parameter uncertainty in the model by a maximum of euro176 million .

10,000 euro602,300 euro587,200 euro602,300 euro0 a net monetary benefit ( nmb ) was calculated by multiplying cafys by the wtp value of euro71,700 per cafy and subtracting cost .
explanation : decision based on current information : course house .
decision based on perfect information : bold .
expected net benefit with current information : euro641,200 .
expected net benefit with perfect information : euro687,200 .
expected value of perfect information ( evpi ) : euro687,200 - euro641,200 = euro46,000 .
perfect information can be valued at different wtp values .
the extent of the monetarized uncertainty surrounding the decision for a range of wtp values is represented in the pevpi curve .
fig 4 presents the pevpi curve for an eligible population of 3,820 adolescents .
as an example we consider the point where research costs society euro50 million ( i.e. the pevpi value at the y - axis in fig 4 ) .
at this point further research would potentially be cost - effective if society were willing to pay more than euro17,600 per cafy ( i.e. the value at the x - axis , if the pevpi is euro50 million ) .
at lower values of the wtp per cafy , the benefits of further research cannot offset the costs [ 11,42 ] .
at a wtp of euro39,000 per cafy , the pevpi shows a local maximum of euro127 million .
at this point , the parameter uncertainty in the model is the highest and thus decision uncertainty is highest , as already shown in the ceaf curve ( fig 3 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0131255.g004 fig 4 population expected value of perfect information ( pevpi ) and population expected value of partial perfect information ( pevppi ) curve .
fft = functional family therapy .
cafy = criminal activity free year .
pevpi = population expected value of perfect information .
pevppi = population expected value of partial perfect information .
perfect information of subsets of parameters was valued in the pevppi .
this pevppi was estimated for a range of wtp values ( fig 4 ) .
at the illustrative wtp value of euro71,700 per cafy , future research would be most valuable for three subsets of parameters : the transition probabilities and the intervention costs of the course house and the transition probabilities of fft ( see fig 4 ) .
the pevppi of the transition probabilities of the course house was euro125 million ( euro32,700 per adolescent ) , and the pevppi for the transition probabilities of fft was euro91 million ( euro23,800 per adolescent ) .
the pevppi for the intervention costs of the course house was euro28 million ( euro7,400 per adolescent ) .
the pevppis for the direct non health - care costs of the criminal state and the non criminal state were respectively euro8,400 and euro43,300 ( respectively euro2 and euro11per adolescent ) .
the pevppis for the other parameter groups were all estimated to be zero ( fig 4 ) , meaning there was no potential value of further research into these parameters .
given a wtp of euro71,700 per cafy further research for these parameters would not reduce decision uncertainty .
the evpi and evppi values depend highly on the wtp value per cafy , as can be seen in fig 4 and s2 table .
at a wtp of for example euro40,000 , there was indeed potential value of further research into all model states costs .
note that due to the interactions within the model structure , the pevppi for the groups of parameters do not sum up to the overall pevpi for the model ( see fig 4 ) [ 11,42 ] .
discussion while cost - effectiveness analyses are increasingly being used in the field of crime prevention , the value of further research has not yet been estimated for comparison between interventions aimed at reducing juvenile delinquency .
an earlier developed cost - effectiveness model was used to estimate this value of further research .
this study demonstrated that it was feasible to estimate the value of conducting further research in this context , using a value of information framework common in health economic evaluations .
the results can be interpreted as similar to cost / qaly ( quality - adjusted life year ) studies in health care evaluation .
in this value of information analysis , the results indicated the parameters for which further research was valuable .
our findings show particular uncertainty in three groups of parameters : the transition probabilities of the course house and of fft , and to a lesser extent , the intervention costs of the course house and the direct non health - care costs in both model states .
performing additional research in the suggested fields can reduce parameter uncertainty , and hence , can reduce decision uncertainty .
therefore , the results of a value of information analysis can prioritize further research to optimize the final reimbursement decision , thereby increasing the probability that adolescents will be assigned to the intervention that is cost - effective , compared with the alternative .
given this information , future interventions could be reimbursed ( or not ) , and they could also be approved ' only in research ' ( oir ) ( i.e. further research is required before the intervention can be approved ) or ' approved with research ' ( awr ) ( i.e. research can be conducted while the intervention is approved ) [ 43,44 ] .
for example , from this study we can conclude that given a wtp of euro40,000 per cafy , the course house could be ' approved with research ' .
the course house would then be reimbursed while further research would be required , for example on the effectiveness of the course house .
current practice in adolescent care in the netherlands illustrates this approval condition : the dutch youth institute identifies effective youth interventions , while still conducting research on the effectiveness of some of these interventions [ 45 ] .
however , approval might lead to irrecoverable costs when the approval is revised due to subsequent research revealing that the course house was not as effective as expected .
then , approval ' only in research ' might be preferred , because commitment to future costs is avoided until the results of further research are known .
approval might even be dependent on any change in the effective price of an intervention [ 44,46 ] .
this study was a first attempt to apply a value of information framework to the field of crime prevention and treatment of juvenile delinquents .
therefore , some considerations should be kept in mind .
the value of information analysis estimates the monetary value of eliminating all or part of the parameter uncertainty of the presented model .
however , two other sources of uncertainty can influence the results : structural and methodological uncertainty [ 47,48 ] .
structural uncertainty relates to structural aspects of the model [ 47,49,50 ] , such as the conceptual framework or the transitions between the model states [ 50 ] , and it can lead to different estimated model outcomes ( i.e. [ 51 ]) .
this structural uncertainty is likely to be present in our model .
for example , we did not account for the severity of crimes in the model states or the elevated risk of death for adolescents in the criminal state ( i.e. [ 52,53 ]) .
the uncertainty of these aspects was not represented in the current value of information analysis .
future cost - effectiveness models in the field of crime prevention should therefore carefully characterize the structural uncertainty [ 50 ] , and account for it when possible , for example by parameterization [ 49,50 ] or model averaging [ 47,50,54 ] .
the second additional source of uncertainty is methodological uncertainty , which relates to the analytical method chosen [ 48,49 ] .
our model also represents some methodological uncertainties , such as whether or not to include the costs of crime in the model ( i.e. [ 55 ]) .
here , three methodological uncertainties in our model are discussed in more detail .
these uncertainties could be resolved through , for example , formulating guidelines ( i.e. [ 47,49 ]) to model cost - effectiveness research in the field of crime prevention .
the first methodological uncertainty concerns the societal perspective used in the model , which means that we included the costs and effects relevant to society .
when considering this perspective in health care , the focus is merely on the patient , whereas this will be different in the area of crime prevention and treatment ( i.e. [ 56 ]) .
in this study , we already included the direct and indirect costs of one parent , as well as direct non medical costs of the adolescent , such as the costs of contact with the police .
other costs that we did not account for , but are nevertheless relevant in the field of crime prevention are : the effect of the intervention reflected in both costs and effects , such as increased wellbeing and reduced productivity losses ( i.e. [ 56 ]) , in regard to family members ( e.g. parents or siblings of the adolescents ) .
further additional categories are reduced victim costs and increased victim wellbeing , the reduction of the number of out - of - home placements , the reduction of the costs of committed crimes to society , reduced costs of avoided crimes to society and the value of reduced fear of crime ( i.e. [ 39,56 ]) .
the second methodological uncertainty deals with the wtp value for a cafy .
although we used the wtp values of cohen et al .
[ 39,40 ] to illustrate the use of wtp in crime prevention , wtp to prevent a crime like burglary is definitely not equal to wtp per cafy .
therefore , it is important to carefully estimate the wtp value per cafy .
in this study , for example , we could have weighted the wtp values of cohen et al .
[ 39,40 ] by the frequency of the crimes as yearly committed by the adolescents in this study , or by the number of yearly registered crimes in the netherlands .
for clarity reasons and due to a lack of more detailed data regarding the crimes committed , we chose not to use a weighted wtp value .
furthermore , for the wtp values used , it is not exactly known which components of crime , such as investigation , prosecution , witnesses , legal aid , prevention programs , the costs to victims , and the valuation of fear [ 39 ] are included in this valuation [ 39,57 ] .
therefore , further research is needed into which categories of costs of crime are included in a wtp value , before determining what society is willing to pay for one cafy .
the cost categories included in the cost - effectiveness model should be reflected in the wtp value and vice versa .
also , other estimations of the societal wtp might be considered .
these could , for example , be based on the cost of crime using a bottom - up approach or a breaking - down approach [ 58 ] .
these methods take into account only the costs of crime , not the willingness to reduce crime levels .
third , to estimate a wtp per cafy , it should be known what type of criminal activity is avoided in a cafy .
the seriousness of the crime , the number of times the crime is committed and the types of criminal activity can also be taken into account in defining criminal activity .
furthermore , it is important to decide on how to measure criminal activity .
the cafy used in our study was based on the adolescents' self - reported contact with the police .
however , criminal activity may as well be determined on the basis of police registries [ 27 ] , contacts with other judicial institutions [ 6 - 8 ] , rates of reconviction [ 3 ] , or a delinquency score [ 5 ] .
different definitions of criminal activity can influence the model results .
for example not all committed crimes are recorded in police registrations , while self - reported measures could yield socially desirable answers .
using the cafy in further research thus requires a clear definition of criminal activity .
a final remark on this analysis concerns the interventions chosen .
fft and the course house were chosen to illustrate the analysis in the field of crime prevention .
the interventions under study , however , could be replaced by other interventions aimed at reducing juvenile delinquency , such as multisystemic therapy , multidimensional foster treatment care or multidimensional family therapy [ 45 ] .
contrary to a broader range of cost - effectiveness studies in the uk and us ( i.e. [ 4,59 ]) , in the netherlands , to the best of our knowledge , the cost - effectiveness of such interventions has not yet been investigated , except for a cost - benefit analyses of ' maatregel inrichting stelstelmatige daders' or a case study into ' strafrechtelijke opvang verslaafden ' [ 56,60 ] , which are both aimed at adults .
furthermore , in studying interventions in this field , the context of the interventions under study is highly important .
in our illustration , we assumed that in practice , the interventions would be applied completely equivalently .
however , preferences for an intervention may influence the choice for a certain intervention in reality , such as earlier experience with an intervention , specific characteristics of an adolescent , or the availability of the intervention itself .
in our illustration , fft may be , for example , used more often to avoid committing crimes , whereas the course house could be used as an addition to a punishment under juvenile justice law , where the adolescent has already committed a crime .
there may then be a higher probability of recidivism if the adolescents already have a history of committing crimes [ 61 ] .
these non - equivalent baseline situations may influence the measured effectiveness of the intervention .
moreover , the situation after treatment may also be different .
this may affect the acceptance of possible or required further care ( i.e. [ 61 ]) , and therefore may influence the final degree of committing crimes in the future .
in modelling the cost - effectiveness of interventions in the field of crime prevention , the application of interventions in practice should therefore be taken into account in a cost - effectiveness model , or at least , this should be clarified when modelling the cost - effectiveness of such interventions .
in conclusion , an analysis to estimate the value of performing further research had not yet been conducted in the field of crime prevention .
the findings of the current study illustrate how such an analysis might be estimated and interpreted in this field .
future investment in cost - effectiveness research on interventions aimed at reducing juvenile delinquency could use this value of information framework to efficiently conduct further cost - effectiveness research .

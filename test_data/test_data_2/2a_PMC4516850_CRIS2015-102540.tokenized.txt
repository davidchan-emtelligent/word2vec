since its description over 250 years ago , diagnosis of esophageal perforation remains challenging , its management controversial , and its mortality high .
this rare , devastating , mostly iatrogenic , condition can quickly lead to severe complications and death due to an overwhelming inflammatory response to gastric contents in the mediastinum .
diagnosis is made with the help of esophagograms and although such tears have traditionally been managed via aggressive surgical approach , recent reports emphasize a shift in favor of nonoperative care which unfortunately remains controversial .
we here present a case of an iatrogenic esophageal tear resulting from a routine esophagoscopy in a 50 - year - old lady presenting with dysphagia .
the esophageal tear , almost missed , was eventually successfully managed conservatively , thanks to a relatively early diagnosis .
1. introduction esophageal perforation is a rare , devastating , and often life - threatening clinical condition [ 1 ] typically resulting from endoscopic procedures [ 2 ] .
this condition remains difficult to diagnose and manage and can quickly cause death without alarm [ 3 ] , owing to its nonspecific and varied clinical symptomatology [ 1 ] .
while surgery has been the mainstay of treatment , nonoperative management approaches for this condition are becoming more and more common [ 4 ] , but they remain controversial .
we present a case of an iatrogenic esophageal perforation that developed after a diagnostic esophagoscopy in a female patient with odynophagia and the subsequent conservative treatment after an almost missed diagnosis .
in view of the recent but controversial emphasis on nonoperative treatment , this case has been presented to add to the repertoire of success stories , thus encouraging nonoperative care , even in developing countries .
2. case report a 50 - year - old lady presented with dysphagia , odynophagia , and regurgitation of foods .
although an esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( ogd ) done previously had shown gastroesophageal reflux disease ( gerd ) , resolving esophagitis and gastritis , this new onset dysphagia warranted further examination .
a barium swallow , postnasal space and chest computed tomography ( ct ) scans were all normal .
an indirect laryngoscopy was attempted but unsuccessful due to a strong gag reflex and consequently a direct laryngoscopy and esophagoscopy were done .
the investigations revealed laryngeal erythema and gastric fundal erosion with no other abnormalities .
after esophagoscopy , she was successfully reversed , observed in the postanesthetic care unit , and eventually discharged to the ward in stable conditions .
in the ward , she suddenly developed severe epigastric pains , respiratory distress , and difficulty in speaking , for which she was given intravenous ( iv ) esomeprazole 80 mg and buscopan ( hyoscine butylbromide ) 40 mg for what appeared like acute exacerbation of gastritis .
she was also started on oxygen .
there being minimal improvement , she was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit , where close monitoring and oxygen therapy were continued .
further investigations included an electrocardiogram ( ecg ) and echocardiogram which were both normal and a ct scan of the chest which revealed severe basal pneumonia .
a gastrografin swallow was finally done ( figure 1 ) and showed leakage of the contrast into the mediastinum and left pleural cavity .
following the diagnosis of an esophageal perforation , a decision was made to manage the patient nonoperatively considering the relatively early diagnosis ( few hours after esophagoscopy ) .
a chest drain was inserted percutaneously and a nasogastric tube ( ngt ) inserted to rest the esophagus and drain the gastric contents .
she was kept nil per oral ( npo ) and was started on broad - spectrum iv antibiotics , oxygen , iv proton pump inhibitors , iv fluids , and analgesics .
a follow - up gastrografin swallow done on day 12 after esophagoscopy showed notable reduced leakage ( figure 2 ) .
later , a repeat ogd was carefully performed on day 14 to review the status of the injury and showed a 2 cm tear at 30 cm in the posterior wall that was contracting .
the patient showed good progress on conservative management and was transferred to the ward on day 15 .
feeding was gradually advanced from total parenteral to feeding via ngt to oral sips and finally solid meals before she was discharged home after about one month in stable conditions .
3. discussion esophageal perforation , reported as early as the 18th century ( hermann boerhaave , 1724 ) [ 5 ] , is a rare and often grave clinical condition [ 4 ] with high mortality rates over 40 % , especially in septic patients [ 6 ] .
while the true incidence is unclear [ 4 ] , the majority of esophageal rupture cases ( up to 59 %) are iatrogenic [ 1 ] resulting from esophagoscopy [ 2 ] despite the actual risk of esophageal perforation during endoscopy being low [ 2 , 7 ] .
boerhaave syndrome , a spontaneous esophageal rupture with no preexisting pathology , accounts for about 15 % of the cases [ 8 ] .
foreign - body ingestion accounts for 12 % of the cases , trauma 9 % , operative injury 2 % , tumors 1 % , and other causes 2 % [ 8 ] .
thoracic esophageal perforations occur frequently [ 1 , 8 ] and can lead to serious complications and death without alarm [ 3 , 9 ] , owing to the mediastinal contamination that ensues soon after the perforation [ 7 ] .
this contamination , which is exacerbated by the negative intrathoracic pressure that draws esophageal contents into the mediastinum [ 10 ] , evokes an overwhelming inflammatory response [ 11 ] leading to mediastinitis , initially chemical mediastinitis , followed by bacterial invasion and severe mediastinal necrosis [ 7 ] .
eventually , sepsis ensues leading to multiple - organ failure and death [ 3 , 4 ] .
the extent of this inflammation ( mediastinitis ) , and thus the morbidity and mortality of esophageal perforation , depends not only on the cause and location of the perforation but also on the time interval between onset and access to appropriate treatment [ 3 , 12 ] .
it has been shown that early detection reduces mortality by over 50 % [ 11 ] and treatment delays over 24 hours increase mortality significantly [ 13 ] .
unfortunately , prompt diagnosis continues to be exigent for most clinicians [ 5 ] .
diagnosis of esophageal perforation is challenging owing to a nonspecific and varied clinical presentation [ 1 ] that mimics a myriad of other disorders such as myocardial infarction and peptic ulcer perforation [ 14 ] .
patients may present with any combination of nonspecific signs and symptoms including fever , tachycardia , tachypnea , acute onset chest pain , dysphagia , vomiting , and shortness of breath [ 4 , 6 , 15 ] .
a high index of suspicion is therefore needed for recognition of esophageal perforation [ 5 ] .
once suspected , patients should be evaluated quickly with a combination of radiographs and esophagograms [ 8 , 14 ] .
accurate diagnosis may however require added investigations including computed tomography and flexible esophagoscopy [ 7 , 12 ] .
treatment of esophageal perforations remains a challenge [ 13 ] and the appropriate management is controversial [ 9 ] .
traditionally , surgery has been the mainstay of treatment [ 14 ] , but recent reports emphasize a shift in treatment strategies with nonoperative approaches becoming more common [ 4 , 9 ] .
it has been shown that , with careful patient selection , nonoperative management can be the treatment of choice for esophageal perforations [ 6 ] with good outcomes [ 9 , 12 , 15 , 16 ] .
altorjay et al .
[ 17 ] and others have suggested criteria for selection of nonoperative treatment including early perforations ( or contained leak if diagnosis delayed ) ; leak draining back to the esophagus ; nonseptic patients ; perforation not involving a neoplasm , abdominal esophagus , or distal obstruction ; and availability of an experienced thoracic surgeon and contrast .
when these established guidelines are followed , survival rates of up to 100 % have been reported [ 7 , 9 , 15 ] .
patients selected for nonoperative treatment are started on broad - spectrum antibiotics , intravenous fluids , oxygen therapy , adequate analgesia , and gastric acid suppression and kept nil by mouth in an intensive care unit [ 4 , 18 ] .
a nasogastric tube is placed to clear gastric contents and limit further contamination [ 9 ] and mediastinal contamination drained percutaneously / radiologically [ 18 ] via the chest tubes , thereby converting the esophageal perforations to esophagocutaneous fistulae that heal similar to gastrointestinal fistulae [ 6 ] .
apart from observation , the range of conservative management is growing , with the increasing use of endoscopic stents , clips , vacuum sponge therapy , and fibrin glue application [ 8 , 12 ] for the selected patients .
notably though , even with meticulous patient selection , up to 20 % develop multiple complications within 24 hours and require surgical intervention [ 2 , 7 ] .
in our patient , the diagnosis of an iatrogenic esophageal perforation was made relatively early and a multidisciplinary team chose conservative treatment as the treatment of choice given that the patient was not septic and had no contraindications to the treatment .
this was instituted without complications , achieving good results .
while there are few such reports in resource - limited settings , conservative management should be considered in the few hospitals with institutional capacities .

the purpose of this viewpoint is to provide rationale for the cellular investigation of blood flow restriction ( bfr ) in the absence of exercise , as this may provide a novel insight into the mechanisms exclusive to the restriction stimulus itself .
most of the research on bfr thus far has been completed with bfr in combination with low intensity resistance training .
to illustrate , bfr in combination with low intensity exercise has consistently been observed to result in improvements in muscle size and function ( loenneke et al. , 2012b ) .
however , there is also evidence suggesting that bfr in the absence of exercise results in favorable muscular adaptations ( takarada et al. , 2000a ; kubota et al. , 2008 ; kubota et al. , 2011 ) .
despite favorable effects of bfr in the absence of exercise , minimal mechanistic research exists on the bfr stimulus itself .
in contrast , several mechanistic studies have been completed with bfr in combination with resistance training .
to illustrate , previous research indicates that bfr combined with resistance exercise stimulates muscle protein synthesis ( mps ; fujita et al. , 2007 ; fry et al. , 2010 ; gundermann et al. , 2012 ) , although little is known about the exact cellular mechanisms associated with these changes in protein balance .
it has been suggested that low intensity resistance exercise combined with bfr produces a metabolic " overload " ( i.e. , depletion of phosphocreatine stores and decreases in muscle ph ) normally associated with higher muscle activations observed during high intensity resistance exercise ( takarada et al. , 2000b ; suga et al. , 2010 ) .
in addition , it has been recently observed that the benefits of bfr resistance exercise may , in part , be related to the concomitant decrease in the mrna gene expression of murf - 1 , atrogin , and myostatin ( manini et al. , 2011 ; laurentino et al. , 2012 ) .
three separate investigations have noted positive results from the application of bfr in the absence of exercise .
for example , takarada et al .
( 2000a ) observed that applying bfr ( 238 mmhg , 9 cm wide cuff ) to patients following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery effectively diminished the post operation disuse atrophy ( measured by mri ) of the knee extensors .
in support of this attenuating effect , kubota et al .
( 2008 ) found that applying bfr ( 200 mmhg , 7.7 cm wide cuff ) to a cast immobilized limb not only attenuates decreases in muscle size ( measured by leg circumference ) but also muscle strength .
however , a separate study from the same group indicated that a lower pressure of 50 mmhg reduced muscular weakness induced by chronic unloading , but had no effect on attenuating changes in leg size ( kubota et al. , 2011 ) .
interestingly , despite the published evidence , there has been no speculation on what mechanism ( s ) may be at work during bfr in the absence of an exercise stimulus .
instead , authors have applied the findings from mechanistic work completed on resistance exercise studies to explain results of the aforementioned bfr only studies .
although reductionism plays an important and useful role in science , there are numerous problems with using this approach to mechanistically understand the effects of bfr in the absence of exercise .
for example , the increases in electromyography ( emg ) activity observed with low intensity resistance exercise combined with bfr are greater than those observed with resistance exercise alone ( takarada et al. , 2000b ; yasuda et al. , 2009 ) .
one investigation found that the emg activity was 40 % lower when exercise was completed without bfr ( takarada et al. , 2000b ) .
using the aforementioned reasoning would lead one to suggest that part of the benefits observed with bfr in the absence of exercise are due to this increase in emg activity , however , in the absence of muscle contraction , there are no changes in emg activity .
furthermore , our unpublished data also suggests that no measurable changes occur in whole blood lactate , indicating that large changes in hydrogen ion concentration are likely not occurring with bfr in the absence of exercise .
the only two variables investigated that did change with bfr only were acute increases in real - time ultrasound measured muscle thickness and a decrease in hematocrit determined plasma volume .
these changes were maintained following the removal of the cuff suggesting that the acute changes in muscle thickness were actual acute increases in muscle size ( i.e. , muscle swelling ) and were not attributed to venous pooling .
this acute change in size has also been observed following low intensity bfr resistance training .
to illustrate , fry et al .
( 2010 ) observed greater acute increases in muscle size ( measured by circumference ) with bfr resistance exercise compared to resistance exercise without bfr .
interestingly , they too suggest that this might mechanistically explain part of the increase in mps they observed following bfr resistance exercise .
many hypotheses exist for the mechanism behind the beneficial effects observed with bfr ; however it may be necessary to research the effects of bfr in the absence of resistance exercise in order to allow for a clearer picture of what is physiologically occurring with the bfr stimulus itself .
we would like to suggest that acute muscle swelling may be the mechanism behind the reductions in muscle size and strength declines observed following surgery or cast immobilization .
in addition , this swelling may also help explain the increases in muscle size and strength previously observed from slow walking in combination with bfr ( abe et al. , 2006 ; ozaki et al. , 2011 ) .
although we have non - invasive data suggesting this is true , we are left to speculate as to how the acute increase in muscle size happens and how this acute increase in muscle size might lead to favorable changes in protein balance .
previous findings suggest that cellular dehydration may be involved in the down regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) signaling ( schliess et al. , 2006 ) .
therefore , if bfr can acutely increase the influx of water into the muscle cell , this may provide a stimulus capable of stimulating the mtor pathway .
it is acknowledged that this swelling hypothesis is largely dependent on research completed on hepatocytes ( loenneke et al. , 2012a ) ; therefore it is unknown how well this mechanism may translate over to human skeletal muscle .
future cellular research should attempt to determine whether or not muscle swelling plays a significant role in the muscle hypertrophic signaling response in humans , which would have important clinical implications for populations contraindicated to exercise .

diosgenin , a naturally occurring steroid saponin found abundantly in legumes and yams , is a precursor of various synthetic steroidal drugs .
diosgenin is studied for the mechanism of its action in apoptotic pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells .
based on dapi staining , diosgenin - treated cells manifested nuclear shrinkage , condensation , and fragmentation .
treatment of hepg2 cells with 40 mum diosgenin resulted in activation of the caspase - 3 , - 8 , - 9 and cleavage of poly - adp - ribose polymerase ( parp ) and the release of cytochrome c. in the upstream , diosgenin increased the expression of bax , decreased the expression of bid and bcl - 2 , and augmented the bax / bcl - 2 ratio .
diosgenin - induced , dose - dependent induction of apoptosis was accompanied by sustained phosphorylation of jnk , p38 mapk and apoptosis signal - regulating kinase ( ask ) - 1 , as well as generation of the ros .
nac administration , a scavenger of ros , reversed diosgene - induced cell death .
these results suggest that diosgenin - induced apoptosis in hepg2 cells through bcl - 2 protein family - mediated mitochndria / caspase - 3 - dependent pathway .
also , diosgenin strongly generated ros and this oxidative stress might induce apoptosis through activation of ask1 , which are critical upstream signals for jnk / p38 mapk activation in hepg2 cancer cells .
1. introduction diosgenin is a steroidal saponin , which is found in a variety of plants including fenugreek ( trigonella foenum graecum ) , roots of wild yam ( dioscorea villosa ) , solanum incaunm , and solanum xanthocarpum [ 1 ] .
it has been reported to have various effects , such as a hypocholesterolemic action in rat , or an antioxidant activity in hiv patients with dementia [ 2 , 3 ] .
diosgenin has been shown to exert anticancer effects against a wide variety of tumor cells , including breast cancer , colorectal cancer , osteosarcoma , and leukemia [ 4 - 7 ] .
the antitumor effects of diosgenin have been demonstrated to be mediated through activation of p53 , immune - modulation , cell cycle arrest , modulation of caspase - 3 activity , and induction of trail death receptor dr5 [ 8 - 10 ] .
a recent study has shown that diosgenin inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in hepg2 cells by inhibiting signal transducer and activator of transcription ( stat3 ) signaling pathway [ 11 ] .
apoptosis is a programmed cell death process that controls normal development and homeostasis in organisms .
the loss of apoptotic control contributes to the survival of tumor cells , and the enhancement of cancer cell apoptosis is one approach of controlling cancer by anticancer agents [ 12 ] .
at the biochemical level , apoptosis is mediated by the activation of a class of cysteine proteases called caspases .
in mammalian cells , caspase activation mainly occurs either through death receptor activation or mitochondrial membrane permeabilization [ 13 ] .
the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is regulated principally by the bcl - 2 protein family .
in response to apoptotic signals , bax , a proapoptotic member of the bcl - 2 family , is redistributed from the cytosol to the mitochondria .
conversely , overexpression of bcl - 2 protects apoptosis .
therefore , the ratio of expression of the proapoptotic bax protein and the antiapoptotic bcl - 2 protein ultimately determines cell death or survival in this mitochondrial death pathway [ 14 , 15 ] .
one of the well - known intracellular signaling pathways for apoptosis is the kinase cascade , which has been identified as a transducing pathway of apoptotic signals initiated by outside stimuli , mitogen - activated protein ( map ) kinases , and their upstream kinases such as map kinase kinases [ 16 ] .
many stimuli such as anticancer drugs , irradiation , tnf - alpha , and chemopreventive agents prompt cells to produce ros [ 17 , 18 ] .
it has been shown that ros induces a number of events including mitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapks ) signal transduction pathways in mediating apoptosis [ 19 , 20 ] .
apoptosis signal - regulating kinase ( ask ) - 1 is a member of the ros - sensitive map kinase kinases and it acts as a redox sensor of cells [ 21 ] .
ask 1 is activated in response to tnf - alpha , fas , and oxidative stress .
overexpression of inactive ask1 can inhibit tnf - alpha or fas - ligand - induced cell death [ 22 ] .
on the other hand , constitutively active ask1 overexpression has been shown to cause apoptosis through mitochondrial - dependent caspase activation [ 23 ] .
thus , ask1 appears to be a key player in the mapk ( p38 mapk / jnk ) control of cell death and cell survival .
diosgenin has been shown to target multiple pathways of tumorigenesis , including proliferation , apoptosis , angiogenesis , invasion , and tumor - induced immunosuppression in various tumor cells and in vivo cancer models [ 1 ] .
however , no reports exist in the literature elaborating the effect of diosgenin on ros - ask1 - mapk signaling cascade in hepg2 cells .
in this study , we investigated the involvement of ask1 in the apoptotic process of hepg2 cells treated with a chemopreventive agent , diosgenin .
here , we demonstrated that diosgenin strongly generated ros and this oxidative stress induced apoptosis through activation of ask1 , which are critical upstream signals for p38 mapk / jnk activation in hepg2 cancer cells .
2. material and methods 2.1 .
cell culture and drug treatment human hepatoma cell line ( hepg2 ) was cultured in rpmi ( gibco ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( gibco ) .
the cells were cultured at 37degreesc in a humidified chamber with 95 % air and 5 % co2 .
all experiments were performed in plastic tissue culture flasks ( falcon ) .
hepg2 cells were seeded on 24 well plates or 100 mm culture dishes .
after plating , cells were allowed to adhere overnight and were then treated with chemical .
diosgenin was purchased from sigma and stored at - 20degreesc .
diosgenin stock solutions were made in ethanol ( 100 %) and diluted in medium prior to use .
2.2 .
determination of cell viability ( mtt assay ) cell viability was determined by the mtt [ 3 - ( 4,5 - dimethylthiazol - 2yl ) - 2,5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide ] assay .
the cells were seeded in 24 - well plates at a density of 4 x 104 cells / well and treated with diosgenin at various concentration ( 0 - 40 mum ) for 24 h and 48 h. after the exposure period , media were removed .
thereafter , the medium was changed and incubated with mtt ( 0.1 mg / ml ) for 3 h. the viable cell number per dish is directly proportional to the production of formazan , which was solubilized in isopropanol , and measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm .
2.3 .
apoptosis assays fluorescence - associated cell sorting ( facs ) analysis was performed to discriminate between intact and apoptotic cells .
staining for fitc - labeled annexin v binding to membrane phosphatidylserine and propidium iodide ( pi ) binding for cellular dna was performed according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer ( boehringer mannheim ) .
briefly , cells ( 1 x 106 cells ) were suspended in buffer containing fitc - conjugated annexin v and pi at appropriate concentrations .
the samples were analyzed by facs vantage using cell quest software ( beckton dickinson ) and 20,000 events from each sample were acquired to ensure adequate data .
2.4 .
dapi staining cells ( 1 x 105 ) were plated onto 18 mm2 coverslips in flasks and cultured with complete medium .
after they were treated with diosgenin , the cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and were then washed with pbs .
cold methanol was added for another 20 min at room temperature followed by washes with pbs by three times .
the membrane permeable fluorescent dye dapi ( 2 mug / ml ) , which binds to chromatin of cells , was added to the fixed cells , and the cells were examined by an inverted olympus ix70 microscope ( japan ) .
apoptotic cells were identified by condensation and fragmentation of nuclei .
for each experiment , nuclei from 10 random fields of each coverslip were examined at x200 magnification .
2.5 .
western blot analysis after the indicated diosgenin treatment , the medium was removed , and the cells were rinsed with pbs twice .
after the addition of 0.6 ml of cold ripa buffer ( 10 mm tris ph 7.5 , 100 mm nacl , 1 mm edta , 0.5 % na - deoxycholate , 0.1 % sds , 1 % triton x 100 ) and protease inhibitors , cells were scraped followed at 4degreesc .
cell lysate was then subjected to a centrifugation of 14,000 x g for 15 min at 4degreesc .
resultant protein samples were separated by an sds - page gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidine difloride membrane ( pvdf , millipore ) membrane .
membrane was stained by ponceu to confirm uniform transfer of all samples and then incubated in blocking solution ( pbs with 0.05 % tween 20 and 5 % non fat dry - milk ) for 1 h at room temperature .
the antibodies used in this study , caspase - 3 , caspase - 8 , caspase - 9 , bcl - 2 , bax , bid and cytochrome c were obtained from santa cruz biotechnology inc ( santa cruz , ca ) , and p38 , jnk , phospho - p38 , and phosphor - jnk were purchased from upstate cell signaling .
the membrane was reacted firstly with desired primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature .
membrane was then incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody ( zymed ) for 1 h , washed with pbst , and developed using the ecl kit .
2.6 .
ros assay intracellular generation of ros was measured with carboxy - h2dcfda ( invitrogen ) , which is a cell - permeable and nonfluorescent dye when loaded onto the cells .
this compound is oxidized by ros to fluorescent carboxydichlorofluorescein ( dcf ) inside the cells .
briefly , the cells seeded in 6 - well plates ( 2 x 105 cells / well ) and treated with or without diosgenin were incubated with 5 mum carboxy - h2dcfda for 15 min at 37degreesc .
then the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) twice , trypsinized , and resuspended in optimem i medium .
the fluorescence resulting from the rate of oxidation of the dye in the cells was measured using a facs with an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. the generation of ros in hepg2 cells was also verified by fluorescence microscopy ( nicon , japen ) .
cells grown to confluence were treated with or without diosgenin in the presence of 5 mum carboxy - h2dcfda for the indicated time and resuspended in fresh optimem i medium after washing .
during fluorescence imaging , the illumination level was reduced to minimal level to prevent photosensitization of the fluorescent probe .
2.7 .
statistical analysis all experiments were performed in triplicates and the results were expressed as mean +/ - s.d. statistical significances were analyzed by one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) with duncan test .
p value <= 0.05 was considered statistically significant ( statstica 2.0 , usa ) .
3. results and discussion 3.1 .
cytotoxic effect of diosgenin on hepg2 cells a previous study has shown that diosgenin inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in hepg2 cells [ 11 ] .
to confirm whether diosgenin influences the viability of hepatoma cells , hepg2 cells were challenged with diosgenin ( 0 - 40 mum ) .
cytotoxicity is measured by mtt assay following a brief during exposure .
diosgenin markedly induced cell death in hepg2 cells in a dose - and time - dependent manner as compared with vehicle controls ( figure 1 ) .
apoptosis is initially characterized by morphological features , such as chromatin condensation , nuclear fragmentation , and membrane blebbing [ 24 ] .
in the current study , morphological changes of cell apoptosis such as condensation of chromatin and nuclear fragmentation were clearly observed by dapi staining after 24 h of diosgenin ( figure 1 ) .
cell death was also assessed with flow cytometry after double staining with annexin v and pi. we challenged the cells with increasing doses of diosgenin at 24 h of treatment .
according to figure 2 ( a ) , the combined early and late apoptotic cells ( annexin v positive ) were elevated in a dose - dependent fashion .
consistent with the progression of apoptosis , late apoptotic cells become dominant at later time , because we observed gradual diminution of early apoptotic cells and increment of the late apoptotic cells after 48 h ( figure 2 ( b )) .
these findings demonstrate that diosgenin induced the apoptosis of hepg2 cells in both dose - and time - dependent manners .
3.2 .
effect of diosgenin on activation of caspases and bcl - 2 family caspase activation is generally considered to be a key hallmark of apoptosis .
mitochondria are involved in a variety of key events leading to apoptosis , as releasing of caspase activators , the production of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , and participation in regulation of both pro - and anti - apoptotic bcl - 2 family proteins [ 8 ] .
in the next series of experiment , we assessed the effect of diosgenin on the cascade of caspases that are crucial initiators and effectors in various cell death pathways .
as shown in figure 3 ( a ) , diosgenin treatment activated caspase - 3 , caspase - 8 and caspase - 9 ( as shown by decreased procaspase - 9 and - 8 levels ) followed by subsequent parp cleavage .
bcl - 2 family proteins are crucial for apoptosis commitment , mainly via the control of the mitochondrial pathway which is frequently triggered in response to chemotherapeutic agents [ 25 ] .
elevated levels of bcl - 2 in tumor cells may contribute to chemoresistance by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane against apoptotic insult .
bax and bak are the critical effectors of apoptosis acting downstream of the both the prosurvival and bh3 - only members [ 26 ] .
the bh3 - only proteins ( bid , bim , puma , noxa ) are pro - apoptotic and act as sensors of specific types of cellular stress [ 27 ] .
thus , bcl - 2 family proteins may be good therapeutic targets .
to investigate the cellular mechanism underlying diosgenin - induced apoptosis in hepg2 cells , we analyzed the expression of apoptosis - regulated genes ; including pro - survial bcl - 2 , pore - forming bax and pro - apoptotic bid proteins .
as illustrated in figure 3 ( b ) , the expression level of bcl - 2 was gradually down - regulated as the diosgenin concentration increased .
in addition , diosgenin significantly induced the activation of bax and bid .
bid functions to receive death signals in the cytosol from upstream events and is cleaved to truncated bid ( tbid ; 15 ) .
upon translocation of bid to mitochondria , it induces the release of cytochrome c. from subsequent experiments , we observed a higher expression of cytochrome c. cytochrome c release is not a specific sign of apoptosis , which also occurs during necrotic cell death [ 28 ] .
however , our results also revealed the increased levels of caspases and bax and the decreased levels of bcl - 2 and bid .
these results indicate that diosgenin leads to a shift from antiapoptosis to proapoptosis by altering the function of the proteins in the bcl - 2 family , which results in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria .
3.3 .
diosgenin - induced apoptosis by the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) as reactive oxygen species ( ros ) generation is an important role in apoptosis , we investigated the ability of diosgenin to generate ros .
cells were exposed to diosgenin ( 0 - 40 mum ) for 24 hr and analyzed for the present of ros by flow cytometry the generation of ros by diosgenin was increased in dose - dependent manner ( figure 4 ( a )) .
we also confirmed intracellular ros production by fluorescence microscope after staining with carboxy - h2dcfda , ros were generated by treatment of diosgenin ( figure 4 ( b )) .
to examine whether diosgenin - generated ros induce apoptosis in hepg2 cells , we measured cell death after treatment of diosgenin only or with nac .
nac is a potent antioxidant that can inhibit oxidative stress by directly scavenging ros and replenishing gsh [ 29 ] .
if ros production mediates diosgenin - induced cell death , we expect that nac should have the ability to inhibit diosgenin - induced cell death .
as shown in figure 5 ( a ) , diosgenin ( 40 mum ) increased cell death , whereas removing diosgenin - generated ros by nac led to decreasing cell death .
also , the decrement of intracellular ros by treating nac was observed after dcfh - da staining ( figure 5 ( b )) .
these results indicate that diosgenin induced cell death of hepg2 cells by the generation of ros .
3.4 .
diosgenin - activated mapks and ask1 intracellular mapks are the major oxidative stress - sensitive signal transduction pathways [ 16 ] .
the major enzymes belonging to mapks are the extracellular signal regulating kinase 1 / 2 ( erk1 / 2 or p44 / 42 mapk ) , c - jun n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) , and p38 mapk .
jnk and p38 are stress - activated map kinases that are preferentially activated by cytotoxic stress , such as x - ray / uv irradiation , heat / osmotic shock , and oxidative / nitrosative stress [ 19 , 30 ] .
to identify the signaling pathways involved in diosgenin - induced cell death , hepg2 cells were treated with 40 mum diosgenin , and activation of mapks was determined by western blotting .
as illustrated in figure 6 ( a ) , p38 mapk and jnk activation in hepg2 cells was induced by diosgenin .
next , we measured the phosphorylation levels of ask1 for determining ask1 activation .
our results showed that ask1 phosphorylation was increased at 60 min , and sustained to 240 min by diosgenin ( figure 6 ( b )) .
ask1 is an upstream kinase of jnk and p38 mapk [ 31 ] .
jnk and p38 mapk are activated through ask1 in response to various extracelluar stimuli [ 21 , 32 ] .
the binding of ask1 to tnf receptor - associated factor or death domain - associated protein stimulates ask1 function , whereas the ask1 inhibitory proteins such as thioredoxin downregulate proapoptotic activity of ask1 [ 33 , 34 ] .
recent studies have suggested that ros - mediated ask1 activation is involved in a variety of disorders , such as inflammation [ 13 , 14 ] , neurodegeneration [ 15 , 16 ] , and cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling [ 18 , 19 ] .
it has already been reported that egcg and berberine executed apoptotic cell death via an ask1 and jnk / p38 cascade , which is induced by nac - sensitive intracellular oxidation or ros [ 35 - 37 ] .
in this study , diosgenin activated jnk , p38 mapk and ask1 as well as ros generation .
therefore , further studies on the mechanisms of regulation of ask1 activity and the development of ask1 - targeting drugs may contribute to the treatment of various diseases caused by oxidative stress .
4. conclusion in conclusion , the present data showed that diosgenin induced apoptosis in hepg2 cells through bcl - 2 protein family - ( bcl - 2 , bax , and bid ) - mediated mitochondria / caspase - 3 - dependent pathway .
also , diosgenin strongly generated ros and this oxidative stress might induce apoptosis through activation of ask1 , which are critical upstream signals for jnk / p38 mapk activation in hepg2 cancer cells .

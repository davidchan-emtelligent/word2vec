introduction cow 's milk allergy is the most frequent food allergy in europe and western countries and shows a wide spectrum of clinical features , including atopic dermatitis and gastrointestinal disease .
to the best of our knowledge , this report is the first to describe kawasaki disease - like clinical features and echocardiographic alterations which resolved after a cow 's milk - free diet .
case presentation we report a case of a 9 - month - old caucasian girl with atopic dermatitis who developed clinical features commonly present in kawasaki disease ( erythematous skin rash , non - exudative conjunctivitis , fissured lips and neck lymph nodes ) , together with mild echocardiographic alterations ( perivascular brightness , pericardial effusion ) in the absence of fever .
these features resolved within 2 weeks after the beginning of a cow 's milk - free diet .
conclusion kawasaki disease has recently been considered a possible risk factor for subsequent allergic disease secondary to immune dysfunction .
this case report suggests that the immune - related alterations which are commonly present in allergic patients could be similar to the antigen - related immune response in kawasaki disease and thus could lead to similar clinical features .
cow 's milk allergy kawasaki disease introduction cow 's milk allergy ( cma ) is an immunologically - mediated adverse reaction to several allergenic proteins present in cow 's milk which affects approximately 5 % to 7 % of children in the first years of life and 2 % to 3 % of adults [ 1 ] .
immunological mechanisms leading to this food allergy , which is the most frequent food allergy in europe and western countries , include immunoglobulin e ( ige ) - mediated hypersensitivity and cellular immune response .
cma is commonly a disease of early infancy , with children developing symptoms a few weeks after the introduction of cow 's milk - based formula into the diet .
the most common features of cma in the first years of life include atopic dermatitis and gastrointestinal diseases such as food protein - induced enterocolitis and allergic eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders [ 2 ] .
we report on a patient with atopic dermatitis and previously undiagnosed cow 's milk allergy who was admitted to our hospital with clinical , laboratory and echocardiographic findings frequently present in kawasaki disease ( kd ) .
the absence of fever , a leading feature in the diagnosis of kd , excluded such a diagnosis , and the presence of high specific serum ige towards cow 's milk , together with the negativity of other tests for several infectious diseases , suggested the role of cow 's milk allergy in the development of these symptoms .
case presentation a 9 - month - old caucasian girl was admitted to our hospital for the presence of a persistent skin rash and redness of the eyes .
her medical history was positive for mild atopic dermatitis present since 6 months of age .
in the 3 weeks prior to admission , she did not have fever .
her physical examination showed an erythematous rash involving the trunk and limbs , fissured lips , erythema of oral mucosa , bilateral conjunctival injection without eye discharge and laterocervical lymph nodes .
the respiratory and abdominal examinations were normal .
the cardiac evaluation showed tachycardia with normal heart sounds .
the laboratory results revealed a white blood cell count of 8500 / mm3 ( normal range : 3600 to 9600 / mm3 ) with normal differential counts , hemoglobin level of 10.7g / dl ( normal range : 11.5 to 14.5g / dl ) , platelet count of 376,000 / mm3 ( normal range : 150,000 to 350,000 / mm3 ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 35mm / hour ( normal range : 5 to 25mm / hour ) , c - reactive protein level 1.5mg / dl ( normal range : 0 to 1mg / dl ) , albumin level 2.8g / dl ( normal range : 3.5 to 5.5g / dl ) , alanine aminotransferase 24u / l ( normal range : 15 to 45u / l ) , aspartate aminotransferase 27u / l ( normal range : 20 to 55u / l ) , gamma - glutamyl transferase 59u / l ( normal range : 0 to 35u / l ) , direct bilirubin 0.4mg / dl ( normal range : 0.3 to 1mg / dl ) , igg 589mg / dl ( normal range : 380 to 790mg / dl ) , iga 34mg / dl ( normal range : 20 to 120mg / dl ) .
serum - specific ige against cow 's milk proteins were positive ( 12.5ku / l ; normal values : 0 to 0.35ku / l ) .
the blood culture , urine culture and serology for epstein - barr virus , cytomegalovirus , measles , rubella , parvovirus and adenovirus were all negative .
antistreptolysin antibodies were negative .
her chest radiogram was normal .
echocardiography performed at admission showed mild pericardial effusion and perivascular brightness of the proximal left descending coronary artery ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 echocardiographic findings : pericardial effusion and perivascular brightness of the proximal left descending coronary artery .
because of the absence of fever before and during the admission , the diagnosis of kd was excluded .
a cow 's milk - free diet was started 2 days after admission , which led to resolution of the clinical findings and normalization of the laboratory findings after 1 week .
a second echocardiography , performed 2 weeks after the beginning of the diet , was normal .
during the 2 weeks of the infant 's admission , she never presented fever , and no interventions other than the cow 's milk - free diet were necessary .
discussion the relationship between kd and atopy has been evaluated in a large cohort study which evidenced a significantly higher incidence of allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis in children who have had kd [ 3 ] .
matsuoka et al. proposed that the genetic predisposition to atopy could be associated with a higher susceptibility to kd. in addition , patients with kd tend to have a higher risk of developing atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis .
recently , a study of 93 sibling pairs supported the hypothesis of an inherited genetic pattern which increases the risk both of kd and atopy , secondary to an immune disequilibrium which leads to an abnormal inflammatory response to different trigger events [ 4 ] .
our report of a child who presented several clinical features of kd , together with mild cardiac echocardiographic alterations , both of which resolved after a cow 's milk protein - free diet , underlines the relationship between atopy and kd. although most of the clinical features we evidenced were non - specific , as can be present in several infectious diseases ( although in this child serological tests were negative for all pathogens causing similar findings ) , the association with echocardiographic alterations has not been reported previously in children with food allergies .
our data support the hypothesis that the same heritable genetic factors that induce a specific pattern of altered or impaired immune maturation could increase the risk of developing both kd and allergy .
conclusions kd has been considered a possible risk factor for subsequent allergic disease secondary to immune dysfunction .
we suggest that immune - related alterations which are commonly present in allergic patients such as those with cma may be similar to the antigen - related immune response in kd and thus could lead to similar clinical features .
to the best of our knowledge , this report is the first to describe kd - like clinical features and echocardiographic alterations which resolved after a cow 's milk - free diet .

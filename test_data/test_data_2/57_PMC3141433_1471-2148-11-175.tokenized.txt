background microhylidae is a geographically widespread family of anurans .
although several extensive molecular analyses have attempted to elucidate their subfamilial relationships , and correlate these with mesozoic and cenozoic continental drifts , consensus has not been reached .
further , generic level relationships have not been well investigated in some microhylid subfamilies , and therefore subfamilial affiliations of some genera are still unclear .
to elucidate the phylogenetic positions of two mysterious asian genera , gastrophrynoides and phrynella , and to better understand the trans - continental distributions of microhylid taxa , we performed molecular phylogenetic and dating analyses using the largest molecular dataset applied to these taxa to date .
results six nuclear and two mitochondrial genes ( approx. 8 kbp ) were sequenced from 22 microhylid frog species representing eight subfamilies .
the maximum likelihood and bayesian analyses could not fully elucidate the subfamilial relationships , suggesting a rapid radiation of these taxa between 85 and 66 million years ago .
in contrast , generic relationships of asian microhylines were generally well resolved .
conclusion our results clearly showed that one of two problematic asian genera , phrynella , was nested in the clade of the asian subfamily microhylinae. by contrast , gastrophrynoides occupied the most basal position of the australian - new guinean subfamily asterophryinae .
the estimated divergence of gastrophrynoides from other asterophryine was unexpectedly around 48 million years ago .
although a colonization scenario via antarctica to the australian - new guinean landmass has been suggested for asterophryinae , our finding suggested a novel colonization route via indo - eurasia .
background microhylidae is a large anuran family containing 487 species equivalent to 8 % of all frogs [ 1 ] .
this family belongs to the phylogenetically - nested anuran group , neobatrachia , and forms ranoides with afrobatrachia ( including the families , arthroleptidae , brevicipitidae , hemisotidae , and hyperoliidae ) and natatanura (= ranidae sensu lato ) .
members of the microhylidae occur in most continents and several large islands , i.e. , africa , eurasia ( not in the subcontinent of europe ) , south and north america , australia , new guinea , and madagascar .
since frost et al .
[ 1 ] , the subfamilial classification of this family had been largely modified based on new findings from several molecular phylogenetic studies [ 2,3 ] .
consequently , eleven microhylid subfamilies are now recognized [ 4 ] and each subfamily generally occurs in one landmass area derived from the gondwana supercontinent as follows : asterophryinae ( australia - new guinea ) ; cophylinae , dyscophinae , and scaphiophryninae ( madagascar ) ; gastrophryninae and otophryninae ( south and north america ) ; hoplophryninae and phrynomerinae ( africa ) ; and kalophryninae , melanobatrachinae , and microhylinae ( asia ) .
despite comprehensive phylogenetic studies , the subfamilial relationships have not been well elucidated ( see additional file 1 ) .
further , this family contains 12 genera for which subfamilial affiliations have not been investigated [ 4 ] .
the majority of these genera occur in south america , but two taxa are distributed in asia .
these mysterious genera contain only one to three species and difficulty in collecting them has prevented herpetologists from using them in phylogenetic study .
recently , we succeeded in obtaining specimens of the problematic asian genera , gastrophrynoides and phrynella .
originally , gastrophrynoides was a monotypic genus but the specimen used here is a newly found species of this genus ( g. immaculatus ) [ 5 ] .
because of their transcontinental distribution , microhylids have been regarded as an attractive research target for biogeography studies .
since savage [ 6 ] , several biogeographic scenarios that incorporate the plate tectonics theory and breaking up the gondwanan landmass , have been proposed to explain the trans - continental distribution of anuran taxa including microhylids [ 3 ] .
two molecular phylogenetic and dating analyses that aimed to elucidate the higher phylogeny , divergence ages , and formation process of the transcontinental distribution of microhylid taxa were recently performed [ 2,3 ] .
these studies that used different taxa and molecular data resulted in different relationships and divergence ages for microhylid subfamilies .
consequently , consensus on a biogeographic scenario to explain the microhylid distribution pattern has not been reached .
furthermore , although these studies proposed different colonization scenarios for many microhylid taxa , they agree on a similar antarctic route scenario for the australian - new guinean taxon ( asterophryinae ) , as suggested in other vertebrate taxa distributed in australia ( e.g. , marsupials , ratite bird , chelid turtles , and hyloid frogs [ 7 ]) .
it is generally considered that employing long sequence data , and increased taxon sampling in molecular phylogenetic inference , can clarify problematic phylogenetic relationships [ 8 - 10 ] .
thus , in this study , we sequenced two mitochondrial ( mt ) and six nuclear genes ( total 8 kbp ) from 22 microhylid specimens comprising eight out of 11 microhylid subfamilies , to determine the phylogenetic positions of the two problematic asian microhylid genera , and re - examine the phylogenetic relationships and divergence ages of microhylid subfamilies with the long sequence data and additional samples .
based on our finding for the phylogenetic position and divergence age of the genus gastrophrynoides , we advance a novel colonizing scenario for the australian - new guinean microhylids .
results and discussion molecular phylogenetic analyses the 35 specimens analyzed in this study are shown in table 1 .
briefly , we used 22 microhylid specimens from eight out of 11 known subfamilies , four afrobatrachians , five natatanurans , two hyloids , and two archaeobatrachians. from these specimens , we sequenced two mt and six nuclear genes approx. 8 kbp in total .

adding our data to that from two previous studies [ 2,3 ] , we produced the longest aligned dataset ( aln - 1 , 7164 nucleotide sites ) so far used with these taxa ( see methods section ) .
maximum likelihood ( ml ) and bayesian interference ( bi ) analyses were performed on this dataset .
the resultant ml tree is shown in figure 1 .
the bi tree recovered an identical topology , except that one branch that was resolved in the ml tree collapsed to a trichotomy in the bi tree ( see figure 1 ) .
our ml and bi trees strongly supported the monophyly of the family microhylidae , the monophyly of each microhylid subfamily ( sensu after frost et al .
[ 1 ]) , and the generic relationships within each subfamily ( with the exception of several microhyline genera , see below ) .
unfortunately , these trees could not fully elucidate subfamilial relationships ( see below ) .
figure 1 phylogenetic relationships of microhylids .
the ml tree ( - lnl = 77832.21 ) based on the aln - 1 dataset ( 7164 nucleotide sites from two mitochondrial and six nuclear genes ) is shown .
bootstrap probabilities of ml analysis (> 50 %) and bayesian post probabilities (* > 95 , ** > 99 %) are shown for each node .
" trichotomy " indicates the node condition in the corresponding bi trees .
the nodes of which split ages are discussed in the text are shown by roman numerals ( i - xi ) and the same node numbers are used in table 3 .
relationships of microhylid subfamilies the two most basal nodes among the microhylids , phrynomerinae and hoplophryninae , are both african in distribution .
the remaining subfamilies are divided into two clades .
one clade consists of two asian , one australian - new guinean , and one madagascan taxa , i.e. , kalophryninae + ( asterophryinae + ( dyscophinae + microhylinae )) .
the subfamilial relationships within this clade were well supported by bootstrap probabilities ( bps = 84 - 94 %) and bayesian posterior probabilities ( bpps = 100 %) .
the other clade includes one american and two madagascan taxa , gastrophryninae + ( cophylinae + scaphiophryninae ) .
the relationships within this clade and among the basal african taxa were not strongly supported by either bp or bpp values .
many alternative relationships have been suggested for these poorly - supported groups [ 1 - 3 , and see additional file 1 ] .
we evaluated these alternatives using the likelihood based approximately unbiased ( au ) and kishino - hasegawa ( kh ) tests and could not reject four of ten alternative relationships for the african , american , and madagascan taxa ( topologies 2 - 11 in table 2 ) .
considering the similar likelihood scores among our ml tree and the alternative topologies ( topologies 1 , 3 - 5 , and 11 in table 2 ) , the lack of statistical difference may be due to low phylogenetic signal in the dna sequences due to ancient rapid divergences of these microhylid taxa ( 85 - 66 ma ; see below ) .

in our trees , the kalophryninae + ( asterophryinae + ( dyscophinae + microhylinae )) clade seems to be well resolved .
for these taxa , our dataset ( aln - 1 ) was able to reject most alternative relationships proposed in previous studies ( topologies 12 - 16 in table 2 ) .
however , an alternative kalophryninae position suggested by van der meijden et al .
[ 3 ] could not be rejected ( topology 14 in table 2 ) .
furthermore , when we used a data subset ( aln - 3 ) that contained a member of the subfamily melanobatrachinae not present in the aln - 1 dataset , a different kalophryninae position , melanobatrachinae + ( cophylinae + kalophryninae )) , was recovered ( additional file 1 ) .
this suggests that the melanobatrachini data affected the kalophryninae position .
in contrast to the kalophryninae case , the asterophryinae + ( dyscophinae + microhylinae ) clade was well supported by two data subsets having different taxon samplings ( aln - 2 and 3 ; additional file 1 ) .
two recent molecular phylogenetic studies also suggested this clade and the relationships within [ 3,4 ] .
thus , the monophyly of these australian - new guinean , madagascan , and asian taxa seems to be well established .
phylogenetic positions of mysterious microhylid genera in this study , two asian genera , phrynella and gastrophrynoides , of which subfamilial affiliations have not been investigated , were analyzed .
our ml and bi trees resulted in the genus phrynella being nested in the asian subfamily microhylinae ( figure 1 ). by contrast , the genus gastrophrynoides did not become a member of the asian group , rather this taxon possessed the most basal position of the members of the australasian - new guinean subfamily , asterophryinae ( ml bp and bpp = 100 %) .
the au and kh tests clearly rejected the " non - monophyly of gastrophrynoides and asterophryines " ( p < 0.01 ; topology 17 in table 2 ) .
furthermore , the most basal position of gastrophrynoides among asterophryines was also supported by our data subsets ( aln - 2 and 3 ; ml bps = 100 % and bpps = 100 % , see additional file 1 ) .
consequently , our analyses clearly elucidated the phylogenetic positions of these problematic asian genera .
around the same time as this study , matsui et al .
[ 11 ] suggested the phrynella position within microhylinae and a close relationship of gastrophrynoides with asterophryinae from their analyses using 12s and 16s gene data .
the synapomorphy of the subfamily asterophryinae is direct developing eggs [ 1 ] .
although the breeding ecology of the genus gastrophrynoides is not known , the pigment - less eggs and rudimentary webbings in g. borneensis [ 12 ] suggest direct development .
thus , we transiently regard this genus as a member of the subfamily asterophryinae .
furthermore , the distribution of another asterophryine genus , oreophryne , in islands of south - east asia ( e.g. , philippines , sulawesi , and bali ) has been noted [ 4,13 ] .
however , asterophryine species have not been reported from mainland eurasia .
thus , g. immaculatus from the malay peninsula is the first record of the occurrence of a species belonging to the asterophryine lineage in mainland eurasia .
generic relationships within microhylinae this study contains the first molecular phylogenetic analysis that covers all known microhyline genera ( in aln - 3 data subset , see additional file 1 ) .
our analyses largely elucidated the phylogenetic relationships of microhyline genera , excluding the positions of kaloula spp. , chaperina , and micryletta ( see below ) .
the ml and bi trees from the aln - 1 dataset obtained the two major clades for microhyline genera with good statistical support : the microhyla + ( calluella + glyphoglossus ) clade and the clade including kaloula , metaphrynella , phrynella , and ramanella ( figure 1 ) .
in the latter clade , the monophyly of metaphrynella and phrynella was strongly suggested ( ml bp and bpp = 100 %) .
our data subsets also supported this clade ( additional file 1 ) .
thus , the precise phylogenetic position of the genus phrynella within the subfamily microhylinae is clearly elucidated .
it is noteworthy that our analyses suggested the polyphyly of the genus kaloula ( figure 1 ) .
the au and kh tests clearly rejected the monophyly of this genus ( data not shown ) .
our data subsets and the analyses of van bocxlaer et al .
[ 2 ] also suggested that kaloula as currently delimited is not a natural group ( additional file 1 ) .
because k. pulchra ( one of the two kaloula species used here ) is the type species of the genus kaloula , the generic name of k. taprobanica might be altered in a future study .
divergence times of microhylid taxa using two data subsets ( aln - 2d and aln - 3d ) for which we had greater taxon sampling and our ml tree topology ( see additional file 2 ) , we estimated divergence times .
three distinct combinations of calibration points were applied for each dataset , for a total six dating calculations ( a - f ) .
the estimated divergence times from these calibrations are summarized in table 3 , and the detailed results are shown in additional file 3 .

* 1they used two distinct dating methods and many distinct calibration point settings .
the ages listed here were from the bayesian molecular clock method and a calibration point setting ( without point g ) used as main result in their paper .

* 4corresponding to the split of otophryninae from other microhylids occurred between ii and vi. similar divergence ages of microhylid taxa were estimated from the six calibrations ; for most microhylid nodes , the median age estimated from one calibration was overlapped by the 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) values from the other calibrations .
the exceptions were several node ages that differed between the calibrations a and f. the average ages ( and mean difference = md ) of the six calibrations for major microhylid divergence events are as follows ( table 3 ) .
( i ) 132.6 ma ( md = 9.6 ) for the split of microhylids from other ranoids .
( ii ) 84.8 ma ( md = 8.4 ) for the initial divergence of extant microhylid subfamilies ( i.e. , split of phrynomerinae from other microhylids ) .
( iii ) 81.7 ma ( md = 8.2 ) for the divergence of hoplophryninae from the remaining microhylid subfamilies .
( iv ) 78.4 ma ( md = 8.1 ) for split of the gastrophryninae + ( cophylinae + scaphiophryninae ) lineage .
( v ) 75.3 ma ( md = 7.9 ) for the split of kalophryninae from the asterophryinae + ( dyscophinae + microhylinae ) clade .
( vi ) 70.6 ma ( md = 7.7 ) for the splits of asterophryinae from the dyscophinae + microhylinae clade .
( vii ) 67.2 ma ( md = 7.6 ) for the split of dyscophinae and microhylinae .
( viii ) 76.0 ma ( md = 7.9 ) for the split of gastrophryninae from the cophylinae + scaphiophryninae clade .
( ix ) 66.3 ma ( md = 6.8 ) for the split of cophylinae and scaphiophryninae .
( x ) 47.8 ma ( md = 5.4 ) for the split of gastrophrynoides from asterophryine genera .
( xi ) 24.5 ma ( md = 5.4 ) for the initial divergence of asterophryine genera ( excluding gastrophrynoides ) .
additional calibrations ( g - j ) based on two alternative topologies ( the ml topologies inferred from the aln - 2 and aln - 3 data subsets ) also estimated similar ages for these microhylid divergences ( additional files 4 and 5 ) .
two previous molecular dating studies ( table 3 ) have focused on these taxa .
our divergence times are similar to those from van bocxlaer et al .
[ 2 ] , but are slightly older than those from van der meijden et al .
[ 3 ] .
based on our estimations , the microhylid subfamilies diverged between 85 and 66 ma ( nodes ii - ix in table 3 and figure 1 ) .
these estimated ages suggest a rapid radiation of major microhylid lineages , within less than 20 ma during the late cretaceous .
according to traditional plate - tectonic theory , gondwanan landmasses ( africa , south america , madagascar - india , and australia ) had already fragmented (=~ 100 ma [ e.g. , 14 ]) by this time .
thus , although several vicariance hypotheses based on gondwanan fragmentation have been proposed for the trans - continental distribution of microhylids [ see 3 ] , our results can definitively reject a strictly vicariant scenario .
rather , our estimated dates fit a dispersal hypotheses ( including overseas dispersal ) [ 3 ] and / or the prolonged existence of land connections among the fragmented gondwana landmasses [ 2 ] .
colonization route of australian - new guinean taxa this study could not resolve relationships among many microhylid subfamilies .
however , the clade of madagascan dyscophinae + asian microhylidae and the sister relationship of australian - new guinean asterophryinae with this clade are well established .
furthermore , we revealed that the genus gastrophrynoides , which is only found in areas derived from the eurasian landmass ( borneo and the malay peninsula ) , occupies the most basal phylogenetic position among asterophryines , and this taxon split from other asterophryine lineages during the eocene ( around 48 ma ) .
an antarctic route ( across a land bridge existing until 55 ma or less [ e.g. , 13 ]) has been postulated by two independent studies [ 2,3 ] as the colonization route of asterophryinae into the australian - new guinean landmass .
however , our new phylogenetic placement of the genus gastrophrynoides and the estimated divergence times of gastrophrynoides from its related taxa seem to suggest an alternative colonization pathway , from asia to the new guinean landmass , for asterophryinae ( figure 2 ) .
in this context , the lineage split between asterophryinae and microhylinae ( and dyscophinae ) occurred in the indian landmass during the late cretaceous ( around 70 ma ) , and these ancestors colonized asia by the collision of india and eurasia .
the lineages of gastrophrynoides and other asterophryines split during the eocene ( around 48 ma , the same time as the date of the collision ) .
then , the ancestor of major asterophryines moved from asia to the australian - new guinean landmass via islands and / or short sea straits around the late oligocene ( 25 ma ) when both landmasses had been closing , and southeast asian islands had been uplifting [ 15 ] .
if the ancestor had acquired the direct development characteristics , the synapomorphy of asterophryines , which can eliminate the use of a freshwater environment for the egg and tadpole development , oversea dispersal of this ancestor would have occurred relatively easily [ 16 ] .
finally , radiation of asterophryines mainly occurred in the new guinean area and several lineages moved to australia .
figure 2 possible colonization route for asterophryine microhylids .
a colonization route hypothesis for asterophryinae suggested from this study is shown on a schematic paleogeographic map ( around 50 ma ) .
compared with the antarctic route , our proposed scenario accounts well for the very low species diversity of asterophryines in australia ( 19 species , only 7 % of all asterophryines [ 13 ]) relative to that on new guinea and for the recent divergence time of asterophryines (< 25 ma ) , both of which are difficult to explain in the antarctic scenario [ 3 ] .
furthermore , to explain the placement of gastrophrynoides under the antarctic scenario , one would have to assume long - distance overseas dispersal of the gastrophrynoides lineage from australia to asia during the eocene , when the southeast asian islands had not yet formed , followed by the extinction of basal asterophrynine taxa ( including the gastrophrynoides lineage ) only in australian and new guinean areas .
a weakness of our asian route scenario is a lack of confidence in the sister taxon of the asterophryinae + ( dyscophinae + microhylinae ) clade , the limited taxon sampling of asterophryines in our analyses , and the absence of other basal taxa belonging to the asterophryine lineage in other asian areas , especially in india .
thus , to support our hypothesis , further phylogenetic studies , ideally supplemented by the discovery of new fossils , and more comprehensive surveys for living microhylids in asian areas will be necessary .
undoubtedly , the discovery of the unique taxon gastrophrynoides from asian area has revealed a new concept for the asterophryine evolution .
further this finding has significance to show the possible presence of further microhylid taxa with unexpected evolutionary backgrounds and give a basis for future paleontological and biogeographic studies of asian anurans .
conclusions in this study , we performed phylogenetic analyses for higher microhylid taxa with the largest molecular data so far applied .
our results clearly indicate that one of two problematic asian genera , phrynella , is a member of the asian subfamily microhylinae. by contrast , gastrophrynoides possesses the most basal position of the australian - new guinean subfamily asterophryinae ( figure 1 ) , and it is estimated that gastrophrynoides split from other asterophryine occurred around 48 ma ( table 3 ) .
the presence of the most basal asterophryine taxon in the eurasian area suggests the colonization route from asia to australia for asterophryines ( figure 2 ) , although a colonization scenario via antarctica to the australian - new guinean landmass has been suggested for asterophryinae .
the biogeographic findings on gastrophrynoides imply the possible occurrence of further microhylid taxa with unexpected evolutionary backgrounds and give a basis for future paleontological and biogeographic studies of asian anurans .
methods taxonomic names and frog specimens used since frost et al .
[ 1 ] , taxonomic ranks and names of many anuran taxa including microhylids have changed frequently .
to avoid needless confusion , in this paper , taxonomic ranks and names followed frost et al .
[ 1 ] and frost [ 4 ] , respectively .
the 35 specimens analyzed here are shown in table 1 .
pcr and sequencing total genomic dna was extracted from muscle tissue of each specimen using a dneasy tissue kit ( qiagen ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol. from the total dna , partial portions of two mt genes , 16s ribosomal rna ( 16s , approx. 0.9 kbp ) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit i ( cox1 , approx. 0.8 kbp ) , and six nuclear encoding genes , brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf , approx. 0.7 kbp ) , chemokine receptor 4 ( cxcr4 , approx. 0.7 kbp ) , na +/ ca2 + exchanger ( ncx1 , approx. 1.3 kbp ) , recombination - activating proteins 1 and 2 ( rag1 and rag2 , approx. 1.6 and 1.2 kbp , respectively ) and tyrosinase ( tyr , approx. 0.7 kbp ) , were amplified by pcr .
these gene portions cover almost all sequence regions of the alignment data used in two previous molecular phylogenetic studies of microhylids ( 16s , ncx1 , cxcr4 , and rag1 [ 2 ] ; cox1 , bdnf , tyr , rag1 and rag2 [ 3 ]) , and the amplification primers used here basically followed these studies .
the detailed sequences of pcr and sequencing primers are available upon request ( to ak ) .
pcr mixtures were prepared with an ex - taq kit ( takara bio ) or a kod - fx kit ( toyobo ) according to the manufacturer 's protocols .
the resultant pcr fragments were purified by exosap - it for pcr clean - up kit ( us biochemical ) and ethanol precipitation .
the gene sequences were directly determined from the purified pcr fragments with a bigdye ( r ) terminator cycle sequencing kit and an automated dna sequencer ( abi3130xl , applied biosystems ) .
the resultant sequence data were deposited in the dna databases ( table 1 ) .
molecular phylogenetic analyses to perform phylogenetic analyses , we produced a long alignment dataset ( aln - 1 ) and two data subsets ( aln - 2 and aln - 3 ) by combining our data with that from van bocxlaer et al. and / or van der meijden et al .
[ 2,3 ] ( additional file 6 ) .
the long dataset ( aln - 1 ) made from the data of all three studies includes a long sequence ( 7164 nucleotide sites in total ) of eight gene partitions of 42 taxa ( 29 microhylids from nine subfamilies , six afrobatrachians , five natatanurans , and two hyloids ) .
among these two data subsets , the aln - 2 has a middle length sequence ( 4122 nucleotide sites ) of five gene portions from 82 otus consisting of 53 microhylids from ten subfamilies , eight afrobatrachians , seven natatanurans and three hyloids , six archaeobatrachians , a caudate , and four other vertebrates .
in aln - 2 , cox1 sequences of non - neobatrachian taxa were not used because of the fast nucleotide substitution rate of this gene [ 3 ] .
the aln - 3 data subset includes four gene portions ( 2813 nucleotide sites ) from 63 taxa consisting of 44 microhylids from ten microhylid subfamilies , eight afrobatrachians , nine natatanurans , and two hyloids .
more detailed information of used taxa and sequences in each alignment data are summarized in the additional file 7 .
to make these alignments , we initially aligned each gene portion by using muscle [ 17 ] implemented in seaview ver .
3.2 [ 18 ] .
the resultant alignments were revised by eye using amino acid alignments as the guide .
for 16s data , ambiguous alignment sites were removed by using gblocks ver .
0.91 b [ 19 ] with a default parameter .
then , each gene portions were concatenated to make the above alignment datasets .
the datasets used in this study are available from additional file 8 .
based on the long dataset ( aln - 1 ) and two data subsets ( aln - 2 and 3 ) , phylogenetic trees were constructed by the ml and bi methods .
heterozygous nucleotides occasionally found in nuclear gene sequences were deleted ( and assign as missing data ) .
gaps in the alignments were treated as missing data .
for ml and bi analyses , partitioned models were applied .
the most appropriate substitution model for each gene portion was estimated based on the akaike and bayesian information criteria ( aicc1 and bic1 [ 20,21 ]) implemented in kakusan3 [ 22 ] for ml and bi analyses , respectively .
in ml analyses , the parameters for nucleotide frequencies , gamma distribution ( g ; with eight categories ) , and proportion of invariable sites were estimated by treefinder program ver. oct .
2008 [ 23 ] .
the estimated best - fit models for each partition are shown in additional file 6 .
the ml analyses were performed using the treefinder , and bp values were calculated with 1000 pseudo - replications .
the bi analyses were performed using mrbayes ver .
3.1.2 [ 24 ] .
two independent runs of four markov chains were conducted for 11 million generations for all datasets ( sampling frequency was one tree per 100 generations for every datasets ) .
parameter estimates and convergence were checked with tracer ver .
1.4 [ 25 ] , and the first 1 million trees and first 3 million trees were discarded for aln - 1 and 2 data and aln - 3 data , respectively .
node credibility of the bi tree was evaluated by bayesian posterior probabilities ( bpp ) .
two hyloids ( agalychnis callidryas and bufo japonicus ) and zebrafish ( danio rerio ) were employed as outgroups in the analyses based on aln - 1 and - 3 data and aln - 2 data , respectively .
our ml tree topology and alternative microhylid phylogenies suggested by previous studies [ 1 - 3 ] were compared in an ml framework using approximately unbiased ( au ) and kishino - hasegawa ( kh ) tests [ 26,27 ] implemented in treefinder .
for the phylogenetic position of gastrophrynoides , alternative topologies having high lnl scores were searched under the " non - monophyly of gastrophrynoides and asterophryines " constraint .
in this analysis , we used " are not " option of tree constraint command implemented in paup4.0 b [ 28 ] .
among the trees obtained under this constraint , one topology with the highest lnl score was also tested ( topology 17 in table 3 ) .
molecular dating divergence time estimations using a bayesian molecular clock method were conducted as in previous molecular dating analyses on microhylids [ 2,3 ] .
we used two combinations of an alignment dataset and a topology , aln - 2d + tree1a and aln - 3d + tree1b ( see below ) .
three sets of calibration points were applied to each combination ( see below ) for a total six dating analyses ( calibration a - f ) .
the topology and the applied calibration points in each calibration are shown in additional file 2 and the alignment datasets used are available in additional file 8 .
the first alignment dataset used ( aln - 2d ) is basically the same with the aln - 2 but cox1 and tyr sequences were removed from the original aln - 2 .
this is because these genes are unsuitable for molecular dating of microhylid subfamilies ( due to high nucleotide substitution rates [ 3 ]) , and the tyr sequences did not allow us to calculate variance - covariance matrices of branch lengths for the designated topology ( tree1a ) , possibly due to many nodes lacking supporting nucleotide changes .
thus , aln - 2d only contains rag - 1 , rag - 2 and bdnf sequences ( 2970 nucleotide sites in total ) .
the other alignment data ( aln - 3d ) is similar to aln - 3 but this data contains a larger number of otus ( total 101 ) to allow us to employ broad calibration points that were used in van bocxlaer et al .
[ 2 ] .
the aln - 3d ( 2739 sites in total ) is slightly shorter than the original aln - 3 because of increment of ambiguous alignment sites due to adding otus .
zebrafish ( danio rerio ) was employed as outgroup for both aln - 2d and - 3d analyses .
the two tree topologies ( tree1a and tree1b ) used in the age calibrations were modified from the ml trees of aln - 2 and aln - 3 datasets , respectively ; they have the ml topology of aln - 1 (= figure 1 ) for microhylids , natatanurans , and afrobatrachians ( see additional file 2 ) , while all other relationships were as inferred for the respective datasets .
a total 14 calibration points , based on nine fossil records ( f1 - 9 ) and five paleogeographic events ( g1 - 5 ) , were applied in this study as indicated below .
f1 : > 330 ma , split of lissamphibia and amniota ( fossil of the earliest aistopod ) .
f2 : 338 - 312 ma , split of diapsida and synapsida ( fossils of early diapsids and synapsids ) .
f3 : > 230 ma , split of anura and caudata ( fossil of triadobatrachus ) .

g1 : > 110 ma , split of pipa and xenopus ( fragmentation of the african and south american landmasses ) .
g2 : > 65 ma , split of dyscophinae and microhylinae ( fragmentation of india and madagascar ) .
g3 : > 42 ma , split of agalychnis and litoria ( fragmentation of australia and south america ) .
g4 : < 15 ma , blommersia wittei and b. sp .
" comoro " ( formation of comoro islands ) .
g5 : > 5 ma , alytes muletensis and a. dickhilleni ( the mediterranean salinity crisis ). with the exception of f9 , these calibration points were applied in van bocxlaer et al .
[ 2 ] and / or van der meijden et al .
[ 3 ] .
the minimum ages of f1 and f2 were adjusted from those used by van der meijden et al .
( from 338 and 288 to 330 and 312 , respectively ) based on more recent information [ 30 ] .
also to accommodate more recent information , the minimum divergence times of f2 and f3 were changed from the original values used by van bocxlaer et al .
( from 306.1 and 245.0 to 312 and 230 , respectively ) .
seven calibration points , ( f1 - f3 , f8 , and g1 - g3 ) were applied in calibrations a and d. the seven points ( f1 - f3 , g1 , and g3 - g5 ) previously used in van der meijden et al .
[ 3 ] , plus f9 , were applied in calibration b. six points ( f1 - f3 and f7 - f9 ) consisting of only fossil evidences were applied in calibration c. nine points ( f1 - 8 and g2 ) previously used in van bocxlaer et al .
[ 2 ] were applied in calibration e. eight fossil points ( f1 - 8 ) were applied in calibration f. the age calibrations were performed using software packages paml ver .
4 [ 31 ] and multidivtime [ 32 ] .
in all calibrations , optimized branch lengths with their variance - covariance matrices of each alignment data were estimated for each gene partition ( i.e. , multiple loci analysis ) with an f84 + g model ( similar to the best model among available models in multidivtime ) using estbranches program .
parameters used in the model were estimated by paml .
to estimate divergence times , markov chains were conducted for 10 million cycles with one per 100 sampling frequency and 10 % burn - in for all six calibrations .
four additional dating analyses ( calibrations g - j ) were performed using two distinct tree topologies (= the topologies of maximum likelihood trees from aln - 2 and aln - 3 datasets ; see additional file 4 ) .
the procedures of these calculations were much the same as the above but 3 million markov chain cycles were conducted for these additional calculations .

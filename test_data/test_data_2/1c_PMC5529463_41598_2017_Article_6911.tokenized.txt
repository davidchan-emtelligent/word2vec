this is the first report on the development of a covalently bone morphogenetic protein - 2 ( bmp2 ) - immobilized hydrogel that is suitable for osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells ( hplscs ) .
o - propargyl - tyrosine ( opgy ) was site - specifically incorporated into bmp2 to prepare bmp2 - opgy with an alkyne group .
the engineered bmp2 - opgy exhibited osteogenic characteristics after in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hplscs , indicating the osteogenic ability of bmp2 - opgy .
a methoxy polyethylene glycol - ( polycaprolactone - ( n3 )) block copolymer ( mc - n3 ) was prepared as an injectable in situ - forming hydrogel .
bmp2 covalently immobilized on an mc hydrogel ( mc - bmp2 ) was prepared quantitatively by a simple biorthogonal reaction between alkyne groups on bmp2 - opgy and azide groups on mc - n3 via a cu ( i ) - catalyzed click reaction .
the hplscs - loaded mc - bmp2 formed a hydrogel almost immediately upon injection into animals .
in vivo osteogenic differentiation of hplscs in the mc - bmp2 formulation was confirmed by histological staining and gene expression analyses .
histological staining of hplsc - loaded mc - bmp2 implants showed evidence of mineralized calcium deposits , whereas hplsc - loaded mc - cl or bmp2 - opgy mixed with mc - cl , implants showed no mineral deposits .
additionally , mc - bmp2 induced higher levels of osteogenic gene expression in hplscs than in other groups .
in conclusion , bmp2 - opgy covalently immobilized on mc - bmp2 induced osteogenic differentiation of hplscs as a noninvasive method for bone tissue engineering .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction bone morphogenetic proteins ( bmps ) are some of the most commonly used growth factors in orthopedic applications1 , 2 .
bmps have the u.s. food and drug administration approval for clinical treatments for mainly spine fusion including long bone fracture fixation , ankle fusion , and vertebral fracture repair3 .
among the bmps , bmp2 can cause more bone overgrowth than other bmps4 .
bmp2 can regenerate bone through osteogenic differentiation of osteoblast progenitors or stem cells5 .
clinical administration of bmp2 has sometimes required focal repeated exposures to bmp2 at supra - physiological doses to achieve the biologic activity needed for remedial effects because of its comparatively short half - life in vivo 6 .
this repeated administration at supra - physiological doses is costly and may also lead to unfavorable side effects , including excessive remedial effects and adverse immune responses7 .
a number of attempts to develop alternative drug delivery formulations have been made to minimize unfavorable side effects and to optimize the remedial effects of bmp28 - 10 .
generally , bmp2 can be loaded in drug delivery formulations by simple mixing ( physical adsorption via non - covalent bonding ) .
as an example , a bmp2 protein that includes a material - binding motif and heparin - grafted materials for interaction with bmp2 has been developed .
the approach allows timed release through intermolecular interactions between the materials and bmp211 , 12 .
however , bmp2 does not remain in a bmp2 - loaded carrier after a certain period of time13 .
the content and conformation of bmp2 cannot be precisely controlled after physical adsorption .
in certain cases , physical adsorption may not provide bmp2 efficacy and stability for the needed period of time14 .
it is conceivable that covalent immobilization of bmp2 on a drug carrier could allow sufficient and sustained administration of bmp2 to maintain physiological levels and prolong its half - life15 , 16 .
however , this method usually requires a functional group to anchor the bmp2 directly to the drug carrier material .
thus , a carrier material and bmp2 with specific functional groups are required .
usually , the nucleophiles of natural amino acids such as amine or sulfohydryl have been used to conjugate bmp217 .
however , there is more than one reactive group in bmp2 , and this method might suffer from poor site - specificity and heterogeneous products .
in addition , non - specific chemical modifications can result in inactivation of proteins or their incorrect orientation18 - 21 .
to address these issues of previous methods , we incorporated abiological amino acids into the target bmp2 protein .
several laboratories have developed methods to produce recombinant proteins with unnatural amino acids22 , and we focused on the orthogonal trnacua ( mjtrnacua ) and tyrosyl - trna synthetase ( mjtyrrs ) pairs from methsanococcus jannaschii 23 .
these pairs have been engineered to incorporate various unnatural amino acids into the tag stop codon24 - 27 , and a number of successful applications of the system have been reported21 , 28 - 31 .
among the amino acid analogues , we chose o - propargyl - tyrosine ( opgy ) for incorporation into the target bmp2 ( bmp2 - opgy ) .
thus , the first aim of this work was to design and prepare bmp2 - opgy engineered with an alkyne group and then to examine its ability to induce osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells ( hplscs ) .
in recent years , several click reactions have been used for rapid chemical reactions at physiologically relevant conditions32 .
among the click reaction , the cu ( i ) - catalyzed reaction between alkyne and azide groups can cause a rapid bioorthogonal reaction in aqueous media as well as under physiological conditions33 .
thus , we hypothesized that the bmp2 - opgy prepared with an alkyne group could be used in a click reaction to achieve a bioorthogonal reaction .
injectable in situ - forming hydrogels appear to be a promising drug carrier .
these hydrogels can incorporate various biologic components such as cells , growth factors , and drugs , simply by mixing at room temperature ( rt ) 34 .
furthermore , injectable hydrogels can be administrated by a simple injection , resulting in only minor discomfort for the patient .
recently , we reported a methoxy polyethylene glycol - polycaprolactone block copolymer ( mpeg - pcl [ mc ]) as an injectable in situ - forming hydrogel for the delivery of several biologic factors35 - 39 .
because aqueous solutions of mc exhibited the solution to gelation transition at body temperatures , subcutaneous injection of an mc solution into an animal resulted in the rapid formation of a hydrogel depot .
if we added bmp2 into the mc solution , the mc hydrogel loaded with bmp2 via physical adsorption did not remain in the mc hydrogel after a certain treatment time40 , 41 .
we hypothesized that an azide group on an mc carrier could covalently immobilize bmp2 - opgy on that carrier .
thus , the second aim of this work was to design and prepare an azide - modified mc hydrogel and then to exploit the click reaction between the alkyne group of bmp2 - opgy and azide group of mc in order to create a bmp2 - modified mc ( mc - bmp2 ) that was capable of rapid hydrogel formation .
human teeth can be easily obtained during dental repair or surgery , and teeth provide human periodontal ligament stem cells ( hplscs ) in large quantities .
hplscs contain a stromal population of cells that are self - renewing and multipotent ; in addition , they have a high proliferation rate and can be cryopreserved for long periods , making them attractive for clinical studies .
more importantly , hplscs are capable of differentiation into an osteogenic lineage , as well as differentiation into other cells , such as those in odontoblastic , neurogenic , and adipocytic lineages42 .
we chose hplscs as a cell source in this work and examined an injectable hplsc - incorporated mc - bmp2 formulation in vivo .
this is the first report of the development of an injectable mc - bmp2 formulation that is suitable for osteogenic differentiation of hplscs ( fig. 1a ) .
therefore , the objectives of the current study were ( 1 ) to prepare bmp2 - opgy with an alkyne group and to examine the osteogenic differentiation of hplscs induced by bmp2 - opgy , ( 2 ) to evaluate whether covalently immobilized mc - bmp2 formulated by a quick click reaction can be injected to produce a hydrogel ( fig. 1b ) , and ( 3 ) to determine whether the injectable mc - bmp2 can induce synergistic osteogenic differentiation of hplscs that is greater than that of a physically bmp2 - loaded mc hydrogel ( mc - cl [+ bmp2 - opgy ]) .
results will indicate the potential for ( pre ) clinical orthopedic administration of bmp2 - modified mc. figure 1 ( a ) schematic of osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells in an in vivo - formed mc - bmp2 hydrogel , ( b ) synthesis of mc - cl , mc - n3 , and mc - bmp2 and ( c ) sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of bmp2 - opgy and mc - bmp2 .
sulfate - polyacrylamide gel was cropped and full - length gel included in supplementary fig. s6a .
results and discussion preparation of bmp2 - opgy to prepare bmp2 - opgy with an alkyne group ( fig. 2 ) , a tag stop codon for opgy incorporation was inserted at the fourth position of the recombinant bmp2 because a genetic modification at the c - terminus of bmp2 was reported to abolish its biological activities22 and the n - terminal region of bmp2 is not involved in interactions with its receptors .
using the engineered mjtyrrs - mjtrnacua described in the experimental section , opgy was incorporated into the tag position .
the recombinant bmp2 - opgy proteins expressed as inclusion bodies were refolded , and then their dimeric forms ( 29.4 kda ) were purified via a heparin column ( fig. 2d ) .

sulfate - polyacrylamide gel was cropped and full - length gel included in supplementary fig. s6b .
preparation and characterization of hplscs hplscs , isolated from a young woman , proliferated rapidly in culture medium and were expanded up to five passages .
the expression of surface antigens by hplscs was evaluated using flow cytometry .
passage five hplscs were positive for the mesenchymal stem cell markers cd90 (> 99.9 %) and cd166 (> 99.8 %) and negative for the hematopoietic stem cell marker cd34 (< 0.01 %) ( supplementary fig. 1 ) .
hplscs maintained stem cell characteristics throughout passages one to five .
these results indicated that hplscs could be used as a stem cell source for osteogenic differentiation in the subsequent experiment .
in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hplscs by bmp2 - opgy we examined osteogenic differentiation of hplscs by the naive bmp2 and engineered bmp2 - opgy .
the hplscs were cultured for 4 weeks in culture medium ( control ) , treated with osteogenic medium with bmp2 - opgy for 3 days and then cultured in culture medium ( single bmp2 - opgy treatment ) , or treated with osteogenic medium with naive bmp2 or bmp2 - opgy changed every 3 days ( repeated naive bmp2 or bmp2 - opgy treatment ) .
osteogenic characteristics induced by naive bmp2 or bmp2 - opgy were identified by alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) , alizarin red s ( ars ) and von kossa ( vk ) staining ( fig. 3 ) .
figure 3 staining with ( a ) alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) , ( b ) alizarin red ( ars ) , and ( c ) von kossa ( vk ) of human periodontal ligament stem cells grown in culture medium ( control ) , treated with a single exposure to bmp2 - opgy , and treated with repeated exposure to naive bmp2 or bmp2 - opgy ( magnification 50x , scale bars represent 500 mum ) .
hplscs in control and single bmp2 - opgy - treated hplscs revealed few or no osteogenic characteristics even after 4 week of culture .
this result indicates that hplscs could not differentiate without naive bmp2 or bmp2 - opgy and also did not differentiate with single bmp2 - opgy treatment .
in contrast , the hplscs treated with repeated exposure to naive bmp2 or bmp2 - opgy exhibited osteogenic characteristics by alp , ars and vk staining .
at week 1 , the hplscs with repeated naive bmp2 or bmp2 - opgy treatment exhibited few osteogenic characteristics , similar to the control and single bmp2 - opgy - treated hplscs .
the hplscs exhibited a faint pink color at 2 weeks that became deep pink at 3 and 4 weeks of culture with alp staining. with ars staining , the formation of mineralized nodules was observed as a brown color at 2 weeks that darkened and became more widely distributed at 3 and 4 weeks .
vk staining produced a light gray color at 2 weeks that became dark gray at 3 and 4 weeks , indicating the formation of calcium deposits .
quantitative analysis of ars and vk showed a similar osteogenic characteristic in the hplscs treated with repeated exposure to naive bmp2 or bmp2 - opgy ( supplementary fig. s2 ) .
these data confirm that the engineered bmp2 - opgy prepared in this study could induce osteogenic differentiation of hplscs , but that osteogenic differentiation of hplscs required treatment with engineered bmp2 - opgy for at least 3 weeks .
preparation of the injectable mpeg - b - ( pcl - ran - pfcl - n3 ) diblock copolymer ( mc - n3 ) hydrogel figure 1b shows the scheme for preparing mpeg - b - ( pcl - ran - pfcl - cl ) diblock copolymer ( mc - cl ) and mc - n3 .
mc - cl was prepared by ring - opening polymerization of the monomers cl and fcl using the terminal alcohol of mpeg as the initiator .
the colorless mc - cl diblock copolymers were obtained with a 90 % yield .
the carbons of carbonyl in pcl and pfcl - cl segments were observed at delta = 172.7 and 169.6 ppm at 13c - nmr peaks ( supplementary fig. s3 ) .
the ratios of pcl and pfcl - cl segments in copolymers were determined by the carbon integration ratios of carbonyl in pcl and pfcl - cl segments using 13c - nmr spectra , which agreed well with the expected 91:9 values .
mc - n3 was prepared by reaction of sodium azide with mc - cl , resulting in an 89 % yield .
mc - n3 diblock copolymers also exhibited characteristic peaks in 1h - and 13c - nmr .
the chloro - bonding carbon in mc - cl segments completely disappeared at delta = 169.6 in 13c - nmr peaks , and azide bonding in mc - n3 segments was observed at delta = 62.0 pm in 13c - nmr peaks ( supplementary fig. s3 ) .
the polydispersity indexes of mc - cl and mc - n3 after reaction were maintained at about 1.3 .
this result indicated that the pendant azide group was stoichiometrically introduced into the mc diblock copolymer , creating an active site for a click reaction of bmp2 - opgy with the alkyne group .
preparation and characterization of the injectable mpeg - b - ( pcl - ran - pfcl - bmp2 ) diblock copolymer ( mc - bmp2 ) hydrogel mc - n3 and bmp2 - opgy were individually prepared as described in the experimental section .
mc - bmp2 was prepared by a simple biorthogonal reaction between the alkyne group on bmp2 - opgy and the azide group on mc - n3 via a cu ( i ) - catalyzed click reaction .
in the sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) analysis of bmp2 - opgy and mc - bmp2 , the sizes of bmp2 - opgy in dimeric and monomeric form were 29.4 and 14.7 kda , respectively ; because the sample buffer for sds - page included a reducing reagent , the both forms were observed .
mc - bmp2 was large - sized ( fig. 1c ) , suggesting that the mc chain of bmp2 was modified .
furthermore , the engineered mc - bmp2 showed no unreacted bmp2 - opgy , indicating a quantitative biorthogonal reaction between the alkyne group on bmp2 - opgy and the azide group of mc - n3 .
characterization of mc - bmp2 solutions the mc - cl solution alone , bmp2 - opgy physically loaded onto mc - cl and mc - bmp2 chemically modified by bmp2 - opgy as injectable in vivo - forming hydrogels were prepared to examine the phase - transition .
an mc - cl solution was physically mixed with bmp2 - opgy [ mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy )] , because mc - cl cannot react with the alkyne of bmp2 - opgy .
the prepared mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 solutions exhibited a translucent emulsion - like solution and flowed through tilting at rt as shown in fig. 4. all solutions became a hydrogel at 37 degreesc .
the typical transition time in the tilting experiment with the mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 solutions was about 30 s at 37 degreesc .
figure 4 viscosity vs. temperature curves of mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 .
the viscosities of mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 were measured as a temperature function from 20 degreesc to 52 degreesc ( fig. 4 ) .
at ambient temperatures up to 28 degreesc , the viscosities of all hydrogel solutions were 1 cp , reflecting their emulsion - sol state .
the viscosities of mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 began to increase at 30 , 34 and 28 degreesc , respectively , indicating that the onset temperatures for gelation of the hydrogels were affected by bmp2 .
the viscosities at body temperature ( 37 degreesc ) were 3.31 x 105 cp for the mc - cl hydrogel , 3.00 x 105 cp for the mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) hydrogel , and 1.15 x 105 cp for the mc - bmp2 hydrogel .
there was little change in the viscosity of mc - cl because bmp2 - opgy as added to the mc - cl solution .
however , the viscosity of mc - bmp2 was slightly lower than those of mc - cl and mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) at 37 degreesc .
despite its slightly low viscosity , the mc - bmp2 solution became a hydrogel at body temperature .
meanwhile , the viscosity of the mc - bmp2 slightly decreased above 32 degreesc and then it increased again above 38 degreesc .
we conjectured that this phenomenon of mc - bmp2 was associated with the pre - aggregated gel formation at 28 - 36 degreesc and then more tightly aggregated gel formation above 38 degreesc .
this indicated that mc - bmp2 chemically modified with bmp2 - opgy may have affected the formation of a structured network and , therefore , the aggregation effect of pcl hydrophobic blocks in mc. collectively , the mc - bmp2 solution was used as an injectable hydrogel in the following experiment .
in vitro release the in vitro release of naive bmp2 or bmp2 - opgy from the mc - cl (+ naive bmp2 ) and mc - bmp2 hydrogels was examined at 37 degreesc for 21 days ( supplementary fig. s4 ) .
the cumulative release of naive bmp2 from the mc - cl (+ naive bmp2 ) hydrogel was 14 % at 1 day and approximately 45 % at 21 days .
this result indicated that naive bmp2 loaded via physical adsorption was consistently released from mc - cl (+ naive bmp2 ) .
meanwhile , as expected no bmp2 - opgy was observed mc - bmp2 hydrogel even at 21 days .
thus , we confirmed that bmp2 - opgy was completely covalently immobilized bmp2 - opgy on mc. in vitro proliferation of hplscs hplscs attachment and growth were examined to evaluate the biocompatibility of the mc - cl , mc - cl (+ naive bmp2 ) , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 hydrogels over a 7 - day incubation period ( fig. 5 ) .
hplscs as control were monitored in culture plates for comparison .
the hplscs gradually proliferated in all hydrogels as well as the culture plate .
the viability of hplscs in mc - cl , mc - cl ( naive bmp2 ) , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 hydrogels was about 70 % compare to that in the culture plate .
this indicates that all hydrogel exhibited suitable biocompatibility for hplscs .
thus the mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 formulations were used in the following in vivo experiment .
figure 5 viability of hplscs on culture plates or mc - cl , mc - cl (+ naive bmp2 ) , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) and mc - bmp2 hydrogels measured with the wst - 1 assay .
statistical analysis was per - formed using one - way anova with bonferroni 's multiple comparison correction (* p < 0.01 ) .
in vivo implantation to examine the osteogenic differentiation of hplscs in injectable hydrogels in vivo , mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 loaded with hplscs and in solution were subcutaneously injected into nude mice .
immediately after injection , the hplsc - loaded mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 solutions formed hydrogels .
the hplsc - loaded mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 hydrogels removed at 2 , 4 , or 8 weeks after injection maintained their shapes through the 8 - week implantation period ( supplementary fig. s5 ) .
the removed hydrogels exhibited thin fibrous capsules with fibroblasts , with blood vessels around the hydrogels after 2 - 8 weeks .
field - emission scanning electron microscopy ( fe - sem ) images of the removed hydrogels showed a porous inner structure with interconnected channels ( supplementary fig. s5 ) .
all hydrogel implants maintained their three - dimensional interconnected pore structures through the 8 - week implantation period .
the viability of hplscs on the mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 hydrogels was monitored by fluorescence microscopy of bromodeoxyuridine ( brdu ) - pre - labeled hplscs ( fig. 6 ) .
the brdu - stained sections of hydrogel implants showed that most hplscs ( pink ) were interspersed throughout the injected hydrogels .
these results indicated that brdu - pre - labeled hplscs survived in hydrogel implants through the 8 - week implantation period43 , 44 .
figure 6 images of bromodeoxyuridine ( brdu ; red ) and dapi ( blue ) immunofluorescence of mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , or mc - bmp2 hydrogels removed from mice after 2 , 4 , or 8 weeks ( magnification 200x , scale bars represent 100 mum ) .
to assess in vivo biocompatibility of the mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 hydrogels , the tissue sections obtained from the hydrogels were stained with ed1 ( a macrophage marker ) ( fig. 7a ) and dapi , then were counted to determine the extent of inflammation ( fig. 7b ) .
the hydrogel implants showed ed1 ( red ) and the host dapi ( blue ) staining .
the observed ed1 was most likely caused by specific rejection of the mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 hydrogels .
significantly , lower numbers of ed1 - positive cells were observed in all mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 hydrogels .
all hydrogel implants maintained similar numbers of ed1 - positive cells from 2 weeks to 8 weeks .
additionally , ed1 - positive cells on mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 hydrogels did not vary significantly .
these results indicated the biocompatibility of all mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 hydrogels .

tissue - engineered bone histology figure 8 shows h & e - stained histological sections of implants of hplsc - loaded mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , and mc - bmp2 hydrogels at 2 , 4 , or 8 weeks after injection .
h & e staining of hydrogel implants allowed them to be clearly distinguished from the underlying host tissue - hydrogel layer .
some host cells and a few new blood vessels were observed within the hydrogels .
figure 8 hematoxylin and eosin - stained histological sections of engineered bone from mice implanted with human periodontal ligament stem cells on mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , or mc - bmp2 hydrogels removed after 2 , 4 , or 8 weeks ( magnification 200x , scale bars represent 100 mum ) .
the hydrogel implants taken after 2 , 4 , or 8 weeks were stained with vk and ars to monitor the formation of mineralized bone associated with osteogenic differentiation of hplscs ( figs 9 and 10 ) .
the hplsc - loaded mc - cl hydrogel implants showed almost no evidence of mineral deposits within the 8 - week implantation period by vk and ars staining .
in the vk - and ars - stained images of hplsc - loaded mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , there was a small amount of mineralization only at 8 weeks , indicating that bmp2 slightly induced osteogenic differentiation of hplscs .
figure 9 von kossa - stained histological sections of engineered bone from mice implanted with human periodontal ligament stem cells on mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , or mc - bmp2 hydrogels removed after 2 , 4 , or 8 weeks ( magnification 200x , scale bars represent 100 mum ) .
figure 10 alizarin red s - stained histological sections of engineered bone from mice implanted with human periodontal ligament stem cells on mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , or mc - bmp2 hydrogels removed after 2 , 4 , or 8 weeks ( magnification 200x , scale bars represent 100 mum ). by contrast , imaged of the vk - and ars - stained hplscs loaded onto mc - bmp2 hydrogels showed some mineralized calcium deposits ( vk , black ; ars , red ) at 4 weeks post - implantation ; these mineral deposits became more evident at 8 weeks after implantation .
this result indicated that mc - bmp2 exclusively induced differentiation of hplscs toward an osteoblastic phenotype .
gene expression in tissue - engineered bone the larger proportion of vk - and ars - staining of mc - bmp2 compared to that of mc - cl and mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) indicated that osteogenic differentiation occurred in hplscs on mc - bmp2 .
to further characterize the osteogenic differentiation , we performed semi - quantitative real - time pcr to measure the expression of osteonectin ( on ) , osteocalcin ( oc ) , and collagen type 1alpha ( col1a ) mrnas ( fig. 11 ) .
alpha tubulin mrna expression was used as a reference .
figure 11 ( a ) osteonectin ( on ) , ( b ) osteocalcin ( oc ) , and ( c ) osteopontin ( op ) gene expression in human periodontal ligament stem cells on mc - cl , mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) and mc - bmp2 hydrogels after 2 , 4 , or 8 weeks .
results were statistically analyzed using a one - way analysis of variance with bonferroni 's multiple comparison correction (* p < 0.01 , ** p < 0.05 ) .
as expected , on served as an early marker of bone matrix synthesis .
expression of on at 2 weeks in mc - bmp2 hydrogels was about 1.9 - fold higher than that in mc - cl and mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) hydrogels .
however , on expression in mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) was only slightly higher than that in mc - bmp2 at 4 weeks .
oc and col1a mrna expression gradually increased in the mc - bmp2 hydrogels as the implantation time increased , whereas oc and col1a gene expression decreased in the mc - cl and mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) hydrogels .
oc and col1a mrna expression in the mc - bmp2 hydrogels was clearly higher than that in the mc - cl and mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) hydrogels even at week 8 .
at 8 weeks , oc and col1a mrna expression in the mc - bmp2 hydrogel was about 20 - fold and 9 - fold higher than that in mc - cl and mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) , respectively .
these patterns of expression were consistent with the histology results , which , together , indicate that osteogenic differentiation of hplscs was induced by the mc - bmp2 hydrogel .
these results support the hypothesis that mc - bmp2 hydrogels can enhance osteogenic differentiation of hplscs better than mc - cl (+ bmp2 - opgy ) .
the covalently immobilized mc - bmp2 employed in this study highly induced osteogenic differentiation of hplscs , relative to induction with traditionally loaded bmp2 .
in conclusion , we developed the first engineered bmp2 - opgy and an injectable mc - bmp2 formulation for osteogenic differentiation of hplscs .
specifically , covalently immobilized mc - bmp2 induced synergistic osteogenic differentiation on hplscs better than a physically bmp2 - loaded mc hydrogel .
we anticipate that the injectable in situ - forming mc - bmp2 hydrogel investigated here may be used for noninvasive administration of therapies for debilitating orthopedic conditions .

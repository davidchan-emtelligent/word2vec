the safety of milk and dairy products has always been one of the focuses of consumers , the food industry and regulatory agencies .
the purpose of this study was to gain insight into the food safety knowledge , attitudes and behavior of dairy plant workers .
a cross - sectional survey was performed between may and august 2015 in three dairy plants in beijing , northern china .
a total of 194 dairy plant workers were interviewed to collect information on food safety knowledge , attitudes and self - reported behavior .
the 194 dairy plant workers interviewed showed a sufficient level of knowledge ( mean score 34 on a scale from 0 - 58 ) , perfect attitudes ( mean score 17 on a scale from 0 - 18 ) , and perfect behavior ( mean score 38 on a scale from 8 - 40 ) .
only 39 % of workers correctly determined specific pathogens or diseases that could be conveyed through milk and dairy products .
24 % of workers knew the correct method of washing hands .
a significant positive association was observed between attitudes and knowledge ( p < 0.001 ) as well as behavior ( p < 0.01 ) .
education level was positively and significantly associated with food safety knowledge , attitudes , and behavior ( p < 0.05 ) .
workers in dairy enterprises in northern china have relatively low levels of knowledge , yet satisfactory attitudes and behavior .
the knowledge of microbial food hazards and hand hygiene remains an issue that needs to be emphasized in future training programs .
education level is a determinant of attitudes and behavior with regard to the proper handling of milk and dairy products .
attitudes dairy plant worker food safety knowledge behavior 1 .
introduction milk and dairy products have increasingly become a major food in chinese daily life ; the dietary guidelines for chinese recommend that most people include milk and dairy products in their daily diet [ 1 ] .
the safety of milk and dairy products has always been one of the focuses of consumers , the food industry and regulatory agencies after the melamine incident in 2008 .
although food adulteration is one of the concerns in china , the most important problem of food safety worldwide is foodborne diseases resulting from microorganisms [ 2 ] , such as campylobacteriosis , listeriosis and salmonellosis .
milk and dairy products are among the most important implicated food vehicles of foodborne diseases .
a lot of pathogens can contaminate milk and dairy products and cause disease and death , such as brucella , campylobacter , listeria monocytogenes , salmonella , shiga toxin - producing escherichia coli , and shigella [ 3 ]. between 2003 and 2008 , a total of 2795 foodborne disease outbreaks were reported to the china national foodborne diseases surveillance network , which resulted in 62,559 cases , 31,261 hospital admissions and 330 deaths in twelve provinces of china [ 4 ] .
it is estimated that approximately 200 million cases of foodborne disease occurred in china annually [ 5 ] .
china 's dairy industry chain , dominated by dairy processing enterprise , was divided into four modules , including feed , farm , dairy processing and consumer .
food production operators have the main responsibility to provide safe food to consumers and workers play a crucial role in the prevention of foodborne disease outbreaks .
therefore , knowledge and perception towards food safety among dairy plant workers are essential in ensuring the health of consumers .
in that case , training programs are of particular importance for improving knowledge of dairy plant workers .
in china food safety training among workers employed in the dairy industry in food safety is mandatory by food safety law : a training system should be established and the food safety knowledge training should be conducted to all employees of the enterprise .
in light of the different requirements of the positions , annual training plan should be developed and the corresponding training should be carried out .
for special types of positions , workers should be certificated [ 6 ] .
limited research on the food safety knowledge and behavior of dairy farm workers and plant workers has been published [ 7,8,9,10 ] .
however , no research on the knowledge , attitudes and behavior among workers employed by dairy plants has been documented in china .
therefore , the objectives of this study were as follows : ( 1 ) to assess the knowledge , attitudes and behavior towards food safety among workers employed in dairy plants in northern china ; and ( 2 ) to identify areas for improvements .
this study provides baseline information to improve training programs for chinese dairy plant workers .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
participants a cross - sectional questionnaire survey was performed between may and august 2015 in three dairy processing plants in beijing , northern china .
overall , about 2500 workers were employed in these plants .
beijing , as the capital city of china , most food is produced in and supplied from other provinces , and plants surveyed in this study representing major dairy processing plants in this area .
the production level of these plants is to process 300 to 1000 tons of raw milk daily .
on the front page of the questionnaire , a brief description of the purpose , the importance of the study , and the invitation for the worker to participate in the survey were included. with the help of the managers of the enterprises , a total of 194 workers directly involved in processing and packaging of milk and dairy products were conveniently sampled .
overall the response rate was 89 % .
2.2 .
data collection questionnaires were distributed to all workers in the rest zone of the plants in order to be completed at the end of the rest .
upon completion of the signing of the informed consent form , workers were requested to finish a self - administrated questionnaire .
the questionnaire was developed based on previous studies [ 10,11,12,13 ] .
the questionnaire was piloted among 21 dairy plant workers and modified as needed and took about 10 - 15 min to complete .
the questionnaire had four sections including sociodemographic demographic information , knowledge , attitudes , and behavior with regard to food safety .
in addition to sex , age , and education , the follow information was also collected : duration of employment in the food processing industry , enrollment in a food safety and foodborne disease training course , self - appraised food safety knowledge level and history of food poisoning .
knowledge of food safety was evaluated using 29 questions , and the first 25 questions have three options ( yes , no and unclear ) .
a correctly answered question was assigned a score of 2 points otherwise a score of 0 was assigned .
the scoring ranges from 0 to 58 .
knowledge scores for individuals were counted and added up to obtain the total knowledge score .
participants who responded correctly to < 50 % of knowledge evaluation items were regarded as having poor knowledge of food safety .
for nine questions on attitude , participants have three options ( agree , disagree and unsure ) .
a correctly answered question was assigned a score of 2 points otherwise a score of 0 was assigned .
the scoring ranges from 0 to 18 .
attitude scores for individuals were counted and added up to obtain the total attitude score .
participants who responded correctly to < 50 % of attitude evaluation items were regarded as having poor attitude of food safety .
for eight questions on behavior , participants have five options ( never , seldom , sometimes , usually and always ) .
a five - point rating scale ( 1 to 5 ) was used for behavior questions with 5 representing the best behavior .
the scoring ranges from 8 to 40 .
behavior scores for individuals were counted and added up to obtain the total behavior score .
participants who scored < 20 were regarded as having poor behavior of food safety .
2.3 .
statistical analysis data were entered using epidata , version 3.1 ( epidata association , odense , denmark ) and analyzed using spss , version 16.0 ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) .
descriptive analysis including mean , standard deviation ( sd ) and frequency (%) was performed for all variables .
non - parametric comparisons ( mann - whitney test , kruskal wallis test ) were used to compare the mean sum of correct responses of knowledge , attitudes and behavior between gender and age groups .
the associations between knowledge , attitudes and behavior scores and between the above - mentioned scores and demographic characteristics were tested using the spearman rank correlation .
findings with a p - value less than 0.05 were regarded as statistically different .
2.4 .
scientific ethics the study protocol was approved in 2015 by human ethics committee at china national center for food safety risk assessment ( no. 2015007 ) .
3. results 3.1 .
demographics demographic information of the respondents is shown in table 1 .
a total of 194 dairy plant workers participated in the survey .
the mean age of the respondents was 36 years of age ( range 19 - 52 years of age ; sd 8 years ) .
average duration of employment was seven years ( sd 6 years ) .
ninety - six percent had attended food safety and foodborne disease training courses .
nearly 76 % had received training for 3 times or more .
most of the respondents ( 87 %) had very good / good knowledge of food safety .
a history of food poisoning was reported by 13 % of the respondents .
3.2 .
knowledge the mean general knowledge score was 34 ( range 14 - 48 points ; sd 6.9 ) with 78 % above threshold level of 29 points ( table 2 ) .
there was no statistical difference in mean knowledge scores between age and gender groups ( p > 0.05 ) .
the mean specific pathogen / disease knowledge score was 11 ( range 0 - 20 points ; sd 4.8 ) with 39 % above threshold level of 12 points .
about 60 % of the respondents knew that foodborne diseases may lead to miscarriage in pregnant women .
most of the respondents ( 60 - 90 %) recognized that preschoolers , pregnant women and older people , and hiv - positive persons and cancer patients are at high risk of becoming ill due to the pathogenic microorganisms in food .
a low proportion of the respondents knew that people who frequently eat outside ( 7 %) and teenagers ( 28 %) are not the population at high risk .
in total , 52 % and 62 % of the respondents correctly answered that anthrax and brucellosis could be conveyed through milk and dairy products , respectively .
however , the corresponding figure was only 4 % for bovine viral diarrhea and 6 % for johne 's disease , both of these diseases could not be conveyed through milk and dairy products .
the percentages of correct responses of e. coli o157 : h7 , salmonella spp. , staphylococcus aureas , l. monocytogens , campylobacter spp. and noroviruses were 88 % , 74 % , 73 % , 56 % , 53 % and 48 % , respectively .
however , correct responses to clostridium botulinum ( 8 %) and toxoplasma gondii ( 7 %) were generally low .
nearly 80 % of respondents knew the optimal method to clean fresh vegetables and fruits ( with cool running water ) .
however , only 24 % knew the best way to wash hands , which includes wetting , applying soap , rubbing for 20 s , rinsing and drying hands .
approximately 60 % of the respondents could not specify the recommended freezer temperature ( - 18 degreesc ) .
however , 68 % of the respondents knew the maximum refrigeration temperature ( 4 degreesc ) to maintain the safety of foods .
3.3 .
attitudes the mean attitude score was 17 ( sd = 1.8 ) with 99 % above 9 ( table 3 ) .
there was no statistical difference in mean attitude scores between age and gender groups ( p > 0.05 ) .
more than 96 % of the respondents agreed that use of work uniform , masks and caps , raw foods stored separately from cooked food , food safety training for workers and monitoring of refrigerator temperatures have a great influence on decreasing risk of food contamination .
8 % of the respondents disagreed with the statement that workers with wounds on their hands should not handle food with their bare hands .
3.4 .
behavior all respondents had a total self - reported behavior score above 20 .
the mean behavior score was 38 ( sd = 3.2 ) , ranging from 24 to 40 points ( table 4 ) .
there was no statistical difference in mean behavior scores between age and gender groups ( p > 0.05 ) .
more than 85 % of the respondents always wore work uniform and cap , never wore watch and decoration , always washed hands after handling waste / garbage or after using the toilet , never smoke or ate / drank during their work except for breaks .
however , among the 193 dairy plant workers , only 64 % ( 123 / 193 ) of them always wore masks , whereas 7 % ( 14 / 193 ) seldom or never wore masks while working .
3.5 .
correlation results significant weak associations were observed between attitudes with knowledge ( rho = 0.261 , p < 0.001 ) and behavior ( rho = 0.200 , p < 0.01 ) .
there was no significant association between knowledge and behavior .
education level was significantly positively related with knowledge ( rho = 0.221 , p < 0.05 ) , attitudes ( rho = 0.159 , p < 0.05 ) , and behavior ( rho = 0.173 , p < 0.05 ) , though the associations were weak .
there was no significant association between duration of employment with knowledge , attitudes , and behavior .
4. discussion this is the first study to assess knowledge , attitudes and behavior toward food safety among dairy plant workers in china .
our findings demonstrated that workers employed in the three dairy enterprises in northern china have relatively lower - level of knowledge , yet satisfactory attitudes and behavior .
the majority ( 78 %) of the dairy plant workers answered correctly to more than 50 % of the questions in the knowledge section .
however , their knowledge of the specific diseases or pathogens that could be conveyed through milk and dairy products , was relatively low .
previous studies had showed that dairy farm workers did not have enough knowledge of foodborne diseases or pathogens [ 10 ] .
about 50 % of the respondents in this study were unaware that norovirus could spread from milk and dairy product to humans , while c. botulinum and t. gondii could not .
more than 40 % of workers were unsure whether anthrax , campylobacter or l. monocytogens could convey through milk and dairy products to humans .
this is surprising as the majority of dairy plant workers participated in food safety training courses .
there is a need to develop more tailored training programs for dairy plant workers .
future research should assess the effectiveness of mandatory continued education activities in food safety for dairy plant workers. e. coli o157 : h7 is one of the most virulent pathogens responsible for foodborne disease globally .
cattle are the main host for e. coli o157 : h7 and outbreaks are frequently attributed to the ingestion of contaminated milk and dairy products of cattle origin [ 14 ] .
in 1999 , a large - scale e. coli o157 : h7 outbreak in china had resulted in 195 hospital admissions due to hemolytic uremic syndrome and 177 deaths [ 15 ] .
in the present study , the proportion of respondents who identified e. coli o157 : h7 as a milk - borne pathogen was greater than those who identified other pathogens as milk - borne .
this difference could be due to the fact that the issue of e. coli o157 : h7 has been highly publicized through media in china .
about 40 % of the respondents in this study were unaware that foodborne diseases might cause miscarriage in pregnant women .
meanwhile , 44 % of the respondents were unaware that l. monocytogenes could spread from milk and dairy products to humans .
although affected pregnant women usually have mild symptoms , l. monocytogenes can lead to severe outcomes for fetus or newborn infant ; infection in utero can cause preterm labor or spontaneous miscarriage and stillbirth [ 16 ] .
southwestern ontario artisan cheese makers perceived l. monocytogenes to be the most harmful biological hazard to the health of consumers and to their businesses [ 8 ] .
the proportions of correct answers to optimal refrigeration temperature for food storage ( 68 %) and freezing of food ( 38 %) varied greatly in our study .
the figures were lower than found in other studies in lebanon ( 78 % and 55 %) [ 17 ] and in romania ( 76 % , respectively ) [ 18 ] .
it is worth noting that there may not be a single " maximum refrigeration temperature in order to maintain the safety of food " ( table 2 , question 28 ) .
as l. monocytogenes can grow in permissive foods even when these foods are stored at 4 degreesc .
correspondingly , the " monitoring of refrigeration temperatures " may have no effect on " decreasing the risk of food contamination " ( table 3 , question 7 ) .
in several studies on foodborne outbreaks , the hands of workers have been determined as the origin of pathogens in the involved food vehicles .
hand washing is the easiest and most efficient manner to remove pathogens on the hands [ 19 ] .
in line with findings from previous studies in lebanon and romania [ 17,18 ] , almost all respondents ( nearly 90 %) in our study always wash hands after handling waste / garbage , or after toilet visits .
however , only 24 % of respondents in the present study knew the most hygienic hand - washing steps , lower than previous studies [ 18,20 ] .
the study highlights the correlation between the level of education and the level of food safety knowledge , attitudes and behavior .
previous studies showed that workers with higher educational levels have a significantly higher food safety knowledge [ 13 ] .
compared with the perfect attitudes and behavior , the relatively lower - level knowledge presented in the study suggests the inefficiency of the food safety training programs , indicating the beijing dairy enterprises need to further improve training on employee food safety knowledge .
an efficient training program on food safety knowledge should at least include materials on major foodborne pathogens , high - risk population , safe storing temperature , and appropriate cleaning and hygiene procedures .
without well - trained workers who are aware of the importance of safety procedures in the food processing , it is difficult to implement and maintain a functional food safety system .
the limitations of this study are similar to other research on knowledge , attitudes and behaviors .
the inherent limitation of such research is that the response may be influenced by social expectations .
the sample size regarding the number of participants is sufficient , but they were recruited from only three plants .
as the study is not anonymous , there may be an influence between the involvements of company management upon the collection of the questionnaires .
another serious limitation is that the sampling of participants was " convenience sampling " .
while the survey may not be representative of all dairy plant workers , it does indicate problems of professional knowledge and behaviors in a high percentage of those surveyed and the work does suggest problems that need to be addressed .
the focus of this study is on dairy plant workers in beijing , china , so the findings should not be extended to all dairy plant workers in the country .
besides , dairy farming is also an important part of the dairy industry , therefore , similar assessment of food safety knowledge , attitudes and behavior is required for dairy farm workers in the future .
5. conclusions we conclude that workers employed in dairy enterprises in northern china have a relatively lower level of knowledge , yet satisfactory attitudes and behavior .
the knowledge of microbial food hazards and hand hygiene remains an issue that needs to be emphasized in food safety training programs in the chinese dairy enterprises .
education level is a determinant of attitudes and behavior with regard to the proper handling of milk and dairy products .

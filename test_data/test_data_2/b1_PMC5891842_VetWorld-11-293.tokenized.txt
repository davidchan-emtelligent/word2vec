aim : giardia is a serious zoonotic parasite , which causes diarrheal disease in humans and animals including rodents .
the purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of giardia spp. in brown rats ( rattus norvegicus ) in grenada .
materials and methods : intestinal contents from 99 and serum samples from 169 brown rats ( r. norvegicus ) from grenada were collected .
these samples were examined for the giardia coproantigens using cryptosporidium / giardia quik chek assay ( tech lab ( r ) inc. , usa ) , and the serum was screened through an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) test kit for giardia antibody ( anti - gd ) elisa kit ( mybiosource , san diego , ca , usa ) .
result : giardia coproantigens were positive in 17.17 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] ; 10.33 - 26.06 %) rats , whereas 55 % ( 95 % ci : 47.20 - 62.68 ) were positive with serum antibodies ( anti - gd ) to giardia .
conclusion : the prevalence of giardia spp. in brown rats in grenada was moderate based on the presence of coproantigens in the intestinal contents and antibody in serum .
the findings of giardia infections and prevalence in brown rats will help veterinarians and physicians to better plan diagnostic and preventative strategies .
this is the first report of prevalence of giardia in brown rats in grenada .
antibody brown rat coproantigens giardia grenada introduction giardia spp. is a flagellate unicellular protozoan causing disease in humans and animals .
the disease has a worldwide distribution , but in developing countries , there is a very high prevalence and incidence [ 1 ] .
based on the morphology of trophozoite , three species of giardia are recognized : giardia lamblia , synonymous of giardia duodenalis , and giardia intestinalis , is considered one of the major pathogens of humans and animals ; giardia muris of rodents , birds , and reptiles and giardia agilis of amphibians [ 2 ] .
a wide range of animals including rodents is believed to be a reservoir of g. lamblia [ 3,4 ] .
this flagellated protozoan parasite has a direct life cycle .
cysts of giardia spp. are voided in feces from infected host and contaminate food , water , and the environment .
transmission to a new host is through ingestion of food and water contaminated with giardia cysts or direct transmission through ingestion of cysts from person - to - person or animal - to - person contact [ 5 ] .
this direct transmission usually occurs in unhygienic conditions .
brown rats ( rattus norvegicus ) have been found infected with giardia spp. in many countries of the world including saudi arabia [ 6 ] , poland [ 7 ] , turkey [ 8 ] , and the usa [ 9 ] .
in grenada , there has been a report of recent increase in rats and human population , and the likelihood of transmission of zoonotic protozoan infections between these two species has increased as they share common living areas .
as far as we are aware , there is no report of giardia spp. infecting rats in grenada .
the objective of the study was to estimate the infection of giardia spp. in brown rats in grenada .
materials and methods ethical approval the project entitled " detection of zoonotic pathogens in brown rats ( r. norvegicus ) in grenada " was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee ( iacuc # 16009 - r ) of the st. george 's university , grenada .
study area grenada is the southernmost country in the caribbean sea with an area of 348.5 km2 .
the country with low hills , small trees , shrubs and tropical climate is most suitable for brown rats .
the country is separated in six parishes : st. patrick , st. mark , st andrew , st. john , st. george , and st. david .
since the trapping of rats was performed near the human dwellings , st. david and st. george parishes , which have more human population compared to other four parishes , were selected for the sample .
sample size determination the sample size was determined using the formula of glenn [ 10 ] .
the formula is n = t2 ( p )( 1 - p )/ d2 , where t = 1.96 , p = estimated prevalence , and d = desired level of precision .
since prevalence of giardia for grenada is not known , we took an average of prevalence from other countries , estimated 10 % , and took d = 5 % .
this gave the number of samples 138 .
thus , we decided to collect 170 rats , more than estimated number .
trapping and collection of rats one hundred sixty - nine ( n = 169 ) rats were collected live from may 1 to july 14 , 2017 , using traps ( 45 cm l x 15 cm w x 15 cm h ) made manually .
traps were used with cheese or various local fruits as bait .
attempts were made to trap the rats at 10 m radius near the residential buildings .
traps were placed in the evening and visited next day in the morning .
traps with rats were covered with a black cloth and transported to the necropsy laboratory of the school of veterinary medicine in grenada .
rats were anesthetized using isoflurane in oxygen through an anesthetic machine ( portable vet anesthesia machine isoflurane vaporizer vet ce ) , manufacturer dre ( avante health solution company , usa. ) .
collection of samples the anesthetized rats were weighed and examined physically for their health .
gender was also recorded .
rats below 100 g were grouped as young and over 100 g as an adult following the methodology used by previous researchers [ 11,12 ] .
blood was collected from the heart through the thoracic wall and rats were exsanguinated this way .
the abdominal cavity of rats was opened using a surgical blade and a pair of forceps .
the intestinal tract with contents was placed into containers with 10 % formalin until processing .
sera were separated from the blood by centrifugation at 1500 g for 15 min at room temperature and stored at - 80degreesc till tested .
quick check for cyst antigen and enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) for antibody in serum giardia / cryptosporidium quick chek assay ( tech lab inc. , usa ) was used to detect coproantigens in intestinal contents according to manufacturer 's directions .
serum samples were tested for antibodies against giardia spp. using commercial " qualitative rat giardia antibody ( anti - gd ) elisa kit " ( mybiosource , san diego , ca , usa ) following the manufacturer 's recommendations .
statistical analysis the prevalence of giardia spp. was compared by age and gender .
the data were analyzed by the statistical methods : fisher 's exact test , using a graphpad statistical software ( http :// www.graphpad.com / quickcalcs / contingency2 ) .
results from 169 tested samples , antibodies for giardia spp. were detected in 93 rats ( r. norvegicus ) , with an overall prevalence of 55 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] : 47.20 - 62.68 %) .
the result regarding the seroprevalence has been included in tables - 1 - 3 .
a significant higher prevalence was found in younger rats ( p < 0.05 ) .
the difference in positive cases between st. george and st. david was statistically not significant ( p > 0.05 ) .

p = 0.0290 detection of giardia spp. in intestinal contents was based on the use of antibodies against coproantigens of the organism .
the positivity of rats to giardia is presented in table - 4. of 99 rats tested , 17.17 % ( 95 % ci ; 10.33 - 26.06 %) were positive for coproantigens in the intestinal content ( considering the sensitivity of 98.9 % and specificity of 100 %) .

new techniques have been developed including elisa , indirect immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction to detect cysts and trophozoites in feces and antibodies in serum to identify past and present infection [ 5 ] .
in the present study , elisa was used for the detection of antibodies in serum .
antibody for giardia spp. was found in 55 % of the tested rats .
results of seroepidemiology at two sites ( st. george and st david ) were not significantly different ( p > 0.05 ) .
detection of giardia spp. in intestinal contents is based on the use of antibodies to coproantigens of the organism. of 99 rats tested , 17.17 % were positive for coproantigens in the intestinal content .
our result is consistent with previous researchers who also found the similar prevalence of giardia infection in brown rats .
al - bashan and sabra [ 6 ] reported 19 % brown rats infected with giardia in saudi arabia , by microscopic examination of feces .
recently , zeinab et al .
[ 13 ] , through microscopic examination , found 19.2 % positivity in feces of brown rats in iran .
a lower incidence ( 6.0 %) in feces was found in brown rats and house rats in china [ 14 ] .
the incidence of giardia in intestine represents current infection , whereas antibody in serum indicates past exposure .
in the same set of rats , we found 17.17 % rats positive for coproantigens in the intestinal contents compared to 55 % rats with antibodies in serum .
martin [ 9 ] reported quick clearance of giardia spp. from the intestine as a result of acquired immunity , t - cell playing a role in the process .
as a result , the young and immunocompromised animals and humans show delayed clearance of the parasite resulting in severity of the disease .
we found significantly higher prevalence in younger rats .
in studies made by previous researchers , prevalence was not affected by sex or age [ 15,16 ] .
in another study , relation of age with giardia infection was not found [ 17 ] .
further studies are suggested to elucidate the relation of age and gender with giardia spp. infection in rats .
conclusion for the first time , the prevalence of giardia spp. was reported in brown rats in grenada .
these rats were considered as reservoir of giardia spp. , a serious zoonotic parasite , poses a threat to human population in the country .
there is a need to educate the grenadian community regarding proper maintenance of hygienic conditions in and around their dwellings to prevent survival and proliferation of the rat population .
prevention and control program be implemented by the government and health workers to prevent the contamination of food and water from giardia spp. to combat the zoonosis .

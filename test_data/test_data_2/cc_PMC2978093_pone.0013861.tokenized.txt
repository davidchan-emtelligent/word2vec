background dyskinesias associated with involuntary movements and painful muscle contractions are a common and severe complication of standard levodopa ( l - dopa , l - 3,4 - dihydroxyphenylalanine ) therapy for parkinson 's disease .
pathologic neuroplasticity leading to hyper - responsive dopamine receptor signaling in the sensorimotor striatum is thought to underlie this currently untreatable condition .
methodology / principal findings quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) was employed to evaluate the molecular changes associated with l - dopa - induced dyskinesias in parkinson 's disease. with this technique , we determined that thyrotropin releasing hormone ( trh ) was greatly increased in the dopamine - depleted striatum of hemi - parkinsonian rats that developed abnormal movements in response to l - dopa therapy , relative to the levels measured in the contralateral non - dopamine - depleted striatum , and in the striatum of non - dyskinetic control rats .
protrh immunostaining suggested that trh peptide levels were almost absent in the dopamine - depleted striatum of control rats that did not develop dyskinesias , but in the dyskinetic rats , protrh immunostaining was dramatically up - regulated in the striatum , particularly in the sensorimotor striatum .
this up - regulation of trh peptide affected striatal medium spiny neurons of both the direct and indirect pathways , as well as neurons in striosomes .
conclusions / significance trh is not known to be a key striatal neuromodulator , but intrastriatal injection of trh in experimental animals can induce abnormal movements , apparently through increasing dopamine release .
our finding of a dramatic and selective up - regulation of trh expression in the sensorimotor striatum of dyskinetic rat models suggests a trh - mediated regulatory mechanism that may underlie the pathologic neuroplasticity driving dopamine hyper - responsivity in parkinson 's disease .
introduction the loss of striatal dopamine that results from degeneration of midbrain dopamine - containing neurons is responsible for much of the motor dysfunction characteristic of parkinson 's disease ( pd ) .
symptomatic treatment of pd patients with levodopa ( l - dopa ) alleviates many of these motor symptoms .
however , in conjunction with the progression of the disease , long - term l - dopa treatment leads to the development of adverse responses including debilitating l - dopa - induced dyskinesias ( lids ) that can include choreic , hyperkinetic movements or dystonic movements [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
the frequency and severity of lids increase with the duration of the l - dopa treatment and with the progression of the disease [ 4 ] , and there is strong evidence indicating that lids result from abnormal plasticity within the striatum [ 3 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ]. of the several animal models that reproduce the features of lid , among the most extensively studied is the classic hemi - parkinsonian rat model , in which one side of the striatum is depleted of dopamine by 6 - hydroxydopamine ( 6 - ohda ) before the dyskinesia - inducing treatment with l - dopa .
we used this model here to identify genes related to pathologic neuroplasticity associated with pd and lid .
we found that among the largest and most significant changes that were induced by l - dopa in the dopamine - depleted striatum of rats was an enhancement of the mrna for preprothyrotropin releasing hormone ( trh ) [ 9 ] .
this result was of particular interest , given that thyrotropin - releasing hormone ( trh ) , in addition to its well - known function in regulating thyroid - stimulating hormone ( tsh ) and thyroid function , is increasingly recognized as having neuromodulatory roles [ 10 ] .
clinically , hyperthyroidism has long been associated with hyperkinetic movement disorders , and correcting the hormonal imbalance can resolve the hyperkinesia [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
thyrotoxicosis has also been reported in pd patients with severe tremor [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , and anti - thyroid treatment has been effective in controlling ' on - off ' phenomenon and dyskinesia in thyrotoxic patients with pd [ 16 ] , [ 19 ] .
to determine the neural basis for these effects of trh and thyroid hormones , we examined the effects of dopamine depletion and subsequent l - dopa treatment on the striatal expression of preprotrh mrna by quantitative pcr ( qpcr ) and protrh peptide by immunohistochemistry and by radioimmunoassay ( ria ) [ 10 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
our findings demonstrate that l - dopa treatment leading to dyskinesia - like abnormal movements is associated with marked up - regulation of preprotrh mrna in the dopamine - depleted striatum and with striking up - regulation of protrh immunostaining in striatal efferent projections to the pallidum and the substantia nigra .
these findings point to dysregulation of striatal trh expression in these major output pathways of the basal ganglia as a potential central factor in the induction of lids .
results to induce behavioral changes similar to the dyskinesias observed in pd patients [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , we employed the well - established neurotoxic rat model of pd , in which unilateral infusion of 6 - ohda into the medial forebrain bundle , inducing loss of dopamine - containing neurons in the nigrostriatal system , was followed by chronic l - dopa treatment .
we administered l - dopa ( 25 mg / kg ) twice daily for 21 days and evaluated the motor behavior of rats every third day for 1 min , 20 min after the morning l - dopa treatment .
groups of control rats were given l - dopa treatment without prior dopamine depletion , or were given the 6 - ohda infusions to deplete dopamine levels but were then treated with saline instead of l - dopa .
because the 6 - ohda infusions ( and saline control infusions ) were made unilaterally , we were able also to examine the striatum contralateral to the side of dopamine - depletion as an intra - animal control. of the 10 rats with unilateral 6 - ohda lesions and chronic l - dopa treatment , 8 ( 80 %) developed dyskinetic behaviors during the 21 days of treatment ( friedman test s = 20.45 , p < 0.0001 ) , whereas none of the animals treated with saline , or given sham lesions with or without l - dopa treatment , developed motor complications ( figure 1a ) .
the 20 % of the rats with unilateral 6 - ohda infusions and chronic l - dopa treatment that did not develop dyskinetic behaviors did not exhibit evidence of a successful nigral lesion , based on tyrosine hydroxylase ( th ) immunostaining , and were excluded from further analysis .

black line : superimposed , identical values for 6 - ohda / saline ; no lesion / l - dopa ; no lesion / saline .
the animals in the three control groups never developed dyskinesias .
( 6 - ohda / l - dopa vs. all other groups p < 0.0001 ) .
( b ) preprotrh mrna levels measured by qpcr .
the mrna levels for preprotrh in the right striatum ( 6 - ohda lesion side ) of the animals chronically treated with l - dopa were significantly increased ( bonferroni t ** p < 0.001 ) with respect to the striatum contralateral to the lesion of 6 - ohda / l - dopa rats with lids and the non - dyskinetic control groups .
( c ) preprotrh mrna levels are associated with the presence of dyskinesias .
preprotrh mrna levels in the striatum ipsilateral to the 6 - ohda lesion showed a positive correlation with the behavioral scores ( pearson 's r = 0.725 , p = 0.0002 ) , but the relationship between the behavioral scores and the mrna levels did not follow a linear relationship .
no correlation was found between the mrna levels for preprotrh and the behavioral scores of the control animals ( pearson 's r = 0.313 , p = 0.17 ) .
shaded areas flanking the correlation curve represent the 95 % confidence intervals .
( d ) radioimmunoassay for trh , pye27 , and pye17 .
the trh tripeptide is derived from the processing of the larger precursor protrh , as are the peptides pye27 , and pye17 ( trh structure shown in panel to right ) .
results of the ria show that all three peptides derived from the larger preprotrh are greatly increased in the striatum ipsilateral to the lesion in the rats with lids , but not in the striatum contralateral to the lesion of the rats with lids , or in either striata of control treatment rats ( bonferroni t p < 0.001 ) .
striatal tissues were dissected 12 hours after the last l - dopa treatment and total rna was extracted [ 27 ] to measure the levels of preprotrh mrna with qpcr .
the levels of preprotrh mrna were significantly increased in the dopamine - depleted striatum of the rats that developed dyskinesia in response to the l - dopa treatment ( mixed design analysis of variance [ anova ] ; treatment x side interaction : f1,31 = 19.93 , p < 0.0005 ; figure 1b ) , relative to levels in the contralateral striatum and to striatal levels in control rats that were dopamine - depleted and treated with saline or given sham lesions and treated with l - dopa .
preprotrh mrna levels in the dopamine - depleted striatum of the l - dopa - treated animals were positively correlated with the behavioral scores ( pearson 's r = 0.725 , p = 0.0002 ) ( figure 1c ) .
the preprotrh mrna levels measured in the striatum contralateral to the lesion did not show a significant correlation with the behavioral scores ( pearson 's r = 0.313 , p = 0.17 ) ( figure 1c ) .
despite the highly significant correlation between the behavioral scores and the mrna levels in the dopamine - depleted striatum , however , the amount of preprotrh up - regulation and the severity of the behavioral abnormalities were not linearly related ( figure 1c ) .
thus , the up - regulation of preprotrh was a predictor of the presence of dyskinesia - like motor abnormalities , but not of the severity of these symptoms .
these findings suggest that preprotrh transcription is strongly and specifically up - regulated in the dopamine - depleted striatum by l - dopa treatment , and that this up - regulation is accompanied by the appearance of some level of abnormal movements in the animals .
the changes in preprotrh mrna are accompanied by changes in trh peptide to determine whether these changes in striatal preprotrh mrna in the l - dopa - treated animals were accompanied by changes in the levels of trh peptide , we performed rias and examined protrh - like immunostaining of striatal tissues from the dopamine - depleted and control sides of rats treated with l - dopa .
the biosynthesis of trh ( pyroglu - his - pronh2 ) begins with mrna - directed ribosomal translation of a larger inactive precursor called protrh ( figure 1d ) .
protrh then undergoes post - translational sequence - specific cleavages in tissue - and cellular compartment - specific steps by the processing enzymes prohormone convertase 1 ( pc1 ) and prohormone convertase 2 ( pc2 ) , leading to the generation of biologically active trh and other non - trh peptides with potential biologic activity [ 10 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 28 ] .
we therefore performed rias to measure both the amount of trh and the amount of two other peptides derived from the protrh precursor : pye27 from the n - terminus and the c - terminal fragment pye17 .
ria assays ( figure 1d ) demonstrated large increases in pye27 ( mixed design anova , treatment x side interaction : f3,15 = 487.8 , p < 0.0001 ) , pye17 ( f3,15 = 11205 , p < 0.0001 ) and trh ( f3,15 = 1385 , p < 0.0001 ) in the striatum ipsilateral to the 6 - ohda lesion in the animals treated with long - term l - dopa , but not on the contralateral side , and not in the dopamine - depleted striatum of control rats that were treated with saline , nor in sham animals treated with l - dopa .
these measurements suggested that the trh that we detected in the striatum of the l - dopa - treated animals in the dopamine - depleted hemisphere was the result of full processing of protrh hormone .
this finding , in combination with increased preprotrh mrna within the striatum , indicates that the up - regulated trh is encoded for and synthesized locally within the striatum of rats with dyskinesia - like motor abnormalities .
immunohistochemical localization of striatal protrh peptide to evaluate the regional distribution of the protrh and trh changes observed at the mrna level and peptide level with qpcr and ria , we used the rabbit antibody raised against the c - terminal peptide pye17 .
in control experiments shown in figure s1 , we demonstrated that pre - absorption of anti - pye17 antibody with the peptide pye17 ( amino acids 241 - 255 , qspqvepwdkeplee ) completely abolished immunostaining , whereas pre - absorption of anti - pye17 antibody with the n - terminal peptide pye27 ( amino acids 25 - 50 , lpeaaqeegavtpdlpglenvqvrpe ) did not affect immunostaining .
these findings , indicating the specificity of the anti - pye17 antibody , confirm the results of nillni and colleagues [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] and others [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] , [ 38 ]. with this antibody , we found a striking up - regulation of immunolabeling for protrh in the dopamine - depleted striatum of the l - dopa - treated animals , relative to that in control rats treated with saline after the lesion ( figures 2 and 3 ) .

in the rats treated with saline ( figure 2a ) , there was almost no protrh immunostaining visible in the dopamine - depleted striatum , and protrh immunostaining was also almost absent in the striatum contralateral to the dopamine - depletion in l - dopa - treated animals .
exceptions were scattered protrh - positive pseudounipolar neurons in the most dorsal and medial parts of the caudoputamen , near the lateral ventricles ( figure 4 ) , present in all animals regardless of their treatment schedule .
they resemble neurons of the rostral migratory stream [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .

figure 2a illustrates this gradient of immunostaining at six anteroposterior levels in three of the cases , relative to the immunostaining at similar levels through the brain of a saline - treated control .
the l - dopa - treated cases shown from left to right in figure 2a received , respectively , average dyskinesia scores of 7 , 8 and 8 for the last three behavioral assessments .
on the dopamine - depleted side , the protrh immmunostaining was intense laterally and ventrolaterally , but there was relatively little immunostaining medially or at far - anterior levels .
caudally , small focal zones of intense stain appeared , with very little immunostaining around them ( figure 2b , top ) .
the l - dopa treatment also induced intense immunostaining of neuropil in the globus pallidus ( the rodent equivalent of the external pallidum ) , the entopenduncular nucleus ( the rodent equivalent of the internal pallidum ) , and the pars reticularis of the substantia nigra ( figure 2b , middle and bottom panels ) .
this protrh immunostaining of the output nuclei of the striatum was strong in all l - dopa - treated rats on the side of dopamine depletion ( figure 2a , 3 right columns ) , and was absent in all controls ( figure 2a , left column ) .
the protrh labeling in the intensely immunostained regions of the caudoputamen was in both cell bodies and neuropil and appeared to be associated with neurons of medium size , likely corresponding to medium spiny neurons ( figure 2c ) .
the staining observed in globus pallidus , entopenduncular nucleus and the substantia nigra pars reticularis appeared to be concentrated in neuropil , a pattern consistent with labeling of the axons of striatal medium spiny neurons ( figure 2b ) .
the protrh immunostaining was not equivalently intense in the dopamine - depleted striatum of all of the animals treated with l - dopa , but elements of the patterns shown in figures 2 and 3 appeared in all of them .
to test whether this uneven striatal immunostaining was the result of variations in the locations of the 6 - ohda injections or unintended damage during the 6 - ohda injections or fixation process , we stained nearby striatal sections for th , caldag - gefii and micro opioid receptor 1 ( mor1 ) .
th was chosen as a marker of the extent of the dopamine depletion , whereas caldag - gefii and mor1 are two immunomarkers that have been previously shown to be dysregulated by combined 6 - ohda lesion and l - dopa therapy [ 9 ] , [ 41 ] .
th immunostaining of the substantia nigra ( figure 2a second to last row ) was , as expected , strong on the control side but was scarcely detectable on the side of the 6 - ohda lesion .
similarly , th immunostaining of the striatum was strong contralateral to the lesion but was almost nil on the dopamine - depleted side .
caldag - gefii and mor1 immunostains also were dysregulated across the full extent of the striatum on the side of the lesion in the l - dopa - treated animals : caldag - gefii was strongly up - regulated , and mor1 immunostaining was strongly down - regulated ( figure 3a ) .
thus , the spatial extent of the protrh up - regulation , favoring the lateral striatum , did not appear to be the result of a partial lesion effect as judged by three other immunomarkers .
this observation favors the view that trh may be up - regulated in only a subset of medium spiny striatal neurons .
it is possible that variation in the degree of protrh immunostaining from case to case reflects temporal variation in the trh response to l - dopa .
there was clearly strong up - regulation of protrh immunostaining in both striosomes and matrix in the most intensely stained zones of the caudoputamen , but as the protrh immunostaining diminished medially , the staining was uneven , and at posterior levels , the small zones of intense immunostaining had the appearance of striosomes. with adjoining sections immunostained for a striosomal marker [ 42 ] , these focal zones were identified as striosomes ( figure 3b ) .
thus the pattern of trh regulation in the striatum was one in which protrh was up - regulated in a large part of the lateral striatum in both striosomes and matrix , but in which there was up - regulation in striosomes of the more weakly affected zones , especially at caudal levels .
discussion our findings demonstrate that in the classic 6 - ohda model of pd , there is a strong up - regulation of expression of trh in the dopamine - depleted striatum and its efferent projections to the pallidum and substantia nigra .
further , we show that the enhanced expression of striatal protrh was associated with the behavioral expression of motor complications in response to long - term l - dopa therapy .
both preprotrh mrna and trh peptide levels were increased , and these increases were selective for the combination of 6 - ohda - induced dopamine depletion and l - dopa treatment .
as our ria findings suggested that the trh peptide produced was fully processed , the trh detected was likely biologically active .
remarkably , in the striatum of control animals , whether sham - depleted or dopamine - depleted and treated with saline , immunostaining for protrh was almost absent .
these findings suggest that the up - regulation of trh was induced by combined dopamine depletion and l - dopa treatment , not by dopamine depletion alone or by l - dopa treatment alone .
activation of signaling cascades related to trh could thus be critically important for understanding the mechanisms giving rise to the occurrence of dyskinesias in parkinsonian conditions .
the model that we employed induced an almost complete lesion of the dopamine - containing neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra , and we administered high doses of l - dopa .
this model thus parallels a relatively advanced stage of pd in which dyskinesias are prevalent , presumably because patients have more pronounced nigral cell loss and are taking increasingly high doses of anti - parkinsonian medication .
but the 6 - ohda model does not incorporate a prolonged decline of the population of dopamine - containing neurons in the substantia nigra. whether trh up - regulation is specific to severe , late - stage models of the disease process or might be observed with lesser degrees of dopamine depletion is still unknown .
we found a marked increase in the mrna for preprotrh , which gives rise to trh and several other fragments. by immunohistochemistry , we observed a pronounced and patterned increase in protrh immunostaining in the striatum , with the strongest protrh expression concentrated in the lateral and ventrolateral striatum including the sensorimotor striatum .
this protrh immunostaining was apparent in the cell bodies of putative striatal medium spiny neurons , and in striatal efferent axons terminating in the external and internal pallidal segments and the pars reticularis of the substantia nigra .
our findings thus suggest that the striatal up - regulation of trh affects both the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia and parts of the striosomal pathway as well .
we could identify several features of this pronounced increase in striatal trh .
first , the protrh up - regulation within the striatum mainly occurred in lateral and ventrolateral regions , despite the fact that the dopamine - depletion was relatively uniform .
this selectivity suggests that the trh dysregulation strongly affected the sensorimotor striatum and nearby regions .
in addition , there appeared to be differential up - regulation of trh expression in caudal parts of the striosomal system , judging from the immunohistochemistry .
this anatomical distribution accords with the induction of the motor problems in the animals , and is consonant with reports that up - regulation of prodynorphin and fosb is non - uniform and particularly concentrated in parts of the striosomal system and the ventrolateral aspect of the striatum in other rat models of lids [ 8 ] , [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] .
the particular emphasis on the lateral and caudal striatum is interesting , given the posteriolateral to anterior gradient of dopamine loss in the human striatum in pd [ 46 ] .
second , although we could not conclusively identify the subtype of the medium - sized neurons expressing increased protrh immunoreactivity , the increased protrh immunostaining in both pallidal segments and the substantia nigra suggests that both direct and indirect pathway neurons of the striatum were affected by the l - dopa treatment in such a way that protrh - immunostained material reached the terminals of these pathways .
this finding is interesting in light of findings that l - dopa - induced hyper - activation of the extracellular signal - regulated kinases , erk1 / 2 , which are required for the development of lids in mouse models , is restricted to medium spiny neurons of the direct pathway [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] .
immunohistochemical stains identified striosomal protrh up - regulation in striosomes of the caudal striatum .
this result is particularly striking , as it suggests that the trh up - regulation induced by l - dopa in the dopamine - depleted striatum differentially affects subcircuits within the direct , indirect and striosomal pathways .
these subcircuits could be particularly relevant to the genesis of dyskinesias [ 3 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] as well as dysfunction in a range of other movement disorders [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] , [ 53 ] .
notably , the increased striatal trh immunostaining that we observed was combined with increased immunostaining for caldag - gefii but with decreased immunostaining for mor1 , both reliable markers of striosomes .
interactions between the trh changes we observed and other known regulatory changes in striatal neurotransmission are likely to be important [ 5 ] , [ 54 ] , [ 55 ] , [ 56 ] .
our findings add to a body of evidence that trh , although best known for its hypophysiotropic function in regulating tsh release and thyroid function , also directly affects non - hypothalamic neural circuits .
hyperthyroidism has long been associated with hyperkinetic movement disorders , and treating this hormonal abnormality can resolve the hyperkinesia [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
thyrotoxicosis has been reported in some pd patients with severe tremor [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , and anti - thyroid treatment has been effective in controlling ' on - off ' phenomenon and dyskinesia in thyrotoxic patients with pd [ 16 ] , [ 19 ] .
our findings raise the possibility that the dyskinesias suffered by patients with pd following prolonged l - dopa therapy are also correlated with spatially selective dysregulation of trh within the striatum .
striatal changes in trh peptide content are associated with changes in mrna for preprotrh , and we found full processing of the prepro - peptide within this same structure .
thus , as the encoding and synthesis of the peptide happens fully within the striatum , it seems likely that the effects of trh in response to lids did not rely on the regulation of peripheral thyroid hormones , which would require release of trh into the portal system .
particularly relevant to the findings we report here are experiments suggesting that the behavioral patterns stimulated by increased intrastriatal trh in intact non - primate mammals are akin to human dyskinesia [ 57 ] , [ 58 ] , [ 59 ] , [ 60 ] , [ 61 ] , [ 62 ] , [ 63 ] .
studies have suggested that the behavioral effects of trh are exerted via the stimulation of striatal dopamine release [ 64 ] , and that they can be antagonized by both d1 - class and d2 - class dopamine receptor antagonists [ 57 ] , [ 58 ] , [ 59 ] .
in turn , striatal dopamine levels have also been shown to modulate the release of trh within the rat striatum [ 61 ] , [ 62 ] , with higher levels of dopamine correlating with higher levels of intrastriatal trh .
our findings suggest that up - regulation of striatal expression of trh in the striatum and its output pathways is strongly correlated with the expression of l - dopa induced dyskinesia and that this up - regulation could be an essential feature of the dyskinetic state in parkinsonism .
these observations raise the possibility that treatments targeting trh expression , the receptor for this biologically active peptide , or related signaling molecules , could be useful in treating or preventing l - dopa - induced dyskinesias in human pd. materials and methods subjects and surgery male sprague - dawley rats ( 250 - 350 g ) were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine hydrochloride ( 75 mg / kg ) and xylazine ( 10 mg / kg ) .
under stereotaxic guidance , 6 microl of 6 - ohda hydrobromide ( 10 mm 6 - ohda in 0.01 % ascorbic acid , 1 microl / min ) or saline ( for control , sham - lesion animals ) was injected into the right medial forebrain bundle ( ap = - 4.0 mm , ml = - 1.3 mm , dv = 8.4 mm ) .
three weeks after the surgery , an observer blind to the treatment condition counted the number of turns made to the side contralateral to the side of the 6 - ohda lesion over a 1 min sampling period , 10 min after injection of apomorphine subcutaneously ( 0.5 mg / k ) .
this procedure was followed to estimate the extent of dopamine depletion .
rats with 6 or more contralateral turns / min were classified as having a successful lesion .
drug treatments and behavioral observation the rats were treated intraperitoneally ( i.p. ) with either l - dopa ( 25 mg / kg )/ benserazide hydrochloride ( 6.25 mg / kg ) in 1 ml / kg saline solution , or with saline ( 1 ml / kg ) , for a period of 21 days twice daily ( 10 am and 5 pm ) .

abbreviations : ihc , immunohistochemistry .
the rats were observed for 1 min , 20 min after the administration of l - dopa on every third day during the entire treatment period .
turning behavior contralateral to the lesion side was recorded as a measure of the severity of the lesions .
dyskinetic behaviors were recorded and subsequently coded on the basis of the type and severity of the behaviors exhibited ( table 2 ) by two observers blind to the treatment .
the animals were euthanized 12 hrs after the last injection ( see table 1 ) .
all of the animal treatments were approved by the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) committee on animal care .

total rna was isolated from the dissected striatal samples and cdna was synthesized as previously described [ 27 ] .
short synthetic pcr primers were designed to amplify a small 225 bp amplicon for preprotrh ( forward primer : tgt cac caa gag gca aca tc ; reverse primer : ctt tgc ttc acc agg gtc tc ; annealing temperature 60degreesc ) using primer3 software ( http :// frodo.wi.mit.edu / primer3 /) .
qpcr was carried out using an icycler ( r ) ( biorad , hercules , ca ) , and sybr ( r ) green pcr master mix ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) .
curves with known concentrations of cdna were generated to calculate the efficiency of each of the primers , and to quantitate products with the deltadeltact method [ 65 ] , [ 66 ] .
data were normalized to gapdh mrna levels .
peptide radioimmunoassay ( ria ) all rias were performed as previously described [ 20 ] .
the ria incubation contained 100 pl of antiserum , 100 pl of sample , and 200 pl of ria buffer ( 10.1 m phosphate buffer with 0.5 % bovine serum albumin ; ph 7.2 ) .
one hundred microl of 125i - peptide ( 10,000 cpm ) was added following a 24 hr pre - incubation at 4degreesc .
after an additional 48 hr incubation at 4degreesc , 1.0 ml of 0.1 % activated charcoal was added to each reaction to separate bound and free 125i - peptide .
the supernatants were counted for radioactivity , following centrifugation at 2,000x g for 30 min .
immunohistochemistry rabbit anti - caldag - gefii ( 1:1,500 , santa cruz biotechnology ) ; mouse anti - tyrosine hydroxylase ( 1:4,000 , immunostar ) ; rabbit anti - pye17 ( 1:4000 ; precursor of trh was generated in the laboratory of eduardo nillni [ 20 ]) , and rabbit anti - micro opioid receptor 1 ( 1:20,000 , immunostar ) were used for immunohistochemistry for light microscopy as described in [ 67 ] .
statistical methods behavioral testing the dyskinesia scores were analyzed with friedman 's two - way anova by ranks for correlated samples , followed by dunn 's test for multiple comparisons .
to estimate the degree of correlation between mrna levels and behavioral measures , we calculated spearman 's correlation coefficients for ranked data .
qpcr and ria measurements a mixed design anova with a between subjects variable ( treatment : saline , l - dopa ) , and a within subject variable ( side : lesion , no lesion ) was used to evaluate statistical differences between left and right striatal mrna levels and ria peptide levels for samples from animals with 6 - ohda lesions treated with chronic l - dopa or saline , followed by a bonferroni t test for multiple comparisons .
supporting information figure s1 pre - absorption of anti pye17 antibody demonstrates the specificity of protrh immunostaining .
for this experiment we used a rat with a 6 - ohda lesion and long - term levodopa treatment .
this animal developed lids and upregulation of trh .
we immunostained striatal sections from this rat with anti - pye17 alone , anti - pye17 pre - absorbed with either pye17 or pye27 peptide or with the primary antibody omitted .
( a ) anti - pye17 alone shows strong immunostaining for protrh .
( b ) immunostaining was completely blocked by preabsorbtion of anti - pye17 with pye17 peptide .
( c ) immunostaining for protrh was not disrupted by preabsorbtion of anti - pye17 with pye27 peptide .
( d ) omission of the primary antibody anti - pye17 abolished immunostaining .

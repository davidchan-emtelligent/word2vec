since the first procedure performed in 2000 , robotic - assisted radical prostatectomy ( rarp ) has been rapidly gaining increasing acceptance from both urologists and patients .
today , rarp is the dominant treatment option for localised prostate cancer ( pca ) in the united states , despite the absence of any prospective randomised trial comparing rarp with other procedures .
robotic systems have been introduced in an attempt to reduce the difficulty involved in performing complex laparoscopic procedures and the related steep learning curve .
the recognised advantages of this kind of minimally invasive surgery are three - dimensional ( 3d ) vision , ten - fold magnification , endowrist technology with seven degrees of freedom , and tremor filtration .
in this article , we examine this technique and report its functional ( in terms of urinary continence and potency ) and oncologic results .
we also evaluate the potential advantages of rarp in comparison with open and laparoscopic procedures .
robotic surgery prostate cancer prostatectomy incontinence impotence introduction since the initial description of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( lrp ) by schuessler et al in 1992 [ 1 ] , the laparoscopic procedure has been standardised by guillonneau and vallancien [ 2 ] and others [ 3 ] ; even if lrp replaced open retropubic prostatectomy ( orp ) in some centres , it is universally considered a challenging procedure .
in fact , besides perfect knowledge of the local anatomy , lrp requires complex laparoscopic skills , such as endoscopic suturing and intracorporeal knotting , which make the learning curve particularly steep .
in 1999 , the da vinci surgical system ( r ) was developed by intuitive surgical inc .
( mountain view , california , united states ) , while , in 2000 , binder et al described the first ten robotic - assisted radical prostatectomy ( rarp ) procedures [ 4 ] .
many features of this robotic surgical system were very useful in performing this kind of surgery : ( i ) the improvement in visualisation by the insite vision system , through three - dimensional ( 3d ) vision , ten - fold magnification , and infinitely variable positioning of the 30degrees endoscope by the surgeon ; ( ii ) the facilitation of handling of laparoscopic tools by the 3d vision , which allows to dissect , suture , and tie knots endoscopically much as would be possible in open surgery ; and ( iii ) the better control of surgical instruments and camera positioning at the console .
the main disadvantages observed at that time were the limited choice of laparoscopic tools and the considerable cost .
the adoption of rarp at present , radical prostatectomy ( rp ) represents the standard for long - term cure of localised prostate cancer ( pca ) , with cancer - specific survival approaching 95 % at 15 years after rp [ 5 ] .
since the first procedure performed by binder in may 2000 [ 4 ] , rarp , performed using the da vinci surgical system , has been rapidly accepted as a safe and efficacious treatment option for localised pca [ 6 ] .
rarp is currently the leading urologic use of the da vinci system , and more than 80 % of the rps performed in the united states in 2011 were done by robotic - assisted surgery [ 7 ] .
rarp can be performed either through a transperitoneal or through a subperitoneal approach , with more precision and choices for dissection , thanks to the 3d vision of the system [ 7 ] .
indications for rarp indications for rarp are the same as those for orp and lrp .
according to the american urological association ( aua ) guidelines 2007 ( reviewed and validity confirmed 2011 ) , low - , intermediate - , and high - risk patients with localised pca could undergo rarp [ 8 ] .
the european association of urology ( eau ) guidelines 2011 identify four categories of patients who should undergo ralp : patients with low - and intermediate - risk localised pca and a life expectancy > 10 years ; patients with stage t1a disease and a life expectancy of > 15 years or gleason score ( gs ) 7 ; selected patients with low - volume high - risk localised pca ; highly selected patients with very high - risk localised pca ( ct3b - t4 n0 or any t n1 ) in the context of multimodal treatment [ 9 ] .
further , the pasadena consensus panel ( pcp ) identified some patient subgroups who should be treated by an ' experienced ' surgeon , such as obese patients [ body mass index ( bmi ) > 30 ] , patients with prostate volume > 70 cm3 , patients with previous transurethral resection of prostate ( turp ) or other surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia ( bph ) , patients with large median lobe , high - risk patients requiring extended pelvic lymph node dissection , and patients with previous pelvic surgery [ 10 ] .
only very experienced surgeons should perform salvage rarp after radiation therapy , cryotherapy , or high - intensity focused ultrasound ( hifu ) [ 11 ] .
recent studies showed that rarp can be performed safely without discontinuing low - dose aspirin , without significant increases in blood loss , transfusion rates , and postoperative haemorrhagic complications [ 12 ] .
robotic - assisted lymph node dissection the lymph node drainage of the prostate appears to be in the following order : external and obturator ( 38 %) , internal iliac ( 25 %) , common iliac ( 16 %) , para - aortic / caval ( 12 %) , presacral ( 8 %) , and inguinal ( 1 %) [ 13 ] .
as before , indications for lymph dissection during rarp are the same as those for orp : patients with intermediate - risk pca ( ct2a and / or psa 10 - 20 ng / ml and / or biopsy gs of 7 ) , high - risk pca (> ct2b and / or psa > 20 ng / ml and / or gs >= 8 ) , or patients with >= 7 % likelihood of having node metastases according to the available nomograms [ 10 ] .
freicke et al [ 14 ] , ham et al [ 15 ] , and menon et al [ 16 ] reported the feasibility of an extended lymph node dissection in course of rarp , including external iliac , internal iliac , and obturator lymph nodes .
they obtained mean numbers of nodes ranging from 12 to 19 and positive node rates ranging from 11 % to 24 % , according to the different patient characteristics [ 17 ] .
chung et al [ 18 ] compared transperitoneal and extraperitoneal limited dissection , showing a similar lymph node yield with a slightly higher risk of postoperative lymphocoeles for the extraperitoneal approach .
oncologic results after rarp although 13 years have passed since the first procedure , only a few centres have been performing rarp for more than 5 years .
thus , long - term data regarding biochemical recurrence ( bcr ) of pca after rarp are still sparse .
data from the most detailed available rarp series show bcr - free survival estimates of 95.1 % , 90.6 % , 86.6 % , and 81.0 % at 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 years after rarp , respectively ( median follow - up : 5 years ) [ 10 ] .
a surrogate oncologic outcome can be identified in the positive surgical margin ( psm ) rates .
psms are defined as presence of tumour at the inked margin of the prostatectomy specimen , and they are considered a risk factor for disease progression [ 10 ] .
a large population - based study showed that patients with psms had a 1.7 - fold higher risk of death compared with those without [ 19 ] .
a recent systematic review of oncologic outcomes after rarp showed that the average rate of psms in pt2 disease is 8 % - 10 % , while in pt3 disease is about 37 % [ 17 ] .
psms in pt2 disease can be considered for the most part iatrogenic and hence potentially avoidable [ 20 ] .
in 2013 , silberstein et al published a study comparing early oncologic outcomes of 961 orp and 493 rarp performed by experienced surgeons in a high volume centre .
despite a short follow - up ( 1 year ) , they found that rarp was not associated with lower rates of bcr - free survival or higher rates of psms .
the same findings were confirmed for higher - risk patients receiving rarp when emphasis is placed on strict adherence to oncological surgical principles [ 21 ] .
continence outcomes after rarp while incontinence and impotence are the two chief drawbacks of rp [ 22 ] , incontinence seems to be the problem that troubles patients most , even if its incidence is inferior to that of impotence .
according to the eau guidelines 2011 , incontinence persists 1 year after rp in 7.7 % of cases [ 9 ] , while the aua guidelines 2007 ( reviewed and validity confirmed 2011 ) report post - rp incontinence rates ranging from 3 % to 74 % [ 8 ] .
the international continence society defined incontinence as ' the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine ' [ 23 , 24 ] .
stress incontinence is the most frequently observed type of incontinence after rp , even if a considerable number of patients present a mixed urge and stress syndrome .
sphincter dysfunction is mainly a result of injury to the sphincter mechanism during prostatic surgery ; considering this mechanism , incontinence is usually associated with abdominal pressure increase .
in the most severe cases , it can be gravitational [ 25 ] .
the pcp identified some risk factors for urinary incontinence following rarp , such as increased age , obesity , short membranous urethral length on both preoperative and postoperative endorectal magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , post - rarp anastomotic strictures , low institutional and / or surgeon caseload , resection of the neurovascular bundles ( nvbs ) and / or of the bladder neck , large prostate volume [ 10 ] .
the prevalence of urinary incontinence after rarp ranges from 4 % to 31 % .
these outcomes can be influenced by preoperative patient characteristics , surgeon experience , surgical technique , and methods used to collect and report data [ 26 ] .
data from a recent meta - analysis showed a statistically significant advantage in favour of rarp in comparison with both rrp and lrp in terms of 12 - month urinary continence recovery [ 26 ] .
many surgical techniques have been proposed in order to reduce the occurrence of incontinence and to shorten the time to continence. between them , in 2001 , rocco et al described a surgical technique whose aim was the reconstruction of the posterior musculofascial plate after rp in order to improve early return to urinary continence [ 27 ] .
in 2007 , the application of this technique to transperitoneal lrp was described [ 28 ] .
in 2012 , rocco et al conducted a systematic review of comparative studies analysing the influence of reconstruction of the posterior aspect of the rhabdosphincter during orp , lrp , and rarp .
the cumulative analysis of comparative studies showed that reconstruction of the posterior musculofascial plate improves early return of continence within the first 30 days after rp , while continence rates 90 days after surgery are not affected by the use of the reconstruction technique [ 29 ] .
potency after rarp the nvbs were first described in 1982 by walsh and donker [ 30 ] .
these authors demonstrated that erectile dysfunction following rp occurred secondary to injury to the cavernosal nerves ( cns ) , a group of parasympathetic nerves originating from the pelvic plexus and running together with arteries and veins ( capsular vessels of the prostate ) on a prominent nvb on the posterolateral aspect of the prostate and eventually ending in the corpus cavernosum of the penis .
further studies about the distribution of nerves within the nvb demonstrated that these nerves are organised into three functional compartments , in which the cns are located on the anteromedial aspect of the nvb closest to the prostate .
other nerves within the nvb located laterally and inferiorly to the cn innervate the levator ani muscle and rectum , respectively [ 31 , 32 ] .
according to the pcp , a maximum preservation of cns ( full nerve sparing ) can be obtained by following the plane between the prostatic capsule and the multilayer tissue of the prostatic fascia .
this kind of nerve sparing is recommended for sexually active and functional men without comorbidities and limited - risk disease .
partial nerve sparing , obtained following the planes within the multilayer tissue of the prostatic fascia , is recommended for preoperative potent men without comorbidities and intermediate - or high - risk localised disease , while patients with erectile dysfunction and / or comorbidities , or not interested in sexual activity , should undergo minimal nerve sparing , which is the preservation of cns running at the posterolateral surface of the prostate .
when the disease is clearly extraprostatic , patients should undergo a non - nerve - sparing surgery [ 10 ] .
a recent systematic review of the literature by ficarra et al showed that , for patients undergoing rarp , relevant predictors of postoperative potency are age at surgery , baseline erectile function , and presence of comorbidities .
they reported that nerve - sparing rarp was associated with an incidence of 12 - and 24 - month erectile dysfunction ranging from 10 % to 46 % and from 6 % to 37 % , respectively .
conclusion in conclusion , the authors demonstrated , for the first time , a significant advantage in favour of rarp in comparison with orp in terms of 12 - month potency rates [ 33 ] .

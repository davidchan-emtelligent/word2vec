nephronectin ( npnt ) , an extracellular matrix protein , is a ligand for integrin alpha8beta1 and is involved in the development of various organs , such as the kidneys , bones , liver , and muscles .
previously , we found that npnt expression was inhibited by various cytokines including transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta ) and oncostatin m ( osm ) .
fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) - 2 , otherwise known as basic fgf , also plays important roles in skeletal development and postnatal osteogenesis .
in this study , npnt expression was found to be suppressed by fgf - 2 in mc3t3 - e1 cells , an osteoblast - like cell line , in a dose - and time - dependent manners .
furthermore , fgf - 2 - mediated npnt mrna suppression was shown to involve the jun n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) and phosphoinositide - 3 kinase ( pi3k ) pathways .
together , our results suggest that fgf - 2 suppresses npnt gene expression via jnk and pi3k pathways .

moreover , npnt is the primary ligand for alpha8beta1 integrin and plays an important role in regulation of cell adhesion , differentiation , and spreading , as well as survival of various organs , such as the kidneys , bones , liver , and muscles 1 .
in vivo , npnt expression is particularly prominent at epithelial - mesenchymal interfaces in tissues undergoing morphogenesis 2 , 3 .
therefore , elucidation of how the npnt gene is expressed is important for understanding the association between bone development and cell adhesion 4 , 5 .
mc3t3 - e1 is a cloned mouse osteoblast - like cell line that retains the synthetic functions of bone and has been utilized as an in vitro bone model of development systems .
using mc3t3 - e1 cells , kahai et al .
4 showed that some endogenous mirnas might repress npnt expression , resulting in a lower level of osteoblast differentiation .
other studies have also reported that transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta ) and oncostatin m ( osm ) downregulate npnt expression in both dose - and time - dependent manners , while osteoblast differentiation induced by npnt was found to be inhibited by tgf - beta and osm in mc3t3 - e1 cells 6 , 7 .
results of phylogenetic analysis suggested that 22 different fgf genes can be arranged into seven subfamilies containing 2 - 4 members each 8 .
in another study , various growth factors , including fibroblast growth factor - 2 ( fgf - 2 ) , transforming growth factor - ? ( tgf - beta ) , insulin - like growth factor - 1 ( igf - 1 ) , platelet - derived growth factor , and prostaglandin e2 , were shown to act as autocrine and paracrine hormones for regulation of bone cell proliferation 9 .
fgf - 2 , which is stored in the extracellular matrix and expressed in osteoblasts 10 , influences proliferation and differentiation of a variety of cell types in vitro 11 , 12 .
in bone cell culture experiments , fgf - 2 showed increased replication and reduced differentiation markers , such as alkaline phosphatase and type i collagen 13 , 14 , 15 , thus is considered to have important functions in bone homeostasis .
this study was designed to examine the effects of fgf - 2 on expression of npnt and related molecular mechanisms .
our results revealed that npnt expression in mc3t3 - e1 cells is regulated by fgf - 2 via the jun n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) and phosphoinositide - 3 kinase ( pi3k ) pathways .

results fgf - 2 strongly suppressed npnt expression in fgfs we attempted to determine whether the expression of npnt is regulated by members of the fgf family , including fgf - 1 , fgf - 2 , fgf - 8b , fgf - 9 , and fgf - 23 .
mc3t3 - e1 cells were exposed to each of the investigated fgfs for 24 h , and then , the level of npnt mrna was examined using real - time pcr analysis ( fig. 1a ) .
fgf - 2 showed significant suppression of npnt mrna expression , while suppression by fgf - 1 was also noted , although the level was not as great as seen with fgf - 2. with 1 ng.ml - 1 of fgf - 2 , the expression level of npnt protein was also suppressed in mc3t3 - e1 cells after 24 h of incubation ( fig. 1b ) .
thus , we exposed mc3t3 - e1 cells to various doses of fgf - 2 for 24 h and found that downregulation of npnt expression occurred in a dose - dependent manner , with the level reaching a plateau at ~ 1 ng.ml - 1 ( fig. 2a ) .
finally , we investigated time - dependent suppression by fgf - 2 at a dose of 1 ng.ml - 1 and detected a significant decrease in npnt mrna at 6 h after its addition to culture ( fig. 2b ) .
the rate of npnt expression by cells treated with fgf - 2 as compared to untreated cells was decreased in a time - dependent manner , with the level reaching a plateau at 24 h ( data not shown ) .
expression of fgfr genes in mc3t3 - e1 cells and their involvement in npnt expression the fgfr ( fgf receptor ) gene family is comprised of four members , fgfr1 - fgfr4 8 .
we found that each was well expressed in kidney specimens , while fgfr1 - 3 were expressed in mc3t3 - e1 cells ( fig. 3a ) .
after treating mc3t3 - e1 cells with bgj398 , an fgfr inhibitor , real - time pcr analysis was performed , which showed that 0.1 mum of bgj398 blocked suppression of npnt mrna induced by 1 ng.ml - 1 of fgf - 2 and restored its expression ( fig. 3b ) .
npnt expression regulated by fgf - 2 via jnk and pi3k pathways fgfr - mediated signaling initiates activation of the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) and pi3k 16 .
downstream of mapk and pi3k , fgfr signaling has been shown to regulate several distinct mapks , including extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( erk ) 1 / 2 , p38 , and jnk 17 , 18 , 19 .
to examine the molecular mechanism of npnt mrna downregulation by fgf - 2 , we first examined its relationship with the mapk pathway .
mc3t3 - e1 cells were treated with fgf - 2 at 1 ng.ml - 1 , followed by 10 mum of pd98059 ( mapk - erk kinase inhibitor ) , sb203580 ( p38 mapk inhibitor ) , or sp600125 ( jnk inhibitor ). of those , treatment with sp600125 inhibited the suppression of npnt mrna expression by fgf - 2 ( fig 4a ) .
to examine the pi3k pathway , mc3t3 - e1 cells were treated with fgf - 2 , then with 10 mum of ly294002 ( pi3k inhibitor ) , which showed that downregulation of npnt mrna expression was inhibited by treatment with ly294002 ( fig. 4b ) .
discussion this study is the first to show that fgf - 2 strongly inhibits npnt mrna expression in a manner related to the jnk and pi3k signaling pathways ( fig. 5 ) .
npnt , which enhances osteoblast differentiation , is expressed in the basement membrane of developing teeth and extracellular matrix of developing jawbones 5 .
in addition , linton et al .
20 showed that embryos lacking a functional npnt gene frequently display kidney agenesis or hypoplasia , which could be traced to a delay in invasion of metanephric mesenchyme by the ureteric bud at an early stage of kidney development .
it has been speculated that kidney disease causes disordered mineral metabolism , resulting in bone disease and ultimately fracture 21 ; thus , it is considered that npnt is closely related to bone metabolism .
the relationship of fgf - 2 with skeleton development and bone metabolism has been reported in several studies .
for example , overexpression of human fgf - 2 in mice ( tgfgf - 2 ) results in dwarfism , with shortening and flattening of long bones and moderate macrocephaly 22 , while its deletion has been shown to lead to decreased levels of bone mass , formation , and mineralization in mice 23 , 24 .
figure 5 fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) - 2 downregulation of npnt gene expression via jnk and pi3k pathways .
following activation by fgf - 2 in mc3t3 - e1 cells , fgfr is coupled to the intracellular signaling pathway , including the jnk and pi3k pathways , and then , npnt expression is suppressed .
a previous study also demonstrated that fgfs activates pi3k signaling 8 ; thus , we investigated whether npnt mrna expression suppressed by fgf - 2 is also regulated via the pi3k pathway .
several different materials , such as igf - 1 25 and ghrelin 26 , have been reported to activate pi3k signaling , while the present results also suggest that these substances may regulate npnt mrna expression .
we used the osteoblast - like mc3t3 - e1 cell line in the present study and also examined primary osteoblasts obtained from calvaria of 1 - day - old mice .
fgf - 2 inhibited the expression of npnt mrna in primary osteoblasts ( fig. s1 ) .
it has also been reported that npnt enhances osteoblast differentiation , while contrasting findings showed that fgf - 2 increases osteoblast differentiation and extracellular matrix mineralization in vitro 27 , 28 , 29 .
similar contradictory results were shown in another study , which found that expression of a transcriptional co - activator with a pdz - binding motif ( taz ) was regulated by fgf - 2 30 .
these results might help to explain the complex mechanisms of fgfs .
conclusions fibroblast growth factor - 2 suppresses npnt mrna expression in mc3t3 - e1 cells in a dose - and time - dependent manner by activation of the jnk and pi3k pathways .
our results suggest novel mechanisms related to npnt gene expression .

owing to biological heterogeneity , the histological diagnosis and expected clinical outcome do not match in a significant number of patients .
the combination of imaging and gene expression , referred to as " radiogenomics ," has the potential to give insight into tumour biology that would be difficult to acquire from either technique alone .
* throwing light upon individual imaging feature and biological / molecular alterations , analyses that may detect subsets of morphologically identical tumours with different clinical behavior ( diagnostic markers ) .
content organisation * classification and grading of gliomas as per haarlem consensus .
* imaging features of glioblastomas may correlate with molecular mutations .
* identification of imaging parameters that has the potential as a non - invasive biomarker for common molecular mutations associated with gliomas and their associated clinical impact .
* review of current radiogenomics literature .
conclusion * given the noninvasive nature of medical imaging and its wide use in clinical practice this approach facilitates the association of complex molecular signatures with readily identifiable imaging characteristics .
* as we move toward a more individualised approach to therapy for glioblastoma on the basis of its specific genetic and biochemical features , radiologists may contribute to the future development of targeted agents for treatment of glioblastoma .

a new layered organic - inorganic nanohybrid material , zinc - aluminum - 3,4 - dicholorophenoxyacetate ( n3,4 - d ) in which an agrochemical , 3,4 - dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( 3,4 - d ) , is intercalated into zinc - aluminum - layered double hydroxide ( zal ) , was synthesized by coprecipitation method .
a well - ordered nanomaterial was formed with a percentage loading of 53.5 % ( w / w ) .
due to the inclusion of 3,4 - d , basal spacing expanded from 8.9 a in zal to 18.7 a in n3,4 - d. the fourier transform infrared study shows that the absorption bands of the resulting nanohybrid composed of both the 3,4 - d and zal further confirmed the intercalation episode .
thermal analysis shows that zal host enhances the thermal stability of 3,4 - d. controlled - release experiment shows that the release of 3,4 - d in the aqueous media is in the order of phosphate > carbonate > sulfate > chloride .
these studies demonstrate the successful intercalation of the 3,4 - d and its controlled release property in various aqueous media .
nanohybrid 3 , 4 - dichlorophenoxyacetic acid layered double hydroxide anionic clay background in modern agriculture , various agrochemicals such as pesticides , herbicides , and plant regulators are widely used for effective pest management and ensuring optimum crop yield .
most herbicide formulations deliver the bulk of the active agents in an immediately available form that can be readily released to the environment [ 1 ] .
for highly soluble pesticides , these formulations may result in great pesticide losses shortly after application before the molecules have time to diffuse into soil aggregates and reach adsorption sites in soil colloids [ 2 ] .
this phenomenon leads to pesticide residues in the food chain , and this , in turn , has adverse effects in humans including carcinogenic , mutagenic , and teratogenic effects [ 3 ] .
contamination of pesticides through volatilization , leaching , runoff , and the persistence of agrochemicals in aqueous media has become a concerning environmental issue [ 4,5 ] .
in addition , agrochemicals are highly toxic to wildlife ( especially mammals ) and other organisms and can remain in the aquatic environment for a long time [ 6 ] .
much effort was done focusing on ways to reduce the usage of excessive agrochemicals by the development of less hazardous formulations , such as controlled release formulations , in which only a part of the active ingredient is in an immediately available form and the bulk of the herbicide is sorbed in an inert support [ 1,7 ] .
this strategy is advantageous since it allows the gradual release of agrochemicals over time , besides preventing instant loss of agrochemicals through volatilization , leaching , and runoff [ 8 ] .
moreover , it requires less energy and manpower than the conventional methods , leading to decreased nontarget effect and increased safety for agrochemical applicators [ 9,10 ] .
clay has become one of the popular materials as a host of herbicides due to its unique properties such as high specific surface areas associated with their small particle size and ubiquitous occurrence in most soil and sediment environment [ 11 - 17 ] .
one of the classes in the clay family is layered double hydroxide ( ldh ) or the so - called hydrotalcite - like compounds ( hts ) .
this special material can be used as support in controlled - release formulations and has been proposed as the ideal solution to environmental problems caused by agrochemicals .
ldhs or hts are brucite - like layered materials with the general formula [ mii1 - x miiix ( oh ) 2 ] x +( am - ) x / n.mh2o , where mii and miii are divalent and trivalent cations , respectively , and xn - is the interlayer anion , which balances the positive charge generated by the presence of miii in the layers .
the layer charge is determined by the molar ratio x = miii /( miii + mii ) which can vary between 0.2 and 0.4 [ 18 ] .
ldhs have attracted the attention of the industry and academia because of their anion - exchange capability [ 19 ] , low cost , ease of preparation , environmental compatibility ( especially in agricultural application ) , and potential use in pharmaceuticals , detergents , and food additives [ 20 ] .
3,4 - dichlorophenoxy acetic acid ( 3,4 - d ) ( figure 1 ) is an organic anion used widely in modern agriculture to control weeds in paddy field and wheat and corn plantations [ 21 ] .
figure 1 molecular structure of 3,4 - dichlorophenoxy acetic acid .
in this study , the intercalation of 3,4 - dichlorophenoxyacetic acid into the interlamellae of zinc - aluminum - layered double hydroxide ( zal ) was accomplished by a simple direct self - assembly method for the formation of a new organic - inorganic nanohybrid material .
the physicochemical properties and the controlled release of the agrochemical were investigated and discussed .
methods all chemicals used in this synthesis were obtained from various chemical suppliers and used without further purification .
zinc nitrate ( zn ( no3 ) 2.6h2o , 98 % , chempurpiekary slaskie , poland ) and aluminum nitrate ( al ( no3 ) 3.9h2o , 98 % , chempurpiekary slaskie , poland ) were used as the sources of cations while 3,4 - dichlorophenoxy acetic acid ( c9h9clo3 , 95 % , sigma - aldrich corporation , st. louis , mo , usa ) was used as the starting material of the guest anion .
all solutions were prepared using deionized water .
synthesis of materials the synthesis of zn - al - 3,4d nanocomposites was performed by self - assembly method from a mixed aqueous solution of 0.1 m zn ( no3 ) 2.6h2o and 0.025 m al ( n03 ) 3.9h2o at various concentrations of 3,4d ranging from 0.0035 to 0.5 m. naoh ( 2 m ) was then added to the mixture with vigorous stirring under nitrogen atmosphere at a constant ph of 7.5 +/ - 0.02 .
the precipitate was aged for 18 h in an oil bath shaker at 70degreesc , filtered , thoroughly washed , and dried in a vacuum oven at 70degreesc .
the resulting nanocomposite was finely ground , kept in a sample bottle , and stored in a vacuum desiccator for further use and characterization .
a similar procedure was performed for the preparation of zal except the addition of 3,4d .
characterization powder x - ray diffraction ( pxrd ) patterns were recorded on a rigaku model ultima iv powder lambda diffractometer ( rigaku corporation , tokyo , japan ) using filtered cu - kalpha radiation ( lambda = 1.540562 a ) at 40 kv , 20 ma , and 2degrees min - 1 .
fourier transform infrared ( ftir ) spectra were recorded using a perkinelmer x1,725 spectrophotometer ( perkinelmer , waltham , ma , usa ) in the range of 400 to 4,000 cm - 1 .
finely ground 1 % samples in kbr powder were compressed to obtain a pellet , and the pellet was then used to obtain the ir spectra .
thermogravimetric and differential thermogravimetric analyses ( tga / dtg ) were carried out using a mettler toledo tga / sdta851 thermogravimetric analyzer ( mettler toledo inc. , columbus , oh , usa ) with a heating rate of 10degreesc min - 1 between 35degreesc and 1,000degreesc , under a nitrogen flow rate of 50 ml min - 1 .
the elemental analysis was performed using a chns analyzer ( model chns - 932 , leco corporation , st. joseph , mi , usa ) together with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry using a perkinelmer spectrophotometer ( model optima 2000dv ) under standard condition .
results and discussion powder x - ray diffraction figure 2 shows the pxrd patterns of the zal and its nanohybrid material , zinc - aluminum - 3,4 - dicholorophenoxyacetate ( n3,4 - d ) , prepared using various concentrations of 3,4 - d from 0.0035 to 0.5 m. as shown in the figure , the basal spacing of zal , which contains nitrate ion as the counter anion in the interlayer , was recorded to be 8.9 a which is in a good agreement with the sum of the thickness of the anion , no3 - ( 4.1 a ) , and the brucite - like layer ( 4.8 a ) [ 22 ] .
the increasing basal spacing from 8.9 to 24.8 a in the resulting nanocomposite , n3,4 - d , was due to the inclusion of the new anion 3,4 - d , which is bigger than nitrate , into the interlamellae space .
this shows that 3,4 - d has higher affinity toward zal compared to the counter anion ( nitrate ) .
when the concentration of 3,4 - d was increased from 0.3 to 0.5 m , we observed that the reflection peaks at around 2theta = 0.4degrees became broad especially for 003 reflections showing a mix phase of the material due to the 3,4 - d absorbed on the surface of zal .
the best well - ordered nanocomposite was synthesized with 0.1 m which produced a sharp , symmetric , high - intensity peak , especially for 003 and 006 reflection peaks .
this sample was then chosen for further characterization .
figure 2 pxrd patterns of zal and its nanohybrids prepared at various concentrations of 3,4 - d ( 0.035 to 0.5 m ) .
ftir spectroscopy the ftir spectra for zal ( figure 3 ( curve a )) showed a broad and strong band in the range of 3,200 to 3,600 cm - 1 centered at 3,454 cm - 1 which is due to the o - h stretching vibration of the inorganic layers and interlayer water molecules .
another common wave number for the ldh - like material is a band at 1,637 cm - 1 which is assigned to the bending vibration of interlayer water molecules .
for zal , a strong absorption centered at 1,378 cm - 1 is assigned to the nitrate stretching vibration .
a band in the lower wave number region corresponds to the lattice vibration mode such as the translation of zn - oh at 611 cm - 1 and the vibration of oh - zn - al - oh at 427 cm - 1 [ 23 ] .
the ftir spectrum of pure 3,4 - d shows a broad band at 3,459 cm - 1 , which is attributed to the o - h stretching vibration .
a band at 1,713 cm - 1 is due to the c = o stretching .
bands at 1,469 and 1,400 cm - 1 are attributed to the stretching vibration of aromatic ring c = c. bands at 1,288 and 1,219 cm - 1 are due to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes of c - o - c , respectively .
a sharp band at 861 cm - 1 is attributed to c - cl stretching [ 24 ] .
the ftir spectra for the nanocomposite ( n3,4 - d ) show a broad absorption band at around 3,400 cm - 1 which arises from the stretching mode of oh groups in the brucite - like layer and / or physisorbed water .
a band at 1,595 cm - 1 is attributed to the carboxylate functional group of the intercalated 3,4 d anion .
a band at 1,426 cm - 1 can be attributed to the c = c bond vibration of the aromatic group .
a band at 1,220 cm - 1 corresponds to asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of c - o - c , respectively .
figure 3 ftir spectra of zal ( a ) , pure 3,4 - d ( b ) , and n3,4 - d nanocomposite ( c ) .
elemental analysis table 1 shows the elemental and organic content of zal and n3,4 - d nanocomposites .
as shown in table 1 , the molar ratio of zn to al in both zal and n3,4 - d is 3.6 and 3.7 , respectively , which is close to the initial value of the zn to al ratio in the mother liquor .
the zal contains about 3.1 % ( w / w ) nitrogen which is in agreement with the presence of a strong , sharp band at 1,378 cm - 1 in the ftir spectrum that corresponds to the nitrate group in zal .
the percentage of 3,4 - d intercalated into the interlayer of zal is 53.5 % ( w / w ) , estimated from the carbon content of about 23.2 % ( w / w ) , indicating that intercalation of 3,4 - d has actually taken place .

the surface area and porosity of zal and n3,4 - d obtained by the nitrogen adsorption - desorption method are given in table 1 .
the successful intercalation has increased the brunauer - emmett - teller ( bet ) surface area from 1.3 m2 g - 1 in zal to 3.0 m2 g - 1 in n3,4 - d. the change in pore texture with larger width , as a result of the modification by the intercalation of 3,4 - d into the zal interlayer , which is in agreement with the expansion of basal spacing from the resulting nanohybrid ( figure 1 ) is thought to be the reason .
surface properties the nitrogen adsorption - desorption isotherms ( figure 4 ) for zal and n3,4 - d show type iv material in the iupac classification , indicating a mesopore type of material .
the adsorption branch of the hysteresis loop for the n3,4 - d is wider than the one for ldh , indicating a different pore texture .
this can be related to the expansion of basal spacing when nitrate is replaced by 3,4 - d during the formation of the nanocomposite .
figure 4 nitrogen adsorption - desorption isotherms of zal and their nanohybrids ( n3,4 - d ) ( a ) and pore size distribution ( b ) .
figure 4b shows the barret - joyner - halenda ( bjh ) desorption pore size distribution for 3,4 - d and its nanohybrid ( n3,4 - d ) .
the summary of pore volume and pore diameter is given in table 1 .
a sharp peak at 200.5 a and a low - intensity sharp peak at 600.9 a can be observed .
on the other hand , ldh also showed a sharp peak at around 400 a , and the pore size of ldh is lower compared to that of n3,4 - d ( table 1 ) .
this may have resulted from the formation of interstitial pores between the crystallite , different particle sizes , morphology , and aggregation during the formation of the nanohybrid .
the surface morphology of n3,4 - d ( figure 5b ) shows an agglomerate , porous , granular structure of n3,4 - d compared to the nonporous morphology of zal ( figure 5a ) .
figure 5 surface morphology of ( a ) zal and n3,4 - d ( b ) .
thermal analysis the tga - dtg profiles of zal , pure 3,4 - d , and n3,4 - d nanocomposites are shown in figure 6 .
the tga - dtg curves of n3,4 - d reveal four weight losses occurring at 116.9degreesc , 219.1degreesc , 417.2degreesc , and 963.2degreesc that amounted 4.38 % , 3.25 % , 47.0 % , and 19.7 % , respectively .
the first weight loss is due to the removal of surface - physisorbed water molecules , and the second stage is attributed to the removal of the interlayer anion and dehydroxylation of the hydroxyl layer .
the third weight loss at 417.2degreesc corresponds to the major decomposition of the organic moiety in the interlayer of the nanohybrid , leaving only a relatively less volatile metal oxide .
the weight loss of 6.7 % that occurred at around 963.2degreesc is due to the decomposition of the more stable compound of the inorganic layered composition of the nanohybrid by combustion reaction [ 25 ] .
the decomposition temperature for pure 3,4 - d is 270.1degreesc , but the thermal stability of 3,4 - d is greatly improved after intercalation between the ldh layer which is 417.2degreesc , implying that zal can be used as an alternative inorganic matrix for storing an active organic moiety with better thermal stability .
figure 6 tga - dta thermograms of zal ( a ) , pure 3,4 - d ( b ) , and n3,4 - d nanocomposite ( c ) .
release profile of the 3,4 - d into various aqueous solutions release profiles of 3,4 - d from the nanohybrid composite , n3,4 - d , into various aqueous solutions , sodium phosphate , sodium carbonate , sodium sulfate , and sodium chloride ( 0.005 m ) , are shown in figure 7 .
figure 7 release profiles of 3,4 - d from n3,4 - d into 0.005 m aqueous solutions containing po43 - , co32 - , so42 - , and cl - . the accumulated release of 3,4 - d into various aqueous solutions containing phosphate , carbonate , sulfate , and chloride anions increased with contact time .
the release of the 3,4 - d from the nanohybrid was fast for the first 200 min , followed by a slower one subsequently before reaching the saturated release at approximately 300 and 500 min for po43 - and cl - and co32 - and so42 - , respectively .
saturated release of the anions is in the order of phosphate > carbonate > sulfate > chloride with percentages of saturated release of 75 % , 40 % , 27 % , and 11 % , respectively .
the highest saturated release of 3,4 - d in the po43 - aqueous solution is due to the high charge density of the anion ( po43 - ) , whereas the lowest saturated release of 3,4 - d was in the aqueous solution containing cl - . this shows that the saturated release for the aqueous media toward the anion encapsulates in ldh agreed with the previous work by miyata et al .
[ 26 ] .
this result suggests that the charge density of the anion to be exchanged with 3,4 - d plays a vital role in determining the saturated release of the 3,4 - d from the nanohybrid into the aqueous media .
kinetic release for quantitative analysis , the data from the release study were fitted into zeroth - order ( equation 1 ) , first - order ( equation 2 ) , parabolic diffusion ( equation 3 ) , and pseudo - second - order kinetic models ( equation 4 ) .
the equations are given as follows : ( 1 ) ct = kt + c ( 2 ) - log1 - ct = kt + c ( 3 ) ct / ceq = c + kt0.5 ( 4 ) t / ct = 1 / k2c2eq + 1 / qet figure 8 shows the release profiles of 3,4 - d fitted to the first - order , parabolic diffusion , and pseudo - second - order kinetic models .
the corresponding rate constant , k , together with regression value , r2 , obtained from the fittings is summarized in table 2 .
the release of 3,4 - d into so42 - , co32 - , po43 - , and cl - aqueous solutions was formed to follow the pseudo - second - order kinetic models with r2 close to 1 .
the t ( 1 / 2 ) values , the time it takes for the concentration of 3,4 - d to be at half of the accumulated saturated release , were found to be 39 , 56 , 74 , and 78 min for 3,4 - d release in phosphate , carbonate , sulfate , and chloride aqueous solutions , respectively .
the t ( 1 / 2 ) values are in the order of phosphate < carbonate < sulfate < chloride which followed the release rate of the organic moieties in the aqueous solution mentioned above , as t ( 1 / 2 ) is inversely proportional to the release rate [ 27 ] .

conclusions a herbicide compound , 3,4 - d , was successfully intercalated into the layer of zal for the formation of a new organic - inorganic hybrid nanocomposite , n3,4 - d , which shows a potential to be used as a controlled - release formulation in agrochemicals .
the interlayer spacing of ldh increased from 8.9 to 18.72 a in the n3,4 - d due to the inclusion of 3,4 - d into the zn - al - ldh interlayer space .
release of 3,4 - d from the zn - al - layered inorganic host follows pseudo - second - order kinetic models with regression values of 0.959 to 1 .
this study suggests the possibility of zinc - aluminum - layered double hydroxide to be used as a carrier host for 3,4 - d for the generation of environmentally friendly agrochemicals .

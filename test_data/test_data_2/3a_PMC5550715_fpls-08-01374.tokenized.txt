myb transcription factors play important roles in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress .
in this study , taodorant1 , a r2r3 - myb gene , was cloned from wheat ( triticum aestivum l. ) .
taodorant1 was localized in the nucleus and functioned as a transcriptional activator .
taodorant1 was up - regulated in wheat under peg6000 , nacl , aba , and h2o2 treatments .
taodorant1 - overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants exhibited higher relative water content and lower water loss rate under drought stress , as well as lower na + accumulation in leaves under salt stress .
the transgenic plants showed higher cat activity but lower ion leakage , h2o2 and malondialdehyde contents under drought and salt stresses .
besides , the transgenic plants also exhibited higher sod activity under drought stress .
our results also revealed that taodorant1 overexpression up - regulated the expression of several ros - and stress - related genes in response to both drought and salt stresses , thus enhancing transgenic tobacco plants tolerance .
our studies demonstrate that taodorant1 positively regulates plant tolerance to drought and salt stresses .
wheat abiotic stress myb antioxidation system stress related genes introduction plants are very often subjected to unfavorable environmental conditions , such as high salinity , drought , and extreme temperatures , which adversely affect plant growth , development , and productivity .
to adapt to such environmental conditions , complex response mechanisms have been evolved in plants , including transcriptional regulation networks for the transduction of stress signals .
the implementation of these intricate networks depends on the participation of various transcription factors ( tfs ) , such as myb , nac , ap2 / erf , bzip , bhlh , and wrky ( qin et al. , 2011 ; chen et al. , 2012 ) .
the myb superfamily plays a crucial role in abiotic stress responses .
the first known myb gene , isolated from maize ( zea mays ) and designated colored1 ( c1 ) , is required for anthocyanin synthesis in the aleurone of maize kernels ( paz - ares et al. , 1987 ) .
the myb superfamily has been identified and analyzed in arabidopsis and rice ( dubos et al. , 2010 ; katiyar et al. , 2012 ) .
the myb superfamily is divided into four subgroups based on the number of conserved myb - domain repeats , i.e. , a single or partial myb repeat protein myb1r , two repeats protein r2r3 - myb , three repeats protein myb3r , and four r1 / r2 - like repeats protein 4r - myb ( dubos et al. , 2010 ) .
several lines of evidence demonstrate that numerous r2r3 - myb proteins function in response to abiotic stress .
in arabidopsis , atmyb96 overexpression enhances drought tolerance by integrating the aba and auxin signaling pathways , while at the same time improving freezing and drought tolerance by regulating the target gene ltp3 ( seo et al. , 2009 ; guo et al. , 2013 ) .
meanwhile , atmyb44 and atmyb60 participate in plant responses to drought stress by regulating stomatal movement ( cominelli et al. , 2005 ; jung et al. , 2008 ) .
atmyb20 - overexpressing arabidopsis plants display salt - stress tolerance but susceptible to desiccation ( cui et al. , 2013 ; gao et al. , 2014 ) .
atmyb14 and atmyb15 are known to participate in plant adaptation to freezing temperatures ( agarwal et al. , 2006 ; chen et al. , 2013 ) .
in rice ( oryza sativa ) , the r2r3 - type myb gene osmyb91 is involved in salt - stress tolerance and plant growth ( zhu et al. , 2015 ) .
osmyb2 has been implicated in tolerance to salt , freezing , and dehydration ( yang et al. , 2012 ) .
in addition , myb3r and myb - related proteins , such as osmyb511 , osmyb48 - 1 , osmyb4 , and osmyb3r - 2 , are known to be involved in stress adaptation ( dai et al. , 2007 ; pasquali et al. , 2008 ; xiong et al. , 2014 ; huang p. et al. , 2015 ) .
gbmyb5 improves drought tolerance in transgenic cotton and tobacco plants ( chen et al. , 2015 ) .
overexpression of lean2 , initially isolated from tomato plants , positively regulates responses to chilling and oxidative stresses in tobacco plants ( meng et al. , 2014 ) .
given that wheat ( triticum aestivum l. ) is a major grain crop , studies on the response of wheat to various adverse environments have attracted increasing attention .
significant progress in wheat genome sequencing has been achieved in recent years , laying the foundations for successful gene identification and isolation ( jia et al. , 2013 ; ling et al. , 2013 ; choulet et al. , 2014 ; mayer et al. , 2014 ) .
although many myb genes have been identified in wheat , only a few have so far been characterized .
abiotic stress can induce tamyb1 expression in the roots of wheat plants ( lee et al. , 2006 ). of the seven myb gene fragments that were identified by rahaie et al .
( 2010 ) , tamybsdul was suggested to improve salt and drought tolerance in wheat ( rahaie et al. , 2010 ) .
tapimp1 overexpression enhances disease , drought , and salt stress resistance in both transgenic tobacco and wheat ( liu et al. , 2011 ; zhang z.y. et al. , 2012 ) .
arabidopsis plants that overexpress tamyb19 also show an improved tolerance to abiotic stress ( zhang et al. , 2014 ) .
in the present study , taodorant1 , a r2r3 - type myb transcription factor gene , was cloned from wheat ( t. aestivum cv. chinese spring ) .
gene expression profiles revealed that taodorant1 was up - regulated under high salinity , peg6000 , h2o2 , and aba treatments .

then the total rna of the seedlings was extracted to analyze the expression of stress - induced genes by qrt - pcr .
the specific primers used are listed in supplementary table s1 .
the ntubiqutin gene was selected as the internal control .

results identification of taodorant1 wheat myb expressed sequence tags ( ests ) were obtained by searching the ncbi unigene database8 with known arabidopsis and rice myb sequences listed in supplementary table s3 .
the obtained ests were assembled into longer cdna sequences .
a cdna sequence was selected based on the data acquired from an expression database3 ( supplementary figure s3 ) .
the accuracy and integrity of this cdna sequence were confirmed by ensembl plants4 and iwgsc5 .
the putative myb gene was identified and cloned from wheat .
the cloned cdna sequence is 1,039 - bp long containing a 798 - bp orf , which was predicted to encode a 265 amino acid protein with a relative molecular mass of 29.211 kda and an isoelectric point of 6.17 .
a phylogenetic tree was generated with this myb sequence and its orthologs from different plant species .
phylogenetic analysis showed that the myb sequence had the closest relationship with protein odorant1 from aegilops tauschii ( figure 1a ) .
therefore , the putative myb gene was designated taodorant1 .
aligning taodorant1 with homologous proteins from other plant species revealed two conversed repeats in the dna - binding domain , which classified taodorant1 to the r2r3 - type myb subfamily ( figure 1b ) .

subcellular localization and transactivation activity analysis of taodorant1 to confirm the localization of taodorant1 in vivo , a vector that expressed the fused taodorant1 - gfp protein under the control of a maize ubiquitin promoter was constructed .
transient expression of the fused protein gene in onion epidermal cells showed that the fluorescence of taodorant1 - gfp was exclusively localized in the nucleus , whereas that of the control gfp protein was diffused throughout the cell ( figure 2a ) .
these results suggested that taodorant1 was a nuclear - localized protein .

recombinant vector ubiqutin : : taodorant1 - gfp and control vector ubiquitin : : gfp were transformed into onion epidermal cells and observed with fluorescence microscopy , respectively .
( b ) transactivation activity of taodorant1 in yeast .
schematic diagrams illustrate the different portions of taodorant1 orf that were introduced into the pgbkt7 .
recombined vectors were transformed into yeast strain ah109 , and the transformants were screened by sd / - trp , sd / - trp / - his + x - alpha - gal , sd / - trp / - his / - ade + x - alpha - gal media .
( c ) binding activity assay of taodorant1 .
three myb binding motifs i , ii , and iig were fused with phis2 vector , and the taodorant1 orf was fused with pgadt7 vector .
reconstructed pgadt7 and phis2 vectors were co - transformed into yeast strain y187 .
transformants were incubated on sd / - trp / - leu / - his media with different concentrations of 3 - at. three independent biological replicates were performed and produced similar results .
the transactivation activity of taodorant1 was verified with a transactivation assay .
to construct gal4bd - taodorant1 recombinant , complete and various truncated taodorant1 orfs were cloned into pgbkt7 plasmids .
the recombinants were transformed into the yeast strain ah109 to examine the transactivation ability of taodorant1 .
all transformants , including the negative control pgbkt7 , grew well on the sd / - trp medium , while just transformants containing the taodorant1 c - terminal grew well and turned blue on sd - trp / his and sd - trp / his / ade medium with x - alpha - galactoside ( x - alpha - gal ) ( figure 2b ) .
these results indicated that taodorant1 had transactivation activity , which can be attributed to the amino acid residues at c - terminal 171 to 265 .
furthermore , binding activity analysis showed that the fused protein pgadt7 - taodorant1 was able to bind to type ii but not to type i and iig myb binding motifs ( figure 2c ) .
expression pattern analysis of taodorant1 in wheat qrt - pcr was used to examine taodorant1 expression in various wheat organs at different developmental stages .
results showed that taodorant1 was expressed in all examined organs .
the highest transcript levels were observed in the roots of 2 - week - old seedlings .
the lowest expression levels were observed in mature stems ( figure 3a ) .
to gain insight into the function of taodorant1 , its expression levels were measured under various stress treatments .
taodorant1 expression rapidly increased to 6.1 - fold at 1 h , and then gradually returned to normal levels after 3 h to 12 h of 20 % peg6000 treatment .
after 24 h of 20 % peg6000 treatment , taodorant1 expression sharply increased to its highest level of approximately nine - fold ( figure 3b ) .
after treatment with 200 mm nacl , taodorant1 expression increased 2.8 - fold at 1 h and then quickly decreased ( figure 3c ) .
given that aba and h2o2 are induced and accumulate as signal molecules under drought and salt stresses , taodorant1 expression levels were also examined after aba and h2o2 treatments .
under 100 mum aba treatment , taodorant1 expression levels initially increased , gradually reached peak , and then decreased ( figure 3d ) .
under 10 mm h2o2 treatment , taodorant1 expression increased ( 6.8 - fold ) at 1 h and then gradually decreased to a normal level ( figure 3e ) .
these results demonstrated that the expression of taodorant1 in wheat was induced by peg6000 , nacl , h2o2 , and aba .
to further understand the regulatory mechanism of taodorant1 expression , a 1,800 - bp fragment in the promoter region of taodorant1 was cloned and analyzed .
many abiotic stress response elements ( mbs , ltr , hse , arbe , and ere ) were found in the promoter sequence ( supplementary table s2 ) .
based on these results , we speculated that taodorant1 plays a key role in plant response to adverse environments .

ectopic overexpression of taodorant1 enhances drought and salt tolerance in transgenic tobacco seedlings to further investigate the function of taodorant1 in abiotic stress tolerance , transgenic tobacco plants were generated .
then , the expression levels of transgene were detected by semi - qrt - pcr , and result showed that the three taodorant1 - overexpressing lines oe1 , oe3 , and oe12 had higher expression levels .
the copy number of transgene was detected by southern blotting , and the result revealed that one ( oe3 ) or two copies ( oe1 and oe12 ) of taodorant1 were integrated into the genome of these three tobacco plants ( supplementary figure s1 ) .
therefore , these three independent lines were selected to analyze the function of taodorant1 in our study .
under normal conditions , the wt , vc , and oe lines showed similar phenotypes .
for the drought / salt stress tolerance assay of taodorant1 overexpressing plants , the 10 - day - old post - germination seedlings were vertically grown on 1 / 2 ms media that contained 150 / 300 mm mannitol or 150 / 200 mm nacl for 10 days .
the transgenic and control lines showed no difference in growth on 1 / 2 ms plates. by contrast , the growth of the control lines on stress media was more inhibited than that of the oe lines ( figures 4a - e ) .
statistical analysis of root length also showed that the overexpression lines grew better than the control lines under nacl and mannitol treatments ( figure 4f ) .
these results indicated that taodorant1 overexpression enhanced tobacco seedlings tolerance to drought and salt stresses .

drought tolerance assay of taodorant1 overexpression tobacco plants to further investigate drought tolerance of taodorant1 overexpressing plants , water was withheld from 4 - week - old plants in soil for 27 days .
the wt and vc lines became seriously chlorotic at an early stage , wilted , and even died. by contrast , the transgenic lines oe1 , oe3 , and oe12 showed only chlorosis and few deaths ( figure 5a ) .
after re - watering for 1 week , the survival rate of the transgenic plants was 60 - 80 % , which was obviously higher than those of wt and vc (< 20 %) ( figure 5b ) .
the rwc of leaves was measured as an important parameter of drought tolerance .
the oe1 and oe12 lines exhibited higher rwc ( 70 - 80 %) than that of the control plants ( 40 - 45 %) ( figure 5c ) .
consistent with the drought tolerance phenotype , the water loss rate of detached leaves from the wt and vc lines was also higher than those from transgenic lines ( figure 5d ) .
moreover , the wt leaves presented serious coiling after 24 h of dehydration ( figure 5e ) .
as more than 95 % of water loss in plants is via transpiration ( schroeder et al. , 2001 ) , the status of stomatal closure was observed and the stomatal width : length ratio was measured under dehydration or exogenous aba treatments .
result showed that the stomatal aperture of oe1 was smaller than that of the wt ( figures 5f,g ) .
these results demonstrated that taodorant1 positively regulated drought stress response .

salt stress tolerance assay of taodorant1 - overexpressing tobacco plants to analyze the salt stress tolerance of taodorant1 overexpressing plants , 3 - week - old plants were irrigated with 500 mm nacl solution for 19 days .
the wt and vc lines exhibited serious chlorosis and death , whereas the transgenic plants remained green ( figure 6a ) and showed a higher survival rate ( 50 - 60 %) than wt and vc ( figure 6b ) .
the reduced chlorophyll content of the leaves of wt and vc plants also reflected this observed phenotype ( figure 6c ) .
to further understand the mechanism underlying the enhanced salt tolerance of taodorant1 overexpressing plants , na + and k + accumulation in leaves was detected after salt stress .
no significant difference of k + concentration was observed between wt and oe lines ( figure 6e ) .
however , na + concentration was significantly lower in oe lines than wt ( figure 6d ) .
therefore , the k +/ na + ratios in oe lines were higher than that in wt after salt stress ( figure 6f ) .
the expression levels of two representative ion transporter genes were examined by qrt - pcr .
the expression levels of ntsos1 and ntnhx2 were higher in transgenic plants ( oe3 and oe12 ) than those in wt plants ( figures 6g,h ) .
these results suggested that taodorant1 regulates the expression of na + and k + transporter genes , thereby reducing na + accumulation in photosynthetic tissue and improving salt stress tolerance of transgenic plants .

oxidative damage assay of taodorant1 overexpression tobacco plants under drought and salt stresses drought and salt stresses disrupt cellular homeostasis and increase the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , especially o2 - and h2o2 ( polle , 2001 ) .
the histochemical detection of h2o2 and o2 - in leaves was accomplished by dab and nbt staining .
under normal conditions , h2o2 and o2 - contents were relatively lower and not significantly different between wt and oe1 lines .
after drought or nacl treatment , the staining of wt and oe1 leaves was deeper than that seen in the control .
however , the staining of oe1 leaves was lighter than the wt ( figure 7a ) , which indicated that transgenic plants accumulated less h2o2 and o2 - . under normal conditions , il and mda content in the leaves of the wt , vc , and oe lines were not significantly different .
after drought stress , the accumulation of mda in oe3 was significantly less than wt and vc. after salt stress , the accumulation of mda in transgenic plants ( oe1 , oe3 , and oe12 ) was significantly lower when compared with the wt and vc. moreover , the wt and vc leaves presented severe il compared with transgenic plants after drought and salt stresses ( figures 7b,c ) .
these results indicated that taodorant1 overexpression decreased the oxidative damage caused by drought and salt stresses .

overexpression of taodorant1 regulates the expression levels of antioxidation - related genes and improves the activity of antioxidative enzymes under drought and salt stresses an efficient antioxidation system , that alleviates oxidative damage , is required to enhance drought and salt tolerance ( bartels and sunkar , 2005 ) .
the expression levels of cat , sod , and pod genes , related to ros - scavenging enzymes , were examined by qrt - pcr .
after drought stress , the transcription levels of cat , sod , and pod were higher in oe lines than those in wt ( figures 8a - c ) .
on the other hand , expression of the respiratory burst oxidase homolog ( rbohf ) , a ros producer , significantly decreased in the oe lines ( figure 8d ) .
h2o2 content and antioxidative enzyme activities in leaves were detected after drought stress .
the results showed that oe lines exhibited higher activities of cat and sod , and less h2o2 accumulation than the wt and vc after drought stress ( figures 8e - g ) .
however , pod activity was not significantly different between the oe lines and the control ( figure 8h ) .
after salt treatment , the cat transcript levels were higher in the oe3 and oe12 lines than those in the wt ( figure 8i ) .
enhanced cat activity , which directly decomposes h2o2 , reduced accumulation of h2o2 in transgenic plants ( figures 8j,k ) .
however , sod and pod activities were not significantly different between the oe lines and the control ( supplementary figure s2 ) .
these results showed that taodorant1 enhanced ros - scavenging ability by activating the activities of different enzymes in response to drought and salt stresses .

taodorant1 regulates the expressions of stress - related genes under drought and salt stresses to further understand the functional mechanisms of taodorant1 at the molecular level , qrt - pcr was used to examine the levels of stress - related genes , including ntnced3 ( 9 - cis - epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase ) , nterd10c / d ( early responsive to dehydration ) , ntabf2 ( aba - responsive element binding ) , ntlea5 ( late embryogenesis - abundant protein ) , tobltp1 ( lipid - transfer protein ) , ntp5cs1 ( delta1 - pyrroline - 5 - carhoxylate synthetase 1 ) , ntsamdc ( s - adenosyl - l - methionine decarboxylase ) , and ntadc ( arginine decarboxylase ) .
under 300 mm mannitol or 150 mm nacl treatment , the expression levels of ntnced3 , nterd10c , nterd10d , ntlea5 , ntabf2 , tobltp1 , ntp5cs1 , ntsamdc , and ntadc were higher in transgenic lines ( oe3 and oe12 ) than those in wt. however , the expression of some related genes in oe1 were not significantly induced after drought and salt stresses ( figure 9 ) .
these results suggested that taodorant1 overexpression in tobacco plants enhanced the drought and salt tolerance by regulating the expression of stress - related genes .

discussion biotic and abiotic stresses seriously influence the growth , development , and productivity of crop plants .
therefore , stress tolerance genes should be explored for the genetic improvement of crops .
although many tfs involved in plants abiotic stress have been identified and characterized , few myb genes have so far been characterized in wheat .
furthermore , the mechanisms through which myb genes enhance plant drought and salt stress tolerance remain unclear .
in our study , a r2r3 - type myb gene taodorant1 was cloned .
sequence alignment showed that taodorant1 had 98 % identity with protein odorant1 ( emt12444 ) from a. tauschii which has yet to be functionally characterized .
promoter element analysis suggested that taodorant1 may be involved in responses to abiotic stress in plants .
for example , the mbs cis - element is observed in the promoter of rd29 , which has been identified to be a typical desiccation - responsive gene ( yamaguchi - shinozaki and shinozaki , 1993 ) .
the up - regulated expression of taodorant1 in wheat after peg6000 , nacl , aba , and h2o2 treatments , also suggested that this gene was involved in abiotic stress in plants ( figure 3b ) .
tobacco plants that over - expressed taodorant1 had enhanced drought and salt stress tolerance ( figures 4 - 6 ) , which is similar to the function of other myb genes in wheat ( mao et al. , 2011 ; he et al. , 2012 ; qin et al. , 2012 ; zhang l.c. et al. , 2012 ) .
under drought stress , stomatal closure in taodorant1 transgenic plants was more sensitive to dehydration and aba treatments than that in wt plants .
moreover , taodorant1 - overexpressing plants had higher rwc and lower water loss in leaves ( figures 5c - g ) .
chen et al .
( 2015 ) also observed that gbmyb5 decreased stomatal aperture and reduced water loss rate in transgenic tobacco under drought stress .
a reduced rate of water loss is crucial for plant survival under drought conditions .
transpiration , the process by which water is transported to leaves and released vapor through stomatal pores , is the principal pathway leading to water loss .
acting as a signal molecule , aba perceives stresses and triggers changes in guard cells that stimulate stomatal closure , thus reducing transpiration ( raghavendra et al. , 2010 ) .
these results agreed with previous reports for tamyb3r1 , atmyb44 , and atmyb60 , all of which have been showed to decrease the stomatal aperture in response to drought / osmotic stress ( cominelli et al. , 2005 ; jung et al. , 2008 ; cai et al. , 2015 ) .
these results suggested that taodorant1 might be involved in aba - mediated stomatal closure in adaptation to adverse environmental conditions .
under salt stress , a higher na + concentration disrupts ion homeostasis , which contributes to na + toxicity and disrupts k + homeostasis in the cytosol .
na + concentration in the cytoplasm is maintained by restricting na + uptake , promoting na + extrusion across the plasma membrane , and sequestering na + in vacuoles under a high - salt environment ( bartels and sunkar , 2005 ) .
the gene sos1 encodes a plasma membrane na +/ h + antiporter that transports na + out of cells and partitions na + between plant organs .
atsos1 overexpression improves salt tolerance in tobacco by maintaining higher k +/ na + ratios ( yue et al. , 2012 ) .
the slsos1 antiporter not only maintains ion homeostasis , but also partitions na + to stems to reduce na + contents in photosynthetic tissues ( olias et al. , 2009 ) .
coincidentally , the sbsos1 antiporter partitions na + to stem and xylem tissues to reduce na + in leaves and roots , thereby enhancing the salt stress tolerance of tobacco plants ( yadav et al. , 2012 ) .
the gene nhx2 encodes a k + and na +/ h + antiporter , which is localized in the tonoplast .
atnhx2 , as a salt tolerance determinant , functions in compartmentalizing na + in the vacuole ( yokoi et al. , 2002 ) .
in the present study , compared with wt , taodorant1 - overexpressing lines exhibited elevated ntsos1 and ntnhx2 expression levels and increased k +/ na + ratio in leaves after salt stress ( figures 6c - f ) .
these results demonstrated that taodorant1 increased the k +/ na + ratio in leaves by regulating ion transporters to enhance tolerance to salt stress .
drought and salt stresses can lead to redundant ros accumulation , resulting in severe oxidative damage in plants .
ros accumulation causes peroxidation of membrane lipids , which produces a mass of degradation products , such as mda ( moore and roberts , 1998 ) .
ros accumulation is also responsible for severe electrolyte leakage .
demidchik et al .
( 2014 ) indicated that ros - activated outwardly rectifying k + channels resulted in k + release , a major component of electrolyte leakage , from plant cells .
to scavenge ros accumulation , plants form an enzymatic system that consists of ros - scavenging enzymes , such as sod , cat , and pod .
under drought stress , the expression levels and the enzyme activities of sod and cat were higher in transgenic plants than those in control plants .
meanwhile , the expression levels of rbohf , which encodes a ros producer , decreased in oe plants ( figures 8a - f ) .
under salt stress , both expression level and enzyme activity of cat were higher in transgenic plants ( figures 8i,j ) .
however , pod activity under drought stress as well as pod and sod activities under salt stress were not significantly increased compared with the wt ( figure 8h and supplementary figure s2 ) .
the results indicated that the antioxidative system is complicated .
antioxidant capacity is very much dependent on the severity and type of stress .
under different stress treatments , various plants may favor one mechanism to preferentially scavenge redundant ros ( dat et al. , 2000 ) .
the alleviative oxidative damage in transgenic tobacco plants was corroborated by decreased il , and h2o2 and mda contents ( figures 7 , 8g,k ) .
these results demonstrated that taodorant1 activated the ros - scavenging system to relieve oxidative damage and enhance drought and salt tolerance .
to further understand the mechanism of enhanced stress tolerance in taodorant1 - overexpressing transgenic plants , the transcript levels of several stress - related genes were examined .
nced encodes the rate - limiting enzyme of aba biosynthesis and accumulation ( qin and zeevaart , 1999 ) .
abf2 encodes a bzip tf that specifically binds to the abre cis - element ; this tf is involved in the aba signal pathway , which responds to abiotic stress ( yoshida et al. , 2010 ) .
lea5 and erd10 ( c / d ) encode group 2 and group 5 lea proteins , respectively ; these proteins maintain the structural stability of proteins and membranes ( amara et al. , 2012 ) .
the lipid - transfer protein gene ltp1 is induced by aba , cold , drought , and salt stress ( hu et al. , 2013 ) .
the enzyme genes ntp5cs1 , ntsamdc , and ntadc participate in biosynthesis of the osmoprotectants proline and polyamine , which function in resisting adverse environments by adjusting osmotic balance and protecting plasma membrane integrity ( bartels and sunkar , 2005 ) .
all the above - mentioned genes were up - regulated in taodorant1 - overexpressing tobacco plants under drought and salt stresses ( figure 9 ) .
these results demonstrated that taodorant1 improves the transcription of stress - related genes in response to drought and salt stresses .
the result agreed with previous studies that the stress tolerance of transgenic plants was enhanced by up - regulating the expression of stress related genes ( hu et al. , 2013 ; wang et al. , 2015 ) .
in summary , taodorant1 is a myb transcriptional activator that is induced by peg6000 , nacl , aba , and h2o2 in wheat .
taodorant1 overexpression in tobacco enhances drought and salt tolerance by increasing rwc and decreasing water loss , as well as reducing h2o2 , mda , and na + accumulation .
moreover , taodorant1 overexpression improves the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the expression of stress - related genes .
future study of the direct downstream gene or protein targets of taodorant1 will contribute to further elucidation of the mechanisms of taodorant1 - mediated stress tolerance .

background mechanical ventilation via automated in - hospital ventilators is quite common during cardiopulmonary resuscitation .
it is not known whether different inspiratory triggering sensitivity settings of ordinary ventilators have different effects on actual ventilation , gas exchange and hemodynamics during resuscitation .
methods 18 pigs enrolled in this study were anaesthetized and intubated .
continuous chest compressions and mechanical ventilation ( volume - controlled mode , 100 % o2 , respiratory rate 10 / min , and tidal volumes 10ml / kg ) were performed after 3 minutes of ventricular fibrillation .
group trig - 4 , trig - 10 and trig - 20 ( six pigs each ) were characterized by triggering sensitivities of 4 , 10 and 20 ( cmh2o for pressure - triggering and l / min for flow - triggering ) , respectively .
additionally , each pig in each group was mechanically ventilated using three types of inspiratory triggering ( pressure - triggering , flow - triggering and turned - off triggering ) of 5 minutes duration each , and each animal matched with one of six random assortments of the three different triggering settings .
blood gas samples , respiratory and hemodynamic parameters for each period were all collected and analyzed .
results in each group , significantly lower actual respiratory rate , minute ventilation volume , mean airway pressure , arterial ph , pao2 , and higher end - tidal carbon dioxide , aortic blood pressure , coronary perfusion pressure , paco2 and venous oxygen saturation were observed in the ventilation periods with a turned - off triggering setting compared to those with pressure - or flow - triggering ( all p < 0.05 ) , except when compared with pressure - triggering of 20 cmh2o ( respiratory rate 10.5 [ 10 / 11.3 ]/ min vs 12.5 [ 10.8 / 13.3 ]/ min , p = 0.07 ; coronary perfusion pressure 30.3 [ 24.5 / 31.6 ] mmhg vs 27.4 [ 23.7 / 29 ] mmhg , p = 0.173 ; venous oxygen saturation 46.5 [ 32 / 56.8 ]% vs 41.5 [ 33.5 / 48.5 ]% , p = 0.575 ) .
conclusions ventilation with pressure - or flow - triggering tends to induce hyperventilation and deteriorating gas exchange and hemodynamics during cpr .
a turned - off patient triggering or a pressure - triggering of 20 cmh2o is preferred for ventilation when an ordinary inpatient hospital ventilator is used during resuscitation .

introduction the goal of ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) is to provide sufficient oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide ( co2 ) to improve tissue oxygenation and acidosis .
apart from high - quality chest compressions , hyperventilation has gained increasing attention in recent years because it may negatively affect outcomes in cardiac arrest [ 1 - 3 ] .
manual ventilation with respiratory rates greater than 20 breaths / min is common during cpr from cardiac arrest [ 4 - 6 ] .
an automated transport ventilator ( atv ) was found to be as effective as a bag valve mask to deliver ventilation during cpr once the airway is secured [ 7 , 8 ] , and it is recommend by the current guidelines for prolonged resuscitation [ 9 ] .
in addition , using of atv may help to avoid uncontrolled ventilation and improve the quality of chest compressions [ 10 , 11 ] .
however , mechanical ventilation by an ordinary automated ventilator rather than an atv is quite common during resuscitation in actually clinical practice especially in inpatient hospital settings .
different from the totally time - triggered mandatory breaths of intermittent positive pressure ventilation ( ippv ) in atv , the ippv mode in most hospital - based ventilators ( such as volume controlled mode ) works with time - and patient - triggering simultaneously in order to increase the patient - ventilator synchrony [ 12 ] .
patient triggering systems such as pressure - and flow - triggering cannot be turned off in most of the commonly used modern ventilators .
except for respiratory rate ( rr ) , using other ventilatory parameters ( e.g. minute ventilation , peak pressure limit ) during advanced life support is not recommend under current guidelines [ 13 ] .
we observed in clinical practice that the changes in airway pressure and airflow induced by chest compressions during cpr may lead to abnormal inspiratory triggering and cause remarkably high ventilation rates .
the effects of different inspiratory triggering sensitivity settings of ventilators on actual ventilation during cpr was seldom reported .
additionally , we wanted to see if no triggering was of any benefit in comparison to pressure - or flow - triggering .
in this study we investigated the influence of different inspiratory triggering settings using typical hospital - based ventilators on actual ventilation , gas exchange and hemodynamics in a porcine model of cardiac arrest .
materials and methods animal preparation with approval of the ethics committee for animal experiments at peking union medical college hospital , the study was performed on a total of 18 domestic pigs ( weight , 31.1 +/ - 1.8 kg ) .
the animals were fasted overnight and premedicated with one dose of intramuscular pentobarbital sodium ( 30 mg / kg ) , diazepam ( 0.3 mg / kg ) and atropine ( 0.02 mg / kg ) .
the animals were then placed supine in a u - shaped fixing frame .
an intravenous catheter was inserted into a lateral ear vein and followed by propofol infusion ( 2 - 3 mg / kg / hr ) to maintain anesthesia .
each pig was intubated with a size 6.5 endotracheal tube and then mechanically ventilated with room air , using volume - control mode ( hamilton - g5 , hamilton medical ag ; bonaduz , switzerland ) , with a tidal volume of 10 ml / kg and a rr adjusted to maintain partial pressure of end - tidal carbon dioxide ( petco2 ) at 35 ~ 40 mmhg and pulse oxygen saturation > 95 % .
arterial blood gases ( gem 3000 ; instrumentation laboratory , bedford , ma ) were analyzed to verify the baseline conditions .
a warming blanket was used to maintain the animal 's temperature between 36 - 38degreesc .
the right internal jugular vein and left common carotid artery were surgically exposed and cannulated for right atrial pressure ( rap ) and central aortic blood pressure ( aop ) measurements , as well as blood sampling .
the left external jugular vein was also fitted with a catheter which provided access for ventricular fibrillation induction .
normal saline solution at 5ml / kg / hr was infused prior to the induction of ventricular fibrillation to maintain rap between 3 and 5 mm hg. electrocardiograms , aop and rap were continuously monitored and recorded by a t8 mindray monitor ( mindray biological medical electronic co , ltd , shenzhen , china ) .
coronary perfusion pressure ( cpp ) was calculated as the gradient between aop and rap during the decompression phase of chest compressions .
rr , minute ventilation volume and airway pressure were continuously recorded by a biopac mp - 150 system via a piezometric tube and a flow sensor linked to the endotracheal tube .
experimental protocol ventricular fibrillation was induced by 24v / 50hz ac current with a right ventricular internal - pacing electrode .
after 3 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation without any ventilation , continuous chest compressions via a mechanical cpr device ( wish - sl - fs - a , wuhan , china ) were started at a rate of 100 compressions / min and a depth of 30 % of the anteroposterior chest diameter .
mechanical ventilation ( hamilton - g5 ) was performed simultaneously for three periods of 5 minutes each , using a volume - controlled mode with a constant flow of 30l / min , zero end - expiratory pressure , fio2 1.0 , rr 10 / min , tidal volume of 10 ml / kg , i : e 1:2 , and the upper airway pressure limit was set to 60 cmh2o ( fig 1 ) .
according to the different inspiratory triggering sensitivity settings , the animals were divided into three groups .
in the first group of six pigs ( group trig - 4 ) , three periods ( 5 minutes each ) of mechanical ventilation were characterized by a pressure - triggering sensitivity of 4 cmh2o , a flow - triggering sensitivity of 4 l / min , and turned - off triggering respectively .
similar to group trig - 4 , six pigs in group trig - 10 were ventilated with a pressure - triggering of 10 cmh2o , a flow - triggering of 10 l / min and turned - off triggering , while six pigs in group trig - 20 were ventilated with a pressure - triggering of 20 cmh2o , a flow - triggering of 20 l / min and turned - off triggering .
six sequences in each group were generated due to random assortment of the three different triggering settings , and each animal in each group was ventilated in accordance with one of the six sequences .
arterial and central venous blood gas samples were drawn at baseline and at the endpoint of each 5 minute ventilation period .
the animals were finally sacrificed by infusion of potassium chloride at the end of the experiment .
respiratory and hemodynamic parameters at last minute of each period were collected , and the mean values were analyzed .

discussion this study investigated ventilation via a typical hospital ventilator using different inspiratory triggering settings during cpr .
compared to the turned - off patient triggering , most settings of pressure - or flow - triggering induced hyperventilation through a high rr , with the exception of pressure - triggering at 20 cmh2o .
though a higher pao2 was observed , elevated mean airway pressures and deteriorating cpp , petco2 and svo2 seen with these settings indicated adverse prognoses .
a pressure - triggering of 20 cmh2o had similar ventilation volume , gas exchange and hemodynamics as compared to turned - off triggering , and could be an alternative choice if an atv or turned - off patient triggering was not available in clinical practice .
excessive ventilation is strongly suggested to be avoided in the current guidelines , due to its adverse effects increasing intrathoracic pressure , decreasing venous return , coronary perfusion , and diminishing cardiac output and survival [ 1 , 13 ] .
avoidance of hyperventilation during cpr is a broad consensus , though clinical studies confirming the association between hyperventilation and cardiac arrest outcomes are limited .
however , hyperventilation commonly occurs during cpr with rr exceeding 10 breaths / min 63 % of the time and exceeding 20 breaths / min 20 % of the time , despite guideline recommendations [ 6 ] .
the precipitating factors of hyperventilation are usually multifactorial including an adrenaline - driven arousal response , resuscitator inexperience , and cpr delivered at off - hours [ 6 , 14 , 15 ] .
rr by manual ventilation could even reach 37 breaths / min with advanced airways , and providers often fail to ventilate at recommended rates even after retraining [ 1 , 4 , 16 ] .
the use of a mechanical ventilator during cpr can theoretically eliminate hyperventilation by totally controlling ventilation rates and tidal volumes without patient triggering .
an atv is recommended in the guidelines as one of the ventilation alternatives for prolonged resuscitation efforts to provide adequate ventilation and allow resuscitators to perform other tasks [ 9 ] , while the automatic mode of the oxygen - powered , flow - limited ventilator should not be used due to its adverse effects on venous return and forward blood flow [ 17 ] .
the mechanical properties of typical hospital - based ventilators are usually superior to transport ventilators , and these ordinary ventilators are often involved in cpr due to their availability and convenience in our clinical practice .
however , patient - triggering cannot be turned off in most modern ventilators ( e.g. puritan bennette 7200ae & 840 , maquet servo - i , drager infinity c500 , and ge engstrom carestation , among others ) .
the current guidelines do not give any specific ventilatory recommendations except for the rr with a secured airway , and , to the best of our knowledge , there are no studies focusing on different inspiratory triggering settings during cpr until now .
in general , the maximum adjustable range of pressure - or flow - triggering of most modern ventilators is 20 cmh2o or l / min .
this study demonstrated that a pressure - triggering of 20 cmh2o rather than a flow - triggering of 20 l / min could effectively control hyperventilation .
because of design characteristics , flow - triggering provides more sensitive triggering and relatively shorter time delay than pressure - triggering [ 18 , 19 ] .
it 's reasonable to surmise from our study that airway pressures are usually between - 10 and - 20 cmh2o , while airflow is more than 20 l / min in most cases during the decompression phase of chest compressions .
adverse effects of hyperventilation were verified in this fundamental research again .
high ventilation rates greater than 20 breaths / min induced high minute ventilation volume , increased mean airway pressure , and decreased cpp in this study .
however , contradictory viewpoints and research challenging the adverse effects of hyperventilation or high airway pressures during cpr have emerged in recent years [ 20 - 22 ] .
higher mean airway pressure was found to be associated with higher rosc in clinical settings [ 22 ] .
a novel ventilation mode ( chest compression synchronized ventilation , ccsv ) which increases cyclic intrathoracic pressure differences and avoids negative airway pressure shows better effects on oxygenation and hemodynamics compared to ippv [ 23 ] .
meanwhile , the need for artificial ventilation in the first minutes of cpr has also been challenged in the past several years [ 24 ] .
passive ventilation such as continuous positive airway pressure ( cpap ) with pure oxygen via a boussignac device or cpap plus pressure support ventilation , was found to an effective alternative to mechanical ventilation with similar or superior gas exchange [ 25 , 26 ] .
nevertheless , positive - pressure ventilation is still the " gold standard " of ventilation during cpr , though further investigations are needed to clarify the specific effects of ventilation volume and airway pressure on the outcomes of cpr .
as regards gas exchange in this study , high rr caused by pressure - and flow - triggering were correlated with decreased petco2 , alkalosis and better arterial oxygenation .
arterial blood gas values were often used as measurable indicators of resuscitation effects in may studies of cpr [ 27 - 29 ] .
however , paco2 and pao2 are simultaneously influenced by ventilation and pulmonary blood flow [ 30 ]. with significantly decreasing pulmonary blood flow ( increasing ventilation / perfusion ratio ) , pao2 increases and paco2 decreases , approaching the composition of inspired gas , which is opposite to conventional practice [ 30 ] .
similar to the current study , increased pao2 and decreased paco2 during low blood flow states of cpr , may indicate not only adequate or excessive ventilation but also the negative effects of deteriorating blood flow .
in general , oxygen delivery to the heart and brain is limited by blood flow rather than by arterial oxygen content during cpr [ 9 , 31 , 32 ] .
venous blood gases are thought to be more useful than arterial blood gases to assess perfusion during resuscitation , because they are less affected by ventilation changes [ 29 , 30 ] .
actually , similar values of venous blood gases analysis were observed in most groups in our study , except that controlled ventilation rates with turned - off triggering or pressure - triggering of 20 cmh2o showed better svo2 .
however , the same phenomenon was also observed in human cpr [ 33 ] .
subjects with restoration of spontaneous circulation ( rosc ) demonstrated significantly different values of venous ph , po2 , and pco2 during resuscitation , while a higher svo2 indicated high rate of rosc from cardiac arrest .
in addition to decreased cpp and svo2 , flow - triggering also correlated with increased venous - arterial co2 gradients .
low blood flow states such as during chest compressions or shock , paco2 positively correlates with blood flow while venous pco2 negatively correlates with blood flow [ 29 , 34 ] .
the increased venous - arterial co2 gradients in this study indicated decreased blood flow during cpr , and suggest again that hyperventilation due to flow - triggering deteriorates cardiac output and tissue blood flow .
our study has several limitations .
first , the sample of animals was relatively small and outcomes of resuscitation efforts such as rosc could not be detected and compared because of the cross - over design .
second , 5 minutes for each ventilation period was relatively short. that was chosen because the differences of respiratory parameters , gas exchange and hemodynamics between different triggering settings were significant after a ventilation duration of 5 minutes , and prolonged cpr would induce rapid deterioration of artificial circulation .
finally , an atv was not involved in our study to serve as a point of comparison with our hospital - based ventilators .
when the triggering of a ventilator is turned off , its ventilation process is basically identical to that of an atv .
furthermore , the purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using different inspiratory triggering settings in an ordinary ventilator during cpr .
in conclusion , for ordinary automated ventilators found in inpatient hospital settings , pressure - triggering of 4 or 10 cmh2o and flow - triggering are improper for ventilation during cpr , due to their induction of hyperventilation leading to the deterioration in gas exchange and hemodynamics .
turned - off patient triggering is preferred , and a pressure - triggering of 20 cmh2o could be a viable alternative if turned - off triggering is not available .

this study aims to evaluate thyroid solid nodules , to establish the accuracy of us - e in providing information on the nature of these nodules , and to assess the clinical value of elasticity scores ( es ) and strain ratio ( sr ) in differentiating thyroid solid nodules and to explore its distribution characteristics using pathological analysis as reference .
methods traditional ultrasonography and us - e were performed on 131 thyroid solid nodules ( 99 benign ones and 32 malignant ones ) in 120 patients ( 78 females and 41 males ) .
three radiologists evaluated the nodules based on a four - degree elasticity scoring system .
the nodules were classified according to the es as soft ( es 1 - 2 ) or hard ( es 3 - 4 ) .
the sr was calculated online .
results the sensitivity and specificity of the es for thyroid cancer diagnosis were 78 % and 80 % , respectively .
sr values >= 2.9 used as a standard to distinguish benign from malignant nodules had a sensitivity of 87 % and a specificity of 92 % .
the sr of the benign lesions was 1.64 +/ - 1.37 , which was significantly different from that of malignant lesions , which was 4.96 +/ - 2.13 ( p < 0.01 ) .
conclusions both the es and sr were higher in malignant nodules than those in benign ones .
real - time us - e was a useful index in the differential diagnosis of thyroid solid nodules .
it can provide quantitative information on thyroid nodule characterization and improve diagnostic confidence .
key words : ultrasound elastography elasticity scores strain ratio thyroid solid nodule introduction the nodular thyroid disease affects the general population , particularly among iodine - deficient individuals .
thyroid nodules are observed in 5 % of the subjects [ 1 , 2 ] , but are detected in about 50 % of the general population via thyroid ultrasound [ 3 - 5 ] .
the basic principle of ultrasound elastography ( us - e ) is that the compression of the examined tissue produces a strain , which is smaller in hard tissues than in soft tissues .
the results of this technique are scored by measuring the degree of distortion of the ultrasound beam while an external force is applied [ 6 ] .
malignant lesions are often characterized by greater stiffness than in normal tissues [ 7 ] .
the aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical value of the elasticity score via us - e in the differential diagnosis of thyroid solid nodules .
patients and methods patients this study was approved by the tianjin medical university cancer institute and hospital .
a total of 131 nodules in 120 patients ( 78 females ; mean age , 44.31 years ; range , 18 to 70 years ; and 41 males ; mean age , 49.92 years ; range , 24 to 69 years ) were selected from january to november 2011 .
the inclusion criterion was the presence of solid lesions in one thyroid lobe .
the mean size of the nodules was 1.91 cm ( within a range of 0.87 to 3.32 cm ) .
surgical results were used as the reference standards .
imaging acquisition the patients were in a supine position with the neck slightly extended .
a considerable amount of ultrasound gel was applied to the patients' neck as a standoff pad .
both conventional sonography and real - time us - e were performed using a philips iu22 system equipped with a liner probe with a central frequency of 5 mhz to 12 mhz .
all examinations were conducted and recorded by three experienced sonographers .
two of these sonographers had more than eight years of experience in sonography and about two months of special training in elastography .
based on the preliminary experiments , the probe should slightly come into contact with the skin because a strong initial compression may increase the probability of false negatives .
a region of interest ( roi ) was centered on the lesion , including sufficient surrounding thyroid tissue .
the great cervical vessels were avoided as much as possible .
elastogram review evaluation based on elasticity scores each nodule was assigned an elasticity score based on the pattern type according to the classification proposed by fukunari [ 8 ] .
pattern 1 ( score 1 ) : most of the nodule is displayed in green .
pattern 2 ( score 2 ) : the center of the nodule is displayed in green and its peripheral part in blue .
pattern 3 ( score 3 ) : the nodule is displayed as a mixture of red , green , and blue .
pattern 4 ( score 4 ) : the entire nodule is displayed in blue ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
figure 1 a nodular goiter with a mean elasticity score of 1 in a 41 - year - old woman .
the average strain ratio was 1.20 .
figure 2 a papillary carcinoma ( follicular variant ) with elasticity score of 4 in a 56 - year - old woman .
the average strain ratio of the nodule was 5.23 .
evaluation based on strain ratio the sonographers performed this evaluation during the examination using a software that was connected to the machine .
the best - fit 2d sonogram - elastogram image pairs were selected , and strain ratio ( sr ) was evaluated .
the operators were first asked to trace area a manually along the borderline of the lesion .
area b was then selected just beside the target lesion as reference .
the homogeneous thyroid tissue at the same depth was chosen because the strain varies as a function of depth .
the lesions were used as the reference tissue .
the software could automatically calculate for the sr. each lesion was assessed at least three times based on different static images , and the average value was recorded as the final result .
the radiologists performed the examination and evaluation for about 5 to 8 min per patient .
results pathologic findings all 131 nodules with a final postoperative histological diagnosis were studied .
among the 32 malignant nodules , 27 were papillary thyroid carcinomas ( 13 classic variant cases , 7 follicular variant cases , 3 tall cell variant cases , and 2 trabecular variant cases ) , 3 were follicular carcinomas , 1 was adenoma with foci ( 3 mm ) of papillary carcinoma , and 1 was an undifferentiated carcinoma .
the remaining 99 nodules were benign based on histological results. of these , 77 were nodular goiters and 22 were adenomas .
us elastography elasticity scores of 131 thyroid nodules eighty - nine of the 131 nodules had scores of 1 or 2 , and 82 of these nodules were diagnosed as benign .
forty - two of the 131 nodules had a score of 3 or 4 , and 25 of these nodules were diagnosed as malignant .
thus , scores 3 and 4 were indicative of malignancy , with a sensitivity of 78 % and a specificity of 80 % ( table 1 ) .
all nodules without calcification and had an elasticity score of 1 or 2 were considered benign ( figure 1 ) .

the average strain ratio of the nodule was 4.98 .
distribution of elastography patterns and sr of the nodules the elastography patterns and sr of different pathological nodules were different ( tables 1 and 2 ) .
the mean sr for the benign nodules and malignant ones was significantly different ( 1.64 +/ - 1.37 vs. 4.96 +/ - 2.13 , p < 0.001 ) .
in terms of pathological type , the sr was 1.53 +/ - 1.23 for nodular goiters , 1.76 +/ - 1.25 for thyroid adenomas , 5.02 +/ - 2.07 for papillary carcinomas , 4.95 +/ - 2.12 for follicular carcinomas , and 6.54 +/ - 0.55 for undifferentiated carcinomas .
discussion real - time us - e is a newly developed diagnostic tool that evaluates the degree of distortion of ultrasound beam while an external force is applied .
it is based on the principle that the softer parts of the tissues deform more easily than the harder parts under compression .
thus , a semi - quantitative determination of tissue elasticity is observed [ 9 ] .
thus far , elastography has been evaluated in two ways , namely , based on the elasticity score and on the strain ratio .
malignant thyroid nodules such as papillary thyroid carcinoma , which is the most common histotype , displayed lower elasticity compared with benign lesions [ 10 - 14 ] .
the elasticity score evaluation was based on the color distribution , which was superimposed on the b - mode image .
previous reports found this method to be efficient [ 15,16 ] .
however , information about the stiffness of the target mass is limited .
in the present study , the benign and malignant lesions of the elasticity score had a greater extent of overlap , and the sensitivity and specificity were lower .
on the contrary , the sr is a quantitative index that can provide accurate information .
in 2007 , koji waki and takeshi matsumura conducted a research using a quantitative phantom and an automatic compressor [ 17 ] .
their findings demonstrated that regardless of stress , the strain ratio showed constant properties , and the value continued to increase with the elasticity ratio .
however , the selection of the reference tissue might affect the results .
zhi et al. [ 18 ] recommended the breast tissue at the same depth with the lesions to be used as the reference .
rago et al. [ 15 ] indicated that the predictability of elastography was independent of the nodular size and position .
in the present study , the thyroid tissue in the same depth was chosen , and the target nodule was used as the reference .
the results revealed that both the score and the sr were repeatable and reliable .
the longitudinal view of the thyroid was recommended because it could provide enough reference tissues at the same depth with the lesions .
the distribution of the sr confirmed that the benign nodules were much softer than the malignant ones .
in this study , most of the papillary carcinomas were imaged as blue in the elastograms .
the value of the sr was also quite high .
compared with papillary carcinoma , follicular and medullary thyroid carcinoma had less fiber content and more cellular components .
papillary carcinoma is often accompanied by the formation of sand , which makes the collection of pathologic specimens of papillary carcinoma relatively hard [ 19 ] .
both the es and sr were higher in malignant nodules than those in benign ones .
this result indicated that both the es and sr are useful indexes in the differential diagnosis of solid thyroid nodules .
this method can provide quantitative information on thyroid nodule characterization and improve diagnostic confidence .
real - time us - e is influenced by the volume , topography , and number of thyroid nodules .
for nodules with diameters larger than 3 cm , elastography might not be performed with the external compression of the whole nodule [ 20 ] .
no information about the lower diameter of the thyroid nodules that can be evaluated by real - time us - e is available as of this writing .
the approach could only perform a limited evaluation of multi - nodular goiters because the nodules must be clearly distinguishable from one another .
the accuracy of real - time us - e might also be altered if the nodules are close to the carotid artery because arterial pulsation may create elastographic images , which affects the ability to acquire adequate data and to interpret them accurately [ 20 ] .
in the present study , many nodules were selected based on suspicious features of malignancy .
thus , the prevalence of the disease within the entire category of nodules with non - diagnostic histology was overestimated .
upon further investigation , the implications of the findings in the present study on the clinical management of indeterminate or non - diagnostic lesions are likely to be relevant because us - e might restrict the indications of surgical therapy to the subgroup of patients with a higher risk of thyroid cancer .
the low number of false negative results using us - e together with the low progression rate of differentiated thyroid cancer might allow most patients to be recommended for follow - up sessions without significant costs in terms of prognosis .
us - e could also be helpful in defining the extent of thyroid ectomy ( total or lobectomy ) for these lesions .
subtype of thyroid carcinoma : in the meta - analysis of bojunga et al .
[ 21 ] , false negative results were obtained in 10 / 135 ( 7 %) of the papillary carcinomas and 4 / 9 ( 44 %) of follicular carcinomas .
correctly diagnosing this subtype of carcinoma might be difficult even at the histopathology level .
their gross anatomy and cellular patterns overlap with those of benign nodules .
the sonographic differences between follicular adenomas and carcinomas have not been fully established [ 22 ] .
in a retrospective study , seo et al .
[ 23 ] reported that iso - hypoechogenicity and microcalcifications or rim calcifications were more common in follicular carcinomas than in follicular adenomas .
however , in one prospective study , the sensitivity of the ultrasound characteristics was 86.5 % for non - follicular neoplasm and 18.2 % for follicular carcinomas [ 24 ] .
in the present study , the mean sr for follicular carcinomas was 4.95 +/ - 2.12 .
compared with other types of cancer , this value is not very different , and indicates that the sr could be helpful in the diagnosis of follicular carcinoma .
further studies involving more cases of follicular adenomas and carcinomas are needed to investigate the role of elastography in their evaluation .
in the present study , the elasticity strain ratio of one case of undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma was much higher than the other types of thyroid carcinoma , suggesting that it is the hardest among all pathological types .
in conclusion , real - time us - e is proposed as an important tool in the pre - surgical risk stratification of thyroid cancer in nodules with indeterminate or non - diagnostic cytology , high elasticity , which is highly associated with benign histology , and low elasticity , which is highly associated with malignant histology .
no potential conflicts of interest are disclosed .

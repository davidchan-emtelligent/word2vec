clinical - grade ex vivo expansion of corneal endothelial cells can increase the availability of corneal tissues for transplantation and treatment of corneal blindness .
however , these cells have very limited proliferative capacity .
successful propagation has required so far to use very complex growth media supplemented with fetal bovine serum and other xenocomponents .
we hypothesized that human platelet releasates rich in multiple growth factors , and in particular neurotrophins , could potentially be a useful supplement for ex vivo expansion of corneal endothelium cells due to their neural crest origin .
platelet releasates were prepared by calcium salt activation of apheresis platelet concentrates , subjected or not to complement inactivation by heat treatment at 56degreesc for 30 minutes .
platelet releasates were characterized for their content in proteins and were found to contain high amount of growth factors including platelet - derived growth factor - ab ( 30.56 to 39.08 ng / ml ) and brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( 30.57 to 37.11 ng / ml ) neurotrophins .
we compared the growth and viability of corneal endothelium cells in dmem - f12 medium supplemented with different combinations of components , including 2.5 %~ 10 % of the platelet releasates .
corneal endothelium cells expanded in platelet releasates exhibited good adhesion and a typical hexagonal morphology .
their growth and viability were enhanced when using the complement - inactivated platelet releasate at a concentration of 10 % .
immunostaining and western blots showed that cecs maintained the expressions of four important membrane markers : na - k atpase alpha1 , zona occludens - 1 , phospho - connexin 43 and n - cadherin .
in conclusion , our study provides the first proof - of - concept that human platelet releasates can be used for ex vivo expansion of corneal endothelium cells .
these findings open a new paradigm for ex vivo propagation protocols of corneal endothelium cells in compliance with good tissue culture practices and regulatory recommendations to limit the use of xenogenic materials .

introduction the corneal endothelium , an essential part of the cornea , is composed of a unique thin , fragile monolayer of hexagonal cells that dwell in the innermost layer of the cornea .
corneal endothelial cells ( cecs ) are embryologically derived from the neural crest .
they cover the posterior surface of descemet 's membrane and make contact with the aqueous humor [ 1 ] .
cecs constitute a physiological and tight intercellular barrier that pumps fluids across the cornea , regulating hydration of the corneal stroma [ 2 ] , and contributes to maintaining transparency and clarity for optimal visual functions [ 1 ] , [ 3 ] - [ 6 ] .
damage , injury , and pathologies , like intraocular surgery and fuchs dystrophy , cause cecs to crumble , lead to excessive hydration and opacification of the cornea , and result in severe visual impairment .
repairing cecs is very challenging since these cells exhibit a very limited proliferative capacity [ 3 ] .
corneal transplantation , which is needed by an increasing number of blind patients worldwide due to aging populations , is the only current option for visual restoration with corneal blindness [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
the critical shortage of adequate tissue quality limits the availability of donor corneas [ 9 ] , supporting the development of ex vivo cec expansion to improve the supply for clinical - grade transplantation .
cecs have long been thought to be unable to expand ex vivo .
however , expansion of cecs was achieved using complex culture medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) , purified xenogenic proteins , bovine insulin , recombinant growth factors [ such as epithelial growth factor ( egf ) and platelet - derived growth factor ( pdgf ) - bb ] , pituitary extracts , and others compounds like cholera toxin [ 4 ] , [ 10 ] - [ 15 ] .
nevertheless , such materials have drawbacks , including , for instance the case of components of bovine origin , exposing recipients to immunological [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , viral [ 18 ] , and / or prion [ 19 ] risks .
as such , they are discouraged or prohibited by regulatory authorities and the world health organization [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
in addition , many recombinant growth factor supplements are either only of reagent - grade quality , not licensed for this specific application , or very expensive .
alternative xeno - free supplements for cec expansion therefore need to be identified .
considering the neural crest origin of the cecs , we hypothesized that human platelet releasates , which contain a complex mixture of growth factors , including pdgf , vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , and brain - derived growth factor ( bdnf ) neurotrophins [ 22 ] , could potentially be used as a sole supplement of basal growth medium for ex vivo expansion of cecs .
to our knowledge , this is the first study reporting the use of human platelet releasates as a growth medium supplement to isolate and expand primary cecs .
materials and methods collection of platelet concentrates platelet concentrates were prepared using a haemonetics mcs + apheresis machine ( haemonetics corp. , braintree , ma , usa ) from 4 volunteer donors who provided written informed consent , with approval by the institutional review board of taipei medical university : ndegrees 201210007 .
platelet concentrates ( about 280 ml each ) were stored at room temperature under mild mixing on a platelet agitator at 22 +/ - 2degreesc for 1 ~ 3 days after collection , and were individually processed as described below and summarized in fig. 1. the platelet concentrate ( 1 ml ) was taken aseptically under laminar flow to determine the blood cell count and hemoglobin , as in our previous research , using a cell counter ( abc vet automatic blood counter , abx diagnostics , montpellier , france ) [ 23 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0099145.g001 figure 1 preparation of platelet materials .
platelet releasate ( pr ) and heat - treated pr ( hpr ) were obtained by 23 mm calcium chloride activation for 10 ~ 15 min at 20 ~ 22degreesc in the presence of glass beads .
the fibrin - free supernatant was clarified at 6000xg for 30 min at 20degreesc .
half of the releasate ( pr ) was aliquoted and frozen at < - 20degreesc until being used .
hpr was complement - inactivated at 56degreesc for 30 min and frozen at < - 20degreesc .
preparation of platelet releasate ( pr ) the preparation procedure is summarized in fig. 1. briefly , platelet concentrates were aseptically taken from the collection bag and individually transferred to falcon tubes ( becton dickinson biosciences , franklin lakes , nj , usa ) containing glass beads that were previously sterilized by autoclaving , as we described before [ 24 ] .
sterile cacl2 ( 1 m ) was added under laminar flow to the platelet concentrate to a final concentration of 23 mm and mixed gently for 10 ~ 15 min at 20 ~ 22degreesc to activate the platelets and blood coagulation and convert the plasma fibrinogen into fibrin .
the fibrin clot was removed by adhesion to the glass beads through vigorous shaking [ 24 ] .
the fibrin - free supernatant was centrifuged at 6000xg for 30 min at 20degreesc to clarify and recover the fibrin - free supernatant .
half of the releasate ( termed the pr ) was aliquoted and frozen at < - 20degreesc until being used .
the other half ( termed the hpr ) was complement - inactivated at 56degreesc for 30 min in a temperature - controlled water - bath and subsequently aliquoted and frozen at < - 20degreesc .
the absence of residual blood cells in the pr and hpr was controlled before freezing by counting as indicated above .
a sample of the starting pc was kept , centrifuged at 2500xg at room temperature to pelletize the platelet and obtain platelet - poor - plasma ( ppp ) that was used as a control for determining the growth factors .
growth factor determination and protein profile the pr and hpr samples were thawed at 37degreesc and analyzed within 1 h. growth factors were determined using the respective quantikine enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) kits ( r & d systems , minneapolis , mn , usa ) following the manufacturer 's instructions , as described in our former research [ 25 ] - [ 27 ] .
standards and samples were assayed in duplicate , and mean values were calculated after taking into account the dilution factor of the samples .
sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) was performed as before [ 24 ] using gradient gels , reagents , and electrophoretic systems from invitrogen ( carlsbad , ca , usa ) .
a prestained protein molecular weight standard ( novex sharp , invitrogen ) was used to assess the molecular mass .
chemical analysis contents of protein , glucose , chloride , sodium , potassium , calcium , phosphate , magnesium , iron , the total iron capacity , ferritin , vitamin b12 , and folate of pr and hpr were determined using a roche module p800 automatic biochemical analyzer ( roche diagnostics , mannheim , germany ) as previously described [ 27 ] .
cec isolation and culture conditions over 30 fresh bovine eyes were purchased from a local butcher , a few hours after the animals were killed at a local abattoir .
the eyes were disinfected by immersion in an iodine solution for 3 ~ 5 min and then transferred into phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ; life technologies , grand island , ny , usa ) .
cecs were isolated by peeling from the corneal endothelium sheets and digested at 37degreesc in 1x tryple express ( gibco , life technologies ) for 30 min , as in our previous work [ 11 ] .
the medium used for isolation and culture was supplemented hormonal epithelial medium ( shem ) , made of an equal volume of hepes - buffered dulbecco 's modified eagle medium ( dmem ) and ham f12 ( invitrogen , life technologies ) supplemented with 5 % fbs ( gibco , life technologies ) , 5 microg / ml insulin , 5 microg / ml transferrin , 5 ng / ml selenium , 50 unit / ml penicillin , 50 microg / ml streptomycin , 250 ng / ml amphotericin b ( all from invitrogen , life technologies ) , 0.5 % dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) , 2 ng / ml recombinant human egf ( rhuegf ) , and 1 nm cholera toxin ( all from sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) .
alternatively , the basal medium was supplemented with 2.5 % , 5 % , 7.5 % , or 10 % human platelet fractions only .
after digestion , bovine cecs ( bcecs ) were seeded at a rate of approximately 104 cells / well in a 24 - well culture plate ( 2 cm2 ; becton dickinson , franklin lakes , nj , usa ) , and cultured in an incubator ( forma 310 , thermo scientific , neihu , taiwan ) at 37degreesc in an atmosphere of 95 % air and 5 % co2 .
the medium was changed every 2 ~ 3 days .
seven combinations of cell culture conditions were evaluated ( table 1 ) to determine the possibility of avoiding fbs and other xenogenic or recombinant nutritional supplements ( rh - egf , transferrin , insulin , and cholera toxin ) , dmso , and cholera toxin .
conditions with and without a heparin anticoagulant were also tested to prevent the risk of fibrin gel formation affecting cell cultures .

morphology , cell count , and cell viability assay the morphology of cells was observed under a phase - contrast microscope ( ix71 , olympus , tokyo , japan ) at 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 days .
for counting , cecs were trypsinized at 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 days , and viable cells were counted using a countess automated cell counter ( invitrogen ) following the manufacturer 's instructions .
cell numbers were determined for triplicate wells at each time point .
cecs were seeded at a rate of approximately 104 cells / well into a 96 - well plate ( becton dickinson ) and cultured in different media for 24 h until they reached confluence .
the medium was removed and replaced with 100 microl of fresh culture medium .
mtt ( 10 microl of a 12 mm stock solution ; invitrogen , life technologies ) was added and incubated at 37degreesc for 4 h. the medium was removed , and 50 microl of dmso was added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals , and it was thoroughly mixed before incubation for 10 min at 37degreesc .
the absorbance at 540 nm was measured to assess cell viability .
immunocytochemistry cells were seeded in 24 - well plates and grown to confluence which typically required 3 ~ 5 days .
cells were carefully washed with pbs and fixed in fresh 4 % paraformaldehyde ( pfa )/ pbs at ph 7.4 for 10 ~ 20 min at room temperature .
after washing twice with pbs , pfa - fixed cells were permeabilized for 5 min in 0.2 % triton x - 100 ( sigma - aldrich ) in pbs .
fixed cells were blocked in 10 % bsa in pbs for 1 h at room temperature .
as in our previous experiments [ 12 ] , primary antibodies , including rabbit anti - na - k atpase alpha1 ( 1:100 dilution ; merck millipore , billerica , ma , usa ) , rabbit anti - zona occludens - 1 ( zo - 1 ; 1:100 ; invitrogen , life technologies ) , phospho - connexin 43 ( 1:100 ; merck millipore ) , and n - cadherin ( 1:100 ; becton dickinson ) , were incubated overnight at 4degreesc .
cells were washed twice with pbs and then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of fitc - labeled secondary antibodies ( ebioscience , san diego , ca , usa ) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature .
after washing three times in pbs , all cells were stained with the dapi nuclear marker ( 1:5000 ; invitrogen , life technologies ) for 20 min at room temperature .
a fluorescent mounting solution was added , the fluorescence was visualized on a nikon eclipse e - 800 fluorescence microscope ( tokyo , japan ) , and images were obtained with a spot digital camera .
western blot analysis a western blot analysis was performed on cecs cultured in medium supplemented with fbs or hpr until they had reached confluence .
in brief , cells lysis was performed using ripa ( sigma ) for 10 min on ice .
proteins from cell extracts were separated by sds - page using 4 %~ 12 % bis - tris protein gel ( invitrogen ) , transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes , and blocked with a blocking solution .
the primary antibodies described above were used followed by appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase .
statistical analysis data are reported as the mean +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) .
statistical analyses of cell counts and mtt were performed using student 's t - test .
a p value of < 0.05 was considered a significant difference .
results cell counts of starting platelet concentrates the mean platelet , white blood cell , and red blood cell counts in starting platelet concentrates were 1250 +/ - 167.3x106 / ml , 0.85 +/ - 0.078x106 / ml , and 0.03 +/ - 0.009x109 / ml , respectively , typical of this apheresis platelet collection procedure .

there was no detectable blood cells in the pr or hpr .
sds - page , growth factors , and cytokines in prs the sds - page protein profile of fbs , pr , and hpr ( fig. 2 ) showed that all three materials contained albumin ( 58 kda ) but had no detectable fibrinogen ( 260 kda ) .
immunoglobulin g ( igg ; 160 kda ) was present in the pr and hpr but was undetectable in fbs .
the pr and hpr had protein profiles typical of human serum .
the content of platelet growth factors ( table 2 ) was significantly higher ( p < 0.001 ) in the pr and hpr compared to ppp , apart from the hepatocyte growth factor ( hgf ) .
results of the chemical analysis ( table 3 ) did not reveal much difference between the pr and hpr apart from less vitamin b12 in the hpr .
the most important differences were more glucose , calcium , tibc , uibc , and ferritin , and less potassium , phosphate , iron and folate in platelet releasates compared to fbs .

cec growth , viability , and morphology in 5 % prs the possibility of expanding cecs in basal medium supplemented with seven different combinations of supplements ( as described in table 1 ) containing either 5 % fbs or 5 % prs as the main protein nutrient source was evaluated in 24 - well plates .
growth medium was changed on days 0 , 2 , and 4 .
cells took 5 days to reach confluence when grown in complete shem .
cell counts at d1 , d3 , and d5 are shown in fig. 3. cecs could expand in all conditions , but significantly higher ( p < 0.05 ) cell growth was observed in complete medium supplemented with 5 % fbs and other supplements compared to 5 % pr or hpr only .
mtt data on d5 confirmed that cecs exhibited good viability in the pr and hpr ( data not shown ) .
no growth medium gelation was observed in the absence of heparin , indicating that its addition was not necessary .
there was no significant difference when cells were grown in pr or hpr with or without dmso .
therefore no heparin or dmso was used in further experiments .
optical microscopy revealed that cecs in the presence of 5 % fbs , pr , or hpr grew as a monolayer with a typical hexagonal structure .
however , cecs grown in basal medium supplemented with 5 % hpr exhibited a more - regular shape and more - hexagonal structure than when grown with 5 % pr ( fig. 4 ) .
hpr supplementation was therefore used in further experiments .

discussion procedures for ex vivo clinical - grade expansion of cecs need to be developed to increase the supply of corneal tissues for transplants .
however , the low proliferative capacity of cecs makes ex vivo expansion a challenging task .
so far , successful expansion of cecs has required supplementation of growth media with complex mixtures of fbs , various other xenogenic compounds , and recombinant growth factors that are incompatible with clinical use [ 12 ] .
alternative xeno - free supplements are needed to meet requirements for clinical applications of cecs for transplantation .
our goal here was to explore the possibility of using human prs as the sole supplement for expanding cecs .
based on our previous experience [ 24 ] , we selected a pr obtained by calcium chloride activation rather than a lysate obtained by freeze - thaw cycles [ 28 ] .
indeed , this allowed us to ( a ) preserve the numerous protein nutrients , such as albumin ( an important carrier for lipids , vitamins and hormones ) transferrin or haptoglobin , present in plasma [ 27 ] and ( b ) remove undesirable proteins like fibrinogen that is prone to conversion into insoluble fibrin which impairs cell growth [ 29 ] .
fibrinogen removal by cacl2 activation of the platelet concentrate further avoided the need for heparin which has the drawback of being of porcine origin and potentially impairs cell proliferation , at concentrations of > 0.6 iu / ml [ 30 ]. from previous research , we knew that 23 mm cacl2 , by inducing endogenous thrombin formation , triggers platelet activation and growth factor release into the releasate [ 24 ] .
our work first identified that 5 % pr could be used to expand cecs , even though cell growth was significantly less than when using full shem .
we then observed that cecs expanded in a pr subjected to heat - treatment exhibited more - typical hexagonal morphology and good transparency .
we suspect that the favorable effect of the heat - treatment was due to inactivation of the plasma complement .
recently , another hpr , developed for treating dry - eye syndrome , increased the proliferation and migration potential of ocular surface cells better than a non - heat - treated equivalent [ 31 ] .
escalating dose experiments established that significantly improved cell growth and viability were obtained by increasing hpr supplementation to 10 % .
in this situation , cecs still maintained a typical hexagonal shape .
cecs did not undergo fibroblastic transformation [ 14 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] because when this phenomenon happens cecs lose their functions , which was not the case here .
we verified that expressions of important cell membrane markers , in particular zo - 1 and na - k atpase , were seen at confluence when cecs were isolated and expanded in serum - free , xeno - free medium supplemented with the hpr .
the activity of na - k atpase is important for the proper activity of the fluid pump and for controlling the transparency of the cornea [ 34 ] , while zo - 1 ensures the tightness of cell junctions [ 35 ] .
therefore , our results demonstrated that cec isolation and ex vivo expansion in xeno - free medium supplemented with 10 % heat - treated human pr was achievable under conditions that maintain cell transparency , the hexagonal morphology , and important membrane marker expressions .
the fact that platelet materials can be used as a sole supplement to expand cecs ex vivo is very intriguing .
prs were already proven to be excellent for ex vivo expansion of human primary cells [ 27 ] including adipose - derived stem cells [ 36 ] , and they have great potential in regenerative medicine and cell therapy [ 22 ] , [ 37 ] .
prs provide plasma proteins and nutrients , such as sodium , potassium , magnesium , iron , and glucose .
most importantly , we showed that they contain a unique physiological mix of natural growth factors that may be crucial for cec expansion .
studies showed the role of growth factors in the regeneration and transparency of the cornea [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] .
when initiating our work , we hypothesized that considering the neural crest origin of pdgf , bdnf , and vegf neurotrophins , that are essential for brain tissues and neuronal survival , these cells may stimulate cec growth ex vivo [ 2 ] , [ 14 ] .
growth factors are known to exert important physiological roles in maintenance of the cornea [ 39 ] .
pdgf - ab is present at approximately 35 ng / ml in pr. pdgf - bb promotes rat cec growth and viability [ 40 ] , whereas natural pdgf ( a mixture of the aa , ab , and bb isomers ) , at 15 ~ 62 ng / ml , significantly enhanced cec growth and would healing in vitro [ 41 ] .
bdnf , at around 35 ng / ml , may also be a key factor in cec expansion .
it is present in its mature 13 - kda form in prs [ 26 ] , [ 42 ] - [ 44 ] .
the tropomyosin - related kinase b ( trkb ) receptor , which mediates bdnf activity , is expressed in human and rabbit corneal epithelium and stroma [ 39 ] , but to our knowledge , has not yet been identified in cecs .
bdnf influences the development of the eye , and at 200 ng / ml , enhances the proliferation of cecs [ 39 ] .
its role in supporting cec expansion and morphology is consistent with supplementation of growth medium with 20 ng / ml of nerve growth factor [ 15 ] , [ 45 ] , a neurotrophin close to bdnf [ 46 ] , and by 100 microg / ml of pituitary extract , which contains bdnf [ 47 ] , to support the proliferative capacity of human cecs .
vegf is present in the platelet releasates at 0.2 ~ 0.3 ng / ml. it is also used as a supplement of cec growth medium [ 13 ] , [ 48 ] .
the roles of the other platelet growth factors cannot be excluded .
for instance , egf , which was present at approximately 0.45 ng / ml in our prs is commonly used at 2 ~ 5 ng / ml to supplement cec expansion media [ 12 ] - [ 14 ] , [ 49 ] , but 0.01 ng / ml was found sufficient to promote the growth of rabbit cecs [ 15 ] .
egf receptors are expressed by cecs [ 50 ] .
egf promotes the proliferation of human cecs in vitro [ 49 ] and in vivo , improves eye tissue hydration by stimulating fluid transport in the corneal endothelium [ 51 ] .
b - fgf , which promotes mitosis of cecs , is sometimes used , at 2 ~ 10 ng / ml , in cec expansion media [ 48 ] , [ 52 ] , [ 53 ] .
it was present in our prs only at 0.1 ~ 0.5 ng / ml , a dose which might be sufficient to enhance cec growth when combined with the other platelet growth factors .
the role of tgf - beta may be more ambiguous as it may at certain concentrations alter cec expansion and induce formation of myofibroblasts and corneal scarring [ 38 ] , [ 54 ] and lead to endothelial - mesenchymal transition [ 33 ] .
conversely , tgf - beta exerts an anti - inflammatory role in ocular disorders and infections [ 15 ] .
testing a platelet lysate depleted in tgf - beta through adsorption on an anion - exchanger [ 55 ] may be of interest .
hgf , which was present at about 0.3 ng / ml in our prs , is known to stimulate proliferation of cecs in a dose - responsive manner , consistent with the presence of the hgf receptor on the cell surface ( met ) [ 56 ] , [ 57 ] .
bovine insulin and insulin - like growth factor ( igf ) - 1 are also used to supplement cec culture media [ 48 ] , [ 53 ] , [ 58 ] .
although we did not measure igf - 1 , which is structurally homologous to insulin [ 59 ] , in the pr or hpr , our previous studies demonstrated that it is present in the plasma compartment of prs at approximately 50 ~ 70 ng / ml [ 24 ] , so we believe that it was present at similar concentrations in the pr and hpr .
therefore , the natural mix of growth factors present in platelet releasates may be a key element for the isolation and expansion of cecs .
conclusions this work establishes for the first time a proof of concept that human pr rich in growth factors can be used as a supplement for serum - free , xeno - free ex vivo expansion of cecs .
these findings open attractive perspectives for clinical - grade use of cecs for transplantation in patients suffering from corneal diseases .
further work is needed to confirm these data using human cecs and develop a culture system on a suitable substrate for corneal grafting .

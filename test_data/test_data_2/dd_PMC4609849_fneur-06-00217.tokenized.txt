recent embodied approaches in cognitive sciences emphasize the constitutive roles of bodies and environment in driving cognitive processes .
cognition is thus seen as a distributed system based on the continuous interaction of bodies , brains , and environment .
these categories , moreover , do not relate only causally , through a sequential input - output network of computations ; rather , they are dynamically enfolded in each other , being mutually implemented by the concrete patterns of actions adopted by the cognitive system .
however , while this claim has been widely discussed across various disciplines , its relevance and potential beneficial applications for music therapy remain largely unexplored. with this in mind , we provide here an overview of the embodied approaches to cognition , discussing their main tenets through the lenses of music therapy .
in doing so , we question established methodological and theoretical paradigms and identify possible novel strategies for intervention .
in particular , we refer to the music - based rehabilitative protocols adopted for parkinson 's disease patients .
indeed , in this context , it has recently been observed that music therapy not only affects movement - related skills but that it also contributes to stabilizing physiological functions and improving socio - affective behaviors .
we argue that these phenomena involve previously unconsidered aspects of cognition and ( motor ) behavior , which are rooted in the action - perception cycle characterizing the whole living system .
embodiment music therapy parkinsonism dynamic systems brain plasticity motor rehabilitation well - being introduction over the last three millennia , across different times , places , and cultures , music making , and music listening have been often associated with medicine ( 1 ) , meditation ( 2 ) , and well - being ( 3 ) , serving a variety of functions deeply intermingled with everyday - life and social activities ( 4 - 9 ) .
in ancient greece , for example , human musical behaviors were not considered as contemplative or abstract practices , but were rather actively employed for education , religious ceremonies , celebrations , and , indeed , medical treatments ( 10 , 11 ) .
more systematic therapeutic interventions involving music emerged after the second world war - for example to help ex - soldiers or injured civilians recovering from stress and other related conditions ( 12 , 13 ) .
rehabilitative protocols adopted in this period were mostly based on models provided by the social sciences of the day - where the " cultural role of music was interpreted as an effective facilitator for therapeutic concepts of ' wellbeing '" [( 14 ) , p. 174 ] .
as such , the focus was on exploring how the employment of music could alleviate pain , promote emotional expression and sociality , motivate patients , and enhance self - esteem ( 15 , 16 ). from the early 2000s , with the unprecedented development of brain sciences and neuroimaging techniques , the study of music therapy shifted to a new , highly stimulating , research focus .
mirroring the same reorientation witnessed in other disciplines devoted to the study of mind,1 agency , and behavior , many scholars started to explore in greater details the neurological aspects related to musical activities in clinical and non - clinical contexts [ see altenmuller and schlaug ( 17 - 19 ) , janata and grafton ( 20 ) , and thaut ( 21 )] .
within this area , a wealth of empirical evidence has showed the high degree of functional and structural plasticity of the human brain when involved in the complex demands associated with musical activity ( 22 - 26 ) .
for example , it has been demonstrated that intense melodic intonation therapy ( 27 , 28 ) may elicit - in patients suffering from non - fluent aphasia after left frontal lobe damage - the reactivation of inhibited language - competent brain regions in the right frontal brain networks ( 29 - 34 ) .
additionally , other findings have confirmed the benefits of music - supported therapy in motor rehabilitation : first , studies with stroke patients revealed significant behavioral improvements in a variety of tasks related to fine motor skills ( 35 , 36 ) , accompanied by impressive reorganization of cortical sensorimotor networks ( 37 , 38 ) ; second , research with parkinson 's patients has shown that entrainment with a rhythmically rich auditory feedback may alleviate parkinsonian gait by " increasing the excitability of spinal motor neurons via the reticulospinal pathway , thereby reducing the amount of time required for the muscles to respond to a given motor command " [ mcintosh et al. ( 39 ) , p. 25 ; see also arias and cudeiro ( 40 )] .
increasingly , the clinical adoption of music - based paradigms seems to offer not only a valid non - pharmacological tool for intervention in diverse contexts [ including for example pain treatment , see bernatzky et al .
( 41 )] but also innovative insights into the anatomy and physiology of the brain [ e.g. , sarkamo et al. ( 42 )] .
in general , a rich variety of empirical findings have demonstrated how musical experiences may improve the lives of patients suffering from various neurological diseases [ e.g. , forsblom et al. ( 43 ) and o'kelly et al .
( 44 )] , integrating neuroscientific and musical research in novel and fascinating ways ( 45 , 46 ) .
to this already fertile ground , we would like to add insights from the recent embodied trend , which has recently emerged in cognitive science and in philosophy of mind [ e.g. , lakoff and johnson ( 47 ) , shapiro ( 48 ) , stewart et al. ( 49 ) , and varela et al. ( 50 )] .
this framework has contributed a new and important perspective on the sciences of mind and ( inter ) subjectivity , with its central thesis2 being that cognition " depends on the kinds of experiences that come from having a body with particular perceptual and motor capacities that are inseparably linked and that together form the matrix within which memory , emotion , language , and all other aspects of life are meshed " [ thelen et al. ( 51 ) , p. xx ] .
we argue that framing music - supported therapy within a paradigm inspired by this claim may offer useful new ways of interpreting results obtained in clinical settings , and in turn potentially improve specific protocols for interventions .
rehabilitative strategies for parkinson 's patients , in particular , may necessitate a more unitary , holistic , view to fully appreciate the potential of music and its relevance beyond movement recovery only .
this perspective aligns with recent non - reductionist trends in critical neuroscience ( 52 - 56 ) , which emphasize the deep continuity of mind , behavior , body , brain , environment , affectivity , perception , and action ; it thus contrasts with more traditional approaches where such elements are usually studied as discreet ( and causally related ) categories [ see colombetti ( 57 ) , kiverstein and miller ( 58 ) , and thompson ( 59 )] .
in what follows , therefore , we discuss the need to implement insights from embodied cognitive science in research on the brain 's anatomical adaptation and for music - based motor rehabilitation .
first , we introduce the embodied approach by analyzing its main tenets and its role in neuroscientific and musical contexts .
here , a brief overview of the ' 4es' perspective - which , as represented in figure 1 , defines cognition as embodied , embedded , enactive , and extended - is offered .
subsequently , we shift our focus to parkinsonism , asking whether ( and how ) established rehabilitative protocols may benefit from the adoption of such compelling perspective .
finally , we explore possible clinical applications that the ' 4es' approach may inspire , showing how these may bring forth a richer understanding of the complex network of dynamical interactions between music , environment , body , brain , movement , and well - being .
figure 1 the embodied approach in its ' 4 - es' declinations .
as well known , however , not all versions of embodiment are extended , or enacted .
also , some of the arguments used by proponents of the extended mind thesis stand in open contrast with a truly enactive characterisation of cognition , and might eventually collapse into a functionalist account ( or extended functionalism ) .
in this paper , then , we just employ the basic points provided above and do not engage in relevant discussion .
varieties of embodiments the traditional ' cognitivist ' approaches that dominated cognitive sciences for more than 50 years developed a productive research agenda that focuses principally on the role of mental representations , computations , and specialized cognitive architectures ( 60 - 62 ) .
however , analyzing how external information is acquired , processed , and represented3 ' in the head ' scholars within this framework are often accused to not adequately take into consideration the body and the ecological niche in which the cognitive system is embedded ( 50 , 63 - 65 ) .
classic cognitivism , it is argued , downplays the active and adaptive engagements that unite living bodies and niche for the constitution of lived experience ; and thus , in human terms , it ignores the most fundamental aspects of our being - in - the - world ( 66 - 68 ) .
accordingly , the cognitivist framework may be seen to support a strong dichotomy between the inner domain of mind - functionally realized ' in the head ' thanks to relevant domain - specific cognitive modules - and the outer realm of the ( social and physical ) ' objective ' world , including the system 's own body ( 59 , 69 ) .
in contrast to this ' orthodox ' ( 70 ) perspective , various theories of embodied cognition have recently emerged as new frameworks for the study of human mind .
such approaches are supported by a growing cross - disciplinary research agenda that integrates relevant contributions in theoretical biology ( 71 ) , dynamic systems theory ( 72 ) , linguistics ( 73 ) , neurophysiology ( 74 ) , phenomenological philosophy ( 75 ) , cognitive science ( 59 ) , and artificial intelligence ( 76 ) .
in general , these embodied frameworks emphasize the formative roles of bodies and environments in driving cognitive processes ( 59 , 77 - 79 ) , as well as the primacy of action over more ' intellectual ' faculties to make sense of the world ( 50 , 80 , 81 ) .
as a consequence , cognition is now often described in terms of dynamic sensorimotor interactions between the entire body of a living system and its environment ( 49 , 82 ) .
while such core insights are widely endorsed by advocates of the embodied approach , its richly interdisciplinary agenda has resulted in a number of interesting formulations and interpretations ( 83 ) .
this growing variety of approaches to ' embodied cognition ' has stimulated the discussion across diverse fields - promoting a highly fruitful exchange of knowledge , methodologies , and insights , while nevertheless preventing the development of a ' standard ' framework .
in talking about the embodied approach , therefore , we actually refer to different research programs : embodiment , embedment , enactivism , and externalism ( usually labeled as ' 4es ') , which all aim to capture how bodies , brains , and environment successfully interact in real - time worldly conditions ( 84 ) .
these approaches hold that to understand mind we should consider how a living system acts in a social and physical environment ( 85 ) rather than focusing on what goes on ' within the skull ' only .
in order to get a very basic idea of the ' 4es' perspective , we introduce the following key points : cognition does not depend solely on brain processes , but results from structures widely distributed across the whole body of a living system ( the mind is embodied ) .
cognition arises from interactions with the ( social and physical ) environment ; it is actively immersed in the world ( the mind is embedded ) .
cognition can reach beyond the boundaries of skull and skin , integrating resources internal and external to the animal ( the mind is extended ) .
cognition consists of embedded and embodied forms of interactions between a self - organized living system and its environment. through this dynamic interplay , the creature enacts ( or brings forth ) , its own domain of meaning ( the mind is enacted ) .
it is beyond the scope of this article to discuss each of the ' 4es' approaches in detail ; thus we will draw from them selectively - adopting both overlapping principles and distinctive insights ( in particular from the enactive view ) when necessary .
while the debate over these perspectives is still heated in philosophy of mind and cognitive science , the embodied paradigm ( in its four ' e ' instantiations ) has received little discussion in the context of music - based rehabilitative paradigms .
but before we focus on how specific therapeutic settings may integrate existing methodological and theoretical models with insights from the embodied perspectives ( mainly with regard to parkinson 's treatment ) , it will be necessary to consider three basic principles associated with embodied cognition and analyze their role in neuroscience ( 86 - 88 ) and music cognition ( 89 - 94 ) .
tracking down embodiment although the ' 4es' define different research agendas , they all maintain that " cognition is embodied " as their starting assumption4 [ see hanna and maiese ( 96 ) and ward and stapleton ( 97 )] .
but what does it really mean ?
broadly speaking , it is important to understand embodiment not as a given category that may facilitate certain aspects of perceptual and cognitive activity , or as a label to attach whenever bodily aspects are somehow involved in certain cognitive tasks .
rather , ' embodiment ' should be intended as the pre - requisite of an agent 's being - in - the - world ( 98 , 99 ) .
listening to music , thinking of a good life event , feeling sad , sharing a drink with a friend , and every other possible activity we may have experience of , are all conceivable only through our living and lived body ( 67 , 100 , 101 ) .
as di paolo and colleagues argue : " to say that cognition is embodied is to express a tautology - it simply cannot but be embodied " [ di paolo et al. ( 102 ) , p. 42 ] .
this passage is best understood when considering what varela et al .
( 50 ) define as the " three dimensions of embodiment " : bodily self - regulation , sensorimotor coupling , and intersubjective interaction .
analyzed by several contributors [ e.g. , thompson ( 59 )] , these insights offer a thorough perspective on the embodied view , emphasizing the explanatory power of moving beyond cognitivism across different levels of analysis .
importantly , as we will see , these " three dimensions " are extremely relevant for our discussion on music - based therapy for parkinson 's disease ( pd ) patients , which we offer below .
bodily self - regulation bodily self - regulation concerns the way an agent 's biological structure contributes in regulating , modifying , and controlling its homeodynamic requirements .
these processes of metabolic autonomy ensure that the agent is alive and that it maintains a stable interaction with the world .
importantly , as reported by colombetti ( 103 ) , there is no ' self ' in self - organizing organisms : no ' message ' is exchanged in hierarchical fashion between different independent levels via top - down or bottom - up pathways ( 104 ) .
instead , the chemical , thermodynamic , and metabolic activity of the system 's sub - networks participates as a whole in maintaining the system 's homeostatic adaptivity .
the process leading to adaptive stability , in which the living system ( i.e. , a unicellular organism , a mammalian , etc. ) strives to maintain its autonomous identity , is realized through self - producing all that is needed for its maintenance ( 105 , 106 ) .
the process , in other words , is not led by a ' ghost in the machine ,' but rather by homeostasis ( 103 ) .
consider the role of emotions , for example : seen as self - regulative processes ( 107 , 108 ) , they emerge within the dynamical interaction of a number of neural and extra - neural components , and not simply via an input - output sequential chain of events ( 57 ) .
indeed , although defining an operationally closed network,5 the self - regulating processes aimed at keeping the agent 's conservation as auto - sufficient , do establish a meaningful dialectic with the environment : " whence the intriguing paradoxicality proper to an autonomous identity : the living system must distinguish itself from its environment , while at the same time maintaining its coupling ; this linkage cannot be detached since it is against this very environment from which the organism arises , comes forth " [ varela ( 109 ) , p. 85 ]. by this view , all living systems are " self - organizing thermodynamic systems with emergent truly global or inherently dominating intrinsic structure , and not mere mechanisms like a can - opener or a digital computer " [ hanna and maiese ( 96 ) , p. 20 ] .
the integrity of self - regulative processes always involves world , body , and brain at multiple levels and time - scales ( 110 ). with regard to human musicality , these insights have been recently explored by research on bodily self - regulation in joint improvisation ( 111 ) and by the development of an enactive theory of musical emotions ( schiavio et al. , under review ) .
sensorimotor coupling the second dimension of embodiment is sensorimotor coupling , which may refer to ( i ) the integration of sensorial and motor information occurring in the human brain ( 112 ) , and ( ii ) the embodied forms of mutual determination established by organism and environment ( 113 ) .
while ( i ) and ( ii ) should always be considered as mutually dependent [( 114 ) , and see discussion in the section " intersubjective interaction "] , for reasons of simplification we now briefly treat them separately .
perceptual processes , traditionally , are identified with a unidirectional stream of data from the world ' out there ' that is retrieved , codified , and represented ' in the head ,' eventually leading to a behavioral output ( movement ) ( 115 ) .
this process is putatively made possible by an exchange of information proceeding from the associative cortex to the agranular frontal cortex - where information is integrated with more sophisticated ( i.e. , decision making ) aspects of intelligence .
modern neuroscience , however , is well aware of the limitations of this traditional model .
consider , for example , the highly complex cytoarchitectonic organization of the frontal lobe 's motor cortex : as gallese ( 115 ) notes , a number of anatomical and neurophysiological findings have revealed a rich variety of anatomo - functional areas , each endowed with specific functional properties and related to each other forming distinct cortico - cortical circuits ( 116 ) .
this means that each of these parieto - premotor circuits continuously participates in integrating sensorial and motor information , contributing in redefining the role of the motor cortex - from a mere ' muscle controller ' to a much more complicated system ( 74 ) .
here , within the inferior frontal gyrus , the lower part of the precentral gyrus and the temporal , occipital , and parietal visual areas ( 117 ) the existence of a so - called ' mirror ' system ( 116 , 118 , 119 ) has been posited to indicate a set of bimodal and trimodal neurons , which are elicited not only when doing a given action but also when observing ( and / or hearing , in the case of trimodal neurons ) another individual performing the same action6 ( 120 , 121 ) .
thus , it is argued that in the brain , perception and action are not separated entities somehow encapsulated in autonomous and independent modules .
rather , they are always mutually integrated through a complex web of sensorimotor connectivity , involving anticipatory mechanisms that enable the system to respond adequately to the demands of the environment ( 122 , 123 ) .
in league with this discussion , a number of empirical findings report the activation of neural circuits involved in motor activity and the planning of motor sequences during listening tasks ( 22 , 124 ) .
in a well - known pet study , halpern and zatorre ( 125 ) demonstrated that when musicians listen to or imagine music , blood - flow significantly increases in the right supplementary motor area ( sma ) , a region which is implicated in motor control [ see also kristeva et al. ( 126 )] .
as rodger et al .
( 127 ) comments , the involvement of sma and other brain areas - i.e. , basal ganglia , and cerebellum - in similar tasks ( 128 , 129 ) is usually seen to support " hypotheses about the induction of a sense of beat or pulse in the listener " [ iyer ( 130 ) , p. 392 ] .
to this , we add that these findings also reflect more generally the ecological situatedness of the whole organism : listening to music involves an active , skillful , sensorimotor , exercise , which is intrinsically determined by the sensorimotor expertise ( in terms of motor vocabulary of musical actions , for example ) of the musical animal - i.e. , its personal capacity to co - constitute ( and act in ) its niche , through the establishment of a repertoire of meaningful relationships by which it maintains its autonomous identity or a ' point of view ' ( 131 - 134 ) .
this resonates closely with a main principle of the ' enactive approach ,' namely , the idea that perception and action are radically entwined extraneurally in non - linear terms - and that this forms the basis for our being - in - the world ( 59 ) .
put simply , from this perspective , it is not only the brain that is exposed to musical feedback .
rather , the entire living system - with his or her listening biography , body , affectivity , and history of structural couplings with the ( sonic and cultural ) environment - participates as a whole in musical experience ( 46 , 93 , 127 , 135 - 138 ) .
we will further develop these insights when discussing of pd treatments .
intersubjective interaction the third dimension of embodiment - intersubjective interaction - aims to look beyond traditional ' mentalistic ' approaches of social cognition , which often conceive of social understanding in terms of simulation - like mechanisms7 or through the construction of theoretical , spectatorial , models8 ( 139 - 142 ) .
embodied - enactive in particular - approaches to interactivity , instead , define the processes of mutual interactions and coordination as self - regulative and sensorimotor networks ( 143 - 146 ) .
these networks are based on recursive patterns of action and perception mutually shaping each other dynamically ( 147 ) .
consider two ( or more ) individuals playing together : no matter how much they rehearsed jointly or how many times they played the same piece , there will always be a sense in which each performance is different from one another , as even one brief ' crescendo ' by a musician ( or a particular environmental setting , or audience , etc. ) will affect the other and the overall performance in real time [( 138 , 148 , 149 ) , p. 40 ] .
as cognition is a process that occurs in a domain of interactions , it is realized through the biological morphology of the body and its dynamical and sensorimotor interplay with the others , where these aspects represent different typologies of embodiment and not separated domains ( 150 ) .
the body is not a rigid and fixed object , but rather a flexible entity that acts in ( it modifies and responds to ) the world ( 151 ) ; it is an " imprint of social engagement " ( ibid. ) .
the living and lived body is what allows the meaningful interactions with its environment ; it is , as we stated above , the pre - condition for being - in - the - world ( 67 , 152 ) .
the brain , accordingly , can be seen as ' participating ' in the action rather than ' controlling ' it9 ( 122 ) .
if cognition is realized in the domain of the system 's meaningful and embodied interactivity , it is not ' located ' in any traditional sense ; rather it bypasses the notions of ' internal ' and ' external ' ( 95 , 114 ) .
the notion of embodiment , therefore , encompasses all the processes connected to living subjectivity , shaping , and being shaped by the environment in which an agent is embedded .
this does not only entail ' basic ' processes - such as perception or interaction : there is growing agreement across a variety of domains in highlighting the body 's crucial role for high - level skills - such as problem solving and reasoning ( 153 ) .
along these lines , it has been demonstrated that visual and rhythmic perception are shaped by looking and by body movements in both infants and adults ( 154 - 157 ) , that motor experience facilitates memory for musical excerpts ( 158 ) , and that walking is crucial for an infant cognitive development ( 72 ) .
put simply , if we reduce mental life to the activity of the brain and the central nervous system , we may lose an important chance to understand the organism as ecologically situated - where bodies are not reduced to representations in the somatosensory cortex but are instead seen as constitutive category of the system 's being - in - the world .
embodied theories entail both " micro phenomena within the body , for example , the physiology of sight , the biochemistry of muscle cell contraction , [ and ] macro phenomena , for example , the evolution of ecosystems " [ krieger ( 159 ) , p. 351 ] .
while the relevance of these insights is recognized by different authors in the context of cognitive science and philosophy of mind , it remains partially unexplored within other domains .
in the section " a network of non - linear interactions ," thus , we will consider the challenge posited by the embodied approaches more in detail , discussing how they may help us reconsider the ways in which we look at brain science .
a network of non - linear interactions in the last few decades , a growing number of researchers became interested not only in analyzing the cognitive operations in play while performing a musically relevant task , but also in understanding how are these operations associated with particular ( networks of ) brain regions10 ( 161 , 162 ) .
although most neuroscientific research has moved from functional segregation to functional integration [ see friston ( 163 , 164 )] , and a number of brain scientists expressed doubts toward both neural localization and models based on a mind - brain identity as legitimate explanatory tools [ see bennett and hacker ( 165 ) and fuchs ( 166 )] , the tendency to look for ' neural correlates of music processing ' nevertheless remains within musical research .
as peretz and coltheart admit , " musical abilities are [...] studied as part of a distinct mental module with its own procedures and knowledge bases that are associated with dedicated and separate neural substrates " ( 2003 , p. 688 ) ( 167 ) .
this view of music as functionally autonomous seems to contrast with a vast range of findings in the literature , which highlight the multimodal and plastic nature of brain processing mechanisms and the widely distributed neural networks in both hemispheres this involves ( 168 , 169 ) .
" brain anatomy reveals that brain regions are interconnected in a rich and dense pattern , both locally and in terms of long - range connections " [ pessoa ( 170 ) , p. 198 ] .
to put it in a different way , anatomical segregations of musical functions seem to disregard the role of overlapping cortical regions and interindividual differences in brain substrates ( 171 ) , as well as the observed evidence of ontogenetically developed - and rapidly adaptive - cerebral networks ( 24 , 72 ) .
neurons themselves display dynamical properties : there is no simple mapping from neural activity to behavior as what the neurons code depend on various time and contexts ( 172 ) .
cross - sectional approaches to the study of the brain , thus , may downplay the developmental and ecological aspects shaping the living being - environment relationship ( 87 ) .
the brain is dynamical , self - organizing,11 and massively distributed ( 104 , 174 ) : it mediates and enables the non - linear12 and reciprocal interactions between the body and the world .
information , by this view , is not passively retrieved from the ' outer word ' but rather enacted through the meaningful and sensorimotor activity of the organism13 ( 50 ) .
thus , because both genetic and ecological factors influence the development of neuronal networks ( 177 - 180 ) a number of scholars have found it necessary to look beyond brain reductionism ( 59 , 88 , 171 , 181 ) and integrate traditional neuroscientific research with the study of a wider organism - world nexus ( 50 , 57 , 182 ) .
for example , recent work by kiverstein and miller ( 58 ) , and pessoa ( 170 ) , shows how ' structure - function ' mappings are best understood in terms of dynamical sub - components of a larger network , where a given function is highly context dependent and may vary over time in its dynamical interplay with the environment , which offers the animal various possibilities for actions according to its degree of complexity ( 183 ) .
it is worth noticing that the insistence on large - scale dynamic networks resonates closely with the view that sees cognition as belonging to a ' relational domain ' ( 184 ) , in which the living system acts in ways that are relevant to sustaining itself under precarious conditions .
to understand the global behavior of a living organism , then , we need to do more than simply analyze one of its sub - components ( i.e. , the pathways underlying autonomic and muscular responses to music ) , as none of the system 's part controls and defines the system by itself ( 185 ) .
the relation between biological organization and cognitive functions is thus best understood as ' circular ,' rather than ' linearly causal ' ( 71 ) .
this is to say that an embodied view on human musicality - and human cognition more generally - replaces the classic input / output framework with a non - linear perturbation / response distinction , in which the brain does play a very important part , but is not the sole factor involved. by understanding cognitive processes as widely distributed across the entire body of the animal , and into its niche , the embodied approach goes beyond brain reductionism and provides a welcome alternative to classic computational frameworks ( 50 ) .
in what remains , we apply these insights to clinical research , arguing that an embodied perspective may help us address some of the challenges that emerge within this context in new ways .
focusing on music - based rehabilitative paradigms for pd patients , we explore the possibility that music may not just act ' externally ' - somehow causing relevant behavioral responses - but rather that involves the agents' whole embodied being - in - the - world in active engagement ; that it becomes a part of the network of non - linear interactions that characterizes the brain - body - world nexus ( 182 ) .
in doing so we hope to offer new insights into some aspects of pd treatment , and thus stimulate discussion on the interpretation and development of new approaches to rehabilitation .
parkinsonism and the embodied mind parkinson 's disease is a degenerative disorder associated with the progressive loss of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia , which triggers functional changes in the same cortical network ( 186 , 187 ) .
non - motor symptoms are frequently the first signs and affect sense of smell and sleep regulation .
histologically , a classic mark of pd is represented by the presence of fibrillar aggregates of proteins called ' lewy bodies ,' which displace other internal components of the remaining neurons in the midbrain , but also in the brain stem , the olfactory bulb and - at later stages - the cerebral cortex ( 188 ) .
the severe loss of dopaminergic cell activity in the midbrain results in hypokinetic disorders such as akinesia ( the inability in initiating a movement ) , bradykinesia ( slowness of movements ) or freezing ( impossibility to move in any direction ) [ see berardelli et al. ( 189 ) and grabli et al. ( 190 )] .
usually , one of the first symptoms associated with pd is represented by an involuntary 4 - 5 hz resting movement ( 191 ) ; clinical observations suggest that this tremor may disappear in voluntary actions , but can worsen with ambulation and with ' froment 's maneuver ' ( contralateral motor activity ) ( 192 ) .
as the condition progresses , tremor is often accompanied with muscle rigidity , which leads to resistance of externally imposed joint movements ( 193 ) .
while states of relaxation may help , patients who are asked to move the contralateral limb often exhibit - like with tremor - an aggravation of the symptom ( 194 , 195 ) .
other typical motor deficits ( often , but not always , emerging in later - stage pd ) are postural instability and gait disorders , which result in an increased risk of falls ( a predictor of mortality ) and in turn critically challenge independent living habits and quality of life more generally ( 196 , 197 ) .
symptomatically , treatments with dopaminergic agonists or deep - brain stimulation have been demonstrated to be partially effective with many of these motor disorders ( 198 - 200 ) , and are thus often integrated with non - invasive techniques based on music and rhythmic engagement ( 201 , 202 ) .
extending the loop a growing wealth of evidence shows how the contribution of music - based interventions is important for improving symptoms such as parkinsonian gait ( 203 - 205 ). by matching their walking to the musical beat , or to a metronome , pd patients normally exhibit considerable benefit in terms of velocity , cadence , and stride length ( 206 , 207 ) .
interestingly , auditory cues for this kind of treatment display advantages when compared to visual , somatosensory , or combined cues : not only is reaction time to auditory cues shorter when compared to visual and tactile ones , but ' periodicity ' is also best captured in sonic contexts rather than through other sensory systems14 ( 210 , 211 ) .
indeed ' timing ' and ' periodicity ' are fundamental aspects for gait , ensuring adequate consistency in pace and stability .
as basal ganglia - cortical circuitry is typically involved in time - related processes - with a series of structures depending on dopaminergic innervation - its malfunctioning in pd has a significant impact on timing and motor synchronization ( 152 , 212 - 214 ) .
this is not to say , however , that ' timing ' can be understood as a high - level cognitive ability that is functionally autonomous and encapsulated in the brain .
first , besides the basal ganglia , it is likely that other cortical regions contribute in timing processing , thus constituting a distributed network that includes the cerebellum , sma , pre - sma , inferior parietal cortex , and premotor cortex ( 215 - 217 ) .
moreover , the basal ganglia itself is involved in the selection and inhibition of motor processes ( 218 ) , highlighting the deep connectivity of categories such as action , body , and ' timing . '
second , such connectivity implies that we cannot understand what ' timing ' and ' periodicity ' entail if we do not look beyond the boundaries of skull and skin to consider how the whole embodied agent participates in gait .
walking and synchronizing with a beat do not happen ' in the head ' ; they occur in the concrete sensorimotor dynamics of the world in which we are embedded , a world that is meaningful and rich of affordative structures ready to be acted upon .
music offers such affordances ( 219 ) according to the history of structural couplings between music users and sonic environment ( s ) ( 91 , 92 , 94 , 133 , 137 , 138 , 220 , 221 ) .
we shall return to this point in the section " beyond motor recovery. " what we want to stress , here , is that the organism 's body,15 in its ' motor resonance ' with the beat , enables the fluidity of the gait 's ' kinetic melodies' in a continuous dynamical process of action and perception .
this means that ' timing processes' - as subcomponents of the distributed network enabling gait - involve the entire body , and the world , literally extending beyond skull and skin .
thus musical rhythm offers a new pathway to enact self - organization through sensorimotor coupling by compensating for the malfunctioning of one of the system 's sub - networks .
the hyperactivity recorded in the cerebellum and in the pre - sma at the preclinical stage ( 223 - 225 ) seems to confirm these network 's self - organizing properties , which tend to develop other processes to counterbalance the impaired sensorimotor circle dynamically .
as pre - sma will eventually become hypoactive , left and right cerebellum and contralateral motor cortex have been observed as hyperactive also at later stages ( 226 ) .
moreover , the compensatory mechanisms emerging in pd 's pre - clinical and clinical stages show that self - organization also occurs on an ecological scale , integrating resources internal and external to the patient .
therefore , positing a single brain - body - world nexus - instead of the classic model based on the separation between internal ( brain - bound ) and external ( worldly ) domains - may help us better capture and model the ways in which the reorganization of the nexus' sub - networks unfolds in terms of dynamical and continuous interplay with the environment ( 175 , 227 , 228 ) .
this process of wordly self - regulation , in which patients aim to recalibrate their sensorimotor engagement with the world , should also comprehend the ' social dimension ' of embodiment , as the world involves other agents by definition .
stressing the importance of social interactions in a patient 's being - in - the - world , it would be thus interesting to see how pd patient would respond to the so - called ' perceptual crossing paradigm ,' which has been recently developed to study real - time situations in non - individualistic terms ( 229 ) .
its simple methodology , which involves only " two subjects , a one - dimensional space , and a yes / no answer " ( 230 ) , makes it particularly suitable for clinical contexts , and may illuminate on how pd affects the patient 's capacity to interact with others .
in the original experiment , as reported by auvray et al .
( 229 ) , pairs of blindfolded subjects in different rooms are asked to interact with each others in a computer - generated space .
participants are asked to move a cursor in this virtual space , clicking a mouse button when they perceive the presence of another participant .
but since subjects are blindfolded , they only receive a tactile stimulation on the free hand when their avatar crosses an object in the one - dimensional space .
there are three different types of objects to be encountered : ( i ) the moving avatar of another participant , ( ii ) an object placed in a fixed location by the experimenters , and ( iii ) the moving ' shadow image ' of the partner 's avatar , that is an object that reproduces at a displaced distance the same movements of ( i ) .
the only difference between ( i ) and ( iii ) , thus , is that with ( i ) a dyadic interaction is possible .
as froese and di paolo comment : the two mobile objects exhibit exactly the same movement , but only an overlap of the receptor fields of both participants gives rise to mutual sensory stimulation .
note that the difference between these three types of objects cannot be directly provided by the sensors , which in all cases can only produce a binary , all - or - nothing response depending on whether something is overlapping their particular receptor field or not .
thus , if the participants are to be successful at distinguishing which of the objects is the other agent 's receptor field , they must accordingly rely on differences in the kinds of interactions that these objects afford .
the results of the psychological study show that , at least under the minimalist conditions of this experiment , the successful recognition of an ongoing interaction with another person is not only based on individual capacities .
it is also based on certain properties that are intrinsic to the joint perceptual activity itself [ froese and di paolo ( 231 ) , p. 49 ] .
indeed , participants displayed greater accuracy in clicking the button when meeting the partner 's avatar ( 65.9 % of the clicks +/ - sd of 13.9 ) when compared to meeting the shadow image ( 23.0 +/ - 10.4 %) or the static object ( 11.0 +/ - 8.9 %) [ see again auvray and rohde ( 230 )] .
in the case of pd patients , we predict a significant decrease in correct answers , as their ability to interact with the world might be partially compromised by the condition .
the results , however , might be improved by exposure to motorically familiar musical cues .
indeed , hypothesizing that a malfunctioning sensorimotor coupling with the world makes the body an ' obstacle ' for the living system 's being - in - the - world ( 232 ) , listening to music one can play may help to re - establish the correct sensorimotor loop with the environment through a ' motor resonance ' enabled by the mirror mechanism .
in the section " beyond motor recovery ," we will try to describe how such hypothesis could be tested adequately , generating predictions that involve the whole living system in its dynamic interplay with the environment - and not only movements' rehabilitation .
beyond motor recovery it is likely that the ' motor resonance ' in play during music based motor rehabilitation involves the mirror mechanism mentioned above , as it does not seem to be significantly altered by pd ( 233 ) .
the activation of sensorimotor networks during music listening is well known ( 234 , 235 ) - with musicians and subjects who have a practical knowledge of the complex order actions required to obtain a particular music showing stronger activations in the front - parietal - temporal network ( 132 , 236 ) .
while the interpretation of such work is still a subject of controversy ( 237 - 239 ) , it may nevertheless be argued that a ' motor vocabulary ' of musical actions is formed when learning music .
however , the firing of the neurons that might constitute such a ' vocabulary ' ( or ' repertoire ') during listening tasks need not be understood in terms of ' information processing . '
rather it may be seen as allowing the system to prepare for action , possibly underpinning " a non - articulated immediate perception of the other person 's intentional actions " [ gallagher ( 240 ) , p. 541 ; see also gallagher ( 147 )] .
as preparation for action is indeed an important component of intersubjective contexts - both phylogenetically and ontogenetically - mirror neuron theories may help us understand some other aspects of pd rehabilitative strategies .
for example , they can explain why simple rhythmic excerpts or metronomic beats are widely and successfully adopted in this type of clinical research : almost everyone possesses ( i.e. , acquires through development ) the motor expertise necessary to produce a repetitive beat .
in this sense , the relationship between music and living systems is literally shaped by the history of structural sensorimotor coupling between them .
thus , the ( therapeutic ) compensatory mechanisms resulting from musical exposure appear to work when listeners - patients possess the adequate ( meaningful ) motor expertise relevant to re - enact the goal - directed actions afforded by the auditory cues .
a way to test this hypothesis in pd - related contexts might involve familiarizing16 subjects at an early clinical stage with musical stimuli that are more complicated than a simple beat - pulse , and then observing at a later stage of the rehabilitation whether the same stimuli are more beneficial for gait ( and - as it will emerge later - for more general improvement ) when compared to standard simple beat or to unfamiliar music .
this is to say that patients are not passive ' responders ' ; rather they actively ' enact ' their own meaningful vocabulary of musical actions during music - based interventions , bringing forth their ' autonomous identity . '
increased familiarity with music - making in both individual and collective settings could foster the development of intersubjective rehabilitative contexts , where the interactivity of patients may generate more efficient results - increasing demands in sensorimotor integration .
indeed , this approach might be taken further to involve patients in music improvisation and the co - creation of musically relevant stimuli .
put simply , we suggest that by encouraging patients to develop more complex rhythmic - musical understandings , which they then develop and apply in the course of their treatment , new clinical possibilities may emerge that involve patients more comprehensively across the range of their being .
in this way , treatment that involves increasingly adaptive and creative interactions with the environment ( musical stimuli and other patients ) , may foster ways of being - in - the - world that lead to improved self - regulation , as well as a renewed , and much needed , sense of agency .
along these lines , the use of more sophisticated musical cues , and more intersubjective settings , might also lead to beneficial results beyond the motor domain .
this is important , if we consider that a cascade of other non - somatic symptoms17 often accompanies the motor dysfunctions described in the section " extending the loop " : half of pd patients , for example , are reported to develop depression ( 241 ) .
but how could embodied theories say something about depression ? and how could music - based motor rehabilitation help ?
relevant applications in clinical settings stemming from embodied theories have been recently explored within neuropsychiatric and psychopathological research - for example in schizophrenia ( 242 ) and depression ( 232 ) .
research on the latter , in particular , suggests that depressive patients display similar symptoms to those of pd patients , including slow gait and reduced stride length ( 243 - 245 ) .
indeed , like the pd sufferer , the depressive subject experiences a loss in their dynamical relation with the world and " cannot retain a position outside of her body " [ fuchs ( 53 ) , pp. 99 - 100 ] .
this is important when considering that , as kyselo and di paolo ( 246 ) report , without the bodily power of action ( for example in case of global paralysis ) a subject may also suffer a decrease of cognitive activities such as imagery and goal - directed thinking [ see kubler and birbaumer ( 247 )] .
consider the following passage , where fuchs and schlimme ( 232 ) describe depressive melancholia as a case of ' hyperembodiment . '
the authors argue that the process of becoming separated from the living system 's peripersonal space results from psychomotor inhibition ( as in pd ) and a loss of the conative dimension of the body - its " affective and appetitive directedness " : normally , it is this [ conative ] dimension that opens up the peripersonal space as a realm of possibilities , " affordances " and goals for action .
in depressive patients , however , drive and impulse , appetite and libido are reduced or lost , no more disclosing potential sources of pleasure and satisfaction .
confined to the present state of bodily restriction , depressive patients cannot transcend their body any more .
the open horizon of possible experiences shrinks into a locked atmosphere , in which everything becomes permeated by a sense of lost possibilities. with growing inhibition , sensory - motor space is restricted to the nearest environment , culminating in depressive stupor .
thus , melancholia may be described as a reification or " corporealization " of the lived body , or as a " hyperembodiment " [ fuchs and schlimme ( 232 ) , pp. 572 - 573 ]. by this view , therapeutic interventions can be seen as an attempt to re - establish the functioning of the agent - environment system as a whole .
integrating standard rehabilitative settings for motor recovery in pd patients with more complex stimuli and activities , in early and later clinical stages , may lead to more beneficial results in terms of reshaping the motor resonance with the environment .
these results are not limited to the motor domain , but may cover also non - somatic aspects of the pathology , as in the case of depression .
art - based therapies in general , and music therapies in particular , have been widely employed in the treatment of unipolar depression ( 248 , 249 ) , leading to encouraging results .
an example comes from dance therapies , which have been proven effective in improving physical fitness and well - being more generally ( 250 - 252 ) .
acting upon the conative dimension of the sensorimotor coupling with the world , we argue that developing more meaningful musical environments could help in stabilizing the patients' embodied being - in - the - world ( in a better fashion than with unfamiliar music or rhythmical beats only ) by engaging the interactivity of the entire living system .
the mechanisms underlying this are to be found in the neural compensatory mechanisms elicited by musical participation , and by the active engagement of the body in the concrete dynamics of action ( 253 ) .
without positing a clear input - output relation between music and patient , an embodied approach to pd treatment with music emphasizes the self - regulatory aspects of brains and bodies , conceived as unities inseparable from their niche .
also , it conceives pd as a disturbance of the subjective sensorimotor skills to engage with the world , rather than solely a neurological pathology .
music , here , does not only influence the excitability of given neurons , but offers a new affordative space to the recovering embodied agent , compensating for the malfunctioning action - perception loop that characterizes the disease .
it is important to stress once again that this does not exclude affectivity but , on the contrary , highlights the conative dimension of the living body as integrative part of its perceiving , knowing , doing , and being - opening new and fascinating possibilities for health and well - being .
conclusion in avoiding the twofold reductionism of anatomical specificity and information - processing generality , the embodied trend provides a considerable challenge to established theoretical frameworks concerning the nature of mind , behavior , and agency .
' embodiment ,' although declined differently through the ' 4es' described above , embraces the centrality of self - regulation , sensorimotor coupling , and intersubjective interactions for understanding the complex nature of our being - in - the - world ( 98 , 100 ) .
we are confident this general reorientation can stimulate the development of new conceptual tools and research methods that may enhance standard rehabilitative settings within clinical contexts .
in this paper we focused on how this may occur in pd research , hypothesizing that music based therapeutic settings could become even more efficient if coherently informed by theoretical models inspired by an embodied account to cognition .
empirically , the adoption of embodied insights emphasizes the need to develop new experimental methods that are able to capture the way in which possible perturbations ( i.e. , a malfunction of a given sub - network ) destabilize the whole brain - body - world system .
strategies for intervention , by this light , should not focus only on the isolated symptom thought to provoke a desired behavioral output ( 104 ) .
rather , an embodied approach to motor rehabilitation should also consider , for example , conative , agentic , creative , and intersubjective dimensions as fundamental for the treatment of the patient - perhaps manipulating the degree of mutual interaction and affective experience according to the motor knowledge of the patient .
indeed , a musical stimulus ( beyond a mere beat ) is not only a ' timekeeper ,' but also an actual tool for cognition , a meaningful event that affords a variety of self - regulative , interactive , and sensorimotor processes depending of the agent - music interaction 's degree of complexity. with this in mind , and drawing on insights from research on mirror neurons , we hypothesized that pd patients might benefit from familiarization phases with more complex stimuli beginning in the early stages of the disease .
the compensatory mechanisms in play during exposure to musical rhythms might then be more widely effective in the recovery of other ( i.e. , depressive ) symptoms .
this is just one example of how embodied approaches may define a broader approach to the study of pd rehabilitation , and why it necessitates further discussion and testing .
overall , what we want to emphasize is that , theoretically , this kind of non - reductionist approach may be fundamental in rethinking many taken - for - granted assumptions concerning health and well - being , neuroscience , and music research .
while the operational domain of the system 's internal ( e.g. , brain ) states is certainly fundamental to the interactive processes of such interactions , these internal processes alone cannot be identified with ' cognition ' : to do so " is to confuse levels of discourse or to make a category mistake ( neurons do not think and feel ; people and animals do )" [ thompson and stapleton ( 95 ) , p. 27 ] .
in other words , the processes allowing the system to maintain itself as autonomous are realized in the sensorimotor , dynamic , affective , interplay between bodies ( including brains ) and environments .
these processes , as a whole , are not strictly speaking " neural ," but rather define a non - linear network constituted by both neural and extra - neural interactive sub - networks ( 50 ) .
consider , for example , research in music psychology : while it is diverse and interdisciplinary , incorporating both ' subjective ' ( i.e. , introspective , qualitative ) and ' objective ' ( i.e. , quantitative ) methodologies ( 254 ) , a common tacit assumption in the field is that ( musical ) experience is inner , computationally implemented , and reducible to neural activation .
embodied approaches challenge this perspective , showing that human musicality is deeply embodied ( being constantly implemented by sensorimotor feedbacks and real - time bodily activities ) , embedded ( as it is always situated in specific sociocultural niche ) , enacted ( relying on the history of structural couplings between musical agents and musical environment ) and extended ( as no clear boundaries between internal and external resources exist in driving cognitive processes ). and likewise , embodied perspectives represent a call for a new kind of integrative and non - reductionist music therapy - one that explores the possibilities of human musicality from diverse perspectives ; and that may transform motor rehabilitation into a participatory activity where motion , emotion , listening biographies , and neural networks are all involved in a complex recursive interplay ( 255 ) .
data on brain and behavioral activities has contributed greatly to new perspectives on the audio - visuo - motor integration underlying musical experience .
we wish to stimulate researchers to integrate this body of knowledge with a critical analysis of the theoretical models underlying rehabilitative contexts ( i.e. , information - processing ) .
thus , by moving beyond traditional input - output and stimulus - response paradigms , our approach identifies large - scale networks ( inside and outside the skull ) as a solid alternative to reductionist approaches - highlighting the explanatory role of embodied perspectives in describing how an autonomous system develops , stabilizes , and transforms according to the reciprocal influences of local and global factors .
in this way , hypokinesia , tremor , rigidity - but also depression , and other non - somatic symptoms - may be understood in a new light : as affecting the patient 's being - in - the - world in a way that requires an recalibration of the whole brain - body - world network .
in this way , the development of richer , embodied approaches to music intervention for pd ( and other disorders ) not only offers possibilities for improving the general quality of life of patients , it may also help us better understand how therapeutic recalibration occurs providing additional insights for clinical , musical , and neuroscientific , research .

1'mind ' and ' cognition ' are used as synonyms in this paper .
2as we will see , this main claim inspired the development of different research programs .
3representational structures are usually defined by computational procedures that operate in light of ( are realised by ) functionally autonomous cortical regions .
4although there is certainly a continuity among these perspectives , it should be noted that some of the arguments used by proponents of the extended mind thesis stand in open contrast with an enactive characterisation of cognition , and might eventually collapse into a functionalist - like framework , where computations and representation would still play a key role in driving cognitive processes , even if coupled with external resources [ see thompson and stapleton ( 95 )] .
5indeed , the internal self - regulative processes are theoretically sufficient to maintain the agent 's homeostatic stability .
6as it is well known , these " mirror neurons " do not code the precise movement performed by another individual but , rather , the goal of the given action .
as long as the goal of a given action is different , these neurons are selective enough to distinguish between different kinematic schemas ( 74 ) .
7the theory holds that understanding the behaviours and the beliefs of others is a matter of simulating them internally with my own cognitive system - " as if " i was behaving that way or possessing that belief .
8accordingly , people manage to make sense of the others by developing a " common - sense " theory of mind consisting of sets of laws connecting inner states to external stimuli , other inner states , or behaviours .
9as di paolo and colleagues insist : " embodiment means that mind is inherent in the active , worldful body , that the body is not a puppet controlled by the brain but a whole animate system with many autonomous layers of self - coordination and self - organization and various degrees of openness to the world that create its sense - making activity " [ di paolo et al. ( 102 ) , p. 42 ] .
10from the focus on the theoretical level between physical implementation and behavioural output ( as in classical cognitivism ) , the exploration of the brain 's functional neuroanatomy led a number of scholars to maintain that different brain regions represent different musical functions , such that neural tissue at a specific location govern given cognitive features [ e.g. , tan et al. ( 160 )] .
11 " systems are self - organized when there is a reciprocal relationship among local areas and behavior at the global state of the system " ( 173 ) .
12these interactions are " non - linear " because in a system of reciprocal continuity there is no clear " input " or " output " ( 59 , 104 ) .
13consider , for example , the nervous system : its inner states are always stimulated by the environment , but not influenced causally through an input - output relation ; " the nervous system does not receive information .
it rather creates a world by defining which configurations of the milieu are stimuli " [ weber ( 106 ) , p. 15 ] .
functional localisation , reductionism , and ' internalist ' frameworks are unable to capture these aspects by definition , as self - organisation occurs at a larger ecological scale ( 175 , 176 ) .
14to clarify this point , consider the apparent universality and spontaneity of sensorimotor synchronisation and impulse to move with music : evolutionary , this phenomenon may have promoted coordination and emotional communication ( 208 , 209 ) , contributing in strengthening the link between musical behaviours and wellbeing in intersubjective contexts .
15it is important to note that here we refer to " body " not as an objective piece of the world - the german " korper " - but also as " leib ," a living and lived body with its autonomous and dynamical layers of self - organizational adaptivity [ see gallagher and zahavi ( 222 ) and merleau - ponty ( 67 )] .
16that is , developing the sensorimotor skills required to perform the musical stimuli .
17other symptoms may include hallucinations , disorders of sleep and behaviour , dementia , psychosis , decrease of attention and memory , and language impairment .

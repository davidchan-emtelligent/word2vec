dilated cardiomyopathy ( dcm ) is caused by reduced left ventricular ( lv ) myocardial function , which is one of the most common causes of heart failure ( hf ) .
we performed itraq - coupled 2d - lc - ms / ms to profile the cardiac proteome of lv tissues from healthy controls and patients with end - stage dcm .
we identified 4263 proteins , of which 125 were differentially expressed in dcm tissues compared to lv controls .
the majority of these were membrane proteins related to cellular junctions and neuronal metabolism .
in addition , these proteins were involved in membrane organization , mitochondrial organization , translation , protein transport , and cell death process .
four key proteins involved in the cell death process were also detected by western blotting , indicated that cell death was activated in dcm tissues .
furthermore , s100a1 and eef2 were enriched in the " cellular assembly and organization " and " cell cycle " networks , respectively .
we verified decreases in these two proteins in end - stage dcm lv samples through multiple reaction monitoring ( mrm ) .
these observations demonstrate that our understanding of the mechanisms underlying dcm can be deepened through comparison of the proteomes of normal lv tissues with that from end - stage dcm in humans .
dilated cardiomyopathy left ventricle cell death s100a1 eef2 introduction dilated cardiomyopathy ( dcm ) is a type of chronic cardiovascular disease characterized by a dilation of the left or both ventricles [ 1 ] .
dcm remains asymptomatic at an early stage and deteriorates gradually into heart failure ( hf ) without timely and effective treatment [ 2 ] .
severe cases require one or more surgical procedures , which causes an enormous burden to families and society .
the progression from dcm to hf involves multiple causes and complex mechanisms [ 3 , 4 ] .
remarkable progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of dcm .
nevertheless , the set of studied genes related to dcm (~ 30 ) and their associated variants account for less than half of the genomic cause of dcm [ 5 ] .
most previous studies on molecular changes related to dcm focused on the transcriptome [ 6 , 7 ] .
comparative proteomic analysis is a powerful diagnostic tool to determine the onset , progression , and prognosis of human diseases [ 8 ] .
2 - d gel proteomics analysis was also used to reveal alterations in dcm [ 9 ] ; however , the data scale was not large enough .
the recent development of liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ( lc - ms / ms ) technology in high - resolution platforms allowed for better detection of proteins expressed in low abundance [ 10 , 11 ] .
ms - based quantitative proteomics approaches , such as itraq [ 12 ] , silac ( stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell cultures [ 13 ] , mrm [ 14 ] and label - free techniques , have become increasingly useful to cardiovascular disease research [ 15 - 18 ] .
at present , there are only a handful used biomarkers to guide clinical decision for dcm such as brain natriuretic peptide ( bnp ) [ 19 , 20 ] and st2 [ 21 , 22 ] , which can be used to predict risk of decompensation .
finding effective biomarkers and elucidating the pathogenic mechanism underlying dcm could improve the prognosis of patients .
recently , many studies have reported a large - scale cardiac proteome from whole heart [ 23 ] , left ventricle ( lv ) [ 24 , 25 ] and fetal heart [ 26 ] , which revealed heart - specific proteins and differences between the human cardiac chambers ( atrium - enriched intracellular transport and ventricle - enriched muscle contraction ) .
in addition , only a preliminary study on proteomic and transcriptomic alterations in dcm compared to normal lv was reported , which found 16 molecules changed conformably by proteomic and transcriptomic analysis [ 27 ] .
here , we used itraq - coupled 2d lc - ms / ms to conduct an in - depth quantitative profiling of the cardiac proteome of left ventricular tissues from normal and end - stage dilated cardiomyopathy hearts .
understanding the proteome will further our knowledge of the function of the cardiovascular system , thereby revealing new potential diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets to treat dcm .
results analysis of left ventricular proteomic profiling from normal human and end - stage dcm patients to investigate the cardiac protein alterations in end - stage dcm patients , we used quantitative proteomic analysis on normal and end - stage dcm human lvs ( three samples per group ) , applying the itraq - coupled 2d lc - ms / ms method .
the workflow of this study was presented in figure 1 .
in total , 4263 proteins were identified and 4099 proteins were successfully quantified in the normal and end - stage dcm lvs , of which 125 proteins showed significant differences ( supplementary table s1 & supplementary table s2 ) .
the identified proteins , especially those with differential expression in end - stage dcm versus normal lvs , were imported to expasy , david and ipa software to analyze their physicochemical properties and biological characteristics .
proteins known to participate in major biological functions were further analyzed by western blot and mrm .
figure 1 schematic of cardiac proteomic analysis of the left ventricular tissues from normal and end - stage dilated cardiomyopathy hearts figure 2a shows a comparison between our data and several other heart proteome datasets .
the histogram plot shows the comparison between our data and human lv proteome data from heck 's work and kuster 's work , which identified 3584 proteins and 4031 proteins , respectively [ 24 , 25 ] in healthy human lv. to date , our lv proteomic profiling is one of the largest datasets for human lv. the venn diagram shows the comparison between our data and pandey 's human proteome map ( available as an interactive web - based resource at http :// www.humanproteomemap.org ) , which identified 6626 proteins from adult whole heart tissue [ 23 ] .
our dataset , which focused only on lv , identified 688 extra proteins compared with pandey 's in - depth heart proteomic profiling .
to further investigate human lv proteins , we analyzed their physicochemical properties and biological processes .
we found that 45.3 % of the identified proteins had a molecular weight ( mw )<= 40 kda ( figure 2b ) , 52.5 % were weakly acidic ( pi 5.0 - 7.0 ) ( figure 2c ) , and 17.8 % had at least one transmembrane domain ( 58.4 % of which had a single trans membrane domain ) ( figure 2d ) .
these lv proteins can be grossly classified in three categories : energy production ( mitochondrial organization and tricarboxylic acid cycle ) , cardiac contraction ( cellular adhesion , protein transport and muscle contraction ) , and protein synthesis ( protein translation , mrna catabolic process , and protein folding ) .
figure 2e listed the most representative biological processes of the lv proteins we identified .

gene ontology enrichment analysis of changed cardiac proteins in end - stage dcm proteins showing over 1.2 - fold in increase or at least 0.83 - fold in decrease , with p - value < 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed .
in total , 40 upregulated and 85 downregulated proteins were screened out for further analyses ( figure 3a ) .
since proteins secreted by cells in response to various stimuli are the most likely to be found in blood / plasma , it is a promising and practical approach to look for potential biomarkers in secretomes .
we used secretomep to predict potential secreted proteins from 125 differentially the expressed proteins .
we found 41 potential secreted proteins , with ten of them being previously reported as potential plasma / serum biomarkers for different diseases ( figure 3b - 3c ) .
detailed protein descriptions and relevant literature are summarized in supplementary table s3 .
we performed gene ontology analysis on these differentially expressed proteins to elucidate their biological functions in end - stage dcm. of all altered proteins , 20.8 % functioned in mitochondria ( mt ) , 16.8 % were related to the cytoskeleton , 21.6 % were cytoplasmic proteins , 9.6 % functioned in the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) , 11.2 % in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , and 14.4 % in the nucleus .
notably , we found that 77.6 % of all these changed proteins are membrane proteins ( figure 3d ) .
we then used ipa to investigate the top five enriched canonical pathways in which these differentially expressed proteins participate , including the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathway , semaphoring signaling in neurons , choline degradation i , germ - sertoli cell - cell junction , and epithelial adherens junction ( figure 3d ) .
our results show that most differentially expressed proteins in end - stage dcm versus normal lvs contributed to membrane organization .
furthermore , mitochondrial organization , translational elongation and protein folding processes were also prominent in dcm , followed by lipid transport and cell death processes ( figure 3e ) .
enrichment of changed proteins in cell death processes indicated that the dcm samples might have developed to the end point of heart failure .
we used western blot to measure the levels of four proteins relevant to cell death in every lv sample , namely cytochrome c , atf6 , caspase 3 , and chop .
the targeted protein bands of the four proteins in lv are shown in supplementary figure s1 .
we found that these four proteins were upregulated in lv , suggesting the activation of cell death processes in our dcm samples ( figure 3f ) .

network analysis of changed proteins in end - stage dcm and the verification of s100a1 and eef2 expression to evaluate the potential associations among the 125 differentially expressed proteins , we analyzed their possible protein - protein interactions using literature - curated databases .
then , the differentially expressed proteins were mainly focused on five networks ( supplementary figure s2 ) .
the five networks can be divided into four categories : cell death and dna replication , cellular assembly and organization , cell cycle , and lipid metabolism .
we paid more attention to the two networks with the highest scores , namely the " cellular assembly and organization " and the " cell cycle " networks ( figure 4a - 4b ) .
twenty differential proteins participated in the cellular assembly and organization network .
four proteins displayed increased expressional trend , and sixteen proteins exhibited decreased expression in end - stage dcm .
nineteen differential proteins were involved in the cell cycle network .
four proteins of which were increased , and fifteen proteins were decreased .
literature retrieval to explore the relationships of these proteins in the two networks with major cardiovascular diseases are shown in supplementary table s4 , revealing that nine of the twenty proteins in the " cellular assembly and organization " network and six of the nineteen proteins in the " cell cycle " network have been reported to be associated with myocardial infarction ( mi ) , ischemia reperfusion ( i / r ) , atherosclerosis ( as ) , coronary syndrome ( cs ) or dcm .
two down - regulated proteins in these networks , s100a1 ( s100 calcium binding protein a1 ) and eef2 ( eukaryotic elongation factor 2 ) , were validated with the mrm method .
the unique peptide ellqtelsgfldaqk from s100a1 was screened out by following criteria established by the srmatlas platform ( without modification , without missed cleavage , without share with others ) .
figure 4c & supplementary figure s3 show the skyline - extracted ion chromatograms for the peptide on six samples with its transition peaks ( y8 / 865.4414 , y7 / 778.4094 , y5 / 574.3195 , y4 / 461.2354 ) .
the two unique peptides gggqiiptar and gvqylneik from eef2 were found using the same criteria .
figure 4d - 4e & supplementary figure s4 , show the skyline - extracted ion chromatograms for the two peptide on six samples with their transitions , ( y6 / 670.4246 , y5 / 557.3406 , y4 / 444.2565 , b4 / 300.1302 , b5 / 413.2143 , b6 / 526.298 ) and ( y7 / 907.4884 , y6 / 779.4298 , y4 / 503.2824 ) , respectively .
a summary of skyline quantitation data for these product ions from the three peptides is shown in supplementary table s5 .
the average ratio ( dcm / normal ) of the peptide from s100a1 is 0.85 with a 21.45 % coefficient of variation ( cv ) .
the average ratios ( dcm / normal ) of the two peptides from eef2 are 0.62 ( cv = 6.27 %) for gggqiiptar and 0.41 ( cv = 31.22 %) for gvqylneik .
thus , in the end - stage dcm samples , s100a1 and eef2 were downregulated according to mrm results , which are consistent with the itraq quantification results .

discussion heart has four different chambers , which are responsible for different functions .
reduced systolic and diastolic ability of lv is one of the major causes for dcm , yet the pathogenic mechanisms of dcm are not fully understood .
thus , we investigated alterations in left ventricular protein expression in end - stage dcm using itraq - coupled 2d lc - ms / ms method .
we identified a total of 4263 proteins in lv and found 125 proteins that were differentially expressed in end - stage dcm versus normal lvs .
so far , our dataset is one of the largest datasets for human lv so far .
gene ontology analysis of the lv proteome highlighted the characteristic functions of heart tissue , such as muscle contraction , cell adhesion , and mitochondrial organization , etc .
cardiac contraction to deliver blood throughout the body is the core function of heart tissue .
initially , pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node of the heart generate an action potential .
then , transmission of contractile force from one cell to another is accomplished by gap junctions and a steady supply of atp is required to sustain cardiac contraction .
researches have shown many mutations in proteins found in junctional structures and mitochondria , which resulted in increased deterioration of the heart 's pump function [ 28 , 29 ] .
in addition , we found many proteins differentially expressed in end - stage dcm are membrane proteins ( figure 3d ) through quantification of more than 4000 proteins .
unsurprisingly , dcm - associated proteins were enriched in membrane organization processes when compared with the whole lv proteome ( figure 2e & figure 3e ) .
membrane proteins included ion channels and receptors , etc. , which are critical for calcium storage and transmission of force among cardio - myocytes .
these changed membrane proteins in end - stage dcm are involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , semaphoring signaling in neurons and choline degradation i. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can cause the death of neurons that control voluntary muscles , and is also associated with sudden cardiac death and stress - induced cardiomyopathy [ 30 ] .
semaphorins are a large family of secreted or membrane - associated glycoproteins and are usually cues to deflect axons from inappropriate regions , especially important in neural system development .
vital roles for semaphorin signaling in vascular patterning and cardiac morphogenesis have been demonstrated [ 31 ] .
choline is the precursor molecule for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine , which is involved in many functions including memory and muscle control .
choline deficiency in the clinical setting could affect the overall recovery of a patient with heart problems [ 32 ] .
previous studies have demonstrated that over - activation of the nervous system was associated with worsening heart failure and the development of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias [ 33 ] .
thus , appropriate membrane protein - targeted mechanical exploration could be performed to modulate the cardiac nervous metabolism in dcm .
cellular assembly and organization can provide a macromolecular infrastructure to integrate mechanical and electrical coupling within the heart , which mainly involves assembly of the cardiac disk and organization of adherens junctions [ 34 ] .
some core proteins in the camk ii and calmodulin networks are important for calcium signaling to maintain cardiac contraction [ 35 , 36 ] .
the other core proteins in the network - pdgf complex ( platelet derived growth factor ) and nfkappab ( nuclear factor kappa b ) , were important factors that participate in cellular response to extracellular stimuli [ 37 , 38 ] ( figure 4a ) .
in our study , s100a1 was downregulated in end - stage dcm patients , which was verified by mrm .
s100a1 was predominantly found in lv with the highest protein levels [ 39 - 40 ] .
in 1996 , remppis et al. first demonstrated that diminished s100a1 protein levels were related to dysfunctional human myocardium in congestive heart failure [ 41 ] .
subsequently , the relationship between s100a1 and cardiovascular events was examined in several population - based studies .
a variety of animal heart failure models provided further evidence for decreased cardiac s100a1 protein levels as a molecular signature of failing myocardium in vivo [ 42 - 45 ] .
uncontrolled s100a1 expression has been linked to hf in human dilated cardiomyopathies as well as in various hf animal models [ 46 ] .
however , the role of s100a1 in dcm remains elusive .
our findings highlight s100a1 's effects in human cardiomyocytes and the potential benefits of an s100a1 - targeted mechanical exploration in dcm .
the cell cycle network is related to proliferation and apoptosis and ensures appropriate heart size and development .
decreased levels of cellular cycle proteins prevent the regeneration of cardiomyocytes and result in decreased contractile ability in dcm [ 47 ] .
in our study , core proteins in the cell cycle network that were differentially expressed include caspases , erk ( extracellular signal - regulated kinase ) , and tcr ( t cell receptor ) ( figure 4b ) .
the modulation of erk cascades can protect the heart from cell death to control the cellular growth and the development of pathological hypertrophy [ 48 ] .
caspases regulate many cellular processes from cell death to signal propagation [ 49 ] .
t cell proliferation can be triggered by antigen - tcr ligation to regulate a series of immunological responses [ 50 ] .
the 19 proteins we found to be differentially expressed in the cell cycle network have not been studied in the context of dcm .
in our study , one of these proteins , eef2 , was related to multiple cardiovascular diseases ( supplementary table s4 ) .
the relationships between the cell cycle and eef2 have been examined in several population - based studies .
overexpression of eef2 in gastrointestinal cancers impacted g2 / m progression in the cell cycle [ 51 ] .
previous studies have also demonstrated that eef2 is inhibited during myocardial ischemia [ 52 ] .
furthermore , the inhibition of cell growth could be impacted via the ampk / eef2 kinase / eef2 signaling pathway and slow the progression of cardiac hypertrophy [ 53 ] .
in our study , the eukaryotic elongation factor eef2 was downregulated in end - stage dcm patients as measured by itraq lc - ms / ms analysis , which was verified by mrm .
the functions of eef2 have been rarely studied in the context of cardiovascular diseases and deserve further investigation in dcm .
in summary , we performed an in - depth quantitative profiling of the cardiac proteome of left ventricular tissues from normal and end - stage dilated cardiomyopathy hearts using itraq - coupled 2d lc - ms / ms. the analysis of our comprehensive proteomic data established a reference for understanding pathogenic mechanisms underlying dcm .
the differentially expressed proteins we found may be valuable candidates for future biomarker discovery .
furthermore , we showed that s100a1 and eef2 were downregulated in end - stage dcm .
future experiments should be performed to gain more insight into how these proteins impact dcm progression .
materials and methods ethics statement and tissue collection the study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the declaration of helsinki .

these novel species forms have implications for the concept of acomoptera that in turn , may impact our understanding of its generic relationships and the evolution and composition of gnoristinae and sciophilinae .
the new species , acomoptera crispa , acomoptera digitata , acomoptera echinosa , acomoptera forculata , acomoptera nelsoni,and acomoptera vockerothi , are compared with the type species of the genus , acomoptera plexipus ( garrett ) , whose diagnostic features are imaged and illustrated for the first time .
the european species , acomoptera difficilis ( dziedzicki ) is also illustrated and compared .
acomoptera spinistyla ( soli ) comb. n. is transferred from drepanocercus .
a key to species is provided .
future work will seek to incorporate this knowledge into a systematic phylogenetic study of relationships between these species and their sister taxa .
keywords systematics sciophilinae sciophilini gnoristinae gnoristini paratinia drepanocercus fungus gnats new species introduction the genus acomoptera ( diptera : mycetophilidae ) was established by vockeroth ( 1980 ) for a single nearctic species , acomoptera plexipus ( garrett ) and has included only one european species , acomoptera difficilis ( dziedzicki ) .
the genus may also be present in china ( wu and yang 1990 ). by originally placing the type species in eudicrana , garrett ( 1925 ) implicitly suggested it was affiliated with the subfamily sciophilinae ( sciophilini ) .
vockeroth considered acomoptera a member of the gnoristinae ( gnoristini to some authors ) although he doubted its proper placement ( vockeroth 1980 , 1981 ; vaisanen 1986 ) .
since then , the subfamilial placement of acomoptera has gone back and forth , some preferring gnoristinae ( vockeroth 1981 , blagoderov 1998 , polevoi and jakovlev 2004 , sevcik and chandler 2008 ) while others sciophilinae ( bechev 1999 , kjaerandsen et al. 2007 , kjaerandsen and jordal 2007 ) .
most recently , rindal et al .
( 2009 ) recovered acomoptera clustered within a paraphyletic gnoristinae in a molecular study involving small fragments of two nuclear ( 18s , 28s ) and one mitochondrial gene ( 16s ) .
this schizophrenic classification history for acomoptera largely follows the various interpretations applied to acomoptera 's putative sister taxa , paratinia mik and drepanocercus vockeroth .
paratinia and drepanocercus have been placed either together in sciophilinae ( bechev 1999 , kjaerandsen et al .
2007 ) , or simultaneously in sciophilinae and gnoristinae , respectively ( vockeroth 1980 , 1981 ; soli 1993 , 1997 ; polevoi and jakovlev 2004 ) .
as noted by vockeroth ( 1980 ) , acomoptera resembles paratinia mik in eye shape , facial and antennal structure , thoracic setation , and wing venation .
soli ( 1993 ) notes that paratinia appears closely related to drepanocercus on account of having nearly naked eyes , a bare proepisternum , a distinct paratergite , and a well - developed phragma ; these states are also shared with acomoptera ( except in the last character ) .
drepanocercus and paratinia are recovered as sister taxa in soli ( 1997 ) , although this study did not include acomoptera .
in more recent morphological studies of the family , drepanocercus , paratinia , and acomoptera are recovered together ( chris borkent , pers. comm. ) .
before investigations into the phylogenetic relationships of acomoptera and other genera proceed further , it is first important to recognize the diversity of species within acomoptera itself .
the holotype of the type species , acomoptera plexipus ( garrett ) , is a female and now badly damaged and covered by fungal spores ( fig. 21b ) .
vockeroth ( 1980 ) associated males to the holotype by matching wing venation and proximity of collecting locality , but described the genus without illustrating the male genitalia , which are diagnostic for species .
since it was thought that only one species was present in north america , and this species was weakly characterized , acomoptera collected in the region were typically assumed to be acomoptera plexipus .
in fact , the nearctic supports an impressive diversity of acomoptera .
recent studies in california and elsewhere in north america revealed a number of undescribed species that show a surprising degree of morphological variation , particularly in the male genitalia .
these novel forms have implications for the concept of the genus and the clade including its putative sister - groups .
this may in turn , also impact our understanding of the evolution and composition of two large subfamilies of mycetophilidae , the gnoristinae and sciophilinae .
here , an additional six new species are described , raising the number of north american acomoptera species to seven .
these new species are compared with acomoptera plexipus ( garrett ) , whose diagnostic features are imaged and illustrated .
the european species , acomoptera difficilis is also illustrated and compared .
a key to species of the genus is included and apparent phylogenetic affiliations between congeners are briefly discussed .
materials and methods terminology for wing venation generally follows mcalpine ( 1981 ) , however interpretation of radial veins consistent with soli ( 1997 ) .
terminology for thoracic and genitalic morphology largely follows wood ( 1991 ) , mcalpine ( 1981 ) , and vockeroth ( 1981 ) .
terminology of thoracic sclerites and wing veins is standardized in figs 7 and 8 , respectively .
whole specimens and genitalia were macerated in 10 % koh at approx. 95degreesc for 15 - 20 minutes to remove soft tissue , then rinsed in distilled water and dilute glacial acetic acid , and dissected in water .
all genitalia preparations were placed in a drop of dmhf and dry mounted onto a small card with transparent backing , held to the pin beneath the specimen .
illustrations and plates were made using adobe illustrator and adobe photoshop creative suite software , aided by digital images taken using a q - imaging micropublisher 5.0 scope - mounted digital camera .
habitus images were taken with the same digital camera , using an led dome lighting system ( kerr et al. 2008 ) .
material examined includes holdings deposited in the california state collection of arthropods , sacramento , california , usa ( csca ) ; canadian national collection ( cnc ) ; california academy of sciences , san francisco , california , usa ( casc ) ; and the private collection of olavi kurina ( tartu , estonia ) .
paratypes are also deposited in 100 % etoh in the frozen tissue collection of the csca ( csca - ftc ) at - 80degreesc for dna preservation .

the crude illustrations in the original publication show this species having genitalia that are significantly different from known acomoptera and the description lacks critical additional information .
for this reason , the proper generic placement of this species has not been confirmed .

[ 48.66degreesn , 19.49degreese ] .
drepanocercus was originally defined on the basis of having the cubital fork very near the base of the wing and elongated female cerci ( vockeroth , 1980 ) .
acomoptera spinistyla shows neither of these features and in its original placement , prevents a clear distinction between drepanocercus and acomoptera .
the spiky gonostyli of drepanocercus spinistylus recall similar conditions found in acomoptera species such as acomoptera digitata ( fig. 11d ) and acomoptera plexipus ( fig. 23d ) .
furthermore , in acomoptera spinistyla and acomoptera plexipus , there is a bifurcate dorsomedial process ( soli , 1993 : fig. 2d , fig. 23a ) and a broad gap before the posterior margin of the hypandrium ( soli , 1993 : fig. 2b , fig. 23b ) .
for these reasons , it seems appropriate that this species be transferred to acomoptera .
further study is needed to evaluate the position of drepanocercus ensifer ; for now , it remains separated from acomoptera by its original defining characters .

the species is named after j.r. vockeroth , a remarkably friendly and engaging person , legendary figure in the history of dipterology , author of the genus , and frequent collector of this species .
discussion hypotheses of relationship among acomoptera species were not explicitly tested , however shared features of the male genitalia suggest self - evident affiliations .
the shared presence of a well - developed dorsomedial gonocoxal comb is an important feature for uniting acomoptera crispa , acomoptera echinosa , acomoptera nelsoni , and acomoptera vockerothi ( figs 2a , 11a , 19a , 25a ) .
all of these species are described for the first time here , and represent a newly - recognized lineage within the genus .
within this group , acomoptera crispa and acomoptera vockerothi exhibit exceptionally similar morphologies of the gonostylus .
overlap in gonostylus form also suggests a close relationship between acomoptera echinosa and acomoptera nelsoni .
a second group appears composed of acomoptera forculata , acomoptera plexipus , and the european species , acomoptera difficilis .
these species have a hypandrial lobe in the form of an apical hook or fork and a three - part gonostylus bearing a marginal lobe , whose similarity is especially noticeable when viewed from the lateral perspective ( figs 5e , 17e , 23e ) .
within this group , the dorsomedial structure of the gonocoxites in acomoptera difficilis and acomoptera forculata is developed in much the same way ( figs 5a , 17a ) , suggestinga close relationship between these taxa .
the position of acomoptera digitata remains unclear .
in light of this newly expanded acomoptera concept , boundaries of sister taxa may be revisited , particularly those of drepanocercus .
chandler ( 1999 ) asserted that acomoptera spinistyla is an intermediate between the type species of drepanocercus ( drepanocercus ensifer ( garrett 1925 )) and acomoptera , based on the intermediate position of the cubital fork .
the position of this fork is obscured in some specimens due to the base of cua1 either being weak or obsolete ( e.g. , soli 1993 : fig. 1 ) , as it is in drepanocercus ensifer ( e.g. , vockeroth 1980 : fig. 6 ) .
sevcik ( 2004 ) notes , however , that there is variation in this character in acomoptera spinistyla and frequently , specimens have cua1 complete , with a clear attachment point to cua2 .
in such specimens , the fork is approximately at the level of sc - r , just proximad of r - m ( sevcik 2004 : fig. 1 ) .
the phylogenetic significance of the position of the cubital fork remains unknown in this and other mycetophilid groups , such as in tetragoneura winnertzand its relatives .
for now , however , drepanocercus remains defined on the basis of having the cubital fork very near the base of the wing and elongated female cerci ( vockeroth 1980 ) .
given the expanded morphological diversity now known to exist within acomoptera , the generic relationships may be addressed in a more comprehensive manner , particularly with respect to paratinia and drepanocercus , and their relation to established members of gnoristinae and sciophilinae .
this will be the topic of future phylogenetic study .

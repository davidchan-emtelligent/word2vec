1. introduction the mixture of ultrafine nanometer sized particles and a convectional heat transfer base fluid is known as nanofluid .
these nanometer sized particles have different physical and chemical characteristics .
such particles have thermal conductivities remarkably higher than base liquids .
the prime use of nanofluids is for thermal conductivity improvement .
nanofluids are significant in various applications including paper and printing , paints and coatings , power generation , drug delivery , cancer therapy , ceramics and food products etc .
further magneto nanofluids are quite prevalent in mhd pumps and accelerators , hyperthermia , cancer tumor treatment , sink float separation , wound treatment and several others .
choi and eastman [ 1 ] proposed the word nanofluid .
they concluded that insertion of metallic nanoparticles in the ordinary fluids can dramatically enhance the thermal conductivities and improve the heat transfer performance of these fluids .
a model for convective transport in nanofluids was presented by buongiorno [ 2 ] .
he pointed out that brownian diffusion and thermophoresis are the most important slip mechanisms .
boundary layer flow of nanofluid induced by a linear stretching surface was discussed by khan and pop [ 3 ] .
turkyilmazoglu and pop [ 4 ] examined unsteady natural convection flow of nanofluids by a vertical flat plate with radiation .
double stratification effect in boundary - layer flow of nanofluid by a vertical plate is reported by ibrahim and makinde [ 5 ] .
further relevant studies involving nanofluids can be seen through the investigations [ 6 - 25 ] and various studies therein .
the study of boundary layer flow caused by a stretchable surface is relevant in numerous industrial and engineering utilizations .
such applications include drawing of copper wires , condensation process , die forging and extrusion of polymer in melt spinning , polymer extrusion , continuous stretching of plastic films , metal extrusion , paper production and fiber production etc .
it is noted that stretching of surface is not linear in all the cases .
the stretching surface may be nonlinear .
gupta and gupta [ 26 ] declared that the stretching of surface is not linear in plastic process .
vajravelu [ 27 ] addressed two - dimensional flow of viscous fluid over a nonlinear stretching surface .
here power law surface velocity distribution uw ( x ) = cxn is considered .
cortell [ 28 ] analyzed heat transfer in the flow past a nonlinear stretching surface .
here two different thermal boundary conditions on the surface namely constant surface temperature and prescribed surface temperature are employed .
the boundary layer flow of viscous fluid induced by a nonlinear stretching surface with thermal radiation and viscous dissipation effects is addressed by cortell [ 29 ] .
hydromagnetic flow generated by a nonlinear stretching surface through modified adomian decomposition method and pade approximation technique is demonstrated by hayat et al .
[ 30 ] .
rana and bhargava [ 31 ] studied flow of nanofluid over a nonlinear stretching surface with heat transfer .

[ 35 ] .
recently the non - newtonian fluids have gained much attention due to their extensive industrial and engineering applications .
these applications involve bioengineering and polymeric liquids , plastics manufacturing , food processing , petroleum production , annealing and thinning of copper wires , drawing of stretching sheet through quiescent fluid , aerodynamic extrusion of plastic films etc .
the navier - stokes equations are not appropriate to characterize the flow of non - newtonian fluids .
a single relation is not sufficient to predict the characteristics of all the non - newtonian materials .
therefore different types of relations are given in the literature .
the fluid model under discussion is called jeffrey material [ 36 - 41 ] .
this model is linear viscoelastic fluid which exhibits the effects of ratio of relaxation to retardation times and retardation time .
the jeffrey fluid is a relatively simpler linear model considering time derivatives while in non - newtonian fluid mechanics convective derivatives are assumed .
further the analysis of liquid - liquid two - phase flows are widely encountered in several industrial processes such as spray processes , lubrication , natural gas networks , nuclear reactor cooling etc .
thus gao et al .
[ 42 ] provided a multivariate weighted complex network analysis to characterize the nonlinear dynamic behavior in two - phase flow .
gao et al .
[ 43 ] also addressed the multi - frequency complex network to uncover oil - water flows .
slug to churn flow transition with multivariate pseudo wigner distribution and multivariate multiscale entropy is reported by gao et al .
[ 44 ] .
recently gao et al .
[ 45 ] provided a four - sector conductance method to explore the low - velocity oil - water two - phase flows .
present communication explores magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) boundary - layer flow of jeffrey nanofluid over a nonlinear stretching surface .
jeffrey fluid is assumed to be electrically conducting .
we considered the simultaneous effects of heat and mass transfer in the presence of brownian motion , thermophoresis and heat generation / absorption .
thermal convective [ 46 , 47 ] and zero nanoparticles mass flux [ 48 , 49 ] conditions are imposed at the stretching surface .
these conditions are studied rarely and more realistic physically .
to the best of our knowledge , no such consideration for the flow of jeffrey nanofluid is made yet .
small magnetic reynolds number and boundary layer are used in mathematical modelling .
the governing nonlinear ordinary differential equations are solved by homotopy analysis method ( ham ) [ 50 - 60 ] .
this technique for the solutions development has advantages through three directions i.e. , ( i ) it is independent of small / large physical parameters .
( ii ) it provides a simple way to ensure the convergence of series solutions .
( iii ) it provides freedom to choose the base functions and related auxiliary linear operators .
temperature and concentration profiles are examined via plots .
the local nusselt number is computed numerically and analyzed .
2. statement two - dimensional ( 2d ) flow of jeffrey nanofluid induced by a surface stretching with nonlinear velocity is considered .
non - uniform magnetic field of strength b0 acts in the y - direction .
small magnetic reynolds number justifies the absence of induced magnetic field .
non - uniform heat generation / absorption effect is considered .
brownian motion and thermophoresis are present .
the x - and y - axes are along and transverse to the surface respectively .
the stretching velocity is uw ( x ) = axn ( a , n > 0 ) .
the surface temperature is regulated by a convective heating process which is described by heat transfer coefficient hf and temperature of hot fluid tf under the surface .
resulting boundary layer problems are dudx + dvdy = 0 , ( 1 ) ududx + vdudy = nu1 + lambda1 ( d2udy2 + lambda2 ( ud3udxdy2 - dudxd2udy2 + dudyd2udxdy + vd3udy3 )) - sigmab2 ( x ) rhofu , ( 2 ) udtdx + vdtdy = alphad2tdy2 +( rhoc ) p ( rhoc ) f ( db ( dtdydcdy )+ dttinfinity ( dtdy ) 2 )+ q ( x )( rhoc ) f ( t - tinfinity ) , ( 3 ) udcdx + vdcdy = db ( d2cdy2 )+ dttinfinity ( d2tdy2 ) , ( 4 ) u = uw ( x )= axn , v = 0 , - kdtdy = hf ( tf - t ) , dbdcdy + dttinfinitydtdy = 0 at y = 0 , ( 5 ) u - - > 0 , t - - > tinfinity , c - - > cinfinity as y - - > infinity .
( 6 ) note that u and v depict the flow velocities in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively while v (= mu / rhof ) , mu and rhof show the kinematic viscosity , dynamic viscosity and density of base liquid respectively .
the ratio of relaxation to retardation times and the retardation time are represented by lambda1 and lambda2 .
here sigma represents the electrical conductivity , b ( x )= b0xn - 12 the non - uniform magnetic field , t the temperature , alpha = k / ( rhoc ) f , k , ( rhoc ) f and ( rhoc ) p the thermal diffusivity , thermal conductivity , heat capacity of liquid and effective heat capacity of nanoparticles respectively , q ( x ) = q0xn - 1 the non - uniform heat generation / absorption coefficient , db the brownian diffusivity , c the concentration , dt the thermophoretic diffusion coefficient , a the positive constant and tinfinity and cinfinity the ambient fluid temperature and concentration respectively .
putting u = axnf '( zeta ) , v = - ( anu ( n + 1 ) 2 ) 1 / 2 ( x ) n - 12 { f ( zeta )+ n - 1n + 1zetaf '( zeta )} , theta ( zeta )= t - tinfinitytf - tinfinity , phi ( zeta )= c - cinfinitycinfinity , zeta =( a ( n + 1 ) 2nu ) 1 / 2 ( x ) n - 12y ,} ( 7 ) eq ( 1 ) is trivially satisfied while eqs ( 2 ) - ( 6 ) are reduced to f '''+ beta1 (( 3n - 12 ) ( f '') 2 - ( n + 12 ) ff ''''+( n - 1 ) ff ''') +( 1 + lambda1 ) ( ff '' - ( 2nn + 1 )( f ') 2 - ( 2n + 1 )( ha ) 2f ')= 0 , ( 8 ) theta ''+ pr ( ftheta '+ nbtheta'phi '+ nttheta'2 +( 2n + 1 ) s1theta )= 0 , ( 9 ) phi "+ leprfphi '+ ntnbtheta ''= 0 , ( 10 ) f = 0 , f '= 1 , theta '= - gamma ( 1 - theta ( 0 )) , nbphi '+ nttheta '= 0 at zeta = 0 , ( 11 ) f ' - - > 0 , theta - - > 0 , phi - - > 0 when zeta - - > infinity .
( 12 ) here beta1 denotes local deborah number , ha hartman number , gamma biot number , s1 heat generation / absorption parameter , pr prandtl number , nb brownian motion parameter , nt thermophoresis parameter and le lewis number .
the definitions of these parameters are beta1 = lambda2axn - 1 , ( ha ) 2 = sigmab02arhof , gamma = hfknua , s1 = q0a ( rhoc ) fnb =( rhoc ) pdbcinfinity ( rhoc ) fnu , nt =( rhoc ) pdt ( tf - tinfinity )( rhoc ) fnutinfinity , le = alphadb , pr = nualpha. } ( 13 ) local nusselt number is given by rex - 1 / 2nux = - ( n + 12 ) 1 / 2theta '( 0 ) .
( 14 ) the non - dimensional local sherwood number is identically zero and rex = uwx / v represents the local reynolds number .
3. solutions by ham the appropriate initial approximations and auxiliary linear operators for approximate series solutions by homotopy analysis method ( ham ) are f0 ( zeta )= 1 - e - zeta , theta0 ( zeta )= gamma1 + gammae - zeta , phi0 ( zeta )= - gamma1 + gammantnbe - zeta , ( 15 ) lf = d3fdzeta3 - dfdzeta , ltheta = d2thetadzeta2 - theta , lphi = d2phidzeta2 - phi , ( 16 ) subject to lf [ b1 *+ b2 * ezeta + b3 * e - zeta ]= 0 , ltheta [ b4 * ezeta + b5 * e - zeta ]= 0 , lphi [ b6 * ezeta + b7 * e - zeta ]= 0 , ( 17 ) where bj * ( j = 1 - 7 ) denote the arbitrary constants .
deformation problems at zeroth - order are ( 1 - th ) lf [ f ( zeta , th ) - f0 ( zeta )]= thhfnf [ f ( zeta , th )] , ( 18 ) ( 1 - th ) ltheta [ theta ( zeta , th ) - theta0 ( zeta )]= thhthetantheta [ f ( zeta , th ) , theta ( zeta , th ) , phi ( zeta , th )] , ( 19 ) ( 1 - th ) lphi [ phi ( zeta , th ) - phi0 ( zeta )]= thhphinphi [ f ( zeta , th ) , theta ( zeta , th ) , phi ( zeta , th )] , ( 20 ) f ( 0 , th )= 0 , f '( 0 , th )= 1 , f '( infinity , th )= 0 , theta '( 0 , th )= - gamma ( 1 - theta ( 0 , th )) , theta ( infinity , th )= 0 , nbphi '( 0 , th )+ nttheta '( 0 , th )= 0 , phi ( infinity , th )= 0 , ( 21 ) nf [ f ( zeta ; th )]= d3fdzeta3 + beta1 (( 3n - 12 ) ( d2fdzeta2 ) 2 - ( n + 12 ) fd4fdzeta4 +( n - 1 ) fd3fdzeta3 ) +( 1 + lambda1 ) ( fd2fdzeta2 - ( 2nn + 1 ) ( dfdzeta ) 2 - ( 2n + 1 )( ha ) 2dfdzeta ) , ( 22 ) ntheta [ f ( zeta ; th ) , theta ( zeta , th ) , phi ( zeta , th )]= 1prd2thetadzeta2 + fdthetadzeta + nbdthetadzetadthetadzeta + nt ( dthetadzeta ) 2 +( 2n + 1 ) s1theta , ( 23 ) nphi [ f ( zeta ; th ) , theta ( zeta , th ) , phi ( zeta , th )]= d2phidzeta2 + leprfdphidzeta + ntnbd2thetadzeta2 .
( 24 ) here th in [ 0,1 ] represents the embedding parameter , hf , htheta and hphi the non - zero auxiliary parameters and nf , ntheta and nphi the nonlinear operators .
for th = 0 and th = 1 we have f ( zeta ; 0 )= f0 ( zeta ) , f ( zeta ; 1 )= f ( zeta ) , ( 25 ) theta ( zeta , 0 )= theta0 ( zeta ) , theta ( zeta , 1 )= theta ( zeta ) , ( 26 ) phi ( zeta , 0 )= phi0 ( zeta ) , phi ( zeta , 1 )= phi ( zeta ) .
( 27 ) when th changes from 0 to 1 then f ( zeta ; th ) , theta ( zeta,th ) and phi ( zeta,th ) vary from primary approximations f0 ( zeta ) , theta0 ( zeta ) and phi0 ( zeta ) to the desired solutions f ( zeta ) , theta ( zeta ) and phi ( zeta ) .
the following expressions by taylor 's series expansion can be written as f ( zeta ; th )= f0 ( zeta )+ summ ^= 1infinityfm ^( zeta ) thm ^ , fm ^( zeta )= 1m ^! dm ^ f ( zeta , th ) dthm ^| th = 0 , ( 28 ) theta ( zeta , th )= theta0 ( zeta )+ summ ^= 1infinitythetam ^( zeta ) thm ^ , thetam ^( zeta )= 1m ^! dm ^ theta ( zeta , th ) dthm ^| th = 0 , ( 29 ) phi ( zeta , th )= phi0 ( zeta )+ summ ^= 1infinityphim ^( zeta ) thm ^ , phim ^( zeta )= 1m ^! dm ^ phi ( zeta , th ) dthm ^| th = 0 .
( 30 ) the convergence of above series expressions strongly depends upon hf , htheta and hphi .
the values of hf , htheta and hphi are chosen so that eqs ( 28 ) - ( 30 ) converge at th = 1 then f ( zeta )= f0 ( zeta )+ summ ^= 1infinityfm ^( zeta ) , ( 31 ) theta ( zeta )= theta0 ( zeta )+ summ ^= 1infinitythetam ^( zeta ) , ( 32 ) phi ( zeta )= phi0 ( zeta )+ summ ^= 1infinityphim ^( zeta ) .
( 33 ) the m ^ th - order deformation problems can be expressed as follows : lf [ fm ^( zeta ) - chim ^ fm ^ - 1 ( zeta )]= hfr ~ fm ^( zeta ) , ( 34 ) ltheta [ thetam ^( zeta ) - chim ^ thetam ^ - 1 ( zeta )]= hthetar ~ thetam ^( zeta ) , ( 35 ) lphi [ phim ^( zeta ) - chim ^ phim ^ - 1 ( zeta )]= hphir ~ phim ^( zeta ) , ( 36 ) fm ^( 0 )= fm ^'( 0 )= fm ^'( infinity )= 0 , thetam ^'( 0 ) - gammathetam ^( 0 )= 0 , nbphim ^'( 0 )+ ntthetam ^'( 0 )= 0 , thetam ^( infinity )= phim ^( infinity )= 0 ,} ( 37 ) r ~ fm ^( zeta )= fm ^ - 1 '''+ beta1summ ^ - 1k = 0 (( 3n - 12 ) fm ^ - 1 - k '' fk '' - ( n + 12 ) fm ^ - 1 - kfk ''''+( n - 1 ) fm ^ - 1 - kfk ''') +( 1 + lambda1 ) summ ^ - 1k = 0 ( fm ^ - 1 - kfk '' - ( 2nn + 1 ) fm ^ - 1 - k'fk ') - ( 1 + lambda1 ) ( 2n + 1 )( ha ) 2fm ^ - 1 ' , ( 38 ) r ~ thetam ^( zeta )= 1prthetam ^ - 1 ''+ sumk = 0m ^ - 1fm ^ - 1 - kthetak '+ nbsumk = 0m ^ - 1thetam ^ - 1 - k'phik '+ ntsumk = 0m ^ - 1thetam ^ - 1 - k'thetak '+( 2n + 1 ) s1thetam ^ - 1 , ( 39 ) r ~ phim ^( zeta )= phim ^ - 1 ''+ leprsumk = 0m ^ - 1 ( fm ^ - 1 - kphik ')+ ntnbthetam ^ - 1 '' , ( 40 ) chim ^={ 0 , m ^<= 1,1 , m ^> 1 .
( 41 ) general expressions of ( fm ^ , thetam ^ , phim ^) through special solutions ( fm ^* , thetam ^* , phim ^*) are presented by the following expressions : fm ^( zeta )= fm ^*( zeta )+ b1 *+ b2 * ezeta + b3 * e - zeta , ( 42 ) thetam ^( zeta )= thetam ^*( zeta )+ b4 * ezeta + b5 * e - zeta , ( 43 ) phim ^( zeta )= phim ^*( zeta )+ b6 * ezeta + b7 * e - zeta , ( 44 ) in which the constants bj * ( j = 1 - 7 ) through the boundary condition ( 37 ) are given by b2 *= b4 *= b6 *= 0 , b3 *= dfm ^*( zeta ) dzeta | zeta = 0 , b1 *= - b3 * - fm ^*( 0 ) , ( 45 ) b5 *= 11 + gamma ( dthetam ^*( zeta ) dzeta | zeta = 0 - gammathetam ^*( 0 )) , ( 46 ) b7 *= dphim ^*( zeta ) dzeta | zeta = 0 + ntnb ( - b5 *+ dthetam ^*( zeta ) dzeta | zeta = 0 ) .

convergence analysis the expressions ( 31 ) - ( 33 ) contain hf , htheta and hphi .
obviously the convergence is accelerated by the auxiliary parameters hf , htheta and hphi for the series solutions .
for appropriate values of hf , htheta and hphi , the h - curves at 15th order of approximations are sketched .
it is apparent from fig 1 that the admissible ranges of hf , htheta and hphi are - 1.35 <= hf <= - 0.15 , - 1.50 <= htheta <= - 0.15 and - 1.60 <= hphi <= - 0.15 respectively .
the residual errors for velocity , temperature and concentration distributions are calculated through the following expressions : deltamf = integral01 [ r ~ m ^ f ( zeta,hf )] 2dzeta , ( 48 ) deltamtheta = integral01 [ r ~ m ^ theta ( zeta,htheta )] 2dzeta , ( 49 ) deltamphi = integral01 [ r ~ m ^ phi ( zeta,hphi )] 2dzeta .

to get the suitable range for h , the h - curves for the residual errors of velocity , temperature and concentration distributions are plotted in the figs 2 - 4 .
it is observed that the correct results up to fifth decimal place are obtained for values of h from this range .

discussion this portion organized the impacts of local deborah number beta1 , hartman number ha , brownian motion parameter nb , ratio of relaxation to retardation times lambda1 , biot number gamma , thermophoresis parameter nt , prandtl number pr , heat generation / absorption parameter s1 and lewis number le on the temperature theta ( zeta ) and concentration phi ( zeta ) .
fig 5 illustrates that how local deborah number beta1 affects the temperature distribution theta ( zeta ) .
it is analyzed that temperature theta ( zeta ) and related thermal layer thickness are decreased for larger local deborah number beta1 .
physically there exists a direct relationship between local deborah number beta1 and retardation time .
hence by increasing local deborah number beta1 , the retardation time is also enhanced .
such enhancement in retardation time corresponds to lower temperature distribution theta ( zeta ) and thinner thermal layer thickness .
influence of lambda1 on temperature distribution theta ( zeta ) is shown in fig 6 .
for larger lambda1 , the relaxation time increases and retardation time decays .
thus temperature distribution theta ( zeta ) and thermal layer thickness are increased .
fig 7 presents variation in temperature distribution theta ( zeta ) for hartman number ha. an increase in hartman number corresponds to more temperature theta ( zeta ) and thermal layer thickness .
as expected the magnetic field introduces the retarding body force that acts transverse to the direction of an applied magnetic field .
it retards the fluid motion and as a result the temperature distribution theta ( zeta ) enhances .
this body force is known as lorentz force .
fig 8 presents the impact of biot number gamma on temperature theta ( zeta ) .
stronger convection is caused by increasing biot number gamma .
therefore the temperature theta ( zeta ) and thermal layer thickness are enhanced .
variation in temperature theta ( zeta ) due to heat generation / absorption parameter s1 is shown in fig 9 .
here s1 > 0 represents heat generation and s1 < 0 yields heat absorption .
temperature profile and related thermal layer thickness have increasing behavior for heat generation but it is not the case for heat absorption .
fig 10 demonstrates the variation of temperature theta ( zeta ) for prandtl number pr. it is observed that temperature theta ( zeta ) and thermal layer thickness are decreasing functions of pr. physically prandtl number pr is an integral part of thermal diffusivity .
thermal diffusivity is responsible for lower temperature theta ( zeta ) and thermal layer thickness .
higher values of prandtl number yields weaker thermal diffusivity which corresponds to lower temperature and less thickness of thermal layer .
fig 11 is drawn for impact of thermophoresis parameter nt on temperature theta ( zeta ) .
larger thermophoresis parameter nt lead to higher temperature and more thermal layer thickness .
actually an enhancement in nt yields a stronger thermophoretic force which allows deeper migration of nanoparticles in the fluid .
far away from the surface there is higher temperature field and more thickness of thermal layer .
fig 12 is sketched to examine concentration field phi ( zeta ) for local deborah number beta1 .
here concentration field is weaker for larger values of beta1 .
concentration field phi ( zeta ) enhances when lambda1 increases ( see fig 13 ) .
fig 14 shows impact of hartman number ha on concentration phi ( zeta ) .
the concentration phi ( zeta ) and associated layer thickness are enhanced for larger hartman number. from fig 15 we observed that an increase in biot number gamma yields an enhancement in concentration profile phi ( zeta ) and its related boundary layer thickness .
larger lewis number le indicate decay in the concentration field phi ( zeta ) ( see fig 16 ) .
physically lewis number is based on brownian diffusivity .
an increase in lewis number le yields weaker brownian diffusivity .
such weaker brownian diffusivity corresponds to lower concentration field phi ( zeta ) .
fig 17 addresses variation of prandtl number pr on concentration phi ( zeta ) .
the concentration phi ( zeta ) and associated thickness of boundary layer are decreased for higher prandtl number pr. from fig 18 it is clearly examined that a weaker concentration profile phi ( zeta ) is generated by higher brownian motion parameter nb. fig 19 shows that the larger thermophoresis parameter nt yields a higher concentration profile phi ( zeta ) .
table 2 is calculated for numerical computations of local nusselt number rex - 1 / 2nux via beta1 , lambda1 , ha , gamma , s1 , nt , nb , le and pr when n = 1.5 .
here we noticed that the local nusselt number has higher values for larger prandtl number pr while opposite trend is noticed for lewis number le. it is also observed that lambda1 , s1 and ha yield lower local nusselt number .
the local deborah number beta1 shows opposite behavior for local nusselt number when compared with aforementioned parameters .

bacterial biofilm has been reported to be associated with more than 80 % of bacterial infections .
curcumin , a hydrophobic polyphenol compound , has anti - quorum sensing activity apart from having antimicrobial action .
however , its use is limited by its poor aqueous solubility and rapid degradation .
in this study , we attempted to prepare quantum dots of the drug curcumin in order to achieve enhanced solubility and stability and investigated for its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity .
we utilized a newer two - step bottom up wet milling approach to prepare curcumin quantum dots ( curqds ) using acetone as a primary solvent .
minimum inhibitory concentration against select gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria was performed .
the antibiofilm assay was performed at first using 96 - well tissue culture plate and subsequently validated by confocal laser scanning microscopy .
further , biofilm matrix protein was isolated using formaldehyde sludge and tca / acetone precipitation method .
protein extracted was incubated with varying concentration of curqds for 4 h and was subjected to sds - page .
molecular docking study was performed to observe interaction between curcumin and phenol soluble modulins as well as curli proteins .
the biophysical evidences obtained from tem , sem , uv - vis , fluorescence , raman spectroscopy , and zeta potential analysis confirmed the formation of curcumin quantum dots with increased stability and solubility .
the mics of curcumin quantum dots , as observed against both select gram positive and negative bacterial isolates , was observed to be significantly lower than native curcumin particles .
on tcp assay , curcumin observed to be having antibiofilm as well as biofilm degrading activity .
results of sds - page and molecular docking have shown interaction between biofilm matrix proteins and curcumin .
the results indicate that aqueous solubility and stability of curcumin can be achieved by preparing its quantum dots .
the study also demonstrates that by sizing down the particle size has not only enhanced its antimicrobial properties but it has also shown its antibiofilm activities .
further , study is needed to elucidate the exact nature of interaction between curcumin and biofilm matrix proteins .

it further enables them to disperse and colonize newer niches as per their need ( jefferson , 2004 ) .
further , chronic infections are accompanied by the formation of biofilms .
therefore , biofilms can be considered as special mode of persistent bacterial infection .
in recent past , extensive works on understanding the socialized behavior of bacteria has led to unprecedented increase in investigations of natural and synthetic chemicals having antibiofilm activities ( kalia , 2013 ; cascioferro , 2014 ) .
chemically , curcumin [( e,e ) - 1,7 - bis ( 4 - hydroxy - 3 - methoxy - phenyl ) - 1,6 - heptadiene - 3,5 - dione ] is a bis - alpha,beta - unsaturated beta - diketone ( commonly called diferuloylmethane ) and is an active ingredient of curcuma longa rhizome ( priyadarsini , 2009 ) .
although , traditionally c. longa powder is being used as anti - infective agent for centuries particularly in southeast asian countries but the mechanism of its antimicrobial activity is largely unknown ( rai et al. , 2008 ; esatbeyoglu et al. , 2012 ; heger et al. , 2014 ; packiavathy et al. , 2014 ; priyadarsini , 2014 ) .
curcumin seems to be of utmost significance because of its vast spectrum of therapeutic activities ( park et al. , 2005 ; priyadarsini , 2014 ) .
studies are available pertaining to the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic ) values of curcumin apart from documentation of its anti - quorum sensing and anti - efflux pump activities ( bhawana et al. , 2011 ; mun et al. , 2013 ; ali et al. , 2014 ; packiavathy et al. , 2014 ; zorofchian moghadamtousi et al. , 2014 ; pandit et al. , 2015 ; tyagi et al. , 2015 ) .
while determining the mic of curcumin against different bacterial isolates we faced difficulty in determining and interpreting the results possibly due to its insolubility in aqueous phase leading to formation of colored precipitate .
attempts have been made to increase its aqueous solubility utilizing nanoparticle - based drug delivery approach using colloidal carriers such as bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) , and chitosan , or even complexed with phospholipids and cyclodextrin ( barik et al. , 2003 ; bisht et al. , 2007 ; feng et al. , 2012 ; sindhu et al. , 2014 ; krausz et al. , 2015 ; liu et al. , 2015 ) .
although these colloidal nano - carriers are claimed to be biocompatible but the toxicity issues pose serious questions for its use ( bhawana et al. , 2011 ) .
therefore , as a drug , its use is limited largely due to high hydrophobicity and rapid degradation ( wang et al. , 1997 ; jagannathan et al. , 2012 ; priyadarsini , 2014 ) .
curcumin is susceptible to chemical degradation in simple aqueous and aqueous - organic solutions with increase in basicity ( wang et al. , 1997 ) .
basicity based degradation is due to hydrolysis of alpha,beta - unsaturated beta - diketo moiety .
it also degrades on exposure to sunlight .
reports say that up to 90 % of curcumin degrades in 30 min .
in the present work , we put forth a method for the preparation of curcumin quantum dots ( curqds ) employing two step " concerted " wet milling technique .
the curqds were studied for various characteristics including its solubility and stability over a period of 6 months .
further , we also evaluated its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities .
we further attempted to elucidate the possible mechanism of its antibiofilm activity .
materials and methods synthesis of curcumin quantum dots we used two steps " concerted " top down method for curqds preparation utilizing a mixed type of mechanical and ultrasonic milling .
0.6 g of curcumin ( sigma - aldrich , united states ) and 60 g of zirconia beads ( 0.1 mm in diameter ) ( ytz - 0.1 - nikkato co. , ltd. , osaka , japan ) were weighed in a 50 ml conical tube ( tarsons , india ) , containing 15 ml milliq water and oscillated at 2700 rpm for 15 min .
the drug loading was increased up to 2.4 g. after milling , the resultant nano - suspension of the drug was aspirated out and was dried by rotary evaporator at 60degreesc and nano - curcumin was collected. from thus collected nano - curcumin , the stock solution of curcumin ( 5 mg / ml ) was prepared by dissolving 50 mg curcumin powder in 10 ml acetone ( merck , germany ) .
the stock solution was added to hot water ( 40 ml ) at 70 +/ - 5degreesc in drop - wise manner ( 0.2 ml / min ) under continuous ultra - sonication for about 45 min with power input of 750 w , frequency 20 khz , and intensity 30 w / cm2 .
the ultra - sonication was carried out in pulsed mode with pulse ratio on / off 50 / 10 ( s / s ) by maintaining temperature of 20degreesc by putting it on ice .
then , 25 ml of the total solution thus obtained was utilized for second round sonication , i.e. , it was further subjected to drop - wise addition in 25 ml of boiling water under sonication conditions as utilized in 1st round .
after four batches kept under agitation , 200 ml obtained was concentrated to 20 ml in rotary evaporator at 60degreesc under vacuum ( 550 mmhg ) so as to obtain concentration of 2.5 mg / ml curqds solution .
to maintain the ph at neutrality , trisodium citrate ( sigma - aldrich , united states ) was added .
characterization of curqds transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) analysis was useful to determine the size and symmetry of synthesized curqds .
a drop of curqds solution was placed on the carbon - coated copper grids and kept in infrared light until sample gets dried .

the sample was excited by 532 nm solid state diode laser on the desired portion of the sample .
this set up contains grating as a dispersion element with 2400 grooves / mm and ~ 1 cm - 1 spectral resolution .
the power delivered by the laser source on the desired probe area of the sample was 0.1 mw during the measurement .
the acquisition time for each window was selected as 50 s. zeta potential measurement zeta potential measurements of synthesized curqds were carried on delsa nano ( beckman - coulter , united kingdom ) by using zeta dip cells .
the samples for analysis were prepared by mixing curqds in 10 mm nacl in 1:10 proportion .
for measuring zeta potential , 1000 mul of the sample was taken in clear disposable zeta cells .
zeta potential of synthesized curqds was analyzed to determine the charges present on the surface of curqds and its stability at ph 7.0 .
growth inhibition assays of curcumin / curqds minimum inhibitory concentration determination minimum inhibitory concentrations of curqds was determined against select gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria namely staphylococcus aureus ( atcc 29213 ) , methicillin resistant s. aureus ( mrsa , lab code : 699 / 2015 ) , enterococcus faecalis ( atcc 29212 ) , escherichia coli ( atcc 25922 ) , klebsiella pneumoniae ( lab code : 1686 / 2015 ) , and pseudomonas aeruginosa ( atcc 25619 ) by the micro - broth dilution as described earlier with minor modifications ( ling et al. , 2015 ) .
here , the clinical isolate of s. aureus which exhibited resistance to 30 mug cefoxitin disk ( zone diameter <= 19 mm ) was considered as mrsa ( clinical and laboratory standards institute , 2016 ) .
a stock solution ( 700 mug / ml ) of curqds was prepared as mentioned earlier .
the stock solution was serially diluted to give concentrations in the range of 2.734 - 700 mug / ml. for native curcumin , the stock solution was prepared by dissolving 0.70 mg of curcumin in 1 ml of dmso ( merck , germany ) and was diluted in a series of twofold dilutions ranging from 2.734 to 700 mug / ml in sterile muller hinton ( mh ) broth ( himedia laboratories , india ) in microtiter wells such that final concentration of dmso does n't exceed 5 % in any well .
each well was inoculated with 170 mul of standardized cell suspension ( 107 cfu / ml ) and incubated at 37degreesc overnight along with the diluted drug 30 mul per well such that effective concentration of the drug per well ranges from 0.082 to 21 mug in twofold dilutions .
the optical density ( od ) of bacterial suspension at 620 nm was determined using a microplate reader ( thermo labsystems , multiskan mk3 , finland ) .
the mic was defined as the lowest concentration of curcumin that restricted growth to <= 0.2 ( 40 % reduction in absorbance ) at 620 nm ( no visibly perceivable growth ) .
controls did not contain curqds but in case of native curcumin , the broth containing 5 % dmso was used as control and all experiments were performed in triplicate .
antibiofilm activity determination using tissue culture plate assay ( tcp ) the antibiofilm assay was performed in 96 - well tissue culture plate as described previously with minor modifications ( peeters et al. , 2008 ; wu et al. , 2014 ) .

a volume of 90 mul of each diluted bacterial suspension was dispensed into flat - bottom polystyrene 96 - well tissue culture plate ( nunc , denmark ) and 10 mul of curqds solution was added to reach final concentrations ranging from 1.17 to 25 mug / ml including 2.5 mug / ml. wells without curqds were set up as positive controls .
plates were incubated at 37degreesc without shaking for 24 h in one case where its biofilm inhibitory actions were investigated while , action on preformed biofilms were investigated after 48 h of incubation .
after incubation , biofilm was quantitated by crystal violet ( cv ) assay ( merck , germany ) as described earlier ( stepanovic et al. , 2000 ) .
the assays were performed in triplicate , and the results expressed as mean od590 +/ - the standard error of the mean ( sem ) .
the reduction in biofilm biomass compared to the control biofilms incubated without curqds , was calculated according to the proposed formula : % reduction =( od590 control - od590 sample ) od590 controlx100 confocal laser scanning microscopic imaging of biofilms for direct observation of the effect of the drug on the dynamics of biofilm formation , confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed on bacterial biofilms of select organisms namely , s. aureus ( atcc 29213 ) , s. epidermidis ( atcc 35984 ) , and e. coli ( atcc 25922 ) with and without adding curqds as per need , on poly - l - lysine coated 8 - well cell chambered slides ( nunc , denmark ) as described earlier with minor modifications ( pitts et al. , 2003 ; schlafer and meyer , 2016 ) .
briefly , biofilms were formed in the presence of serially double - diluted concentrations of curqds at 37degreesc for 48 h. bhi - broth without the drug served as negative control .
the biofilms were incubated with 6.6 mum concentration of dapi ( invitrogen , united states ) for 30 min in dark and were analyzed by carl zeiss confocal systems .

other prominent raman bands of ring also do not change .
the benzene rings on the both sides of the skeletal in curcumin molecule remain intact as expected after quantum dot formation .
at ~ 1755 cm - 1 a new broad band appears in curqds .
this is due to upsilon ( c = o ) band .
it has been reported that the upsilon ( c = o ) band does not appear in the enol form but it appears in the diketo form .
raman bands of curcumin and curqds were found at similar positions excepting for the absence of band specific for enol form in curqds ( figure 14 ) .

further , it was interesting to note that the inhibition of biofilm formation by mrsa was significantly reduced in presence of curqds in comparison to methicillin sensitive s. aureus ( atcc 29213 ) even at a concentration as low as 0.0156 mug / ml ( table 3 ) .
confocal imaging of biofilms before observing the biofilm inhibitory effect of curcumin , we optimized the confocal imaging of s. aureus ( atcc 29213 ) biofilm after 72 h of incubation ( figure 6 ) .

note the stable association of the drug molecule with the bacterium , which suggests its affinity for the organism .
strong co - localization of the dapi ( red ) with the drug ( green ) supports this affinity .

confocal microscopic validation of antibiofilm effects of curqds the effects of curqds on biofilms of s. epidermidis ( atcc 35984 ) , s. aureus ( atcc 29213 ) , and e. coli ( atcc 25922 ) strains were assessed by confocal microscopy following staining of 72 h old biofilms with the blue fluorescent dye dapi ( here given a dummy red color ) ( figure 9 ) .
in agreement with the data obtained by phenotypic characterization by tcp assay , biofilms of the atcc 35984 , 29213 , and 25922 strains showed an intense dapi staining , indicating the presence of a marked amount of the bacteria / bacterial extracellular dna ( figure 9 ) .
seventy - two hours old biofilms of s. epidermidis ( atcc35984 ) , s. aureus ( atcc 29213 ) ( t1 ) , and e. coli ( atcc 25922 ) strains imaged after addition of curqds displayed clear biofilm matrix disintegration at concentration 0.125 mug / ml. this was evident by the observed reduction in the intensity of fluorescence ( red here ) a ' , b ' , and c ' , respectively .

note the diffusion and disintegration of the superficial biofilm at concentration 0.125 mug / ml. further , for observing the inhibitory effect of curcumin over bacterial biofilm , we incubated the bacterial suspension of s. aureus ( atcc 29213 ) and e. coli ( atcc 25922 ) in presence of different concentrations of curqds ranging from 0.0156 to 0.125 mug / ml in chambered slide at 37degreesc for 72 h. when we compared the biofilm biomass formed by s. aureus ( atcc 29213 ) ( control , figure 6a ) , significant inhibition of formation of biofilm biomass by s. aureus ( atcc 29213 ) and e. coli ( atcc 25922 ) was observed in presence of the drug even at concentration of 0.0156 mug / ml. it was noted that although , the biofilm architecture was well perceived on differential interference contrast ( dic ) contours as well as after application of dapi , but the superposed view of dapi over dic images ( figures 6a - a ') yielded better perception of biofilm texture .
the inhibitory effect of curqds on both these strains were substantial at this concentration and small cluster of biofilm biomass may be seen which were not able to aggregate to form bigger biomass ( figures 1a,d , 11a - d , 11e - h ') as compared with control in which well - developed biofilm biomass architecture may be observed ( figure 6 ) .
further , at concentration of 0.125 mug / ml the biofilm biomass was not perceivable indicating complete inhibition of biofilm .
however , complete biofilm matrix degradation at the concentration of 0.125 mug / ml was observed by disintegration of biofilm architecture as well as dispersal of its degraded biomass ( figure 10d "'). by moving down the lane from d - d "' we may observe the progressive loss of cohesion .
while performing the confocal microscopy of biofilm biomass in presence of dapi and increasing concentration of curqds , we found dapi to be localized in the biofilm architecture ( figures 10b - b "') .
subsequently , we searched for the localization of our drug exploiting its characteristic green fluorescence ( figures 10c - c "') .
further , on visualizing the superposed images of the same fields as observed earlier , we found an intermediary yellow fluorescence indicating the co - localization of dapi along with the drug in biofilm biomass .
dic microscopic imaging was performed on biofilm formed by s. aureus ( atcc 29213 ) at increasing concentration of curqds starting from 0.0156 , 0.0312 , 0.0625 , and 0.125 mug / ml in lane d to d "" , respectively ( figure 10 ) .
we observed complete biofilm matrix degradation at the concentration of 0.125 mug / ml , which is indicated by disintegration of biofilm architecture as well as dispersal of its degraded biomass ( figure 10d "'). by moving down the lane from d - d "' we may observe the progressive deterioration / loss of cohesion .
figure 10 confocal sections of bacterial culture of s. aureus ( atcc 29213 ) , treated with 0.0156 , 0.0312 , 0.0625 , and 0.125 mug / ml concentration ( present in lanes 4 - 1 , respectively ) of curqds for 24 h. cultures have been stained with dapi ( red ) , and green is the auto - fluorescent curqds .

figure 11 confocal sections of biofilm of s. aureus ( atcc 29213 ) ( a - d ) and e. coli ( atcc 25922 ) ( e - h ') incubated with increasing concentration of curqds for 72 h , representing the corresponding dynamics of bacterial association and biofilm matrix formation in the presence of drug ( resolution 40x ) .
in order to check the distribution of co - localization of dapi with curqds throughout the layers , we analyzed the different horizontal cross - sections of lane 1 a "' of figure 10 ( figure 7 ) .
panel ( a - e ) is showing the co - localization of curqds and dapi from bottom to top layer which was further magnified in second panel of images ( a ' - e ') for clear analysis .
here , it may be observed that these co - localized dapi - curqds complexes are more frequently distributed in the superficial layers of biofilm as evidenced by yellow fluorescence .
this may be indicative of peculiar phenomenon exhibited by curcumin , which might be simultaneously interacting with binding blocks of bacterial biofilm , i.e. , biofilm associated proteins and phenol soluble modulins ( leading to biofilm disintegration ) along with the oozed out nucleic acids of dead bacteria .
the said interpretation is being concluded because dapi binds to minor groove of dna but binding of curcumin to dna is not through intercalation of the phenyl rings but by hydrogen bonding interactions in at - rich regions .
thus , it can be presumed that curcumin is pulling dapi toward itself which ultimately brings dapi and curcumin together .
co - localized dapi - curqds complexes were found more frequently distributed in the superficial layers of biofilm as evidenced by yellow fluorescence .
to validate the co - localization phenomenon , we plotted the co - localization maps ( figure 8 ) .
stability of dapi - curqds complex was analyzed by making co - localization maps obtained from different ascending horizontal sections of figures 7b ' - e ' .
it is noticeable that the shift of yellow curve exhibit linearity to the corresponding shift in red and green filters indicating significant and stable co - localizations or interactions observed in the different layers of the biofilm .
protein isolation and sds - page analysis the concentration of protein obtained from the biofilm as estimated by lowry method was found to be 800 mug / ml. the sds - page documented the possible intercalation of drug with biofilm proteins as evidenced by retardation of protein bands ( supplementary figure s1 ) .
in silico studies the binding interactions of all the proteins with curcumin have shown strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions .
table 4 shows the docking scores and interaction partners of curcumin within the active sites of each protein .
the phenol soluble modulins was found to show higher binding affinity for curcumin than curli proteins ( figures 12 , 13 ) .

discussion bacterial biofilm has been associated with more than 80 % of infectious lesions ranging from skin infections like carbuncle , impetigo , and pyoderma , wound infection , to persistent tissue infections namely osteomyelitis , rhinosinusitis , recurrent urinary tract infection , endocarditis , and periodontitis ( romling and balsalobre , 2012 ) .
curcumin being the most active ingredient of c. longa has been explored for its various biological and medicinal properties ( rai et al. , 2008 ; hu et al. , 2013 ; carvalho et al. , 2015 ; kumari et al. , 2015 ; syed et al. , 2015 ) .
it has been suggested that curcumin inhibits bacterial cell division , by perturbing the cytokinetic z - ring through a direct interaction with ftsz .
( rai et al. , 2008 ) recently , it 's been reported to act on sortase a ( esatbeyoglu et al. , 2012 ; hu et al. , 2013 ; cascioferro et al. , 2014 ; packiavathy et al. , 2014 ) .
in this study , preparation of curqds and its effects are reported for the first time .
quantum dots are heterogeneous groups of nanoparticles with size range 2 - 6 nm and are unique in their physico - chemical properties due to the combination of innate material characteristics and dimensionality .
the dimensionality leads to " quantum confinement " which arises by sizing down any crystal to less than bohr radius ( jamieson et al. , 2007 ) .
since the energy levels for a photon are quantized and there exists a direct relationship between the qd size and energy therefore , size variations of qds leads to changes in their absorption spectra and correspondingly a shift can be seen in their emission wavelength to the blue or red spectral region .
this increases the probability of absorption at higher energies creating a broad band absorption spectrum ( klimov et al. , 2000 ) .
our pl and uv - v is profile is in consonance with the above said characteristics ( figure 2 ) .
the amorphous nature of curqds obtained in the present work can be inferred from the saed pattern ( figure 3 ) .
clearly the observed pl spectra are excitation wavelength dependent which may be due to the non - uniform size of the quantum dots or presence of the defects at the edges .
in this study , with dmso , in both the phases of our experiment , obvious precipitation was manifested while with dichloromethane , agglomeration took place just after 2 h of the preparation .
as acetone is miscible with water with low boiling temperature ( 56.05degreesc ) and density ( 0.7845 gcm - 3 ) , its rapid volatilization in presence of high energy sonication , resulted in sizing down of the drug to quantum dot level which ruled out the need of addition of stabilizers to prevent drug particle aggregation .
the tem imaging justified the definition of quantum dots .
zeta potential was found to be 25.61 mv providing indirect evidence for the potential stability of our colloidal system ( zhang et al. , 2008 ; sindhu et al. , 2014 ) .
polydispersity index ( pi ) of curqds was found to be around 0.172 indicating a narrow distribution of the particle sizes ( zhang et al. , 2008 ) .
the uv - v is spectra of curcumin has three bands observed at ~ 263 , 425 , and 512 nm with a broad absorption band at ~ 425 nm along with a shoulder at ~ 512 nm extending to visible region .
after the first phase of wet milling , the size of the particle ranged from 300 to 1020 nm with fibrillar appearances ( supplementary figure s2a ) .
the decision of executing second step was made based on the observation that some of the spherical particles of size range 1.15 - 7.0 nm were present amidst those of fibrillar particles ( supplementary figure s2b ) .
the number of collisions with beads might be predominant to pulverize the particles in the current experiment in the first phase while rapid solvent evaporation in the second phase reduces the size to quantum dots range , i.e. , <= 10 nm. aqueous dissolution of curcumin is due to acidic phenol hydrogen .
however , reports say that at neutral and alkaline ph , curcumin is not stable and degrades into compounds like vanillin , ferulic acid , ferulic aldehyde , feruloyl methane , etc .
( kumavat et al. , 2013 ; priyadarsini , 2014 ) .
however , utilizing raman spectroscopic analysis , we have n't observed any other peak for any of the degraded products even after keeping the drug in darker environment for 180 days ( figure 4 ) .
uniquely , various raman bands of curcumin and curqds were found at similar positions excepting for the absence of band specific for enol form in curqds .
in this study , we found curcumin stable in suspension for more than 6 months period .
addition of tri - sodium citrate shifts the equilibrium toward keto form leading to the enhanced aqueous solubility .
innate killing action of dmso and immediate precipitation of drug particularly at higher concentrations in bacterial culture medium ( bhi - broth ) , complicated the mic determination .
investigators have tried to prepare the nano - suspension of the drug for determination of mic .
but , due to heavy yellow precipitation , interpretation of mic , defined as the concentration where no visible growth is seen ( clinical and laboratory standards institute , 2016 ) , cannot be precisely documented .
this may be the reason as to why hu et al .
( 2013 ) modified the existing method of determination of mic for the said drug .
therefore , in the present study , a modified micro - broth dilution method for assessing the antimicrobial assay was utilized using elisa reader to observe the difference in absorbance value of the well containing bacterial inoculum and the drug vis a vis well containing only curcumin and well containing bacterial inoculum without drug .
in the present study , we focused upon the antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of curcumin against six different bacterial isolates and found curcumin equally effective against all the tested bacterial strains except p. aeruginosa , and the extent of killing was dose dependent .
we observed that the bactericidal effect was achieved at a concentration of 7.825 mug / ml against k. pneumoniae while 99.03 and 87.3 % inhibition against s. aureus ( atcc 29213 ) and e. coli ( atcc 25922 ) respectively , was observed at the same concentration .
varying mic values have been reported against different bacterial species .
bhawana et al .
( 2011 ) have reported mic against s. aureus ( atcc29213 ) , e. coli ( atcc 25922 ) , and p. aeruginosa ( atcc 25619 ) as 150 , 300 , and 250 mug / ml for native and 100 , 250 , and 200 mug / ml for nano - curcumin , respectively ( pandit et al. , 2015 ) .
however , mun et al .
( 2013 ) have reported mic of native curcumin as high as 250 mug / ml against s. aureus ( atcc 25923 ) .
some investigators have shown 80 % decrease in cfu of e. coli upon exposure to 100 mum ( 36.8 g / ml ) curcumin , 100 % inhibition of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa , and 80 % inhibition in case of enterococcus faecalis after the exposure of 200 mum ( 73.6 mug / ml ) of curcumin ( tyagi et al. , 2015 ) .
the antibacterial assay of aqueous solution of curqds in the present study exhibited 64 times better in vitro antimicrobial activity as compared to nano - curcumin ; and around 90 times antimicrobial activity as compared to native curcumin reported till date .
apart from this , a potential bactericidal effect was observed on inherently resistant bacteria enterococcus faecalis ( atcc 29212 ) and mrsa on a concentration as low as 15.65 mug / ml. the rationale behind the stronger activity and aqueous solubility of curqds might be related to the particle size reduction to 0.5 - 4.5 nm , which is much less than the size of native curcumin particles ( average size 2350 nm ) ( figures 2 , 3 ) and may be the reason for better penetration and interaction with the biofilm matrix and higher uptake by the cells .
in the present study , curqds was found to be a strong biofilm degrading agent and a potential inhibitor of biofilm biogenesis .
however , this study reveals that it acts more on the biofilm where protein content is high .
mrsa and e. coli biofilm is mainly protein rich with predominance of phenol soluble modulins and curli , respectively ( beloin and ghigo , 2005 ; depas and chapman , 2012 ; periasamy et al. , 2012 ; schwartz and boles , 2013 ; otto , 2014 ). p. aeruginosa biofilm is predominantly alginate and it was found to be almost resistant to the degradation even at concentration of 0.25 mug / ml ( only 39.55 % reduction in biomass ) ( ryder et al. , 2007 ; donot et al. , 2012 ) .
constitutionally , s. aureus biofilm is a mixed biofilm consisting of polysaccharide as well as proteins that are expressed differentially ( periasamy et al. , 2012 ) .
probably due to this heterogeneity , 44.87 % of reduction was observed when treated with curqds ( 0.25 mug / ml ) .
similarly , curqds was found to be effective in inhibiting the biofilm in dose dependent manner .
as a biofilm inhibitory agent also , it was found to be most effective against e. coli ( atcc 25922 ) ( table 3 ) .
this finding is well corroborated with confocal images ( figures 6 , 7 , 10 ) .
in order to check the binding interactions of the drug with psm 's present in s. aureus and curli present in e. coli biofilms of these isolates were harvested and their binding was documented by showing the retardation in the bands obtained on subjection to sds - page ( supplementary figure s1 ) .
the thermodynamic profile obtained after in silico evaluation of interaction of curcumin with psm 's and curli proteins , indicated large exothermic enthalpies ( - 7.06 to - 8.01 kcal / mol ) .
in this study , curcumin was found to adopt many different conformations suitable for maximizing hydrophobic contacts with the protein to which it is bound .
the study also demonstrated that the physicochemical properties of curqds have improved over the nanoparticle system reported till date , possibly because of reduction in particle size , formation of a high - energy amorphous state , and induction of intermolecular hydrogen bonding , which altogether enhanced its water solubility , stability and its antimicrobial properties .
the present work of in vitro synthesis of curqds may be seen as the beginning of quantum medicine in the field of antimicrobials .
conclusion the present study puts forth a newer greener concerted two step bottom up wet milling approach for the preparation of surfactant free water soluble and stable curqds with enhanced antimicrobial as well as antibiofilm activities .
however , further study is needed to elucidate the exact nature of interaction between curcumin and biofilm matrix proteins .
efforts are also needed to explore the applications of curqds in food and pharmacological formulations .

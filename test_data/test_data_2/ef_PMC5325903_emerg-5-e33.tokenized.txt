introduction : tube thoracostomy complications depend on the operator 's skill , patients' general condition and the place in which the procedure is done .
the present study aimed to compare the quality and complications of tube thoracostomy carried out by emergency medicine residents ( emrs ) and surgery residents ( srs ) .
methods : this cohort study was conducted on 18 - 60 years old trauma patients in need of tube thoracostomy presenting to two academic emergency departments .
quality of tube placement and its subsequent complications until tube removal were compared between srs and emrs using spss 20 .
results : 72 patients with the mean age of 37.1 +/ - 14.1 years were studied ( 86.1 % male ) .
23 ( 63.8 %) cases were complicated in srs and 22 ( 61.1 %) cases in emrs group ( total = 62.5 %) .
chest drain dislodgement ( 22.2 % in srs vs. 22.2 % emrs ; p > 0.99 ) , drainage failure ( 19.4 % in srs vs. 16.7 % emrs ; p = 0.50 ) , and surgical site infection ( 11.1 % in srs vs. 19.4 % emrs ; p = 0.25 ) were among the most common observed complications .
the overall odds ratio of complication development was 0.89 ( 95 % ci : 0.35 - 2.25 , p = 0.814 ) for srs and 1.12 ( 95 % ci : 0.28 - 4.53 , p = 0.867 ) for emrs .
conclusion : the findings of the present study showed no significant difference between srs and emrs regarding quality of tube thoracostomy placement and its subsequent complications for trauma patients .
the rate of complications were interestingly high (> 60 %) for both groups .
key words thoracostomy emergency medicine general surgery postoperative complications introduction tube thoracostomy is one of the most frequent life - saving interventions in management of trauma patients ( 1 - 3 ) .
the necessity of tube thoracostomy for traumatic chest injuries has been questioned due to high complication rate reported by some studies ( 4 , 5 ) .
tube thoracostomy has the potential to cause complications related to insertion , position and infection .
these complication rates and types may differ depending on various factors including those related to the patient and the physician ( 6 , 7 ) .
tube thoracostomy complications largely depend on the knowledge and skill of the operator in addition to the patients' general condition and the place in which the procedure is done ( 8 ) .
this procedure has traditionally been performed only by thoracic surgeons and surgery residents ( srs ) .
however , in recent years , tube thoracostomy has been performed by other specialties such as emergency medicine residents ( emrs ) ( 9 - 11 ) .
ball et al. estimated the prevalence of complications of thoracostomy to be about 13 % when done by srs and 40 % when done by emrs ( 12 ) .
in iranian emergency medicine curriculum , tube thoracostomy training should be provided for all emrs .
the present study aimed to compare the quality and complications of tube thoracostomy between emrs and srs of two academic emergency departments .
methods study design and setting the present cohort study was carried out on trauma patients presenting to the emergency departments of shoahadaye hafte - tir and imam hossein hospitals , tehran , iran , who underwent tube thoracostomy either by srs or emrs .
the protocol of the study was approved by the ethics committee of shahid beheshti university of medical sciences .
before entering the study , informed written consent was obtained from the patient or their relative .
throughout the study , researchers adhered to the principles of helsinki declaration .
participants study population consisted of 18 - 60 years old multiple trauma patients who had indication for tube thoracostomy according to the current advanced traumatic life supports ( atls ) protocol .
tube thoracostomy performed in pre - hospital settings or other centres , patients under 18 or over 60 years old , death for any reason other than those related to thoracostomy , and tube thoracostomy under close observation of attending were considered as exclusion criteria in this study .
sampling was performed using convenience method .
data gathering using a predesigned checklist , patients' demographic data ( age , sex ) , vital signs ( pulse rate , respiratory rate , blood pressure , o2 saturation ) , indication of tube thoracostomy ( pneumothorax , hemothorax , or hemopneumothorax ) , and quality of tube placement ( abutment to mediastinum , extending caudal from insertion site , and intra - fissure / intra - abdominal / trans - diaphragmatic placement ) , as well as complications ( chest drain dislodgement , haemorrhage and vascular injury , empyema and surgical site infection , air leak and subcutaneous emphysema , pulmonary laceration or puncture , and drainage failure ) were gathered by one observer resident in each hospital .
the observer resident did not interfere with the performed procedure in any stage and only filled out the prepared checklists .
the procedures had been performed by third level srs in imam hossein hospital and by third level emrs in hafte - tir hospital .
hafte - tir hospital ( south tehran ) accepts about 250 traumatic patients a day and third level emrs do all the procedures for trauma patients in emergency department but in imam hossein hospital all chest tubes are inserted by srs .
after tube thoracostomy , an anterior - posterior chest radiography was performed for all patients and was scored ( 0 - 5 based on likert scale ) regarding the quality of tube placement by two separate radiologists .
if any difference was seen in the two reports , a third radiologist was invited .
none of radiologists were informed about the patients group .
outcome the occurrence of one of the above - mentioned complications was considered as primary outcome and quality of tube placement as secondary outcome .
all patients were followed until tube thoracostomy removal .
statistical analysis based on the study by ball et al. the prevalence of complications after tube thoracostomy in srs and emrs groups were 13 % and 40 % , respectively ( 12 ) .
therefore , considering 95 % confidence interval ( alpha = 0.05 ) and 80 % power , the minimum sample size required for each group was calculated to be 32 cases .
collected data were were analysed using spss software version 20 .
chi - square test , t - test and fisher - exact test were used for comparing variables between the two groups. with the aim of eliminating probable bias , a backward multifactorial regression logistic model was designed to show the independent effect of residency on the mentioned complications .
odds ratios were reported with 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) .
p - value less than 0.05 was considered as significant .
results baseline variables 72 patients with the mean age of 37.1 +/ - 14.1 years were studied ( 86.1 % male ) .
baseline characteristics of participants are summarized in table 1 .
there was no significant difference between the groups regarding patients' baseline variables .
outcomes 23 ( 63.8 %) cases of tube thoracostomy were complicated in srs and 22 ( 61.1 %) cases in emrs ( total = 62.5 %) .
frequency of tube thoracostomy - related complications in each group is presented in table 2 .
chest drain dislodgement ( 22.2 % in srs vs. 22.2 % emrs ; p > 0.99 ) , drainage failure ( 19.4 % in srs vs. 16.7 % emrs ; p = 0.50 ) , and surgical site infection ( 11.1 % in srs vs. 19.4 % emrs ; p = 0.25 ) were among the most common observed complications .
the odds ratios for developing tube thoracostomy - related complications are presented in table 3 .
the overall odds ratio of complication developing was 0.89 ( 95 % ci : 0.35 - 2.25 , p = 0.814 ) for srs and 1.12 ( 95 % ci : 0.28 - 4.53 , p = 0.867 ) for emrs .
quality of tube placement was not different between srs and emrs according to radiologist reports ( 2.5 +/ - 1.5 versus 2.1 +/ - 1.3 score , respectively ; p = 0.19 ) .
discussion the findings of the present study showed no significant difference between srs and emrs regarding quality of tube thoracostomy placement and its subsequent complications for trauma patients .
the prevalence of tube thoracostomy complications were 63.8 % and 61.1 % in srs and emrs , respectively ( total = 62.5 %) .
the rate of intercostal artery injury , pleural cavity infection , and retroperitoneal placement of tube thoracostomy was reported to be 37 % in sethuraman et al. study .
they revealed that , tube thoracostomy by emrs has similar complication rates as the other residents and they are generally minor types of complications ( 13 ) .
aziz et al. , in a year - long study in 2010 , showed that operator 's skill is one of the most important factors affecting the outcome and complications of tube thoracostomy placement .
the complication rates were exceptionally higher if residents did the procedure compared to the specialists .
they reported the 36.7 % total complication rate consisted of 26.7 % technical and 10 % infective ( 14 ) .
total complication rates in the present study were higher than others reports ( about 2 times ) .
this higher prevalence rate might be due to lack of knowledge , proper attitude or skills among the studied residents regarding tube thoracostomy .
therefore , holding continuous training courses and performing the procedure under supervision of a specialist may be effective in this regard .

chan et al. did a retrospective study in 1997 and revealed that tube thoracostomy placement in the emergency department does not lead to a higher rate of complication compared to tube insertion in the operating room ( 15 ) .
ball et al. also did a retrospective study and revealed 88 % technical and 12 % infective complications .
additionally , tube placements by non - surgery residents outside the trauma wards were the independent prognostic factors for occurrence of complications .
13 % of the tubes placed by srs and 40 % of the tubes placed by emrs had complications ( 12 ) .
it is strongly suggested to enhance the quality of education starting with a kap study ( knowledge , attitude , and practice ) on srs and emrs regarding placement of tube thoracostomy .
limitations carrying out the study in 2 separate centres , and therefore having different conditions in the emergency departments regarding staff , patients and environment , might have prevented fully considering / adhering to characteristics of a cohort among participants , especially regarding selection bias .
in addition , not blinding the observer residents might lead to observer bias .
among other limitations of this study is its small sample size .
conclusion the findings of the present study showed no significant difference between srs and emrs regarding quality of tube thoracostomy placement and its subsequent complications for trauma patients .
the rate of complications were interestingly high (> 60 %) for both groups .

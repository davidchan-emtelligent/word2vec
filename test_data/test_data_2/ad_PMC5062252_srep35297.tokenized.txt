it receives remarkable attention due to the high degree of efficacy .
very recently , the crystal structure of the fab fragment of pembrolizumab ( pemfab ) in complex with the extracellular domain of human pd - 1 ( pd - 1ecd ) was reported at a resolution of 2.9 a. however , this relatively low - resolution structural data fails to provide sufficient information on interfacial water molecules at the binding interface that substantially contribute to affinity and specificity between the therapeutic antibody and target .
here , we present the independently determined crystal structure of the fv fragment of pembrolizumab ( pemfv ) in complex with the pd - 1ecd at a resolution of 2.15 a. this high - resolution structure allows the accurate mapping of the interaction including water - mediated hydrogen bonds and provides , for the first time , a coherent explanation of pd - 1 antagonism by pembrolizumab .
our structural data also provides new insights into the rational design of improved anti - pd - 1 therapeutics .
when the pd - 1 ( also known as cd279 ) inhibitory receptor binds its endogenous ligand , pd - l1 ( cd274 , b7 - h1 ) , the resulting signalling suppresses immune responses against autoantigens and plays an important role in the maintenance of peripheral immune tolerance1 .
however , a significantly increased expression of pd - l1 in various tumours permits these malignant cells to escape destruction by the immune system23 .
the pd - 1 / pd - l1 interaction inhibits t - lymphocyte proliferation , release of cytokines , and cytotoxicity , resulting in exhaustion of tumour - specific t cells4 .
the blockage of the pd - 1 / pd - l1 pathway results in the reversal of the exhausted t - cell phenotype and the normalization of the anti - tumour response , providing a rationale for cancer immunotherapy5 .
targeting the pd - 1 / pd - l1 interaction with monoclonal antibodies has demonstrated great promise as a strategy for controlling and eradicating cancer .
two antibodies against pd - 1 , pembrolizumab ( keytruda , merck and co. ) and nivolumab ( opdivo , bristol - myers squibb ) , were approved by the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) in 2014 for patients with advanced melanoma67 .
recent clinical trials have shown that these antibodies are effective against other cancers , such as non - small cell lung cancer , renal cell carcinoma , bladder cancer , and hodgkin 's lymphoma8 .
it is widely expected that anti - pd - 1 antibodies are likely to become an important component of treatment for a variety of malignancies .
although these antibodies are associated with substantial benefits , the immune checkpoint blockade can lead to inflammatory side effects9 .
obtaining the atomic structure of the human pd - 1 / therapeutic antibody complex is essential for understanding its inhibition mechanism and the design of improved anti - pd - 1 therapeutics .
very recently , the crystal structure of the fab fragment of pembrolizumab in complex with the extracellular domain of human pd - 1 ( pd - 1ecd ) has been determined at a resolution of 2.9 a10 .
although the binding site of pembrolizumab on pd - 1 has been roughly identified , this relatively low - resolution structural data does not provide sufficient information on interfacial water molecules at the binding interface that substantially contribute to affinity and specificity between the receptor and therapeutic antibody .
to provide a sufficient rationale for pd - 1 antagonism by pembrolizumab , it is necessary to visualize water - mediated hydrogen bonds with higher - resolution structural data .
herein , we present the independently determined crystal structure of the fv fragment of pembrolizumab ( pemfv ) in complex with pd - 1ecd at a resolution of 2.15 a and compare its intermolecular interface with that of the pd - l1 / pd - 1ecd complex including water - mediated hydrogen bond networks .
our high - resolution structural data provides a coherent explanation of the mode of competitive inhibitory action by pembrolizumab .
moreover , it provides new insights into the rational design of improved anti - pd - 1 therapeutics .
results and discussion structure of pembrolizumab fv in complex with pd - 1 considering that both pemfv and pd - 1ecd contain intrachain disulfide bonds , a gram - positive bacterial secretion expression system was used to produce these proteins for crystallography ( methods ) .
the resulting co - crystals appeared in the space group p212121 , and the structure was determined by molecular replacement to a resolution of 2.15 a ( rwork and rfree values of 18.4 % and 22.6 % , respectively )( table 1 and supplementary figure s1 ) .
although each asymmetric unit of the crystals contains four complex assemblies , analytical gel filtration confirmed that the 1:1 complex ( approximately 42 kda ) exists as a monomer in solution ( data not shown ) .
the overall structure of the pemfv / pd - 1ecd complex shows that the complementarity determining regions ( cdrs ) of pemfv interact predominantly with a major groove in pd - 1ecd , which is formed on one surface by the cc'fg antiparallel beta - sheet and the bc , c 'd , and fg loops ( fig. 1a ) .
the interface includes 15 direct hydrogen bonds between residues , 15 water - mediated hydrogen bonds , two salt bridges , and hydrophobic interactions , and a total of 26 residues of pd - 1ecd are involved in the interaction ( fig. 2 ) .
the complex formation buries a very large solvent - accessible surface area of 1,137 a2 on pd - 1ecd , which is much higher than the common value observed in other antigen / antibody complexes11 .
most prominently , residues located in loop c 'd ( pro84 to gly90 ) and in strand c ' ( gln75 to lys78 ) of pd - 1ecd provide a key part of the interactions , mainly through hydrogen bonds and salt bridges to the cdr - l3 , cdr - h1 , cdr - h2 and cdr - h3 of pembrolizumab .
the n - linked glycosylated residues asn49 , asn58 , asn74 and asn116 are located away from the interface , suggesting that the sugar chains have no direct contact with pembrolizumab .
less surprisingly , the overall structure of the pemfv / pd - 1ecd complex reported here was similar to that of the pemfab / pd - 1ecd complex ( pdb id : 5jxe ) 10 .
both structure 's backbones align very well with a root - mean - square deviation ( r.m.s.d. ) of 0.38 a ( with 192 calpha atoms ) .
nevertheless , one important novelty of our study is the visualization of 15 water - mediated hydrogen bonds at the binding interface ( fig. 2 , green lines ) .
the previously reported pemfab / pd - 1ecd complex structure only visualizes 8 direct hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge .
because of its relatively low resolution of 2.9 a , there is no assignment of hydrogen - bonded interfacial water molecules that mediate imperfect surface complementarity of the antibody / antigen interface ( supplementary figure s2 ) .
without considering the structural and energetic contribution of the interfacial water molecules , one cannot provide a sufficient rationale for the extremely high binding affinity of pembrolizumab against pd - 1 .
comparison of binding sites of pd - 1 for pembrolizumab and pd - l1 it has been shown that the intermolecular interaction between pd - 1 and pd - l1 occurs mainly via the cc'fg sheet within both proteins1213 .
in the crystal structure of human pd - 1ecd in complex with the n - terminal half of the extracellular domain of human pd - l1 ( pd - l1ecd - n ) ( pdb id : 4zqk ) 13 , there is a hydrophobic surface patch formed by residues val64 , tyr68 , ile126 , leu128 , ala132 and ile134 in pd - 1ecd that interacts with pd - l1ecd - n. surrounding the hydrophobic patch , several hydrophilic residues of pd - l1ecd - n interact with residues asn66 , tyr68 , gln75 , thr76 , asp77 , lys78 , ala132 and glu136 of pd - 1ecd , forming numerous hydrogen bonds and salt bridges ( fig. 1b and fig. 2 ) .
in total , 12 residues of pd - 1ecd participate in its interactions with pd - l1ecd - n , forming 9 direct hydrogen bonds between residues , three water - mediated hydrogen bonds , two salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions .
the interface buries 796 a2 of the solvent - accessible surface area on pd - 1ecd .
a structural comparison between the pemfv / pd - 1ecd complex and the pd - l1ecd - n / pd - 1ecd complex indicates that the epitope recognized by pembrolizumab overlaps largely with the residues in pd - 1 responsible for the interaction with pd - l1 .
seven residues ( asn66 , gln75 , thr76 , asp77 , lys78 , ala132 and glu136 ) of pd - 1ecd participate in polar interactions with both pemfv and pd - l1ecd - n , and a solvent - accessible surface area of 682 a2 on pd - 1ecd is commonly buried in the complex with either pemfv or pd - l1ecd - n ( fig. 1c and fig. 2 ) .
the disparity of binding affinities ( a kd value of 8.2 mum for pd - 1ecd / pd - l1ecd - n14 , versus a kd value of 27 pm for pd - 1ecd / pembrolizumab igg15 ) can be attributed to a significant difference in the number of polar interactions , including water - mediated hydrogen bonds .
these observations rationalize that the binding of pembrolizumab to pd - 1 would compete with the binding of pd - l1 to the receptor .
in the absence of pembrolizumab , the binding of the inactive pd - 1 receptor to the pd - l1 dimer16 would trigger receptor dimerization , followed by the trans - phosphorylation of a tyrosine within the immunoreceptor tyrosine - based switch motif ( itsm ) , the recruitment of the protein tyrosine phosphatase shp - 2 , and the dephosphorylation of the t - cell receptor ( tcr ) proximal signalling molecules including zap70 , pkctheta , and cd3zeta .
this would lead to the attenuation of the tcr signal to suppress the immune response17 .
however , in the presence of a sufficient amount of pembrolizumab , the pd - l1 binding site on pd - 1 would be blocked , and thus , pd - 1 would not be able to undergo dimerization .
therefore , the pd - 1 signalling would not be performed .
implications for development of improved anti - pd - 1 drugs pembrolizumab forms a large , flat paratope to accommodate a large conformational epitope on pd - 1 .
upon the binding of pembrolizumab , pd - 1ecd undergoes a peripheral conformational change , probably because of an induced fit , to generate a " crescent " - like structure with a shallow concave groove ; this differs from the flat surfaces of the apo - and pd - l1 - bound forms of pd - 1ecd ( fig. 3 ) .
however , the groove is too shallow to design traditional small - molecule drugs that can bind tightly to prevent the binding of pd - l1 .
instead , the structural data reported here is a useful resource for the rational design of middle - sized molecules such as cyclic peptides or dna and rna aptamers that may possibly more easily mimic the effect of the binding of pembrolizumab to pd - 1 .
for instance , on the basis of the structural data of the pemfv / pd - 1ecd complex , the rosetta peptiderive program18 identified that a 13 - residue linear polypeptide segment spanning from hala97 to htyr109 of pemfv contributes most predominantly to the complex binding energy ( fig. 4a ) .
a cyclic peptide derivative of this " hot segment " ( cys - ala - arg - arg - asp - tyr - arg - phe - asp - met - gly - phe - asp - tyr - trp - gly - cys ; a peptide structurally constrained by a disulfide bond between the terminal cys residues ) was designed , and the complex formation with pd - 1ecd was modelled ( fig. 4b ) .
in this model , the binding site of the cyclic peptidomimetic is overlapped with that of pd - l1 .
the prodigy program19 estimated that a kd value of the binding affinity of the cyclic peptide to pd - 1ecd is 5.6 x 10 - 7 m. this cyclic peptide would be a good starting material for the development of downsized blockers of the pd - 1 / pd - l1 pathway .
structure - guided design of such peptidomimetics could overcome disadvantages of the current therapeutic antibody associated with the extremely high cost of commercial - scale production and the limited penetration into tissues .
our high - resolution structural data of the pemfv / pd - 1ecd complex also serves as a guide for further engineering of pembrolizumab to strike a balance between its efficacy and reducing its adverse effects .
different combinations of targeted disruption of the direct or water - mediated hydrogen bonds and the salt bridges observed at the binding interface should modulate the affinity of pembrolizumab against pd - 1 .
such structure - guided mutagenesis can generate derivatives with lower affinities for pd - 1 , resulting in a shift of the binding equilibrium towards partially active ( pd - l1 - bound ) states of pd - 1 .
creating partially inverse agonist antibodies would have novel implications for immune cell signalling and its regulation .
in summary , we report the high - resolution structure of pembrolizumab fv in complex with the human pd - 1 extracellular domain , which enables us to identify the detailed intermolecular interface between pembrolizumab and pd - 1 .
this structure allows for a deep understanding and mechanistic interpretation of pd - 1 immune blockade therapy by pembrolizumab .
it also provides a good starting point for facilitating efforts to develop improved anti - pd - 1 therapeutics to modulate immune responses to fight cancer .

protein expression and purification the pd - 1 extracellular domain ( pd - 1ecd ) and pembrolizumab fv ( pemfv ) were expressed in brevibacillus choshinensis and secreted as his6 - tagged proteins .
the proteins were purified from culture medium .
the artificially synthesized codon - optimized cdna of pd - 1ecd , pemvl and pemvh were inserted downstream of and in frame with the secretion signal sequence of the plasmid pny326 ( clontech ) , which contains a neomycin - resistance gene and the constitutively active promoter p5 .
to facilitate the detection and purification of the secreted proteins , the sequences for the tobacco etch virus ( tev ) protease cleavage site and a his6 tag were placed at the c - termini of the pd - 1ecd and pemvl cdnas .
all cloned inserts were verified by sequencing of both strands .
non - sporulating brevibacillus choshinensis hpd31 - sp3 cells ( clontech ) were electroporated with the individual plasmids under the conditions of 7.5 kv / cm , 25 muf , and 1000 omega according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
the cells were grown at 30 degreesc and 200 rpm in 2sy medium ( soypton 40 g / l , yeast extract 5 g / l , glucose 20 g / l , and calcl2 0.15 g / l ) supplemented with 50 mg / l neomycin .
for the expression of pemfv , the cells expressing pemvl and pemvh were initially grown separately as overnight precultures .
the precultures were then combined , diluted in 2sy medium to give an od600 of 0.02 for each strain , and grown for 65 - 70 h. the cells were removed by centrifugation at 6,000 g for 15 min .
the recovered culture supernatant was adjusted to a final ammonium sulfate concentration of 60 % saturation .
the precipitate was pelleted , dissolved in tbs buffer ( 10 mm tris - hcl , ph 7.5 , 150 mm nacl ) , and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer .
the dialyzed sample was mixed with ni - nta resin equilibrated with buffer a ( 10 mm tris - hcl , ph 7.5 , 150 mm nacl , and 20 mm imidazole ) .
bound proteins were eluted with buffer b ( 10 mm tris - hcl , ph 7.5 , 150 mm nacl , and 250 mm imidazole ) , mixed with tev - his6 and dialyzed overnight against tbs buffer .
the cleaved his6 tag and tev - his6 were removed using a histrap column equilibrated with buffer a. tag - free fv fragments were concentrated and loaded onto a hiload 16 / 60 superdex 75 column ( ge healthcare ) equilibrated with tbs buffer .
the peak fractions were pooled , concentrated , flash frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at - 80 degreesc .
crystallisation the protein complex was prepared by incubating pd - 1ecd with pemfv at a molar ratio of 1:2 for 1 h on ice .
the complex was subjected to size exclusion chromatography ( superdex 200 10 / 300 column , ge healthcare ) .
peak fractions containing the pd - 1ecd / pemfv complex were concentrated to approximately 10 mg / ml by ultrafiltration ( millipore , mwco 10 kda ) and used for the crystallisation experiments .
the crystals of the complex used for structural determination were grown at 20 degreesc by sitting drop vapor diffusion .
a 50 - mul reservoir containing 20 % peg 3350 and 0.2 m kno3 was equilibrated against a 0.4 mul drop containing a 1:1 mixture of the complex and reservoir solution .
after 20 days of growth , the crystals were cryo - protected in 25 % ethylene glycol in the mother liquor and then flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen .
data collection , structure determination and analysis the diffraction data were collected at 100 k at the spring - 8 beamline bl41xu ( japan ) using a pilatus3 6m detector .
the data were then integrated and scaled using xds20 .
the structure of the pd - 1ecd / pemfv complex was determined by molecular replacement with the program mr - phaser21 using the atomic coordinates of the extracellular domain of human pd - 1 ( pdb id : 3rrq ) and the fv portion of pembrolizumab ( pdb id : 5dk3 ) 22 as the search models .
the model was further rebuilt in coot23 and refined with phenix.refine24 ( table 1 ) .
the obtained crystals were merohedrally twinned according to phenix.xtriage24 and the data were refined with twin law ( k , h , - l ) .
also , it should be noted that the data were processed with orthorhombic crystal system instead of tetragonal ( despite of a - and b - axes with nearly the same length ) based on refinement statistics .
in the final ramachandran plot , 97.7 % and 2.3 % of residues were in the favored and allowed regions , respectively .
the refined structures were visualized with pymol ( http :// www.pymol.org /) .
the pisa server25 was used for identifying protein - protein interactions and estimating the solvent - accessible surface area .
the peptiderive server18 ( http :// rosie.rosettacommons.org / peptiderive ) was used to identify hot segments of the pemfv / pd - 1ecd interaction .
the hot segments are linear peptide stretch with significant binding energy compared to that of the whole protein - protein interaction .
the program was run with setting the peptide lengths to derive as 5 to 20 , separately .
the prodigy server19 ( http :// milou.science.uu.nl / services / prodigy ) was used to estimate the binding affinity of the complexes of peptidemimetics / pd - 1ecd on the basis of their structural models .

the horizontal axis indicates the starting residue of each sliding window consisting of a 13 - mer peptide segment .
( b ) a structural model of the complex of pd - 1ecd ( surface ) and a cyclic peptide ( stick representation ) with a favourable binding energy .
the residues of pd - 1ecd that are involved in the interactions with both pembrolizumab and pd - l1 are coloured in red .
canonical designations of beta strands are also shown .

background mechanisms of inflammation and protein accumulation are crucial in inclusion body myositis ( ibm ) .
recent evidence demonstrated that intravenous immunoglobulin failed to suppress cell - stress mediators in ibm .
here we studied the molecular changes in skeletal muscle biopsies from patients with ibm before and after treatment with alemtuzumab .
methods relevant inflammatory and degeneration - associated markers were assessed by quantitative - pcr and immunohistochemistry in repeated muscle biopsy specimens from patients with ibm , which had been treated in a previously published uncontrolled proof - of - concept trial with alemtuzumab .
results there were no significant changes of the mrna expression levels of the pro - inflammatory chemokines cxcl - 9 , ccl - 4 , and the cytokines ifn - gamma , tgf - beta , tnf - alpha , and il - 1beta .
similarly , the degeneration - associated molecules ubiquitin , app and alphab - crystallin did not substantially change .
although no overall beneficial treatment effect was noted except for a 6 - month stabilization , some patients experienced a transient improvement in muscle strength .
in such responders , a trend towards reduced expression of inflammatory markers was noted .
in contrast , the expression remained unchanged in the others who did not experience any change .
the expression levels of il - 1beta and mhc - i correlated with the positive clinical effect. by immunohistochemistry , some inflammatory mediators like cd8 , cxcl - 9 , and mhc - i were downmodulated .
however , no consistent changes were noted for ubiquitin , nitrotyrosin and beta - amyloid .
conclusions alemtuzumab showed a trend towards downregulation of the expression of some inflammatory molecules in skeletal muscle of ibm patients but has no effect on several crucial markers of cell stress and degeneration .
the data are helpful to explain the molecular treatment effects of future lymphocyte - targeted immunotherapies in ibm .
keywords muscle inflammation inclusion body myositis alemtuzumab t - cell depletion issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background inclusion body myositis ( ibm ) , the most common myopathy in patients over 50 years of age , leads to a progressive muscle weakness and atrophy [ 1 ] .
histopathological examination in ibm muscles reveals two major features : inflammation and degeneration [ 2 ] .
cytotoxic lymphocytes surround and invade non - necrotic myofibers and proinflammatory chemo - and cytokines , such as ccl - 2 , ccl - 3 , ccl - 4 , cxcl - 9 , il - 1beta , tnf - alpha and tgf - beta are overexpressed .
on the other hand , degeneration is present with vacuoles and accumulation of unwanted and misfolded proteins like beta - amyloid , phosphorylated tau , tdp43 and alpha - synuclein [ 3 ] .
both processes are relevant to the pathogenesis in ibm and seem to be related to each other [ 4 ] .
despite the clearly demonstrated inflammatory pathomechanisms , immunosuppressive treatments failed to show a clear benefit in ibm , including methotrexate , mycophenolate - mofetil and the tnf - alpha blocker etanercept [ 5 - 9 ] .
in controlled studies with ivig , a significant effect could be recognized on dysphagia [ 10 ] , but no improvement in limb strength could be observed [ 11 , 12 ] .
in an uncontrolled proof - of - concept study with alemtuzumab in 13 ibm patients , a reduction of their disease progression for up to six months was observed [ 13 ] .
alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against cd52 and therefore leads to a profound depletion of peripheral lymphocytes [ 14 ] .
in the present study , we have analyzed the molecular changes in skeletal muscle biopsies from the ibm patients , who participated in the previous trial with alemtuzumab .
methods patients and muscle biopsies we used muscle biopsy specimen from skeletal muscle of the 13 ibm patients , who received alemtuzumab in a previous trial [ 13 ] .
all patients were treated with a single infusion of alemtuzumab at a dose of 1.2 mg / kg over 4 days not exceeding a total dose of 120 mg. muscle biopsies were performed prior and 6 months after treatment with alemtuzumab at the same site .
in most cases , the biceps was used as standard muscle .
occasionally the quadriceps was chosen , e.g. when the biceps was severely atrophic .
irb - approved consent for use of their samples had been obtained .
extraction of rna and quantitative pcr for extraction of total rna from muscle biopsies , the rneasy kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca , usa ) was used , following the supplier 's instructions .
the tissue was homogenized in 350 mul lysis buffer , rna was subsequently eluted in 30 mul water and stored at - 80 degreesc .
for cdna synthesis , superscript ii reverse transcriptase ( invitrogen , darmstadt , germany ) was used , according to the supplier 's instructions .
originated cdna was amplified with master mix for real - time pcr ( invitrogen ) using 6 - carboxy - fluorescein ( fam ) - labelled probes and specific primers ( applied biosystems , carlsbad , ca , usa ) : glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( gapdh , s99999905 _ m1 ) ; app ( hs00169098 _ m1 ) , tgf - beta1 ( hs00171257 _ m ) ; il - 1beta ( hs00174 \ 097 _ m1 ) ; ubiquitin ( hs00430290 _ m1 ) ; cxcl - 9 ( hs00171065 _ m1 ) ; alphab - crystallin ( hs00157107 _ m1 ) ; ncam ( hs00169851 _ m1 ) ; ccl - 4 ( hs00605740 _ g1 ) ; ifn - gamma ( hs00174143 _ m1 ) ; tnf - alpha ( hs00174128 _ m1 ) .
reactions were performed in duplicates on a sds 7500 sequence detection system ( applied biosystems ) , following the standard cycle protocol and instructions given by the supplier .
target mrna - expression was quantified using the c ( t ) method in relation to expression of glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( gapdh ) mrna as housekeeping gene .
staining of muscle tissue for immunohistochemistry , 5 mum frozen sections of all muscle biopsies were fixed in acetone at - 20 degreesc for 10 min .
primary antibodies were diluted in 1 % bsa .
incubation was performed at room temperature for one hour .
following primary antibodies were used : beta - amyloid ( mouse clone 6e10 , signet , dedham , ma ) ; mhc class i ( rat clone yth 862.2 from serotec , oxford , uk ) ; app ( rabbit polyclonal from serotec , oxford , uk ) ; inos ( rabbit polyclonal from chemicon / millipore , billerica , ma ) ; ncam ( mouse clone eric - 1 from labvision / neomarkers , fremont , ca ) ; alphab - crystallin ( rabbit polyclonal from serotec ) ; il - 1beta ( rabbit polyclonal from abcam , cambridge , usa ) ; cxcl - 9 ( goat polyclonal from r & d ) ; p - neurofilament ( mouse clone smi - 31 from covance , princeton , nj , usa ) .
consecutive sections of all patients were double - labelled for 1 ) cxcl - 9 and mhc - i ; 2 ) ncam and alphab - crystallin ; 3 ) il - 1beta and beta - amyloid ; 4 ) inos and smi - 31 .
goat - derived alexa 594 or alexa 488 were used as secondary antibodies and diluted in 1 % bsa .
after mounting in fluoromount g ( southern biotech , alabama , usa ) , digital photography was performed on a zeiss axiophot microscope ( zeiss , gottingen , germany ) .
pictures were taken by a cooled ccd digital camera ( retiga 1300 , qimaging , burnaby , bc , canada ) and visualized with imageproplus software ( mediacybernetics , bethesda , md ) .
for quantification , two independant raters were scoring the signal intensity on a scale ranging from 0 to 3 and the mean was defined as semiquantitative ihc - score .
statistics for statistical analysis ( t - test , pearson correlation ) , p < 0.05 was used as significant value and all significant outliers ( grubb 's test ) were excluded prior to analysis ( graph pad prism v5 , san diego , ca , usa ) .
results partial downmodulation of mrna levels of inflammatory mediators after alemtuzumab the expression levels of several disease - relevant markers of ibm were determined by quantitative pcr ( fig. 1 ) .
the mrna expression of pro - inflammatory chemokines cxcl - 9 , ccl - 4 , il - 1beta , ifn - gamma , and tnf - alpha were downmodulated after treatment in several patients , but no statistical significance was observed .
the expression level of degeneration - associated molecules ubiquitin and app remained also unchanged before and after treatment. fig. 1 gapdh - normalized mrna expression of inflammatory and degenerative markers .
the mrna - expression was assessed by quantitative ( real - time ) polymerase chain reaction relative to gapdh in skeletal muscle from patients with inclusion body myositis ( ibm ) before ( pre ) and after ( post ) treatment with alemtuzumab .
subgroups are differentially labeled as responders ( red ) and non - responders ( blue ) partial reduction of inflammatory markers based on immunohistochemical staining after alemtuzumab in line with the mrna - expression results , immunohistochemical analysis of relevant pro - inflammatory mediators showed reduced expression levels in several patients , but no statistical significance was reached ( fig. 2 ) .
more specifically , cxcl - 9 and mhc - i were diminished in the majority of the patients ; in contrast , markers for degeneration and cell stress , including beta - amyloid and alphab - crystallin , remained unchanged after treatment. fig. 2 immunohistochemistry of inflammatory and degenerative markers in skeletal muscle of ibm patients before and after treatment with alemtuzumab .
no significant changes were observed for cd8 , mhc - i , the proinflammatory chemokine cxcl - 9 and the cytokine il - 1beta .
similarly , the degeneration - associated molecules nitrotyrosine , beta - amyloid , alphab - crystallin and ncam remained without major variation .
subgroups are differentially labeled as responders ( red ) and non - responders ( blue ) subtype analysis of patients who experienced a temporary improvement of strength after treatment vs. those who did not although the study was small and uncontrolled , some patients experienced a clear but short - lasting improvement of weakness in arms and legs [ 13 ] .
this response was , however , heterogeneous .
four patients experienced a gain of strength at 6 months after treatment as reflected by quantitative muscle testing , mrc scale and subjective improvement ; for the purpose of this study , we considered those as " responders " , even if the response is not defined on a statistical basis but only on careful observations collected by the non - treating examiners ; in contrast , 9 patients had no clear subjective or objective benefit , and we considered them as " non - responders " [ 13 ] .
the molecular differences between these two groups were examined and compared with each other .
the mrna expression levels of cxcl - 9 , ccl - 4 ( p = 0.048 ) , ifn - gamma , tgf - beta , tnf - alpha , and il - 1beta ( p = 0.0403 ) were downmodulated in the " responders " compared to " non - responders " ( fig. 3 ). by contrast , the expression rate of the de - and regeneration / cell - stress markers app , alphab - crystallin and desmin displayed a similar expression in both groups ( fig. 3 ). by immunohistochemical staining , cd8 ( p = 0.013 ) , cxcl - 9 ( p = 0.0095 ) and mhc - i ( p = 0.042 ) were clearly diminished in the " responders " compared to " non - responders " ( fig. 3 ) ; this was in contrast to the protein expression of beta - amyloid , ncam , nitrotyrosine and alphab - crystallin which remained unchanged in both groups after treatment ( fig. 3 ) .
accumulation of beta - amyloid showed also no difference , regardless of the clinical outcome. fig. 3 change of expression of relevant markers measured with qpcr and immunohistochemistry .
mean fold reduction of qpcr assessment ( a , b ) and mean reduction in signal intensity ( c , d ) before versus after treatment for pro - inflammatory ( a , c ) and degeneration - associated molecules ( b , d ) .
assessment of semiquantitative immunohistochemistry analysis was done by two masked observers of skeletal muscle biopsies stainings from all patients and the mean value is depicted .
the group was divided into responders ( red ) and non - responders ( blue ) .
for pro - inflammatory molecules , one can assume a reduction in expression for responders ( qpcr : p = 0.048 for ccl - 4 , p = 0.0403 for il - 1beta ; immunohistochemistry : p = 0.013 for cd8 + , p = 0.0095 for cxcl - 9 , p = 0.042 for mhc - i ) , whereas non - responders show an increase of expression of proinflammatory molecules .
only one patient , who responded well to therapy , revealed an increase in cxcl - 9 expression .
in both groups , the change of expression of degeneration - associated molecules did not differ , regardless of the clinical improvement discussion in this study we demonstrate that one series of infusions with alemtuzumab can reduce the expression of pro - inflammatory molecules in some ibm patients , especially those with the most noticeable clinical benefit , suggesting that inflammatory mechanisms in ibm are of clinical importance .
although various immunosuppressants or immunomodulators may transiently help some ibm patients , several short - term controlled trials have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect , leading to the notion that in ibm , the long - term degenerative process exerts the most deleterious effect compared to autoimmune and inflammatory changes [ 3 ] .
our results from the alemtuzumab trial are illuminating because they show suppression of key inflammatory mediators - some of which are connected to enhancing degeneration - in connection with some clinical benefit [ 13 ] .
although this was an uncontrolled proof - of - concept study with a small number of patients dictating careful interpretation of data , the noted correlation between the reduction of proinflammatory markers with short clinical benefit in some of the patients , suggests that a potent immunosuppressive treatment , if sustained over longer time periods , may not only alter the proinflammatory muscle microenvironment but may also affect the degenerative process and result in a clinical benefit .
one reason for not observing a sustained effect might have been the observation that alemtuzumab did not suppress all the degenerative and cell - stressor molecules .
nitric oxide in particular , a mediator between inflammation and degeneration , was also unchanged .
similar data we obtained in the repeated muscle specimens in a short - term controlled study with intravenous immunoglobulin and prednisolone , where we demonstrated that inflammatory markers were downmodulated after therapy but not the cell - stress molecules like alphab - crystallin and degenerative molecules like app [ 15 ] .
further , compared to the experience with alemtuzumab in ms patients [ 16 , 17 ] , the lack of effect in ibm might be also related to using only one set of infusions since the protocol was designed as a proof - of - concept study rather than a clinical trial .
one set of infusions could lead to a different treatment response , considering the repletion kinetics of different lymphocyte subsets [ 18 ] .
recently it was shown that regulatory t - cells are reduced in ibm , suggesting a role in pathogenesis [ 19 ] especially since they can inhibit the lytic activity of cytotoxic t cells in vitro [ 20 ] .
because alemtuzumab is reprogramming the immune system [ 21 ] and could change the proposed imbalance between cytotoxic and regulatory t - cells , a repeated set of infusions - even more than what is necessary in multiple sclerosis ( ms ) - may be needed to achieve a sustained effect on specific repletion patterns in order to affect the noxious degenerative molecules .
another possible explanation for the ineffectiveness or unsustained efficacy of alemtuzumab could be the lack of effect on cytokine expression , especially in those patients who did not experience any clinical benefit .
in this case , the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines may be independent of peripheral t - lymphocytes .
recently , the blocking effect of il - 1beta was tested in ibm - patients in a small pilot study of 4 patients , demonstrating no efficacy [ 22 ]. whether there are different subsets of patients with ibm , some of whom may respond differently to an immunosuppressive treatment , cannot be answered so far .
in this study , we were not able to identify potential molecular markers that could predict the response to alemtuzumab .
finally , it is possible that the muscle tissue may not be sensitive enough to capture changes of the molecules studied in such a short period .
conclusion in conclusion , our data show that a lymphocyte - targeted immunotherapy can change the pro - inflammatory milieu in some patients with ibm and this may correspond to a better clinical outcome .
most importantly , several crucial markers of cell stress and degeneration remain unchanged , providing an explanation for lack of sustained clinical benefit .
in the future , clinical trials examining the molecular inflammatory and degenerative changes in the muscle and correlating them with clinical outcomes may shed light in understanding the pathogenesis of ibm .

while the debate over speedup remains inconclusive as of now , instead of attempting to show general quantum advantage , here , we focus on a novel real - world application of d - wave in wireless networking - - more specifically , the scheduling of the activation of the air - links for maximum throughput subject to interference avoidance near network nodes .
in addition , d - wave implementation is made error insensitive by a novel hamiltonian extra penalty weight adjustment that enlarges the gap and substantially reduces the occurrence of interference violations resulting from inevitable spin bias and coupling errors .
the major result of this paper is that quantum annealing benefits more than simulated annealing from this gap expansion process , both in terms of st99 speedup and network queue occupancy .
it is the hope that this could become a real - word application niche where potential benefits of quantum annealing could be objectively assessed .
quantum annealing quantum annealing is designed to mimic the process of simulated annealing1 as a generic way to efficiently get close - to - optimum solutions in many np - hard optimization problems .
quantum annealing is believed to utilize quantum tunneling instead of thermal hopping to more efficiently search for the optimum solution in the hilbert space of a quantum annealing device such as the d - wave23 .
since the introduction of d - wave one in 2011 , there has been a considerable amount of work done on its potential applications , e.g. , protein folding4 , determining ramsey number5 , bayesian network structure learning6 , operational planning7 , power system fault detection8 , graph isomorphism9 , database optimization10 , machine learning11 , deep learning12 , to name but a few .
note that of all the applications we are aware of , most were solved with small logical instance size due to hardware constraints and none of them demonstrated conclusive speedup compared to classical methods .
in fact , benchmarking quantum speedup is more subtle than it appears to be. there has recently been a lot of insightful work on such a challenging question131415 .
one conclusive remark is that no evidence for a general speedup has been found thus far , but potential speedup might exist in certain problems or upon scaling .
in this paper , we introduce a new breed of graph - theoretic applications motivated by the very problem that makes the design of optimal wireless network protocols outstanding from the computational viewpoint - - the interference constraints - - and we show that a gap expansion technique benefits quantum annealing much more than simulated annealing , indicating a way to obtain quantum speedup .
quantum annealing is based on the premise that the minimum energy configuration of the ising spin glass model encodes the solution to specific np - hard problems , including all karp 's 21 np - complete problems16 .
such problems are written in the form of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization ( qubo ) problems , where xm in { 0 , 1 } , and cm , jmn represent qubo parameters .
the latter has an equivalent ising formulation where represents the z - pauli operator of ising spin j in the network , and hj and jjk are local fields and coupling strengths , resp .
the annealer initially prepares a initial transverse magnetic field , an equal superposition of 2n computational basis states , eigenspace of during the adiabatic continuation , the hamiltonian evolves smoothly from htrans to hising , that is , where a (.) decreases monotonically from 1 to 0 and b (.) increases monotonically from 0 to 1. from the adiabatic theorem , if the evolution is " slow enough " , the system would remain in its ground state .
thus , in principle , an optimal solution to the original problem could be obtained by measurements at final time17 .
network scheduling problem one of the fundamental problems in multi - hop wireless networks is network scheduling .
signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) has to be maintained above a certain threshold to ensure successful decoding of information at the destination .
for example , ieee 802.11b requires a minimum sinr of 4 and 10 db corresponding to 11 and 1 mbps channel , resp18 .
consequently , only a subset of edges of the network can be activated within the same time slot , since every link transmission causes interference with nearby link transmissions .
different networks and protocols use different interference models .
the most commonly used model is the 1 - hop interference model ( node exclusive model ) , in which every node can transmit or receive along only one activated link abutting that node in the same time slot .
this is commonly used in bluetooth and fh - cdma1920 , while the 2 - hop interference model is sometimes used in studies of ieee 802.11 networks21 , in which no two links within 2 - hop distance can be simultaneously activated .
generally , k - hop is used with k representing arbitrary hop interference model .
in some cross - layer optimization studies22 , the optimal k is found to vary between 1 and 3 .
in theory , protocol designers can set k to arbitrary value , as long as end - to - end delay , signal interference and computation cost reach a pareto - optimal point .
there are two major methods for solving network interference : the first one is the graph based model that solves the weighted maximum independence set ( wmis ) problem on a conflict graph2324252627 , the other optimizes a geometric - based sinr28293031 .
the former is sometimes argued as being an overly idealistic assumption ; however , the wmis problem is still involved in the latter model32 and is of interest in sa versus qa ; thus we mainly consider the former model for simplicity .
several general heuristics for the wmis problem are well - studied , including simulated annealing33 , neural networks343536 , genetic algorithm373839 , greedy randomized genetic search40 , tabu search41424344 .
it is claimed that simulated annealing is superior to other competing methods with experimental instances of up to 70,000 nodes33 .
to give formal definitions on a graph g = ( v , e ) , let wline be the wireless networking link weights in a given time slot .
( they are related to queue differential and somehow the most highly weighted links should receive priority activation if interference allows. ) let ds ( x , y ) denote the hop distance between x , y in v. consider edges eu , ev in e and let deu = { u1 , u2 } , dev = { v1 , v2 } .
we then define to be the distance between edges .
similar to the definition in the work of sharma et al.22 , a subset of edges e ' is said to be valid subject to the k - hop interference model if , for all e1 , e2 in e ' with e1 != e2 , we have d ( e1 , e2 ) >= k. let sk denote the set of k - hop valid edge subsets ( scheduling set ) .
then the network scheduling under the k - hop interference model is in the k = 1 case , the problem is a max - weight matching problem and thus has polynomial solution ( edmonds' blossom algorithm45 ) .
however , for the case k > 1 , the problem is proved to be np - hard and non - approximable22 .
as already said , the network scheduling problem ( 6 ) has to be solved in every time slot ; thus , the complexity of the exact scheduling problem becomes critical in time - sensitive applications .
overview we intend to design a quantum annealing scheduler to solve the wmis problem and benchmark the results obtained by realistic network simulation against simulated annealing .
the complete benchmarking is summarized in the following steps .
conflict graph the original scheduling problem on the original graph is reformulated as a qubo problem ( 1 ) on a conflict graph : the nodes of the conflict graph are the edges of the original graph with weights wl (= cl in qubo ) , while the edges of the conflict graph are pairs of edges of the original graph in scheduling conflict , as illustrated in fig. 1 , left .
as such , subject to proper choice of the jmn ( details in supplemental material ) , the qubo problem ( 1 ) on the conflict graph , the wmis problem , provides a solution to k - hop interference problem on the original graph ( 6 ) .
gap expansion in the wmis problem , some betamn scaling of jmn is introduced as shown in ( 7 ) to open up the gap of the ising model , resulting in less scheduling violations , especially in the qa approach .
embedding to hardware the qubo problem has to be mapped to the ising hamiltonian via , with the constant energy shift ignored .
we perform minor embedding into the d - wave chimera architecture , as illustrated in fig. 1 , right , or decide that it is not embeddable .
this is discussed in more detail in the supplemental material .
figure 1 gives a simple numerical example of how a network is mapped to d - wave architecture .
measurement and post - processing we perform the annealing run a certain number of times on d - wave , find the lowest energy configuration , and use such configuration as scheduling solution .
some commonly used algorithm techniques in adiabatic quantum computation , such as gauge transformation and majority vote on possible broken chains are not performed .
see the work of king et al.46 for more discussion .
results in theory and practice , sa is regarded as a strong competitor of qa and their performances are often contrasted in the literature131415 .
on the other hand , it is known that sa can also boost the overall performance of classical heuristic algorithms in solving wmis problems33 .
thus , it is worth comparing our qa results with the performance of the sa algorithm .
comparison metrics are defined later in this section .
we use the gap expansion process on the quantum scheduler , defined in detail in the following section , and observe that the quantum scheduler takes better advantage of this gap expansion technique than sa. table 1 shows the parameters of the 2 random graphs ( 15 and 20 nodes ) being tested on d - wave installed at information sciences institute of university of southern california ( usc ) .
the " problem size " n is the number of nodes of the wireless network , the " qubo size " is | e | and thus generally scales as o ( n2 ) , where e and n are the edge set and order of the problem graph , resp .
the " physical qubits " is the number of nodes n after minor embedding in the d - wave architecture .
after minor - embedding in the case of the 20 - node network , a significantly large proportion of all available qubits are utilized ( 405 out of 502 ) .
simulated annealing setup here , we adapted a highly optimized simulated annealing algorithm ( an _ ss _ ge _ fi _ vdeg ) 47 , compiling the c ++ source code with gcc 4.8.4 with matlab c - mex api .
additionally , a wide range of parameters were tested to ensure near optimal performance of the algorithm within a reasonable run time ( see supplemental material ) .
all the non - time - critical tests in this section were ran on the servers of the usc center for high - performance computing ( hpc ) .
quality metrics we compare the performance of qa and sa based on three quantitative metrics : average network delay , throughput optimality , and st99 .
the first metric reflects the actual network performance ; the latter two metrics reflect the accuracy and speed of qa and sa compared to exact solvers ( see supplemental material for formal definitions. ) average network delay we use an optimized wireless network protocol in our experiment ( see supplemental material for protocol definitions ) .
in fig. 2 , we show that , after gap expansion , the overall performance significantly improves .
as one would expect , the network delay is also improved and gets closer to the exact classical solution .
it is a rather delicate issue as how to deal with non - independent solutions returned by d - wave .
in the experiment , we skip the time slot transmission if the lowest energy solution does not conform to the k - hop interference model .
sometimes , it makes sense to perform a polynomial greedy style matching when the returned result is non - independent , in which case the problem is more error - insensitive and thus more scalable .
here we consider the worst case scenario , that is , no transmission is allowed if the result is non - independent .
throughput optimality and st99 [ opt ] based on our previous assumption , it is of vital importance that the solutions given by the solver satisfy the independence constraint .
here we use the optimality measure fquantum as defined in section 5.2 of supplemental material .
briefly , if there are no violations , such measure reaches 1 if the solution is exactly optimal , and less than 1 if suboptimal .
if there are violations , if those solutions improve the throughput and if the violations do not even improve the throughput .
in fig. 3 , we investigate the distribution of the optimality factors among all 120 time slots of graph 2 ( the harder graph ) .
all the violations are counted inside red bars .
comparing ( a ) and ( c ) of fig. 3 and ( b ) with ( d ) of fig. 3 , we can see that energy compression as shown in fig. 2 results in substantially less violations of the independence constraint , and that this reduction is more pronounced in the qa case than in the sa case .
this could explain the huge performance improvement before and after gap expansion in fig. 2. the test results of sa under a particular set of parameters are shown in ( c ) and ( d ) of fig. 3 the ranges of our tested parameters are listed in the supplemental material .
it is worth making the following observations : qa benefits more from the gap expansion compared to sa. sa either finds the very optimal ground state or gets trapped in very ' deep ' local minima .
there is still a relatively large number of violations in the returned results of sa even after gap expansion .
this is in agreement with our previous knowledge about sa in that it is designed to find the ground state and it is not optimized to search for sub - optimal results .
in addition , table 2 shows the exact numbers related to the performances of sa and qa after gap expansion. from the optimality data returned by d - wave , we can plot st99 related to the level of optimality as shown in fig. 4. note that our st99 definition ( see supplemental material ) relies on optimality level , which could typically be 80 % or 90 % depending on user needs .
in table 3 , we show how setting the penalty weight beta of the gap expansion consistently with the local or global approach would affect the quality of the returned solution .
we found that setting betaglobal = 1 would yield the best performance so far .
we do not have a quantitative explanation for the wrong solutions ; potential explanations on small problems have been discussed in refs 13 , 14 , 15 .
intuitively , as the problem size grows , it is much more difficult even to find close to ground states ; indeed , as the penalty weight grows too large , the local fields begin to vanish , thus making the problem effectively more difficult since all weights have to be scaled to [ - 2 , + 2 ] .
the problem of quantitative connection among quality measure , network stability , and throughput optimality remains open .
methods gap expansion we try to make the problem insensitive to quantum annealing errors by properly setting the hi and jij terms in eq .
( 2 ) in order to expand the final energy gap .
note that this gap is the energy gap between the eigenvalues of the ising form at the end of the adiabatic evolution , not to be confused with the gap between ground and first excited states during the evolution .
we introduce a scaling factor betamn that multiplies the quadratic part of the qubo formulation and as such scales the various terms so as to put more penalty weight on the independence constraints : where ve and ec denote the vertex set and edge set , resp. , of the conflict graph and betamn is chosen uniform .
in theory , betamn = 1 would suffice as long as jmn > min ( cm , cn ) , as the ground state has already encoded the correct solution of the wmis problem48 .
however , since measuring the ground state correctly is not guaranteed , increasing betamn becomes necessary to enforce the independence constraints , so that the energy spectrum of the non - independence states is raised to the upper energy spectrum and the feasible energy states are compressed to the lower spectrum .
figure 5 illustrates the effect of the feasible energy compression on a small random graph .
a natural question regarding beta would be , how large is large enough ?
the problem is , interestingly , another optimization problem itself .
the d - wave v7 is subject to an internal control error ( ice ) that gives gaussian errors with standard deviations sigmah =~ 0.05 and sigmaj =~ 0.03546 .
putting too large a betamn penalty would incur two problems : 1 ) the local fields would become indistinguishable and 2 ) the minimum evolution gap would become too small .
accordingly , a few parameter values have been tried out and the results are shown in table 3 , which corroborates the experimental results of the previous section indicating that gap expansion would significantly influence the optimality of the returned solution .
there exist several strategies in setting heavier penalty weights to expand the gap .
we compare two different approaches to set the penalty weights : in the local adjustment48 , the constraint on jmn depends only on the fields at dmn , whereas in the global adjstment , contrary to48 , jmn depends on all fields .
discussion we have presented the first experimental d - wave application of network scheduling - - a problem widely investigated in the field of wireless networking understood in the classical sense .
the problem is reduced to a wmis problem , itself reformulated in the form of the minimum energy level of an ising hamiltonian , itself mapped to the chimera architecture by utilizing a differential geometrical approach49 that immediately rules out cases where minor - embedding is impossible .
we increased the success rate of the quantum annealer and the simulated annealer to return non - violation solutions by classically increasing the energy gap , so that the range of acceptable solutions is greatly increased. by comparing qa with sa , though omitting quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) , we found a potential comparison point where qa outperforms sa in the sense of benefit from gap expansion as seen in fig. 3. gap expansion reduces by 89 % the number of violation cases for qa , while it only reduces by 67.5 % the number of violation cases for sa. although , as seen from table 2 , sa has an optimality advantage in non - violation cases , it is however interesting to observe that among suboptimal solution cases qa has less violations than sa. by deliberately constructing cases suitable for suboptimal solutions , one could potentially demonstrate a quantum advantage in terms of less violations .
as far as speed is concerned , we noted that on graph 2 , and disregarding all overhead , the 1,000 runs of qa took a total of 1000 x 20 musec = 20 msec on d - wave ii to render the solution utilized in the performance analysis .
on sa on the other hand , 5,000 runs , totaling 1 minute in the adopted simulation environment , were needed to get solutions comparable with those of qa. this comparison might however be misleading as there is room for considerable speed up of sa on specialized architecture .
it is also argued1415 that even 20 mus might be too large for particular problems ; however , this is the minimum programmable annealing time on d - wave platform .
despite encouraging results , due to the very limited experimental data , we cannot positively assert a general sizable advantage of quantum annealing against simulated annealing .
however , we plan to generalize this potential advantage in the future by utilizing a broader class of graphs and the 1152 - qubit chip .
it is hoped that this could help resolve the speedup issue131415 .
the classical wireless protocols ( backpressure , dirichlet and heat diffusion , see supplemental material for protocol definition ) return solutions with the interference constraints always satisfied - - so that there is forwarding at every time slot .
here , the qa and sa interference problem solvers allow solutions that violate the interference constraints in the interest of speed .
unfortunately , should an interference constraint be violated even at a remote corner of the network , our simulation stops the transmission , so that the dirichlet protocol as it now stands cannot take advantage of the proposed algorithm speedup .
as to whether the dirichlet protocol could be tweaked to take advantage of the faster qa solution to the interference problem is widely open .

the numerical data shows the conflict graph weight structure gqubo and how it is mapped to the ising hamiltonian characterized by hising and jising .
the off - diagonal entries of gqubo are chosen as 0.1 larger than the minimum of the weights of the two corresponding vertices of the conflict graph .
figure 2 network delay of classical exact algorithm , quantum annealing , quantum annealing after gap expansion , and simulated annealing are plotted versus time slot for two randomly generated networks .
the left one is a simpler case with 15 nodes and 31 edges where quantum annealing reaches almost as good a result as the exact solution in terms of network delay ; the right one is a harder case with 20 nodes and 57 edges in total .

d - wave simulation runs are shown in ( a,b ) .
sa simulation runs shown in ( c,d ) are executed under the one set of optimal parameters we have tested ( 5000 sweeps , 5000 repetitions , linear schedule with initial temperature beta0 = 0.1 and final temperature beta1 = 10 ) .
note that the abscissa of the blue vertical bars register fquantum whereas the abscissa of the red vertical bars registers as defined in supplemental material .

figure 4 st99 , defined as , versus required optimality level opt specified by network , before and after gap expansion on graph 1 and graph 2 ( the harder instance ) .
note that the probability is calculated based on all solutions returned by d - wave ; thus , an st99 of 103 corresponds to one set of annealing runs , which in our case costs 20 ms ( 1000 annealing runs with 20 mus for each run ) .
curve for graph 2 before gap expansion ends at 0.9 optimality level , because there are no solutions that satisfy such optimality level after a total of 120,000 annealing runs .
figure 5 hamiltonian energy level evolution with h ( s ) = ( 1 - s ) htrans + shising , demonstrating the feasibility of energy compression on a small , randomly generated test wireless graph with 7 nodes on the conflict graph , plotting all 128 possible energy states in both before and after gap expansion cases .
both hamiltonians are rescaled to have a maximum energy level of 2 for both coupling strengths and local fields .
note that for a typical desktop computer , such plots are impossible to construct once the size of the conflict graph goes higher than 12 .

friedreich ataxia ( frda ) is caused by a gaa repeat expansion in the fxn gene leading to reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin .
recombinant human erythropoietin ( rhuepo ) is suggested to increase frataxin levels , alter mitochondrial function and improve clinical scores in frda patients .
aim of the present pilot study was to investigate mitochondrial metabolism of skeletal muscle tissue in frda patients and examine effects of rhuepo administration by phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31p mrs ) .
seven genetically confirmed frda patients underwent 31p mrs of the calf muscles using a rest - exercise - recovery protocol before and after receiving 3000 iu of rhuepo for eight weeks .
frda patients showed more rapid phosphocreatine ( pcr ) depletion and increased accumulation of inorganic phosphate ( pi ) during incremental exercise as compared to controls .
after maximal exhaustive exercise prolonged regeneration of pcr and slowed decline in pi can be seen in frda .
pcr regeneration as hallmark of mitochondrial atp production revealed correlation to activity of complex ii / iii of the respiratory chain and to demographic values .
pcr and pi kinetics were not influenced by rhuepo administration .
our results confirm mitochondrial dysfunction and exercise intolerance due to impaired oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle tissue of frda patients .
mrs did not show improved mitochondrial bioenergetics after eight weeks of rhuepo exposition in skeletal muscle tissue of frda patients .

introduction friedreich ataxia ( frda ) is the most common inherited ataxia among caucasian populations .
clinically , frda is determined by progressive ataxia of gait and extremities , dysarthria and areflexia [ 1 ] .
muscle weakness is evident particularly in the lower limbs [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , though signs of weakness or fatigue may be masked by more prominent features of ataxia .
frda is a caused by a gaa trinucleotid expansion in intron 1 of the frataxin gene [ 4 ] leading to reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin .
frataxin is critically involved in iron sulfur cluster assembly , respiratory chain activity and iron homeostasis within mitochondria [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
the pathological cascade in frda is not solely restricted to the nervous system .
besides , muscle tissue especially cardiac muscle but also skeletal muscle show decreased frataxin expression and impairment of the respiratory chain [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
reduced skeletal muscle adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) production and mitochondrial dysfunction could be demonstrated earlier by magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( mrs ) [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
furthermore mrs was used for monitoring therapeutics in frda [ 11 ] .
recombinant human erythropoietin ( rhuepo ) has shown to up - regulate frataxin levels in - vitro and in - vivo [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
moreover , decrease in oxidative stress [ 15 ] and changes in mitochondrial function [ 16 ] have been reported after rhuepo application in frda .
phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31p mrs ) offers a non invasive investigation of human skeletal muscle bioenergetics by monitoring relative and absolute changes of phosphocreatine ( pcr ) , inorganic phosphate ( pi ) and adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) during incremental exercise and recovery [ 17 ] .
atp production in skeletal muscle tissue relies on three main sources .
in absence of sufficient oxygen supply atp synthesis is dependent on pcr and glycolysis , whereas mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation ( oxphos ) requires oxygen and substrates such as pyruvate or fatty acids [ 18 ] .
during exercise pcr decreases continuously until oxygen supply is increased sufficiently and adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) can be provided for rephosphorylation of pcr [ 19 ] .
particularly pcr regeneration after exercise is an indicator for mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle [ 20 ] .
aim of the present study was to investigate mitochondrial function of skeletal muscle tissue in frda patients and to examine effects of rhuepo application .

study design frda patients received 3,000 international units ( iu ) rhuepo ( roche , switzerland ) thrice weekly over a study period of 8 weeks .
31p mrs was carried out before and after rhuepo treatment .
biochemical measurements of respiratory chain activity and frataxin levels were performed in skeletal muscle tissue pre - and post rhuepo treatment .
the " scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia " ( sara , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] was used for monitoring clinical changes .
safety was assessed by red blood cell count and blood pressure in two weekly intervals .
31p mrs protocol to avoid confounding effects all frda patients underwent 31p mrs before muscle biopsy .
mrs was carried out performing one exercise cycle each for both legs .
the exercise bench consisted of a pedal ergometer that was connected to a piston and an air - pressure - powered cylinder [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] .
stable power output during one increment was assured by a regulation software that recorded continuously force , distance and frequency during pedal movement [ 27 ] .
the protocol consisted of measurements at rest and during exercise increments at 1 , 2 , 4 and 6 w. mrs was carried out on a 1.5 tesla whole body mr scanner ( magnetom magnetom avanto , siemens erlangen , germany ) , using a circular polarized double resonator surface coil that permits the receipt of 1h resonances at 63.5 mhz and 31p resonances at 25.8 mhz .
the diameter of the transmitter coil was 21 cm and the diameter of the receiver coil 14 cm. a free induction decay sequence with a repetition time of 1000 ms , an echo time of 0.13 ms , a flip angle of 90degrees , 10 averages and an acquisition time of 10 s was applied .
the nuclear overhauser enhancement ( noe ) was applied to all mrs measurements [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
the signal was received from the calf that was fixed on the double resonator coil .
31p mrs data analyses spectroscopic measures were processed using the commercial software package as provided by the manufacturer ( siemens erlangen , germany ) .
the peak areas of pcr , pi and atp were fitted in the frequency domain .
additionally , the position of the peaks of pcr and pi were determined .
absolute concentrations of pcr and pi were calculated using atp as an internal standard by assuming an atp concentration of 8.2 mmol / l [ 30 ] .
intracellular ph was calculated from the chemical shift of pi based on following equation [ 31 ] : delta : chemical shift of the pi peak in parts per million ( ppm ) relative to pcr .
the time constants tau and deltass values , meaning the difference between baseline and steady - state levels , were calculated for pcr and pi for each incremental workload by using a non - linear regression analysis in r for windows ( the r foundation for statistical computing , gnu general public license , boston , usa ) as previously reported [ 32 ] .
for that purpose , the last integral of the preceding increment or rest phase was considered as baseline integral for the following increment .
the time constants tau and deltass values were calculated by using the equation [ 23 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 33 ] : pcr0 / pi0 : baseline value deltapcr ( t )/ deltapi ( t ) : pcr / pi value at the time ( t ) deltapcrssdelta / piss : difference between baseline value and the estimated steady - state level the coherence between the mono - exponential model and the data of each subject is described by a coefficient of determination r2 [ 23 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 33 ] : a coefficient r2 above 0.4 was considered as an acceptable fit , whereas a coefficient r2 below 0.4 indicated a weak agreement with the mono - exponential model and were not used for calculation of time constants .
biochemical analyses biochemical analyses were performed from skeletal muscle specimens obtained by open muscle biopsy after local anaesthesia .
skeletal muscle biopsy was performed after mrs at the right gastrocnemius muscle at baseline and at the left gastrocnemius muscle after rhuepo treatment , respectively .
skeletal muscle tissue was immediately snap - frozen after biopsy in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 70 degrees celsius until analysis .
biochemical analyses included nadh - coq - oxidoreductase ( complex i ) , succinat / cytochromc - oxidoreductase ( complex ii / iii ) , cytochromc - oxidase ( complex iv ) and citratsynthase ( cs ) .
frataxin levels in skeletal muscle tissue were quantified pre - and post rhuepo treatment by electrochemiluminescence assay as previously reported [ 7 ] , [ 34 ] .
statistical analysis statistical analyses were carried out using spss 17.0 statistical software ( chicago , illinois ) .
continuous data are shown as mean values with standard deviation .
measurements were taken from both legs in each patient and control subject and analysed separately .
non parametric tests were used throughout the analyses due to a skewed distribution assessed by shapiro - wilk test of most obtained data .
wilcoxon test was applied for assessing differences in time constants and absolute concentrations in dependence to rhuepo exposure .
for comparison to the control subjects mann - whitney - u test was used .
anova for repeated measurements was applied for evaluating the time course of pcr , pi and ph. correlations of quantitative variables were assessed by pearson bivariate correlation analyses .
two - tailed p values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant .
results the mrs protocol consisted of measurements during resting state , incremental exercise ( plantar flexion ) and recovery after maximal exhaustive exercise .
analyses in 7 frda patients ( corresponding to 14 leg analyses ) and 8 age - matched controls ( corresponding to 16 leg analyses ) were included in the present study .
quantification of metabolites at rest revealed elevated absolute levels of pi ( p = 0.010 ) in frda patients , while pcr concentrations were similar ( p = 0.714 ) in patients and control subjects .
frda patients showed ph values of 7.04 +/ - 0.03 in resting skeletal muscle , which is comparable to healthy controls ( 7.05 +/ - 0.04 ; p = 0.449 ) .
compare table 1 for absolute concentrations of metabolites .
at exercise abruption absolute concentrations of pcr and pi were similar in frda patients and healthy controls .
pi increased in both groups ( frda : 11.65 +/ - 4.43 , controls : 12.97 +/ - 1.58 ; p = 0.837 ) , while pcr levels declined in parallel ( frda : 22.89 +/ - 8.36 , controls : 18.51 +/ - 3.03 ; p = 0.205 ) .
frda patients , however , showed earlier exercise abruption in terms of successfully managed increments as compared to controls .
whereas all healthy control subjects completed increment 1 and 2 with both legs ( 16 / 16 ) , 6 out of 14 frda legs showed progressive pcr breakdown within increment 1 and 4 legs within increment 2 respectively .
terminal pcr breakdown does not lead to steady state conditions and was therefore not considered for calculation of time constants .
at exercise abruption , however , controls ( 6.95 +/ - 0.08 ) and patients ( 6.99 +/ - 0.15 ; p = 0.948 ) showed similar ph - values independent from individually performed exercise increments , which allows for comparison of time constants in the recovery phase [ 18 ] , [ 35 ] .
compare table 1 for details .
pcr and pi time course during incremental exercise during repetitive plantar flexion subsequent decrease in pcr levels was obtained in frda patients ( p < 0.001 ) .
frda patients showed lower steady state levels of pcr compared to the control group ( p = 0.002 ) as indicated by increased deltapcrss values ( 23.94 +/ - 12.89 vs. 13.14 +/ - 5.88 in controls ) in increment 1 .
time constant tau was exceeded in the frda group , although these values did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.298 ) .
after rhuepo exposure pcr time constants tau ( p = 0.249 ) and deltapcrss ( p = 0.917 ) did not differ to baseline values ( see table 2 ) .

in accordance with pcr depletion pi increase ( p < 0.001 ) could be detected in frda patients during incremental exercising .
pi time constants tau ( p = 0.011 ) and deltapiss were exceeded in frda , accounting for increased and prolonged accumulation of pi in relation to controls .
pi increase in frda was obtained irrespective of rhuepo administration ( tau : p = 0.401 ; deltapiss p = 0.484 ) .

time course of phosphocreatine ( pcr ) and inorganic phosphate ( pi ) are shown during exercise in increment 1 and recovery period after maximal exhaustive exercise .

values are given as a function of time ( x ) in percentage of changes in pcr and pi from baseline of the respective increment ( 100 %) and are based on the asymptotic exponential regression model pcr and pi time course during recovery period during the recovery period regeneration of pcr ( p < 0.001 ) , progressive loss of pi ( p < 0.001 ) and changes in ph ( p = 0.108 ) were detected .
time for reaching steady state conditions of pcr was prolonged in frda as shown by increased pcr time constant tau ( p = 0.002 ) .
moreover , decreased steady state of pcr resynthesis ( deltapcrss , p = 0.054 ) could be detected in frda as compared to control subjects .
pi decline in frda patients showed both increased time constant tau ( p < 0.001 ) , as well as increased steady state conditions of pi ( deltapiss , p = 0.002 ) .
no significant changes in pcr and pi kinetics were found during the recovery period after administration of rhuepo ( see figure 3 ) .

pcr and pi time constants ( t ) and steady state levels ( ss ) are given during exercise and recovery as a comparison of frda patients before ( frda baseline ) and after ( frda rhuepo ) erythropoietin stimulation to healthy control subjects .
values are shown as mean and standard deviation .
for absolute values compare table 2 . correlation analysis biochemical analyses of the respiratory chain , mrs measurements as well as frataxin levels [ 7 ] showed correlation to patients' demographical data at baseline .
change in pcr values of the recovery phase correlated significantly between the left and right leg ( r = 0.661 , p = 0.002 ) .
moreover , deltapcrss of the recovery period showed an indirect correlation with sara score ( r = - 0.832 , p < 0.001 ) and number of repeats ( r = - 0.649 ; p = 0.016 ) and therefore direct correlation to age of onset of disease ( r = 0.611 ; p = 0.026 ) .
in contrast , neither pi time constants of the recovery period nor during incremental exercise showed a correlation to demographic and clinical data in frda .
frataxin levels measured in skeletal muscle tissue lacked correlation to deltapcrss values of the recovery period before ( r = 0.453 , p = 0.366 ) and after ( r = 0.354 , p = 0.491 ) rhuepo treatment .
on the level of biochemical analyses of the respiratory chain sara score correlated indirectly with the activity of complex ii / iii ( r = - 0.927 , p = 0.003 ) and complex iv ( r = - 0.927 , p = 0.003 ) , whereas complex i and sara score did not show any correlation ( r = - 0.360 , p = 0.427 ) .
furthermore complex ii / iii showed a direct correlation with deltapcrss values of the recovery period ( r = 0.872 ; p = 0.024 ) and pi concentration at termination of exercise ( r = 0.853 , p = 0.031 ) .
moreover , absolute concentrations of pcr ( r = - 0.834 , p = 0.039 ) and pi ( r = 0.884 , p = 0.019 ) at exercise abruption correlated with complex iv respiratory chain activity .
discussion in this study we investigated the oxidative energy metabolism of the calf muscles in frda patients by 31p mrs using a rest - exercise - recovery protocol .
compared to an age - and sex - matched healthy control group we found lower steady state levels of pcr and increased accumulation of pi during incremental plantar flexion in frda .
after maximal exhaustive exercise frda patients showed prolonged time constants and decreased steady state of pcr recovery .
pcr time constants after exercise reflect mitochondrial atp production via oxphos and are valuable indicators for mitochondrial function [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] .
our results are therefore in line with earlier studies showing deficient atp production in skeletal muscle of frda patients in a regular maintenance state [ 10 ] and after ischemic exercise [ 9 ] .
during incremental work load accumulation of pi was excessive in frda patients , leading to earlier activity induced ischemia and abruption of exercise .
exercise intolerance is a well known feature of mitochondrial myopathies [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
moreover , mitochondrial dysfunction detected by mrs is also found in mitochondrial diseases without clinical evidence of myopathy [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .
histopathological findings in frda skeletal muscle reveal a mixed neurogenic / myopathic atrophy pattern with only subtle mitochondrial features [ 41 ] .
along with reduced frataxin expression in skeletal muscle tissue [ 7 ] our spectroscopy data suggest primary involvement of skeletal muscle in frda patients even without pathological hallmarks of mitochondrial myopathy .
the extent of mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle in the present study correlated to steady state levels of pcr during regeneration , whereas no correlation was found to demographic and genetic values .
this is in contrast to previous mrs studies in frda showing a direct correlation between the maximum rate of pcr recovery and gaa repeats of the shorter fxn allele [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
the lack of correlation in our series is probably due to a different study population including a broader frda phenotype and advanced disease stages .
severe gait disturbance and immobilisation are prone , as seen in healthy humans , to result in reduction of mitochondrial density in skeletal muscle [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] .
primary mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle may therefore be aggravated as a consequence of muscle atrophy in advanced disease stages .
impaired frataxin expression in frda skeletal muscle has been shown only recently [ 7 ] .
thus , its impact on oxidative stress markers in muscle has not been investigated until now .
moreover , it has not been explored whether frataxin up - regulation in response to rhuepo exposure has an impact on mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle .
besides epo 's well known function as a regulator of red blood cell production , epo is critically involved in tissue damage , cell apoptosis and metabolic stress [ 45 ] .
epo is thereby thought to exert cytoprotective effects by inducing neovascularisation and enhancing trophic activity .
although an average of 45 % frataxin up - regulation was found in muscle tissue after rhuepo exposure in the present frda series [ 7 ] , rhuepo exposure had no significant impact on respiratory chain activity in muscle specimen [ 41 ] .
in line with the above - mentioned neuropathological and biochemical findings in muscle tissue , the present mrs measurements in skeletal muscle could not demonstrate benefit in mitochondrial oxphos after continuous rhuepo stimulation of eight weeks .
in principle , oxidative stress in frataxin deficient cells appears to be primarily related to disturbed mitochondrial iron metabolism [ 5 ] , [ 46 ] .
additionally , impaired formation of iron - sulfur clusters ( isc ) , especially isc - containing respiratory complexes i , ii , and iii , in frataxin deficient tissue increases oxidative stress through premature leakage of electrons and the generation of hydroxyl radicals reacting with fe2 + ( fenton reaction ) .
we found a correlation between impaired respiratory chain complex ii and iii activity in muscle tissue and pcr recovery , as well as to absolute concentrations of pi and pcr at exercise abruption .
this indicates 31p mrs measurements to be sensitive and valid for monitoring changes in respiratory chain activity , especially for therapeutic agents that improve respiratory chain activity [ 47 ] .
in analogy to cardiac muscle , 31p mrs of skeletal muscle in frda reveals evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired oxidative phosphorylation despite only subtle mitochondrial features were found in skeletal muscle biopsies .
this finding may , at least partially , explain progressive muscle weakness and fatigue in frda patients .
a relevant impact of rhuepo stimulation over 2 months on isc - containing respiratory complexes and atp was not detectable by 31p mrs .

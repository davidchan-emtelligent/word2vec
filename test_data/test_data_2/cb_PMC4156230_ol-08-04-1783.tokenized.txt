the standard treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) is sorafenib , a multikinase inhibitor of tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis .
hyperthermia inhibits angiogenesis and promotes apoptosis .
potential synergic antiangiogenic and proapoptotic effects represent the rationale for combining sorafenib with electro - hyperthermia ( ehy ) in hcc .
a total of 21 patients ( median age , 64 years ; range , 55 - 73 years ) with advanced hcc were enrolled in the current study between february 2009 and september 2010 .
ehy was achieved by arranging capacitive electrodes with a deep hypothermia radiofrequency field of 13.56 mhz at 80 w for 60 min , three times per week for six weeks , followed by two weeks without treatment , in combination with sorafenib at a dose of 800 mg every other day .
according to the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors criteria , 50 % achieved stable disease , 5 % achieved partial response and 45 % achieved progressive disease .
no complete response was observed .
the progression - free survival ( pfs ) rate at six months was 38 % , while the median pfs and overall survival times were 5.2 [ 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) , 4.2 - 6.2 ) and 10.4 ( 95 % ci , 10 - 11 ) months , respectively .
the overall incidence of treatment - related adverse events was 80 % , predominantly of grade 1 or 2 .
grade 3 toxicity included fatigue , diarrhea , hand - foot skin reaction and hypertension .
in the present study , the sorafenib plus ehy combination was feasible and well tolerated , and no major complications were observed .
the initial findings indicated that this combination offers a promising option for advanced hcc .
carcinoma electro - hyperthermia hepatocellular sorafenib introduction hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) is the sixth most common type of neoplasm and the third most frequent cause of cancer - related mortality in western countries ( 1 ) .
the barcelona clinic liver cancer ( bclc ) strategy is a classification which stratifies patients according to prognosis , providing a link to treatment .
patients with advanced hcc ( bclc stage c ) exhibit cancer - related symptoms [ symptomatic tumors ; eastern cooperative oncology group ( ecog ) grades 1 - 2 ] , including macrovascular invasion ( segmental or portal invasion ) or extrahepatic spread ( lymph node involvement or metastases ) which carry a poor prognosis , with a predicted median survival time of six months or survival rate of 25 % at one year .
the standard treatment for advanced hcc ( bclc stage c ) is sorafenib , an oral multikinase inhibitor that inhibits the following : i ) serine - threonine kinases , raf - 1 and b - raf , of the raf / mek / erk signaling pathway ; and ii ) the receptor tyrosine kinase activity of vegfr1,2 and 3 , pdgfr - beta , c - kit , flt - 3 and ret ( 2,3 ) .
sorafenib inhibits tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis , and increases the rate of apoptosis in a number of tumors ( 4 ) .
in two randomized clinical trials [ sorafenib hcc assessment randomized protocol trial ( sharp ) and asia pacific liver cancer study ] , sorafenib treatment resulted in longer median survival time and time to progression ( ttp ) in advanced hepatocellular cancer when compared with the placebo ( 5,6 ) .
electro - hyperthermia ( ehy ) , also known as oncothermia or extracellular hyperthermia , is a method of locoregional hyperthermia , established by the direct absorption of an electric field energy in the extracellular liquid with a subsequent temperature gradient between the extra - and intracellular compartments ; this gradient destroys cancer cell membranes , leading to necrosis or apoptosis .
as the conductivity and the dielectric constant of the extracellular matrix in malignant tissue are higher than in the normal tissue , this technique results in selective tumor tissue destruction .
for this reason , energy absorption at the applied frequency is significantly increased .
furthermore , malignant cells typically exhibit relatively rigid membranes due to increased phospholipid concentrations , therefore , ehy is likely to selectively destroy malignant cells prior to affecting the healthy cells .
ehy increases apoptosis ( producing membrane heat shock proteins ) , blocks further proliferation , terminates tumor cell dissemination ( re - establishing the adherent connections ) and increases immunogenicity .
ehy is a complementary treatment in various types of tumors , such as brain , soft tissue , liver and abdominal , pancreatic , and head and neck tumors ( 7 ) .
hyperthermia inhibits angiogenesis through endothelial cell ( ec ) damage and increases pai - 1 genetic expression in ecs ( 8 ) .
several pharmacodynamics ( including the acceleration of the primary mode of action and an increased intracellular drug concentration ) and pharmacokinetics ( for example drug uptake , distribution , metabolism and excretion ) interactions have been described between drugs and temperature .
the cytotoxic effect of the majority of alkylating agents ( including cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide ) and platinum compounds are linearly enhanced with increasing temperature from 37 to > 40degreesc .
conversely , doxorubicin appears to have a defined temperature threshold , whilst the majority of antimetabolites ( such as 5 - fluorouracil ) , as well as vinca alkaloids and taxanes , show no dependency to hyperthermia ( 9 ) .
in certain animal models , several drugs ( including kb - r8498 , flavone acetic acid , vinblastine and combretastatin ) have been observed to induce a temporary reduction in tumor blood , but only in combination with hyperthermia significant tumor responses ( 10 ) .
the potential synergic antiangiogenic and proapoptotic effects are the rationale for combining sorafenib and ehy for the treatment of hcc ( 11,12 ) .
the present study evaluated the efficacy and safety of this combination in patients with advanced hcc in a phase ii study at the national cancer institute ' giovanni paolo ii ' ( bari , italy ) .
materials and methods a mono - institutional uncontrolled phase ii trial was conducted on advanced hcc patients .
the ethical committee of the national cancer institute ' giovanni paolo ii ' approved the protocol which was in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the 1975 declaration of helsinki .
written informed consent was obtained from each patient .
patient eligibility between february 2009 and september 2010 , 21 patients , comprising 14 ( 67 %) males and seven ( 33 %) females with a median age of 64 years ( range , 55 - 73 years ) , were enrolled in this study at the at the national cancer institute ' giovanni paolo ii ' .
patients with measurable , histologically confirmed and inoperable hcc who had not received prior systemic treatment for hcc were eligible for enrollment .
the inclusion criteria included age of >= 18 years ; eastern cooperative oncology group performance status of <= 2 ; child - pugh ( cp ) score of a or b ; life expectancy of >= 12 weeks ; adequate hematological status ( platelet count of >= 60x109 / l ; hemoglobin level of >= 8.5 g / dl ; and prothrombin time international normalized ratio of <= 2.3 or prothrombin time of <= 6 sec above the control ) ; adequate liver function tests ( albumin level of >= 2.8 g / dl , total bilirubin level of <= 3 mg / dl and alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels of <= 5 times the upper limit of the normal range ) and adequate renal function tests ( serum creatinine level of <= 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range ) .
hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) or hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection status at baseline were collected from the medical history or laboratory tests .
the patients were required to have at least one untreated target lesion that could be measured in one dimension , according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors ( recist ) ( 13 ) .
treatment and dose modifications patients received 400 mg sorafenib twice a day and ehy with capacitative electrodes with a deep hypothermia radiofrequency field of 13.56 mhz at 80 w for 60 min , three times a week for six weeks , followed by two weeks without treatment .
regional hyperthermia and thermal mapping were performed according to the european society of hyperthermic oncology guidelines for quality and safety assurance ( 14 ) .
locoregional deep - hyperthermia was performed using the oncotherm ehy - 2000 medical device ( oncotherm gmbh , traisdorf , germany ) .
a large , water - cooled bolus asymmetric electrode ( 30 cm in diameter ) was used .
sorafenib treatment interruptions and dose reductions ( initially 200 mg twice daily , then reduced to 200 mg once daily ) were allowed for drug - related toxicity , measured according to the national cancer institute common toxicity criteria ( v 3.0 ) ( 15 ) .
patients with dermatologic toxicities of grade 3 / 4 and patients with hematological toxicity of grade 3 received lower doses .
a dose delay was introduced for grade 4 hematologic toxicities and grade 3 non - hematologic toxicities , until toxicity was grade 2 or less ; patients were then treated at one dose level lower and therapy was discontinued if recovery time was three weeks or longer .
patients with drug - related grade 4 non - hematologic toxicities were removed from the study .
for hand - foot skin reaction ( hfsr ) , dose modifications based on prescribing information and 2008 consensus panel recommendations were used ( 16 ) .
treatment was continued until disease progression ( pd ) or unacceptable drug - related toxicities .
response assessment bidimensional tumor measurements were performed at baseline and every eight weeks ( one cycle ) , according to recist , by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging .
throughout the study , the lesions were measured at baseline and evaluated using the same technique .
overall tumor response was scored as a complete response ( cr ) , partial response ( pr ) or stable disease ( sd ) if the response was confirmed at least four weeks later .
the disease control rate ( dcr ) was the proportion of patients who had the best response rating of cr , pr or sd , according to recist , which was maintained for at least four weeks from the initial manifestation of that rating .
patient visits were scheduled every three weeks and at the end of treatment to monitor safety , compliance and determine side effects .
the safety assessment included documentation of the adverse events , clinical laboratory tests ( hematological and biochemical analyses ) , physical examination and measurement of vital signs .
statistical analysis this was an uncontrolled mono - institutional phase ii trial .
the primary endpoint of this trial was the progression - free survival ( pfs ) rate at four months .
the secondary endpoints were : overall tumor response ( cr , pr and sd ) , ttp ( initial treatment until pd ) and overall survival ( os ; initial treatment to mortality ) .
the two - stages of simon 's optimal design were used to test the null hypothesis ( h0 ) that the pfs rate at four months was 20 % against the alternative hypothesis ( h1 ) of 60 % with a sample size of 21 patients , this study had 80 % power and an alpha level of 0.01 .
ttp and os were estimated according to the kaplan - meier method .
all the analyses were performed using stata 11.0 ( stata corporation , college station , tx , usa ) .
results patient characteristics the baseline characteristics of the patients are shown in table i. initially , the ecog performance status was 0 in 11 patients ( 50 %) and 1 in 10 patients ( 50 %) .
all patients had documented background chronic liver disease and 17 of the 21 patients had a cp classification of a. considering viral infections , five patients were positive for hbv , 15 patients were positive for hcv and only one patient was positive for the two viruses , hbv / hcv .
the alpha - fetoprotein range was 1 - 108 ng / ml ( median , 41.6 ng / ml ) .
extrahepatic spread was present in only five patients ( three bone and two lung ) , while portal vein thrombosis was observed in 11 patients ( 50 %) .
dose and duration of therapy the median time of treatment was 4.5 months ( range , 2 - 7 months ) .
a total of 48.3 treatment cycles were administered ( mean , 2.3 cycles for each patient ; range , 1 - 3.6 ) and 11 patients ( 60 %) received 100 % of the planned study drug .
sorafenib was administered at a daily mean dose of 700 mg ( range , 600 - 800 mg ) .
for nine patients , the treatment was discontinued ( 45 %) due to pd. efficacy all patients were considered evaluable for the primary endpoint .
the pfs rate at four months was 70 % .
one patient ( 5 %) achieved pr and 11 patients achieved sd ( 50 %) ; however , no cr was reported .
the dcr was 45 % ( table ii ) .
ttp and os the median ttp was 5.2 months [ 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) , 4.2 - 6.2 months ] and the median os time was 10.4 months ( 95 % ci , 10 - 11 months ) ( figs. 1 and 2 ) .
toxicity all patients were evaluable for toxicity .
the overall incidence of treatment - related adverse events ( any grade ) was 80 % ( 18 patients ) .
the adverse events that were predominantly reported were grade 1 or 2 ; the most common adverse events were dermatologic , constitutional and gastrointestinal .
grade 1 and 2 toxicity included 20 % hyperemia , 25 % anorexia and 10 % vomiting .
grade 3 toxicity included fatigue ( 5 %) , diarrhea ( 5 %) , hfsr ( 10 %) and hypertension ( 5 %) .
no grade 4 treatment - related toxicities were reported .
discussion in this phase ii trial , the combination of sorafenib and ehy was well tolerated and showed noteworthy antitumor activity ; a four month pfs rate of 70 % was reported , with 50 % of patients achieving sd and 5 % achieving pr. the dcr was 45 % and the median ttp and os time were 5.2 and 10.4 months , respectively .
no grade 4 treatment - related toxicities were reported , while the most frequently reported grade 3 adverse events were similar to those reported in previous studies ( fatigue , diarrhea and hfsr ) ( 5,6 ) .
these results compare favorably with the sorafenib phase ii study conducted by abou - alfa et al ( 17 ) in patients with advanced hcc ; three ( 2.2 %) of the 137 treated patients achieved pr , eight ( 5.8 %) achieved a minor response and 46 ( 33.6 %) achieved sd for at least 16 weeks .
the ttp and os time were 4.2 and 9.2 months , respectively .
in the sharp phase iii trial , sorafenib was found to improve the os by 44 % in patients with hcc ( p = 0.0006 ) versus the placebo group ; the median os was 10.7 months in sorafenib - treated patients compared with 7.9 months in those administered with the placebo .
no significant difference was identified between the two groups in the median time to symptomatic progression ( ttsp ; 4.1 vs. 4.9 months , respectively ; p = 0.77 ) .
the median time to radiological progression was 5.5 months in the sorafenib group and 2.8 months in the placebo group ( p < 0.001 ) .
in total , 2 % of patients achieved pr and 71 % achieved sd. the dcr was 43 % .
the most commonly observed adverse events in patients receiving sorafenib were diarrhea , weight loss , hfsr and hypophosphatemia ( 5 ) .
in the phase iii asia - pacific liver cancer study , treatment with sorafenib was associated with a significantly longer os time ( median , 6.5 vs. 4.2 months for sorafenib and placebo , respectively ; hr , 0.57 ; 95 % ci , 0.42 - 0.79 ; p =. 0005 ) .
the median ttsp was 3.5 months .
a total of 3.3 % of patients achieved pr and 54 % achieved sd. the dcr was 35.3 % .
the most frequent grade 3 / 4 drug - related adverse events reported for sorafenib were hfsr ( 10.7 %) , diarrhea ( 6 %) and fatigue ( 3.4 %) ( 6 ) .
since sorafenib was found to improve os in these two phase iii trials , sorafenib became the standard of care for advanced hcc ; however , the benefits remain modest .
combining this drug with locoregional or systemic therapy may improve the outcome of advanced hcc patients .
as previously reported , experimental data for sorafenib indicate that hyperthermia inhibits angiogenesis and increases apoptosis .
furthermore , certain in vitro studies have shown that hyperthermia may alter the properties of metastatic potential in cancer cells and inhibit tumor metastasis due to the inhibition of hypoxia and tgf - beta1 - induced epithelial - mesenchymal transition in hepg2 hcc cells ( 17,19 ) .
the heat sensitivity of this tumor cell line decreases with rising percentages of the hepatic stellate lx - 1 cell line ( model of liver fibrosis ) in coculture ( 20,21 ) .
few studies have analyzed ehy treatment in hcc and the efficacy of targeted therapy plus ehy remains unknown .
breast cancer in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that mild hyperthermia sensitizes cancer cells to parp - 1 inhibitors ( 22,23 ) .
in our previously reported study , the feasibility and safety of combining a chemical treatment ( transarterial chemoembolization ) with a physical treatment ( radiofrequency ablation ) in patients with hepatic malignancies was investigated .
therefore , we further hypothesized that combining a chemical systemic drug with a physical locoregional treatment may exhibit a synergistic effect ( 24 ) .
in the current study , a phase ii trial was conducted in advanced hcc patients to evaluate whether ehy may potentiate the effect of sorafenib through reduction of angiogenesis and increased apoptosis .
these combinations act on the microenvironment of tumor cells .
the multikinase inhibitory profile of sorafenib leads to effects in cancer cells , as well as the ecs and pericytes of tumor vasculature .
first , ehy determines a energy absorption in the extracellular fluid and then , through a temperature gradient between the extracellular and the intracellular compartment , a destruction of tumor cells is observed ( 4,7 ) .
the results of the present study showed that the sorafenib plus ehy combination is feasible and well tolerated ; no major complications were observed .
the initial findings suggested that this combination offers a promising option for advanced hcc , representing a new and challenging area for future clinical study .
further large studies are required to confirm these preliminary results .

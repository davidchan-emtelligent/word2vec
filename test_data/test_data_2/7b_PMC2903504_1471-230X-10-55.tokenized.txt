background abnormalities of cell cycle regulators are common features in human cancers , and several of these factors are associated with the early development of gastric cancers .
however , recent studies have shown that gastric cancer tumorigenesis was characterized by mucin expression .
thus , expression patterns of cell cycle - related proteins were investigated in the early phase of differentiated - type gastric cancers to ascertain any mechanistic relationships with mucin phenotypes .
methods immunostaining for cyclins d1 , a , e , and p21 , p27 , p53 and beta - catenin was used to examine impairments of the cell cycle in 190 gastric intramucosal differentiated - type cancers .
mucin phenotypes were determined by the expressions of muc5ac , muc6 , muc2 and cd10 .
a ki - 67 positive rate ( pr ) was also examined .
results overexpressions of p53 , cyclin d1 and cyclin a were significantly more frequent in a gastric phenotype than an intestinal phenotype .
cyclin a was overexpressed in a mixed phenotype compared with an intestinal phenotype , while p27 overexpression was more frequent in an intestinal phenotype than in a mixed phenotype .
reduction of p21 was a common feature of the gastric intramucosal differentiated - type cancers examined .
conclusions our results suggest that the levels of some cell cycle regulators appear to be associated with mucin phenotypes of early gastric differentiated - type cancers .
background progression through the cell cycle and cellular proliferation are under the control of a series of cyclins and cyclin - dependent kinase ( cdk ) complexes [ 1 - 3 ] .
accumulating evidence shows that the progression of tumorigenesis frequently involves abnormalities in the expressions of cyclins and other cell - cycle related genes [ 1 - 3 ] .
abnormalities have been found for cyclins d1 , a , e and their co - operating partners , such as cyclin - dependent kinase ( cdk ) , that promote cell cycle progression [ 1,3 ] .
additionally , these progressive factors can be inhibited by blockers , such as p21 , p27 and p57 , and another group of inhibitor proteins , including p16 , p15 and p18 [ 4 - 10 ] .
the uncontrolled proliferation that characterizes tumor cells can be largely explained by the gain and / or loss of protein functions that comprise the cell cycle .
regulation of these cell cycle - related proteins is also governed by other factors , including p53 and beta - catenin , and their alterations also impair the cell cycle , resulting in uncontrolled proliferation [ 11 - 15 ]. of the above cell cycle - related proteins , key regulators of progression through the g1 phase of the cell cycle are cyclin d1 and cyclin e , p53 , p21 and p27 [ 1,4,6,12 ] .
their abnormal expressions have been thought to play pivotal roles in the progression of tumorigenesis and have been found to be disturbed in a number of human malignancies .
cyclin a is also a member of the cyclin protein superfamily that can be activated during the transition from the g1 to the s phase of the cell cycle .
abnormal expressions of cyclin a are correlated with poor outcomes in various human cancers [ 8,9 ] .
in addition , nuclear expression of beta - catenin is implicated in gastrointestinal cancers [ 14,15 ] .
beta - catenin accumulates in the nucleus due to impairments of the wnt signal pathway , and its nuclear expression promotes progression of the cell cycle and cellular proliferation [ 14,15 ] .
however , to date , its activity has not been shown to affect the pathogenesis of early differentiated - type gastric cancers .
recent studies have shown that cellular mucin expressions and tumor phenotypes are associated with the clinico - pathological findings and tumorigenesis in differentiated - type gastric cancers [ 16 - 19 ] .
the mucin phenotypes of tumors have been primarily classified into 3 types : gastric , intestinal and mixed phenotypes [ 16,17 ] .
the gastric phenotype is characterized by poor outcomes , distinct histological features and a specific subtype of genetic alterations , including microsatellite instability ( msi ) [ 17,18 ] .
in contrast , the intestinal phenotype is a very well differentiated type , with low proliferative activity and a lack of msi [ 17 ] .
the expressions of mucins by tumor cells define tumor characteristics in gastric cancers [ 16 - 19 ] .
thus , it is important for the understanding of early tumorigeneis of gastric cancers to examine biological alterations according to these mucin phenotypes [ 16 - 19 ] .
although a number of studies regarding the expressions of cell cycle - related factors have been reported [ 3 - 7 ] , the associations of early differentiated - type gastric cancers and their mucin phenotypes and alterations of cell - cycle - related proteins are not fully understood .
in the present study , we examined abnormalities of cell cycle - related proteins of the early phase of differentiated - type gastric cancers based on mucin phenotypes .
methods patients materials for this study were obtained from 190 patients with primary early gastric cancers that were diagnosed at the division of molecular diagnostic pathology , department of pathology , iwate medical university , morioka , japan .
informed consent was given in all patients that we examined .
in addition , our study was approved by our ethics committee ( title , molecular analysis of gastrointestinal tumors and the surrounding mucosa ; reference number , h21 - 140 , ethics committee of iwate medical university ) .
these tumors were consistent with intramucosal differentiated - type cancers , and were obtained from samples of endoscopic submucosal dissection ( esd ) .
the histological criteria used to make histological diagnoses were based on our hospital criteria [ 16 ] , which were modified from those of the japanese research society for gastric cancers [ 20 ] , as discrepancies in histological judgments exist between japanese and western pathologists .
detailed clinico - pathological data ( patient age , sex , site of tumor , tumor size , macroscopic type and degree of tumor differentiation ) are shown in additional file 1 .
in this study , intramucosal differentiated - type cancers were sub - classified into 3 groups according to the tumor nuclear grade : low , intermediate or high .
the tumor grade was determined according to previously published criteria [ 17 ] .
in brief , low - grade cancer was diagnosed by the presence of cells with enlarged , hyperchromatic nuclei that were largely confined to the basal portions of the cells , but that had more irregular and complex glands than gastric adenomas .
tumors that contained cells having an obvious loss of polarity , high nuclear irregularity , enlarged nucleolus and hyperchromatin were classified as high - grade cancers .
the high grade cancers often showed significant architectural atypia , such as high architectural or glandular distortions .
intermediate findings between low and high - grade cancers were recognized as intermediate cancers .
however , the histological distinction between gastric adenoma and low - grade cancer was sometimes very difficult .
the slides were independently evaluated by 2 experienced pathologists ( s. t. and n. s. ) ; in some cases in which the evaluations provided different results , a consensus interpretation was reached after re - examination .
immunohistochemistry immediately after excision , specimens were fixed in 20 % neutral buffered formalin , embedded in paraffin wax , cut into 3 mum paraffin sections and stained with haematoxylin and eosin ( he ) for routine light microscopy .
for immunohistochemical staining , additional 3 mum thick sections were cut from paraffin - embedded tissue and placed on poly - l - lysine - coated glass slides .
in brief , sections were deparaffinized in xylene and dehydrated .
for the determination of mucin phenotypes , immunostaining was done for muc 2 ( ccp58 , novocastra laboratories , newcastle , uk ) , cd10 ( 56c6 , novocastra laboratories ) , muc 5ac ( clh2 , novocastra laboratories ) and muc 6 ( clh5 , novocastra laboratories , newcastle , uk ) .
in addition , immunostaining was done for p53 ( clone , do7 , dako , carpinteria , ca , usa ) , ki - 67 ( mib - 1 , dako ) , p21 ( sx118 , dako ) , p27 ( sx53g8 , dako ) , cyclin d1 ( sp4 , nichirei co. , tokyo ) , cyclin e ( 13a3 , novocastra laboratories ) , cyclin a ( 6e6 , novocastra laboratories ) and beta - catenin ( bd , transduction laboratories ) .
immunohistochemistry used the dako envision + system , consisting of dextran polymers conjugated with horseradish peroxidase ( dako ) , as previously described [ 16,17 ] .
the specimens were heated by microwave in citrate buffer ( ph 6.0 ) 3 times for 5 min each at 750w before the reactions with antibodies ( h2500 , microwave processor , bio rad , usa ) , as previously described [ 16,17 ] .
hematoxylin was used as the counterstain .
evaluation of mucin expression in this study , gastric tumors were classified into 4 groups according to their immunostaining patterns .
a gastric phenotype was defined as tumors having predominant intracytoplasmic mucin of the gastric type , as determined by immunostaining with human gastric mucin ( muc5ac ) and / or pyloric gland mucin ( muc6 ) , but with no muc - 2 positive cells .
an intestinal phenotype was indicated by a tumor showing muc2 - positive cells and / or cd10 positive ( along with a brush border ) .
these tumors were differentiated to small intestinal absorptive cells .
intestinal phenotype tumors were sub - classified into 2 groups : colonic type ( positive for muc 2 only ) and small intestinal type ( positive for cd10 ) .
a mixed phenotype was defined as a tumor having immunostaining consistent with gastric type ( positive cells for muc5ac and / or pyloric gland mucin ) as well as intestinal type mucin ( positive cells for cd10 and / or muc2 ) .
finally , tumors without immunostaining for either gastric or intestinal phenotypes were assigned to an " unclassified " type .
immunopositive results for > 5 % of the tumor cells were regarded as positive , and immunopositive results for < 5 % as negative , in accordance with previous reports [ 16,17,21 ] .
measuring the ki - 67 positive rate ( pr ) random areas from each sample were selected in which to count ki - 67 positive nuclei .
the ki - 67 positive rate was calculated as the percentage of ki - 67 positive tumor cell nuclei determined in 10 high - power fields ( hpf , x 400 ) , which was determined after counting at least 500 tumor cells per tumor sample .
tumor proliferative activity was classified into 2 groups : high and low .
the proliferative activity was determined according to our criteria [ 16,17 ] .
in brief , pr of the tissue was measured in both the tumor tissue and its surrounding non - neoplastic tissue .
high proliferation was considered if pr was higher in the tumor tissue than in the non - neoplastic tissue .
low proliferation was judged if pr was lower in the tumor tissue than in the non - neoplastic tissue .
immunohistochemical assessment of cell cycle - related proteins the proportion of tumor cells per section was assessed by eye and allocated a score as summarized in additional file 2a .
a total of 500 cells were counted in random fields from representative areas of the lesion .
for all markers , only nuclear staining was considered positive .
the staining intensity was estimated on a 5 - point scale ( 0 to 6 +) and a score was allocated according to the intensity ( additional file 2b ) .
the staining index was a simple multiplicative product of the cellularity and staining scores .
next , high expression for tumor cells was recorded if the staining index was higher in the tumor cells than in its surrounding non - neoplastic tissue .
in contrast , low expression for tumor cells was recorded if the staining index was lower or equal in the tumor cells than in the non - neoplastic tissue .
for example , a representative figure is shown in figure 1 .
the original criteria were described previously [ 22 ] , and the present criteria were used with minor modifications .
two sections were stained and values were based on the mean of the 2 individual results .
figure 1 example of gastric intramucosal differentiated - type cancer .
whereas the index score for cyclin d1 expression is 16 in the gastric cancer mucosa ( b ) , the score is 4 in its surrounding non - neoplastic mucosa ( a ) .
the tumor that is shown in figure 1b is regarded as well differentiated adenocarcinoma by japanese pathologists , although this tumor is considered gastric adenoma or dysplasia by western pathologists .
statistical analysis results are given as median or mean values .
statistical analysis used the tamhane test for comparisons among 3 groups and chi - square tests for comparisons between 2 groups .
statistical significance was established at the p < 0.05 level .
results clinico - pathological characteristics as shown in additional file 3 , of the 190 gastric intramucosal differentiated - type cancers , 23 ( 12.1 %) were of the gastric phenotype , 85 ( 44.7 %) were the intestinal phenotype and 79 ( 41.6 %) were classified as mixed phenotypes .
only 3 ( 1.6 %) tumors were of the unclassified type .
clinico - pathological findings based on the mucin phenotypes are also listed in additional file 3 .
there were no significant differences for age , tumor size , location , microscopic type or histological type between the 3 phenotypes .
however , for the gastric and mixed phenotypes , the incidences of high grade tumors were significantly higher for the gastric and mixed phenotypes than the intestinal phenotype ( p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 , respectively ) .
in addition , the male / female ratio for the mixed phenotype was ower than for the other types ( p < 0.05 ) .
in the present study , gastric phenotypes were classified into 3 sub - phenotypes : muc5ac (+)/ muc6 (+) , muc5ac (+)/ muc6 ( - ) and muc5ac ( - )/ muc6 (+) .
fifteen ( 65.2 %) had the muc5ac (+)/ muc6 (+) pattern , 5 ( 21.7 %) had the muc5ac (+)/ muc6 ( - ) pattern and 3 ( 13.1 %) were subclassified as the muc5ac ( - )/ muc6 (+) pattern .
among the 3 gastric sub - phenotypes , no clinicopathological differences were found .
in contrast , intestinal phenotypes were sub - divided into small intestinal ( n = 67 ) and colonic ( n = 18 ) phenotypes .
there were no significant differences between them for age , tumor size , location , macroscopic type or histological type .
expressions of cell cycle - related proteins by mucin phenotypes no p53 overexpression was found in any surrounding non - neoplastic mucosa .
overexpression of p53 was observed in 33 of 190 cases that we examined ( 17.4 %) , and was more frequently seen in the gastric phenotype ( 10 / 23 , 43.5 %) compared with the other 2 types ( intestinal phenotype , 13 / 85 , 15.3 % and mixed phenotype , 9 / 79 , 11.4 %) .
although the difference between the gastric and intestinal phenotypes did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.054 ) , the gastric and mixed phenotypes did show a significant difference ( p < 0.05 ) .
in addition , no p53 overexpression was found in low - grade cancers ( 0 / 26 ) .
in contrast , p53 was overexpressed in 11 of 103 intermediate - grade cancers ( 10.7 %) and 22 of 61 high - grade cancers ( 36.1 %) .
significant differences between high - grade cancer and low - grade or intermediate - grade cancers were found ( p < 0.01 ) .
p21 was primarily expressed in the superficial epithelium of the intestinal metaplastic gland and the gastric foveolar epithelium .
the frequency of reduced p21 expression was 59 of 190 tumors ( 31.1 %) .
reduced p21 expression was commonly observed in the gastric , intestinal and mixed phenotypes .
there was no significant difference for reduced p21 expressions between the 3 phenotypes .
expression of p27 was confined to the superficial epithelium and the base of the intestinal metaplastic gland .
the frequency of reduced p27 expression was very low in the gastric cancers that we examined ( 12 / 190 , 6.3 %) .
in contrast , the frequency for p27 overexpression was observed in 53 of 190 tumors ( 27.9 %) .
the frequency of p 27 overexpression was higher in the intestinal phenotype ( 31 / 85 , 36.5 %) than in the gastric ( 6 / 23 , 26.1 %) and mixed phenotypes ( 16 / 79 , 20.2 %) .
however , these differences were not significant .
cyclin d1 was expressed at the lower half of the intestinal metaplastic gland .
in the gastric cancers examined , 27 of 190 cases ( 14.2 %) showed overexpressed cyclin d1 .
cyclin d1 was overexpressed in the gastric phenotype for 7 of 23 cases ( 30.4 %). by comparison , overexpression of cyclin d1 was found in 11.8 % ( 10 / 85 ) and 12.7 % ( 10 / 79 ) of the intestinal and mixed phenotypes , respectively .
no significant difference was found between the gastric phenotype and the other types .
expression of cyclin a was primarily confined to the lower half of the intestinal metaplastic gland .
positive staining for cyclin a was detected in 42.1 % ( 80 / 190 ) .
the frequency of cyclin a overexpression was higher in the gastric phenotype ( 16 / 23 , 69.6 %) than in the intestinal phenotype ( 25 / 85 , 29.4 % ; p < 0.01 ) .
however , no significant difference was found between the gastric and mixed phenotypes ( 39 / 79 , 49.4 %) .
non - neoplastic glands were mostly negative for cyclin e. in the gastric cancers examined , the frequency of cyclin e overexpression was very low .
no significant difference between the 3 mucin phenotypes was seen .
in this study , only the nuclear expression for beta - catenin was regarded as positive .
no nuclear expression of beta - catenin was observed in the surrounding non - neoplastic mucosa , except for pyloric glands .
most pyloric glands expressed nuclear beta - catenin .
nuclear beta - catenin expression was found in 80 of 190 tumors ( 36.8 %) .
although the intestinal phenotype ( 44 / 85 , 51.8 %) showed the highest frequency for nuclear beta - catenin among the 3 phenotypes , the difference was not significant .
a high proliferation rate of tumor cells was shown in more than 30 % ki - 67 pr in most of the gastric cancers that we examined .
according to our criteria , high proliferation was found in 101 of 190 tumors ( 53.2 %) .
high proliferation of tumor cells was more frequently observed in the gastric and mixed phenotypes compared with the intestinal phenotype ( p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 ) .
we have summarized these results for cell cycle - related proteins based on mucin phenotype in figure 2 .
in addition , a representative example is shown in figure 3 .
figure 2 frequencies of cell cycle - related protein expressions in gastric , intestinal and mixed phenotypes .
gastric phenotype cancers are characterized by p53 and cyclin a overexpressions .
although the frequency of p27 overexpression between the intestinal phenotype and other phenotypes did not reach statistical difference , this may be characteristic of the intestinal phenotype .
reduction of p21 and accumulation of beta - catenin are commonly observed in the 3 phenotypes .

discussion in spite of a decreasing trend in incidence , gastric cancer remains an important medical problem throughout the world , and it is the most common neoplasm in japan .
intramucosal cancer is defined as a tumor at the most early stage of gastric cancer .
it is essential to examine intramucosal cancer for evaluating the pathogenesis of gastric cancer .
it is widely accepted that a cancerous cell arises due to abnormalities of cell cycle regulation , which is comprised of several cell cycle - related proteins , such as cyclins , cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor , p53 and beta - catenin .
in addition , recent studies have shown that distinct clinico - pathological findings for gastric cancer are characterized by mucin expressions .
we studied abnormal expressions of cell cycle - related proteins that promote gastric carcinogenesis based on mucin phenotypes in gastric intramucosal differentiated - type cancers .
in the present study , immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the expression levels of cell cycle - related proteins .
immunopositivity for cell cycle - related proteins of tumor tissue was determined by comparing the levels between tumor tissue and its surrounding non - neoplastic tissue .
according to these criteria , the level of immunopositivity of tumor tissue may differ for each case .
however , separating the parameters within these cancers into " low " and " high " categories based on comparisons of these factors with non - neoplastic tissue may be an unconventional method .
the " non - neoplastic " tissue includes gastritis ( chronic or chronic active ) and / or intestinal metaplasia ; the parameters in these various inflammatory or metaplastic tissues could vary considerably .
it may be more meaningful to use an absolute rate ( i.e. , the actual %) , rather than this internal relative value .
however , we consider that this immunohistochemical criterion is important for finding the potential activities of cell cycle - related proteins at an early stage of gastric differentiated - type cancers , given that the non - neoplastic tissue surrounding tumor tissue is closely associated with tumor development .
it has been believed among pathologists that the gastric phenotype of gastric cancer shows low - grade atypia in gastric intramucosal differentiated - type cancers ( 19 ) .
however , in the present study , in the gastric intramucosal differentiated - type cancers that we examined , the gastric phenotype showed high - grade atypia .
although the reason remains unknown , one possible reason is that a gastric phenotype showing low - grade atypia , which resembles gastric foveolar epithelium histologically , may have been included in previous studies .
in the present study , only one such tumor was observed .
in addition , these differences could be due to the number of samples or to ethnic or etiologic factors .
it is well known that p53 overexpression is correlated with tumor grade .
in the present study , we suggest that it is reasonable to show a high frequency of p53 overexpression for the gastric phenotype when compared with other phenotypes .
in this study , p53 overexpression was more frequently found in the gastric phenotype than in the intestinal or mixed phenotypes .
this finding suggests that p53 overexpression plays an essential role , at least in the early development of gastric phenotype cancer , although previous studies have shown progressive increases in p53 overexpression in gastric cancers from the early to advanced stages [ 12 ] .
in this study , reduced p21 expression was observed in approximately 30 % of the 3 mucin phenotypes .
previous studies have shown that low expression of p21 is correlated with patient prognosis in gastric cancer [ 5,6 ] .
however , little is known regarding p21 expression by gastric cancers based on mucin phenotypes .
in addition , any association of p21 expression with tumor stage ( tumor depth ) remains unknown .
our finding suggests that reduced p21 expression plays a common role in the early development of the 3 mucin phenotypes of gastric differentiated - type cancers .
however , a previous study suggested that a progressive decrease of p21 expression occurred in an advanced phase of gastric differentiated - type cancer from the early phase [ 6 ] .
p21 expression also correlated with the expressions of other cell cycle - related proteins , such as p27 and ki - 67 , possibly through a p53 - dependent pathway [ 1,5,6 ] .
it has been hypothesized that p21 co - operates with p53 and , as a result , the cell cycle is controlled through a p53 - dependent pathway [ 1,5 ] .
furthermore , it is believed that p21 is also inhibited by co - operation with p27 [ 1,5 ] .
in the present study , however , we found neither a correlation of p21 reduction with p27 reduction nor an inverse correlation of p27 reduction with p53 overexpression ( data not shown ) .
we suggest that a different pathway exists for controlling the cell cycle in human gastric cancers .
it is well known that p27 is a prototypical tumor suppressor gene [ 1 - 3 ] .
however , a recent study has shown that , whereas in some cases , p27 inhibits the cell cycle , in other cases it promotes progression to the next phase of the cell cycle [ 23 ] .
it has been reported that either a loss or a low expression of p27 is correlated with tumor progression or patient prognosis [ 24,25 ] .
in contrast to other studies , we showed that low expression ( reduction ) of p27 had a very low frequency in our series of gastric cancers .
according to the present findings , reduced p27 expression plays a minor role in the development of differentiated type gastric cancers .
in contrast , overexpression of p27 was frequently found in the intestinal phenotype compared with the other 2 phenotypes , although the difference between them did not reach a statistically significant level. whether or not this overexpression of p27 is associated with cell cycle inhibition or cell cycle progression is not known , although several explanations are suggested .
first is that p27 that is overexpressed for suppression of cell cycle progression in tumor cells results from a negative feedback mechanism .
conversely , a second explanation is that overexpression of p27 is positively associated with the progression of the cell cycle for tumor cells ; that is , p27 acts as an oncogenic factor [ 23 ] .
in addition , a recent study has shown that expression of p27 is regulated by expression of skp2 , which is a ubiquitin ligase subunit of p27 [ 26 ] .
according to this report , expression of p27 was inversely correlated with skp2 expression .
cyclin d1 overexpression only showed a low frequency in the early stage of gastric differentiated type cancers ( 27 / 190 , 14.2 %) .
however , although the differences did not reach a significant level , the frequency of cyclin d1 overexpression was higher in the gastric phenotype than in the intestinal and mixed phenotypes .
cyclin d1 was previously studied in several series of gastric cancers , with a reported frequency of 20 ~ 56 % of overexpression being reported [ 27 - 29 ] , different from our results .
as a possible reason for these differences of cyclin d1 overexpression , although early differentiated - type cancers , except for gastric phenotype , do not require an increase of cyclin d1 , once the tumor has developed , the tumor cells need a high level of cyclin d1 for tumor progression .
this suggests that cyclin d1 overexpression is correlated with patient prognosis in gastric cancers [ 28 ] .
overexpression of cyclin a was also more prevalent in the gastric and mixed phenotypes compared with the intestinal phenotype .
this suggests that overexpression of cyclin a plays a major role in tumorigenesis of gastric and mixed phenotypes .
thus , in gastric cancers , acquisition of gastric mucin expression may be associated with cyclin a overexpression , which then results in high tumor proliferation .
in addition , cyclin a was closely associated with patient prognosis or tumor aggressiveness [ 8,9 ] .
this may indicate that cyclin a overexpression is related to both tumor development and progression in approximately half of differentiated - type gastric cancers .
in the present study , cyclin e overexpression showed low frequencies in the 3 phenotypes .
in contrast , previous studies have shown that cyclin e overexpression was correlated with poor outcome [ 4,10 ] , although contrasting results have been suggested [ 30 ] .
the present results indicate that cyclin e overexpression plays no essential role in the early tumorigenesis of differentiated - type gastric cancers .
in addition , overexpression of cyclin e may primarily promote the progression of gastric cancers .
these findings suggest that the high proliferation of the gastric phenotype may be characterized by the overexpression of cyclin d1 and / or cyclin a , and that the mixed phenotype is associated with cyclin a overexpression .
it is well known that beta - catenin expression upregulates the cell cycle and plays a central role in the wnt signal transduction pathway [ 14,15 ] .
in the present study , it is interesting to note that beta - catenin expression was commonly observed in the early differentiated - type gastric cancers that we examined .
it is already accepted that beta - catenin expression is critical for colonic adenoma development [ 31,32 ] .
the present results and previous studies regarding colorectal adenoma indicate that beta - catenin expression may be a common alteration in the early development of gastrointestinal tumors [ 31 ] .
this could be explained by the findings that , in gastric cancers , gene promoters associated with the wnt signal pathway are highly methylated [ 32 - 34 ] , which results in the nuclear accumulation of beta - catenin expression .
conclusions in summary , we propose that the cellular mucin phenotypes of intramucosal differentiated - type adenocarcinomas of the stomach are dependent on distinct cell cycle - related alterations , and that the clinico - pathological findings result from different pathways based on mucin expression : gastric , intestinal and mixed phenotypes .
figure 4 illustrates a novel carcinogenesis model for intramucosal differentiated - type adenocarcinomas that relies on their mucin phenotypes .
based on abnormalities of cell cycle - related proteins , overexpressions of p53 and cyclin a characterize gastric phenotype cancers , whereas overexpression of p27 may be associated with the development of intestinal phenotype cancers .
in contrast , mixed - phenotype cancers are characterized by cyclin a overexpression .
in addition , mucin phenotypes appear to be characterized by nuclear grade and cell proliferative activity .
three of 190 tumors were of the unclassified type , and this tumor molecular characteristic is not identified .
finally , little is known regarding the distinct molecular alterations that are involved in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer .
further studies will be necessary to address this question .

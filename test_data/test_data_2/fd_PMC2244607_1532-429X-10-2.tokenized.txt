aims to investigate the association between admission hyperglycemia and myocardial damage in patients with st - segment elevation myocardial infarction ( stemi ) using cardiac magnetic resonance ( cmr ) .
methods we analyzed 113 patients with stemi treated with successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention .
admission hyperglycemia was defined as a glucose level >= 7.8 mmol / l. contrast - enhanced cmr was performed between 3 and 7 days after reperfusion to evaluate left ventricular function and perfusion data after injection of gadolinium - dtpa .
first - pass images ( fp ) , providing assessment of microvascular obstruction and late gadolinium enhanced images ( de ) , reflecting the extent of infarction , were investigated and the extent of transmural tissue damage was determined by visual scores .
results patients with a supramedian fp and de scores more frequently had left anterior descending culprit artery ( p = 0.02 and < 0.001 ) , multivessel disease ( p = 0.02 for both ) and hyperglycemia ( p < 0.001 ) .
moreover , they were characterized by higher levels of hba1c ( p = 0.01 and 0.04 ) , peak plasma creatine kinase ( p < 0.001 ) , left ventricular end - systolic volume ( p = 0.005 and < 0.001 ) , and lower left ventricular ejection fraction ( p = 0.001 and < 0.001 ) .
in a multivariate model , admission hyperglycemia remains independently associated with increased fp and de scores .
conclusion our results show the existence of a strong relationship between glucose metabolism impairment and myocardial damage in patients with stemi .
further studies are needed to show if aggressive glucose control improves myocardial perfusion , which could be assessed using cmr .
introduction admission hyperglycemia is associated with increased short and long term risk of death in patients with st - segment elevation myocardial infarction ( stemi ) , independently of the presence of diabetes mellitus [ 1 - 3 ] ; this increased mortality might be explained by a higher incidence of congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock [ 2,4 ] .
moreover , a recent study suggested an association between admission hyperglycemia and the no - reflow phenomenon as assessed by myocardial contrast echocardiography [ 5 ] .
in contrast , the association between hyperglycemia and the extent of myocardial infarct size is less clear [ 6 - 8 ] .
cardiac magnetic resonance ( cmr ) with a gadolinium - based contrast agent is considered to accurately assess myocardial perfusion and function abnormalities after stemi .
first pass ( fp ) perfusion provides a valuable assessment of the extent of microvascular obstruction ( mo ) [ 9 ] , and late gadolinium enhancement ( de ) reflects the extent of myocardial infarction [ 10,11 ] .
however , no data are available on the relationship between admission glycemia and cmr data in the setting of stemi .
the objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between blood glucose levels taken on admission and myocardial perfusion parameters assessed by contrast - enhanced cmr in patients after reperfusion of an acute stemi .
methods study population one hundred and thirty one consecutive patients presenting with a first acute stemi and who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci , angiography and / or stenting ) for arteries exhibiting thrombolysis in myocardial infarction ( timi ) flow grade < 3 , within 24 hours after symptom onset , were included in the study .
patients with timi flow < 3 on the culprit lesion after pci , or who were hemodynamically unstable or with a contraindication for cmr were excluded from the study .
the diagnosis of stemi was based on prolonged chest pain , st - segment elevation >= 2 mm in at least two contiguous electrocardiographic ( ecg ) leads , and a more than three fold increase in serum creatine kinase ( ck ) levels [ 12,13 ] .
fourteen patients with a timi flow < 3 post - pci and 4 patients with contraindications for cmr were excluded from the study therefore , the study population consisted of 113 patients ( 91 men and 22 women , mean age 57 +/ - 14 years ) .
all participants gave written consent before entering the study , in accordance with a protocol approved by the institutional ethics committee .
data collection demographic data , age , gender , body mass index ( weight / height2 , kg / m2 ) , clinical history of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , smoking , previous pci and / or coronary artery bypass graft and peripheral arterial disease were recorded as were on - admission clinical data ( killip class , ecg and hemodynamic parameters ) .
heart failure was defined by killip class > 1 .
location of mi was determined according to ecg , coronary angiographic and cmr data ; no discordance was observed between the 3 methods .
current treatment before hospitalization was also recorded .
blood samples were taken at admission to measure glucose and c - reactive protein levels .
hba1c , hdl - cholesterol , ldl - cholesterol and triglyceride levels were assessed from fasting blood sample taken on the first morning after admission .
peak plasma levels of creatine kinase ( ck ) were also evaluated and dichotomized at ten times the upper normal limit for more clinical relevance .
baseline serum creatinine clearance was also evaluated by the cockcroft - gault formula [ 14 ] .
cmr protocol patients were examined 3 to 7 days after stemi .
contrast - enhanced cmr was performed on a 1.5 t whole - body mr imager ( magnetom vision , siemens gmbh , erlangen , germany ) , using a phased array body coil .
left ventricular ( lv ) long - axis scout images were obtained to determine the orientation of the lv short axis imaging planes .
for lv function evaluation , cine - cmr was performed using a breath - hold ecg - gated gradient echo sequence ( flash 2d ) , with the following acquisition parameters : repetition time ( tr ) 9 ms , echo time ( te ) 4.4 ms , pulse flip angle ( alpha ) 15degrees , 9 lines per segment , field of view ( fov ) of 350 to 400 mm. the acquisition matrix varied from 108 x 256 , ( 12 cardiac cycles ) , to 144 x 256 , ( 16 cardiac cycles ) , depending on the ability of patient to hold his breath .
a series of short - axis slices ( thickness of 5 mm with a gap between slices of 10 mm ) was defined from the base of the heart to the apex [ 15 ] .
the image of the heart was taken into account at end - systole and end - diastole times .
a temporal resolution of 50 ms was obtained with the " view - sharing " technique [ 16 ] .
for lv perfusion evaluation , a first - pass ecg - gated gradient echo sequence was performed ( t1 - weighted turboflash sequence ) after injection of a bolus of gadolinium - diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid ( magnevist , schering - ag , berlin , germany ) into a brachial vein at 0.1 mmol / kg ; the acquisition parameters were as follows : inversion time ( ti ) 400 ms , tr 3.5 ms , te 1.7 ms , fov 350 to 400 mm , and acquisition matrix 96 x 128 , interpolated to 256 x 256 .
a time delay buffer at the end of the sequence was adjusted in order to acquire one image every two cardiac cycles .
three to 5 short - axis slices were obtained from the base of the heart to the apex , with the same plane as for the functional study ( thickness of 12 mm with a gap between slices of 3 mm ) ( figure 1 ) [ 17 ] .
figure 1 short - axis gradient - echo cmr images at basal ( a ) , mid - ventricular ( b , c ) and distal ( d ) levels , during first pass of a bolus of gadolinium - dtpa , showing a localized microvascular obstruction in the antero - septal territory .
ten minutes after bolus injection , delayed images were acquired using a segmented t1 - weighted inversion - recovery turboflash sequence [ 18 ] , with the following parameters : tr = 2 cardiac cycles ; te = 3.4 ms ; alpha = 25degrees ; fov = 350 mm ; acquisition matrix = 165 x 256 , interpolated to 256 x 256 , with a variable ti adjusted for each patient studied in order to optimize the nulling of normal myocardium [ 19 ] .
this time delay was usually about 250 ms ( figure 2 ) .
the image planes were the same as for functional and first - pass studies ( thickness of 8 mm with a gap between slices of 7 mm ) .
figure 2 short axis basal ( a ) , mid - ventricular ( b , c ) and distal ( d ) segmented inversion recovery gradient echo mr images 10 minutes after bolus injection of gadolinium - dtpa , showing a large region of myocardial damage ( hyperenhancement surrounding region of persistent hypoenhancement ) in the antero - septal territory ( same patient than figure 1 ) .
cmr data analysis a 17 - segment model was used for the data analysis of perfusion studies [ 20 ] .
left ventricular end - diastolic volume ( edv ) and end - systolic volume ( esv ) were calculated from short - axis views using a method previously described [ 15 ] .
left ventricular ejection fraction ( lvef ) was calculated with the following formula : lvef = ( edv - esv )/ edv .
for each patient , perfusion data were analysed and visual scores were independently attributed by two expert investigators blinded to clinical data .
these scores were given according to the signal intensity observed on early images ( first - pass images : fp ) for 16 segments ( the apical segment was not evaluated on early images , because no long axis slice was obtained ) , and late images ( delayed enhanced images : de , 10 minutes after injection ) for each of the 17 segments ( vertical and horizontal long - axis slices made it possible to evaluate the apical segment ) .
early regional hypoenhancement and late regional hyperenhancement were scored with a scheme based on the transmural extent of contrast enhanced tissue within each segment ( 0 = no hypo or hyperenhancement ; 1 = 1 - 25 % hypo or hyperenhancement ; 2 = 26 - 50 % hypo or hyperenhancement ; 3 = 51 - 75 hypo or hyperenhancement ; 4 = 76 - 100 % hypo or hyperenhancement ) .
the two scores , fp , which reflects microvascular obstruction and de , which reflects myocardial infarct size , were determined by calculating the sum of the scores of all of the segments ( 16 for fp , 17 for de ) .
thus , the scores ranged from 0 to 64 for fp , and from 0 to 68 for de images [ 21 ] .
some areas , known as no - reflow zones , have major micro - vascular damage and are characterized by a persistent hypoenhanced area even on delayed images [ 22 ] .
thus , the observers were requested to include the no - reflow zones in the extent of infarction ( de score ) .
concordance between expert investigators was satisfactory ( interobserver variability < 5 %) .
in cases of disagreement , the final decision was taken by consensus .
statistical analysis continuous data were expressed as median ( 25th percentile - 75th percentile ) and dichotomous data as numbers ( percentages ) .
patients were categorized according to the median values of fp and de scores .
comparison between groups was made using the student t test or the mann - whitney test for continuous variables and the chi square test for discrete variables .
admission glycemia was dichotomized according to presence of hyperglycemia .
hyperglycemia was defined as glucose levels on admission of >= 7.8 mmol / l ( 140 mg / dl ) , in accordance with the guidelines of the american diabetes association [ 23 ] .
patients were also categorized according to the presence of hyperglycemia at admission , with regard to cmr data .
multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to test for independent predictors of high perfusion scores (> median value ) .
the following variables , with a p value of less than 0.1 on univariate analysis were included in the models : left anterior descending culprit artery , multivessel disease , timi 0 or 1 before pci , hyperglycemia , hba1c , peak ck level , esv and lvef .
moreover , age and sex were also included in the models .
the spearman rank test was performed to analyse the relationship between glycemia and perfusion scores .
all the tests were two - sided and a p value < 0.05 was considered as significant .
statistical analysis was performed with sigmastat version 2.3 ( statistical software , spss inc , usa ) .
results determinants of microvascular obstruction ( fp score ) characteristics of the patients according to the median value of the fp score are shown in tables 1 and 2 .
patients with high fp score (> median ) more frequently had left anterior descending culprit artery ( p = 0.02 ) , multivessel disease ( p = 0.02 ) and hyperglycemia ( p < 0.001 ) than patients with low fp score .
moreover , the level of hba1c ( p = 0.01 ) , peak ck ( p < 0.001 ) , esv ( p = 0.005 ) and de score ( p < 0.001 ) were higher in patients with a high fp score .
in contrast , lvef was lower in the group with a high fp score ( p < 0.001 ) .

multivariate analysis showed that peak ck ( odds ratio [ or ] 4.2 ; 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] 1.6 - 11.1 ; p = 0.004 ) and hyperglycemia ( or 3.8 ; 95 % ci 1.4 - 9.9 ; p = 0.007 ) were independent predictors of high ( supra - median ) fp scores .
however , when de score was included in the multivariate model , only de remained an independent predictor of high fp score ( table 3 ) .
table 3 cmr data according to admission hyperglycemia .
all values are expressed as median ( 25th - 75th percentile ) without hyperglycemia ( n = 61 ) with hyperglycemia ( n = 52 ) p fp score 4 ( 0 - 8 ) 10 ( 5 - 16 ) < 0.001 de score 11 ( 6 - 19 ) 18 ( 14 - 26 ) < 0.001 lvef (%) 53 ( 43 - 59 ) 50 ( 43 - 56 ) 0.38 edv ( ml ) 148 ( 125 - 170 ) 142 ( 117 - 173 ) 0.23 esv ( ml ) 69 ( 55 - 84 ) 68 ( 51 - 95 ) 0.85 de = delayed - enhancement ; edv = end diastolic volume ; esv = end systolic volume ; fp = first pass ; lvef = left ventricular ejection fraction .
determinants of myocardial infarct size ( de score ) patients with high de scores (> median ) had increased risk of left anterior descending culprit artery ( p < 0.001 ) , timi 0 or 1 before pci in culprit artery ( p = 0.003 ) and hyperglycemia ( p = < 0.001 ) ( tables 1 and 2 ) .
hba1c ( p = 0.04 ) , peak ck ( p < 0.001 ) , edv ( p = 0.01 ) , esv ( p < 0.001 ) and fp score ( p < 0.001 ) were also increased in this group .
in contrast , lvef ( p < 0.001 ) was significantly decreased in patients with higher de scores .
multivariate analysis showed that hyperglycemia ( or 10.4 ; 95 % ci 2.8 - 40.3 ; p < 0.001 ) , left anterior descending culprit artery ( or 6.6 ; 95 % ci 1.7 - 25.4 ; p = 0.006 ) and peak ck ( or 19.2 ; 95 % ci 4.8 - 76.7 ; p < 0.001 ) were independent predictors of high de scores .
when fp score was included in the multivariate model , hyperglycemia , left anterior descending culprit artery , peak ck , and fp score remained independent predictors of high de score ( table 3 ) .
hyperglycemia and perfusion scores spearman rank correlation analysis showed a positive relationship between admission glycemia and perfusion scores ( r = + 0.34 and p < 0.001 for the fp score ; r = + 0.32 and p < 0.001 for the de score ) .
categorization of patients according to the presence of hyperglycemia showed that fp ( 4 [ 0 - 8 ] vs 10 [ 5 - 16 ] ; p < 0.001 ) and de scores ( 11 [ 6 - 19 ] vs 18 [ 14 - 26 ] ; p < 0.001 ) were higher in patients with hyperglycemia .
in contrast , there was no difference between the 2 groups for lvef ( 53 [ 43 - 59 ] vs 50 [ 43 - 56 ] % ; p = 0.38 ) , edv ( 148 [ 125 - 170 ] vs 142 [ 117 - 173 ] ml ; p = 0.23 ) and esv ( 69 [ 55 - 84 ] vs 68 [ 51 - 95 ] ml ; p = 0.85 ) .
discussion the major findings of the present study are that admission hyperglycemia , in the setting of an acute stemi , is associated with the extent of mo as assessed by cmr .
hyperglycemia was also an independent predictor of myocardial infarct size .
hyperglycemia and microvascular obstruction first - pass hypoenhancement is recognized as closely defining the extent of mo [ 24 ] , and is strongly associated with worse outcome after stemi [ 25 - 27 ] .
mo is a major factor involved in the development of the angiographic " no - reflow " phenomenon , and limits the benefits of reperfusion [ 28 ] .
mo may result from leukocyte entrapment in capillaries [ 29 ] , and from distal microembolization of platelets which aggregate and adhere to capillary walls following plaque rupture [ 30 ] .
in the present study , admission hyperglycemia was a predictive factor for the extent of mo , as assessed by the fp score .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to analyse the relationship between acute hyperglycemia and mo assessed by cmr , after successful reperfusion .
nevertheless , these findings are in agreement with those of iwakura et al , who investigated the impact of admission hyperglycemia and the no - reflow phenomenon , assessed by intracoronary myocardial contrast echocardiography immediately after successful reperfusion [ 5 ] .
they found that hyperglycemia was the strongest predictive factor for no - reflow .
the potential mechanisms involved in this relationship have yet to be elucidated .
even so , acute hyperglycemia is associated with increased platelet activation and fibrinolysis [ 31 ] , as well as plugging of capillaries by leukocytes [ 32 ] .
acute hyperglycemia may also attenuate endothelium dependent vasodilatation , and reduce collateral blood flow to the area at risk [ 33 ] .
moreover , hyperglycemia may reduce the impact of ischemic preconditioning , through the attenuation of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate - regulated k channel activation [ 34 ] .
all of these mechanisms could strongly interact to favor the development of mo. however , in our study mo was mainly related to myocardial infarct size ; which could partly explain the relation observed between hyperglycemia and mo. hyperglycemia and myocardial infarct size cmr , with late gadolinium enhancement is widely used to define infarct size .
extra - cellular contrast - agents accumulate in the myocardium due to increased capillary permeability oedema , increased extra - cellular space and slower kinetics in infarcted regions [ 24,35 ] .
one major finding of the present work was the close relationship between admission glycemia and the extent of myocardial infarction assessed by the de score , independently of pre - existing glucose metabolism ( hba1c ) or markers of myocardial infarct size ( peak ck value ) .
the impact of stress hyperglycemia on the extent of myocardial necrosis is not fully understood .
acute hyperglycemia may increase the inflammatory response during stemi , and could thus influence microvascular permeability and oedema [ 36 ] .
moreover , in a recent study , timmer et al found that , in patients with stemi , admission hyperglycemia was an important predictor of reduced epicardial flow in the infarct - related vessel before reperfusion therapy [ 37 ] .
they also suggest that acute rather than chronic hyperglycemia is more important in predicting timi flow in patients after pci .
finally , admission hyperglycemia may not only be the cause of more severe myocardial damage , but also its consequence .
large myocardial infarcts are more likely to cause excessive secretion of catecholamine , which affect fatty acids and glucose homeostasis [ 38 ] .
however , stress hyperglycemia is an imperfect marker of cardiac damage , as many other markers in addition to stress hormones contribute to glucose metabolism [ 2 ] .
study limitations follow - up data were not available in this study , which attenuates the impact of the study conclusion .
for evaluation of perfusion and late gadolinium enhancement , we did not use a real quantitative method but a semi - quantitative visual method to grade the extent of transmural myocardial damage [ 11,22 ] .
however , the 17 segment model , which has gained wide acceptance in scintigraphic myocardial perfusion imaging , is both easy to obtain and reproducible .
moreoever in a previous study we showed an excellent correlation and concordance between visual grading and planimetric evaluation of myocardial enhancement [ 21 ] .
the correlation between glycemia and perfusion scores , although significant , was weak .
this relation was consolidated by the analysis of determinants of supramedian perfusion scores ( table 1 ) .
however , the relationship between admission glycemia and fp or de parameter needs to be demonstrated in larger study population .
conclusion abnormal glucose metabolism is strongly associated with mo and the extent of myocardial infarct in successfully reperfused stemi , as assessed by cmr .
these results emphasize the interest of aggressive glucose control at the acute phase of stemi .
moreover , cmr could play a major role in evaluating the impact of glucose control on myocardial perfusion .

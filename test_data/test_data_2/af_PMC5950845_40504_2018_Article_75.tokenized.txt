metaphors allow us to come to terms with abstract and complex information , by comparing it to something which is structured , familiar and concrete .
although modern science is " iconoclastic " , as gaston bachelard phrases it ( i.e. bent on replacing living entities by symbolic data : e.g. biochemical and mathematical symbols and codes ) , scientists are at the same time prolific producers of metaphoric images themselves .
synthetic biology is an outstanding example of a technoscientific discourse replete with metaphors , including textual metaphors such as the " morse code " of life , the " barcode " of life and the " book " of life .
this paper focuses on a different type of metaphor , however , namely on the archetypal metaphor of the mandala as a symbol of restored unity and wholeness .
notably , mandala images emerge in textual materials ( papers , posters , powerpoints , etc. ) related to one of the new " frontiers " of contemporary technoscience , namely the building of a synthetic cell : a laboratory artefact that functions like a cell and is even able to replicate itself .
the mandala symbol suggests that , after living systems have been successfully reduced to the elementary building blocks and barcodes of life , the time has now come to put these fragments together again .
we can only claim to understand life , synthetic cell experts argue , if we are able to technically reproduce a fully functioning cell .
this holistic turn towards the cell as a meaningful whole ( a total work of techno - art ) also requires convergence at the " subject pole " : the building of a synthetic cell as a practice of the self , representing a turn towards integration , of multiple perspectives and various forms of expertise .
http :// dx.doi.org / 10.13039 / 501100003246nederlandse organisatie voor wetenschappelijk onderzoekbasyc 024.003.019 zwart hub issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 introduction : science as performative ontology as mcleod and nerlich ( 2017 ) point out in their editorial for this thematic series , metaphors are fundamental tools for thinking about and interacting with the world , and this also applies to metaphors emerging in synthetic biology discourse ( balmer & herreman 2009 ; hellsten & nerlich 2011 ; boldt 2016 ) .
although ( or rather , because ) this type of discourse is fairly technical , metaphors help us to come to terms with what is inherently abstract and complex , notably by comparing it to something which is familiar and concrete ( balmer & herreman 2009 ; hellsten & nerlich 2011 ; boldt 2016 ; mcleod & nerlich 2017 ) .
synthetic biology represents a turning point , moreover , for whereas twentieth - century life sciences research was bent on uncovering the elementary particles of life ( a trend which culminated in the massive production of genomics sequencing data , zwart 2012 ) , synthetic biology conveys a more holistic orientation , by focussing on convergence ( on the living cell as a systemic whole ) , but also by bringing multiple research fields together in the context of an overarching research program , a " gesamtwissenschaft " ( zwart 2018 ) .
furthermore , as tomita ( 2001 ) and others have claimed , the final objective and major challenge of contemporary synthetic biology is the production of a functioning and self - replicating synthetic entity : a synthetic cell ( also known as artificial cell or protocell ) .
mcleod and nerlich likewise consider the creation of synthetic cells as one of the main currents of synthetic biological research ( 2017 , p. 4 ) .
as an embedded philosopher , the author of this paper is involved in a synthetic cell project named basyc , an acronym which stands for building a synthetic cell.1 in the scientific summary of this project it is claimed that building a synthetic cell represents " one of the grand intellectual challenges of the 21st century " , raising scientific and technological , but also philosophical and ethical questions ( my italics ) .
the basyc project explicitly aims to address a " big " scientific and ontological question : " what is life ?" , and the grounding idea is that we can only really understand life when we are able to technologically reproduce it in vitro , in the form of a fully functional , self - replicating cell .
thus , basyc is not only a technoscientific endeavour , but also represents a case study in performative ontology .
precisely because synthetic cell projects are devoted to a hypothetical object ( to something which is inexistent and fictitious as yet ) , imaginative metaphors are bound to play a decisive role. and even the key signifier " cell " , one of the primordial terms of modern scientific biology as such , is definitely a metaphor , introduced by robert hooke in his science classic micrographia ( hooke 1665 ) .
the cells which he spotted in cork through his microscope reminded him of the rooms of monks in a monastery .
the " cell " signifier thus began its impressive discursive career as an image that was consciously transferred from the realm of human culture ( monastic architecture ) into the realm of organic nature (" metaphor " comes from muepsilontaualphaphiepsilonrhoepsiloniotanu and means : " to transfer " , " to carry across " in greek ) .
subsequently , this metaphor has been transferred back again from the biological realm into a number of technical domains , such as for instance electronics , giving rise to terms like " cell phone " , which is short - hand for " cellular electronic network " ( macdonald 1979 ) .
thus , the history of the cell - concept already points to a fascinating paradox .
on the one hand , as french philosopher of science gaston bachelard argued , modern science is decidedly " iconoclastic " ( bachelard 1947 , p .
77 ; bachelard , 1953 , p .
122 ) , i.e. bent on replacing images and imaginative explanations by tested , rational concepts and quantitative relationships ( measurement , equations , mathematical symbols and the like ) .
at the same time , scientists are prolific producers of powerful metaphorical images themselves ( from cells and the double helix in biology up to black holes and the big bang in astrophysics ) .
in other words , science is both a destroyer and a producer of metaphors .
this explains why , notwithstanding the iconoclastic tendency at work in scientific research , synthetic biology discourse is replete with metaphors .
this article explores the observation that , in scientific efforts to visualise the synthetic cell endeavour , one particular metaphor seems especially striking , namely the mandala metaphor : the tendency to represent synthetic cells with the help of mandala - like images ( zwart 2018 ) .
synthetic cell visualisations often take the form of circular - quadratic diagrams , with a nucleus and a spherical membrane , suggesting recovered wholeness , as carl gustav jung ( 1950 / 1959 ) argued .
according to jung , by suggesting unity and completion , mandalas compensate for disruptive , fragmented and chaotic features of the actual situation , and may even provide a visual aid or roadmap for researchers towards convergence , i.e. towards the development of a more comprehensive , holistic view .
this paper explores the role of mandalas ( as metaphors of wholeness ) in synthetic biology from a psychoanalytical ( more specifically : jungian - bachelardian ) perspective .
first , i will point out that the tension ( already indicated above ) between scientific iconoclasm and scientific iconogenesis , between destroying and producing images , goes back to a distinction already made by aristotle , but later taken up by jung ( 1911 / 1968 ) , namely between rational and imaginative thinking .
in fact , delbruck ( 1971 ) , one of the founding fathers of molecular life sciences research , claimed that contemporary life sciences convey an aristotelean view of life .
according to delbruck , the idea that the visual form ( phenotype ) of living beings is determined by a logical program ( genotype ) that realises itself in living organisms , is decidedly aristotelean .
this view of life was further elaborated by erwin schrodinger ( 1944 / 1967 ) , and eventually resulted in synthetic biology : the effort to build artificial systems that mimic biological cells , based on our understanding of the logos of life ( represented by the metaphor of the code ) .
subsequently , i will focus on the mandala metaphor as an archetype of recovered wholeness and completion , not only in the sense that a synthetic cell would be the final completion of a long and eventful journey of discovery ( beginning with the disclosure of the molecular structure of dna in 1953 ) , but also in the sense that this type of research may actually be regarded as a practice of " individuation " on the part of the scientific subject .
after fragmentation and specialisation , time has now come to put the pieces back together again , not only at the object pole of the knowledge process ( moving from the elementary particles of life to the cell as a recovered whole ) , but also at the subject pole ( shifting from specialisation to convergence and transdisciplinary research , even fostering the science - humanities dialogue ) .
at the same time , the mandala as a symbol of unity and wholeness may easily obfuscate instances of disruption , tension and conflict emerging in actual laboratory life .
aristotle on the form and formula of living beings aristotle ( 1980 , 192b ) defined nature as the non - artificial : that which is not produced by us. and yet , in principle , nature is intelligible for human beings .
according to aristotle , human beings are logical animals ( zetaῷomicronnu lambdaomicrongammaomicronnu ἔchiomicronnu ) and therefore able to discern the intelligible " logic " ( lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma ) pervading living nature .
this also applies to living beings .
aristotle regards them as composites of form and matter , so that human beings ( as logical animals ) are able to discern the form ( epsilonἶdeltaomicronsigma ) or formula ( lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma ) that constitutes a living being ( aristotle 1986 , 402a , 415b ) .
indeed , all living beings are realisations or actualisations ( ἐnutauepsilonlambdaepsilonchiepsiloniotaalpha , 412a ) of their formula or plan ( lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma , 412b , 415b ) .
therefore , max delbruck credited aristotle with having anticipated " the principle implied in dna " ( 1973 , p. 55 ) .
whereas the form ( epsilonἶdeltaomicronsigma ) of living beings corresponds with their phenotype ( their visual appearance ) , their plan or formula ( lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma ) corresponds with their genome : the molecular program that realises itself in a particular organism .
in short , the visual form or gestalt ( epsilonἶdeltaomicronsigma ) of a living being is the realisation of an inherent program ( lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma ) .
according to aristotle , this distinction between visual form ( epsilonἶdeltaomicronsigma ) and logical program ( lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma ) is also reflected in our understanding of living entities .
on the one hand , aristotle sees human understanding as a continuation of visual perception .
whereas our eyes perceive living entities as compounds of form and matter , our understanding is focussed on the form ( epsilonἶdeltaomicronsigma ) stripped of matter , so that thinking is a more abstract version of sense perception .
in other words , whereas perception focusses on external things ( pirhoalphagammamualphataualpha ) , the soul reflects on their inner images ( phialphanutaualphasigmamualphataualpha ) .
human understanding may also focus , however , on the formula or plan ( lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma ) of living beings .
seen from this perspective , aristotle argues , human understanding is comparable to reading letters ( gammarhoalphamumualphatauepsiloniotaomicronnu , 430a ) .
thinking in the sense of considering formula is comparable to mentally reading or writing a text .
thus , aristotle introduces a distinction between two types of thinking , namely thinking as considering images ( phialphanutaualphasigmamualphataualpha ) versus thinking as considering characters ( gammarhoalphamumualphataualpha ). and whereas the former focusses on the visual " form " ( epsilonἶdeltaomicronsigma ) , the latter is rather oriented towards discerning the " formula " or plan ( lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma ) that is realised in the actual organism .
aristotle explains the difference with the help of an example .
if we see a beacon , we initially recognise it as fire : an entity with a particular , recognisable , visual form ; until it begins to move , for then we realise that it actually is a signal signifying something ( for instance : the approach of a vessel ) .
thus , aristotle already makes a distinction between fire as a gestalt ( image ) and fire as a symbol , i.e. an element in an alphabet of signals , bearing a human signature .
in contemporary philosophy , notably in the work of psychoanalyst jacques lacan , this evolved into the distinction between the imaginary ( focussed on images or phialphanutaualphasigmamualphataualpha ) and the symbolic ( focussed on symbols or signifiers : on gammarhoalphamumualphataualpha ) .
carl gustav jung ( 1911 / 1968 ) likewise distinguished these two types of thinking .
while imaginative thinking builds on mental images ( aristotle 's phialphanutaualphasigmamualphataualpha ) , rational thinking is directed by concepts and arguments : by logic. and whereas imaginative thinking is associative and free - floating , rational thinking operates on the basis of linguistic , logical and mathematical principles ( and is therefore more demanding and exhausting , mentally speaking ) .
finally , whereas imaginative thinking is the oldest form of thinking ( more attuned to the spontaneous functioning of the human mind ) , rational thinking is a more recent acquisition , historically speaking .
important intellectual developments , ranging from the invention of reading and writing via scholasticism up to modern science have contributed to its current dominance .
but logical thinking has never completely replaced or erased imaginative thinking , so that the tension between both types of thinking ( between the imaginary and the symbolic ) continues to exist , even in contemporary technoscience as we have seen .
this distinction is also reflected in the history of biology as such , where we discern a shift of focus from the visual shape ( epsilonἶdeltaomicronsigma or appearance , which is the subject matter of morphology ) to the symbolic dimension ( i.e. the plan , the program , the code , the lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma of life ) .
whereas in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries scholarly inquiries were first and foremost oriented on exploring the visual , morphological form or structure of an organism , on the gestalt of living entities , as exemplified by the work of goethe ( 1817 / 1824 ) , contemporary biosciences rather focus on the codes and programs of living systems : on the symbolic or lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma dimension.2 according to gaston bachelard , this is quite in line with the " iconoclastic " tendency of modern laboratory science ( bachelard 1947 , p .
77 ; bachelard 1953 , p .
122 ) .
bachelard was a jung - adept who developed a psychoanalytical diagnostics of the natural sciences , focussing on chemistry , physics and biology .
on the one hand he emphasised modern science 's aversion against images and the imaginary , notably in the sense that scientific research challenges our narcissistic self - images ( the idea of human beings as something exceptional and unique ) and tends to disrupt imaginary ( e.g. mythological and religious ) worldviews .
although iconoclasm began as a religious concept , bachelard argues that it became a distinctive feature of modern science as well ( bachelard 1947 , p .
77 ; bachelard 1953 , p .
122 ) , most notably of the performative , experimental branches of research , whose objective is to understand nature or natural entities , not by letting nature be ( as in artistic meditation or poetic exaltation ) , but by actively transforming natural entities into something symbolical ( e.g. bio - chemical molecules and processes , captured in formula , symbols , equations and the like ) with the help of laboratory equipment ( technicity ) .
thus , the visible gestalt of a tree , for instance , is made intelligible for logical animals by reducing it to chemical letters and symbols ( co2 , h2o , c6h10o5 , etc. ). via symbolisation and literation , living beings are literally obliterated ( zwart 2016 ) : they disappear from view ; their visual form ( epsilonἶdeltaomicronsigma ) becomes eclipsed , while the focus of attention shifts to their plan or formula ( lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma ) .
the program of the life sciences of the twentieth century can be summarised as a shift of focus from form ( epsilonἶdeltaomicronsigma ) to formula ( lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma ) , and from the organism as a visible and tangible gestalt ( epsilonἶdeltaomicronsigma ) to life as a legible code ( lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma ) .
at the same time , bachelard emphasised that the imaginary ( the imaginative style of thinking ) cannot be repressed once and for all and will continue to resurge , even in scientific discourse .
scientists are prolific producers of images themselves , as we have seen , and prone to employ powerful metaphors to elucidate their abstruse ideas .
the code of life the understanding of living beings as realisations of a molecular program was also the grounding concept of quantum physicist erwin schrodinger in his science classic what is life ?
( schrodinger , 1944 / 1967 ). from a physics point of view , schrodinger argues , life seems something highly exceptional , aberrational even , compared to abiotic nature .
nature as such is under the sway of the entropy principle : the process of inevitable and relentless decay .
anything that is well - ordered and complex is transient and bound to return to dust .
how can something as complex , sophisticated and intricate as a living organism emerge , maintain and even reproduce itself in an entropic environment ?
life , for schrodinger , is " negative entropy " , i.e. the remarkable ability to withstand the pervasive , disruptive natural tendency towards pulverisation .
how is this possible ?
for schrodinger , life is possible because of the program or code ( aristotle 's lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma ) : the " genom " ( spelled without an e by schrodinger ) , an " aperiodic crystal " which carries a molecular " morse code " ( as schrodinger metaphorically phrases it ) that allows living cells to keep themselves in shape and even to replicate themselves .
this code consists of strands of letter - like elements or characters ( aristotle 's gammarhoalphamumualphataualpha ) which realise themselves in living organisms .
inspired by schrodinger 's vision ( zwart 2013 ) , watson and crick were indeed able to uncover the basic molecular logic of this code : the gammarhoalphamumualphataualpha ( a , c , g and t ) which constitute the nucleotide alphabet .
living cells are realisations of this program. and it is because of this logical program that human beings , as logical animals ( zetaῷomicronnu lambdaomicrongammaomicronnu ἔchiomicronnu ) are able to read the intelligible lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma pervading living nature , with the help of high - tech sequencing equipment .
in the final decades of the twentieth century , the research program ( unleashed by schrodinger 's book ) culminated in the human genome project ( hgp ). and now that the genomes of thousands of species have been sequenced , analysed , stored and published , another dialectical turn sets in , namely the shift from analysis to re - synthesis , from reading to rewriting ( zwart 2012 ) , from reductionism to holism and reconstruction ( moya et al .
2008 ) , in short : from genomics to synthetic biology as the new " frontier of science " ( ceccarelli 2013 ) .
in order to understand how cells operate , modern science initially aimed to analyse them , by disclosing the basic molecular components , the strands of symbols that orchestrate the functioning and self - replication of cells .
but how can we know that this process of analysis is really completed ?
the idea is that the only way to ascertain that we have managed to understand how living cells function , is to realise their program ourselves ( in vitro ) , by producing a synthetic cell ( russel et al. 2012 ; carrera & covert 2015 ; van den belt 2009 ) .
the development of a synthetic cell ( also known as artificial cell or protocell ) is expected to " illuminate the perennial question ' what is life ?'" ( rasmussen et al. 2017 ). and as murtas ( 2009 ) argues , the construction of artificial cells has now become a realistic option .
synthetic biology enables scientists to construct synthetic cells in a truly bottom - up fashion , moreover , by synthesising " all the essential biochemical mechanisms to yield a functionally and structurally understood self - replicating biosystem " ( murtas 2009 , p. 1292 ) .
such a project will produce " a deep understanding " of all cellular mechanisms and processes .
complex living cells produced in vivo ( as products of evolution ) raise the question whether all this complexity is really necessary for life , or whether cellular life can also be realised in human laboratories , involving much smaller degrees of complexity ( p. 1293 ) .
porcar et al .
( 2010 ) likewise argue that advances in dna synthesis and a better understanding of regulatory processes make the goal of constructing an artificial cell a realistic possibility .
they consider the construction of artificial life as one of the main scientific challenges of the synthetic biology era ( cf. tomita 2001 ) .
science metaphors research areas such as molecular life sciences and genomics , one could argue , reflect the modern scientific tendency towards iconoclasm .
living beings are reduced to strands of letter - like symbols that can be analysed and manipulated on computer screens .
at the same time , a plethora of images are produced by these sciences , and this includes the ubiquitous metaphor of the code : the tendency to refer to the logos - dimension of living beings ( to the computational output of sequencing machines ) as a " text " or a " code " : e.g. the " morse code " of life ( schrodinger ) , the " barcode " of life ( strauss , 2009 ) or the " language " of life ( collins 2011 ) .
the genome as the " program " of life has become a ubiquitous metaphor , even a cliche .
indeed , it seems impossible to speak comprehensively about the output of genomics sequencing machines without the use ( wittingly or unwittingly ) of metaphors .
as indicated , metaphors are words , phrases or images that are applied to something to which they are not literally applicable , indicating some kind of analogy or similarity .
it strikes me that , quite often , this involves the application of a term taken from the natural realm to something which rather belongs to the technological realm ( i.e. things produced by us ) , and vice versa .
for instance , if we compare a cathedral to a forest , or a forest to a cathedral , we are employing metaphors .
a metaphor is not only a replacement ( of one word by another ) , but also a condensation (" verdichtung " , psychoanalytically speaking ) , in the sense that a number of key features are captured and brought together by the image .
for example , if we call a forest a cathedral , we are emphasising features such as silence , darkness and the similarities between pillars and large trees .
" biobricks " ( hellsten & nerlich 2011 ) and " building blocks of life " are likewise metaphors .
a concrete , tangible human artefact (" brick ") is used to elucidate and condensate a complicated biological idea .
the genetic " program " is obviously a metaphor , transferred from computer research into biology ( from the technical into the natural , from in silico to in vivo ) .
considering the genome as the music score of life ( noble , 2008 ) is evidently metaphorical as well , and the same applies to the genome - as - a - map metaphor , employed during the press conference in june 2000 , when the draft version of the human sequence was proudly presented to the world .
synthetic biology is a research field replete with metaphors ( hellsten & nerlich 2011 ; mcleod & nerlich 2017 ) .
the synthetic or artificial cell has been referred to as the holy grail of synthetic biology : a metaphor imported from alchemy and christian mysticism .
in this contribution , however , i want to consider one particular metaphor , namely the synthetic cell as a mandala .
the mandala concept easily comes to mind whenever i see model versions of synthetic or artificial cells , inserted in academic papers or displayed on powerpoint slides during meetings and conferences ( zwart 2018 ) .
take for instance the following three examples of synthetic biological mandalas , more or less randomly selected from the literature .
figure 1 depicts an " artificial cell - based device " discussed by giovanni murtas ( 2009 ) ; fig. 2 is a " protocell " meant to mimic a biological cell and discussed by kamat et al .
( 2011 ) ; and fig. 3 was found on the website of the synthetic biology foundry.3 fig. 1 artificial cell - based device fig. 2 protocell fig. 3 synthetic biology foundry can such figures indeed be considered as mandalas ? and if so , how does the mandala concept contribute to our understanding of synthetic biology in general and synthetic cell endeavours in particular ?
in the next section , building on the work of carl gustav jung , i will explore the relevance of the mandala metaphor for current philosophical efforts to come to terms with synthetic biology as a converging research field .
life sciences mandalas a mandala ( sanskrit for circle or sacred circle ) , is a spherical - quadratic diagram .
according to jung , it is an archetypal symbol for unity or wholeness ( jung 1944 / 1968 , p .
27 ; jung 1950 / 1959 , p .
356 ) , a pattern of geometric shapes , contained within a circle or square ( or " squared circle ") , concentrically arranged and radiating from a centre .
it is a harmonious , symmetric image that is gradually constructed , guided by active imagination ( jung 1944 / 1968 , p .
96 ; jung 1950 / 1959 , p .
356 ) .
it contains everything and reveals how everything is related ( jung 1950 / 1959 , p. 357 ) .
it may be the ground - plan for a building ( a garden , a temple , a monastery courtyard , a city ) .
the ground - plan for the pantheon in rome for instance can be considered a mandala : a spherical - quadratic building that contains everything ( everything spiritual , as pan - theon means " all the gods ") ( fig. 4 ). fig. 4 ground plan pantheon a mandala is often used as a " yantra " ( literally : instrument or contraption ) : that is , as a visual aid in contemplative and meditative exercises ( jung 1950 / 1959 , p. 356 ) .
but it may also function as a roadmap for processes of reconciliation and individuation. by realising wholeness , a mandala compensates for the contradictions , conflicts and disorderliness of actual reality ( jung 1944 / 1968 , p .
27 ; jung 1950 / 1959 , p .
388 ) .
a mandala reflects and enables the transition from disorientation and confusion to order , balance and wholeness ( jung 1950 / 1959 , p. 360 ) .
the centre has special symbolic relevance and may contain a symbol , a sacred text or a healing substance ( phialpharhomualphakappaomicronnu ) .
a mandala is a coniunctio oppositorum ( a " union of opposites ") as jung calls it , for instance : light and darkness , a circle and a square ( cf. the pantheon ) , as well as of the rational and the spiritual , the symbolical and the imaginary , etc .
it is a symmetrical arrangement of seemingly disordered , contradictory and irreconcilable elements ( jung 1950 / 1959 , 388 ) .
as the archetype of cosmic wholeness , it often reflects the shape of an eye or an egg .
a mandala represents integration and homeostasis , but it is also the map or program for a long and difficult journey , with each layer representing a part of this journey ( towards wholeness or individuation ) .
the mandala is an " archetypal " or " cross - cultural " metaphor ( ceccarelli 2013 ) , moreover , and jung ( 1950 / 1959 and elsewhere ) provides an extensive , comparative iconographic mandala anthology to substantiate his conviction that , although mandalas are quite prevalent in particular spiritual practices such as tibetan buddhism , they can in principle be encountered in all cultural traditions and historical periods .
what is the connection between mandalas and modern science ?
first of all , jung commenced his systematic analysis of mandalas to understand the dreams of a famous scientist ( a contemporary and acquaintance of erwin schrodinger in fact ) who also was a prolific dreamer ( one of the most famous dreamers in the history of psychoanalysis ) , namely nobel laureate wolfgang pauli ( lindorff 1995 , 2004 ) .
pauli was a prominent quantum physicist who , among other things , postulated the existence of the neutrino in 1930 and acted as mephistopheles in the famous copenhagen version of goethe 's faust , written by max delbruck and performed in 1932 ( gamow 1966 ; segre 2008 ) .
according to jung , mandalas played an important role in pauli 's dreamlife , perhaps to compensate for the disruptive impact of quantum physics on established worldviews .
but there are more mandalas showing up in modern science .
one fascinating example is the famous photograph 51 , taken by rosalind franklin and her collaborator raymond gosling in 1952 and shown by maurice wilkins ( without franklin 's knowledge ) to james watson ( in a corridor at king 's college , london ) as a decisive piece of evidence for the helical structure of dna. with the assistance of wilkins , watson was able to peep through the keyhole of franklin 's laboratory , as it were : the primal science of molecular biology research , and a crucial step on the pathway that led to the discovery of dna ( zwart 2015 ) .
this photograph ( a helical structure , seen from above ) reflects the archetypal structure of a mandala , which is no coincidence of course , for this picture is not only a ground - breaking effort to spectrographically capture what can be regarded as the essence of life , but also marks the commencement ( anfang ) of a long and complicated project or journey , of which the synthetic cell would be the final completion ( fig. 5 ). fig. 5 photograph 51 archetypes are a priori mental forms or templates which realise themselves under certain circumstances in certain ways , but the general outline remains more or less constant .
the mandala archetype ( which can be found in all cultures and all periods of history ) is considered by jung as a symbol of restored unity or wholeness. and indeed , even in the technoscientific arena of synthetic biology research , mandalas can be found : in visualisations of biological structures , presented on powerpoints during academic lectures or available on the internet .
time and again , in journal articles and conference halls , the archetypal features of mandalas make their appearance .
but what can be the benefit of this exercise in pattern recognition ? from the point of view of scientific iconoclasm , there may even be epistemic risks involved .
as conti et al .
( 2007 ) argue , for instance , scientists often try to create a semblance of order in the messy materials coming from their experiments by translating them into graph - like structures , with genes , protein , metabolites and their various interactions represented with the help of nodes and arrows .
but although " scientists are in general very fond of these mandala - like pictures " ( conti et al. 2007 , p .
164 ) , such visualisations may prove arbitrary and ad hoc , while the suggestion of completeness and transparency may actually be misguiding , for there is always much more to " chaordic " living systems4 than what is captured by such quasi - reassuring , intricate yet simplifying diagrams .
although ( from the point of view of iconoclasm ) caution , or even suspicion , concerning the use of mandala - like images is understandable , it does not answer the question why scientists involved in synthetic biology in general , and in the synthetic cell debate in particular , revert to producing such forms .
in the next section , i will shift the focus from general considerations ( pertaining to synthetic biology discourse as such ) to the individual or micro - epistemic level , using the mandala concept to analyse the active imagination of a group of early stage researchers invited to visualise the synthetic cell , in the form of a four - colour drawing .
a philosophical experiment : active imagination and iconogenesis how to study mandalas in contemporary synthetic biology discourse ?
before discussing the results of the case study ( the philosophy session ) as such , allow me to briefly elucidate the methodology of a psychoanalytical approach to contemporary science .
rather than reflecting on molecules , molecular processes or synthetic cells , a psychoanalytical approach examines scientific research activities from an oblique perspective ( zwart 2017 ; cf. babich 1994 , p .
3 ) , focussing on the interactions between scientific subjects and their objects ( ranging from specific biomolecules up to organic or synthetic cells ) .
at least three complementary strategies are available .
first of all : discourse analysis , following the discursive flow ( of academic papers , project descriptions or powerpoint presentations produced by synthetic biologists ) with evenly - posed attention (" gleichschwebende aufmerksamkeit ") as freud ( 1912 / 1943 , 1917 / 1940 , p .
297 ) once phrased it , focussing on certain concepts , terms or images that trigger the attention or catch the " philosophical ear " ( zwart 2017 , p. 2 ) .
this method resulted in a first , exploratory analysis of three mandala - like illustrations ( above ) , more or less randomly selected from the current synthetic biology literature .
a subsequent methodological option is to focus on a moment of commencement : a primal scene ( urszene or anfang ) of the research practice that eventually evolved into current synthetic biology discourse .
an example of this approach is the discussion ( above ) of rosalind franklin 's crystallographic picture of dna as a key - hole glance into the " essence " of life (" in the beginning , there was a photograph ") .
a third and final option is to approach synthetic biologists , active in the field today , on the individual level .
rather than conducting interviews or participant observation , however , i opted for the jungian technique of active imagination .
during a philosophy session involving nine ph.d. researchers enrolled in the synthetic cell project mentioned above , participants were invited to make a drawing of a synthetic cell .
below , a sample of four of these drawings is inserted .
the session began with a short introductory lecture , but the mandala concept was not discussed until after the drawing assignment .
i will now briefly analyse the results ( fig. 6 ). fig. 6 synthetic cell drawings what is remarkable , first of all , is that most of the drawings produced during the session are spherical .
following my conversations with senior researchers and principal investigators involved in the project , this need not be the case .
for practical purposes , synthetic cells may well be cubical , or produced in dice - like formats .
most early - stage researchers involved in our session , however , envisioned the synthetic cell as a spherical entity ( although one of the participants submitted a drawing of three spherical cells instead of one ) .
most of the drawings , moreover , reflect a mandala - like shape ( epsilonἶdeltaomicronsigma ) .
this notably applies to the two drawings depicted on the left .
the bottom - right drawing can be regarded as " semi - mandala - like " , the overall shape being tubular or elliptic rather than spherical , but the upper - right drawing is definitely a non - mandala image .
in their comments , the participants who produced mandala - like drawings indicated that this shape for them expresses aspects of synthetic cells such as " equilibrium " , " balance " , " homeostasis " , " rational design " and " biomimesis " .
on the other hand , the participant who produced the non - mandala drawing commented that , for her , synthetic cells represent " artificiality " .
more specifically , her drawing was meant to reflect the abundant " fullness " of cells , either artificial or living , compared to the empty cells spotted by robert hooke 1665 .
one of the striking features of mandala - like cells depicted above , i would argue , is the number and position of the orifices ( or " gates " , as jung would call such features ) .
in the selected drawings , four ( on two occasions ) or even eight ( on one occasion ) orifices ( or gates ) are located in a spherical membrane .
the upper - left drawing is strikingly symmetrical , with evenly distributed orifices and a " symbolic " core ( containing genetic information : the cell 's " program " or " sacred text " , located in the centre ) .
in the lower - left mandala , the orifices are equally ( symmetrically ) distributed once again , but the genetic ( symbolic ) information is now wrapped in a second ( nuclear ) membrane .
another striking feature of the lower - left mandala is the straight and diagonal connecting lines between the gates , reminiscent of a buckminster fuller - like pattern or a la plata street map .
the drawing at the bottom - right side is semi - mandala - like : skewed or elliptical rather than spherical , with four orifices or gates , one of which is more pronounced ( reflecting what jung would refer to as the quaternity ratio , 3:1 ) .
the biggest opening seems a kind of fistula , moreover , apparently created there on purpose , allowing for chemical substances to be administered .
the non - mandala drawing ( upper - right ) reminds me of an egg - shaped organism , with a gut - like area on the left and two green features that look like eyes .
overall , without making any quantitative empirical claims ( given the limited sample size ) , i would argue that ( notwithstanding the various differences between these drawings ) , the mandala structure is a noteworthy feature. from a jungian perspective this is not only understandable , but also quite significant .
as indicated , a mandala is an archetypal symbol of wholeness , and the synthetic cell can be regarded as a bio - molecular microcosm , a structure that contains and assembles " everything " : everything currently known about the biochemical structures and processes of cellular life , while allowing us to discern how all these processes and components are interconnected , with the cell membrane as the protective circle and the cell nucleus as the centre .
following jung , besides representing the basic ground - plan or architecture of a synthetic cell , the mandala - like structure may also be regarded as a visual aid or roadmap for the process of building such a cell .
in the course of the twentieth century , living cells were broken down into elementary molecular components as we have seen , representable with the help of alphabets of bio - scientific " characters " ( symbols ) : the basic building blocks of life ( nucleotides , genes , amino acids , proteins , etc. ) .
the objective of building a synthetic cell is to bring all these components together again .
therefore , synthetic biology is often regarded as " holistic " , even by authors for whom the " esoteric " connotation of the term causes unease ( conti et al. 2007 , p. 161 ) .
mandalas can be encountered in other research fields as well ; it is not an exclusive feature of cell synthesis .
in phylogenetic research , for instance ( studying the evolutionary history of and relationships among organisms ) , " phylogeny mandalas " ( hasegawa 2017 ) are used to visualise the tree of life .
an impressive example is the version available on the global genome initiative portal , inserted below ( http :// ggi.eol.org / about ) .
here again , i would argue that this image reflects the objective to reassemble scattered genomics information into a comprehensive whole , a phylogenetic pantheon if you like , in order to assess what we have learned during the obliteration stage ( fig. 7 ). fig. 7 tree of life in psychodynamic terms , the building of a synthetic cell may be regarded as a collective exercise in reparation .
all the " partial objects " of life sciences research ( chromosomes , ribosomes , membrane , lipids , and so on ) are allocated a functional place within the synthetic cell as a holistic , all - encompassing , pantheon - like assembly .
as a model or structure , it is an imaginative condensation of molecular biological knowledge , and the synthetic cell emerges gradually , step by step , through active imagination .
the centre consists of the nucleus containing the program ( lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma ) of the cell , the core concept which realises itself in the visible , functioning structure .
mandala - like representations mimic the basic ( circular or egg - like ) form ( epsilonἶdeltaomicronsigma ) of a biological cell , while realising the program ( lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma ) as well .
although a synthetic cell may not be an exact replica of a living biological cell ( probably it will be a highly simplified version ) , it presents the general outline or model : the overall idea ( epsilonἶdeltaomicronsigma ) .
this explains why most of the synthetic cells envisioned by the participants in the session described above mimic and realise the archetypal , spherical structure of a biological cell , exemplifying balance and homeostasis : the equilibrium of multiple counteracting and apparently incompatible forces ( coniunctio oppositorum ) .
a synthetic cell diagram reflects the archetypal form ( epsilonἶdeltaomicronsigma ) of a mandala and may serve as a visual aid allowing researchers to envision and synthesise the various biochemical , biomolecular and bio - computational fragments into a comprehensive whole .
thus , the mandala represents the resurgence of the form ( epsilonἶdeltaomicronsigma ) , or rather : the synthesis ( or reconciliation ) of form ( epsilonἶdeltaomicronsigma ) and formula ( lambdaomicrongammaomicronsigma ) , but now in vitro .
concluding remarks : responsible metaphor management still , this is only part of the story , for the correspondences between synthetic cell diagrams and mandalas not only pertain to the object pole ( the end product of the synthetic cell endeavour ) , but also to the subject pole ( the researchers of research teams involved , zwart 2017 ) .
as an analytical psychologist and psychotherapist , jung was interested in the scientific subject , more than in the object .
as a concretisation of the mandala archetype , the synthetic cell concept plays a role in the process of individuation , so that synthetic biology research becomes a practice of the self .
whereas in the past researchers and research teams were working under the sway of specialisation , focussing on partial objects ( on very specific molecules or molecular processes ) , the synthetic cell ( reflecting the holistic turn in contemporary life sciences research ) allows for convergence , also in terms of the research programs and research activities involved .
after decades of reductionism and fragmentation , researchers are now again envisioning the cell as a whole .
it is only by reconstructing this microcosmic whole that a cell can be truly understood .
the cell is a microcosm , a condensation of living nature as such , and the synthetic or holistic turn in biology concurs with a process of integration on the part of the scientific subjects themselves .
synthetic cell projects such as basyc assemble experts representing multiple disciplines and approaches , so that the synthetic cell becomes a kind of scientific gesamtkunstwerk ( total work of art ) , actively engaging a significant sample of contemporary technosciences .
schrodinger 's argument that , in order to elucidate the enigma of life , biologists and physicists should learn to collaborate still conveys the basic logic of such a program .
the disruptive impact of elementary particle physics and elementary particle biology ( i.e. , molecular life sciences research ) is now assembled into the synthetic cell as closure .
the synthetic cell mandala suggests that , within this closure , all parts and processes are interconnected , but it may also represent a map guiding the researchers involved on their journey to new insights , turning research indo self - edification , so that the building of a synthetic cell entails an element of self - bildung as well. from a jungian perspective , moreover , synthetic cell mandalas must be seen as performative compensations for current deficits .
in terms of diagnostics , the present state of research in synthetic biology is " chaordic " ( blending characteristics of chaos and order ) .
in an imaginative manner , mandalas represent a complementary moment of compensation , counteracting the iconoclastic tendencies of technoscience towards quantification , computation and datafication .
dialectically speaking : the initial whole ( the living organism : the first moment ) is negated ( obliterated into data : the second moment ) , but this inevitably results in the sense that we have lost something ( the living cell , the organism as such ) , from which arises the urge to recover a more comprehensive , holistic view ( the negation of the negation : the third moment ) , to which active imagination can contribute ( as a form of reparation ) .
the role of philosophy is not only to highlight and analyse , but also to foster such a dialectical dynamics .
whereas technoscientific laboratories create optimal conditions for reductionism and iconoclastic obliteration (" negation " , the second moment ) , training sessions such as the one described above may be regarded as philosophical laboratories , creating optimal conditions for fostering the resurgence of the ( third ) holistic moment .
in his final publication ( his testament as it were , again building on jung ) , gaston bachelard ( 1960 ) thematised this relationship between iconoclasm ( abstract , quantitative thinking ) and imagination ( reverie ) in terms of animus and anima , arguing that , in order to overcome epistemic paralysis , we need mutual exposure between the two .
therefore , we need to invest in ( and critically consider ) both dimensions : iconoclasm and imagination .
the mandala signifies an ideal end state of convergence .
yet , while the synthetic cell mandala symbolises the inviting future , in real life researchers remain challenged by multiple conflicts , tensions and frustrations ( see for instance mcleod et al. , 2017 ) .
the synthetic cell mandala may work as a psychic aid , guiding researchers in their efforts to face the realities of laboratory life and its adverse impacts .
as a visual representation of a common goal or ideal , life sciences mandalas ( presented in bright colours during lectures for instance ) may have a performative effect , fostering team building and acting as a source of inspiration .
rather than seeing synthetic cells as reifications of an archetypal symbol , we conclude that the synthetic cell mandala functions as a regulative idea , expressing a sense of direction , oriented towards living systems as organic wholes .
it represents a sublated and reflected use of metaphors , which has been referred to as " responsible metaphor management " ( verbrugge et al. 2016 ) .

the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio ( nlr ) , a simple marker of inflammation , has recently been showed to predict tumor recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) patients after hepatic resection or liver transplantation .
however , whether it can be used to predict hcc development in cirrhotic patients remained unknown .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of the preoperative nlr for the development of hcc in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy .
a total of 230 hbv - associated cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy in our hospital from january 2000 to december 2012 were included in this study .
detailed clinical data included patients' general characteristics , laboratory tests and imaging studies , surgical procedures and complications .
information on patients' follow - up data was also obtained .
we found that 38 ( 16.52 %) patients developed hcc after splenectomy during the follow - up period .
an elevated preoperative nlr was associated with increased risk of developing hcc in cirrhotic patients after splenectomy .
the optimal cutoff value of nlr for hcc development was 2.27 .
in patients who developed hcc during the follow - up period , nlr scores showed no predictive value in overall survival after splenectomy .
however , nlr scores appeared to have a much better predictive value in overall survival in patients who did not develop hcc .
in conclusion , cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy remain at a relatively high risk of developing hcc , and an elevated preoperative nlr is associated with hcc development in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism .

introduction hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world .
although methods for detecting and treating hcc have been greatly improved , its mortality is still high [ 1,2 ] .
cirrhosis is a major risk factor for hcc .
approximately 70 % - 90 % of hcc patients have underlying cirrhosis .
hypersplenism is a common complication of liver cirrhosis .
a recent study has shown that hypersplenism is positively correlated with the increased risk of hcc in patients with post - hepatitis cirrhosis [ 3 ] .
splenectomy improved anti - tumor immune mechanisms and reduced hcc risk .
however , many cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy still developed hcc .
inflammatory responses play a vital role in tumorigenesis [ 4 ] .
the development of hcc is closely associated with inflammation status and immune responses [ 5 ] .
the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio ( nlr ) is a simple marker of inflammation .
it provides a good indication of the patient 's overall inflammatory status .
an elevated nlr has been associated with increased mortality in several malignancies [ 6 - 12 ] .
recently , nlr has been used to predict tumor recurrence in hcc patients after hepatic resection [ 13 ] or liver transplantation [ 14 ] .
however , there are no published data assessing the role of nlr in predicting hcc development in cirrhotic patients after splenectomy .
the main purpose of this study , therefore , was to determine whether an elevated nlr is associated with hcc development in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism , and if so , to determine the optimal predictive nlr cutoff value .
the primary endpoint was the appearance of hcc after splenectomy and the secondary endpoint was the overall survival .
since the majority of cirrhotic patients in china have history of hbv infection , we focused on hbv - associated cirrhotic patients in the current study .
materials and methods study population this retrospective cohort study was conducted to investigate the relationship between nlr and the development of hcc in cirrhotic patients after splenectomy .
the inclusion criteria were : 1 ) underwent splenectomy at the first affiliated hospital of xi'an jiaotong university from january 2000 to december 2012 , 2 ) history of chronic hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) infection , 3 ) the presence of liver cirrhosis with hypersplenism but without tumor at the time of splenectomy , and 4 ) available medical records including follow - up data .
ultimately 230 patients were included in this study .
the study has been approved by the first affiliated hospital of xi'an jiaotong university ethics committee .
the patient 's informed written consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of this study .
all data collected were used only for statistics analysis in this study .
data collection detailed clinical data included patients' age , sex , length of hospital stay , admission diagnosis , past history , child - pugh class / score and other general clinical data , as well as biochemical and imaging studies , surgical procedures and complications .
laboratory tests included blood routine test , liver function , renal function and blood coagulation indicators , which were documented at admission .
the sizes of the spleen volume were assessed by imaging instrumentation .
the preoperative data were obtained prior to surgery , and the blood samples were taken on the first day after admission .
the first set of measurements was taken if there were more than one set for the same individual .
nlr was calculated as neutrophils divided by the absolute number of lymphocytes [ 15 ] .
patient follow - up and hcc diagnosis all cases received follow - up routinely until june 2015 .
overall incidence of hcc and overall survival were calculated from the time of surgery in our unit .
the time of occurrence of hcc was defined as the time from the surgery to the last observation of no tumor .
the follow - up data was achieved every three months in the first year , every four months in the second year , every six months in the third year , and every one year thereafter .
the content included abdominal symptoms and signs , recurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding , hepatitis b virus controlling , afp values , doppler ultrasound examination and abdominal computed tomography results .
based on the corresponding symptoms and related inspection materials , we determined whether there was a tumor .
during the period of follow - up , patient - related data , including death and gastrointestinal bleeding , tumor occurrence and imaging examination , had been recorded in detail .
to minimize bias , two clinicians completed follow - up and review respectively .
the diagnosis of hcc was based on past history , clinical symptoms and signs , laboratory tests and imaging results .
statistical analysis for continuous variables , the data was recorded with mean +/ - standard deviation or median ( minimum - - maximum ) , which was based on whether they meet the distributed kolmogorov - smirnov test , ( p < 0.05 ) or not .
categorical variables were shown as frequency .
therefore , the significance of difference between two groups was detected by calculating the student 's t - test or wilcoxon test for continuous datum and the chi - squared test for categorical variables .
the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve with overall incidence of hcc was used to decide the ideal cutoff value , allowing the indication for overall hcc occurrence with the optimal sensitivity and specificity .
survival curves were plotted using the kaplan - meier method , and the differences between the groups were analyzed by the log - rank test .
if there were significant statistical differences in the univariate analysis , the multivariate cox proportional hazards model was further performed .
the whole statistical process was completed by the pasw statistics 22.0 software ( ibm corporation , armonk , ny , usa ) .
while the drawing of survival curve were accomplished by the graphpad prism 6.0 software ( graphpad software , inc. la jolla , usa ). and the subgroup analysis was performed after excluding the confounding factors .
in this study , p values < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .

the cumulative hcc appearance rates were 6.09 % , 10.87 % and 17.39 % at 3 , 5 and 10 years after splenectomy , respectively .
to determine the value of the preoperative nlr score in predicting hepatocarcinogenesis after splenectomy , an roc curve analysis was performed .
as shown in fig 1a , the preoperative nlr score had a positive correlation with the hcc appearance rate after splenectomy .
the area under the roc curve ( auc ) was 0.625 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.527 - 0.723 , p = 0.018 ) .
the calculated cut - off for nlr scores to predict hcc development was 2.27 , with sensitivity of 63.9 % , specificity of 65.3 % , and youden index of 0.292 .
according to the cut - off value of the preoperative nlr score , 141 patients in this cohort had a low nlr score ( nlr <= 2.27 , 61.3 %) and 89 patients had a high nlr score ( nlr > 2.27 , 38.7 %) .
table 2 shows the demographic and preoperative data associated with high or low nlr scores .
compared with patients with a low nlr score , patients with a high nlr score had a higher neutrophil count ( p < 0.001 ) , but a lower lymphocyte count ( p < 0.001 ) .
however , there were no statistically significant differences in other baseline demographic and clinical parameters .
the kaplan - meier estimates of hcc appearance rates after splenectomy were calculated with regard to preoperative nlr scores .
as shown in fig 1b , the 3 , 5 and 10 years hcc appearance rates were 6.7 % , 12.4 % , and 24.7 % in the high nlr group and 5.0 % , 8.5 % , and 10.6 % in the low nlr group , respectively .
the difference was statistically significant ( p = 0.006 ) .

risk factors for hepatocarcinogenesis to identify risk factors independently associated with hepatocarcinogenesis after splenectomy , univariable and multivariable analyses were performed .
univariate variables with p < 0.1 were entered into the multivariate model .
as shown in table 3 , only the preoperative nlr score was independently associated with hepatocarcinogenesis after splenectomy in the multivariate analysis .
the odds ratio of patients with a nlr score of > 2.27 was 3.304 compared with those with a lower nlr score .
other factors including age , sex , platelet count < 30x109 / l , afp levels , child - pugh class , intraoperative blood loss or blood transfusion , postoperative bleeding , portal vein thrombosis , the spleen size , surgical approach , and postoperative complications were not independently associated with the hepatocarcinogenesis rate .

preoperative nlr score and overall survival during the follow - up period , a total of 36 ( 15.65 %) patients died .
the 3 - , 5 - and 10 - year survival rates were 92.6 % , 88.7 % , and 85.7 % , respectively .
the patients who developed hcc had a lower overall survival rate than those who did not develop hcc .
however , the difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.07 in the log - rank test , fig 2a ) .
to determine the value of the preoperative nlr score in predicting survival after splenectomy , the kaplan - meier estimates of survival after splenectomy were calculated with regard to their preoperative nlr scores in total patients , hcc patients and non - hcc patients , respectively .
in the whole study population , patients with a high nlr score appeared to have a lower overall survival rate than those with a low nlr score after splenectomy ( p = 0.051 , fig 2b ) .
however , in patients who developed hcc during the follow - up period , nlr scores showed no predictive value in overall survival after splenectomy ( fig 2c ) .
on the other hand , nlr scores appeared to have a much better predictive value in overall survival after splenectomy in patients who did not develop hcc during the follow - up period ( p = 0.054 , fig 2d ) .

the survival rate was estimated by the kaplan - meier method and compared by the log - rank test .
discussion detecting hcc at the early stage requires accurately identifying the major high - risk population of hcc .
liver cirrhosis is the most important risk factor for hcc development .
however , only a small portion of cirrhotic patients eventually develop hcc .
the annual incidence of hcc in cirrhotic patients ranges from 0.04 % to 6.3 %[ 16 - 21 ] .
therefore , methods to distinguish cirrhotic patients with higher and lower risk for hcc development are urgently needed .
here , we found that nlr , an inexpensive and easily accessible marker of inflammation , can be used to assess the risk for the development of hcc in cirrhotic patients and a high preoperative nlr is associated with increased risk of developing hcc in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy .
splenectomy is a common treatment for cirrhotic patients with hypersplenism and portal hypertension .
in a recent study of 2678 cirrhotic patients with hypersplenism , lv x et al. reported that splenectomy was performed less frequently in patients who developed hcc than those who did not develop hcc , suggesting that splenectomy might reduce hcc risk in cirrhotic patients [ 3 ] .
however , in that study , 17.3 % cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy still developed hcc during the follow - up period .
in the current study , we also found that the 10 - year cumulative hcc appearance rate was 16.1 % in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy .
therefore , cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy remains at a relatively high risk of developing hcc .
inflammation plays a crucial role in the development of cancer .
nlr is a marker of systemic inflammation .
an elevated nlr has been found to be correlated with poor prognosis of hcc patients regardless of the treatment method and the stage of the tumor [ 14,22 - 28 ] .
in the current study , we demonstrated for the first time that an elevated preoperative nlr was associated with increased risk of developing hcc in cirrhotic patients after splenectomy .
the optimal cutoff value of nlr for hcc development after splenectomy in cirrhotic patients was 2.27 .
the 10 - year cumulative hcc appearance rate in patients with a nlr score > 2.27 was more than double the rate in patients with a nlr score <= 2.27 ( 24.7 % vs. 10.6 %) , suggesting a high risk of hcc in patients with a high nlr score .
a recent study has shown that a high nlr score was correlated with accumulation of tumor - associated macrophages in the liver after curative resection of hcc [ 27 ] .
tumor - associated macrophages are an important component of the tumor inflammatory microenvironment in hcc and have been shown to promote tumorigenesis [ 29 ] .
therefore , the association of the elevated nlr and the increased risk of hcc may be related to the accumulation of tumor - associated macrophages in the liver in such patients .
however , the detailed underlying mechanism warrants further investigation .
here , we also found that the appearance of hcc reduced the lifespan of cirrhotic patients slightly .
the 10 - year overall survival rate was 71.05 % for patients who developed hcc and 86.98 % for non - hcc patients .
however , the difference was not statistically significant .
this is expected as all the patients in this cohort had advanced liver cirrhosis .
in order to show a statistically significant difference in survival , more patients were needed .
in terms of the predictive value of nlr for the overall survival , it appeared that it performed better in non - hcc patients than hcc patients .
this could be due to the fact that when hcc developed in these patients , the whole body 's inflammatory status changed .
the nlr before splenectomy could not reflect the inflammatory status after the appearance of hcc , which was the one that is vital for the prognosis of these patients .
on the other hand , no such changes in the inflammatory status were undertaken in patients who did not develop hcc .
so nlr before splenectomy remained predictive for survival in non - hcc cirrhotic patients .
we also noticed that the p values for nlr to predict survival were 0.051 and 0.054 in the whole study cohort and the non - hcc subgroup , respectively .
this suggests the optimal cutoff value for predicting hcc development may not be the optimal cutoff value for predicting survival .
nevertheless , more studies aimed at investigating the role of nlr in different groups of cirrhotic patients are needed .
all the patients in this study had chronic hbv infection .
high levels of hbv dna in the circulation are associated with an increased risk of developing hcc [ 30 ] .
nucleoside analogues effectively suppress hbv dna levels .
several studies have shown that long - term nucleoside analogue therapy reduced the risk for developing hbv - related hcc [ 31 - 33 ] .
nucleoside analogue therapy has now become standard treatment modalities for chronic hbv infection .
the predictive value of nlr on hbv - related hcc should be evaluated in nucleoside analogue treated hbv patients in the future .
the long follow - up time and the highly focused study population ( i.e. , hbv - associated cirrhotic patients underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism and portal hypertension ) are the obvious strengths of the current study .
however , there are also several limitations in this study .
first , our data came from a single - center .
the sample size was relatively small , which could be the reason for not showing statistically significant differences in the survival analysis .
second , due to the high prevalence of hbv infection in our country , only patients with hbv - related cirrhosis were included in the study .
therefore , whether nlr has the same value in predicting hcc development in patients with hcv or alcohol - related cirrhosis needs to be determined .
third , this is a retrospective cohort study .
it is subject to the limitations consistent with this type of studies such as unmeasured or unknown confounding factors and selection biases .
a prospective trial may be needed to further validate our findings .
in conclusion , cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy remains at a relatively high risk of developing hcc , and an elevated preoperative nlr is associated with hcc development in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism .
nlr may offer additional information in the clinical management of cirrhotic patients with hypersplenism and portal hypertension due to its predictive value in hcc development and long - term survival in those patients .

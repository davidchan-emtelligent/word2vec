lung transplantation has evolved into a life - saving therapy for select patients with end - stage lung diseases .
however , long - term survival remains limited because of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ( bos ) .
soluble hla - g , a mediator of adaptive immunity that modulates regulatory t cells and certain classes of effector t cells , may be a useful marker of survival free of bos .
we conducted a retrospective , single - center , pilot review of 38 lung transplant recipients who underwent collection of serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 3 , 6 and 12 months after transplantation , and compared soluble hla - g concentrations in each to the presence of type a rejection and lymphocytic bronchiolitis in the first 12 months and to the presence of bos at 24 months after transplantation .
lung soluble hla - g concentrations were directly related to the presence of type a rejection but not to lymphocytic bronchiolitis .
our data demonstrate that soluble hla - g concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage but not in serum correlates with the number of acute rejection episodes in the first 12 months after lung transplantation , and thus may be a reactive marker of rejection .

introduction lung transplantation ( lt ) remains the best hope for selected patients with end - stage lung diseases .
chronic allograft rejection , clinically manifested as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ( bos ) , remains a major limitation to long - term survival : bos occurs in 40 - 60 % of lung transplant recipients within 4 years and is the leading cause of death after the first year , despite advances in the use of immunosuppressive therapy [ 1 ] .
although several alloimmune - dependent and independent events have been considered as risk factors for bos , the most common and consistently identified factor associated with the development of bos is acute lung allograft rejection episodes and alloimmune t - cell reactivity [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
hla - g is a major histocompatibility complex class i antigen encoded by a gene on chromosome 6p21 [ 4 ] .
two hla - g isoforms exist outside the placenta : membrane - bound g1 and soluble g5 ( shla - g ) that due to alternative splicing lacks the transmembrane and intracellular domains of g1 [ 5 ] .
hla - g binds the inhibitory receptor ig - like transcript ( ilt ) 2 / lilrb1 / cd85j , expressed by human nk cells , monocytes , t cells , b cells and dendritic cells [ 6 ] , and the myeloid - specific ilt4 / lilrb2 / cd85d receptor [ 7 ] .
hla - g has effects on both cd4 + foxp3 + regulatory t ( treg ) cells and on alloreactive recipient alloreactive cd4 + and cd8 + effector t ( teff ) cells that may be beneficial in transplantation : it induces expansion of treg cells [ 8 ] , inhibits both nk cell - and cd8 + t cell - mediated cytolysis [ 9 ] , suppresses cd4 + t cell alloproliferative responses [ 10 ] , and induces apoptosis of cd8 + t cells [ 11 ] .
perhaps more important for long - term tolerance , hla - g - bearing antigen - presenting cells also induce the differentiation of cd4 + t cells into suppressor cells [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
hla - g has been demonstrated in heart transplant allografts : patients with higher hla - g expression had fewer acute rejection episodes ( ares ) and less evidence for chronic rejection [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
circulating shla - g was seen only in patients with hla - g expression in the heart allograft , suggesting the allograft as the source [ 14 ] .
similar results were seen in patients following liver [ 16 ] and renal [ 17 ] transplantation .
suppressor t cells were present in increased number in liver and liver - kidney transplant patients who express hla - g at high levels [ 18 ] .
in one recent single - center , retrospective study of 64 lt recipients within the first year of transplant , hla - g expression was seen in both bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells most frequently in stable patients but less so in patients with frequent ares or in patients with bos [ 19 ] .
this study did not evaluate the presence of either circulating or local ( lung ) shla - g , however .
we have previously demonstrated that low numbers of foxp3 + treg cells are associated with accelerated rejection and the development of bos in lt [ 20 ] .
other investigators have demonstrated that increasing the number / function of treg cells is associated with less alloreactivity in gvhd [ 21 ] .
given the association between the presence of hla - g and other solid - organ transplantation and the potential modulatory role of hla - g on treg and teff function , we asked whether there was an association between hla - g locally in the recipient lung in the first year after lt and subsequent bos .
to answer this question , we examined a respective cohort of lt recipients to compare the presence of shla - g in plasma and in bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) fluid collected in the first year to the number of acute rejection episodes in the first year and the appearance of bos after transplantation .
methods ethics statement approval was obtained from the university of chicago institutional review board ( irb ) for this study , and was continuously updated as required during the study .
informed written consent done on forms approved by the irb was obtained from all patients included in this analysis prior to their participation .
patient population adult subjects receiving a single or bilateral sequential lung transplant from june , 2006 to september , 2011 at the university of chicago hospitals were evaluated .
clinical data , blood samples , and bal fluid collected by bronchoscopy in the first 12 months after transplantation , and clinical status and pathology samples to determine the presence or absence of acute rejection episodes and bos in the first 48 months after transplantation , were evaluated .
as the point of the study was to evaluate a potential marker for the development of bos , patients had to survive for 12 months or longer after transplantation to be included in this study .
immunosuppression baseline immunosuppression for all patients included tacrolimus ( target trough level : 10 ng / ml ) , azathioprine ( 2 mg / kg / day ) , and prednisone ( tapered to 5 mg / day by 3 months post - transplantation ) .
daclizumab induction therapy was administered to all patients per the manufacturer 's instructions .
immunosuppression was changed because of declining pulmonary function per the discretion of the attending transplant physician .
bronchoscopy samples we have previously described these methods [ 20 ] .
specimens were collected during surveillance bronchoscopies in the first 12 months post - transplantation .
for bal , one 60 ml and one 30 ml aliquot were instilled into the distal airways and aspirated .
in general , 40 to 50 ml of bal fluid was recovered .
an aliquot of this recovered fluid was processed by clinical laboratories to assess clinical infection .
fluid to be used for mediator analysis was centrifuged at 300x g and 4degreesc for 10 min , after which the supernatant was removed , passed through a 1.2 - microm filter , and frozen at - 80degreesc until used .
cell pellets were also frozen at - 80degreesc until analyzed .
for transbronchial biopsies , samples were collected by standard technique from the recipient lung and processed for evaluation of rejection .
plasma samples blood was collected on the same day as bronchoscopy in heparin - containing tubes and immediately placed on ice .
plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored in aliquots at - 80degreesc until use .
acute rejection and bos acute rejection was determined by histological analysis of transbronchial biopsies obtained during each surveillance bronchoscopy and clinical bronchoscopies .
acute rejection was graded in accordance with international society of heart and lung transplantation ( ishlt ) guidelines [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
all analyses included episodes of both grade a rejection ( ra ) and lymphocytic bronchiolitis ( lb ) .
all rejection episodes that met criteria were included in the data analysis .
determination of bos was done periodically at clinical encounters for each subject using standard spirometry definitions .
measurement of shla - g shla - g was measured in plasma and in bal fluid using elisa ( exbio , inc. , czech republic ) .
the capture antibody , mem - g / 9 , recognizes both shed g1 and soluble g5 .
the limit of sensitivity is ~ 1 u / ml. concentrations in bal fluid were not normalized for bal fluid protein content or other markers .
data analysis clinical data are expressed as the mean +/ - standard deviation or as the median with interquartile ranges .
when hla - g concentrations were below the limit of detection the value was recorded as ' 0 ' .
results were compared using the non - parametric kruskal - wallis test .
the spearman correlation was used to determine associations between hla - g concentrations and grade a or b rejection .
the associations between hla - g , ra or lb and mortality or bos - free survival were analyzed using kaplan - meier analysis and cox regression model .
the log - rank test was used to compare differences of groups .
the survival time was measured from the beginning of lung transplant to the date of death or to the end of the study ( jan .
25 , 2013 ) and bos - free survival was calculated from lung transplant date to the first of observation of bos or death or the end of study , whichever was earlier .
a p value less than 0.05 was considered significant .
the data was analyzed using the statistic software stata / se 13.0 and ibm spss statistics 20 .
results demographics and survival we performed 53 lung transplants in the time period of this study in which patients survived for 1 year or longer ; of these 38 subjects were eligible for inclusion ( figure 1 ) .
subjects characteristics are shown in table 1. of the 38 subjects , 28 survived the length of time recorded in the study ( mean survival 4.12 +/ - 1.73 years ) , whereas 10 subjects died after lung transplant ( mean survival 2.77 +/ - 1.81 years ) .
these subjects were included in our data analysis .
bos - free survival was 3.22 +/ - 1.49 years in the 15 subjects recorded as not having a clinical diagnosis of bos during the study , and 1.07 +/ - 1.62 years in the 23 subjects who did develop clinically - diagnosed bos .
there were no differences in overall survival based on gender , but median bos - free survival was greater in male subjects : 3.84 years ( 1.94 to 5.75 years by 95 % confidence interval ) versus 1.73 years ( 1.03 to 2.43 years by 95 % confidence interval ) for female subjects .
there were no significant differences in survival or bos - free survival based on race , type of transplant ( single versus bilateral sequential ) or diagnosis at the time of transplantation .

rejection both ra and lb were noted in a majority of subjects prior to the onset of bos ( table 2 ) .
there was no difference in overall survival time based on either maximum grade ra or lb score in the first year after transplant .
as the numbers of subjects with a ra grade of 2 or 3 were small , these were grouped in subsequent analysis .
three patients had a score of >= 2 for both ra and lb ; two patients had a score of 1 for both ra and lb. the association between ra and lb was not significant as measured using kendall 's tau test .
there was a significant correlation between bos - free survival time and maximum ra grade after transplantation ( figure 2 ) ( p = 0.030 for ra by mantel - cox log rank test ) .

shla - g concentrations and rejection a total of 71 plasma and 85 bal samples were collected in the first year after transplantation in 38 subjects .
plasma shla - g concentrations could be measured in every subject at every encounter , whereas 10 bal samples had an shla - g concentration below the limit of sensitivity .
substantial variance was noted in both plasma and bal maximum concentrations in the first year ( table 2 ) .
there was no relation between either maximum plasma hla - g concentration recorded in the first year , or in mean plasma hla - g concentration of all first year samples , and overall survival or bos - free survival .
likewise , there was no relation between either maximum bal hla - g concentration recorded in the first year , or in mean bal hla - g concentration of all first year samples , and overall survival .
contrary to our expectations , an increased maximum bal hla - g concentration was associated with a higher grade of ra prior to a clinical diagnosis of bos ( p = 0.006 by kruskal - wallis test ) ( figure 3 ) .
in contrast , an increased maximum plasma hla - g concentration was associated with a lower grade of lb prior to a clinical diagnosis of bos ( p = 0.044 by kruskal - wallis test ) , but not with any grade of ra ( figure 3 ) .

shla - g concentrations and infection both blood and lung infection , as demonstrated by positive cultures in blood or bal fluid respectively , were noted in a majority of subjects prior to the onset of bos ( table 2 ) .
there was no significant correlation between the number of infections and either plasma or bal hla - g concentrations .
discussion bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome remains the major limitation to long - term survival after lung transplantation despite advances in immunosuppressive therapy , infection control , and management of other complications .
the poor prognosis associated with bos reflects in part an inadequate understanding to date of disease processes which in turn leads either to under - treatment with immunosuppressive medications , and thus bos progression , or to over - treatment or inappropriate treatment , and thus the increased number of infections and complications seen in this patient population .
our study demonstrates that the local ( bal ) presence of hla - g in the first year after transplantation in the lung correlates with the number of grade a rejection , and that circulating plasma hla - g in the first year after transplantation correlates inversely with lb. our study suggests that hla - g may be a biological marker of rejection in a lung allograft .
such a marker , if confirmed in larger studies , would be useful to segregate those patients with a higher risk of rejection and bos who require more intense immunosuppressive therapy from those in whom such therapy would entail increased risk without commensurate benefit .
concentrations of shla - g were usually , but not always , detected in bal fluid collected from lt recipients , and some variance was seen in bal concentrations .
we hypothesized that increased hla - g levels in the lung would be associated with a lower rejection score as has been seen in patients following other solid - organ transplant [ 14 ] - [ 17 ] .
contrary to our hypothesis , however , the highest concentrations in bal fluid were seen in patients with a ra score >= 2 .
the reasons for this are not clear : it may suggest that local production of hla - g ( by macrophages or by epithelial cells ) is reactive and represent an attempt to induce the presence and generation of regulatory t cells [ 8 ] .
alternatively , it may reflect differences in the state of activation of airway macrophages and / or epithelial cells .
further evaluation of this will require studies in which local airway cell production can be ascertained over time .
there was variance also in circulating serum hla - g concentrations in the first year after transplantation , and these were inversely associated with lb , but not ra , status .
serum hla - g concentrations in subjects with a score of 1 in lb status was not different than that seen in recipients with a score of 0 , while subjects with a score >= 2 had lower hla - g concentrations .
this suggests that mild lymphocytic bronchiolitis demonstrated on transbronchial biopsies may not be associated with changes in immune status sufficient to in turn decrease serum levels .
the downward trend in serum hla - g concentrations in patients with significant ra noted on transbronchial biopsy is not statistically significant but will need to be examined in the context of a larger study .
serum markers clearly are easier to obtain and , along with other serum markers , provide context for the overall status of the immune system .
correlations with circulating regulatory and effector t cell trafficking to the lung allograft will be needed to understand the potential role of serum shla - g in lt recipients .
in one recent single - center , retrospective study of 64 lt recipients within 1 year of transplant , hla - g protein expression was seen in both bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells most frequently in stable patients but less so in patients with frequent ares or in patients with bos [ 19 ]. that study however did not evaluate the presence of either circulating shla - g in plasma or local shla - g in bronchoalveolar lavage .
hla - g also is found in lung macrophages [ 24 ] , and evaluation of cell pellets by immunofluorescent staining collected from several lt recipients in our study demonstrated significant macrophage expression of shla - g ( data not shown ) .
thus , shla - g found in bronchoalveolar lavage may represent the combined expression and secretion from both central and alveolar epithelial cells and from macrophages ; changes in expression in either cell type might account for changes in the final presence in the lung .
understanding which cells contribute to final expression and presence after lung transplantation , and how that expression is modified by immunosuppressive drug treatment , infection and evolving chronic rejection , will require further study .
hla - g induces expansion of cd4 + foxp3 + treg cells [ 8 ] which may be important in allograft survival in transplantation .
we have previously demonstrated that low numbers of lung foxp3 + treg cells are associated with accelerated rejection and the development of bos in lt recipients [ 20 ] .
other investigators have demonstrated similar findings in stem cell [ 25 ] and bone marrow [ 26 ] transplantation , while increasing their number and function is associated with less alloreactivity in graft versus host disease [ 21 ] .
our new data raises the possibility that higher expression of hla - g in the allograft may stimulate the presence and / or survival of lung treg lymphocytes that then may modulate tolerance ; this will need to be confirmed in future studies .
in particular , our data do not make clear whether the change in allograft hla - g expression is reactive , due to some rejection episode or stimulus from cells that ordinarily mediate rejection , or is innate and dependent more on a subject 's ( or allograft ) genotype .
hla - g also inhibits both nk cell - and cd8 + t cell - mediated cytolysis [ 9 ] , suppresses cd4 + t cell alloproliferative responses [ 10 ] , and induces apoptosis of cd8 + t cells [ 11 ] .
likewise , hla - g - bearing antigen - presenting cells not only inhibit cd4 + t cell proliferation but also induce the differentiation of cd4 + t cells into suppressor cells [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
each action may improve allograft outcome , and will require evaluation in the context of lt. our study was too small to detect whether either plasma or local lung ( bal ) hla - g concentrations were associated with survival or bos - free survival .
similarly , given the few time points that were collected for each subject and the missing samples , we were unable to assess changes in shla - g concentrations in bal and serum reliably over time .
both limitations are typical of single - center studies and suggests that a multi - center trial with a significantly larger number of study subjects will be required to answer this question .
nevertheless our study does suggest that hla - g is protective against lb ; we predict that over a longer period of time and in larger studies that this will translate into improved bos - free survival .
an additional issue is whether shla - g concentrations in bal fluid reflect the local concentrations of shla - g at the tissue level .
previous studies in heart and lung transplant recipients have evaluated shla - g presence in endomyocardial and transbronchial biopsies , respectively [ 14 ] , [ 19 ] .
in the peripheral lung , shla - g presence in bal fluid may reflect the combined relative contributions of airway epithelial cells [ 19 ] and of alveolar macrophages [ 24 ] .
we did not directly compare the bal concentrations to tissue presence of shla - g in this study , and both the correlation and the assignment of the bal contribution to epithelial cell and / or macrophage origin will need to be addressed in future studies .
our study also was too small to examine the potential relation of genotype on lung allograft function and the development of bos .
the influence of hla - g genotype of both the donor graft and recipient has been examined in small studies of other solid organ transplants .
while alleles encoding polymorphisms in the coding region apparently have little effect in renal transplantation [ 27 ] , the 14 bp in / del polymorphism in exon 8 in the 3 ' un - translated region of hla - g may help predict renal [ 28 ] and bone marrow transplant [ 29 ] complications .
understanding how both donor and recipient genotypes influence tolerance will have important implications in matching donors to recipients in the future : as one example , if both genotypes predict low hla - g expression , then clinicians may need to increase immunosuppressive therapy in terms of dosing or combinations of medications ; and likewise , if either or both genotypes predict high expression , lower immunosuppressive therapy may be sufficient .
multi - center studies of hla - g and its expression in lung allografts and in recipients will be needed to answer this question .
as may often happen in clinical studies with the collection of biological specimens , data were not available at each pre - specified time point because of the clinical condition ( e.g. , clinical instability during the bronchoscopy procedure ) of the patient or logistics of specimen collection .
however , the data remain useful despite these missing samples .
in addition , we cannot exclude that different patient phenotypes or the variety of clinical events such as infection may bias our results .
the putative use of lung shla - g as a biomarker for early allograft rejection clearly will require further study and confirmation in larger cohorts from different transplant centers .
in summary , we demonstrate the presence of shla - g in both the lung and serum of lt recipients .
there is an association of high bal shla - g presence and the development of grade a rejection within 2 years .
while the mechanisms by which lung shla - g presence increases are not clear , this adaptive immunity mediator may be a marker of rejection in lung transplantation .

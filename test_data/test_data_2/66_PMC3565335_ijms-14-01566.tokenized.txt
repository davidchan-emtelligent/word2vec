hematopoietic development is orchestrated by gene regulatory networks that progressively induce lineage - specific transcriptional programs .
to guarantee the appropriate level of complexity , flexibility , and robustness , these networks rely on transcriptional and post - transcriptional circuits involving both transcription factors ( tfs ) and micrornas ( mirnas ) .
the focus of this review is on runx1 ( aml1 ) , a master hematopoietic transcription factor which is at the center of mirna circuits necessary for both embryonic and post - natal hematopoiesis .
interference with components of these circuits can perturb runx1 - controlled coding and non - coding transcriptional programs in leukemia .
runx1 ( aml1 ) micrornas ( mirnas ) hematopoiesis leukemia transcription factor - microrna circuits gene regulatory networks 1 .
introduction during embryonic and post - natal hematopoiesis , a limited pool of hematopoietic stem cells ( hscs ) gives rise to all blood cell types through hierarchical specification of different hematopoietic lineages .
development , self - renewal , lineage commitment , and maturation of hscs and multipotent progenitor cells are orchestrated by soluble growth factors and signals from the microenvironment , as well as cell - autonomous changes in gene expression .
during hematopoietic differentiation , lineage - specific genes are progressively induced , while alternative - lineage genes are progressively silenced through heritable chromatin changes .
the regulation of these processes relies on a complex interplay between hematopoietic transcription factor networks and post - transcriptional regulators , in particular micrornas ( mirnas ) .
in this review , we specifically focus on runx1 , a master hematopoietic transcription factor at the center of a mirna network relevant for both normal and malignant hematopoiesis .
2. transcription factor - microrna networks in hematopoiesis hematopoiesis starts during embryonic development and continues throughout life to guarantee proper generation and constant availability of blood cells ( for general reviews see [ 1 - 3 ]) .
during embryonic development , hematopoiesis occurs in two waves .
in the first wave , hematopoiesis ( called primitive ) takes place in the yolk sack and results in the transient production of primitive hematopoietic cells , mainly erythrocytes , necessary to support initial embryonic growth [ 1 ] .
these primitive cells are morphologically different from , and do not give rise to , adult hematopoietic cells .
in the second wave , hematopoiesis ( called definitive ) occurs at multiple sites , and eventually gives rise to the adult hematopoietic system .
during definitive hematopoiesis , a pool of hematopoietic stem cells ( hscs ) is produced in both extra embryonic and embryonic regions derived from the mesoderm , such as the placenta and the aorta - gonad mesonephros ( agm ) region [ 2 ] .
in these regions , mesoderm - derived endothelial / blood precursors differentiate into a " hemogenic endothelium " , which undergoes an epithelial - hematopoietic transition whereby endothelial - like cells become non - adherent and acquire hsc features [ 2,4 ] .
these hscs later colonize the fetal liver and , ultimately , the bone marrow , where they sustain hematopoiesis throughout life .
hscs are capable of both self - renewal and generation of multipotent progenitor cells , which progressively become committed and produce distinct hematopoietic lineages [ 1,2 ] .
the different hematopoietic cell types are characterized by very specific gene expression profiles that reflect the progressive restriction of their differentiation potential [ 5 ] .
several transcription factors ( tf ) play a key role in determining the correct temporal activation or repression of specific hematopoietic transcriptional programs during both hsc establishment / maintenance and lineage - specific differentiation and function ( for general reviews see [ 1,5,6 ]) .
for instance , the ets transcription factor fli1 is indispensable for the formation of the epithelial / blood precursors [ 7 ] , scl / tal1 is required for their differentiation into the hemogenic endothelium [ 8,9 ] , and runx1 is necessary for the formation of hscs from the hemogenic endothelium [ 10 - 12 ] .
differentiation into more committed progenitors and mature blood cells involves also other tfs , including nfi - a , pu.1 and cebp family members , whose balance is critical to determine myeloid and lymphoid cell fates [ 13 - 21 ] .
interestingly , hscs express not only tfs strictly required for their homeostasis and self - renewal , but also many others that characterize the development of multiple lineages [ 5 ] .
thus , during lineage commitment it is not only necessary to activate the gene networks that identify a specific lineage , but also to repress the programs associated with alternate lineages [ 5 ] .
it is becoming apparent that this level of complexity cannot be determined by single tfs , but instead relies on positive and negative regulatory interactions within tf networks [ 22,23 ] as well as tf - mirnas circuits [ 24 - 26 ] .
the role of mirnas in hematopoiesis is well established , and has been recently and amply reviewed [ 25 - 30 ] .
one of the most remarkable properties of mirnas is their ability to affect entire cellular processes by controlling multiple targets of the same pathway [ 31 ] .
in this respect , very small changes in mirna expression are expected to have a cumulative effect and result in much greater biological outcomes .
the reach of mirna action is further extended by the interplay between mirna - controlled networks and tf networks .
not only tfs and mirnas frequently share the same targets , but some mirnas often target tfs that modulate their own transcription .
this interplay results in transcriptional / post - transcriptional feedback and feed - forward loops that both expand and fine - tune the action of single tfs / mirnas [ 31 ] .
tf - mirna circuits not only are predicted by bioinformatics' analyses [ 32,33 ] , but are also supported by growing experimental evidence , particularly from hematopoietic models ( reviewed by [ 25,34 ]) .
for instance , monocytic and granulocytic differentiation involves at least three such circuits [ 25 ] .
in one circuit , cebpa ( ccaat / enhancer - binding protein alpha ) is induced by granulocyte colony stimulating factor during granulopoiesis and is part of a feed - forward loop whereby cebpa positively modulates mir - 223 and nfia transcription , while mir - 223 represses nfia expression [ 35 ] .
repression of nfia on one hand prevents the initiation of erythropoietic transcriptional programs , and on the other hand drives granulopoiesis [ 20,21 ] .
in a second circuit , pu.1 induces both mir - 424 and nfi - a , while mir - 424 represses nfia expression [ 36 ] .
both nfi - a downregulation by rnai and mir - 424 overexpression have been shown to promote monocytic differentiation [ 36 ] .
in addition , as we will examine more in detail later in this review , monocytic differentiation involves a third circuit linking runx1 and the mir - 17 - 92 cluster [ 37 ] .
establishing transcriptional and post - transcriptional feedback circuits gives cells , at the same time , sufficient flexibility to instruct specific differentiation programs , and the necessary robustness to maintain these programs throughout cell life [ 23 ] .
it is not surprising that interference with any of the components of these complex circuits often leads to hematopoietic malignancies [ 38 ] .
3. runx1 in hematopoiesis and leukemia 3.1 .
runx1 : a master regulator of hematopoiesis runx1 ( also known as aml1 and cbf alpha ) plays an essential role both in the generation of definitive hscs during embryonic development and in the maintenance of lineage differentiation during adult hematopoiesis ( for general reviews see [ 39 - 42 ]) .
runx1 was originally identified in acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) patients with t ( 8 ; 21 ) , where the fusion with the eto gene impairs its function [ 43 - 46 ] .
during mouse development , runx1 is expressed in specific subsets of endothelial cells in all embryonic and extraembryonic hematopoietic sites , even before the emergence of definitive hscs , thus suggesting a critical role in the hemogenic endothelium [ 11,42 ] .
indeed , homozygous runx1 knock out in mice is embryonic lethal due to extensive hemorrhages ( derived from primitive erythroblasts ) and complete absence of definitive hematopoietic progenitors and hscs in all hematopoietic sites [ 47,48 ] .
surprisingly , mice in which runx1 was conditionally knocked out in endothelial cells , displayed the same hematopoietic deficiencies observed in non - conditional runx1 knockout mice , while mice with runx1 conditional knock out in hematopoietic - committed cells still displayed definitive hematopoiesis [ 10 ] .
this finding shows that runx1 plays an essential role in the formation of hscs from the hemogenic endothelium , but its expression is no longer necessary for embryonic hematopoiesis once hscs have been established .
nevertheless , runx1 widespread expression in most adult hematopoietic lineages and hscs suggests a role also in post - natal hematopoiesis [ 49,50 ] .
according to a few studies , conditional runx1 knockout in adult hscs results in expansion of the lin - sca - c - kit + population ( putative hscs ) , but the same effect was not observed in other studies [ 10,51 - 54 ] .
a more consistent phenotype associated with conditional runx1 knockout in adult hscs is the expansion of myeloid progenitors , which may be due to a partial block of myeloid differentiation [ 52,53 ] .
runx1 deficient adult mice also showed impaired lymphoid and megakaryocytic differentiation , a reduced number of lymphoid progenitors , and thrombocytopenia [ 52,53 ] .
overall , runx1 seems to play a critical role as a differentiation inducer : first it is necessary for " differentiation " of endothelial cells into hscs , then it reduces hscs self - renewal and promotes differentiation of the myeloid , lymphoid and megakaryocytic lineages [ 39 ] .
runx1 function in hematopoiesis is determined by cell context - specific interactions with dna , other tfs , and co - factors .
the characterizing domain of runx1 is the n - terminal runt homology domain ( rhd ) , a conserved dna binding domain necessary both for the recognition of the dna consensus sequences 5 ' - puaccpuca - 3 ' [ 55 ] , and for binding to the co - factor cbf beta ( cbfb ) [ 56,57 ] .
cbfb does not interact with dna directly , but its binding strongly enhances runx1 dna - binding affinity and is necessary for runx1 function [ 56 - 58 ] .
the heterodimer formed by runx1 ( also called cbf alpha ) and cbfb is often referred to as a single functional unit , known as core binding factor ( cbf ) .
cbfb knock out in mice almost completely phenocopies runx1 knock out , resulting in ablation of definitive hematopoiesis and embryonic lethality [ 58,59 ] .
the c - terminus of runx1 contains regulatory regions that mediate the interaction with either transcriptional activators or transcriptional co - repressors [ 60 - 62 ]. by recruiting chromatin modifying enzymes such as the histone acetylases p300 , cbp and moz [ 60,63 ] , histone deacetylases ( via the co - repressors sin3a and groucho / tle ) [ 64 - 66 ] , or the polycomb repressive complex prc1 [ 67 ] , runx1 can locally modify the chromatin of specific target genes and either facilitate or impede their transcription .
the occurrence of activation or repression is apparently determined by the cell context , the promoter context , the local interaction with other tfs and , possibly also by runx1 post - translational modifications [ 39,40,68,69 ] .
during hsc formation , runx1 transcriptional activation seems to be the predominant function [ 42 ] .
indeed , a recent study shows that at the onset of definitive hematopoiesis , runx1 orchestrates global reorganization of lineage - specific tf assemblies with a concomitant increase in histone acetylation at specific regulatory elements [ 70 ] .
a number of direct target genes have been described to be regulated by runx1 , both in hematopoietic stem cells / precursors and more mature blood cells .
for instance , runx1 directly binds and activates pu.1 and cebpa , two transcription factors critical for determination of the myeloid and lymphoid lineage from hematopoietic precursors [ 71,72 ] .
in more committed cells , runx1 directly modulates the expression of multiple lineage - specific genes , including myeloid - specific growth factor signaling genes such as il - 3 , gm - csf , m - csf receptor ( csf1r ) , and genes relevant for myeloid function , such as mpo [ 73 - 76 ] .
in addition , as we will discuss later in this review , runx1 regulates micrornas involved in the development of different lineages .
3.2 .
runx1 perturbations in leukemia runx1 and cbfb are frequent targets of chromosomal abnormalities in hematopoietic malignancies , particularly in leukemia ( also referred to as cbf leukemia or cbfl ) .
runx1 is one of the most common targets of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemia [ 40 ] .
over 50 chromosome translocations affecting the runx1 gene on chromosome 21 and over 20 different partner genes have been described [ 40,77,78 ] .
one of the most recurrent translocations involving runx1 is the t ( 8 ; 21 ) , which is found in 30 % - 40 % of acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) fab - m2 [ 40,77 ] .
the t ( 8 ; 21 ) juxtaposes part of the runx1 gene with part of the eto ( mtg8 / runx1t1 ) gene on chromosome 8 , and results in the production of the chimeric protein runx1 - eto ( aml1 - eto / aml1 - mtg8 / runx1 - runx1t1 ) [ 43 - 46 ] .
this fusion protein retains the n - terminal , dna - binding rhd domain of runx1 , but loses the c - terminal regulatory regions of runx1 , which are replaced by the c - terminal functional domains of the eto protein .
eto belongs to the mtg family of transcriptional co - repressors and contains four conserved domains ( nhr regions ) that mediate homo / heterodimerization with other mtg proteins as well as interaction with histone deacetylases or other co - repressors [ 79 ] .
interestingly , another member of the mtg family , mtg16 , is also found fused to runx1 in aml with t ( 16 ; 21 ) translocation , and the resulting fusion protein runx1 - mtg16 ( aml1 - mtg16 ) shares most of the molecular features of runx1 - eto [ 79,80 ] .
several studies indicate that runx1 - mtg fusion proteins act in part as dominant negatives over wild type runx1 , as they competitively bind to runx1 consensus sequences of the same target genes , but they also bring about the repressive activities of the mtg moiety [ 81 - 84 ] .
indeed , runx1 - mtg proteins induce repressive chromatin changes at both dna and histone levels in the regulatory regions of many myeloid genes typically activated by runx1 , including csf1r , p14arf , and p21cip1 [ 85 - 88 ] .
however , it has been reported that runx1 - eto can also upregulate the expression of some runx1 - targets [ 89,90 ] as well as bind preferentially regions with duplicated runx1 consensus sequences [ 91 ] , suggesting that the effects of this fusion protein may involve a gain of function in addition to the loss of runx1 function .
mouse models indeed support this hypothesis .
early runx1 - eto knock - in mouse models were embryonic lethal and recapitulated many , but not all , of the phenotypes observed in runx1 ko mice [ 92,93 ] .
subsequent transgenic models in which runx1 - eto was expressed only in adult bone marrow overcame embryonic lethality , and showed an increased number of granulocyte / macrophage progenitors [ 94 ] .
this phenotype was similar to the one observed in runx1 conditional knockout mice , but no lymphocytopenia or thrombocytopenia was observed [ 94 ] .
common to all runx1 - eto animal models developed so far is the inability of the fusion protein to induce overt leukemia [ 94 - 96 ] , unless additional mutations are present [ 97 ] .
in line with these findings is the observation that up to 50 % of pediatric patients with t ( 8 ; 21 ) display the translocation already at birth , but overt leukemia occurs only years later [ 98 ] .
apparently , t ( 8 ; 21 ) cells remain in a " pre - leukemic " state until additional hits trigger leukemic growth .
similarly to runx1 , cbfb is also a target of chromosome rearrangements in leukemia .
approximately 3 % - 10 % of aml cases are characterized by inv ( 16 ) [ 38 ] , which leads to the fusion of the cbfb gene with myh11 ( coding for the smooth muscle heavy chain ) and the consequent production of the chimeric protein cbfb - myh11 [ 99,100 ] .
like aml1 - eto , although through a different mechanism , cbfb - myh11 acts as a dominant negative of the wild type runx1 / cbfb complex and leads to deregulation of runx1 - target genes [ 101 ] .
non - conditional transgenic expression of cbfb - myh11 in mice results in embryonic lethality with a phenotype similar to runx1 / cbfb knockout mice [ 102 ] , while conditional expression in the bone marrow results in an increase of the hsc population and abnormal myeloid progenitors [ 103 ] .
differently from aml1 - eto , expression of cbfb - myh11 seems sufficient to generate aml [ 103 ] .
a significant number of aml cases without karyotypic abnormalities involving runx1 or cbfb can still have an impaired cbf function , due to other factors such as point mutations , deletions , or simply transcriptional or post - transcriptional downregulation .
the identification of inherited mono - allelic runx1 intragenic deletions in familial platelet disorder ( fpd ) , which is associated with a higher risk to develop aml , points to runx1 haploinsufficiency , and not only runx1 translocations , as a leukemia pre - disposing factor [ 104 ] .
more recent large - scale sequencing studies have uncovered the occurrence of runx1 mutations in a significant percentage of aml and myelodysplastic syndrome ( mds ) [ 105 - 107 ] .
the most frequent mutations occur in the runx1 rhd domain and result in loss of the protein function [ 108 ] .
it is interesting to note that different mutations can result in different biological effects , which sometimes show gain of function relatively to the simple loss of runx1 [ 39,109 ] .
although runx1 mutations do not seem to be sufficient to trigger leukemia [ 39 ] , many of them are associated with poor outcome [ 110 ] .
it has been estimated that the combination of runx1 mutations and chromosome rearrangements affecting runx1 / cbfb may account for approximately 28 % of all adult aml cases [ 108 ] .
the dramatic biological consequences of runx1 hypomorphic mutations or monoallelic loss [ 111 ] indicate that runx1 dosage is indeed critical for normal hematopoiesis .
4. runx1 : a microrna hub in normal and malignant hematopoiesis 4.1 .
micrornas targeting runx1 runx1 is part of tf - mirna circuits that guarantee a robust transcriptional and post - transcriptional control of its expression during hematopoiesis .
runx1 expression is not only modulated by key hematopoietic tfs , such as gata2 , ets factors , scl [ 112 ] and by runx1 itself [ 113 ] , but also by an expanding number of mirnas .
basic in silico analyses with bioinformatics tools ( e.g. , targetscan ) predict over 60 conserved mirnas targeting the longest runx1 3'utr , many of which have been validated [ 37,114,115 ] ( figure 1 ) .
in particular , the mir - 17 - 92 cluster and mir - 27 seem to play an important role in regulating runx1 protein dosage and , consequently , runx1 function in hematopoietic differentiation .
the mir - 17 - 92 cluster is transcribed into six distinct mirnas , which include mir - 17 and mir - 20a [ 116 ] .
mir17 - 92 promotes cell proliferation and survival by targeting key tumor suppressors , such as p21cip21 and pten [ 117,118 ] , and is one of the first mirnas with a validated oncogenic activity [ 119 ] .
indeed , mir - 17 is frequently overexpressed in cancer , including lymphoma and leukemia [ 119 - 123 ] .
fontana et al. have shown that mir - 17 , mir - 20a , and the highly homologous mir - 106a , are expressed at high levels in early myeloid progenitors , but are downregulated during monocytic differentiation of human cd34 + cells [ 37 ] .
all three mirnas target conserved sites in the runx1 3'utr , and their downregulation results in increased runx1 levels .
runx1 upregulation , in turn , leads to increased transcription of its direct target gene for the macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor , csf1r , which promotes macrophage differentiation [ 37 ] .
remarkably , the mir - 17 and the mir - 106 clusters contain runx1 consensus sequences in their promoter regions , and their transcription can be directly repressed by runx1 through a mutual negative feedback loop .
this reciprocal inhibitory mechanism facilitates the switch from an undifferentiated state , in which high mir - 17 - 106 levels maintain low levels of runx1 and csf1r , to a differentiated state , where mir - 17 - 106 levels decrease to allow runx1 - mediated csf1r upregulation [ 37 ] ( figure 1 ) .
mir - 27 was identified as a candidate runx1 - targeting mirna through mirna prediction algorithms , and further validated experimentally by two independent groups [ 114,115 ] .
ben - ami et al. showed that mir - 27a binds the 3'utr of runx1 , attenuating its expression [ 114 ] .
since mir - 27a is transcriptionally regulated by runx1 in a feedback loop , the authors postulate that the upregulation of runx1 in the early hematopoietic stages positively regulates mir - 27a to attenuate runx1 level during megakaryopoiesis .
interestingly , mir - 27a increases upon induction of megakaryocytic differentiation of k562 cells , while it decreases during erythroid differentiation , suggesting a role in the determination of the erythroid / megakaryocytic lineages from the common precursor [ 114 ] ( figure 1 ) .
in addition , feng et al. reported that mir - 27 also plays a role in granulocytic differentiation [ 115 ] .
during csf3 ( granulocyte colony stimulating factor ) - induced granulocytic differentiation of 32d.cl3 cells , mir - 27 is upregulated concomitantly with runx1 downregulation .
gain - and loss - of - function experiments showed that indeed mir - 27 directly controls runx1 levels and affects granulocyte differentiation [ 115 ] .
runx1 acts as a repressor of the csf3 receptor ( csf3r ) [ 90 ] , and its downregulation by mir - 27 would promote granulocytic differentiation by preventing runx1 - mediated csf3r repression .
in this cell model , runx1 may not affect mir - 27 level directly , but through regulation of cebpa , a runx1 - target tf that induces mir - 27 transcription ( figure 1 ) .
microrna - mediated runx1 control can be modulated at multiple levels .
first , mirna action can be influenced by alternative splicing of the runx1 3'utr .
the runx1 gene encodes at least three splice variants , characterized by 3'utrs that differ both in sequence and size .
splice variant 1 and 2 ( aml1c and aml1b , respectively ) share the same 3'utr ( over 4000 bp ) and encode the longest runx1 protein isoforms , with similar structure and function .
splice variant 3 ( aml1a ) contains a very short 3'utr ( less than 400 bp ) with a different sequence from the 3'utr of the longer isoforms .
this variant encodes for the shortest runx1 protein isoform , which lacks most of the longer runx1 functional domains .
since the long and short runx1 isoforms seem to have antagonistic effects on myeloid differentiation and proliferation [ 124 ] , mirnas could produce diverse biological responses by differentially regulating the level of the various runx1 isoforms .
for instance , while mir - 27 can target the 3'utr of both short and long isoforms , even if with different repressive strength , mir - 17 can target only the 3'utr of the longer runx1 isoforms [ 114,115 ] .
in addition , mirna can affect runx1 dosage indirectly , by targeting tfs controlling runx1 transcription .
this seems to be the case of mir - 27 , which targets gata2 through a feedback loop [ 112,114 ] .
moreover , since runx1 can modulate its own transcription [ 113 ] , mirna - mediated runx1 post - transcriptional regulation could directly impact runx1 transcriptional control .
4.2 .
micrornas targeted by runx1 as we previously mentioned , runx1 directly modulates the transcription of entire coding gene networks through the recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymes .
it has become more and more apparent that runx1 can similarly control mirna genes endowed with runx1 - consensus sequences in their regulatory regions .
in two recent studies , runx1 occupancy was analyzed by chip - seq in different hematopoietic cells contexts [ 125,126 ] .
a more in depth analysis of these chip - seq data reveals that a remarkable number ( over 200 when two data sets are combined ) of mirna genes is physically bound by runx1 .
these studies suggest that runx1 regulates not only coding - gene networks , but also mirna networks .
indeed , several runx1 - target mirnas have been identified and validated .
these include the above mentioned mir - 17 and mir - 27 , which are part of runx1 - mirna regulatory loops , as well as other mirnas involved in hematopoietic differentiation and proliferation ( figure 1 ) .
the first runx1 - target mirna , mir - 223 , was identified due to its deregulation by the runx1 - eto fusion protein [ 127 ] .
in myeloid precursors , runx1 occupies a runx1 - binding site in the mir - 223 promoter and keeps the chromatin in a transcriptionally active state ; in t ( 8 ; 21 ) - positive cells , runx1 - eto competes with wild type runx1 for the mir - 223 runx1 - binding site and induces repressive chromatin modifications that silence the gene [ 127 ] .
mir - 223 targets a number of genes critical for granulocyte function and development .
mutant mice lacking mir - 223 display an increased number of granulocyte precursors , a phenotype that can be traced to the upregulation of the mir - 223 - target mef2c , a transcription factor that promotes myeloid progenitor proliferation [ 128 ] .
in addition , mir - 223 is part of at least two tf - mirna circuits that play a key role in granolupoiesis : the mir - 223 - cebpa - nfia circuit that we have previously mentioned [ 35 ] , and a feedback loop involving the transcription factor e2f1 [ 129 ] .
e2f1 is a mir - 223 target that inhibits granulopoiesis and induces myeloid cell cycle progression [ 129 ] .
induction of mir - 223 results in downregulation of e2f1 , thus leading to inhibition of cell cycle progression followed by myeloid differentiation .
since e2f1 represses mir - 223 transcription , its downregulation concurs to increase mir - 223 levels in a self - reinforcing loop [ 129 ] .
we recently found that runx1 is also a direct transcriptional regulator of the mir - 222 - 221 cluster .
mir - 221 and mir - 222 are highly homologous and target , among others , the tyrosine kinase receptor kit [ 130 ] .
upon binding to its ligand , the stem cell factor ( scf ) , kit activates downstream signaling pathways involved in survival , proliferation , and differentiation [ 131 ] .
kit plays a key role in maintaining self - renewal of hematopoietic stem cells at all developmental stages [ 132 ] .
during erythropoiesis , mir - 222 - 221 expression declines , and leads to increased kit protein levels and expansion of early erythropoietic cells [ 130 ] .
remarkably , kit is often overexpressed in cbf leukemia concomitantly with mir - 222 - 221 downregulation [ 133 ] , suggesting that mir - 222 - 221 may be under the transcriptional control of cbf ( i.e. , runx1 and cbfb ) .
indeed runx1 binds to a conserved consensus sequence in the mir - 222 - 221 promoter and induces its transcriptional activation [ 133 ] .
interestingly , kit appears to be targeted also by mir - 193 [ 134,135 ] and mir - 494 [ 136 ] , both of which contain runx1 consensus sequences in their promoter regions ( unpublished observations ) .
runx1 targets also other mirnas involved in hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation .
for instance , runx1 donwregulates mir - 181 [ 137 ] , which seems to function as a molecular switch during hematopoietic lineage progression [ 138 ] .
mir - 181 promotes megakaryocytic differentiation through repression of lin28 , and its inhibition has been shown to retard megakaryocytic differentiation in k562 cells [ 138 ] .
similarly , runx1 downregulates mir - 24 [ 137 ] , which plays a role in myeloid differentiation .
mir24 functions , at least in part , by downregulating mkp - 7 , a negative regulator of mapk signaling .
consistently , mir - 24 overexpression in myeloid progenitors results in a hyperproliferative phenotype and block of granulocytic differentiation [ 137 ] .
mir - 24 is part of the mir - 24 - 23 - 27 cluster , and runx1 directly interacts with consensus sequences in the promoter region of this cluster , repressing the transcription of the mir - 24 - 23 - 27 pri - mirna [ 137 ] .
however , in another study , runx1 binding to consensus sequences in the mir - 27 locus was instead associated with mir - 27 upregulation [ 114 ] .
further studies are needed to clearly dissect how runx1 regulates pri - mirna transcription as well as the level of the single mirnas derived from this cluster .
considering the number of mirnas containing runx1 - consensus sequences [ 125,126 ] , it is likely that runx1 positively or negatively modulates the transcription of many other target mirnas .
moreover , runx1 - target transcription factors , such as cebpa and pu.1 , can also modulate the transcription of several other mirnas relevant to hematopoiesis [ 139 - 142 ] .
thus , the range of runx1 - mediated mirna regulation could extend even further by encompassing not only direct mirna targets , but also indirect mirna targets via runx1 - regulated tfs .
4.3 .
deregulation of runx1 - related mirnas in leukemia both coding and mirna genes transcriptionally controlled by runx1 are frequently deregulated in leukemia due to perturbation of runx1 function .
as we briefly anticipated earlier in this review , the runx1 - eto fusion protein generated in t ( 8 ; 21 ) - positive aml directly downregulates mir - 223 through recruitment of histone deacetylases ( hdacs ) and dna methyl transferases ( dnmts ) , which impose repressive chromatin changes in the mir - 223 promoter [ 127 ] .
mir - 223 downregulation is common in t ( 8 ; 21 ) patients , and may directly contribute to leukemogenesis by preventing granulocyte differentiation and promoting myeloid progenitor proliferation [ 127,128 ] .
similarly , we found that runx1 - mtg fusion proteins can directly repress mir - 222 - 221 transcription through direct binding to conserved runx1 consensus sequences in the mir - 222 - 221 promoter [ 133 ] .
consistently , this mirna cluster is frequently downregulated in cbf leukemia patients , concomitantly with the upregulation of its target kit [ 133 ] .
upregulation of kit , in turn , confers to t ( 8 ; 21 ) cells a proliferative advantage , thus facilitating the transition from a pre - leukemic state to overt leukemia. through analogous mechanisms , cbf fusion proteins are expected to deregulate the expression of many other runx1 - target mirnas .
for instance , close inspection of published mirna profiling datasets shows that mir - 181 , which is downregulated by wild type runx1 , is consistently upregulated in t ( 8 ; 21 ) aml samples [ 120,137,143 ] .
in addition , both mir - 24 and mir - 27 have been found upregulated in cbf leukemia samples [ 120,137 ] , while mir - 17 and mir - 20a seem to be mostly downregulated [ 123,143 ] .
deregulation of runx1 - target mirnas , however , is often observed also in non - cbf leukemia samples , indicating that these mirnas can be targeted by other tfs , and / or that factors other than cytogenetic abnormalities can affect runx1 function or expression .
it is likely that other factors in addition to chromosome rearrangements can affect runx1 - target mirnas .
in this respect , it is particularly intriguing that deregulation of mirna targeting runx1 may result in deregulation of mirna targeted by runx1 .
since some of these mirnas act in feedback loops , the deregulation of runx1 could either reinforce or counteract itself according to the nature of the loop ( positive or negative feedback ) .
for example , mir - 17 upregulation , frequent in mll - rearranged acute leukemia [ 123 ] , would reduce runx1 levels and result in decreased runx1 - mediated mir - 17 transcriptional repression .
this feedback loop would reinforce mir - 17 upregulation and further impair runx1 expression .
in contrast , overexpression of mir - 27 , by decreasing runx1 , would lead to its own transcriptional downregulation .
it is of note that mirnas can affect runx1 function also by targeting cbfb .
a notable example is mir - 125b , which plays an important role in granulocyte differentiation and is often deregulated in hematopoietic malignancies ([ 144,145 ]) .
in addition , in silico analyses predict that many mirnas ( e.g. , mir - 27 ) can concomitantly target runx1 and cbfb , and that some runx1 - target mirnas ( e.g. , mir - 222 - 221 ) could affect their own transcription by targeting cbfb ( figure 2 ) .
mirna - based deregulation of runx1 expression could explain why non - cbf leukemias are often characterized by molecular defects , such as kit upregulation , typically produced by cbf karyotypic abnormalities .
however , decreasing runx1 expression may not necessarily recapitulate all the molecular and biological effects of cbf fusion proteins .
indeed , cbf fusion proteins not only act as runx1 dominant negatives , but display also gain of function properties , which could be due , for instance , to a different subcellular localization [ 137 ] , or preferential binding to specific consensus sequences [ 91 ] .
in addition , since mirna action can differentially affect runx1 isoforms depending on their 3'utr , mirna deregulation could yield different biological effects according to the runx1 isoforms targeted .
it is also interesting to note that the loss of the runx1 3'utr in some runx1 fusion genes ( e.g. , runx1 - eto ) , and not in others ( e.g. , tel - runx1 ) , should differentially affect their post - transcriptional regulation by runx1 - targeting mirnas , and could contribute to define their oncogenic function .
5. concluding remarks gene regulatory networks ( grns ) have evolved in different organisms to guarantee the appropriate level of complexity , flexibility , and robustness necessary for development and cellular homeostasis [ 23 ] .
grns typically have a modular and hierarchical structure , in which conserved smaller networks , or sub - circuits , with a given molecular / cellular function are combined to orchestrate cell fate [ 23 ] .
some of the best examples of these sub - circuits are represented by hematopoietic tf - mirna circuits , such as the one centered on runx1 .
runx1 is part of circuits involving both runx1 - targeting and runx1 - targeted mirnas .
the involvement of runx1 in different stages of hematopoiesis suggests that runx1 - based mirna - tf circuits represent basic modules in developmental grns , and that these modules have the necessary versatility to be combined with other modules to direct the differentiation of distinct hematopoietic lineages .
the centrality of runx1 circuits in hematopoiesis is further supported by the dramatic biological effects consequent to runx1 perturbation in hematopoietic malignancies ( e.g. , leukemia ) .
runx1 - centered regulatory circuits may not be restricted to hematopoiesis .
a growing number of studies report that runx1 is deregulated also in solid tumors , suggesting that runx1 may play a role in development / homeostasis of non - hematopoietic tissues [ 146 - 149 ] .
in particular , runx1 seems to play an important role in breast acinar morphogenesis [ 150 ] , and is frequently downregulated or mutated in breast cancer [ 149,151 - 154 ] .
the role of runx1 in breast acinar development may be linked to estrogen receptor alpha ( era ) signaling .
a recent genome - wide analysis has shown that prior to estradiol stimulation , runx1 is present at many era - binding sites to keep the chromatin in a permissive state for subsequent era recruitment [ 155 ] .
interestingly , mir - 222 - 221 is activated by runx1 and repressed by era [ 133,156 ] , suggesting an intertwined mechanism involving era , runx1 , and specific mirnas in breast cells .
in summary , runx1 seems to be a relevant hub of mirna - regulated cell - specific circuits with diverse roles in multiple aspects of differentiation and development .
thus , deregulation of runx1 - mirna circuits is expected to be critical not only in the pathogenesis of leukemia , but also of other malignancies .

cancer inst 2010 102 706 721 20388878 figure 1 ( a ) runx1 is a hub of mirnas targeting runx1 and mirnas targeted by runx1 .
a number of mirnas (> 60 predicted by targetscan , of which shown are only the ones experimentally validated ) can inhibit runx1 protein expression by targeting the 3'utr of runx1 mrna .
runx1 is predicted to target more than 200 mirnas ( shown are only the ones experimentally validated ) and either repress or activate their transcription .
some mirnas , such as mir - 17 and mir - 27 , in turn can target runx1 in a feedback loop ( dotted arrow ) .
( b ) examples of possible runx1 - mirna feedback loops involved in megakaryocytic , monocytic , and granulocytic differentiation .
in the latter case , runx1 may control mir - 27 transcription indirectly , via ccaat / enhancer - binding protein alpha ( cebpa ) ( dotted arrow ) .
figure 2 several factors can potentially disrupt runx1 - mirna circuits , including deregulation of runx1 - targeting mirnas .
runx1 function has been shown to be deregulated by altered runx1 dosage ( haploinsufficiency ) , point mutations , or chromosomal rearrangements ( e.g. , t ( 8 ; 21 ) , producing runx1 - eto ) .
in addition , runx1 expression could be affected by deregulation of mirnas targeting runx1 .
the impairment of runx1 function would lead to deregulation of runx1 - target genes , including mirnas ( in red are shown the runx1 - target mirnas known to be repressed by runx1 - eto , while in black are shown other established runx1 - target mirnas ) .
deregulation of mir - 223 and mir - 222 - 221 by runx1 - eto is known to affect their targets , nf1a and kit .
since runx1 can target , and be targeted by , the same mirnas , deregulation of wild type runx1 may be reinforced or weakened through a feedback loop ( dotted arrow ) .
similarly , runx1 function could be affected by impairment of its heterodimeric partner cbfb , which could be subjected to mirna - mediated deregulation in addition to known chromosomal rearrangements .

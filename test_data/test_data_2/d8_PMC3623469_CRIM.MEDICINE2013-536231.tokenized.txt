sporadic inclusion - body myositis ( s - ibm ) is a myopathy that is characterized by progressive weakness and muscle pathology demonstrating inflammation and rimmed vacuoles .
in addition , similar to the pathology observed in the brains of patients with alzheimer 's disease , the deposition of beta - amyloid and phosphorylated tau proteins in muscle fibers has been reported .
these shared pathologic features have prompted hypotheses suggesting a shared etiology of these two conditions .
we report a case of a 73 - year - old woman initially diagnosed with s - ibm who later developed alzheimer 's disease .
1. introduction sporadic inclusion - body myositis ( s - ibm ) is a muscle disease which presents with slowly progressive proximal and distal weakness .
clinically , it is characterized by early onset weakness and atrophy of the quadriceps , finger flexors and foot dorsiflexors [ 1 ] .
it is the most common myopathy in individuals over age 50 years [ 2 ] .
the diagnosis is confirmed by characteristic findings on muscle biopsy demonstrating endomysial inflammation , eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions , and rimmed vacuoles .
the cause for s - ibm is not known ; however a number of pathophysiologic mechanisms have been proposed .
these include overexpression of amyloid beta precursor protein ( app ) , deposition of beta - amyloid , c - and n - terminal app fragments , hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins , abnormal accumulation of components related to lipid metabolism , oxidative stress , abnormal signal transduction , transcription and rna accumulation , and lymphocytic inflammation [ 3 - 7 ] .
some of these pathophysiological mechanisms and pathologic abnormalities are similar to those observed in the brains of patients with alzheimer 's disease [ 3 , 7 ] .
this observation has led to theories of a shared pathophysiology between these two disparate disorders [ 7 ] .
there is a precedent for brain and muscle involvement in one disorder : inclusion - body myopathy , paget 's disease of the bone , and frontotemporal dementia ( ibmpfd ) [ 8 ] .
in this autosomal dominant disease , inclusion - body myopathy is associated with frontotemporal dementia and is caused by mutations in the valosin containing protein gene .
this condition confirms that mutation of a shared protein can result in disease affecting both brain and muscle tissues .
in spite of the high prevalence of alzheimer 's disease , there are few reports of patients with coexisting s - ibm [ 2 ] .
we report a patient who initially presented with symptoms and signs consistent with s - ibm and subsequently developed alzheimer 's disease .
2. case presentation a 73 - year - old woman presented to neuromuscular clinic at the neuroscience institute / jfk hospital , edison , new jersey , usa , with complaints of weakness .
she had difficulty climbing up and down stairs , arising from a deep - seated chair and using her arms above her head .
these symptoms had slowly progressed over 5 years prior to presentation .
there were no complaints of sensory loss , difficulty speaking , chewing , swallowing , diplopia , or cognitive complaints .
her neurological examination showed a normal mental status and cranial nerve examination .
her deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical : + 2 / 4 in upper extremities , + 1 / 4 at the patellae , and unobtainable at the ankles .
her plantar reflexes were flexor .
muscle strength testing showed diffuse weakness ( mrc grade 4 / 5 ) testing the following : neck flexion , wrist flexion and extension , biceps , triceps , supraspinatus , and internal and external rotation .
the most profound upper extremity weakness was testing the finger flexors .
she could not make a fist .
she had 4 / 5 weakness of hip flexion and 3 / 5 weakness of the tibialis anterior muscles bilaterally .
atrophy was noted of the forearms , quadriceps , and tibialis anterior muscles bilaterally .
sensory examination disclosed normal light touch , pin prick , vibration , and proprioception in her arms and legs .
she had no tremor or ataxia .
she was unable to tandem walk or walk on her heels or toes .
routine serum chemistries were normal except for a cpk of 470 ( normal < 165 ) and an aldolase of 12.4 ( normal range 0 - 7 ) .
electrophysiological testing showed normal nerve conduction parameters in all motor ( ulnar , median , personal and tibial ) and sensory ( ulnar , median , radial , superficial , and sural ) nerves tested .
needle electromyogram showed increased irritability but no abnormal spontaneous activity in any muscle sampled .
further analysis disclosed low amplitude motor units , early recruitment , and a full interference pattern with submaximal effort .
overall , the study was consistent with a myopathy with minimal inflammatory features .
a muscle biopsy of the right tibialis anterior muscle was performed and showed scattered rimmed vacuoles in the end - stage muscle , compatible with a diagnosis of inclusion - body myositis ( figure 1 ) .
she was treated for 6 months with ivig ( 2 grams / kilogram ) by slow intravenous infusion on a monthly basis .
although she felt an increase in strength , there was no objective evidence of improvement and it was ultimately discontinued .
approximately three years after initial diagnosis , she started to develop symptoms of cognitive decline with difficulties in memory , speech , and attention .
reexamination five years after the initial evaluation showed she was disoriented to time , place , and person and could not follow a 2 - step command .
she was not able to calculate and had poor attention .
her tests of short - and long - term memory were impaired .
further cognitive testing revealed transcortical sensory aphasia , frontal lobe dysfunction with reduced fluency and perseveration .
investigations for dementia were performed and the following tests were normal or negative : thyroid function studies , rapid plasma reagin , and serum vitamin b12 .
a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain disclosed moderate atrophy with no evidence of multiple infarcts or hydrocephalus .
a neuromuscular reexamination performed at this time showed increased weakness of the same muscle groups as documented in the prior examination .
3. discussion the prevalence of s - ibm has been estimated at 51 per million in people over age 50 years .
in an observational study of 35 s - ibm patients the age adjusted prevalence rate for individuals over the age 45 years was 28.9 x 10 - 6 .
the mean age at onset was 70.0 years with only two patients who developed weakness before age 50 years [ 9 ] .
the age adjusted prevalence of alzheimer 's disease is reported as 4.4 % in people over the age of 65 years .
this frequency increases with each decade with a nearly fifteen - fold increase in the prevalence in individuals between 60 and 85 years [ 10 ] .
in spite of the high frequency of alzheimer ' disease , it is interesting to note that there is only one report of a patient with both of these disorders .
this is a case of a 65 - year - old woman who presented with the symptoms and signs consistent with s - ibm and the subsequent diagnosis of alzheimer 's disease [ 2 ] .
there are several similarities between our patient and the subject of the previous report .
both are women in whom the initial presentation and diagnosis were those of s - ibm with the subsequent development of alzheimer 's disease .
the presentation in these patients may provide a clue to the infrequency of the reported association of these two disorders .
although both disorders do show an increase in incidence with age , alzheimer 's disease is more frequent than s - ibm .
this initial diagnosis of alzheimer 's disease could result in decreased chance of a subsequent diagnosis of s - ibm for several reasons .
firstly as cognitive decline develops , the patients themselves may be less likely to voice any complaints of muscle weakness .
secondly as the cognitive decline continues , the patients become less mobile and medical caregivers may ascribe the development of atrophy or weakness to deconditioning rather than coexisting muscle disease .
a number of theories have been proposed indicating that alzheimer 's disease and s - ibm share a similar pathogenesis. whether these two cases support these theories or represent a chance association will be confirmed by further studies .
such studies are important as they will not only provide clues to the development of both disorders but also may facilitate the development of shared therapeutic agents .

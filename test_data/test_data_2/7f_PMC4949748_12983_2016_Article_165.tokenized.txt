background dewlaps are iconic features of several ungulate species and , although a role in signalling has been postulated , their function remains largely unexplored .
we recently failed to find any age - independent link between dewlap size and social status in the common eland ( tragelaphus oryx ) , pointing to the possibility that sexual selection may not be the primary cause of dewlap evolution in ungulates .
here i use a two - pronged approach to test hypotheses on the function of ungulate dewlaps : an interspecific comparative analysis of bovids and deer , and an intraspecific study of eland antelopes in the wild .
results across species , the presence of dewlaps in males was not found to be associated with sexual size dimorphism , a commonly used measure of the intensity of sexual selection .
the presence of dewlaps was , however , linked to very large male body size (> 400 kg ) , which agrees with a thermoregulatory function as lower surface / volume - ratio counteracts heat dissipation in large - bodied species .
in eland antelopes , large dewlap size was associated with higher , rather than lower , incidence of claw - marks ( independently of age ) , a result which speaks against the dewlap as a predator deterrent and rather indicates a predation cost of the structure .
conclusion the findings suggest that , although an additional function in communication should not be ruled out , the dewlap of ungulates may contrast with that of lizards and birds in thermoregulation being a primary function .
keywords natural selection signal evolution ornaments male competition female mate choice claw - marks bovidae cervidae mammalia natural environment research council ( gb ) ep / e50065x / 1issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background extravagant ornament - like male morphologies that are sexually dimorphic are often assumed to have evolved by sexual selection to signal individual quality , either owing to female mate choice , male - male combat or both [ 1 , 2 ] .
however , often other explanations are possible and the importance of examining alternative hypotheses has recently been stressed [ 3 ] .
dewlaps , i.e. loose skin flaps hanging from the neck , are a case in point .
these striking yet enigmatic structures are found in various vertebrate taxa , notably iguanid and agamid lizards , birds and ungulates .
to date , studies of dewlap evolution and function have focused almost entirely on lizards and , to a lesser extent , birds .
in lizards , a function of the often colourful dewlap in intraspecific communication is indicated by the fact that the dewlap is moveable and dewlap extensions constitute part of male territorial displays , with the display rate increasing during both intra - and intersexual encounters [ 4 , 5 ] .
however , recent studies suggest that rather than directly reflecting male competitive ability , a selective advantage of the dewlap may arise from drawing attention to head - bob and push - up displays [ 3 ] .
in birds , dewlaps - often referred to as wattles - are present as a diverse set of fleshy excrescences pending from the neck in several taxa ( in particular cassowaries and galliformes ) .
like in lizards , they are more pronounced in males than females and are thought to function as sexual signals of male quality [ 6 ] .
the dewlap in ungulates has so far evaded rigorous investigation and its function remains a puzzle .
in spite of some structural similarity with the dewlaps of lizards and birds , whether ungulate dewlaps have evolved as a result of the same selective pressures remains an open question .
as in lizards and birds , sexual dimorphism is pronounced in the dewlap of ungulates , but both sexual and natural selection could have affected the sexes differently to create this pattern .
according to the ' sexual selection hypothesis ' , the dewlap of ungulates , like in lizards and birds , has evolved because of a function in intra - and / or intersexual signalling .
different scenarios can be imagined .
firstly , the dewlap may be an honest signal of age - related fighting ability .
evidence from the common eland ( tragelaphus oryx ) shows that dewlaps increase monotonically in size with age and the dewlap could thus provide meaningful information about fighting skills gained through experience [ 7 , 8 ] .
another possibility is that the dewlap serves a deceptive function during rival assessment by exaggerating the body size perceived by opponents [ 3 , 9 ] .
here it is worth noting that agonistic encounters in many ungulate species involve broadside displays where males assess the body size of rivals in lateral view ; it is indeed from this perspective that the two - dimensional dewlap creates the most convincing illusion ( fig. 1 ). fig. 1 broadside display between two eland bulls alternatively , according to the ' predator deterrent hypothesis ' , the dewlap has its selective advantage in communication with predators rather than conspecifics [ 10 ] .
small ungulates are vulnerable to a wider range of predators than large ungulates [ 11 , 12 ] , and by enhancing apparent body size , dewlaps could thus deter predator attacks .
similar intimidating effects can explain a wide range of antipredator responses in vertebrates : piloerection in mammals , feather puffing in birds , anterior flattening in snakes , and body inflation in toads , frogs and fishes ( although the latter also interferes with swallowing ) [ 13 ] .
also conceivable is that the dewlap has evolved as a condition - dependent handicap signal [ 14 ] .
according to this idea , the dewlap makes it easier for predators to get a hold on their prey , and because only ' high quality ' individuals can develop large dewlaps without incurring prohibitive predation costs , the structure signals that an individual will be difficult to kill , thereby discouraging attacks .
such a condition - dependent handicap signal could also function as a ' quality ' indicator that intimidates rivals and / or attracts mates , hence showing a potential link to the sexual selection hypothesis .
finally , according to the ' thermoregulation hypothesis ' , the selective advantage of the dewlap comes from facilitating the dissipation of excess body heat by convection , an idea proposed to explain the presence of dewlaps in dinosaurs [ 15 , 16 ] .
overheating is a particular challenge for larger species owing to their lower surface / volume ratio , and the potential force of this selective pressure is illustrated by the evolution of large ears in elephants [ 17 ] , where it is also noteworthy that the larger species has the proportionally largest ears ( i.e. 6,300 kg of large males in the african elephant loxodonta africana vs. 5,300 kg in the asian elephant elaphus maximus ) .
infrared measurements have confirmed the dewlap in the common eland as a site of high heat loss [ 18 ]. from these hypotheses follow various predictions at both the inter - and intraspecific level , and in this paper , i therefore combine a comparative approach , investigating differences between species , with an intraspecific field study on the common eland , a nomadic savannah antelope in which males develop large dewlaps drooping up to more than 40 cm beneath their necks .
quantifying predation is notoriously difficult in ungulate field studies because attacks usually take place when observation is difficult , i.e. at night and in dense vegetation .
as a proxy measure , i therefore use claw - marks , the usefulness of which as an indicator of predation attempts have recently been highlighted [ 19 ] .
because the dewlap in ungulates is sexually dimorphic , the analyses are focused on males , where the structure is most pronounced .
according to the sexual selection hypothesis , i predict that the presence of dewlaps among species is linked to sexual body size dimorphism , a frequently used index for the intensity of sexual selection [ 2 , 3 , 20 ] .
according to the predator deterrent hypothesis , where large dewlap size is associated with reduced attack rate by predators , i predict a negative correlation between dewlap size and the prevalence of claw - marks within species .
specifically , if dewlaps have evolved owing to the handicap principle , i predict that scars from past predation attempts will be located on the dewlap , by which the animal is hypothesized to be seized .
according to the thermoregulation hypothesis , i predict that dewlaps are associated with large - bodied species , and that a threshold exists above which the low surface / volume ratio favours the evolution of dewlaps to facilitate heat dissipation .
methods interspecific study : comparative analysis a dataset was compiled focusing on all extant bovids and cervids including the following variables : presence / absence of dewlaps in males , mean male body mass , and sexual size dimorphism ( ssd ) , which was calculated as male body mass divided by female body mass .
the data were obtained from the sources : [ 9 , 20 - 27 ] .
the presence of dewlaps in males was entered as the binary response variable in a phylogenetic generalized linear mixed model for binary data ( binary pglmm ) .
the analyses were performed in r [ 28 ] with the packages ' ape ' [ 29 , 30 ] and ' caper ' [ 31 ] .
the explanatory variables were male body mass and ssd ( both log10 - transformed ) ; these were tested in bivariate models as well as in a multivariate model with backward elimination of non - significant predictors ( p < 0.05 ) .
control for evolutionary dependence was based on the phylogenetic tree reported in [ 32 ] .
intraspecific study : eland field study study system : eland males were studied between 2005 and 2013 in a 710 km2 area within the masai mara national reserve and olare orok , motorogi and naboisho conservancies in kenya .
the habitat was dominated by open grass plains with only scattered thickets and hence good visibility .
the eland is a large , sexually dimorphic antelope ( males : 450 - 942 kg , females : 317 - 470 kg [ 33 ]) , foraging on both grass and browse [ 34 ] .
they are non - territorial and gregarious , their main social units being solitary males , male herds of 2 - 20 individuals , and larger mixed herds with up to more than a hundred individuals [ 8 ] .
the main predator of male eland in the study area is the lion ( panthera leo ) ; younger animals are occasionally killed by spotted hyenas ( crocuta crocuta ) , leopards ( panthera pardus ) and , even more rarely , cheetahs ( acinonyx jubatus ) [ 35 - 38 ] .
data collection : as part of a larger study , data were collected annually between february and may during the wet season by surveying the study area for eland in a four - wheel - drive vehicle on a total of 266 days .
for each observation , the identity of males were recorded based on their distinctive stripe pattern , ear nicks , scars , and tail and horn abnormalities , with identification details stored on paper sheets and in a digital library of bilateral photographs .
for morphological measurements using photometry , individuals were photographed while standing relaxed , and their distance was measured by laser rangefinder ( bushnell yardage pro 800 ) .
the measurements in pixels on the photographs were converted to the metric scale using a calibrated reference scale based on photographs of a 1 m pole at a range of distances [ 7 ] .
body size was measured as the body depth , i.e. the maximum vertical girth of the chest .
dewlap size was measured by the maximum vertical droop beneath the neck .
repeatability was high [ 7 ] .
scars from the claws of big cats , distinctive in the alignment of 4 - 5 scratches [ 19 ] ( fig. 2 ) , were recorded as present / absent in the field , with supplementary observations in the digital photo library .
age was estimated upon first sighting of an individual , primarily based on horn rotation , horn wear , and development of hair fringes and hair tufts , following the protocol described in [ 8 ] .
complete measurements were obtained for 212 individual males. fig. 2 a a young male eland with claw - marks on his flank still bleeding .
b an older male with claw - mark scars on his flank and hindquarters .
c claw - mark scars on the rump of a male estimated at 3 years old ( 2007 ) .
d the same scar as in c six years later ( 2013 ) statistical analysis : the presence / absence of claw - marks was modelled as the response variable in two multivariate logistic regression models , a generalized linear mixed model ( gzlmm ) and a generalized linear model ( gzlm ) .
in the gzlmm , male identity was entered to control for correlated random effects owing to multiple measurements from the same individuals , whereas only one , randomly selected , observation per male was included in the gzlm .
in both models , dewlap droop was included as a predictor variable , together with age and body size in order to control for confounding effects .
non - significant predictors were excluded by backward elimination ( p < 0.05 ) , and results relating to the non - significant predictors refer to their separate inclusion in the final model .
variance inflation factors ( vifs ) were calculated to assess the potential for multicollinearity between dependent variables to affect the results [ 39 ] .
these analyses were performed in spss version 21 ( ibm , armonk , ny , u.s.a. ) .
results interspecific study : comparative analysis among species , the presence of dewlaps in males was predicted by large male body mass , but not by the degree of ssd ( table 1 ) .
these results agree with the thermoregulation hypothesis and speak against the sexual selection hypothesis .
all the species in which males had dewlaps were characterized by a mean male body mass above 400 kg , i.e. gaur ( bos frontalis , 848 kg ) , kouprey ( bos sauveli , approx. 800 kg ) , banteng ( bos javanicus , 750 kg ) , giant eland ( tragelaphus derbianus , 680 kg ) , common eland ( 647 kg ) , and moose ( alces alces , 440 kg ) ; in less than 3 % of the species without dewlap did males weigh above this threshold ( i.e. five out of 171 species ; see discussion ) .
table 1 predictors of the presence of dewlaps in males within the bovidae and cervidae ( binary pglmm : n = 133 species ; phylogenetic signal : male body mass [ log10 ] : s2 = 3.19 , p < 0.001 ) bivariate analyses multivariate analysis coefficient (+/ - sem ) z p coefficient (+/ - sem ) z p male body mass ( log10 ) 3.59 +/ - 1.55 2.32 0.021 3.59 +/ - 1.55 2.32 0.021 sexual body - size dimorphism ( log10 ) 0.984 +/ - 2.538 0.39 0.698 - 620 +/ - 6.32 - 0.98 0.326 intraspecific study : eland field study the incidence of claw - marks was positively , rather than negatively , related to dewlap size ( logistic gzlmm : n = 381 observations on 212 males [ 34 of which were observed both with and without scars ] ; intercept : 3.67 , p < 0.001 ; dewlap : t = 4.96 , p < 0.001 , vif = 2.144 ; age : t = 1.553 , p = 0.122 , vif = 2.596 ; body size : t = 0.385 , p = 0.700 , vif = 2.118 ; logistic gzlm : n = 212 males : intercept : 3.05 , p < 0.001 ; dewlap : : chi2 = 8.53 , p = 0.004 , vif = 2.178 ; age : chi2 = 0.823 , p = 0.364 , vif = 2.602 ; body size : chi2 = 0.028 , p = 0.868 , vif = 2.113 ; fig. 3a ) .
this speaks against the predator deterrent hypothesis and rather suggests a predation cost of large dewlaps .
the robustness of the results to multicollinearity between dependent variables is supported by all vifs being significantly below the threshold of 5 .
contrary to the proposition that dewlaps may be condition - dependent handicaps , scars were not observed on the dewlap itself , with the majority of claw - marks located on the rump and flanks .
the incidence of claw - marks increased from below 20 % at 2 years to above 50 % in animals of 9 years and above ( fig. 3b ). fig. 3 a dewlap droop in males with and without claw - marks according to age .
b prevalence of claw - marks in relation to age .
columns and error bars indicate the mean and its standard error ; numbers above columns refer to sample sizes discussion on the balance of the current evidence , benefits from thermoregulation emerge as a plausible main driver of the evolution of the ungulate dewlap ( table 2 ) .
dewlaps have evolved independently among the very largest species within several ungulate radiations , namely the bovines , the tragelaphines and the cervids .
overheating is a particular problem for large species in hot climates , and the five species , in which males weigh above the 400 kg threshold but have not evolved dewlaps , either live in cold areas or have evolved alternative , behavioural , cooling mechanisms .
the african buffalo ( syncerus caffer , 643 kg ) and the water buffalo ( bubalis bubalis , 1,200 kg ) regularly cool their body temperature by wallowing , and the wild yak ( bos grunniens , 591 kg ) , american bison ( bison bison , 795 kg ) and european bison ( bison bonasus , 718 kg ) inhabit boreal and temperate climates .

in male eland antelopes , we found no link between dewlap size and status as master bull in mixed - sex herds , and an association with dominance status in all - male herds disappeared after controlling for age [ 8 ] .
consistent with this , in the present study dewlaps were not found to have evolved more often in those species where pronounced sexual size dimorphism suggests intense sexual selection .
while the sexual dimorphism of the dewlap itself , which is often minimal or absent in female ungulates , is consistent with the sexual selection hypothesis , it is also consistent with the thermoregulation hypothesis as females are markedly smaller than males in all species with dewlaps ; females are indeed close to the 400 kg threshold with weights around 350 - 450 kg in all species except the gaur ( 702 kg ) and possibly the kouprey ( no data ) .
at present , the most parsimonious interpretation of the link between claw - marks and large dewlap size is that benefits of large dewlaps in other contexts trade off against costs from increased predation risk , possibly because of lower running speed .
however , conceivable is also an alternative explanation derived from the idea of the dewlap as a sexually selected handicap : rather than signalling the ability to flee , the dewlap could signal the ability to successfully fight off predators , in which case an association between large dewlaps and the presence of scars would indeed be expected .
still , against expectation remains the absence of scars on the dewlap itself since this is where the animals are hypothesized to be seized .
at 30 % , the proportion of adult eland males with claw - marks , presumably primarily from lions , was comparable to figures found in another large savannah herbivore which share the lion as its main predator : the prevalence of claw - marks on adult female giraffes ( giraffa camelopardalis ) in three study areas within the serengeti - mara ecosystem was found to be 4 % , 26 % and 32 % [ 19 ] .
the prevalence of claw - marks may be related to the observation that eland do not usually flee from lions [ 33 ] .
conclusions all in all , the present evidence suggests that the dewlap in ungulates may be the result of convergent evolution under different selective pressures than those thought to underlie dewlaps in lizards and birds .
attaining very large body sizes in hot environments , the ungulate species in which dewlaps have evolved face a significant challenge to dissipate excess body heat .
the structure is thus likely to facilitate temperature regulation , but a trade - off in terms of enhanced predation risk is suggested by the higher incidence of claw - marks in individuals with large dewlaps .
ruling out a communicative function of the dewlap on the basis of the present study would be premature and this remarkable trait , which has attracted considerable scientific attention in other taxa , warrants further study in ungulates .

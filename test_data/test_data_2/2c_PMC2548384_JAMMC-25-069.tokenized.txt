in the recent past , compliance with 21cfr11 has become a major buzzword within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries .
while commercial solutions exist , implementation and validation are expensive and cumbersome .
frequent implementation of new features via point releases further complicates purchasing decisions by making it difficult to weigh the risk of non - compliance against the costs of too frequent upgrades .
this presentation discusses a low - cost interim solution to the problem .
while this solution does not address 100 % of the issues raised by 21cfr11 , it does implement and validate : ( 1 ) computer system security ; ( 2 ) backup and restore ability on the electronic records store ; and ( 3 ) an automated audit trail mechanism that captures the date , time and user identification whenever electronic records are created , modified or deleted .
when coupled with enhanced procedural controls , this solution provides an acceptable level of compliance at extremely low cost .

background low levels of serum adiponectin have been linked to central obesity , insulin resistance , metabolic syndrome , and type 2 diabetes .
variants in adipoq , the gene encoding adiponectin , have been shown to influence serum adiponectin concentration , and along with variants in the adiponectin receptors ( adipor1 and adipor2 ) have been implicated in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes .
this study aimed to comprehensively investigate the association of common variants in adipoq , adipor1 and adipor2 with serum adiponectin and insulin resistance syndromes in a large cohort of european - australian individuals .
methods sixty - four tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms in adipoq , adipor1 and adipor2 were genotyped in two general population cohorts consisting of 2,355 subjects , and one cohort of 967 subjects with type 2 diabetes .
the association of tagsnps with outcomes were evaluated using linear or logistic modelling .
meta - analysis of the three cohorts was performed by random - effects modelling .
results meta - analysis revealed nine genotyped tagsnps in adipoq significantly associated with serum adiponectin across all cohorts after adjustment for age , gender and bmi , including rs10937273 , rs12637534 , rs1648707 , rs16861209 , rs822395 , rs17366568 , rs3774261 , rs6444175 and rs17373414 .
the results of haplotype - based analyses were also consistent .
overall , the variants in the adipoq gene explained < 5 % of the variance in serum adiponectin concentration .
none of the adipor1 / r2 tagsnps were associated with serum adiponectin .
there was no association between any of the genetic variants and insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome .
a multi - snp genotypic risk score for adipoq alleles revealed an association with 3 independent snps , rs12637534 , rs16861209 , rs17366568 and type 2 diabetes after adjusting for adiponectin levels ( or = 0.86 , 95 % ci =( 0.75 , 0.99 ) , p = 0.0134 ) .
conclusions genetic variation in adipoq , but not its receptors , was associated with altered serum adiponectin .
however , genetic variation in adipoq and its receptors does not appear to contribute to the risk of insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome but did for type 2 diabetes in a european - australian population .
adiponectin adipoq adipor type 2 diabetes insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome background adiponectin is the most abundant adipose tissue - derived cytokine .
it has anti - inflammatory , anti - diabetic and anti - atherogenic properties , and low circulating levels are associated with central obesity , insulin resistance , metabolic syndrome ( mets ) , and type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) [ 1 ] .
serum adiponectin concentrations are highly heritable , and a number of genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) have identified adipoq , the gene encoding adiponectin , as the main locus contributing to variations in serum levels in european and asian populations [ 2 - 5 ] .
cross - sectional studies in healthy and diabetic populations have provided further evidence for the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) in adipoq with serum adiponectin concentrations [ 6 - 10 ] .
several studies have linked adipoq variants to t2d and mets , although the results to date have been discordant and not replicated across whole populations [ 5,8 - 12 ] .
nevertheless , examining the genes which affect serum adiponectin levels may help to confirm adiponectin as a cause or consequence of mets and t2d using a mendelian randomisation approach [ 13 ] .
adiponectin cellular signalling is mediated by two adiponectin receptors .
the genes for these ( adipor1 and adipor2 ) , although generally not associated with serum adiponectin , have themselves been implicated in insulin resistance and t2d risk in genetic association studies , but also with inconsistent results [ 14 - 18 ] .
in light of this background , the aims of the present study were i ) to examine the evidence for association between total serum adiponectin levels and variants in adipoq and adipor1 / r2 using a comprehensive tagsnp approach and haplotype - based analysis , ii ) to assess associations between snps in these genes and total serum adiponectin concentrations in large , well - characterised and independent western australian cohorts ( two general population and one adult t2d cohort ) , and iii ) to investigate the relationship between gene variants found to be associated with adiponectin levels and relevant clinical outcomes including mets and t2d .
methods subjects this study examined subjects from three western australian cohorts : the busselton population health survey ( bhs ) [ 19 ] , the carotid ultrasound disease assessment study ( cudas ) [ 20 ] and the fremantle diabetes study ( fds ) [ 21 ] .
the bhs and cudas cohorts are representative of the general population and do not contain individuals with t2d , while fds contains individuals with t2d who are representative of people with diabetes in an urban australian setting .
these cohorts are predominantly european - australian .
the present study was restricted to individuals who had both serum adiponectin and genotyping data available .
the subset of the bhs cohort with available data consisted of 1,322 unrelated adult individuals who were recruited as part of a larger cross - sectional community study in 1994 / 1995 [ 22 ] .
the cudas cohort comprised 1,033 individuals selected from a random electoral survey from the perth metropolitan area [ 20 ] .
the fds cohort of 967 diabetic individuals was recruited from a longitudinal observational study [ 21 ] .
all study participants gave written informed consent , and the study protocol was approved by the university of western australia human research ethics committee , the busselton population medical research foundation , and the human rights committee at fremantle hospital .
biochemical and anthropomorphic analyses a fasting blood sample was obtained from each subject .
total serum adiponectin levels were measured by a commercially available quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique ( r & d systems inc. , minneapolis , minnesota , usa ) .
the intra - assay coefficients of variation ranged from 2.1 to 4.3 % and the inter - assay coefficients of variation ranged from 5.4 to 9.6 % .
plasma glucose , insulin , total cholesterol , ldl - and hdl - cholesterol , and triglycerides were determined by standard methods [ 19 - 21 ] .
insulin resistance ( ir ) was determined using the homeostatic model of assessment scores ( lnhoma - ir ) [ 23 ] .
anthropometric measurements and resting blood pressure were taken according to standard clinical procedures .
body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated as weight ( kg )/ height ( m ) 2 .
metabolic syndrome ( mets ) was defined according to the recently updated national cholesterol education program ( ncep ) criteria [ 24 ] .
individuals with three or more of the following criteria were classified as having mets : increased waist circumference (>= 102 cm in men , >= 88 cm in women ) , hypertriglyceridaemia >= 1.70 mmol / l (>= 150 mg / dl ) , low hdl - cholesterol < 1.00 mmol / l in men and < 1.3 mmol / l in women (< 40 mg / dl and < 50 mg / dl ) , high blood pressure ( systolic >= 130 and / or diastolic >= 85 mm hg , or current use of antihypertensive therapy ) and high fasting glucose >= 5.6 mmol / l (>= 100 mg / dl ) .
data for clinical and demographic characteristics ( table 1 ) are given as proportions , mean +/ - sd , or geometric mean ( sd range ) .

the data for continuous variables is mean +/ - standard deviation , or geometic mean ( standard deviation range ) .
the data for categorical variables is shown as proportions .
selection and genotyping of tsnps a tagsnp ( tsnp ) approach ( r2 >= 0.80 , minor allele frequency >= 5 %) was used to explore the genetic variation in adipoq , adipor1 , and adipor2 .
tsnps were selected using haploview to represent the common genetic variation of each gene , including an additional 10 kb upstream and downstream , as well as variants previously reported in the literature to be associated with serum adiponectin levels .
sixty - four tsnps in adipoq ( 8 ) , adipor1 and adipor2 ( 15 , 16 ) were selected and genotyped based on this approach ( additional file 1 ) .
genotyping was performed on an illumina beadstation using the goldengate technology .
dna samples from ceph trios ( obtained from the coriell cell repository ) served as internal controls for quality of clustering and reproducibility .
a random ( 10 %) sample was analysed in duplicate , with reproducibility found to be 100 % for the busselton population and 99.9 % for both cudas and fds populations .
individual snp concordance rates were between 99.3 and 100 % .
deviations from hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( hwe ) ( p < 0.05 ) were examined for each tsnp using fisher 's exact test , and minor allele frequencies determined for each cohort .
analysis of association between tsnps and adiponectin levels adiponectin levels were normalised using a natural logarithm transformation prior to analysis .
associations between transformed values and genotypes at each tsnp were examined using a generalised linear model approach implemented in simhap [ 25 ] .
each polymorphism was modelled as a genotypic ( codominant ) genetic effect , accommodating the effects of age , gender , and bmi as significant covariates .
we determined marginal geometric mean values of adiponectin according to genotype at each tsnp using simhap .
we corrected for the multiple testing inherent in this study using the false discovery rate method , and provide q - values [ 26 ] ( additional file 2 ) .
statistical significance was defined at alpha < 0.05 .
we used haploview [ 27 ] to determine the linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) between the selected tsnps and characterise the haplotype block structure .
haplotypes were inferred for individuals with ambiguous phase and haplotype frequencies were estimated using an expectation - maximization algorithm as implemented in simhap .
haplotypes were recorded as independent factors into three classes ( 0 , 1 , or 2 ) , representing the number of copies of each haplotype in an individual 's diplotype .
the effect of each individual haplotype was calculated relative to not having that haplotype .
to investigate associations with serum adiponectin , common haplotypes ( frequency > 5 %) were examined using a codominant model adjusted for age , gender and bmi ( additional file 3 ) .
meta - analysis of the adipoq polymorphisms against total serum adiponectin in the three cohorts was carried out using the rmeta package in r version 2.8.0 .
all three cohorts were pooled after checking for genetic heterogeneity for each tsnp .
random - effects modelling were used for the meta - analysis as we assumed that the cohorts would be heterogeneous .
analysis of association between tsnps and t2d , lnhoma - ir and mets associations between tsnps and t2d , log transformed homa - ir ( lnhoma - ir ) and mets were evaluated in simhap using a codominant model corrected for age , gender and bmi .
for t2d , the fds cohort was compared to control individuals without a history of diabetes from the combined bhs and cudas cohorts .
lnhoma - ir was modelled as a quantitative outcome , while mets was analysed as an ordinal outcome in the bhs and cudas cohorts for the number of mets criteria met .
in addition to investigating the tsnps independently , an allele score was created by summing the number of risk alleles an individual had in those tsnps that were shown to be associated with adiponectin levels in the meta - analysis .
power analysis a power calculation , performed in the quanto software [ 28 ] , indicated that this study has at least 90 % power at an alpha level of p = 0.05 to detect an odds ratio for diabetes ( population risk of 10 %) of 1.45 for a minor allele frequency of 0.05 and an odds ratio of 1.2 for a minor allele frequency of 0.45 , under an additive genetic model .
results sample characteristics a total of 3,322 subjects from the three cohorts were included ( table 1 ) .
as expected , the two general population - based cohorts differed significantly to the diabetic cohort in cardiometabolic risk characteristics , reflecting the different recruitment criteria .
the bhs and cudas populations were similar with regards serum adiponectin concentrations , age and bmi .
compared with the bhs and cudas cohorts , the fds population was older , had lower serum adiponectin concentrations , and had higher bmi and systolic blood pressure .
in all three cohorts , females had higher serum adiponectin concentrations than males .
genotype distribution and linkage disequilibrium of the sixty - four genotyped tsnps , five failed and six were monomorphic , leaving fifty - three that were included in the association analyses ( 21 in adipoq , 13 in adipor1 , and 19 in adipor2 ) .
details of these tsnps including genotype and allele frequencies are reported in additional file 1 .
allele frequencies for all tsnps were similar to those reported in hapmap ( http :// hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov /) .
the genotype distribution of each tsnp was consistent with hwe in all populations , with the following exceptions : two tsnps in bhs ( adipor1 rs75114693 and adipor1 rs6666089 ) and one tsnp in cudas ( adipor1 rs6666089 ) ( all p < 0.05 ) .
analysis of pairwise ld in adipoq showed three ld blocks ( figure 1 ) , which were similar between all three cohorts .
haplotypes were analysed within each block for association with the outcomes of interest .
a strong correlation ( d '> 0.90 and r2 > 0.8 ) was found between tsnps rs6810075 and rs1648707 , rs864265 and rs860291 , rs822387 and rs16861209 , rs822391 and rs822396 , and rs2241766 and rs1063537 within each cohort .
statistical analysis showed that the effects of each of these tsnp pairs on adiponectin levels were identical , and for this reason we chose to report on only one tsnp from each pair : rs1648707 , rs860291 , rs16861209 , rs822396 and rs1063537 .
there was no interaction between gender and any of the genetic variants , so males and females were combined for all subsequent analyses .

the d ' values for each snp pair are shown , with dark red diamonds without a corresponding d ' value representing complete ld ( d '= 1 ) .
association of single tsnps with serum adiponectin age , gender and bmi accounted for 35.5 % of the variation in serum adiponectin in the bhs cohort , 33.2 % in cudas , and 22.0 % in fds .
after adjustment for these covariates and , under a codominant model , eight tsnps in adipoq were significantly associated with serum adiponectin in the bhs cohort : rs12637534 , rs1648707 , rs16861209 , rs17366568 , rs3774261 , rs1063537 , rs6444175 and rs17373414 ( all q < 0.05 ). of these , four were significant in cudas ( rs1648707 , rs16861209 , rs3774261 , and rs6444175 ) , and two in fds ( rs16861209 and rs17366568 ) .
full results ( for these eight snps ) for each cohort , including the data for tsnps in ld , are shown in additional file 2 .
none of the tsnps in adipor1 / r2 were associated with serum adiponectin in any of the cohorts .
after adjustment for age , gender and bmi , tsnps rs12637534 , rs16861209 and rs17366568 accounted for 4.8 % of the variance in serum adiponectin in bhs , rs1648707 and rs16861209 explained 2.9 % of the variance in cudas , and rs16861209 and rs17366568 accounted for 1.7 % in fds .
the minor allele at rs16861209 ( a allele ) was consistently associated with increased serum adiponectin across all three cohorts , specifically 3.7 mg / l in bhs , 2.7 mg / l in cudas and 1.3 mg / l in fds ( additional file 2 ) .
meta - analysis of all adipoq tsnps in our three cohorts is shown in table 2 .
tsnps in ld gave identical results so only data for one tsnp from each pair are presented .

tsnp rs1063537 ( and rs2241766 via strong ld ) showed significant evidence of heterogeneity ( p = 0.001 ) , indicating differences between the cohorts at this marker .
two additional tsnps ( rs10937273 and rs822395 ) were also associated with serum adiponectin in the meta - analysis of the three combined cohorts .
carriage of the minor alleles at rs12637534 , rs1648707 and rs17366568 was associated with lower serum adiponectin levels ( p < 1x10 - 5 ) , while the minor alleles at rs10937273 , rs16861209 , rs822395 , rs3774261 , rs6444175 and rs17373414 was associated with higher serum adiponectin levels ( p <= 0.02 ) .
to determine which of the 9 snps identified in the meta - analysis independently contribute to adiponectin variation , we conducted a conditional regression analysis in all three cohorts ; this analysis showed that 3 of the top 9 snps were independently associated with adiponectin levels in the bhs , including rs12637534 , rs16861209 and rs17366568 .
similar results were found in the other two studies , where both rs16861209 and rs17366568 remained significant in fds , while rs16861209 , rs17366568 and rs1648707 were significant in cudas .
associations of haplotypes with serum adiponectin associations between the most frequent haplotypes and serum adiponectin were analysed after correcting for age , gender and bmi in each cohort ( data not shown ) .
all cohorts were combined and meta - analysis performed on these haplotypes using random effects modelling ( table 3 ) .
the haplotype - based associations were consistent with the results from the single tsnp analyses .

block 3 : rs2241766 - rs3821799 - rs3774261 - rs1063537 - rs6444175 .
in block 1 , five common haplotypes were observed that significantly affected serum adiponectin .
haplotypes carrying the major allele at rs12637534 and rs1648707 ( a - a ) were found to increase serum adiponectin ( all p <= 9.20x10 - 3 ) , with the exception of the gaat haplotype where one copy was associated with decreased serum adiponectin concentrations ( p = 0.03 ) .
the opposite was true for carriage of the minor allele at each of these tsnps , with one copy of ggcg associated with a significantly decreased serum adiponectin ( p = 8.22x10 - 7 ) .
one haplotype , gacg , carrying the major allele at rs12637534 ( a ) and minor allele at rs1648707 ( c ) , was also associated with a decreased serum adiponectin , suggesting that the effect of rs1648707 may be stronger than rs12637534 .
this seems likely given the lower minor allele frequency of rs12637534 compared to rs1648707 ( 8 % vs 34 %) .
in block 2 , the ccatcag haplotype ( frequency 8 %) carrying the minor alleles at rs16861209 ( a ) and rs822395 ( c ) ( both associated with a higher serum adiponectin ) was found to be significantly associated with serum adiponectin ( p = 5.11x10 - 15 ) .
this haplotype was found to be significant in each cohort and explained 2.3 % of the variation in levels in bhs , 2.0 % in cudas and 0.7 % in fds .
conversely , three haplotypes carrying the major allele at rs16861209 ( associated with a lower serum adiponectin ) were found to be significantly associated with a decreased serum adiponectin ( all p <= 3.11x10 - 2 ) .
two haplotypes in block 3 were significantly associated with serum adiponectin in the meta - analysis , and in each individual cohort .
the ttaca haplotype ( frequency ~ 25 %) was associated with increased levels and ttgcg ( frequency ~ 6 %) with decreased levels ( p <= 4x10 - 4 and p <= 2.87x10 - 12 , respectively ) .
the ttaca haplotype carries the minor allele ( a allele ) at both rs3774261 and rs6444175 that was shown in the single tsnp analyses to be associated with increased serum adiponectin , while ttgcg carries the major allele at each of these tsnps and has the opposite effect on levels , again showing consistency between single tsnp and haplotype analysis .
this haplotype accounted for 2.3 % of the variation in levels in bhs , 0.7 % in cudas and 0.6 % in fds .
the more common ttaca haplotype only accounted for between 0.3 and 0.7 % of the variation in levels across all three cohorts .
in all haplotype blocks , the single snps tagging the block accounted for the same , or slightly more of the variation in adiponectin levels than the haplotype block itself ( difference of between 0 - 0.8 % between the tsnps and the haplotypes ) .
association of tsnps with t2d , lnhoma - ir and mets no significant associations were detected between genetic variants in adipoq , or adipor1 / r2 , and lnhoma - ir or mets in any cohort after correction for age , gender and bmi .
we also found no association between the adipoq and adipor1 / r2 genetic variants and t2d in the case : control analysis ( results not shown ) .
there was a significant association between the allele score of the top nine snps and t2d in the case - control study without adjusting for adiponectin levels ( or = 0.94 , 95 % ci =( 0.91,0.98 ) , p = 0.0015 ) and this association strengthened after adjusting for adiponectin levels ( or = 0.92 , 95 % ci =( 0.89 , 0.96 ) , p = 2.43x10 - 5 ) .
the allele score of the 3 independent snps ; rs12637534 , rs16861209 , rs17366568 , were significantly associated with t2d only after adjusting for adiponectin levels ( or = 0.86 , 95 % ci =( 0.75 , 0.99 ) , p = 0.0134 ) .
discussion the present study reports associations between total serum adiponectin concentrations and a range of genetic variations and haplotypes in the adiponectin gene ( adipoq ) and genes for adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 ( adipor1 / r2 ) in three independent european - australian population - based cohorts .
several genetic variants in adipoq , but not adipor1 / r2 , were associated with serum adiponectin .
these associations were consistent across the three cohorts and showed similar results for tsnp and haplotype - based analysis .
after adjusting for age , gender , and bmi , variants in the adipoq gene accounted for only 3.9 % of the variation in serum adiponectin in the combined general population cohorts and 1.7 % in the diabetic sample .
there was also no association between tsnps or haplotypes of adipoq , and adipor1 / r2 with t2d , insulin resistance assessed by lnhoma - ir , or mets .
this relatively large study confirms that adipoq tsnps are significantly associated with serum adiponectin .
we found the minor alleles at rs12637534 , rs1648707 / rs6810075 and rs17366568 to be associated with lower serum adiponectin concentration ( p < 1x10 - 5 ) , while the minor alleles at rs10937273 , rs16861209 / rs822387 , rs822395 , rs3774261 , rs6444175 and rs17373414 were associated with higher levels ( p <= 0.02 ) .
these associations and their direction are consistent with the hypothesis that circulating adiponectin levels are in part determined by genetic influences [ 3 - 7,9,10,29 - 31 ] .
we failed to replicate previous findings in the literature for adipoq snps rs2241766 , rs1063537 and rs3821799 that have been reported in two large gwas [ 3,31 ] , but not supported by other studies [ 4,8 ] .
in addition , there were three tsnps ( rs266729 , rs62625753 and rs17366743 ) reported as associated with serum adiponectin that did not show a significant association with adiponectin levels in the present study .
ld data available from heid et al .
[ 3 ] show that rs266729 is correlated ( r2 > 0.60 , d '> 0.80 ) with tsnps which were significant in our study ( rs6810075 , rs182052 and rs1648707 ) .
the lack of replication of the association between adiponectin levels and snps previously identified in gwas is intriguing .
as several rare population - specific coding variants have been reported to be strongly associated with adiponectin level [ 6,32,33 ] one possible explanation for the observed discrepancies may be due to synthetic associations i.e. the fact that population - specific rare variants are in partial linkage disequilibrium with common variants [ 34 ] .
in the present study , the significantly associated tsnps were located across all regions of the gene , including the promoter , exonic , intronic and 3 ' - untranslated regions .
interestingly , all of the tsnps downstream of exon 2 were associated with an increased serum adiponectin .
we observed no association between adipor1 / r2 variants and serum adiponectin which is consistent with most other studies [ 14,35 - 37 ] .
recent genome - wide studies have identified variants in a third adiponectin receptor , t - cadherin , that affect circulating adiponectin [ 2,4,38,39 ] .
t - cadherin , encoded by cdh13 , is a receptor for hexameric and high - molecular - weight adiponectin , but not for the trimeric or globular species as measured in the present study .
nevertheless , variants in cdh13 warrant further investigation .
despite the fact that adipoq variants are associated with a modest amount of variance in total serum adiponectin (< 5 %) , interventions aimed at the encoded protein may affect secreted adiponectin to a much greater extent .
indeed , the thiazolidinediones have been shown to increase circulating adiponectin 2 - 2.5 fold in patients with diabetes , although the exact mechanism of action remains unknown .
other population studies have reported similar quantitatively small effects of adipoq snps , and show that there are a large number of snps contributing independently to the variation [ 3,7,40 ] .
a recent large multiethnic gwas identified ten new loci , in addition to adipoq and cdh13 , that affect circulating adiponectin , but the combined multi - snp genotypic risk score only explained 5 % of the variance in serum adiponectin [ 31 ] .
the high heritability estimates for adiponectin may be explained by as - yet undiscovered rare variants with strong effects , additional unknown common loci with small effects , epigenetic mechanisms , or by copy number variations ( cnvs ) .
adipoq contains a high number of cnvs and the effect of these on circulating adiponectin is unknown .
complete sequencing of the adipoq locus has been performed in a large population where seven snps were shown to influence adiponectin levels but the authors found no evidence of an association between these snps and t2d in a diabetic case control study [ 33 ] .
recently , studies have identified rare population - specific mutations that account for 17 % of the variance in serum adiponectin [ 32,41 ] .
further analysis of gene - gene and gene - environment interactions may explain the remaining heritability .
despite putative effects of the adiponectin receptors on tissue adiponectin activity , we found no evidence that tsnps in adipoq , or adipor1 / r2 were associated with either insulin resistance , or mets .
this supports the findings of two other studies [ 5,33 ] .
however , we did find a significant association between the allele score of the top nine snps and t2d in the case - control study without adjusting for adiponectin levels .
multi - snp genotypic risk score for adiponectin - decreasing alleles has been associated with bmi , whr , fasting insulin , homa - ir , 2 - hour post ogtt glucose , t2d , triglycerides and hdl - cholesterol [ 31 ] .
in the current study a post - hoc analysis revealed that adjusting for adiponectin levels strengthened the association with 3 independent snps , rs12637534 , rs16861209 , rs17366568 and t2d .
the strengthening of this association provides strong evidence that the genetic determinants of adiponectin levels are shared with t2d using a mendelian randomisation approach [ 13 ] .
there have been numerous studies investigating the association of adiponectin gene and related polymorphisms with t2d .
two recent large meta - analyses showed that the g vs c allele of rs266729 might be a risk factor for t2d [ 42,43 ] , while the rs17300539 a allele was shown to be a risk factor only in european caucasians [ 43 ] .
the latter snp is in complete ld with rs16861209 that we have identified in our caucasian populations .
the limitations of this study include the use of a single baseline serum adiponectin measurement which may not fully characterise long - term adiponectin exposure and effects .
nevertheless , other prospective studies that analysed repeated serum adiponectin measurements , on average one year apart , reported high intra - class correlations above 0.71 [ 35,44 ] , indicating high reproducibility of serum adiponectin levels .
in the present study , total serum adiponectin levels were measured , whereas recent evidence suggests that the high molecular - weight form of adiponectin , rather than the low molecular - weight forms , may be the bioactive protein [ 45 ] .
conclusions in summary , we have comprehensively analysed the genetic variants and haplotypes of adipoq and its two receptor genes using a tagsnp approach in two general populations and a diabetic cohort , in total comprising 3,322 well phenotyped subjects .
we found that age , gender and bmi accounted for approximately one - third of the variation in serum adiponectin in the general population cohorts and just over one - fifth in a diabetic population .
variants in the adipoq gene accounted for < 5 % of the variation in serum adiponectin and genetic variants in adipoq and its receptors does not appear to contribute to the risk of insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome .
however , a multi - snp genotypic risk score for adipoq did associate with t2d independent of adiponectin levels .
the factors that underlie the majority of the variation in serum adiponectin remain unknown , but given the potential beneficial effects of this adipokine , merit further study .

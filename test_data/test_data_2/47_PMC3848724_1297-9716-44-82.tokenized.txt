similar to mammals , several viral - sensing pattern recognition receptors ( prr ) have been identified in birds including toll - like receptors ( tlr ) and retinoic acid - inducible gene i ( rig - i ) - like receptors ( rlr ) .
avian tlr are slightly different from their mammalian counterparts , including the pseudogene tlr8 , the absence of tlr9 , and the presence of tlr1la , tlr1lb , tlr15 , and tlr21 .
avian tlr3 and tlr7 are involved in rna virus recognition , especially highly pathogenic avian influenza virus ( hpaiv ) , while tlr15 and tlr21 are potential sensors that recognize both rna viruses and bacteria .
however , the agonist of tlr15 is still unknown .
interestingly , chickens , unlike ducks , geese and finches , lack rig - i , however they do express melanoma differentiation - associated gene 5 ( mda5 ) which functionally compensates for the absence of rig - i. duck rig - i is the cytosolic recognition element for hpaiv recognition , while chicken cells sense hpaiv through mda5 .
however , the contributions of mda5 and rig - i to ifn - beta induction upon hpaiv infection is different , and this may contribute to the chicken 's susceptibility to highly pathogenic influenza .
it is noteworthy that the interactions between avian dna viruses and prr have not yet been reported .
furthermore , the role for avian nod - like receptors ( nlr ) in viral immunity is largely unknown .
in this review , recent advances in the field of viral recognition by different types of prr in birds are summarized .
in particular , the tissue and cellular distribution of avian prr , the recognition and activation of prr by viruses , and the subsequent expression of innate antiviral genes such as type i ifn and proinflammatory cytokines are discussed .

introduction vertebrates sense viral pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( pamp ) through different types of pattern recognition receptors ( prr ) .
the activation of prr by pamp triggers the activation of transcription factors and the expression of innate antiviral genes such as interferon , which is central to host antiviral defences .
mammalian and avian lineages diverged approximately 300 million years ago , and therefore their dna share many evolutionarily conserved regions including many prr , however the avian genome contains some distinct genes ( table 1 ) [ 1 ] .
studies indicate that avian immune systems differ from their mammalian counterparts [ 2 ] .
birds lack functional eosinophils , although avian heterophils functionally replace mammalian neutrophils .
moreover , birds lack lymph nodes , but have some avian - specific primary lymphoid organs such as the bursa of fabricius , which is the site of hematopoiesis and necessary for b cell development .
also , harderian glands in birds play an important role in adaptive immune responses .
birds and mammals use partly similar and partly distinct molecules for the same immunological antiviral mechanisms including tlr [ 3,4 ] , defensins [ 5 ] , cytokines [ 6 ] , chemokines [ 6 ] , antibodies and others [ 7 ] .

the interaction between the host innate immune mechanism and invading viruses is complicated .
the earliest host response to a microbial invader is the nonspecific recognition of viral components by prr [ 8 ] .
many innate immune cells including dendritic cells , macrophages , lymphocytes and non - immune cells , such as endothelial cells , mucosal epithelial cells and fibroblasts contain prr [ 8 ] .
some prr are distributed in the cytosol , including some types of toll - like receptors ( tlr ) , retinoic acid - inducible gene i ( rig - i ) - like receptors ( rlr ) , and nucleotide - binding oligomerization domain ( nod ) - like receptors ( nlr ) , which play important roles in the cytosolic recognition of viral double - strand rna ( dsrna ) , single - strand rna ( ssrna ) and dna ( table 1 ) .
tlr are well - known membrane - bound prr which recognize pathogen - associated lipids , proteins , and nucleic acids .
tlr and rlr are important for the production of type i interferons ( ifn ) and various cytokines , whereas nlr play a major role in the regulation of interleukin - 1beta ( il - 1beta ) [ 9 ] .
2. toll - like receptors tlr are type i transmembrane proteins consisting of an extracellular n - terminal domain containing leucine - rich repeats ( lrr ) that mediate the detection of pamp , transmembrane domains , and intracellular toll - interleukin 1 ( il - 1 ) receptor ( tir ) domains that are involved in downstream signal transduction [ 10 ] .
the recognition of pamp by tlr triggers the activation of transcription factors and the expression of innate antiviral genes such as type i ifn and proinflammatory cytokines [ 10 ] .
tlr are among the best - characterized prr and mediate the recognition of invading pathogens both outside the cell and in intracellular endosomes and lysosomes .
different tlr recognize the different molecular patterns of microorganisms and self - components [ 11 ] .
currently , 10 human tlr ( hutlr ) , 13 murine tlr , and 10 chicken ( gallus gallus ) tlr ( chtlr ) ( table 1 ) have been characterized including chtlr1la and chtlr1lb [ 12 ] , chtlr2a and chtlr2b [ 13 ] , chtlr3 [ 14 ] , chtlr4 [ 15 ] , chtlr5 [ 16 ] , chtlr7 [ 17 ] , chtlr15 [ 18 ] , and chtlr21 [ 19 ] .
however , many waterfowl tlr have yet to be identified .
so far , 4 duck ( anas platyrhynchos ) tlr ( dutlr ) including dutlr2 [ 20 ] , dutlr3 [ 21 ] , dutlr4 [ 22 ] , dutlr7 [ 23 ] , and 4 goose ( anser anser ) tlr ( gotlr ) including gotlr4 [ 24 ] , gotlr5 [ 25 ] , gotlr7 [ 26 ] , and gotlr15 [ genbank accession no. jq014619.1 ] have been reported .
avian tlr are slightly different from other vertebrates in a number of ways , including the presence of the pseudogene tlr8 , the absence of tlr9 , and the presence of chtlr1la , chtlr1lb , chtlr15 , and chtlr21 [ 12 ] .
2.1 avian tlr 1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 five avian tlr ( chtlr2 , 4 , 5 and 7 ) are orthologous to other mammalian genes including duplicated genes chtlr2a and chtlr2b [ 12 ] , while chtlr1la and chtlr1lb are unique to birds .
avian tlr5 genes are polymorphic , an attribute that may be associated with the resistance or susceptibility of birds to infectious diseases [ 27 ] .
it is not believed that tlr1 and tlr5 are involved in the host antiviral immune response .
in mammals , tlr2 and tlr4 are present on the plasma membrane of cells and recognize viral components including envelope proteins and surface hemagglutinin , such as hemagglutinin protein of the varicella virus , herpes simplex virus - 1 , human cytomegalovirus , and mouse mammary tumor virus [ 28 ] .
however , the mechanism of recognition of viral pathogens by avian tlr2 or tlr4 remains to be elucidated .
2.2 avian tlr 15 tlr15 is considered as an avian - specific tlr [ 12,29 ] .
to date , tlr15 has been identified in the chicken [ 18 ] , turkey [ 30 ] , japanese quail [ genbank accession no. hm773176.1 ] , goose [ genbank accession no .
jq014619.1 ] and zebra finch ( taeniopygia guttata ) genomes .
chtlr15 is expressed in the spleen , bursa , and bone marrow of healthy chickens [ 18 ] , while turkey tlr15 is constitutively expressed in various tissues including the heart , liver , intestine , bursa , bone marrow , muscle and spleen [ 30 ] .
the expression of chtlr15 is upregulated by heat - killed s. enterica serovar typhimurium in chicken embryonic fibroblasts ( cef ) , indicating that chtlr15 may play a role in the avian immune response against bacterial infections [ 18 ] .
it was subsequently demonstrated that chicken il - 1beta , not ifn - alpha , can be significantly upregulated by b - and c - type oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated cpg motifs ( cpg - odns ) through chicken tlr15 via myeloid differentiation primary response gene ( 88 ) ( myd88 ) - dependent pathway in a chicken macrophage ( hd11 ) cell line [ 31 ] .
moreover , there may be cross talk between tlr2 and tlr15 leading to a reduction in il - 1beta levels [ 31 ] .
interestingly , avian tlr15 is also involved in the host antiviral immune response .
the expression of chtlr15 in the spleens of chickens infected with marek 's disease virus ( mdv ) is significantly downregulated at 28 days post infection ( dpi ) , while chtlr3 and chtlr15 were upregulated in the bursa at 7 and 4 dpi , respectively [ 32 ] .
another study showed that the expression of chtlr15 in the spleen is upregulated during the cytolytic phase of mdv infection ( 5 dpi ) [ 33 ] .
these studies provide evidence for the critical role of chtlr15 in controlling mdv infection in the spleen and bursa during the early phases of infection .
collectively , like mammalian tlr4 or tlr9 , avian tlr15 is a potential sensor for the recognition of invading viruses and bacteria .
however , the agonist of tlr15 is still unknown , and the subcellular location of avian tlr15 remains to be characterized .
2.3 avian nucleic acid - sensing tlr among mammalian tlr , tlr3 and tlr7 / 8 / 9 are involved in viral nucleic acid recognition , playing major roles in coordinating antiviral immune responses ( figure 1 ) [ 28 ] .
figure 1 model of innate immune recognition of virus in birds .
the plasma membrane receptor of tlr15 recognizes cpg - odn derived from viruses and bacteria .
viral recognition relies on intracellular vesicles of prr , whose ligands are dsrna derived from viruses or virus - infected cells ( tlr3 ) , ssrna derived from rna viruses ( tlr7 ) , cpg - odn ( tlr21 ) , short 5'ppp dsrna ( rig - i ) , and long dsrna ( mda5 ) .
tlr3 , tlr7 and tlr21 localize mainly in the er in the steady state and traffic to the endosome , where they engage with their ligands .
the recognition triggers the downstream signal transduction to activate nf - kappab or irf3 / 7 , finally induces interferon and inflammatory cytokine production .
2.3.1 avian tlr3 tlr3 plays an important role in defending against viral invasion by upregulating the expression of antiviral type i ifn , which has been demonstrated in tlr3 - deficient mice [ 34 ] .
tlr3 recognizes dsrna formed during viral genome replication or transcription , and is localized exclusively in intracellular vesicles such as the endosome and endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) where viruses undergo uncoating during infection ( figure 1 ) [ 10 ] .
2.3.1.1 chicken tlr3 chtlr3 has approximately 48 % amino acid identity with hutlr3 [ 35 ] , and displays a broad tissue tropism , yet is only moderately expressed in bone marrow , skin , and muscle tissues , similar to the expression profile of mammalian tlr3 [ 36 ] .
one study indicated that chtlr2 , 3 , 4 and 21 are present in chicken cd4 + t cells , and chtlr2 and chtlr3 transcripts were discovered in abundance [ 36 ] .
therefore , it has been suggested that avian cd4 + t cells may have a potential role in defending against viral pathogens .
moreover , chtlr3 is readily detected in cef , chicken kidney cells ( ckc ) , chicken b cell - like cell line ( dt40 ) and the hd11 cell line [ 35 ] .
as it does in mammals , chtlr3 recognizes dsrna and the agonist poly ( i : c ) , then rapidly induces type i ifn expression ( table 2 ) [ 37,38 ] .
the expression of type i ifn and tlr3 in chicken leucocytes is increased after stimulation with poly ( i : c ) , but not poly ( c ) [ 37 ] .
moreover , both ifn - alpha and ifn - beta can upregulate tlr3 expression in a dose - dependent manner both in leucocytes and df - 1 ( chicken fibroblast cell line ) , but not in hd11 cultures [ 37 ] .
furthermore , poly ( i : c ) - induced ifn - beta expression is somewhat dependent on chtlr3 , which was demonstrated using sirna gene silencing of chtlr3 [ 37 ] .
this suggests the presence of alternative pathways to produce ifn - beta in chickens , which has also been reported in mammals [ 34,39 ] .
these studies indicate that chtlr3 is constitutively expressed in all chicken tissues and several kinds of chicken cell lines , and may contribute to the induction of the innate immune response against viruses both in vivo and in vitro .

the tlr3 ligand poly ( i : c ) administered as an adjuvant concomitantly with herpesvirus of turkeys ( hvt ) vaccine in chickens could enhance the protective efficacy against marek 's disease tumors [ 40 ] .
a recent study has shown that poly ( i : c ) has the ability to enhance host immunity against avian influenza viruses ( aiv ) h4n6 including a significant decrease in virus shedding , upregulation of ifn - alpha and il - 1beta mrna expression in the spleen , and type i ifn ( ifn - alpha and ifn - beta ) , il - 8 , and il - 18 expression in the lungs [ 41 ] .
these results suggest that tlr3 ligands have the ability to enhance host immunity and could be potential candidates for adjuvants for avian viral vaccines .
stimulation of chicken monocytes with a cpg - odn agonist and poly ( i : c ) either alone or together can produce a stronger t helper cells ( th ) 1 - biased immune response , including upregulation of type i ifn ( ifn - alpha and ifn - beta ) , th1 cytokines ( ifn - gamma and il - 12 ) , and th2 cytokines ( il - 4 and il - 10 ) [ 42 ] .
it has been suggested that chicken tlr3 and tlr21 agonists may interact to regulate ifn and th1 / 2 cytokine expression .
the mrna expression levels of tlr3 are enhanced in marek 's disease - infected lungs [ 43 ] .
however , different strains of infectious bursal disease virus ( ibdv ) can induce opposite changes of chtlr3 expression levels in the bursa [ 44 ] .
highly pathogenic avian influenza virus ( hpaiv ) h5n1 infection can upregulate chtlr3 and ifn - beta expression in the lungs and brain of infected chickens [ 37 ] , while chtlr3 in the lungs , gut , and bursa is rapidly upregulated by low pathogenic avian influenza virus ( lpaiv ) h7n1 at the early stages of infection [ 45 ] .
an in vitro study confirmed that ifn - alpha and ifn - beta are greatly upregulated ( up to 102 fold ) by poly ( i : c ) in chicken lung epithelial cells ( clec213 ) at 24 h post stimulation , and ifn - alpha , not ifn - beta , is highly expressed ( up to 107 fold ) in clec213 after infection with lpaiv h6n2 [ 46 ] .
however , the recognition mechanism between aiv and chtlr3 remains to be identified .
moreover , the subsequent activation and cell signal transduction through avian tlr3 remains to be elucidated .
2.3.1.2 other avian tlr3 the muscovy duck ( cairina moschata ) tlr3 ( mdtlr3 ) ( table 2 ) shares 87.3 % amino acid identity with chtlr3 , and 62.0 % and 60.2 % identity with hutlr3 and mouse tlr3 , respectively [ 21 ] .
it should be noted that the sequence differences between the muscovy duck and chicken are primarily located in the tir domain of tlr3 , which is among the most conserved tlr sequences .
the expression of mdtlr3 is significantly upregulated in the brain reaching a maximum at 48 h post infection ( pi ) with hpaiv h5n1 , which is similar to chicken tlr3 [ 21 ] .
in contrast , downregulation of mdtlr3 was observed in the spleen and lung after hpaiv h5n1 infection , while chtlr3 is significantly upregulated in both tissues during infection [ 21 ] .
another study indicated that the expression of pigeon ( columbidae ) tlr3 [ genbank accession no .
ab618533 ] is upregulated in the brains of hpaiv h5n1 infected pigeons , whereas tlr3 expression is inversely correlated with viral replication in the lungs [ 47 ] .
in mammals , low expression of tlr3 leads to an unexpected survival advantage , efficient viral replication and decreased lung lesions were confirmed in tlr3 - deficient mice after influenza infection [ 48 ] .
interestingly , pigeons show more resistance than chickens to hpaiv h5n1 [ 49 ] .
collectively , these data suggest that the decrease in tlr3 in the lungs of some birds ( such as muscovy ducks and pigeons ) during influenza infection is an important protective host mechanism to prolong survival against influenza , which may explain the different susceptibilities to hpaiv between chickens and waterfowl .
however , the detailed molecular mechanism of avian tlr3 action requires further investigation .
2.3.2 avian tlr7 tlr7 , 8 , and 9 form an evolutionary cluster and are present in both mammals and teleosteans , and are all localized exclusively in intracellular vesicles such as endosomes and the er ( figure 1 ) [ 10 ] .
tlr7 / 8 sense viral - derived ssrna , while tlr9 senses the unmethylated cytosine phosphate guanine ( cpg ) motifs of viral dna .
interestingly , only tlr7 has been identified in birds ( table 1 and 2 ) [ 17 ] .
tlr8 is a pseudogene in chickens , which is disrupted by several introns [ 4,17 ] , while it has been proposed that tlr9 has been deleted from avian genomes over evolutionary time [ 4 ] .
tlr7 orthologs have been found in chicken and zebra finch genomes , but zebra finch tlr7 is duplicated [ 4 ] .
2.3.2.1 chicken tlr7 as in mice and humans , chtlr7 is alternatively spliced and expressed as two protein isoforms [ 17 ] , sharing approximately 63 % amino acid identity with hutlr7 [ 17 ] .
in humans , tlr7 is specifically expressed by plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pdc ) .
chtlr7 demonstrates a restricted expression pattern , mostly in immune - related tissues [ 35 ] , as it is highly expressed in the hd11 and dt40 cell lines , but poorly expressed in cef cells [ 35 ] .
another study indicated that chicken erythrocytes constitutively express chtlr2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 21 , but not chtlr7 [ 50 ] .
in mammals , cl264 ( 9 - benzyl - 8 hydroxyadenine ) , imidazoquinoline , and loxoribine ( 7 - allyl - 7,8 - dihydro - 8 - oxo - guanosine ) can stimulate tlr7 , while resiquimod ( r - 848 ) is a tlr7 / 8 agonist that can induce the activation of nf - kappab and mapk , and the secretion cytokines such as ifn - alpha , il - 6 and il - 12 via the tlr7 / myd88 - dependent signaling pathway [ 51 ] .
recently , a study reported that loxoribine induces antiviral gene expression such as type i ifn ( ifn - alpha and ifn - beta ) and ifn - gamma in primary chicken splenocytes , and can inhibit influenza a replication in vitro and in ovo in a dose - dependent manner [ 52 ] .
however , r848 and poly ( u ) cannot stimulate chicken splenocytes to upregulate the expression of type i ifn , but it can cause increased expression of il - 1beta , il - 6 and il - 8 [ 17 ] .
moreover , il - 1beta mrna levels in hd11 cells were significantly increased after r848 or loxoribine stimulation for 6 h [ 17 ] .
in contrast , another study indicated that il - 1beta , il - 6 and il - 8 mrna levels were significantly decreased in heterophils after stimulation with loxoribine for 1 h irrespective of concentration ( 20 to 200 mug / ml ) [ 53 ] .
subsequently , it was demonstrated that chicken heterophils from different commercial poultry suppliers respond differently to tlr7 agonists ( loxoribine ) in relation to ifn - alpha , proinflammatory cytokines ( il - 1beta and il - 6 ) and chemokine expression ( cxcli2 , cxcli1 and ccli4 ) [ 54 ] .
intriguing differences in the functional responses to tlr7 agonists have been observed either in different types of chicken cells or in heterophils from different parent lines .
however , the underlying causes of these different responses are not yet understood .
the expression of chtlr7 is upregulated in the lungs post mdv infection [ 43 ] .
similar to chtlr3 , chtlr7 expression varies in response to different strains of ibdv infected chickens [ 44 ] .
these data indicate that chtlr7 is involved in the interaction between the host and rna viruses .
2.3.2.2 duck tlr7 dutlr7 ( white pekin duck ) shares approximately 85 % amino acid identity with chtlr7 , differing primarily in the ligand - binding lrr domains [ 23 ] .
dutlr7 transcripts are most abundantly expressed in lymphoid tissues such as the spleen and bursa , as well as the lung [ 23 ] .
it is very interesting to note that the high expression of dutlr7 in respiratory and lymphoid tissues is distinct from that of chickens , yet a similar expression pattern is observed in humans [ 23,55 ] .
moreover , proinflammatory cytokines ( il - 1beta and il - 6 ) and ifn - alpha are upregulated in duck splenocytes after stimulation with tlr7 agonists ( loxoribine and imiquimod ) , which appear to be critical mediators of antiviral defenses ( table 2 ) [ 23 ] .
tissue tropism and immune function of dutlr7 is different from that of chtlr7 , which may partly explain the different susceptibility between chickens and ducks to the same pathogen .
during hpaiv h5n1 infection , type i ifn ( ifn - alpha and ifn - beta ) , type ii interferon ( ifn - gamma ) and tlr7 were slightly upregulated in def , whereas expression was only gradually induced in cef [ 56 ] .
another study demonstrated that both duck and chicken tlr7 is only transiently expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) at the early stages of lpaiv h11n9 infection , followed by a decline as the infection progresses [ 57 ] .
these results demonstrate that there are some differences in the changes in tlr7 expression in ducks and chickens .
regulation of chtlr7 expression during hpaiv or lpaiv infection was also different .
it has been suggested that tlr7 is an important element in the avian immune response against influenza virus and that tlr7 ligands show considerable potential as antivirals in the chicken .
2.3.2.3 goose tlr7 gotlr7 ( qingyuan goose ) shares only 89 % and 68 % sequence identity with chtlr7 and hutlr7 [ 26 ] .
we have shown that gotlr7 ( sichuan white goose ) shares 93 % and 83 % amino acid identity with dutlr7 [ genbank accession no. abk51522.1 ] and chtlr7 [ genbank accession no. cag15146.1 ] , respectively ( data not shown ) .
as in ducks , gotlr7 is predominantly expressed in lymphoid tissues ( such as the bursa ) , while expression is observed in the intestines and lungs as well ( data not shown ) .
the expression of gotlr7 , myd88 and other antiviral molecules were significantly upregulated in the lungs during the early phase of hpaiv h5n1 infection [ 26 ] .
hpaiv h5n1 can activate gotlr7 via the myd88 - dependent pathway , and gotlr7 is involved in the antiviral innate immune response against virus .
however , the interaction between hpaiv and gotlr7 requires further study .
the immunological characteristics of gotlr7 remain to be elucidated as well .
2.3.3 mammalian tlr9 and avian tlr21 cpg - odn are common in bacteria and viruses but are rare in mammalian cells , and are therefore a major ligand of mammalian tlr9 , as tlr9 - deficient mice fail to respond to cpg - odn [ 58 ] .
in mammals , high tlr9 expression in pdc serves as a sensor for dna virus infection ( such as hsv1 and hsv2 ) by exerting an effective antiviral immune response by producing type i ifn [ 59,60 ] .
it is thought that the cpg - rich genomes of some dna viruses are recognized by tlr9 .
interestingly , the chicken genome does not contain tlr9 , however the administration of cpg - odn in ovo can enhance the expression of ifn - gamma , il - 1beta , il - 6 , and il - 8 , as well as limit the propagation of infectious bronchitis virus ( ibv ) in embryonic tissues [ 61 ] .
investigation of the immunoadjuvant effects of cpg - odn on the newcastle disease ( nd ) vaccine indicated that cpg - odn can induce pbmc proliferation and higher nd vaccine - specific antibody titers [ 62 ] .
another study indicated that cpg - odn could enhance the humoral immune response ( hi titres and serum igg titres ) and th1 immunity ( ifn - gamma ) when administered with the aiv vaccine as the adjuvant [ 63 ] .
these results suggest that cpg - odn administered as an adjuvant with poultry vaccines can greatly improve their effectiveness .
these findings lead to a search for other receptors or tlr in birds ( such as tlr7 or the novel tlr15 or tlr21 ) that can recognize mammalian tlr9 ligands ( such as cpg - odns ) to trigger downstream cell signaling .
it was later confirmed that chtlr21 , not chtlr7 or chtlr15 , has an immune function similar to mammalian tlr9 and an innate cpg dna receptor that can recognize bacterial genomic dna [ 19,64 ] .
tlr21 is absent in humans , but has been identified in chickens and turkeys , and has homologs in amphibians ( xenopustropicalis ( 61 % identity )) and fish ( takifugu rubripes ( 57 % identity )) , and is similar to murine tlr13 ( 47 %) [ 65 ] .
like hutlr9 , chtlr21 is located in the same intracellular compartment ( i.e. the er ) in transfected cells as confirmed by confocal microscopy [ 19,64 ] .
it has also been demonstrated that chicken intestinal t - cell subsets ( cd4 + and cd8 + t cells ) express chtlr21 [ 66 ] .
the expression of chtlr21 was the highest in the bursa of fabricius and the spleen , and was also present in non - lymphoid tissues ( skin , small intestine , lung , kidneys , brain and liver ) of adult chickens [ 19 ] , while levels of turkey tlr21 were significantly higher in the liver than other tissues such as muscle , intestine , bursa and spleen [ 30 ] .
due to selection pressures during vertebrate evolutionary history , different classes of tlr were formed that recognize the same type of ligands and show analogous localization ( such as chicken tlr21 and mammalian tlr9 ) .
functionally , avian tlr21 and mammalian tlr9 are both involved in cpg - odn sensing and the immune response to viral infections .
3. rig - i - like receptors for cytosolic sensing the rlr family consists of three members : rig - i , melanoma differentiation - associated gene 5 ( mda5 ) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 ( lgp2 ) [ 67 ] .
rig - i and mda5 contain two n - terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains ( card ) , a dex ( d / h ) box rna helicase domain , a c - terminal rna - binding domain and a repressor domain , whereas lgp2 lacks a card [ 68 ] .
mda5 and lgp2 are well conserved among vertebrates , while rig - i emerged earlier than mda5 and lgp2 [ 69 ] .
3.1 rig - i rig - i belongs to the ifn - stimulated gene ( isg ) family and is expressed ubiquitously in the cytoplasm ( figure 1 ) [ 67 ] .
rig - i detects viral nucleic acids in the cytosol and activates a downstream signaling cascade , initiating antiviral responses by producing type i and type iii ifn ( figure 1 ) [ 67 ] .
it is specific to rna viruses and does not bind viral dsdna except for the epstein - barr virus [ 70 ] .
rig - i recognizes dsrna structures and short , blunt - ended 5 ' - triphosphate ( 5'ppp ) dsrna generated by viral rna polymerases , but viral rna that contain a 5 ' - monophosphate are not recognized by rig - i [ 68,71 ] .
several viruses remove their own 5'ppp groups to avoid detection by rig - i [ 68 ] .
all eukaryotic cellular mrna are blocked at their 5 ' - ends with a cap structure to prevent sensing by rig - i. atra , lps , type i ifn ( ifn - alpha and ifn - beta ) and type ii ifn ( ifn - gamma ) can upregulate rig - i expression in a variety of human cell types [ 72 ] .
rig - i expression is subject to positive feedback regulation by ifn , which means that rig - i is an ifn - inducible viral sensor and is critical for amplifying antiviral responses [ 73,74 ] .
the stickleback genome appears to lack rig - i , and incomplete sequence data means that the rig - i gene could not be identified in fugu , medaka and chicken [ 69,75 ] .
however , rig - i has been identified in both ducks and geese [ 75,76 ] .
the structure of avian rig - i is consistent with its mammalian counterpart [ 69 ] .
3.1.1 duck rig - i duck ( anas platyrhynchos ) , zebra finch , and goose rig - i are 933 [ 75 ] , 927 , and 934 amino acids in length , respectively [ 76 ] .
duck rig - i shares 78 % and 53 % amino acid identity with zebra finch rig - i and human rig - i , respectively [ 75 ] .
a study demonstrated that rig - i expression is dramatically upregulated in the lungs of hpaiv h5n1 - infected ducks , but not in lpaiv h5n2 - infected ducks [ 75 ] .
duck rig - i - transfected df - 1 cells can recognize the rig - i ligand and induce the expression of antiviral genes including chicken ifn - beta , mx1 , pkr , ifit5 , and oasl , while hpaiv titers are significantly reduced [ 75,77 ] .
duck and wild waterfowl are the natural reservoirs of influenza viruses , that usually cause asymptomatic infections in ducks , while causing lethal infections in chickens .
despite the lack of rig - i , chicken cells can produce ifn - alpha by another pathway .
however , the expression of ifn - beta upon influenza infection is mainly dependent on rig - i [ 78 ] , and the protective role of ifn - beta during influenza infection cannot be compensated for by ifn - alpha [ 79 ] .
this may contribute to the higher resistance of ducks than chickens to hpaiv infections .
3.1.2 goose rig - i goose rig - i exhibits 93.8 % , 78.1 % and 50.8 % amino acid identity with duck , zebra finch and human rig - i , respectively [ 76,80 ] .
goose rig - i is highly expressed in the lungs , liver , brain , and the bursa of fabricius , but poorly expressed in the thymus and intestines of 1 week old goslings [ 80 ] .
newcastle disease virus ( ndv ) is a contagious and fatal viral disease affecting most species of birds including chickens , while ducks and sand geese are naturally resistant to it. similar to the inverse correlation between the susceptibility to hpaiv and the basal expression of duck rig - i , a strong inverse correlation between ndv susceptibility and goose rig - i expression was observed [ 75,76 ] .
goose rig - i - transfected 293 t / 17 cells and df - 1 cells can both respond to ndv by upregulating the activity of the ifn - beta promoter and expression levels of irf - 3 and ifit - 1 , while decreasing the viral titer [ 76 ] .
further , goose rig - i mrna levels are increased upon ndv infection in vivo [ 76 ] .
another study also indicated a direct correlation between cellular resistance to ndv infection and rig - i expression in vitro [ 81 ] .
it is suggested that there is an inverse correlation between susceptibility to ndv infection and the endogenous expression of rig - i in birds .
these findings offer further insights into the mechanism by which waterfowl are natural resistant to ndv and hp aiv infections .
3.2 mda5 in humans , mda5 and rig - i are members of an evolutionary conserved family .
mda5 and rig - i are key cytosolic prr that detect the nucleic acids of invading viruses and lead to the activation of the interferon system ( figure 1 ) [ 8,67,68 ] .
mda5 can be activated by dsrna , including the synthetic dsrna analogue poly ( i : c ) [ 82 ] .
long poly ( i : c ) sequences (> 1 kbp ) are selectively recognized by mda5 , whereas relatively short poly ( i : c ) sequences generated by enzyme digestion (< 1 kbp ) are recognized by rig - i ( figure 1 ) [ 82 ] .
therefore , viral rna in infected cells is selectively recognized by rig - i and mda5 , depending on its length .
the activation of rig - i and mda5 initiate signal transduction , resulting in the secretion of type i ifn and various cytokines ( figure 1 ) .
3.2.1 chicken mda5 chickens , unlike ducks , lack rig - i , however mda5 transcripts are present and functionally compensate for the absence of rig - i ( tables 1 and 2 ) [ 69,75 ] .
human and chicken mda5 share 60 % amino acid identity , and the c - terminal region of mda5 shows a relatively high degree of conservation ( about 70 % identity ) [ 83 ] .
chicken mda5 ( chmda5 ) is ubiquitously expressed in several tissues , with the highest expression in the intestines [ 84 ] .
in mammals , rig - i is the main cytosolic prr for the detection of influenza a virus [ 68 ] .
hpaiv h5n1 tempers the human innate immune response by downregulating the expression of endogenous rig - i , which is mediated through inhibition of ifn - beta production [ 85 ] .
in chickens , mda5 is the primary cytosolic influenza a virus sensor in chicken cells including df - 1 fibroblasts and hd11 cells [ 86 ] .
influenza a virus dsrna is recognized by chmda5 resulting in type i ifn induction , which involves chicken lgp2 , cardif and irf3 [ 86 ] .
the overexpression of chmda5 in df - 1 cells induces the activation of the chicken ifn - beta promoter in the absence of dsrna agonist stimulation in a species - specific manner and can be inhibited by the v proteins of human paramyxovirus ( piv5 ) and ndv [ 87 ] .
rnai - mediated knockdown experiments further suggest that chmda5 plays an important role in the ifn response of chicken cells to dsrna , but the proliferation of influenza a viruses is unaffected [ 86 ] .
moreover , another study indicated that the n - terminal 483 amino acids of chmda5 can trigger ifn - beta responses in chicken cells , and can therefore work as an adjuvant and be co - administered with dna vaccines against h5n1 hpaiv to enhance vaccine efficacy [ 88 ] .
furthermore , it was shown that chickens and ducks show differential mda5 expression in the presence of lpaiv [ 45 ] .
interestingly , mda5 and rig - i can distinguish different rna viruses in mammals [ 89 ] , however the immunological characteristics of duck mda5 are not known .
3.3 chicken lgp2 lgp2 , the third member of the rlr family , lacks a card and has a greater affinity for dsrna than rig - i , but retains the rna - binding domain , thus it is a negative regulator of rlr - mediated signaling [ 90 ] .
the putative amino acids of chicken lgp2 ( chlgp2 ) show 53 % and 52 % identity with human and mouse lgp2 , respectively [ 87 ] .
the sirna - mediated knockdown of chlgp2 in chicken cells reduced hpaiv h5n1 - induced type i ifn secretion , while the overexpression of chlgp2 reduced the activation of the chicken ifn - beta promoter [ 87 ] .
this indicates that chlgp2 functions are required for chicken rlr signaling , similar to mammalian lgp2 [ 90 ] .
it is worth noting that many immunological characteristics of chicken lgp2 are not yet understood , and whether or not mda5 and lgp2 are present in other avian species remains to be discovered .
the interactions between influenza or other rna viruses and rig - i , mda5 or lgp2 are largely unknown .
after recognition , the subsequent cell signal transduction and the release of effect factors also need to be studied in detail .
4. nod - like receptors nlr primarily recognize microbial molecules of bacterial origin that are used in antibacterial defenses [ 91 ] .
however , in mammals , nlr sense several different rna or dna viruses , and positively or negatively regulate the innate antiviral response [ 92 ] .
the human nlr family is composed of 23 members , whereas there are at least 34 members in the mouse nlr family [ 92 ] , several of which respond to the various pamp , non - pamp particles and cellular stresses which trigger proinflammatory responses , including the secretion of il - 1beta and il - 18 [ 92,93 ] .
nlr are composed of three major domains : c - terminal leucine - rich repeats ( lrr ) recognizing pamp ligands , a central nucleotide - binding oligomerization ( nod ) domain that mediates self - oligomerization during activation , and a variable n - terminal protein - protein interaction domain involved in signal transduction [ 91 ] .
based on the n - terminal effector domains including the caspase recruitment domain ( card ) , pyrin domain ( pyd ) , acidic transactivating domain , or baculovirus inhibitor repeat ( bir ) , the nlr can be classified into three subfamilies [ 94 ] .
4.1 nlrc5 nlrc5 , a member of the nlr family , is expressed in most cell types as an intracellular receptor , but the role of nlrc5 in inflammatory immune responses is controversial in humans [ 95 ] .
nlrc5 is a positive ifn mediator in response to viral infection [ 96 ] , while it attenuates the antiviral response to vsv [ 97 ] .
in chickens , the inhibitory effects of nlrc5 on inflammatory pathways are well understood [ 98,99 ] .
the expression of chicken nlrc5 is greatly increased in lps - treated hd11 cells , but not in poly ( i : c ) - treated hd11 cells .
the knockdown of nlrc5 expression downregulates the expression of type i ifn ( ifn - alpha and ifn - beta ) , but not il - 6 and mhc class i in chicken hd11 cells [ 98 ] .
also , nlrc5 is induced in response to salmonella endotoxin in hd11 cells [ 99 ] .
these findings may indicate that chicken nlrc5 is involved in the host antimicrobial immune response and may contribute to the design of efficacious poultry vaccines .
many members of the avian nlr family are still not identified .
however , the role for avian nlr in viral immunity is largely unknown .
5. conclusions in the past decade , there has been much progress in understanding the roles of pattern recognition receptors in viral recognition and host defenses .
similar to mammals , three classes of receptors including tlr , rlr and nlr have been identified in birds .
some of these receptors are involved in host antiviral immune responses through the regulation of interferons and proinflammatory cytokines .
the rapid mobilization of type i and type iii ifn is critical for host immunity against viral infection .
however some differences between avian and mammalian tlr include the pseudogene tlr8 , the absence of tlr9 , and the presence of tlr1la , tlr1lb , tlr15 , and tlr21 in birds .
avian tlr3 and tlr7 are involved in rna virus recognition including aiv , mdv and ibdv .
it seems that avian tlr15 and tlr21 , like mammalian tlr4 or tlr9 , are potential sensors recognizing invading microbes including viruses and bacteria .
moreover , some viral sensing receptors are slightly different between fowl and waterfowl .
chickens , unlike ducks , geese and finches , lack rig - i , however mda5 transcripts are present and functionally compensate for the absence of rig - i. the expression of type i ifn upon hpaiv infection in chickens and ducks is dependent upon mda5 and rig - i , respectively .
the expression of ifn - beta upon influenza infection is mainly regulated by rig - i leading to expression of downstream ifn - stimulated antiviral genes .
this may explain the differing susceptibilities to hpaiv h5n1 in the chicken and other birds .
nlrc5 , the only member of the nlr family that has been identified in birds , is reported to be involved in the host antiviral immune response .
although some viral sensing prr and their cognate viral pamp have been identified in birds , there is still a long way to go toward a complete understanding of the viral recognition mechanism and antiviral response of the host , especially in waterfowl .
the ontogeny and the cellular localization of avian prr have yet to be confirmed .
it is unknown yet whether other prr that are absent in mammals are present in birds .
moreover , many signaling molecules and downstream signaling pathways activated by various prr and the cross talk between them also need to be elucidated .
birds , especially migratory birds , are an important reservoir of viruses causing human infections and are a valuable food source .
further understanding of the antiviral function of avian prr could lead to the development of novel vaccines and strategies for controlling infectious diseases .

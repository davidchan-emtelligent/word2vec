background hemorrhagic transformation is a major complication of ischemic stroke , is linked to matrix metalloproteinase - 9 ( mmp - 9 ) , and is exacerbated by tissue plasminogen activator ( tpa ) .
cerebral ischemia / reperfusion is characterized by sur1 - trpm4 ( sulfonylurea receptor 1 - - transient receptor potential melastatin 4 ) channel upregulation in microvascular endothelium .
in humans and rodents with cerebral ischemia / reperfusion ( i / r ) , the sur1 antagonist , glibenclamide , reduces hemorrhagic transformation and plasma mmp - 9 , but the mechanism is unknown .
we hypothesized that tpa induces protease activated receptor 1 ( par1 ) - mediated , ca2 + - dependent phasic secretion of mmp - 9 from activated brain endothelium , and that sur1 - trpm4 is required for this process .
methods cerebral i / r , of 2 and 4 hours duration , respectively , was obtained using conventional middle cerebral artery occlusion .
immunolabeling was used to quantify p65 nuclear translocation .
murine and human brain endothelial cells ( bec ) were studied in vitro , without and with nf - kappab activation , using immunoblot , zymography and elisa , patch clamp electrophysiology , and calcium imaging .
genetic and pharmacological manipulations were used to identify signaling pathways .
results cerebral i / r caused prominent nuclear translocation of p65 in microvascular endothelium .
nf - kappab - activation of bec caused de novo expression of sur1 - trpm4 channels .
in nf - kappab - activated bec : ( i ) tpa caused opening of sur1 - trpm4 channels in a plasmin - , par1 - , trpc3 - and ca2 + - dependent manner ; ( ii ) tpa caused par1 - dependent secretion of mmp - 9 ; ( iii ) tonic secretion of mmp - 9 by activated bec was not influenced by sur1 inhibition ; ( iv ) phasic secretion of mmp - 9 induced by tpa or the par1 - agonist , tfllr , required functional sur1 - trpm4 channels , with inhibition of sur1 decreasing tpa - induced mmp - 9 secretion .
conclusions tpa induces par1 - mediated , sur1 - trpm4 - dependent , phasic secretion of mmp - 9 from activated brain endothelium .

introduction low concentrations of tissue plasminogen activator ( tpa ) are neuroprotective [ 1 ] , and thrombolytic therapy employing recombinant tpa ( rtpa ) greatly improves stroke outcome [ 2 ] .
however , in cerebral ischemia , the administration of recombinant rtpa for thrombolysis can exacerbate breakdown of the blood - brain barrier ( bbb ) , worsen brain edema , and increase the incidence and severity of hemorrhagic transformation [ 3 ] .
the vascular toxicity of rtpa , which is tied to matrix metalloproteinases ( mmp ) , has prompted the development of numerous strategies targeting various molecular pathways linked to mmp , most of which are plasminogen / plasmin - independent [ 4,5 ] .
however , plasmin , the principal downstream product of tpa , also may cause opening of the bbb [ 5 ] .
to date , however , the involvement of a plasmin - linked mechanism in mmp secretion by endothelium has not been extensively studied .
plasmin is a serine protease that can induce canonical activation of protease - activated receptor 1 ( par1 ) by cleaving par1 at arg41 [ 6 ] .
in ischemia , par1 is upregulated by cerebral endothelium [ 7 ] .
canonical par1 activation leads to classical g - protein coupled receptor ( gpcr ) signaling , including in endothelium [ 8,9 ] .
gpcr signaling involves the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5 - bisphosphate ( pip2 ) , generation of diacylglycerol ( dag ) , and activation dag - sensitive transient receptor potential canonical ( trpc ) 3 / 6 channels , which mediate sustained ca2 + influx .
in humans with stroke and in rat models of stroke , sur1 - trpm4 ( sulfonylurea receptor 1 - transient receptor potential melastatin 4 ) channels [ 10 ] are upregulated in all members of the neurovascular unit [ 11,12 ] , with microvascular endothelial cells being the earliest cell - type to upregulate the channel [ 13 ] .
sur1 - trpm4 channels , which conduct monovalent but not divalent cations [ 14,15 ] , are opened by intracellular ca2 + , which acts via calmodulin and a calmodulin binding site at the c terminus of trpm4 [ 16 ] .
sur1 - trpm4 channel opening results in na + influx [ 14,15 ] .
cell depolarization due to na + influx reduces the inward electrochemical driving force for ca2 + , thus acting as a negative regulator to reduce ca2 + influx [ 17 ] by channels such as trpc3 [ 18 ] .
these characteristics of sur1 - trpm4 raised the possibility that sur1 - trpm4 could be involved in par1 signaling linked to ca2 + influx in endothelium .
in humans with stroke and in rodent models of stroke , the sur1 inhibitor , glibenclamide , has been found to reduce hemorrhagic transformation and plasma levels of mmp - 9 [ 19 - 22 ] , but the mechanism is unknown .
prommps , which require proteolytic cleavage to become mature proteases , are secreted via two distinct mechanisms : ( i ) mmps undergo tonic secretion via the normal secretory pathway [ 23 ] ; ( ii ) mmps undergo phasic secretion following gpcr activation [ 24 ] , the latter requiring ca2 + influx [ 25 ] .
here , we hypothesized that tpa induces par1 - mediated , ca2 + - dependent phasic secretion of mmp - 9 from activated brain endothelium , and that sur1 - trpm4 channels are required for this process .

animal experiments were performed under a protocol approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the university of maryland , baltimore and in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations as stipulated in the united states national institutes of health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals .
the university of maryland school of medicine veterinary resources program is fully accredited by the american association for the accreditation of laboratory animal care .
the program of animal care is directed by full - time specialty - trained , laboratory animal veterinarians .
all efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering .
cerebral ischemia / reperfusion methods used in this laboratory for cerebral ischemia / reperfusion ( i / r ) , i.e. , temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion ( mcao ) , have been detailed [ 26,27 ] .
briefly , male wistar rats ( 275 - 325 g , harlan , indianapolis , in ) were anesthetized ( ketamine 60 mg / kg and xylazine 7.5 mg / kg intraperitoneally ) .
spo2 via pulse oximetry and temperature were carefully regulated , and all surgical procedures were performed aseptically .
mcao was obtained using a commercially available intra - arterial occluder ( 0.39 mm ; 4039pk5re ; doccol corp , redlands ca ) inserted retrograde into the external carotid artery and advanced into the internal carotid artery under guidance of a laser doppler flowmeter .
only animals with a drop in relative cerebral blood flow > 75 % were included for further study .
after 120 minutes of mcao , the occluder was withdrawn to allow reperfusion .
the animals were euthanized ( sodium pentobarbital , >= 100 mg / kg , followed by transcardial exsanguination ) after 4 hours of reperfusion , i.e. , 6 hours after onset of i / r , and the brains were analyzed by immunohistochemistry .
immunohistochemistry coronal cryosections ( 12 mum ) were blocked for 1 hour in 2 % donkey serum and 0.2 % tritonx - 100 .
sections were incubated overnight at 4 degreesc with primary antibody against p65 ( gtx102090 ; genetex , irvine ca ) and double - labeled with primary antibody against rat endothelial cell antigen - 1 ( reca - 1 ) ( ma1 - 81510 ; thermo fisher scientific inc. ) .
species appropriate alexa fluor 555 - or fluorescein isothiocyanate - conjugated secondary antibodies were used for visualization .
sections were coverslipped with prolong gold antifade reagent ( p36930 ; thermo fisher scientific inc. ) containing the nuclear stain , dapi ( 4 ' , 6 - diamidine - 2 ' - phenylindole dihydrochloride ) .
omission of primary antibody was used as a negative control .
unbiased measurements of signal intensity within regions of interest ( rois ) were obtained using nis - elements ar software ( nikon instruments , melville , ny , usa ) , as described previously [ 28 ] .
the area that was evaluated was a rectangle , 360 mum x 440 mum , positioned within the aca - mca watershed territory .
specific labeling for p65 within the roi was defined as pixels with signal intensity > 2.0x background .
for nuclear translocation of p65 , the roi was defined by dapi labeling within the same territory .
reagents for in vitro experiments reagents ( used at the concentrations indicated ) , were obtained from : calbiochem ( san diego , ca ) : mmp - 9 and mmp - 2 , recombinant ( 25 ng / ml ) ; genetech ( san francisco , ca ) : tpa ( cathflo ( r ) activase ( r ) [ alteplase ] ; 20 mug / ml ) ; santa cruz biotechnology inc .

cell culture immortalized murine bec ( bend.3 ; atcc , gaithersburg , md ) or immortalized human bec ( lonza , basel , switzerland ) were cultured as described [ 13 ] .
for some experiments , bec were isolated from wild - type or abcc8 - / - male mice ( 25 - 30 gm ) using a modification of the method described [ 29 ] .
endothelial cell activation was obtained by exposure to tnf ( 20 ng / ml ) for 3 - 16 hours under serum - free conditions .
luciferase promoter assay tnf - stimulated activity of the promoter region of abcc8 and trpm4 was determined using luciferase reporter plasmids , as previously described [ 13,30 ] .
photinus luciferase reporter plasmids containing the rat abcc8 promoter ( - 578 to + 80 ) , or mouse trpm4 promoter ( - 1867 to + 105 ) , or four consecutive nf - kappab consensus sequences ( clonetech , mountain view , ca ) were transfected into hepg2 cells using lipofectamine 2000 ( invitrogen ) .
co - transfection of prl - cmv , renilla luciferase expression plasmid served as a control for transfection efficiency .
after transfection , the cells were maintained in basal conditions for 24 hours , then exposed to tnf ( 20 ng / ml ) or vehicle for another 24 hours .
the activities of the photinus and renilla luciferases in extracts of the transfected cells were measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system ( promega , madison , wi ) .
the photinus luciferase activity was divided by the renilla activity from the same sample to normalize the transfection efficiency .
the divided values were then expressed relative to those from cells transfected with chicken beta - actin promoter - driven luciferase in each condition .
to obtain the fold - induction of luciferase activity by tnf , the values with tnf were divided by those from corresponding control samples or empty vector transfection [ 31 ] .
immunoblot immunoblots were performed as described [ 10 ] , using rabbit anti - camkii ( pan ; # 3362s ) or rabbit anti - pthr286 - camkii ( d21e4 ; # 12716s ) , mouse anti - erk1 / 2 ( 3a7 ; # 9107 ) , rabbit anti - pthr202 / tyr204 - erk1 / 2 ( 197g2 ; # 4377 ) , all from cell signaling technology , danverse ma. pcr rt - pcr and qrt - pcr were carried out as described [ 11 ] using the primers listed in tables 1 and 2 .

for whole cell recordings , we used a nystatin perforated patch technique .
nystatin , 50 mg ( calbiochem ) was dissolved in 1 ml dimethylsulfoxide ( dmso ) .
working solutions were made before the experiment by adding 16.5 mul nystatin stock solution to 5 ml of the base pipette solution to yield a final concentration of nystatin of 165 mug / ml and dmso 3.3 mul / ml. to record whole cell macroscopic currents under " physiological " conditions , the extracellular solution contained ( mm ) : nacl 130 , kcl 10 , cacl2 1 , mgcl2 1 , hepes 32.5 , glucose 12.5 , ph 7.4 ; and the pipette solution contained ( mm ) : kcl 55 , k2so4 75 , mgcl2 8 , and hepes 10 , and nystatin , 165 mug / ml , ph 7.2 .
to record whole cell macroscopic currents exclusive of k + channels , the extracellular solution contained ( mm ) : cscl 145 , cacl2 1 , mgcl2 1 , hepes 32.5 , glucose 12.5 , ph 7.4 ; and the pipette solution contained ( mm ) : cscl 145 , mgcl2 8 , and hepes 10 , and nystatin , 165 mug / ml , ph 7.2 .
for inside - out patch recording , we used a bath solution containing ( mm ) : cscl 145 , mgcl2 1 , cacl2 0.2 , egta 5 , hepes 10 , ph 7.3 .
the pipette contained ( mm ) : cscl 145 , cacl2 1.5 , mgcl2 1 , egta 5 , hepes 32.5 , glucose 12.5 , ph 7.4 .
for cell - attached patch recording , both the pipette and the bath contained ( mm ) : cscl 145 , cacl2 1.5 , mgcl2 1 , hepes 32.5 , glucose 12.5 , ph 7.4 .
the following voltage clamp parameters were used : holding potential , - 50 mv ; ramp pulses were from - 100 to + 100 mv , 4 mv / msec , applied every 15 seconds ; step pulses were 300 msec pulses from - 100 mv to + 100 mv in 20 - mv steps , applied every 2000 msec .
steady - state inward currents were quantified at - 50 mv , and are presented in bar graphs as positive values .
calcium measurements bend.3 cells grown on fluorodish ( wpi , sarasota , fl ) were activated with 20 ng / ml tnf for 3 - 16 hours .
the cells were rinsed twice with a bath solution ( hbss containing 10 mm hepes , ph 7.4 ) and then incubated with 5 mum fluo - 4 am and 0.02 % f - 127 pluronic acid in the bath solution in the dark for 1 hour at room temperature [ 32,33 ] .
the cells were washed twice with the bath solution and mounted in an inverted microscope .
changes in cytoplasmic free [ ca2 +] in individual cells were measured by using a zeiss lsm 510 confocal microscope with an argon laser ( zeiss , jena , germany ) with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 515 - 530 nm. fluorescence images ( 512 x 512 pixels ) were obtained at 4 - second intervals .
to quantify fluorescence , pixel intensities within the selected single cell areas of interest were processed with the lsm image examiner software ( zeiss ) .
data are reported as mean change in [ ca2 +] at 10 - 12 minutes following drug application .
gelatin zymography zymography was performed to measure the enzymatic activities of matrix metalloproteases ( mmps ) from bec culture media .
the media under various conditions were collected and concentrated up to 75 - fold using a commercial ultrafiltration device with a 10 kda nominal molecular weight limit ( emd millipore , billerica , ma ) .
the concentrated samples were separated on a novex 10 % zymogram protein gel containing 0.1 % gelatin ( life technologies , grand island , ny ) .
the gelatin degrading proteolytic activities of the mmps on the gel were detected by following the protocols provided by the manufacturer .
briefly , after electrophoresis , the gel was incubated with a renaturing buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature and with a developing buffer for 24 - 96 hours , depending on the amount of enzyme in the samples .
to detect mmp activities in the gel , the gel was stained by a coomassie g - 250 solution ( life technologies ) .
silencing abcc8 a control lentiviral vector expressing egfp under the control of cmv promoter , psmpuw - cmv - egfp was obtained from the recombinant virus core facility , university of maryland , baltimore .
to construct a lentiviral vector expressing mouse abcc8 - specific shrna with egfp , psmpuw - cmv - egfp - mi - shabcc8 , we amplified ~ 250 bp - long dna fragment containing mir - 30 based shabcc8 cassette using the plenti - gfap - egfp - mi - shact1 ( kind gift of dr. zhang , department of neurology , thomas jefferson university , philadelphia , pa ) as a template and cloned downstream of egfp in psmpuw - cmv - egfp by recombinant pcr and standard molecular cloning methods .
all plasmids involved in pcr were validated by sequencing .
the shrna sequences in the mir - 30 based shabcc8 cassette used in this study include mouse shabcc8 - a ( 5 ' - tcccgccacctccatttgtacatgccagc - 3 ') and mouse shabcc8 - b ( 5 ' - ttcgagagtcccttcaataagcaaaggta - 3 ') .
we used a commercial service for lentivirus packaging and production with a titer of ~ 1x106 iu / ml , available at the recombinant virus core facility , university of maryland .
to inhibit expression of abcc8 , 3x104 bend.3 cells or mouse insulinoma cells ( beta - tc - 6 ; atcc , gaithersburg , md ) , which were used as a positive control , were transduced with the 1x105 shabcc8 lentivirus for 4 days and cultured for 3 additional days with daily replacement of the culture medium .
silencing trpm4 control and trpm4 sirna ( santa cruz biotechnology ) was transfected into bend.3 cells using the cell line nucleofector kit ( lonza ; walkersville , md ) .
data analysis data are presented as mean +/ - s.e. statistical analyses were performed using origin pro ( v8 ; originlab corp. , north hampton ma ) .
student 's t - test or 1 - way anova with fisher 's post - hoc comparisons were used for statistical evaluations .
results one of the hallmarks of ischemia / reperfusion ( i / r ) of the brain is activation of nf - kappab [ 34 - 36 ] .
in the rat mcao model , 2 hours of ischemia followed by 4 hours of reperfusion resulted in robust nf - kappab activation , most prominently in microvessels ( fig 1a ) .
at 6 hours , there was a significant increase in total p65 as well as nuclear p65 ( fig 1b and 1c ) .
cerebral i / r also is well established to cause upregulation of mmp - 9 [ 37,38 ] and of sur1 - trpm4 [ 11,13 ] in microvascular endothelium .
we thus elected to study the relationship between nf - kappab activation , mmp - 9 and sur1 - trpm4 in endothelial cell cultures .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0195526.g001 fig 1 nf - kappab activation in vivo after cerebral ischemia / reperfusion .
a : immunolabeling for p65 ( red ) in coronal sections from the middle cerebral artery territory of a control rat ( left ) and 6 hours after onset of i / r ( right ) , showing nuclear translocation of p65 following i / r , but not in control ; tissues were double immunolabeled for the endothelial marker , reca - 1 ( green ) , and nuclei were stained with dapi ( 4 ' , 6 - diamidine - 2 ' - phenylindole dihydrochloride ; blue ) ; p65 ( red ) within nuclei ( blue ) of microvascular endothelial cells appears pink .

c : bar graphs quantifying increases in total p65 ( left ) and in nuclear p65 ( right ) following i / r ; n = 5 rats / condition ; ** , p < 0.01 .
the promoter regions of the genes that encode sur1 and trpm4 , abcc8 and trmp4 , both contain canonical p65 binding elements [ 30,39 ] .
to ascertain their functionality , we studied luciferase constructs of both promoters , expressed in hepg2 cells .
nf - kappab activation by tnf stimulated both promotors , as well as the positive control ( fig 2a ) .
in murine bec , nf - kappab activation caused upregulation of transcripts for abcc8 and trpm4 ( fig 2b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0195526.g002 fig 2 sur1 - trpm4 channel upregulation in vitro .

b : murine bec were exposed to tnf ( 20 ng / ml ) and lysate was analyzed by rt - pcr 16 hours later ; transcripts for abcc8 and trpm4 were upregulated compared to control ( ctr ) ; the induction of abcc8 mrna by tnf was reduced by the nf - kappab inhibitor , pdtc ( pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate ) ; beta - actin mrna was used as a loading control ; representative of 3 replicates .
c : macroscopic and single channel ( inside - out patch ) currents induced by atp depletion in activated but not in non - activated ( ctr ) murine bec ; currents were blocked by glibenclamide ( glib ) and 9 - phenanthrol ( 9 - phe ) .
d : single channel current in an inside - out patch with 4 single channel levels during changes in bath solution from 145 mm cs +/ 1 mum ca2 + , 145 mm cs +/ 0 mum ca2 + , 145 mm cs +/ 1 mum ca2 + , 0 mm cs +/ 75 mm ca2 + , 145 mm cs +/ 1 mum ca2 + .
e : quantification of macroscopic currents at - 50 mv induced by atp depletion or diazoxide in activated or non - activated ( ctr ) murine bec ; currents were blocked by glibenclamide and by gene deletion of abcc8 ( sur1ko ) and gene suppression of trmp4 ( sirna ) ; cells / condition for each bar : 35 , 12 , 14 , 19 , 11 , 11 ; 24 , 19 ; 9 , 13 ; ** , p < 0.01 ; *** , p < 0.001 .
f : immunoblots for pcamkii and camkii , with densitometric quantification of pcamkii in murine bec without activation , under control conditions ( ct ) and after exposure to the ca2 + ionophore ( ci ) , a23187 ( 5 mum x 10 minutes ) , and in activated bec exposed to tnf in the absence and presence of glibenclamide ( glib ) ; both bands shown had molecular masses of 50 kd , corresponding to pcamkiialpha and camkiialpha ; pcamkii normalized to levels induced by a23187 ; n = 5 .
nf - kappab activation of murine bec upregulated cell membrane channels that exhibited the characteristic properties of the non - selective cation channel , sur1 - trpm4 [ 10 ] : channel currents were carried by cs + [ 14,15 ] , which excludes involvement of katp channels ; currents were activated by depleting intracellular atp , increasing [ ca2 +] i or applying the sur1 agonist , diazoxide [ 14,17 ] ; and currents were inhibited by the sur1 antagonist , glibenclamide [ 40 ] , and by the cell - permeable trpm4 antagonist , 9 - phenanthrol ( fig 2c and 2e ) , which acts intracellularly [ 41 ] and , importantly , does not block trpc3 [ 42 ] .
sur1 - trpm4 channels were sensitive to intracellular ca2 + , showed no inactivation during sustained ca2 + elevations , and were not permeable to ca2 + ( fig 2d ) .
activation failed to upregulate functional channels in endothelial cells following gene suppression of either abcc8 / sur1 or trpm4 / trpm4 ( fig 2e ) .
the normal function of the sur1 - trpm4 channel is to act as a negative regulator of ca2 + influx [ 43 ] .
accordingly , inhibition of sur1 - trpm4 increases [ ca2 +] i , an effect that can lead to an increase in pcamkii [ 28 ] .
here also , we found an increase in pcamkii , with no change in camkii , when activation of murine bec was carried out in the presence of glibenclamide ( fig 2f ; see also s1 fig ) , consistent with the normal inhibitory effect of the sur1 - trpm4 channel on ca2 + influx .
tpa opens the sur1 - trpm4 channel in activated murine bec , but not in non - activated bec , rtpa ( 20 mug / ml ) induced both macroscopic and single channel sur1 - trpm4 currents ( fig 3 ) .
channel opening was observed with rtpa as low as 1 - 2.5 mug / ml , although these responses developed more slowly .
rtpa - induced currents were observed when normal physiological salt solutions were used , as well as when cs + was used as the charge carrier to block katp channels ( fig 3a and 3b ) .
the rtpa - induced currents were blocked by both glibenclamide and 9 - phenanthrol , consistent with sur1 - trpm4 ( fig 3a - 3c ) .
single channel currents of ~ 25 ps [ 10 ] were induced by rtpa when cells were studied using a cell - attached configuration ( fig 3d ) , with this specific configuration used to preclude a direct effect of rtpa on the extracellular face of channel itself .
control experiments showed that sur1 - trpm4 channel opening was not due to l - arginine , which is present in rtpa ( alteplase ( r )) ( fig 3c ) .

it was previously shown that outward rectification of trpm4 is observed with pip2 depletion [ 44,45 ]. of note , macroscopic sur1 - trpm4 currents induced by rtpa exhibited outward rectification ( fig 3a and 3b ) , whereas macroscopic sur1 - trpm4 currents induced by atp depletion ( fig 2c ) or by the calcium ionophore a23187 ( vide infra ) exhibited no rectification .
outward rectification with rtpa is consistent with rtpa ( but not atp depletion or a23187 ) causing pip2 depletion due to gpcr activation .
sur1 - trpm4 channel opening by tpa requires ca2 + influx - - possible involvement of trpc3 we hypothesized that sur1 - trpm4 channels , which are known to be opened by an increase in [ ca2 +] i [ 43 ] , were being opened by ca2 + influx induced by rtpa .
the removal of extracellular ca2 + resulted in a gradual loss of sur1 - trpm4 channel activity ( fig 4a and 4b ) , consistent with a requirement for ca2 + influx to maintain sur1 - trpm4 channel opening .
step pulses during rtpa application showed that sur1 - trpm4 currents were sustained at hyperpolarizing potentials ( fig 4a - 3 ) , consistent with sustained , not transient , increases in intracellular ca2 + induced by rtpa .
gd3 + , a non - specific blocker of ca2 + - permeable channels that also blocks trpm4 [ 46,47 ] , reduced sur1 - trpm4 channel activity ( fig 4b ) .

we examined the mechanism of ca2 + influx .
channel activity was not affected by the trpv channel blocker , ruthenium red , but was strongly reduced by skf - 96365 and pyr3 ( fig 4b ) , with pyr3 being an established inhibitor of trpc3 [ 48 ] that also inhibits orai1 [ 49 ] .
we performed ca2 + imaging experiments to confirm that rtpa caused ca2 + influx .
rtpa induced a sustained rise in intracellular ca2 + in activated bec , but not in non - activated bec ( fig 4c ) .
as with sur1 - trpm4 channel activity , ca2 + influx was blocked by gd3 + and skf - 96365 , but not by ruthenium red ( fig 4c ) [ 50 ] .
our ca2 + imaging experiments invariably demonstrated that rtpa induced a slowly developing rise in intracellular ca2 + that was sustained , not transient .
similarly , our patch clamp experiments demonstrated that rtpa induced sur1 - trpm4 currents that were sustained during step pulses ( fig 4a - 3 ) , consistent with sustained ca2 + influx .
although , as noted , skf - 96365 and pyr3 can inhibit both trpc3 and orai1 , orai1 characteristically gives rise to an inactivating or partially inactivating ca2 + influx [ 51 ] , with inactivation due to ca2 + - induced phosphorylation of stim1 [ 52 ]. by contrast , gpcr - mediated trpc3 activation characteristically gives rise a slowly developing , sustained ca2 + influx [ 53,54 ] .
thus , pyr3 - sensitive , non - inactivating ca2 + influx induced by rtpa likely was due to trpc3 , not orai1 , with trpc3 - mediated ca2 + influx resulting in sur1 - trpm4 channel activation .
proteolytic activity of tpa is required the non - specific serine threonine protease inhibitors , aprotinin and leupeptin , prevented rtpa - induced ca2 + influx in activated bec ( fig 5a ) , indicating a requirement for proteolysis by rtpa .

proteolytic cleavage of n - methyl - d - aspartate receptor ( nmdar ) by rtpa has been shown to augment ca2 + influx in neurons [ 55 ] .
in non - activated bec , ca2 + influx was induced by glutamate , but this effect was not augmented by rtpa , and glutamate - induced ca2 + influx was lost after bec activation ( fig 5b ) .
these data indicate that nmdar is not the proteolytic target of rtpa in activated bec .
we excluded other potential targets of proteolysis .
in cos - 7 cells that stably express trpm4 ( but not par1 [ 56 ] or tlr4 [ 57 ]) , trpm4 channels could be activated by the ca2 + ionophore , a23187 , but not by rtpa ( not shown ) .
as noted above , opening of single sur1 - trpm4 channels in cell - attached patches precludes proteolytic action on either subunit of the channel , since the channels are shielded by the pipette , suggesting that sur1 and trpm4 were not the proteolytic target of rtpa .
sur1 - trpm4 channel opening by tpa requires plasmin plasminogen binds to endothelial cells [ 58 ] , bound plasminogen can be activated by tpa [ 58 ] , and cell surface - generated plasmin can activate par1 or tlr4 [ 9 ] , both of which can induce ca2 + influx via dag - sensitive trpc3 / 6 [ 59 ] .
consistent with involvement of plasmin , tranexamic acid , which competitively inhibits the activation of plasminogen to plasmin , prevented the induction of sur1 - trpm4 channel currents by rtpa in activated bec , although currents still could be induced by the ca2 + ionophore , a23187 ( fig 5c ) .
also , exogenous plasmin recapitulated the effects of rtpa on activated bec , including the induction of glibenclamide - sensitive sur1 - trpm4 currents and the induction of ca2 + influx ( fig 5c and 5e ) .
sur1 - trpm4 channel opening by tpa requires par1 consistent with involvement of par1 , the par1 - selective antagonist , rwj56110 [ 60 ] , prevented the induction of sur1 - trpm4 channel currents by rtpa in activated bec , although currents still could be induced by the ca2 + ionophore , a23187 ( fig 5d ) .
also , application of the par1 - agonist peptide , sfllrn , recapitulated the effect of rtpa on activated bec [ 61 ] , causing the induction of glibenclamide - sensitive sur1 - trpm4 channel currents ( fig 5d ) .
canonical activation of par1 by cleavage of the n - terminus exodomain at arg41 results in activation of the mapk pathway , which can be demonstrated by rapid phosphorylation of erk1 / 2 ( p42 / 44 mapk ) at thr202 / tyr204 [ 6,62 ] .
erk1 / 2 phosphorylation was increased by activation alone , and was further increased by brief exposure to rtpa ( fig 5f ; see also s2 fig ) , consistent with canonical arg41 - par1 signaling induced by rtpa .
apart from par1 , plasmin also can signal via tlr4 [ 9 ] , and tlr4 can activate dag - sensitive trpc channels [ 63 ] .
potential involvement of tlr4 was excluded , however , as plasmin - induced ca2 + influx was not blocked by the specific tlr4 antagonist , tak - 242 ( s3 fig ) .
together , these findings demonstrated involvement of the plasmin / par1 / trpc / ca2 + pathway in sur1 - trpm4 channel opening by rtpa in activated bec .
tonic vs. phasic mmp - 9 secretion prommps , which require proteolytic cleavage to become mature proteases , are secreted via two distinct mechanisms : ( i ) mmps undergo tonic secretion via the normal secretory pathway [ 23 ] ; ( ii ) mmps undergo phasic secretion following gpcr activation [ 24 ] .
notably , receptor - induced secretion requires ca2 + influx [ 25 ] .
in non - activated bec , mmp - 9 was minimally expressed ( fig 6a and 6b ) .
however , activation caused a several - fold upregulation of mmp - 9 mrna , and a significant increase in gelatinase activity , consistent with tonic secretion of mmp - 9 ( fig 6a and 6b ) .
mmp - 2 mrna and gelatinase activity were slightly decreased ( fig 6a and 6b ) [ 64 ] .

d right : gelatin zymography showing that after overnight activation , phasic secretion of mmp - 9 induced by tfllr is inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with shrna against abcc8 (*) ; n = 3 .
in addition to tonic secretion , phasic secretion of mmp - 9 by endothelial cells can be triggered by receptor activation [ 24 ] .
both rtpa and the par1 - agonist peptide , tfllr , induced a marked increase in mmp - 9 gelatinase activity ( fig 6c ) .
activation was required , as no gelatinase activity was released by rtpa or tfllr applied to non - activated bec ( not shown ) .
sur1 inhibition and tonic vs. phasic mmp - 9 secretion the addition of glibenclamide during activation of bec had no effect on tonic mmp - 9 secretion ( fig 6b ) .
however , glibenclamide significantly reduced phasic mmp - 9 secretion induced by rtpa ( fig 6c ) .
this last finding was unexpected , since ca2 + influx is required for phasic mmp - 9 secretion induced by gpcr activation [ 65 ] , and sur1 - trpm4 inhibition increases intracellular ca2 + ( see fig 2e ) .
a similar inhibitory effect of glibenclamide on phasic secretion of mmp - 9 was observed with tfllr - activation of par1 ( fig 6c ) .
importantly , previous work had shown that glibenclamide does not affect the proteolytic activity of rtpa [ 20 ] .
the effect of glibenclamide was reproduced in activated bec expressing shrna directed against abcc8 ( fig 6d ) , confirming that the effect of glibenclamide was due to sur1 inhibition , and showing again that ca2 + dysregulation produced by inhibiting sur1 - trpm4 channel strongly reduced phasic mmp - 9 secretion .
human bec the foregoing experiments were performed using murine bec .
to examine the potential clinical significance of sur1 inhibition on mmp - 9 secretion , we replicated key experiments using human bec .
in these cells as well , activation resulted in upregulation of sur1 - trpm4 channels that could be activated by rtpa ( fig 7a - 7d ) .
as with murine bec , tonic secretion of mmp - 9 by activated human bec was not influenced by sur1 inhibition ( not shown ) , whereas phasic secretion of mmp - 9 induced by rtpa or by the par1 - agonist peptide , tfllr , was significantly reduced by glibenclamide ( fig 7e ) .
unlike murine bec , expression of mmp - 2 was prominent in human bec , and phasic secretion of mmp - 2 was slightly reduced by glibenclamide ( fig 7e , upper panel ) .

discussion here , we demonstrated that tpa induces mmp - 9 secretion from activated brain endothelial cells , and we elucidated the signaling mechanism involved .
we found that nf - kappab - activation of bec , as occurs in vivo during i / r , caused de novo expression of sur1 - trpm4 channels and , in activated bec : ( i ) tpa opens sur1 - trpm4 channels ; ( ii ) sur1 - trpm4 channel activity is involved in the phasic secretion of mmp - 9 induced by tpa ; ( iii ) both the activation of sur1 - trpm4 channels and the phasic secretion of mmp - 9 require par1 signaling .
key aspects of the findings made in murine bec were replicated in human bec , lending important translational relevance to our studies .
notably , the signaling cascade identified here involving tpa / plasmin , par - 1 and ca2 + in mmp - 9 secretion in nf - kappab - activated brain endothelial cells ( fig 8 ) is similar to the cascade involving thrombin , par - 1 and ca2 + in mmp - 9 secretion in pericytes and nf - kappab - activated monocytes [ 66,67 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0195526.g008 fig 8 proposed mechanism for tpa - induced phasic secretion of mmp - 9 by nf - kappab - activated brain endothelium .
tpa catalyzes the cleavage of plasminogen , yielding plasmin .
plasmin activates the g - protein coupled receptor , par1 , by proteolytic cleavage of its n - terminal domain at arg 41 , allowing its tethered ligand to bind intramolecularly to activate the receptor .
activated par1 signals via the g - protein , galphaq , activating phospholipase cbeta ( plcbeta ) , which catalyzes the cleavage of membrane - bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5 - biphosphate ( pip2 ) into the second messengers , inositol ( 1,4,5 ) trisphosphate ( ip3 ) and diacylglycerol ( dag ) .
dag activates trpc3 , resulting in ca2 + influx .
dag - induced ca2 + influx triggers phasic secretion of mmp - 9 , and causes activation of sur1 - trpm4 , which results in na + influx .
cell depolarization due to na + influx reduces the inward electrochemical driving force for ca2 + , consistent with sur1 - trpm4 functioning as a negative regulator of ca2 + influx .
the present study is the first to show that native sur1 - trpm4 channels are opened by ca2 + influx induced by g - protein coupled receptor activation .
previously , sur1 - trpm4 channel opening in cerebral ischemia was attributed exclusively to pathological depletion of atp [ 43 ] .
linking the sur1 - trpm4 channel to par1 signaling broadens the pathological implications of channel upregulation , since in ischemia , endogenous tpa / plasmin as well as thrombin both signal via par1 , and may be responsible for receptor - induced mmp - 9 secretion in the absence of exogenous ( recombinant ) tpa [ 68 ] .
in cerebral ischemia , neutrophils are believed to comprise a critical source of mmp - 9 responsible for hemorrhagic transformation [ 69 ] , but other cell types intrinsic to the brain , including neurons , microglia , pericytes and endothelial cells also express mmp - 9 ( see review [ 69 ]) .
during the first 24 hours after focal ischemia , mmp - 9 appears predominantly within microvascular endothelial cells and neutrophils , both within and at the periphery of the infarct [ 37 ] , with laser capture microscopy clearly demonstrating that the microvascular endothelium in ischemic areas contains high levels of mmp - 9 [ 38 ] .
thus , the study of microvascular endothelium adds an important dimension to our understanding of mmp biology in the brain following i / r. in vitro models of stroke frequently mimic cerebral ischemia using oxygen - glucose deprivation ( ogd ) .
however , ogd does not fully recapitulate the pathological effects of i / r , specifically , the activation of nf - kappab signaling. with in vivo mcao models , one of the hallmarks of i / r is activation of nf - kappab as early as 15 minutes after reperfusion [ 34,36 ] , an event that is later accompanied by upregulation of tnf [ 64 ] .
blockage of either tnf [ 64 ] or nf - kappab [ 34,35 ] ameliorates the effects of i / r and reduces mmp - 9 levels [ 64 ] .
moreover , in vitro , when human bec are subjected to hypoxia followed by reoxygenation , but not hypoxia alone , an nf - kappab complex composed of p65 and p50 rel proteins is rapidly activated within 15 - 30 minutes [ 70 ] .
in human bec , a robust increase in mmp - 9 protein is obtained by tnf - mediated nf - kappab activation , but not by ogd [ 71 ] .
thus , the study of bec following nf - kappab activation further broadens our understanding of mmp biology in the brain following i / r .
par1 plays an important role in cerebral ischemia [ 72 ] .
canonical cleavage by thrombin and plasmin at arg 41 stabilizes a par1 conformation that preferentially associates with g - proteins of the gq and g12 / 13 families [ 73 ] , induces erk1 / 2 phosphorylation [ 62 ] , and leads to innate inflammation and bbb disruption .
here , we confirmed that tpa leads to canonical par1 signaling .
in cerebral ischemia , silencing par1 reduces neurological deficits , reduces bbb leakage , and decreases neuronal degeneration [ 74 ] , but par1 inhibitors also increase hemorrhagic transformation [ 75 ] .
the work presented here and previously [ 19 - 22 ] demonstrates that inhibiting sur1 - trpm4 signaling downstream of canonical par1 activation can preserve the benefit of par1 inhibition without incurring the undesirable pro - hemorrhagic effect .
hemorrhagic transformation results from the catastrophic structural failure of the microvasculature [ 76 ] .
in stroke , hemorrhagic transformation occurs predominantly in regions subjected to i / r , not usually in normal brain or , logically , in tissues that are not perfused .
thus , it is primarily endothelium that has been activated by i / r , i.e. , endothelium that expresses sur1 - trpm4 , that it is at risk from tpa .
also , rtpa administration in stroke patients is generally considered to be less safe at later times after onset of ischemia , reflecting , perhaps , the time required for transcriptional upregulation of sur1 - trpm4 channels [ 13 ] .
these observations , coupled with the findings reported here , are consistent with the notion that the par1 / trpc3 / sur1 - trpm4 axis in activated bec is a target of tpa in cerebral ischemia .
most important , our findings are consistent with the preclinical and clinical data showing that sulfonylurea antagonists reduce plasma mmp - 9 levels and hemorrhagic transformation in cerebral ischemia [ 19 - 22 ] .
also , we found that sur1 inhibition reduced receptor - mediated phasic secretion but not tonic secretion of mmp - 9 from activated endothelium .
this observation predicts that sulfonylurea antagonists will reduce levels of mmp - 9 only partially , but not completely , precisely as found in human stroke [ 21,22 ] .
overall , our findings support the concept of an important role for a plasmin - linked mechanism in mmp secretion and hemorrhagic transformation , which may supplement plasminogen / plasmin - independent mechanisms [ 4,5 ] .
the precise mechanism by which sur1 blockade inhibits gpcr - mediated phasic secretion of mmp remains to be determined .
our findings led to the apparent paradox that , on the one hand , ca2 + influx is required for gpcr - induced phasic secretion of mmp from activated endothelial cells [ 25 ] whereas , on the other hand , sur1 blockade , which increases intracellular ca2 + [ 43 ] , inhibits phasic secretion of mmp .
disrupting intracellular ca2 + homeostasis by inhibiting sur1 - trpm4 can affect numerous ca2 + - dependent factors and pathways , and thus several mechanisms potentially could be involved .
one that we favor involves desensitization and internalization of par1 , enhanced by elevated levels of pcamkii , a mechanism that would specifically target phasic but not tonic secretion .
gpcr activation is known to trigger receptor desensitization and internalization that is dependent upon gpcr kinase , arrestin and clathrin , as well as camkii [ 77,78 ] , the latter implicated in phosphorylation of the receptor [ 79,80 ] and of arrestin [ 81 ] .
consistent with this , our data showed that sur1 - trpm4 inhibition resulted in a significant increase in pcamkii ( fig 2e ) .
further work will be required to clarify whether pcamkii augments par1 desensitization in bec .
conclusions tpa induces par1 - mediated , ca2 + - dependent phasic secretion of mmp - 9 from activated brain endothelium , and sur1 - trpm4 is required for this process .
to the extent that mmp - 9 secretion is essential for hemorrhagic transformation , the data presented here are important for understanding mechanisms of hemorrhagic transformation in stroke .
emerging evidence indicates that glibenclamide exerts important beneficial effects in cerebral ischemia , especially in humans with large hemispheric infarctions [ 21,22 ] , reaffirming a critical role for sur1 - trpm4 channels in stroke .

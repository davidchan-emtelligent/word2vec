background the first stage in the implant of a total knee arthroplasty with computer - assisted surgery is to fasten the emitters to the femur and the tibia .
these trackers must be hard - fixed to the bone .
the objectives of our study are to evaluate the technical problems and complications of these tracker - pins , the necessary time to fix them to the bone and the possible advantages of a new femoral - fixed tracker - pin .
methods three hundred and sixty seven tracker - pins were used in one hundred and fifty one computer - assisted total knee replacements .
a bicortical screw was used to fix the tracker to the tibia in all cases ; in the femur , however , a bicortical tracker was used in 112 cases , while a new device ( ortholock ) with percutaneous fixation pins was employed in the remaining 39 .
results technical problems related to the fixing of the trackers appeared in nine cases ( 2.5 %) .
the mean surgery time to fix the tracker pin to the tibia was 3 minutes ( range 2 - 7 ) , and 5 minutes in the case of the femoral pin ( range : 4 - 11 ) , although with the new tool it was only three minutes ( range 2 - 4 ) ( p < 0.001 ) .
no complications were observed with this new device .
conclusion the incidence of problems and complications with the fixing systems used in knee navigation is very small .
the use of a new device with percutaneous pins facilitates the fixing of femoral trackers and decreases the time needed to place them .
background several studies have confirmed that the optimal positioning and alignment of prosthetic components are crucial for the best long - term outcomes. with the standard mechanical instrumentation , however , this is not possible in all cases [ 1 ] .
computer - assisted surgery ( cas ) has shown its usefulness to achieve a better placement of total knee arthroplasty ( tka ) in the sagittal and coronal planes .
comparative studies between surgery with and without navigation assistance have demonstrated the advantages of cas when it comes to bone cutting following the limb 's mechanical axis .
although the long - term follow - up is still unknown , the improved placement of the implants will presumably offer better results in the tka in the medium - and long - term [ 2 ] .
there are different navigation systems in tka ; some need to previously acquire an image ( ct - based systems ) while others do not ; some utilize wires to connect the trackers to the computer and others are wireless .
current imageless navigation systems consist of a workstation , an infrared optical camera system , and battery - powered wireless trackers .
these trackers are rigidly fixed to the bone so that their position , when compared with the anatomically selected points , remains constant and any movement of the bone and its associated tracker position is recorded .
the navigational tools rely on the communication between the light - emitting diodes on the trackers and the infrared camera that locates the tracker position in space .
the positional information of the trackers , the attached bone , and the instruments are analyzed by the computer , which determines the real - time position of the leg within a 3 - dimensional coordinate system .
in the first models , three emitters fixed to the anterior superior iliac spine , distal femur and proximal tibia with bicortical screws were necessary .
in the new systems , however , only two trackers , fixed to the distal femur and proximal tibia , are necessary .
the objectives of our study are to evaluate the problems and complications which may arise while using these tracker - pins .
we analyze the problems found with the placement of the trackers , any fixing flaws that forced the termination of the procedure and the complications related to the fixing of the trackers .
we also studied the eventual advantages of a new femoral fixed emitter as to the necessary time for its fixation and as to the technical problems found .
methods one hundred and fifty one tka were performed with navigation using an imageless , wireless system ( stryker - leibinger , freiburg , germany ) between january 2002 and march 2006 .
the last thirty two cases were operated using minimally invasive surgery and a midvastus approach ( figure 1 ) .
the study has been performed following the ethical recommendations of the carlos iii health institute ( fis 02 / 0226 , fis 05 / 1065 ) , the spanish national healthcare system ( ministry of health and food ) and it was approved by the regional ethic committee .
a specific informed consent was obtained from the patients included in the study .
figure 1 total knee replacement with minimally invasive surgery and navigation .
three hundred and sixty seven tracker - pins were used in total .
in the first 65 tkr , an iliac crest screw was placed ( software versions 1.2 and 1.3 ) , but in the remaining patients it was unnecessary thanks to the use of a new software ( versions 2.0 and 3.1 ) .
a bicortical screw ( 4 mm in diameter and a length of 20 - 60 mm ) was used to fix the tracker pin to the tibia in all cases , whereas in the femur , a bicortical tracker was used in 112 cases and a new device with two percutaneous fixation pins ( ortholock anchoring device ) ( stryker - leibinger ) ( 3 mm in diameter x 150 mm , predrilled ) ( figure 2 ) was used in the remaining 39 .
the tracker was mounted and tightly closed onto the tracker interface , which was clamped with a screwdriver .
the stability of the tracker was checked manually by two surgeons .
anova test was used to compare the mean surgery time to fix the tracker pin to the femur between the bicortical tracker group and the ortholock group .
figure 2 new femoral tracker fixing device .
results technical problems arose in nine cases ( 2.5 %) related to the fixing of the trackers .
in three cases , the fixing of the iliac crest screw could n't be performed and the navigation was aborted .
in another three cases , the loosening of the femoral screw impeded the navigation and also was aborted .
in two cases two attempts were necessary , and yet in another case three attempts were necessary ( always with the femoral tracker ) .
no complication was found when the ortholock device was used .
the mean surgery time to fix the tracker pin to the tibia was 3 minutes ( range 2 - 7 ) and 5 minutes for the femoral pins ( range 4 - 11 ) ( sd : 1.16 ) .
fixation to the femur was reduced to 3 minutes ( range 2 - 4 ) ( sd : 0.33 ) with the new percutaneous ortholock device showing statistical significance ( p < 0.001 ) compared with the bicortical group .
we did n't find any major complications such as fractures , infections or vascular - nervous damages .
in three cases we found a painful scar in the tibial tracker hole that disappeared after two months .
discussion cas helps to improve the limb alignment of the tka .
furthermore , it also seems to diminish the presence of systemic emboli [ 3 ] and to lessen the risk of transfusion [ 4,5 ] .
other authors have found that navigation - assisted patients showed statistically significant better results in the flexion range , hss score , and womac scores , when compared with conventional surgery patients [ 6 ] .
a recent meta - analysis confirms that cas improves the leg axis , although the numbers used in many of these studies were far too small to discriminate any other results .
the disadvantages related to the cas are a longer surgery time and the possibility of complications and adverse effects due to tracker fixing .
during the initial use of the navigation system , the placement of the trackers and the performance of the anatomic survey added approximately 15 to 20 minutes .
once the surgeon became familiar with these methods , the placement of the trackers and the anatomic survey added approximately 10 - 15 minutes [ 5,7 ] .
there were a few complications related either to the computer software or the tracker pins inserted in the bones [ 8 ] .
the placement of the pins and screws in the bone is inevitably associated with some risk .
using pins for tracker fixation creates potential damage issues to neurovascular structures and may cause the breakage of the devices inside the bone , although we did not experience any of these problems in our study .
another issue related to the pins required for fixation of the trackers was the use of a pin in the iliac crest with a separately prepared and draped area .
although there had been no known problems with this technique , it has been abandoned , since it is no longer necessary for the procedure thanks to the updated software .
when the iliac crest tracker was used , sikorski and blythe [ 8 ] found a 6 % of injuries to the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh with some persistent numbness , three pin - tract infections ( 3 %) , and two periprosthetic fractures , both of which occurred to elderly , osteoporotic patients and after major falls .
one was through the site of the screw ( the teeth produced an ' apple - corer ' effect and a fracture of the shaft of the femur was associated with its use ) and the other through a medial femoral condyle well away from the site of the screw .
these authors also report a 4 % of pin - tract infections in the tibia .
specific navigation complications were observed in two cases of the study undergone by jenny et al [ 9 ] : one broken pelvic drill and one femoral screw forgotten ; the authors , however , did not consider that these complications had any significant adverse effects .
three ( 5 %) complications were related to the navigation process in another study [ 10 ] ; in these three cases , rigid bodies were contaminated with blood , which led to tracking problems with the navigation system 's camera .
after cleaning the rigid bodies , the operations could be finished without any further problems .
a potential source of error can be a poor fixation of the locator to the bone , especially in the case of porotic bone .
the accuracy of the system is totally dependent on the stability of the beacon or reflector arrays .
any movement altered the results .
we consider that the tracker was firm enough when no movement was possible with the strength of one 's hands although we admit that it is a subjective finding .
throughout the years , bone fixation systems have been modified to allow for a more secure fixation .
the new ortholock system allows for a faster fixation , a percutaneous placement and a more versatile positioning of the femoral emitters .
conclusion the incidence of problems and complications of the fixing systems used in navigation is very small .
the time needed to place them is close to six minutes .
thus , the use of a new device with percutaneous pins facilitates the fixing of femoral trackers .

while renal cell carcinoma is the most commonly diagnosed neoplasm of the kidney , its simultaneous diagnosis with a gastrointestinal malignancy is a rare , but well reported phenomenon .
this discussion focuses on three independent cases in which each patient was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma and a unique synchronous gastrointestinal malignancy .
case 1 explores the diagnosis and surgical intervention of a 66 - year - old male patient synchronously diagnosed with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and a carcinoid tumor of the small bowel .
case 2 describes the diagnosis and surgical intervention of a 61 - year - old male found to have clear cell renal cell carcinoma and a mucinous appendiceal neoplasm .
lastly , case 3 focuses on the interventions and management of a 36 - year - old female diagnosed with synchronous clear cell renal carcinoma and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer .
this case series examines each distinct patient 's presentation , discusses the diagnosis , and compares and contrasts the findings while discussing the literature on this topic .
1. introduction renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) is the most common neoplasm of the kidney , affecting 15.5 people per 100,000 men and women each year and accounting for only 3.8 % of new cancer cases diagnosed annually in the united states [ 1 ] .
while much more uncommon , the number of new cases of small bowel malignancies accounts for 2.1 per 100,000 men and women , with an overall incidence less than 1 % of all primary cancers .
colorectal cancer accounts for the majority of diagnosed gastrointestinal cancers , with an incidence of 43.7 people per 100,000 men and women each year and accounting for 8.2 % of total cancer cases diagnosed each year [ 1 , 2 ] .
although the occurrence of each malignancy is relatively low , the incidence of rcc and gastrointestinal malignancy , whether small bowel or colorectal , occurring simultaneously is undoubtedly rare [ 3 - 7 ] .
the purpose of this case series is to describe three unique patients who presented with synchronous rcc and distinct gastrointestinal neoplasms and to discuss the literature on this topic .
this discussion utilizes the warren and gates definition to identify synchronous tumors : each tumor must present with a definite picture of malignancy , each must be distinct , and the possibility that one is a metastasis of the other must be excluded [ 8 ] .
the etiology and pathogenesis of synchronous tumors have yet to be fully understood , although some hypothesize that concurrent tumors can arise from tissues with similar embryological origins .
this may occur when these tissues are simultaneously affected by factors like carcinogens , such as tobacco and alcohol ; hormones ; genetic alterations ; chemotherapy treatment ; or radiotherapy [ 7 ] .
it has been well reported that rcc is associated with other primary malignancies , including prostate , bladder , and rectal cancers , as well as non - hodgkin 's lymphoma [ 9 ] .
we report three distinct cases of synchronous rcc and gastrointestinal cancer treated in our institution , specifically synchronous rcc and carcinoid tumor ( case 1 ) , rcc and appendiceal mucinous neoplasm ( case 2 ) , and rcc and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( case 3 ) .
2. case presentations 2.1 .
case 1 : rcc + carcinoid tumor a 66 - year - old man presented to the clinic with a history of acute onset right lower quadrant abdominal pain , hematuria , and flank pain .
general physical examination revealed no significant findings .
the patient 's family history revealed his mother had both thyroid and colon cancer , though the details of each were unknown .
initial laboratory findings included mild iron deficiency anemia with elevated white blood cell count , increased bun and creatinine , and a urine analysis positive for blood and protein .
abdominal ct scan revealed a hypervascular multilocular solid renal mass that had compromised gerota 's fascia and was occupying the right renal vein .
also noted on ct scan was an enhancing partially necrotic solid nodule within the left mesentery , as well as multiple diminutive ill - defined hepatic lesions .
the patient then underwent a right radical nephrectomy with tumor thrombectomy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection .
during intraoperative inspection of the mesenteric region , an ileal mass was encountered , and an en bloc resection was performed with primary anastomosis and ultrasound - guided liver biopsies .
evaluation of the nephrectomy specimen revealed a 7 cm fuhrman grade 2 clear cell rcc invading the renal vein with lymphovascular invasion and clear surgical margins without invasion of gerota 's fascia or the renal sinus ( t3an0m0 ) ( figure 1 ) .
the resected small bowel specimen demonstrated a 2.5 cm ileal mass with multiple foci of intermediate grade neuroendocrine carcinoma ( g2 with 12 mitoses per high - power field ) seen in figure 2 penetrating the serosal surface of the bowel with both lymphovascular and perineural invasion .
interestingly 2 / 15 mesenteric lymph nodes , 8 / 13 paracaval nodes , and 3 mesenteric nodules were positive for neuroendocrine carcinoma ( t4n1m0 ) .
liver biopsy revealed the presence of localized hemangiomas .
following successful resection of both tumors , his brain mri ; ct of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis ; and octreotide scan found no evidence of additional metastatic disease .
preoperative 24 - hour urine for 5 - hiaa was mildly elevated but postoperative repeat was normal .
the patient recovered well after surgery and continues to follow up regularly with no signs of reoccurrence in 20 months after surgery .
2.2 .
case 2 : rcc + mucinous appendiceal neoplasm a 61 - year - old man presented with constant dull right lower quadrant pain associated with fatigue and malaise .
initial ct scan showed an enlarged appendix and a partially exophytic , enhancing mass located in the upper pole of the left kidney with an enlarged para - aortic lymph node ( figure 3 ) .
the patient then underwent appendectomy ; pathology findings showed a low - grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm .
after recovery , the patient was then referred to the urology service for assessment and treatment of the left renal mass .
initial examination of the patient revealed an asymptomatic well - developed man .
besides a past medical history of hypertension , the patient was otherwise healthy .
upon physical examination , findings included bilaterally descended testes , left grade ii varicocele , and lack of lymphadenopathy or hernia .
the patient 's family history was insignificant .
the patient 's cbc and serum chemistry panel were normal .
urinary analysis found 3 rbcs per high - power field but was otherwise normal .
the patient then underwent left - sided robotic - assisted partial nephrectomy with para - aortic lymphadenectomy .
histological findings of the renal mass confirmed a 3 cm fuhrman grade 3 , clear cell rcc limited to the renal parenchyma with negative margins .
resection of lymph nodes revealed 0 / 6 perihilar and 1 / 14 para - aortic nodes with metastasis .
he was , therefore , staged as a t1an1m0 .
following removal of tumors , the patient recovered without complication .
a follow - up ct scan was performed four months postoperatively and showed no evidence of metastasis .
the patient is currently in good health and has no evidence of disease at four - month follow - up .
2.3 .
case 3 : rcc + hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer a 36 - year - old female initially presented for evaluation of a left supraclavicular neck mass .
the patient underwent fine needle aspiration of the mass , which revealed adenocarcinoma favoring renal cell .
ct scan of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis revealed a large left renal mass 9 cm in diameter .
the scan incidentally also detected a possible filling defect in the transverse colon .
the patient underwent colonoscopy , and a mass was visualized and biopsied .
histological examination found the mass to be positive for invasive adenocarcinoma .
physical examination of the patient revealed an overweight woman with a past medical history of hypertension .
the patient denied any changes in bowel habits or urinary complaints other than intermittent left flank pain .
the patient reported that her family history was negative for cancer or polyps .
general physical examination revealed a small nodule palpable in the left supraclavicular region of the patient 's neck .
laboratory findings were normal except for presence of iron deficiency anemia .
the patient then underwent left radical nephrectomy with periaortic lymphadenectomy and extended right hemicolectomy .
histological examination of the left kidney confirmed a 7.5 cm fuhrman grade 4 , clear cell rcc limited within gerota 's fascia with no lymphovascular invasion .
the tumor was present in 5 / 5 periaortic lymph nodes that were resected ( t2an1mx ) .
the resected large bowel specimens demonstrated tubular adenoma present in the cecum and hepatic flexure ; also noted was moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma extending into the submucosa of the transverse colon ( t1n0m0 ) ( figure 4 ) .
microsatellite instability staining was ordered ; results were positive for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( hnpcc ) .
given this patient 's negative family history of colon cancer , this was likely a spontaneous mutation .
the patient developed chylous ascites and peritonitis with acute kidney injury postoperatively and returned to the operating room for evacuation of fluid and ileostomy placement .
she eventually recovered following a cardiac diet ( low fat , low cholesterol , and high protein ) with peritoneal drainage and octreotide .
she was started on sunitinib postoperatively but failed therapy after developing bilateral malignant pleural effusion and malignant disease progression and was subsequently given temsirolimus .
after one month , postoperative ct scan revealed local recurrence in the kidney bed , suggesting highly aggressive cancer .
imaging also found enhancing enlarged supraclavicular lymph nodes extending cranially along the jugular chain and caudally into the mediastinum .
this finding was strongly suggestive of metastatic disease .
pet scan was performed and confirmed diffuse nodal metastasis throughout the thorax and neck .
she then underwent chest wall biopsy and pleurodesis using video - assisted thoracoscopic surgery , the results of which confirmed malignant rcc .
the patient died approximately one year following initial resection .
3. discussion the occurrence of synchronous malignancies has been well established in the literature .
in the case of rcc , multiple primary malignancies associated with this neoplasm have been the focus of many studies within the past decade .
beisland et al .
[ 3 ] used the national cancer registry of norway to determine the rates association of rcc in conjunction with other cancers .
they found the rate of multiple primary malignancies associated with rcc was 16.1 % , supporting previous studies that reported prostate , breast , colorectal , bladder , non - hodgkin 's lymphoma , and lung cancer to be the most common primary cancers in patients with rcc .
specifically they reported 3.7 % of those diagnosed with rcc had developed a synchronous tumor .
in the case of synchronous colorectal and rcc cancers , the incidence is widely varied .
capra et al .
[ 4 ] estimate 0.03 - 0.5 % and o'boyle and kemeny [ 6 ] report an incidence of 0.5 % , while halak et al .
[ 5 ] describe 4.85 % , though they admit this value probably does not reflect the true incidence .
regardless of actual incidence , it is clear that rcc is associated with a higher incidence of multiple primary malignancies .
the etiology and pathogenesis of multiple primary malignancies have yet to be explained .
it has been thought that interplay of genetic and environmental risk factors common to both cancers could cause multiple malignancies to arise .
common risk factors include tobacco , pollution , ultraviolet light , therapeutic chemotherapy and radiotherapy , and endocrine factors .
it is thought that these factors may act individually or in combination [ 10 ] .
interestingly however , a previous study reported synchronous renal and colon malignancies unrelated to hereditary factors [ 6 ] .
considering the three cases presented , each patient did not smoke and had no prior medical illness that could point to a common risk factor .
the patient presented in case 1 reported a family history of thyroid and colon cancer .
a possible underlying genetic variation may have been present , although no genetic testing was performed on either the first or the second patient presented .
the third case discussed demonstrates a well - established genetic predisposing factor .
individuals with hnpcc are known to have various mismatch repair genes that are functionally affected , with patients having 80 % lifetime risk of developing colon cancer [ 11 ] , as well as an increased risk of developing extracolonic tumors , including endometrial , ovarian , ureteral , and renal cancers [ 12 ] .
these latter patients who also develop extracolonic manifestations in addition to colorectal cancer , such as the patient in case 3 , are a specific subset of hnpcc patients referred to as having lynch syndrome ii. these patients are distinct from those with lynch syndrome i , whose disposition to develop malignancies is limited to the colon .
differentiating between the two syndromes is often difficult as there is no difference with respect to sex , age , occurrence , progression , or the site distribution of cancer in the colon .
both lynch syndromes i and ii are characterized by an autosomal dominant tendency to develop multiple primary colonic malignancies early in life , with the distinction separating the subtypes relying on the presence or lack of extracolonic features [ 13 ] .
given this knowledge , papalampros et al .
[ 7 ] suggest microsatellite instability testing could be applied to all patients with colorectal and urological cancers to assist in detecting a common genetic aberration between malignancies .
further studies with this focus may be an initial building block in the bridge between rcc and the demonstrated association with primary colorectal malignancies .
a common finding among the three clinical cases presented was that , in each case , the renal malignancy was aggressive clear cell rcc .
this may be a coincidental finding , as clear cell is the most common form of rcc [ 14 ] .
others have reported that patients with either papillary rcc or chromophobe rcc are more likely to have secondary colon cancer compared to patients with clear cell rcc ; however , the literature lacks information regarding the histological subtype of rcc and synchronous gastrointestinal tumors [ 15 ] .
another common finding among the three cases was that the rcc was incidentally found on ct scan .
this reflects the wide use of diagnostic imaging as part of the standard of care utilized when evaluating patients. through this report , we acknowledge and affirm the findings of halak et al .
[ 5 ] , who described the use of preoperative imaging studies as an invaluable tool for detecting synchronous asymptomatic renal lesions in patients with colorectal cancer .
current guidelines by the american urological association regarding the management of clinical stage 1 renal masses lack an explicit recommendation for clinicians to be aware of the possibility of a secondary primary malignancy [ 16 ] .
however , based on this clinical case series and the literature considered , the presence of rcc with a synchronous primary neoplasm is a substantial clinical entity that should be acknowledged upon evaluation of such patients .
specifically in patients with rcc , we believe practicing physicians should have a heightened awareness of the risk of a simultaneous separate primary malignancy and approach patients' new concerns or symptoms with diligence .

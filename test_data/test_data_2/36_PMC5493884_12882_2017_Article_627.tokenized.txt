background critically ill patients requiring renal replacement therapy ( rrt ) are at risk of disease - related bleeding .
systemic heparinization should be avoided .
an69st , a polyethyleneimine - treated polyacrylonitrile ( an69 ) membrane hemofilter , can be primed with heparin , improving its local anticoagulative activity .
prolonged intermittent rrt ( pi - rrt ) is of shorter duration and cheaper , considered as an alternative to continuous rrt .
this study was performed to compare the success rate of anticoagulant - free pi - rrt using an69st versus an69 membrane hemofilter .
we also evaluated risk factors for filter clotting .
methods this crossover , double - blind , randomized study included patients requiring pi - rrt but at high bleeding risk treated with an69st and an69 hemo filters .
the success rate of rrt , filter lifespan and severity of filter clotting were compared between the hemo filters .
factors associated with the filter clotting risk were analyzed with a cox proportional hazards model .
results this study included 60 patients ( mean age , 68.1 +/ - 15.8 years ) .
thirty - three ( 55.0 %) patients were in the intensive care unit , 34 ( 56.8 %) had disease - related thrombocytopenia , and 14 ( 23.3 %) had local hemorrhagic diseases .
the success rate of pi - rrt with the an69st and an69 hemofilter was 51.7 % and 50.9 % , respectively ( p > 0.05 ) .
the mean pi - rrt duration was 543.1 +/ - 119.0 min in the completed sessions and 387.3 +/ - 140.8 min in the prematurely terminated sessions , without significant difference between an69st and an69 hemofilters .
cox regression analysis showed that age ( odds ratio [ or ] , 1.023 per year ) , platelet count ( or , 1.07 per 10 x 109 / l ) , hemoglobin concentration ( or , 1.035 per 1 g / l ) , and activated partial thromboplastin time ( aptt ; or , 0.973 per second ) were associated with a hemofilter clotting risk .
the an69st hemofilter lifespan was significantly prolonged averaging an extra 251.7 min in patients with an aptt of < 35.3 s , hemoglobin concentration of > 83 g / l and platelet count of < 70 x 109 / l. conclusions anticoagulant - free pi - rrt by a heparin - primed an69st hemofilter reached a 51.7 % success rate .
the risk of premature clotting of the extracorporeal circuit remains unsatisfactory .
for select patients at high risk of bleeding , the heparin - primed an69st hemofilter may be more appropriate for anticoagulation - free pi - rrt .

release date 01 / 21 / 2015 keywords anticoagulant - free surface - treated polyacrylonitrile membrane hemofilter polyethyleneimine prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background systemic anticoagulation is necessary in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy ( crrt ) to avoid premature termination and low efficacy of blood purification due to clotting of the extracorporeal circuit including hemofilter [ 1 , 2 ] .
either unfractionated heparin or low - molecular - weight heparin can be injected intravenously to achieve systemic heparinization .
however , continuous heparinization exposes patients to an increased risk of bleeding , especially critically ill patients with coagulation disturbances .
management such as saline flushing or pre - dilution mode without heparin has long been considered unsatisfactory [ 3 , 4 ] , and is used to be performed instead of systemic heparinization for patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis .
for patients with acute kidney injury at high risk of bleeding requiring crrt , the kidney disease : improving global outcomes criteria recommend regional citrate anticoagulation ( rca ) .
however , this anticoagulation regimen increases the complexity of the operation and monitoring ; places patients at risk of disorders involving calcium , sodium , and acid - base imbalances ; and is also more costly because it requires additional nursing care [ 5 , 6 ] .
modification of the hemofilter to improve its biocompatibility and anticoagulant properties may be another simple and effective approach .
the an69st hemofilter is a surface - treated polyacrylonitrile ( an69 ) membrane hemofilter with a polyethyleneimine ( pei ) layer , allowing for incorporation of a heparin layer by priming the membrane in a heparin - saline solution before rrt , thereby reducing local thrombogenesis when compared with the original an69 membrane [ 7 , 8 ] .
heparin - primed an69st membranes have been successfully used in 4 - h dialysis and 6 - h extracorporeal circulation in previous studies [ 3 , 9 - 14 ] and are reportedly more biocompatible with advantages in terms of inflammatory cytokine adsorption [ 15 ] .
for patients receiving prolonged renal replacement therapy ( rrt ) , evidence regarding the use of a surface - treated membrane hemofilter is scarce .
prolonged intermittent rrt ( pi - rrt ) is an alternative to crrt with a shorter duration usually between 6 and 12 h [ 16 , 17 ] .
it is less costly and requires a lower dose of anticoagulants because of the shortened duration .
in this study , we tested the hypothesis that in critically ill patients requiring pi - rrt who were at risk of bleeding and cannot undergo systemic heparinization , performance of the an69st hemofilter primed with heparin for anticoagulant - free pi - rrt is more effective than use of the original an69 hemofilter .
methods patients the inclusion criteria for this study were an age of >= 18 years , requirement for pi - rrt , use of well - functioning double - lumen catheters providing a dialysis blood flow rate of 150 ml / min , and the presence of a bleeding risk contraindicating the use of continuous heparinization during rrt .
patients undergoing treatment with oral antiplatelet drugs or injectable low - molecular - weight heparin were excluded from this study .
the other exclusion criteria were an expected survival time of < 72 h , extremely unstable vital signs such as a low blood pressure that was unresponsive to fluid therapy and vasopressors , pregnancy , and heparin allergy .
filter membrane and pretreatment before rrt the an69st hemofilter is a pei - treated an69 membrane with a surface area of 1.3 m2 ( surface - treated multiflow 100 , hollow - fiber 1.3 m2 ; gambro - hospal , meyzieu , france ) .
the second pei - layer is able to be primed with a third heparin layer in a heparin - saline solution .
the an69 hemofilter is an an69 membrane with a surface area of 1.3 m2 ( multiflow 100 , hollow - fiber 1.3 m2 ; gambro - hospal ) .
both hemofilters were primed with heparin saline ( unfractionated heparin , 50 mg / 6250 units / l ) at 100 ml / min for 10 min in an open - loop circuit .
after circulation , the heparin saline was flushed out of the hemofilter and circuit tubes prior to starting pi - rrt .
study design this was an interventional , crossover , double - blind , randomized , self - controlled trial .
the study was conducted according to national regulations and was approved by the local ethics committee ( https :// www.clinicaltrials.gov id : nct02355873 ) .
all patients provided written informed consent before enrollment .
all patients underwent two successive sessions of pi - rrt with an an69st and an an69 hemofilter .
the order of the sessions was randomized using a random number table , followed by crossover to the other type of hemofilter .
all numbers were placed in envelopes to ensure double - blinding .
after a wash - out interval of 10 h , the patients were switched to the second session with the alternative hemofilter .
the study flowchart is shown in fig. 1. fig. 1 flowchart of the study pi - rrt strategy the double - lumen catheters were placed into the jugular or femoral vein before pi - rrt .
the catheter lock concentration of heparin was 10 mg / l. all patients underwent continuous venovenous hemofiltration ( cvvhf ) with a substitution flow rate of 3000 ml / h in mixed - dilution mode ( pre - dilution , 2000 ml / h ; post - dilution , 1000 ml / h ) .
the blood flow rate was maintained at 180 to 250 ml / min .
the ultrafiltration rate was set according to each patient 's scheduled dehydration goal .
all parameters were maintained within subgroups of patients who controlled their own hemofiltration protocols .
the prismaflex system ( gambro ) was used in the present study .
no anticoagulant was used during any of the pi - rrt procedures .
during pi - rrt , occlusion of the hemofilter or venous bubble trap may result in circuit clotting .
a clotting event was defined as a transmembrane pressure of > 280 mmhg and / or a circuit venous pressure increase of > 300 mmhg without a vascular access problem or blood clotting of the venous bubble trap .
the number of pi - rrt sessions that were stopped early was recorded .
the hemofilters were inspected at the end of each pi - rrt session .
filter clotting was graded as 0 ( normal ) , 1 ( blood stripes in < 5 % of the fibers ) , 2 ( blood stripes in 5 % - 50 % of the fibers ) , or 3 ( blood stripes in > 50 % of the fibers ) .
adverse events and the actual duration of each session were also recorded .
study outcomes and statistical methods the sample size was calculated according to the following hypotheses .
because no previous data have been reported , we conducted a preliminary experiment in four patients .
the expected success rate of pi - rrt sessions with circuit clotting was 50 % for both filters .
the median difference in the duration of pi - rrt between the an69st and an69 membrane hemofilters was 110 min .
thus , we estimated that in the best scenario of pi - rrt without heparin , the expected extension of the duration of pi - rrt by the an69st hemofilter was 60 min .
the square root of within mean square error was set at between 100 and 130 min .
the two - sided statistically significant level and study power were 5 % and 80 % , respectively .
we used the " tests for the two means in a 2 by 2 cross - over design " procedure in the pass software ( version11.0 , ncss , llc. kaysville , utah , usa ) to calculate the sample size .
thus , 46 - 76 subjects were needed based on the above mentioned parameters .
we ultimately set the sample size at 60 subjects. and the number of sessions to be performed was 120 .
we evaluated the actual lifetimes of the an69st and an69 hemofilters during heparin - free pi - rrt .
continuous variables are expressed as mean +/ - standard deviation .
differences of lifetimes between the two hemofilters were compared using the self - matching student 's t - test .
the success rates of the an69 and an69st filters were compared , as were the filter clotting severity grades and adverse event rates .
differences in serum marker concentrations before and after pi - rrt using the an69st and an69 filters were also compared by paired t - tests .
the patients were pooled for cox proportional hazards regression analysis to determine the risk factors associated with the pi - rrt survival status .
covariates included age , sex , hemoglobin concentration , platelet count , and parameters associated with the coagulation process , including the prothrombin time ( pt ) and activated partial thromboplastin time ( aptt ) .
hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were also calculated .
a two - tailed p value of < 0.05 was considered significant .
all analyses were performed using spss software ( version 20.0 ; ibm corp. , armonk , ny ) .
results patients were recruited from february 2014 to october 2015 ; ultimately , 60 patients were included and provided informed consent .
all were critically ill with acute kidney injury ( aki ) , 38 ( 63.3 %) cases having a pre - existing chronic kidney injury , and 33 ( 55 %) of the patients were recruited from the intensive care unit .
the patients had life - threatening conditions including severe pneumonia ; acute coronary syndrome ; antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positive vasculitis ; systemic lupus erythematosus ; malignancies involving the intestine , rectum , pancreas , bladder , ureter , or pelvis ; and multiple myeloma .
eighteen ( 30.0 %) patients were receiving artificial respiratory support .
forty ( 66.7 %) patients had acute kidney injury , and others were diagnosed with aggravation of pre - existing chronic kidney disease .
altogether , 40 men and 20 women were enrolled , with a mean age of 68.1 +/ - 15.8 years. of the 60 patients , 34 ( 56.8 %) had disease - related thrombocytopenia ; 14 ( 23.3 %) had hemorrhagic diseases involving a local area , including gastrointestinal bleeding , cerebral hemorrhage , or diffuse alveoli hemorrhage ; and others were recovering from surgery .
sixty pairs of pi - rrt sessions were scheduled to continue for 8 to 12 h in each patient , mainly for relief of water overload and endotoxin accumulation .
the actual duration of each session was dependent upon the individual patient 's scheduled dehydration goal and adjusted to ensure comparative values within the an69st and an69 subgroups .
four pairs of intended pi - rrt sessions were incomplete because of sudden worsening of the patient condition ( the an69st session was not performed in one patient , and the an69 session was not performed in three patients ) .
the success rate of the heparin - free pi - rrt sessions with the an69st and an69 hemofilter was 51.7 % and 50.9 % respectively ( p > 0.05 ) .
the an69 subgroup had a 3.5 % occurrence rate of reported adverse events .
the pi - rrt sessions were completed as scheduled after a duration of 543.1 +/ - 119.0 min .
the remaining sessions continued for an average 387.3 +/ - 140.8 min and were terminated early .
there were no significant differences in the actual lifespans of the an69 and an69st hemofilters , in both the prematurely terminated ( 404.8 +/ - 142.0 vs. 366.9 +/ - 140.0 min , respectively ; p > 0.05 ) and successfully completed pi - rrt sessions ( 540.2 +/ - 117.8 vs. 546.2 +/ - 122.1 min , respectively ; p > 0.05 ) .
in the an69st group , grade 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 filter clotting occurred in 10.3 % , 17.2 % , 12.1 % , and 60.3 % of patients , respectively .
no significant differences were found when compared with the an69 group ( 5.5 % , 14.0 % , 17.5 % , and 63.2 % , respectively ) .
there was a low incidence of venous bubble trap occlusion in both groups ( an69st , 6.9 % ; an69 , 5.3 %) .
following the 56 prematurely terminated sessions , most filters ( n = 52 , 92.9 %) had grade 3 filter clotting .
only one session had to be stopped because of venous bubble trap occlusion with grade 2 hemofilter clotting .
these details are shown in tables 1 and 2 .

the early termination group showed a trend toward a higher hemoglobin concentration ( 82.0 vs. 89.0 g / l , p = 0.013 ) and platelet count ( 119.4 +/ - 92.5 vs. 138.4 +/ - 90.9 x 109 / l , p = 0.285 ) and a lower pt ( 13.1 vs. 16.5 s , p = 0.205 ) and aptt ( 35.2 vs. 41.5 s , p = 0.065 ) when compared with sessions that were completed on schedule .
premature termination resulted not only in inadequate dehydration ( average 0.6 kg less ) but also in lower and unsatisfactory clearance of urea ( 28.0 %) .
cox regression analysis showed that age ( odds ratio [ or ] , 1.023 per year ) , platelet count ( or , 1.07 per 10 x 109 / l ) , hemoglobin concentration ( or , 1.035 per 1 g / l ) , and aptt ( or , 0.973 per second ) were associated with a hemofilter clotting risk .
thus , the platelet count is the strongest risk factor associated with the filter lifespan .
the mean platelet count before pi - rrt was 126.4 +/ - 91.4 x 109 / l. the patients had a wide range of platelet counts from 6 to 538 x 109 / l. thrombocytopenia was mainly caused by hematologic malignancies such as myeloma and disease - related platelet consumption .
about one - third of patients ( n = 21 , 35.1 %) had a very low platelet count of < 70 x 109 / l. three patients ( 5 %) had disease - related thrombocytosis .
in a further analysis , the patients were equally divided into three groups according to their pre - rrt platelet count .
the kaplan - meier survival curves of the hemofilter lifespan in these groups are shown in fig. 2. the hemofilter lifespan was significantly prolonged in patients with a platelet count of < 70 x 109 / l ( p < 0.05 ) .
the pre - rrt hemoglobin concentration was 85.0 +/ - 14.8 g / l ( median , 83 g / l ) , but there was no significant difference between patients with a platelet count of > 70 and < 70 x 109 / l ( 85.1 +/ - 13.7 vs. 85.8 +/ - 16.6 g / l , respectively ; p = 0.804 ) , similar results were found for the aptt prior to pi - rrt ( 37.5 +/ - 13.1 vs. 41.2 +/ - 23.8 s , respectively ; p = 0.291 ) .
roughly half of patients had an aptt longer than the local reference value of 35.3 s. as shown in table 3 , subsequent analysis revealed a significantly prolonged an69st hemofilter lifespan in patients with a normal aptt of < 35.3 s , hemoglobin concentration of > 83 g / l , and platelet count of < 70 x 109 / l ( extension of 251.7 min ) .
we further compared the pre - rrt aptt level with that of post - rrt by paired t - test .
no significant difference was observed ( 38.8 +/ - 17.4 vs. 36.5 +/ - 20.3 s , p > 0.05 ) .
it is similar with that of pt , platelet count and hemoglobin. fig. 2 risk of early termination of prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy according to platelet level .

no adverse events occurred in the an69st group .
a 5.3 % incidence of adverse events occurred during the pi - rrt sessions in the an69 group ( muscle shaking in one patient and sudden low blood pressure of unknown origin in two patients ) .
discussion rrt is of great importance in the supportive care of critically ill patients , who differ markedly from patients receiving routine hemodialysis therapy .
anticoagulants are key to preventing extracorporeal circuit thrombosis throughout the entire rrt process [ 1 , 2 ] .
however , anticoagulation can cause serious hemorrhagic complications in patients at high risk of bleeding .
premature circuit clotting also leads to unacceptable treatment failure .
the pei - binding an69 membrane hemofilter described in this report is a surface - treated an69 membrane .
the second pei - layer reduces the net negative charge of the membrane , enhances membrane polarity and lowers the repulsive force. by rinsing in unfractionated heparin saline , the membrane is primed with a heparin layer , which reduces membrane thrombogenicity [ 7 , 8 ] .
previous studies have reported successful heparin - free extracorporeal circulation with the an69st filter for a maximum 6 h. however in the hepzero study [ 10 , 12 ] reported by laville m et al. , the risk of premature clotting during 4 - h hemodialysis reached more than 30 % by use of a heparin - coated dialyzer , although it resulted in a higher success rate when compared with standard heparin - free hemodialysis ( 68.5 % vs. 50.4 % , respectively ) .
similarly in the present prospective , randomized self - controlled study , pi - rrt was completed for a duration of 543.1 +/ - 119.0 min in only 51.7 % of patients using an an69st hemofilter .
we should be aware that the risk of premature clotting of the extracorporeal circuit with either filter remains unsatisfactorily high .
overall , an69st hemofilter had no superiority over an69 hemofilter in this study .
however , the coagulation disorders of critically ill patients are complicated besides anticoagulation strategies .
such disorders involve multiple factors associated with either clotting or bleeding .
many factors contribute to the patient 's bleeding risk and the success of extracorporeal circulation , including the disease - associated disorders such as an elevated sequential organ failure assessment score , mechanical ventilation , heart failure with fluid overload ; an elevated ionized calcium concentration , an elevated platelet count and fibrinogen concentration , red cell transfusion , platelet factor 4 antibodies , concomitant therapies such as antiplatelet drugs ; biocompatibility of the filter membranes , vascular access , and medical staff - related factors [ 18 ] .
our findings in the present study re - emphasize the marked influence of an elevated platelet count and hemoglobin concentration on filter clotting .
unfractionated heparin plays a role in anticoagulation by enhancing antithrombin iii activity , inhibiting conversion from fibrinogen to fibrin and aggregation of red blood cells .
its anticoagulative effect is usually monitored by aptt level .
the heparin primed on the an69st filter membrane surface likely reduces local thrombogenesis in a similar manner .
the heparin - primed an69st hemofilter has limited anticoagulant ability and lifespan , depending on the amount of heparin primed and the degree of heparin shedding from the membrane [ 19 ] .
for patients with an increased aptt before rrt , which indicating the occurrence of disease - related coagulation disorder , locally primed heparin will have little effect on further prolongation of the filter lifespan .
in cases with severe anemia , the inhibition of rbc aggregation against fibrin formation by use of heparin , would also be weakened .
thus , when regrouping patients according to the aptt , hemoglobin concentration and platelet count ( aptt < 35.3 s , median hemoglobin concentration > 83 g / l , and platelet count < 70 x 109 / l ) , we found a significant difference between the paired an69st and an69 membranes , with an extra 251.7 - min extension using the an69st hemofilter .
in fact , the result of present study does not contradict with previous reports .
another crossover study also reported that an69st membrane filter did not prolong filter survival during anticoagulant - free cvvhf [ 20 ] .
the difference is that a majority of subjects received anti - platelet drugs ( 20.5 %) and a daily 20 - mg dose of enoxaparin ( 66.7 %) in schetz m 's study , thus the mean survival times of both an69st and an69 hemofilters were satisfactory ( 14.2 and 13.3 h , respectively ) .
additionally , the mean platelet count was 93 x 109 / l ( range , 52 - 197 x 109 / l ) , which was lower than that in the present study ( 126.4 +/ - 91.4 x 109 / l ; range , 6 - 538 x 109 / l ) ; notably , the platelet count was considered the strongest risk factor for filter clotting ( or , 1.07 per 10x 109 / l ; p < 0.05 ) .
use of the original an69 filter in rrt was historically associated with increased hypersensitivity reactions due to bradykinin release [ 21 - 23 ] .
coating the an69 membrane with pei did not alter its biocompatibility but reductions in the kallikrein activity and bradykinin concentration were observed , and no hypersensitivity reactions were reported when an69 membranes were changed to an69st membranes [ 24 - 26 ] .
this finding was confirmed in the present study .
moreover , no patient experienced a severe hemorrhagic incident .
pi - rrt serves as a transition therapy from crrt to maintenance hemodialysis because of its shorter duration .
it is being prescribed as primary therapy at a higher frequency than in the past .
marshall et al .
[ 16 ] presented mortality data from three intensive care units in different countries and found that switching of the predominant therapeutic approach from crrt to pi - rrt was not associated with any changes in the mortality rate .
basing on results of our study , an69st hemofilter might yet be regarded an alternative choice to rca for pi - rrt in patients with a high bleeding risk although it is relatively inferior [ 27 ] .
in sepsis , the an69st membrane is also recommended because of its superior cytokine - adsorptive property and ability to provide continuous 8 - h therapy until the filter change .
the present study has some important limitations .
although this was a real - world study of patients undergoing pi - rrt , the number of patients in whom superiority of an69st was shown was limited because of the low statistical power .
the pre - set washout period was not long enough for the next pi - rrt .
we unfortunately did not collect time series data of aptt during rrt , no detailed information about heparin - shedding could be provided .
but in previous study , a transient increase in aptt was observed shortly after initiation of hemodialysis , suggesting heparin shedding from the tubing and membrane [ 19 ] , that might shorten the actual filter lifespan .
thus an upgrade filter grafted with heparin during manufacturing process is preferred because of its strong stability .
therefore , further studies are necessary .
however heparin - coated filter is not available to clinical trial in china yet .
additionally , it is important to precisely estimate the coagulation status in an entity before decision of either anticoagulation strategies [ 28 ] , and proper risk grading is needed .
conclusions in conclusion , anticoagulant - free pi - rrt using a heparin - primed an69st hemofilter reached a success rate of 51.7 % .
however , the risk of premature clotting of the extracorporeal circuit remained unsatisfactorily high .
the platelet count and hemoglobin concentration were strong risk factors associated with filter clotting .
for select patients , the an69st hemofilter may be a more appropriate choice than the original an69 filter .

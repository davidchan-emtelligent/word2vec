a comprehensive profiling of the tumor landscape is however still required and will help to explain how for this cancer , the high densities of infiltrating cd8 + t cells have previously been correlated with a poor clinical outcome .
studies analyzing the tumor immunome often examine gene expression from the complete specimen , which is an overlap of expression profiles from the many different cell types from this microenvironment , and which may make results difficult to interpret .
therefore , we aimed to profile and validate the gene expression signatures from individual cd4 + and cd8 + immune cell subsets isolated from freshly resected ccrcc patient tumors and blood for their comparison to those from normal kidney tissues and blood , respectively .
experimental methods cd4 + and cd8 + t lymphocytes were isolated from blood and freshly resected tissues , and rna was subjected to microarray analysis .
gene expression from a number of resulting targets of interest ( immune checkpoints , transcription factors , cytokine / chemokines and receptors , signaling molecules and cytotoxicity markers ) were validated using qpcr with the hd biomark allowing coexpression analysis .
multi - parametric flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were then used to validate the coexpression of immune checkpoint modulators - the coexpression of which was also estimated using survival plots generated from the cancer genome atlas ( tcga ) to provide prognostic relevance to our findings .
results , conclusions and perspectives our findings reveal a differential expression profile of many genes , including immune checkpoint controllers , between the cd4 + and cd8 + t cells isolated from patient tumors and blood relative to normal kidney tissues and normal donor blood .
our four different sources of t cell isolation allows the discrimination of the differential expression of genes as a function of the disease rather than that of anatomical location .
our work may explain why a high infiltrate of cd8 + t cells in ccrcc has been associated to poor clinical outcome , reveal the mechanisms by which this might occur , and provide new strategies for immune checkpoint blockade therapies .

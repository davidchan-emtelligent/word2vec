however , there are few studies on evaluating the prevalence of asa hypersensitivity in patients with nasal polyps ( nps ) , using the oral aspirin challenge test .
this study was designed to determine the frequency of asa hypersensitivity and factors associated with asa hypersensitivity in patients with crswnp .
methods eighty iranian patients ( 43 women and 37 men ) with crswnp were enrolled in this study .
extension of nps was evaluated by endoscopic examination .
a single day , oral aspirin challenge ( oac ) was used to detect asa hypersensitivity .
atopic evaluation was performed , using skin prick test , nasal smear , blood eosinophil count , and serum total ige .
results oac was performed in all patients ( mean age : 38.9 +/ - 10.7 years ) .
oac resulted positive in 39 patients ( 48.8 %) ; among them 14 ( 35.8 %) had history of asa hypersensitivity , while 2 patients ( 12.5 %) with positive history were negative through oac .
concomitant asthma , pervious polyp surgery , high polyp score and asa hypersensitivity history were all associated with positive oac ( p < 0.05 ) .
presence of aerd was not associated with age , stage of asthma , blood eosinophilia , nasal smear eosinophilia and atopy .
conclusion asa hypersensitivity is quite common in patients with crswnp .
patients at risk for aerd require evaluation for the presence of asa hypersensitivity with asa provocation challenge test to confirm the diagnosis .

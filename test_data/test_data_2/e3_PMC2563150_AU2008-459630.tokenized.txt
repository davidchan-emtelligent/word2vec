we present a retrospective review of the scientific and clinical advances , extending over four decades , which have linked vesicoureteral reflux , with renal injury , and urinary tract infection .
we have traced the original studies , coupled with advances in technology which led to the awareness , and ability to detect and diagnose the problems early in childhood .
these advances progressed through clinical studies which defined the epidemiology of both reflux and urinary tract infection .
along with these diagnostic advances , there were numerous surgical developments , which allowed progressive improvements in the outcomes and effectiveness of a variety of treatment modalities .
all of this literature leads us to the current era , when several clinical trials are currently underway in an effort to more fully define the most efficacious and safe methods to treat vesicoureteral reflux and associated urinary tract infection .
vesicoureteral reflux may have been the major catalyst for the development of the subspecialty of pediatric urology , now approaching a milestone in north america , with the soon - to - be awarding of a certificate of special competence .
how did this happen ?
in the first textbook of urology in childhood , 1974 , dr. innes williams included a chapter on reflux , in which his opening sentence states " the problem of reflux has occasioned more controversy than any other topic in pediatric urology " [ 1 ] .
i submit in writing this article the view that this situation has changed very little to this day , more than 30 years later .
reflux was recognized very early , as an abnormal function of the ureterovesical junction , but it was hutch who recognized it in association with neurogenic bladder , in the spinal injured patients , and who linked the reflux to the renal injury in those patients [ 2 ] .
reflux was subsequently demonstrated in some pediatric patients with uti , but there were several studies which showed that reflux was not present in normal infants .
these data were brought forward because of the ready availability of voiding cystourethrography - - we now assume that these studies are routine and customary - - whereas in 1960s and 1970s they were neither available technically , nor did many imagers have any of the facilities or skills that are now standard of care throughout the world .
the next milestone was the recognition that vesicoureteral reflux was associated with urinary tract infections , but also that it occurred as a primary defect in children .
prior principles had shown reflux to be associated with other congenital anomalies or defects such as neurogenic bladder .
hodson and edwards [ 3 ] described a relationship between urinary tract infections and reflux , and further investigators demonstrated this to be present in a significant number of children with recurrent pyelonephritis [ 4 ] .
these findings led physicians and surgeons to recognize the importance of uti as a cause of both pyelonephritis and as an extension of this to recognize relationship between chronic scarring and end - stage renal disease , and uti with reflux .
kunin ( 1970 ) published data showing the prevalence of uti in school - age children .
the scene was set for the imposition of two forms of therapy which emerged as the science of the day - - antibiotics for gram negative bacterial infections , and surgery for vesicoureteral reflux .
the 1970s witnessed the emergence of antibiotics , including aminioglycosides , chloramphenicol , and cephalosporins , which proved effective in the treatment of sepsis and pyelonephritis caused by gram negative organisms .
although one of these proved myelotoxic and was removed from use , the others continued to be employed more frequently , and further refinements both improved their efficacy and reduced their toxicity .
along with the readily available treatment modalities , the recognition of uti as an important cause of sepsis in the neonate and young infant became a more common diagnosis .
in this era , the differential diagnosis fever in an infant included meningitis which was much more common as a cause of fever and sepsis in infants' than is now the case .
thus , the subsequent investigation of uti , with personnel and equipment to carry out effective cystograms , led to the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux in increasing numbers .
parallel with the growing frequency of the diagnosis of reflux was a growing experience and expertise in the surgery of reflux .
politano and leadbetter [ 5 ] described an effective operative procedure which could achieve successful treatment with relatively minimal morbidity - - this became widely utilized in north america , while the lich gregoir extravesical techniques [ 6 ] were more widely used in europe .
following upon these successes , paquin [ 7 ] , glenn and anderson [ 8 ] , and finally cohen [ 9 ] improvements and modifications of ureteroneocystostomy are resulting in their wide utilization throughout the world in 1980s .
the aap section of urology was started in this period , and the specialty of pediatric urology emerged as a recognized specialty , dedicated to the treatment of children with congenital defects of the genitourinary system. dr. john duckett and a dedicated group of colleagues bridged the gap between pediatric urologists and pediatric nephrologists , in both europe and north america , to formulate a prospective study to test the hypothesis of the best treatment for vesicoureteral reflux .
the international reflux study was born and completed , with publications in 1992 , which answered some questions , but left many more unanswered .
it was apparent that surgical correction of reflux was feasible , safe , although inconsistent in the complication rates at varying centers .
similarly , it was apparent that reflux would resolve spontaneously .
thus , the most optimal treatment was uncertain .
the outcomes measured were primarily renal scarring , but other features of the " disease " became more confusing - - was the renal scarring pre - existent , or solely the result of the reflux , or of the uti ?
although dysfunctional voiding was an exclusion factor , the study concluded that 15 % of children did have dysfunctional voiding. was this now to play a part in the treatment of the recurring utis ? was the reflux actually a factor in the utis , since even after the correction of reflux , persistence of utis occurred ?
many questions were answered , but many more remained .
in this era of excitement and involvement in the international reflux study , a new player emerged as o'donnell and puri [ 10 ] published data in 1984 , showing that the cystoscopic injection of teflon paste into the subureteric space could result in the resolution of vesicoureteral reflux .
following the rapid popularization of this technique , mainly in europe , it was disclosed by researchers in usa [ 11 ] that teflon could potentially be absorbed , and migrate to other areas of the body , including the brain and lymphatics .
these data , combined with speculation and fear that leaked teflon , leaked from prosthetic implants could be a potential cause of autoimmune disease , led the federal authorities in usa to insure that the subureteric injection of teflon would not be approved in north america .
nonetheless , a new debate had been born , centered on the child with uti and vesicoureteral reflux .
at meetings , becoming more populated with well trained and proficient pediatric urologists from around the world , debates became heated , stimulating , and amusing .
three of our greatest leaders , each a proponent of either open surgical correction , observational treatment alone or subureteric injection ( duckett , ransley , o'donnell ) , led the assemblies in ever increasing circles of confusion and varied convictions .
two new pieces of data were added to the continuing puzzle ; the emergence of antenatal ultrasound , which showed hydronephrosis in up to 1 % of fetuses , and the publication by noe [ 12 ] , that vesicoureteral reflux could be shown in up to 25 % of siblings who were diagnosed with reflux .
the groups of children with reflux diagnosed on the basis of either antenatal hydronephrosis and subsequently diagnosed reflux ( 20 % of those with hydronephrosis ) , and also those diagnosed on the basis of sibling screening led to an ever increasing population of children with reflux .
perhaps the latest piece of the technology puzzle , was added by lackgren et al. , who published data on a newer substance , dextranomer / hyaluronic acid copolymer ( dx / ha ) [ 13 ] , which unlike other alternates to teflon , proved to be durable , effective , and safe .
it was approved for use in the usa and canada and is now widely utilized around the world .
antibiotic prophylaxis , the nonsurgical treatment modality used throughout all these decades as an alternate to surgical therapy , has now also come into dispute .
the emergence of resistant strains of gram negative bacteria is growing , and possibly based on the widespread generic use of many antibiotics , a global increase in methicillin resistant staph aureus ( mrsa ) is posing serious challenges to treatment of infants with sepsis .
a new multicenter trial is now opened for recruitment in the united states and canada ( rivur ) , funded by the niddk , which will randomize children , presenting with uti , and reflux between treatment with prophylactic antibiotics , and with observation alone [ 14 ] .
the primary end point is the recurrence of uti , with secondary end point being the development of renal scar .
a similar study is ongoing in france .
we have come full circle , starting with a new diagnosis - - reflux , previously unrecognized , which was assumed to be a cause of recurrent uti , and renal scarring , through three decades of evolving developments in technology and science showing a myriad of ways in which we could cure the reflux .
over 25 years ago , dr. jr woodard , a world leader of the time , stated " as one looks back over the last 30 years of reflux history , it is ironic that urologists have become so expert at its surgical correction before understanding much about its natural history and true clinical significance " [ 15 ] .
we now dwell in a world where we still question whether the reflux itself is the major problem , or just an easily diagnosed and treated cofactor .
hopefully , the rigors of current science , based on prospective and randomized data , will answer some of these ongoing questions and allow us to treat the children , whom we treat , with the best , safest , most cost - effective , and noninvasive methodologies available to achieve our health - related aims .
i believe these aims continue to be the effective treatment and prevention of uti and the prevention of renal injury .

background obesity and other nutrition - related chronic disease rates are high in american indian ( ai ) populations , and an urgent need exists to identify evidence - based strategies for prevention and treatment .
multi - level , multi - component ( mlmc ) interventions are needed , but there are significant knowledge gaps on how to deliver these types of interventions in low - income rural ai communities .
methods oprevent2 is a mlmc intervention targeting ai adults living in six rural reservations in new mexico and wisconsin .
aiming to prevent and reduce obesity in adults by working at multiple levels of the food and physical activity ( pa ) environments , oprevent2 focuses on evidence - based strategies known to increase access to , demand for , and consumption of healthier foods and beverages , and increase worksite and home - based opportunities for pa .
oprevent2 works to create systems - level change by partnering with tribal stakeholders , multiple levels of the food and pa environment ( food stores , worksites , schools ) , and the social environment ( children as change agents , families , social media ) .
extensive evaluation will be conducted at each level of the intervention to assess effectiveness via process and impact measures .
discussion novel aspects of oprevent2 include : active engagement with stakeholders at many levels ( policy , institutional , and at multiple levels of the food and pa system ) ; use of community - based strategies to engage policymakers and other key stakeholders ( community workshops , action committees ) ; emphasis on both the built environment ( intervening with retail food sources ) and the social environment .
this paper describes the design of the intervention and the evaluation plan of the oprevent2 .

the centers for disease control estimated that roughly two thirds of ai adults are overweight or obese [ 1 ] .
ai are more than 60 % more likely to be obese than non - hispanic whites [ 2 ] , and have highest rate of type 2 diabetes of any ethnic population in the u.s .
[ 3 , 4 ] .
ai adults are more than are twice as likely to be diagnosed with heart disease and coronary artery disease [ 5 ] , 1.3 times more likely to have high blood pressure , and 2.4 times more likely to have a stroke [ 6 ] .
there are multiple causes of higher chronic disease rates among ai communities .
most ai communities are rural , with a high proportion of households at or below the federal poverty level - - at the highest rate ( 28 %) of any ethnic group in the u.s .
[ 7 ] .
rural ai communities tend to have reduced access to paved roads , public transportation and retail food outlets , such as supermarkets .
the retail food sources that are present in ai communities tend to carry a limited range of foods [ 8 ] .
many ai communitie s are dependent on gas - station stores , which primarily stock energy dense , high fat , and high sodium items ( e.g. , sodas , chips , candy ) and rarely carry fresh produce .
even when on - reservation stores stock healthier foods , they tend to be at a higher price than unhealthy items [ 9 , 10 ] .
accessing affordable , high - quality healthy foods often requires off - reservation travel , and can easily be greater than 30 miles [ 8 ] .
the built environment , including land use patterns , is also associated with low physical activity ( pa ) levels [ 11 ] and can be particularly influential in ai communities where resources allocated to the development of recreation facilities and parks are severely limited .
physical inactivity is more prevalent among ai adults as compared to non - hispanic whites , and reports show that 72.8 % of ai or alaska native adults aged 18 years or older do not meet federal pa guidelines [ 12 ] .
several studies have also found low pa and decreased leisure time activity in ai populations [ 13 , 14 ] .
over the last decade , a number of studies have examined the development , implementation and evaluation of policy , systems and environmental changes at the local , state , and federal levels to promote active living and healthy eating [ 15 , 16 ] .
unfortunately , few policy strategies have focused on ai communities [ 8 , 17 ] .
many ais live in separate reservation - based communities with tribal sovereignty and are relatively unaffected by mainstream obesity prevention policies .
in areas where ais are impacted by national or regional legislation , these policy approaches may not be sufficiently tailored to the resource constraints , cultural values or tribal sovereignty of the ai community [ 8 ] .
as one example , the american indian healthy eating ( aihe ) project was one of the first studies to systematically explore with tribal leaders their potential to utilize policy , systems and environmental change to promote healthy eating .
tribe - driven strategies were developed based on formative research that integrated qualitative , spatial , and policy analyses [ 8 ] .
building on the momentum established through aihe , a capacity building project known as healthy , native north carolinians ( hnnc ) was undertaken .
the majority of the obesity prevention trials conducted in ai communities has centered on children in the school setting [ 18 - 20 ] .
most of these earlier trials had modest success in changing behavior , with no impact on obesity [ 21 , 22 ] .
despite the apparent success of these trials in changing the school food and pa environments , the community and household environments were unchanged , apparently reducing or even erasing overall health impact [ 21 , 23 , 24 ] .
in the past decade , multi - level , multicomponent ( mlmc ) interventions have sought to intervene in multiple settings - and to change multiple aspects of the food and pa environments - in an effort to enhance potential to have health impacts .
these studies include the successful shape up somerville ( sus ) and baltimore healthy eating zones ( bhez ) [ 25 , 26 ] trials aimed at reducing childhood obesity .
to date , only one mlmc trial has centered on reducing and preventing adult obesity in ai communities .
oprevent , the precursor to the current trial , was a pilot study that sought to reduce adult obesity in five ai communities .
oprevent was a mlmc trial that worked in food stores , worksites , schools and through community media .
the results of this trial were also modest , showing no impact on pa , and limited impacts on diet and psychosocial factors ( unpublished data ) .
no change in body mass inde x ( bmi ) was found .
limitations of this previous work include : lack of attention to policy , which is needed for sustainability ; lack of emphasis on pa ; and weaknesses in the delivery of the intervention , such that intensity and exposure were limited .
oprevent2 is a full - scale mlmc trial , aimed at adult obesity reduction and prevention in ai communities .
the oprevent2 intervention is guided by bandura 's social cognitive theory ( sct ) and bronfenbrenner 's social ecological model [ 27 , 28 ] .
sct and the social ecological model conceptualize the individual as situated within broad family , institutional , community and political networks that influence their perceptions , behavior , and ultimately , their health status ( fig. 1 ) .
psychosocial factors ( e.g. , knowledge , self - efficacy , behavioral intentions ) , social and interpersonal factors ( e.g. , family , peers ) , and physical - environmental factors ( e.g. , access to pa resources , food availability , price ) interact at various levels to shape health outcomes .
according to the social ecological model , these various levels and components operate as one interacting system within which information and resources flow bi - directionally from one level to another to influence health behaviors .
policy , institutional , and behavioral interventions have the potential to impact multiple levels of the food and pa environments. fig. 1 oprevent2 study conceptual framework oprevent2 seeks to develop and test a series of intervention strategies that will function at multiple levels .
it will be implemented in collaboration with tribal policymakers , school administrators and teachers , worksites , and retail food stores .
institutional level intervention components will promote healthy food and pa - related behaviors in order to influence the household ( e.g. , food purchasing , preparation , sedentary behavior ) and individual psychosocial factors and behaviors that will ultimately impact obesity .
methods / design the oprevent2 trial uses a stratified , group randomized study design , where six ai communities have been selected to serve as either intervention ( n = 3 ) or comparison ( n = 3 , delayed intervention ) areas .
two communities are located in the upper midwest , and four communities in the u.s. southwestern regions .
initially , 37 ai communities in both regions were contacted and invited to participate .
the six participating communities are those who have agreed to participate and provided approvals in the form of tribal / chapter resolutions , as well as school and health board approvals .
the research was approved by the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health institutional review board ( irb ) as well as the indian health service irb and the navajo nation human research review board .
written informed consent will be obtained for all participants in the impact evaluation .
formative research prior to the oprevent2 intervention in main trial communities , extensive formative research was conducted with two pilot ai communities : one in the midwest and one in the southwest region of the u.s. these communities are not oprevent2 main trial communities , though they have similar tribal affiliations and are based in similar regions as the main trial communities .
the formative research focused on identifying how environmental changes are made throughout the communities .
it also aimed to identify the facilitators and barriers these communities face in this process to identify ways to promote and support policy and environmental changes in the oprevent2 trial .
in - depth interviews , observations , and modified talking circles were conducted in each pilot community [ 29 ] .
key participants included : tribal policymakers , health staff , and community member health champions .
theoretical and snowball sampling were used to identify additional participants engaged in the policy and structural change development processes in each community .
following and concurrent to this formative research , a small pilot was conducted in each community , consisting of three community action committee meetings in each community .
participatory methods used in this pilot included talking circles , social mapping , and exploring environmental changes [ 30 ] .
community workshops the aim of the community workshops , which are currently underway , is to obtain in - depth input from the oprevent2 main trial community members regarding how to adapt previous oprevent intervention materials , and to define new materials / approaches that may be needed .
three different types of workshops are being conducted in each community : 1 ) community members focused on general intervention strategies and communications materials ; 2 ) teachers and other school personnel focused on the school program component , and 3 ) tribal leaders and health staff that will inform structural and policy changes possible in each community .
the research team will then review input and make final changes to the oprevent2 strategy and materials .
participants and recruitment the target group in the oprevent2 mlmc intervention is ai adults , ages 18 - 75 years .
participants in the evaluation sample will be randomly recruited from household lists provided by each tribe / community .
due to privacy concerns , in four of the communities , local authorities have agreed to provide us with randomly selected households .
once consent is received , interviews will be conducted with one person per household until 80 have been completed for each of the six communities .
potential participants will be screened for eligibility ( e.g. , tribal member , adult 18 - 75 years , no plans to move for next two years ) .
if a randomly selected household is unable to complete the interview , then the next eligible household will be selected from the recruitment list .
intervention the oprevent2 intervention will involve multiple components at many levels ( fig. 1 ) : policy , schools , fo od stores , worksites , and community media ( including social media ) .
each component of the oprevent2 program will reinforce several other components - either by improving access to or increasing demand for healthy foods and pa. the oprevent2 program will be implemented in six 2 - month phases , with each phase focusing on different foods , activities , and promotions .
policy - level approaches community action committees ( cac ) will be established within each community to identify and support structural and environmental changes , in partnership with community partners .
participation in the committee will be open to all community members , and recruitment will be done using mass media communication in each community .
health staff and tribal policymakers will also be invited to participate .
the recruitment goal of this committee will be to bring together participants who are already engaged in making environmental changes in the community - whether formally through health programs and health policy or informally by the actions of existing champions in the community .
forming relationships between stakeholders , aligning existing health programs to support environmental changes , and developing health policies will help to increase sustainability of the oprevent2 intervention and promote long - term environmental changes in each community .
this committee will meet monthly , and will work to support : sustainability of the oprevent2 program and critical reflection of the community environment and its role in shaping behavior , and community member interest in the health fields .
these meetings will be facilitated by an oprevent2 interventionist , who will also work to train a new facilitator in the community to enhance sustainability .
changing food access in community food stores our work with food sources will aim to increase access to healthier foods by working in all on - reservation stores that agree to participate .
a central strategy will be increasing the stocking and sales of affordable healthy food options at food stores .
for smaller , privately owned stores , we will provide gift cards to their wholesaler , enabling them to purchase a starter stock of promoted foods and beverages .
we will conduct promotional activities at the point of purchase , including shelf labels , posters , interactive sessions such as taste tests and cooking demonstrations , and the provision of flyers , booklets , small gifts and other promotional materials .
interactive sessions will occur at least once per week in each participating food store .
our intervention components at the food source level are based on previous small store interventions conducted in ai communities [ 31 , 32 ] with additional innovative pieces , including training videos to assist store owners / managers in stocking / marketing healthier foods .
increasing physical activity opportunities in worksites physical activity will be a primary focus of the oprevent2 intervention worksite component .
intervention materials for worksites will focus on educating community members on recommended type and duration of pa , making a plan and setting goals to exercise , including working out with a partner [ 33 - 35 ] , and fueling pa with proper nutrition .
educational materials , including posters , flyers , and educational displays , will be made available at worksites .
interventionists will make several visits to worksites to present on the health benefits of pa. the primary activity to promote pa in worksites will be a fitbit challenge .
employees within each worksite will be encouraged to register in teams for the challenge .
interventionists will distribute free fitbits to registered teams and provide teams with an orientation on proper use , including how to track and monitor their participation in the challenge .
interventionists will make weekly follow - up visits to each worksite to record daily and weekly steps for challenge participants .
the members of the team with the highest overall number of steps will be awarded each month with " team of the month " certificates .
at the end of the challenge , the final winning team will receive a free healthy lunch provided by oprevent2 .
the top three walkers from each oprevent2 community will be awarded a commemorative plaque .
school curriculum , developing native youth as household obesity change agents a school - to - family curriculum aimed at encouraging children to be household change agents will be a critical component of the oprevent2 project .
children influence adults in their households positively for healthier nutrition and pa related habits on multiple levels [ 36 - 41 ] .
school - based curricula have reported improved adult household members' food getting habits , reduced fat intake and consumption , increased fruit and vegetable consumption , and lower bmi .
in our precursor study , oprevent , we developed a unique , culturally relevant and sensitive school - based curriculum with the partnership of ai curriculum developers and artists for grades 2 - 6 .
the grades 2 - 4 curricula are comprised of weekly in - class curriculum materials that are tailored to each state 's education standards and an ai storybook .
the storybook highlights a poignant story of two young children who learn about healthy lifestyles from their cousin , the change agent in their life , and develops into change agents for their household .
the children travel and experience other tribal cultures , challenges , and strengths of each of the six ai communities participating in oprevent2 .
the grades 5 - 6 curriculum will adapt the " cooking with kids " tasting program [ 42 ] .
teachers in each school will be trained in the delivery of the curricula for their grade level , and will be provided with materials needed to implement the program in their classrooms .
community and social media community and social media will be an integral component of the oprevent2 intervention .
community media will be based on oprevent , which included use of newsletters and radio announcements within communities to spread intervention messages .
newsletters and radio announcements will be specific to each phase , and produced in the local native language and delivered by elders whenever possible .
in addition to promotion of intervention messages , we will work with tribal health staff to implement community - wide activities , including walking clubs and food store tours .
oprevent2 staff will attend existing community events such as health fairs , community meetings , school activities , and community walks to promote oprevent2 activities and to identify key community stakeholders for partnership .
study communities have a variety of local media , including local radio and cable access channels , bulletin boards , newsletters , and websites .
announcements through local media will be used to promote ongoing activities and products at schools and stores .
social media and online networks have the capacity to disseminate information widely while promoting social support and reshaping norms [ 43 , 44 ] .
the oprevent2 social media component will consist of facebook , instagram , and twitter platforms .
a social media working group has been formed to explore the best message content for each platform .
facebook and instagram messages will be focused on health information and current events pertinent to our population , such as common health issues and promotional activities in ai communities .
topics will range from exercises tips to healthy recipes incorporating traditional foods .
the primary focus of twitter will be to share recent research related to fitness and nutrition with other community stakeholders as well as with native tribes / communities .
content published on each platform will be promoted and boosted using tools built into each platform for this purpose ( e.g. , boosting of facebook posts , creation of twitter campaigns ) in an effort to increase followers and expand the reach of the intervention messages .
standards for intervention delivery , process evaluation intervention implementation at each level will be monitored through ongoing process evaluation , with the intention of assuring that set standards are being met ( table 1 ) .
these standards are based on our review of the literature , and on our previous experiences implementing mlmc interventions in ai communities .
the oprevent2 intervention team will meet every two months to review the degree to which intervention standards are being met , and will improve implementation on that basis .

the adult impact questionnaire ( aiq ) will assess the food getting frequency of our promoted products , household patterns of food acquisition and preparation , adult pa , morbidity history and sociodemographic variables ( e.g. , age , education , income range ) .
in addition , the aiq will evaluate psychosocial constructs including healthy food knowledge , self - efficacy , intentions about food , and community resources / environment .
the aiq instrument uses a modified individual physical activity questionnaire ( ipaq ) short form ( ipaq - sf ) .
the ipaq - sf specifically asks about walking , moderate - intensity pa , and vigorous - intensity pa. it was determined to be appropriate for this population and study for several reasons : validity studies have been conducted in similar populations ; low time burden it was easy to modify to be more culturally acceptable for our target population ; and it was piloted in the communities and found to be acceptable .
sociodemographic , family medical history and anthropometric measurements ( i.e. , height , weight , percent body fat , waist circumference , hip circumference , blood pressure , heart rate ) will be collected to assess obesity and other health - related factors .
we will be using tanita 300gs ( tanita corp. , tokyo , japan ) scales for body weight and percent body fat , and the omron fat loss monitor ( hbf - 306 ) will be used for a second percent body fat estimate .
blood pressure and heart rate will be measured using an omron automatic wrist blood pressure monitor , model # bp652 ( hem - 6052 - z ) , and will be assessed pre and post intervention in intervention and comparison respondents .
we worked with nutritionquest to develop a modified block food frequency questionnaire ( ffq ) specific to our study sample .
in addition to standard block ffq food items , it includes traditional ai foods common in the southwest and upper midwest regions , as well as specific food items promoted and de - promoted within our intervention .
the ffq was based on the ffq that was used in the strong heart study family study , cardiovascular disease in american indians ( phase v ) , an instrument used by investigators at the johns hopkins center for american indian health .
the ffq includes 95 questions pertaining to frequency and portion size of particular foods .
portion sizes will be estimated with the aid of standard portion size illustrations .
the final section of the ffq includes 24 questions pertaining to additions to food items ( e.g. , milk , creamer , etc .
to coffee ) and type of food items ( e.g. , low - fat , low - carb , etc. ) .
the ffq will be used to assess dietary intake pre and post intervention in intervention and comparison respondents .
at post intervention data collection , we will collect information on exposure to specific intervention components and materials for all participants which will be used to assess self - reported dose received by our evaluation sample .
a series of structured surveys will be conducted pre and post intervention in schools , food stores , and worksites to assess change at the level of these institutions in terms of the food and pa environments .
a community action component impact questionnaire will be administered to committee participants at their first meeting and at post intervention .
participant characteristics ( e.g. , age , occupation ) will be gathered , and the instrument will be used to gauge change in collective efficacy , intentions , as well as a free list of community changes and feedback of cac activities ( post intervention only ) .
data safety and confidentiality electronically collected data will be encrypted using secure sockets layer ( ssl ) encryption using redcap and will be upload to a server at johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health .
all data collectors received a unique user pin that are ciphered using secure hash algorithm ( sha ) cryptography , and all stored redcap data and redcap application logs are encrypted using advanced encryption standards on tablet pc until the data is uploaded .
a separate administrator username and password will prevent data collectors from altering the data and data collection instruments .
sample size and statistical methods sample size calculations were based on testing the change in mean bmi .
modeling and calculations were based on testing for an effect size d = | mu1 - mu2 |/ sigma = 0.5 , where mu1 is the mean change in one of the two primary outcome measurements in the treatment group , mu2 is the corresponding mean change in the control group , and sigma is the standard deviation of the observed differences .
the detectable difference (| mu1 - mu2 |) for the change in mean bmi and daily fv intake was determined using the impact data from oprevent and other interventions similar to oprevent2 .
we used oprevent baseline bmi data on 422 ai adults to estimate the standard deviation of the observed differences between pre and post intervention bmis , assuming that the variances of mean bmi from pre and post intervention are equal and assuming a large correlation between pre - and post - intervention measurements ( r = 0.9 ) .
we used data from a survey sample of ais in the midwest [ 45 ] to estimate the standard deviation of the observed differences in mean daily fv under the same assumptions .
for bmi , sigma = 3.5 and therefore the detectable change in average bmi is 1.3 kg / m2 .
for fv , sigma = 1.56 and therefore the detectable change in daily fv servings is 0.78 servings .
the power was obtained from a two - sample t - test formula beta = 1 - p ( t <= talpha / 2 ) + p ( t <= - talpha / 2 ) , where t is a non - central t - distribution with df = 2 ( 3 - 1 ) degrees of freedom and a non - centrality parameter nc = d /[ 2 { 1 + ( 85 - 1 ) rho }/( 3 * 85 )] 1 / 2 .
here rho is the within - community correlation between the differences between the primary outcomes .
calculations were based on a rho equal to 0.01 ; this value is consistent with the range of correlations reported in the literature [ 46 , 47 ] and the correlation for baseline bmi and fv found in oprevent .
all calculations were done assuming a 20 % loss to follow - up from pre to post data collection. with 80 participants per community and three communities per arm , there is 80 % power to detect an effect size of d = 0.5 ( which corresponds to a 1.3 kg / m2 change in mean bmi and a 0.78 change in mean daily fruit and vegetable consumption ) with a type i error of 5 % .
we will examine intervention effects by subtracting the pre intervention score / intake from post intervention score / intake and then conduct linear mixed - effect models for confirmatory testing of intervention effects .
we will conduct t - tests for normally distributed continuous variables and nonparametric wilcoxon - mann - whitney tests for non - normal continuous variables ; chi square and fisher 's exact tests for dichotomous variables ; and mantel trend tests for ordinal variables .
we will follow this exploratory analysis with multilevel mixed models using the lmer function from the lme4 package for r [ 48 ] .
linear and logistic regression models will be adopted for identifying intervention effects as well as risk factors in regression analyses .
we will examine multiple primary response variables , including specific indicators of dietary quality ( e.g. , fv servings , energy intake ) and of obesity ( e.g. bmi ) .
fixed effects of the model will be baseline values for these variables , treatment group , age , gender , ethnicity and mediating variables wherever applicable .
the community will be treated as a random effect .
discussion to our knowledge , oprevent2 will be one of only two mlmc obesity prevention intervention trials targeting ai adults .
substantial formative research and a community engagement process will be used to refine and develop intervention strategies and materials .
oprevent2 will be a unique trial that integrates stakeholders at multiple critical levels : policy , food retail , worksites , schools , and individual .
multiple components of the food and pa environments will be targeted , leading to improved exposure and reinforcement of key messages .
there will be an emphasis on social dimensions of the environment , involving social media and the use of children as change agents in the home .
detailed process and impact evaluations will occur at all intervention levels .
tribal leaders , tribal health staff , researchers , and public health practitioners will be greatly interested in oprevent2 program findings .
mlmc interventions are thought to be required to address the multifactorial causes of obesity , yet few of these large intervention trials have been successfully completed .
trials such as oprevent2 are required to see if mlmc approaches are indeed more successful , and how they should best be implemented .
one major strength of the oprevent2 program will be that it will provide a model of how to work with tribal policymakers and other key stakeholders to improve the community food and pa environments .
because of its prolonged and frequent engagement with policymakers and other community leaders , oprevent2 may lead to long - term impact , and be sustained through institutionalization of intervention components .

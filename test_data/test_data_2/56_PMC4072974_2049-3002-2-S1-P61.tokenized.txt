this metabolic alteration is primarily driven by disruptions in oncogenic or tumor suppressor function and ultimately results in glutamine dependency for tumor cell growth and survival .
accordingly , identification of small - molecule inhibitors targeting glutaminolysis3 may have utility as an anti - cancer therapeutic strategy .
troglitazone , a ppargamma agonist previously fda - approved in treating type ii diabetes , has been reported to suppress glutamine metabolism .
therefore , we examined whether troglitazone treatment could disrupt glutamine metabolism and proliferation in glutamine - dependent tumor cells .
materials and methods using glutamine - dependent hela cervical cancer , h460 lung cancer , and rb - triple knock - out mef cells , we characterized the effects of troglitazone treatment on : 1 ) cell viability , 2 ) glutamine metabolism by examining 14c - glutamine uptake , 13c - glutamine metabolomics , and atp determination , and 3 ) expression of asct2 , gls , and c - myc .
to determine a ppar requirement on these processes , sirna and pharmacological inhibition of ppar alpha or gamma was performed .
rescue experiments were done through simultaneous add - back of di - methyl alpha - ketoglutarate ( alpha - kg ) or expression of a c - myc phosphorylation mutant .
results troglitazone treatment resulted in a dose - dependent inhibition of cell proliferation and glutamine uptake that was accompanied by a decrease in asct2 and gls expression .
metabolomics analysis revealed a reduction in 13c - glutamine incorporation into aspartate and a decrease in steady - state atp levels , suggesting that troglitazone causes diminished glutamine anaplerosis within the tca .
silencing ppar alpha or gamma activity via sirna or a specific small molecule antagonist ( gw9662 ) did not alter troglitazone 's effects on cell proliferation or glutamine uptake suggesting that these processes are ppar - independent .
however , troglitazone caused a dose - dependent , proteasomal - mediated decrease in c - myc expression , while re - expression of a c - myc phosphorylation mutant partially rescued glutamine uptake , [ atp ] , and cell viability .
in addition , exogenous di - methyl alpha - kg also led to a partial rescue of atp and cell viability .
lastly , combinatorial treatment with metformin , which sensitizes cells to glutamine disruption , resulted in a synergistic decrease in cell viability .
conclusions taken together , troglitazone may exert its anti - tumor activity in part through disruption of glutamine metabolism in a ppar - independent manner .
in addition , characterizing new anti - tumor properties of previously approved fda therapies lends support to the possible repurposing of these agents , especially in combination with other targeted treatment strategies , such as metformin .

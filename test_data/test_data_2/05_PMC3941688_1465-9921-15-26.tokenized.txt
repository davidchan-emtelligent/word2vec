background mtor , which can form mtor complex 1 ( mtorc1 ) or mtor complex 2 ( mtorc2 ) depending on its binding partners , is frequently deregulated in the pulmonary neoplastic conditions and interstitial lung diseases of the patients treated with rapalogs .
in this study , we investigated the relationship between mtor signaling and epithelial mesenchymal transition ( emt ) by dissecting mtor pathways .
methods components of mtor signaling pathway were silenced by shrna in a panel of non - small cell lung cancer cell lines and protein expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers were evaluated by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry .
mrna level of the e - cadherin repressor complexes were evaluated by qrt - pcr .
results igf - 1 treatment decreased expression of the e - cadherin and rapamycin increased its expression , suggesting hyperactivation of mtor signaling relates to the loss of e - cadherin .
genetic ablation of rapamycin - insensitive companion of mtor ( rictor ) , a component of mtorc2 , did not influence e - cadherin expression , whereas genetic ablation of regulatory - associated protein of mtor ( raptor ) , a component of mtorc1 , led to a decrease in e - cadherin expression at the mrna level .
increased phosphorylation of akt at ser473 and gsk - 3beta at ser9 were observed in the raptor - silenced nsclc cells. of the e - cadherin repressor complexes tested , snail , zeb2 , and twist1 mrnas were elevated in raptor - silenced a549 cells , and zeb2 and twist1 mrnas were elevated in raptor - silenced h2009 cells .
these findings were recapitulated by treatment with the gsk - 3beta inhibitor , licl .
raptor knockdown a549 cells showed increased expression of n - cadherin and vimentin with mesenchymal phenotypic changes .
conclusions in conclusion , selective inhibition of mtorc1 leads to hyperactivation of the akt / gsk - 3beta pathway , inducing e - cadherin repressor complexes and emt .
these findings imply the existence of a feedback inhibition loop of mtorc1 onto mtorc2 that plays a role in the homeostasis of e - cadherin expression and emt , requiring caution in the clinical use of rapalog and selective mtorc1 inhibitors .
mtor mtorc1 mtorc2 e - cadherin repressor complexes raptor rictor emt background mtor , a serine / threonine protein kinase regulating cell growth and proliferation , transcription , and protein synthesis , is frequently hyperactivated in neoplastic conditions , tuberous sclerosis complexes ( tsc ) , and lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( lam ) [ 1 ] .
mtor combines with other proteins to form two different complexes , mtor complex 1 ( mtorc1 ) and mtorc2 .
mtorc1 comprises mtor , mlst8 / gbetal , regulatory - associated protein of mtor ( raptor ) , and pras40 , while mtorc2 is composed of mtor , mlst8 / gbetal , rapamycin - insensitive companion of mtor ( rictor ) , msin1 , and protor [ 2,3 ] .
mtorc1 is activated by various growth factors and nutrients , and phosphorylates ribosomal s6 kinase1 ( s6k1 ) and eif - 4e - binding proteins ( 4e - bp1 and 4e - bp2 ) , leading to translation initiation and protein synthesis .
mtorc2 regulates akt and serum / glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 ( sgk1 ) , controlling cell survival and proliferation [ 2,4 ] .
there are clinical evidences suggesting deregulation of the mtor pathway may be involved in the epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) .
lam , a rare disease characterized by functional loss of the tsc2 gene leading to aberrant hyperactivation of the mtor pathway , exhibits loss of e - cadherin expression and uncontrolled expression of smooth muscle actin , implying that the mtor pathway may be involved in emt [ 5 ] .
interstitial lung disease and nephritis , which are frequently observed during treatment with mtor inhibitors in solid organ transplant recipients and cancer patients , may be another clues indicating relationship between mtor pathway and emt ( figure 1a ) [ 6,7 ] .

two mechanisms of rapamycin - induced pneumonitis have been proposed : direct alveolar cytotoxicity and immune - mediated toxicity [ 6 ] .
the direct alveolar cytotoxicity hypothesis is based on the observation that the incidence of interstitial pneumonitis is dose - dependent , whereas the immune - mediated toxicity hypothesis is based on the wide range of time courses observed and the wide range of trough serum levels of rapamycin .
however , mechanistic explanations of these hypotheses are elusive .
detailed identification of the underlying mechanisms of mtor inhibitor - induced emt requires dissecting the inherent function of each mtor complex with analysis of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of mtor inhibitors .
one possible explanation relating emt and mtor pathway would be disruption of feedback regulation of akt by mtorc1 .
igf - 1 mediates upregulation of the e - cadherin transcriptional repressors , snail and slug , and pharmacologic inhibition of mtor inhibits igf - 1 - induced e - cadherin loss [ 8 ] .
akt is activated either by phosphorylation at thr 308 by phosphoinositide - dependent kinase 1 ( pdpk1 ) or at ser473 by mtorc2 [ 4 ] .
the feedback inhibition of akt by mtorc1 is mediated by destabilization of irs1 [ 9,10 ] or grb10 [ 11 ] .
mtor inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials against cancer and for management of lam , but the feedback activation of the pi3k - akt pathway , which occurs with mtorc1 inhibition , might had lessen their clinical utility [ 11 - 14 ] .
in this study , we sought to determine the effect of each mtorc on the expression of e - cadherin .
to achieve this , we selectively deleted raptor and rictor , the regulatory complexes of mtorc1 and mtorc2 , respectively .
decreased e - cadherin was observed in raptor - silenced cells whereas no change in e - cadherin was observed in rictor and tsc2 - silenced cells .
increased phosphorylation of akt and gsk - 3beta was observed in raptor - deleted cells leading to up - regulation of e - cadherin repressor complexes .
these findings suggest that selective inhibition of mtorc1 would lead to emt , which might be the underlying mechanism of intestinal pneumonitis and nephritis in patients treated with rapalogs .

cells transduced with plko.1 lentiviral vector were maintained in rpmi medium containing 5 % fetal bovine serum .
puromycin ( 1.0 mug / ml ) was added for a549 and h1650 cells , while concentrations of 2.0 mug / ml and 3.0 mug / ml were used for h460 and h1299 cells , respectively .
western blotting cells were harvested using 2x lsb lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail ( sigma , st. louis , mo , usa ) on ice .
after sonication , bca protein assay reagent ( thermo scientific , rockford , il , usa ) was used for protein quantification .
protein lysates ( 30 - 50 mug ) were separated by gel electrophoresis on 7.5 % to 12 % polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by western blot using nitrocellulose membranes ( bio - rad laboratories , inc. , richmond , ca , usa ) .
expression level of each protein was measured using imagej ( http :// imagej.nih.gov / ij /) and quantified relative to that of beta - actin .
immunocytochemistry 5 x 105 cells were plated in 6 - well plates containing a sterilized coverslip .
the next day , cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde in pbs , incubated in blocking solution containing 5 % bsa in pbs , and then anti - e - cadherin mouse ( 1:100 ) and anti - vimentin rabbit antibodies ( 1:200 ) were added for 16 hr. the next day , cells were washed and anti - mouse igg ( alexa fluor 555 conjugate ) and anti - rabbit igg ( alexa flour 488 conjugate , cell signaling technology ) secondary antibodies were added .

reverse transcription and quantitative pcr were performed using high capacity cdna reverse transcriptase and taqman ( r ) fastuniversal pcr master mix ( 2x ) , respectively .
qrt - pcr analysis was conducted using taqman ( r ) gene expression assay reagents , and the steponeplus real - time pcr system ( applied biosystems , carlsbad , ca , usa ) with an inventoried primer - probe set described in additional file 2 : table s2 .
ipo8 was amplified in a primer - limited fashion using primers labelled with vic dye as an endogenous control .
statistical analysis data were analyzed either by one - way anova followed by tukey 's multiple comparison test or an independent sample t - test .
all statistical analyses were two - tailed .
results involvement of the mtor pathway in the loss of e - cadherin expression during the recent 4 years , 16 ( 5.2 %) out of 305 patients , who had taken rapalogs under the diagnosis of either neoplastic diseases or solid organ recipient , experienced clinically apparent interstitial lung disease in the study institutes ( figure 1a and table 1 ) .
among them , 7 patients showed severe interstitial pneumonitis ( grade >= 3 ) .
the mean time to development of interstitial pneumonitis was 6.4 months ( 5.8 months for everolimus , 4.6 for temsirolimus , and 8.6 for rapamycin ) .
together with the loss of e - cadherin expression in the lam , development of interstitial pneumonitis during rapalogs treatment brought us a question whether aberration mtor signaling impacts the expression of e - cadherin and emt .
to explore this , a549 cells were treated igf - 1 and expression of e - cadherin was evaluated by immunoblotting .
treatment with igf - 1 decreased e - cadherin expression in time - and dose - dependent experiments , and e - cadherin expression was more dependent on time , reaching a nadir at 48 hr after igf - 1 treatment ( figure 1b and c ) .
there was a dose - dependent decrease in e - cadherin mrna with igf - 1 treatment , suggesting that the loss of e - cadherin occurred at the transcriptional level ( figure 1d ) .
next , nsclc cells were treated with rapamycin , an mtor inhibitor , and expression of e - cadherin was evaluated by immunoblotting .
treatment with rapamycin clearly increased e - cadherin protein and mrna expression ( figure 1e,f and g ) .
we also examined the effect rapamycin on the expression of other components of the adherens junction complex by immunoblotting .
inhibition of the mtor pathway with rapamycin increased expression of e - cadherin , beta - catenin , catenin - delta - 1 , and alpha - e - catenin ( figure 1g ) .
taken together , these findings suggest that the mtor pathway is involved in regulating the expression of e - cadherin and the other components of adherens junction complex .
disruption of mtorc1 activity by transduction with raptor shrna inhibits e - cadherin expression since recent reports indicate that mtor functions as a part of mtorc1 or mtorc2 depending on its binding partners , and each complex has different inherent roles , we questioned whether loss of e - cadherin is mediated through mtorc1 or mtorc2 .
to investigate this , a549 cells were transduced with shrna against raptor , rictor , or tsc2 , which regulate mtorc1 , mtorc2 and rheb , respectively .
samples were then blotted for e - cadherin .
raptor shrna - transduced cells lost e - cadherin expression , while rictor and tsc2 shrna - transduced cells did not ( figure 2a ) .
to further confirm this finding , different raptor shrna constructs were transduced into a549 and h2009 nsclc cells and the expression of e - cadherin was evaluated by immunoblotting and real - time pcr .
e - cadherin expression decreased in a549 and h2009 cells when they were transduced with either raptor shrna construct , and the loss was more prominent in a549 cells ( figure 2b ) .
e - cadherin mrna expression also decreased in a549 and h2009 cells transduced raptor shrna ( figure 2c ) .
these findings suggest that inhibiting mtorc1 by silencing raptor reduces e - cadherin expression at the transcriptional level .

aberrant akt - gsk - 3 signaling in raptor deficient cells because feedback regulation of pakt is one of the functions of mtorc1 , we next evaluated the phosphorylation of akt at ser473 in raptor - silenced nsclc cells .
increased phosphorylation of akt at ser473 was observed in a549 , h2009 , h460 , and h1299 raptor - silenced nsclc cells , causing inhibitory phosphorylation of the akt substrate gsk - 3beta at ser9 ( figure 3 ) .
to further confirm hyperactivation of akt / gsk - 3beta signaling in raptor - silenced nsclc cells , sirna against raptor was introduced into a549 , h460 , h1299 , and h2009 nsclc cells ( data not shown ) .
all nsclc cells treated with raptor sirna showed increased levels of pakt - ser473 and pgsk - ser9 compared to those transduced with scrambled sirna .
these findings suggest that akt / gsk - 3beta pathway aberrations are a general finding in cells with mtorc1 disrupted by raptor silencing and that akt phosphorylation leads to functional activation of akt / gsk - 3beta signaling .
figure 3 aberrant akt - gsk3beta signaling in raptor - silenced cells .
a549 , h2009 , h460 , and h1299 nsclc cells were transduced with scrambled or raptor shrna and pakt - ser473 and pgsk - ser9 levels were evaluated by western blotting .
beta - actin was used as a loading control .
transcriptional repressors of e - cadherin are elevated in raptor - silenced cells because transcriptional inhibition of e - cadherin is frequently mediated by e - cadherin repressor complexes and we observed decreased e - cadherin mrna expression in raptor - silenced nsclc cells , we evaluated e - cadherin repressor complex mrna expression by qrt - pcr .
among the e - cadherin repressor complexes tested , snail , zeb2 , and twist1 had increased expression in raptor - silenced a549 cells and zeb2 and twist1 were elevated in raptor - silenced h2009 cells ( figure 4a ) .
we postulated that inhibitory phosphorylation of gsk - 3beta at ser9 by akt might cause the increase in snail , zeb2 , and twist mrna .
to test this , a549 parental cells were treated with licl , a gsk - 3beta inhibitor , and e - cadherin repressor complex mrna expression was evaluated by qrt - pcr .
indeed snail , zeb2 , and twist1 mrnas were elevated in cells treated with licl ( figure 4b ) .
because snail is mainly regulated by beta - trcp mediated proteosomal degradation secondary to gsk - 3beta - mediated phosphorylation [ 17 ] , we were curious about the contribution of the mrna level elevation to the expression of snail protein .
licl treatment slightly increased the expression of snail and its effect was comparable to that of igf - 1 .
combined treatment with licl and mg132 strongly increased expression of snail .
taken together , these findings suggest involvement akt / gsk - 3beta signaling in the loss of e - cadherin repressor complexes in raptor - silenced cells ( figure 4c ) .
figure 4 e - cadherin repressor complexes are elevated in raptor - silenced cells .

emt in raptor - silenced nsclc cells emt entails morphological and phenotypic changes of epithelial cells leading to loss of cellular polarity and intercellular adhesion , and the development of migratory and invasive properties .
phase - contrast imaging of raptor - silenced cells shows a transition from the typical cobblestone appearance to elongated spindle shapes .
these findings are more prominent in a549 cells than in h2009 cells .
to further elucidate the emt in raptor - silenced cells , immunocytochemical staining against e - cadherin and vimentin was performed .
raptor - silenced a549 cells showed a marked increase in vimentin and decrease in e - cadherin expression whereas h2009 cells did not exhibit changes in the expression of e - cadherin and vimentin ( figure 5a ) .
then mesenchymal markers , alpha - smooth muscle actin ( sma ) , vimentin , and n - cadherin , were blotted in scrambled - and raptor - shrna - transduced cells .
similar to the findings in the morphologic study , raptor - silenced h2009 cells did not show changes in the expression of vimentin , n - cadherin , and sma .
expression of vimentin and n - cadherin was increased in raptor - silenced a549 cells while that of sma was unchanged , suggesting that disruption of mtorc1 leads to emt in a subset of cells ( figure 5b ) .

( c ) illustration of the role of mtorc1 in the regulation of mtorc2 - mediated emt .
discussion since the discovery of rapamycin in 1975 as an antibiotic , rapamycin and its derivatives , rapalogs , have been widely used as immunomodulators in solid organ transplant patients , for the treatment of lam [ 13 ] and tuberous sclerosis complex [ 18 ] , and for the treatment of neoplastic conditions such as kaposi 's sarcoma [ 19 ] , hepatocellular carcinoma [ 20 ] , and renal cell carcinoma .
rapamycin also prolonged the life expectancy of mice [ 21 ] and explosively broadens its clinical applications .
in addition to the common side effects , such as impaired glucose metabolism and changes in lipid profiles , rapalogs can cause interstitial pneumonitis and nephritis .
pulmonary side effects , including interstitial pneumonitis , bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia , granulomatous interstitial pneumonitis and rarely , diffuse alveolar damage with alveolar hemorrhage [ 22 - 24 ] , are frequent adverse effects of rapalogs and its incidence is 5 - 15 % [ 25,26 ] .
there are 2 hypotheses for rapamycin - induced pneumonitis : direct alveolar cytotoxicity and immune - mediated toxicity [ 6 ] .
however , histopathological analysis of rapamycin - induced lung injury , showing accumulation of extracellular matrix collagen and fibroblast proliferation , suggests that emt could be another mechanism of rapalog - induced lung injury [ 27 ] .
the downregulation of e - cadherin is a hallmark of emt and is involved in transcriptional repressors , including the zinc finger proteins , snail , slug , zeb1 , and zeb2 , and the basic helix - loop - helix factors , tcf3 and twist1 .
snail and slug are up - regulated at the transcriptional level by activation of pi3k / akt / mtor signaling [ 8 ] .
they are further controlled by gsk - 3beta phosphorylation - mediated degradation [ 17,28 ] .
in our study , silencing of raptor caused increased phosphorylation of akt at ser473 and subsequent inhibitory phosphorylation of gsk3beta at ser9 .
raptor - silenced cells showed upregulation of snail , zeb2 , and twist1 .
these findings could be recapitulated by treatment with gsk - 3beta inhibitor , resulting in profound effects on the mrna expression of e - cadherin repressor complexes .
among the cells expressing e - cadherin that were evaluated in this study ( a549 , h596 , h1650 , and h2009 ) , a549 cells showed the most prominent morphologic and phenotypic changes after raptor silencing .
we postulated these from the characteristics of a549 cells that have a loss of lkb1 which leads dependency to mtorc1 .
comparing to the silencing of raptor that caused loss of mtorc1 mediated feedback inhibition of pakt - ser473 and decrease of e - cadherin expression , rapamycin treatment increased that of e - cadherin .
in our time and dose dependent experiments , treatment of rapamycin showed a prompt decrease in ps6 phosphorylation within 10 min and a delayed decrease in phosphorylation of akt at ser 473 ( additional file 3 : figure s1 ) .
these findings are compatible to the findings from montero et al .
[ 29 ] and implies that exposure to the higher dose and / or prolonged exposure to rapamycin inhibits both mtorc1 and mtorc2 leading inhibition of both mtorcs , which resulting inhibition of pakt - ser473 and increase of e - cadherin expression .
the half - life of rapamycin in whole blood is 135 hr ( vs. 7.2 hr in plasma ) in humans [ 30 ] .
the usual dose of rapamycin ranges from 1 to 3 mg / day and is adjusted to maintain trough levels of 4 to 12 ng / ml [ 26 ] .
it is unclear whether repetitive oral administration of 1 to 3 mg / day of rapamycin to adults is mtorc1 selective or influences both mtorcs .
these suggest further in vivo studies are required with cautious dosing schedules and optimal dosing ranges .
our study has a number of limitations .
besides that animal data was not presented , findings in this study were obtained from lung cancer cell lines .
when compared to the silencing of the rictor , which did not result in noticeable changes in cell proliferation , disruption of mtorc1 by raptor silencing significantly inhibited cell growth and proliferation .
transduction of raptor shrna into beas - 2b cells inhibited cell proliferation and resulted in failure of cell line establishment .
this may originate not only from the unique role of each mtor complex but also from the existence of alternative pathways which circumvent blocking of the each pathway .
in other words , relayed signaling through pi3k - pdk1 pathway may be helpful to circumvent the blocking of mtorc2 whereas there is no alternative pathway which helps bypassing blocking of mtorc1 .
this bypass of mtorc2 blocking led less phenotypic changes in rictor silenced cells .
we also were unable to observe changes in e - cadherin in tsc2 - suppressed cells .
because loss of tsc function is still considered a major mechanism that leads to uncontrolled proliferation of lam cells , further study on this subject is warranted .
conclusions selective inhibition of mtorc1 induced phosphorylation of akt ser473 and gsk - 3beta ser9 , increasing expression of e - cadherin repressor complexes and decreasing expression of e - cadherin .
this finding suggests caution in using selective mtorc1 inhibitors and / or p70s6k1 inhibitors in clinical practice because of the danger of akt - mediated emt ( figure 5c ) .

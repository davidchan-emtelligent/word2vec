in figure six ( figure 1 here ) of the original manuscript [ 1 ] panels b - h are representative images from which measurements were taken and then graphed in figure six panel i. in the original submission of the manuscript panel c and h ended up showing identical images .
we corrected this error by replacing panel c with the correct representative image .
note that this error occurred when preparing the original figure and it does not affect the data presented in any way .
figure 1 histamine ( ha ) receptor 1 antagonist ( 125 mum chlorpheniramine ) and histidine decarboxylase ( hdc ) inhibitor alpha - methylhistidine ( amh , 100 mum ) treatment of competent larvae leads to increased caspase activity .
caspase activity was analyzed using fam - vad - fmk , a fluorescently tagged caspase inhibitor .
normalized fluorescence was measured in the arm tips of competent larvae .
ha , ha receptor 2 antagonist ( 200 mum cimetidine ) , ha receptor 3 antagonist ( 125 mum thioperamide ) and kcl had no effect on caspase activity .
the upper panel shows representative fluorescent images of treatment categories : b - control , c - ha ( 1 mum ) , d - ha receptor 1 antagonist ( 125 mum chlorpheniramine ) , e - ha receptor 2 antagonist ( 200 mum cimetidine ) , f - ha receptor 3 antagonist ( 125 mum thioperamide ) , g - alpha - methylhistidine ( amh , 100 mum ) and h - kcl .
the lower panel shows the corresponding results of the fluorescent analysis .
panel a illustrates the approximate region of the arms that was included in the analysis .
note that all fluorescent intensities were normalized to the area measured and the exposure time .
scale bars : 20 mum .

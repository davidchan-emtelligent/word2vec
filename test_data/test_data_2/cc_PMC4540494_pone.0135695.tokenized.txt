background standard 24 - locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit variable number tandem repeat ( miru - vntr ) typing allows to get an improved resolution power for tracing tb transmission and predicting different strain ( sub ) lineages in a community .
methodology during 2010 - 2012 , a total of 168 mycobacterium tuberculosis complex ( mtbc ) isolates were collected by cluster sampling from 10 different moroccan cities , and centralized by the national reference laboratory of tuberculosis over the study period .
all isolates were genotyped using spoligotyping , and a subset of 75 was genotyped using 24 - locus based miru - vntr typing , followed by first line drug susceptibility testing .
corresponding strain lineages were predicted using miru - vntrplus database .
principal findings spoligotyping resulted in 137 isolates in 18 clusters ( 2 - 50 isolates per cluster : clustering rate of 81.54 %) corresponding to a sit number in the sitvit database , while 31 ( 18.45 %) patterns were unique of which 10 were labelled as " unknown " according to the same database .
the most prevalent spoligotype family was lam ; ( n = 81 or 48.24 % of isolates , dominated by sit42 , n = 49 ) , followed by haarlem ( 23.80 %) , t superfamily ( 15.47 %) , > beijing ( 2.97 %) , > u clade ( 2.38 %) and s clade ( 1.19 %) .
subsequent 24 - locus miru - vntr typing identified 64 unique types and 11 isolates in 5 clusters ( 2 to 3isolates per cluster ) , substantially reducing clusters defined by spoligotyping only .
the single cluster of three isolates corresponded to two previously treated mdr - tb cases and one new mdr - tb case known to be contact a same index case and belonging to a same family , albeit residing in 3 different administrative regions .
miru - vntr loci 4052 , 802 , 2996 , 2163b , 3690 , 1955 , 424 , 2531 , 2401 and 960 were highly discriminative in our setting ( hgdi > 0.6 ) .
conclusions 24 - locus miru - vntr typing can substantially improve the resolution of large clusters initially defined by spoligotyping alone and predominating in morocco , and could therefore be used to better study tuberculosis transmission in a population - based , multi - year sample context .

introduction despite the existence of effective antituberculosis drugs , tuberculosis ( tb ) continues to be a major global health challenge with an estimated 9 million new active cases and 1.5 million tb deaths annually ( just under 1 million ) .
moreover , control efforts to fight tb are threatened by the emergence of different forms of drug resistance [ 1,2 ] .
in morocco , tb is a major public health problem with a relatively high incidence reaching 83 new cases for 100000 inhabitants [ 3 ] .
tb affects especially young adults and therefore has a high impact on the socio - economic situation of the country .
tb control remains a priority in morocco , thus a better understanding of tb transmission could help to identify risk settings as well as to improve contact tracing .
molecular typing of mtbc is a powerful adjunct to tb control e.g , to monitor the disease transmission , and to detect or confirm outbreaks .
in the last decade , the optimized 15 to 24 - locus miru - vntr typing system has been proposed for international standardization [ 4 ] .
this pcr - based system , optionally combined with spoligotyping [ 5 ] , has been shown to provide a similar resolution power relative to the previous is6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism ( rflp ) standard for the study of tb transmission in different western european settings [ 6 - 8 ] .
moreover , miru - vntr typing is also useful for studying at relatively high resolution the diversity and clonal expansion of particular strain or lineages [ 9 - 11 ] .
only a few studies have investigated mtbc genetic diversity in morocco [ 12 - 17 ] .
el baghdadi et al. ( 1997 ) and diraa et al. ( 2005 ) , used is6110 - based restriction fragment length polymorphism ( rflp ) , whereas tazi et al. ( 2004,2007 ) , lahlou et al. ( 2012 ) and chaoui et al .
( 2014 ) used spoligotyping alone or in combination with a 12 - locus miru - vntr typing for molecular epidemiological analyses of moroccan isolates [ 13,15 - 17 ] .
the purpose of the present study was therefore to assess standard 24 - locus based miru - vntr typing for the first time , on a panel of mtbc isolates collected from diverse geographical cities from morocco .
we tested 168 isolates by spoligotyping , then we evaluated the usefulness of this standardized 24 - locus based miru - vntr typing on a subset of 75 mtbc .
the specific aims of this study were to evaluate the diversity of circulating mtbc strains at a higher resolution compared to most previous studies and to establish possible links between drug resistance profiles and molecular types .
material and methods study population and setting tb patients from eight regions of different ethnic groups of morocco were included in the study .
mtbc strains were collected within the framework of immuno - genetics study of the tuberculosis in the population over a period of 3 years ; between january 2010 and december 2012 .
for this molecular epidemiological study , patients were recruited from 12 public health centers and 2 university hospitals .
pulmonary samples were collected from 10 centers of tb treatment and respiratory disease ( ctrd ) located in marrakech , tanger , oujda , fes , meknes , sidi kacem , sale , temara , casablanca and rabat , whereas extrapulmonary samples ( pleural fluid and gastric liquid ) were collected from two university hospitals in casablanca and rabat .
these cities are known to be hot spot areas of tb at national level .
patient isolates a total of 471 clinical samples were recruited in this study corresponding to 167 patients , from which 155 ( 92.81 %) had pulmonary tb ( sputum , sputum induced by fibro - optic bronchoscopy , bronchial wash and bronchial aspirations ) , 11 ( 6.58 %) patients had extrapulmonary tb ( pleural fluid and gastric liquid ) and 1 ( 0.59 %) patient with both ( pulmonary and extrapulmonary tb ) .
two patients were re - treatment cases , while the remaining 165 were new cases ( table 1 ) .
all pulmonary patients had sputum microscopy positive according to their clinical manifestation ; pulmonary and extrapulmonary tb cases were included by cluster sampling from 10 cities ( rabat , temara , sale , casablanca , marrakech , sidi kacem , meknes , fes , oujda and tanger ) .
sputum smear microscopy and culture for the collected samples were performed in regional laboratories , then the isolates were submitted to national reference laboratory of tuberculosis ( lnrt ) at the national institute of hygiene in rabat , for identification and drug susceptibility testing ( dst ) to first line drugs .
culture of pleural liquid ( pl ) samples was performed at lnrt .

ethical approval statement was obtained ( reference number 1169 ) from ethics committee named " comite d'ethique de medicine et de pharmacie de rabat " ; participants provide their written informed consent and the ethics committee approves these consent procedures and the present study .
all tb patients were diagnosed according to the national guidelines in morocco .
strains isolation and drug susceptibility testing the clinical samples were cultured on lowenstein - jensen ( l / j ) culture media and on growth indicator tubes ( mgit ) 960 culture tubes inoculated in bactec system .
the isolates ( n = 168 ) were subjected to identification as mtbc using biochemical tests including production of niacin ( strip niacin [ becton dickinson , ca , usa ]) , catalase activity and susceptibility testing of mtbc to p - nitrobenzoic acid ( pnb ) , thiophene - 2 - carboxylic acid hydrazide ( tch ) and paraaminosalicylic acid ( pas ) [ 18 ] .
first line drug susceptibility testing was performed using the 1 % proportion method for isoniazid ( inh ) , rifampicin ( rmp ) , streptomycin ( sm ) and ethambutol ( emb ) at the following concentrations : 0.2 mg / ml , 40 mg / ml , 4 mg / ml and 2 mg / ml respectively on l / j medium [ 19 ] and using bactec mgit 960 sire kit [ becton dickinson , ca , usa ] .
results were categorized into three major groups , i.e. resistance to a single drug ( mono resistance ) , to more than one drug but not inh and rmp ( polyresistance ) , and resistance to at least both inh and rmp ( mdr - tb , [ 18 ]) .
epidemiological and demographic data such as age , sex , city of birth , address at the time of diagnosis , place of residence and clinical characteristics of the disease were prospectively collected using a questionnaire established within the study framework .
molecular methods genomic dna was prepared from scarped colonies in 200 mul of 1xte buffer ( 10mm tris - hcl ph : 8.0 , 1mm edta ph : 8.0 ) followed by heat inactivation at 85degrees for 30 min [ 20 ] .
spoligotyping was carried out for 168 isolates , using the commercially available membranes ( ocimum biosolutions , hyderabad , india ) [ 5 ] .
standard 24 - locus based miru - vntr typing was performed for 75 isolates using the available commercial kit ( genoscreen , lille , france ) and 16 capillary abi 3730 genetic analyzer ( applied biosystems , ca , 78 usa ) as described previously [ 4 ] .
miru - vntr alleles were determined by using genemapper v - 4.0 ( applied biosystems , ca,79 usa ) and data were compiled by using miru - vntr data manager software ( genoscreen , lille , france ) .
molecular data analysis spoligotyping results were converted into octal codes and entered in sitvit database [ 21 ] for analysis .
major spoligotypes families were assigned according to signatures provided in the database .
distinction between evolutionary , ancient , and modern lineages of tubercle bacilli was made as described [ 22 - 27 ] .
mtbc genetic lineages were predicted using online tools available from miru - vntrplus website ( www.miruvntrplus.org [ 28 ]) according to the previously described strategy combining best - match and phylogenetic based analysis [ 29 ] and by using information in the sitvit database ( fr : 8081 / sitvit online / indexjsp ) .
molecular clustering of the isolates was determined by constructing a dendogram based on spoligotyping and miru - vntr data .
a strain cluster was defined as two or more isolates sharing completely identical fingerprints based on both methods .
discriminatory power of a typing method ( or a combination of methods ) was calculated using the hunter and gaston discriminatory index ( hgdi ) [ 30 ] .
cases of isolates displaying double alleles in one locus suggestive of clonal microevolution [ 31 ] , or in two or more vntr loci suggestive of mixed genotypes , which could reflect either mixed infection or contamination [ 32 ] were retested .
results study population a total of 168 isolates were enrolled in this study , from 167 patients were selected from 10 cities located in 8 of 16 administrative regions of morocco ( 51.79 % from rabat - sale - zemmour - zaer , 20.23 % from marrakech - tansift - al haouz , 11.3 % from tanger - tetouan , 9.53 % from fes - boulmane , 2.98 % from grand casablanca , 2.38 % from region oriental , 1.19 % from meknes - tafilalt and 0.6 % from gharb - chrarda - bnihssen ) .
these cities are known to be hot spot areas of tb. the demographic and epidemiological data summarized in table 1 showed that the age of patients ranged from 18 to 81 years ( mean 49.5 years ) .
gender information was available for all cases : males represented 74.25 % of the cases , with a male to female sex - ratio of 2.9 ( 124 / 43 ) .
there was no correlation between localities ( administrative regions ) and age / sex - ratio of patients .
clinical status was available for all tb patients : 98.8 % ( 165 / 167 ) were new cases and 1.19 % ( 2 / 167 ) were previously treated .
92.81 % ( 155 / 167 ) had pulmonary tb , while 6.58 % ( 11 / 167 ) had extrapulmonary tb. one patient ( 0.59 %) had both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tb ( table 1 ) .
drug susceptibility the drug susceptibility testing ( dst ) data was available for all cases , and showed that 88.7 % ( 149 / 168 ) of the strains were pansusceptible , while the remaining 11.3 % ( 19 / 168 ) showed resistance to one or more drugs .
among the resistant strains , monoresistance to inh , sm and emb was found in 6.0 % , 0.6 % and 0.6 % of the tested strains respectively , as opposed to none for rmp. of note , mdr isolates represented only 5 ( 3.0 %) of 165 new tb cases included in the study .
in contrast , the two remaining retreatment cases were mdr .
spoligotyping data analysis analysis of the spoligotyping data was done by assigning shared international type ( sit ) numbers and genotypic spoligotype family designations in comparison with spoldb4 [ 21 ] and its updated sitvit version [ 22 ] ( s1 table ) .
the global sample containing 10 / 168 ( 6.0 %) isolates that could not be assigned into well - determined designations in both , and as such were labeled as '' unknown " .
in contrast , the remaining , 158 isolates belonged to 39 classified sits in the international sitvit database .
a total of 137 / 168 ( 81.54 %) clinical isolates were clustered 18 clusters containing 2 - 50 isolates per cluster while 31 were unique ( 21 with an assigned sit , and 10 unknown from sitvit ) .
the major spoligotype families observed ranked as follows : latin - american & mediterranean or lam , 81 / 168 ( 48.21 %) with the following subfamily distribution : lam3 n = 8 ; lam5 n = 1 ; lam6 n = 1 ; lam9 n = 67 ; cam alias cameroon , n = 4 ; haarlem , 40 / 168 ( 23.80 %) with the following subfamily distribution h1 n = 11 ; h3 n = 29 ; t superfamily 26 / 168 ( 15.47 %) with the following distribution : t1 n = 24 ; t2 n = 2 ; beijing , 5 / 168 ( 2.97 %) ; u clade , 4 / 168 ( 2.38 %) and s clade , 2 / 168 ( 1.19 %) .
no x lineage strains or eai ( east - african indian ) strains were found in the present investigation .
regarding the frequencies of the major shared types , sit42 ( lam9 ) strongly predominated in our setting with 49 / 168 ( 29.16 %) of the isolates .
it was followed by sit53 ( t spoligotype group ) with 19 / 168 isolates ( 11.3 %) and sit50 ( haarlem ) with 17 / 168 isolates ( 10.1 %) .
these three predominant sits were widespread in all moroccan cities included in this study .
interestingly , 8 isolates , with a priori more unexpected spoligotypes , corresponding to sit61 ( cam : n = 4 ) , to sit1070 ( u : n = 3 ) and sit443 ( u : n = 1 ) , were isolated either in the capital city 's administrative region of rabat - sale - zemmour - zaer , or in the cosmopolite and touristic administrative regions of marrakech - tensift - al haouz and fes - boulmane ( table 2 ) .
likewise , we also found 5 isolates ( 2.97 %) with a sit1 ( beijing ) spoligotype among cases from marrakech - tansift - al haouz , rabat - sale - zemmour - zaer and grand casablanca capital of touristic region .

locus miru - vntr typing .
these isolates were selected to cover the different cities included in the study and different already established spoligotype families ; they were originated from both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tb patients , with different drug susceptibility profiles ( pansusceptible , polyresistant and mdr ) ( table 2 ) .
among the 75 isolates , molecular cluster analysis based on 24 - locus miru - vntr genotypes identified 69 distinct genotypes , only including 5 clusters comprising from 2 ( n = 4 ) to 3 isolates ( n = 1 ) each ( total of 11 isolates ) and 64 unique types ( fig 1 and table 2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0135695.g001 fig 1 genetic tree based on spoligotyping and 24 - locus miru - vntr data of 75 m. tuberculosis isolates from10 moroccan cities .
a dendogram was generated using the upgma algorithm using tools available from the miru - vntrplus identification database ( see text ) .
isolates are identified according to their corresponding spoligotype international type ( sit ; boxed ) , according to the sitvit database .
out of these unique types , 5 could not be assigned into well - determined genotypic lineage in the miru - vntrplus database , spoldb4 and sitvit database and as such were labeled as " unknown " .
importantly , the largest spoligotyping defined clusters were very efficiently subdivided by mirus , as e.g spoligotyping cluster st42 ( lam ) , which formed a block of 29 isolates , was almost completely resolved , with only four remaining clustered isolates .
likewise , the second largest spoligotyping defined cluster st50 ( haarlem ) was also almost completely resolved , with only a single cluster of 2 isolates remaining .
thus , among the 75 isolates , the miru - based clustering rate corresponded 14.66 % versus 76 % for spoligotyping .
the isolates within the five 24 - locus miru - vntr - based clusters showed identical spoligotype profiles , except in two cases , including a generic st53 / t1 and a st42 / lam9 spoligotypes , and perhaps more unexpectedly , a st50 / haarlem and a st42 / lam9 spoligotypes , respectively .
when analyzed at the scale of the full isolate subset , groupings based on 24 - locus miru - vntr and spoligotyping results were fairly congruent ( fig 1 and table 3 ) .
two main strain groups were identified on the basis of the miru - vntr - based tree , essentially composed of isolates with haarlem spoligotypes ( and isolates with generic t spoligotypes ) , and lam spoligotypes ( also with isolates with generic t spoligotypes ) , respectively .
a few outliers with apparently discordant grouping were detected in either part of the tree , e.g. , two st42 / lam9 isolates ( including one clustered with a t1 isolate ) found among otherwise haarlem branches .

the allelic diversity of the loci was classified as very discriminant [ hunter - gaston index ( hgi )> 0.6 ] , moderately discriminant ( 0.3 < hgi < 0.6 ) and poorly discriminant ( hgi < 0.3 ) [ 33 ] .

hitherto , mtbc population structure and tuberculosis transmission were only studied at the national level by using spoligotyping alone or in conjunction with 12 - loci mirus [ 16,17 ] .
in comparison to these two typing methods , the discriminatory power of 24 - locus miru - vntr typing has been shown to be higher in a number of other settings in europe and elsewhere [ 4,34,35 ] , and often similar to that of is6110 - based rflp when comparison with the latter method were made [ 6 - 9 ] .
in order to explore the informative value of 24 - locus miru - vntr typing , we selected 75 representatives from a baseline sample of 168 mtbc isolates screened by spoligotyping from 10 cities with high burden of tb , for which we also determined the drug resistance profiles .
as summarized in table 2 , 24 - locus based miru - vntr typing largely reduced the clustering defined by spoligotyping alone or even by spoligotyping combined with 12 - locus miru - vntr typing , from 76 % and 48 % to 14.6 % , respectively .
it is noteworthy that this effect was particularly noticed for large clusters initially defined by spoligotypes such as st42 ( lam ) and st50 ( haarlerm ) , which are predominant in morocco , as seen in this study as well in previous reports [ 16,17 ] .
after analysis with 24 loci , these initial spoligotype - based clusters were reduced to a few clusters of at most three isolates .
hence , no correlation was apparent between particular miru - vntr types and drug resistance profile , except for three mdr isolates that were confirmed to be part of a same familial outbreak ( see just below ) .
contact tracing could not be conducted for all these remaining clustered isolates in order to confirm tb transmission assumed from molecular clustering .
it is noteworthy however that the single cluster of three isolates corresponded to two previously treated mdr - tb cases and one new mdr - tb case known to be contact a same index case and belonging to a same family , albeit residing in 3 different administrative regions ( fes - boulmane , meknes - tafilalet and garb - chrarda - bnihssen ) during 2011 .
the consistent clustering of these three cases lends some degree of confidence to the overall reliability of the molecular results obtained .
this is also suggested by the overall degree of congruence observed between groupings on the basis on the 24 - locus miru - vntr - based tree and grouping of the corresponding spoligotypes .
only a few outliers were detected , for which samples were unavailable for repeat experiments in order to see if these few discordant groupings reflected some homoplasy linked to spoligotyping or miru - vntr data [ 36 ] , or technical errors .
in this sample collection , two different isolates were also obtained from one patient with both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tb. both spoligotyping and 24 - locus miru - vntr typing showed that the strain isolated from sputum defined as st273 / lam9 and mlva mtbc unk - 488 differed from the one isolated from pleural liquid clinical sample , defined as st784 / t2 and mlva mtbc unk - 85 .
this concordant result obtained by independent typing methods suggests a case of mixed infection with compartmentalization of different strains in distinct body sites [ 37 ] .
considering the full set of spoligotyping data obtained for the 168 study isolates , our results confirm that mtbc isolates in our country are essentially limited to evolutionary modern principle genetic group ( pgg ) 2 / 3 strains ( namely lam , haarlem , and t ) , as found in previous reports and different patient populations [ 16,17 ] .
overall , when our results are compared with those of these previous reports , it seems that mtbc population structure in morocco is highly stable , with almost same spoligotype distributions from 2002 to 2012 , and highly homogeneous .
strikingly , each of the 3 predominant lam , haarlem and t families was characterized by one or two predominant sits ( i.e.sit42 for lam , sit50 for haarlem and sit53 for t ) , almost always representing the prototype of each spoligotype family with large geographical distribution described in different databases [ 21,22 ] .
it can be speculated that this predominance of a few sits , especially that of lam family , reflects some founder effect linked to the introduction of the corresponding mtbc clonal branches in the region .
in contrast , although we found a total of 49 profiles identified among the 168 isolates , we did not find spoligotypes with strong local phylogeographical specificity ( table 2 ) .
we only identified 5 beijing isolates from three different cities ( marrakech , rabat and casablanca ) , while a previous study also detected a few isolates with such genotype in marrakech , fes and sale [ 16 ] .
this low prevalence of beijing strains in morocco plausibly reflects the low level of human immigration from east asia , where this strain lineage largely prevails and probably originally emerged according to recent analyses [ 11 ] .
mtbc isolates with a beijing genotype are often , albeit not always associated with mdr - tb , especially eurasia and east - asian countries [ 11,38 - 41 ] .
in our study , a single beijing isolate obtained from an extrapulmonary tb patient in casablanca , was mdr while the 4 other isolates were pansusceptible .
this is in accordance with previous studies , suggesting little to no association of beijing genotypes with mdr - tb in the country [ 12,16 ] .
however , more vigorous investigations are needed to further study this question and to trace the possible origins of the beijing isolates identified in our and previous studies [ 16 ] .
we also detected 4 isolates with another , more geographically specific spoligotype , belonging to the sit61 / cam spoligotype family in 3 cities : fes ( n = 1 ) , marrakech ( n = 1 ) and rabat ( n = 2 ) .
as this spoligotype has strong phylogeographical specificity to cameroon and its neighboring countries in west africa [ 21,22,42 ] , the presence of these strains in morocco is suggestive of importation by sub - saharan migrants to and across morocco [ 43 - 45 ] .
finally , we detected two isolates of t2 spoligotype family , and one with a sit443 / u pattern , none of which were previously described in morocco .
such patterns have been essentially reported from different region of asia and canada [ 21 ] , and asia usa and europe , respectively [ 21 ] .
also in line with finding from other , previously studied moroccan patient population [ 16,17 ] , we observed very little evidence of multidrug resistance with a frequency of only 3.0 % among the new cases in this study .
among the remaining cases , 85.7 % were pansusceptible , and the remaining 10.1 % showed resistance to one or more drugs .
in conclusion , although this study was limited by a relatively small sample size , the obtained results support the use of 24 - locus miru - vntr typing in our country , for substantially reducing the degree of over estimation of epidemiological links inferred among isolates analyzed by spoligotyping alone or in combination with 12 - locus miru - vntr typing .
this use should be especially beneficial to distinguish the many strains that apparently share a few highly predominant prototypic spoligotypes .
we therefore hope that its implementation will help enhanced tb control program in morocco to reduce the tb burden in the country [ 4,30,36 ] .
as a future cost - effective strategy and when possible , whole genome sequencing ( wgs ) could then be specifically applied on the remaining miru - vntr - based clusters to further test their possible significance in terms of ongoing tb transmission , given the superior resolution power provided by wgs to resolve tb outbreaks [ 46,47 ] .

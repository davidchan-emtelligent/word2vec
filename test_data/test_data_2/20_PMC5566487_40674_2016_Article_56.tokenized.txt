opinion statement specialists' views of fibromyalgia ( fm ) are typically colored by their experiences of the selected , complex cases that they are regularly called to evaluate .
at a population level , it is crucial to recognize that education which promotes patient empowerment and non - pharmacological interventions which support self - management are very effective .
the temptation , for both physician and patient , to first reach for pharmacological interventions should be resisted until such holistic approaches are explored .
in particular , a strong evidence base supports graded exercise and cognitive behavioral therapies , but such treatments must be intelligently " prescribed. " as reflected by the recent acr criteria , fm is a highly heterogeneous disorder and is not simply a disorder of pain .
for some patients , co - occurring symptoms , such as fatigue , can be equally as impactful and so management strategies should be sufficiently versatile to target those dimensions which are considered priorities at the level of the individual patient .
in those patients who do require pharmacological support , patients should not be led to expect significant gains in isolation .
the importance of self - management requires emphasis at each and every tier of management .
it is true that advances in our understanding of neurobiology have greatly informed the selection of adjunctive drug classes which may provide benefit ( as well as those which do not - - as is the case of opioids ) .
however , further unpicking of pathogenesis is still required if the fm landscape is to move further towards drug - led management .
keywords fibromyalgia chronic widespread pain http :// dx.doi.org / 10.13039 / 501100000882university of aberdeenissue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer international publishing ag 2016 introduction proposed genealogies of the syndrome now known as fibromyalgia ( fm ) stretch back as far as the late sixteenth century [ 1 ] .
key historical moments in its emergence as a distinct entity include the 1904 debut of fibrositis [ 2 ] and hench 's introduction of the term " fibromyalgia " in 1976 [ 3 ] .
the american college of rheumatology ( acr ) first published classification criteria in 1990 [ 4 **] , characterizing fm as chronic widespread pain ( pain in the axial skeleton and on both sides of the body , above and below the waist , for at least 3 months ) , plus 11 out of a possible 18 tender points on clinical examination .
the acr disseminated revised criteria in 2010 , the update shifting the emphasis from classification to diagnosis [ 5 **] .
the tender point requirement was replaced by recognition of the importance of patient - reported symptoms , including somatic , cognitive , and mood disorders .
the revised criteria allowed fm to be measured on a continuous scale that incorporated the widespread - ness of pain and the severity of concurrent symptoms .
a modified version of the 2010 criteria was published a year later ( 2011 ) , and these were used to develop a questionnaire for use in clinical and epidemiological studies of the syndrome [ 6 **] .
the mean worldwide prevalence of fm has been estimated to be 2.7 % , with a higher occurrence in women and those of middle or older age and lower socioeconomic status [ 7 ] .
us prevalence has been estimated as 2.2 % using the 1990 acr criteria [ 8 ] and 6.4 % using the 2010 acr criteria [ 9 ] .
advances in the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology , including recognition of the role of central pain sensitization , have informed fm management .
findings from studies investigating pharmacological , non - pharmacological and complementary , and alternative therapies have been summarized in clinical practice guidelines ( cpg ) .
these include the european league against rheumatism 's ( eular ) appraisal of the literature , published in 2008 [ 10 *] , which is currently being updated .
this document was one of six cpgs that contributed to a systematic review of guidelines published up to 2014 [ 11 **] which forms the basis of the evidence provided below .
treatment given the heterogeneous symptomology of fm , it may be unsurprising that multimodal , multidisciplinary management has been widely advocated .
this approach was supported by the highest level of evidence grading ( a1 : several randomized clinical trials with p < 0.01 with meta - analysis ) and the strongest possible recommendation ( a : benefit significantly outweighs adverse effects and should be applied to all eligible patients ) in a recent systematic review of cpgs [ 11 **] that included german and canadian recommendations [ 12 * , 13 *] .
emphasis is placed on patient education and self - management , with the integration of non - pharmacological and then pharmacological treatments as indicated by concomitant , uncontrolled symptoms , including severe pain , mood disorders , sleep problems , and fatigue .
two non - pharmacological treatments have received the highest ratings for level of evidence : exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy ( cbt ) [ 11 **] .
accordingly , non - pharmacological treatment options are considered first here , followed by pharmacological treatments , and then complementary and alternative therapies .
the development and effectiveness of management plans that select from this pool of options would sensibly be stratified according to the individual patient 's priorities .
the revised fibromyalgia impact questionnaire ( fiqr ) is one useful tool which may aid the multi - disciplinary team in the design of bespoke multimodal therapy packages .
this reliable and valid multidimensional assessment can also be employed to monitor function , symptoms , and the overall impact of fm over time [ 14 ] .
non - pharmacological treatment education patient education is the keystone of multimodal fm management .
the educational component should develop the individual 's understanding of the pathophysiology of fm , especially the recent advances in neurobiology , in the context of a biopsychosocial model of health and illness .
education regarding the importance of self - management that includes information on exercise , sleep habits , and the setting of realistic expectations , should be supported [ 13 * , 15 *] and can rarely be achieved during a single session .
the effectiveness of patient education has been demonstrated in a number of trials when it is provided as part of a multimodal management package .
the provision of an online repository of information and resources which empower patients may be of particular benefit in supporting education , self - management , and improving symptom control and quality of life [ 11 ** , 16 *] .
exercise exercise has been identified as effective in managing a range of fm symptoms , including pain , reduced activity , and poor quality of life .
a cochrane review collated the evidence for 47 different types of exercise therapies and determined aerobic exercise to be associated with reductions in pain , number of tender points , and functional limitation [ 17 **] .
a later review found similar benefits in response to strengthening exercises [ 18 ] , and more recent research has supported the effectiveness of aquatic exercise [ 19 ] .
given a lack of evidence to support any one specific exercise modality over others , cost , patient preference , and the likelihood of long - term adherence are factors to discuss and agree upon during the development of a management plan .
research that has objectively measured physical activity levels has determined that individuals with chronic pain are less active than those without chronic pain [ 20 ] .
this relationship may , in part , be explained by beliefs held by individuals with chronic pain regarding movement and symptom exacerbation [ 21 ] .
unhelpful beliefs may be given traction if exercise is not introduced in a graded manner , with negative experiences after unpaced exercise deterring future participation .
indeed , the word " exercise " itself may cause trepidation in some individuals with chronic pain , so focusing on increasing activity in general may be a preferable starting point .
guidelines have proposed sessions of moderate to mild intensity activity for a 30 - min duration at least two times a week [ 11 ** , 12 * , 13 *] .
garcia et al. found exercise to be included in all cpgs identified up to 2014 and awarded it the highest ratings for both level of evidence and strength of recommendation [ 11 **] , highlighting the central role it plays in fm symptom management .
cognitive behavioral therapy cognitive behavioral therapy ( cbt ) can be used to target negative thoughts about pain and its exacerbation on activity and can support behavior change through improvements in symptom management self - efficacy [ 12 * , 13 *] .
along with exercise , cbt received the highest rating for level of evidence in a synthesis of cpgs [ 11 **] .
a 2013 meta - analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials investigated the impact of cbt on pain , function , and mood in individuals with fm [ 22 **] .
positive , yet modest , effects were observed both at the end of treatment and in the longer term for all outcomes .
evidence suggests that cbt is effective regardless of mode of delivery ( one - to - one , group therapy , or internet - based ) .
the choice of medium may be informed by availability , cost - effectiveness , location and , importantly , the patient 's preference and existing commitments ( for example , occupational or homecare duties and geographical location ) [ 23 ] .
consideration of , and response to , these factors may support adherence to a full course of therapy , with consequent associated benefits .
an important point to note is that acceptance of cbt may be reduced if it is perceived as a purely psychological intervention [ 15 *] .
instead , cbt as one facet of a multimodal management plan should be fully explained as part of the educational component .
it is also too simplistic to consider cbt as a single therapeutic entity which may be " taken off the shelf " and applied uniformly .
existing programs are not necessarily underpinned by the same behavioral models , and perhaps the most optimal strategy is to enable patients to inform the selection of specific themed cbt modules which align best with their individual needs .
as an example , some patients may well benefit more from targeting of their fatigue rather than their pain .
such program versatility has been successfully tested and resulted in significant benefits out to 2 years [ 24 ] .
finally , cbt programs may be delivered at varying intensities .
so called " low grade " cbt has been successfully delivered in many disorders by trained health professionals who do not have a background in psychology [ 25 ] .
such an approach is clearly attractive in many health care systems where access to psychologists is limited by costs and / or limited availability .
pharmacologic treatment the pharmacological treatment of fm is largely an " off - label " , testament to the fact that , in the usa , only three drugs are currently food and drug administration ( fda ) - approved ( pregabalin , duloxetine , and milnacipran ) .
in comparison , two are approved by health canada ( pregabalin and duloxetine ) and none are approved by the european medicines agency [ 26 *] .
the efficacy of a broad range of pharmacological treatments has been investigated in randomized controlled trials .
in general , pharmacological treatment , restricted to the shortest duration possible , should be reserved for cases of severe and uncontrolled symptoms , including pain , sleep , and mood disorders , when non - pharmacological options have been exhausted .
anti - depressants classes of anti - depressant frequently used to treat individuals with fm symptoms include tricyclic anti - depressants , serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( snris ) , and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssris ) .
pain reductions resulting from their use are attributed to modulating effects on serotonin and norepinephrine in descending inhibitory pain pathways [ 27 ] .
tricyclic anti - depressants amitriptyline is the most studied anti - depressant in the treatment of fm - related symptoms .
clinical trials have demonstrated reductions in pain , sleep problems , and fatigue , although the methodological quality of studies has been questioned [ 28 ] .
improvements have been identified 6 to 8 weeks after commencement at low doses ( 25 mg / day ) , but no benefit identified with either an increased dose ( 50 mg / day ) or after a longer duration ( 12 weeks ) when compared to placebo [ 29 ] .
the garcia et al. summary of published cpgs rated the level of evidence for amitriptyline as a1 , recommending its prescription , at a dose of 10 - 50 mg / day , for those with severe , uncontrolled pain and sleep problems [ 11 ** , 12 * , 30 *] .
common side effects include drowsiness , dry mouth , and weight gain , and many patients find that such problems outweigh any gains in symptom relief .
serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors duloxetine a systematic review of the efficacy of duloxetine reported a reduction of greater than 30 % for pain effective doses being between 60 - 120 mg / day , with no difference detected between doses [ 31 *] and lower doses ( 20 - 30 mg / day ) not demonstrating significant effects .
modest , positive effects on sleep and function have also been reported [ 32 *] .
the spanish and german guidelines , published in 2011 and 2012 , respectively [ 12 * , 30 *] , identified duloxetine as the preferred snri , prescribed at a dose of 60 mg / day , for those with comorbid anxiety or depression in cases where amitriptyline is contraindicated or ineffective ( level of evidence a1 ) [ 11 **] .
possible side effects of duloxetine include nausea , palpitations , headache , fatigue , tachycardia , and hypertension [ 15 *] .
milnacipran a cochrane review conducted by hauser et al. that investigated the effects of snris on fm symptoms identified five studies that compared milnacipran with placebo [ 32 *] .
its use was associated with a small incremental benefit for pain reduction and slight improvements in fatigue and quality of life but no improvements detected for sleep problems .
an effective dose of 100 - 200 mg / day has been proposed with potential side effects including nausea , palpitations , headache , fatigue , tachycardia , and hypertension [ 15 *] .
it has been suggested that , as milnacipran is slightly more noradrenergic than duloxetine , it may be more suitable for individuals presenting with fatigue and memory problems [ 15 *] .
however , as it may also be more likely to precipitate hypertension , careful balancing of benefits and risks on a case - by - case basis is required .
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris used to treat fm symptoms include fluoxetine , paroxetine , and sertraline .
in a meta - analysis of the effects of fluoxetine , a moderate effect on pain and modest effects on sleep and fatigue were detected [ 33 ] .
side effects of ssris include nausea , sexual dysfunction , and weight gain [ 15 *] .
fluoxetine or paroxetine ( 20 - 40 mg / day ) have been identified by two 2012 guidelines as worthy of consideration for those with comorbid anxiety of depression [ 12 * , 13 *] .
anticonvulsants the analgesic effect of anticonvulsants is thought to occur through a reduction in the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain processing , e.g. , glutamate and substance p [ 34 ] .
this class of drugs was developed , and subsequently licensed , as antiepileptics but they are now commonly used in the management of chronic pain [ 26 *]. pregabalin pregabalin is fda - approved for fm symptom management .
a cochrane review from 2013 reported a 30 % reduction in pain but a modest effect on fatigue and sleep and no impact on function [ 35 *] .
standard dosages range from 50 - 450 mg / day [ 11 ** , 12 * , 30 *] , to up to 600 mg / day , in divided doses .
side effects include sedation , weight gain , and dizziness [ 15 *] .
garcia et al. recommend its consideration if amitriptyline is contraindicated or ineffective ( level of evidence : a2 - - several randomized clinical trials have provided evidence p < 0.01 without meta - analysis strength of recommendation : b - - can be recommended ) [ 11 **] .
gabapentin the use of gabapentin for fm symptom management is relatively understudied .
a cochrane review that investigated gabapentin in the treatment of neuropathic pain and fm ( date of most recent search january 2011 ) [ 36 *] included only one study that investigated its effect on fm symptoms [ 37 ] .
this study reported an improvement in pain ( significant 30 % reduction ) and function and a modest effect on sleep problems .
a dose range of 800 - 2400 mg / day , in divided doses , has been suggested .
side effects include sedation , weight gain , and dizziness [ 15 *] .
nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) there is no evidence to support the efficacy of nsaids in managing fm - related pain , with trials consistently demonstrating no benefit over placebo [ 38 ] .
indeed , there is evidence to suggest that drugs frequently used to treat peripheral pain , such as nsaids and opioids , are not only ineffective , but may exacerbate symptoms [ 15 *] .
given the potentially deleterious side effects affecting the gastrointestinal , renal , and cardiac systems , this class of drugs should only be prescribed in cases of persistent and moderate to severe peripheral pain .
in such instances , the lowest effective dose possible should be prescribed for the shortest duration to minimize any secondary effects [ 15 *] .
opiods the apparent hyperactivity of the endogenous opioid system in fm perhaps explains the general inefficacy of opiods [ 15 *] .
tramadol has however been commonly used , although any benefit may actually relate to its mild snri effects .
recommendations regarding tramadol use are inconsistent across cpgs .
its use has been associated with significant pain reduction ( 30 %) [ 39 ] , although garcia et al. recommend its use only once all other pharmacological options have been exhausted and in cases of persistent moderate or severe pain [ 11 **] .
tramadol dosage , with or without acetaminophen , has been suggested at 50 - 100 mg every 6 h. side effects to be cognizant of include sedation , possible addiction , the development of tolerance , and opioid - induced hyperalgesia [ 15 *] .
complementary and alternative therapies in their systematic review of cpgs for the management of fm , garcia et al. identified four alternative therapies that were recommended by more than one guideline : acupuncture , qi gong , tai chi , and yoga [ 11 **] .
however , given limited corroboration of findings , further research is required to support the effectiveness of these therapeutic options , as well as to determine the benefit of other alternative or complementary approaches .
however , as adjuncts to non - pharmacological and pharmacological interventions , patient preference and selection of complementary or alternative therapies may provide a useful way of engaging individuals with active symptom management , encouraging " buy - in " to self - care , and potentially enhancing self - efficacy [ 15 *] .
furthermore , in circumstances where all else fails , patient - directed alternative approaches ( as long as they are safe ) may most optimally tap into clinically important placebo responses .
conclusions a range of treatment modalities to address complex and heterogeneous fm symptoms should be explored in collaboration with patients .
understanding the individual 's needs and specific symptoms that are restricting activities and participation is key to the development of tailored treatment plans .
education , exercise , and active self - management are highly recommended , providing the core around which pharmacological and non - pharmacological treatments and complementary and alternative therapy adjuncts can be supplemented .
importantly , education should acknowledge the limits of pharmacological treatments in resolving symptoms , and self - management should be promoted within the context of realistic expectation setting .
exercise comes most highly recommended followed by cbt .
short courses of pharmacological treatment are indicated when symptoms are particularly burdensome .
overall , a personalized approach is indicated , where , above the staple of education and encouragement of positive exercise , sleep and stress reduction behaviors , and additional psychological interventions ( i.e. , cbt ) may be of benefit for those with unhelpful coping strategies and pharmacotherapy may be indicated in cases of severe pain , sleep disturbance , or mood disorders. through actively involving patients in the design of a multimodal management plan that takes into consideration the preferred method and timing of delivery , self - efficacy and a sustained commitment to behavior change may provide the optimal atmosphere for long - term symptom management .

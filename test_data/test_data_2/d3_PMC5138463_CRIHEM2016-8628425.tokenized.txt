sickle cell disease is an inherited haemoglobinopathy that can affect multiple organs and systems .
the most common neurological complication in sickle cell disease is stroke and silent cerebral infarcts .
peripheral nervous system involvement has been described but is exceedingly rare .
herein , we describe the case of a young woman who presented with acute flaccid paralysis and sensory loss of the left lower extremity in the context of a painful vasoocclusive crisis which resolved rapidly after receiving an emergency automated red cell exchange transfusion .
1. introduction sickle cell disease ( scd ) is a common hemoglobinopathy that may affect every human organ or system [ 1 ] .
nervous system involvement is one of the most devastating aspects of the disease .
both central ( cns ) and peripheral ( pns ) nervous system complications have been described in the literature with cns involvement being by far the most common [ 2 ] .
acute neurological presentations include acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke [ 3 ] , infections , posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [ 4 ] , central sinus venous thrombosis [ 5 ] , and peripheral mononeuropathy [ 6 ] .
diagnosis of acute neurological events in patients with scd requires rapid access to appropriate imaging and management requires a multidisciplinary approach involving haematologists , neurologists , specialist radiologists , and stroke - rehabilitation physicians .
we report the presentation , management , and outcome of a young woman with hbss who developed acute paralysis and sensory loss of the left lower extremity in the context of a painful vasoocclusive crisis ( voc ) .
the patient gave consent to the publication of this report .
2. case report the patient , a 19 - year - old woman with sickle cell anaemia , was admitted due to acute onset of severe sensory - motor impairment of her left lower extremity .
the patient was awakened during the early morning hours by severe pain in the waist , typical of a voc , and realized that she had decreased sensation and mobility on her left leg ( characteristically mentioned that she could not feel or move the affected leg ) .
mobility and sensation in the right lower and both upper extremities were intact .
her mental status was normal , her speech was unaffected , and there were no sphincter disturbances .
neurological examination at the time of admission revealed power 1 - 2 of all muscle groups of the affected limb .
tone was reduced and deep tendon reflexes were absent even after reenforcement , suggesting peripheral nerve pathology .
sensation was subjectively reported by the patient as being 80 % decreased compared to normal and proprioception was lost .
gait could not be assessed as the patient could not stand .
save for lower spinal and left hip tenderness on palpation in keeping with voc , the rest of the neurological and general physical examination was unremarkable .
results of baseline diagnostic tests are summarized in table 1 .
computer tomography ( ct ) of the brain , magnetic resonance imaging with angiography ( mri / mra ) of brain , and circle of willis and mri of the spine were performed .
ct of the brain was unremarkable with no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage and subacute or any established territorial infarct .
mri of the brain showed no evidence of acute ischemia and there were no vascular abnormalities on mra .
mri of the spine showed normal cord caliber and signal , with no evidence of intramedullary infarcts .
there was no evidence of hemorrhage or compression .
conservative therapy with fluids and parenteral opiate analgesia led to improvement of pain .
in the absence of any anatomical abnormalities , it was felt that the most likely cause for her acute peripheral nerve injury was ischemia due to vasoocclusion and the patient underwent emergency automated red cell exchange transfusion ( arcet ) 24 hours after her initial presentation .
she received 12 units of red cells as per uk national standards for patients with scd [ 7 ] using the spectra optia apheresis system .
pre - and posttransfusion haematological values are summarized in table 2 .
arcet led to immediate clinical improvement with almost complete resolution of the neurological deficit by the end of the procedure and , shortly afterwards , the patient was able to walk independently .
she was reviewed again by the neurologists who confirmed complete resolution of the deficit .
even though the patient was scheduled to have nerve conduction studies and a diagnostic lumbar puncture , these were now considered unnecessary and cancelled .
she was discharged home , 48 hours after admission , without any neurological deficit .
3. discussion scd is an autosomal recessive inherited haemoglobinopathy , resulting from the substitution of glutamate by valine in position 6 of the beta globin gene giving rise to an abnormal haemoglobin or " sickle haemoglobin " ( hbs ) [ 8 ] .
hbs molecules within the red cell tend to polymerize under certain conditions such as hypoxia , acidosis , or dehydration giving rise to the characteristic " sickle " shape of the erythrocytes .
these deformed and rigid erythrocytes lead to the two cardinal manifestations of scd : ( a ) vasoocclusion due to impaired rheology and infarction of the microvasculature and ( b ) haemolysis and chronic anaemia due to red cell deformability and increased destruction both intra - and extravascularly [ 9 ] .
intravascular sickling and haemolysis lead to a cascade of events including endothelial damage , ischemia re - perfusion injury , alteration of adhesion molecules , activation of coagulation , and nitric oxide ( no ) depletion , that result in the systemic vasculopathy and chronic inflammatory state that characterize scd [ 9 ] .
neurological complications involve principally the brain , while the spinal cord or the pns are rarely involved [ 10 ] .
nerve distribution varies and some nerves are more sensitive to ischemia than others [ 11 - 13 ] .
size and number of nutrient vessels that supply the different peripheral nerves are different among individuals and among nerves in the same individual .
these variations make certain individuals and certain nerve regions even in the same individual more susceptible when exposed to ischemia [ 14 ] .
animal studies have found the proximal tibial and peroneal nerves , distal sciatic nerve , and distal foot nerves to be most vulnerable to ischemia [ 14 ] .
in humans , the peroneal , sural , tibial , ulnar , median , and radial nerves are most frequently affected by ischemia [ 11 - 13 ] .
the extensive peripheral nerve vascular supply and the widespread network of large capillaries of the peripheral nerves could possibly explain the reason why ischemic neuropathy is rare in scd [ 14 ] .
there are limited reports in the literature of acute peripheral neuropathies presenting in patients with scd .
one such reports a mononeuropathy affecting the median nerve presenting as a painful vo [ 6 ] .
they conclude that the neurophysiology confirmed an ischemic injury to the median nerve with the only identifiable cause being that of a vasoocclusive insult .
the authors acknowledge that pns involvement is rare but the individual variation in nervous system anatomy and vascular supply mean this is still possible .
a further case report describes two patients who developed an acute mononeuritis multiplex in the context of a voc [ 6 ] .
one went on to be diagnosed with a mixed connective tissue disease ( mctd ) alongside their scd .
it the other patient , similar to our case , no other aetiology could be identified and all autoimmune tests were negative .
at three - year follow - up , this patient had some mild residual weakness in the foot , and no alternative diagnosis had made its self - known .
neurophysiology confirmed both cases were the result of nerve ischemia and , despite the mctd diagnosis , they attributed the ischemia to scd .
in both patients , symptoms developed in the lower limb , as the case in our patient and as previously discussed , nerves in the lower limb are more prone to ischemic insult .
other problems seen in a sickle cell crisis such as acidosis and dehydration are further risk factors for developing nerve ischemia .
these factors , together with a problematic vascular supply of the nerve , could lead to development of nerve ischemia in the context of a sickle cell crisis .
in the acute settling , all three patients were treated conservatively with analgesia and hydration .
although there was some level of neurological improvement over time , the patients were left with residual neurological deficits .
in the case we describe , the acute peripheral sensory - motor deficit in the context of a painful voc with absence of any abnormal radiological findings of the brain and spine was most likely the result of peripheral nerve ischemia due to vasoocclusion .
this is further supported by the rapid reversal of the clinical symptoms and signs after arcet .
in the previous cases described , individual nerves were the cause of the neurological deficit .
although we could not confirm the location of the lesion due to the swift reversal of symptoms , the presentation , along with the examination findings , would support a lumbosacral plexopathy .
there are few limitations in our diagnostic approach due to the absence of nerve conduction studies and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid to exclude other pathologies , such as the guillain - barre syndrome .
the patient 's swift recovery made the above procedures clinically unjustifiable .
to our knowledge , this is the first case of acute peripheral nerve injury in scd treated successfully with arcet .

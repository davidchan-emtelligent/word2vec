background international service learning trips ( islt ) provide health professional students the opportunity to provide healthcare , under the direction of trained faculty , to underserved populations in developing countries .
despite recent increases in international service learning trips , there is scant literature addressing concerns students have prior to attending such trips .
this study focuses on identifying concerns before and after attending an islt and their impact on students .
methods a survey comprised of closed and open - ended questions was developed to elucidate student concerns prior to attending an islt and experiences which might influence concerns .
a five - point likert - scale ( extremely concerned = 1 , minimally concerned = 5 ) was used to rate apprehension and satisfaction .
paired t - test was used to compare pre - and post - trip concerns ; chi - square test was used to compare groups .
results thirty - five students ( 27 medical , 8 pharmacy ) attended islts in december 2013 .
all completed pre and post - trip surveys .
significant decreases were seen in concerns related to cultural barriers ( 4.14 vs 4.46 , p = . 047 ) , disease / epidemics ( 3.34 vs 4.60 , p < . 001 ) , natural disasters ( 3.94 vs 4.94 , p < . 001 ) , terrorism ( 4.34 vs 4.94 , p < . 001 ) , travel ( 3.86 vs 4.51 , p < . 001 ) monetary issues ( 3.80 vs 4.60 , p < . 001 ) , hospitality ( 3.94 vs 4.74 , p = . 001 ) and food ( 3.83 vs 4.60 , p < . 001 ) .
language and group dynamics remained concerns post - trip .
on open - ended questions , students described benefits of attending an islt .
conclusions students had multiple concerns prior to attending an islt .
most decreased upon return .
addressing concerns has the potential to decrease student apprehension .
the results of this study highlight the benefits of providing islts and supporting development of a curriculum incorporating trip - related concerns .

keywords student concerns service learning trips global health trips short - term medical service trips medical missions medical volunteerism medical students pharmacy students issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background international medical service learning trips ( islt ) , also known as global health trips or medical missions , encompass trips of varied durations that provide opportunities for health professional students to deliver medical care and health education , under the direction of trained health providers , to underserved communities in low income and developing countries .
there is extensive interest in islt by north american medical students .
participation by us medical students increased from 6 % in 1984 to nearly 20 % in 2003. by 2011 , nearly two thirds of u.s. medical students planned to participate in some form of global health learning or services during medical school [ 1 ] .
as the prevalence of international service - learning trips ( islts ) increases , there is growing interest in the impact such trips have on medical students [ 2 , 3 ] .
it is commonly asserted that they improve communication , listening , and clinical diagnosis skills of students by putting them in a setting where human interaction takes precedence over technology [ 4 ] .
students acquire firsthand knowledge of common diseases in the developing world and become acquainted with public health issues in resource - poor settings [ 4 - 6 ] .
furthermore , relief trips foster clinical competence and cultural awareness among students by giving them the opportunity to provide medical care in underserved regions [ 5 , 7 , 8 ] .
additionally , medical students who have participated in such trips tend to have higher national board of medical examiners part ii scores compared to those who have not participated [ 9 ] .
therefore , global health opportunities not only sharpen the clinical acumen of students but also give them an edge by exposing them to a side of medicine that cannot be experienced in the classroom .
despite recent increases in global health trips , there is scant literature addressing specific concerns students have prior to attending such trips [ 2 , 3 ] .
our study focuses on identifying student concerns before and after attending a service - learning trip and the impact on student satisfaction and achievement of personal and professional goals .
methods we conducted a literature review to identify articles related to students' participation in global health missions with a focus on student concerns .
we utilized pubmed and google scholar to conduct our search and used the following terms : " global health missions " , " medical missions " , " international service learning trips ( islts )" , " short - term islts " , " student experiences on global health trips " , " student concerns and global health trips. " variables of interest including monetary issues , travel issues , terrorism , disease / epidemics , language , and cultural barriers were derived from the literature [ 4 , 10 - 12 ] .
questions relating to these themes were developed .
we asked faculty and students who had attended multiple islts in the past to provide input regarding concerns they personally experienced or observed in others .
we modified and added questions .
to enhance content validity we asked these same individuals to review the final surveys to ensure we identified all relevant concerns .
after refining questions , we piloted pre and post trip surveys to a sample of ten students who had not attended a previous islt .
we identified redundancies and shortened the survey to enhance usability .
the final surveys included questions on demographics , foreign language skills , travel history , history of attending previous global health trips , and questions related to financing the trip .
in the pre - trip survey , we collected data on levels of apprehension related to language , food , hospitality , diseases and epidemics , natural disasters , terrorism , travel concerns , monetary concerns , cultural barriers , religious barriers and group dynamics .
additional information was obtained by asking the participants about the topics researched before the trip and resources used to prepare for the trip .
following the trip , students completed a post - trip survey to assess their concerns , guidance they received from senior students and faculty , and overall satisfaction with the experience .
we used a five - point likert - type scale ( 1 - extremely concerned ; 5 - minimally concerned ) to rate the level of apprehension related to concerns both before and after the trip and the level of guidance students received from senior students and faculty ( 1 - extremely helpful ; 5 minimally helpful ) .
we also used a likert - scale to determine the likelihood of students participating in similar trips in the future ( 1 - very likely ; 5 - never ) .
dichotomized ( yes , no , undecided ) questions were used to determine if students would recommend the trip to their peers , if they still wanted to practice medicine overseas at any point in their career and whether such trips should be integrated into their school 's curriculum .
an exploratory question to determine the impact of an islt on political engagement was included to provide baseline information for future research .
we specifically asked students if they had voted in the previous presidential election and if so , whether their awareness of global health issues influenced their vote .
previous studies have described the effects of short - term islts on students but have not addressed the influence of previous life experiences [ 2 , 4 , 6 ] .
we asked a number of open - ended questions to gain a deeper understanding of how these experiences might influence students' concerns .
we were specifically interested in gaining insight on the impact of having lived or traveled abroad , ability to speak the native language , previous exposure to health - care outside the united states , and why they chose to go to a particular country .
we also assessed students' views regarding the personal and professional benefits of participation .
after the trip , students identified reference tools they took with them and any barriers that prevented them from utilizing these tools .
they also described what they learned in terms of clinical skills .
students described how their experience affected their view of global health and how it influenced plans to participate in global health after graduation .
lastly , students were asked to provide feedback on how the survey and the trip itself could be improved in the future .
the pre - trip survey contained 38 questions ( see additional file 1 ) .
the post - trip survey contained 36 questions ; demographic questions were not repeated ( see additional file 1 ) .
our study was approved by the human investigation committee at wayne state university ( irb # 129712b3x ) .
participation on the islt was not contingent on participation in the study .
we administered the surveys to medical and pharmacy student members of the world health student organization ( whso ) at the wayne state university school of medicine ( wsu - som ) who were participating on a short term islt in december 2013 .
we administered the pre - trip survey to students at an informational meeting two weeks prior to the trip .
each student chose a unique code ( a color and six digit number ) , which was marked on each of their surveys to keep their identities anonymous and allow for paired analysis of pre - trip and post - trip data .
the post - trip survey was completed at a debriefing session within two weeks of their return .
we used bivariate analyses with paired t - test to compare the pre - trip and post - trip survey data along with qualitative analysis on our open - ended questions .
the chi - square test was used to analyze a portion of the pre - trip and post - trip data .
p value of 0.05 was considered significant .
we used ibm spss statistics version 21 ( ibm , armonk , ny , usa ) .
three members of the research team reviewed responses from open - ended questions .
a master list of responses was created .
inductive codes were formulated to identify and pool similar concepts [ 13 ] .
responses were again studied to check the appropriateness of the codes applied to the data [ 13 ] .
codes were then grouped by their nature into themes .
codes were reconciled by consensus and themes were identified [ 13 ] .
results all students provided informed consent and returned the survey .
for questions which were not answered , we calculated percentages based on the number of students who responded to the question .
p values for appropriate questions were calculated based upon the total number of students who answered the question .
demographic data is provided in table 1 .
out of thirty - five total students , thirty ( 86 %) were born in the united states [ 14 ] .
all students spoke english as their first language and had graduated from an undergraduate institution in the united states [ 14 ] .
seven out of thirty students ( 23 %) indicated they had lived outside the united states for at least one year ; none had lived in a third world country [ 14 ] .
many participants specified they spoke another language in addition to english , with spanish being the most common [ 14 ] .
out of 35 , eleven ( 31 %) students spoke spanish at a conversational level and one student ( 3 %) spoke fluently [ 14 ] .
table 1 student demographics demographics total ( n = 35 ) male 46 % female 54 % white 74 % black 6 % asian 14 % other 6 % medical school students 77 % pharmacy school students 23 % forty percent ( 14 / 35 ) of the participants had previously attended a whso trip .
students gave a variety of reasons for selecting this trip as their destination [ 14 ] .
these included prior visits to the country , the desire to experience a new culture and to help the local population , the desire to learn a new language , and the total cost of the trip [ 14 ] .
students shared their personal and professional goals on the pre - trip survey .
in terms of personal goals , students commented that they hoped to learn about new cultures and health systems and build relationships with other students [ 14 ] .
in terms of professional goals , students expressed desires to have an opportunity to help people and improve their clinical skills and medical knowledge [ 14 ] .
students utilized a variety of resources to research information about their destination country before the trip .
web - based resources including google , centers for disease control and prevention , and wikipedia ( r ) were utilized by 29 of 35 students ( 83 %) [ 14 ] .
six students ( 17 %) reported using a smart phone / electronic device application , and four students ( 11 %) used a travel book / guide [ 14 ] .
there were a variety of topics researched ( see fig. 1 ) .
students researched the diseases prevalent in the area ( 18 / 35 ; 51 %) , languages spoken ( 18 / 35 ; 51 %) , and travel tips ( 18 / 35 ; 51 %) , while geography ( 12 / 35 ; 34 %) , culture ( 12 / 35 ; 34 %) and information about native peoples ( 6 / 35 ; 17 %) were reviewed less often [ 14 ]. fig. 1 topics researched by students prior to trip students had various concerns prior to the trip ( see table 2 ) .
they were most concerned about disease and epidemics and least concerned about religious barriers [ 14 ] .
all concerns , except for those related to language , decreased after the trip .
analysis of pre - trip and post - trip likert responses ( 1 - extremely concerned ; 5 - minimally concerned ) using paired t - test demonstrated a significant decrease in concerns related to cultural barriers , diseases and epidemics , natural disasters , terrorism , travel and monetary issues , hospitality , and cuisine ( see table 2 ) .
concerns related to religious barriers and group dynamics did not significantly decrease but there were low levels of concern in these domains both before and after the trip .
language was the only concern which increased after the trip .
in contrast , students who spoke spanish displayed a near - significant decrease in their concerns related to language following the trip compared to those who did not speak spanish ( p = . 053 ) .
students who researched prevalent diseases in the destination country had significantly less pre - trip concerns related to disease than those who did not research this aspect ( p = . 02 ) .
previous participation on service - learning trips had no impact on student pre - trip concerns .
there were no differences in pre - trip or post trip levels of concerns in any domain by gender , previous attendance on whso trip , experience living abroad or whether the student was a pharmacy or medical student .
finally , student concerns had no impact on the likelihood of incorporating global practice into their future career plans .

a majority ( 29 / 34 ; 85 %) relied on local volunteer medical translators [ 14 ] .
twelve students ( 35 %) used a smartphone or electronic device , eight ( 24 %) used a bilingual dictionary / thesaurus , and seven ( 21 %) used a language - learning program [ 14 ] .
students utilized a variety of resources to finance their trip [ 14 ] .
a majority ( 20 / 34 , 59 %) used student loans to cover the costs .
sixteen ( 46 %) received assistance from family members , ten ( 29 %) fund - raised , and five ( 14 %) used other means to pay for their trip [ 14 ] .
students were involved in a group sustainability project before and during the trip involving the distribution of water filters to the local population .
twenty - two out of thirty - five students ( 63 %) indicated they felt their projects were worthwhile [ 14 ] .
thirty - four of thirty - five students ( 97 %) stated they were satisfied with their trip experience , thirty - two ( 91 %) stated they were likely to participate in a future trip as a student , and thirty - three ( 94 %) indicated that they would likely participate in future trips as faculty members [ 14 ] .
finally , as a consequence of the trip , more students planned to incorporate global practice into their future career plans ( pre - trip : 20 / 34 , 59 % , post - trip : 25 / 34 , 74 % ; p < . 001 ) .
according to us census data , 21 % of the population aged 18 - 29 was eligible to vote in the 2012 presidential election and 15 % of total votes cast in the election were from this age group [ 15 ] .
furthermore , their voting rate in the election was 45 % [ 15 ] .
sixty - five percent ( 23 / 35 ) of students who attended this islt indicated they had voted in the most recent presidential election , while 25 % ( 9 / 35 ) did not vote [ 14 ] .
eight percent ( 3 / 35 ) chose the " prefer not to answer " option on this question [ 14 ] .
a majority ( 16 / 28 ; 57 %) of students indicated global health issues did not influence their vote while 28 % ( 8 / 28 ) indicated it did have an impact on their decision to vote [ 14 ] .
finally , 14 % ( 4 / 28 ) of students chose the " prefer not to answer " option to this question [ 14 ] .
analysis of comments from an open - ended question asking about personal and professional goals demonstrated student 's pre - trip expectations were met and , in most cases , surpassed .
on a personal level , many expressed an enhanced level of cultural awareness , exposure to a different health - care environment , and an increase in passion for helping the underserved .
on a professional level , many students noticed an improvement in their clinical skills , enjoyed the opportunity to work with physicians and senior students , and enhanced language skills , all while caring for patients ( see table 3 ) .

- > " belief that we have a positive impact on people 's lives. " discussion and conclusions students identified multiple concerns prior to participation on an international service - learning trip .
concerns included disease and epidemics .
all concerns , except for those related to language , decreased after the trip .
nearly all students provided positive feedback in their surveys and reported being extremely satisfied with the overall experience .
these students were influenced on both a personal and professional level .
post - trip , students reported the trip provided them with exposure to clinical medicine , an opportunity to enhance their patient interviewing and physical diagnosis skills , a greater awareness of global health issues , and the opportunity to work in a resource - poor setting .
most students expressed a desire to attend additional medical relief trips and to encourage other students to do so as well .
prior studies , which reported on similar student experiences , have concluded that exposure to health - care in an underserved region should be offered during medical school [ 8 ] .
it was also concluded that these international experiences enhance self - awareness of students and aid in the development of their world - view [ 8 ] .
this may explain why the american association of medical colleges ( aamc ) is undertaking an expansion in their global health learning opportunities ( ghlo ) program [ 2 , 9 , 16 ] .
currently , twelve us medical schools participate in the ghlo program , including wsu - som [ 16 ] .
the program 's primary purpose is to facilitate international exposure of medical students [ 16 ] .
along with their objective of encouraging students to acquire international experiences , they aim to provide students with the guidance and resources necessary to address any pre - trip concerns they may have .
identifying students' pre - and - post trip concerns provides insight into how to best prepare students for global health learning opportunities .
addressing concerns prior to the trip by developing a pre - trip curriculum and incorporating education about prevalence of disease and epidemics , cultural and religious barriers , issues related to money , food , hospitality and travel , education on group dynamics and team functioning have the potential to further optimize student experiences .
curricula can be developed for specific trips , regions and students [ 10 ] .
the aamc 's ghlo program can create an opportunity for participating medical schools to contribute resources for use at other medical schools .
selection of students with specific language skills has the potential to decrease student language concerns .
alternatively , offering courses in basic medical spanish ( or other appropriate languages ) may help better address this particular concern , decreasing pre - trip anxiety and thereby providing a better learning experience .
future studies should analyze language barriers that persist despite the preliminary preparations undertaken by students .
the results of this study further highlights the need for not only providing international experiences to students , but also for the development of a global health curriculum to address important issues related to travel which cause students concern .
according to the aamc , the annual median tuition rates of medical schools in the united states are $ 34,540 and $ 53,714 for public and private schools , respectively [ 17 ] .
the average debt of a medical student after graduation is approximately $ 176,348 [ 17 ] .
therefore , it is worth noting a majority of students in our study financed their trip using student loans .
considering the average cost per student to cover travel was $ 1800 , students were truly motivated to attend the global health trips despite the potential increase in overall debt burden .
there are limitations to this study .
although the post - trip survey was completed within two weeks of the trip , results were subject to recall bias .
additionally , this is a small study of thirty - five students at a single u.s. institution .
our results may not be applicable to other medical schools .
nevertheless , our study highlights the importance of identifying students' trip - related concerns .
finally , addressing such concerns , through implementation of a global health curriculum , will further enhance the value of islts .
despite concerns identified by students prior to attending a service - learning trip , most concerns decreased upon their return and their satisfaction with the trip experience was clearly expressed .
addressing concerns prior to the trip has the potential to decrease pre - trip anxiety and further enhance these experiences .
future studies should address the impact of trip - specific curricula to optimize global health learning experiences .

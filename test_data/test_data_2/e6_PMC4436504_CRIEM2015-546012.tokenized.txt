amlodipine overdose can be life - threatening when manifesting as noncardiogenic pulmonary edema .
treatment remains challenging .
we describe a case of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema without refractory hypotension and bradycardia after ingestion of 500 milligram amlodipine with suicidal intent .
mechanical ventilation , dexamethasone , atrovent hfa ( ipratropium ) , pulmicort inhalation , and antibiotic therapy were used for the management .
length of hospital stay was 11 days .
the patient was discharged with full recovery .
1. introduction amlodipine , a dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blockers ( ccbs ) , constitutes the leading form of cardiovascular drug overdose and has been implicated in several deaths resulting from such overdose [ 1 , 2 ] .
it has half - life of 30 - 50 hours with a large volume of distribution ( 21 liter per kilograms ) [ 1 ] .
it has also a low metabolic clearance with the advantage of using a once - daily dosage [ 3 ] .
treating patients with amlodipine overdose can be challenging [ 4 ] .
patients severely poisoned can develop profound refractory bradycardia , hypotension , acute kidney injury , and either cardiogenic or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema [ 5 ] .
here we report a case of amlodipine overdose with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema without refractory hypotension and bradycardia which was managed supportively .
2. case report a 36 - year - old woman was admitted to our poisoning emergency department with recurrent vomiting and generalized muscular pain 11 hours after ingestion of 100 tablets of amlodipine five milligram .
she had a suicidal intent .
she had gone to a local health center three hours after the consumption .
gastric decontamination had been performed for her at that center .
then she had been discharged with her own consent .
on admission , she had a blood pressure of 95 / 60 mm hg in the supine position with a pulse rate of 99 per minute and respiratory rate of 21 per minute ( table 1 ) .
she was afebrile , conscious , and anxious .
other cardiac and respiratory manifestations were normal .
pulse oximetry ( spo2 ) showed 93 % on room air .
she denied concomitant consumption of alcohol or any other drugs .
comprehensive toxicology analysis of urine was negative for opioids , morphine , alcohols , amphetamines , and so forth .
there were no signs of head trauma or focal neurologic signs .
she was hospitalized in an intensive care unit with respect to high toxic ingestion .
routine laboratory tests on admission were as follows : white blood cells ( 12.6 x 109 per liter ; normal range : 4 - 10 x 109 per liter ) ; 90 % neutrophil ; serum urea ( bun ) 21 milligrams per deciliter ( mg / dl ) ; creatinine ( cr ) 1.6 mg / dl ; serum calcium 8.4 mg / dl ; phosphorus 5.8 mg / dl ; and glucose plasma level 184 mg / dl. liver function tests , sedimentation rate ( esr ) , and serum electrolytes were within the normal limits .
venous blood gas analysis showed respiratory alkalosis ( ph 7.54 , carbon dioxide tension 18 millimeter of mercury , bicarbonate 15.1 milimol per liter ) ( table 2 ) .
electrocardiography demonstrated sinus tachycardia with normal pr , qrs , and q - t intervals .
chest x - ray performed immediately after admission was normal .
after four hours , blood pressure decreased to 85 / 50 millimeter of mercury ( mm hg ) .
she received one - liter normal saline as bolus infusion .
hourly urine output was initially below 0.5 milliliter per kilograms ( ml / kg ) body weight but it improved after infusion of crystalloid intravenous ( iv ) fluids and vasopressors ( dopamine hydrochloride drip at a rate of 5 - 10 micrograms per kilograms per minute ) for ten hours .
she had recovered from renal failure within 48 hours .
next day she began to experience gradual respiratory distress including developed tachycardia , tachypnea ( respiratory rates = 25 ) ( table 1 ) , and mild agitation .
fine inspiratory crackles in both lungs at auscultation were present .
arterial blood gas ( abg ) showed hypoxia arterial oxygen tension = 62 mm hg and oxygen saturation of 85 % .
the fio2 / pao2 ratio was less than 200 .
central vein pressure was within normal range ( 14 centimeter of water ) .
chest x - ray revealed bilateral fluffy shadows in the lower zones of both lung fields without cardiomegaly .
echocardiography was performed and ejection fraction was 60 % .
no evidence of diastolic dysfunction was observed .
she was intubated under sedation with midazolam ( 0.1 milligram per kilograms ) and ventilated ( initial settings : synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation ( simv ) mode , fraction of inspired oxygen ( fio2 ) = 70 % ; tidal volume 6 - 8 ml / kg ; positive end expiratory pressure ( peep ) = 5 cm h2o ; respiratory rate ( rr ) = 10 / minute ; pressure support ( ps ) = 10 mm hg ) .
after 10 hours , she presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) and the setting was adjusted to : fio2 = 40 % , peep = 10 cm h2o , rr = ten per minute , and ps = 15 cm h2o .
the patient received dexamethasone ( 8 mg , three times daily ) , ipratropium bromide inhalation aerosol ( three milliliter vial , three times daily ) , and pulmicort inhalation ( one milligram per day ) .
the results regarding the vital signs , o2 saturation , vbg , bun , and cr during hospitalization in an intensive care unit have been reported in tables 1 and 2 .
chest x - ray on day three showed typical batwing appearance without cardiomegaly which was suggestive of ards .
after 11 days of hospitalization she was extubated and transferred to the ward .
she underwent psychiatric evaluation and was discharged without any complications .
3. discussion there are no standardized guidelines for managing severe amlodipine intoxication because of limitation in the number of describing surveys [ 4 , 6 - 10 ] .
gastrointestinal decontamination in amlodipine overdose is beneficial when used within the one hour of consumption [ 11 ] .
also activated charcoal had been effective when given during the first 24 hours after drug ingestion [ 12 ] .
in our case gastrointestinal decontamination for three hours and activated charcoal for 11 hours after ingestion were started .
different pharmacologic therapies available for amlodipine overdose with persistent hypotension or myocardial depression include inotropic support with adrenergic agents , glucagon , iv infusion of calcium , hyperinsulinemia - euglycemia therapy , and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in refractory shock [ 4 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 13 ] .
in this case , she had mild hypotension without cardiac conduction defects ; therefore , she received only crystalloid and dopamine infusion and stabilized in a short time period .
our patient developed noncardiogenic pulmonary edema on day three .
amlodipine is a dihydropyridine that selectively blocks l - type calcium channels in smooth muscle and myocardial depressant activity at toxic levels so patients may present with cardiogenic pulmonary edema [ 13 , 14 ] .
some studies also reported cases with catastrophic shock and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema [ 9 , 10 , 15 ] .
the mechanism of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in patients with ccb overdose is not well known .
excessive pulmonary capillary transudation due to selective precapillary vasodilatation causes an increase in transcapillary hydrostatic pressure and ultimately interstitial edema [ 16 , 17 ] .
in our case severe hypotension was not observed , so interstitial edema may be caused by other ways such as blocking other types of calcium channels , the cytochrome p450 isoenzyme system effects [ 18 , 19 ] , or p - glycoprotein - mediated transport [ 20 ] .
also cardiac ejection fraction was 60 % ; therefore , fluid overload could not be reason of pulmonary edema .
considering age , sex , serum urea , creatinine level , and glomerular filtration rate , she suffered from mild and transient kidney injury .
so kidney injury could not be reason of pulmonary edema .
severe ccb poisoning is often associated with significant hyperglycemia due to l - type calcium channel in pancreatic beta - cells [ 21 ] , as well as dysregulation of the insulin - dependent or phosphatidylinositol three - kinase pathway [ 22 ] .
however , in this case glucose plasma levels were between 151 and 184 mg / dl for initial four days that may show a role in the ultimate degree of toxicity .
another finding in this case was the development of mild respiratory and metabolic alkalosis .
however , metabolic acidosis has been reported in most of the reported cases [ 5 - 16 ] .
metabolic acidosis could be resulting from systemic hypotension and acute kidney injury .
ards manifests with diffuse alveolar inflammation and increased pulmonary vascular permeability resulting in hypoxemia [ 23 ] .
a survey has shown mortality benefits with lower tidal volume of 6 ml / kg , keeping plateau pressure below 30 cm h2o and peep adjusted to optimize alveolar recruitment without causing overdistention [ 24 ] .
our patient developed ards related to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema .
she was treated with mechanical ventilation , dexamethasone , ipratropium bromide inhalation aerosol , and pulmicort inhalation which improved outcome and successful liberation from ventilator around 11 days .
although high - dose insulin and extracorporeal life support were the interventions supported for the patients with severe ccb [ 25 ] , supportive management might be useful in the treatment of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema after amlodipine overdose without refractory hypotension and bradycardia .

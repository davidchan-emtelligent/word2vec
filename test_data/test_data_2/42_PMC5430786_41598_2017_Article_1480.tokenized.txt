taxol , a first - line anti - tumour drug , has low effectiveness against colorectal cancer .
combination with other agents is an effective strategy to enhance taxol cytotoxicity .
kanglaite injection is an extract from coix lacryma - jobi seed and is usually combined with other agents to treat cancer .
the aim of this study was to investigate the treatment effect of taxol combined with kanglaite on colorectal cancer cell lines .
kanglaite pretreatment followed by taxol treatment was found to show the best synergism among all combination strategies .
this combination also resulted in the smallest tumour volume in a balb / c mice model .
kanglaite inhibited the expression of nuclear factor ( nf ) - kappabeta and upregulated that of connexin 43 , both of which sensitized cancer cells to taxol .
moreover , kanglaite increased many cellular variations caused by taxol , including tubulin polymerization , caspase - 3 cleavage , and upregulated expression of survivin and cyclin b1 .
these results suggest that kanglaite pretreatment may increase the effect of taxol on colorectal cancer .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction colorectal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide , and millions of people are diagnosed as having this condition each year1 .
although resection is the optimal treatment , chemotherapy and radiotherapy are also needed to prevent distant metastasis and local recurrence .
taxol is used as a first - line chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of ovarian and breast cancer2 , but taxol treatment of colorectal cancer is not effective in clinical chemotherapy .
some potential mechanisms contributing to taxol resistance include mutation of tubulin3 and cellular total antioxidant capacity4 , but other effects need further investigation .
however , combination with other agents is an effective strategy to enhance taxol cytotoxicity5 .
in recent years , it has been confirmed that various chinese herbs have anti - tumour activity .
many of them have been used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of various cancers to reduce the side effects and enhance the efficacy of these agents6 , 7 .
kanglaite ( klt ) injection is an extract from coix lacryma - jobi ( adlay ) seed whose main active ingredient is a triglyceride containing four types of fatty acids .
klt has diphasic broad - spectrum anti - tumour activity8 .
it enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects in the treatment of many cancers , such as gastric cancer8 , hepatocellular carcinoma9 , and non - small cell lung carcinoma ( nsclc ) 9 , when it was combined with some chemotherapeutic agents .
coix seed extract can regulate the expression of some apoptotic proteins , including wild type p5310 , bcl - 210 , fas11 , and caspase - 312 .
it is also known to inhibit nuclear factor ( nf ) - kappabeta - dependent transcription13 , 14 , which is recognized as a target for cancer therapy15 , and there is a particular interest in the possible use of nf - kappabeta inhibitors to enhance the effect of other chemotherapeutic drugs via increased apoptosis16 .
the molecular mechanism of taxol cytotoxicity has been confirmed .
briefly , taxol binds to the n - terminal region of beta - tubulin and stabilizes microtubules .
eventually , the effect results in g2 / m arrest , which promotes apoptosis17 .
however , administration of lower doses of taxol activates various survival signals and leads to chemoresistance .
it has been confirmed that taxol activates nf - kappabeta which has critical roles in regulating cell survival , proliferation , invasion and metastasis18 .
some agents were used to inhibit nf - kappabeta to sensitize cancer cells to taxol , such as curcumin19 and 1 ' s - 1 ' - acetoxyeugenol acetate20 .
because klt is an nf - kappabeta inhibitor and has anti - tumour activity , we hypothesized that klt may enhance taxol cytotoxicity against colorectal cancer cells .
in this work , four colorectal cancer cell lines were used to investigate the treatment effect of taxol combined with klt .
results klt pretreatment enhances the cytotoxicity of taxol mtt assay showed that taxol has considerable cytotoxicity against all four cell lines , but klt has low cytotoxicity against all cells even at high concentrations (> 20 mug / ml ) ( fig. 1 ) .
a higher concentration leads to a change in culture medium components , which may contribute to the inhibition rate increment .
furthermore , klt enhanced taxol cytotoxicity when it was administered prior to taxol treatment , but no obvious synergism was observed when klt treatment was administered at the same time or after taxol treatment .
therefore , klt - pretreated cells were more sensitive to taxol than untreated cells were , but these cells were not sensitive to klt itself .

klt pretreatment enhances tubulin polymerization induced by taxol the results of both western blotting ( fig. 2 ) and immunocytochemistry analysis ( supplementary fig. s1 ) showed that klt pretreatment enhanced tubulin polymerization caused by taxol in all four cell lines .
since taxol can be taken up by cells and continuously exist , it should be noted that cells assessed at longer times after taxol treatment have more obvious tubulin polymerization .
the " taxol + klt " group was observed at an additional 12 h following 12 - h taxol treatment .
taxol existing in these cells still induced tubulin polymerization .
for this reason , the group " taxol + klt " has a higher tubulin polymerization rate than that of the group " taxol " .
klt had no effect on tubulin , but when it was combined with taxol , it increased the tubulin polymerization rate slightly .
furthermore , cells pretreated with klt and then treated with taxol had the highest tubulin polymerization rate among all groups .

the percentage of polymerized tubulin was obtained by dividing the densitometric value of the polymerized tubulin by the total tubulin content : \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ frac {{ p }}{{ p }+{ s }}$$\ end { document } pp + s. immunocytochemistry analyses of alpha - tubulin ( supplementary fig. s1 ) showed that all three human colorectal cancer cell lines in the " klt + taxol " group had compact bundles of microtubules and some cells contained asters of microtubules .
the cells in the " klt + taxol " group also contained many fragmented nuclei stained by dapi .
these results suggest that klt pretreatment enhanced the cytotoxic effect of taxol .
in the other groups , these three cell lines showed almost the same morphology of microtubules , which may be due to a low concentration of taxol ( 6 nm ) that cannot induce obvious tubulin polymerization .
furthermore , taxol caused obvious morphological changes in ct26 cells but changes in microtubule bundles were not obvious .
klt pretreatment also enhanced the morphological changes and increased fragmented nuclei of ct26 cells .
klt inhibits nf - kappabeta to sensitize colorectal cancer cell lines to taxol nf - kappabeta is a critical transcription regulator that controls the expression of many genes involved in inflammatory functions , the immune system , and cancer21 , 22 .
nf - kappabeta is a homodimer or heterodimer composed of two subunits , p50 and p65 .
the p50 - p65 dimer maintains normal physiological function in vivo ; therefore , we used an anti - p65 antibody to analyse nf - kappabeta activation .
in normal conditions , nf - kappabeta binds to members of the inhibitor of nf - kappabeta ( ikappabeta ) family to form an inactivated compound in plasma .
when nf - kappabeta dissociates from ikappabeta upon exposure to an external stimuli , nf - kappabeta is activated and transferred to the nuclei .
this occurs primarily via activation of ikappabeta kinase ( ikk ) .
ikk is composed of a heterodimer of ikkalpha and ikkbeta and a regulatory protein ( ikkgamma ) .
therefore , we used an anti - ikkalpha antibody to analyse ikk expression .
furthermore , ikk and ikappabetaalpha are both cytoplasmic proteins , so we only detection their expression in cytosolic extraction .
many anti - tumour drugs , including taxol , activate nf - kappabeta in cancer cells by inducing ikappabeta degradation23 .
studies have shown that coix seed extract13 and klt14 can inhibit nf - kappabeta , and cancer cells can be sensitized to taxol by nf - kappabeta inhibition19 .
we investigated whether klt inhibits nf - kappabeta in colorectal cancer cells and sensitizes them to taxol .
the effect of taxol and klt on the regulation of nf - kappabeta , ikappabetaalpha and ikk were determined by western blot .
in the cytosolic protein component ( fig. 3a ) , nf - kappabeta was slightly down - regulated by taxol and slightly upregulated by klt .
figure 3b showed that taxol promoted translocation of nf - kappabeta to nuclear and klt can inhibit the translocation effectively .
figure 3c showed that taxol upregulated nf - kappabeta expression in whole cell lysate and klt can inhibit this effect .
figure 3d showed that taxol significantly decreased ikappabetaalpha expression and klt also depressed ikappabetaalpha expression slightly .
because activation of nf - kappabeta can upregulate ikappabeta expression to inhibit itself , we speculated that the inhibition of nf - kappabeta translocation to nuclear by klt may decrease ikappabeta expression .
figure 3d also showed that klt but not taxol decreased ikk expression , which suggested that klt may inhibit nf - kappabeta activation by depressing ikk expression .

supplementary fig. s2 also shows that taxol activated nf - kappabeta in all four colorectal cancer cell lines .
the red arrows in fig. s2 indicate that only taxol group has obvious translocation of nf - kappabeta to nuclear but other groups have not .
it can be found that klt pretreatment inhibited nf - kappabeta activation induced by taxol .
treatment combinations of " taxol + klt " and " taxol & klt " also inhibited nf - kappabeta activation , similar to " klt + taxol " .
furthermore , the " klt + taxol " group showed more fragmented nuclei than the " taxol " group did , which suggests that klt inhibits nf - kappabeta activation to sensitize cells to taxol .
klt helps taxol to increase cyclin b1 and survivin expression arrest of the cell cycle at the mitotic phase is a molecular mechanism of taxol - induced cytotoxicity .
taxol causes mitotic arrest at the g2 / m phase by inducing tubulin polymerization and stabilization .
cyclin b1 , a mitotic cyclin , has a crucial role in regulating cyclin - dependent kinase 1 , which initiates the progression from g2 phase to mitosis .
the activity and amount of cyclin b1 increase during the cell cycle until mitosis24 , after which it degrades25 .
as shown in fig. 4 , the cyclin b1 expression levels were increased by taxol but not by klt .
in addition , klt pretreatment resulted in further upregulation of cyclin b1 expression induced by taxol , and the " klt + taxol " group had the highest cyclin b1 expression .
survivin is an anti - apoptotic protein and is highly expressed in various cancers .
the survivin expression level increases in the g2 / m phase of the cell cycle and is always involved in taxol - mediated mitotic arrest of cancer cells26 .
as shown in fig. 4 , survivin expression levels were increased by taxol but not by klt .
in addition , klt pretreatment enhanced the upregulation of survivin expression caused by taxol , and the " klt + taxol " group had the highest survivin expression .
these results are consistent with those reported in other studies27 , 28 .

klt increases connexin 43 expression , which may increase taxol cytotoxicity connexins are a group of tumour suppressor genes and are potential anti - oncogenic targets for chemotherapy .
upregulating connexin expression can increase the sensitivity of many cancers29 , 30 to chemotherapy drugs including taxol31 .
connexin 43 ( cx43 ) is the most widely expressed in different tissues among the group of connexins32 .
we found that klt can upregulate cx43 expression ( fig. 4 ) , and this effect may enhance the cytotoxicity of taxol .
the " klt + taxol " group had lower cx43 expression than the " klt & taxol " and " taxol + klt " groups did , which may be because the measurement time was 12 h after klt treatment .
cx43 is the most ubiquitously expressed member of the connexin family and is a structural component of gap junctional intercellular communication ( gjic ) , an important intercellular channel33 .
like cx43 , gjic function also relates to cellular sensitivity to taxol34 .
for this reason , we used the " parachute " dye - coupling assay to measure gjic function and to determine whether upregulation of cx43 by klt treatment can increase gjic function .
figure 5 shows that klt - treated cells have higher gjic function than the control group do. although upregulation of cx43 expression only contributes to a part of the gjic function increment , the results suggest that klt treatment increases gjic function by upregulating connexin expression , which may partly relate to cx43 .

average number of cells with green fluorescence in each group were compared by student 's t - test .
* p < 0.05 , significantly different from control group .
gjic functions of all klt treated cells were higher than control cells .
klt enhances taxol - induced caspases mediated apoptosis caspases are a family of cysteine proteases and are crucial mediators of programmed cell death .
it has been confirmed that cleavage of caspases can be induced by taxol35 .
to further investigate the advantage of the combination of klt and taxol , cleavage of caspase - 3 , caspase - 8 and parp , which are all essential for apoptotic pathways , was analysed by western blotting .
figure 4 shows that taxol induced cleavage of caspase - 3 , caspase - 8 and parp , and klt pretreatment enhanced this effect of taxol , but klt cannot induce obvious cleavage of these proteins by itself .
furthermore , the " klt + taxol " group showed the highest cleavage level of these proteins .
" klt + taxol " pretreated cells have the lowest tumour growth rate in vivo by comparison with tumours acquired from tumour - bearing mice , it was found that " klt + taxol " showed the highest synergism among all combinations ( fig. 6 ) , which is consistent with previous experimental results .
briefly , taxol - pretreated cells had lower growth ability than the control group cells did , but a single treatment with klt did not result in a significant inhibition of tumour growth .
the combination of " taxol + klt " or " taxol & klt " pretreatment further decreased tumour volume but these decrements were lower than those reported for " klt + taxol " .
furthermore , " taxol & klt " had higher synergism than " taxol + klt " did , which was different from our western blot and mtt results .
this may be because in the previous experiments , cells in the group " taxol + klt " were tested 24 h after taxol was added , but cells in the " taxol & klt " group were tested 12 h after taxol was added .
there was no measurement time difference in the mice model , so these results suggested that earlier treatment with klt resulted in higher synergism than the combination of klt and taxol did .

p < 0.05 represents significant difference .
discussion it has been confirmed that klt has anti - tumour effects when it is combined with chemotherapy .
klt can enhance the short - term efficacy when combined with cisplatin and other agents to treat non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) 7 .
furthermore , klt improved efficacy and reduced the side effects of chemotherapy when it was combined with the doc regimen , which consisted of docetaxel ( d ) , oxaliplatin ( o ) , and capecitabine ( c ) , to treat gastric cancer6 .
in a recent study , the synergistic mechanism of pemetrexed followed by klt to treat nsclc cells was analysed .
it was found that coix lacryma - jobi extracts have anti - cancer activities against colorectal cancer cells , but a high concentration was needed .
these compounds have ic50s from 35 microg / ml to more than 500 microg / ml for 48 h treatment36 , or about 100 microg / ml for 24 h treatment37 .
our results showed that lower anti - proliferative activity may be caused by the shorter treatment time ( 12 h ) .
however , the mechanism by which klt enhances chemotherapy efficacy against colorectal cancer remains unclear .
for this reason , four colorectal cancer cell lines were analysed in vitro and in vivo , and our results suggested that the combination " klt + taxol " has a higher synergistic effect than " taxol + klt " or " taxol & klt " do. cancer cells often over - express anti - apoptotic proteins to escape apoptosis , so they have a survival advantage38 .
some conventional anti - tumour agents when used at low concentrations usually upregulate survival signals ; therefore , higher concentrations are needed to kill cancer cells , resulting in serious side effects .
nf - kappabeta is a member of the rel transcription factor family and has critical roles in regulating cell survival , invasion , proliferation , and metastasis .
nf - kappabeta has a specific intracellular inhibitor named ikappabetaalpha , which inactivates nf - kappabeta in the cytoplasm .
it has been reported that taxol can downregulate ikappabetaalpha to promote the nuclear translocation of activated nf - kappabeta18 .
on the contrary , klt can inhibit nf - kappabeta activation13 , 14 , which may be a mechanism by which klt sensitizes cells to taxol .
our results were similar among the four colorectal cancer cell lines , indicating the synergistic effect of klt and taxol .
the mtt assay results showed that all combinations have higher proliferation inhibition rates than " taxol " did , but only " klt + taxol " showed obvious synergism .
this suggests that klt pretreatment can improve taxol cytotoxicity significantly but not when used simultaneously or after treatment with taxol .
we found that klt can upregulate cx43 expression and gjic function .
gjic transfers small water - soluble molecules ( molecular weight < 1 kda ) directly between cells without transporting across the cell membrane39 ; therefore , taxol or other small molecules involved in apoptosis can be transferred through gjic .
taxol inhibits gjic function to counteract its cytotoxicity39 , 40 ; therefore , upregulation of gjic function sensitizes cells to taxol41 .
our experiments confirmed that klt pretreatment increased cx43 expression and gjic function , and taxol treatment can decrease cx43 expression .
the lovo cell line expresses cx4342 , and its gjic function is also increased by klt treatment .
this effect may contribute to high synergism caused by klt pretreatment .
other results of western blot analysis showed that klt enhances some effects of taxol , such as promoting caspases related apoptosis , promoting tubulin polymerization , and upregulating cyclin b1 and survivin expression levels .
it can be noted that single klt treatment decreased survivin expression level in hct106 cells , and increased survivin expression level in other three types of cells , but these variations are small .
it is reported that inactivation of nf - kappabeta did not affect the activation of survivin because upregulation of survivin by taxol is regulated by akt , independent of nf - kappabeta19 , so we speculated that these slight change may due to deviation of western blot experiments .
according to published reports about nf - kappabeta inhibition sensitizing cells to taxol19 , 20 , we suggested that nf - kappabeta inhibition caused by klt is the main reason for synergism observed for the combination treatment in colorectal cancer cell lines .
furthermore , previous studies have shown that long - term pretreatment with a gjic potentiator can obviously enhance cisplatin cytotoxicity , but this enhanced effect requires a relatively long pretreatment time29 , 43 .
cx43 is a structural component of gjic which can transfer small water - soluble molecules ( molecular weight < 1 kda ) directly between cells without passing through cell membrane , so paclitaxel or other small molecules involved in apoptosis can be transferred through gjic .
therefore , we concluded that upregulation of the cx43 expression level contributed to " klt + taxol " having the highest synergism among all combination groups .
binding to tubulin and causing tubulin polymerization are the main molecular mechanisms of taxol cytotoxicity .
" klt + taxol " increased the polymerization rate and resulted in the highest proliferation inhibition rate among the various combinations. from the tubulin polymerization rate and other indices , it was found that the cytotoxicity of " taxol + klt " and " taxol & klt " was higher than that reported for the " taxol " group .
klt pretreatment sensitizes cells to taxol , so there was still some synergism when klt and taxol were used simultaneously .
klt has a low cytotoxicity against colorectal cancer cells , but even though taxol was removed from culture media , taxol absorbed in the cells treated with " taxol + klt " was continuously effective in the following 12 h before testing .
for this reason , " taxol + klt " had an even higher effect than " taxol & klt " , but the effects of " taxol + klt " were lower than " klt + taxol " , which further suggests that " klt + taxol " has the best synergism .
the cellular experiments required the selection of different drug treatment times for each combination of treatment , but there were no different treatment times in the mice model , so tumour volume may more realistically reflect synergism of different combinations .
comparison of tumour volume showed that " taxol & klt " had a greater effect than " taxol + klt " , which suggested that the length of klt treatment is a key influencing factor affecting synergism between klt and taxol .
klt has broad - spectrum anti - tumour activity when it is combined with other chemotherapeutic drugs .
the molecular mechanism of klt and taxol combination on four colorectal cancer cell lines was investigated in this work .
two single agent groups and three combination groups were analysed , which included " klt " , " taxol " , " taxol + klt " , " taxol & klt " , and " klt + taxol " .
we found that klt had little inhibitory effect on colorectal cancer cells but klt pretreatment sensitized cells to taxol significantly .
klt inhibited nf - kappabeta and upregulated cx43 expression , which can both enhance taxol cytotoxicity .
klt pretreatment enhanced some effects of taxol , such as tubulin polymerization , caspase - 3 cleavage , parp cleavage,caspase - 8 cleavage , and increased expression of survivin and cyclin b1 .
our results suggest that " klt + taxol " has the highest synergism .

kanglaite and taxol treatment all four cell lines were treated with various concentrations of klt and taxol , with six different models ( fig. 1 ) : ( 1 ) cells without drug treatment were the control group ; ( 2 ) cells treated with taxol alone for 12 h were named the " taxol " group ; ( 3 ) cells treated with klt alone for 12 h were named the " klt " group ; ( 4 ) cells treated with a mixture of taxol and klt for 12 h were named the " taxol & klt " group ; ( 5 ) cells treated with taxol for 12 h , washed with pbs , and then treated with klt for 12 h were named the " taxol + klt " group ; and ( 6 ) cells treated with klt for 12 h , washed with pbs , and then treated with taxol for 12 h were named the " klt + taxol " group .

briefly , cytosolic protein extraction agent a ( 200 mul ) with 1 mm pmsf was added to havested cells ( 20 mul ) at 4 degreesc .
the cells were resuspended by vortexing vigorously for 10 s. after 15 min incubation on ice , 10 mul cytosolic protein extraction agent b was added , and the tubes were vortexed vigorously for 5 s. after 1 min incubation on ice , tubes were vortexed vigorously for 5 s , and then centrifuged for 5 min at 15000 g at 4 degreesc .
the supernatant , containing the cytoplasmic fraction , was removed into clean , pre - chilled tubes on ice and stored at - 80 degreesc until use .
the insoluble pellet containing the nuclear fraction was resuspended in nuclear protein extraction agent ( 50 mul ) with 1 mm pmsf , vortexed vigorously for 20 s and incubated on ice for 30 min .
during this incubation , the tubes were vortexed for 15 s every 5 min for six times in total .
the tubes were then centrifuged at 15000 g for 10 min at 4 degreesc .
the supernatant , which contained the nuclear fraction , was transferred to clean , pre - chilled tubes on ice and stored at - 80 degreesc until use .
for detection of other proteins , 106 harvested cells were lysed with 500 ml ripa lysis buffer containing a protein inhibitor for 20 minutes on ice .
the cell lysates were centrifuged and protein content in supernatants was quantitated by bicinchoninic acid reagents .
protein samples were suspended in sds - loading buffer and boiled .
protein ( 10 mug ) was then run on sds - page gels and transferred to an immobilon membrane by a semi - dry blotting method .
the membrane was probed with primary and secondary antibodies successively using standard techniques .
finally , the signals were visualized by ecl and the membranes were exposed to film .
each assay was performed in triplicate .
immunocytochemistry analysis immunofluorescence staining was adapted to analyse tubulin polymerization and nf - kappabeta activation , which were both induced by taxol .
in brief , cells were washed gently with pbs to remove culture medium , fixed with 10 % formalin at room temperature for 20 minutes , treated with 0.5 % triton x - 100 for 5 min at 4 degreesc , and then blocked with 5 % normal goat serum overnight at 4 degreesc .
the slides were washed with pbs and incubated with an anti - alpha - tubulin antibody for 1 h at 37 degreesc .
after washing with pbs , the slides were incubated with fitc - conjugated antibody for 1 h at 37 degreesc .
subsequently , the slides were washed with pbs to remove antibody and sealed .
the coverslips were photographed immediately using an olympus fluorescence microscope ( olympus , japan ) .
" parachute " dye - coupling assay functional gjic was examined by the " parachute " dye - coupling assay , which was described by wang et al.28 .
cells were seeded in 6 - well plates and grown to 80 - 100 % culture density where gjic formation was possible .
two fluorescent dyes , cm - dil and calcein - am , were used to detect gjic function .
cm - dil cannot spread to coupled cells but calcein - am can be converted intracellularly to calcein , which is a gjic - permeable dye .
donor cells of each well were stained with 5 mug / ml cm - dil and 10 mug / ml calcein - am for 30 minutes at 37 degreesc .
subsequently , donor cells were washed with pbs to remove unincorporated dye and trypsinized to be seeded onto a monolayer of receiver cells grown in another well .
the ratio of donor to receiver cells was 1:150 .
after 4 h incubation at 37 degreesc , gjics were formed between donor and receiver cells and were detected by an olympus fluorescence microscope ( olympus , japan ) .
red fluorescence of cm - dil was used to locate donor cells .
calcein - am emitted green fluorescence and was used to calculate the average number of illuminant receiver cells around each donor cell .
this average number was used to evaluate gjic function .
it should be noted that trypsinized donor cells hardly adhere to the new dish surface if they have been treated by taxol .
therefore , we only measured the effect of klt treatment on gjic function .
subcutaneous tumour model a subcutaneous tumour model was used to evaluate inhibition effect of klt + taxol treatment on tumours in vivo .
to prepare ct26 tumour cells for injection , cells were treated with different drug combinations : " control " , " taxol " , " klt " , " taxol + klt " , " taxol & klt " , and " klt + taxol " .
in each group , the amount of taxol used was 3 nm and the amount of klt used was 10 microg / ml. the treatment time for all groups is the same as that described in " kanglaite and taxol treatment " .
treated cells were trypsinized and about 106 cells were subcutaneously inoculated into the flanks of the mice ( balb / c , six - week - old , female ) .
five mice were used per group .
tumours were allowed to develop for 15 days .
mice were sacrificed , and tumours were removed to compare their volume .
callipers were used to measure tumour size .
tumour volume was estimated as : l x s2 / 2 , where " l " represents the larger diameter and " s " represents the smaller diameter .
principles of laboratory animal care were followed and all procedures were conducted according to the guidelines established by the national institutes of health , and every effort was made to minimize suffering .
this study was approved by the tianjin union medical center animal studies committee .

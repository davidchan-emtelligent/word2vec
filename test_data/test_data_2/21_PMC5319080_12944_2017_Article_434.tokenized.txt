keywords triglyceride cholesterol overweight regression back propagation artificial neural network national science and technology major project2012zx10002004 cao hongcui issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background a survey of world health organization ( who ) completed in 2014 revealed there 39 % of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight in the world .
in china , the overweight people have increased from 1.8 to 11.9 % in the period from 1985 to 2005 [ 1 ] .
a cross - sectional survey of adolescents ( ages 18 - 25 ) in american showed the rates of overweight and obesity ( bmi >/= 25 ) were 21.3 % and 10.8 % [ 2 ] .
in europe in 2010 the highest prevalence of obesity among adults aged > 15 years for men ( 30 %) in greece , and for women in greece and the united kingdom ( 26 %) [ 3 ] .
the high dyslipidaemia is an elevation of lipids in the blood , that is , elevation of triglyceride ( tg ) , cholesterol ( tc ) and / or fat phospholipids .
the elevated serum tg and / or tc are associated with a series of symptomatic vascular disease such as peripheral arterial and coronary artery disease , atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype , hypertension , insulin resistance , and glucose intolerance , and [ 4 - 7 ] .
high level of tg (> 11.3 mmol / l ]) can cause acute pancreatitis , the tg level serve as an important indicator to determine the prognosis of patients with acute biliary pancreatitis [ 8 , 9 ] .
tg to high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio > or = 3.0 ( in mg / dl ) is a marker of insulin resistance in overweight [ 10 ] .
there are no direct symptoms in the vast majority of cases with high tg and tc , the blood test is the only way to diagnose whether the tg and tc is too high .
in clinical practice , tg and tc , blood glucose , liver function , and kidney function are determined independently .
commonly , few people will monitor them simultaneously .
if we can find the relevance between the tg , tc with blood glucose , liver function , and kidney function .
it will be convenient for us to assess the level of tg and tc when we had a test of blood glucose , liver function , and kidney function .
being overweight is at high risk for high dyslipidaemia .
therefore , monitoring and prediction of tg and tc level is necessary in overweight people for early discovery and timely treatment .
in this study , 346 subjects ( 254 male and 92 female ) overweight people were analyzed by correlation analysis and multiple linear regression ( mrl ) .
in order to calculate the level of tg and tc , a back propagation artificial neural network ( bp - ann ) model of tg and tc was developed in overweight people .
bp - ann is a kind of artificial neural network , which is composed of input layer , hidden layer , and output layer [ 11 ] .
input layer represents the raw data , hidden layer accepts data from the input layer and modifies them using some algorithm .
after processed in hidden layer , the new information is sent to the output layer .
it is generally presented as systems of interconnected " neurons " which exchange messages between each other .
the connections between input , hidden , and output layer have numeric weights that can be tuned and making neural nets adaptive to inputs and capable of learning [ 12 ] .
bp - ann has been widely used in medical field , such as analyzing the risk factors of diabetes mellitus , prediction of hemoglobin levels , alzheimer 's disease screening [ 13 - 15 ] .
methods subjects this study was approved by the first affiliated hospital of wenzhou medical university and conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki .
the participants included in this study were divided into healthy people and overweight people according to the bmi ( 25.0 - 30 kg / m2 ) recommended by world health organization .
the subject 's height was measured by using a stadiometer and weight using an electronic weighing scale with the participant wearing foam slippers and a shirt and pants .
the subjects were excluded from this study if they had any history of diseases , such as hematopathy , angiocardiopathy , hepatopathy , nephrosis and pulmonary diseases .
blood biochemistry examination the participants were randomly assigned to a clinical laboratory at physical examination center .
a total of 3 ml fasting venous blood were collected into separation gel tubes and separated in a desk centrifuge at 5000 r / min for 10 min .
after that , the plasma was analyzed at hitachi 705 / 717 biochemical measurement .
the fasting ( fs ) biochemical indexes of liver function , kidney function , blood glucose ( fs - glu ) , triglyceride ( fs - tg ) , and total cholesterol ( fs - tc ) were determined .
the indexes of liver function included : alanine transaminase ( fs - alt ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( fs - alt ) , gamma - glutamyl transpeptidase ( fs - ggt ) , total protein ( fs - tp ) , albumin ( fs - alb ) , alkaline phosphatase ( fs - akp ) , total bilirubin ( fs - tbil ) , and direct bilirubin ( fs - dbil ) .
the indexes of kidney function were creatinine ( fs - cr ) , urea nitrogen ( fs - bun ) , and uric acid ( fs - ua ) .
statistical analysis according to the value of bmi , all subjects were divided into two groups , healthy people and overweight people .
the distribution characteristic of the measuring data was analyzed by shapiro - wilk test and homogeneity test of variances .
the difference of biochemical indexes between healthy people and overweight people was analyzed according to the normal distribution test .
the relationships of fs - tg and fs - tc level with liver , kidney and fs - glu were analyzed by bivariate correlation .
mrl analysis was used to identify factors related to the fs - tg and fs - tc. all biochemical indexes of liver , kidney and fs - glu were subjected to mrl analyses .
all biochemical indexes data of them were statistically analyzed by using the spss software 17 .
the p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance in all analyses .
in order to convince the correlation between fs - tg and fs - tc with liver , kidney and fs - glu test .
the variable importance in the projection ( vip ) in modeling regression model was assessed by partial least squares analysis ( pls ) .
bp - ann prediction model the fs - tg , fs - tc and relevant correlated biochemical indexes were employed into the bp - ann .
when developing fs - tg model , the correlated biochemical indexes were selected as the input layer , and the output layer was fs - tg level .
when developing fs - tc model , the correlated biochemical indexes were selected as the input layer , and the output layer was fs - tc level .
the transfer function of the hidden layers nodes and output layer nodes was tansig and purelin .
the node numbers of hidden layer were calculated based on the formula of \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ m =\ sqrt { n + l }+ a $$\ end { document } m = n + l + a , where m is the number of the nodes in the hidden layer , and n is the number of nodes in the input layer , l is the number of nodes in the output layer , a is a constant from 1 to 10 [ 9 , 16 ] .
the bp - ann model of fs - tg and fs - tc were established at matlab r2011a .
results characteristics of healthy and overweight there are 302 healthy subjects and 273 overweight subjects enrolled in this study , the mean age were 40.34 +/ - 9.31 and 45.79 +/ - 11.06 year , bmi were 21.36 +/ - 1.44 and 26.01 +/ - 1.01 .
the shapiro - wilk test showed that most of indexes , except for tb and alb , were abnormal distribution in two different groups .
thererfore , the difference of biochemical indexes between two groups was analyzed by mann - whitney method of two - independent - sample - test in nonparameter test , the results showed there was significant difference for all biochemical indexes ( table 1 ) .

the correlation coefficient was used to identify the relationship between tg , tc and related indexes .
the results showed there was different correlation of tg , tc in healthy and overweight .
for example , fs - tc correlated with fs - glu in healthy ( p = 0.005 ) , it lost correlation with fs - glu in overweight ( p = 0.064 ) .
in overweight , there was high relationship between fs - tg and weight , height , bmi , fs - glu , fs - alt , fs - ast , fs - gtt , fs - tb , fs - alb , fs - cr , fs - akp , fs - ua ; while fs - tc was correlated with age , fs - alt , fs - ast , fs - gtt , fs - dbil ( table 2 ) .
the pls was performed by using " eigs " to find a few eigenvalues and eigenvectors and " corrcoef " to calculate the correlation coefficients .
the results showed there was similar correlation of tg , tc in healthy and overweight , the most important variables ( vip > 1 ) was fs - ua , followed by height , fs - tb , fs - akp , fs - cr , weight , fs - alb , age , which was consistent with the results of spearman 's test .
the vip figures of correlated indexes in modeling tg , tc regression model were showed in additional file 1 .

bp - ann prediction model of fs - tg and fs - tc according to the results of correlation analysis , weight , height , fs - alt , fs - gtt , fs - cr , fs - akp , fs - ua ; fs - dbil , fs - tbil , and fs - alb were selected as input layer , fs - tg was set as output layer .
as for fs - tc , age , fs - alt , fs - ast , fs - gtt , fs - tb , fs - dbil , were selected as input layer .
the training epoch was set at 1000 , training goal was set at 0.5 x 10 - 5 .
after training , the bp - ann model of fs - tg was reached the training goal at 53 epochs .
the fs - tc model did n't reach the goal , however , it showed high accuracy after training 1000 epochs .
the performance of bp - ann model of fs - tg and fs - tc were evaluated by mean square error ( mse ) , magnitude of the gradient , the number of validation checks , correlation coefficient .
the best training performance of fs - tg was 4.7 x 10 - 5 at epoch 53 ( r = 0.9997 ) , the fs - tc was 1.1 x 10 - 3 at epoch 1000 ( r = 0.9922 ) .
the gradient and validation checks of modeling fs - tg and fs - tc was showed in fig. 1. the predicted and measured profiles of fs - tg and fs - tc in test group were showed in fig. 2 , which clearly indicated that the developed bp - ann models were reached high accuracy in prediction of fs - tg and fs - tc. fig. 1 the fitness index of bp - ann model of fs - tg achieved at epoch 53 ( a ) , fs - tc achieved at epoch 1000 ( b ) performed in overweight people fig. 2 the measured concentrations ("+") of fs - tg ( a ) , fs - tc ( b ) and predicted concentrations (" o ") of fs - tg , fs - tc generated by bp - ann model in overweight people .
the training goal was set at 1.5 x 10 - 5 discussion fasting tg and tc is very important index in clinical practice .
the doctor can diagnose whether the patient had hyperlipemia according to the results of serum lipid and lipoprotein test .
as overweight people have high risk for hyperlipidemia , which will cause heart attack or stroke [ 17 ] , they should pay attention to tg and tc levels and monitor them frequently .
however , the determination of tg and tc was separated from blood glucose , liver function , and kidney function test which are routinely monitored in clinical practice .
the independent determination of tg and tc is inconvenient and increases the medical costs .
therefore , development of prediction model of tg and tc by indexes of blood glucose , liver function , and kidney function will be useful in clinical practice. and assessing the correlation of tg and tc with blood glucose , liver function , and kidney function test will be contribute to understand the mechanism of high dyslipidaemia , especially for overweight people .
in the present study , we developed prediction models of tg and tc according to the fasting ( fs ) biochemical indexes .
firstly , we analyzed the relationships between fs - tg , fs - tc and indexes of age , weight , height , bmi , blood glucose , liver function , and kidney function .
the related parameters were included as independent variable for linear regression .
the mrl showed only fs - alt , fs - ua and fs - ggt were related to fs - tg , and fs - dbil , fs - gtt , age , fs - tb were related to fs - tc , the other indexes were excluded from the regression model although they showed high correlation with fs - tg and fs - tc in correlation analysis .
although the developed regression equation of mrl for fs - tg and fs - tc had statistical significance ( p < 0.01 ) , the multiple correlation coefficient of them were r = 0.407 and r = 0.434 .
in order to obtain more precise value of prediction , we introduced artificial neural network .
artificial neural network is a new modeling approach inspired by a brain 's central nervous system and has capable of machine learning , such as supervised learning , unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning .
it has been used to diagnose diseases such as cancers or predict the outcome of treatment in medical area [ 18 - 20 ] .
back propagation is a kind of algorithms for training artificial neural networks .
it is a fundamental and is a commonly used algorithm that instructs an ann how to carry out a given task [ 21 ] .
the predictive ability based on the correlation between input data and output data .
in theory , the more relevant vector factors in input layer , the higher accuracy of prediction in bp - ann model [ 22 ] .
in our study , when the training goal was set at 0.5 x 10 - 5 , the bp - ann model of fs - tg was far more quickly reached the goal than fs - tc and showed well accuracy .
this is consistent with the correlation analysis of fs - tg and fs - tc , as fs - tg related to more biochemical indexes than fs - tc. although , fs - tc did n't reach the training goal within 1000 epochs , it still well performed ( r = 0.9987 ). that indicated the bp - ann model of fs - tc can also achieve high accuracy when selected age , fs - alt , fs - ast , fs - gtt , fs - tb , fs - dbil as input layer .
conclusion there was high relationship of fs - tg and fs - tc with biochemical indexes , fs - tg was related to fs - glu , fs - alt , fs - ast , fs - gtt , fs - tb , fs - alb , fs - cr , fs - akp , fs - ua ; while fs - tc was correlated with fs - alt , fs - ast , fs - gtt , fs - dbil ( p < 0.01 ) .
moreover , correlation analysis showed fs - tg was related to weight , height , bmi , while fs - tc was correlated with age .
the mrl analysis indicated that only fs - alt , fs - ua , and fs - ggt were related to fs - tg , while fs - dbil , fs - gtt , age , and fs - tb were related to fs - tc. based on correlation analysis , the bp - ann models of fs - tg and fs - tc were developed which achieved high prediction accuracy and can be used to predict the level of fs - tg and fs - tc in blood .

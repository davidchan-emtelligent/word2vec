background the potential involvement of viruses in inflammatory airway disease ( iad ) was previously investigated through either serology or pcr from nasopharyngeal swabs ( ns ) .
the aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and incidence of viral genome detection by qpcr in the equine airways , and their association with respiratory clinical signs .
methods both ns and tracheal washes ( tw ) were collected monthly on 52 standardbred racehorses at training , over 27 consecutive months ( 581 samples ) .
equid herpesviruses ( ehv ) - 1 , - 4 , - 2 and - 5 , equine rhinitis virus - a and - b ( erbv ) , equine adenovirus - 1 and - 2 , equine coronavirus and equine influenza virus were systematically investigated in both ns and tw. nasal discharge , coughing , tracheal mucus score and tw neutrophil proportions were simultaneously recorded .
results genome for 7 / 10 viruses were detected at least once throughout the study ; up to 4 different viruses being also concomitantly detected .
monthly incidence in tw was respectively 27.9 % ( ehv - 5 ) , 24.8 % ( ehv - 2 ) , 7.1 % ( erbv ) , 3.8 % ( ehv - 4 ) , 1.9 % ( eadv1 ) and 0.2 % ( ehv - 1 ; erav ) .
neither agreement nor correlation between ns and tw was found for respectively genome detection and viral loads .
detection of viral genome in ns was not associated with any clinical sign .
coughing was significantly associated with tw detection of ehv - 2 dna ( or 3.1 ; p = 0.01 ) and erbv rna ( or 5.3 ; p < 0.001 ) .
detection of ehv - 2 dna in tw was also significantly associated with excess tracheal mucus ( or 2.1 ; p = 0.02 ) .
conclusions detection and quantification of ehv - 2 and erbv by qpcr in tw , but not in ns , should be considered when investigating horses with iad .

keywords equine rhinitis virus - b qpcr tracheal wash coughing inflammatory airway disease zoetisfedercrbnifceissue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background lower airway troubles and especially inflammatory airway disease ( iad ) represent one of the main causes of poor - performance for racehorses [ 1 ] .
this syndrome , which may affect horses of any age , is clinically characterised by chronic occasional coughing with normal breathing at rest [ 2 , 3 ] .
diagnostic confirmation requires the documentation of either excess tracheobronchial mucus or abnormal profiles on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( balf ) cytology [ 4 ] .
one of the exclusion criteria for iad is the evidence of systemic signs of infection [ 3 , 4 ] .
among various extrinsic risk - factors , increased proportions of bacteria ( mainly streptococcus zooepidemicus and actinobacillus / pasteurella spp. ) isolated from tracheal wash ( tw ) have repeatedly been associated with clinical signs of iad in both young and older thoroughbred racehorses [ 5 , 6 ] .
the recently revised consensus statement on equine iad pointed out the lack of conclusive evidence of a relationship between viral infections with this syndrome [ 4 ] .
experimental inoculations recently performed with either equine rhinitis virus - a ( erav ) or equid herpesvirus - 2 ( ehv - 2 ) leaded to the observation of respiratory clinical signs and / or abnormal cytological profiles that persisted for up to 21 days after challenge [ 7 , 8 ] .
the potential implication of different viruses in airway inflammation and / or poor racing performance has also been previously investigated in an epidemiological manner .
these studies were either based on serological analyses [ 9 - 11 ] , or more recently on direct detection of viral genome by pcr in nasal swabs or balf samples [ 12 , 13 ] .
while a significant association has recently been found between seropositivity to erav and diagnosis of iad [ 13 ] , the use of antibody titres largely appeared to be of limited value in the clinical context of this syndrome [ 6 , 14 ] .
positive pcr for ehv - 2 in nasal swabs , but not in balf , was also significantly associated with diagnosis of iad in a recent case - control study [ 13 ] .
conversely , clinical signs of respiratory disease were not associated with either the presence or the level of shedding of ehv - 2 in nasal swabs [ 12 ] .
to date , the use of quantitative pcr on respiratory samples in relation to iad has been described for a very limited number of viruses only [ 12 ] .
furthermore , no epidemiological data on viral loads from tracheal samples are currently available , while previously found to be potentially relevant in experimental conditions [ 7 , 8 ] .
the aims of this study were to determine : 1 ) the prevalence and incidence of viral genome detection in the respiratory tract of racehorses at training ; 2 ) correlations between viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs ( ns ) and tw ; and 3 ) the association between virus detection / quantification and clinical signs of airway inflammation .
we hypothesised that respiratory viruses might be significant risk - factors of iad .
methods study design a cohort of french standardbred trotters was investigated on a monthly basis ( 3 to 5 weeks ) over 27 consecutive months ( november 2012 - january 2015 ) .
three veterinary practitioners located in normandy ( france ) systematically visited a total of 8 different training yards ( respectively 3 , 3 and 2 each ) .
among these , 4 yards participated for the whole period , 2 declined after respectively 4 and 10 months and were replaced by 2 others yards . at the time of inclusion , 5 horses per yard were randomly selected among those complying with the inclusion criteria : at least 2 years old ; in active training or racing ; free of any clinical sign of respiratory disease .
any horse leaving the yard during the longitudinal study was replaced by another one from the same yard , in accordance with the inclusion criteria .
sampling and data collection horses were examined and sampled either at rest or at least 2 h after any exercise .
venous blood samples were collected for haematological assessment , in order to rule out any systemic disease .
although being clinically healthy at the time of inclusion , some horses eventually became clinically affected throughout the study .
presence of respiratory clinical signs , including nasal discharge and coughing at the time of sampling time was then systematically noticed .
tracheal mucus was systematically scored ( grade 1 - 5 ) , according to the previously published scale [ 15 ] .
ns were taken from the nasopharynx using tailor - made 40 cm long stems ended with a 3 cm long and 1 cm diameter cotton swab ( coveto , montaigu , france ) , and immediately placed into 4 ml of transport medium .
tw were collected trans - endoscopically [ 7 ] , by instilling and re - aspirating 40 ml of sterile isotonic saline , and kept in serum tubes for bacteriology and edta tubes for respectively cytology and molecular biology .
all samples were kept refrigerated and immediately sent to the laboratory for processing within 24 h after collection .
cytology and bacteriology for each tw , 200 mul of fluid was systematically cytocentrifuged ( 80 g , 10 min ; shandon cytospin , waltham , usa ) and stained with may - grunwald - giemsa .
differential cell counts were performed on 300 leukocytes .
standard quantitative bacterial investigations were also performed on tw [ 16 ] .
identification and quantification were performed only on samples exhibiting up to 3 different strains .
samples with isolation counts < 104 colony - forming units ( cfu )/ ml were considered as negative .
isolated bacteria were classified as either common pathogens or commensals [ 17 ] .
molecular biology all qpcr have been validated in respiratory samples , based on the nf - u - 47600 - 2 afnor norm [ 18 ] .
detection of the following viruses have been assessed ( additional file 1 ) : equid herpesvirus ( ehv ) - 1 , - 4 , - 2 and - 5 ; equine rhinitis virus - a ( erav ) , equine rhinitis virus - b ( erbv , now erbovirus a ) ; equine adenovirus ( eadv ) - 1 and - 2 ( now equine mastadenovirus - a and - b ) ; equine coronavirus ( ecov ) and equine influenza virus ( eiv ) .
respectively 2 ml of ns transport medium and 10 ml of tw were centrifuged ( 2000 g ; 15 min ; 4 degreesc ) , and pellets were re - suspended with 500 mul of supernatant .
extraction of dna / rna was made from 140 mul of each sample , using the qiaamp ( r ) rna viral mini kit ( qiagen , courtaboeuf , france ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
concentrated dna / rna was then stored at - 80 degreesc until used .
virus - specific qpcr were performed in a total volume of 25 mul , and included a negative control ( distilled water ) and serial dilutions of synthetic dna / rna ( respectively plasmids and transcripts of plasmids for each targeted region ) .
amplification of the synthetic sequence " myic " [ 19 ] was also performed , to confirm absence of pcr inhibitors in the nucleic acid extracts .
as previously described [ 20 ] , viral loads for each respiratory fluid were expressed without normalisation against a preselected cell number or amount of dna .
based on the nf - u - 47600 - 2 afnor norm , all respiratory samples have systematically been classified , for each investigated virus , in one of the following groups : ' negative ' , when no characteristic amplification curve was present ; ' positive ' ( detection ) , when the characteristic amplification curve was present .
the ' positive ' group has also been divided in the 2 following subcategories : ' non - quantifiable ' , when the viral load was < limit of quantification ( loq ) ; ' quantifiable ' ( quantification ) , when the viral load was >= loq .
statistical analysis descriptive statistics were performed for all relevant variables .
both overall prevalence and monthly incidence were determined , and binomial 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) calculated .
continuous data which were not normally distributed , as assessed by shapiro - wilk w test , were log 10 transformed to normalise distribution and presented as ' median ( 1st - 3rd quartile )' .
correlation between viral loads and measure of agreement for ns and tw were evaluated using pearson 's coefficient and cohen 's kappa coefficient ( kappa ) , respectively .
association between detection / quantification of pathogens and clinical / diagnostic variables for airway inflammation were assessed using chi2 test , and calculation of corresponding odds ratio ( or ) .
data analyses were conducted using prism 6 ( graphpad , la jolla , usa ) and ncss 9 ( nss - llc , kaysville , usa ) software .
values of p < 0.05 were considered significant .
results study population a total of 52 horses contributed to the study , and 581 samplings have been conducted over the period .
the median number of months in which the same horse has been sampled is 9.5 months ( 5.0 - 17.0 ; fig. 1 ) .
the cohort was composed by 24 geldings , 16 females and 12 males , with a median age of 4.0 ( 3.0 - 5.0 ) years at the time of recruitment. fig. 1 frequency distribution of number of months contributed to the study ( n = 52 horses ) clinical signs and airway inflammation clinical signs were recorded for 424 / 581 ( 73.0 %) samplings .
the overall prevalence of coughing and nasal discharge was 6.1 % ( ci 4.7 - 7.8 ) with incidence rates of 4.5 ( ci 3.3 - 6.0 ) and 5.4 ( ci 4.1 - 7.0 ) new cases / 100 horses / month , respectively .
the overall prevalence of excess tracheal mucus ( score >= 2 / 5 ) was 19.1 % ( ci 16.7 - 21.7 ) with an incidence rate of 15.9 new cases / 100 horses / month ( ci 13.7 - 18.3 ) .
similarly , the overall prevalence of increased tw neutrophil proportions (> 30 %) was 54.2 % ( ci 51.1 - 57.3 ) with an incidence rate of 29.1 new cases / 100 horses / month ( ci 26.3 - 32.0 ) .
isolation and quantification of bacteria in tw overall , 411 / 581 ( 70.7 %) tw samples were negative (< 104 cfu / ml ) , and 18 / 581 ( 3.1 %) exhibited > 3 different bacterial strains .
common pathogens have been identified in 14 / 581 ( 2.4 %) tw samples ( table 1 ) , with commensals also concomitantly isolated in 13 / 14 ( 92.9 %) samples .

in total , 183 / 581 ( 31.5 %) tw were ' negative ' , and at least one virus has been detected in 398 / 581 ( 68.5 %) tw samples .
among these , genome of one single virus has been detected in 233 / 398 ( 58.5 %) samples , and dna / rna of up to 4 different viruses have been concomitantly detected in the other 165 / 398 ( 41.5 %) tw ( fig. 2b ) .
the overall prevalence of viral genome detection in tw is summarised in table 2 , and respective viral loads detailed in fig. 3b .
incidences of ' positive ' tw samples / 100 horses / month were respectively 27.9 ( ci 25.1 - 30.8 ) for ehv - 5 , 24.8 ( ci 22.2 - 27.6 ) for ehv - 2 , 7.1 ( ci 5.6 - 8.9 ) for erbv , 3.8 ( ci 2.7 - 5.2 ) for ehv - 4 , 1.9 ( ci 1.1 - 3.0 ) for eadv - 1 , 0.2 ( ci 0.0 - 0.7 ) for ehv - 1 and 0.2 ( ci 0.0 - 0.7 ) for erav .
incidences of ' quantifiable ' tw samples / 100 horses / month were respectively 14.8 ( ci 12.7 - 17.2 ) for ehv - 5 , 12.2 ( ci 10.2 - 14.4 ) for ehv - 2 , 2.6 ( ci 1.7 - 3.8 ) for erbv , 1.5 ( ci 0.8 - 2.5 ) for ehv - 4 and 0.2 ( ci 0.0 - 0.7 ) for erav .
ns vs. tw for genome detection and viral loads very poor agreements only , according to kappa coefficients , were found between paired samples ( ns and tw ) for the detection of each viral genome by qpcr (' positive ' vs. ' negative ' ; [ additional file 3 ]) .
when concerning ' quantifiable ' samples only , no significant correlation was found among viral loads in paired samples ( ns and tw ) for any of the investigated viruses .
pathogens vs. clinical signs and airway inflammation detection of ehv - 2 dna in tw was significantly associated with coughing ( or 3.1 ; 95 % ci : 1.4 - 7.1 ; p = 0.01 ) , as were both detection ( or 5.3 ; ci 2.1 - 14.0 ) and quantification ( or 15.0 ; ci 3.8 - 60.1 ) of erbv rna in tw ( p < 0.001 ) .
isolation of commensal bacteria in tw was also significantly associated with coughing ( or 2.7 ; ci 1.20 - 6.2 ; p = 0.02 ) .
there was no association between any virus or bacteria in tw and nasal discharge .
similarly , there was no significant association between either viral genome detection or quantification in ns and any clinical sign of respiratory disease .
quantification of at least one virus in tw (' quantifiable ' sample ) was significantly associated with tw neutrophil counts > 30 % ( or 1.5 ; ci 1.1 - 2.2 ; p = 0.03 ) .
detection of ehv - 2 dna in tw was significantly associated with excess tracheal mucus ( or 2.1 ; ci 1.2 - 3.8 ; p = 0.02 ) .
viral loads for ehv - 2 in tw were also fairly correlated with neutrophil proportions ( r = 0.32 ; ci 0.12 - 0.51 ; p = 0.003 ) .
conversely , isolation of commensal bacteria was negatively associated with tw neutrophil counts > 30 % ( or 0.6 ; ci 0.4 - 0.9 ; p = 0.02 ) .
there was no association between tracheal mucus score >= 2 / 5 and any other virus or bacteria in tw , or any viral genome detection / quantification in ns. discussion this study provided incidence and prevalence of viral genome detection by qpcr and corresponding viral loads in both ns and tw of horses at training .
in total , 7 of the 10 viruses investigated have been detected at least once in respiratory samples .
along with eadv - 2 and ecov , eiv genome has never been found in ns or tw throughout the study .
this latter was not unexpected since all horses were in active training and racing , and thus vaccinated ( every 6 months ) at the time of sampling .
alternatively , up to 4 different viral genomes have been concomitantly detected in either ns or tw. previous studies documented concurrent infections between erbv and either ehv - 4 [ 21 ] , gamma - herpesviruses [ 21 , 22 ] , or eiv [ 23 ] .
to our knowledge , the present study is the first to report concomitant genome detection of eadv - 1 along with erbv , ehv - 1 or ehv - 4 .
among other bacteria , a relatively low prevalence was found for isolation of streptococcus zooepidemicus in tw , when compared with previous longitudinal studies [ 10 , 11 ] .
however , cut - off values of 104 cfu / ml have been used for discriminating negative and positive samples , as described previously [ 24 ] .
similarly , identification and quantification have also been performed only on samples with up to 3 different strains .
a moderate even significant association between identification of commensals , but not streptococcus zooepidemicus , was significantly associated with coughing in the present study .
this unexpected finding suggests that high counts of commensal bacteria in the trachea of athletic horses might opportunistically become pathogenic , along with other viral or environmental challenges .
conversely , coughing has been associated with tw isolation of streptococcus zooepidemicus or pasteurellaceae spp. in a previous case - control study [ 9 ] ; the odds of airway inflammation being also significantly increased along with cfu / ml [ 5 , 6 , 24 ] .
genome detection for gamma - herpesviruses ( ehv - 2 , ehv - 5 ) was highly prevalent in the present longitudinal study , which is in accordance with previously published data [ 12 , 25 ] .
despite a moderately lower monthly incidence , both ehv - 2 and ehv - 5 have been detected on at least one occasion for all 52 horses of the study .
due to their capability of viral latency , it might then be determined that each of these horses was a permanent carrier for both ehv - 2 and ehv - 5 .
previously published data also revealed that multiple strains of ehv - 2 might be concomitantly detected in nasal swabs or tw of a single horse [ 7 , 26 ] .
however , no phylogeny has been performed for further characterising the strains detected among time in the present study .
detection of ehv - 2 dna in tw has been associated with coughing and excess tracheal mucus , and viral loads significantly correlated to tw neutrophil proportions .
these data confirm previous cytological findings from experimentally induced ehv - 2 reactivation [ 7 ] ; and are also coherent with a recent case - control study in which nasal shedding of ehv - 2 was significantly associated with diagnosis of iad [ 13 ] .
based on the growing evidence of its implication in lower airway inflammation ; elucidating the underlying ehv - 2 pathogenesis warrants further investigation .
on the other hand , ehv - 5 detection , quantification or viral loads in either ns or tw have not been associated with coughing , nasal discharge nor airway inflammation in this study .
such observation might however not be surprising , since ehv - 5 has repeatedly been detected in asymptomatic horses [ 25 , 27 ] .
alternatively , the clinical signs frequently reported for equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis , an ehv - 5 associated chronic disease , include intermittent fever , weight loss and respiratory distress [ 28 ] .
genome detection for erbv in tw has been significantly associated with coughing in this study , with an increasing or when higher viral loads were considered .
the prevalence of erbv rna quantification presently found in ns was slightly higher than previous data [ 12 ] , which might be partially explained by the differences in sampling methodologies ( nasal vs. nasopharyngeal swabs ) and qpcr assays .
conversely , the monthly incidence of ' quantifiable ' samples for erbv was comparable to previously reported serological results , based on complement fixation tests [ 11 ] .
it has however been recently found that detection of erbv rna by pcr in nasal swabs might not coincide with seroconversion [ 14 ] .
besides , the low prevalence of erav rna detection in ns or tw was somehow unexpected , since being previously associated with acute clinical cases of respiratory diseases [ 29 ] .
in addition , a high seroprevalence has been previously described worldwide for this virus [ 30 ] and vaccination is currently not available in europe .
in accordance with results from a previous longitudinal study [ 14 ] , no significant association was found between any viral genome detection / quantification in ns and clinical signs , excess tracheal mucus or increased tw neutrophil proportions .
interestingly , neither agreement nor correlation has been found between paired samples ( ns and tw ) , for genome detection or viral loads of any investigated virus .
in terms of subclinical infectious diseases , findings from upper airways ( ns ) cannot be considered as representative of lower airways ( tw ) in the same horse .
moreover , viral genome detection in ns seems not to be relevant in the clinical context of iad , unlike acute infectious airway troubles [ 22 , 29 ] .
it might then be recommended to perform qpcr in tw samples for any virus detection on horses at training , as previously suggested for a limited number of herpesviruses [ 31 ] .
one limitation of the present study would be the lack of virus isolation or serological assays in addition to the qpcr performed in respiratory fluids .
the demonstration of increased antibody titres however requires two consecutive samplings with a 3 to 4 - week interval , which is irrelevant on the field for any concomitant diagnosis of iad .
apart from viruses and bacteria , non - infectious agents are also likely to be relevant to the development of iad in horses [ 4 ] .
another limitation would then be the absence of environmental investigations within the different training yards throughout the study .
ultra - fine particles (< 10 mum ) within the breathing zone of the horse were indeed recently found to be significant risk - factors for excess mucus and increased tw neutrophil proportions [ 32 ] .
conclusions detection of erbv rna by qpcr in airway samples was prevalent in the present study , and also significantly associated with occurrence of coughing in racehorses at training .
sampling ns only is not sufficient for characterising the clinical relevance of any viral genome detection or quantification .
systematically performing qpcr in tw samples should be recommended , along with other clinical and laboratory investigations , in order to identify any viral component potentially associated with iad .

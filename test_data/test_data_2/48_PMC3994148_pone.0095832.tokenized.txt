introduction ionic liquids ( ils ) have attracted much attention in recent years as interesting soft materials including solvents [ 1 ] - [ 7 ] , catalysts [ 8 ] - [ 15 ] , lubricants [ 16 ] , electrolytes [ 17 ] - [ 21 ] , extractants [ 22 ] - [ 23 ] , magnetic fluids [ 24 ] - [ 26 ] , optical fluids [ 27 ] - [ 28 ] , and propellants [ 29 ] - [ 33 ] .
compared with conventional molecular solvents , ils have unique physical properties such as high thermal stability , large liquidus range , negligible vapor pressure , and wide electrochemical window [ 34 ] - [ 36 ] .
ils are typical ionic compounds , and therefore normally have high electrical conductivities and good charge transport properties .
combined with their distinctive solvation ability to a wide variety of inorganic , organic , and organometallic species , ils have inherent advantages to be used for various electrochemical applications [ 37 ] - [ 39 ] .
lanthanide elements present fascinating and intricate properties in view of singular photophysical / optical , catalytic , and magnetic properties [ 40 ] .
along with the increased demand of rare earths , there is a growing interest in high pure lanthanides .
selective separation of lanthanides is necessary for their applications [ 41 ] .
furthermore , in the nuclear fuel cycle , the technology of the selective separation of lanthanides is of importance for maximum utilization of the expensive nuclear fuel resource .
ils have shown potential as a solvent in nuclear fuel reprocessing technology [ 42 ] .
the separation coefficients of lanthanides are related to formal standard potentials , transfer and diffusion coefficients , and standard rate constants of charge transfer [ 43 ] .
these electrochemical properties of lanthanides will be very important for the selective separation of lanthanides in ils .
the electrochemical behavior of ln ( iii ) in room temperature ils composed of bis ( trifluoromethylsulfonyl ) imide anion ( ntf2 - ) was studied .
yamagata et al. studied the electrochemical behavior of eu ( iii ) , sm ( iii ) , yb ( iii ) in 1 - butyl - 1 - methylpyrrolidinium bis ( trifluoromethylsulfonyl ) imide ( bmpyntf2 ) and 1 - ethyl - 3 - methylimidazolium bis ( trifluoromethylsulfonyl ) imide ( emintf2 ) ils , which exhibit large electrochemical windows [ 44 ] .
the cyclic voltammograms of these lanthanide ions consisted of quasi - reversible waves that were attributed to the reduction of these trivalent lanthanides to their respective divalent states and the oxidation of divalents to their respective trivalents .
the diffusion coefficients of these trivalent lanthanides in these ils were determined to be ~ 10 - 8 cm2.s - 1 .
rao et al. reported the electrochemical behavior of eu ( iii ) in bmpyntf2 il [ 45 ] .
cyclic voltammogram of eu ( iii ) consisted of a quasi - reversible cathodic wave at - 0.45 v ( vs. fc / fc + , 373 k ) , which could be attributed to the reduction of eu ( iii ) to eu ( ii ) and an irreversible wave at - 2.79 v ( vs. fc / fc +) assigned to the reduction of eu ( ii ) to eu ( 0 ) .
the diffusion coefficient of eu ( iii ) in bmpyntf2 was determined to be about ~ 10 - 7 cm2.s - 1 , and the charge transfer rate constant ( k s ) was ~ 10 - 5 cm.s - 1 by cyclic voltammetry .
matsumiya et al. got the diffusion coefficients of eu ( iii ) and sm ( iii ) in ntf2 - ils to be ~ 10 - 12 cm2.s - 1 [ 46 ] .
bhatt et al. studied the electrochemical behaviors of la ( iii ) , sm ( iii ) and eu ( iii ) in tetraalkylammonium bis ( trifluoromethylsulfonyl ) imide ils [ 47 ] - [ 49 ] .
the above investigations indicate that ils are proposed as efficient candidates for high - temperature molten salts in non - aqueous reprocessing .
the relative expensive cost of ils is a key factor limiting their applications .
ils based on ntf2 - are high - cost , though they exhibit good fluidity .
some low - cost alternatives with good physicochemical properties are of interest .
1 - butyl - 3 - methylimidazolium bromide ( bmimbr ) , is a classical ionic liquid , with a melting point of 76degreesc [ 50 ] .
however , bmimbr usually exhibits supercool status as a liquid at room temperature for a long time .
this ionic liquid can be obtained in a big scale with low cost via a simple synthesis route skipping the tough purification of water .
such features suggest bmimbr can be regarded as a potential candidate for industry application .
water is an inevitable impurity in nearly all ils , even for the hydrophobic ntf2 - and pf6 - ils .
small amounts of water residual in bmimbr may lead to an increase of its electrical conductivity , and a decrease of its viscosity and melting point .
bmimbr obtained by simple methods is a realistic consideration in its potential applications .
herein , the electrochemical behaviors of four trivalent lanthanides , eu ( iii ) , sm ( iii ) , dy ( iii ) and nd ( iii ) , were investigated in bmimbr by cyclic voltammetry .
their diffusion coefficients and transfer coefficients were estimated .
the thermodynamic properties of eu ( iii ) including charge transfer rate constant , formal potential , and gibbs energy were also studied .
results and discussion 1 .
cyclic voltammetry the cyclic voltammograms of ln ( iii ) ( ln = eu , sm , dy , nd , 50 mmol.l - 1 ) in bmimbr at 293 k are shown in figure 1 .
for eu ( iii ) , a cathodic peak and an anodic peak potentials were observed around - 0.893 v and - 0.121 v , respectively .
the cathodic and anodic peaks were attributed to the reduction and oxidation of eu ( iii ) separately .
no deposition of europium metal was observed after the potentiostatic reduction .
therefore , this result shows that the reduced product was the divalent europium complex , eu ( ii ) .
the redox reaction of the eu ( iii )/ eu ( ii ) in bmimbr is a quasi - reversible .
the cyclic voltammograms of sm ( iii ) , dy ( iii ) and nd ( iii ) gave irreversible waves .
their cathodic peak potentials were around - 0.596 v ( sm ( iii )) , - 0.637 v ( dy ( iii )) and - 0.641 v ( nd ( iii )) , respectively , which are higher than that of eu ( iii ) .
the difference in the curves of sm ( iii ) , dy ( iii ) and nd ( iii ) is perhaps due to the instability of sm ( ii ) , dy ( ii ) and nd ( ii ) to eu ( ii ) .
relative to eu ( ii ) , the other three sm ( ii ) , dy ( ii ) and nd ( ii ) are easily oxidized to their respective trivalent states in bmimbr , leading to no anodic peak observed in the cyclic voltammograms .
this property also affected the cathodic peaks of sm ( iii ) , dy ( iii ) and nd ( iii ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0095832.g001 figure 1 cyclic voltammograms of eu ( iii ) , sm ( iii ) , dy ( iii ) and nd ( iii ) measured in bmimbr at 293 k. figure 2 shows the cyclic voltammograms of 50 mmol.l - 1 ln ( iii ) ( ln = eu , sm , dy , nd ) at various temperatures .
temperatures were well controlled and selected as 293 k , 308 k , 323 k and 338 k , respectively .
for eu ( iii ) in bmimbr , the current intensities increased along with the rise of temperature .
a similar tendency was found for the other three ln ( iii ) : sm ( iii ) , dy ( iii ) and nd ( iii ) .
this feature is associated with the mass transition caused by the viscosity of bmimbr , which depends on temperature closely [ 36 ] .
thus , the transport properties of ils , including conductivity , diffusion coefficient , and charge transfer rate are also temperature - dependent for the variation of viscosity .
for bmimbr ionic liquid , its viscosity decreased and the conductivity increased at higher temperature , which would facilitate the diffusion of trivalent lanthanide ions .
the diffusion rate became greater as the temperature increased .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0095832.g002 figure 2 cyclic voltammograms of eu ( iii ) ( a ) , sm ( iii ) ( b ) , dy ( iii ) ( c ) and nd ( iii ) ( d ) measured in bmimbr at different temperatures .
the cyclic voltammograms of 50 mmol.l - 1 eu ( iii ) in bmimbr at various scan rates are described in figure 3 .
both current intensity and peak potential were changed , along with the change of scan rate .
the cathodic and anodic peak potentials were shifted to cathode and anode , respectively , with the increase of scan rate .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0095832.g003 figure 3 cyclic voltammograms of eu ( iii ) measured in bmimbr with different scan rates .
the plots of cathodic peak current intensity ( i p ) against the square - root of the potential scan rate ( nu 1 / 2 ) , are shown in figure 4 .
for eu ( iii ) , a positive correlation of the current intensity with the scan rate was determined .
this result indicates that the electrode reaction kinetics is controlled by the mass transport under semi - infinitive linear diffusion conditions .
good linear relations were also observed for sm ( iii ) , dy ( iii ) and nd ( iii ) in bmimbr .

2. diffusion coefficients ( d o ) , transfer coefficients ( alpha ) and the energy of activation ( e a ) of eu ( iii ) , sm ( iii ) , dy ( iii ) and nd ( iii ) in bmimbr from a series of electrochemical analyses , the diffusion coefficients of ln ( iii ) in bmimbr were estimated .
for an irreversible or quasi - reversible system , the relation of the cathodic peak current and the diffusion coefficient ( d o ) can be predicted as equation ( 1 ) [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] : ( 1 ) where a is the electrode area in cm2 ( 0.1256 ) , c o * is the ln ( iii ) concentration in mmol.l - 1 (~ 50 mmol.l - 1 ) , d o is the diffusion coefficient in cm2.s - 1 , nu is the potential scan rate in v.s - 1 , f is the faraday constant , alpha is the charge transfer coefficient , n is the number of transferred electrons , n alpha is the number of electrons transferred in the rate determining step , and t is the absolute temperature in k. the value of alphan alpha can be estimate as equation ( 2 ) [ 45 ] : ( 2 ) where e p c is the cathodic potential , e p / 2 c is the half wave potential , and | e p c - e p / 2 c | is the absolute value of the difference between e p c and e p / 2 c. these data of ln ( iii ) recorded at different temperatures are summarized in table 1 .
for ln ( iii ) ( ln = eu , sm , dy , nd ) , the value of n alpha is 1 .

the values of d o and alpha are given in table 2 .
the diffusion coefficients can be regarded as a function of t. an increase of the diffusion coefficients and the charge transfer coefficients with temperature is observed .
the diffusion coefficient of eu ( iii ) is about 10 - 8 cm2.s - 1 at 293 k , and as high as ~ 10 - 7 cm2.s - 1 at higher temperature .
low viscosity of ils at high temperature results in more efficient mass transport .
similar trends are also found for sm ( iii ) , dy ( iii ) and nd ( iii ) in bmimbr , however , no increase in their magnitude of diffusion coefficient was found .
the magnitude of diffusion coefficients of sm ( iii ) , dy ( iii ) and nd ( iii ) is around 10 - 10 cm2.s - 1 , which is 102 ~ 103 times smaller than that of eu ( iii ) in bmimbr .
this fact indicates that the electrostatic interaction around eu ( iii ) in bmimbr may be weaker than those of sm ( iii ) , dy ( iii ) and nd ( iii ) .
at 338 k , the diffusion coefficient of eu ( iii ) increased more than those of the other three ln ( iii ) .

( figure 5 , table 2 ) the reduction of eu ( iii ) to eu ( ii ) exhibits the highest value of e a of 59.09 kj.mol - 1 .
while , the values of other three ln ( iii ) are found around 20 kj.mol - 1 ( sm ( iii ) , 18.94 kj.mol - 1 ; dy ( iii ) , 27.22 kj.mol - 1 ; and nd ( iii ) , 20.39 kj.mol - 1 ) .

3. charge transfer rate constants ( k s ) of eu ( iii ) in bmimbr diffusion and charge transfer kinetics are the major factors that affect the reduction of ln ( iii ) to ln ( ii ) in bmimbr .
the charge transfer rate constant ( k s , cm.s - 1 ) , associated with both diffusion coefficient and transfer coefficient , can be described as equation ( 3 ) [ 53 ] : ( 3 ) the charge transfer rate constants ( k s ) , the cathodic and anodic peak potentials ( e p c and e p a ) of eu ( iii ) in bmimbr at different temperatures are given in table 3 .
the magnitude of charge transfer rate constants are found to be ~ 10 - 5 cm.s - 1 .
such data increases when the temperature increases .
the lower viscosity of bmimbr at higher temperature may advantage electron transfer at electrode - electrolyte interphase .
thus , an increase of k s for eu ( iii ) in bmimbr can be found at higher temperature .
according to the value of k s , the electrode reaction can be summarized to be reversible ( k s >= 0.3 nu 1 / 2 cm.s - 1 ) , quasi - reversible ( 0.3 nu 1 / 2 >= k s >= 2x10 - 5 nu 1 / 2 cm.s - 1 ) , and irreversible ( k s <= 2x10 - 5 nu 1 / 2 cm.s - 1 ) .
a quasi - reversible electrode reaction of eu ( iii ) to eu ( ii ) is confirmed by the values of k s .

determination of gibbs energy change of eu ( iii ) in bmimbr gibbs energy , deltag , is of central importance to reaction .
the reduction of eu ( iii ) to eu ( ii ) in bmimbr is simply described as : ( 4 ) for a dilute solution system , its activity coefficient is negligible .
assuming eu ( iii ) in bmimbr forms a dilute solution , thus , the standard gibbs energy of the reaction eubr2 + 1 / 2br2 - - > eubr3 can be identified by the expression ( 5 ) .
( 5 ) where e 0 * eu ( ii )/ eu ( iii ) is the apparent standard potential of oxidation of eu ( ii ) to eu ( iii ) .
the apparent standard potential , e 0 * eu ( iii )/ eu ( ii ) , is associated with its cathodic and anodic peak potentials .
the relation between e 0 * eu ( iii )/ eu ( ii ) and e p c ( and e p a ) is given as : ( 6 ) ( 7 ) because the reduction of eu ( iii ) to eu ( ii ) involves a single electron transfer , n is equal to 1 , e 0 * eu ( iii )/ eu ( ii ) can be expressed as equation ( 8 ) , as a function of temperature .
( 8 ) from linear regression of the experimental data , ( figure 6 ) the equation for the apparent standard potential e0 * eu ( iii )/ eu ( ii ) ( equation ( 9 )) has the form : 10.1371 / journal.pone.0095832.g006 figure 6 plots of e 0 * eu ( iii )/ eu ( ii ) against t .
( 9 ) this expression , which shows that a change in e 0 * eu ( iii )/ eu ( ii ) is proportional to a change in t , suggests that e 0 * eu ( iii )/ eu ( ii ) can be regarded as a function of t. a linear correlation of e 0 * eu ( iii )/ eu ( ii ) with temperature is found .
based on equations ( 5 ) and ( 9 ) , the standard gibbs energy expression is ( 10 ) the standard gibbs energy is found to be a linear function of temperature .
the standard gibbs energy of reaction is expressed , combined with standard entropy and enthalpy of reaction : deltag = deltah - tdeltas .
the expression of equation ( 10 ) shows that the standard entropy ( deltas 0 eubr3 ) of the reaction eubr2 + 1 / 2br2 - - > eubr3 is negative .
the result indicates that a decrease in the entropy of the reaction occurs , along with the formation of less disordered eubr3 from higher disordered substrates .

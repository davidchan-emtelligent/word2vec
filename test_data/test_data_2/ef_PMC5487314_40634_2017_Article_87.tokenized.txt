background anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) injury is often accompanied with medial collateral ligament ( mcl ) injury .
assessment of varus - valgus ( v - v ) instability in the acl - deficient knee is crucial for the management of the concomitant acl - collateral ligaments injury .
we evaluated the v - v laxity and investigated the effect of additional posterior tibial load on the laxity in the acl - deficient knee .
our hypothesis was that the v - v laxity in the acl - deficient knee was greater than that in the intact knee and attenuated by additional posterior tibial load .
methods eight fresh - frozen porcine knees were used , and a 6degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) robotic system was utilized .
a 5 nm of v - v torque was applied to the intact knee , the acl - deficient knee , and the acl - deficient knee with 30 n of constant posterior tibial load , at 30degrees and 60degrees of flexion .
then , the 3d path in the intact knee was reproduced on the acl - deficient knee .
the total v - v angle under 5 nm of v - v torque was assessed and compared among the three statuses .
the in situ forces of the acl under 5 nm of varus and valgus torques , respectively , were also calculated .
results the total v - v angle in the acl - deficient knee under 5 nm of v - v torque was significantly greater than that in the intact knee , whereas the angle in the acl - deficient knee with 30 n of posterior tibial load was significantly smaller than that in the acl - deficient knee and approached that in the intact knee , at both 30degrees and 60degrees of flexion .
the in situ force of the acl was approximately 30 n at 30degrees and 16 n at 60degrees of flexion under 5 nm of both varus and valgus torques .
conclusions the v - v laxity in the isolated acl - deficient knee was greater than that in the intact knee .
the increased laxity was attenuated and approached that in the intact knee by adding posterior tibial load .
application of posterior tibial load is necessary for accurate assessment of v - v instability in the acl - deficient knee .
clinically , the v - v laxity in the combined acl - mcl or acl - lcl injured knee may be overestimated without posterior tibial load .
keywords anterior cruciate ligament instability laxity varus valgus posterior tibial load medial collateral ligament lateral collateral ligament knee issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) injury is often associated with concomitant injury to other ligaments , especially the medial collateral ligament ( mcl ) ( majewski et al. 2006 ) .
associated injury to the mcl is observed in 4 - 17 % of all patients with acl injury ( kaeding et al. 2005 ; shelbourne & nitz 1991 ) .
although most mcl injuries heal conservatively with early functional rehabilitation ( holden et al. 1983 ; indelicato 1983 ; petermann et al. 1993 ; reider et al .
1993 ) , some cases with concomitant grade iii mcl injury need surgical treatment ( fetto & marshall 1978 ; hillard - sembell et al. 1996 ; hughston 1994 ; kovachevich et al. 2009 ; shelbourne & porter 1992 ; wijdicks et al. 2010 ) .
grant et al .
( 2012 ) recommended mcl repair or reconstruction in case of persistent valgus instability after conservative treatment .
lateral collateral ligament ( lcl ) injury is also combined with acl injury , while the frequency of the acl - lcl injury is lower than that of the acl - mcl injury ( majewski et al. 2006 ) .
lcl repair or reconstruction is needed when varus instability remains in the acl - reconstructed knee ( laprade et al. 1999 ) .
therefore , assessment of varus - valgus ( v - v ) instability in the acl - deficient knee is critical , as persistent v - v instability with acl injury is an indication for operative treatment either prior to or concomitantly with acl reconstruction .
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) may help in the diagnosis of collateral ligaments injury .
however , mri grading did not correspond to clinical grading in some cases with mcl ( halinen et al. 2009 ; jacobson et al. 2006 ; schweitzer et al. 1995 ) and lcl ( bonadio et al. 2014 ) injury .
thus , physical examination for the assessment of v - v instability in the acl - deficient knee is crucial for the management of these patients .
acl deficiency may affect the v - v laxity in the human knee joint ( imbert et al. 2014 ; imbert et al. 2015 ; markolf et al. 1984 ) .
markolf et al .
( markolf et al. 1984 ) reported a 36 % increase in the v - v laxity at full extension in the isolated acl - deficient knee on application of 20 nm of v - v torque .
therefore , the v - v laxity in patients with injury to both the acl and the mcl can be much greater than that with isolated mcl injury .
additionally , the anterior tibial translation in the acl - deficient knee was shown to be greater than that in the intact knee , even under non - weight bearing conditions ( defrate et al. 2006 ; matsuo et al. 2014 ; mishima et al. 2005 ) .
we postulated that anterior tibial translation might be associated with greater v - v laxity in the acl - deficient knee .
therefore , the objectives of this study were 1 ) to evaluate the v - v laxity in the isolated acl - deficient knee on application of v - v torque and 2 ) to clarify the effect of additional posterior tibial load on the laxity in the acl - deficient knee .
we hypothesized that the v - v laxity in the isolated acl - deficient knee under v - v torque was greater than that in the intact knee , and that the laxity in the isolated acl - deficient knee was attenuated by adding posterior tibial load .
methods eight fresh - frozen porcine knees were used in this study .
their mean age and weight was approximately 24 weeks ( range , 23 - 25 ) and 115 kg ( 110 - 120 ) , respectively .
each knee was thawed at room temperature for 24 h prior to testing .
the patella , patellar tendon and all muscles except for the popliteus were removed , while the capsule around the knee was carefully left .
knees with apparent injury to ligaments , menisci , and cartilage of the articular surface were excluded .
the femur and the tibia were cut 13 cm apart from the joint line , and both ends were potted and fixed in cylindrical molds of acrylic resin ( ostron ii ; gc , tokyo , japan ) .
the fibula was cut 4 cm distal from the proximal tibiofibular joint and fixed in its anatomic position with acrylic resin .
apparatus a 6degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) robotic system was utilized in the study .
the system consisted of a velocity - control 6 - axis manipulator ( custom - designed ) with a universal force / moment sensor ( ufs ) ( si - 660 - 60 , ati industrial automation , nc , usa ) and a control computer ( windows xp ; microsoft , wa , usa ) linked with a high - speed motion network ( mechatrolink - ii ; yaskawa electric , fukuoka , japan ) ( fujie et al. 1993 ; fujie et al. 1996 ; fujie et al. 2004 ) .
the manipulator had two mechanisms : the upper mechanism attached to the ufs and the lower one .
the upper mechanism was linked to two translational - axis actuators ( sgds - 01f12a ; yaskawa electric , fukuoka , japan ) and three rotational - axis actuators ( ha - 800b - 3a ; harmonic drive systems , tokyo , japan ) , while the lower one was linked to one translational - axis actuator .
all the actuators were powered by ac servo - motors .
the control computer in a graphical language programming environment ( labview 8.6.1 ; national instruments , tx , usa ) operated the program to control both the position of and the force / moment acting on the knee joint .
the system could manipulate a natural three - dimensional ( 3d ) motion of the knee , prescribing the force / moment acting on a joint except for the operator 's intended direction at zero , by calculating acquired data of the position and the force / moment .
the manipulator had a position accuracy of +/ - 0.003 mm in translation and +/ - 0.002degrees in rotation ; the clamp - to - clamp stiffness was more than 319 n / mm in translation and more than 84.6 nmm / degrees in rotation ( fujie et al. 2013 ) .
iteration of data acquisition , kinematic and kinetic calculation , and motion of actuator were performed at a rate of 20 hz. the tibial cylindrical molded end was connected firmly to the upper mechanism of the manipulator via a specially designed aluminum clamp , while the femoral end was connected firmly to the lower one ( fig. 1 ) .
a knee joint coordinate system developed by grood and suntay ( grood & suntay 1983 ) was introduced , and a 3d digitizer ( microscribe - 3dx ; immersion , ca , usa ) was utilized to aim the femoral insertion sites of the mcl and lcl ( resolution : 0.13 mm ; accuracy : 0.23 mm ). fig. 1 the 6degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) robotic system .
the tibial cylindrical molded end was connected to the upper mechanism of 6 - axis manipulator ( black arrow ) , while the femoral end was connected to the lower one ( white arrow ) .
the white arrow head indicates the universal force / moment sensor ( ufs ) attached to the upper mechanism testing protocol at the beginning of the examination , three times of passive flexion - extension motion between 20degrees and 120degrees of flexion were applied to the intact knee to exclude the influence of creep behavior .
in the third cycle , the internal - external ( i - e ) rotational positions at 30degrees and 60degrees of flexion were recorded , respectively ; these were considered as natural i - e rotational positions in the intact knee .
first , a 5 nm of v - v torque was loaded on the intact knee at 30degrees and 60degrees of flexion , respectively , and the 3d path and the force / moment of the tibia relative to the femur were recorded .
after cutting the acl , the same procedure was followed for the acl - deficient knee , and the 3d path and the force / moment were recorded .
in the pilot study , we evaluated the optimal posterior tibial load to maintain the normal femur - tibial position in the acl - deficient knees , and decided that 30 n was enough to return the anterior tibial displacement to the neutral position .
then , with additional 30 n of constant posterior tibial load , the same procedure was performed on the acl - deficient knee , and the 3d path and the force / moment were recorded .
finally , the previously recorded 3d path in the intact knee was reproduced on the acl - deficient knee ( fig. 2 ) .
all procedures were carried out under fixation of the natural i - e rotational positions at 30degrees and 60degrees of flexion , respectively , in accordance with the situation of clinical assessment. fig. 2 testing protocol .
all procedures were carried out under fixation of the natural internal - external rotational positions at 30degrees and 60degrees of flexion , respectively .
intact : intact knee , acld : acl - deficient knee , acld p : acl - deficient knee with additional 30 n of posterior tibial load we assessed the total v - v angle under 5 nm of v - v torque , and compared the v - v angle among the intact knee , the acl - deficient knee , and the acl - deficient knee with additional posterior tibial load .
the varus and valgus angles and the related anterior tibial translations from the neutral position were also evaluated under 5 nm of varus and valgus torques , respectively .
the in situ forces of the acl under 5 nm of varus and valgus torques , respectively , were calculated from the tibial force / moment data , under the principle of superposition ( fujie et al. 1995 ; fujie et al. 2004 ) .
statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed with jmp software ( jmp pro version 12.0.2 ; sas institute , nc , usa ) .
power analysis ( power 0.8 ; alpha 0.05 ) indicated a sample size requirement of seven knees for valid comparisons .
the steel - dwass test for multiple comparisons was used to assess between - group differences .
a p - value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results total varus - valgus angle and related anterior tibial translation on application of 5 nm of v - v torque , the total v - v angle in the acl - deficient knee was significantly greater than that in the intact knee at both 30degrees and 60degrees of flexion ( p = 0.01 ) .
the angle in the acl - deficient knee with 30 n of posterior tibial load was significantly smaller than that in the acl - deficient knee ( p = 0.01 ) and approached that in the intact knee at both 30degrees and 60degrees of flexion ( table 1 ) .
the varus angle was significantly different among the three knee models , while the valgus angle did not show any difference .

table 3 the values of in situ force of the acl under 5 nm of varus and valgus torques , respectively in situ force ( n ) under 5 nm of varus torque under 5 nm of valgus torque at 30 degrees of flexion 27.8 +/ - 14.0 32.4 +/ - 15.7 at 60 degrees of flexion 16.4 +/ - 12.0 15.9 +/ - 6.1 discussion the principal findings of the present study were that the v - v laxity in the acl - deficient knee in response to v - v torque was greater than that in the intact knee , and that the laxity in the acl - deficient knee with additional posterior tibial load got close to that in the intact knee .
therefore , the acl appeared to carry a substantial role in restraining v - v rotation of the knee joint .
as the acl worked against anterior tibial drawer , the anterior tibial translation under anterior tibial load increased in the acl - injured knee ( amis & dawkins 1991 ; markolf et al. 1984 ) .
amis et al .
( 1991 ) reported that the anterior tibial translation increased by approximately 140 % after removal of the acl on application of 150 n of anterior tibial load at 20degrees of flexion .
besides , markolf et al .
( 1984 ) reported the increased v - v laxity in the acl - deficient knee in response to v - v torque , as compared to that in the intact knee .
our results showed that the v - v laxity increased under v - v torque , while the in situ force of the acl was 16 - 30 n under 5 nm of varus and valgus torques , respectively .
thus , the acl also had a restraining force against v - v rotation of the knee joint ( grood et al. 1981 ; markolf et al. 1990 ) .
in addition , the tibia in the acl - deficient knee located more anteriorly than in the intact knee even under non - weight bearing conditions ( defrate et al. 2006 ; matsuo et al. 2014 ; mishima et al. 2005 ) .
matuso et al .
( 2014 ) reported that the anterior tibial translation in the acl - deficient knee was 1.4 mm greater than that in the normal knee in supine and extended knee position .
hence , the anterior tibial translation was assumed to be associated with the greater v - v laxity in the acl - deficient knee .
in the present study , the increase in v - v laxity in the acl - deficient knee was attenuated by adding posterior tibial load because the anterior tibial translation was restrained .
these findings suggest that posterior tibial load should be applied during assessment of v - v instability in the acl - deficient knee for accurate physical evaluation of the v - v laxity .
when varus torque is applied to the knee joint , the interaction between the medial femoral condyle and the medial tibial plateau generates anterior tibial load due to the posterior tibial slope .
this anterior load and the compressive load in the medial compartment induce the tibial translation in antero - proximal direction along the posterior tibial slope ( fig. 3a ) .
after resection of the acl , the tibia translates more antero - proximally than that in the intact knee because restraining force against anterior drawer is lost .
consequently , this enables the tibia to rotate in more varus direction ( fig. 3b ) .
our results demonstrated that the anterior tibial translation as well as the varus angle under varus torque in the acl - deficient knee increased compared to that in the intact knee .
however , this was not demonstrable for the valgus laxity .
on macroscopic observation , the anterior slope of the lateral tibial convex plateau seemed to be very steep ; therefore , the tibia might not be able to overcome the lateral femoral condyle and translate antero - proximally in response to valgus torque , under fixation of the i - e rotation of the knee joint ( fig. 4 ) .
fukuda et al .
( 2003 ) reported that under conditions of unfixed i - e rotation , valgus torque caused the greater anterior tibial translation coupled with the internal rotation in the acl - deficient knee , as compared to the intact knee .
in this study , as the i - e rotation of the knee joint was restricted in order to mimic the assessment in clinical settings , this condition might affect the valgus rotation. fig. 3 lateral view of porcine knee joint ( medial side ) .
a when varus torque is applied , the interaction between the medial femoral condyle and the medial tibial plateau ( black arrow ) generates anterior tibial load ( white arrow ) and the tibia translates in antero - proximal direction ( yellow arrow ) along the posterior tibial slope , b the tibia can rotate in more varus direction because of the greater antero - proximal translation after removal of the acl ( white dotted line ) fig. 4 lateral view of porcine knee joint [ medial ( a ) and lateral ( b ) side ] .
the anterior slope of the lateral tibial convex plateau seemed to be too steep ( black arrow ) to overcome the lateral femoral condyle and translate anterio - proximally in response to valgus torque under restriction of the internal rotation there were some limitations in the present study .
first , we used porcine knee model .
however , porcine knee has been proved to be anatomically similar to human knee and available for biomechanical investigations ( aerssens et al. 1998 ; boquszewski et al. 2011 ; martin et al. 2016 ) .
so , the results obtained from this study can be applied to the clinical assessment of human knee joint reasonably well .
second , removal of the patella and the patellar tendon might lead to overestimation of the v - v laxity in the acl deficient knee ( guenther et al. 2016 ; thein et al. 2016 ) .
however , the influence on the measured laxity could be minimal because the anteromedial and anterolateral capsule were carefully left .
finally , the experiment was performed under conditions of fixed i - e rotation ( 4 - dof ) .
inoue et al .
( 1987 ) reported overestimation of the v - v laxity in the isolated acl - deficient canine knee was in 5 - dof mode , as compared to that in 3 - dof mode ( fixation of i - e rotation and anterior - posterior translation ) , due to the coupled i - e tibial rotation under v - v torque .
when we clinically assess v - v instability of the knee joint , the i - e rotation is usually restricted .
therefore , we assessed the v - v laxity in 4 - dof manner for more precise measurements .
conclusions the v - v laxity in the isolated acl - deficient knee increased compared to that in the intact knee under v - v torque .
the increased laxity was attenuated and got close to that in the intact knee by adding posterior tibial load .
therefore , it is necessary to apply posterior tibial load against the anterior tibial translation for accurate assessment of v - v instability in the acl - deficient knee .

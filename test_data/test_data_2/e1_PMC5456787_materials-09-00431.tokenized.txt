we described the fabrication of functional and microstructured surfaces from polymer blends by spray deposition .
this simple technique offers the possibility to simultaneously finely tune the microstructure as well as the surface chemical composition .
whereas at lower polymer concentration , randomly distributed surface micropatterns were observed , an increase of the concentration leads to significant changes on these structures .
on the one hand , using pure homopolystyrene fiber - like structures were observed when the polymer concentration exceeded 30 mg / ml. interestingly , the incorporation of 2,3,4,5,6 - pentafluorostyrene changed the morphology , and , instead of fibers , micrometer size particles were identified at the surface .
these fluorinated microparticles provide superhydrophobic properties leading to surfaces with contact angles above 165degrees .
equally , in addition to the microstructures provided by the spray deposition , the use of thermoresponsive polymers to fabricate interfaces with responsive properties is also described .
contact angle measurements revealed variations on the surface wettability upon heating when blends of polystyrene and polystyrene - b - poly ( dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate ) are employed .
finally , the use of spraying techniques to fabricate gradient surfaces is proposed .
maintaining a constant orientation , the surface topography and thus the contact angle varies gradually from the center to the edge of the film depending on the spray angle .
spray deposition polymer blends amphiphilic copolymers thermoresponsive surfaces superhydrophobicity 1 .
introduction the elaboration of functional microstructured interfaces is currently a center of intensive research .
the large variety of applications derived from these materials include the design of superhydrophobic [ 1 ] surfaces , the design of surfaces for biomedical purposes [ 2 ] , including tissue engineering [ 3 ] , cell adhesion [ 4 ] , or the elaboration of diffractive optical elements [ 5 ] , just to mention few of them .
in order to fabricate functional microstructured surfaces , different approaches have been proposed including lithographic techniques or instability based approaches .
for instance , the techniques grouped under the name of " soft lithography " have been proposed for the development of nano - and micro - structured organic and inorganic matter [ 6,7,8,9 ] .
in recent years , many polymer - based microfabrication techniques [ 10 ] via microinjection molding [ 11,12 ] , casting [ 5,13 ] , and micro - hot embossing [ 14,15 ] have been developed .
in contrast to the above mentioned methodologies , spray deposition , a commercial production for painting at low cost , has been successfully applied to prepare large area surface coatings on many different substrates .
sprayed coatings have found applications for instance in the fabrication of organic - based devices , such as transistors [ 16 ] , solar cells [ 17 ] or sensors [ 18 ] .
in these studies , spraying has been chosen due to its ability to prepare the large - area devices with low surface roughness .
in effect , most of the previous reports have been published to understand the fast kinetic process of spray deposition and evaluate the spraying conditions to produce rather homogeneous films [ 19,20 ] .
however , more recently , studies carried out by medeiros et al .
[ 21 ] or srinivasan and coworkers [ 22 ] showed that the use of this straightforward methodology permits the fabrication of microstructured interfaces [ 22 ] by formation of micrometer size fibers [ 21 ] or even to form highly hydrophobic surfaces by incorporation of fluorinated polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane ( poss ) nanoparticles on a polymer matrix [ 22 ] .
both studies provided evidence of the possibility of using this approach to obtain non - homogeneous films with a rather high surface roughness .
in this manuscript , we aim to extend this concept and explore the fabrication of textured surfaces by spraying polymer blends with different functional copolymers .
in particular , we will first explore the incorporation of random copolymers either hydrophilic or hydrophobic functional groups in a polymer matrix .
the effect of the concentration as well as the possibility to fabricate gradient surfaces is described as well .
in this context , it is worth mentioning that a straightforward fabrication of gradient surfaces changing a particular property along a particular direction may find practical applications in multiple areas including cell - motility , diagnostics or nanotribology .
most of the strategies reported up to now that fabricate gradient surfaces resort to sophisticated systems including corona and plasma discharge , palladium deposition or gas diffusion technique , among others [ 23,24,25 ] .
herein , we aim to illustrate the possibility to produce , in one single step , surfaces with gradual topography by using spray deposition .
in the last part of this manuscript , we studied the use of spray to fabricate more sophisticated surfaces , also known as " smart surfaces " , that respond to variation on the environmental temperature by using blends of a homopolymer and a thermoresponsive block copolymer .
2. discussion the fabrication of the functional surfaces was carried out using a polymer matrix , in this case a high molecular weight homopolystyrene ( ps ) blended with a variable amount of the different copolymers .
for this study , we fabricated three different copolymers bearing hydrophilic or hydrophobic functional groups and also stimuli responsive properties as depicted in figure 1 .
amphiphilic copolymers were obtained either using poly ( ethylenglycol methacrylate ) ( pegma ) or dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate ( dmaema ) as comonomers .
moreover , double hydrophobic copolymers were obtained copolymerizing styrene ( s ) and 2,3,4,5,6 - pentafluorostyrene ( 5fs ) .
moreover , the block copolymer prepared using dmaema , i.e. , polystyrene - b - poly ( dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate ) ( ps - b - pdmaema ) exhibits additionally ph and thermal response .
2.1 .
surface microstructures with variable wettability at low polymer concentrations as has been already evidenced by other authors , the solution concentration plays a major role in the formation of surface micro - textures during the spraying process [ 17,22 ] .
thus , the first series of experiments were conducted in a diluted concentration regime between 5 and 30 mg / ml. in addition , the number of layers was equally varied between one and ten .
as made evident in figure 2 , using only homopolystyrene ( ps ) , both concentration and the number of sprayed layers clearly induced the formation of different surface patterns .
lower concentrations produced microstructured patterns and average roughness ra ~ 0.36 mum .
an increase of the concentration of the solution employed up to 15 mg / ml produced a significant decrease of the surface roughness ( ra ~ 0.22 mum ) .
finally , spray carried out from 30 mg / ml solutions led to films with homogeneous smooth textures with low surface roughness ra ~ 0.15 mum .
in order to vary the functionality of the microstructures produced at low concentrations , blends with different copolymers having either hydrophilic or hydrophobic functional groups were fabricated .
the surface structure obtained upon 10 layers using polymer solutions with a concentration of 5 mg / ml is depicted in figure 3 .
figure 3 also depicts the contact angle measured for all the blends as well as for the pure copolymers included for comparative purposes .
as expected , the incorporation of highly hydrophobic functional groups clearly increases the contact angle observed .
thus , an increase of around 20degrees was observed in blends of ps with ps - co - p5fs and when using exclusively ps - co - p5fs in comparison to pure ps. on the contrary , the incorporation of hydrophilic pegma or dmaema monomers significantly decreased the contact angle .
in the case of ps - co - ppegma blended with ps , the contact angle remains similar to the values encountered for ps. most probably , the low amount of ppegma within the total blend and the statistical structure of the amphiphilic copolymer did not permit considerable changes in the wettability .
however , a larger increase of the surface wettability was observed in the case of the microstructured films produced from the pure ps - co - ppegma copolymers with contact angle values below 80degrees .
interestingly , the block copolymer structure in the ps - b - pdmaema appeared to play a role in the surface wettability .
in comparison with the ps - co - ppegma , the amount of the hydrophilic part is significantly lower , i.e. , 35 mol % in the statistical copolymer versus a 27 mol % in the block copolymer .
nevertheless , for similar blends , the incorporation of the block copolymer reduces the contact angle to a larger extent .
more precisely , blends of ps / ps - b - pdmaema exhibit contact angles of around 35degrees , whereas blends of ps / ps - co - ppegma produced surfaces with contact angles of around 85degrees .
finally , the pure copolymer produces more hydrophilic surfaces ( contact angles below 25degrees ) .
2.2 .
functional surface microstructures polymer concentrations above 30 mg / ml in the concentration regime depicted above , the surfaces exhibited randomly oriented micropatterns .
however , an increase of the polymer concentration above 30 mg / ml induced interesting changes on the surface topography that largely depend on the molecular weight of the polymer employed .
in the case of ps40 spraying , using high concentrations produce surfaces with micrometer size features ( figure 4a ) .
on the other hand , when using ps250 , an increase of the surface concentration leads to submicrometer ( 200 - 400 nm ) fiber like structures ( figure 4b ) .
these variations require further investigation but could be , in principle , associated with differences in the solution viscosity .
interestingly , the formation of fibers has been associated with an increase of the contact angle in comparison to previous textured surfaces prepared at lower concentrations .
as a result , as depicted in figure 4c - e , whereas the contact angles remain constant with values of around 96degrees - 99degrees for the range of concentrations between 5 and 30 mg / ml , the surfaces prepared from 50 mg / ml solutions have contact angles above 130degrees .
similar observations were reported by srinivasan et al. using poss / polymethyl methacrylate ( pmma blends [ 22 ]) .
however , in their study , the highly hydrophobic structure of the poss employed together with the fiber - like structure was responsible for the larger increase of the contact angle .
in order to further increase the surface hydrophobicity , instead of adding an inorganic hydrophobic charge , blends of ps with the ps - co - p5fs copolymer were employed at high concentration ( 50 mg / ml ) to fabricate microstructured surfaces .
the sem images of the surface structures and the resulting contact angle measurements are depicted in figure 5 .
the incorporation of 50 wt % of ps - co - p5fs significantly alters the microstructure observed previously of pure ps. instead of fiber - like structures , a corpuscular morphology with micrometer size microspheres ( 5 - 10 mum in diameter ) partially embedded in a polymer matrix can be observed .
moreover , an increase of the amount of ps - co - p5fs within the blend to 75 % , or even using only the copolymer , leads to surfaces with an increasing density of microspheres .
as a result , the surface properties changed accordingly .
ps surfaces form fibrous microstructures with contact angles of around 130degrees .
the incorporation of the fluorinated copolymer changed the morphology and the wettability .
in contrast to what would be expected by the incorporation of a fluorinated polymer , the contact angle decreases to values of around 110degrees .
most probably , the topographical changes with a decrease of the specific surface area and a wenzel wetting regime can , at least to some extent , explain this observation .
however , in the case of using the copolymer , the surface becomes superhydrophobic and exhibits contact angles above 160degrees .
in this case , the increasing density of topographic features of these textured coatings promotes the transition between a wenzel to a cassie - baxter state .
thus , microscopic pockets of air are trapped within the micro - texture , resulting in both high contact angles as well as low roll off angles ( in our case below 10degrees ) .
2.3 .
fabrication of gradient surface patterns previous studies on the use of spray to fabricate gradient surfaces focused on the variation of the distance between the jet and the substrate [ 26 ] .
herein , we will explore the variation of the surface morphology as a function of the spraying angle .
for this purpose , the fabrication of gradient surfaces by spraying was carried out applying the polymer solution in the center of a glass slide as depicted in figure 6 .
to illustrate the preparation of gradient surfaces , diluted solutions of 5 mg / ml and deposing five layers were employed .
as evidenced by the 3d profile images depicted in figure 6 , the surface topography changes linearly from the center to the edge of the sample .
in particular , the surface roughness in the center , i.e. , when the jet is perpendicular to the substrate ( alpha = 90degrees ) is rather high : ra ~ 0.51 mum .
however , surface roughness decreases gradually to ra ~ 0.29 mum when the angle between the jet and the substrate is around 84degrees and finally becomes ra ~ 0.15 mum in the edge of the sprayed area ( angle of ~ 78degrees ) .
as a result , the surface morphology clearly depends on the lateral distance .
in the center of the sprayed region , a large amount of polymer solution comes in contact with the surface and , as has been mentioned in section 2.1 , this induces the formation of a smooth surface .
on the contrary , towards the edge of the sprayed area , the amount of polymer decreases , the surface is only partially covered , and a microtextured pattern is observed .
2.4 .
thermoresponsive sprayed surfaces the thermal response of pdmaema both in solution and also on surfaces has been already described .
surfaces decorated with pdmaema have been , for instance , prepared by grafting - onto or grafting - from methodologies .
however , independently of the strategy employed , these require the use of time - consuming multi - step procedures .
herein , we explored the formation of microstructured and thermal responsive surfaces by incorporating a ps - b - pdmaema block copolymer into a ps homopolymer matrix .
the 3d optical profile image depicted in figure 7 indicated the formation of a micropatterned surfaces with ra ~ 0.59 .
the surface coatings were prepared from blends of ps and ps - b - pdmaema using 50 mg / ml sprayed onto a glass substrate .
in order to study the thermoresponsive behavior of the surface , contact angle measurements were carried out by heating the substrate between 35 and 65 degreesc and measuring the contact angle at different temperatures .
as depicted in figure 7 , the contact angle below the low critical solution temperature ( lcst ) , i.e. , below 40 degreesc remains in values of around 75degrees .
however , above 40 degreesc , the contact angle gradually increased from 75degrees up to 87degrees .
finally , the contact angles were observed at 50 degreesc , and , upon further heating , remained constant .
thus , an increase of the hydrophobicity indicated the formation of intrachain hydrogen bonding rather than interchain h - bonding observed below the lcst .
it is worth mentioning that the lcst value observed is in good agreement with previous studies carried out on block copolymers in solution [ 27 ] in which lcst values between 45 and 50 degreesc were observed for similar block copolymer compositions .
3. experimental section 3.1 .

3.2 .
polymer synthesis the copolymers and block copolymers used throughout this work were prepared by atom transfer radical polymerization ( atrp ) in order to obtain low polydispersity and controlled chain length .
3.2.1 .
preparation of poly ( 2,3,4,5,6 - pentafluorostyrene ) - co - polystyrene the random copolymer of poly ( 2,3,4,5,6 - pentafluorostyrene ) - co - polystyrene p ( ps - co - p5fs ) was synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization ( atrp ) .
the polymerization was performed in schlenk flasks previously flamed and dried under vacuum ( this conditions are general for all the polymerizations ) .
it was carried out using the following stoichiometry [ m1 ]/[ m2 ]/[ i ]/[ cubr ]/[ l ] = 5:45:1:1:1 where m1 = ps , m2 = p5fs , i = ebrib , l = pmdeta in toluene .
the reaction mixture was degassed by three - pump - thaw cycles and placed in a thermostatic oil bath at 90 degreesc ; after the polymerization , the mixtures were cooled to room temperature ; and the contents were diluted with dichloromethane and passed through a neutral alumina column to remove the copper salt .
after removing the solvent , the polymers were precipitated in hexane , washed and dried under vacuum ( mn : 10,800 g / mol ; polydispersity ( pd ) : 1.14 ) .
the final copolymer composition according to 1h - nmr was 10 mol % of ps and 90 mol % of p5fs .
3.2.2 .
synthesis of polystyrene - co - poly [ poly ( ethylene glycol ) methyl ether methacrylate ] ( ps - co - ppegma ) the preparation of ps - co - ppegma , was carried out using the following stoichiometry [ m1 ]/[ m2 ]/[ i ]/[ cubr ]/[ l ] = 48:12:1:1:1 where m1 = ps , m2 = pegma , i = ebrib , l = pmdeta in toluene .
the reaction mixture was degassed by three - pump - thaw cycles and placed in a thermostatic oil bath at 90 degreesc ; after the polymerization , the mixtures were cooled to room temperature ; the contents were diluted with dichloromethane and passed through a neutral alumina column to remove the copper salt .
after removing the solvent , the polymers were precipitated in hexane , washed and dried under vacuum ( mn : 6100 g / mol ; pd : 1.2 ) .
the final polymer composition determined by 1h - nmr produced evidence of a copolymer formed by 65 mol % of ps and 35 mol % of pegma .
3.2.3 .
synthesis of polystyrene - block - poly ( dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate ) ( ps - b - pdmaema ) in a typical polymerization experiment , 0.60 g ( 3.2 mmol ) phenylethyl bromide , 0.56 g ( 3.2 mmol ) n,n,n ' , n '' , n '' - pentamethyldiethylenetriamine and 0.46 g ( 3.2 mmol ) cubr were placed in a dried 100 ml three - necked flask which was flushed with nitrogen .
pre - degassed styrene ( 20 g , 192 mmol ) was added to the flask immersed in an oil bath at 85 degreesc , and then the solution was magnetically stirred for 4 h under a nitrogen atmosphere .
over this period , the originally red translucent polymeric solution turned dark and opaque .
after the polymerization was completed , the polymer was diluted by 20 ml chcl3 , and then precipitated in excess methanol after passing through an alumina column .
the white powder was purified by re - dissolution in chcl3 and reprecipitation in methanol , and then dried at 60 degreesc under vacuum .
synthesis of block copolymer : in a schlenk tube , 0.819 g ( 0.182 mmol ) ps - br macroinitiator , 0.019 g ( 0.135 mmol ) cubr , and 0.023 g ( 0.135 mmol ) n,n,n ' , n '' , n '' - pentamethyldiethylenetriamine ( pmdeta ) , 20 ml of pre - degassed dmf was introduced in a nitrogen atmosphere .
the schlenk was immersed in an oil bath at 90 degreesc and the atrp was started by adding 2.55 g ( 16.2 mmol ) of dmaema .
the reaction was left for 24 h with continuous stirring .
after the polymerization was completed , the former block was precipitated in methanol after passing through an alumina column , and dried at 60 degreesc under vacuum .
according to 1h - nmr , the block copolymer has a composition of ps43 - b - pdmaema16 .
gel permeation chromatography ( gpc ) of the block copolymer carried out in tetrahydrofuran ( thf ) produced a narrow polydispersity of 1.22 indicating the complete initiation of the polystyrene macroinitiator .
in addition , two different homopolystyrenes ( ps ) were employed .
on the one hand , a rather short ps with 40 units was prepared by atrp .
on the other hand , commercially available high molecular weight polystyrene ( aldrich , mw = 2.50 x 105 g / mol , ~ 250 units ) was used as polymeric matrix for the blend .
3.3 .
film preparation by spraying an air brush ( sealey ab931 with working pressure between 15 and 45 psi , essex , uk ) was connected to a compressed air tank ( pressure p = 28 psi ) to spray coat the polymer solution at a distance of ~ 7 cm onto the substrate .
the air brush was moved horizontally during the spraying process .
the diameter covered by the conical spray jet at the substrate over the duration of the spraying was ~ 3 cm in diameter , while the size of the glass slide was 8 cm x 2 cm. two spray - deposition modes were employed .
the first mode involves one , five , and 10 cycles fixed in the center of the glass slide .
in the second mode , the deposition was carried out over the entire film using one , five , and 10 cycles .
the polymers and their blends were dissolved in chloroform at a variable concentration between 5 and 50 mg / ml .
3.4 .
characterization 1h - nmr spectra of polymers were recorded at 70 degreesc in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso - d6 ) or in cdcl3 with a bruker advance spectrometer ( billerica , ma , usa ) operating at 300 mhz .
the proton spectra were used to determine the conversion , composition and modification degree of the different synthesized copolymers .
the number - average molecular weight ( mn ) , weight - average molecular weight ( mw ) , and the polydispersity ( mw / mn ) were measured by size exclusion chromatography ( sec ) with a chromatographic system ( waters division millipore , madrid , spain ) equipped with a waters model 410 refractive - index detector ( madrid , spain ) .
dimethyl formamide ( 99.9 % , aldrich ) containing 0.1 % of libr was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 1 cm3 / min at 50 degreesc .
styragel packed columns ( hr2 , hr3 , and hr4 , waters division millipore ) were employed .
the calibration was performed with poly ( methyl methacrylate ) standards ( polymer laboratories ltd. , amherst , ma , usa ) ranging from 2.4 x 106 to 9.7 x 102 g / mol .
optical profilometry : analysis of the wrinkle formation as well as the cross - sectional profiles were obtained by using a zeta - 20 optical profiler ( zeta instruments , san jose , ca , usa ) with different optical objectives and with 13 nm vertical resolution .
arithmetic average of absolute values ( ra ) were obtained using the zeta3d ( tm ) metrology systems ( san jose , ca , usa ) .
scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) micrographs were taken using a philips xl30 ( amsterdam , the netherlands ) with an acceleration voltage of 25 kv. the samples were coated with gold - palladium ( 80 / 20 ) prior to scanning .
4. conclusions in this manuscript , based on polymer blends and copolymers bearing different functional groups , we highlighted the versatility of the spray methodology to prepare microstructured surfaces with variable surface properties .
the number of layers applied , but overall the polymer concentration , clearly influenced the final surface topography .
whereas low and high concentrations led to surfaces with micropatterns , the spray of intermediate concentrations 25 - 30 mg / ml produced rather smooth surfaces .
together with the concentration , the blend composition , and , in particular , the chemical structure of the copolymer employed also induced significant changes on the final morphology .
whereas spray of high concentration ps solutions formed fibrous morphologies , the addition of fluorinated polystyrene dramatically changed the morphology observed .
instead of fibers , a corpuscular morphology composed of micrometer size particles was found .
these changes have an effect also on the surface wettability .
as a result , a change in the wetting regime from a wenzel to a cassie - baxter allowed us to fabricate superhydrophobic surfaces .
finally , two other aspects have been considered in this manuscript .
on the one hand , we provided evidence of the formation of a surface with gradient surface morphology by spraying in the center of a support .
on the other hand , the use of stimuli - responsive polymers such as pdmaema allows us to obtain more sophisticated interfaces in which the wettability can be altered as a function of environmental parameters such as the temperature .
in summary , using the appropriate blend composition and polymer concentration , a simple spraying technique enables the fabrication of surfaces with different microtextures that may be employed in multiple applications ranging from antifouling or non - adherent surfaces to biocompatible or adhesive surfaces .

introduction in contrast to spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine , non - traumatic cervico - thoracic spondylolisthesis is a very rare lesion .
even minor changes in the displacement of the vertebrae or the cord can lead to cervical myelopathy and paralysis .
since only a few cases have been well - documented , there is currently no clear preference between operative techniques .
case presentation we describe the case of a 63 - year - old caucasian man with a 13 mm spondylolisthesis between c7 and t1 .
within a few months , a progressive cervical myelopathy developed as he began to suffer pain and loss of function of his digits and was no longer able to walk unassisted .
in an interdisciplinary collaboration between neurological and orthopedic surgeons , a ventral - dorsal - ventral approach was performed on one vertebral section .
the ventral removal of the intervertebral disc was followed by laminectomy and dorsal instrumentation .
a new application technique was established by inserting bicortical screws into the transverse processes of t2 and t3 .
the structure was subsequently stabilized by the ventral insertion of a harms basket .
the procedure was successful as it halted progression of the myelopathy .
the patient demonstrated improved sensitivity and recovered the ability to walk unassisted .
he has now been able to walk unassisted for two years postoperatively .
conclusion this paper describes a successful treatment for a very rare case of cervico - thoracic spondylolisthesis .
the technique of inserting bicortical screws into the transverse processes is a fast , safe and successful method that does not require the use of intraoperative radiographs for placement of the bicortical screws into the transverse processes .
cervico - thoracic spondylolisthesis myelopathy screws transverse processes introduction lower cervical or cervico - thoracic spondylolisthesis may be caused by trauma , spondylodiscitis or degeneration of the facet joints , resulting in altered cervical mechanics and secondary subluxation [ 1 - 3 ] .
congenital lower cervical or cervico - thoracic spondylolisthesis is usually associated with a bilateral spondylolysis [ 4 ] .
the most important mechanism that causes cervical spondylotic myelopathy is compression of the spinal cord [ 5 ] .
while spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine is a common disease , only a few cases of cervical spondylolisthesis have been well - documented .
compression of the lumbar spine results in a milder neurologic impairment than compression of the cervical spine , mainly due to the spinal cord ending around the level of l1 .
even minor anatomical changes in the cervical region can lead to cervical myelopathy and paralysis .
different scores are used for the evaluation of myelopathy .
although the nurick score ( table 1 ) [ 5 ] , established in 1972 , is one of the most popular scores , the gradation between its levels is very imprecise .
the european myelopathy score ( ems , table 2 ) [ 6 ] of 2008 presents a new and more detailed scoring system .
in addition , we used janda 's classification ( j ) [ 7 ] for grading muscular strength .
this classification has six levels , ranging from zero for no muscular movement to five for full muscular strength .

case presentation the patient is a 63 - year - old caucasian man .
he is 1.61 meters tall and weighs 66 kilograms .
after working as a car mechanic for 36 years , he had been receiving disability benefits for 11 years .
he was working part - time as a caretaker averaging 10 hours per week until two and a half years ago .
at the age of 35 , the patient began having bouts of severe back pain approximately twice a year .
when these episodes occurred , he took non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs for three to four weeks for pain relief .
at the age of 40 , lumbar spondylolisthesis was diagnosed by radiography .
at the age of 50 , he suddenly developed severe right hip pain .
he suffered from substantial arthrosis on the right side , which was treated with a total hip replacement one year later .
three years ago , he began to develop neurological symptoms in both hands .
pain and loss of function of his fingers prevented him from working as a caretaker .
the pain radiated from his neck bilaterally down to his fingers and was described as parasthesia - like in nature .
he also complained of weakness in his hands .
left hand digit flexion was classified as j1 and right hand as j4 .
digit extension was classified as j4 on the left and j2 on the right and abduction on the left was classified as j0 and on the right as j1 .
the patient also had difficulty walking ( nurick 4 , ems 10 / 18 ) as he had to support himself using his surroundings in order to stand upright and was unable to walk unassisted .
he was referred to a neurologist by his general practitioner who in turn referred him to a neurosurgeon .
radiographs ( figure 1 ) magnetic resonance imaging ( figure 2 ) and computed tomography ( ct ) revealed a spondylolisthesis between c7 and t1 .
using the meyerding classification [ 8 ] , which was initially developed for grading the degree of lumbar spondylolisthesis , the patient would have been diagnosed with a cervico - thoracic spondylolisthesis of the second or third degree .
the spondylolisthesis , measured using the method developed by kawasaki et al .
[ 9 ] , was 13 mm. in view of the special nature of the case , a collaborative treatment between neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons was favored and subsequently implemented .
figure 1 lateral radiograph of the cervical spine shows a spondylolisthesis at c7 - t1 ( preoperative ) ; the sagittal diameter of t1 ( a ) was 22.6 mm and the horizontal displacement ( b ) between c7 and t1 was 13 mm. figure 2 magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine shows a compression of the spinal cord at c5 - c6 , c6 - c7 und c7 - t1 ( preoperative ) .
the surgical management was performed as follows : the patient was placed in the supine position .
the intervertebral disk at c7 - t1 was exposed using blunt dissection .
the disk was then removed to the point of the ligamentum flavum .
a subsequent resection of the lateral parts of the intervertebral discs significantly mobilized the spondylolisthesis .
the wound was closed and the patient was rotated to the prone position .
first , the dislocation between vertebras c7 and t1 was reduced while positioning the head .
subsequently , the lateral masses were prepared from a dorsal approach between c5 and t3 .
then , lateral mass - screws were inserted into c5 and c6 .
we had noticed considerable laxity between c6 and c7 .
in addition , c5 and c6 were naturally fused and we decided to include them in the instrumentation .
there was also a rigid displacement between c7 and t1 .
bicortical screws were then inserted into the transverse processes of t2 and t3 .
these were inserted into at least two segments from both sides in divergent directions .
the length of these screws was 10 to 12 mm , with a diameter of 3.2 mm. this was followed by a laminectomy .
since the roots of c7 and c8 were exposed , the lateral masses of c7 and c8 had to be resected .
longitudinal rods were placed .
proper reduction in lordosis and the preservation of a 5 mm intervertebral space between c7 and t1 were confirmed by radiograph .
set screws were used to fix the instrumentation in the desired position .
chips of cortical and cancellous bone were placed lateral to the longitudinal rods .
the dorsal wound was then closed .
the patient was again rotated to the supine position to reopen the ventral wound .
now , instead of the previously seen displacement , a large gap was visible between c7 and t1 .
the endplates between c7 and t1 were milled and the ligamentum flavum was resected using punches .
then , the spinal canal was exposed completely , using a caspar opener .
subsequently , a harms basket , filled with autograft bone chips , was inserted into the intervertebral space .
three drains were placed and the wound was closed .
for prophylactic infection control , the patient was perioperatively given intravenous 1.5 g cefuroxime twice a day for the next four days .
intraoperative and postoperative radiographs ( figure 3 and 4 ) were taken to confirm correct placement of the instrumentation .
figure 3 lateral radiograph of the cervical spine shows the treatment of the spondylolisthesis at c7 - t1 .
figure 4 anterior - posterior radiograph of the cervical spine shows the treatment of the spondylolisthesis at c7 - t1 ; the lower screws were fixed bicortically into the transverse processes of t2 and t3 .
following the operation , the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit .
his vital signs were stable enough for him to be transferred to the general postoperative recovery ward on the fourth postoperative day .
eleven days after surgery , the patient left the hospital and entered an orthopedic and neurologic rehabilitation program .
the pain and parasthesias in his fingers resolved after the operation .
two months postoperatively , his ability to walk had noticeably improved after completing his rehabilitation program ( nurick 3 ) .
today , two years postoperatively , the patient is able to walk without assistance ( nurick 2 ) .
flexion of the fingers on his left hand was graded as j3 and as j5 on the right hand .
extension of the fingers on his left hand was graded as j4 and as j2 on the right .
abduction was graded as j4 for his left hand and as j2 for his right hand ( ems 14 / 18 ) .
discussion decompression is the gold - standard to halt progression of cervical myelopathy caused by compression of the spinal cord .
it is well - known that recovery of motor and sensory functions can be significantly delayed or may not occur at all .
laminectomy is a conventional surgical treatment for cervical myelopathy [ 10 ] .
it is a quick and easy procedure with minimal blood loss .
its significant disadvantages , however , include the loss of cervical lordosis , a decrease in the range of motion and the possible occurrence of neck and shoulder complaints [ 11 ] .
it has been shown that compression of the spinal cord occurs in the articular segment rather than in the intraosseus segment .
a segmental partial laminectomy may , therefore , be sufficient to reduce the loss of cervical lordosis [ 12 ] .
a posterior stabilization at the time of the original decompressive procedure [ 13 ] may present another way to prevent the development of a kyphotic deformity .
for the treatment of spondylolisthesis , posterior stabilization alone does not provide adequate stabilization .
an anterior fusion , using a harms basket filled with autograft bone , provides the highest degree of stabilization [ 14 ] .
posterior stabilization was necessary as a laminectomy and resection of the lateral masses of c7 and c8 was determined to be the safest method to decompress the spinal cord and the c7 and c8 nerve roots .
a harms basket was placed ventrally to increase the stability of the fusion and to avoid fatigue of the posterior stabilization .
in the case presented here , a ventral - dorsal - ventral approach was used .
using this technique , it is possible to visually inspect the spinal cord and the spinal nerves .
because there was a natural fusion of the vertebrae along c5 and c6 and because of the laxity between c6 and c7 , it was not possible to use pedicle screws .
therefore , lateral mass screws had to be used .
irrespective of the case presented here , it has been shown that pedicle screws provide higher stability for lateral bending , flexion , extension and axial rotation compared to lateral mass screws [ 15 ] .
the fact that placing the lateral mass screws is faster proved to be an advantage in this case , as it made it possible to perform the ventral - dorsal - ventral operation in a single surgical session .
a point of criticism in the case presented here may be the poor reduction of the spondylolisthesis .
multilevel cervical corpectomy [ 10 ] , an alternative and popular surgical procedure , may present better options for an anatomic reduction in the treatment of degenerative cervical myelopathy .
however , because of the high level of displacement of the vertebral bodies there was the danger of creating a spinal cord lesion during the reduction procedure .
consequently , the decision was taken to forego cervical corpectomy .
this new technique of placing bicortical screws into the transverse processes was successful in our case .
in several complicated cases , such as tumor situations or cases of paraplegia of the upper thoracic spine , the senior author used this new technique of fixating small , bicortical screws into the transverse processes .
this technique provides a fast and safe method that does not require the use of intraoperative radiography for placement of the bicortical screws into the transverse processes .
conclusion no established surgical treatment exists for the case of a patient suffering from degenerative cervico - thoracic spondylolisthesis along with cervical myelopathy and a large displacement of the vertebrae .
as this case involved aspects of the fields of neurosurgery and orthopedics , it was an advantage to implement an interdisciplinary treatment .
a special technique was applied to place screws into the transverse processes .
this innovative treatment succeeded in halting the rapid progression of this patient 's cervical myelopathy and he had a positive outcome .

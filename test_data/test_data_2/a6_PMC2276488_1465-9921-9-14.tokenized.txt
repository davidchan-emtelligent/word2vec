background recurrent airway obstruction ( rao ) in horses is a naturally occurring dust - induced disease mainly characterized by bronchiolitis which shows histological and pathophysiological similarities to human chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) .
in human copd previous investigations indicated an association with chlamydophila psittaci infection .
the present study was designed ( 1 ) to clarify a possible role of this infectious agent in rao and ( 2 ) to investigate the suitability of this equine disorder as a model for human copd .
methods clinico - pathological parameters of a total of 45 horses ( 25 horses with clinical signs of rao and 20 clinically healthy controls ) were compared to histological findings in lung tissue samples and infection by chlamydiaceae using light microscopy , immunohistochemistry , and pcr .
results horses with clinical signs of rao vs. controls revealed more inflammatory changes in histology ( p = 0.01 ) , and a higher detection rate of chlamydia psittaci antigens in all cells ( p < 0.001 ) and bronchiolar epithelial cells alone ( p < 0.001 ) by immunohistochemistry .
the abundance of chlamydial inclusions increased with the severity of disease .
pcr was positive in 60 % of horses with rao vs. 45 % of the controls ( p = 0.316 ) .
ompa sequencing identified chlamydophila psittaci ( n = 9 ) and chlamydophila abortus ( n = 13 ) in both groups with no significant differences .
within the group of clinically healthy horses subgroups with no changes ( n = 15 ) and slight inflammation of the small airways ( n = 5 ) were identified .
also in the group of animals with rao subgroups with slight ( n = 16 ) and severe ( n = 9 ) bronchiolitis could be formed .
these four subgroups can be separated in parts by the number of cells positive for chlamydia psittaci antigens .
conclusion chlamydophila psittaci or abortus were present in the lung of both clinically healthy horses and those with rao .
immunohistochemistry revealed acute chlamydial infections with inflammation in rao horses , whereas in clinically healthy animals mostly persistent chlamydial infection and no inflammatory reactions were seen .
stable dust as the known fundamental abiotic factor in rao is comparable to smoking in human disease .
these results show that rao can be used as a model for human copd .
background recurrent airway obstruction ( rao ) in horses , formerly called equine chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) , is a very common illness [ 1 ] .
pathology is characterized by bronchiolitis [ 2,3 ] , which is similar to findings in human copd and advanced human pulmonary emphysema [ 4 ] .
organic dust exposure and endotoxin are relevant factors for chronic impairment of lung function in horses and are used in experimental animal studies to cause exacerbations [ 5,6 ] .
our own group detected chlamydophila psittaci ( cpp ) infection by pcr in 38 % of human patients with copd [ 7,8 ] , who were suffering from advanced pulmonary emphysema and underwent lung volume reduction surgery .
chlamydial antigens were shown in alveolar parenchyma and bronchioles .
cpp and also chlamydophila abortus ( cpa ) was detected in sputum samples from patients with exacerbations of copd as well [ 9 ] .
up to now , chlamydophila spp. have been rarely detected in horses with acute respiratory infections [ 10,11 ] .
mair and wills [ 12 ] found culturable chlamydiae in 5 % of equine nasal and conjunctival swabs in a prevalence study , but no association between isolation and clinical diseases was seen .
however , these low detection rates in the pre - pcr era may have been due to the known difficulties of culturing these obligate intracellular bacteria .
serologically antibody titres >= 32 against chlamydophila pneumoniae ( cppn ) were detected in 26.5 % of italian light horses .
some sera with high titres reacted weakly with cpp as well [ 13 ] .
but within aborted equine fetuses cpp has been found in high prevalence [ 14,15 ] in the present study lung tissue samples from horses with rao as well as a group of clinically healthy horses were examined by immunohistochemistry , immunofluorescence and pcr to assess the extent of chlamydial infection and its association with rao .
pcr positive samples were additionally evaluated by dna sequencing to define exactly the chlamydial species involved .
methods samples out of 948 horses , which were slaughtered or euthanized in the period between november 2002 and october 2004 in three western districts of westphalia , 26 horses were identified as possibly suffering from rao by questioning veterinarians and / or horse owners about reasons for slaughter or euthanasia .
slaughter was done according to federal law in authorized slaughterhouses and under control of a veterinarian .
euthanasia was practised by veterinarians following internationally recognized guidelines .
if the horses had shown respiratory disease history , symptoms and therapy as well as conditions of housing were evaluated in detail by using a standardized questionnaire , which is available as online addendum .
possible rao and control horses were clinically examined before slaughter or euthanasia .
the horses had to meet the following criteria [ additional file 1 ] : ( 1 ) chronic cough for at least 3 months duration ; ( 2 ) exercise intolerance ; ( 3 ) worsening of the symptoms due to dust ; ( 4 ) obvious biphasic expiratory dyspnoea with hypertrophy of mm. recti abdomini , inflated nostrils and nasal discharge ; ( 5 ) breathing frequency > 20 / min ; and ( 6 ) pathologic findings in lung auscultation .
as respiratory healthy controls served 20 horses which completely lacked these clinical criteria .
immediately after death , tissue was taken from 8 different lung regions of each horse and preserved for the following examinations .
light microscopic histology formalin - fixed lung tissue was embedded in paraffin wax ( tissuewax ( tm ) ; medite gmbh , burgdorf , germany ) , slices of 3 - 7 mum thickness were cut using a rotatory microtome ( microm gmbh , walldorf , germany ) , and stained with haematoxylin and eosin .
slices from the 8 tissue samples of each horse were evaluated for histological changes using a semi - quantitative score ( 0 - 4 ) in a blinded study .
no signs of bronchiolitis were scored with 0 points .
minimal infiltration of the bronchioli with lymphocytes was scored with 1 , slight inflammation with 2 , moderate bronchiolitis with some neutrophils with 3 , and severe changes with intraluminal aggregates of neutrophils with 4 points .
results from all 8 regions of each horse were added .
therefore a minimal score of 0 and a maximal score of 32 was possible .
one horse with rao - like respiratory symptoms and history revealed parasitic lung disease after histological investigation and was excluded therefore .
according to anamnesis , clinical findings and light microscopy , the remaining 45 horses were classified into four subgroups : i. clinically healthy horses without histological changes of rao ( n = 15 ) , ii. clinically healthy horses with a low inflammation score of 4 - 6 ( n = 5 ) , iii .
horses with clinical signs of rao , but without or with only slight histological changes and a score of 0 - 5 ( n = 16 ) , and iv. horses with symptoms and histological changes of rao with a score > 10 ( n = 9 ) .
immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence for immunohistochemistry , dewaxed slices were stained with a mouse anti - cp primary antibody ( biotrend , germany ; clone 73 / 0200 , dilution 1:60 ) for 2 hours at room temperature , followed by a peroxidase - based detection system ( histostain ( r ) - bulk - kit , zymed laboratories inc. , san francisco , usa ) according to the instructions of the manufacturer ) .
three high - power fields showing bronchioli were selected for counting all detectable vs. all cp - positive stained bronchiolar epithelial cells ( bec ) , type ii pneumocytes ( pii ) and macrophages ( mp ) separately , using a zeiss axiophot microscope ( carl zeiss , oberkochen , germany ) with a 40 - fold objective magnification and a digital imaging system ( diskus software , koenigswinter , germany ) .
for immunofluorescence , triple staining on dewaxed sections was done with a primary mouse monoclonal igg2b - antibody against cp ( biotrend , germany ; clone 73 / 0200 , dilution 1:100 ) and a primary mouse monoclonal igg1 - antibody mix against pan - cytokeratin ( biocarta , usa ; clones ae1 , ae3 , 5d3 , dilution 1:50 ) , as well as 4 ' , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindol - hydrochloride ( dapi , sigma , germany , working concentration 0.1 mug / ml ) .
alexa fluor 488 - conjugates of goat anti - mouse - igg1 ( dilution 1:400 ) , and alexa fluor 594 - conjugates of goat anti - mouse - igg2b ( dilution 1:400 ) were used as secondary antibodies ( molecular probes europe , leiden , the netherlands ) .
results were documented with a ccd - camera ( kappa , gleichen , germany ) attached to an olympus ix - 70 microscope ( olympus europe , hamburg , germany ) with 40 - fold objective magnification .
polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) lung tissue was collected immediately after slaughtering / euthanizing of the horses and stored at - 80degreesc .
dna was isolated from lung tissue using the high pure pcr template preparation kit ( roche diagnostics , mannheim , germany ) according to the instructions of the manufacturer .
5 mul of the dna extract were used as template in pcr .
samples were tested for cpp / cpa and cppn by a modified version of the nested pcr procedure described by kaltenboeck et al .
[ 16 ] which targets the ompa gene .
the first step was genus - specific amplification using primers 191chomp ( 5 ' - gci yti tgg gar tgy ggi tgy gci ac - 3 ') and chomp371 ( 5 ' - tta gaa ick gaa ttg igc rtt iay gtg igc igc - 3 ') .
for the second amplification , we used 1 mul of the genus - specific product and primer combination 218psitt ( 5 ' - gta att tci agc cca gca caa tty gtg - 3 ')/ chomp336s ( 5 ' - ccr caa gmt ttt ctr gay ttc awy ttg ttr at - 3 ') for cp , or 201chomp ( 5 ' - ggi gcw gmi ttc caa tay gci car tc - 3 ')/ pneum268 ( 5 ' - gta ctc caa tgt atg gca cta aag a - 3 ') , for cppn , respectively .
the sizes of specific amplicons are : 576 - 597 bp ( genus - specific product ) , and 389 - 404 bp for cp , or 244 bp for cppn after nested pcr .
a detailed protocol of the procedure was previously published by sachse and hotzel [ 17 ] and is given here : a. genus - specific detection of chlamydiae prepare a master mix of reagents for all amplification reactions of the series .
it should contain the following ingredients per 50 - mul reaction : 1 mul dntp mix ( 2 mm each ) , 1 mul primer 191chomp ( 20 pmol / mul ) , 1 mul primer chomp371 ( 20 pmol / mul ) , 5 mul reaction buffer ( 10x ) , 0.2 mul taq dna polymerase ( 5 u / mul ) , 40.8 mul h2o .
add template to each reaction vessel : 1 mul of dna extract from infected tissue or 5 mul of extract from swab samples .
include amplification controls : dna of a chlamydial reference strain ( positive control ) and water ( negative control 1 ) instead of sample extract .
run pcr according to the following temperature - time profile : initial denaturation at 95degreesc for 30 s , 35 cycles of denaturation ( 95degreesc for 30 s ) , primer annealing ( 50degreesc for 30 s ) and primer extension ( 72degreesc for 30 s ) .
correct amplification leads to the formation of a 576 - 597 - bp product specific for the genus chlamydia ( according to the new taxonomy : chlamydia and chlamydophila ). b. species - specific detection of chlamydiae prepare a master mix of reagents for all amplification reactions of the series .
it should contain the following ingredients per 50 - mul reaction : 1 mul dntp mix ( 2 mm each ) , 1 mul forward primer 201chomp + 1 mul reverse primer trach269 or pneum268 ( 20 pmol / mul each ) or 1 mul forward primer 204pecor or 218psitt + 1 mul reverse primer chomp336s ( 20 pmol / mul each ) , 5 mul reaction buffer ( 10x ) , 0.2 mul taq dna polymerase ( 5 u / mul ) , 40.8 mul h2o .
add 1 mul of the product from genus - specific pcr as template to each reaction vessel .
subject the products of positive control and negative control 1 ( 1 mul of each ) from the previous amplification to the second round of nested pcr .
additionally include a fresh reagent control ( negative control 2 ) .
run pcr according to the following temperature - time profile : initial denaturation at 95degreesc for 30 s , 20 cycles of denaturation ( 95degreesc for 30 s ) , primer annealing ( 60degreesc for 30 s ) and primer extension ( 72degreesc for 30 s ) .
the correct sizes of species - specific amplicons are 250 bp for c. trachomatis , 244 bp for c. pneumoniae , 389 - 404 bp for c. psittaci , and 426 - 441 bp for c. pecorum .
dna sequencing for species identification , products of the first pcr round were amplified using primers 201chomp and chomp336s .
specific bands from pcr products were cut out of the agarose gel ( 1 %) and dna was extracted using the qiaquick gel extraction kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) .
prior to processing on the abi prism 310 genetic analyzer ( applied biosystems ) , these extracts were subjected to cycle sequencing using the same primers as above and the bigdye ( tm ) terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit ( applied biosystems , darmstadt , germany ) .
the average length of the sequences determined was 400 nucleotides .
the species identity was established through blast search [ 18 ] .
sequence alignments and analysis were conducted using the vector nti suite 8.0 software package ( informax inc. , oxford , uk ) .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was done using spss , version 12 ( spss inc. , chicago , usa ) .
the data were statistically evaluated using mann - whitney - u - test , pearson chi square test and spearman - rho correlation ( 2 - sided ) .
a test value below 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .
results clinical data as a result of the standardized questionnaire and histology 45 out of a total of 948 horses were recruited for the present study .
43 animals were slaughtered and 2 euthanized .
the median age was 16.11 years ( span : 9 - 25 ) , among these were 23 mares , 20 geldings and 2 stallions .
concerning the respiratory system , 20 animals were considered clinically as healthy , whereas 25 showed clinical symptoms of rao ( table 1 ) .
lameness was the main cause to kill the horses ( 40 % in both groups ) .
in horses with rao , this disease was the reason for killing the animal in 36 % ; a respective therapy was applied in 56 % .
therapeutic regimens differed widely , thus not allowing further statistically evaluation .
the majority of horses both in the clinically healthy and the rao groups were housed in stables with straw bedding ( healthy controls : 75 % , rao : 68 %) .
outdoor housing was reported in 20 % of the controls and none of the histologically approved rao cases .
stable housing with wood shavings or linen straw was reported in 32 % of cases with rao and 5 % of controls , respectively .

in subgroups ii and iii the distribution of inclusions and antigens was typical for persistent chlamydial infections in ihc : inclusion bodies were only sparsely seen , but antigens were much more frequently found .
this was also true for subgroup 1 , but on a much lower level .
animals which were killed specifically because of rao ( n = 9 ) were significantly different in the median number of cp antigen - positive bronchiolar epithelial cells ( 83 vs. 42 , p = 0.037 ) compared to horses which were put down due to other reasons ( n = 36 ) .
results of clinical data and histological evaluation of the 45 horses led to the classification shown in table 2 .
the four subgroups were significantly different from each other in their light microscopy histological score ( mann - whitney u - test , p < 0.05 ) .
age was not significantly correlated to the histological score ( spearman - rho , p = 0.425 ) .

cp antigens were shown in bronchiolar epithelial cells ( figures 2 , 3 and 4 ) as well as occasionally in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages ( figures 4 and 5 ) .
type ii pneumocytes were positive in 12 cases ( 3 in subgroup i , 1 in subgroup iii , 8 in subgroup iv ) , and in 6 cases positive staining was also seen in macrophages ( 1 in subgroup i , 5 in subgroup iv ) .
data and significant differences are shown in detail in table 2. with increased severity of disease there was a significant rise in antigen - positive cells .
age was not significantly correlated with immunohistological parameters ( spearman rho , p > 0.05 ) .
positive and significant spearman - rho correlations were found between all of the following parameters : light microscopy score , the number of cp antigen - positive macrophages , type ii pneumocytes and bronchiolar epithelial cells .
however , the highest correlation coefficient ( r = 0.612 ) was found between the number of cp antigen - positive type ii pneumocytes and the number of cp antigen - positive macrophages , the lowest correlation coefficient found was r = 0.41 between the number of cp antigen - positive macrophages and the histological score ( table 3 ) .

polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and dna sequencing no significant differences were seen between clinically healthy and sick horses ( table 1 ) .
pcr revealed cp dna in 5 of 15 (= 33.3 %) horses in subgroup i , 4 of 5 (= 80 %) in subgroup ii , 13 of 16 (= 81.2 %) in subgroup iii and 2 of 9 (= 22.2 %) in subgroup iv. significant differences in pcr positivity are shown between subgroups i and iii as well as between subgroups iii and iv ( table 2 ) .
to confirm the identity of the chlamydial species , dna from 22 of the 24 positive samples was sequenced in the ompa gene region ( approximately 400 bp ) .
a blast search of these sequences revealed close to 100 % homology to the species cpp in 9 and cpa in 13 cases .
no significant differences were found between the four subgroups ( pearson chi square test , p = 0.309 ) .
discussion one principal characteristic of rao is the excessive production of mucus containing high amounts of neutrophils [ 19 ] .
in human copd , mucus hypersecretion is a key event as well , but neutrophils are only dominant in exacerbations [ 20 ] .
these exacerbations are mainly associated with viral and / or bacterial infections [ 21 ] .
in equine rao , high levels of collagenolytic activity [ 22 ] and matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) 8 , 9 and 13 [ 22 - 25 ] were found to be useful markers for ongoing disease .
the release of matrix metalloproteinases ( mmp - 9 ) is shown to be stimulated by chlamydial heat shock protein 60 [ 26 ] .
release of mmps is also crucial for tissue destruction by macrophages in human emphysema [ 27 ] and increased activities of mmp - 8 and mmp - 9 are found in induced sputum of humans with copd [ 28 ] .
elevated il - 8 and tumor necrosis factor - alpha production are seen in horses with rao exacerbation [ 19,29 ] and in humans with copd [ 30 ] .
the proinflammatory granulocyte - attracting chemokine il - 8 is produced by epithelial cells in the course of infection with cpp [ 31 ] .
decreased phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophages ( mp ) is found in rao after 24 h stimulation with lps or pma and ionomycin [ 19 ] .
in current non - smokers with copd mp show reduced capacity to ingest apoptotic airway epithelial cells as well [ 32 ] .
both rao and copd have to be regarded as multicausal diseases with abiotic and biotic factors .
the main etiologically relevant factor in both rao and copd is an external event ( abiotic factor ) , i.e. environmental dust exposure in horses and cigarette smoking in human beings .
optimal housing can certainly prevent equine rao in many cases as well as avoidance of smoking will prevent copd .
some authors even regard human copd as a dust - induced disease and emphasize the role of kaolinite [ 33 ] .
genetic ( biotic ) factors are relevant in rao [ 34 ] and copd as well [ 35 ] .
according to the findings of the present study the predominant location for chlamydial antigens in horse lungs are the bronchial epithelial cells , followed to a much lesser extent by type ii pneumocytes and macrophages .
for bronchiolar epithelial cells as well as for the total percentage of cp antigen - positive cells , there is a highly significant higher antigen load in rao horses in comparison to healthy controls .
since the first step in the inflammation cascade is caused by inhalation of dust particles , the bronchiolar epithelium represents most likely the " key structure " in establishing and maintaining the disease .
concurrent infection of these cells with chlamydial organisms might lead to chronicity and persistence of the exaggerated inflammatory and tissue destructing response to dust particles .
distribution of cp antigens in the lungs of clinically healthy horses ( subgroups i and ii ) was typical for persisting infection and in those with rao and histological severe disease ( subgroup iv ) for acute chlamydial infection .
the subgroup with slight inflammation and higher cp antigen load within the group of healthy horses could be an indicator of preclinical disease .
the same questions come around according to the subgroups within rao animals .
although no significant morphological differences were seen between healthy horses with slight inflammation ( subgroup ii ) and those with rao and low histological score ( subgroup iii ) there are severe clinical differences , which can be interpretated only functionally , probably on a genetic background .
pcr positivity shows significant differences between subgroups i and iii as well as between subgroups iii and iv. this means that there is a significant difference also by pcr between healthy horses and horses that already present with clinical signs of rao , but show no or only slight signs of inflammation and also between ill horses with only slight inflammation compared with those with marked inflammation .
furthermore , it is known that farmers more often suffer from respiratory symptoms than the average population [ 36 ] .
dust exposure and higher endotoxin concentrations in stables are supposed to be the main factors [ 37 ] .
the possible importance of chlamydiaceae as a source of human infections in animal housings requires further evaluation .
conclusion for the first time persistence of cpp and cpa in the lungs of clinically healthy horses and acute ( possibly reactivated ) chlamydial infections in those with obvious disease is demonstrated .
respiratory chlamydial infection probably becomes clinically relevant only in animals affected by additional pathogenic factors .
in this context , inflammation seems to be associated with the activation of chlamydiae .
furthermore , the high prevalence of these chlamydial agents in horse lungs deserves further attention as a reservoir , especially in the light of recent studies , showing an association of cpp with cases of equine abortion [ 14,15 ] .
the possible risk to acquire cpp or cpa infections for the staff in animal housings has to be evaluated .
corresponding pathophysiological aspects ( target cell types , cytokine / chemokine release , tissue degrading enzymes like mmps ) between chlamydial infections on the one hand and rao / copd on the other hand are shown .
the precise role of chlamydial organisms in the pathogenesis of rao / copd needs further investigations .
because of the pathophysiological similarities between both diseases and the detection of chlamydiaceae , rao could be a model for human copd and should be studied under these aspects .

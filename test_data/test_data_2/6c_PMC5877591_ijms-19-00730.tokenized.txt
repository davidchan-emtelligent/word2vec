t helper type 17 ( th17 ) cells and ptreg cells , which share a common precursor cell ( the naive cd4 t cell ) , require a common tumor growth factor ( tgf ) - beta signal for initial differentiation .
however , terminally differentiated cells fulfill opposite functions : th17 cells cause autoimmunity and inflammation , whereas treg cells inhibit these phenomena and maintain immune homeostasis .
thus , unraveling the mechanisms that affect the th17 / treg cell balance is critical if we are to better understand autoimmunity and tolerance .
recent studies have identified many factors that influence this balance ; these factors range from signaling pathways triggered by t cell receptors , costimulatory receptors , and cytokines , to various metabolic pathways and the intestinal microbiota .
this review article summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the th17 / treg balance and its implications with respect to autoimmune disease .
th17 treg balance autoimmunity rorgammat foxp3 1 .
introduction the immune system provides essential protection against pathogenic microorganisms ; however , it may also attack self tissue .
cd4 t cells coordinate diverse immune responses to deal with various disease - causing pathogens .
naive cd4 t cells are activated upon binding of the t cell receptor ( tcr ) and a costimulatory receptor ( cd28 ) to the peptide - major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) complex and a costimulatory molecule ( b7.1 or b7.2 ) , respectively ; the latter are expressed / presented by antigen - presenting cells ( apcs ) .
activated cd4 t cells differentiate into several subsets of effector cells that have different functions .
these cell types include t helper type i ( th1 ) , th2 , th17 , t follicular helper ( tfh ) , and regulatory t ( treg ) cells [ 1 ] .
the final fate is primarily determined by the external milieu ( e.g. , cytokines ) present during activation .
th1 cells stimulate classical macrophages and mediate immune responses to intracellular pathogens .
th2 cells stimulate mast cells , eosinophils , and basophils , and mediate immune responses to helminths .
th17 cells stimulate many cell types to recruit neutrophils to sites of infection , and mediate immune responses against extracellular bacteria and fungi .
tfh cells stimulate b cell maturation at germinal centers .
treg cells inhibit immune responses to maintain immune homeostasis .
among the subsets , th1 and th17 cells can cause , but treg cells suppress , autoimmune disease .
here , i will focus the role of th17 cells and treg cells in autoimmunity .
2. the th17 / treg balance in autoimmunity th17 cells and treg cells share a common signaling pathway mediated by tgf - beta .
however , proinflammatory signals present during cell activation regulate the fate of these cells reciprocally [ 1,2 ] .
for example , in the presence of interleukin ( il ) - 6 or il - 21 ( together with tgf - beta ) , naive cd4 + t cells differentiate into th17 cells ; however , in the absence of proinflammatory cytokines , tgf - beta drives differentiation into treg cells [ 3,4,5 ] .
th17 cells produce il - 17 , il - 22 , and il - 23 , recruit neutrophils , and promote inflammation at the infection site. by contrast , treg cells produce anti - inflammatory cytokines il - 10 and tgf - beta , suppress activity of a variety of immune cells , and thereby inhibit immune responses .
thus , these two cell types play opposite roles during inflammatory and immune responses [ 6 ] .
th17 cells are a major player in autoimmune diseases , such as psoriasis , inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , and multiple sclerosis ( ms ) .
stat3 is activated upon stimulation by tcr / costimulatory signals , together with tgf - beta and il - 6 [ 3,4,5 ] ; stat3 then induces expression of transcription factor rar - related orphan receptor ( ror ) gammat , which derives cells toward the th17 subset [ 7 ]. by contrast , treg cells inhibit autoimmune responses .
treg cells arise either during thymic development , or in the periphery , via activation of naive cd4 t cells .
thymus - derived treg cells are called ttreg cells , whereas periphery - derived treg cells are called ptreg cells .
ttreg cells are generated by receiving relatively strong tcr stimulation by self - antigen - mhc complexes on thymic apcs , which leads to foxp3 expression .
on the other hand , ptreg cells are generated from naive cd4 t cells by receiving antigen stimulation under the influence of tgf - beta and il - 2 in the periphery .
ptreg cells are prevalent in certain organs , such as the gut and maternal placenta .
thus , ptreg cells are considered to play an important role in maintaining tolerance against foods , commensal bacterial , and the fetus during pregnancy .
stimulation of naive cd4 t cells with tgf - beta induces smad2 and smad3 , which in turn activate transcription factor foxp3 ; this drives cells toward the ptreg lineage [ 8 ] .
in addition , il - 2 induces stat5 , which activates foxp3 .
foxp3 + treg cells can also be induced by tgf - beta and il - 2 in vitro ; these cells are called itreg cells .
other types of cells that have suppressive functions are th3 , t regulatory type 1 ( tr1 ) , and glucocorticoid - induced tnfr - related protein ( gitr ) single - positive ( gitrsp ) cells [ 9,10,11 ] .
th3 cells produce tgf - beta , and are foxp3 + [ 9 ] ; tr1 cells produce il - 10 , and are foxp3 - [ 10 ] ; and gitrsp cells express gitr but low cd25 , and produce high amounts of il - 10 and tgf - beta [ 11 ] .
i will focus on the cd4 + foxp3 + treg cells in this review .
th17 cells cause , whereas treg cells inhibit , autoimmunity .
thus , the reciprocal generation of th17 and treg cells is critically important .
many factors that influence the generation and maintenance of these cells are also important for appropriate regulation of the th17 / treg balance ; these include tcr signals , costimulatory signals , cytokine signals , foxp3 stability , metabolic processes , and the microbiota .
below , i explain what we know about these factors , their role ( s ) in regulating the th17 / treg balance , and the implications for development of autoimmunity .
3. tcr signaling signaling via the tcr is required for activation of naive t cells ( figure 1 ) .
when the tcr , together with co - receptors cd4 or cd8 , binds to the peptide - mhc complex on the surface of apcs , the immunoreceptor tyrosine - based activation motifs ( itams ) in the cytoplasmic tails of the cd3 chains are located in close proximity to protein kinase lck , which is associated with the cytoplasmic tail of the co - receptor ; this results in phosphorylation of the itams .
a phosphorylated itam recruits the protein kinase zap70 , which then phosphorylates adaptor molecules slp - 76 and lat .
tcr / costimulatory signals also activate pi3k , which generates phosphatidylinositol ( 3,4,5 ) - trisphosphate ( pip3 ) from pi ( 4,5 ) p2 .
pip3 recruits ph domain - containing proteins such as akt , il - 2 inducible t - cell kinase ( itk ) , phospholipase c ( plc ) - gamma , guanine nucleotide exchange factor vav , and adhesion and degranulation promoting adaptor protein ( adap ) on the cell membrane .
plc - gamma binds to the slp - 76 / gads / linker for activated t cells ( lat ) complex , and is phosphorylated and activated by itk .
activated plc - gamma cleaves the membrane lipid pip2 to yield dag and ip3 .
ip3 binds to a calcium channel on the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) and promotes release of ca ++ from the er reservoir .
ca2 + release stimulates oligomerization of stromal interaction molecule ( stim ) on the er membrane , and subsequently activates plasma membrane ca2 + channel orai1 , which eventually increases the ca2 + concentration in the cytoplasm .
ca2 + acts on the calmodulin / calcineurin pathway , which activates the transcription factor nfat .
dag activates two signaling pathways : the ras / raf / mapk pathway ( which eventually induces transcription factor ap - 1 ) and pkc - theta , to stimulate formation of the carma1 / bcl10 / malt1 complex , which then recruits and activates the traf - 6 / tak1 / ikk pathway and , eventually , activates transcription factor nf - kappab .
accumulated evidence shows that the strength of the tcr signal affects ttreg cell development in the thymus [ 12 ] .
attenuated tcr signals , caused by deficiency or mutation of tcr signaling components , such as zap70 [ 13 ] , lat [ 14,15 ] , plcgamma1 [ 16 ] , stim [ 17 ] , dag [ 18,19 ] , raf [ 20,21 ] , or nf - kappab [ 22,23,24,25 ] , results in defective ttreg cell development .
however , in contrast to these results , attenuated tcr signal can promote ttreg cell generation .
a phosphorylation - deficient cd3zeta mutant , which shows attenuated tcr signaling , promotes ttreg cell generation [ 26 ] .
indeed , akt activity is increased in cd3zeta mutant t cells [ 26 ] .
akt activates mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mtor ) , which in turn inhibits treg cell generation .
thus , development of ttreg cells may require a tcr signal of a certain strength or a particular method of tcr ligation [ 12 ]. whether tcr signal strength also regulates ptreg and itreg cell differentiation is less well understood .
although differentiation of itreg cells requires ikk and ca2 + signals [ 27,28,29 ] , it also requires a weak signal from the tcr [ 30 ] .
attenuated tcr signaling in itk - / - cells activates phosphatase and tensin homolog ( pten ) and inhibits the akt / mtor pathway , resulting in preferential differentiation into treg cells rather than th17 cells [ 30 ] .
although activation of pten drives treg cell differentiation , diminished expression of pten is also detrimental for th17 cell differentiation because it increases il - 2 production [ 31 ] ; this suggests that extreme pten levels ( low or high ) disrupt the th17 / treg balance .
thus , similar to mtor , it seems that a certain pten level is required to maintain an appropriate th17 / treg cell balance .
it is not clear why ttreg and itreg cells need different tcr signal strengths or a particular method of tcr ligation for development / differentiation ; nonetheless , what we do know is that the tcr signal is important for treg cell development and for reciprocal regulation of treg versus th17 differentiation .
the tcr signal is also important for suppressive function of treg cells .
deficiency or mutation of tcr signaling components zap70 , lat , stim , and nf - kappab leads to reduced suppressor activity [ 15,17,32,33 ] .
besides activating nf - kappab and nfat , the tcr signal activates akt , which in turn suppresses foxo1 .
foxo1 is required to maintain treg suppressive activity as it suppresses ifn - gamma and induces transcription factor klf2 and chemokine receptor ccr7 [ 34 ] .
proteins that modify or fine - tune the tcr signaling pathway also influence the th17 / treg balance .
sharpin , a ubiquitin - binding and ubiquitin - like - domain - containing protein , promotes treg cell differentiation , but prevents conventional t cell differentiation by inhibiting the interaction between tcrzeta and zap70 [ 35 ] .
deletion or pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase casein kinase 2 ( ck2 ) blocks th17 differentiation and induction of treg cells [ 36,37,38 ] .
deleting or inhibiting ck2 dampens the stat3 and mtor signaling pathways [ 36,37,38 ] .
protein phosphatase 2a ( pp2a ) regulates mtorc1 activity .
treg cell - specific deletion of pp2a causes severe multi - organ autoimmune disease , suggesting that pp2a is required for treg cell function [ 39 ] .
4. costimulatory signals activation and differentiation of naive t cells requires costimulatory signals from apcs .
costimulatory molecules b7.1 ( cd80 ) and b7.2 ( cd86 ) on the apc surface bind to cd28 on naive t cells .
costimulatory signals are thought to amplify the tcr signal .
the cytoplasmic tail of cd28 contains docking sites for signaling molecules [ 40 ] .
the membrane proximal ymnm motif binds to pi3k , and the distal pyap motif binds to grb2 and lck [ 40 ] .
costimulatory signals are required for both ttreg and ptreg cell generation ; indeed , mice deficient in cd28 signaling harbor reduced numbers of both treg types , leading to autoimmune diseases [ 41 ] .
cd28 signaling is essential for homeostasis and function of peripheral treg cells .
tamoxifen - mediated deletion of the cd28 gene reduces the number of treg cells in the periphery [ 42 ] .
this reduction is not due to differences in thymic export , but rather to impaired proliferation of treg cells [ 42 ] .
likewise , foxp3 - cre - mediated deletion of cd28 in autoimmune disease models causes loss of suppressive activity by treg cells [ 43 ] .
cd28 signals induce expression of mir17 - 92 family members , leading to accumulation of antigen - specific treg cells and maximal il - 10 production by treg cells [ 44 ] .
treg - specific deletion of mir - 17 - 92 causes exacerbated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( eae ) , an animal model of ms [ 44 ] .
cd28 recruits lck and activates nf - kappab , leading to ttreg cell development [ 45 ] .
in addition , cd28 , together with the tcr , promotes expression of gitr , ox40 , and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 ( tnfr2 ) , leading to ttreg cell generation [ 46 ] .
costimulatory signals are also required to generate itreg cells ; the lck - binding motif within the cd28 cytoplasmic domain is indispensable for this [ 47 ] .
however , strong lck signaling through cd28 inhibits itreg cell differentiation , a role opposite to that played during ttreg cell development [ 48,49 ] .
in addition to costimulatory molecules , t cells also express receptors that inhibit tcr signals ; these are called co - inhibitory receptors .
co - inhibitory receptors attenuate and / or terminate activation signals initiated by stimulatory receptors .
treg cells express abundant co - inhibitory receptors such as ctla - 4 , pd - 1 , and lag - 3 [ 50 ] .
since costimulatory and co - inhibitory pathways regulate t cell activation , they have been studied extensively in the context of autoimmunity [ 50 ] .
in general , blocking co - inhibitory receptors increases immune responses , because it unrestrains t cell activity [ 50 ] ; however , co - inhibitory receptors are shared by both conventional t cells and treg cells .
although we still do not know how these pathways play treg - specific roles , we do know that blocking these co - inhibitory pathways using anti - pd1 and anti - ctla - 4 antibodies promotes anti - cancer activity ; such blocking antibodies are used widely for cancer treatment [ 51 ] .
thus , the same principles may apply with respect to regulation of immune cell activity and other areas of immune - related disease , such as chronic infection [ 52 ] .
5. cytokine signaling cytokines are the most powerful determinant of cd4 t cell fate .
as mentioned above , both th17 and treg cells require tgf - beta signals .
at the initial stage , tgf - beta induces both th17 and treg cell programs [ 53 ] ; however , the presence of il - 6 is a critical determinant of subsequent cell fate decisions .
il - 6 drives th17 cell differentiation by phosphorylating and activating stat3 , which then induces th17 - specific genes , such as rorc , il17 , and il23r [ 3,4,5,54,55 ] .
stat3 also inhibits treg cell differentiation by downregulating tgf - beta - induced expression of foxp3 [ 5,56,57 ] .
the effect of il - 6 is bolstered by other proinflammatory cytokines , including il - 1beta , il - 21 , il - 23 , and tnf - alpha [ 3,53,58 ] .
although the combination of il - 6 plus tgf - beta is a critical driver of th17 cell differentiation , it is not sufficient for full acquisition of pathogenic properties by th17 cells , since tgf - beta plus il - 6 also induce il - 10 [ 59 ] .
for pathogenicity , th17 cells require an il - 23 signal along with il - 6 plus tgf - beta , to induce il - 23 receptor expression [ 56,60,61 ] .
on the other hand , tgf - beta and il - 2 are essential for treg cell differentiation .
tgf - beta signaling phosphorylates and activates the transcription factors sma - and mad - related protein ( smad ) 2 and smad3 [ 62 ] , which then bind to the foxp3 locus and induce expression of the foxp3 gene .
il - 2 signaling is also important for treg cell homeostasis [ 63,64 ] .
il - 2 signaling phosphorylates stat5 , which binds to the foxp3 locus and induces expression of foxp3 [ 65 ] .
however , tgf - beta inhibits differentiation of th1 and th2 cells , and il - 2 inhibits that of th17 cells [ 66,67 ] .
6. metabolic pathways metabolic reprogramming and external signals that modulate metabolic pathways can affect the th17 / treg balance .
naive t cells need little energy and , therefore , utilize oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation pathways [ 68 ] .
in general , activated effector t cells become anabolic to meet the demands of cell proliferation and growth ; therefore , they rely on glycolysis for atp synthesis [ 69 ]. by contrast , treg cells are catabolic ; therefore , they metabolize fatty acids and amino acids , as well as glucose , and use oxidative phosphorylation to synthesize atp [ 69 ] .
the influence of metabolic reprogramming on t cell differentiation and function was discovered by examining mtor .
mtor acts as an integrator of environmental signals supplied by growth factors , nutrients , oxygen , and energy levels [ 70 ] .
when naive t cells are activated , mtor is activated and acts as a critical regulator that modulates t cell differentiation and function [ 71 ] .
mtor forms two multiprotein complexes : mtor complex 1 ( mtorc1 ) and mtor complex 2 ( mtorc2 ) .
proper function of these complexes is required for upregulation of glycolysis and for differentiation into specific effector subsets .
deficiency of both mtorc1 and mtorc2 renders naive cd4 t cells unable to upregulate the glycolytic machinery needed to support effector function , leading to a regulatory phenotype instead [ 68 ] .
in addition , the mtor inhibitor rapamycin promotes foxp3 expression and expands existing ttreg cells [ 72,73 ] .
defective mtor activity affects the th17 / treg cell balance by increasing the sensitivity of t cells to tgf - beta , thereby rendering the cells insensitive to the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on stat3 signaling [ 74 ] .
in ex vivo cultured cells and in human transplantation models , rapamycin shifts the th17 / treg balance toward tregs [ 75 ] .
although complete inhibition of mtor leads to a shift toward treg cells , inhibition of individual mtorc complexes produces different results .
mice deficient in mtorc1 activity cannot generate th17 responses [ 76 ]. by contrast , inhibition of mtorc2 activity does not affect th17 responses [ 76 ] .
th17 cells rely on acetyl - coa carboxylase 1 - mediated de novo fatty acid synthesis and the underlying glycolytic - lipogenic metabolic pathway for their differentiation [ 77 ]. by contrast , treg cells depend on oxidative phosphorylation and importation of fatty acids from outside the cell [ 77 ] .
th17 cell differentiation can be enhanced by hif1 - alpha , which is a critical sensor of hypoxia and is responsible for mediating cellular responses to low oxygen .
when hif1 - alpha is induced by mtorc1 , it upregulates the glycolytic pathway and induces rorgammat ; however , it inhibits foxp3 , leading to th17 cell differentiation [ 78 ] .
7. microbiota the gastrointestinal tract has a very large surface area and makes contact with many foodborne and microbial antigens .
the gut is colonized by a huge number of commensal microorganisms , collectively known as the microbiota .
since most antigens derived from food and from the commensal microbiota are not harmful , immune responses against such antigens must be suppressed .
thus , the gut is a place in which immune tolerance is paramount for maintenance of immune homeostasis .
the gut is covered by dense layers of mucus .
although most microorganisms do not adhere to epithelial cells by passing through these layers , some pathogens or pathobionts attempt to do so. recent studies have begun to elucidate the way in which microorganisms influence the th17 / treg balance [ 79 ] .
segmented filamentous bacteria ( sfb ) induce th17 cell differentiation in the small intestine , and other tissues during autoimmune inflammation [ 80,81,82,83 ] .
sfb antigens are presented to cd4 t cells by dendritic cells ( dcs ) , leading to differentiation into sfb - specific th17 cells [ 84,85 ] .
sfb colonization boosts immune responses against the microbiota by inducing iga , antimicrobial peptides , and proinflammatory cytokines [ 80,81,86 ] .
intestinal barrier immunity is regulated by the il - 23 receptor and il - 22 pathways .
breach of the intestinal barrier , or its penetration by microorganisms or their products , activates the il - 23 pathway and th17 responses [ 87 ] .
il - 23 also acts on type 3 innate lymphoid cells to stimulate epithelial cells to produce serum amyloid a proteins 1 and 2 , leading to th17 cell differentiation in the intestine [ 88 ] .
bacteriodes fragilis protects against experimental colitis by releasing polysaccharide a ( psa ) , which reduces production of il - 17 by immune cells in the intestine and promotes differentiation into il - 10 - producing foxp3 + treg cells [ 89,90 ] .
likewise , bacteriodes thetaiotamicron plays an anti - inflammatory role by controlling ppar - gamma trafficking between the nucleus and cytoplasm [ 91 ] .
clostridia induce treg cells in the gut .
colonization of germ - free ( gf ) mice by a mixture of 46 clostridium strains belonging to clusters xiva and iv induces ptreg cells [ 92 ] .
moreover , a mixture of 17 strains belonging to clostidiales clusters vi , xiva , and xviii induces treg cells [ 93 ] .
furthermore , colonization of gf mice with a mixture of benign commensal microbiota triggers generation of treg cells and inhibits th17 - mediated immune responses [ 94 ] , suggesting that the microbiota play a vital role in treg cell induction in the intestine .
although it is not clear how commensal microorganisms induce treg cells in the gut , the role of microbial metabolites in triggering treg cell differentiation is becoming clearer .
short - chain fatty acids ( scfas ) produced by clostridales induce treg cell differentiation [ 95,96,97 ] .
oral administration of scfas contributes to treg cell trafficking to the colon by inducing g - protein receptor ( gpr ) 15 [ 98 ] .
scfas also induce the epigenetic status of treg cells .
butyrate , a type of scfa , inhibits proinflammatory cytokines by blocking histone deacetylases in macrophages and dcs [ 96,99 ] , and by promoting acetylation of histone h3 in treg cells at the foxp3 locus [ 97 ] .
disturbance of the normal microbiota is called dysbiosis .
it is widely accepted that dysbiosis may be the cause of chronic inflammation associated with ibd [ 100 ] , although the underlying mechanisms are not clear .
dysbiosis can affect the th17 / treg balance in ibd .
in the normal intestine , the microbial community is diverse and maintained by interactions with the host immune system ; in particular , iga and antimicrobial peptides that protect mucus layers outside of epithelial cells [ 101 ] .
however , during dysbiosis this balance is disturbed , and overgrowth of pathobionts occurs .
pathobionts try to attach to or invade intestinal epithelial cells , thereby triggering innate signaling pathways such as the inflammasome , toll - like receptors , and nucleotide - binding oligomerization domain ( nod ) - like receptors ; this leads to production of proinflammatory cytokines ( il - 1beta , il - 6 , il - 12 , il - 18 , and il - 23 ) [ 101 ] , which then tip the th17 / treg balance toward th17 cells .
8. plasticity of th17 and treg cells cd4 t cell subsets are not fixed ; rather , they can change into other subsets when stimulated by different cytokines .
this flexibility is called plasticity [ 102 ] .
for example , when th17 cells are stimulated by ifn - gamma , they convert to th1 cells .
although it is unclear whether treg cells convert into effector subsets , many studies report that they can , particularly under lymphopenic or inflammatory conditions [ 103 ] .
a study using lineage - tracing mice identified a substantial portion of extreg cells ( cells that once expressed foxp3 but lost it later ) in mice .
when these extreg cells were adoptively transferred , they induced diabetes and expressed proinflammatory cytokines ( ifn - gamma and il - 17 ) , suggesting that they were activated memory cells [ 104 ] .
another study based on a similar approach shows that il - 17 - expressing extreg cells are responsible for inflammation associated with autoimmune arthritis [ 105 ]. by contrast , a study using different lineage - tracing mice showed an opposite result .
in these mice , foxp3 + cells hardly lost foxp3 expression under both homeostatic and autoimmune inflammatory conditions , suggesting that treg cells are highly stable [ 106 ] .
further studies are needed to resolve this issue .
on the other hand , transdifferentiation from th17 cells to tr1 cells has been reported .
an experiment using lineage - tracing mice with th17 - mediated colitis revealed that th17 cells acquire the signature transcriptional profile and potent suppressive functions of tr1 cells [ 107 ] .
since rorgammat and foxp3 are lineage - determining transcription factors expressed by th17 and treg cells , respectively , transcriptional and post - transcriptional regulation of these proteins affects the th17 / treg balance [ 108,109,110 ] .
the stability of rorgammat and foxp3 is regulated by many post - transcriptional modifications , including ubiquitination , acetylation , and phosphorylation [ 110 ] .
a recent study shows that reciprocal differentiation of th17 / treg cells is also regulated by tead transcription factors taz and tead1 [ 111 ] .
taz expressed by th17 cells acts as a cofactor for rorgammat , and destabilizes foxp3 , whereas tead1 expressed by treg cells sequesters taz [ 111 ] .
in addition to these proteins , others also affect the th17 / treg balance .
transcription factor bach2 suppresses effector t cell differentiation , while at the same time promoting treg cell differentiation ; indeed , bach2 - deficient mice show fulminant inflammation [ 112 ] .
transcription factor yy1 inhibits treg cell function by preventing foxp3 transcription and transcriptional activity [ 113 ] .
transcription factor batf3 shifts the balance toward th17 by inhibiting transcription of foxp3 by repressing transcription of foxp3 [ 114 ] .
other factors are also thought to regulate the th17 / treg balance ; such factors may provide new therapeutic options for autoimmune diseases .
9. autoimmune diseases caused by dysregulation of the th17 / treg balance since differentiation of th17 and treg cells is regulated reciprocally by shared and different cytokines , and since each subset can convert to the other under certain inflammatory conditions , it is not surprising that the th17 / treg balance plays a critically important role in many autoimmune diseases .
indeed , the th17 / treg ratio is increased in patients with ra , psoriasis , ms , and ibd [ 115,116,117 ] .
among these , ra has been extensively studied from the perspective of the th17 / treg balance .
ra is characterized by chronic inflammation of the joint synovium , which results in destruction of bone and cartilage .
th17 cells are thought to be the main driver of pathogenesis by initiating inflammation via activation of many cell types within the inflamed joint , including macrophages , dcs , and synoviocytes .
accumulated evidence suggests that the th17 / treg balance underlies the pathogenic mechanisms driving autoimmune diseases [ 118,119 ] .
therapeutic approaches designed to correct the balance have proven effective , and have been approved for the treatment of ra , psoriasis , psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis , systemic lupus erythematosus , ms , and ibd [ 118,119 ] .
therapeutic approaches aimed at neutralizing th17 - related cytokines ( including il - 6 , tnf - alpha , il - 17 , and il - 23 ) using monoclonal antibodies have been quite successful [ 118,119 ] .
monoclonal antibodies against the human il - 6r , tocilizumab and sarilumab , affect the ratio of th17 / treg cells by reducing th17 but increasing treg cell levels in ra patients [ 120,121,122 ] .
in addition , therapies designed to target rorgammat , stat3 , foxp3 , and foxo1 using small molecules are being developed [ 118,119 ] .
digoxin , an inhibitor of rorgammat , ameliorates eae and collagen - induced arthritis , an animal disease model of ra , by reducing the th17 / treg ratio [ 123 ] .
10. conclusions and perspective since many autoimmune diseases are driven by th17 cells and suppressed by treg cells , the balance between these cell types is critically important for pathogenesis , prognosis , and therapy .
in addition to cytokine signals , this balance is affected by tcr and costimulatory signaling , metabolic pathways , and the microbiota ( figure 2 ) .
treating autoimmune diseases by correcting this balance is effective , particularly for ra [ 119 ] .
however , the drugs that work for ra are not equally effective against other autoimmune diseases [ 119 ] , suggesting different etiologies and pathogeneses .
therefore , further studies should focus on identifying suitable therapeutic approaches for other autoimmune conditions .
in addition , antigen - specific therapies are not widely available , and most therapeutic drugs have side effects .
approaches that target disease - specific antigens are needed .

simplified view of signaling pathways through tcr and costimulatory signal .
tcr binds to peptide - mhc and cd28 binds to b7.1 or b7.2 on the surface of apc .
signaling pathways ultimately induce activation and survival of t cells .
figure 2 contributing factors for reciprocal differentiation of th17 versus ptreg cells .
differentiation of th17 and ptreg cells are reciprocally regulated by many contributing factors .
cytokines are the most powerful determinants in the regulation .
other factors including tcr signal , costimulatory signal , metabolism , and microbiota also influence the balance .

introduction and objectives : the objectives were to assess the relationship between perceived smile aesthetics and perceived psychological impact as measured by the psychosocial impact of dental aesthetics questionnaire ( pidaq ) , and their own perception of it using the aesthetic component of the index of orthodontic treatment need ( iotn - ac ) and a visual analog scale ( vas ) ; relate the iotn - ac and vas to the pidaq ; and study the predictive capacity of the scales for psychological impact .
material and methods : a cross - sectional study was conducted in 447 college students in spain and portugal ( average age 20.4 years , 33.1 % men and 66.9 % women ) .
the online self - completed surveys used the recently - validated spanish and portuguese versions of the pidaq to assess the self - reported psychological impact of the students' dental aesthetics and iotn - ac and an ad hoc 100 mm vas for their perception of their dental aesthetics .
results : pidaq was linearly correlated with iotn ac and vas .
pearson 's coefficient was 0.55 for pidaq and iotn - ac ( ci 95 % 0.48 - 0.61 ) and - 0.72 for pidaq and vas ( ci 95 % - 0.66 - - 0.76 ) .
vas and iotn - ac were predictive variables in a linear regression model of the total pidaq score .
the vas diagnosed individuals whose dental aesthetics had a self - perceived psychological impact ( area under the curve 0.827 , ci 95 % 0.787 - 0.868 ) more precisely than the iotn - ac ( area under the curve 0.742 , ci 95 % 0. 696 - 0.788 ) .
conclusions : in adults patients , there is a significant linear relationship between perceived smile aesthetics and self - perceived psychological impact .
key words : visual analog scale , index of orthodontic treatment need , malocclusion , psychological , aesthetics .
introduction the purpose of most occlusal or orthodontic treatment need indices is to assess the anatomical and esthetic aspects of the malocclusion , ignoring the patient 's own perception of it and its effect on his or her quality of life ( 1,2 ) .
the first index to consider the patient 's own esthetic perception was the aesthetic component ( ac ) of the index of orthodontic treatment need ( iotn ) ( 3 ) .
however , its reliability has been questioned by many authors ( 4 - 9 ) .
researchers have used the visual analog scale ( vas ) as it is considered a simpler way to ascertain the patient 's perception of the esthetics of his or her smile and , by some authors , a quicker method with high reproducibility ( 10 - 13 ) .
in recent years increasing interest has been shown in questionnaires which provide more information on the oral health - related quality of life of the patients and their esthetic perception of themselves ( 2,14 - 16 ) .
the psychosocial impact of dental aesthetics questionnaire ( pidaq ) is a powerful tool that provides very valuable information on aspects of oral health - related quality of life ( ohrqol ) ( 17 ) .
this questionnaire is becoming known around the world and versions in portuguese , chinese and spanish have been validated recently ( 18 - 20 ) .
some authors consider that the negative perception of the aesthetic of the smile , could provide a self - perceived psychological impact in adolescents patients ( 21 ) .
but this relationship has not been studied in adults .
the objectives of the present study were : - to assess the self - perceived psychological impact of malocclusion in a sample of university students using the pidaq and their own perception of malocclusion using the iotn - ac and a vas - to relate these two scales ( iotn - ac and vas ) to the psychological impact of dental aesthetics questionnaire ( pidaq ) material and methods 700 students were randomly selected from the database of university of valencia ( spain ) and the university of oporto ( portugal )) .
sampling took place from november 2012 to january 2013 .
the students were sent an e - mail explaining the objectives of the study and giving the link to the web page with the questionnaire .
an informed consent was obtained from the study participants .
the study was approved by the university of valencia faculty of medicine and dentistry ethics committee .
the students were asked to complete the survey alone , without any help .
for a prevalence of 50 % , an accuracy of +/ - 0.05 and a ci 95 % ; would have an estimate of the sample size of 385 .
the expected response rate in previous on - line surveys was 60 % .
out of a total of 700 questionnaires , 447 ( 63.9 %) were accepted .
the main reason for non - acceptance was not having answered all the questions .
a cross sectional study was conducted in a sample of 447 young college students. by subject area , 31.1 % were studying health sciences ( medicine and dentistry ) , 38.1 % social sciences ( business management and administration , law and political science ) and 30.6 % engineering .
the mean age of the sample was 20.4 years ( ci 95 % 20.0 - 20.8 ) , the range was between 18.0 and 30.2 years ( median 20.2 years ). by gender , 33.1 % were men and 66.9 % women .
the surveys were self - completed online by students of the university of valencia ( spain ) ( 50.3 %) and the university of oporto ( portugal ) ( 49.7 %) .
the respondents had to state their age and gender , their degree course subject area ( major ) and whether they had received orthodontic treatment .
those who were wearing orthodontic devices at the time of the study were excluded , but not those who had been treated in the past .
the online questionnaire contained the pidaq , iotn - ac and vas .
it took approximately 8 minutes to complete .
the pidaq ( psychosocial impact of dental aesthetics questionnaire ) , recently validated for use in spanish and portuguese , was employed to assess the self - reported psychological impact of dental aesthetics ( 17 - 20 ) .
the aesthetic component ( ac ) of the index of orthodontic treatment need ( iotn ) was used to assess the perception of dental aesthetics ( 3 ) .
an ad hoc 100 mm visual analog scale ( vas ) was also included .
the iotn ac scale of 10 black and white photographs was shown with the explanation : " these ten photographs show different levels of dental attractiveness .
number 1 is the most attractive and number 10 the least attractive .
where on this scale would you place your teeth ?" the vas was explained as follows : " this is a scale to assess how you perceive your dental aesthetics .
taking the left end as " very bad or least attractive " and the right end as " very good or most attractive " , use the cursor to mark where on the scale you would place how you think your teeth look. " the right end was labeled with a smiley face and the left end with a sad face .
the vas score was obtained by measuring the distance in millimeters between the mark made by the student and the far left of the scale .
the means and confidence intervals of the questionnaire and the two scales were then calculated .
pearson 's correlation coefficients were employed to study the relations between them .
linear regression models were used to assess the predictive capacity of iotn - ac and vas for the self - perceived psychological impact of the malocclusion .
their diagnostic precision was measured by roc curves .
following the validation study , the pidaq score (>= 36 ) of the individuals with orthodontic treatment need was taken as the gold standard ( 20 ) .
to assess the reproducibility of the method , a pilot study was first carried out in 30 individuals who self - completed the questionnaire twice , one month apart .
the results showed high reproducibility in all three , pidaq , iotn - ac and vas ( intra - class correlation coefficients of 0.94 , 0.90 , and 0.96 respectively ) .
the data were analyzed by the spss program ( 19.0 ) .
results the mean pidaq score was 47.1 ( ci 95 % 45.5 - 48.7 ) .
the mean iotn - ac score was 1.88 ( ci 95 % 1.77 - 1.99 ) .
the mean vas score was 72.9 ( ci 95 % 71.1 - 74.8 ) .
the pidaq results showed no differences by gender or nationality but did display differences by subject area .
the engineering and social science students' scores were significantly higher ( p < 0.05 ) than those of the health sciences students ( table 1 ) .
on the iotn - ac scale the men scored more highly than the women ( p < 0.05 ) , there were no differences by nationality but the health sciences students' scores were significantly lower ( table 1 ) .
the vas scores exhibited differences by gender , nationality and subject area ( table 1 ) .
table 1 pidaq , iotn - ac and vas by gender , nationality and subject area .
student 's t - test and anova : * p < 0.05 the results showed linear correlation between pidaq , iotn - ac and vas .
pearson 's correlation coefficient was 0.55 between pidaq and iotn - ac ( ci 95 % 0.48 - 0.61 ) , - 0.72 between pidaq and vas ( ci 95 % - 0.66 - - 0.76 ) and - 0.52 between iotn - ac and vas ( ci 95 % - 0.45 - - 0.59 ) .
both vas and iotn - ac are predictive variables in a linear regression model of the total pidaq score ( table 2 ) .
no influence of gender or age was found .
table 2 predictive models of pidaq from vas and iotn ac. the vas was more precise than the iotn - ac in diagnosing the individuals whose dental esthetics had a self - perceived psychological impact ( respectively area under the curve 0.827 , ci 95 % 0.787 - 0.868 , and area under the curve 0.742 , ci 95 % 0. 696 - 0.788 ) ( fig. 1 ) .
figure 1 roc curve : diagnostic precision of vas and iotn ac for psychological impact of malocclusion .
discussion one of the main disadvantages of studies based on online questionnaires is answer bias , although the reproducibility results of the pilot study were satisfactory .
self - completed questionnaires preserve anonymity and the fact of being online and quickly answered encouraged completion .
even so , 33 % of those who accessed the web page left it without completing the items and were excluded from the study , which made it difficult to obtain a larger sample .
another difficulty in designing the survey in the online format was how to include a vas .
concerning the age of the sample , the decision was taken to conduct the study in young adults ( college students ) because many authors have concluded that it is better to analyze the self - perceived psychosocial impact of dental aesthetics in adults , as they already possess a certain emotional stability and have a more realistic view of dentofacial aesthetics ( 22 - 25 ) .
the aesthetic perception of the smile is not the same than the self - perceived psychological impact it may cause , but our study shows that the two concepts are strongly related in the young adult population .
the results showed high linear correlation between the self - reported psicological impact using pidaq , and the self - perception aesthetics using iotn - ac or vas .
pearson 's correlation coefficient was 0.55 for pidaq and iotn - ac. the coefficient for pidaq and vas was negative ( - 0.72 ) because the vas was measured in the opposite direction to the ac , which gives the lowest score to the most attractive photo .
in linear regression models , both vas and iotn - ac demonstrated their capacity to predict the pidaq score .
however , the vas was able to predict 51 % of the variability in the model and the iotn - ac only 33 % .
on comparing them through roc curves , vas again showed greater diagnostic precision than iotn - ac. we consider that for studying the relationship between aesthetic self - perception of malocclusion and its self - perceived psychological impact , is not necessary the use of objective indices such as dai or iotn dhc .
the psychological impact of malocclusion just depends on patient 's self - perception , and not on the measurements obtained by objective indices .
the purpose of the orthodontic treatment need indices is to assess the occlusal and esthetic aspects of the malocclusion , ignoring the patient 's own perception of it and its effect on his or her quality of life ( 1,2 ) .
moreover many authors have attempted to develop methods or indices to analyze the patients' perceptions of their dentofacial esthetics .
this was the aim of the iotn - ac , which has indeed been widely used ( 26 ) .
however , its reliability has been questioned by many authors ( 4,6 - 9 ) .
the authors of the present study have observed in previous research that patients sometimes hesitate between two very different photographs , showing the difficulty they have in identifying with any of the ten photographs ( 27 ) .
other studies have found that results differ considerably according to whether the patient 's need is measured objectively with the iotn dhc or with the iotn ac ( 9,28 ) .
also , it should not be forgotten that the iotn - ac shows ten frontal photographs but patients do not normally see their teeth in this way .
nevertheless they are asked to use these photographs for comparison .
moreover , there are as many smiles as there are people and it makes no sense to limit the patient 's choice to only ten .
in addition , many aspects that do not appear in the iotn - ac are overlooked ( such as anterior crossbite ) , and increased overjet , despite being of considerable concern to patients , is undervalued , as it is not evident in a frontal photograph ( 29 ) .
for these reasons , it was decided to use the vas ( visual analog scale ) as a complementary method , as it is considered a clear , simple way to assess the patient 's esthetic perception and has been used by several authors ( 10 - 12,30 ) .
some researchers highlight its simplicity and ease of use and the fact that the absence of numbers or images reduces the possibility of bias ( 31 ) .
in summary , in adults patients , there is a significant linear relationship between self - perceived smile aesthetics and self - perceived psychological impact .

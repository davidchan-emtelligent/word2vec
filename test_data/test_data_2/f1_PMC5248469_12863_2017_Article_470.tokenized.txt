background fto gene variants have been associated with obesity phenotypes in sedentary and obese populations , but rarely with skeletal muscle and elite athlete phenotypes .
methods in 1089 participants , comprising 530 elite rugby athletes and 559 non - athletes , dna was collected and genotyped for the fto rs9939609 variant using real - time pcr .
in a subgroup of non - resistance trained individuals ( nt ; n = 120 ) , we also assessed structural and functional skeletal muscle phenotypes using dual energy x - ray absorptiometry , ultrasound and isokinetic dynamometry .
in a subgroup of rugby athletes ( n = 77 ) , we assessed muscle power during a countermovement jump .
results in nt , tt genotype and t allele carriers had greater total body ( 4.8 % and 4.1 %) and total appendicular lean mass ( lm ; 3.0 % and 2.1 %) compared to aa genotype , with greater arm lm ( 0.8 %) in t allele carriers and leg lm ( 2.1 %) for tt , compared to aa genotype .
furthermore , the t allele was more common ( 94 %) in selected elite rugby union athletes ( back three and centre players ) who are most reliant on lm rather than total body mass for success , compared to other rugby athletes ( 82 % ; p = 0.01 , or = 3.34 ) and controls ( 84 % ; p = 0.03 , or = 2.88 ) .
accordingly , these athletes had greater peak power relative to body mass than other rugby athletes ( 14 % ; p = 2 x 10 - 6 ) .
conclusion collectively , these results suggest that the t allele is associated with increased lm and elite athletic success .
this has implications for athletic populations , as well as conditions characterised by low lm such as sarcopenia and cachexia .
keywords rugbygene project irx3 lean mass http :// dx.doi.org / 10.13039 / 100010014manchester metropolitan universityissue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background fat mass and obesity associated ( fto ) is the most investigated gene in obesity and has complex molecular mechanisms that are yet to be elucidated .
recent genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) have identified several common single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snp ) in the human fto gene associated with obesity , body mass index bmi ; [ 1 ] , cardiovascular disease and hypertension [ 2 , 3 ] .
these fto snps , which are in strong linkage disequilibrium ( r 2 > 0.80 ) , are located in a cluster on the first intron of the gene on chromosome 16 and consequently exhibit similar obesity - related traits [ 4 ] .
thus , within different fto variants , those alleles that have been positively associated with obesity - related phenotypes are referred to as risk alleles , while those negatively associated with such traits are referred to as protective alleles .
homozygotes for the minor risk allele consistently demonstrate greater bmi and body mass ( 3 - 10 kg ) in comparison to protective allele carriers [ 5 , 6 ] .
this greater body mass is likely to be adipose tissue [ 7 - 11 ] , although there exist some suggestions of greater lean mass ( lm ) in addition to fat mass [ 9 , 12 ] and independent of fat intake and physical activity [ 9 ] .
this suggests that fto genotype may be related to muscle properties and is supported by evidence from a large uk twin study that related fto snps with body composition while controlling for lean mass and fat mass ( separately and combined ) .
the authors concluded that fto snp associations with body size were a composite of both lean and fat mass , not fat mass alone [ 13 ] .
environmental lifestyle factors ( diet and physical activity ) have also been investigated for fto gene - environment interactions .
risk allele carriers are more likely to choose a high fat diet than protective allele carriers [ 11 , 14 , 15 ] .
however , with administration of a high protein diet ( 25 % energy intake ) risk allele carriers demonstrated a greater reduction in body mass , fat mass and percentage body fat [ 16 ] , due to greater appetite suppression than in protective allele carriers [ 17 ] .
additionally , physically active risk allele carriers have a 30 % reduction in likelihood of becoming obese and have 36 % less body fat compared to inactive risk allele carrying individuals [ 18 ] .
in contrast , data from the heritage family study showed that following 20 weeks of endurance training , protective allele carriers exhibited reductions in fat mass three times greater than risk allele homozygotes [ 19 ] .
interestingly , when comparing normal weight and obese individuals who participate in sport , no differences in fto genotype were observed ( p = 0.97 ) , which was contrasted by those not participating p = 0.02 ; [ 20 ] .
considering the attenuation of fto - associated obesity with environmental factors and the greater fto - associated lm reported in obese populations [ 9 , 12 ] , investigating lm and associated phenotypes in healthy , non - obese , non - resistance trained individuals and habitually trained elite athletes would be worthwhile .
to date , there have been no investigations of in vivo skeletal muscle phenotypes in trained or non - resistance trained populations for associations with fto genotype .
eynon et al .
[ 21 ] investigated fto rs9939609 in three european cohorts of power ( n = 258 ; 58.3 % elite ) and endurance athletes ( n = 266 ; 57.1 % elite ) from a variety of sporting disciplines - but identified no associations .
this lack of association was likely due to the considerable differences in physiological demand between the various athletic disciplines included , plus further variability in the standard of athlete .
we have recently shown the ability of genetic research in a single sport with player roles that differ distinctly , namely rugby union ( ru ) , to reveal context - specific competitive advantages provided by particular alleles [ 22 ] .
therefore , as ru includes athletes of remarkably distinct anthropometric and body composition phenotypes , elite ru provides a unique opportunity to investigate fto in individuals at the extreme upper end of physical fitness [ 23 ] .
therefore , the main aims of the present study were to ( 1 ) investigate any association of fto rs9939609 with body composition and muscle structural and functional parameters in a homogenous , healthy , non - obese non - resistance trained population ( 2 ) investigate whether fto rs9939609 genotype differed between elite rugby athletes and a control population , and / or between ru player positions .
based on prior data in obese populations , it was hypothesised that the rs9939609 risk ( a ) allele would be associated with greater body mass , fat mass , bmi , lm , muscle volume and muscle strength in non - resistance trained individuals .
secondly , for the elite rugby cohort , it was hypothesised that the fto a allele would be overrepresented in player positions typically requiring greater body and muscle mass while the protective ( t ) allele would be more common in positions requiring a lean phenotype .
method participants a total of 1089 individuals were recruited and gave written informed consent to participate in the present study .
the total sample comprised elite caucasian male rugby athletes ( n = 530 ; height 1.85 ( 0.07 ) m , mass 101 ( 14 ) kg , age 29 ( 7 ) yr , bmi 29.4 ( 3.7 ) kg.m - 2 ; mean ( standard deviation ( sd )) including 73 % british , 16 % south african , 7 % irish and 4 % from other nationalities and non - athlete caucasian control participants ( male and female ; n = 559 ; height 1.75 ( 0.10 ) m , mass 75 ( 13 ) kg , age 29 ( 16 ) yr , bmi 24.5 ( 3.6 ) kg.m - 2 ) including 86 % british , 12 % south african , 1 % irish and 1 % from other nationalities .
athletes were considered elite if they had competed regularly (> 5 matches ) since 1995 in the highest professional league in the uk , ireland or south africa for ru or the highest professional league in the uk for rugby league ( rl ). of the ru athletes , 52.7 % had competed at an international level for a " high performance union " ( regulation 16 , worldrugby.org ) and 43.2 % of rl had competed at international level .
all data for the athlete group 's international status were confirmed as of 1st june 2016 .
furthermore , within the rugby cohort , a subsample ( n = 77 ) were examined for performance - related muscle phenotypes .
within the control group were a subgroup of non - resistance trained healthy males ( nt ; table 1 ) .
nt participants were aged 18 - 39 years , had a bmi 18.5 - 30 kg.m - 2 , had not undertaken any structured resistance training in the preceding 12 months and had no history of neurological or musculoskeletal disorders .
additionally , only those participants undertaking less than 3 h of low - to - moderate physical activity per week , assessed via questionnaire [ 24 ] , were included .

the angle of peak torque was taken as the optimal knee joint angle and used to estimate antagonist muscle co - activation during mvc , which assumed a linear relationship between biceps femoris emg activity and knee flexion torque [ 25 ] .
together with antagonist co - activation , quadriceps femoris ( qf ) voluntary activation capacity , determined using the interpolated twitch technique [ 26 ] , allowed for the calculation of net mvcke torque .
subsequently , patella tendon moment arm length ( d pt ) was measured using dual energy x - ray absorptiometry dxa ; [ 27 ] and patella tendon force calculated as net mvcke torque / d pt. the contribution of the vastus lateralis ( vl ) muscle ( mfvl ) to patella tendon force was calculated by estimating the relative physiological cross - sectional area ( pcsa ) of the vl as ~ 21 % of the qf [ 28 ] .
vl muscle architecture ( fascicle length , l f and pennation angle , theta ) was measured at 50 % of vl length during mvcke at the optimal knee joint angle using ultrasound ( au5 , esaote , italy ) and vl fascicle force estimated as mfvl / cosine theta [ 29 ] .
at rest , ultrasound was also used to obtain a series of transverse plane scans at 50 % of vl muscle length from the medial to lateral borders , which were contour matched to determine vl anatomical cross - sectional area [ acsa ; 29 ]. with vl length and vl acsa used to estimate vl volume ( v vl ) as previously [ 30 ] .
subsequently , vl pcsa was calculated as v vl / l f and , vl specific force calculated by dividing vl fascicle force by vl pcsa [ 29 ] .
finally , quantification of whole body and appendicular lm was completed using dxa ( hologic discovery : vertec scientific ltd , uk ) following a 12 h overnight fast .
participants lay in a supine position , avoiding any contact between the trunk and the appendicular mass during a 7 min whole body scanning procedure ( effective dose , 8.4 musv ) .
appendicular lean mass was estimated from the dexa as the total muscle mass of both the upper and lower limbs , where lm is body mass excluding fat and bone mass .
muscle power in ru athletes using a portable force platform ( type 92866aa , kistler , germany ) peak power output ( ppo ) was determined during a bilateral countermovement jump ( cmj ) according to methods described previously [ 31 ] .
body mass and the vertical component of the ground reaction force during the cmj ( sampled at 1000 hz ) were used to determine instantaneous velocity and displacement of the participant 's centre of gravity .
instantaneous power output was determined using the following equation : power ( w ) = vertical grf ( n ) x vertical velocity of centre of gravity ( m . s - 1 ) , with the highest value produced deemed the ppo .
sample collection and genotyping description of all molecular procedures have previously been described in detail [ 22 ] .
briefly , blood (~ 70 % of all samples ) , saliva (~ 25 %) or buccal swab samples (~ 5 %) were obtained via the following protocols .
blood was drawn from a superficial forearm vein into an edta tube and stored in sterile tubes at - 20degreesc until processing .
saliva samples were collected into oragene dna og - 500 collection tubes ( dna genotek inc. , ontario , canada ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol and stored at room temperature until processing .
sterile buccal swabs ( omni swab , whatman , springfield mill , uk ) were rubbed against the buccal mucosa of the cheek for approximately 30 s. tips were ejected into sterile tubes and stored at - 20degreesc until processing .
dna isolation and genotyping were performed in the mmu , university of glasgow , university of cape town ( dna isolation only ) and university of northampton laboratories .
the majority of samples were processed and genotyped in the mmu laboratory , including all samples within nt. at mmu and glasgow , dna isolation was performed using the qiaamp dna blood mini kit and standard spin column protocol , following the manufacturer 's instructions ( qiagen , west sussex , uk ) .
briefly , 200 mul of whole blood / saliva , or one buccal swab , was lysed , incubated , the dna washed and the eluate containing isolated dna stored at 4degreesc .
in cape town , dna was isolated from whole blood using a different protocol [ 32 ] during which samples were lysed , centrifuged , the dna washed and samples stored at - 20degreesc .
genotyping of dna isolated in cape town was performed in glasgow .
at northampton , dna was isolated from whole blood using flexigene kits ( qiagen ) .
briefly , samples were lysed , dna precipitated and washed , with samples stored at - 20degreesc .
genotyping in all three genotyping centres was performed on fto ( rs9939609 ) .
briefly , in the glasgow laboratory 10 mul genotyping master mix ( applied biosystems , paisley , uk ) , 1 mul snp - specific taqman assay ( applied biosystems ) , 6 mul nuclease - free h2o and 3 mul dna solution (~ 9 ng dna ) were added per well .
in the northampton laboratory , genotyping was performed by combining 10 mul of genotyping master mix , 8 mul h2o , 1 mul assay mix with 1 mul of purified dna (~ 10 ng ) .
in both laboratories , pcr was performed using a steponeplus real - time detector ( applied biosystems ) .
briefly , after an initial 10 min at 95degreesc , 40 cycles of denaturation at 92degreesc for 15 s then annealing and extension at 60degreesc for 1 min were used .
genotyping calls were performed using steponeplus software version 2.3 ( applied biosystems ) .
at mmu , 5 mul genotyping master mix , 4.3 mul h2o , 0.5 mul assay mix and 0.2 mul of purified dna (~ 9 ng ) were used in each reaction for samples derived from blood and saliva .
for dna derived from buccal swabs , 5 mul genotyping master mix was combined with 3.5 mul h2o , 0.5 mul assay mix and 1 mul dna solution (~ 9 ng dna ) .
either a chromo4 ( bio - rad , hertfordshire , uk ) or steponeplus real - time pcr system was used .
briefly , after an initial 10 min at 95degreesc , 40 cycles of denaturation at 92degreesc for 15 s then annealing and extension at 60degreesc for 1 min were used .
genotyping calls were performed using opticon monitor software version 3.1 ( bio - rad ) or steponeplus software version 2.3 .
the taqman assay included vic and fam dyes that indicated a and t alleles on the forward dna strand , respectively .
thus , vic / fam were interpreted as : 5 ' - gtgaattt [ a / t ] gtgatgca - 3 ' .
ru positional groups as established previously [ 22 ] , to compare genotype and allele frequencies within the ru group , athletes were allocated to subgroups ; forwards ( props , hookers , locks , flankers , number eights ) and backs ( scrum halves , fly halves , centres , wings , full backs ) .
also , due to diverse physiological demands within ru [ 33 , 34 ] , athletes were further divided into established positional groups according to their movement patterns [ 33 ] ; front five ( props , hookers , locks ) , back row ( flankers , number eights ) , half backs ( scrum halves , fly halves ) , back three ( wings and full backs ) and centres .
for example , in one study the front five travelled ~ 136 m at > 5 m . s - 1 compared to ~ 566 m for the back three [ 35 ] .
comparisons between positions were not performed for the rl cohort due to low statistical power when it was subdivided .
data analysis spss for windows version 22 ( spss inc. , chicago , il ) software was used to conduct statistical analyses .
one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) was used to compare height , mass , bmi , age and ppo between sample populations and genotype groups .
when genotype groups were compared using a recessive model , an independent samples t - test was used .
furthermore , genotype effects on muscle phenotypes of interest were assessed for linear trend .
pearson 's chi2 tests compared genotype and allelic frequencies between athlete and control groups and between ru positional subgroups .
there were 30 comparisons for genotype frequency between groups and 28 tests of genotype differences in phenotype in nt that were subjected to benjamini - hochberg corrections to control false discovery rate and corrected probability values are reported [ 36 ] .
where appropriate , odds ratio ( or ) and eta squared ( etap 2 ) were calculated to estimate effect size .
alpha was set at 0.05 .
results genotype calling was successful in all samples .
there was 100 % agreement among reference samples genotyped in the three genotyping centres , i.e. glasgow , northampton and mmu laboratories .
genotype frequencies were in hardy - weinberg equilibrium for the entire control group ( p = 0.871 ) , nt ( p = 0.988 ) and athlete groups ( rl , p = 0.183 ; ru , p = 0.076 ) .
non - resistance trained ( nt ) the aa genotype group had greater body mass , bmi and age but not height compared to other genotype groups ( table 1 ) .
there were genotype differences for total body ( etap 2 = 0.072 ) , total appendicular ( etap 2 = 0.075 ) and leg ( etap 2 = 0.078 ) lm , with tendencies for arm lm ( p = 0.06 , etap 2 = 0.054 ) and total fat mass ( p = 0.09 , etap 2 = 0.024 ) .
t - allele carriers demonstrated greater total body ( 5.3 %) , appendicular ( 6.7 %) and arm ( 9.8 %) , but not leg ( p = 0.10 ) lm than aa homozygotes .
there were no differences in muscle size , torque or specific force variables ( table 1 ) .
athletes athletes were taller and heavier ( p < 0.05 ) but not older ( p > 0.05 ) than controls .
there were no genotype frequency differences between athletes ( rl and ru combined ; p = 0.16 ) , rl ( p = 0.36 ) , ru ( p = 0.16 ) and controls ( only additive models presented ) .
in terms of player position , backs had a greater frequency of t allele carriers than forwards ( p = 0.03 , table 2 , fig. 1 ) and showed greater odds of being t allele carriers than aa genotype ( or = 1.84 , table 3 ) .
when combined , the back three and centres group contained less aa homozygotes and more t allele carriers ( p = 0.03 , p = 0.02 , respectively ; fig. 1a and table 2 ) than controls .
additionally , controls had more than twice the odds of being aa than the back three and centres group , with greater odds of t allele carriers in the back three and centres than controls ( table 3 ) .
compared to forwards and all other ru athletes , tt genotype ( p = 0.03 ; p = 0.03 , respectively ) and t allele carriers ( p = 0.02 ; p = 0.02 , respectively ) were more common in the back three and centres group ( fig. 1a and table 2 ) .
likewise , forwards and all other ru athletes had greater than three times the odds of being aa genotype than the back three and centres group , with greater odds of t allele carriers in the back three and centres group than forwards and all other ru athletes ( table 3 ) .
furthermore , the back three and centres group showed a greater t allele frequency than both forwards and all other ru athletes ( fig. 1b ) and almost one and a half times greater odds of possessing the t allele ( table 3 ) .

the centre and back 3 players ( 59 w.kg - 1 ) were 9.8 % more powerful than back row ( 54 w.kg - 1 ; p = 0.025 ) and 20.2 % more powerful than front 5 players ( 47 w.kg - 1 ; p = 6 x 10 - 7 ; table 4 ) .

in agreement with our second hypothesis , we report a greater t allele and tt genotype frequency in elite rugby athlete playing positions more reliant on a lean phenotype for success [ 37 ] , while the a allele is more common in those positions where total body mass is more important [ 38 ] ; fig. 1 , tables 2 and 3 .
the ability to rapidly produce high levels of power relative to body mass using the leg musculature was greater in those playing positions more reliant on a lean phenotype ( table 4 ) and is in agreement with previously published data of elite ru players [ 39 ] .
one possible biological mechanism underlying the present results may be the action of the iroquois homeobox 3 ( irx3 ) protein through its fto genomic loci interaction .
until recently , little was known about the molecular basis for fto snp associations with any reported phenotype measure , because there was no association between fto snps and expression of the fto protein [ 40 , 41 ] .
however , fto has recently been found to influence irx3 protein expression , through evolutionarily conserved long - range chromatin looping .
individuals possessing the protective fto genotype / allele ( tt / t ) display lower irx3 expression than aa homozygotes [ 42 ] .
furthermore , in contrast to irx3 knockout ( ko ) mice , wild type mice exhibited similar fto snp risk ( a ) allele - associated phenotypes , such as greater bmi , body mass and body fat percentage [ 42 ] .
interestingly , irx3 ko mice expended more energy , particularly at night , due to a greater browning of white fatty tissue [ 42 ] and recent findings show a link between brown fat and muscle developmental precursor myf5 [ 43 ] which may provide a mechanism for the observation of greater lm in fto t allele carriers in our nt cohort .
moreover , using a transgenic mouse model ( rosa26enr - irx3 ) that disrupts irx3 function whilst maintaining the genomic interaction between irx3 and fto ( mimicking more accurately the human in vivo state than the aforementioned ko model ) , the authors showed retention of the ko model phenotype traits [ 42 ] .
these fto - irx3 protein interactions suggest an explanation for the greater lm seen with the t allele carriers of the present study and possibly the association of the t allele with muscle power relative to body mass and its relationship with playing position in ru athletes ( tables 1 , 2 , and 4 ; fig. 1 ) .
the precise mechanisms of action of irx3 in mammalian physiology are not fully understood , however the primary role of irx3 in embryonic development and future actions in motor neuron restriction is relevant to this discussion .
during neuronal development , irx3 expression plays a key role in n - tubulin development and initiation of neuronal programming .
high levels of irx3 protein promote early tissue development resulting in a lack of cell differentiation [ 44 ] .
thus , it is possible that because the fto t allele is associated with lower irx3 expression , greater early motor neuron differentiation might subsequently lead to greater lm - as we observed ( table 1 ) .
as such , for predeterminant neuronal cells to differentiate into a progenitor motor neuron domain and subsequently motor neurons , it appears irx3 must be repressed by the microrna mir - 17 - 3p in order for olig2 to regulate the development of ventral spinal motor neurons [ 45 ] .
thus , as the expression of olig2 increases , the yield of motor neurons increases in tandem [ 46 ] .
considering fto t allele carriers have a lower embryonic expression of irx3 , t allele carriers may have a predisposition for greater lm through enhanced life - long motor neuron availability via olig2 expression and therefore , may be at an advantage for certain forms of athletic ability and associated performance phenotypes ( tables 2 , 3 and 4 ; fig. 1 ) .
this rationale and the present results may represent a small portion of the 85 % heritability of adult muscle neuronal function [ 47 ] .
recent associations between fto variants and igf - 1 , specifically that serum igf - 1 levels were greater in t allele carriers [ 48 ] , may provide a second mechanism to explain the observed genotype differences in lm ( table 1 ) .
it is well known that igf - 1 is upregulated as a consequence of mechanical load / exercise and plays an important role in the cellular development of muscle hypertrophy [ 49 ] .
hence , t allele carriers , who in the nt group had significantly greater lm , may experience upregulation of igf - 1 compared to aa genotype counterparts .
furthermore , serum igf - 1 levels have been positively associated with quadriceps torque [ 50 ] and explosive muscle power [ 51 ] in older men .
these data provide a further potential basis for our observation that ru athletes who require greater muscle power relative to body mass ( table 4 ) show a greater frequency of the t allele than other playing positions ( table 2 and 3 ; fig. 1 ) .
we observed a lower frequency of the aa genotype in back three and centre playing positions ( or = 2.53 ; table 3 ) , although there was no difference between the entire rugby cohort and controls. that latter observation is similar to that we reported previously regarding another genetic variant ( actn3 rs1815739 ) where there was no difference between the entire rugby cohort and controls despite differences in genotype frequency according to playing position [ 22 ] .
this again demonstrates the importance of defining athletes very carefully when conducting such comparisons .
global positioning system ( gps ) data provide evidence for the relevance of our finding regarding fto genotype in elite athletes .
jones et al .
[ 35 ] showed that - at an elite competitive level - the back three and centre players express the greatest ' instantaneous and accumulative demands for exercise ' ( exertion index ; ei ) than all other athletes and spent more time at sprinting intensities .
thus , there is congruence between our dual observations of firstly greater lm in nt associated with the t allele , and secondly a greater frequency of the t allele in certain elite rugby athletes who rely on greater power outputs relative to body mass to be successful in those specific playing positions table 3 ; [ 39 ] .
these data suggest the relevance of the fto rs9939609 t allele to muscle - related phenotypes and subsequently , athletic success .
when considering the possible molecular mechanism from fto via irx3 to olig2 resulting in greater lifelong motor neuron availability , this may have implications for muscle size - related disorders such as sarcopenia and cachexia .
conclusions the presented data show a novel dimension of fto genetic variation in human physiology , by investigating in vivo muscle phenotypes in a healthy non - resistance trained population and relating those data to the extreme upper end of human physical performance - i.e. elite athletes .
we show that the fto rs9939609 protective t allele may be responsible for part of the inherited component of the inter - individual variability in lm. furthermore , elite athletes who rely greatly on lm relative to total body mass for athletic success ( ru back three and centre players , in this study ) also seem more likely to carry a protective t allele , have higher peak muscle power output relative to body mass and are likely to selected for appropriate playing positions as a result of these and other phenotypes .
it is possible that this association between the fto rs9939609 snp , via lm , and athletic success , could be a result of the interaction with irx3 in embryonic development of motor neuron patterning and the igf - 1 muscle development pathway .
the strengths of the presented paper are the two - layered study design ( nt and elite athlete cohorts ) and the combination of muscle functional phenotypes with case - control data .
while the finding that fto genotype differs among elite rugby playing positions is a new insight , fto is only one of many variants ( most others unknown ) that contribute to this phenotype and as such should not be used for talent identification at this time .
replication is necessary for each cohort using comparable methods , and future experimental focus should be on the proposed biological pathways of these fto associations with muscle phenotypes .

in support of these trials , we have developed and conducted precision testing of a 12 - color flow cytometric assay to characterize the surface markers present on t cells in fresh whole blood and among cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) .
methods a combination of 12 antibodies specific for the following t cell surface markers was evaluated using a becton dickinson ( bd ) lsrii flow cytometer : anti - cd45 , anti - cd3 , anti - cd4 , anti - cd8 , anti - cd45ra , anti - cd197 ( ccr7 ) , anti - cd28 , anti - cd25 , anti - cd127 ( il - 7 receptor ) , anti - hla - dr , anti - cd279 ( pd - 1 ) , and anti - cd278 ( icos ) .
whole blood samples were incubated with a cocktail of antibodies , treated with bd pharm lyse , fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde , and frozen in 10 % dmso at - 80degreesc .
pbmc samples were treated similarly except that they were fixed with 1 % paraformaldehyde and kept at 4degreesc .
samples were run on a flow cytometer within 2 days and analyzed using flowjo software .
whole blood samples were thawed prior to running on the flow cytometer .
percentages of t cell subsets were assessed for within - assay and inter - operator variation from the whole blood of 3 healthy volunteers , while within - assay and inter - assay variation ( across multiple days ) was assessed using pbmc from 1 healthy volunteer .
results for stable markers that define t cell memory subsets , including cd4 , cd8 , cd45ra , cd197 , and cd28 , the within - assay coefficient of variation (% cv ) in whole blood ranged from 0 - 7.2 % for the 3 different donors , among 3 unique operators ( mean range of marker expression : 20.4 - 99.9 %) .
the inter - operator cv for these markers ranged from 0.1 - 5.7 % in whole blood for the 3 different donors and among 3 operators .
as expected , measures of t cell activation such as cd25 , hla - dr , pd - 1 and icos were expressed at substantially lower levels in these samples from healthy volunteers ( mean range of expression : 0.3 - 33.8 %) , and the % cvs were correspondingly higher ( 0.6 % - 100.8 %) .
among cryopreserved pbmc , within - assay cvs for t cell memory subset markers ranged from 0 - 18.6 % , while inter - assay variation measured over 3 assay days ranged from 0.3 - 13.7 % .
conclusions we have designed a flow cytometric staining panel that permits the identification of memory t cell subsets as well as activated t cells in whole blood .
the assay precision for memory t cell surface markers was excellent at < 7.3 % , which will allow the identification of modest changes in the percentage of memory populations over time .
proportionally larger differences will be required to precisely ascertain changes in the percentages of activated t cells .

increasing urbanization and industrialization lead to the release of metals into the biosphere , which has become a serious issue for public health .
in this paper , the direct electrochemical reduction of zinc ions is studied using electrochemically reduced graphene oxide ( ergo ) modified glassy carbon electrode ( gce ) .
the graphene oxide ( go ) was fabricated using modified hummers method and was electrochemically reduced on the surface of gce by performing cyclic voltammograms from 0 to - 1.5 v. the modification was optimized and properties of electrodes were determined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( eis ) and cyclic voltammetry ( cv ) .
the determination of zn ( ii ) was performed using differential pulse voltammetry technique , platinum wire as a counter electrode , and ag / agcl / 3 m kcl reference electrode .
compared to the bare gce the modified gce / ergo shows three times better electrocatalytic activity towards zinc ions , with an increase of reduction current along with a negative shift of reduction potential .
using gce / ergo detection limit 5 ng.ml - 1 was obtained .

introduction heavy metal pollution has become a major concern all over the world .
anthropogenic processes like urbanization and industrialization have led to their release from earth 's crust and their accumulation in the biosphere .
the long - term monitoring of heavy metal pollution is the only way to meet the legislative demands and decrease pressure on the environment .
however , most heavy metals like lead or cadmium are toxic even at low concentrations , others , which belong to a group of essential micronutrients , pose health risks in high supplementation only , but their monitoring is also needed [ 1,2,3 ] .
among essential micronutrients , zinc ( ii ) plays one of the most important role .
zinc analysis is appealing not only from the environmental point of view but also from the biochemical one .
zinc ( ii ) ions play an important role in cell replication and nucleic acid metabolism , and its deficiency is connected with some pathological processes like retarded growth and immunity dysfunction [ 4 ] .
as was shown recently , the enhanced zinc intake by drinking water in the case of mice caused zinc deficiency in the hippocampus , associated with memory deficit and decreased expression levels of learning and memory related receptors [ 5 ] .
zinc has these important roles and effects mainly as a co - factor of numerous proteins , therefore it is not surprising that metallomics and proteomics of zinc - containing proteins are emerging fields of science [ 6,7,8 ]. from these , metallothioneins are highlighted as maintainers and transporters of these proteins and their importance in zinc metabolism belongs to the interest of numerous researchers [ 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 ] .
atomic absorption spectrometry ( aas ) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( icp - ms ) represent a gold standard in detection of trace heavy metals concentrations .
nevertheless , they require expensive instrumentation , experienced operators , and the analyses are time - consuming .
on the contrary , electrochemistry offers superior features like portability , easy use , low price , miniaturization , and high sensitivity [ 19,20,21,22,23 ] .
the great advantage of electroanalysis is also the possibility of electrode surface modification [ 24 ] .
mercury electrodes have been widely used in trace heavy metal analysis for decades ; however , they do not correspond with current trends including miniaturization .
whereas material sciences are a rapidly developing field of science , several micro to nanosized materials like liquid metals / metal oxides in order to improve electrode properties are attracting the attention of analysts [ 25,26,27,28 ] .
graphene , theoretically perfect two - dimensional ( one - atom - thick ) material , is the ideal choice for electrochemistry since it possesses unusual electronic conductivity and high surface area [ 29 ] .
however , it is worth noting that a one - atom - thick , defect - less graphene monolayer is difficult to prepare and standard graphene materials are far from perfectly structured , and therefore more often reduced graphene oxide ( rgo ) is used .
the procedure of go reduction influences subsequent rgo properties .
electrodes modified with rgo obtained using constant potential chemical and thermal reduction was previously compared [ 30 ]. from electrochemical methods for go reduction cyclic voltammetry was also used [ 31 ] .
electrodes modified with rgo are not only desirable for just electroanalytical chemistry , but also for the removal of organic pollutants from wastewaters [ 32 ] .
various methods have been used to prepare electrodes modified with go [ 33,34,35,36 ] .
among others , electrodeposition of go or rgo attracted interest due to its efficiency , ease of use , and rapid procedure [ 37 ] .
potentiostatic methods and cyclic voltammetry ( cv ) were shown to be suitable tool for electrodeposition of these materials on electrodes [ 38,39 ] .
recently , pulse potential method based on changing of anodic deposition and cathodic reduction periods was developed too [ 40 ] .
moreover , an electrode surface modification with biomolecules or graphene - like nanomaterials can significantly improve detection sensitivity and selectivity [ 41,42,43 ] .
in this work the go film on glassy carbon electrode ( gce ) was fabricated by the potentiostatic deposition of go. electrochemically deposited go was subsequently subjected to electrochemical reduction to produce electrochemically reduced graphene oxide ( ergo ) using cv. the properties of this modified electrode were compared with standard bare gce using cv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( eis ) .
[ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 3 - /[ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - was used as a redox probe for electrode characterization and the performance of gce / ergo on detection of zn ( ii ) using differential pulse voltammetry ( dpv ) was examined .
2. results and discussion 2.1 .
preparation of gce / ergo since the discovery of graphene , it has been attracting great attention due to its high conductivity and surface to volume ratio [ 44 ] .
however , from an electrochemical point of view graphene suffers from a limited number of hydrophilic moieties and electroactive sites [ 45 ] .
go with randomly distributed oxygen groups benefits from structural similarity with graphene , nevertheless structure breaks cause the decrease of conductivity [ 46 ] .
partially reduced go represents an intermediate between ideal graphene structure and go , whereas the amount of electroactive surface and reactive functionalities ( epoxy , hydroxyl , carboxyl ) are balanced .
the common method to fabricate rgo is exfoliation of graphite to produce go followed by thermal or chemical reduction [ 47 ] .
ergo represents an alternative since no expensive equipment or use of toxic compounds is needed during its fabrication .
several procedures have been introduced to cover electrodes with a go or go / ergo layer [ 34,38,48,49 ] .
direct electrodeposition from solution or drop - casting of go or rgo on the surface of electrode can be used .
if go is used as a source material for electrode modification , deposition is followed by electrochemical reduction of go to prepare ergo .
previously , cv , potentiostatic or pulsed methods ( several cycles of deposition in positive potential followed by go reduction in negative potential ) were used in order to cover the electrode with ergo [ 50,51 ] .
here , go was prepared according to the simplified hummer 's method ( figure 1a ) .
it was revealed that our go sample contains particles with hydrodynamic diameter of 848 +/ - 290 nm ( figure 1b ) .
negative charge of go was confirmed using measurement of zetapotential ( zeta = - 43 mv ) , which enables to deposit go particles on the electrode using application of positive potential on it. this value also suggests that go particles possess good stability in colloid phase .
figure 1 ( a ) micrograph of go used to modify gce obtained by sem ; ( b ) go size distribution including zetapotential ; ( c ) raman spectra of gce , gce modified with go and gce modified with ergo ; ( d ) afm image of go and ( e ) the height profiles along lines displayed in afm image .
for the fabrication of gce / ergo , the constant potential + 1.0 v vs. ag / agcl / 3 m kcl reference electrode were applied to gce in a previously sonicated water solution of go ( 0.5 mg.ml - 1 ) .
due to the presence of oxygen - containing functionalities negatively charged go is electrostatically attracted to positively charge electrode .
subsequently , the working electrode was gently rinsed with water , transferred to acetate buffer and five cv cycles ( from 0 to - 1.50 v ) were performed [ 52 ] .
the irreversible reduction signals at - 1.05 v and - 0.85 v were observed in first cycle and completely disappeared in subsequent cycles ( figure 2a ) .
it was shown previously that reduction of go provides peak around - 1.10 v [ 8,45,51 ] .
nevertheless different oxygen - containing moieties can be presented within go , which can result in different reduction signals .
the deposition ( 0 - 480 s ) time of go on electrode was optimized using detection of 20 micromol.l - 1 zn ( ii ) signal and the deposition for 60 s was found as an optimal ( figure 2b ) .
it was shown that although deposition of go increased reduction signal of zinc slightly for 15 s , deposition of go increased signal nearly three - fold for 30 s when compared with bare gce cathodized for precise time in water .
the deposition time 60 s was able to sufficiently modify the surface of gce with go , and the increase of deposition time did not result in the increase of detection signal .

further , we analyzed the surface of the modified electrode by raman spectroscopy .
the d and g raman bands were detected at 1355 cm - 1 and 1595 cm - 1 for go and 1348 cm - 1 and 1600 cm - 1 for ergo , both deposited on gce .
the raman intensity ratio of the d and g bands ( id / ig ) is increased in the case of gce / ergo ( 1.19 ) compared to gce / go ( 0.98 ) ( figure 1c ) , which is in accordance with literature [ 53,54 ] .
it is attributed to the modification of the go structure by reduction resulting in removal of functional groups and creation of defects between the sp2 domains [ 55 ] .
change of full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) was observed from 115 cm - 1 for go towards 78 cm - 1 in the case of ergo for d band .
the value for ergo points at high disorder with low distances between defects [ 55 ] .
the image of go obtained using afm suggests that go is presented within sample in sheet - like shapes ( figure 1d ) .
the thickness of go , deduced from the height profile of afm image , is about 1 nm , which is comparable to go monolayer thickness published previously [ 56,57 ] .
2.2 .
characterization of gce / ergo in order to characterize gce / ergo , cyclic voltammograms of equimolar 2 mmol.l - 1 [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 3 - /[ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - as a redox probe was measured using bare gce and gce / go and compared with the record measured using gce / ergo .
as it is shown in figure 2c , deposition of go on gce reduces the peak current by 5 % .
on the contrary , gce / ergo exhibited better detection properties by 10 % ( inset in figure 2c ) .
based on these data , the randles - sevcik equation ( equation ( 1 )) was used to calculate the electroactive surface area of bare gce and subsequently compare it with gce / ergo .
the areas of 6.4 mm2 and 7.0 mm2 were acquired , respectively , which means increase for about 9.4 % and confirm successful deposition and reduction of go. the values of reduction and oxidation peaks of [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 3 - /[ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - were plotted against the square root of scan rates ( figure 2d ) .
the linear dependence revealed diffusion controlled processes for both gce and gce / ergo and slightly improved sensitivity of detection in case of gce / ergo .
these results were also confirmed by eis ( figure 2e ) .
the randles circuit was used as an equivalent circuit for fitting the eis data .
it consisted of solution resistance rs , charge transfer resistance rct , double layer capacitance cdl and warburg impedance zw ( inset in figure 2e ) .
nyquist diagram showed in case of bare gce depressed semicircle with charge transfer resistance 2.1 komega.cm - 1 .
after deposition of go on gce , charge transfer resistance increased four - fold to 8.5 komega.cm - 1 .
very small depressed semicircle was observed in the case of gce / ergo , where rct decreased to 0.6 komega.cm - 1 ( 32 % of gce rct ) .
significantly lower charge transfer resistance of gce / ergo in comparison with gce / go was previously reported [ 58 ] .
in bode diagram the frequency dependence on absolute magnitudes of impedance modulus | z | was plotted ( figure 2f ) .
the peaks of bode phase diagram in case of gce and gce / go ( 1 - 3 khz ) suggests that charge transfer resistance takes place in the electrode / electrolyte interface .
phase peak of bode plot of gce / ergo disappeared at higher frequencies as a result of high electron transfer , where charge transfer resistance decreased ( figure 2g ) .
2.3 .
detection of zn ( ii ) the detection of zn ( ii ) was performed using dpv .
firstly , deposition potentials (( - 1.45 ) - ( - 0.65 ) v ) of zn ( ii ) on the surface of gce / ergo was optimized .
as it can be seen in figure 3a , the obtained zn ( ii ) signal increased from potential - 0.65 to - 1.25 v. at potential - 1.25 v the zn ( ii ) signal reached its higher value and was choose as an optimal .
as the next step , deposition time ( 0 - 90 s ) of zn ( ii ) was optimized ( figure 3b ) .
it was revealed that the signal increased by 73 % using deposition time 60 s and deposition potential - 1.25 v in comparison with deposition time 0 s. after this optimization , different concentrations of zn ( ii ) were measured using gce / ergo and calibration curve was determined ( figure 3c ) .
it exhibited linear section between 1.0 micromol.l - 1 and 62.5 micromol.l - 1 and other analytical parameters of detection are displayed in table 1 .
the modification of gce with ergo improved the detection of zinc ions ( 35 micromol.l - 1 ) four - fold in comparison with bare gce and slightly shifted peak potential from - 1.18 v to - 1.2 v ( figure 3d ) .
using gce / ergo , we obtained limit of detection ( lod ) 0.1 micromol.l - 1 zn ( ii ) (~ 5 ng.ml - 1 ) .

comparison of 10 micromol.l - 1 zn ( ii ) electrochemical signal in acetate buffer with added 50 micromol.l - 1 k ( i ) , ca ( ii ) and mg ( ii ) in inset .
as the final step , the effect of interference with zn ( ii ) detections was examined .
we chose cd ( ii ) since it is quite often presented in environmental samples and may affect zn ( ii ) detection [ 41,59 ] .
zn ( ii ) solutions ( 1 micromol.l - 1 ) with different concentrations of cd ( ii ) ( 0 - 64 micromol.l - 1 ) were measured and the peak heights of zn ( ii ) ( potential - 1.15 v ) were compared ( figure 3e ) .
as it can be seen , peak of cd ( ii ) ( about potential - 0.80 v ) is well separated from zn ( ii ) peak and did not significantly affect zn ( ii ) peak heights even at a 64 - times higher concentration ( figure 3f ) .
in addition , other monovalent and bivalent ions were tested as a possible interference in real sample .
to zn ( ii ) solution five - times higher concentrations of k ( i ) , ca ( ii ) , and mg ( ii ) ions were added and their effects on zn ( ii ) were evaluated .
all zn ( ii ) analysis presented here were performed in the acetate buffer where na ( i ) ions were present in high concentration .
other tested ions showed no apparent interference in zn ( ii ) detection ( figure 3f inset ) .

3.2 .
preparation of go go was synthesized using chemical oxidation of graphite flakes ( 5.0 g , sigma - aldrich , and 100 mesh , >= 75 % min ) in a mixture of concentrated h2so4 ( 670 ml , acs reagent 95.0 % - 98.0 %) and 30.0 g kmno4 (> 99 %) according to the simplified hummer 's method [ 60 ] .
the reaction mixture was stirred vigorously .
after four days , the oxidation of graphite was terminated by slow adding of h2o2 solution ( 250 ml , 30 wt % in h2o ) and the colour of the mixture turned to bright yellow , indicating high oxidation level of graphite .
formed graphite oxide was washed three times with 1 m of hcl and washed with water several times ( total volume used 12 l ) until constant ph value ( 4 - 5 ) was achieved using a simple decantation .
then , it was possible to centrifuge this solution .
during the washing process with deionized water , exfoliation of graphite oxide led to the thickening of solution and formation of a stable colloid of go .
3.3 .
glassy carbon electrode modification with graphene gce was mechanically polished by the 1.0 microm and 0.3 microm alumina suspension ( ch instruments , austin , tx , usa ) on polishing cloth to produce mirror - like surface .
then , the electrode was sonicated for 3 min in distilled water ( 25 degreesc ) and acetone successively in the sonorex digital 10 p ultrasonic bath ( bandelin , berlin , germany ) .
as prepared , the electrode was rinsed with water solution of go ( 0.5 mg.ml - 1 ) and potential + 1.0 v was applied on working electrode vs. ag / agcl / 3 m kcl .

the value of formal potential of [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 3 - in 0.1 mol.l - 1 kcl was 0.25 v and we also adopted it at impedance measurements .
impedance spectra were measured from 0.1 hz to 105 hz with alternating current ( ac ) amplitude of 10 mv .
pgstat302n ( metrohm , herisau , switzerland ) was used for impedance measurements with the same three electrode system as mentioned previously .
individual elements of equivalent circuit were calculated using nova 1.8 ( metrohm , herisau , switzerland ) .
3.5 .
the electroactive surface determination in order to determine electroactive area of gce and to compare it with gce / ergo , cyclic voltammograms of 2 mm [ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 3 - /[ fe ( cn ) 6 ] 4 - in 0.1 m kcl were recorded using the aforementioned electrodes .

4. conclusions modifications of electrode surface , where redox processes in electrochemical measurements take place , are promising techniques to improve detection sensitivity .
nanomaterials and different carbon materials among others are nowadays frequently used to meet this goal .
as it was evident from our measurements , graphene modification of working electrodes is an easy way to enhance electrode properties .
go was electrodeposited from solution on gce at constant positive potential and subsequently electrochemically reduced using cyclic voltammetry measurement at negative potentials .
proved by raman and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy , successful modification of the electrode resulted in an increase of electroactive surface area by 9.4 % compared with bare gce .
we found that gce / ergo possesses three - fold higher sensitivity for zinc ions in comparison with bare gce .
acceptable selectivity towards interfering ions , such as k ( i ) , cd ( ii ) , mg ( ii ) , and ca ( ii ) was achieved .

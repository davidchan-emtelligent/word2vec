introduction there is a clear relationship between the way of life and the health of individuals , and therefore , we can speak of healthy and unhealthy lifestyles .
there are different surveys and questionnaires that evaluate the lifestyles of adolescents , but none of them offers a final score that can quantify the healthfulness of an adolescent 's lifestyle .
it was with this goal that the visa - teen questionnaire is developed and validated .
the objective of this study is to apply the questionnaire to a sample of adolescents who attend school in catalonia to evaluate the healthfulness of their lifestyles and to relate the scores obtained to different sociodemographic variables .
methods cross - sectional study .
a total of 2,832 students from 25 schools in catalonia responded to the questionnaire .
a descriptive analysis was performed , calculating the mean ( standard deviation ) , median ( p25 , p75 ) , and confidence interval .
the results were calculated for the total population , factoring according to gender , age , urban / rural population , origin ( native / immigrant ) , and family wealth , which was based on the family affluence scale ( fas ii ) .
the significance of the difference was calculated for each factor with the appropriate statistical test .
results for the total score of healthy lifestyle , the youngest students and those with the highest family wealth obtained higher scores. with respect to eating habits , girls scored higher than boys , and higher scores were observed in natives and those with high family wealth .
for physical activity , boys scored higher , as well as younger individuals , natives , and those from rural areas. with respect to substance abuse , the worst scores were found in older individuals , students from rural areas , and natives .
the rational use of leisure technology was only associated with age ( worsening scores with older age ) .
lastly , hygiene was better with girls , decreased with age , and was worse with natives than immigrants .

introduction there is a clear relationship between the way of life and the health of individuals , and therefore , we can speak of healthy and unhealthy lifestyles .
the world health organization ( who ) defines lifestyle as the way of living based on identifiable patterns or behaviors that are determined by the interaction between individual and personal characteristics , social relationships , and socioeconomic and environmental factors .
[ 1 ]. with respect to adolescents , the who , in its health behaviour in school - aged children ( hbsc ) survey , considers behaviors related to diet , physical activity , rest , addictions , injuries , hygiene , and sexuality for the lifestyle analysis [ 2 ] .
there is evidence with respect to how and how much the behaviors evaluated in the hbsc , i.e. , diet [ 3 - 11 ] , physical activity [ 12 - 18 ] , rest [ 19 - 26 ] , addictions [ 27 - 39 ] , personal hygiene [ 40 - 43 ] , and screen - time [ 44 ] influence the health of adolescents .
there are different surveys and questionnaires that evaluate the lifestyles of adolescents that are periodically used at the national or supranational level to monitor the habits of this population , and thus , plan health prevention and promotion policies .
the who promotes the hbsc , a questionnaire that gathers data from 43 countries relative to different areas including , amongst others , nutrition and diet , substance abuse , and sedentary activities in adolescents [ 45 ] .
the fresc survey [ 46 ] monitors the tendencies of the main risk factors of adolescents in barcelona and compiles information on the same areas that the hbsc does .
other population studies focus their attention on concrete areas related to lifestyle .
the european school survey project on alcohol and other drugs ( espad ) gathers information every 5 years regarding tobacco and drug use in adolescents from the 26 countries of the european union [ 47 ] .
the healthy lifestyle in europe by nutrition in adolescence ( helena ) exploits data gathered with respect to nutrition and physical activity in adolescents from 10 european countries [ 10 , 11 , 23 , 48 , 49 ] .
the national survey of child and adolescent nutrition ( in spanish " encuesta nacional de alimentacion en la poblacion infantil y adolescente : enalia ") evaluates the nutrition of children and adolescents in spain [ 50 ] .
however , these surveys are limited to making percentage - wise evaluations of the responses of each one of the proposed items , and none of them offers a total score that allows for the quantification of the lifestyle healthfulness of adolescents .
for this reason , the visa - teen is developed and validated to evaluate the healthfulness of the lifestyles of adolescents [ 51 ] .
the questionnaire offers a total score for lifestyle healthfulness and scores on the following 5 components : diet , physical activity , substance abuse , rational use of leisure technology ( rult ) , and hygiene .
the total score ranges from 0 to 45 points ( from least healthy to most healthy ) , and the scores of the different components range from 0 to 3 points ( least healthy to most healthy ) .
the questionnaire offers an acceptable reliability for population studies ( alpha = 0.66 ; alphaest = 0.77 ) and a very good test - retest correlation ( cci = 0.860 ) .
the objective of this study is to apply the questionnaire to a sample of adolescents who attend school in catalonia to evaluate the healthfulness of their lifestyles and to correlate the scores obtained with the following socio - demographic variables : age , gender , origin ( native or immigrant ) , family wealth , and urban / rural residence .
methods sample the units of analysis were secondary education schools / institutes and vocational training colleges of catalonia .
the 1170 schools that provide these courses were used to define the sample size .
table 1 shows the number of recruited schools stratified by province and ownership .
this sample size allowed us to estimate the total score with a precision of +/ - 2 points and with a 95 % confidence interval .
to ensure the feasibility of the study and the number of schools in each stratum , nonprobability convenience sampling was conducted .
recruiting was performed based on contacts facilitated by the department of education of the catalan government and the education delegations of the different religious congregations ( salesianum , jesuit , and gabrielistes ) .
the directors of the centers who agreed to participate signed the corresponding informed consent form and decided , based on internal organizational criteria , what class groups would be surveyed .

it was stressed that the questionnaire was anonymous and voluntary .
lastly , a total of 2,832 students completed the questionnaire .
each school was offered the option of receiving its own results in addition to the global study results .
data analyses the data gathered were entered into the spss 20.0 ( ibm , chicago , illinois , u.s. ) for subsequent analysis .
the total and factorial scores , cronbach 's alpha , and stratified alpha ( which indicates when the scales have more than one dimension ) [ 52 - 54 ] were calculated to confirm reliability .
the factorial scores ( of each component ) were calculated with the average of the scores from each item that composed them .
a descriptive analysis was conducted to calculate the mean ( standard deviation ) , median ( p25 , p75 ) , and their corresponding confidence interval .
the results were calculated for the total population , factoring according to gender , age , urban / rural location , origin ( native / immigrant ) , and family wealth , which was based on the family affluence scale ( fas ii ) .
the significance of the difference was verified for each factor using the appropriate statistical test , i.e. , t - test or analysis of variance ( anova ) , according to the number of categories of the factor .
the association between the scores and age was evaluated with pearson 's r linear correlation coefficient .
the magnitude of the effect was calculated with cohen 's d in all cases in which significant differences were detected to measure those differences .
to interpret the magnitude of the effect , the values proposed by cohen [ 55 ] and expanded by rosenthal [ 56 ] were considered : values between 0.2 and 0.5 imply a small value , between 0.5 and 0.8 indicate a moderate value , between 0.8 and 1.3 indicate a large value , and values greater than 1.3 indicate a very large value .
the significance level was 0.05 .
ethics ethics approval was obtained from the research ethics committee ( faculty of psychology , education and sport sciences , university ramon llull ) .
the study was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the declaration of helsinki .
this study was a self - administrated questionnaire , and at the end , the decision to answer it was from the own students .
the school accepted to participate in the project , and the head of the institution signed the consent .
the questionnaire was anonymous , and we guaranteed that the data and the results were going to be totally confidential , and they would only be used globally ( the sample of all the schools ) , not to evaluate particularly each student .
the confidentiality was also maintained during data analysis by delinking questionnaire data from any personal identification information .
for those over 16 , it was not required an informed consent , as it was considered that if students answered the questionnaire , implied an informed acceptance to participate in the study .
for those under 16 , the researchers did not require parental consent and the principal 's blessing and signature were regarded as sufficient , given that catalonia school boards and principals should inform parents and collect their consent regarding any extracurricular activity .
the research ethics committee also confirmed that the head 's signature covered the permission to analyse the data of each class group .
the research ethics committee approved specifically the informed consent procedure for all participants in our study .
results of the 2,832 students , 1,717 ( 60.6 %) were students in secondary education , 882 ( 31.1 %) were bachelor 's students , and 233 ( 8.3 %) were vocational students .

highlighted are the factors that showed significant differences , and the magnitude of the effect and the direction of the observed difference ( indicating which category had the highest score or , rather , indicating the tendency ) are shown inside each box .
discussion analysis of the total visa - teen scores the goal of the study is to place the adolescents in a continuum , and therefore , no cutoff points are provided .
however , some general considerations may be made with respect to the scores , understanding that scores on the visa - teen lower than 22.5 imply a lifestyle that negatively affects the health of the adolescent ( the score ranges from 0 to 45 points ) .
scores higher than 30 ( 2 points on average for each of the 15 items ) may be considered a lifestyle that positively favors health , although interpretations should be made carefully because the case could arise that certain items have high scores while others have low scores .
the majority of adolescents scored between 35 and 40 points , and only a few scored lower than 22.5 .
if we factor according to the socio - demographic variables , there are significant differences with respect to age and family wealth. with respect to age , there is a drop of almost 8 points between 13 and 19 years of age , with a very large magnitude of the effect ( d = 1.49 ). with respect to family wealth , adolescents at the high levels had scores 2.3 points higher than those at the low levels , with a small magnitude of the effect ( d = 0.40 ) .
these results are comparable with those obtained by ramos [ 57 ] , who correlates the global health of spanish adolescents with their lifestyle .
ramos concludes that there are significant differences in global health with respect to age and family wealth. with regards to age , that author observes that the magnitude of the effect between 12 and 18 years of age is 1.09 , a value lower than that obtained by the visa - teen but that may be considered high [ 55,56 ]. with respect to family wealth as evaluated based on the fas ii , he obtains a magnitude of the effect of 0.40 , exactly the same as what was obtained by the visa - teen .
thus , we may conclude that age and family wealth are associated with the healthy lifestyles of adolescents , but the age effect is greater .
score analysis of the different visa - teen components the range of the scores on each component is between 0 and 3 points , where 0 is an unhealthy lifestyle and 3 is the closest to the recommendations that favor good health .
diet in contrast to the visa - teen , other studies that evaluate the quality of the diet do not evaluate the consumption of water and carbonated beverages and do evaluate variables that the visa - teen does not , such as the number of portions or daily breakfast intake .
these differences in the gathered information make comparisons difficult , but it may be assessed if the observed tendencies are similar .
the mean of the scores for the diet component was 2 points .
this value corresponds to habits that may not be considered negative for health but that can be improved .
in the studies presented by ayechu in 2010 [ 58 ] and rodriguez et al. in 2012 [ 59 ] , the results of the mediterranean diet 's quality index , kidmed , in 13 - to 16 - year - old spanish adolescents are analyzed .
in both cases , the largest group is that categorized as " needing improvement " .
similar studies are obtained from the spanish state by kontogianni et al .
[ 60 ] , who conclude that the modal group amongst greek adolescents is also that of " needs improvement " .
thus , despite evaluating different aspects , the evaluation of our sample and the evaluations of the other aforementioned studies suggest that improvements are needed with respect to the aspects related to the eating habits of adolescents .
however , this suggestion should take into account that the results are not extremely negative .
upon analyzing the relationship of the diet component with the gender variable , it is confirmed that the score is significantly higher for girls ( 2.20 points on average ) than it is for boys ( 1.88 points on average ) .
we shall again refer to studies that do not evaluate the same variables for comparison .
in those cases , the results contradict those obtained by the visa - teen because the studies [ 58 - 60 ] suggest a poorer diet is observed with girls than with boys .
this difference lies in the fact that the kidmed evaluates , amongst other practices , daily breakfast consumption .
this question is associated with a negative score , and the percentage of girls who do not eat breakfast daily is greater than that of boys .
the study by dinzeo et al. in 2013 [ 61 ] amongst 18 - to 25 - year - old individuals evaluates cholesterol , sugar , sodium , fruit , and vegetable intake .
in the study , as in the visa - teen , girls have higher scores than boys do. older adolescents have lower scores than the younger adolescents .
this same association between diet and age is also observed in the hbsc - 2010 , which analyzes fruit , vegetable , carbonated beverage , and daily breakfast intake [ 2 ] .
this tendency is also seen in the fresc - 2012 [ 46 ] study on catalan adolescents. with respect to origin , native adolescents scored higher than immigrants .
the 2011 study by prado et al .
[ 62 ] obtained similar results when it analyzed the eating habits of adolescents from madrid with the kidmed .
the scores of natives were higher than those of immigrants , except in the case of the maghrebians , who other studies had already been shown to have eating habits similar to those of spanish people , possibly due to their origin from a mediterranean country [ 63 ]. with respect to the positive association between family wealth and diet , other studies also show the same relationship .
vereecken et al .
[ 64 ] concludes that adolescents at the lowest family wealth levels skip more lunches , and the hbsc - 2010 [ 2 ] also found that in the spanish state , the adolescents at the lowest levels ate breakfast fewer days per week , ate fewer fruits and vegetables , ate more sweets , and had a higher intake of sweetened beverages .
physical activity the results on this component , without taking into account socio - demographic factors , may be considered satisfactory .
the mean is 2.29 points , and the majority of adolescents ( 56.61 %) scored between 2.5 and 3 points .
the inclusion of physical education in the secondary educational curriculum plays an important role in this good score [ 65 ]. that the score decreases significantly after 16 years of age , at which time secondary education ends , stands as proof of this assertion .
when physical activity is analyzed with respect to gender , we observe that the score is significantly higher for boys than for girls .
similarly , the analysis of the helena - 2009 [ 48 ] and the hbsc - 2010 [ 2 ] studies shows that boys have more hours of daily moderate - to - vigorous physical activity than girls do. other more objective studies , based on measurements taken with an accelerometer , conclude that sedentary lifestyle is greater in girls [ 66 , 67 ] .
age is also a determining factor in this component .
there is a decrease of 0.57 points between the youngest and oldest adolescents , with a moderate magnitude of the effect ( d = 0.66 ) .
this tendency towards a decrease in physical activity with increased age is also observed in the abovementioned studies , i.e. , helena - 2009 [ 48 ] and hbsc - 2010 [ 2 ] .
in 2013 , mitchell et al. published a study [ 68 ] , based on accelerometer measurements , in which they obtained results in the same direction .
the daily median dedicated to moderate or vigorous physical activity decreased from 38.4 minutes at 12 years of age to 27.6 minutes at 15 years of age .
ortega et al. arrived at the same conclusion in a cohort study of estonian and swedish adolescents , showing that in that population , daily physical activity decreased for every year of growth by 2.5 minutes for boys and 1 minute for girls [ 69 ] .
location has also been shown to significantly influence physical activity .
in rural settings ( less than 10,000 inhabitants ) , adolescents scored 2.5 points higher than in urban settings .
these data are comparable with other studies that evaluate the physical condition of school - aged children , conclude that it is superior in rural areas [ 70 , 71 ] , and obtain magnitudes of the effects similar to those obtained by the visa - teen .
lastly , the same relationship between physical activity and family wealth , based on the fas ii , is observed by the hbsc - 2010 [ 2 ] , telama et al .
[ 72 ] , the helena - 2009 study [ 49 ] , and borraccino et al .
[ 73 ] .
when comparing the physical activity of adolescents at the low and high family wealth levels , the magnitude of the effect observed in this last study was d = 0.23 for boys and d = 0.27 for girls , values that are comparable to those obtained in the present study ( d = 0.23 with no gender difference ) .
substance abuse this component is where a stronger influence from one of the factors is produced .
age is clearly associated with the score obtained , with a magnitude of the effect of d = 1.41 .
given that the mean was 2.5 points , the analysis of the global score in this component may thus be deceiving .
the perspective changes radically when we analyze the data on the different ages .
in this case , the score decreases progressively from 2.85 points at 13 years of age to 1.89 at 19 years of age .
this association between age and substance abuse coincides with the conclusions published by the health department of the government of catalonia when the results from the estudes - 2010 survey for catalonia were analyzed [ 74 ] and also with the conclusions published by the public health agency of barcelona in its report on the risk factors for secondary education students ( fresc - 2012 ) [ 46 ] .
urban / rural location was another factor in which significant differences have been found .
the adolescents from rural areas scored lower than those from urban areas ( the means are 2.31 and 2.51 points , respectively ) .
these results are comparable with those obtained in 2008 in andalucia [ 75 ] , where it was concluded that alcohol consumption and illegal drug use patterns are higher in adolescents from rural areas , while tobacco use had no significant differences .
lastly , origin was also related to substance abuse .
immigrant adolescents had higher scores than natives did .
in 2009 , luengo et al. showed that the group of immigrant adolescents in spain is not uniform , and they recommended approaching the topic of drug consumption in immigrants by segregating according to country of origin [ 76 ] .
in our analysis , we did not take this possibility into account , given that the resulting groups would have been too small to reach any conclusions .
nonetheless , given that the largest group in our study is latin american , we may compare our results with those obtained by tortajada et al. in 2008 [ 77 ] .
their study concludes that alcohol , cannabis , tobacco , amphetamine , hallucinogen , and tranquilizer use is higher in native adolescents .
rational use of leisure technology ( rult ) this component is the least influenced by sociodemographic factors ( it only showed a relationship with age ) , and it is the component on which the adolescents have the lowest scores .
the use of new technologies to access the internet and connect with others has become universal in recent years .
in the last third of 2014 , 2.4 million adolescents used the internet [ 78 ] .
this generalization of internet use increasingly leads to questioning the meaning of rational use and when problematic , abusive , or addictive use may be discussed [ 79 , 80 ] .
the mean score obtained in this component was 1.95 points , and the largest group was between 1.5 and 2 points ( 32.75 %) .
more than a quarter of respondents had a score lower than 1.5 , i.e. , had habits that may negatively affect their health .
there was no comparable measure in other studies that evaluated the same component of leisure technology use and hours of sleep .
thus , any comparison made would be incomplete .
the results obtained by the fresc - 2012 study showed that 40 % of adolescents in barcelona spent more than 2 hours in front of a computer with no academic purpose [ 46 ] .
more than 2 hours per day is the value that , according to tsitsika et al. , correlates to a problematic use of the internet [ 81 ]. with respect to the relationship between rult and age , the score decreased significantly from 13 to 17 years of age .
these data coincide with the results obtained by the frsc - 2012 [ 46 ] , which observed that the hours dedicated to using the computer for non - academic purposes during the school week increased with age .
a study in japan with nearly 100,000 adolescents [ 82 ] concluded that there was an increase in mobile phone use ( to talk as well as to chat ) at sleep time with age and showed that this negatively influenced the quality of sleep , which decreased with age .
hygiene on this component , the adolescents obtained a mean score of 2.38 points .
thus , we can consider that it is satisfactory but could improve .
the habits of adolescents are close to the recommendations for the frequency of hand washing and tooth brushing .
the good score on dental hygiene may be due to the information campaigns by the catalan government that started in 2006 [ 83 ] .
the hbsc - 2010 [ 2 ] concluded that nearly two - thirds of spanish adolescents brushed their teeth more than once per day , a value that coincides with that obtained by artacoz et al. in 2007 in the province of navarra [ 84 ] .
the frequency of hand washing in adolescents is not well studied at the spanish level , but the adolescents surveyed by the visa - teen have lived through the campaigns that started with the inauguration of global handwashing day in 2008 [ 85 ] .
these campaigns had special repercussions after the type a flu pandemic arrived in spain in 2009 , and even today , there are still many health portals directed to adolescents and the general population [ 85 - 87 ] .
these campaigns have contributed , in our opinion , to the good hygienic habits amongst adolescents in catalonia .
place of origin is associated with this component .
immigrant adolescents score higher on this component of the visa - teen than native adolescents do. this fact contradicts the findings of other studies , which conclude that there is an inverse relationship .
ramos [ 88 ] concludes that immigrant adolescents in andalucia wash their hands less , and molina and pastor show that immigrant children have worse dental health than do native children [ 89 ]. by contrast , the results published by artacoz et al .
[ 84 ] are similar to those found in our study and note that immigrants brush their teeth with more frequency than natives do. thus , this is a controversial component that should be analyzed in more depth , taking into account the country or area of origin of the immigrants .
age also shows a relationship with hygiene .
once again , we find that the score decreases as age increases , dropping from 2.35 points at 13 years of age to 2.09 at 18 years of age .
this tendency towards a worsening of hygienic habits with age is not seen in the hbsc - 2010 , which concludes that there is no difference in the frequency of tooth brushing amongst the different age groups , although the data from the hbsc - 2010 may be masked by gender , i.e. , while the frequency increases in girls , it decreases in boys [ 2 ] .
lastly , gender was also a factor associated with hygiene .
boys had lower scores than girls .
this relationship was also observed , as noted above , in the hbsc - 2010 , which concluded that , at both the european level and the spanish national level , the frequency of tooth brushing was higher for girls than for boys .
this relationship may be attributed to girls' concern with body image [ 2 , 90 ] .
similarly , the study by vadiakas et al. of 2,481 12 - to 15 - year - old greek adolescents shows that girls had a better level of oral hygiene [ 91 ] .
in conclusion , we may accept that in general terms , the lifestyles of adolescents in catalonia are satisfactory but that there are components ( such as substance abuse and rult ) that need substantial improvement .
it is also established that any study of adolescent lifestyles should take into account the socio - demographic factors that influence it , i.e. , age , gender , urban / rural location , origin ( immigrant / native ) , and family wealth level .

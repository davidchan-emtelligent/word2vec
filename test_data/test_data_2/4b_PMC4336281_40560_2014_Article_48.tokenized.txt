idiopathic pneumonia syndrome ( ips ) is a fatal non - infectious respiratory complication that develops after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( hsct ) .
because of the poor prognosis of post - hsct patients with ips requiring mechanical ventilatory support , performing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) has been regarded as relatively contraindicated in these patients .
a tumor necrosis factor - alpha inhibitor , etanercept , has been reported to be a promising treatment option for post - hsct patients with ips ; however , the phase iii clinical trial of etanercept has recently been terminated without definitive conclusion .
if post - hsct patients with ips really benefit from etanercept , mechanical ventilation ( mv ) - dependent ips patients might be worth receiving ecmo treatment in line with the protective lung strategy .
we therefore performed veno - venous ecmo ( vv - ecmo ) , which substantially acted as an extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal , on a 56 - year - old post - hsct male with severe mv - dependent ips due to graft - versus - host disease .
although a serious bleeding complication due to post - hsct thrombocytopenia occurred , the vv - ecmo was continued for 11 days .
the patient successfully entered remission of the ips and was finally extubated on the 12th mv day .
however , the patient soon complained of dyspnea , probably due to cytomegalovirus infection and / or exacerbation of the ips , and was reintubated after 3 days of extubation .
the patient then rapidly developed irreversible type ii respiratory failure despite the administration of etanercept and an anti - cytomegalovirus agent and died on the eighth re - mv day .
the autopsy findings of the patient revealed diffuse alveolar damage and alveolar hemorrhage , accompanied with bronchitis obliterans in his lungs , as well as whole body cytomegalovirus infection , which were compatible with the clinical diagnosis of the patient .
we think that the legitimacy of this treatment strategy is dependent on the overall prognosis of ips , which is influenced by the complications induced by immunosuppressants and ecmo , especially infections and bleeding .

keywords idiopathic pneumonia syndrome extracorporeal membrane oxygenation extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal tumor necrosis factor - alpha inhibitor etanercept hematopoietic stem cell transplantation graft - versus - host disease issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 background patients with hematological malignancies after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( hsct ) often suffer from respiratory complications [ 1 ] , and those who require mechanical ventilation ( mv ) are known to have a poor prognosis [ 2 ] .
idiopathic pneumonia syndrome ( ips ) , one of the non - infectious respiratory complications that occurs after hsct , is regarded as an extremely life - threatening condition , and its prevalence is estimated to be 3 % to 15 % in post - hsct patients [ 3 ] .
in particular , mv - dependent post - hsct patients with ips have been reported to have a 95 % to 100 % mortality rate [ 4 - 6 ] .
recently , the effectiveness of a tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) inhibitor , etanercept , has been aggressively studied to post - hsct ips patients [ 7 - 9 ] , and thus , mv - dependent ips patients may also benefit from etanercept treatment [ 7,8 ] .
therefore , a lung - protective strategy for mv - dependent ips patients is considered to be important to avoid volutrauma and / or ventilator - induced lung injury ( vili ) until etanercept can exert its effects .
the usefulness of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ecmo ) for acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) has been reported in recent years [ 10 ] , but in general , ecmo is considered to be ineffective for patients with malignancies [ 11,12 ] , and the post - hsct patients with respiratory complications have been regarded to be relatively contraindicated for ecmo [ 13 ] .
however , if post - hsct patients with ips exhibit an improvement or reversal of their condition by the administration of etanercept , mv - dependent ips patients might be worth receiving ecmo treatment in line with a lung - protective strategy .
we herein report a post - hsct case with ips , in whom we performed veno - venous ecmo ( vv - ecmo ) because the patient was expected to have a reversal of his condition by the induction treatment with a tnf - alpha inhibitor .
to the best of our knowledge , only one very recent case report has been published on an ips patient who underwent vv - ecmo [ 14 ] , so our report will be the first on a post - hsct patient with ips who was concurrently treated with vv - ecmo and a tnf - alpha inhibitor .
case presentation a 56 - year - old male had developed nephrotic syndrome due to primary amyloidosis 12 years earlier and had gone into complete remission following melphalan - prednisone therapy .
however , after continuing the melphalan - prednisone therapy for about 10 years , bicytopenia was detected , and he was diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and underwent allogenic bone marrow transplantation ( bmt ) from a human leukocyte antigen identical sibling donor 11 months prior to his presentation at our hospital .
the engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells was observed 24 days after bmt , and acute graft - versus - host disease ( gvhd ) was not observed while the patient was being treated using cyclosporine as an immunosuppressant .
however , the follow - up chimerism analysis revealed the survival of recipient - derived cells , so the cyclosporine was reduced in the hopes of inducing a graft - versus - leukemia ( gvl ) effect approximately 4 months after the bmt .
the cyclosporine was then gradually decreased and discontinued , and the recipient - derived cells almost disappeared due to the gvl effect .
one month before the intensive care unit ( icu ) admission , he suffered from an influenza a infection and developed dyspnea with gvhd exacerbation .
cyclosporine re - administration was initiated for the gvhd aggravation , and concurrently , antibiotics , antifungal agents , and antiviral agents were introduced empirically .
despite these therapies , his respiratory symptoms got worse , and he was transferred to the icu .
a computed tomography ( ct ) examination of his chest revealed bilateral peripheral dominant patchy consolidations accompanied with diffuse ground glass opacity ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 computed tomography scans of the patient taken on the first icu day .
these images show the widespread bilateral peripheral field - dominant patchy consolidations accompanied with diffuse ground glass opacity .
on admission to the icu , tachypnea ( respiratory rate 36 / min ) and dyspnea with a low oxygen saturation value by pulse oximetry were observed .
we considered that the patient might be suffering from ips because of the gvhd - related respiratory symptoms , so high - dose methylprednisolone therapy ( 1 g / day for three days ) under non - invasive positive pressure ventilation was initiated from the first icu day .
unfortunately , that night , the patient developed severe hypoxemia and his consciousness rapidly deteriorated , so he was finally intubated and received mv ( figure 2 ) .
the initial mv mode was biphasic positive airway pressure , with an inspiratory fraction of oxygen ( fio2 ) of 0.8 , a peak inspiratory pressure ( pip ) of 28 cmh2o , positive end - expiratory pressure ( peep ) of 10 cmh2o , respiratory frequency of 15 / min and tidal volume of around 6 ml / ideal body weight ( bw ) .
however , as his spontaneous breathing force gradually increased , probably due to poor oxygenation and respiratory acidosis ( ph 7.159 , paco2 77.4 mmhg , hco3 - 27.8 mmol / l , pao2 / fio2 135 ) , along with his poor lung compliance ( lung compliance 18 ml / cm h2o ) , his strong inspiratory effort generated a large tidal volume up to 10 ml / ideal bw and an asynchrony with the ventilator was observed .
his large tidal volume and asynchrony were sustained irrespective of deep sedation and ventilator setting changes , raising concerns about volutrauma and / or vili .
as he already fulfilled the severity criteria for vv - ecmo due to his murray 's score of 3.25 points on the following day , we decided to introduce ecmo therapy with an expectation of a recovery in his lung injury by the administration of etanercept for the ips .
figure 2 the icu course of the patient .
bipap bilevel positive airway pressure , f i o 2 fraction of inspired oxygen , mpsl methylprednisolone , nasal hf nasal high flow system , nppv non - invasive positive pressure ventilation , paco 2 partial pressure of carbon dioxide , pao 2 partial pressure of oxygen , peep positive end - expiratory pressure , pip peak inspiratory pressure , psv pressure support ventilation , spsl soluble prednisolone , vv - ecmo veno - venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation .
after obtaining informed consent , the patient was cannulated with a 19 fr. cannula for venous drainage into his right femoral vein and a 15 fr. cannula for oxygen - supplemented blood infusion into his right internal jugular vein .
due to the narrow vascular size of the patient , the catheters we used were smaller in diameter than the general recommendation of vv - ecmo .
because of this small diameter , the ecmo session was initiated with an extracorporeal blood flow of 1.5 to 2 l / min , which was relatively low flow rate , with a sweep gas flow of 2 l / min at 80 % oxygen ( centrifugal pump , capiox ( r ) sp101 plus ; oxygenator , capiox ( r ) lx , terumo , tokyo , japan ) , and anticoagulation therapy with unfractionated heparin was initiated to maintain an activated clotting time over 150 s. soon after the induction of vv - ecmo , the patient was performed bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) and confirmed to have ips without any active pulmonary infections based on bal fluid testing 72 h later , so we administered etanercept subcutaneously at a dose of 16 mg ( 0.4 mg / kg ) twice a week from the fifth icu day , accompanied by methylprednisolone consolidation therapy ( 80 mg / day for 7 days and 40 mg / day for the subsequent 7 days ) .
during the ecmo session , he was administered with adequate sedatives and analgesics , and pressure support ( ps ) ventilation was used with a peep of 10 cmh2o , ps of 5 cmh2o , and fio2 of 0.3 , so as to maintain lung - rest and prevent alveolar collapse .
a few days after the administration of etanercept , his oxygenation was ameliorated up to pao2 / fio2 353 mmhg in spite of the low extracorporeal flow rate ; nevertheless , his chest x - p showed no sign of improvement of the bilateral consolidations .
therefore , we considered that the patient still had not entered the remission phase of ips and continued the vv - ecmo , which was substantially acted as ' extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal ( ecco2r )' , in line with a lung - protective strategy .
after further several days , the consolidations in his bilateral lung field almost vanished ( figure 3 ) , so we considered that he had successfully entered remission from the ips .
figure 3 computed tomography scans of the patient taken on the 12th icu day .
these images show the amelioration of the consolidations of the bilateral lung fields .
on the other hand , he suffered from severe bleeding complications from the vascular access sites used for ecmo , probably due to post - hsct - related thrombocytopenia , which persisted at less than 2 x 104 / mul , and transfusions of platelet concentrate and packed red blood cells were required almost every day during the ecmo session .
on the 12th icu day ( the 11th vv - ecmo day ) , the patient was withdrawn from the ecmo without ventilator setting changes and was successfully extubated on the 13th icu day .
a blood gas analysis performed just before the extubation showed improved oxygenation ( ph 7.444 , paco2 46.5 mm hg , hco3 - 31.2 mmol / l , pao2 / fio2 294 ) under pressure support ventilation with a peep of 5 cmh2o , ps of 5 cmh2o and fio2 of 0.4 ( additional file 1 : table s1 ) .
however , the patient experienced a gradually worsening severe cough beginning the day after extubation , and his oxygen saturation was deteriorating despite oxygen therapy , he received a humidified high - flow nasal cannula on the 14th icu day .
as his chest radiography study revealed an exacerbation of the bilateral consolidation , and his blood sample examination revealed seropositivity for the cytomegalovirus antigen , the patient was considered to have developed cytomegalovirus pneumonia and / or an exacerbation of the remitted ips .
despite the concurrent administration of an anti - cytomegalovirus agent and etanercept , his oxygenation worsened and he required both reintubation and mv support on the 16th icu day .
a few days later , he developed type ii respiratory failure , and he died on the 22nd icu day .
the autopsy findings revealed diffuse alveolar damage and alveolar hemorrhage , accompanied with bronchitis obliterans in his lung , as well as whole body cytomegalovirus infection , which were compatible with the clinical diagnosis of the patient .
discussion in 1993 , the definition of ips was proposed as a widespread alveolar injury after hsct in the absence of active lower respiratory tract infection , which was based upon a bal examination or lung biopsy , without cardiogenic causes of pulmonary dysfunction [ 3 ] .
many factors , such as the use of chemotherapies before bmt , gvhd , and various other factors , including the hematopoietic stem cell donor characteristics , were identified as risk factors for ips , and it was revealed that tnf - alpha also participates in the onset of ips [ 4 ] .
in recent years , a positive impact of a tnf - alpha inhibitor , etanercept , on post - hsct patients with ips was reported [ 7,8 ] , and a phase iii clinical trial of etanercept for ips is conducted [ 9 ] .
unfortunately , this trial was not able to show the effectiveness of etanercept for post - hsct patients with ips , the definitive conclusion should not be made based on this trial alone because of its inadequate power and small sample size .
according to the report of the extracorporeal life support organization ( elso ) registry , the results of ecmo for severe respiratory failure in adult patients with malignancy were extremely poor [ 11 ]. that study included four adult post - hsct cases ; however , the elso registry concluded that it is impossible to make any recommendations because of the small number of cases .
the elso registry also reported that the result of ecmo for the severe respiratory failure of pediatric post - hsct patients was extremely poor [ 12 ] .
therefore , performing ecmo for post - hsct patients with severe respiratory failure has been generally considered to be relatively contraindicated by these reports [ 13 ] .
however , although four adult post - hsct patients were included in the elso report and all had indication of ecmo for pulmonary support [ 11 ] , there was no mention about their individual causes of respiratory failure , and thus , we have no information about whether these patients suffered from ips or other diseases .
conversely , a first case report which performed vv - ecmo for an mv - dependent ips patient was recently published [ 14 ]. that paper reported the successful use of vv - ecmo along with conventional treatment for ips , mainly by glucocorticoid administration , without etanercept .
this case report might show the usefulness of the lung rest introduced by ecmo in mv - dependent ips patients .
although it is not known whether the results of the cesar trial [ 10 ] , which showed the usefulness of vv - ecmo for ards , are applicable for other types of severe respiratory failure , such as ips , we applied the entry criteria of the cesar trial , especially the murray 's score [ 15 ] >= 3 points , to determine whether to introduce vv - ecmo in our case , as it was the only reported case of the successful use of vv - ecmo for ips [ 14 ] .
according to the berlin definition of ards [ 16 ] , however , this case was defined as not the ' severe type ' but the ' moderate type ' of ards and generally recommended less invasive respiratory supports than ecmo .
however , considering the extremely poorer prognosis of mv - dependent ips patients compared with even ' severe ' ards in the berlin definition ( mortality , 95 % - 100 % [ 4 - 6 ] vs. 45 % [ 16 ]) , we assume that vulnerabilities of mv - dependent ips patients would be underestimated when we applied this definition to ips patient population .
moreover , because of our several experiences of ips patients equivalent to ' moderate ' ards prior to this case , whom were easily complicated vali in spite of the conventional lung - protective mv setting , we decided to introduce vv - ecmo after due consideration .
because ecmo is a highly invasive and expensive treatment , it is necessary to judge the indications carefully .
even if using ecmo for ips is valid to prevent vili , as was suggested in the aforementioned case report [ 14 ] , the careful evaluation of the risk - effect ratio with treatment alternatives , which are less invasive and / or less expensive than ecmo , is essential .
in particular , it is important to take into consideration the risk of hemorrhagic complications , which may be induced by anticoagulation therapy and serious post - hsct thrombocytopenia , as was seen in our case .
the reason why the patient exhibited aggravated symptoms soon after the extubation may have included not only a re - exacerbation of ips but also the cytomegalovirus infection .
if the immunosuppression induced by etanercept , along with the high - dose methylprednisolone therapy , is excessive , the concurrent treatment with the induction of etanercept and vv - ecmo for post - hsct patients with ips may be considered as a relative contraindication , as is mentioned in the elso registry guideline [ 13 ] .
although some unresolved problems exist , such as uncertainty of the efficacy of etanercept and vv - ecmo for ips , the risks of immunosuppression generated by etanercept and other immunosuppressants and the bleeding tendency due to post - hsct - related thrombocytopenia , we consider that the usefulness of concurrent therapy of immunosuppressants including etanercept and ecmo for ips deserves an evaluation .
however , it should be evaluated by not only the short - term prognosis , such as ips remission or mv withdrawal , but also the long - term prognosis , such as the overall survival .
conclusions to the best of our knowledge , our case is the second reported post - hsct patient with ips on mv who underwent vv - ecmo .
in addition , this is the first case treated with concurrent etanercept and vv - ecmo for mv - dependent ips .
we think that the legitimacy of this treatment strategy is dependent on the overall prognosis of ips , which is influenced by the complications induced by immunosuppressants including etanercept and ecmo , especially infections and bleeding .
further studies on this treatment modality are anticipated in the future .

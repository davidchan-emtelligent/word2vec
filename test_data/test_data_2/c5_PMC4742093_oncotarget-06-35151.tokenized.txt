chromosome section germline development dna demethylation methylome the role of the germline is to transmit genetic and epigenetic information from one generation to the next .
primordial germ cells ( pgcs ) are the pioneering germ cell population in mammals and exist for a relatively short period of time during gestation .
pgcs are induced from the epiblast by bone morphogenetic protein 4 ( bmp4 ) signaling .
these definitive pgcs then migrate from their site of origin to the developing gonad during gestation .
after colonization and sex - determination , they start to differentiate into male and female germ cells , which then become gametes upon spermatogenic and oogenic instructions from the niche .
since pgcs are the only embryonic cell type that is capable of differentiating into gametes , monitoring the epigenome and transcriptome of pgcs could provide important insights into the cell and molecular foundation of germline development and healthy gametes .
even though genetic information from the parental gametes is mostly maintained after fertilization and creation of the diploid embryo , the epigenome is reprogrammed with one of the major events involving the genome - wide reprogramming of dna demethylation .
a second reprogramming event in pgcs is hypothesized to remove the memory of embryo development in the epiblast .
understanding the dynamics of epigenome reprogramming in pgcs could therefore help to detect any environmental effects potentially associating with infertility or abnormal child health .
the dynamics of dna methylation reprogramming in mouse pgcs was first established by seisenberger et al in 2012 [ 1 ] .
they collected germ cells across key stages of development including pgcs from embryonic day ( e ) 9.5 to e13.5 , e16.5 germ cells , and e6.5 epiblasts .
the cpg methylation level in e6.5 epiblasts was 71 % , close to the 74 % in embryonic stem cell ( escs ) , and droped globally during pgc expansion and migration .
the cpg methylation reached the lowest level at e13.5 with an average of 14 % in male and 7 % in female pgcs .
they found that imprinting loci , cpg islands on the x chromosome and germline - specific genes are demethylated late upon entry of pgcs into the gonads between e11.5 - e13.5 .
there is a very limited relationship between loss of dna methylation and gain in gene expression , including expression of transposons .
in a second comprehensive study kobayashi et al used a post - bisulfite adaptor tagging ( pbat ) method with scaled - down amounts of dna from mouse germ cells at e10.5 to e16.5 [ 2 ] .
this group observed a similar pattern of global dna demethylation and de novo methylation during pgc development .
specifically , in mouse , after e16.5 only male pgcs have increased amounts of cpg methylation , with non - cpg methylation found around transcription start sites .
in contrast , promoter regions are depleted of de novo methylation .
the development of human pgcs starts around week 2 after fertilization being specified at the onset of gastrulation .
the definitive pgcs migrate from the yolk sac wall to the developing gonads during weeks 3 - 5 , and undergo sex differentiation after week 9 .
in 2015 , three groups published in cell the transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics of human pgc development [ 3 - 5 ] from 4 - to 19 - week - old human embryos .
compared to human somatic cells , human escs and inner cell mass , gkountela et al showed that global dna demethylation in pgcs occurs before 7 weeks of development .
this global loss of dna methylation is maintained until at least week 16 in females .
in contrast the initial wave of re - methylation in the male germline can be seen at 19 weeks of development .
the dna demethylation dynamics during week 5 to 16 parallels that reported in the mouse e10.5 to e13.5 .
this epigenetic reprogramming is not correlated with transcriptional regulation in both species .
in addition , gkountela et al discovered 585 persistently methylated regions that in some cases exhibit increased methylation during reprogramming .
these genes are not transcriptionally repressed and may be critical for diverse mechanisms. between human and mouse pgcs , some differences are observed : first , mouse pgcs show a persistent enrichment of the repressive chromatin mark h3k27me3 and global loss of h3k9me2 , while human pgcs after 9 weeks are depleted of both .
secondly , mouse pgcs undergo imprint erasure after the entry to the gonads whereas this occurs before colonization in humans .
finally , x reactivation takes place with different timing in mouse and human pgcs .
gkountela et al also found that xist might be non - silencing in the human germline since xist non - coding rna is expressed in both male and female germline cells at all stages .
these findings indicate that mice and humans exhibit differences in germline development which necessitates studying the formation of this lineage in both species .
since pgcs are unique cells that differentiate into gametes and are critical for the continuation of the species , scientists are eager to create this progenitor cell type in the lab .
using spontaneous differentiation , we have generated pgcs in vitro that are equivalent to the pre - gonadal stage [ 6 ] .
using directed differentiation irie et al. differentiated pgc - like cells ( pgclc ) at an equivalent stage with high efficiency [ 7 ] .
the resources of the human and mouse pgc methylome and transcriptome not only revealed the dynamics of epigenetic reprogramming in the germline but will also serve as a reference for scientists to generate pgcs in vitro .
the generation of pgcs in vitro will be a tremendous benefit to human reproductive medicine and the discovery of genes or environmental factors that impact formation of high quality gametes .

opiates are potent analgesics but their clinical use is limited by side effects including analgesic tolerance and opioid - induced hyperalgesia ( oih ) .
the opiates produce analgesia and other adverse effects through activation of the mu opioid receptor ( mor ) encoded by the oprm1 gene .
however , mor and morphine metabolism involvement in oih have been little explored .
hence , we examined mor contribution to oih by comparing morphine - induced hyperalgesia in wild type ( wt ) and mor knockout ( ko ) mice .
we found that repeated morphine administration led to analgesic tolerance and hyperalgesia in wt mice but not in mor ko mice .
the absence of oih in mor ko mice was found in both sexes , in two ko global mutant lines , and for mechanical , heat and cold pain modalities .
in addition , the morphine metabolite morphine - 3beta - d - glucuronide ( m3g ) elicited hyperalgesia in wt but not in mor ko animals , as well as in both mor flox and mor - nav1.8 sensory neuron conditional ko mice .
m3g displayed significant binding to mor and g - protein activation when using membranes from mor - transfected cells or wt mice but not from mor ko mice .
collectively our results show that mor is involved in hyperalgesia induced by chronic morphine and its metabolite m3g .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction chronic pain is a major public health problem with a high prevalence and impacting on quality of life .
pain treatments include both opioids and non - opioid analgesics1 .
the mu opioid receptor ( mor ) encoded by the oprm1 gene is the molecular target for opiate - mediated analgesia and has been shown to be essential for several opiate - induced side effects2 , 3 such as opioid - induced hyperalgesia ( oih ) and analgesic tolerance that preclude adequate analgesia , leaving pain unmanaged4 - 6 .
however , whether or not oih requires mor activation is still an open question .
indeed , some studies have implicated toll like receptor - 4 ( tlr4 ) , a key innate immunity receptor , as the mediator for oih7 - 12 .
however other studies led to contrasting results4 , 9 , 11 , 13 - 15 .
therefore , the clarification of mor implication in oih is an important step toward understanding oih that leads to dose escalation and opioid toxicity .
solving this question will allow designing novel strategies for analgesia and thus provide major improvement to existing pain therapies .
it will constitute a first step toward the treatment of oih itself .
it will further impact treatment of addiction , as addiction may be induced by increased pain sensitivity .
in order to determine whether mor is required for oih development , we used a genetic approach to compare wild type ( wt ) and mor knockout ( ko ) mice in oih paradigms .
in addition , given that gender represents a major factor for pain and opioid analgesia16 - 19 , we studied oih in both males and females .
then , we determined whether the morphine metabolite morphine - 3beta - d - glucuronide ( m3g ) induces hyperalgesia through mor activation .
to complete the study , we evaluated morphine metabolism to m3g in both genotypes .
morphine - and m3g - induced hypersensitivities were absent in mice harboring oprm1 gene inactivation , demonstrating unambiguously that mor represents a mandatory target for oih .
results chronic morphine induces oih in wt but not mor knockout animals we first examined whether mor is required for chronic morphine - induced hyperalgesia by measuring oih development in wt and mor ko mice ( ko mice with a neo cassette insertion in exon - 220 , see supplementary fig. s1 ) .
as expected , acute morphine induced analgesia in wt mice but not in ko mice ( fig. 1a - c ) , confirming that oprm1 gene - derived mor is the molecular target for morphine - induced analgesia2 .
the subsequent treatment with repeated morphine ( 20 mg / kg , 7 days ) led to analgesic tolerance as well as oih in wt mice ( fig. 1a - c ) .
however , no oih was found in mor ko mice as assessed for pressure , heat and cold modalities ( fig. 1b,c,e ) .
next we assessed if oih persisted following morphine arrest .
oih lasted 11 days upon morphine cessation in wt mice ( day 19 of the whole experiment ; fig. 2 ) , in agreement with previous reports5 .
in contrast , no hyperalgesia developed in mor ko mice after morphine arrest , indicating the absence of late onset hyperalgesia in the mutant animals .
figure 1 wt but not mor ko mice show hyperalgesia under repeated morphine analgesic tolerance conditions .
( a ) the experimental design shows the schedule for nociceptive measures ( arrows ) .
following baseline ( bl ) , mice received 3 mg / kg morphine ( ip ) on day - 1 ( d1 ) to evaluate morphine - induced analgesia .
mice received thereafter 20 mg / kg morphine or saline control each day until day - 7 ( d7 ) .
on d8 , nociceptive levels were measured before morphine administration to evaluate hyperalgesia , and following 3 mg / kg morphine to measure analgesic tolerance .
maintenance of hyperalgesia ( oih ) was scored on the indicated days and latent sensitization on day 27 .

( b , c ) on day - 27 when wt mice had recovered from oih ( fig. 1a ) , the opioid antagonist naltrexone induced hyperalgesia i.e. latent sensitization in wt ( b ) but no mor ko ( c ) mice .
tail immersion ( 48 degreesc , n = 11 - 14 / group for oih persistence and n = 6 - 8 / group for latent sensitization following 20 mg / kg morphine ; n = 8 - 10 / group for persistence of oih following 60 mg / kg morphine ) .
** p < 0.01 ; *** p < 0.001 ; repeated measures anova followed by newman - keuls test .
detailed statistical analyses are presented in supplementary table s3 .
in order to confirm undoubtedly the mor requirement for oih , we tested an alternative mor ko line obtained by crossing mor - flox mice with cmv - cre mice and lacking whole oprm1 gene exons 2 - 3 ( mor - cmv mice21 ; supplementary fig. s1 ) .
the mor - cmv mice showed neither analgesia nor oih while control mor - flox mice responded with analgesia and developed both tolerance and hyperalgesia ( fig. 1d ) .
then we assessed mor involvement in oih by applying another protocol previously used to investigate tlr4 role in morphine analgesic tolerance ( 60 mg / kg , 4 days22 ) .
this morphine protocol induced analgesia , tolerance and oih in wt animals but neither analgesia nor oih in mor ko animals ( supplementary fig. s2 ) .
collectively our results indicate that mor is essential for morphine - induced analgesia and hyperalgesia independently of the repeated morphine paradigm or of the mor knockout model used .
mor is required for oih in both females and males given that sex represents an important factor that affects pain and analgesia16 , 17 , we have analysed mor implication in oih in both the female and male mice .
in agreement with previous findings2 , the absence of mor did not alter basal sensitivity to heat , cold and mechanical sensitivities , either in females or in males .
morphine elicited comparable analgesia and analgesic tolerance in female and male wt animals and analgesia was absent in ko animals of both sexes ( fig. 3a,b and e,f ) .
oih induced by chronic morphine developed in wt mice of both sexes , and for all three tested modalities ( heat , pressure and cold ) and was absent in both female and male mor ko mice ( fig. 3c,d and g - j ) , showing no sex - dependency for mor implication in oih .
figure 3 morphine induced hyperalgesia in female and male wt mice but not mor ko mice .
analgesia , analgesic tolerance and oih were measured following the protocol described in fig. 1a ( see sex - grouped analysis in fig. 1 ) on female ( left panels ) and male ( right panels ) mice with the tail immersion ( a - d ) , pressure analgesimeter ( e - h ) and cold plate ( i,j ) tests for heat , pressure and cold hypersensitivities , respectively .

mor is required for oih in neuropathic pain states the role of mor in oih was further assessed in a neuropathic pain model .
partial sciatic nerve ligation ( psnl ) induced cold and mechanical allodynia as well as heat hyperalgesia measured two weeks post - psnl ( fig. 4 ) .
cold and mechanical allodynia were aggravated by a 7 - day repeated morphine treatment in wt mice while no oih was observed in ko mice ( fig. 4a - c ) .
no oih developed in wt or ko mice for the heat modality ( fig. 4d ) , similarly to corder et al.23 .
these results indicate that mor is also required for oih after nerve injury .

( a ) the experimental design shows the schedule for nociceptive measures ( arrows ) .
following determination of baseline ( bl ) and neuropathic hypersensitivity ( 14 days post - psnl , partial sciatic nerve ligation ) on a 5 degreesc cold plate , wt and mor ko mice were treated for 7 days with either morphine or saline control solution .
on d8 , allodynia was measured with the cold plate , von frey filaments and heat plantar tests .

mor ko does not change tlr4 expression tlr4 activation has been reported as a key event in morphine analgesic tolerance and oih , although conflicting results have been obtained4 , 24 .
thus , to investigate if the lack of oih in mor ko animals may be caused by a difference in tlr4 expression in ko mice , we compared tlr4 transcripts in wt and ko mice .
tlr4 expression was comparable in the spinal cord of wt and ko mice treated with chronic saline .
chronic morphine did not alter tlr4 expression in either wt or ko mice ( supplementary fig. s3 ) .
in addition , chronic morphine did not alter mor expression in wt mice .
these findings suggest that the absence of oih in our mor ko lines did not result from altered tlr4 expression .
mor is necessary for morphine - 3 - glucuronide hyperalgesia the main morphine metabolite morphine - 3 - glucuronide ( m3g ) has been proposed as a mediator of morphine - induced hyperalgesia4 , 25 .
to investigate whether the lack of morphine hyperalgesia in mor ko animals may be due to an impaired morphine metabolism to m3g in these animals , we measured m3g levels in the plasma , brain and spinal cord following morphine administration .
in control saline treated animals , we found very low endogenous m3g levels of 0.0007 mum in wt mice and 0.025 mum in ko mice .
in morphine - treated animals , the plasma m3g concentration of the ko mice ( 1.5 mum ) was decreased by 2.6 fold compared to wt mice ( 3.9 mum ) , revealing a genotype effect ( fig. 5a ) .
brain and spinal cord from morphine - treated wt and ko mice also contained significant m3g levels .
brains from ko mice contained 1.5 fold less m3g than those from wts ( fig. 5b ) although the difference was not significant ( p > 0.05 student t - test ; n = 10 / genotype ) .
spinal cords from ko and wt mice contained similar m3g levels ( fig. 5c ) .

detailed statistical analyses are presented in supplementary table s6 .
to evaluate further if mor was implicated in m3g - induced hyperalgesia , m3g - induced hypersensitivity was evaluated in wt and mor ko mice following an acute m3g administration ( 5 mg / kg i.p. ) .
m3g induced heat hyperalgesia in wt mice within 1 - 3 hr in the tail immersion assay ( fig. 5d ) .
similar results were obtained for mechanical hypersensitivity as assessed with the von frey filaments ( fig. 5e ) .
in contrast , m3g hyperalgesia was lost in ko mice ( fig. 5d,e ) revealing that mor is required for m3g - induced hyperalgesia .
together with morphine metabolism data indicating that ko mice produce m3g , these results suggest that the absence of morphine hyperalgesia in ko mice is not caused by a lack of morphine metabolism to m3g but by a pronociceptive action of m3g through mor .
we have then investigated whether peripheral mor expressed by nav1.8 sensory neurons may be involved in m3g hyperalgesia .
we observed that conditional ko ( cko ) mice deleted for mor in nav1.8 neurons displayed comparable hyperalgesia to mor flox mice ( fig. 5f,g ) , indicating that this specific mor population is not mandatory for oih .
morphine - 3 - glucuronide binds to and activates mor morphine - 3 - glucuronide has been characterized as a weak partial mor agonist in transfected cells25 .
we first investigated m3g binding to membranes from mor - transfected hek293 cells .
m3g displaced [ 3h ] - diprenorphine binding , although with a lower affinity as compared to cold damgo , morphine or fentanyl ( supplementary table s1 , fig. 6a ) .
in addition , m3g displaced [ 3h ] - damgo binding to brain homogenates from wt mice .
the affinity for m3g - induced displacement of [ 3h ] - damgo binding was 1.4 microm as compared to nanomolar affinities for damgo , morphine and fentanyl ( supplementary table s1 , fig. 6b ) , indicating that m3g binds to mor receptor expressed in brain cells .
no specific [ 3h ] - damgo binding was observed in brain homogenates from mor ko mice ( data not shown ) .
we then determined whether m3g could activate mor by comparing g - protein activation in brain from wt and mor ko mice .
we used the [ 35s ] - gtpgammas binding assay on brain membranes in which mor activation provokes [ 35s ] - gtpgammas binding to g - proteins .
morphine and damgo mor - selective agonists as well as m3g activated mor in wt brain membranes ( supplementary table s1 , fig. 6c ) .
in contrast , none of the agonists induced [ 35s ] - gtpgammas binding to ko brain membranes ( fig. 6d ) .
the blockade of m3g - evoked [ 35s ] - gtpgammas signal to wt membranes by the mor selective antagonist ctop confirmed the mor selectivity ( supplementary table s1 , fig. 6e ) .
therefore our results on the selective activation of mor by m3g corroborate in vivo mor - dependent m3g hyperalgesia .
we further investigated m3g - induced mor signalling in hek - 293 cells stably expressing mor .
we observed that m3g displayed a weak mor agonist activity on adenylate cyclase ( supplementary table s1 ) , which was blocked by naloxone ( fig. 6f ) , as well as in a label free assay of dynamic mass redistribution ( dmr ; fig. 6j ) .
however , the peak of m3g action in dmr assay appeared to occur later than with damgo and morphine ( fig. 6h,i ) , suggesting that this morphine metabolite could activate slightly different signalling pathways than classical opioid agonists .
moreover , we observed no beta - arrestin2 recruitment in mor - hek293 cells with m3g , while damgo , fentanyl and morphine ( although with a lower potency ) displayed significant beta - arrestin2 recruitment ( supplementary table s1 ; fig. 6g ) .
altogether , our data indicate that m3g significantly interacts with and signals through mor in vitro although with a weak potency , and implicate mor for oih in vivo .

discussion our results obtained with two different mor ko mouse lines and two repeated morphine schedules reveal that mor is required for morphine - induced hyperalgesia .
they confirm and extend other findings obtained with different repeated morphine administration schedules26 .
the lack of oih in global ko mice was revealed here by using tail immersion , pressure and cold plate assays for heat , mechanical and cold hypersensitivities while in this previous study26 tail immersion , hot plate and von frey filaments have been employed .
additionally , we show mor requirement in oih under a neuropathic condition using cold and mechanical sensitivity tests .
corder et al.26 did not observe oih when assessing heat and mechanical modalities following morphine administered 7 days post - unilateral chronic construction injury .
we could detect oih in wt mice receiving repeated morphine starting 14 days post - psnl when testing for cold and touch hypersensitivity , but not for heat response .
this suggests that the cold and mechanical sensitivity may be more affected by chronic morphine in neuropathic condition , and oih was absent in nerve - injured mor ko mice .
altogether this indicates that mor is mandatory for oih in both basal and neuropathic conditions .
it has been proposed that analgesia and oih may be induced by specific isoforms of mor , such as a 6tm ( 6 - transmembrane domain ) isoform , discovered since the initial mor characterization as a 7tm receptor 27 - 29 .
indeed , the activation of the 6tm mor - 1k isoform lacking the n - terminal region and first tm domain induces excitatory cellular effects by activating gs while activation of the 7tm receptor inhibits neurons via gi activation30 , relating the 6tm hypothesis to earlier works on the excitatory mechanisms for oih31 , 32 .
moreover spinal silencing of the 6tm mor - 1k variant in cxb7 / byj mice led to decreased morphine hyperalgesia , suggesting that the gs coupling of this 6tm mor form could be important for oih development29 , 33 .
our study shows that oih is abolished in both mor ko mice harboring a neo cassette insertion in exon - 220 and mor - cmv - ko mice lacking tm2 - 721 and so lacking all tm7 and tm6 potential isoforms .
this indicates that tm2 - 7 are necessary for morphine - induced hyperalgesia and leaves open 7tm and 6tm mechanisms for oih .
our results document that oih developed similarly in both female and male wt mice and was absent in mor ko mice of both sexes , showing no sex - influence for mor implication in oih under our experimental conditions .
similarly , we found no sex difference for basal nociception and morphine analgesia .
sex is known to be an important factor influencing pain and analgesia although dependent upon genetic and environmental factors16 , 17 , 34 .
furthermore , sex - dependent involvement of spinal microglia and t lymphocytes have been shown to control inflammatory and neuropathic hypersensitivity35 , 36 .
previously oih was shown to be more pronounced in female than male rats when using low sub - analgesic morphine doses37 while in morphine - infused mice there was no sex difference38 , or the sex difference depended on morphine dose and genetic background39 , 40 .
we can conclude that under our experimental conditions the role of mor in oih investigated through the comparison of wt and ko animals was apparent in both female and male mice , strengthening the conclusion on mor implication .
along with congruent recent findings26 and previous studies that indicated some downstream pathways associated with oih and exhibiting mor dependency ( see in ref .
4 , 5 ) , our results demonstrate that tlr4 is not the sole mandatory receptor in oih .
opioid - induced hyperalgesia may be distinguished from withdrawal - induced pain in that withdrawal reaction is produced by the abrupt cessation of opioid administration whereas oih is a state of pain sensitivity that may last longer .
we have shown the mor requirement in the long - term oih as hyperalgesia lasts for 12 days after morphine arrest in the non - neuropathic pain paradigm and is abolished in the ko mice ( fig. 2 ) .
in the neuropathic model , hypersensitivity was investigated only on the day post morphine cessation. whether this hyperalgesia that follows nerve injury and chronic morphine treatment would be withdrawal - induced hyperalgesia , or rather long - lasting oih caused by activation of opponent nociceptive processes , remains to be determined as well as the common and distinct molecular and cellular adaptations underlying the two types of hypersensitivity responses .
multiple mechanisms have been shown to contribute to both opioid - induced hypersensitivities4 - 6 , 41 , 42 .
they include amongst others the pronociceptive actions of low morphine levels and of opioid metabolites , excitatory mechanisms in mor - expressing cells and at some sites of the pain control system as well as pronociceptive anti - opioid and neuroimmune processes .
one cause of oih was shown to be due to low residual morphine levels following morphine cessation , as acutely administered low morphine levels similar to those found two days after cessation of morphine produced hyperalgesia43 .
this mechanism was described to be opioid - dependent as oih was reversed by the opioid antagonist naloxone43 , and may thus contribute to oih in our experiments .
morphine - 3 - glucuronide is the main morphine metabolite and was reported to mediate hyperalgesia .
the plasma concentrations of morphine and m3g peak at 30 min and 3 hrs post - administration in mice44 and humans45 , respectively .
morphine and m3g levels remain stable upon chronic morphine administration46 , indicating that chronic treatments do not lead to morphine or m3g accumulation that would trigger pain .
our data reveal that acute m3g decreases nociceptive levels , at a lower dose than previously described9 .
in addition , we show that mor is required for m3g - induced hyperalgesia , suggesting that m3g - mor may mediate oih .
both mor and tlr4 have been identified as oih targets for morphine and m3g4 , 5 , 47 , and our present data indicate that mor is required for m3g - induced hyperalgesia .
morphine - 3 - glucuronide has been characterized as a weak mor ligand and partial agonist .
it displaces [ 3 h ] - damgo binding to guinea - pig brain homogenates with a ki of 0.36 mum as compared to the ki of 0.0018 mum reported for morphine48 .
a weak affinity , as assessed by [ 3 h ] - naloxone binding displacement to human mor expressed in hek293 cells , was shown ( ki 6 mum ) , together with an 8 mum ec50 for gi activation as compared to 0.05 mum for damgo and 0.015 mum for morphine and a bias toward b - arrestin2 recruitment as compared to morphine in mor - transfected hek293 cells25 , 49 .
our study confirmed the weak affinity for binding to mor expressed both on mor - transfected hek293 cells and in mouse brain and indicate that m3g is a partial agonist as it is unable to elicit a maximal 100 % response in several signaling assays .
following morphine administration , micromolar m3g concentrations are found in blood ( our results and ref. 44 ) .
we recorded similar m3g levels in brain and spinal cord of wt and ko animals that can activate mor to produce hyperalgesia in the wts .
the cause for the lower m3g levels in the plasma of ko mice than plasma from wt mice , while m3g contents were similar in wt and ko brain and spinal cord , may be further explored .
the difference in plasma m3g may be due to alterations in morphine metabolism44 by glucuronyl transferases50 , pharmacokinetics , passage through the blood - brain barrier through atp - binding cassette transporters51 or organic anion transporting polypeptides52 , as well as elimination44 .
altogether our results suggest that some differences in m3g signalling compared to other opioid agonists could explain why this molecule displays hyperalgesic rather than analgesic activity .
besides , m3g was shown to display low affinity binding to tlr4 and to induce cellular effects distinct from the classical tlr4 activator lps .
in the hek - blue - tlr4 secreted alkaline phosphatase ( seap ) signalling assay , m3g weakly activates tlr4 but also partly inhibits lps - induced tlr4 activation24 .
furthermore m3g does not elicit classical lps - induced activation markers in human and mouse macrophages24 , while morphine effects on macrophages were reported to be mor - dependent and independent53 , 54 .
in addition , the investigation of tlr4 involvement in oih by using tlr4 knockout mice led to conflicting results4 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 14 .
we analysed spinal tlr4 expression level in wt and ko animals and found comparable tlr4 levels in wt and mor ko animals , indicating that mor gene inactivation does not alter tlr4 expression in a major way .
in addition , chronic morphine did not elevate tlr4 levels in either wt or mor ko mice , showing that oih does not require tlr4 up - regulation while not excluding potential mor - tlr4 interactions in oih .
interestingly , morphine elevated tnf - alpha expression in macrophages in mice , and tnf - alpha was shown to stimulate nf - kb activation and seap production in a tlr4 - independent manner in the hek - blue - tlr4 reporter cells , implicating macrophage tnf - alpha as a novel mediator for oih55 .
also , morphine was found to activate nf - kb in a mor - dependent fashion in microglia56 and to increase brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) in microglia in a tlr4 - independent way13 .
in contrast , spinal microglia were found to be activated in mor ko mice displaying no oih after morphine treatment , suggesting no correlation between spinal microglia activation and oih26 .
nonetheless , in this study the spinal microglia activation state was not documented in mor ko mice in the absence of morphine and other papers show oprm1 expression in microglia57 , 58 , precluding a definitive conclusion on this point .
recently , a novel oih mechanism dependent on mor expressed by nociceptors has been shown , based on targeted oprm1 gene inactivation in trpv1 - cre positive cells26 .
oih is absent in these mor - trpv1 cko mice26 while we find a maintained oih in mor - nav1.8 cko mice .
collectively this suggests that mor on trpv1 - positive / nav1.8 - negative cells is implicated in oih .
in the drgs , nav1.8 and trpv1 neurons only partially overlap .
lagerstrom et al.59 has shown that nav1.8 - cre + drg neurons include 67 % trpv1 - expressing neurons while trpv1 neurons comprise 76 % nav1.8 - expressing cells .
also , based on single - cell transcriptomics , usoskin et al. have classified drg neurons into 11 eleven types60 .
mor is expressed in one subclass of nav1.8 - high - trpv1 - low neurons , in one subclass of trpv1 - high - nav1.8 - low neurons , and in three subclasses of double nav1.8 - trpv1 neurons belonging to the peptidergic or non - peptidergic neurons .
mor displays also a low expression in one subclass of neurofilament - positive neurons .
the role of mor expressed by these different subclasses of peripheral neurons needs to be further investigated .
mechanisms for oih also include descending pain facilitation from rostral ventromedial medulla ( rvm ) 61 .
finally , neuron - microglia interactions in reward and other central circuits were shown important for injury - induced pain and tolerance62 and might in that respect participate in oih .
in conclusion , morphine - induced hyperalgesia was absent in mor ko mice , highlighting mor requirement on oih .
taken together , the present and previous studies suggest a role for specific mor populations26 , 61 , 63 , isoforms33 or signalling64 at some nervous system sites that require further investigation .
the mor - dependent mechanisms may involve the morphine metabolite m3g as m3g - hyperalgesia is also lost in mor ko animals .
furthermore , our results on mor in oih clearly show that tlr4 is not the sole oih mediator , and the relationships between these two receptors need to be further explored .
targeting biased signalling at mor65 may help designing novel therapeutic analgesic strategies devoid of opioid side effects including oih .
finally , the crucial role of mor shown here justifies strategies based on mor delta - opioid receptor heterodimers66 , mor - chemokine receptor and mor beta - 2 - adrenergic receptor cross talk41 , 67 , or putative mor - tlr4 functional interactions to attenuate analgesic tolerance and oih .
methods animals and ethical statement all the experiments were carried out in accordance with the european communities council directive of 22 september 2010 ( directive 2010 / 63 / ue ) , under the guidelines of the committee for research and ethical issues of iasp published in pain , 1983 ; 16:109 - 110 and were approved by the local ethical committee ( com'eth , comite d'ethique pour l'experimentation animale igbmc - ics , licence ndegrees 17 ) with the agreement number 00876 - 02 .
mice were housed under standard light , temperature and humidity conditions ( 12 h light - dark cycle , 21 +/ - 1 degreesc , 55 +/ - 10 % humidity ) .
cage bedding was from anibed ( pontvallain , france ; reference ab3 ) and food from safe ( augy , france ; reference d03 ) .
water ( autoclaved tap water ) was available ad libitum .
mice were kept group - housed at 2 - 4 / cage .
in each group equal numbers of male and female mice were used , aged of 10 - 16 weeks .
mice were habituated to their experimental environment and handled for one week before starting the experiments .
particular efforts were made to minimize the number of mice and the pain they experienced .
behavioral tests were performed blind to the genotype and treatment .
studies are reported following the arrive guidelines for reporting experiments involving animals68 .
mice lacking mu opioid receptors ( conventional mor ko mice20 ) had been generated by homologous recombination as described in supplemental fig. 1a .
these were compared to their wild type ( wt ) littermates for behavioral and molecular studies .
behavioral results were analyzed on grouped males and females except for the female - male separate analysis shown in fig. 3. we used a second mor ko mouse line lacking whole oprm1 gene exons 2 - 3 , obtained by crossing mor - flox mice with cmv - cre mice21 , see supplementary fig. 1c .
these mice are named mor - cmv throughout the study .
mor - cmv ko mice were compared to their oprm1 - gene floxed littermates ( mor - flox mice ) in experiments shown in fig. 1d .
the genetic background of all mice was 50 % c57 / bl6j : 50 % 129svpas .
behavioral testing nociception assays were performed as previously described21 .
to determine heat nociceptive thresholds , the tail immersion test was performed by immersing half of the tail in a 48 degreesc water - bath .
the latency until tail withdrawal was recorded , with a 20 s cut - off latency to avoid tissue damage .
cold allodynia was determined with the cold plate apparatus ( bioseb , vitrolles , france ) .
each mouse was placed on the plate ( 5 degreesc ) for a 5 min period , and the number of paw lifts was counted .
nociception to pressure was measured with the pressure application measurement device ( ugo basile , milano , italia ) .
briefly , a progressive pressure was applied manually onto the tail and pressing was stopped when a nociceptive reaction was observed .
the pressure value at the reaction time was automatically recorded .
sensitivity to touch was determined by using von frey filaments applied under the hind paw of the mouse and following the up and down method as described21 .
drugs and treatments morphine chlorhydrate ( francopia , gentilly , france ) in saline solution ( nacl 0.9 %) or saline control solution were injected intraperitoneally ( ip ) using 100 mul solution per 10 g mouse body weight .
three different repeated morphine administration protocols were used .
the first one is shown in fig. 1a .
following baseline nociception measures , all mice received 3 mg / kg morphine on day 1 ( d1 ) to induce analgesia .
once analgesia has been scored , mice were randomly distributed into 2 groups , the saline control group and the morphine group injected on the first day with 17 mg / kg morphine ( to complete the dose up to 20 mg / kg ) or saline , and on the 6 following days with 20 mg / kg morphine .
the last day ( d8 ) , before morphine injection , nociceptive thresholds were determined in order to measure morphine hyperalgesia and then , mice received a morphine dose ( 3 mg / kg ) to evaluate morphine analgesic tolerance .
in the second protocol ( see supplementary fig. s2 ) , mice received 60 mg / kg repeated morphine once a day during 4 days .
the overall design of the 2 protocols is similar , with morphine injections at 3 mg / kg on d1 and d8 or d5 to measure analgesic tolerance , respectively .
in both protocols , nociceptive thresholds were scored on d5 or d8 , before last morphine dose , to evaluate morphine - induced hyperalgesia .
morphine acute effects ( analgesia and analgesic tolerance ) were measured 45 min after 3 mg / kg morphine administration , and hyperalgesia was measured 20 - 22 hours following daily morphine ( 20 or 60 mg / kg ) .
at the end of both repeated morphine treatments , mice were tested with tail immersion test (+ d4 , + d7 , + d11 , and + d15 post - treatment ) to measure the persistence of hyperalgesia ( fig. 2a ) .
in both protocols , basal nociceptive levels were recovered at + d15 post morphine cessation .
the third protocol was assayed on neuropathic mice ( fig. 4 ) .
neuropathic pain was induced by partial ligation of the left common sciatic nerve ( psnl ) by 7 - 0 braid silk suture under ketamine / zylazine anesthesia ( 100 / 10 mg / kg mixture ; ketamine , virbac , carros , france ; xylazine , rompun , bayer healthcare , puteaux , france ) according to the method described previously69 .
nociceptive reactions at baseline and on day 14 post - psnl were scored as described above. from day 15 , the mice were then administered 20 mg / kg morphine or the saline control solution for 7 consecutive days .
cold , heat and mechanical sensitivities were scored the next morning following the last morphine dose ( d8 ) for oih assessment .
for the analysis of morphine metabolism , mice were injected ip with 10 mg / kg morphine or 100 mul saline control solution , and tissues collected 2 hr later .
morphine - 3 - beta - d - glucuronide ( m3g ; sigma aldrich , st louis , usa ) at 5 mg / kg in saline or a saline control solution were injected ip in naive mice .
hypersensitivity induced by m3g was measured by using the von frey test ( 0.5 , 2 and 24 hr post - injection ) and the tail immersion test ( 48 degreesc ; 1 , 3 and 24 hr post - injection ) , respectively as described above .
animals were allocated to experimental groups according to gender ( male or female ) and genotype .
littermates of the same sex were randomly assigned to the experimental groups .
the number of animals per group was designed in accordance with previous similar studies21 , 70 .
the results shown were obtained from 2 - 4 cohorts / group / experiment .

after 3 min of 1 % of buffer b , a linear gradient of 1 - 60 % of solvent b was applied over 8 min and followed by a washing step ( 1 min at 99 % of solvent b ) and an equilibration step ( 1 min of 1 % of buffer b ) .
qualitative analysis and quantification were performed in srm .
for ionization , 3500 v of liquid junction voltage and 342 degreesc capillary temperature were applied .
the selectivity for both q1 and q3 was set to 0.7 da ( fwhm ) .
the collision gas pressure of q2 was set at 2 mtorr of argon .
for morphine and m3g , the selection of the monitored transitions and the optimization of the collision energy were manually determined .
the transitions and the corresponding collision energies ( ce ) used were the following : m / z 286.2 - - > m / z 147.0 ( ce = 57 ev ) , m / z 286.2 - - > m / z 173.1 ( ce = 46 ev ) , m / z 286.2 - - > m / z 201.1 ( ce = 38 ev ) for morphine ; m / z 462.2 - - > m / z 286.2 ( ce = 49 ev ) for m3g .

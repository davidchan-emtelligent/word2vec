spondylolisthesis is one of the most common indications for spinal surgery .
however , no one approach has been proven to be more effective in treating spondylolisthesis .
recent advances in minimally invasive spine technology have allowed for different approaches to be applied to this indication , notably extreme lateral interbody fusion ( xlif ) .
the risk , however , of using xlif in treating grade ii spondylolisthesis is the ventral position of the lumbar plexus , particularly at l4 - 5. objective .
this study reports the safety and midterm clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients with grade ii lumbar spondylolisthesis treated with xlif. methods .
63 patients with grade ii spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis were treated with xlif and were available for 12 - month followup. of those , 61 ( 97 %) were treated at l4 - 5 .
clinical ( vas , complications , and reoperation rate ) and radiographic ( anterolisthesis , disk height , and fusion ) parameters were assessed .

there were no neural injuries and no nonunions noted. conclusions .
xlif is a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment alternative for grade ii spondylolisthesis .
real - time neurological monitoring and attention to technique are mandatory .
1. introduction spondylolisthesis remains one of the most common indications for surgery on the spine .
the efficacy of surgical treatment for this condition has been repeatedly confirmed [ 1 ] , most notably in the spine patient outcomes research trial ( sport ) study [ 2 - 4 ] and as such , fusion is frequently recommended for patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis [ 5 , 6 ] .
while the long - term benefits of surgical treatment over nonoperative care for this indication have been shown , only recently has the cost - effectiveness of this procedure been proven in high - level data [ 7 ] .
recent reports have discussed and compared a variety of fusion procedures , including anterior lumbar interbody fusion ( alif ) , posterior lumbar interbody fusion ( plif ) , [ 8 ] transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion ( tlif ) [ 9 ] , and minimally invasive ( mis ) tlif and mis alif [ 10 ] .
despite a great deal of investigation , no approach has proven more effective than the others , and no universal treatment guideline can be proposed [ 5 ] .
recent advances in mis technology are now being applied to spinal pathologies .
one of these techniques , extreme lateral interbody fusion ( xlif ) has been suggested as a safe , minimally invasive alternative to traditional open fusion procedures .
the technique has previously been described in detail figure 1 [ 11 ] and several reports with long - term outcomes and large - series samples are emerging , showing the efficacy of the approach with fewer morbidities than conventional approaches [ 12 - 18 ] .
xlif has been recommended for spondylolisthesis up to grade 2 [ 11 , 13 ] but the concerns about neural complications associated with the lateral approaches to the spine [ 19 - 21 ] beg the question of safety .
these concerns are most pronounced at the l4 - 5 level , where the lumbar plexus is most ventral anatomically [ 8 , 22 - 27 ] .
significant anterolisthesis at this level only exacerbates the risk .
to our knowledge , no reports have specifically addressed the treatment of grade 2 spondylolisthesis at l4 - 5 with xlif .
herein , we report on our early and intermediate term results in applying this technique to what is arguably its " worst case scenario . "
2. methods 2.1 .
patient population sixty - three patients ( 10 men and 53 women ; mean age 64.5 years ) available for 12 - month followup after undergoing xlif for grade 2 spondylolisthesis were treated with xlif at a single institution between november 2006 and march 2011 .
in all cases supplemental posterior instrumentation was applied .
no posterior direct decompression was performed , relying solely on the indirect decompression achieved through disk height restoration and reduction of slip .
demographics , diagnosis , previous surgery , body mass index ( bmi ) , and preexisting comorbidities were recorded .
under saint mary 's health center institutional review board ( irb ) approval , clinical and radiographic outcomes were prospectively collected and evaluated at pre - op , post - op , 3 months , 6 months , and 12 months followup .
2.2 .
radiographic evaluation standing anteroposterior ( ap ) , static lateral , and flexion - extension lateral radiographs were obtained preoperatively and at two weeks , three months , six months , and twelve months after surgery .
measurements of disk height ( mm ) and anterolisthesis ( mm ) were taken .
spinal stenosis was confirmed by preoperative ct or mr imaging .
radiographic analysis was performed by a physician other than the operating surgeon .
fusion was defined as the presence of bridging bone across the disk space ( modified lenke grade 1 or 2 ) [ 28 ] and the absence of significant motion (< 5 degrees , < 2 mm interspinous widening ) on dynamic radiographs .
2.3 .
clinical evaluation visual analog scale ( vas ) pain measurements were obtained at each time point through the completion of patient outcomes questionnaires administered by the research staff .
intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded by the evaluating physician .
at twelve months postoperatively , patients were asked to complete an additional questionnaire assessing the presence of new back or leg pain ( pain not present prior to surgery ) , their degree of satisfaction with the result , and their willingness to have the procedure again .
2.4 .
xlif surgical technique extreme lateral interbody fusion , or xlif , is a 90degrees off midline or true lateral approach that allows for large graft placement and excellent disk height restoration and provides indirect decompression at the stenotic motion segment .
this approach can be performed using two 3 cm to 4 cm skin incisions .
safe passage to the retroperitoneal space is assured by gentle blunt dissection .
as the psoas muscle is traversed , the lumbosacral plexus is protected by the use of automated electrophysiology .
exposure is achieved with an expandable three - bladed retractor , which allows for direct illuminated visualization facilitating diskectomy and complete anterior column stabilization using a large load - bearing implant .
in patients with significant listhetic deformity , the adherence to procedural technique , including careful patient positioning , gentle retroperitoneal dissection , and meticulous psoas traverse using advanced neurological monitoring before performing a complete discectomy and placing a properly size interbody spacer is essential [ 13 ] where neural structures are pulled ventrally by the slipping l4 vertebral body ( figure 2 ) .
it is impossible to overemphasize the importance of reliable , timely monitoring of the neural elements as the surgeon traverses the psoas muscle .
visual identification of the lumbar plexus is not possible but the plexus can be protected by using an automated real - time electrophysiology technology ( figure 3 ) .
3. results the demographic , diagnosis , and comorbidity data for the total cohort are summarized in table 1 .
for all patients , hospital stay averaged 1.2 days and hemoglobin decreased 1.4 g on average .
there were two ( 3.4 %) complications in the total cohort , one patient experiencing postoperative ileus , the second having a broken pedicle screw on radiographs obtained after a motor vehicle accident 14 months after surgery .
ct imaging showed a solid fusion and the patient was asymptomatic .
there were no infections .
although early postoperative transient upper thigh pain and hip flexion weakness were common , as expected consequences to operative trauma to the psoas muscle , these symptoms were not persistent .
there were no neurologic deficits .
two ( 3.4 %) patients of the total cohort underwent further surgery within one year : both for adjacent segment disease , one treated with plf , the other with xlif .
grade ii spondylolistheses were most commonly present at l4 - 5 ( 97 %) , though in a single level each , l2 - 3 , and l3 - 4 were indicated .
a total of 80 levels ( 1.3 per patient ) were treated ( 63 for grade ii spondylolisthesis ) .
one - , two - , and three - level procedures were performed in 78 % , 18 % , and 5 % of cases , respectively .
biologic materials varied , but most included demineralized bone matrix ( 87 %) .
transpedicular fixation was used in all but one instance of grade ii spondylolisthesis , where transpedicular facet fixation was used .
treatment variables are included in table 2 .
clinical and radiographic outcomes are shown in table 3 .
at 12 months , there was no radiographic instability noted on dynamic radiographs and all patients appeared to have bridging bone across the interbody space ( figures 4 ( a ) and 4 ( b )) .
eight patients underwent ct imaging .
all were judged to be fused by an independent radiologist ( figure 5 ) .
neither radiographic ( slip ) nor vas improvement and maintenance at last followup were influenced by age , bmi / obesity , preexisting comorbidities , prior surgery , levels treated , or unilateral versus bilateral fixation ( p > 0.05 ) .
patient satisfaction and willingness to have undergone the procedure again were , however , dependent on slip improvement ( p = 0.011 and p = 0.008 , resp. ) .
a summary of slip and vas findings by demographic and treatment variables is included in table 4 .
although average correction was well maintained , 6.4 % of patients had lost more than 3 mm of listhetic correction and 6.4 % had lost more than 3 mm of disk height .
at last followup , 89.3 % rated themselves as " satisfied " or " very satisfied " with their results and 92.9 % stated that they would choose to have the procedure again .
4. discussion the purpose of this study was to examine the safety and efficacy of xlif in the treatment of grade 2 spondylolisthesis .
the use of xlif to treat degenerative conditions has been documented , as has the procedure 's reduced complication rate when compared to traditional open approaches , either anterior [ 29 ] or posterior [ 30 , 31 ] .
analysis of our results shows excellent reduction in listhetic deformity and improvement of disk height with maintenance of these radiographic outcomes over time .
progression toward fusion appears to be routine .
likewise , clinical outcomes denote marked improvement in vas with persistent improvement at one year .
patient satisfaction with the procedure approaches 90 % in most studies , a finding confirmed by our results .
these clinical measures attest to the resolution of stenotic symptoms through the indirect decompression and stabilization achieved .
however , the concerns regarding the safety of lateral transpsoas approaches to the lumbar spine remain .
in a frequently cited study , [ 19 ] the authors reported a 27 % incidence of groin numbness ( but no motor deficits ) using an endoscopic transpsoas approach without neurologic monitoring .
it should be noted that this study has been mistakenly referenced [ 19 ] as a description of the xlif approach , which is minimally invasive but not endoscopic and mandates the use of real - time neurologic monitoring .
another study [ 21 ] noted two l4 nerve root injuries ( 3.4 %) in a series of 58 lateral fusion cases ( and a 22.4 % complication rate ) .
this paper reported cases using both xlif and direct lateral interbody fusion ( dlif ) without delineating the number of each type of procedure or distinguishing the complications by procedure .
since the recommended technique is somewhat different in the two procedures and the duration of hospitalization was so prolonged ( xlif : 6 days ; dlif : 4 days ) , one might argue that this study was a learning curve comparison and should not be cited as definitive .
in the largest published series to date , 600 patients treated with xlif experienced a length of hospitalization averaging 1.21 days and a 6.2 % complication rate ( rate of transient motor deficit - - 0.7 %) [ 18 ] .
nonetheless , neurologic deficits associated with lateral approaches are an area of great discussion .
as has been documented anatomically and radiographically , the lumbar plexus migrates ventrally as one descends caudally from l2 - 3 to l4 - 5 [ 8 , 22 - 27 ] .
this places the plexus at greatest risk in a transpsoas approach at the l4 - 5 level .
in addition , anterolisthesis of the superior vertebral body carries the plexus even more ventral , heightening safety concerns .
however , as shown by our data , in the presence of real - time neurologic monitoring and with attention to the details of the technique mentioned above , grade 2 listhetic segments , especially at l4 - 5 , can be treated successfully without neurologic injury .
the importance of monitoring and technique cannot be overemphasized .
clinically , surgery for spondylolisthesis has been shown to yield better patient outcomes than nonoperative treatment in large randomized trials [ 2 - 4 ] .
multiple techniques have been employed - - decompression alone , [ 32 ] plf , [ 6 ] instrumented plf [ 33 ] plif [ 34 ] , alif [ 35 ] , tlif [ 9 ] , as well as mis alif [ 10 ] , or mis tlif [ 19 ] procedures - - without a clear consensus emerging [ 5 ] .
in addition to clinical effectiveness , recent results of a randomized controlled trial have shown that instrumented fusion for the treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis is substantially cost effective compared to conservative care [ 32 ] .
this study noted a quality - adjusted life - year ( qaly ) gain of 0.39 in the fusion cohort at a cost of $ 54,500 ( down from 0.23 qaly and $ 115,600 cost per qaly gained at two years postoperative ) per qaly gained. with the threshold for cost effectiveness in the united states at $ 100,000 per qaly gained , [ 36 , 37 ] this proves that in the treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis , instrumented lumbar fusion is solidly cost effective compared to conservative care at four - years postoperative .
however , no breakdown of the 344 fusion surgeries ( 269 with instrumentation ) by type of procedure was provided but , based on the timeframe of the study , it may be inferred that the vast majority of those fusions were performed using traditional open techniques .
as we have shown in this study , the complications associated with mis xlif fusion for spondylolisthesis are notably less than the complications reported with traditional open approaches .
furthermore , open spinal fusions have been reported to have much longer hospitalizations ( alif : 3.9 days [ 28 ] , plif : 9.7 days [ 29 ] , or tlif : 5.5 days [ 38 ]) than the 1.2 days we report herein .
a recent study , compared the operating costs for a hospital performing xlif and open plif in the treatment of two - level degenerative spinal conditions showed a decrease in operating costs by 9.6 % ( including the higher price for xlif implants ) with a 1.2 compared with 3.2 day hospital stay ( resp. ) with significantly fewer transfusions and residual events [ 39 ] .
a similar study of open and miniopen posterior found significantly lower hospital charges , complications , length of stay , and transfer to inpatient rehabilitation using minimally invasive posterior lumbar interbody fusion ( plif ) compared with open plif [ 40 ] .
it stands to reason that modern surgical fusion options - - utilizing direct visualization , miniopen approaches - - would be expected to yield a markedly decreased dollar cost per qaly gained because these mis techniques require shorter hospital stays and result in fewer expensive complications .
5. conclusion xlif is safe and effective for the treatment of grade 2 spondylolisthesis at l4 - 5 .
the use of this technique results in marked clinical and radiographic improvement which is maintained over time .
the use of real - time neurologic monitoring and careful attention to technique are mandatory .

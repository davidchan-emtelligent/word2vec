background clinical decision rules help to avoid potentially unnecessary radiographs of the wrist , reduce waiting times and save costs .
objective the primary aim of this study was to provide an overview of all existing non - validated clinical decision rules for wrist trauma in children and to externally validate these rules in a different cohort of patients .
secondarily , we aimed to compare the performance of these rules with the validated amsterdam pediatric wrist rules .
materials and methods we included all studies that proposed a clinical prediction or decision rule in children presenting at the emergency department with acute wrist trauma .
we performed external validation within a cohort of 379 children .
we also calculated the sensitivity , specificity , negative predictive value and positive predictive value of each decision rule .
results we included three clinical decision rules .
the sensitivity and specificity of all clinical decision rules after external validation were between 94 % and 99 % , and 11 % and 26 % , respectively .
after external validation 7 % to 17 % less radiographs would be ordered and 1.4 % to 5.7 % of all fractures would be missed .
compared to the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules only one of the three other rules had a higher sensitivity ; however both the specificity and the reduction in requested radiographs were lower in the other three rules .
conclusion the sensitivity of the three non - validated clinical decision rules is high .
however the specificity and the reduction in number of requested radiographs are low .
in contrast , the validated amsterdam pediatric wrist rules has an acceptable sensitivity and the greatest reduction in radiographs , at 22 % , without missing any clinically relevant fractures .
keywords adolescent child decision rule distal radius fracture trauma wrist academic medical center ( amc ) issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer - verlag berlin heidelberg 2017 introduction in children , distal radius fractures comprise 25 - 36 % of all fractures [ 1 , 2 ] and are therefore the most common fractures in children [ 3 ] .
this high prevalence is most likely a result of the relative weakness of the metaphyseal bone , which has not yet modelled in children [ 4 ] .
for reasons not clarified , the incidence of distal forearm fractures has shown a significant increase over the last few decades , from 151 in sweden and 309 in the usa per 100,000 person - years to respectively 240 and 409 per 100,000 person - years [ 1 , 5 ] .
this is accompanied by an increasing number of emergency department visits and requested radiographs , and consequently rising health care costs [ 1 , 6 , 7 ] .
the decision whether to request a radiograph of the wrist can be difficult for physicians [ 8 ] .
slaar et al .
[ 9 ] showed that 51 % of 1,233 children with a trauma of the wrist who presented at the emergency department of three dutch hospitals had sustained a wrist fracture .
the remaining 49 % of the radiographs did not reveal a fracture of the wrist and were potentially unnecessary [ 9 ] .
the introduction of a clinical decision rule could help to avoid unnecessary radiographs of the wrist and therefore decrease costs and waiting times [ 10 ] .
for ankle injuries , the ottawa ankle rules was successfully introduced in 1992 , showing a 7.2 % to 16 % reduction in radiographs of the ankle in children since validation [ 11 , 12 ] .
moreover , this rule has shown a 36 - min decrease in length of the emergency department visit in adults [ 13 ] , along with cost savings of $ 614,226 to $ 3,145,910 usd per 100,000 patients [ 14 ] .
the development of a clinical decision rule consists of three steps : ( 1 ) derivation of the rule ; ( 2 ) ( external ) validation and ( 3 ) implementation of the rule in clinical practice to test its impact on the decision - making of physicians [ 15 ] .
the second step , validation , is most reliable when it is performed external , in a different population and performed by a different research group than the group who developed the rule [ 16 - 18 ] .
several attempts have been made to generate a clinical decision rule for children with acute wrist trauma in an effort to support physicians in making a more validated decision on whether a wrist radiograph should be acquired .
one of these decision rules is the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules [ 19 ] .
the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules is a clinical decision rule that aids in determining the need for a radiograph of the wrist in children , based on age and variables visible deformation , swelling of the distal radius , bone tenderness of the distal radius and the anatomical snuff box , and painful supination .
up till now this is the only rule that has been externally validated , with a sensitivity of 95.9 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] : 91.7 - 98.0 %) and a specificity of 37.3 % ( 95 % ci : 31.0 - 44.1 %) .
the primary aim of this study was to provide an overview of all existing non - validated decision rules for wrist trauma in children and to externally validate these rules in a different cohort of patients .
secondarily , we aimed to compare the performance of these rules with the validated amsterdam pediatric wrist rules .
materials and methods selection of existing clinical decision rules for children with wrist trauma we performed a systematic literature search in medline ( pubmed ) on dec .
21 , 2015 , using the search strategy depicted in table 1 .
this systematic search was conducted according to the moose ( meta - analysis of observational studies in epidemiology ) guidelines [ 20 ] .
we restricted the languages to english and dutch .
we included all types of studies that proposed a clinical prediction rule or decision rule in children presenting at the emergency department with acute wrist trauma .
after screening the title and abstract , we studied full - text articles as to whether the eligible criteria were met .
finally , we performed a cross - reference check .
we used the charms checklist for critical appraisal and data extraction [ 21 ] .
the charms ( checklist for critical appraisal and data extraction for systemic reviews of predication modelling studies ) checklist has been designed for data extraction and quality assessment for systematic reviews of decision rules .
this checklist contains 11 parameters that could lead to bias or that affect the applicability of the results .
two independent authors conducted the data extraction , addressing disagreement with discussion and consensus .
table 1 search strategy search items found ((" wrist injuries "[ mesh ] or " arm injuries "[ mesh ] or wrist injur *[ tiab ] or wrist trauma *[ tiab ] or wrist [ tiab ] or forearm [ tiab ]) and (" child "[ mesh ] or " adolescent "[ mesh ] or " pediatrics "[ mesh ] or pediatr *[ tiab ] or paediatr *[ tiab ] or child *[ tiab ] or minor [ tiab ] or minors [ tiab ] or adolescen *[ tiab ] or teen *[ tiab ]) and (" decision support techniques "[ mesh ] or ( decision *[ tiab ] and ( rule *[ tiab ] or aid *[ tiab ] or support *[ tiab ])) or clinical decision *[ tiab ] or clinical prediction *[ tiab ])) filters : english ; dutch 67 validation cohort for external validation we used a study population previously described in the development and external validation study of the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules [ 19 ] .
the study included a total of 379 children between 3 years and 18 years old , presenting with 170 wrist fractures and 209 non - fractures between april 6 , 2011 , and april 15 , 2014 , at the emergency department of three non - university teaching hospitals in the netherlands .
all consecutive children between 3 years and 18 years old were included if they had pain or tenderness secondary to acute wrist trauma .
acute trauma was defined as wrist trauma sustained within 72 h before presentation at the emergency department [ 19 ] .
using a standardised case record form , the data collected comprised 18 variables including patient characteristics , physical examination , functional testing and grip strength measured with a baseline hydraulic hand dynamometer ( fabrications enterprises incorporated , white plains , new york , usa ) ( table 2 ) .
all included patients were physically examined before the radiographs were taken .
a fracture of the wrist was defined as fracture or epiphysiolysis of the distal radius or the distal ulna , or both [ 19 ] .
because fractures of the carpal bones in children are rare and frequently occult on plain radiographs , these fractures were not taken into account [ 2 , 22 , 23 ] .
a fracture was recorded if a disruption of one or more cortices of the bone were present .
buckle fractures of bowing fractures were also defined as a true fractures , as were fissures and avulsions .

among such events , a missing value level of less than 5 % is considered as an acceptable value to use complete case analysis [ 25 ] .
missing completely at random ( mcar ) may be used if the missing data are a random sample of the original dataset [ 26 ] .
during our validation , we used complete case analysis for each decision rule if data were missing completely at random .
to determine this , we performed a little 's mcar test .
if this test was not statistically significant , the data were missing completely at random and complete case analysis could be performed .
we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of each decision rule , as well as the negative and positive predictive values and the 95 % confidence intervals .
additionally , we determined the reduction in radiographs requested and the missed fractures rates .
we analysed data using spss version 22.0 ( ibm , armonk , ny ) .
results study selection the search yielded 67 articles .
after title and abstract screening and full - text reading , four articles met all our inclusion criteria ( fig. 1 ) .
one of these studies was the previously validated amsterdam pediatric wrist rules study [ 19 ] .
this resulted in three other decision rules for children with wrist trauma. fig. 1 study selection study characteristics and results the first study we included was a prospective blinded case series by pershad et al .
[ 27 ] .
this study included a total of 48 patients ages 3 - 18 years who sustained acute wrist injury within the preceding 3 days .
this study excluded children with gross deformity at presentation at the emergency department because they were extremely likely to have a fracture .
in addition to the standard evaluation after injury , physical examination consisted of measurement of range of motion with a goniometer and measurement of the grip strength with a martin vigorimeter ( elmed inc. , addison , il ) .
moreover , in each child the zone ( distal radius , distal ulna , carpal bones and scaphoid ) of maximal tenderness was recorded .
a radiograph was obtained in all children after the initial clinical examination .
the wilk log likelihood ratio test was used for the selection of predictors for multivariable modelling [ 27 ] .
zone tenderness ( p = 0.005 ) , functional grip strength compared to the uninjured hand ( p = 0.019 ) and the overall suspicion of a fracture judged by the investigator prior to the radiograph ( p = 0.0083 ) were all statistically significant predictors .
however the authors included only zone tenderness and functional grip strength in their decision rule ( table 3 ) [ 27 ] .
the sensitivity of this clinical decision rule in the study cohort was 79 % and the specificity was 63 % [ 27 ] .
the negative and positive predictive values were respectively 75 % and 68 % [ 27 ] .
the second study was a prospective cohort study of webster et al .
[ 28 ] .
this study included a total of 227 children ages 3 - 16 years who presented within 72 h after blunt wrist trauma .
exclusion criteria were patients with gross deformity because of their high likelihood of having sustained a fracture , as well as altered mental status , bone disease and an open fracture .
physical examination included focal swelling ; grip strength ; zone tenderness ; and the range of motion of supination , pronation , dorsiflexion and palmar flexion [ 28 ] .
to determine zone tenderness , the same zones were used as by pershad et al .
[ 27 ] .
additionally , the time between injury and presentation to the emergency department ( more or less than 6 h ) was taken into account [ 28 ] .
the decision to request a radiograph of the wrist was at the discretion of the treating physician .
all the outcome variables were analysed with the pearson chi - square test .
subsequently , all variables with p < 0.2 were included in a multivariate logistic regression model [ 28 ] .
univariate analysis showed that 6 of the 10 clinical predictors were significantly associated with a fracture ( at a significance level of p < 0.2 ) .
in the multivariate analysis , only radial tenderness ( p < 0.01 ) , reduced supination or pronation ( p < 0.05 ) and focal swelling ( p < 0.001 ) were significantly and independently associated with a fracture ( table 3 ) [ 28 ] .
this rule had a sensitivity of 99.1 % ( 95 % ci : 94.8 - 100 %) and a specificity of 24 % ( 95 % ci : 17.2 - 32.3 %) when applied in the study 's own cohort [ 28 ] .
the third study was a retrospective study by rivara et al .
[ 29 ] .
this study included a total of 189 children younger than 16 years with an injury that occurred within 7 days prior to the emergency department visit .
for each injury , data collected included bone deformity or bone instability , crepitance , pain or limited range of motion , swelling , point tenderness , decreased sensation and ecchymosis .
in addition , age , race , sex , time of day and cause and mechanism of injury were recorded .
the majority of physicians requested the radiograph before completing the data collection form .
however there was no evidence that the timing of completing the data collection form influenced the findings [ 29 ] .
before entering variables in a linear discriminant model , odds ratios were calculated for each predictor ( entered if p <= 0.05 ) .
when it was impossible to estimate the relative discriminating power with an odds ratio , because all patients with this symptom had a fracture , a stepwise multivariable discriminant analysis was performed .
gross deformity and point tenderness showed the highest odds ratios , of respectively 16.1 ( 95 % ci : 4.7 to 54.9 ) and 7.0 ( 95 % ci : 3.2 to 15.6 ) and were consequently the best discriminators between the fracture and the non - fracture group ( table 3 ) .
the presence of ecchymosis was also a significant discriminator .
however the presence of ecchymosis was not retained in the decision rule because , in the absence of point tenderness and gross deformity , it did not differ between the fracture and no - fracture groups indicated by the odds ratio [ 29 ] .
this rule of rivara et al .
[ 29 ] showed a sensitivity and specificity of respectively 81 % and 82 % and negative predictive value of 75 % in their own study cohort .
table 3 decision rules pershad et al .
[ 27 ] perform radiograph if both clinical findings are present : 1 .
point tenderness over the distal radius 2 .
decrease of more than 20 % in grip strength compared to the normal hand webster et al .
[ 28 ] perform radiograph if at least one of the following clinical findings is present : 1 .
radial tenderness 2 .
focal swelling 3 .
reduction in range of supination and pronation rivara et al .
[ 29 ] perform radiograph if at least one of the following clinical findings is present : 1 .
gross deformity 2 .
point tenderness methodological quality of the studies all three studies were single - centre studies .
none of the studies clarified how missing data were handled .
only rivara et al .
[ 29 ] reported the number of missing data for each predictor .
both pershad et al .
[ 27 ] and webster et al .
[ 28 ] conducted a decision rule for the wrist only , whereas rivara et al. made one for the whole upper extremity .
additionally , in the study of rivara et al. not all physicians requested the radiograph after completing the data collection form .
although there was no difference in predictors of positive or negative radiograph findings between data collection forms that were finished after requesting a radiograph and those finished before requesting a radiograph , this could have led to inclusion bias .
last , except for webster et al .
[ 28 ] , none of the studies mentioned a 95 % confidence interval of the sensitivity or specificity , nor the discrimination and calibration curves .

if symptoms were persistent or full functional recovery was not obtained , patients were called back to the ed for reevaluation .
patients who did not have a radiograph were asked to return within 5 days if they still had significant symptoms .

model development wilks' log likelihood ratio test was used for detecting associations between the presence of fracture and most predictors .
student 's t - test was used to detect mean value differences in rom measurements and grip strength .
univariate variables were analysed with the x2 test .
all variables associated with outcome ( p,0.2 ) were entered into a multivariate model ( logistic regression ) to determine which were independently associated with the outcome .
first odds ratios were determined and after that a linear discriminant model was used for selection of predictors during modelling .

the low discriminatory value of the rule means that the potential for a clinical decision rule for paediatric wrist trauma appears limited .
the predictive value is low , but could help in the decision making and could lower health care costs .
external validation pershad et al .
[ 27 ] we evaluated the external performance of the clinical decision rule of pershad et al .
[ 27 ] in a cohort of 326 of our 379 subjects .
we excluded a total of 53 patients : 28 patients because of the presence of gross deformity and 25 patients after complete case analysis ( little 's mcar test ; p = 0.337 ) .
the sensitivity and specificity after external validation were respectively 94 % ( 95 % ci : 89 - 97 %) and 26 % ( 95 % ci : 20 - 33 %) .
the negative predictive value was 86 % ( 95 % ci : 74 - 93 %) and the positive predictive value was 49 % ( 95 % ci : 43 - 55 % ; table 5 ) .
after applying this clinical decision rule to the validation cohort , 17 % less radiographs would have been requested and 5.7 % ( 8 ) of the fractures would have been missed ( table 6 ) .

after applying this clinical decision rule to the validation cohort , 7 % less radiographs would have been requested and 1.4 % ( 2 ) of fractures would have been missed ( table 6 ) .
rivara et al .
[ 29 ] we evaluated the external performance of the clinical decision rule of rivara et al .
[ 29 ] in a cohort of 352 of our 379 patients .
we excluded a total of 27 patients because they were 16 years or older .
no patients were excluded because of complete case analysis .
the sensitivity and specificity were respectively 96 % ( 95 % ci : 91 % to 98 %) and 22 % ( 95 % ci : 16 % to 28 %) .
the negative predictive value was 85 % ( 95 % ci : 72 % to 93 %) and the positive predictive value was 51 % ( 95 % ci : 46 % to 57 % ; table 5 ) .
after applying this clinical decision rule on the validation cohort , 14 % less radiographs would have been requested and 4.3 % ( 7 ) fractures would have been missed ( table 6 ) .
comparison with amsterdam pediatric wrist rules [ 19 ] the sensitivity of the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules was 96 % ( 95 % ci : 92 - 98 %) and the specificity was 37 % ( 95 % ci : 31 - 44 %) .
this specificity was higher compared to the specificity of the other three rules after external validation .
in contrast , the sensitivity was lower compared to the sensitivity of the decision rule of webster et al .
[ 28 ] and comparable with the sensitivity of rivara et al .
[ 29 ] .
however , the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules showed a 22 % reduction of radiographic examinations after external validation , which was higher than the other three decision rules .
although 4.1 % of fractures were missed , none of these was clinically relevant .
discussion we included three studies , each describing a non - validated clinical decision rule for children with wrist trauma , and externally validated these rules in the study population in which the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules was developed and externally validated .
the sensitivity of these three clinical decision rules after external validation was high , ranging from 94 % to 99 % .
however , besides a low specificity ranging 11 % to 26 % , the reduction in radiographs requested without missing any clinically relevant fractures was not of great significance .
in order for physicians to use a clinical decision rule in the emergency department , the sensitivity should be high .
stiell and wells [ 30 ] suggested a sensitivity of at least 96 % .
this would mean that only the rule of pershad et al .
[ 27 ] would not qualify .
conversely , the reduction in radiographs , without missing any clinically relevant fractures , is determinative for the accepted sensitivity .
clinicians might be more willing to use the decision rule if they knew that no fractures would be missed or that any missed fractures would not be clinically relevant .
the use of the rule by webster et al .
[ 28 ] was accompanied by only 1.4 % missed fractures , in contrast with the 5.7 % missed fractures in the rule by pershad et al .
[ 27 ] and 4.1 % in the rule rivara et al .
[ 29 ] .
however , the rule of webster et al .
[ 28 ] only had a reduction in radiograph requests of 7 % , which is not of great significance compared to current practice. of all 24 missed fractures , 46 % were buckle fractures .
buckle fractures are stable fractures and can be treated safely with a soft cast or bandage therapy with good functional outcomes [ 31 - 33 ] .
this treatment is equal to the treatment of contusions or sprains of the wrist .
because treatment and prognosis would not have been influenced by a missed or delayed diagnosis [ 34 ] , these fractures could be considered not clinically relevant .
in contrast , after external validation of the other three decision rules , five epiphysiolysis injuries of the distal radius , four extra - articular distal radius fractures and three greenstick fractures were missed .
for these missed fractures the clinical impact is considerable and treatment is necessary .
after applying the ottawa ankle rules in children , a pooled reduction of radiographs of approximately 24.8 % was observed [ 35 ] , which is a higher reduction of radiographs than what we found when validating the decision rules for wrist trauma , except for the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules .
this is possibly a result of the very low a priori probability for a fracture in ankle injuries of 14 % , compared to 53 % for wrist trauma [ 36 , 37 ] .
the higher probability limits the possibilities for improvement .
this was confirmed by van den brand et al .
[ 36 ] , who investigated the need for a clinical decision rule for patients with blunt wrist trauma .
they confirmed the high wrist fracture ratio and recommended radiographs in all patients with wrist trauma presenting at the emergency department .
additionally , they concluded that it is not feasible to develop a decision rule with a high sensitivity and specificity .
despite their conclusion , two fractures in children were missed without even using a clinical decision rule [ 36 ] .
in contrast , slaar et al .
[ 9 ] stated that the development of a clinical decision rule for children with blunt wrist trauma is warranted [ 9 ] .
although the costs per radiograph are relatively low , the overall cost of negative radiographs in the three hospitals was approximately euro28,608 ( u.s. $ 30,000 ) per year [ 9 ] .
a reduction in radiographs could therefore result in cost savings .
furthermore , a reduction in time spent at the emergency department could be realised , like that seen after implementation of the ottawa ankle rules [ 13 ] .
compared to the three decision rules that were externally validated in this study , the externally validated amsterdam pediatric wrist rules showed a 22 % reduction of radiographic examinations .
at the same time , in external validation this rule missed 4.1 % of fractures , although none of these was clinically relevant [ 19 ] .
the sensitivity of the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules was 96 % ( 95 % ci : 92 - 98 %) and the specificity was 37 % ( 95 % ci : 31 - 44 %) .
this is higher than the specificity of the other three rules after validation .
although the sensitivity of the amsterdam decision rule is lower than the sensitivity of the webster et al .
[ 28 ] decision rule , it is presumably high enough to persuade physicians to use the decision rule in the emergency department .
looking at the different assessment criteria , except for the 20 % decrease in grip strength used in the rule of pershad et al .
[ 27 ] , the three decision rules used the same variables as in the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules ( i.e. deformity , tenderness of the distal radius , and a reduction in supination ) .
however a possible reason for the better performance of the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules compared to the other three decision rules is the difference in the derivation of the rule .
the amsterdam pediatric wrist rules uses a linear predictor to calculate the probability of a fracture , whereas the other three rules use the presence or absence of clinical variables .
moreover , age is not taken into account in the three other decision rules .
this study has several limitations .
first , we used complete case analysis because only prehensile grip strength had a missing value percentage of more than 5 % , namely 12.5 % .
because of this complete case analysis , the clinical decision rule of pershad et al .
[ 27 ] , which contains the variable grip strength , was validated in a smaller cohort than the other two rules .
however , the remaining sample was sufficiently large for validation , especially when compared to the size of the derivation cohorts ( 326 compared to 48 children ) , and therefore we believe that this does not limit the validity of our results .
second , we excluded children with gross deformity during the validation of the clinical decision rules by pershad et al .
[ 27 ] and webster et al .
[ 28 ] because this was one of their exclusion criteria .
they excluded these subjects because of their very high likelihood of having a fracture .
in general only 86.4 % of the children with gross deformity in our dataset , as noted by the emergency department physicians , had a fracture .
although it seems unlikely not to have a fracture with the presence of gross deformity , this could possibly be caused by the swelling that arises after the trauma and mimics a deformity .
however , if you remove the evident cases of fractures , it becomes harder for a decision rule to identify fractures and it lowers the sensitivity .
conclusion the sensitivity of the three included clinical decision rules for wrist trauma ranges from 94 % to 99 % .
however , the specificity and the reduction in requested radiographs of these three decision rules are low , and therefore it is doubtful whether these decision rules would supplement current practice .
in contrast , the externally validated amsterdam pediatric wrist rules has been shown to have an acceptable sensitivity and a reduction in radiographs of 22 % without missing any clinically relevant fractures .

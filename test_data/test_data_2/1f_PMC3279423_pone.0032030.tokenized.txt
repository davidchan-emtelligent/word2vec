the rab11 - fips ( rab11 - family interacting proteins ; henceforth , fips ) are a family of rab11a / rab11b / rab25 gtpase effector proteins implicated in an assortment of intracellular trafficking processes. through proteomic screening , we have identified tsg101 ( tumor susceptibility gene 101 ) , a component of the escrt - i ( endosomal sorting complex required for transport ) complex , as a novel fip4 - binding protein , which we find can also bind fip3 .
we show that alpha - helical coiled - coil regions of both tsg101 and fip4 mediate the interaction with the cognate protein , and that point mutations in the coiled - coil regions of both tsg101 and fip4 abrogate the interaction .
we find that expression of tsg101 and fip4 mutants cause cytokinesis defects , but that the tsg101 - fip4 interaction is not required for localisation of tsg101 to the midbody / flemming body during abscission .
together , these data suggest functional overlap between rab11 - controlled processes and components of the escrt pathway .
introduction animal cytokinesis is a fundamental cellular process in which a dividing cell partitions its contents leading to the formation of two diploid daughter cells .
a key requirement of cytokinesis is the spatial and temporal assembly and activation of an acto - myosin contractile - ring at the equatorial cortex of the cell [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
constriction of this contractile - ring results in the formation of a circumferential depression in the plasma membrane , known as the cleavage furrow .
upon further ingression of this furrow , in a process requiring additional constriction of the contractile - ring as well as insertion of new membrane into the cleavage furrow , a membrane - bound intercellular bridge known as the midbody is formed .
cytokinesis is completed by severance of the midbody in a process known as abscission .
during the past decade , a significant amount of information has emerged which implicates disparate endosomal protein machinery in the processes of abscission ( reviewed in [ 3 ]) .
prominent among these reports are components of the escrt ( endosomal sorting complex required for transport ) complexes , as well as members of the rab gtpase family .
escrts ( escrt - 0 , escrt - i , escrt - ii and escrt - iii ) are multi - component protein complexes that are conserved from archaea to animals and are implicated in the trafficking of endosomal cargo destined for lysosomal degradation as well as multivesicular body ( mvb ) biogenesis [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
they recognise ubiquitinated receptors and facilitate their sorting into endosomal membrane invaginations by deforming the membrane during inward vesiculation of mvbs [ 6 ] .
escrts then function in the scission events that result in generation of the intraluminal vesicles ( ilvs ) within mvbs [ 6 ] .
escrts have also been implicated in further cellular processes requiring membrane scission events ; namely , the budding of enveloped viruses and closure of the intercellular bridge during cytokinetic abscission [ 7 ] - [ 10 ] .
in this respect , one of the four proteins that constitute the escrt - i complex , tsg101 ( tumor susceptibility gene 101 ) ( vps23 in yeast ) , is recruited to the flemming body during cytokinesis and is required for successful completion of abscission [ 11 ] - [ 15 ] .
the escrt - iii complex is also necessary for abscission [ 14 ] , [ 16 ] - [ 18 ] .
in humans , rab gtpases are a family of over 60 proteins that act as key regulators of all stages of intracellular membrane trafficking [ 19 ] .
they act as molecular switches by alternating between active and inactive conformations which are dependent upon the nucleotide - bound state of the rab [ 19 ] .
when gtp - bound , rab proteins are active and execute precise trafficking steps through the recruitment of downstream effector proteins [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
members of the rab11 - subfamily ( rab11a , rab11b and rab25 ) are distributed to endosomal membranes , and among their identified effectors are a conserved protein family termed the rab11 - fips ( rab11 - family interacting proteins ; henceforth , fips ) , which bind rab11 via a carboxy - terminal rab11 - binding domain ( rbd ) [ 21 ] .
the class i fips ( rcp , rip11 and fip2 ) contain c2 - domains at their amino - termini and have been implicated in the recycling of a variety of endocytic cargoes [ 21 ] .
conversely , the class ii fips have amino - terminal ef - hand motifs and fip3 has an extensive amino - terminal proline - rich region ( prr ) [ 21 ] .
fip3 , in conjunction with rab11 , is involved in endosomal - recycling processes [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] ; and fip4 plays a role in the regulation of retinal development in zebrafish ( danio rerio ) [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
additionally , both class ii fips have been implicated in the abscission step of cytokinesis [ 3 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 26 ] - [ 29 ] .
while fip4 has been implicated in retinal development and cytokinesis , it is perhaps the fip for which the least data exists in the literature .
here , we have embarked on a yeast two - hybrid proteomic screen to identify novel fip4 - binding proteins and through this , and subsequent experiments , have identified the escrt - i component tsg101 as a novel binding - partner for both of the class ii fips .
results tsg101 is a novel binding - partner for the class ii fips to identify novel fip4 - interacting proteins , full - length fip4 was used as bait to screen an adult human brain cdna library using the yeast two - hybrid system .
forty resultant clones were sequenced ; of which 18 corresponded to fip4 itself , and five corresponded to fip3 .
given that the class ii fips are known to dimerise in the yeast two - hybrid system [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , these data indicate that the screen was successful. of the remaining 17 clones , seven were determined to be tsg101 .
to determine if further members of the fip family could also bind tsg101 , we tested the ability of each of the fips to bind tsg101 in the yeast two - hybrid system .
for these experiments , l40 saccharomyces cerevisiae were co - transformed with constructs encoding tsg101 and each of the fips , and assayed for the ability of transformed yeast to grow on selective medium lacking histidine .
we found that while tsg101 displayed no binding to the class i fips , it interacted with both fip3 and fip4 ( figure 1a ) .
biochemical experiments in hela cells confirmed this result as xpress - fused fip3 and fip4 could co - immunoprecipitate gfp - fused tsg101 ( figure 1b ) .
next , we examined the distribution of the class ii fips with respect to that of tsg101 in hela cells by confocal microscopy .
previous studies have demonstrated that exogenously - expressed class ii fips predominantly localise to the rab11 - positive endosomal - recycling compartment ( erc ) , and that their overexpression compacts this compartment , as well as many class ii fip - binding proteins , into a pericentrosomal location [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 32 ] .
in interphase hela cells , we found that when xpress - fip3 or fip4 were co - expressed with gfp - tsg101 , the fip proteins were predominantly present in the perinuclear region of the cell , while the tsg101 was found in punctate structures dispersed throughout the cell ( figure 1c ) .
the degree of co - localisation observed between the class ii fips and tsg101 varied widely between cells ; approximately 37 % of cells co - expressing xpress - fip3 and gfp - tsg101 and 32 % of cells co - expressing xpress - fip4 and gfp - tsg101 displayed little or no co - localisation ; approximately 46 % ( fip3 / tsg101 ) and 47 % ( fip4 / tsg101 ) had limited , albeit some , co - localisation ; and approximately 17 % ( fip3 / tsg101 ) and 21 % ( fip4 / tsg101 ) displayed strong co - localisation which was usually most evident in cells expressing relatively high levels of both proteins ( figure 1c ; arrow in lower panel ) .
as the class ii fips and tsg101 have previously been implicated in cytokinesis , we also examined the distribution of the class ii fips with respect to tsg101 in cells undergoing the terminal stages of cell division .
consistent with previous studies [ 26 ] - [ 29 ] , [ 33 ] , we found that during cytokinesis , the class ii fips localised within the midbody , the membrane - bounded intercellular canal between the dividing cell ( figure 1d ) .
as expected [ 11 ] , [ 13 ] , gfp - tsg101 was also found within the midbody , but unlike the class ii fips , it was predominantly present on the flemming body , the electron - dense centre of the midbody ( also known as the midbody - ring ) ( figure 1d ) .
while both sets of proteins were present within the midbody in cells undergoing abscission / cytokinesis , little co - localisation was observed between either of the class ii fips and tsg101 ( figure 1d , insets ) .

alpha - helical coiled - coil regions in both tsg101 and fip4 mediate the interaction between the two proteins to further explore the significance of the class ii fip - tsg101 associations , we concentrated our efforts on the tsg101 / fip4 interaction .
in order to generate tsg101 and fip4 mutants that should act as dominant - negative mutants with respect to the cognate protein , we mapped the regions of the tsg101 and fip4 proteins that mediate this interaction .
for this work , an extensive range of tsg101 and fip4 truncation mutants were generated , and their ability to bind the cognate protein tested in the yeast two - hybrid system ( figure 2 and figure 3 ) .
we narrowed down the minimal fip4 - binding region of tsg101 to amino acid residues 235 - 313 , which corresponds to the alpha - helical coiled - coil domain present in tsg101 ( figure 2 ) .
further truncation of this alpha - helical coiled - coil domain disrupted the interaction ( figure 2 ) .
similarly , we found that an alpha - helical coiled - coil region of fip4 , amino acids 364 - 519 , mediated the interaction with tsg101 , and that further truncation of this region also blocked the interaction ( figure 3 ) .
next , we sought to create full - length tsg101 and fip4 proteins that had point mutations rendering them unable to bind the cognate protein .
to this end , we utilised the paircoil algorithm [ 34 ] to predict the effect of a proline substitution for each of the amino acids within the alpha - helical coiled - coil domains of tsg101 and fip4 on the probability of alpha - helical coiled coil formation. from these predictions , three tsg101 point mutants ( k257p , v274p and n287p ) and six fip4 point mutants ( l375p , e390p , l443p , e453p , l487p and a495p ) were identified as being likely to perturb tsg101 and fip4 alpha - helical coiled - coil formation ( figure s1 and figure s2 ) .
we then tested the ability of each of these mutants to bind the cognate protein in the yeast two - hybrid system and found that two of the three tsg101 point mutants ( k257p and v274p ) abrogated the interaction with fip4 ( figure 2 ) , and two of the six fip4 point mutants ( l487p and a495p ) blocked the interaction with tsg101 ( figure 3 ) .

expression of tsg101 and fip4 dominant - negative mutants result in cytokinesis defects as tsg101 and fip4 have been previously implicated in cytokinesis [ 11 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] , we investigated the effect of expression of the aforementioned tsg101 and fip4 truncation and point mutants on the ability of cells to successfully complete cytokinesis .
in addition , as fip4 is a rab11 effector protein , we also generated a fip4 mutant that was deficient in rab11a - binding and tested its ability to prevent successful cytokinesis .
previous studies have shown that point mutations in the conserved yid / ymd motif within the rbd of the fips blocks the interaction with rab11a [ 32 ] , [ 35 ] ( also see figure s3a ) .
therefore , constructs encoding gfp - fusions of fip4 that had point mutations in this yid / ymd motif ( m618e and d619a ) were generated , and their ability to co - localise with endogenous rab11a in hela cells assessed by confocal microscopy .
we found that , relative to the wild - type protein , the fip4 m618e and d619a mutants were considerably distributed to the cytosol , and displayed reduced co - localisation with rab11a ( figure s3b ) .
nevertheless , in some cells , these mutants retained co - localisation with rab11a , indicative that they retained some , albeit likely reduced , ability to bind rab11a ( figure s3b ) .
therefore , we created a fip4 mutant in which we substituted the fip4 yid / ymd motif with three alanine residues ( ymd617 - 619aaa ) .
when we examined the cellular distribution of the full - length gfp - fip4 ymd617 - 619aaa mutant , we found that , unlike the wild - type gfp - fip4 protein which strongly co - localises with rab11a and condenses the rab11a - positive compartment into the pericentrosomal region , the ymd617 - 619aaa mutant was predominantly cytosolic and exhibited virtually no co - localisation with rab11a ( figure 4 ) .
together , these data indicate that the fip4 ymd617 - 619aaa is deficient in rab11a - binding and should serve as a dominant - negative mutant with respect to rab11a - mediated fip4 cellular function .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0032030.g004 figure 4 fip4 ymd617 - 619aaa is deficient in rab11 - binding .
hela cells were transfected with constructs encoding the indicated proteins .

scale bar indicates 10 microm .
data are typical of at least three independent experiments .
to examine the effect of expression of our tsg101 and fip4 mutants on the ability of cells to successfully complete cytokinesis , hela cells were transfected with gfp - fusions of the wild - type or mutant tsg101 or fip4 proteins for 36 - 40 hours , fixed , immunostained for alpha - tubulin and their nuclei fluorescently - labelled with dapi , and then scored for multinucleation ( two or more nuclei ) .
we found that in hela cells expressing gfp - tsg101 , approximately 29 % of cells were multinucleated , and approximately 17 % of cells expressing gfp - tsg101235 - 313 ( the fip4 - binding region ) had more than one nucleus ( compare with an approximate 6 % multinucleation rate in gfp - empty vector - expressing cells ) ( figure 5a ) .
multinucleation in gfp - tsg101 and gfp - tsg101235 - 313 - expressing cells correlated with high levels of expression of the exogenous polypeptides ( data not shown ) .
expression of the gfp - fip4 wild - type protein also caused multinucleation ( 12 %) , and expression of gfp - fip4364 - 519 ( the tsg101 - binding region ) had a more profound effect on the ability of cells to successfully complete cytokinesis , as approximately 20 % were multinucleate ( figure 5a ) .
we also found that expression of the fip3 and fip4 mutants that are deficient in rab11a - binding ( fip3 i738e and fip4 ymd617 - 619aaa ) strongly inhibited cytokinesis as approximately 25 % of cells displayed a multinucleate phenotype ; whereas expression of rcp i621e , an equivalent mutant of a class i fip , failed to result in multinucleation levels above that of controls ( figure 5a ) .
consistent with a previous study [ 28 ] , we also found that expression of the dominant - negative rab11a mutant ( rab11a s25n ) caused cytokinesis failure as 17.5 % of cells were multinucleate ( figure 5a ) .

results , from three independent experiments , are expressed as the mean percentages +/ - s.d. statistical significance was determined using an unpaired t test to investigate : ( a ) the difference between empty vector and gfp - fusion means , ( b ) the difference between gfp - tsg101 and gfp - tsg101 point mutant means and ( c ) the difference between gfp - fip4 and gfp - fip4 point mutant means .

we also examined the effects of expression of the tsg101 and fip4 proteins with the single amino acid substitutions in their alpha - helical coiled coil domain that , in some cases , disrupt the interaction with the cognate protein , on the ability of cells to successfully complete cytokinesis .
we found no significant difference in the proportion of cells displaying a multinucleation phenotype between gfp - tsg101 wild - type , gfp - tsg101 v274p ( fip4 - binding deficient mutant ) or gfp - tsg101 n287p ( fip4 - binding unaffected ) ( figure 5b ) .
in addition , we found that expression of the tsg101 - binding deficient mutants of fip4 ( l487p and a495p ) failed to result in multinucleation levels significantly above that of the gfp - fip4 wild - type protein ( figure 5c ) .
notably , expression of fip4 l375p , a fip4 mutant that retains its tsg101 - binding ability , did result in multinucleation levels above that of gfp - fip4 wild - type ( figure 5c ) .
tsg101 localises to the flemming body independently of the class ii fips previous studies have demonstrated that cep55 ( centrosome protein 55 ) , a centrosome and midbody protein involved in abscission , is required for recruitment of tsg101 to the midbody during cytokinesis [ 11 ] , [ 13 ] .
to ascertain if the class ii fips are also required for localisation of tsg101 to the midbody during cytokinesis , we investigated the ability of mcherry - tsg101 to localise to the flemming body in cells expressing class ii fip dominant - negative mutants .
we found that in hela cells co - expressing mcherry - tsg101 together with gfp - fusions of fip3 i738e , fip4 ymd617 - 619aaa or fip4364 - 519 , that localisation of the tsg101 protein to the flemming body was not impeded ( figure 6a ) .
in addition , we found that like the wild - type protein , the fip4 - binding deficient tsg101 mutant ( tsg101 v274p ) localises to the flemming body during cytokinesis ( figure 6b ) .
we also determined if interaction between tsg101 and fip4 was required for localisation of fip4 to the midbody and found that the tsg101 - binding deficient mutants of fip4 ( fip4 l487p and fip4 a495p ) were not precluded from localisation to the midbody during cytokinesis ( figure 7 ) .

discussion during the past decade , a multitude of endosomal proteins have been implicated in animal cytokinesis which underscores the crucial importance of intracellular trafficking processes in the completion of cell division [ 3 ] .
in this regard , recent evidence suggests that escrt - i and escrt - iii components are sequentially recruited to the central region of the intercellular bridge where they lead to membrane deformation , and ultimately , breakage of the midbody during abscission [ 15 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
to identify novel proteins implicated in rab11 - controlled cellular processes , we performed a proteomic screen with fip4 as bait , and have identified tsg101 as a novel fip4 - binding protein .
upon investigation of the extent of fip - tsg101 interactions , we found that tsg101 also binds fip3 , the other class ii fip .
we also found that the alpha - helical coiled - coil domains of fip4 and tsg101 are sufficient for binding of the cognate protein , and that point mutations in either of these alpha - helical coiled - coil domains blocks this interaction .
expression of gfp - fused wild - type tsg101 or fip4 were found to result in multinucleation in hela cells .
these data are consistent with previous reports implicating tsg101 and the class ii fips in cytokinesis [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 26 ] - [ 28 ] , [ 36 ] , and indicate that these proteins may form functional complexes with each other during the terminal stages of cell division .
nevertheless , when we examined the distribution of fip3 and fip4 with respect to that of tsg101 in cytokinetic cells , we failed to detect significant midbody co - localisation between either protein pair , despite the presence of each of these proteins within the midbody .
in addition , while expression of tsg101 and class ii fip truncation mutants did cause multinucleation , expression of tsg101 and fip4 point mutants deficient in binding the cognate protein , while also causing multinucleation , failed to result in multinucleation levels significantly above that of the wild - type proteins .
we also found that localisation of tsg101 to the flemming body was not impeded in cells expressing dominant - negative rab11a - binding deficient mutants of fip3 or fip4 ; and furthermore , the tsg101 v274p mutant , which cannot bind fip4 , can also localise to the flemming body .
together , these data indicate that while tsg101 and the class ii fips are clearly necessary for successful completion of cytokinesis , the class ii fips are not required for the trafficking of tsg101 to the midbody during telophase / cytokinesis and that tsg101 and the class ii fips may not form functional complexes during cytokinesis .
this raises the possibility that a functional interaction may exist between tsg101 and the class ii fips in distinct escrt - mediated cellular events .
in this regard , while it is possible that the class ii fips could play a role in cargo sorting or mvb biogenesis , to our knowledge , no data exists implicating either fip3 or fip4 in the endocytic degradative pathway .
interestingly , the escrt complexes are implicated in the budding of enveloped viruses [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , and recent reports indicate that rab11 is involved in influenza a virus budding and filament formation [ 37 ] .
fip3 was also found to be required for formation of influenza a viral filaments [ 37 ] .
furthermore , fip4 was recently found to bind the human cytomegalovirus ( hcmv ) envelope glycoprotein m ( ul100 ) , and expression of the rab11 s25n ( dominant - negative mutant ) and depletion of fip4 expression in hcmv - infected cells , led to a decrease in infectious virus production [ 38 ] .
these studies point to roles for rab11 and the class ii fips in the cellular events leading to viral envelopment which may involve class ii fip / escrt interactions .
in summary , we have identified a component of the escrt - i complex as a novel binding - partner for a subset of rab11 effectors .
the major challenge now remains to elucidate the functional links between rab11 , its effectors , and the escrt complexes ; and to determine how further rab gtpases may influence intracellular trafficking events along the escrt - pathway .
materials and methods yeast two - hybrid screen and assay the yeast two - hybrid screen with full - length fip4 as bait was screened against an adult human brain cdna library [ proquest human brain cdna library ( 11376 - 027 ) ( invitrogen )] by creative biolabs ( shirley , new york , usa ) .
for the yeast two - hybrid assay , constructs encoding the polypeptides of interest in pvjl10 ( bait ) and pgadgh ( prey ) two - hybrid vectors were co - transformed into the s. cerevisiae l40 reporter strain using the following procedure .
a ypd - agar plate was streaked with s. cerevisiae and incubated at 30degreesc until sufficient colonies had formed ( 3 - 5 days ) .
10 ml of ypd media was inoculated with a colony from the ypd - agar plate and incubated overnight at 30degreesc with rotation at 225 rpm .
the s. cerevisiae / ypd culture was diluted 1:10 with fresh ypd media and incubated for 2 hours at 30degreesc with rotation at 225 rpm ( cell density between 107 and 3.0x107 cells per ml ) .
the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 580x g , and the pellet washed with 90 ml of 0.1 m liac / te. the cells were again pelleted , resuspended in 2 ml of 0.1 m liac / te , and incubated for 1 h at 30degreesc with rotation at 225 rpm .
for each reaction , 150 microl of the yeast / liac / te solution was added to eppendorf tubes containing 2 microg of each of the bait and prey plasmids , and 40 microg of heat - denatured salmon sperm dna ( sigma ) , and the samples incubated for 10 min at 30degreesc .

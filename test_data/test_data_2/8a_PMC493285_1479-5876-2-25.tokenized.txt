the administration of granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( g - csf ) to peripheral blood progenitor cell ( pbpc ) donors causes spleen length to increase , but the duration of enlargement is not known .
eighteen healthy subjects were given 10 mug / kg of g - csf for 5 days and a pbsc concentrate was collected by apheresis .
ultrasound scans were used to assess craniocaudal spleen length before and after g - csf administration .
mean spleen length increased from a baseline length of 10.7 +/ - 1.3 cm to 12.1 +/ - 1.2 cm on the apheresis day ( p < 0.001 ) .
ten days after apheresis , spleen length fell to 10.5 +/ - 1.2 cm and did not differ from baseline levels ( p = 0.57 ) , but in 3 subjects remained 0.5 cm greater than baseline length .
increases in spleen length in pbpc donors are transient and reversible .
granulocyte colony - stimulating factor peripheral blood progenitor cells splenomegaly spleen background peripheral blood progenitor cell ( pbpc ) concentrates donors are routinely given granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( g - csf ) to increase the concentration of circulating pbpcs and hence the number of progenitors that can be collected by apheresis .
typically 10 to 16 mug / kg of g - csf are given subcutaneously daily for 4 to 6 days prior to the collection [ 1 - 3 ] .
the administration of g - csf to healthy pbpc concentrates donors is very safe , but there have been four reports of spontaneous rupture of the spleen and splenectomy in healthy allogeneic pbpc donors given g - csf [ 4 - 7 ] .
while spontaneous rupture of the spleen in pbsc donors given g - csf is rare , the administration of g - csf for five days causes spleen length to increase in almost all healthy donors [ 8,9 ] .
the increase in length is highly variable , but the mean increase is approximately 13 % .
spleen length begins to return to baseline levels quickly , but it is not known how long it takes to return to baseline .
in a previous study of 20 pbpc donors given 10 mug / kg of g - csf for 5 days , we found that spleen length measured four days after the last dose of g - csf was less than the length on the day of apheresis but greater than baseline values [ 8 ] .
since allogeneic pbpc donors may be at risk for splenic rupture while the spleen is enlarged , it is important to determine when spleen size returns to baseline levels .
the purpose of this study was to determine if spleen length returns to baseline 10 days after g - csf - mobilized pbpc concentrates are collected by apheresis from healthy subjects .
methods study design all of the subjects were in good health and were donating g - csf - mobilized pbpc concentrates for laboratory investigations .
the donors were given 10 mug / kg of g - csf ( filgrastim , amgen , thousand oaks , ca ) daily for 5 days , and a pbsc concentrate was collected approximately 2 hours after the last g - csf dose was given .
pbpc concentrates were collected with a cs3000 blood cell separator ( baxter health care corporation , round lake , il ) .
spleen length was evaluated by ultrasound examination three times : prior to the administration of the first dose of g - csf , on the day of apheresis , and 10 or 11 days after apheresis .
this study was approved by the institutional review board of the national heart , lung , and blood institute , national institutes of health , bethesda , maryland .
spleen length assessment craniocaudal spleen length was assessed using ultrasound ( acuson aspen advanced , siemens medical solutions ultrasound division , mountain view , ca ) with a sector transducer ( acuson , 4v1 , 4.0 mhz frequency , siemens medical solutions ) .
the intra - observer error for measuring spleen length using ultrasound is 4.9 mm when healthy subjects are evaluated at separate settings [ 10 ] .
blood counts and chemistries complete blood counts were performed with an automated cell counter ( cell dyne 4000 , abbott diagnostics , santa clara , ca ) .
cd34 + cell counts were performed using a flow cytometer ( beckman coulter , miami , fl ) .
statistical analysis spleen lengths measured before and after the g - csf course were compared using 2 - tailed paired t - tests .
spleen length changes were also compared among males and females and caucasians and non - caucasians using 2 - tailed t - tests .
the percent change in spleen length was compared with blood counts , cd34 + cell counts , and donor age using linear regression .
results and discussion the median age of the 18 healthy subjects was 34 years old and ranged from 22 to 55 years of age .
eight of the subjects were male , 13 of the donors were caucasian , 3 were african american , and 2 asian .
apheresis day spleen length increased above baseline length in 17 of 18 donors ( figure 1 ) .
the mean spleen length increased from a baseline level of 10.7 +/ - 1.3 cm to 12.1 +/ - 1.2 cm on the day of apheresis ( p < 0.001 ) .
the mean increase in length was 1.4 +/ - 0.8 cm or 13.1 +/ - 8.9 % .
figure 1 spleen length changes in healthy subjects donating g - csf - mobilized pbpc concentrates .
eighteen subjects were given 10 mug / kg of g - csf for 5 days and a pbpc concentrate was collected approximately 2 hours after the last dose of g - csf .
spleen length was measured by ultrasound before g - csf was given ( day 1 ) , immediately after the pbpc concentrate collection ( day 5 ) , and approximately 10 or 11 days after the collection ( day 15 or 16 ) .
spleen length was measured 10 or 11 days after apheresis in all 18 subjects .
the mean spleen length 10 days after apheresis fell to 10.5 +/ - 1.2 cm and was less than the apheresis day spleen length ( p < 0.001 ) .
there was no difference between the 10 - day post - apheresis and pre - g - csf spleen length ( p = 0.57 ) .
the spleen length 10 days after apheresis was less than the apheresis day length in all 17 donors whose spleen length increased .
however , the spleen length 10 days after apheresis remained more than 0.5 cm greater than baseline spleen length in 3 subjects ( table 1 ) .
all 3 were caucasian and 2 were female .
their spleen length remained 6.7 % , 11.0 % , and 10.5 % greater than baseline levels .
two of these subjects had relatively large increases in spleen length of 18.3 % and 26.3 % , but their spleen length fell considerably 10 days after apheresis .
it is likely that the spleen returned to baseline length in these 2 subjects shortly after the third ultrasound was preformed .
the other subject 's spleen increased only 12.0 % in length and 10 days after apheresis had changed little .
it is not certain when this subject 's spleen returned to baseline length .
table 1 peripheral blood stem cell donors whose spleen length 10 days after apheresis remained more than 0.5 cm greater than baseline length spleen length ( cm ) donor age ( yrs ) gender race baseline apheresis day 10 days post - apheresis enlargement 10 days post - apheresis 7 23 female cauc 10.4 12.3 11.1 0.7 13 22 female cauc 10.0 11.2 11.1 1.1 14 54 male cauc 9.5 12.0 10.5 1.0 cauc = caucasian pbpc donors with the largest increase in spleen size may be at the greatest risk for spontaneous splenic rupture .
in order to determine if subject age , gender , race , or post - g - csf blood counts affected the magnitude of spleen enlargement , we assessed the relationship between these factors and percent change in spleen length in the 18 subjects in this study and 20 subjects studied previously [ 14 ] .
there was no difference in the spleen length increase between males and females ( 12.3 +/ - 9.7 % versus 14.8 +/ - 8.0 % , p = 0.40 ) or between caucasians and non - caucasians ( 13.5 +/ - 8.4 % versus 13.6 +/ - 10.4 % ; p = 0.98 ) .
spleen length increase was not related to donor age ( r = 0.13 ) .
in addition , spleen length increase was not related to preapheresis cd34 + ( r = 0.04 ) , wbc ( r = 0.05 ) , neutrophil ( r = 0.07 ) , lymphocyte ( r = - 0.14 ) , monocyte ( r = - 0.04 ) , and platelet counts ( r = 0.19 ) or hemoglobin level ( r = - 0.04 ) .
conclusions healthy pbpc concentrate donors given g - csf should be warned that their spleens will be enlarged for a brief time and that they may be at risk of splenic rupture .
most donors are likely at risk for splenic rupture only during the time of g - csf administration and for about 10 days after the completion of the g - csf course .
since splenic enlargement may persist for longer periods in some donor , until more data are available it may be worthwhile to counsel pbpc donors to avoid activities that could lead to abdominal and splenic trauma for 2 to 3 weeks after the last dose of g - csf .

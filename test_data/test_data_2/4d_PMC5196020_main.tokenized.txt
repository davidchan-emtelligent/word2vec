summary the abrupt and irreversible transition from interphase to m phase is essential to separate dna replication from chromosome segregation .
this transition requires the switch - like phosphorylation of hundreds of proteins by the cyclin - dependent kinase 1 ( cdk1 ) : cyclin b ( cycb ) complex .
previous studies have ascribed these switch - like phosphorylations to the auto - activation of cdk1 : cycb through the removal of inhibitory phosphorylations on cdk1 - tyr15 [ 1 , 2 ] .
the positive feedback in cdk1 activation creates a bistable switch that makes mitotic commitment irreversible [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] .
here , we surprisingly find that cdk1 auto - activation is dispensable for irreversible , switch - like mitotic entry due to a second mechanism , whereby cdk1 : cycb inhibits its counteracting phosphatase ( pp2a : b55 ) .
we show that the pp2a : b55 - inhibiting greatwall ( gwl ) - endosulfine ( ensa ) pathway is both necessary and sufficient for switch - like phosphorylations of mitotic substrates .
using purified components of the gwl - ensa pathway in a reconstituted system , we found a sharp cdk1 threshold for phosphorylation of a luminescent mitotic substrate .
the cdk1 threshold to induce mitotic phosphorylation is distinctly higher than the cdk1 threshold required to maintain these phosphorylations - - evidence for bistability .
a combination of mathematical modeling and biochemical reconstitution show that the bistable behavior of the gwl - ensa pathway emerges from its mutual antagonism with pp2a : b55 .
our results demonstrate that two interlinked bistable mechanisms provide a robust solution for irreversible and switch - like mitotic entry .

keywords mitosis cyclin - dependent kinase pp2a greatwall kinase hysteresis threshold robustness published : november 23 , 2016 results and discussion cell - cycle progression requires rapid and irreversible cellular decisions at the transitions between phases .
a key transition is the entry into mitosis , which requires the phosphorylation of hundreds of proteins by cyclin - dependent kinase 1 ( cdk1 ) : cyclin b ( cycb ) to bring about processes such as nuclear envelope breakdown , chromosome condensation , and spindle assembly .
the basic requirements of rapid and irreversible transitions are met , because the response to cycb is governed by a fast , bistable switch [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] .
below a cycb threshold , the cell remains in interphase , because cdk1 : cycb complexes are inactivated by phosphorylation at cdk1 - tyr15 ( y15 ) .
above the cycb threshold , the inhibitory y15 phosphorylation is removed , because the y15 kinases ( wee1 / myt1 ) are turned off while the y15 phosphatase ( cdc25 ) is turned on [ 1 ] .
activated cdk1 phosphorylates many mitotic substrates , including wee1 / myt1 and cdc25 ; phosphorylating these y15 - modifying enzymes makes the system auto - catalytic .
however , cdk1 also performs phosphorylations that inhibit the counteracting phosphatase pp2a : b55 that eventually removes mitotic phosphorylations at m phase exit and in interphase [ 5 , 6 , 7 ] .
this led us to ask whether regulation of pp2a : b55 plays a role in creating the cdk activity threshold for mitotic substrate phosphorylations .
we induced phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of mitotic proteins in xenopus egg extracts by the addition of either non - degradable cycb ( cycb - deltan ) or the cdk inhibitor protein p27kip1 ( figure 1a ) .
to quantitatively analyze the ratio of cdk and pp2a : b55 activities , we developed a set of luminescent probes whose light emittance reflects their phosphorylation level ( figures s1a - s1c ; see also the supplemental experimental procedures ) .
the phosphorylation and light emittance of our probes correlated well with the phosphorylation / dephosphorylation cycle of mitotic proteins ( figures 1a , 1b , and s1d ) .
we also confirmed that mitotic phosphorylations required cycb levels to be higher than a threshold ( figure 1c , mock ) .
at low cycb levels ( at and below 108 nm ) , cdk1 becomes y15 phosphorylated ( an inactive state ) , and both the probe and the endogenous proteins remained dephosphorylated ( figures 1c and 1d , mock ) .
above a critical cycb threshold ( 126 nm ) , cdk1 became activated by the dephosphorylation of y15 , and mitotic phosphorylations were detected ( figures 1c and 1d , mock ) .
we conclude that the cycb threshold of cdk1 activation coincides with mitotic phosphorylation at the g2 / m transition and that our probes can detect this threshold in xenopus egg extracts .
it is well established that the cycb threshold of cdk1 activation due to y15 phosphorylation [ 1 , 2 ] can be abolished by the inhibition of wee1 / myt1 kinases [ 8 ] .
surprisingly , however , a sharp cycb threshold of mitotic phosphorylation persisted at a lower level of cycb ( about 60 nm ) when the wee1 / myt1 inhibitor pd166285 was added to the extract , despite the lack of y15 phosphorylation ( figures 1c and 1d ) .
therefore , we must distinguish two related , but not identical , thresholds : a threshold of cdk1 activation and that of mitotic phosphorylation .
since cdk1 activity is directly proportional to cycb levels in the absence of cdk1 - y15 phosphorylation [ 8 ] , figures 1c and 1d indicate a cdk1 activity threshold of mitotic phosphorylation that exists independently of the cdk1 auto - activation mechanism .
one way to establish a y15 - independent threshold of mitotic phosphorylation would be switch - like inactivation of a cdk1 - countering phosphatase , one obvious candidate being pp2a : b55 .
this enzyme is inhibited by the greatwall - kinase ( gwl ) - phosphorylated form of alpha - endosulfine ( ensa ) [ 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] .
because gwl is activated by cdk1 phosphorylation , cdk1 inhibits pp2a : b55 via this gwl - ensa pathway , allowing the high phosphorylation level of cdk1 substrates in mitosis [ 5 , 12 ] .
therefore , we tested whether the gwl - ensa pathway helps establish the cycb threshold of mitotic phosphorylation in xenopus egg extract .
in the absence of ensa , probe phosphorylation level showed a sigmoidal response to cycb levels with half the plateau level of the control sample , suggesting that the cdk1 auto - activation mechanism can still operate in the absence of pp2a : b55 inhibition ( figures 1e and s1e ) .
we conclude that the gwl - ensa pathway plays a major role in full , switch - like phosphorylation of mitotic substrates in response to the levels of cycb and cdk1 activity , even when the cdk1 auto - activation mechanism is intact .
to test whether the gwl - ensa pathway , together with cdk1 : cycb and pp2a : b55 , can create a threshold by themselves in the absence of cdk1 auto - activation , we next developed a reconstituted system of the gwl - ensa pathway using purified proteins ( figure s2a ) .
as would be expected , in the absence of ensa , the phosphorylation of both the probe and gwl showed a graded response to cdk1 activity with no threshold ( figures 2a , 2b , 2e , and 2f ) .
in the presence of the complete gwl - ensa pathway in the reconstitution system , cdk1 phosphorylation of the mitotic substrates showed a switch - like response at a cdk1 : cycb concentration between 5.1 and 6.8 nm ( figures 2c - 2f ) .
the most dramatic phosphorylation shift was shown by ensa , which was converted from the unphosphorylated to the phosphorylated form around the cdk threshold ( figure 2f ) .
the band shift of ensa is caused by gwl - catalyzed s67 phosphorylation of ensa , which is responsible for ensa binding to pp2a : b55 [ 13 ] .
in both the presence and absence of ensa , both the probe and gwl are partially phosphorylated at low - cdk activities to a similar extent , suggesting that pp2a : b55 is not inhibited below the cdk threshold of probe phosphorylation .
the sharp increase in probe phosphorylation above the cdk threshold coincides with ensa s67 phosphorylation , which titrates the phosphatase away from other phosphorylated substrates ( e.g. , both the probe and gwl ) .
the existence of a cdk threshold of mitotic probe phosphorylation in the steady - state response of the reconstituted system implies that all components of the system , including gwl , participate in inactivating , as well as activating , reactions .
if gwl were not inactivated by pp2a : b55 , there would be no cdk threshold , since gwl would eventually be fully activated at all cdk activities .
we therefore surmise that gwl is a substrate of the pp2a : b55 phosphatase ( figure 2c ) , which keeps gwl dephosphorylated at subthreshold cdk activities .
furthermore , inactivation of pp2a : b55 by s67 - phosphorylated ensa ( pensa ) causes a switch - like phosphorylation of gwl above the cdk threshold .
this effect creates an antagonistic relationship between gwl and pp2a : b55 , which can produce a cdk1 threshold for the mitotic phosphorylation [ 14 , 15 ] .
to better understand this antagonistic relationship , we formulated mathematical models of the gwl - ensa pathway ( supplemental information ) .
at the heart of the model is the double - negative feedback between gwl and pp2a : b55 ( figures 2c and s2b ) : gwl inhibits pp2a : b55 by activation of ensa through s67 phosphorylation , and pp2a : b55 keeps gwl inactive by dephosphorylating it. for completeness , we also include gwl auto - phosphorylation , which takes place after cdk - induced priming phosphorylation [ 5 ] .
the model also contains the " unfair competition " mechanism of pensa on the phosphatase [ 11 ] : the strong binding of pensa to pp2a : b55 titrates the phosphatase away from all other substrates and makes itself the preferential , albeit sluggish , substrate .
the mathematical model explains the sharp transition of the gwl - ensa pathway from an un - or hypo - phosphorylated " u " state to a hyper - phosphorylated " p " state by a bistable switch operating at the cdk threshold of mitotic probe phosphorylation ( figures 2g - 2i and s3a - s3c ) .
this bistable switch makes the strong and experimentally testable prediction that the system will display hysteresis .
at first , the cdk threshold for turning on the gwl - ensa pathway at the u - - > p transition ( the on threshold ) must be larger than the threshold for turning it off at the p - - > u transition ( the off threshold ) .
we used cdk2 : cyca in the hysteresis experiments as the source of cdk activity , because cdk1 : cycb is difficult to obtain in reasonable amounts from xenopus egg extract or from insect cells .
cdk2 : cyca behaves identically to cdk1 : cycb in all features in the reconstituted system , especially in producing the same cdk threshold of mitotic probe phosphorylation ( figures s3d - s3k ) .
p27kip1 was added to the reconstituted system in the " u " and in the " p " states .
starting from the " u " state , p27kip1 efficiently blocked phosphorylation of gwl , ensa , and the probe in the presence of a supra - threshold level ( 20 nm ) of cdk2 : cyca ( figures 3a and 3b , orange sample ) .
however , when p27kip1 was added to the " p " state , it was insufficient to induce dephosphorylation of any of these proteins within the experimental time course ( figures 3a and 3b , blue sample ) .
this apparent irreversibility of the gwl - ensa pathway in the reconstituted system is already a strong indication for a very small ( close to zero ) cdk threshold , because slowing down near a threshold is a signature of bistable systems .
this slow reactivation of pp2a : b55 is consistent with our model , which suggests that p - - > u transition requires ~ 300 min after cdk inhibition by p27kip1 ( figures s4a and s4b ) .
this long time delay of pp2a : b55 activation is caused by continued action of gwl after cdk inhibition by p27kip1 ( figure 3b ) .
dephosphorylation of mitotic substrates also becomes delayed after p27kip1 - induced mitotic exit of xenopus egg extract when the activity of pp1 is inhibited ( figure s4d ) , which is normally responsible for the initial inactivation of gwl [ 16 ] .
since this increased time delay makes the estimation of the off cdk threshold difficult in the reconstituted system , we decided to use a generic kinase inhibitor , staurosporine , which inhibits both cdk and gwl activities .
10 mum staurosporine added to the reconstituted system in the " p " state induced dephosphorylation of all proteins ( figure 3b , red sample ) .
however , this staurosporine - induced probe dephosphorylation was also characterized by a well - defined short time delay ( 5 min ) ( figure 3a , red line , 25 - 30 min ) .
this short time delay would be the consequence of " unfair competition " between pensa and the probe for pp2a : b55 [ 11 , 17 ] , which is terminated by pensa dephosphorylation by pp2a : b55 ( figure s4c , red curve ) .
the " unfair competition " is drastically lengthened after p27kip1 - induced cdk inhibition by the mutual antagonism between gwl and pp2a : b55 ( figures s4b and s4c , blue curves ) .
the mathematical model also predicts different on and off thresholds when both cdk and gwl are inhibited by staurosporine ( figures 3c , s4e , and s4f ) .
the hysteresis effect with staurosporine is caused by synergetic gwl - inhibitory effects of the inhibitor and pp2a : b55 rather than different sensitivities of the two kinases to staurosporine .
to test this prediction of different on and off thresholds , we added exponentially increasing concentrations of staurosporine to the reconstituted system before and 25 min after the addition of 20 nm ( supra - threshold ) cdk2 : cyca .
we then measured the steady - state level ( endpoint ) of probe phosphorylation ( figure 3d ) .
40 nm staurosporine started to suppress probe phosphorylation at the u - - > p transition , while 320 nm staurosporine was required to induce dephosphorylation at the p - - > u transition. from this result , we conclude that the reconstituted gwl - ensa pathway represents a bistable switch with two distinct thresholds for kinase activities .
we next asked whether we could obtain further evidence for the hysteresis of the reconstituted gwl - ensa pathway by manipulating the concentrations of gwl and cdk to decrease the time delay after the addition of p27kip1 .
our model predicts that both the on and off cdk thresholds of mitotic phosphorylation are increased with the lowering of gwl concentration ( figure 4a ) , and an increase of the off threshold provides an opportunity to decrease the time delay after cdk inhibition by p27kip1 .
intuitively , at low - gwl concentration , more cdk is required to turn on the system ( u - - > p ) , but it switches off faster after cdk inhibition ( p - - > u ) .
to test this prediction , we induced the " p state " at low gwl levels using a supra - threshold concentration ( 100 nm ) of cdk2 : cyca in the reconstitution system for 16 min before adding p27kip1 ( time = 0 in figure 4b ) .
s67 phosphorylation of ensa just before p27kip1 addition was increased with increasing gwl levels , reaching stoichiometric balance with pp2a : b55 around 3 nm gwl concentrations ( figure 4b , lanes 4 - 8 ) .
as we expected , phosphorylated ensa and phosphorylated gwl disappeared 95 min after the addition of p27kip1 in the samples containing gwl at 2 - 4 nm , an indication of p - - > u transition ( figure 4b , lanes 12 - 14 ) .
to get more insights about this experiment , we analyzed probe dephosphorylation of the same set of samples .
as expected from the model , increasing gwl concentrations delayed probe dephosphorylation in the reconstituted system , with a strikingly biphasic response at higher gwl concentrations ( figures 4c and 4d ) .
assuming that cdk inhibition is complete after p27kip1 addition , the curves of figure 4d allowed us to calculate the time course of release of pp2a : b55 from ensa ( figure s4g ; see the supplemental information ) .
these calculations show a relatively abrupt activation of pp2a : b55 from pensa inhibition , which makes the dephosphorylation of the probe biphasic .
since the model prediction matched well with the experiment ( figure s4h ) , this result further supports the idea that the reconstituted pathway has hysteresis .
our work identifies the gwl - ensa - pp2a : b55 pathway as a bistable switch in the reconstituted system and also as a source of the cdk1 threshold of mitotic phosphorylation in xenopus egg extracts .
the present work , together with the existence of the cdk1 auto - activation loop through y15 phosphorylation , led us to conclude that the eukaryotic mitotic control system is equipped with two bistable switches ( figure 4e ) .
these two systems mutually inhibit each other to ensure that the two switches occupy opposite states ( cdk1 on , pp2a : b55 off and vice versa ) .
this mutual regulation is dictated by pp2a : b55 dephosphorylation of cdk1 - y15 - modifying enzymes ( wee1 and cdc25 [ 18 ]) and by cdk1 phosphorylation of gwl [ 5 , 19 ] .
the two interlinked switches create a robust solution for switch - like mitotic substrate phosphorylation .
this robustness is underlined by our results showing that the gwl - ensa - pp2a : b55 pathway can by itself maintain switch - like mitotic entry , even when cdk1 - y15 phosphorylation is compromised ; a similar situation can also be observed in proliferating fission yeast [ 20 ] .
having two interlinked bistable switches regulating the transitions between interphase and mitosis enhances the difference between the on and off cdk1 thresholds , which makes state transitions more challenging .
therefore , additional components (" triggers ") might facilitate the transitions of the switch system from one stable state to the other .
cyca - dependent kinases have been suggested as triggers for mitotic entry , as they have considerable kinase activity in interphase [ 21 , 22 ] , consistent with our observation that cdk2 : cyca can activate the gwl - ensa pathway .
on mitotic exit , in contrast , dephosphorylation of gwl by pp1 [ 16 , 23 , 24 ] could initiate the reverse transition by supporting the pp2a : b55 auto - activation. whether the design principle of interlinked toggle switches with a pair of triggers is a generic feature of other decision - making pathways in living cells is a question for future experimental and modeling studies .

https :// doi.org / 10.3897 / zookeys.724.19383 introduction the true frogs of the genus rana linnaeus are broadly distributed across eurasia and the americas ( amphibia web 2017 , frost 2016 , yuan et al. 2016 ) .
because of their body coloration and habitat preferences , the species of this genus are colloquially known as brown frogs or wood frogs ( boulenger 1920 , yan et al. 2011 ) .
to date , more than 100 species are attributed to this genus , with their distribution ranges across asia ( 32 species ) , europe and the near east ( 12 species ) , and the americas ( 57 species ) with several lineages still being not formally described ( yuan et al. 2016 , amphibia web 2017 ) .
in china , the genus rana contained 17 species ( fei et al. 2012 ) that were divided into three groups ( r. longicrus group , r. chensinensis group , and r. amurensis group ) based on morphology and distribution ( fei et al. 2009 ) .
molecular phylogenies , however , indicate presence of r. longicrus , r. amurensis , r. chensinensis , r. sauteri , r. johnsi , r. shuchinae , and r. weiningensis groups within the chinese rana sensu lato ( che et al. 2007 , yuan et al. 2016 ). and 24 species are contains in chinese rana genus ( amphibiachina 2017 , yuan et al. 2016 , zhao et al. 2017 ) .
the species of the r. longicrus group are widely distributed in southern and eastern china , and the recent surge in new species descriptions suggests that these still insufficiently explored regions may contain many undescribed cryptic species ( lu and li 2001 , lu et al. 2007 , shen et al. 2007 , li et al. 2008 , yan et al. 2011 ). from 2015 to 2016 , we collected 17 specimens of rana sp. in montane forests of the dabie mountains .
the specimens exhibited comparatively large body size and a straight dorsolateral fold from posterior corner of eye to groin .
initially , they were identified as r. omeimontis ( according to the identification key by ye et al. 1993 ) .
however , from the further detailed studies indicated that this record might represent a yet undescribed cryptic species of rana .
generally , the brown frogs are difficult to identify in the field because of their close morphological similarities especially when closely related species have overlapping distributions ( stuart et al. 2006 , che et al. 2007 ) .
according to the results of subsequent molecular analyses and morphological identification , we confirmed that the specimens of rana sp. from dabie mountains were distinct from any species presently recognized in the genus of rana and herein we describe them as a new species .
materials and methods sampling : in total , 17 specimens of rana sp. were collected from yaoluoping national nature reserve in dabie mountains , yuexi county , anhui province , china ( 30degrees58'16.92 " n , 116degrees04'11.88 " e , elevation 1150 m a.s.l . )
( fig. 1 ) , in august 2015 and august 2016 .
those individuals were dipped in 10 % formalin ( 10 seconds ) for fixation and subsequently transferred into 75 % ethanol for storage .
before fixing in formalin , liver tissues from all individuals were sampled and preserved in 100 % ethanol for molecular analyses .
all specimens and tissue samples were deposited in the anhui university museum , research center for biology .

occurrence record is marked with green mark .
dna extraction , pcr amplification and sequencing : genomic dna was extracted from liver tissues of seven rana sp. specimens using the standard proteinase k / phenol - chloroform protocol ( sambrook et al. 1989 ) .
four mitochondrial genes ( 12s rrna , 16s rrna , nd2 , and cyt b ) and three nuclear dna markers ( tyr , bdnf and rag1 ) were sequenced for one individual , while for six remaining specimens only cyt b mtdna gene was sequenced .
the primers used for pcr and sequencing are summarized in table 1 .
all pcrs were performed with the same conditions in 50 mul : 20 to 80ng of genomic dna , 25 mul 2xeasytaq pcr supermix polymerase ( transgen biotech , containing 1.25u ex taq , 0.4mm dntp , 4mm mg2 +) and 0.4 mum of primers .
reactions were performed with the following profile : pcr cycles were 5 min at 95 degreesc followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 degreesc , 30 s at appropriate annealing temperature ( table 1 ) , and 1 min at 72 degreesc , with a final extension at 72 degreesc for 10 min .
the pcr products were purified using an easypure pcr purification kit ( transgene ) , and sequenced directly using the primers used in pcrs and the bigdye terminator v3.0 ready reaction cycle sequencing kit ( applied biosystems ) following the manufacturer 's instructions on an abi prism 3730 automated sequencer .

( 2012 ) phylogenetic analyses : 147 sequences were used for genetic analysis , which include 135 sequences within the chinese rana were downloaded from ncbi and 12 sequences in this study .
the data are summarized in table 2 .
all nucleotide sequences were aligned using muscle ( edgar 2004 ) with default parameters and checked manually with mega 5.0 ( tamura et al .
2011 ) , the length of the fragments was trimmed ; newly obtained sequences were deposited in genbank ( table 2 ) .
nucleotide sites with ambiguous alignments were deleted from the analyses .
bayesian inference ( bi ) and maximum likelihood ( ml ) analyses were conducted using the six concatenated gene fragments .
bi analyses were performed in mrbayes v3.1.2 ( ronquist and huelsenbeck 2003 ) using the optimal partitioning strategy and best - fit nucleotide substitution model for each region ( table 3 ) selected by partitionfinder v1.1.1 ( lanfear et al. 2012 ) .
mrbayes analyses simultaneously initiated two markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) model runs to provide additional confirmation of convergence of posterior probability distributions .
analyses were run for 10,000,000 generations .
chains were sampled every 1000 generations .
the first 25 % of the total trees were discarded as " burn - in " and the remaining trees were used to generate a majority - rule consensus tree and to calculate bayesian posterior probabilities .
nodal support was further assessed with a maximum - likelihood ( ml ) analysis in raxml v.7.0.3 with 1000 bootstraps .
pelophylax nigromaculatus sequences were downloaded from genbank and used as outgroup .

2011 ) to determine the genetic distance between species .
the analysis compared the 7 individuals of rana sp. from the dabie mountains to other 22 species of the genus rana inhabiting china .
morphological analyses : the morphometric data were examined for 10 individuals .
measurements were made by yanan zhang using a vernier caliper with a precision of 0.1 mm .
17 linear measurements ( fei et al. 1999 ) were taken as follows : svl ( snout - vent length , from tip of snout to vent ) ; hl ( head length , from posterior corner of mandible to tip of snout ) ; hw ( head width , the greatest cranial width ) ; sl ( snout length , from tip of snout to the anterior corner of the eye ) ; in ( internarial distance ) ; ed ( horizontal eye diameter ) ; io ( interorbital distance , the minimal distance between upper eyelids ) ; ue ( upper eyelid width , the maximal width of upper eyelid ) ; td ( horizontal tympanic diameter ) ; lahl ( length of lower arm and hand , from the tip of finger iii to the elbow joint ) ; hal ( hand length , from proximal end of outer palmar tubercle to tip of the third finger ) ; lad ( diameter of lower arm ) ; hll ( hind limb length , from the tip of the toe iv to groin ) ; tl ( tibia length ) ; tw ( tibia width , the greatest width of tibia ) ; fl ( foot length , from the proximal end of the inner metatarsal tubercle to the tip of the toe iv ) and tfl ( length of tarsus and foot , from the proximal end of tarsus to the tip of the fourth toe iv ) .
the description of toe webbing followed savage ( 1975 ) ( table 4 ) .
the morphological characters of the individuals of rana sp. from dabie mountains were compared with the members in the r. longicrus group , r. chaochiaoensis liu , 1946 , r. culaiensis li , 2008 , r. hanluica shen , jiang & yang 2007 , r. jiemuxiensis yan , 2011 , r. longicrus stejneger , 1898 , r. maoershanensis lu , 2007 , r. omeimontis and r. zhenhaiensis ye , 1995 .
we also compared individuals collected in this area with other rana species distributed in other parts of china r. arvalis gislen , 1959 ( previously listed as r. altaica , identification following yang et al. 2010 ) , r. amurensis boulenger , 1886 , r. luanchuanensis zhao , 2017 , r. asiatica bedriaga , 1898 , r. chensinensis david , 1875 , r. dybowskii guenther , 1876 , r. huanrenensis liu , 1993 , r. kukunoris nikolsky , 1918 and r. kunyuensis lu , 2002 .
considering the restrictions of samples , the morphological characteristics of the species in rana were obtained from literature ( fei et al. 2009 , fei et al. 2010 , fei et al. 2012 , zhao et al. 2017 , li et al. 2008 , yan et al. 2011 , inger et al. 1989 ) .

furthermore , the nucleotide sequence divergences based on uncorrected pairwise distances model among the 23 brown frog species examined are shown in table 5 .
the sequence divergences among the new populations from dabie mountains were 0.2 % .
sequence divergences between the new populations from dabie mountains congeners ranged from 8.6 % ( r. culaiensis ) to 27.7 % ( r. weiningensis ) .
within the r. longicrus group , divergence between were from 8.6 % ( r. culaiensis ) to 16.0 % ( r. chaochiaoensis ) .
sequence divergence between the individuals of rana sp. from dabie mountains and the sister species r. hanluica is 8.8 % ( table 5 ) .
based on phylogenetic analysis of both nudna and mtdna genetic markers and genetic distances in cyt b mtdna gene , it is demonstrated that the population of rana sp. from the dabie mountains represents a phylogenetically independent evolutionary lineage , and a member of r. longicrus group .
it represents a previously undescribed species which is described herein .

discussion the chinese species of the genus rana were divided into three species groups based on external morphology ( fei et al .
2009 ) ; however , previous studies have been hampered by sampling restricted geographic regions or limited species groups with limited gene markers , mostly based on mtdna .
for example , the european species r. arvalis and central asian species r. asiatica once were considered belong to r. chensinensis group ( fei et al .
2009 ) , while phylogenetic analyses indicated that these two species belonged to the same clade with r. temporaria .
the recent progress on multilocus phylogeny of the genus rana ( yuan et al. 2017 , zhao et al .
2017 ) indicated seven groups within the chinese rana sensu lato which contained 24 species ( 2017 , zhao et al. 2017 ) .
species in the r. longicrus group mostly occur in the southern part of china and taiwan with no significant changes , except that the number of species in this group has increased .
the species of the r. longicrus group appear to have highly conserved morphological characteristics compared to other species groups of chinese rana , implying that this group contains many cryptic species ( yan et al. 2011 ) .
in recent years , many species were identified based on molecular identification methods , providing a new understanding of the taxa that were once misidentified .
for example , r. jiemuxiensis was distinguished from r. hanluica based on results of molecular analyses and differing breeding habits ( yan et al. 2011 ) .
in the last decades , different opinions have been proposed on the distribution of rana species in the dabie mountains of central china .
initially , the brown frog species found in the dabie mountains was identified as r. japonica boulenger , 1879 ( zhao and wu 1974 ) .
subsequently , r. japonica was often mentioned in reports and surveys on amphibian fauna of this area ( lu et al. 1999 , shi et al. 2011 , zhao and wu 1974 , zhang et al. 2000 ) .
however , later it was shown that r. japonica is only distributed in japan , while chinese populations belong to a different species ( maeda and matsui 1989 ) .
in 2011 , the r. zhenhaiensis was recorded in the jintangtai national nature reserve ( shi et al .
2011 ) and the huangbaishan national forest park ( wang et al .
2011 ) during the monitoring of amphibians in the dabie mountains .
subsequently , r. zhenhaiensis was identified as r. culaiensis in huangbaishan national forest park through phylogenetic analyses ( zhao et al. 2015 ) .
in addition , the species of r. chensinensis was also mentioned as inhabiting in dabie mountains during the monitoring of amphibians ( pan et al. 2014 ) , and phylogeography analysis on r. chensinensis had never sampled in this mountains area ( che et al. 2007 ) .
so , with the help of phylogenetic analyses , three species ( rana dabieshanensis sp. n. , r. culaiensis , and r. chensinensis ) are now known to inhabit the dabie mountains ( fang 2011 , zhao et al. 2015 , zhou et al. 2012 ) .
during recent research in the dabie mountains , many endemic species like moschus anhuiensis ( su et al. 2000 ) and protobothrops dabieshanensis ( huang et al .
2012 ) were discovered , indicating that natural resources and animal diversity of this area are still insufficiently studied. with the addition of rana dabieshanensis sp. n the genus now contains 103 known species and 25 species in china .
to date , the new species is only known from a small montane area in anhui province of central china .
however , its range might include other montane areas of central and southern china , so further surveys are urgently needed for investigation of the current distribution and population status of this species .

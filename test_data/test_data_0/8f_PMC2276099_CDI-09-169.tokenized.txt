adaptive immunity is dependent on proliferation of antigen - driven b cells for clonal expansion in germinal centers ( gcs ) against t cell - dependent antigens ( td - ag ) , accompanied with somatic hypermutation of variable - region gene and class switching of b cell antigen receptors .
to study molecular mechanisms for b cell differentiation in gcs , we have identified and studied a 210 kda ganp protein expressed in gc - b cells .
ganp has domains for mcm3 - binding and rna - primase activities and is selectively up - regulated in centrocytes surrounded with follicular dendritic cells ( fdcs ) upon immunization with td - ag in vivo and in b cells stimulated with anti - cd40 monoclonal antibody in vitro , which suggested that ganp plays a certain important role in the maturation of immunoglobulin or selection of b cells in gc during the immune response to td - ag. since this up - regulation has not been detected in t cells in gcs and in concanavalin a - stimulated t cells in vitro , selective function of ganp molecule on b cell proliferation and differentiation might exist .

the signal intensity of mr images is a function of intrinsic tissue parameters ( e.g. , spin density rho , t1 , and t2 ) , and chosen sequence parameters ( e.g. , flip angle , tr , ti ) .
mr images do not directly measure the underlying states of the tissue parameters , but rather provide observations of functions of the underlying states .
when sequence parameters are selected properly , the contrast between tissue types is high enough to allow differentation of tissues via image segmentation .
our work explores image segmentation using multiple image contrasts ( i.e. , multiple acquisitions using different sequence parameters ). with multiple contrasts , the signal intensities from different images can be used to form a multidimensional feature space , increasing the distance between observations of different tissues as compared to a one - dimensional feature space based on a single image contrast .
methods we simulated the signal intensity of each tissue for an ir - bssfp pulse sequence at 1.5 t using common tissue parameters where air was assumed to have zero signal in addition to the following sequence parameters : flip angle = 65degrees , tr = 4 ms , and a range of inversion times from 48 ms to 540 ms. figure 1 illustrates the advantage of using multiple contrasts for separating tissues , depicting the signal intensities and example separation boundaries between tissues for : left , a single contrast , using ti = 49 ms ; and right , two contrasts , using ti = 49 ms and ti = 330 ms. figure 1 left , signal intensities of air , fat , myocardium , and blood using one contrast only .
right , signal intensities of the same tissues in a multidimensional feature space using both contrasts .
results a proof of concept 3d ir - bssfp scan was collected with different inversion times ; all other parameters were the same for both scans using ti = 49 ms and ti = 330 ms. images were processed using the fmrib software library ( fsl ) .
images were registered with the flirt tool , employing mutual information as the similarity metric , then cropped to include only the heart .
the cropped , registered images were segmented by inputting both contrasts into the fast tool .
the number of tissues was specified as four , with the intent of differentiating air , fat , blood , and myocardium .
figure 2 shows segmentation results using : left , manual drawing ( for reference ) ; center , fast with one image contrast ( ti = 49 ms ) ; and right , fast with both image contrasts ( ti = 49 ms and ti = 330 ms ) .
using only one contrast results in large areas of tissue misclassification , as indicated by the arrows .
the use of multiple image contrasts results in vastly improved tissue classification .

center , fast with one image contrast .
right , fast with two image contrasts .
arrows indicate large areas of error when using only one image contrast .
conclusions as more advanced 3d viewing tools become available , the need to automate the segmentation process grows .
this simple technique demonstrates a shift in imaging goal from high resolution 2d acquisition to tissue identification and lays the foundation for future sequence design .

we validate that the 28 days after hospital - discharge are high - risk for drugs - related death ( drd ) among drug users in scotland and investigate key risk - factors for drds soon after hospital - discharge .
using data from an anonymous linkage of hospitalisation and death records to the scottish drugs misuse database ( sdmd ) , including over 98,000 individuals registered for drug treatment during 1 april 1996 to 31 march 2010 with 705,538 person - years , 173,107 hospital - stays , and 2,523 drds .
time - at - risk of drd was categorised as : during hospitalization , within 28 days , 29 - 90 days , 91 days - 1 year , > 1 year since most recent hospital discharge versus ' never admitted ' .
factors of interest were : having ever injected , misuse of alcohol , length of hospital - stay ( 0 - 1 versus 2 + days ) , and main discharge - diagnosis .
we confirm sdmd clients' high drd - rate soon after hospital - discharge in 2006 - 2010 .
drd - rate in the 28 days after hospital - discharge did not vary by length of hospital - stay but was significantly higher for clients who had ever - injected versus otherwise .
three leading discharge - diagnoses accounted for only 150 / 290 drds in the 28 days after hospital - discharge , but ever - injectors for 222 / 290 .
hospital - discharge remains a period of increased drd - vulnerability in 2006 - 2010 , as in 1996 - 2006 , especially for those with a history of injecting .

introduction injecting drug users experience significantly higher mortality rates [ 1 - 13 ] , and identifying opportunities of intervention , such as upon release from prison or expiry of methadone prescription [ 5 , 10 ] , are important for public health policy .
scotland has invested in record linkage for drug users to monitor blood born viruses and prevalence of injecting drug users .
using record linkage , merrall et al .
[ 14 ] added to the literature of drug user mortality by showing that drug treatment clients were at increased risk of drugs - related death ( drd ) within 28 days after hospital - discharge in scotland in 1996 - 2006 ( 21 drds per 1,000 person - years ( pys ) ; 95 % ci : 18 , 25 ) .
in this article , we first validate the findings by merrall et al .
[ 14 ] for 1996 - 2006 by investigating sdmd clients' drd - risk by time after hospital - discharge in 2006 - 2010 .
the injector population is changing over time , as the progression and initiation of injectors changes through social change and public health interventions , so it is important to validate past findings .
secondly , using the entire 1996 - 2010 sdmd cohort with the increased person - years of follow - up - and hence increased statistical power - we are able to investigate more detailed hospital episode characteristics , such as duration of hospitalization and main discharge - diagnosis .
we confirm sdmd clients continue to experience higher drugs - related mortality rates after hospital - discharge , and further that having been an injection drug user better identifies those at highest drd - risk soon after hospital - discharge than duration of hospital - stay or main discharge - diagnosis .
methods the study of hard - to - reach populations , such as people who inject drugs , has been hugely facilitated by linkage between administrative records and confidential health registers , see for example [ 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 9 - 13 ] .
scotland 's information services division holds the scottish drugs misuse database ( sdmd ) , which records all registrations in scotland for drug treatment or support. by a variation on the privacy advisory committee permissions for scotland 's surveillance of the late sequelae after hepatitis c virus diagnosis [ 15 ] , we could access linked data for the present study of sdmd clients' drds to 31 march 2010 .
study population and data sources for each drug treatment registration in scotland , the sdmd holds limited identifying information : sex , date of birth , forename initial , first and fourth letter of the surname , and postcode sector of residence .
data are also held on risk behaviors such as illicit drugs used , reported misuse of alcohol , and injecting drug user status at the time of sdmd registration .
linked sdmd records were available on 98,388 individuals who attended drug treatment services between 1 april 1996 and 31 march 2010 .
deaths , hospital episodes and hepatitis c virus diagnoses of individuals registered on the sdmd during april 1996 through march 2010 were identifiable through linkages with the national registers held respectively by information services division , national records of scotland ( formerly the general register office for scotland ) and health protection scotland .
records were linked by information services division using a probabilistic approach on the available identifying information at the time of linkage .
note that these identifiers may have changed between the linkages performed in 2006 and 2010 .
for each sdmd client , potentially corresponding death , hospital records and hepatitis c virus records were ranked according to a linkage score which was based on a probabilistically - weighted combination of the occurring identifiers .
the top - ranked match would be successful if the score exceeded a pre - determined threshold ( see merrall [ 16 ] for further details ) .
the linked dataset was anonymized before transfer to medical research council biostatistics unit for analysis .
this anonymization , together with updating of contributory records , explains why linked - records for the same individual cannot assuredly be matched between successive linkages , such as for the 1996 - 2006 and updated 1996 - 2010 sdmd cohorts .
information services division has previously estimated its procedure to have an error rate ( either false positives or false negatives ) of less than 5 % [ 17 ] .
however , low - level inconsistencies inevitably remain .
moreover , due to the updating of the contributory linkable records , the sdmd cohort for 1996 - 2006 is now reckoned as 74,654 registered clients ( previously 69,457 [ 14 ]) .
there are thus actual differences in the client , drd , and person - year counts from those reported by merrall et al .
[ 14 ] for 1996 - 2006 but these differences have had no implications for the inferences drawn , which are robust .
statistical analysis we investigated drds as nationally defined by jackson [ 18 ] and national records of scotland , which comprise deaths involving drugs or attributed to one 's drug dependence and have the following groupings : mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance misuse ; accidental poisoning ; intentional self - poisoning by drugs , medicaments and biological substances ; assault by drugs , medicaments and biological substances ; and events of undetermined intent , poisoning .
see table 1 for the specific international classification of disease codes ( 9th & 10th version ) corresponding to each grouping .

the record is generated when a patient is discharged or transferred between hospitals , specialties or consultants [ 19 ] , and the duration of an episode may range from a day - visit up to a stay of several months .
hence , a single hospital - stay may comprise a series of episodes .
therefore , for each sdmd client , serial hospital episodes with overlapping or matching end - and start - dates were coalesced as a single hospital - stay which began at the set 's earliest start - date and ended on the latest end - date .
duration of hospital - stay was computed as ' latest end - date minus earliest start - date ' , and is thus measured in whole days with respect to the recorded admission and discharge dates .
the majority of hospital - stays were of one day or less , a large number were computed as zero - length .
within the data it is not possible to derive an exact admission time , so we cannot distinguish between a short - stay that occurs over night and a stay for at least one day .
accordingly , duration was summarized as 0 - 1 days versus 2 + days , the former accounting for brief episodes that may or may not have included an over - night stay .
the length of hospital - stay is highly skewed , and exhibits a so - called zero - inflated distribution ( meaning there are many individuals with zero - length stays ). with insufficient individuals to properly characterize longer stays , we dichotomize into ( conservatively defined ) day visits ( 0 - 1days ) or longer ( 2 + days ) .
hospital episodes are recorded with a main discharge - diagnosis and supplementary discharge diagnoses [ 4 , 16 ] .
we restrict attention to the main discharge - diagnosis of the last episode for each hospital - stay .
the discharge codes for drug - related morbidity were classified using the same groupings as for drug - related mortality but with the addition of poisoning by drugs , medicaments and biological substances and mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance misuse .
further major categories of discharge - diagnosis were : infectious and parasitic diseases ; cancer ; endocrine , nutritional and metabolic diseases ; mental and behavioral disorders - - excluding those due to psychoactive substance misuse ; diseases of the nervous system ; diseases of the circulatory system ; diseases of the respiratory system ; diseases of the digestive system ; and accidental .
see table 1 for the specific international classification of disease codes ( 9th & 10th version ) corresponding to each grouping .
for the validation analysis , time - at - risk was from 1 april 2006 or the date of an individual 's first attendance at drug treatment services if after 1 april 2006 , until the earlier of date of death or end - of - study , 31 march 2010 .
time since most recent hospitalization was categorized as : during hospitalization , within 28 days , 29 - 90 days , 91 days - 1 year , > 1 year after discharge from most recent hospital - stay versus ' never admitted ' ( reference category ) .
to be conservative , deaths which occurred on the end - date of a hospitalization were counted as hospitalized deaths .
as in merrall et al [ 14 ] , hazard ratios from cox proportional hazards analysis [ 20 ] , with adjustment for time - dependent covariates , are also reported .
for adequately - powered secondary analyses of behavioral risks ( ever injecting drug users ; misuse of alcohol ) and hospitalization covariates ( length of stay ; main discharge - diagnosis ) , we considered the 1996 - 2010 sdmd cohort in its entirety so that at least 30 drds in the 28 days after hospital - discharge might be available for analysis per discharge - diagnosis .
time - at - risk in secondary analyses was from the date of an individual 's first attendance at drug treatment services after 1 april 1996 until the earlier of date of death or end - of - study , 31 march 2010 .
all statistical analyses were conducted using r version 2.15.0 [ 21 ] .

moreover , within 28 days of hospital - discharge ever injecting drug users experienced a drd - rate of 32 per 1,000 person - years ( 95 % ci : 27.7 , 36.2 ) compared with 13 per 1,000 person - years ( 95 % ci : 10.0 , 16.4 ) for drug treatment clients who had never injected .
reported misuse of alcohol , although associated with as high a drd - rate in the 28 days after hospital - discharge , was a less prevalent risk - factor and did not differentiate drd - rate during hospitalization .
table 8 shows drd - rates within 28 days ( and 90 days ) after hospital - discharge by each of the following : ever injecting drug use and reported alcohol misuse ( from tables 6 and 7 ) ; duration of hospital - stay and main discharge - diagnosis .
there is no evident difference in drd - rate according to duration of hospital stay ( 0 - 1 days versus 2 + days ) .
however , we observe some variation in the drd - rate by discharge - diagnosis .

together , these top three discharge - diagnoses accounted for only 52 % ( 150 / 290 ) of the sdmd cohort 's drds within 28 days after hospital - discharge. by contrast , ever injecting drug users accounted for 77 % ( 222 / 290 ) of drds in the 28 days after hospital - discharge .
the sdmd clients who reported misuse of alcohol had a correspondingly high drd - rate soon after hospital - discharge but accounted for only 31 % ( 89 / 290 ) of all sdmd clients' drds in the 28 days after hospital - discharge .
ever injecting drug users' short - term risk can be summarized as one drd ( 95 % ci : 0.85 , 1.11 ) in the 28 days after hospital - discharge per 400 discharged sdmd clients who had ever injected .
discussion our key confirmatory finding is that drd - rates by time since most recent hospitalization remained significantly higher in the 28 days after hospital - discharge than at subsequent times post - discharge ( with and without covariate adjustment ) .
the sdmd cohort 's drd - rate while hospitalized had decreased in 2006 - 2010 , but absolute drd - risks soon after hospital - discharge remained similar across both periods .
new sdmd registrations in the validation period of 2006 - 2010 were different from those in the earlier registration period in important respects : a higher proportion of 2006 - 2010 registered clients were 35 years of age or older at registration than among clients whose first sdmd registration was in 1996 - 2006 , and a higher proportion reported never having injected .
this suggests that scottish drug users are not only ageing but that newer clients are less likely to have been initiated into injecting .
the study disputed our hypothesis that individuals who are hospitalized for a longer time ( at least overnight ) may be at greater drd - risk post - discharge due to loss of tolerance .
however , the duration of hospital - stay was a highly skewed variable ; with a few individuals experiencing very long ( several months ) periods .
there was insufficient statistical power to properly investigate the effect of short versus long stay lengths .
a further subdivision of duration of hospital - stay as 0 - 1 day , 2 - 6 days and 7 + days ( results not shown ) also showed no difference between stays of less than versus greater than one week .
the influence of main discharge - diagnosis on subsequent drd - risk was also analyzed by grouping the codes into pre - specified categories as used previously by merrall et al .
[ 4 ] .
we needed to consider the entire sdmd cohort in order to have sufficient power per discharge - category and , even so , only two main discharge - diagnoses exceeded 30 drds within 28 days after hospital - discharge .
these two discharge - categories were drug - related morbidity and mental and behavioral disorders excluding psychoactive substance misuse .
even together with diseases of the respiratory system , these top three drd - risk discharge - categories accounted for only 52 % ( 150 / 290 ) drds in the 28 days after hospital - discharge. by contrast , behavioral risk - factors were far more discriminatory with ever injecting drug use accounting for the vast majority ( 77 % : 222 / 290 ) of drds in the 28 days after discharge .
this finding gives added focus to scotland 's public health policy to make take - home naloxone ( opiate antagonist ) readily available , as well as training in its administration , not only in prisons and at drug treatment agencies but also at discharge from hospital , see [ 22 ] and [ 23 ] .
moreover , our new results suggest how hospital doctors can best target their harm reduction response [ 24 ] - not ineffectually according to patients' length of hospital - stay , nor too narrowly by concentrating on a few main discharge - diagnoses , but highly efficiently by focusing on those who have ever injected .
for ever injecting drug users , we note that one drd in the 28 days after hospital - discharge per 400 discharges is about half their estimated drd - risk in the 28 days after prison - release [ 25 ] .
for the sdmd cohort of over 98,000 drug treatment clients in scotland , we have confirmed that a high drd risk soon after hospital - discharge applies in 2006 - 2010 as it did in 1996 - 2006 [ 14 ] .
length of hospital - stay had no effect on drd - rate , discharge - diagnosis had an effect ( as did reported misuse of alcohol ) but neither was as discriminatory as the behavioral risk - factor of having ever injected .

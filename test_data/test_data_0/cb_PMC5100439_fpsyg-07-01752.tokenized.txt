psychopathology aetiology development brain - culture taxonomy psychopathology is the scientific exploration of clinically significant disturbances in an individual 's cognition , emotion regulation , or behavior , which reflect a dysfunction in the psychological , biological , or developmental processes underlying mental functioning [ american psychiatric association ( apa ) , 2013 ] .
the past two decades witnessed an accumulation of evidence for " psychopathological states as brain disorders ," which ignited new hopes that neuroscience will contribute to the advancement of clinical practices in psychopathology ( ekhtiari and paulus , 2016 ) .
however , these hopes were met with a few hurdles that must be overcome because translating basic knowledge about the neural mechanisms behind several psychiatric conditions to a clinical application is not very simple .
some of the reasons for these encountered difficulties to " bridge the gap between lab and clinic " are numerous and can be divided into four categories : ( 1 ) the lack of direct connections between basic research and clinical conditions ; ( 2 ) a tunnel vision that is too focused on the brain itself , which often ignores the contextual and historical ( developmental ) influences of the clinical condition under study ; ( 3 ) the lack of consideration for individual differences in a given clinical population ; and ( 4 ) the questionable validity of using a categorical mental disorder diagnosis .
therefore the " here and now " approach in psychopathology is not sufficient , and it should complement an approach that considers the disease process over time ( heckers , 2014 ) .
about the resistance to translational research in behavioral analysis the first challenge is improving the collaboration between basic and pre - clinical scientists on one hand , and the practicing clinicians on the other .
indeed , several decades ago , when clinical psychologists and psychiatrists were asked to rank the usefulness of research articles and scientific books to their clinical practice , the ranking fell near the bottom of the scale ( weisz et al. , 1995 ) .
unfortunately , this situation has not improved very much since that time .
therefore increasing some of the lab - clinic interactions are needed for psychopathology research .
for instance , laboratory procedures ( e.g. , attentional training in the context of anxiety disorders ) cannot be brought to clinical practice without significant adjustments to fit the clinical environment .
similarly , clinicians communicating with lab researchers may inform scientists on clinical outcomes , and the clinical phenomena encountered in their therapy .
unfortunately these interactions are often lacking because specialists , such as clinical psychologists and psychiatrists , tend to adhere to the protocols of their own area , and they could be less open minded about the practicess of another area .
the same can be said about lab researchers who are often less interested in translational research and clinical applications .
this adherance to one 's specialty tends to compromise the necessary lab / clinic interactions for making adjustemnts and for generating new ideas .
indeed , while clinical outcome studies can provide information about the overall efficacy of a treatment , they gather too limited information about the mechanisms of therapeutic change .
translational research can help identify not only what works in interventions aimed at faciliting emotional , cognitive and behavioral changes , but also how it produces positive results .
some of these interactions are beginning to take place , thus resulting in relevant theoretical contributions ( e.g. , on how an expansion of the alexithymia construct stimulates new forms of mechanisms - based clinical interventions ( lane et al. , 2015 ) .
indeed , the field of psychopathology has gained considerably from encouraging interdisciplinary and translational research .
however , one of the reasons for the hurdles encountered in bridging the gap between basic science and the clinic is the much too narrow brain - oriented research in psychopathology , which tends to focus on underlying brain mechanisms without much consideration for the environmental influences of this condition .
a better approach would consider the brain and environment as two dynamic forces with constant mutual influences .
a tunnel vision that is too focused on the brain itself another reason for the challenge of " bridging the gap " is the lack of consideration for individual variability , and the notion that not every individual with some abnormal behavior is necessarily " diseased. " indeed , one intriguing issue to consider is how social representations of a mental disease could shape the brain in different ways .
far from being a universal constant , brain processes underlying psychological states are shaped by culture [ e.g. , see the emerging field on cultural neuroscience ( chiao and immordino - yang , 2013 )] .
more specifically , there is a risk in " over - pathologizing " everyday life behaviors , and in focusing on the " pathological " aspects of the behavior without considering other " healthy " processes that help correct the abnormal behavior .
for example , consider the view of alcoholism according to the " disease " model .
this view considers addiction as an irreversible deterioration of neural processes serving affective and cognitive functioning .
although , it has been massively documented that addiction changes the brain just like diabetes changes the way the pancreas works , thus dramatically disturbing the normal hierarchy of needs and desires , it is noteworthy seriously consider evidence from studies on self - change , which is also referred to as natural recovery ( slutske , 2006 ) .
proponents of the natural recovery model argue that addicted individuals would be less prone to engage themselves into a self - change strategy if the societal response to addiction problems and views are based exclusively on a " disease model. " a self - change - friendly society would focus also on the protective factors that promote the resilience of the individual against alcoholism , instead of focusing only on deficits .
this is also relevant to the brain approach to psychopathological disorders because it indicates that self - regulatory brain mechanisms may be impacted heavily by addiction policies and images of afflicted individuals in the population .
another issue is the assumption , which is mostly based on the pure neurological syndrome , that when the brain psychopathology is so severe , then a brain deficit is implicated , and looking at environmental changes as a form of treatment might be less effective .
perhaps the future of psychopathology research should seek better understanding of the relationship between brain , context , and history , which should lead to more comprehensive and satisfactory explanations necessary for innovative treatments .
focus on individual differences in a given clinical population a third reason for the challenge of " bridging the gap " is the questionable validity of using a categorical mental disorder diagnosis .
a good deal of knowledge in the past several years came from the accumulating evidence that psychopathological conditions are associated with multiple causes ( i.e. , the concept of equifinality ) .
indeed , a given state can be reached by many potential means and psychopathological states exemplify this principle .
for this reason , an important clinical approach that became popular is the " what works for whom ?" approach .
the clinical course of the mental problem to be treated , the developmental pathways , the genetic susceptibilities and environmental protective and risk factors have all urged clinical scientists to customize their clinical interventions .
tailoring interventions to individuals may result in improving the efficiency of treatment delivery and maximizing its impact .
indeed , although efficient , therapeutic interventions in humans are at best relatively weak ( see for instance cohen 's criterion ) .
failure to consider inter - individual variation in developmental pathways and past or present living context means that , for some individuals , intervention efficacy could be much higher , and much smaller for others .
on the questionable validity of using a categorical mental disorder diagnosis finally , in an effort to develop alternative classification methods to the symptom - based diagnostic systems such as the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm ) and the international classification of diseases ( icd ) , the nimh encouraged researchers to take a dimensional approach to the study of the genetic , neural , and behavioral features of mental disorders ( morris and cuthbert , 2012 ) .
the justification for this effort comes from the evidence that the issues of comorbidity ( meeting one criteria for one disorder augments the probability to be diagnosed with another ) , the heterogeneity of symptoms ( two persons with the same diagnosis look very different ) , and the biological specificity are unacceptably low when using the older approach of drawing categorical lines between disorders .
the development of the research domain criteria consists of a matrix where the rows represent specified functioning constructs ( e.g. , genes , molecules , circuits ) grouped into higher - level domains of functioning ( emotion , cognition , motivation and social behavior ) .
the primary domains under studies include valence systems ( positive , negative ) , cognitive systems ( attention , memory , cognitive control , etc. ) , systems for social processing ( affiliation and attachment , social communication , perception of self , etc. ) , arousal / regulatory systems ( circadian rhythms , sleep ) .
this paradigm shift looks very promising as it offers new perspectives regarding the relationships between brain and behavior in mental illnesses , including psychopathology .
as an initial sign of addressing these outlined issues , many scientists are now considering the use of a variety of " big data " methods .
one example is the imagen multi - centre project ( schumann et al. , 2010 ) , which collects diagnostic , cognitive , genetic , contextual , and neural data of thousands of 14 - year - old adolescents over time with the aim of identifying predictors of mental health and risk taking behavior .
another example is internet testing ( gillan and daw , 2016 ) that allows collecting large samples of data , which in turn could provide a tremendous potential for psychiatric research .
in sum , bridging the gap in psychopathology necessitates overcoming a number of hurdles , which we outlined .
addressing these four outlined difficulties should stimulate future research in several directions .
this is what frontiers in psychopathology hopes to achieve .
exploring the translational pathway between research in neuroscience and conceptually novel forms of therapeutic interventions is of great value .
research on how abnormalities across brain - body - environment systems contribute to the vulnerabilities in psychopathology is seen as critical .
indeed , complementing to the so - called " encephalocentrism ," the exploration of how organism 's sensory - motor experience in relation to its environment has the potential to advance our comprehensive models of psychopathological states ( fuchs and schlimme , 2009 ; harshaw , 2015 ) .
the recent recognition that the insula , responsible for conscious accessible feelings from " raw " somatic signals ( craig , 2009 ) is among the regions most frequently associated with psychopathological conditions ( e.g. , craving determinants of smoking addiction ; naqvi et al. , 2007 ) should encourage the research on embodiment in psychopathology .
frontiers in psychopathology also welcomes studies that investigate inter - individual differences in a given clinical population and inter - individual responses to clinical trials , multi - dimensional longitudinal approaches affording a more valid identification of causes and effects related to mental illnesses , and importantly , the influence of cultural , and society on the expression of mental illnesses .

introduction there are currently 23 missense point mutations and one 4 basepair deletion spanning different mitochondrial genes associated with mitochondrial encephalopathy , lactic acidosis and stroke - like episodes ( melas ) .
the spectrum of mitochondrial dna mutations in arab patients with melas is largely unknown .
case presentation a standard clinical examination was carried out on a 34 - year - old saudi woman showing clinical features of melas .
fresh frozen muscle tissue was subjected to enzyme histochemical analysis .
dna was extracted from her leukocytes and muscle tissue , and the full mitochondrial genome was screened for base substitution mutations and deletions .
additionally , we screened the polymerase gamma - 1 nuclear gene for mutations .
the patient was negative for the most common m.3243 a > g melas mutation .
sequencing the full mitochondrial genome did not reveal any known or potentially pathogenic sequence changes .
the polymerase gamma - 1 gene was also free from mutations .
conclusion the clinical picture described here typically fits that observed in patients with melas or mitochondrial stroke - like events , but mutations in recognized genes ( mitochondrial dna and polymerase gamma - 1 gene ) were absent .
we report the case of a patient with typical clinical features of melas , but without an obvious genetic cause .
introduction mitochondrial encephalopathy , lactic acidosis and stroke - like episodes ( melas ) is a mitochondrial disorder typically associated with seizures and / or dementia with elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) lactate .
it is the most common maternally inherited mitochondrial disease , with an a > g mutation at position 3243 in the mttl1 trnaleu ( uur ) of the mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) gene responsible for more than 80 % of cases [ 1 ] .
currently , there are 23 missense point mutations and one 4 base pair ( bp ) deletion spanning different mitochondrial genes that have been previously reported in association with melas ( mitomap : http :// www.mitomap.org ) .
the spectrum of mtdna mutation in arab patients with melas is largely unknown , although one study has reported a novel mttl2 gene mutation in a saudi boy with typical clinical features of melas [ 2 ] , highlighting the fact that some melas patients who fulfill the traditional clinical criteria for melas could be negative for the most common m.3243a > g mutation in this population .
in such cases , the patient should be screened for secondary mtdna changes such as multiple mtdna deletions and for mutations in the mtdna polymerase gamma ( polg1 ) nuclear gene .
mutations in the polg1 gene have been implicated in a patient with melas [ 3 ] .
in this study , we describe a female patient with : i ) typical clinical features of melas ; ii ) absence of the melas m.3243a > g common mutation or any other obvious mtdna point mutation ; and iii ) absence of any polg1 mutation ( s ) .
case presentation we have investigated the case of a 34 - year - old saudi woman who presented with clinical symptoms suggestive of melas .
she was otherwise normal , able to finish college , had started work as a teacher and had married at the age of 22 .
she was well until age 24 when she started to have generalized tonic clonic seizures , which were successfully controlled with anti - epileptic drugs .
she lost her vision at the age of 27 and then became deaf , and at the age of 32 , she developed right - sided weakness .
at the age of 33 , she was admitted to hospital with abdominal pain and tenderness , hypoactive bowel sound , vomiting , dehydration and hypokalemia .
the symptoms were highly suggestive of pseudo - intestinal obstruction , which improved with conservative measures .
she reported no family history of a similar condition and her parents confirmed this .
she was underweight with a weight ranging from 33 to 34.5 kg and a height of 152 cm. her serum lactate was elevated at 3.8 mm ( normal < 2 mm ) as was her csf lactate at 4.5 mm. work - up initially showed a left occipital lobe infarction followed by progressive decline in visual acuity and hearing .
her seizures were controlled for 18 months with lamotragine , but subsequent medication was discontinued gradually .
she then developed an episode of acute visual loss , generalized tonic clonic seizures and status epilepticus , which was complicated by an aspiration pneumonia for which she required admission to the intensive care unit ( icu ) .
her general condition deteriorated rapidly , requiring ventilation support and a gastrostomy tube for feeding .
she stayed in the icu for approximately 2 months during which she became very wasted , spastic , mute , deaf , and blind .
cornea reflexes were present and gag reflex absent .
a computed tomography ( ct ) brain scan showed bilateral basal ganglia calcification and mild cerebellar atrophy ( figure 1a ) .
her axial t2 brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) scan showed a left temporo - parieto occipital ischemic lesion ( figure 1b ) , which extended beyond the typical vascular territory of the left middle cerebral artery ( figure 1c ) .
magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( mrs ) showing inversion of the j - coupling phenomenon at 1.3 ppm indicating a lactate peak ( figure 1d ) .

( c ) axial t2 brain magnetic resonance image scan showing the extension of the parietal temporal region to the occipital lobe , and also showing a right occipital lesion .
( d ) magnetic resonance spectroscopy showing inversion of j - coupling phenomenon at 1.3 ppm , indicating lactate peak .
the patient consented to a muscle biopsy , which was subjected to enzyme histochemical analysis as previously described [ 4 ] .
modified gomori trichrome stain revealed ragged red fibers ( figure 2a ) and cytochrome c oxidase ( cox ) staining showed abnormal accumulation of brownish staining indicating accumulation of mitochondria ( figure 2b ) .
succinate dehydrogenase ( sdh ) staining showed a few ragged blue fibers and intense staining in the mitochondria of the blood vessels , a feature commonly seen in melas cases ( figure 2c ) .

( b ) cytochrome c oxidase stain showing type - 1 lightly stained and type ii fibers , darker fibers , and a few fibers with abnormal collections of mitochondria ( arrowhead ) .
note cytochrome c oxidase negative fibers as usually seen in mitochondrial encephalopathy , lactic acidosis and stroke - like episodes ( melas ) .
( c ) succinate dehydrogenase staining showing a few ragged blue fibers and intense staining in the mitochondria of the blood vessels ( arrow ) .
( d ) electron microscopy showing abnormal collection of mitochondria with paracrystalline inclusions ( arrowhead ) , osmiophilic inclusions ( large arrowhead ) and mitochondrial vacuoles ( small arrowhead ) .
electron microscopy showed an abnormal collection of mitochondria with paracrystalline inclusions , osmiophilic inclusions and mitochondrial vacuoles ( figure 2d ) .
while analysis of respiratory chain enzymes in the muscle was not possible , we decided to pursue the underlying genetic defect based on the mitochondrial histochemical changes we observed , which were diagnostic of an underlying mtdna genetic abnormality .
skeletal muscle dna was used to determine the sequence of the entire mtdna coding region , but we did not detect any reported pathological or potentially pathological sequence changes .
recent findings of mutations in the nuclear - encoded gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the mtdna polymerase gamma - 1 ( polg1 ) gene [ 3 ] promoted us to screen this gene for mutations but no pathogenic mutation was identified .
the absence of mutations within the mtdna and the polg1 gene prompted further investigation into secondary mtdna changes .
discussion the m.3243a > g common melas mutation is responsible for more than 80 % of reported melas cases [ 1 ] .
most of these reports came from western countries .
however , more than 85 % of the dna samples sent to the molecular diagnostic laboratory at king faisal specialist hospital from arab patients with typical clinical features of melas were negative for the m.3243a > g common melas mutation ( personal observation ) .
in support of this , we previously reported a novel mttl2 gene mutation in a saudi boy with typical clinical features of melas [ 2 ] .
additionally , we have reported a different pattern of mutations in a group of arab patients with typical clinical features of leber 's hereditary optic neuropathy ( lhon ) .
in western countries , the three primary lhon mutations were detected in > 90 % of lhon cases , while only 17 % of arab lhon patients had one of the three lhon mutations .
the remaining 83 % had different mtdna mutations or other types of mitochondrial abnormalities [ 5 ] .
these findings highlight a possible variability in the mtdna mutation pattern among patients from different ethnicities with the same disease .
this observation , and the fact that mitochondrial disorders are clinically variable disorders , make it a challenge to draw reasonable phenotype - genotype correlations .
having said that , the typical clinical features observed among arab patients with melas are not different from those observed in western countries [ 6 ] and the variability is only limited to the spectrum of mutations detected .
our previous findings in the lhon study [ 5 ] support this hypothesis .
the patient described here had clinical symptoms suggestive of melas .
this was supported by her neuroimaging presentation , histochemical analysis , high serum and csf lactate levels and electron microscopic results from her muscle tissues .
genetics analysis of her dna indicated that she was negative for the m.3243a > g common melas mutation and screening of her entire mtdna genome did not reveal any reported pathogenic or potentially pathogenic mtdna mutation .
when we screened the entire mitochondrial genome of this patient , we ignored any dna variant not resulting in an amino acid change ( synonymous nucleotide changes ) and this is the current practice in medical genetics .
nowadays , however , numerous dna variants that are not associated with an amino acid change have been shown to have deleterious effects [ 7 ] .
because of this , we could possibly have missed the causal mtdna base substitution .
recent findings of mutations in the nuclear - encoded gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the mtdna polymerase gamma ( polg1 ) [ 3 ] , prompted us to screen this gene for mutations but no pathogenic mutations were identified after sequencing the entire gene .
we cannot of course ignore the contribution of other nuclear genes encoding proteins responsible for stability and structural components of the mtdna or to the oxidative phosphorylation ( oxphos ) machinery being involved in the pathogenesis of melas - like disease .
conclusion we report a patient with typical clinical features of melas but without an obvious genetic cause .

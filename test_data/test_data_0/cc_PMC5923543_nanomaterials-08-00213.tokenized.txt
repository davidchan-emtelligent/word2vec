exposure to exogenous noxae , such as particulate matter , can trigger acute aggravations of allergic asthma - - a chronic inflammatory airway disease .
we tested whether carbon black nanoparticles ( cbnp ) with or without surface polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) aggravate an established allergic airway inflammation in mice .
in an ovalbumin mouse model , printex ( r ) 90 ( p90 ) , p90 coated with benzo [ a ] pyrene ( p90 - bap ) or 9 - nitroanthracene ( p90 - 9na ) , or acetylene soot exhibiting a mixture of surface pah ( as - pah ) was administered twice ( 70 microl , 100 microg / ml ) during an established allergic airway inflammation .
we analyzed the immune cell numbers and chemokine / cytokine profiles in bronchoalveolar lavages , the mrna expressions of markers for pah metabolism ( cyp1a1 , 1b1 ) , oxidative stress ( ho - 1 , gr , gpx - 3 ) , inflammation ( kc , mcp - 1 , il - 6 , il - 13 , il - 17a ) , mucin synthesis ( muc5ac , muc5b ) , the histology of mucus - producing goblet cells , ciliary beat frequency ( cbf ) , and the particle transport speed .
cbnp had a comparable primary particle size , hydrodynamic diameter , and zeta - potential , but differed in the specific surface area ( p90 > p90 - bap = p90 - 9na = as - pah ) and surface chemistry .
none of the cbnp tested increased any parameter related to inflammation .
the unmodified p90 , however , decreased the tracheal cbf , decreased the muc5b in intrapulmonary airways , but increased the tracheal muc5ac .
our results demonstrated that irrespective of the surface pah , a low dose of cbnp does not acutely aggravate an established allergic airway inflammation in mice .
asthma allergic airway inflammation mucociliary clearance carbon black nanoparticles polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exacerbation 1 .
introduction asthma is a common airway disease with more than 241 million prevalent cases worldwide in 2013 [ 1 ] .
during an acute asthmatic response , the sufferer 's breathing is limited by an obstruction of the airway induced by smooth muscle constriction and mucus plugs in the airway lumen [ 2,3,4 ] .
moreover , asthmatic responses are associated with increased mucus secretion from goblet cells , epithelial injury , cellular infiltrations of immune cells , hyperplasia of smooth muscles , and deposition of excess collagen [ 2,5,6,7,8 ] .
asthma patients experience 0.3 - 3 acute aggravations of their symptoms per year - - called asthma exacerbations - - requiring an increase in their medication [ 9 ] .
because an exacerbation may require an emergency department visit or the hospitalization of the patient , asthma exacerbations are the main cost drivers of this chronic airway disease .
asthma exacerbations can be triggered by a variety of factors including air pollution [ 10 ] .
clinical and epidemiologic studies indicated that fine particles (< 2.5 microm ) and nanoparticles (< 100 nm ) from urban airborne particulate matter ( pm ) contributed to asthma exacerbation [ 11,12,13 ] , showing an increased use of asthma medication [ 14 ] , the reduction of lung function , and the increase of bronchial hyper - reactivity , as well as sputum il - 6 levels in subjects with asthma [ 13,15 ] , after exposure to traffic - related air pollution .
the main sources of urban pollution are exhaust particles that contain carbonaceous particles with surface - bound substances such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) [ 16,17 ] .
pah are typically detected as complex mixtures containing low and high molecular weight pah [ 18,19 ] .
low molecular weight pah which have a 2 - to 4 - ring system - - such as anthracene - - are considered to be low - carcinogenic , whereas high molecular weight pah - - such as benzo [ a ] pyrene ( bap ) - - consist of more than 4 rings and are classified as high - carcinogenic [ 20 ] .
the acute effects of pah alone or when pah are bound to carbon black nanoparticles ( cbnp ) comprise the induction of oxidative stress , cell death , and inflammation [ 21,22,23 ] , indicating a possible contribution to asthmatic exacerbation [ 24 ] .
previous studies in animals , in which model allergens such as ovalbumin ( ova ) were used to induce an allergic airway inflammation , showed that defined cbnp - such as printex ( r ) 90 ( p90 ) - can aggravate the allergic airway inflammation [ 25,26,27 ] and hyperresponsiveness [ 28 ] , and can increase the number of goblet cells in the intrapulmonary airways [ 25,26,28 ] .
the cbnp used represent the carbonaceous core of exhaust particles [ 16,17 ] but do not reflect the physicochemical characteristics of naturally occurring particles that exhibit chemical surface modifications .
in the present study , we analyzed the acute effects of the defined cbnp to clarify whether surface - bound pah enhance the potential of cbnp to trigger the aggravation of an established allergic airway inflammation and / or whether it may affect the mucociliary clearance .
we used p90 as reference particles and coated them with pah , either bap or 9 - nitroanthracene ( 9na ) .
additionally , we tested soot that contained a mixture of surface - bound pah generated from acetylene by flame synthesis [ 21 ] .
based on current reports that analyzed the content of fine and ultrafine particles in the air of european and asian cities [ 29,30,31 ] , and an experimental study that tested a low dose of p90 in a mouse model [ 32 ] , we calculated a low dose exposure regimen for our experimental setting in order to avoid particle overload , which might overlap with any surface - specific particle effects .
the cbnp were administered to ova - sensitized animals during an acute asthmatic response induced by pulmonary ova challenges .
in contrast to previous studies [ 25,27 ] , the asthma model used in our experiments reflects the three main features of asthma : airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine , eosinophilic airway inflammation , and goblet cell metaplasia , which are aggravated by an additional trigger such as poly ( i : c ) [ 33 ] .
therefore , our experimental model might be superior for the assessment of the effects of cbnp in an asthmatic lung .
since airway remodeling associated with asthma differs in the proximal and distal airways , we not only analyze whether the cbnp aggravate the allergic airway inflammation due to their specific surface characteristics but also whether the reaction to the cbnp is different in the intrapulmonary and proximal airways .
2. results 2.1 .
characterization of cbnp and their suspensions the cbnp were characterized with regards to the primary particle size , the specific surface area , the mass loss during heating up to 1000 degreesc , and their characteristics in aqueous suspension such as their hydrodynamic diameter and zeta ( zeta ) - potential .
the data are presented in table 1 .
the p90 nanoparticles and p90 - 9na were already used in a previous study showing the transmission and scanning electron microscopic images and the particle size distribution of p90 particles , and the mass loss of p90 - 9na as a function of the increased temperature [ 21 ] .
in the present study , a new batch of p90 - bap and as - pah was used .
electron microscopic images and the size distribution of as - pah without the pah , the mass loss up to 700 degreesc of p90 - bap and as - pah , and the pah species identified on the surface of as - pah are shown in figure s1 and table s1 .
all particles have a similar mean primary particle size , hydrodynamic diameter , and zeta - potential in water with 0.5 % bsa .
p90 exhibits a larger surface area and a smaller mass loss compared to the bap - and 9na - coated p90 particles and as - pah .
the mass loss of p90 - bap and p90 - 9na correlates with the content of bap and 9na adsorbed on the p90 surface .
the identified pah species that cover the surface of as - pah are shown in table s1 .
we detected a mixture of at least 12 different pah species with 2 to 5 aromatic rings .
in the cbnp suspensions that were used , no endotoxins were measurable .
2.2 .
cbnp did not increase inflammatory parameters in the lungs of ova - treated mice the allergic airway inflammation is associated with several changes in the lungs of animals of the ova control group .
compared to the pbs control group , the relative lung weight ( figure 1a and figure s2 ) and the parameters analyzed in the fluid from bronchoalveolar lavages ( bals ) - - the cell numbers of macrophages , lymphocytes , and granulocytes ( figure 1b ) , as well as the inflammation - related cytokines such as il - 5 , il - 13 , il - 6 , il - 1beta , kc , and mcp - 1 ( table 2 ) - - were increased in the ova control group .
in addition , the airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine was increased in the ova control group compared to the pbs control group ( figure 1c ) .
the exposure to cbnp did not increase the relative lung wet weight ( figure 1a ) nor the number of immune cells ( figure 1b ) or inflammatory cytokines ( table 2 ) in the bal fluid , and the airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine was not different from ova / h2o treated mice ( figure 1c ) .
however , we observed some significant decreases after cbnp - exposure compared to the ova / h2o group : ( i ) p90 reduced il - 13 ( table 2 ) ; ( ii ) p90 - bap and p90 - 9na decreased the number of eosinophils ( figure 1b ) , and reduced il - 4 ( p90 - bap ) or il - 1beta and il - 13 ( p90 - 9na ) ( table 2 ) ; ( iii ) as - pah reduced il - 4 and il - 1beta ( table 2 ) in the bal fluid .
the reduction of mcp - 1 protein level in the bal fluid was observed after exposure to all cbnp tested ( table 2 ) .
2.3 .
cbnp did not increase the mrna expression of inflammatory - relevant markers in the tracheal epithelial cells and intrapulmonary airways of ova - treated mice since the airways and airway epithelial cells play a pivotal role in the modulation of the inflammatory response - - for example , as a site of host defense and cytokine production - - we analyzed the mrna expression of markers for pah metabolism , oxidative stress , and inflammation in tracheal epithelial cells and intrapulmonary airways .
pah are metabolized by cytochrome p450 enzymes cyp1a1 and cyp1b1 , resulting in toxic modifications .
our results demonstrated that the exposure to cbnp did not increase the mrna expression of both cyp enzymes in tracheal epithelial and intrapulmonary airways compared to the ova / h2o group ( table 3 ) .
a main effect of the nanoparticles is the induction of oxidative stress .
therefore , we analyzed the mrna expression of oxidative stress markers glutathione peroxidase 3 ( gpx3 ) , glutathione reductase ( gr ) , and heme oxygenase ( ho - 1 ) .
after cbnp - exposure , the mrna expression of the three oxidative stress markers did not increase , compared to the ova controls , neither in tracheal epithelial cells nor in intrapulmonary airways ( table 3 ) .
the cells in the airways also contributed to the recruitment of immune cells into the lung by the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines .
for this reason , we analyzed the mrna expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ( mcp - 1 ) , an murine homolog of human il - 8 ( kc ) , and the interleukins il - 6 , il - 13 , and il - 17a .
our results showed that no cbnp increased the mrna expression of the analyzed inflammatory markers ( table 3 ) .
indeed , p90 - 9na significantly decreased the mrna expression of il - 6 and il - 13 in intrapulmonary airways compared to the ova / h2o group ( table 3 ) .
2.4 .
cbnp did not increase the number of airway epithelial goblet cells in ova - treated mice in asthma , the composition of the airway epithelium differs from healthy individuals showing , for example , an increased number of goblet cells filled with mucus .
to determine the contribution of cbnp to mucus production , we analyzed the mrna expression of the mucins muc5b and muc5ac , and the surface area covered by goblet cells and the volume of stored mucus in the intrapulmonary airways as well as the number of goblet cells in the tracheal epithelium using staining with periodic acid - schiff ( pas ) reagent .
our results showed that the exposure to the pah - containing cbnp , p90 - bap , p90 - 9na , and as - pah , did not change the mrna expression of the mucins compared to the ova / h2o group ( table 3 ) .
however , p90 had different effects in the tracheal and intrapulmonary epithelial cells .
p90 increased the mrna expression of muc5ac in the tracheal epithelial cells and decreased the mrna expression of muc5b in the intrapulmonary airways ( table 3 ) .
the pas staining of the lung slices showed that the exposure to cbnp did not increase the surface covered by goblet cells nor the stored mucus volume in intrapulmonary airways compared to the ova / h2o group ( figure 2a - c ) .
since p90 increased the muc5ac mrna expression in the tracheal epithelial cells , we additionally stained the tracheal epithelium after exposure to p90 with pas .
the results showed that the number of pas - positive cells was not increased after p90 - exposure compared to the ova / h2o group ( figure 2d,e ) .
2.5 .
p90 - induced mucus release affects the ciliary beat frequency in tracheal epithelial cells of ova - treated mice to visualize the released mucus on the epithelium , we stained the mucus with fluorescent lectins in freshly explanted tracheae .
the lectin staining showed increased mucus amounts on the epithelium of all ova - treated mice ( figure 3a ) .
however , the staining of mucus after exposure to p90 indicated an increased mucus quantity on the tracheal epithelium compared to the ova controls ( figure 3a ) .
scanning electron microscopic images supported this finding , showing a mucus - covered epithelium after p90 - exposure ( figure s3a ) .
scanning electron microscopic images not only showed mucus on the tracheal epithelium after ova treatment , but it also showed dead epithelial cells ( figure s3a ) .
since the mucus and the damaged epithelial cells can interfere with cilia - driven clearance in the airways , we analyzed the mean ciliary beat frequency and mean particle transport speed , and quantified the dead cells on the tracheal epithelium .
compared to the pbs control group , the cilia - induced particle transport speed was decreased in the ova controls ( figure 3b ) , whereas the ciliary beat frequency was not affected ( figure 3c ) , indicating that the mucus on the epithelium decelerated the transport speed .
the exposure to the cbnp did not further decrease the particle transport ( figure 3b ) , but the ciliary beat frequency was decreased following exposure to p90 ( figure 3c ) .
to clarify whether this effect was due to a p90 - triggered damage to the epithelial cells , we analyzed the dead epithelial cells in whole mount preparations of the trachea ( figure s3b ) .
generally , we detected no apoptotic cells in the whole mount preparations .
however , the amount of necrotic epithelial cells was increased in the ova control group compared to the pbs controls ( figure s3c ) .
the exposure to cbnp , however , did not lead to a further increase in the number of necrotic epithelial cells ( figure s3c ) .
due to these findings , we added adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) to the trachea samples to assess the functionality of the cilia .
after atp - exposure , the ciliary beat frequency was equally increased in all test groups ( figure 3d ) indicating that p90 did not induce a cilia damage .
since the ciliary beat frequency directly correlates with the particle transport speed without mucus or dead cells on the epithelium , the particle transport speed was only increased in the pbs controls after atp - exposure ( figure s4 ) .
in the trachea of ova - treated mice ( with or without exposure to cbnp ) , the increased ciliary beat frequency did not result in an increase of the particle transport speed ( figure s4 ) , most likely due to the extensive amounts of mucus on the epithelium .
3. discussion in a previous study , we showed that cbnp coated with pah had only minor pro - inflammatory effects in healthy animals in vivo [ 21 ] .
however , cbnp might exert different responses in individuals suffering from lung diseases , such as allergic asthma , and might result in the induction of an acute asthma exacerbation .
in the present study , we showed that p90 , with or without a defined surface - pah and an acetylene soot with a mixture of surface pah , did not acutely aggravate the established allergic airway inflammation in mice .
however , the unmodified p90 particles increased the mrna expression of muc5ac in tracheal epithelial cells , which is in agreement with the notion that a more adhesive and viscous muc5ac - containing mucus is released [ 34 ] .
in this study , we used p90 nanoparticles and coated the surface with a high - mutagenic 5 - ring pah ( that is , benzo [ a ] pyrene , bap ) or a low - mutagenic 3 - ring pah ( that is , 9 - nitroanthracene , 9na ) .
since the particle characteristics , such as the particle size and surface properties , define the cytotoxic potential of particles [ 35 ] , we analyzed the particle characteristics under dry conditions and in aqueous suspension .
as also previously described in reference [ 21 ] , all p90 - based nanoparticles have a similar mean primary particle size in the dry state and a similar hydrodynamic diameter and zeta - potential in water with 0.5 % bsa .
however , due to the coating procedure , the specific surface area of the coated p90 particles is only approximately one - third of the surface area of unmodified p90 particles .
the content of pah on the p90 surface was 10 % bap ( p90 - bap ) or 14 % 9na ( p90 - 9na ) of the total particle mass .
the similar pah content and specific surface area of coated p90 particles allowed us to analyze the pah - specific effects on the airway epithelial cells .
additionally , we tested soot from acetylene combustion ( as - pah ) that reflects carbon - based nanoparticles from naturally occurring combustion processes .
compared to the coated p90 nanoparticles , the as - pah had similar particle characteristics regarding particle size , hydrodynamic diameter , and zeta - potential .
however , as - pah contains a mixture of at least 12 pah species on the surface with 2 to 5 aromatic rings .
we identified the pah acenaphthylene , which contains 3 aromatic rings , as the most abundant and the pah cyclopenta [ cd ] pyrene , which consists of 5 aromatic rings , as the most toxic .
compared to the 5 - ring pah bap , cyclopenta [ cd ] pyrene induces the same mutation mechanism [ 36 ] and is more tumorigenic in mouse studies [ 37 ] .
however , based on the identified pah species on the as - pah surface and our previous findings [ 21 ] , the as - pah is potentially the most toxic nanoparticle tested in this study .
to avoid unrealistically high cbnp concentrations , we calculated a cbnp dose based on studies that determined the pm2.5 concentration in the ambient air of several cities in europe and asia [ 38,39,40,41,42,43,44 ] .
in european cities , the mean annual concentration of pm2.5 fraction is low and ranged between 7 microg / m3 and 35 microg / m3 in the last few years [ 38,39,40,41,42 ] .
however , the pm2.5 fraction can be temporally increased - - for example , in congested roads - - up to 76 microg / m3 [ 13 ] .
in chinese cities , the mean annual concentration of pm2.5 is higher and ranged from 55 microg / m3 to 102 microg / m3 in 2013 [ 43,44 ] .
moreover , the temporary peak concentrations can reach levels over 600 microg / m3 in urban areas [ 45,46 ] .
for our calculation , we used the data given by the mouse phenome database for female balb / c mice [ 47 ] , that is , a minute volume of 98 ml / min results in an inhaled amount of approximately 140 liters air / day .
at a concentration of 50 microg / m3 , a mouse inhales approximately 7 microg pm2.5 / day .
regarding the deposition efficiency of inhaled ultrafine particles in balb / c mice and human lungs , only 40 - 50 % of inhaled particles ( in our case , 2.8 microg - 3.5 microg pm2.5 ) were deposited in the lungs [ 48,49 ] .
at the dose of 7 microg used in this study , the cbnp did not induce an acute increase of inflammation in the lungs or related parameters in the intrapulmonary airways or tracheal epithelial cells .
this result is in agreement with the findings of a clinical double - blinded randomized cross - over pilot study that also found no acute effects on the allergic inflammation in human lungs after exposure to cbnp [ 50 ] .
however , the authors suggested a long - term effect of cbnp on the course of the asthmatic disease , as described for p90 nanoparticles in an allergen ( ova ) asthma mouse model [ 25 ] .
the results obtained from the mouse model showed that the time point of p90 - exposure determines the acute effect on inflammation and the course of the inflammatory response .
if mice received the p90 nanoparticles 24 h before the allergen challenge and thus , before the establishment of an allergic airway inflammation , the acute inflammatory response to allergen - exposure was pronounced [ 25 ] .
in contrast , if mice received the p90 nanoparticles 24 h after the establishment of an allergic airway inflammation , the inflammatory infiltrates were initially decreased and exhibited a temporally delayed increase after seven days [ 25 ] .
in our study , we did not detect an increase or a decrease in immune cell numbers after exposure to p90 nanoparticles .
since we used a more distinctive asthma model with pronounced eosinophilia that indicated a present inflammation , and repeated cbnp - exposure , immediately before and 24 h after the last ova challenge .
our more complex stimulation strategy may contribute to these differences .
because we previously demonstrate that the response of lungs and tissues of healthy animals depends on the specific surface chemistry ( that is , pah ) of the cbnp [ 21 ] , we tested if the same holds true for animals suffering from an inflammatory lung disease such as asthma .
we found that in contrast to p90 , p90 - bap and p90 - 9na decreased the numbers of eosinophils in the lungs , indicating that the coating might contribute to the previously described long - term effects on the course of allergic asthma diseases [ 25 ] .
immune and epithelial cells of the lung can respond to inhaled substances by the release of central mediators of asthma , such as il - 4 and il - 13 [ 51 ] , as well as inflammatory mediators , such as il - 1beta [ 52 ] , and immune cell attracting proteins , such as mcp - 1 [ 53 ] .
the profile of the mediators released depends on the inhaled substance and can be detected in the bal fluid .
in our study , the profile of inflammatory mediators was differentially regulated by the cbnp .
the p90 nanoparticles decreased the protein level of il - 13 , p90 - bap reduced the protein level of il - 4 , p90 - 9na induced the decrease of il - 1beta and il - 13 , and as - pah decreased the protein levels of il - 4 and il - 1beta .
since as - pah contained a pah - mixture with 3 - ring and 5 - ring pah and decreased il - 4 like p90 - bap - - which is coated with the 5 - ring pah bap - - and il - 1beta like p90 - 9na - - which is coated with the 3 - ring pah 9na - - we suggest that the modulation of inflammation depends on the chemistry of the surface pah .
however , the decreased levels of the mcp - 1 protein after exposure to all cbnp , including the uncoated p90 particles , suggest that the general particle characteristics such as the particle size or the zeta - potential contribute to the modulatory effect .
in summary , our data indicate that the tested cbnp attenuate the allergic airway inflammation in mice .
although this response seems to be beneficial at first sight , it must be taken into account that this modulation of the immune response may affect the following reactions to allergens , leading to the worsening of asthmatic diseases [ 25 ] .
previous studies indicated that a lowered antioxidant defense may be responsible for the increased susceptibility to cbnp and cbnp - induced acute exacerbations of allergic airway inflammation [ 24,54 ] .
however , our results did not confirm these reports .
although the antioxidant enzyme gpx - 3 had a decreased mrna level after the ova challenge , neither p90 nor the pah - containing cbnp ( p90 - bap , p90 - 9na , or as - pah ) induced the mrna expression of cytokines or chemokines in the tracheal epithelial cells .
moreover , the cbnp also did not exacerbate the inflammatory response in the intrapulmonary airways .
only p90 - 9na showed modulatory effects , decreasing the mrna expression of the inflammatory mediator il - 6 and , consistent with the decreased il - 13 protein levels in the bal fluid , of il - 13 .
besides airway inflammation , the increase of mucus secretion from goblet cells is a main feature of the acute asthmatic response .
indeed , mucus plugging was suggested to be a major factor responsible for the reduced lung function in severe asthmatics [ 55 ] .
mucus can be stained in the goblet cells with periodic acid - schiff ( pas ) reagent .
the periodic acid oxidizes the carbohydrates on mucins , mainly muc5ac , producing aldehyde groups that condense with the schiff 's reagent and result in a magenta coloration .
several studies showed that cbnp can increase the number of pas - positive goblet cells in the airway epithelium in allergen ( ova ) treated mice [ 25,27,28,56 ] , indicating an increased amount and release of mucus .
in our present study , we did not find increased numbers of pas - positive goblet cells or an increased volume of stored mucus in the airway epithelium after exposure to the cbnp .
however , the main gel - forming mucins in mammals are muc5ac and muc5b [ 34 ] .
muc5b has physiologic functions , ensuring normal mucus clearance , whereas muc5ac plays a role in mechanisms of allergen - induced airway hyperresponsiveness , mucous metaplasia , and airway mucus plugging [ 57,58,59 ] .
after exposure to unmodified p90 nanoparticles , we detected an increase of the muc5ac at the mrna level in the tracheal epithelial cells compared to the ova / h2o group .
in asthma , it is known that muc5ac - rich mucus impairs the cilia - driven transport by epithelial tethering without defects in the cilia function [ 60 ] .
based on our results , we suggest that the further increase of muc5ac induced by p90 nanoparticles modified the composition and characteristics of the released mucus .
the resulting more adhesive and viscous mucus might have agglutinated the cilia , causing the observed decrease in the ciliary beat frequency .
since the pah - coated p90 particles and the as - pah did not increase the mrna expression of muc5ac and did not affect the ciliary beat frequency , the higher specific surface area of p90 nanoparticles might be the critical particle characteristic responsible for this epithelial response .
our results additionally revealed an airway - region specific response to p90 .
while the muc5ac mrna expression was increased in the tracheal epithelial cells , the muc5ac mrna levels in the intrapulmonary airways remained constant .
in contrast , p90 decreased the mrna expression of muc5b in the intrapulmonary airways but had no effect on muc5b mrna level in the tracheal epithelial cells .
as mentioned above , muc5b , besides muc5ac , is the main mucus - forming protein in the airways .
muc5b is required for the airway defense against pathogens and is important for effective mucociliary clearance [ 57,61 ] .
our results indicate that the proportion of muc5ac and muc5b is affected due to the p90 - induced decrease of muc5b mrna expression in the intrapulmonary airways , probably affecting the mucociliary clearance .
since the decrease of the muc5b expression is predicted to create an environment that promotes eosinophil survival [ 59 ] and , furthermore , the reduced muc5b expression is a feature of severe ( th2 - high ) asthma [ 62 ] , the p90 - induced reduction of muc5b mrna levels also potentially indicates the worsening of allergic airway inflammation .
since we administered the cbnp during an acute asthmatic response with extensive mucus release , the hydrophilic and lipophilic features of the cbnp may play a role in bioavailability [ 63 ] .
the hydrophilic property of p90 may help the particles to penetrate into the mucus layer and facilitate the contact with the airway epithelium .
in contrast , the lipophilic features of pah bound on the surface of p90 particles and as - pah could facilitate the contact to glycoproteins and lipids in the mucus , leading to reduced bioavailability [ 63 ] .
in conclusion , our results demonstrate that a relatively low dose of cbnp with or without pah on the surface did not acutely aggravate the allergic airway inflammation in a mouse model of experimental allergic asthma .
however , the pah coating changed the biologic effect of cbnp on immune reaction and airway epithelial cells in vivo .

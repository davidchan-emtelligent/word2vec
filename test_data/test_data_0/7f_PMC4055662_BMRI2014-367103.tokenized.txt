epithelial ovarian cancer consists of multiple histotypes differing in etiology and clinical course .
the most prevalent histotype is high - grade serous ovarian cancer ( hgsoc ) , which often presents at an advanced stage frequently accompanied with high - volume ascites .
while some studies suggest that ascites is associated with poor clinical outcome , most reports have not differentiated between histological subtypes or tumor grade .
we compared genome - wide gene expression profiles from a discovery cohort of ten patients diagnosed with stages iii - iv hgsoc with high - volume ascites and nine patients with low - volume ascites .
an upregulation of immune response genes was detected in tumors from patients presenting with low - volume ascites relative to those with high - volume ascites .
immunohistochemical studies performed on tissue microarrays confirmed higher expression of proteins encoded by immune response genes and increased tumorinfiltrating cells in tumors associated with low - volume ascites .
comparison of 149 advanced - stage hgsoc cases with differential ascites volume at time of primary surgery indicated low - volume ascites correlated with better surgical outcome and longer overall survival .
these findings suggest that advanced stage hgsoc presenting with low - volume ascites reflects a unique subgroup of hgsoc , which is associated with upregulation of immune related genes , more abundant tumor infiltrating cells and better clinical outcomes .

introduction epithelial ovarian cancer ( eoc ) is the leading cause of gynecologic cancer - related death in developed countries , with nearly a quarter million women diagnosed worldwide annually [ 1 ]. of the various eoc histotypes , which have distinct precursor lesions , genomic profiles , and clinical course [ 2 , 3 ] , high - grade serous ovarian cancer ( hgsoc ) accounts for the majority of cases and a disproportionate number of deaths .
adding to the complexity , recent large - scale gene expression studies identified at least four molecular subtypes within hgsoc [ 4 , 5 ] , with some evidence associating these subtypes with differences in overall patient survival [ 4 , 6 ] .
ovarian cancer is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage , with high - volume ascites a common presenting feature [ 7 ] .
while some studies have indicated better prognosis in cases presenting with no ascites , most reports to date have grouped all histological subtypes and tumor grades together .
such an approach makes it difficult to assess if differences in ascites volume are an independent predictor of survival and better surgical outcome .
the association of ascites with poor outcome in eoc could reflect the fact that hgsoc is an aggressive cancer that tends to present with high - volume ascites and carries poor prognosis compared to other histological subtypes and low - grade disease [ 8 - 11 ] .
for this reason , we focused on a homogeneous group of patients diagnosed exclusively with hgsoc , to assess the significance of differences in ascites volume at the time of diagnosis .
although ascites often resolves early in therapy , reaccumulation occurs frequently and becomes a significant quality of life issue , particularly with chemoresistance and disease progression .
shortness of breath , abdominal bloating , pain , nausea , and early satiety caused by ascites contribute to cachexia with eventual compromise of the patient 's mobility and often with respiratory distress and bowel obstruction [ 12 ] .
while the pathogenesis of malignant ascites is incompletely understood , increased vascular permeability and tumor neovascularization due to high concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) and decreased rates of lymphatic drainage are considered critical [ 13 - 17 ] .
despite its clinical importance , ascites volume has not been captured as a parameter in molecular profiling studies .
in the present study , we focused on the impact of differences in ascites volume on patients diagnosed with advanced stage hgsoc .
we compared gene expression profiles in a discovery cohort of these tumors .
our analysis revealed a unique subset of immune - related genes upregulated in the low - volume ascites group .
immunohistochemistry performed on a larger cohort of primary tumors validated these results and showed increased number of tumor infiltrating immune cells in the low - volume ascites group .
this group also had better surgical outcome , defined as optimal (< 1.0 cm residual tumor ) versus suboptimal cytoreduction , and overall survival that was consistent with a stronger tumor immune response seen in those patients .
2. material and methods 2.1 .
whole genome transcriptome profiling a discovery cohort of snap - frozen , stage iiic primary hgsoc specimens from 12 patients presenting with low - (<= 200 cc ) or high - volume (>= 1000 cc ) ascites was obtained from the university health network biobank .
a gynecology pathologist ( bc ) reviewed each specimen to confirm the diagnosis and ensure presence of more than 70 % epithelial tumor cells .
the university health network research ethics board approved this study and all patients consented to the use of their tissue and clinical data for research .
rna was extracted from tumor tissue using an rneasy mini kit ( qiagen ) .
quality and quantity of rna as well as cdna were confirmed prior to hybridization to illumina humanht - 12 v4r2 beadchip microarrays .
only samples passing quality control metrics in the illumina beadstudio and r ( version 2.14.1 ; lumi bioconductor package ) software programs were included in the final analysis ( 9 of the 12 low - volume and 10 of the 12 high - volume ascites ) .
array data were converted to logs , quantile , and median - normalized and analyzed for differential expression between groups using genespring ( v12.1 , agilent ) .
unsupervised hierarchical clustering using average linkage rules and a pearson centered distance metric was performed to assess the overall degree of gene expression similarity among samples [ 18 ] .
all probes were filtered prior to analysis to remove those showing little or no signal in either sample group .
only probes reacting with at least 80 % of samples in either group , with expression in the 20 - 100th percentile of measured signal values , were retained .
a moderated student 's t - test [ 19 ] without multiple testing corrections was used to identify probes whose mean expression was different between low - and high - volume ascites samples .
a westfall and young family wise error rate ( fwer ) multiple testing correction was also applied to the moderated t - test .
all probes found significant were ranked by fold change .
gene ontology ( go ) analysis using a hypergeometric test with a false discovery rate ( fdr ) cutoff of q < 0.2 was used to find significantly altered categories .
for gene set enrichment analysis ( gsea ) , version 3.1 of msigdb was used with a cutoff fdr of q < 0.1 [ 20 ] using all unfiltered probes on the array .
gene expression array data have been deposited in the gene expression omnibus repository , accession number gse51831 .
2.2 .
validation by immunohistochemistry a tissue microarray was constructed using a semiautomated tmarrayer ( pathology devices , inc. ) from archived formalin - fixed paraffin - embedded tumors from a total of 54 patients with stages iii - iv hgsoc presenting with low - or high - volume ascites , including the 24 patients initially considered for the discovery cohort plus an additional 30 patients identified in the ovarian cancer database at princess margaret cancer center , toronto , on. only patients with sufficient archived primary and metastatic tissue were included .
two cores of each tissue were selected .
three cores were excluded prior to analysis due to poor quality ; hence a total of 51 cores were included in the final analysis .
immunohistochemical studies were performed for detection of proteins encoded by genes highly expressed in the low - volume ascites group .
sections ( 4 mum thick ) of the tissue microarray were deparaffinized and antigen retrieval or unmasking procedures were applied , if necessary , by heating the sections in 10 mm citrate buffer at ph 6.0 or tris - edta buffer at ph 9.0 using a microwavable pressure cooker .
endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3 % hydrogen peroxide .
after blocking with appropriate serum , sections were incubated with primary antibody using previously optimized conditions .
primary antibodies included anti - cd3 ( 1 : 500 , cat. a0452 , dako ) , anti - cd8 ( 1 : 200 , cat .
nclcd8 - 4b11 , vector labs ) , anti - cd20 ( 1 : 300 , cat. m0755 , dako ) , anti - cd74 ( 1 : 500 , cat. ab9514 , abcam ) , anti - cd48 ( 1 : 7500 , cat .
962 - m01 , novus biological ) , anti - tap2 ( 1 : 1000 , cat .
hpa001312 , atlas ) , and anti - hla - dr ( 1 : 7500 , cat. nb120 - 17844 , novus biological ) .
a super sensitive polymer - hrp kit ( biogenex qd440 - xak ) was used to amplify primary antibody staining .
immunostaining was visualized using freshly prepared diaminobenzidine solution ( dako ) .
sections were lightly counterstained with mayer 's hematoxylin .
tissue cores stained for hla - dr , cd74 , cd48 , and tap2 were scored as zero ( no staining of tumor ) , one ( intermediate staining ) , or two ( strong staining in >= 50 % of tumor ) by a pathologist blinded to patient clinical information .
the tissue microarray was also stained for markers of infiltrating t ( cd3 , cd8 ) and b cells ( cd20 ) .
for each patient , one area of primary tumor and one area of metastasis were selected after scanning all cores for tumor epithelium mostly enriched with tumor infiltrating leukocytes ( tils ) , in accordance with a previously described protocol [ 21 ] .
the number of tils was counted in one representative high power field up to a maximum of 50 tils per high power field .
staining intensity scores for tumor antigens were described using frequencies and proportions and compared between patients with low - and high - volume ascites using the wilcoxon rank - sum test and between primary tumor and metastases using the wilcoxon signed - rank test , with each sample acting as its own control .
immune cell scores were compared between the two patient groups using wilcoxon rank - sum test .
generalized estimating equations were used to determine ordinal and logistic regression parameters while adjusting for repeated measurements on patients to compare those with low - and high - volume ascites on pooled tumor staining scores and on pooled numbers of immune cells in the epithelium .
statistical significance was set to p < 0.05 .
all analyses were implemented using sas software , version 9.3 ts level 1 m1 .
2.3 .
patient outcome assessment a search of the princess margaret cancer center ovarian cancer database identified 240 stages iii - iv hgsoc cases that underwent up - front cytoreductive surgery between january 2003 and august 2011 .
clinical data extracted from real - time synoptic operative reports and / or electronic medical records for these patients included age at diagnosis , figo stage , ascites volume at time of surgery , surgical outcome , and date of death .
where applicable , date of death or survival duration as of april 2012 was validated using the ontario cancer registry .
only those patients with a clear indication of ascites volume >= 1000 cc ( high - volume ) or <= 200 cc ( low - volume ) were included in further analysis ( n = 149 ) .
continuous variables were compared between patients with high - and low - volume ascites using the wilcoxon rank - sum test .
categorical variables were compared using fisher 's exact test .
overall survival was measured from the date of surgery to the date of death from any cause .
patients alive at last followup were censored .
the log - rank test was used to compare outcomes for patients with high - and low - volume ascites , and a cox proportional hazards regression model was used to compare the two groups while adjusting for stage .
kaplan - meier plots were generated to estimate one - , three - , and five - year survival probabilities .
statistical significance was set to p < 0.05 .
3. results 3.1 .
gene expression profiling reveals a distinct signature for tumors associated with low - versus high - volume ascites nine samples with low - volume ascites and ten samples with high - volume ascites met the requirements for rna and cdna quality and constituted the discovery cohort .
median age for patients with low - and high - volume ascites was 68 ( range 44 - 84 ) and 58.5 years ( range 46 - 85 ) , respectively ( p = 0.57 ) .
all patients were diagnosed with stage iiic disease .
unsupervised two - way hierarchical cluster analysis of both the entire set of the filtered array probes ( 35433 probes ) and a subset of probes ( 371 probes ) that showed the most overall variability ( overall standard deviation > 1.0 ) did not segregate the samples according to ascites volume ( data not shown ) .
an uncorrected moderated t - test found 198 probes statistically different between ascites volume groups using p < 0.05 and a minimum fold change of 1.5. of these , 103 probes representing 98 unique genes were upregulated in the low - volume ascites tumors and 95 probes representing 84 unique genes were upregulated in the high - volume ascites tumors ( see supplemental table s1 in supplementary material available online at http :// dx.doi.org / 10.1155 / 2014 / 367103 ) .
a clustering of samples based upon these 198 probes is shown in figure 1 .
fifteen probes using a westfall and young fwer corrected moderated t - test were found to be significant using a p < 0.1 threshold and a minimum fold change of 1.5 .
these overlapped entirely with the 198 probes found with the uncorrected moderated t - test ( supplemental table s1 ) .
using go analysis , an enrichment of go terms such as antigen processing and presentation , mhc protein complex ( particularly mhc ii ) , and cytokine activity was found in the low - volume ascites group ( table 1 ) .
not surprisingly , the 9 ( out of 15 ) probes found upregulated in the low - volume ascites using the westfall and young corrected results were also enriched for immune related categories ( data not shown ) .
this enrichment of immune - related categories in the low - volume ascites group was further confirmed with gsea testing ( supplemental data table s2 ) , which uses a priori defined gene sets to find statistically significant ( fdr - corrected ) changes between two defined groups of samples .
in high - volume ascites cases , go analysis revealed genes associated with extracellular matrix ( supplemental table s3 ) .
3.2 .
increased immune response in tumors from hgsoc patients with low - volume ascites cd74 , hla - dr , and tap2 were expressed at significantly higher levels in the epithelium of cancer cells derived from tumors of patients with low - versus high - volume ascites ( figure 2 ; p = 0.046 , p = 0.006 , and p = 0.002 , resp. ) , consistent with our microarray data .
cd48 staining did not show the differential expression suggested by the rna data .
staining intensity for the four antibodies was similar between the primary tumors and the corresponding metastatic lesions .
while tumor infiltrating t lymphocytes were more abundant than b cells in the tumor epithelium , infiltrating t and b cells were both more common in the tumor epithelium of the low - volume ascites group based on staining for cd20 , cd8 , and cd3 ( p = 0.02 , p = 0.001 , and p = 0.01 ) ( table 2 ) .
the number of tils did not differ between primary tumors and corresponding metastatic lesions .
3.3 .
low - volume ascites is associated with better surgical outcome and survival overall 149 patients were included in the clinical data and outcome study : 65 with low - volume ascites and 84 with high - volume ascites .
mean age at diagnosis was similar and over 70 % of patients were stage iiic at the time of diagnosis in the two groups ( figure 3 ) .
while a higher percentage of patients with low - as compared to high - volume ascites had undergone aggressive surgery ( defined as at least one of the following : diaphragmatic stripping , peritoneal resection , bowel resection , or splenectomy ) to achieve optimal surgical outcome , this difference was not statistically significant ( 73.8 % versus 64.6 % ; p = 0.28 ) .
however , the clinical course of disease differed between the two groups ; the outcome of primary surgery was better for the low - volume ascites group with 63.1 % of patients having no macroscopic evidence of disease at the end of surgery , compared with only 29.8 % in the high - volume ascites group .
overall , only 13.9 % of the low - volume ascites cases , as compared to 49.2 % of the high - volume ascites cases , were suboptimally debulked ( p < 0.0001 ) .
this difference in debulking success remained after adjusting for stage .
moreover , 75.4 % of patients in the low - volume ascites group were alive at last followup ( median = 27.3 months ) versus 51.2 % in the high - volume ascites group ( median = 27.5 months ) .
since the 50th percentile survival had not yet been reached in the low - volume ascites group , we compared the 25th percentile for overall survival , which showed a value of 33.7 months versus 25 months for the low - versus high - volume ascites groups ( p = 0.009 ) ( figure 3 ) .
after adjusting for stage , the high - volume ascites group was still associated with higher risk of death ( hazard ratio = 2.1 , 95 % confidence interval : 1.18 , 3.78 , p = 0.01 ) ( figure 3 ) .
4. discussion our results demonstrate molecular differences between hgsoc associated with low - volume ascites compared to those with high - volume ascites .
the most significant finding is an upregulation of immune response genes in the low - volume ascites group .
the corresponding proteins are involved in immune response : hla - dr , hla - dm , and cd74 , which play a crucial role in hla class ii antigen processing and presentation ; hla - a and hla - f , mhc class i molecules , and their intracellular transport proteins tap1 and tap2 , involved in stimulation of cytotoxic responses ; chemokines such as cxcl9 , cxcl10 , and cxcl16 and cytokines such as ccl5 , which participate in t - cell activation and chemotaxis .
consistent with the microarray transcript data , immunohistochemical staining confirmed increased expression of hla - dr , cd74 , and tap2 proteins in the tumor epithelium of the low - volume ascites group .
in support of these differences in immune response gene expression , our results demonstrate that low - volume ascites tumors are characterized by more abundant infiltrating immune cells .
in addition , our data show that patients presenting with hgsoc and low - volume ascites are more likely to have successful cytoreductive surgery and to experience longer survival than those presenting with high - volume ascites , despite similar stage and grade at presentation .
it has long been established that eoc can stimulate host immune response and that the presence of infiltrating t cells , particularly cd8 + cytotoxic t lymphocytes ( ctl ) , is associated with a better outcome [ 22 - 26 ] .
in accordance with these studies , our results indicate better clinical outcome for the low - volume ascites group , whose tumors are characterized by more abundant tumor infiltrating cells .
high expression of hla - dm and hla - dr by the tumor epithelium of hgsoc correlates with tumor infiltrating t cells and better overall survival [ 27 ] .
hla class i antigens bind tumor - associated peptides during their intracellular assembly , which are then presented to ctl .
in general , eoc lesions display downregulated expression of hla class i or the processing intermediates , tap1 and tap2 .
in view of the crucial role of the hla class i complex in presenting tumor - associated peptides to ctl , it is not surprising that downregulation of hla class i and its processing machinery is associated with advanced stage and disease progression [ 28 ] and has a negative impact on patient survival [ 29 ] .
thus , our finding that both hla classes i and ii genes are upregulated in tumors from patients with low - versus high - volume ascites could help to explain their better clinical outcome .
this interpretation is supported by a recent cross - platform study of six gene array datasets ( including the tcga and the tothill datasets ) by yoshihara et al .
[ 6 ] that found decreased overall survival in hgsoc associated with reduced expression of immunoreactive genes in the tumor .
large - scale , genome - wide gene expression profiling studies of hgsoc by tothill et al .
[ 4 ] and tcga [ 5 ] indicate the existence of distinct molecular subgroups , with both studies identifying a subgroup enriched in immune response genes .
while these studies incorporated a wide range of presenting clinical parameters , ascites volume was not included .
a preliminary comparison of our upregulated genes in tumors associated with low - volume ascites with the genes upregulated in the tcga immune group indicates an overlap ( shown in figure 1 ) that is not expected by chance alone ( p < 0.01 , hypergeometric test ) .
the number of samples available for our discovery cohort was limited in size due to the variable capturing and inconsistent quantification of ascites volume in tumor banks and clinical databases , which resulted in our inability to find an external dataset to validate our findings .
nonetheless , our results are highly suggestive that low - volume ascites may be an associating clinical parameter of the " immune " molecular subgroup of hgsc .
the surgical outcome at the end of primary cytoreductive surgery is one of the most important independent predictors of survival for advanced stage eoc .
while resection of all macroscopic residual tumor is the optimal goal , debulking of tumor lesions to < 1.0 cm in their greatest dimension is considered beneficial [ 30 ] .
other independent prognostic factors identified by a large retrospective study of 1895 patients diagnosed with stage iii eoc include age , histological type , and performance status [ 31 ] .
in our study , age was similar between the two groups and histological type was restricted to hgsoc ; performance status was not addressed .
our results show that patients with advanced stage hgsoc presenting with low - volume ascites have improved survival compared to patients with high - volume ascites .
it remains unclear as to whether this is the result of improved surgical outcome , an enhanced immunoresponsiveness , or an interaction between these two factors .
5. conclusion this study shows that hgsoc presenting with low - volume ascites has molecular features distinct from hgsoc presenting with high - volume ascites and is characterized by an enhanced immunoreactive phenotype , better surgical outcome , and prolonged overall survival .
while further prospective studies are required , our findings suggest that these patients are likely to achieve favorable outcome at the end of primary cytoreductive surgery .
our results also indicate that adjuvant immunotherapy may be a reasonable future approach for the treatment of ascites .
we believe that ascites volume is an important clinical parameter that should be accurately captured to enable future research on differences in ascites volume in advanced ovarian cancer .

hierarchical clustering of patient samples based on 198 probes differentially expressed by >= 1.5 - fold as determined by a moderated t - test ( p < 0.05 ) in tumors associated with high - and low - volume ascites .
each line of the cluster tree shown at the top represents one patient sample .
the ascites volume group is indicated by the bar at the bottom and by the line color .
magenta bars on the side indicate probes corresponding to the 20 genes that overlap with genes within the tcga immunoreactive group and are upregulated in the low - volume ascites group .
figure 2 epithelial scoring for cd74 , hla - dr , tap - 2 , and cd48 expression and immunohistochemical staining in representative cases of low - and high - volume ascites associated primary tumor samples .
immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarrays containing a total of 54 tumors associated with high - and low - volume ascites .
magnification 9x .
figure 3 comparison of clinical parameters of patients included in outcome analysis .
p values shown in the table were determined by fisher 's exact test for categorical variables , the wilcoxon rank - sum test continuous and ordered variables , and the long - rank test for days to death .
n / a : statistical test not applied .
the predicted probability of overall survival in patients with low - and high - volume ascites diagnosed with stages iii - iv hgsoc is shown by the kaplan - meier plot .
data included in this plot were analyzed by a log - rank test .

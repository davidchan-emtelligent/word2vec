keywords posterior cruciate ligament avulsion fractures arthroscopy fixation issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background avulsion fractures of the tibial insertion of the posterior cruciate ligament ( pcl ) have always been regarded as rare injuries [ 1 - 3 ] .
the pcl serves as the primary restraint against posterior tibial displacement and together with the anterior cruciate ligament regulates external rotation of the knee during extension [ 4 , 5 ] .
pcl avulsion fractures are most commonly the result of dashboard injury , sudden hyperextension in conjunction with associated valgus or varus forces [ 6 - 9 ] .
surgical treatment of displaced pcl avulsion fractures is essential to prevent non - union or malunion , which can cause knee instability , and also surgical repair is done to prevent oa and knee pain [ 10 ] .
the tibial attachment of the posterior cruciate ligament is located in an area which is difficult to access [ 11 , 12 ] .
several techniques of open reduction and internal fixation under direct vision from a posterior approach are acceptable options [ 8 , 10 ] .
the purpose of our study is to verify the effects of anterior arthroscopic fixation with one or two cannulated , partially threaded screws for pcl avulsion fractures , in circumstances where the acute avulsion fragment is large .
methods patients all study procedures were approved by the hospital ethics committee .
the study only recruited patients who were mentally competent and gave their consent to participation pre - operatively .
the study was carried out from jan 2010 to nov 2012 .
the main inclusion criteria were : ( 1 ) fragment size of the pcl avulsion fractures of the tibia greater than 20 mm , as kim et al. recommended [ 11 ] ; ( 2 ) surgical reduction and fixation was done in the acute phase of fractures (< 3 weeks ) .
patients with serious injury associated with other ligament and supporting structures ( likely to affect the final outcome ) or an occult midsubstance injury of the avulsed pcl were excluded from the study group ( table 1 ) .
table 1 inclusion and exclusion criteria no inclusion criteria exclusion criteria 1 fragment size of the pcl avulsion fractures of the tibia greater than 20 mm patients with serious injury associated with other ligament and supporting structures 2 surgical reduction and fixation was done in the acute phase of fractures (< 3 weeks ) an occult midsubstance rupture of the avulsed pcl the diagnosis in all cases was based on history , physical examination and imaging studies .
a standard preoperative assessment of each case was composed of a clinical examination to define the instability and other associated problems .
routine radiography of the knees showed the fracture .
ct scan was also performed to further delineate the bony injury .
all the patients were also examined with mri and arthroscopy to rule out an occult midsubstance injury of the avulsed pcl , acl injury or injury of the posterior lateral corner .
pre and postoperative posterior instability was determined clinically by performing the posterior drawer test and radiographically by performing posterior drawer stress radiographs .
measurement of the posterior translation with the kt - 2000 arthrometer ( medmetric , san diego , california ) was performed as described by daniel [ 13 ] .
surgical technique each patient was positioned supine with the lower extremity held in 30degrees flexion .
a pneumatic tourniquet was applied .
standard knee arthroscopy was performed with anterolateral and anteromedial portals using a 30degrees 4.0 mm arthroscope .
an additional posteromedial or posterolateral portal was used for a wider and better view .
hematoma , fibrin clots , fat pad and soft tissue interposed in the fracture bed were removed with a motorized shaver that was passed through the above - mentioned portals .
careful probing was then made to identify other associated problems .
if feasible , associated meniscal lesions were primarily accessed with suture ; if not , the meniscal tear was partially resected .
the reduction and temporary fixation of the avulsion fragment could be evaluated using a probe that was passed through the posteromedial or posterolateral portal .
the tibial pcl guide ( acufex ) was used to further secure reduction of the fracture fragment and guide one or two 2.0 - mm kirschner wires for 4.5 - mm cannulated partially threaded screws .
it was helpful to perform this in anterior drawer position .
kirschner wires were drilled through the guide from the anterior tibial cortex into the lateral edge of the pcl avulsion site for temporary fixation .
exact positioning of the tip of the k - wire was checked fluoroscopically .
once position of the wires and reduction was confirmed under an image intensifier , a bone tunnel was then made and an appropriately sized partially threaded cannulated screw was used .
depending on fragment size , one or two screws were chosen .
these screws were inserted to lag and stabilize the bony fragment .
satisfactory fixation and compression of the avulsed fragment were ensured .
radiographic evaluation demonstrated proper position of the screws with all screw threads within the avulsed bony fragment .
finally , satisfactory fixation of the avulsed fragment should be determined radiographically .
tension of the pcl should be examined with palpation immediately to ensure the perfect fixation ( figs. 1 , 2 ). fig. 1 pcl avulsion fracture of a 26 - year - old male was fixed anteriorly under arthroscopy with one partially threaded cannulated screws .

g - i the position of two partially threaded cannulated screws was confirmed under image intensifier and x - ray examination after operation .
arrow pointed the fracture postoperative and follow - up protocol and measurements postoperatively , a controlled hinge knee brace was worn to control motion for 6 weeks and gradually increase range of knee motion [ 14 ] .
we typically performed only prone passive range of motion for these patients to protect the pcl .
partial or full weight - bearing was not permitted during the first 6 weeks .
mobilization was guided by a physiotherapist .
while wearing the brace , patients were encouraged to start patellar mobilizations , quadriceps isometric strengthening exercises , and range of motion exercises , as well as walk with the aid of crutches .
patients were assessed clinically and radiographically at 6 weeks , 3 months , 6 months , 1 year and 2 years later .
the international knee documentation committee ( ikdc ) objective form was used to evaluate results such as swelling , range of knee movement , jerk test , lachman test , and sagittal and frontal plane laxity compared to the normal contralateral knee [ 15 ] .
the posterior laxity was measured with a kt - 2000 arthrometer at lease 6 weeks after operation .
other pcl tests included the posterior sag sign , the quadriceps activation test , and the reverse lachman .
radiologic examination included anteroposterior and lateral x - rays of the knee for evaluation of the fracture union. and radiographic stress test can ensure the final stability after bone healing .
this objective described the instability postoperatively and implants were removed easily once bone healing was achieved .
results during the study , a total of 18 patients ( 13 males and 5 females ) were included .
the median age of the patients was 28 years ( range 20 - 42 years ) .
the injury was caused by sport activities in 6 patients and by motorcycle accidents in 12 patients .
the sport activities resulted in a twisting injury to the knee in 2 patients and a hyperflexion injury in 4 .
10 of the motorcycle accidents resulted in direct impact to the proximal part of the tibia while the knee was flexed .
in the remaining 2 motorcycle accident patients , the mechanism of injury could not be specified because the patients were unconscious when the injury occurred .
all patients underwent surgery within 1 week after trauma ( average 4.8 days , range 1 - 7 days ) .
examination under anesthesia before the surgery revealed grade - ii posterior instability in thirteen knees and grade - iii in five knees .
the average surgery time was 35 min ( range 21 - 55 min ) .
there were no complications such as neurovascular injuries , marginal skin necrosis and superficial or deep infection .
all patients were followed up on average for 34 months ( range 24 - 49 months ) .
in all cases , radiographic examination showed complete osseous union without any loss of reduction , at an average of 3 months after the procedure .
the assessment of posterior laxity with the kt2000 arthrometer demonstrated slight posterior tibial translation on the femur (< 5 mm ) only in 1 patient at 89 n and in 2 patients at maximal testing .
all knees were stable on the posterior sag sign , the quadriceps activation test , and the reverse lachman .
posterior stress x - rays in the follow - up period objectively described the stability .
only two patients had loss of flexion of about 10degrees ( grade b ) .
remaining patients showed a full range of knee motion , without any extension limitation at the final follow - up. according to the ikdc form assessment , 16 patients were classified as grade a and 2 were classified as grade b .
16 of 18 patients were absolutely pain free , and there was general satisfaction on pain questionnaire .
all the patients returned to their pre - injury knee function .
implants were removed easily in all cases , and no revision surgery was performed .
discussion the posterior cruciate ligament plays an important role in knee stabilization [ 16 , 17 ] .
avulsion fractures constitute a small sub - group of pcl injuries [ 2 ] .
although more and more reports have been published about pcl avulsion fractures and their treatment , there is still no consensus on how to treat this type of injury [ 18 ] .
most authors suggested surgical fixation [ 2 , 19 ] , although some surgeons recommend conservative treatment [ 20 ] .
surgical treatment of displaced pcl avulsion fractures is essential to prevent non - union or malunion , which can cause knee instability [ 21 ] .
previous approaches commonly recommend division of the medial head of gastrocnemius across its muscle fibers , first described by trickey in 1968 [ 22 ] , which enhances exposure of the pcl avulsion , but inevitably leads to postoperative weakness of the muscle [ 16 ] .
burks and schaffer 's approach uses the interval between the medial gastrocnemius and the semimembranosus [ 23 ] .
this approach never involves division of the medial head of gastrocnemius ; however , the posterior capsule and the avulsed bony fragment are not well visualized .
also it is difficult to place a screw perpendicular to the fracture plane [ 16 ] .
today , the trend has shifted towards arthroscopically assisted minimally invasive techniques [ 8 , 24 , 25 ] .
martinez - moreno et al. first advocated the possibility of arthroscopic treatment for pcl avulsion fractures ; they performed an experimental percutaneous fixation technique with the use of arthroscopic visualization to fix pcl avulsion fractures in cadaveric knees [ 26 ] .
kim et al. demonstrated that pcl avulsion fractures can be fixed with the use of arthroscopic methods ; they used a variety of methods for fixation including wires , loop sutures and screws .
the choice of fixation method was based on the size of the avulsed fragment .
small bone fragments (< 10 mm ) with comminution were fixed with the use of multiple sutures .
medium - sized fragments ( 10 - 20 mm ) were fixed with kirschner wires .
large single fragments of bone (> 20 mm ) that involved the condyles were fixed with one or two cannulated screws [ 11 ] .
fixation with sutures , k - wires , staple , or screws was good , but each technique has its own disadvantage [ 27 ] .
major problems include loss of reduction , residual anterior laxity , loss of extension , and non - union [ 3 , 28 , 29 ] .
depending on the fragment size , screws are chosen .
first , the tibial pcl guide ( acufex ) was used to lag and compress the fragment .
then , one or more screws were inserted to stabilize the fragment accordingly .
the function of the screws is to stabilize the bony fracture fragment .
it is not necessary that all screw threads should be within the avulsion fragment .
our aim was to achieve stabilization of avulsed fragments .
our surgical technique has several advantages : ( 1 ) it is a simple , valid arthroscopic technique where direct visualization is feasible .
( 2 ) it allows haemarthrosis wash , fracture inspection , and removal of interposed tissue .
( 3 ) it only needs a pcl reconstruction tibial guide and probe to reduce the fragment and subsequent drill pins to fix the fragment temporarily .
( 4 ) cannulated partially threaded screws are chosen , which allow them to be precisely located through the guide pin and thus achieve a stable fixation with compression between the bony fragment and the proximal tibia .
( 5 ) the cannulated screws are noticeably easier to remove .
( 6 ) check exact positioning of the tip of the k - wire fluoroscopically ; it can eliminate risk of neurovascular injury .
indications for this technique are as follows : ( 1 ) as kim et al. recommended [ 11 ] , fragment size should be large (> 20 mm ) , if cannulated screw is chosen .
( 2 ) surgical reduction and fixation in the acute phase is indicated to reduce the fragment conveniently and prevent non - union [ 5 ] .
the disadvantages are limitation of using for small or comminuted fragments .
the limitations of this study include the limited number of patients and the lack of a control group .
however , unlike previously reported studies , our study established clinical outcomes of surgery .
conclusions anterior arthroscopic - assisted fixation guided with a tibial pcl guide is a simple and feasible alternative for treating pcl avulsion fractures when the fragment size is larger than 20 mm. authors' contributions wh conceived and designed the experiments .

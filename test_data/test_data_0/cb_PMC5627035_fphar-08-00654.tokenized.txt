brown adipocytes dissipate energy as heat and hence have an important therapeutic capacity for obesity .
development of brown - like adipocytes ( also called beige ) is also another attractive target for obesity treatment .
here , we investigated the effect of farnesol , an isoprenoid , on adipogenesis in adipocytes and on the browning of white adipose tissue ( wat ) as well as on the weight gain of high - fat diet ( hfd ) - induced obese mice .
farnesol inhibited adipogenesis and the related key regulators including peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ( ppargamma ) and ccaat / enhancer binding protein alpha through the up - regulation of amp - activated protein kinase in 3t3 - l1 murine adipocytes and human adipose tissue - derived mesenchymal stem cells ( hamscs ) .
farnesol markedly increased the expression of uncoupling protein 1 and ppargamma coactivator 1 alpha in differentiated hamscs .
in addition , farnesol limited the weight gain in hfd obese mice and induced the development of beige adipocytes in both inguinal and epididymal wat .
these results suggest that farnesol could be a potential therapeutic agent for obesity treatment .
obesity farnesol beige adipocytes hamscs ampk ucp1 introduction terpenoids are a large class of organic chemicals and found in many higher plants as well as in insects and fungi .
particularly , a high number of terpenoids are produced in green and flowering plants ( pichersky and raguso , 2016 ) .
the fundamental function of plant terpenoids is defense against biological enemies , and they have diverse roles as phytohormones , protein modification reagents , anti - oxidants ( kessler and heil , 2011 ) , and anti - inflammatory agents ( morikawa et al. , 2017 ) .
therefore , terpenoids , which include carotenoids , isoprenoids , and its alcohol isoprenols ( polyprenyl alcohols ) , are contained in many plants for both herbal and dietary use ( he et al. , 1997 ; park and jang , 2017 ) .
farnesol , a typical isoprenol , has been reported to exhibit protective effects against many human cancers , such as lung , prostate , and colon cancer ( au - yeung et al. , 2008 ; jones et al. , 2013 ; gliszczynska et al. , 2016 ) .
farnesol also has a critical role in the amelioration of inflammatory reactions by regulating major inflammation - related factors including proinflammatory cytokines , cyclooxygenase - 2 , and nitric oxide synthase ( inoue et al. , 2000 ; ku and lin , 2015 ; santhanasabapathy et al. , 2015 ) .
additionally , farnesol supplementation modulates lipid profiles by reversing the aberrated low - density lipoprotein / high - density lipoprotein ( hdl - c ) and hdl - c / total cholesterol ratios in asthmatic mice ( ku and lin , 2015 ) .
this report suggests the possibility that farnesol may ameliorate obesity .
actually , it has been reported that farnesol decreases serum triglycerides and improves metabolic abnormalities by regulating peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor alpha ( pparalpha ) ( duncan and archer , 2008 ; goto et al. , 2011 ) .
obesity is a result of excess fat accumulation and causes diverse adverse effects on human health .
mammalian fat tissues consist mainly of adipocytes and have important roles in regulating systemic energy balance .
adipocytes are divided into two classes of adipocytes : white and brown .
whereas white adipocytes store energy in the form of triglycerides , brown adipocytes burn energy to produce heat in response to various stimuli such as cold or beta3 adrenergic receptor ( beta3ar ) agonists ( wang and seale , 2016 ) .
brown adipocytes have many mitochondria and carry out efficient thermogenesis through mitochondrial uncoupling protein ( ucp ; cannon and nedergaard , 2004 ) .
activation of brown adipocytes contributes to whole body energy expenditure and therefore is an attractive drug target for obesity treatment .
however , the small amount of brown adipose tissue ( bat ) in human adults certainly limits their use as an anti - obesity effect utilizing the brown adipocyte activity .
browning of white adipocytes is also another attractive target for obesity treatment .
white adipocytes can be developed to brown - like adipocytes ( also called " beige " or " brite ") , which are characterized as ucp1 - expressing and mitochondrial - rich adipocytes .
although much remains unclear of the development of beige adipocytes , it is certain that cold exposure and some other stimuli leads to appearance of ucp1 positive adipocytes which share a myf5 - / - origin with white adipocytes in white adipose tissue ( wat ) depots of mice ( peirce et al. , 2014 ; wang and seale , 2016 ) .
despite the controversy of the specific origin of beige adipocytes , several studies have reported the possibility of transdifferentiation between white and beige adipocytes ( bartelt and heeren , 2014 ; obregon , 2014 ; rodriguez et al. , 2015 ) .
stimuli inducing beige adipocyte development include synthetic compounds such as ppargamma or beta3ar agonist , and even natural compounds like berberine or capsaicin ( harms and seale , 2013 ; song et al. , 2017 ) .
because we could assume the possibility that farnesol is a potential therapeutic chemical for obesity treatment based on previous studies , we investigated the anti - obesity activity of farnesol in vitro and in vivo .
for the first time , we demonstrated that farnesol inhibits adipogenic differentiation of human adipose tissue - derived mesenchymal stem cells ( hamscs ) as well as 3t3 - l1 cell line .
in addition , we found that farnesol induces ucp1 expression in hamscs and in the wat of high - fat diet ( hfd ) - induced obese mice .

briefly , harvested cells or homogenized tissues were lysed in ice - cold ripa buffer .
after the protein concentration determination , equal amounts of total cellular protein were resolved by 6 - 12 % sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride ( pvdf ) membrane .
western blot analyses were done with polyclonal rabbit antibodies against ppargamma , c / ebpalpha , adiponectin , lipin1 , ampkalpha , pampkalpha , acc , pacc , and pgc1alpha , with polyclonal goat antibody against ucp1 , and with polyclonal mouse antibody against gapdh .
then , the blots were incubated with proper horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) - conjugated secondary antibodies ( jackson immuno research , west grove , pa , united states ) for 1 h at rt. animal experiments male c57bl / 6j mice ( 4 - week old ) were purchased from daehan biolink co .
( eumsung , south korea ) .
mice were maintained on a 12 h light / dark cycle in a pathogen - free animal facility and provided with diet and water ad libitum for 1 week prior to the experiments .
for obesity induction , the mice were fed a hfd ( rodent diet d12492 ; research diet , new brunswick , nj , united states ) consisting of 60 % fat in accordance with our previously published report ( jeong et al. , 2015 ) .
the mice were fed a hfd for 4 weeks before administration of farnesol .
after obesity induction , the mice were divided into two groups ( n = 5 ) which were fed with a hfd and a hfd plus farnesol ( 5 mg / kg / day ) for an additional 8 weeks .
a group fed a normal diet ( nd ) for 12 weeks was used as the normal control .
after the experiment , the mice were starved overnight and sacrificed under co2 anesthesia , and the tissues were collected for further analyses .
ethics statement all procedures used in the animal experiments were performed according to a protocol approved by the animal care and use committee of the institutional review board of the kyung hee university ( confirmation number : khuasp ( se ) - 13 - 012 ) .
immunofluorescence staining to evaluate the ucp1 and pgc1alpha immunofluorescence , after treatment with or without farnesol , the hamscs were washed three times with pbs and fixed with 4 % formaldehyde for 15 min at rt. they were permeabilized with pbs containing 0.25 % triton x - 100 for 10 min .
after that non - specific binding was blocked by incubation with 5 % bsa in pbs for 30 min .
then , they were incubated with ucp1 and pgc1alpha antibodies in 5 % bsa in pbs overnight at 4degreesc followed by incubation with fluorescent secondary antibody alexa fluor 488 and alexa fluor 546 for 1 h. finally , they were incubated with dapi for 3 min to stain the nuclei .
after staining , all the samples were mounted in mounting medium .
images were acquired on a fluorescence microscope ( logos biosystems , anyang , south korea ) .
hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) staining after the hfd mice were sacrificed , the inguinal wat ( iwat ) and epididymal wat ( ewat ) samples were fixed for 24 h in 4 % formaldehyde buffer and then dehydrated and embedded in paraffin following a standard procedure previously described ( kim et al. , 2015 ) .
the wat tissues were cut into 5 mum sections and stained with h & e. microscopic examinations were done using a regular light microscope ( olympus co. , tokyo , japan ) .
statistical analysis all data , expressed as the mean +/ - sem , were calculated by the one - tailed student 's t - test or the one - way anova using the software spss 12 for windows ( spss inc. , chicago , il , united states ) .
a value of p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance .
results farnesol inhibits adipogenesis through ampk and induces ucp1 expression in 3t3 - l1 cells to evaluate the cytotoxicity of farnesol , 3t3 - l1 preadipocytes were treated with various concentrations of farnesol , and the cell viability was determined by an mts assay .
treatment of 1 and 2 mumol / l of farnesol did not cause any cytotoxicity ( figure 1a ) .
based on this result , further farnesol treatments were done at concentrations of 0.5 and 2 mumol / l. next , to investigate the anti - adipogenic effect of farnesol , the lipid accumulation was measured with the oil - red o staining assay .
as shown in figure 1b , 2 mumol / l of farnesol inhibited lipid accumulation in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes ( p < 0.05 ) suggesting that farnesol suppresses adipogenesis in 3t3 - l1 cells .
to investigate the anti - adipogenic mechanism of farnesol , its effects on the mrna expression levels of pparg , cebpa , fabp4 , adipoq , resistin , and lipin1 were examined .
the cells were exposed for 48 h to farnesol concentrations of 0.5 and 2 mumol / l. farnesol ( 2 mumol / l ) significantly suppressed the adipogenesis - related genes at both the mrna and protein level ( p < 0.05 ) ( figures 1c,d ) .
farnesol also activated the phosphorylation of ampkalpha and acc with statistical significance shown in figures 1e,f ( p < 0.05 ) .
to further confirm the involvement of ampk in the anti - adipogenic effect of farnesol during the differentiation of 3t3 - l1 adipocytes , we co - treated cc , an inhibitor of ampk , with farnesol .
as a result , the down - regulation effect of farnesol on the expressions of ppargamma and cebpalpha disappeared by treatment of cc ( figure 1g ) .
we also investigated whether farnesol could induce the browning of white adipocytes .
farnesol induced the expression of ucp1 , a representative beige adipocyte - specific marker , at a concentration of 2 mumol / l in 3t3 - l1 cells ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 1h ) .

farnesol induces beige adipocyte - specific markers as well as inhibits adipogenic factors in hamscs farnesol exhibited cytotoxicity at a 4 mumol / l concentration in hamscs ( figure 2a ) ; thus , we selected a concentration of 0.5 and 2 mumol / l for the treatment of the hamscs .
farnesol also inhibited lipid accumulation in hamscs like in the 3t3 - l1 cells ( figure 2b ) .
the mrna expression of the adipogenic factors pparg , cebpa , fabp4 , and adipoq was significantly inhibited by the treatment with farnesol at a concentration of 2 mumol / l ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 2c ) .
the protein levels of ppargamma and c / ebpalpha were also confirmed in the hamscs by western blot assay ( figure 2d ) .
ampk and acc phosphorylations were increased significantly by treatment with farnesol while the total ampk and acc levels were unchanged shown in figure 2e ( p < 0.05 ) .
consistently , as shown in the 3t3 - l1 cells , farnesol promoted the progressive expressions of ucp1 and pgc1alpha during differentiation of the hamscs ( p < 0.05 ) ( figures 2f,g ) .
figure 2 farnesol induces development of beige adipocytes in human adipose tissue - derived mesenchymal stem cells ( hamscs ) .

farnesol promotes ucp1 expression in the wat of hfd - induced obese mice to investigate whether farnesol induces browning of wat in vivo as well , c57bl / 6 mice were fed farnesol and a hfd .
briefly , the mice were fed a hfd for 4 weeks to induce obesity before administration of farnesol .
after induction of obesity , the mice were randomly divided into two groups : a hfd group with vehicle treatment and a hfd group with farnesol ( 5 mg / kg / day ) .
the hfd plus farnesol group appeared to have significantly less weight gain than that of the hfd plus vehicle group ( 46.08 +/ - 0.42 vs. 50.86 +/ - 0.48 g , respectively ) .
additionally , the tissue weights and adipocyte sizes in both iwat and ewat were smaller than those of the hfd - induced obese mice ( figures 3a,b ) .
next , we investigated the expression of the adipogenesis - related factors ppargamma , c / ebpalpha , and lipin1 and the phosphorylated level of ampk in both the iwat and ewat .
farnesol administration reduced the expressions of the factors and activated the phosphorylation of ampk significantly ( p < 0.05 ) ( figures 3c - e ) .
furthermore , farnesol significantly increased the expression of ucp1 , the main factor of thermogenesis , and beige adipocyte - specific markers including tmem26 , tbx1 , and cd137 in the iwat and ewat from hfd - induced obese c57bl / 6 mice ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 3f ) .

discussion brown adipose tissue is the key site of non - shivering thermogenesis , and this thermogenic function is mainly mediated by ucp1 .
ucp1 , which locates in the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown adipocytes , dissipates the proton gradients which are generated by the electron transport chain .
this futile cycle decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential , which in turn elevates substrate oxidation of fatty acids , resulting in energy expenditure by generating heat ( cannon and nedergaard , 2004 ; kajimura et al. , 2015 ) .
beige adipocytes can also express ucp1 and are found in the wat depots of animals that have been exposed to cold and other inducers ( guerra et al. , 1998 ; harms and seale , 2013 ) .
while brown adipocytes express high amounts of ucp1 even under nonstimulated conditions , beige adipocytes , when fully activated , can produce similar ucp1 levels as brown adipocytes by external and internal stimuli ( wu et al. , 2012 ; okamatsu - ogura et al. , 2013 ; shabalina et al. , 2013 ; kajimura et al. , 2015 ) .
beige adipocytes express not only ucp1 but also brown adipocyte - specific genes such as cidea and pgc1a ( encoding pgc1alpha ) ( harms and seale , 2013 ) .
these factors induce the expression of mitochondrial and fatty acid oxidation and thermogenic genes ( tiraby et al. , 2003 ) .
in this study , farnesol induced ucp1 and pgc1alpha expression in human mesenchymal stem cells hamscs and in the wats of hfd - induced obese mice ( figures 2f,g , 3f ) .
in addition , farnesol induced expressions of tmem , tbx1 , and cd137 , beige - specific markers , in hamscs and in the wats of hfd - induced obese mice ( figures 2g , 3f ) .
these results suggest that farnesol can induce beige adipocytes development through both directed differentiation from white adipocyte precursor cells and transdifferentiation from mature white adipocytes .
moreover , farnesol treatment inhibited lipid accumulation and down - regulated adipogenesis - related genes such as pparg , cebpa , fabp4 , adiponectin , resistin , and lipin1 in 3t3 - l1 cells and hamscs ( figures 1c,d , 2c,d ) .
the down - regulation of adipogenic factors by farnesol was confirmed in the iwat and ewat from the hfd - induced obese in vivo model ( figures 3c,d ) .
in addition , body weight gain was decreased by farnesol administration to hfd - induced obese mice ( figure 3a ) .
we used two cell culture model systems : fibroblast - like preadipocytes 3t3 - l1 and hamscs .
farnesol induced the phosphorylation of ampk in the two types of adipose cells and inhibited the adipogenic differentiation through the ampk signaling pathway ( figures 1g , 2e ) .
two major transcriptional modulators , ppargamma and c / ebpalpha , are involved in adipogenic differentiation in all types of adipose cells ( barak et al. , 1999 ; rosen et al. , 1999 ) .
moreover , the expression and activation of ppargamma and c / ebpalpha are regulated by the ampk pathway indicating that the ampk pathway has crucial roles during adipogenesis ( long and zierath , 2006 ; chen et al. , 2011 ) .
indeed , ampk negatively regulates the expression of ppargamma and c / ebpalpha and inhibits preadipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis ( daval et al. , 2006 ; giri et al. , 2006 ; xu et al. , 2017 ) .
our results show that phosphorylated ampk was increased by farnesol administration in the iwat and ewat of the hfd - induced obese c57bl / 6 mice ( figure 3e ) .
in addition , in the iwat and ewat , expressions of ucp1 and several beige - specific markers such as tmem26 , tbx1 , and cd137 expression were also increased by farnesol ( figure 3f ) .
these results indicate that farnesol may drive the browning of wat through ampk activation .
our group reported that natural plant products prevent adipogenesis by activating ampk in vivo and in vitro ( kim et al. , 2014 ; han et al. , 2016 ; lim et al. , 2016 ) .
other studies also have reported that ampk is a target for berberine in the regulation of metabolism ( cheng et al. , 2006 ; lee et al. , 2006 ) .
in addition , berberine drives browning of iwat in db / db mice via ampk activation ( zhang z. et al. , 2014 ) .
as far as the involvement of ampk in the browning of wat , however , distinct results have been reported .
vila - bedmar et al .
( 2010 ) reported that the activation of ampk with aicar induced accumulation of ucp1 - positive adipocytes in the ewat of mice .
another study reported that treatment with aicar did not increase the ucp1 expression within the wat depots of male wistar rats ( gaidhu et al. , 2011 ) .
therefore , further study is needed to elucidate whether farnesol induces brown adipocyte development of wat through ampk activation .
in conclusion , farnesol inhibited white adipogenesis through ampk signaling and promoted beige adipocyte development in hamscs and the wat of mice .
therefore , farnesol can exert multiple beneficial effects through the inhibition and browning of wat .

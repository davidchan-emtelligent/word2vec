in our earlier work , we present a novel formal method for the semiautomatic verification of specifications and for describing web service composition components by using abstract concepts .
after verification , the instantiations of components were selected to satisfy the complex service performance constraints .
however , selecting an optimal instantiation , which comprises different candidate services for each generic service , from a large number of instantiations is difficult .
therefore , we present a new evolutionary approach on the basis of the discrete group search service ( d - gss ) model. with regard to obtaining the optimal multiconstraint instantiation of the complex component , the d - gss model has competitive performance compared with other service selection models in terms of accuracy , efficiency , and ability to solve high - dimensional service composition component problems .
we propose the cost function and the discrete group search optimizer ( d - gso ) algorithm and study the convergence of the d - gss model through verification and test cases .

introduction we have proposed a novel approach for the verification of service composition with contracts [ 1 ] .
the approach properties of the generic specification [ 2 ] in tecton [ 3 ] are verified by the violet [ 4 ] system .
after verification , a global optimum is selected from a number of instantiations of web service composition components with multiple qos constraints .
compared with other algorithms that evaluate all feasible composition instantiations ( e.g. , integer programming [ 5 ]) , evolutionary algorithms ( eas ) ( e.g. , genetic algorithm [ 6 ]) , which are nature - inspired optimization algorithms , are simple and flexible .
given their characteristics , eas have been used to solve the service selection problem .
we proposed a novel optimization model named discrete group search service ( d - gss ) that mainly employs the group search optimizer ( gso ) algorithm [ 7 ] .
the d - gss model has competitive performance compared with other eas in terms of accuracy , convergence speed , and ability to solve high - dimensional multimodal problems .
on the basis that gso can solve continuous optimization problems and that service selection can solve discrete instantiations , we present an evolutionary algorithm called discrete group search optimizer ( d - gso ) to select the best instantiation that has the lowest cost evaluated by the cost function .
the cost function consists of the utility function and the weight for every qos attribute .
we also verify and simulate results to analyze the convergence of the d - gss model .
the rest of the paper is organized as follows .
section 2 describes the d - gss model .
section 3 presents a detailed introduction of the cost function , and section 4 discusses the d - gso algorithm and applies the algorithm for the problem on searching for the global optimum from discrete instantiations .
section 5 introduces the convergence analysis of the d - gss model .
finally , section 6 concludes the paper .
2. distribute group search optimizer in this paper , we present a novel algorithm named d - gss toward the atomic service selection of composing complex services with multiple qos constraints .
the population of the d - gso algorithm is called a group searching for unknown optima in the services composition problem and each individual in the population is called a member .
in the n - dimensional search space i about composition component , every dimension represents a class of generic service denoted as i i. the ith member x i in the space i is denoted as follows : ( 1 ) i ={ i1,i2 ,... , in } , xi ={ xi1,xi2 ,... , xin } , where x i j in i j. the ith member x i at the kth iteration has a current position x i k in r n and x i k is corresponding to an instantiation of services composition component .
a head angle phi i k is the position of the member ; phi i k = ( phi i1 k , phi i2 k ,... , phi i ( n - 1 ) k ) in r n - 1 .
the search direction of the ith member , which is a unit vector d i k ( phi i k ) = ( d i1 k , d i2 k ,... , d in k ) in r n that can be calculated from phi i k via a polar to cartesian coordinate transformation [ 7 ] : ( 2 ) di1k = productq = 1n - 1cos ( phiiqk ) , dijk = sin ( phii ( j - 1 ) k ). productq = 1n - 1cos ( phiiqk ) ( j = 2 ,... , n - 1 ) , dink = sin ( phii ( n - 1 ) k ) .
in d - gso based on gso [ 7 ] inspired by animal behavior and animal searching behavior , a group consists of three types of members : only one producer is assumed to have the lowest cost at each searching bout , and the remaining members are assumed to be scroungers and dispersed members .
at each iteration , a group member representing the most promising instantiation and conferring the lowest fitness value is chosen as the producer .
it then stops and scans the environment to seek optimal instantiation .
the scanning field is characterized by maximum pursuit angle theta max and maximum pursuit distance l max . the apex is the position of the producer .
all scroungers will join the resource found by the producer according to area copying strategy .
the rest of the group members will be dispersed from their current positions for randomly distributed better instantiations .
to handle the bounded search space , the following strategy is employed : when a member is outside the search space , the member will return into the search space by setting the variables that violated the bounds into their previous values .
the details of d - gso ( see figure 1 ) are introduced as follows .
suppose that n classes of generic services exist in the n - dimensional composition component ; each class has n i ( 1 <= i <= n ) candidate services in a special sequence .
define the concrete cost function of the specific composition component .
the cost function is defined by the qos attributes of the component services as well as their integration relationships , such as sequential , parallel , conditional , or loop .
generate initial members from all instantiations and evaluate the members according to the cost function .
choose a member with the lowest cost as producer .
the producer produces on the basis of the discrete gso algorithm .
randomly select 80 % of the remaining members to perform scrounging .
the remaining members will be dispersed from their current instantiations to perform ranging .
evaluate all members according to the cost function .
if no optimal instantiation with multiple qos constraints is found , reallocate the role of every member on the value of the cost .
3. cost function a " generic service " is a collection of atomic web services with a common functionality , but different nonfunctional properties ( e.g. , time and quality ) .
each atomic service may provide a series of qos parameters , such as service time , cost , reliability , and availability .
users can set the number of qos values to be considered and can set the weights of the qos values according to their requirements .
in our study , each user has k qos attribute constraints in their qos requirements : q c = [ q 1 ,... , q k ] .
we focus on the qos service selection problem , in which multiple qos constraints must be satisfied .
we present the cost function to help in the selection of the best services .
the following steps are involved in the creation of the cost function .
each qos attribute must be quantitative .
service functionalities can be evaluated by several qos properties .
some qos attributes , for example , security and reliability , are difficult to measure quantitatively .
for these criteria , we employ the linguistic expression set l1 = { vp , mp , p , m , g , mg , vg } , where vp is very poor , mp is medium poor , p is poor , m is medium , g is good , mg is medium good , and vg is very good .
when calculating the cost function , set l1 is transformed into the corresponding quantitative set p1 = { 0.15,0.3,0.45,0.6,0.75,0.9,1 } .
global qos attributes ( q c = [ q 1 ,... , q k ]) are needed to describe the performance of an instantiation of service composition component .
every global qos attribute is aggregated by the qos attributes of all atomic services considering the integration relationships of the global qos attribute .
each service has four main basic structures : ( 1 ) the sequential structure , which represents n services that are invoked one by one ; ( 2 ) the loop structure , which represents one service that is repeated p times ; ( 3 ) the conditional structure , which represents only one branch that is selected to be invoked from n branches ; ( 4 ) the parallel structure , which represents n branches that are invoked simultaneously .
the complete structure of the service composition component consists of the above four basis structures .
every global qos attribute has its own aggregated method .
we sort the qos aggregated methods into three types : ( 1 ) the summation method ( e.g. , cost ) , in which the fees must be accumulated by the user to pay for invoking the services ; ( 2 ) the continued multiplication method ( e.g. , availability ) , in which global availability can be computed as the product of the ratios of all atomic service availability ; ( 3 ) the average method ( e.g. , reputation ) , in which global reputation is the average value of the related service reputation .
we present all particulars ( see table 1 ) of these three methods with sequential , parallel , conditional , or loop structures .
in table 1 , c i is a 0 - 1 variable .
if condition c i is satisfied , then we define c i = 1 ; otherwise , c i = 0 .
after the values of [ q 1 ,... , q k ] and [ q 1 ,... , q k ] are evaluated , we present a utility function to describe the relationship between q i and q i. two types of qos criteria are available , that is , cost and benefit .
in the cost criterion , variables ( e.g. , response time ) with higher values have lower qualities .
in the benefit criterion , variables ( e.g. , availability ) with higher values have higher qualities .
the utility function synthesizes the cost and benefit criteria .
definition 1 ( utility function ) suppose that a global qos attribute q i ( 1 <= i <= k ) and its constraint q i of an instantiation s j exist , the utility function is defined as follows : ( 3 ) u ( qij,qij )={ qijqij,if qij is the cost criterion,2 - qijqij,if qij is the benefit criterion .
if the global qos attribute q i satisfies the requirement of the qos constraint q i , then u ( q i j , q i j ) <= 1 ; otherwise u ( q i j , q i j ) > 1 .
( iv ) the cost function is based on the values of the utility function and the weights the user defined .
the better the instantiation is , the lower the quality of the cost function result becomes .
definition 2 ( cost function ) suppose that an instantiation s j exists in the qos attributes q c = [ q 1 j ,... , q k j ] , qos constraints q c = [ q 1 j ,... , q k j ] , and the weights for each qos attribute ; then the cost function is defined as follows : ( 4 ) f ( xj,qc,qc )= sumi = 1kwiju ( qij,qij ) , where sumi = 1 k w i j = 1 and u ( q i j , q i j ) <= 1 ( 1 <= i <= k ) .
the objective of this paper is to employ d - gso to get the optimal solution of the following model : ( 5 ) min ( f ( xj ))= sumi = 1kwiju ( qij,qij ) , where x j in r n .
4. d - gso algorithm the gso algorithm [ 7 ] designs optimum searching strategies to solve continuous optimization problems .
however , service selection is a discrete problem .
therefore , we present an evolutionary algorithm named d - gso that can handle composition components with discrete atomic services .
the steps of the d - gso algorithm are described in algorithm 1 .
in the d - gso algorithm , round ( x ) represents a round function for half adjust result .
suppose that subx i h. represents [ 1i h , 2i h ,... , n i h ] , which are the subscripts of atomic services composing an instantiation x i h about the ith member x i at the hth iteration .
at the ( h + 1 ) iteration , the transformation of the subscripts by the following formulas is [ 1i h + 1 , 2i h + 1 ,... , n i h + 1 ] relating to a new instantiation ( see algorithm 1 ) .
5. convergence analysis of the d - gss model 5.1 .
convergence verification in this section , we verified the convergence of the d - gss model .
after n iterations , the best instantiation with the lowest cost can be determined with the cooperation of the producer and some scroungers and rangers .
lemma 3 if x represents the space of all instantiations x i k and p represents the space of the producer , then x = p. proof ( 1 ) l max denotes the maximum distance between two points in space x. by using ( 3 ) to ( 6 ) , we can equate space p to a sphere that has center x h p possessing sub ( x h p ) and radius l max . thus , x subset p .
( 2 ) the following strategy is employed by using the d - gss model : when a member in space p is outside space x , the member will return into space x by setting the variables that violated the bounds to their previous values .
therefore , p subset x .
( 3 ) thus , we conclude that x = p. theorem 4 the costs of instantiations in the group will converge to the global optimum that corresponds to the best instantiation with the lowest cost .
proof in the d - gss model at the hth iteration , ( 1 ) the producer s p behaves according to ( ii ) - ( iv ) in algorithm 1. by applying the d - gso algorithm , we can derive the following : ( 6 ) cost ( xh + 1p ) = min ( cost ( xhp ) , cost ( xz ) , cost ( xr ) , cost ( xl )) , ( 2 ) the scroungers x h + 1 s will approach the producer through ( vii ) in algorithm 1 , ( 3 ) the rangers x h + 1 r will disperse from a group to perform random walks via ( viii ) and ( ix ) in algorithm 1 to avoid entrapments in the local minima , ( 4 ) finally , we calculate the costs of all instantiations in the group and reallocate their roles .
the cost of the new producer is shown as follows : ( 7 ) cost ( xh + 1p )= min ( cost ( xh + 1p ) , cost ( xh + 1s ) , cost ( xh + 1r )) .
we conclude that cost ( x h + 1 p ) <= cost ( x h p ) by using ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , which means that the cost of the producer is monotonically decreasing .
a global optimum , which has the lowest cost in all instantiations , exists .
as stated in the proof of lemma 3 , x = p. therefore , the infimum of cost ( x p ) is cost ( global optimum ) ; that is , after n iterations , the instantiation x p converges to the global optimum .
5.2 .
simulation convergence results the parameter setting of the d - gss model is summarized as follows .
m classes of generic services are present in the complex composition component , in which each class has 50 candidate services that has 10 qos attributes .
the service requestor provides 10 qos attribute constraints as well as the weights for each qos attribute .
overall , 51 initial instantiations x i with u ( q t i , q t i ) <= 1 ( 1 <= t <= 10 ) are selected at random in all instantiations .
the initial head angle phi 0 of each individual is set to ( pi / 4 ,... , pi / 4 ) .
the constant a is given by round ( n + 1 ) .
the maximum pursuit angle theta max is pi / a 2 .
the maximum turning angle alpha max is set to theta max / 2 .
suppose n = 10,100 ; the relations between the cost of the producer and the iteration times within 500 runs are shown in figure 2 .
the experimental results show that the cost of the producer always converges to the optimum of the low - or high - dimensional service composition component .
the experiments were conducted on a pc with 2.50 ghz intel processor and 8.0 gb ram .
all programs were written and executed in java .
the operating system was microsoft windows 7 .
6. conclusion in this paper , we describe a new evolutionary approach for multiconstraints service selection on the basis of the d - gss model .
we propose the cost function and the d - gso algorithm for searching the global optimum from discrete instantiations of the service composition component .
the convergence of the d - gss model is verified via several formal proofs and simulations .
this model has an outstanding advantage in terms of solving high - dimensional service composition problems .
in the future , we hope to search for the global optimum under a dynamic heterogeneous environment by using the d - gss model .

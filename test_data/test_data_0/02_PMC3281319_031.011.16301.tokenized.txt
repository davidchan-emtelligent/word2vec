myiasis is the infestation of living vertebrates by fly larvae that feed for at least part of their development on the host 's dead or living tissues , body substances , or ingested food .
the occurrences of traumatic myiasis in humans and animals in urban and rural environments represent serious economic and public health concerns .
this study reports a 49 - year - old tracheostomized man undergoing chemotherapy treatment who was parasitized in the hospital in sao goncalo , rio de janeiro , brazil , by larvae of the screwworm , cochliomyia hominivorax ( coquerel ) ( diptera : calliphoridae ) in the thoracic cavity .
keywords calliphoridae ivermectin myiasis public health introduction the diptera calliphoridae family is one of the main vectors of myiasis in vertebrates .
the larvae of these flies feed on the host 's dead or living tissue , body substances , or ingested food during part or all of their immature period ( guimaraes and papavero 1999 ) .
myiasis is an infestation that affects animals , including humans , causing serious economic and public health problems ( queiroz et al. 2005 ; batista - da - silva et al. 2009 ) .
according to guimaraes and papavero ( 1999 ) , the type of infestation can be classified by the characteristics of the larva and the damage that it causes : the obligate species parasitize living tissues while the facultative species parasitize necrotic tissues in living individuals .
extensive or chronic wounds or advanced stage wounds with frequent exposure are commonly infested by cochliomyia hominivorax ( coquerel ) ( diptera : calliphoridae ) .
in the literature , myiasis of humans has been associated with low socioeconomic status , alcoholism , mental or neurological diseases , poor personal hygiene , patients with varicose ulcers , diabetes , malnutrition , advanced stages of cancer , pediculosis , immunosuppression , patients with std , patients with gingivitis , and other lesions in the oral cavity and advanced age ( albernaz 1933 ; kaminsky 1993 ; verettas et al. 2008 ) .
other factors such as the presence of domestic animals , mendicancy , unhealthy environments , and even debilitated and bedridden patients also contribute to the emergence of new cases ( batista - da - silva et al. 2009 , 2011 ) .
this study presents a case report of a man with tracheostomy undergoing chemotherapy at the national cancer institute ( inca - rj ) , hospitalized in a public hospital in sao goncalo , rio de janeiro , brazil , for the treatment of a secondary disease , where he was then parasitized by fly larvae causing obligate myiasis .
materials and methods the patient was a 49 - year - old single man who resided in an urban area of sao goncalo , rio de janeiro , brazil .
he was an ex - alcoholic , bedridden , tracheostomized due to carcinoma of the neck , and was undergoing chemotherapy at the national cancer institute - rj ( inca ) .
during the winter of 2008 ( june ) , he was temporarily hospitalized in a ward of a public hospital in sao goncalo for the treatment of a secondary disease .

human myiasis caused by cochliomyia hominivorax in a man with tracheostomy ; ( a ) larva inside the trachea and ( b ) larva coming out of the trachea .
high quality figures are available online .
after eight days of hospitalization , the patient developed an infestation of fly larvae in the thoracic cavity ( figures 1a , 1b ) .
this infestation was the result of oviposition by flies that entered through open unscreened hospital windows .
medical staff prescribed ivermectin ( 12 mg / 54 kg ) in a single oral dose according to description , dosage , and directions to kill the larvae .
the patient , who at the time was in a collective ward , was moved to a single room with air - conditioning ( 21 degreesc ) .
a total of 32 larvae ( third instar ) were collected and placed in individual pots and covered with cotton under environmental conditions in a ventilated area to wait for adult emergence .
after emergence , adults were sent to the laboratory of leishmaniasis transmitters ( department of medical and forensic entomology ) at the institute oswaldo cruz ioc / fiocruz , rj , brazil , to be identified in accordance with the key to genera and species ( mello 2003 ) .
temperature and rh ( http :// satelite.cptec.inpe.br 2008 ) were collected for twelve days ; mean and standard deviations were calculated for the same data during the pupal stage until the emergence of the adults .
results all 32 larvae that were collected from the patient , the bed , and off the floor of the ward were in the third instar , and all had pupated .
during this stage , the pupae , under environmental conditions in a ventilated area , were observed daily to see if the variables ( temperature and rh ) would interfere with the pupal stage or whether there would be any delayed effects caused by the ivermectin on the insects .
the total pupation period lasted 12 days for all larvae , with an average temperature of 19.9 - - 3.21 degreesc and 82 - - 13.95 % rh. all individuals were identified as belonging to species c. hominivorax .
the use of ivermectin to kill third instar larvae in the patient did not interfere in its life cycle ; however , the lower winter temperatures increased the pupal stage , which normally lasts an average of eight days ( neves et al. 2000 ) .
in contrast , the average rh was favorable to the development of larvae and emergence of adult flies .
discussion the patient was undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer .
complete laryngectomy ( removal of the larynx ) results in the loss of physiological voice and definitive tracheostomy ( artificial opening in the trachea below the larynx ) .
as preservation of voice quality is a top priority , sometimes radiotherapy is used first , leaving surgery until later if radiotherapy is not sufficient to control the tumor ( inca 2010 ) .
open wounds and bodily orifices that emit odors of natural secretions are major factors in susceptibility to myiasis ( batista - da - silva et al .
2011 ) , as they provide a favorable environment for the attraction and oviposition of flies .
a bedridden patient is possibly at a higher risk for infestation by fly larvae , a suggestion supported by smith and clevenger ( 1986 ) , who reported that the risk of contracting myiasis increases when the patient is immobile or debilitated .
considering that the patient reported in this study presented an infestation by third instar fly larvae on the eighth day of hospitalization , it is possible that the infestation occurred on the third ( 72 hours ) or fourth day ( 96 hours ) after hospitalization .
this provides strong confirmatory support for the results of hira et al .
( 2004 ) , where two patients in kuwait had an infestation more than three days after hospitalization , and according to these authors this case may be considered nosocomial ( hospital - acquired ) by definition .
myiases caused by several species of fly larvae and acquired inside the hospital ( nosocomial ) have been reported in different parts of the world .
smith and clevenger ( 1986 ) reported the occurrence of fly maggots in the nasal cavity of an unconscious 64 - year - old man who had been admitted to hospital 18 days earlier in a diabetic hyperosmolar coma .
the larvae were identified as c. macellaria , an organism commonly associated with myiasis in the united states ( smith and clevenger 1986 ) .
hira et al .
( 2004 ) reported two cases of facultative myiasis in a hospital in kuwait city ; one a case of nasopharyngeal myiasis caused by lucilia sericata and the other a cutaneous myiasis caused by megaselia scalaris .
hardy ( 1951 ) also reported larvae of the m. scalaris invading a one - year - old surgical site on the chest of a patient in hawaii .
the use of ivermectin to kill the larvae has been reported by several authors , and depending on its application ( usage ) it results in a significant reduction of larvae in infested wounds .
ivermectin is a semi - synthetic antibiotic isolated from streptomyces avermitilis ( shinohara et al. 2004 ) .
its use is well - documented in large animals for the control of gastrointestinal and lung parasites , as well as to control infestations of fly larvae .
ivermectin blocks the nerve impulses in the nerve endings by releasing gamma - aminobutyric acid , binding to receptors and causing paralysis and death of larvae ( campbell 1985 ) .
although the literature points out the efficiency of ivermectin in the treatment of myiasis caused by larvae of c. hominivorax , this unique case reports an unsuccessful treatment with ivermectin of a cancer patient with a third instar larvae infestation .
it is possible that ivermectin might be effective against first and second instars and much less effective against more mature third instar larvae .
according to graham ( 1985 ) , early results suggested that ivermectin may be ineffective against c. hominivorax , but more recent studies demonstrated that it can produce a significant reduction in the incidence of navel and scrotal myiasis due to c. hominivorax ( benitez et al. 1997 ; lombardero et al. 1999 ) .
there has been an increasing number of publications reporting that a subcutaneous injection of doramectin ( 200 microg / kg ) was up to 100 % effective as a c. hominivorax prophylactic , preventing infestation of artificial wounds , umbilical or castration wounds of calves , and infestation of post - parturient cows for up to 12 - 14 days post - treatment ( moya - borja et al. 1997 ; anziani et al. 2000 ) .
caproni et al .
( 1998 ) reported a persistent efficacy of doramectin and ivermectin in the prevention of natural c. hominivorax infestations in cattle castrated 10 days after treatment .
the study was conducted in brazil to compare the persistent efficacy of a single subcutaneous injection of doramectin and ivermectin at a dose rate of 200 microg / kg in the prevention of myiasis caused by c. hominivorax larvae in cattle castrated 10 days after treatment and exposed to natural infection in the field .
doramectin had an efficacy higher than 90 % and ivermectina had an efficacy of less than 50 % ( caproni et al. 1998 ) .
anziani et al .
( 2000 ) showed that doramectin provided a reduction in myiasis of 90.9 and 83.3 % at 12 and 15 days after induced infestations of c. hominivorax in calves , respectively , compared to the saline control treatment ( p < 0.01 ) .
in contrast , there were no significant differences in the number of calves with myiasis between those treated with the ivermectin formulations or the saline control .
besides the fact that ivermectin had no effect on third instar larvae observed in this work , another important aspect observed here is the emergence of all adult flies , demonstrating the absence of any delaying effect of ivermectin on the c. hominivorax pupae .
only the low winter temperatures may have caused an increase in the pupal stage .
the mean temperature was 19.9 - - 3.21 degreesc with 100 % emergence in 12 days , which was very similar to data obtained by elwaer and elowni ( 1991 ) , where pupation occurred at a temperature of ~ 20 degreesc , and had 94 % emergence under controlled conditions .
since the patient had no contact with alcohol , tobacco , or antibiotics during hospitalization for treatment of a secondary disease , it is possible that treatment with ivermectin is inefficient against third instar larvae of c. hominivorax .
the occurrence of a case of myiasis caused by c. hominivorax acquired inside the hospital ( nosocomial ) indicates a degree of neglect of the medical service and ignorance of the medical staff on how to control this parasite in a hospital environment .
the primary factor for infestation was from flies that entered through the open , unscreened window .
to avoid similar cases in future , it is imperative that windows screens be used in hospital settings .

an increased risk of posttransplant malignancy has been consistently reported following various solid organ transplants .
the malignancies most commonly encountered are non - melanoma skin cancers , carcinomas of lung or breast and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders .
angiosarcoma , an uncommon vascular mesenchymal neoplasm , is rare in the posttransplant setting .
this report describes two patients who developed high - grade angiosarcoma following a solid organ transplant .
notably , in both patients , the diagnosis of angiosarcoma was preceded by diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder with monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement .
keywords angiosarcoma posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder solid organ transplant issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 background an increased risk of developing malignancy has been observed following solid organ transplantation , with rates and malignancy type closely related to the transplanted organ .
the most common neoplasms encountered are non - melanoma skin cancers ( nmsc ) .
significant increases in incidence of other common malignancies such as lung , breast , and renal cell carcinomas are consistently reported as well [ 1 ] .
while posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( ptld ) is one of the more common malignancies developing in solid organ transplant recipient , angiosarcoma is rare in this setting .
we describe two patients diagnosed with concomitant ptld and angiosarcoma following solid organ transplant .
case i 62 - year - old man with alcoholic cirrhosis initially treated with chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma .
he underwent orthotopic liver transplant in january 2006 .
following transplant , he was maintained on the immunosuppressant tacrolimus .
a routine surveillance mri performed two years later ( april 2008 ) revealed a 3.5 cm left adrenal mass .
systemic imaging , including pet / ct , reported an adrenal mass , splenomegaly ( 18 cm ) and fdg - avid mesenteric and para - aortic lymphadenopathy .
biopsy of the left adrenal mass showed a post - transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( ptld ) , consistent with an epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) negative , monomorphic , diffuse large b - cell lymphoma .
spinal fluid and bone marrow were both unremarkable .
ebv dna was undetectable by pcr .
the tacrolimus dose was decreased by half , and the patient was started on chop chemotherapy ( cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine and prednisone ) with rituximab .
interim evaluation with a pet / ct showed disease progression and treatment was switched to the ice regimen ( ifosfamide , carboplatin and etoposide ) with rituximab .
autologous stem cells were harvested and stored after his ice chemotherapy .
upon completion of chemotherapy , pet / ct demonstrated disease remission and bone marrow biopsy remained negative for lymphoma .
five months later , the patient developed a firm swelling of his upper lip .
a biopsy revealed monophasic diffuse large - b - cell lymphoma with clonal heavy chain rearrangement .
a pet / ct showed fdg avidity in the upper lip and sub - mandibular lymph node .
due to concern for significant local morbidity , he was treated with dexamethasone and a palliative course of radiation .
in view of limited improvement , the radiation was discontinued after only four fractions .
he then received 2 additional cycles of ice with rituximab .
in april 2009 , the patient was admitted for autologous stem cell transplant , following etoposide , carboplatin and thiotepa conditioning .
he tolerated the autologous transplant well , but a subsequent pet / ct showed continued fdg avidity in the upper lip .
local radiation therapy was resumed .
following stem cell transplant , he was maintained on rituximab every three months , the last of which was given in november 2010.in february 2011 , he presented with dyspnea on minimal exertion , abdominal dissension , malignant ascites , and disseminated intravascular coagulation .
imaging revealed a cirrhotic liver , portal hypertension , and a new 23 cm hepatic mass with hemoperitoneum .
biopsy of the liver mass revealed highly atypical cells with hyperchromasia and markedly pleomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and markedly increased mitotic activity including atypical mitotic figures ( figure 1a ) .
immunohistochemical assessment revealed tumor cells to be positive for cd31 ( figure 1b ) and focally positive for cd34 , suggestive of high - grade angiosarcoma .
the cells were negative for hepatocellular specific antigen and human herpes virus 8 ( hhv - 8 ) .
ebv dna was undetectable by pcr .
his hospital stay was further complicated by respiratory failure and renal failure requiring initiation of dialysis .
the patient passed away prior to initiation of systemic therapy .

d ) km cd31 400x : immunohistochemical stain against cd31 ( endothelial marker ) demonstrates with brown staining the neoplastic endothelial cells of this high - grade angiosarcoma ( 400x ) .
case ii a 25 - year - old female with a prolonged history of gastroparesis secondary to intestinal neuronal dysplasia .
after presenting with intestinal pseudo - obstruction in may 2006 , she underwent multiple surgical interventions , including a partial colectomy , lysis of adhesions , resection of ilieo - colic anastomosis , and repeat ilieo - colic anastomosis .
in march 2009 , she presented with intestinal dysmotility and liver failure , ultimately undergoing multi - visceral transplantation ( en bloc transplant of stomach , pancreas , liver , small bowel , and colon ) .
following the transplant , she was maintained on rapamycin for immunosuppression .
ebv dna copies were not detected prior to transplant but quickly rose to 3,500 copies following transplant and upon initiation of immune suppression .
her viral level became undetectable on anti - viral therapy.in september 2012 , she had a colostomy surgery due to abdominal distention and colonic dysmotility .
at the same time , an enlarged left cervical node was noted , and a biopsy was performed .
pathology review of the specimen showed a focal increase in large b cell population , found to be distributed in loose nodules concerning for ptld .
flow cytometry was attempted but failed due to the low cellularity of the specimen .
however , a clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement was detected by pcr , further supporting the possibility of ptld .
in november 2012 , the patient noted rapidly increasing abdominal girth .
ct imaging demonstrated ascites and a 4.8cm ill - defined soft tissue density in the left suprarenal area .
in january 2013 , she underwent resection of the left adrenal mass , a mass around the splenic bed , and of an abdominal deposit .
pathology of these areas showed high - grade angiosarcoma with positive surgical margins ( figure 1c ) .
immunohistochemical stains were positive for cd34 , cd31 ( figure 1d ) , can5.2 , factor viii , c - kit and inhibin .
hhv - 8 immunostaining of the tumor was negative .
post - surgical ct scan on 2 / 2013 showed no evidence of residual disease .
the hospital course was further complicated by rejection , treated with anti - thymocyte globulins ( atg ) and steroids .
her condition continued to worsen with dyspnea and new inferior vena caval and peroneal venous thrombosis .
the patient and family opted for palliative care , and she passed away prior to systemic therapy .
conclusions an increased risk of developing malignancy has been consistently observed following solid organ transplantation , with rates and malignancy type varying on the transplanted organ [ 1 ] .
non - melanoma skin cancers ( nmscs ) are the most common malignancy in transplant recipients and affect up to 10 - 45 % of transplant recipients , depending on race and ultraviolet light exposure [ 1 ] .
squamous cell carcinoma is the most common nmsc .
recipients of renal transplants , the most common solid organ to be transplanted , are the best studied to date in the context of post - transplant malignancies .
in renal transplant recipients , the incidences of the most common cancers ( colon , lung , prostate and breast ) are roughly two - fold higher in the first 3 years after kidney transplantation , when compared to the general population [ 2 ] .
kaposi 's sarcoma and non - hodgkin 's lymphoma are more than 20 - fold higher than in the general population .
when compared to patients on transplant waiting lists , several malignancies rates are more common : nmscs ( 2.6 - fold ) , melanoma ( 2.2 - fold ) , kaposi 's sarcoma ( 9.0 - fold ) and non - hodgkin 's lymphoma ( 3.3 - fold ) .
angiosarcoma is not reported as a unique entity in these studies and is included in the non - skin malignancies not otherwise specified ( nos ) category which accounts for about 3 % of the malignancies developing in the first 3 years following kidney transplant .
the relative rate of each post - transplant malignancy varies depending on the transplanted solid organ .
in 2011 , the u.s. organ procurement and transplantation network and the scientific registry of transplant recipients reported a 2 % incidence of ptld at 5 years post renal - transplant in ebv - negative adult recipients [ 3 ] .
following liver transplant , the rate of ptld is 10.2 % at 5 years , with slightly higher rates in ebv - negative recipients .
in contrast , ptld following heart transplant is relatively infrequent in adult recipients and closely linked to ebv status .
risk of malignancy of any kind is especially high following lung transplant and has been reported to be as high as 15.4 % at 5 years post - transplant .
these observed differences in risk may be due to variations in length and type of immunosuppression given to recipients of the various solid organs .
immunosuppression is often cited as the etiology of the increased risk of malignancy , possibly by conferring susceptibility to viruses implicated in oncogenesis such as ebv , herpes simplex , herpes zoster , hhv8 and polyoma virus [ 4 ] .
other potential mechanisms include direct oncogenesis by the immunosuppressive agents themselves ; for example , the chromosome breaks and nuclear abnormalities observed with azathioprine use [ 5 ] .
hepatic angiosarcoma developing following an extensive cyclophosphamide exposure was reported in a patient treated for polyarteritis nodosa [ 6 ] .
in kidney transplant recipients , immunosuppression with cyclosporine did not confer added risk when compared with azathioprine / steroid treatment , whereas treatment with tacrolimus has been shown to increase the risk approximately two - fold .
induction or anti - rejection therapy with okt3 or atg increases the risk of lymphoma during the first post - transplant year [ 7 ] .
sarcomas are uncommon mesenchymal malignancies and comprise less than 1 % of malignant neoplasms in adults .
80 % of them arise in soft tissues [ 8 , 9 ] .
angiosarcoma is an uncommon type of soft tissue sarcoma , which may rise in a variety of tissues or organs .
a well - documented risk factor for developing angiosarcoma is therapeutic radiation , such as the risk observed 8 - 10 years after breast radiotherapy [ 10 ] .
angiosarcoma has a propensity for early metastases and often presents with an aggressive biologic behavior .
in a series of 67 patients with angiosarcomas , the actuarial 5 year disease - free - survival is 35 % and the 5 year overall survival is 24 % [ 8 ] .
in another series of 82 patients with angiosarcoma , the five - year disease - specific survival is found to be 60 % , with negative prognostic variables including higher tumor grade and tumors arising in areas of lymphedema or prior irradiation [ 9 ] .
similar to the majority of soft tissue sarcomas , the mainstay of therapy is complete surgical resection of the tumor , if operable .
adjuvant therapies such as post - operative radiation to the tumor bed with wide margins are offered to patients with tumors larger than 5cm or to those with positive surgical margins [ 11 ] .
the role of adjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial in soft tissue sarcoma due to lack of consistent survival benefit in studies published to date [ 12 ] .
newer studies evaluating paclitaxel and bevacizumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic angiosarcoma suggest a possible role for these to treat angiosarcoma [ 13 , 14 ] .
post - transplant angiosarcomas are rare and , to date , have been reported in less than 20 solid organ transplant recipients .
in a single - institution prospective database encompassing 1,570 liver transplantations in 1,421 patients from 1985 to 1999 , 125 patients ( 8.8 %) developed de novo tumors , one of them being angiosarcoma [ 15 ] .
the majority of reported patients with post - transplant angiosarcoma have been renal transplant recipients with tumor frequently developing at the site of a previously placed arterio - venous fistula [ 16 ] .
an association has been suggested between angiosarcoma and oncoviruses , such as hhv - 8 , following detection of a viral sequence in the dna of a primary angiosarcoma [ 17 ] .
this association remains controversial , as others have failed to detect similar sequences in either primary [ 18 ] or in post - transplant angiosarcoma [ 19 ] .
in a series of 3 patients with ptld reported by webster et al. , 2 of the patients have ptld as well as angiosarcoma [ 16 ] .
in this series , 1 patient has been identified with an ebv - positive tumor and a second with an elevated ebv titer at the time of diagnosis of disseminated angiosarcoma .
the 2 patients in our paper both had angiosarcomas diagnosed following a prior diagnosis of ptld , and 1 had a positive ebv titer detected at the time of angiosarcoma diagnosis .
both angiosarcomas were found to be negative for hhv - 8 immunostaining .
in summary , the few reported patients with angiosarcoma and ptld vary in type of transplanted organ , immunosuppression therapy and in seropositivity for a possible oncogenic virus .
while the possible association of the rare post - transplant angiosarcomas with ptld may suggest the presence of underlying host variables predisposing the recipients to develop post - transplant malignancies , these are yet to be defined .
assessment of genetic abnormalities in these tumors in the future may inform the possible susceptibility conferring host variables .

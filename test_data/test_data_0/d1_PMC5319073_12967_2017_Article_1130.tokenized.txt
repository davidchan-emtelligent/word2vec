background hiv - 1 - infected long - term nonprogressors ( ltnps ) are characterized by infection with hiv - 1 more than 7 - 10 years , but keeping high cd4 + t cell counts and low viral load in the absence of antiretroviral treatment , while loss of cd4 + t cells and high viral load were observed in the most of hiv - 1 - infected individuals with chronic progressors ( cps ) however , the mechanisms of different clinical outcomes in hiv - 1 infection needs to be further resolved .
methods to identify micrornas ( mirnas ) and their target genes related to distinct clinical outcomes in hiv - 1 infection , we performed the integrative transcriptome analyses in two series gse24022 and gse6740 by geo2r , r , targetscan , mirdb , and cytoscape softwares .
the functional pathways of these differentially expressed mirnas ( dems ) targeting genes were further analyzed with david .
results we identified that 7 and 19 dems in cd4 + t cells of ltnps and cps , respectively , compared with uninfected controls ( ucs ) , but only mir - 630 was higher in cps than that in ltnps .
further , 478 and 799 differentially expressed genes ( degs ) were identified in the group of ltnps and cps , respectively , compared with ucs .
compared to cps , four hundred and twenty - four degs were identified in ltnps .
functional pathway analyses revealed that a close connection with mirna - mrna in hiv - 1 infection that degs were involved in response to virus and immune system process , and rig - i - like receptor signaling pathway , whose dems or degs will be novel biomarkers for prediction of clinical outcomes and therapeutic targets for hiv - 1 .
conclusions integrative transcriptome analyses showed that distinct transcriptional profiles in cd4 + t cells are associated with different clinical outcomes during hiv - 1 infection , and we identified a circulating mir - 630 with potential to predict disease progression , which is necessary to further confirm our findings in the future .

keywords hiv - 1 clinical outcome integrative transcriptome analyses chinese national basic research key project2014cb542502 xu jianqing nsfc81561128008 zhang xiaoyan issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background hiv - 1 infection is characterized by the loss of number and dysfunction of cd4 + t cells and exhibits remarkable differences in clinical outcomes of treatment - naive individuals [ 1 ] .
as chronic progressors ( cps ) or normal progressors ( nps ) , the majority of hiv - 1 - infected patients with progressive virus replication have chronic loss of cd4 + t cells and develop to aids in several years without any antiretroviral therapy ( art ) [ 2 , 3 ] .
however , long - term nonprogressors ( ltnps ) (=~ 5 % of hiv - 1 - infected individuals ) , without progression of aids , maintain normal counts of cd4 + t cells (> 500 cells / mul ) and low viral load ( lvl ) without art for many years [ 4 , 5 ] .
moreover , several studies have found that ltnps display a higher level of hiv - specific cd4 + and cd8 + t cell responses than that in chronic progressors [ 6 , 7 ] , which greatly slows disease progression to aids [ 5 , 8 , 9 ] .
although there are some known protective factors involved inhiv - 1 disease progression or pathogenesis , such as specific protective hla - b * 57 / b * 27 alleles [ 10 ] , the ccr5delta32 [ 11 ] and defective viruses [ 12 ] in ltnps , the mechanisms of nonprogression in hiv - 1 infection remains to be further explored .
mirnas are a class of small non - coding rnas with the length of =~ 22 nucleotides , which plays important roles in post - transcriptional regulation of genes .
mirnas function to pair to 3 ' - untranslated regions ( 3 ' - utr ) of target mrna , and almost all of mirnas result in decreased target mrna levels and / or protein translated [ 13 ] .
mirnas have been demonstrated to suppress hiv - 1 via decreasing hiv dependency factors ( hdfs ) , mir - 198 targets cyclin t1 [ 14 ] , mir - 17 / 92 regulates p300 / cbp - associated factor ( pcaf ) [ 15 ] , and mir - 15a / b , mir - 16 , mir - 20a , mir - 93 , mir - 106b bind to pur - alpha and repress its expression [ 16 ] .
it has also been proposed that mirnas could either directly bind to hiv - 1 rna or affect cellular factors involved in hiv - 1 replication [ 17 ] .
mirnas can also modulate key regulatory molecules related to t cell exhaustion following hiv - 1 infection [ 18 ] .
mir - 9 regulates the expression level of blimp - 1 that considered as a t cell exhaustion marker [ 19 ] , and let - 7 mirnas play a regulatory role in post - transcription of an immune inhibitory molecule , il - 10 [ 20 ] .
mir - 125b , mir - 150 , mir - 223 , mir - 28 and mir - 382 [ 21 ] , and mir - 29a [ 22 ] have high abundance in resting cd4 + t cells , which contributes to inhibition of hiv - 1 .
furthermore , several mirnas in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) and plasma can predict the disease progression of hiv - 1 infection , such as mir - 31 , mir - 200c , mir - 526a , mir - 99a , mir - 503 [ 23 ] , and mir - 150 [ 24 ] .
therefore , identification of deregulated mirna expression profiles in different clinical outcomes of hiv - 1 infection may be useful for further understanding the possible mechanisms associated with disease progression , pathogenesis and immunologic control .
however , there is no evidence that mirna - mrna co - expression profiles in different clinical outcomes of hiv - 1 infection .
considering that cd4 + t cells are target cells of hiv - 1 and the cd4 + t cell counts is employed to surveiller disease progression , we integrated mirna and transcriptomic expression profiles data of cd4 + t cells in two series selected from geo datasets in order to identify mirna - mrna crosstalk in hiv - 1 infection .
we have found numerous hiv - 1 disease progression and pathogenesis - associated mirnas and differentially regulated genes , then we constructed functional network of potential mirna - mrna pairs .
identification of genetic and / or epigenetic biomarkers may not only facilitate understanding of interaction between hiv - 1 and host cd4 + t cells , but lead to develop novel markers for prediction of disease progression or therapeutic targets for hiv - 1 .
methods dataset collection the series gse6740 was downloaded from the gene expression omnibus ( geo ) datasets ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / geo /) , contained 15 gene chips from 5 uninfected controls ( ucs ) , 5 chronic progressors ( cps ) and 5 long - term nonprogressors ( ltnps ) , which was analyzed using the platform , gpl96 ( hg - u133a ) affymetrix human genome u133a array .
the series gse24022 included mirna microarray data of cd4 + t cells from 8 ucs , 7 ltnps and 7 cps , whose platform is agilent - 019118 human mirna microarray 2.0 g4470b ( mirna id version ) .
these samples in the aforementioned series were divided into three comparison groups to perform subsequent analyses : the group of ltnps versus ucs , cps versus ucs , and ltnps versus cps , respectively .
analyses of differentially expressed mirnas ( dems ) and prediction of target genes for the aberrantly mirna expression profile analyses , the web analytical tool , geo2r , was applied to identify dems with fold change ( fc ) > 2.0 and an adjusted p value < 0.01 .
geo2r ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / geo / geo2r ) is an r - based interactive web tool to identify differentially expressed genes via analyzing geo data [ 25 ] .
there are several softwares for prediction of mirna targeting genes , but their algorithms are different and each of them has advantages and disadvantages .
therefore , it is necessary to combine with different software to reduce errors or biases .
in this study , mirna target genes were predicted using targetscan v7.0 ( http :// www.targetscan.org /) [ 26 ] and mirdb v5.0 ( http :// www.mirdb.org / mirdb ) [ 27 ] .
both of them utilize the latest mirna data provided by mirbase v21 .
to reduce false - positive results , only common genes predicted by both softwares were chosen as target genes of deregulated mirna for subsequent analysis .
quality control , data preprocessing and analysis of differentially expressed genes ( degs ) for the analyses of differentially expressed genes , the original data of the series gse6740 were analyzed using the software rv3.2.2 ( https :// www.r - project.org /) .
initially , both index , including relative log expression ( rle ) and the normalized unscaled standard error ( nuse ) , were used to assess the quality of this microarray data [ 28 ] .
then , the method of robust multi - array average ( rma ) was applied to perform background adjustment , normalization and log transformation of the original microarray data [ 29 ] .
finally , the linear models for microarray data ( limma ) package ( http :// bioconductor.org / bioclite.r ) was used to identify differentially expressed genes ( degs ) , which is a software package for constructing linear regression model [ 30 ] .
the genes with fc > 1.5 and an adjusted p value < 0.05 were regarded as degs .
functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis the dysregulated genes in different disease stages were extracted as degs , which needed further functional annotation .
only genes that exhibited significant expression differences ( p value < 0.05 and fc > 1.5 ) were functionally annotated .
these degs were analyzed using database for annotation , visualization , and integrated discovery v6.7 ( david v6.7 ) that is a useful bioinformatics enrichment tool for go terms , kegg pathway , and gene - disease association ( http :// david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov /) [ 31 ] .
to functionally annotate degs identified by the aforementioned three comparison groups , kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) pathway and gene ontology ( go ) were analyzed with david v6.7 [ 32 ] .
cytoscape ( http :// www.cytoscape.org /) was used in mirna - mrna network analysis [ 33 ] .
results identification of dems for prediction of disease progression during hiv - 1 infection through a comprehensive analysis of mirna expression profiling in different disease stages following hiv - 1 infection , a list of aberrantly expressed mirnas was included ( table 1 ). with at least twofold change and fdr - adjust p value of < 0.01 , we identified that 7 differentially expressed mirnas ( dems ) in ltnps , whose mir - 342 was down - regulated and 6 mirnas ( mir - 487b , mir - 212 , mir - 494 , mir - 939 , mir - 1225 and mir - 513a ) were overexpressed in the ltnps , compared with ucs , except of mir - 768 - 5p because it overlaps an annotated snorna ( hbii - 239 ) .
twenty dems were identified between cps and ucs .
twelve mirnas were higher and 7 dems were down - regulated in ucs , compared with cps , whereas mir - 923 that appeared to be a fragment of the 28s rrna was removed , and mir - 768 - 5p overlapped an annotated snorna ( hbii - 239 ) was not included .
however , only mir - 487b was overexpressed in ltnps when 5 up - regulated mirnas that also found in the group of cps versus ucs were excluded .
in addition , only mir - 630 showed significantly differential expression among ltnps , ucs and cps , and the expression level of mir - 630 was higher in cps than that in ltnps and ucs .
it is well known that mir - 630 relates to tumor cell growth , proliferation and metastasis [ 34 , 35 ] , involves in growth arrest of cancer cells [ 36 ] , and can server as a prognostic marker for colorectal cancer [ 37 ] and gastric cancer [ 38 ] , which implies that mir - 630 may be a potential biomarker for prediction of disease progression during hiv - 1 infection .

totally , 1703 common genes were predicted as 7 dems target genes in the group of ltnps versus ucs ; 3006 common genes were predicted for 18 dems in the group of cps versus ucs ; and 175 target genes in the group of ltnps versus cps ( table 1 ) .
after allowing for overlap between groups , 2629 target genes were predicted from differentially expressed mirnas , however , the predicted target gene expression profiles still needed to be analyzed in order to elucidate the real mirna - mrna relationships in a pairwise manner .
next , we downloaded the series gse6740 to perform identification of degs and functional annotation .
to avoid the potential biases caused by inadequate quality of dna array , both rle and nuse box plots were used to check the quality of these dna arrays .
two dna arrays gsm155202 ( c102 , fig. 1b - 1 ) and gsm155224 ( l128 , fig. 1b - 2 ) were excluded by the nuse box plots analysis because of the arrays quality problems , which were not suitable for subsequent analysis .
finally , the gene expression profiles were divided into three different comparison groups , ltnps versus ucs , cps versus ucs , and ltnps versus cps , respectively .
we identified that 478 genes were differentially expressed in ltnps and 9 genes ( rhob , ncoa6 , atp8b1 , ccl4 , sec31b , ptger2 , avpr1b , mpi , and loc285830 ) were up - regulated in ltnps , compared with ucs .
besides , 799 differentially expressed genes ( degs ) were identified in the group of cps versus ucs , and 424 degs were found in the comparison group of ltnps versus cps .
it 's worth noting that 184 unique degs were only identified in the group of ltnps versus cps , including 38 up - regulated genes in ltnps , such as ccl22 , lilrb3 , ccl7 / mcp - 3 , trap1 , tubb1 and klrg1 ; and 146 down - regulated genes , such as tmpo , bst2 , rbx1 , ccna2 , oas2 , foxm1 , ezh2 , paff1 , and so on , which may be involved in disease progression during hiv - 1 infection ( additional file 2 ). fig. 1 rle and nuse box plots of gse6740 .

b nuse box plots .
nuse is a very sensitive measure of noise or variation in the array data .
c chronic progressors , l long - term nonprogressors , n uninfected controls functional pathway analysis of degs in hiv - 1 infection go and kegg pathway analyses were performed with david v6.7 to analyzed the differentially expressed genes ( additional file 1 ) , which revealed that the degs between ltnps and ucs were significantly enriched in plasma membrane , cytoplasm and nucleoplasm , including 9 up - regulated genes ( rhob , ncoa6 , atp8b1 , ccl4 , sec31b , ptger2 , avpr1b , mpi , and loc285830 ) , which involved in plasma membrane part ( go : 0044459 , p value = 0.016 ) and plasma membrane ( go : 0005886 , p value = 0.022 ) .
further , gene ontology biological process ( go bp ) analysis indicated that , compared to ucs , degs were significantly enriched in cps' immune system process ( go : 0002376 , p value = 1.6 x 10 - 8 ) , defense response ( go : 0006952 , p value = 6.1 x 10 - 5 ) , response to other organism ( go : 0051707 , p value = 3.3 x 10 - 13 ) , response to biotic stimulus ( go : 0009607 , p value = 2.7 x 10 - 12 ) , response to virus ( go : 0009615 , p value = 9.2 x 10 - 9 ) , response to external stimulus ( go : 0006954 , p value = 2.6 x 10 - 5 ) , and inflammatory response ( go : 0006954 , p value = 6.6 x 10 - 6 ) .
additionally , go bp analysis showed that degs between cps and ltnps were related to immune system process ( go : 0002376 , p value = 8.5 x 10 - 5 ) , response to other organism ( go : 0051707 , p value = 2.5 x 10 - 6 ) , response to biotic stimulus ( go : 0009607 , p value = 9.9 x 10 - 6 ) , response to virus ( go : 0009615 , p value = 2.5 x 10 - 6 ) , response to external stimulus ( go : 0006954 , p value = 4.1 x 10 - 4 ) , and inflammatory response ( go : 0006954 , p value = 7.1 x 10 - 5 ) , ( additional file 1 ) .
these results indicated that , in the cps group , excessive immune activation may accelerate disease progression in chronic infection ( genes : oas1 , isg15 , ifit1 , ifi27 , ifi44l , and so on. additional file 2 ) .
furthermore , the degs between different groups were also subjected to kegg pathway enrichment analysis .
the kegg pathway , rig - i - like receptor signaling pathway was significantly enriched in cps , compared to ucs ( hsa04622 , p value = 0.0038 ) , and ltnps ( hsa04622 , p value = 0.0039 ) , revealing excessive innate immune response ( genes : azi2 , ddx58 , isg15 and irf7 ) in chronic infection compared to that in nonprogression or negative infection ( table 2 ) .

compared to ucs , we acquired 34 putative down - regulated target genes from up - regulated mirnas that were identified in ltnps , and 84 underexpressed genes in cps ( additional file 2 ) .
the functional annotation of putative target genes showed differentially enriched go terms between ltnps and cps .
the highly enriched bp terms include regulation of cell communication ( go : 0010646 ) , regulation of signal transduction ( go : 0009966 ) , negative regulation of signal transduction ( go : 0009968 ) , regulation of developmental process ( go : 0050793 ) , and positive regulation of cell differentiation ( go : 0045579 ) in ltnps but not ucs , while enzyme linked receptor protein signaling pathway ( go : 0007167 ) , receptor quanylyl cyclase signaling pathway ( go : 0007168 ) , regulation of body fluid level ( go : 0050878 ) , and cellular amino acid derivative metabolic process ( go : 0006575 ) were enriched in cps but not ucs .
in addition , the most enriched mf terms were ion binding ( go : 0043167 ) , quanylate cyclase activity ( go : 0004383 ) , metal ion binding ( go : 0046872 ) , and cation binding ( go : 0043169 ) were in cps , and kegg pathway analysis found two pathways endocytosis and purine metabolism , indicating mirna - regulated genes may be involved in metabolism of chronic progressors ( table 3 ) .
after combining the gene expression profiles of the mirna - mrna pair candidates , the interactive networks of putative mirna - mrna pairs constructed with cytoscape were shown in fig. 2 and additional file 3 .

a mirna - mrna interaction network from the group of ltnps versus ucs ; b mirna - mrna interaction network from the group of cps versus ucs .
cps chronic progressors , ltnps long - term nonprogressors , ucs uninfected controls discussion in our study , we firstly analyzed the differentially mirnas profiles in ltnps , cps and ucs .
based on the cut - off value at > twofold change and the p value at < 0.01 , we investigated that 6 mirnas were differentially expressed both in ltnps and cps , mir - 342 - 5p ( v ) , mir - 212 - 3p (^) , mir - 494 - 3p (^) , mir - 939 - 5p (^) , mir - 1225 - 5p (^) , an mir - 513a - 5p (^) in ltnps and cps , compared with ucs , indicating these deregulated mirnas may be hiv - 1 - specific mirnas of cd4 + t cells following hiv - 1 infection .
we also found that the expression levels of mir - 575 , mir - 574 - 5p , mir - 572 , mir - 513b - 5p , mir - 940 and mir - 638 were higher in cps than that in ucs , although they were not altered between ltnps and cps .
previous evidence indicated that suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 ( socs1 ) protein is a target of mir - 572 [ 39 ] , and miller et al .
[ 40 ] have found that the expression level of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 ( socs1 ) protein in cd4 + t cells is lower in hiv - 1 infected patients than that in healthy people , but socs1 mrna level is higher in hiv - 1 infection , indicating mir - 572 may be related to sustained immune activation that promoted disease progression and pathogenesis following hiv - 1 infection by directly targeting socs1 .
besides , mir - 940 can inhibit the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma via targeting myd88 [ 41 ] that involved in il - 33 mediated type 1 helper t cells ( th1 ) differentiation [ 42 ] ( th1 is pivotal in cellular immunity ) .
we confirmed that let - 7 family was down - regulated in cps compared with ucs , which is consistent to findings of swaminathan et al .
[ 20 ] .
next , we applied targetscan v7.0 and mirdb v5.0 to predict target genes of differentially expressed mirnas and 2629 unique target genes predicted from three different comparison groups .
transcriptomic analysis of ex vivo cd4 + t cells from different clinical outcomes during hiv - 1 infection , like ltnps and cps , we also found higher expression level of interferon - stimulated genes ( isgs ) , such as isg - 15 [ 43 - 45 ] , ifi44 , ifi44l , herc6 , ifi6 , and so on , in cps [ 46 ] , indicating chronic immune activation , which is also differentially expressed between pathogenic ( rhesus macaques [ 47 - 49 ]) and non - pathogenic ( sooty mangabeys [ 50 ] or african green monkeys [ 51 ]) siv infection , demonstrated by highly enriched go terms and kegg pathways , including response to virus ( go : 0009615 ) , immune system process ( 0002376 ) , and rig - i - like receptor signaling pathway ( hsa04622 ) .
our findings confirm earlier studies that showed that a chronic interferon response or immune activation contributed to cd4 + t cells loss , pathogenesis and immune exhaustion in hiv - 1 chronic infection [ 43 , 44 , 52 , 53 ] .
moreover , it has been shown that immune inhibitory molecules , including lag - 3 [ 54 ] and cd160 [ 55 ] , have higher levels in cps than in ltnps and ucs and are involved in immune exhaustion that accelerated hiv - 1 disease progression .
additionally , we also identified 184 unique degs in ltnps , which were involved in hiv / aids disease control or progression , including 38 up - regulated genes such as ccl22 ( a soluble hiv - suppressive factor [ 56 ] , lilrb3 ( related to immune protection for hiv - 1 infection ) [ 57 ] and ccl7 / mcp - 3 ( competed for hiv - 1 gp120 binding ) [ 58 ] , and 146 down - regulated genes such as tmpo ( involved in hiv - 1 tat - induced apoptosis of t cells ) [ 59 ] , bst2 ( increased in siv - infected rhesus monkeys ) [ 60 ] , rbx1 ( involved in proteasomal degradation of apobec3g ) [ 61 ] , ccna2 ( contributed to loss of samhd1 ability to inhibit hiv - 1 ) [ 62 ] and some unreported genes such as foxm1 , ezh2 and paff1 ( additional file 2 ) .
further , we analyzed negatively correlated mirna - mrna pair candidates , and the potential target genes were selected from the series gse6740 .
we identified that thirty - four deregulated target genes with 5 up - regulated mirnas were identified from the group of ltnps versus ucs , and eighty - four repressed target genes from 10 up - regulated mirnas in the group of ltnps versus ucs , whose expression of mirna and target genes showed negative correlation .
the functional annotation revealed that mirna - regulated genes may be involved in metabolic processes in chronic infection .
there are several studies that have shown that down - regulation of cpped1 expression improves glucose metabolism in adipocyte [ 63 ] ; pcp4 plays an anti - apoptotic role in human breast cancer cells [ 64 ] , and cbll1 promotes cell proliferation in the early stages of tumor progression [ 65 ] , whose genes were deregulated in cd4 + t cells of hiv - 1 - infected chronic progressors in our current study .
we also demonstrate that the putative mirna - mrna pair candidates are involved in disease progression and pathogenesis .
inhibitory cytokine il - 10 contributes to dysregulated cytotoxic t cell function to hiv - 1 infection , and il - 10 was verified to be the target gene of let - 7 [ 20 ] , which was down - regulated in cps , compared with ucs .
we have found that dysregulated cd100 in chronic hiv - 1 infection , which is the putative target gene of mir - 1225a - 5p or mir - 513a - 5p .
loss of sema4d / cd100 expression plays key roles in dysfunctional immunity during hiv - 1 infection [ 66 ] .
as the positive modulator of cellular apoptosis [ 67 ] , moap1 was down - regulated in chronic infection , which implied that hiv - 1 might employ cellular mirnas to support persistent infection .
the ubiquitin ligase peli1 encoded by peli1 inversely regulated t lymphocyte activation [ 68 ] , whose expression level was decreased in our study , partly indicating hyperactivation of cd4 + t cells related to pathogenesis in hiv - 1 infection [ 69 ] .
however , we understood that there were limitations in our bioinformatics - based study .
there were only 22 subjects ( 7 ltnps , 7 cps and 8 health controls ) in the series of gse24022 for mirnas analysis and 13 subjects ( 4 ltnps , 4cps and 5 normal controls ) in the series gse6740 for degs .
it is necessary to recruit more subjects in the future .
we also recognized that there were a few differences between two series including the duration of infection , the definitions of disease stages of hiv - 1 infection and chronic progression , viral load and cd4 + t cell counts .
therefore , it is necessary to be confirmed whether the level of deregulated mirnas and putative target genes expression is actually altered in distinct disease progression of hiv - 1 infection .
the bioinformatics - based methods to obtain disease progression - related gene expression profiles and the interactive networks of mirna - mrna pair candidates via integrative analysis of mirna - mrna expression should be applied in integrative analyses of mirna - mrna expression profiles in different stages of hiv - 1 infection , which will not only facilitate the understanding of the genetic basis of interaction between hiv - 1 and host cells , but lead to the development of genetic markers for prediction of disease progression and therapy of hiv - 1 in the future .
conclusions in summary , our integrative bioinformatics study showed that distinct transcriptional profiles in cd4 + t cells , including micrornas and mrnas , associated with different disease progression during hiv - 1 infection , and identified a potential biomarker , mir - 630 , that may be employed to predict disease progression in hiv - 1 infection .

triple negative breast cancer ( tnbc ) has an aggressive clinical behaviour , with a poorer prognosis compared to other subtypes .
recently , tumor - infiltrating lymphocytes ( tils ) have been proposed as a predictive biomarker for a better clinical outcome and pathological response ( pr ) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( nact ) in tnbc .
these data confirm the role of the immune system in the neoplastic progression and in the response to therapy .
we performed a retrospective analysis of 54 pre - nact biopsies of tnbc and compared both the percentage of stromal tils and the degree of pd - l1 expression with the extent of pr to standard nact .
a pathological complete response ( pcr ) was achieved in 35 % of cases .
univariate analysis showed ( i ) a significant association between pd - l1 expression in >= 25 % of neoplastic cells and the achievement of a pcr ( p = 0.024 ) ; ( ii ) a significantly higher frequency of pcr in cases showing >= 50 % stromal tils ( p < 0.001 ) .
however in the multivariate analysis only pd - l1 expression on tumor cells remained significantly associated with pcr ( or = 1,13 ; 95 % ci 1,01 - 1,27 ) , suggesting that the expression of this biomarker could be associated with a subpopulation of tnbc more likely to respond to chemotherapy .
these data need to be confirmed by larger studies .
1. introduction triple negative breast cancer ( tnbc ) accounts for 10 - 20 % of all breast cancers [ 1 ] .
it is often associated with high histological grade , presence of lymphocytic infiltration , high rate of distant metastasis , and a poorer prognosis when compared to other breast cancer subtypes .
tnbc is generally treated with standard chemotherapy regimens , including both anthracyclines and taxanes , either in the metastatic , adjuvant , or neoadjuvant setting .
neoadjuvant chemotherapy [ nact ] is increasingly used in the management of this bc subtype , with pathologic complete response ( pcr ) rate ranging from 30 % to 50 % [ 2 - 4 ] .
these data point to the need of biomarkers that could be useful to identify the subset of patients more prone to achieve a pcr .
in recent reports the presence of tumor - infiltrating lymphocytes ( tils ) has been shown to predict the response of tnbc to nact [ 5 - 7 ] .
moreover , a high number of stromal tils is predictive of a more favorable outcome in this bc subset .
these data underscore the crucial role of the immune system both in the neoplastic progression and in the response to therapy and support the robustness of biomarkers of tumor - immune system interplay in clinical practice [ 8 ] .
the interaction between programmed cell death protein 1 ( pd - 1 ) and its ligand ( pd - l1 ) represents a mechanism of immune escape and a therapeutic target for poor - prognosis malignancies , such as melanoma and non - small - cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) [ 9 ] .
pd - 1 is a transmembrane protein of 40 kda expressed on cd8 + and cd4 + t cells , natural killer ( nk ) cells , b cells , activated monocytes , and dendritic cells [ 10 ] .
it is a negative regulator of the immune system that functions by forming a complex with its ligands ( either pdl1 or pdl2 ) .
only limited and contrasting data on the role of pd - l1 in breast cancer have been reported so far .
in fact , the expression of this marker has been correlated with either a worst [ 11 ] or a better prognosis [ 12 ] .
apart from their prognostic or predictive value , the presence of stromal tils and the expression of pd - l1 are strong markers of immune activation in breast cancer and could be involved in the response to preoperative systemic treatment .
in this study we aimed to investigate the role of pd - l1 expression and stromal tils in predicting the pathological response to nact in tnbc .
we retrospectively analyzed 54 pre - nact biopsies and compared both the percentage of stromal tils and the extent of pd - l1 expression on neoplastic and inflammatory cells with the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy .
2. materials and methods between january 2011 and december 2016 , 54 consecutive patients with tnbc received standard nact ( 4 cycles of doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide q3w followed by 12 cycles of paclitaxel weekly ) at our institutions .
clinical information , including age , clinical stage at diagnosis , type of surgery , and pathologic response , was extracted from the institutional databases .
2.1 .
evaluation of stromal tumor - infiltrating lymphocytes pre - therapy biopsies were retrieved from the pathology departments at the sapienza university teaching hospital and the san giovanni - addolorata hospital .
hematoxylin - eosin stained slides were blindly re - evaluated for the presence of stromal tumor - infiltrating lymphocytes ( tils ) according to a previously published method [ 13 ] .
briefly , tils were quantified as a percentage of the stromal area of the tumor and expressed as a continuous parameter .
2.2 .
evaluation of pd - l1 expression and immunophenotyping of the inflammatory infiltrate serial sections were obtained from each paraffin block for ( i ) immunohistochemical evaluation of pd - l1 expression on both neoplastic and inflammatory cells and ( ii ) immunophenotyping of the inflammatory infiltrate .
pd - l1 immunostains were performed with one of the antibody clones approved for diagnostic assay ( sp142 , rabbit igg , dilution 1 : 200 , catalog # m4420 ; spring bioscience , pleasanton , ca ) [ 14 ] at 1 : 100 dilution , using an automated immunostainer ( benchmark xt , ventana medical system , tucson , az , usa ) with the optiview dab ihc detection kit ( ventana medical systems , tucson , arizona , usa ) according to manufacturer 's instructions .
relevant positive controls ( human tonsils and placenta ) were used for each run of staining .
negative controls were obtained by omitting the primary antibody .
the expression of pd - l1 was evaluated separately on all tumor cells and inflammatory infiltrates .
a minimum of 200 neoplastic cells were present in each biopsy sample .
a positive stain was defined as the presence of membrane staining , either strong or weak , complete or incomplete , in a percentage of cells >= 1 % , that is , the threshold reported for clinical response to pd - l1 inhibitors in non - small - cell lung carcinoma and has also been reported in breast carcinoma [ 15 , 16 ] .
for each biopsy , both the intensity of membrane staining ( scored as 1 + weak , 2 + moderate , and 3 + strong ) and the percentage of positive neoplastic cells were recorded , while only the percentage of positive inflammatory cells was evaluated .
immunophenotyping of the inflammatory infiltrates was carried out with the following antibodies : cd3 for t lymphocytes ( roche , 1 : 100 ) ; cd4 ( 1 : 40 ) for the helper t subset ; cd8 for the cytotoxic t subset ( 1 : 100 ) ; cd20 for b lymphocytes ( 1 : 200 ) cd68 for macrophages ( 1 : 100 ) , and n - cam ( 1 : 100 ) ( all from novocastra , newcastle , uk ) .
four images at 20x original magnification ( accounting for one mm2 of tumor field ) were acquired from the areas of maximum inflammatory infiltrate by the nis elements viewer mounted on a zeiss axioskop 2 microscope .
the number of positive cells / mm2 for each antibody was then manually counted on the acquired images .
2.3 .
evaluation of the pathologic response to nact the degree of pathologic response of each patient to nact was obtained from the pathology reports .
a complete response was defined as the complete disappearance of invasive tumor cells from breast tissue and regional lymph nodes , regardless of the presence of residual ductal carcinoma in situ ( ypt0 / is , ypn0 ) [ 17 , 18 ] .
2.4 .
statistical analysis in the descriptive analysis , quantitative variables were described as mean and range , while qualitative variables were reported as number and percentage .
univariate associations between clinicopathological features and pcr were evaluated using the chi2 test or fisher 's exact test , when appropriate .
to take into account the effects of all variables on pcr , multivariate analysis were performed by a multivariate logistic regression to estimate the adjuster odds ratios ( ors ) .
statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 .
all analyses were performed using sas 9.4 ( sas institute inc. , cary , nc , usa ) .
3. results clinicopathological features of the 54 patients are detailed in table 1 .
briefly , the mean age at diagnosis was 50 years ( range 28 - 75 ) .
in 87 % of cases the pre - nact tumor diameter was larger than 2 cm. axillary node involvement , assessed by echography and confirmed by fine needle aspiration cytology , was present in 24 patients ( 45 %) .
the most common histologic subtype was ductal carcinoma of no special type ( 94 % of cases ) .
all tumors were of high nuclear grade ( g3 ) with a proliferation index >= 50 % in the large majority of cases ( 74 %) .
after nact 30 patients ( 55 %) underwent mastectomy and 24 ( 45 %) had conservative breast surgery , a pcr was achieved in 19 patients ( 35 %) .
3.1 .
tumor - infiltrating lymphocytes and immunophenotype of the inflammatory infiltrates in pre - nact biopsies the results of stromal tils evaluations are detailed in table 2 .
briefly , stromal tils were present in 51 pre - nact biopsies ( 95 %) , with percentages ranging from 2 to 80 % ( figures 1 ( a ) and 1 ( b )) .
twenty - four cases ( 45.5 %) had 50 % or greater stromal tils ( high tils ) and were accordingly classified as lymphocyte predominant breast cancer ( lpbc ) [ 13 ] .
immunophenotyping of the inflammatory infiltrates revealed a predominance of cd3 + t cells in all biopsy samples .
in 36 biopsies ( 70 %) the most represented was the cd8 + subset , followed by the cd4 + subset ( 27 %) .
intriguingly , nk cells were absent in 96 % of biopsies .
3.2 .
expression of pd - l1 on neoplastic and inflammatory cells membrane staining of neoplastic cells was present in 19 pre - nact biopsies ( 35 %) , with an extent ranging from 1 to 90 % ( figures 1 ( c ) and 1 ( d )) .
in over 95 % of these biopsies ( 18 / 19 ) the percentage of pd - l1 positive tumor cells did not exceed 50 % .
the membrane stain scored 3 + in 8 / 19 cases ( 42 %) , 2 + in 5 / 19 ( 26 %) , and 1 + in 6 / 19 ( 32 %) .
pd - l1 staining of inflammatory cells was present in the majority of biopsies ( 44 cases , 81 %) ( figures 1 ( e ) and 1 ( f )) .
univariate analysis showed a significant association between the presence of high stromal tils and the expression of pd - l1 on >= 25 % of tumor cells ( p = 0.008 ) and >= 10 % of inflammatory cells ( p = 0.002 ) ; this association was independent from the prevalent lymphocyte subset ( cd8 + or cd4 +) , and from the cd8 / cd4 ratio .
3.3 .
comparison of histologic and immunohistochemical data with the response to nact a pcr was achieved in 19 patients ( 35 %) .
univariate analysis ( table 2 ) showed a significant association between the expression of pd - l1 in >= 25 % of neoplastic cells and pcr ( p = 0.02 ) .
the presence of pcr was also significantly more frequent in cases showing features of lpbc ( with high tils ) in the pre - nact biopsies ( p < 0.001 ) .
moreover , pcr was achieved in 100 % of patients showing both high tils and expression levels of pd - l1 >= 25 % in neoplastic cells in the pre - nact biopsies ( p = 0.011 , table 3 ) .
at multivariate analysis ( table 4 ) , only pd - l1 expression on tumor cells remained significantly associated with pcr ( p = 0.038 ) with or of 1,13 ( 95 % ci 1,01 - 1,27 ) .
4. discussion the immune system is strongly involved both in the tumor surveillance and in the pathogenesis of breast cancer .
moreover , preexisting immunity against tumor cells is a crucial factor that influences the response to chemotherapy .
it is now believed that preexisting antitumor immunity is activated or enhanced during the initial cycle of chemotherapy .
during the subsequent cycles , together with incoming acquired drug resistance of the tumor cells , the onset of immune resistance mechanisms impairs the efficacy of treatment [ 19 , 20 ] .
due to the high histological grading and mutational load , along with the activation of large amounts of genes implicated in immune function , tnbc seems to be the subtype more likely associated with immune system involvement .
thus , the identification of novel immunological prognostic and predictive biomarkers would be useful to guide the choice of the most appropriate treatment , as well as the optimal timing of surgery , especially in the neoadjuvant setting .
either the presence of stromal tils or the expression of pd - l1 is being actively investigated as prognostic biomarkers in tnbc .
this subset of breast cancer has an aggressive clinical and biological behaviour , with higher risk for early recurrences and a poorer prognosis as compared to the other bc subtypes .
however , in the neoadjuvant setting , the achievement of a pcr after nact is associated with long - term survival .
in this study , we investigated the hypothesis that the presence of high stromal tils and the expression of pd - l1 , both markers of immune activation in the tumor microenvironment , could be associated with the rate of pcr in tnbc .
we evaluated pre - nact core biopsies , which proved to be qualitatively and quantitatively adequate for our analysis .
in our study population , 35 % of patients achieved a pcr , which is in line with recently published literature [ 21 , 22 ] .
on microscopic evaluation of pre - nact core biopsies , tumor cell expression of pd - l1 was observed in 35 % of cases , although at low levels (>= 1 % < 25 % in 15 / 19 biopsies , 79 %) .
our observation on a pure sample of tnbc confirms the results of dill et al .
[ 16 ] who analyzed a large number of bc with various histologic subtypes , showing the highest rate of pd - l1 expression ( 32 %) in tnbc , with only 5 % with diffuse expression on tumor cells (> 50 %) .
pd - l1 expression , both on neoplastic and inflammatory cells , was significantly associated with high stromal tils .
our observation extends the results reported by mori et al .
[ 23 ] , which showed a significant association between pd - l1 expression on tumor cells and percentage of stromal tils on surgical breast specimens , and confirms the parallel behaviour of these immune biomarkers in tnbc .
the limited amount of published reports in pure cohorts of tnbc seems to suggest a favorable prognostic role of pd - l1 , despite some discrepancies .
mori et al .
[ 23 ] demonstrated that the interaction between tils and pd - l1 correlates with a better clinical outcome .
however , when high pd - l1 expression is associated with low levels of stromal tils the prognosis is poor [ 24 ] .
in the study of beckers et al .
[ 25 ] pd - l1 , although associated with a better outcome , failed to show an independent prognostic role in this subset of tumors .
these partial discrepancies could be explained by differences in the choice of clinical outcomes , in the methods of evaluation of pd - l1 expression on neoplastic cells ( membranous versus cytoplasmic ) and the cut - off values adopted , and in the antibodies used and the type of sample evaluated ( core biopsies versus surgical samples ) .
there are only limited data on the predictive value of these two biomarkers in tnbc .
we found that in this breast cancer subtype the concomitant expression of stromal tils and pd - l1 on tumor cells membranes was significantly associated with pcr .
according to our results , a cut - off of pd - l1 membrane expression on >= 25 % of neoplastic cells in pre - neoadjuvant biopsies predicted pcr for tnbc , regardless of staining intensity .
on the contrary , the predictive role of tils showed only a limited power and no statistical association on multivariate analysis .
in light of the preliminary results of the keynote 173 phase ii trial [ 26 ] , reporting a 90 % pcr rate in tnbc treated in this setting with the adjunct of pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy , we hypothesize that tnbc expressing pd - l1 in less than 25 % of tumor cells could represent the subset most likely to benefit from this association .
immunophenotyping of tumor inflammatory microenvironment revealed an excess of cd8 + with a ratio of cd8 / cd4 > 1 , in line with previous reports [ 27 , 28 ] , although this observation did not reach statistical significance probably due to our limited sample size .
additionally , we found negligible amounts of nk cells in pre - nact biopsies , although we cannot exclude the fact that their level could have been increased after the first cycle of chemotherapy due to tumor cells death and the release tumor associated antigens .
in conclusion , we showed that a cut - off value of pd - l1 in >= 25 % of tumor cells predicts pcr in tnbc and to our knowledge our study is the first dealing with an exclusive population of tnbc cases .
a possible explanation for our observation is that pd - l1 expression could be associated with a subpopulation of tnbc with a more aggressive behaviour , likely to respond to chemotherapy .
further studies with larger number of cases are warranted to confirm our findings .

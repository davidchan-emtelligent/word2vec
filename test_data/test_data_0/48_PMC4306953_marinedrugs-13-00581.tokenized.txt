the incorporation pattern of biosynthetic precursors into two structurally unique polyketides , akaeolide and lorneic acid a , was elucidated by feeding experiments with 13c - labeled precursors .
in addition , the draft genome sequence of the producer , streptomyces sp .
nps554 , was performed and the biosynthetic gene clusters for these polyketides were identified .
the putative gene clusters contain all the polyketide synthase ( pks ) domains necessary for assembly of the carbon skeletons .
combined with the 13c - labeling results , gene function prediction enabled us to propose biosynthetic pathways involving unusual carbon - carbon bond formation reactions .
genome analysis also indicated the presence of at least ten orphan type i pks gene clusters that might be responsible for the production of new polyketides .
polyketide marine actinomycete streptomyces biosynthesis genome 1 .
introduction natural products are the essential source of small molecules with various biological activities .
the urgent need for new drugs in response to drug - resistance development among pathogens and increasing incidence rates for cancer have been impelling the discovery of new sources and development of methodology in exploring novel chemical entities [ 1 ] .
because of the declining efficiency in terrestrial microbial metabolite research in recent years , marine research is attracting more attention for a vast reservoir of biological and chemical diversity than ever [ 2 ] .
in particular , marine streptomyces , widely spread in marine environments , has been recognized as an emerging source of new bioactive compounds [ 3 ] .
microbial secondary metabolites are classified largely into several structural types , polyketides , peptides , terpenoids , aminoglycosides , and alkaloids , according to the biosynthetic pathway [ 4 ]. of these , polyketides are the most structurally diverse metabolites commonly produced by actinomycetes .
the carbon skeleton of polyketides is constructed from small building blocks along the assembly line , known as polyketide synthase ( pks ) .
aliphatic polyketides , often associated with numerous substituents and chiral centers , are assembled by modular - type pkss .
this multifunctional enzyme contains catalytic domains necessary for chain elongation with distinct conserved amino acid sequences , which allows prediction of chain length , oxidation level of carbons , and thus the approximate overall structure of final products through annotating the gene functions [ 5 ] .
owing to the accumulation of microbial genomic data in public databases , genome mining has become a powerful tool to screen candidate organisms capable of producing novel metabolites , using specific dna sequences of interest [ 6,7 ] .
in our previous studies , two new unique polyketide classes , akaeolide ( 1 ) and lorneic acids a ( 2 ) and b ( 3 ) were isolated from streptomyces sp .
nps554 collected from marine sediment near the coast of miyazaki , japan ( figure 1 ) .
akaeolide ( 1 ) has an unusual 15 - membered carbocyclic framework containing a beta - keto - delta - lactone unit [ 8 ] .
this compound displays moderate antimicrobial activity against micrococcus luteus with an mic value of 25 mug / ml ( 64 mum ) and cytotoxicity to 3y1 rat fibroblasts with an ic50 value of 8.5 mum .
lorneic acids have a fatty acid - like structure in which a benzene ring is embedded .
they inhibit phosphodiesterases with selectivity toward pde5 with ic50 values of submicromolar range [ 9 ] .
despite the structural rarity of these compounds , biosynthetic origins remain unknown .
we herein report the biosynthesis of akaeolide and lorneic acid elucidated by isotope precursor feeding and by annotation of biosynthetic genes .
annotation of unknown type i pks gene clusters responsible for the production of new polyketides is also presented .
figure 1 structures of akaeolide ( 1 ) and lorneic acids a ( 2 ) and b ( 3 ) .
2. results and discussion 2.1 .
incorporation of 13c - labeled precursors inspection of the carbon connectivity and the position of carbon branches suggested that 1 and 2 were synthesized through the polyketide pathway .
in order to elucidate the biosynthetic origin and incorporation pattern , strain nps554 was cultured in the presence of plausible biosynthetic precursors labeled with carbon - 13 , namely [ 1 - 13c ] acetate , [ 2 - 13c ] acetate , and [ 1 - 13c ] propionate , which could be incorporated into the polyketide backbone via acyl coa carboxylation .
according to our previous study , 1 exists as a mixture of several tautomeric isomers in nmr solvents caused by the enolization at c - 17 , consequently giving multiple 13c signals for each carbon [ 8 ] .
this was undesirable to the quantification of carbon intensity ; therefore , the purified 13c - labeled 1 was converted to the chlorinated derivative 4 which could not undergo isomerization ( figure 2 ) .
figure 2 conversion of akaeolide ( 1 ) to 17 - chloroakaeolide ( 4 ) .
the relative enrichment of each carbon by the incorporation of 13c - labeled precursors was determined by 13c nmr measurement ( table 1 ) .
enrichments at c - 5 , c - 9 , c - 15 , c - 18 , and c - 19 were observed by the feeding of [ 1 - 13c ] acetate while c - 3 , c - 7 , c - 11 , and c - 13 were highly enriched by [ 1 - 13c ] propionate feeding ( table 1 , supplementary figures s1 and s2 ) .
c - 12 and c - 15 were overlapped at 34.7 ppm in the 13c nmr spectrum , but the signal enhancement was ascribed to the incorporation of [ 1 - 13c ] acetate into c - 15 because the three - carbon fragment c - 21 / c - 12 / c - 11 was derived from a propionate as proven by [ 1 - 13c ] propionate incorporation into c - 11 ( figure 3 ) .
figure 3 incorporation of 13c - labeled precursors into akaeolide ( 1 ) and lorneic acid a ( 2 ) .
c - 16 and c - 17 were labeled by [ 2 - 13c ] acetate and c - 15 and c - 18 by [ 1 - 13c ] acetate ( figure 3 ) .
this labeling pattern is inconsistent with normal polyketide chain elongation but could be explained by incorporation of succinate , which can be labeled by 13c - labeled acetates in tca cycle [ 10,11 ] .
however , the feeding of 1,4 - 13c2 - succinic acid gave no signal enhancement for c - 15 and c - 18 of akaeolide ( supplementary figure s2 ) .
therefore , c - 16 and c - 17 should be connected after the polyketide chain assembly .

c - 2 was chosen as an unlabeled carbon for 17 - chloroakaeolide and c - 16 for lorneic acids .
the numbers in bold type indicate 13c - enriched atoms from 13c - labeled precursors .
biosynthetic origin of lorneic acid a ( 2 ) was similarly elucidated by feeding experiments with [ 1 - 13c ] acetate and [ 1 - 13c ] propionate .
the relative enrichment of each carbon by the incorporation of 13c - labeled precursors is summarized in table 1 .
enrichments at c - 1 , c - 3 , c - 5 , c - 9 , c - 11 , c - 13 , and c - 15 were observed with the incorporation of [ 1 - 13c ] acetate , while only c - 7 was labeled by [ 1 - 13c ] propionate feeding ( supplementary figure s3 ) .
this labeling pattern obviously indicates that the carbon chain extension begins with c - 16 / c - 15 acetate , followed by the condensation of three malonates , one methylmalonate , and three malonates , and terminates at c - 1 ( figure 3 ) .
2.2 .
genome analysis and annotation of biosynthetic genes akaeolide ( 1 ) and lorneic acids ( 2 and 3 ) are synthesized through the polyketide pathway .
our next attention was focused on how the extra c - c bond is formed in akaeolide biosynthesis and how the benzene ring of lorneic acids is constructed from a linear precursor .
to get insight into more detailed biosynthetic mechanism , whole genome shotgun sequencing was carried out for streptomyces sp .
nps554 to identify the biosynthetic gene clusters .
at least twelve modular type i polyketide synthase ( type i pks ) gene clusters are present in the genome ( supplementary table s1 ) .
eight clusters from # 1 to # 8 were completely sequenced but the remaining four clusters , from # 9 to # 12 were partial , likely divided into two or more scaffolds in the draft genome sequences .
since the polyketide backbones of akaeolide and lorneic acids are constructed from one acetate starter unit and seven extender units , each cluster should have eight pks modules .
among the pks gene clusters present in this strain , clusters # 1 and # 6 are comprised of one loading module and seven extension modules , totally eight pks modules .
on the basis of predicted substrates for acyltransferase ( at ) domains and the presence or absence of ketoreductase ( kr ) , dehydratase ( dh ) , and enoylreductase ( er ) domains , clusters # 1 and # 6 could be assigned to lorneic acid and akaeolide biosynthetic clusters , respectively .
2.3 .
biosynthetic gene cluster for akaeolide gene organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for akaeolide ( 1 ) and proposed functions of the pks genes and the neighboring genes are summarized in table 2 .
this gene cluster consists of four pks genes with eight modules ( figure 4a ) .
at domains in loading module ( lm ) , module 3 ( m3 ) , m5 , and m7 have signature amino - acid residues specific to malonyl - coa ( c2 ) , while those of m1 , m2 , and m4 have that for methylmalonyl - coa ( c3 ) [ 12,13 ] .
the signature amino - acid residue of m6 predicted its substrate as an alkylmalonyl - coa , specifically propylmalonyl - coa ( c5 ) in this case as suggested by the structure of the product [ 14,15,16 ] .
these annotation results indicate that the pkss assemble the polyketide carbon chain by sequential incorporation of c2 , c3 , c3 , c2 , c3 , c2 , c5 , and c2 units .
in combination with the results from 13c - labeling experiments , we could propose that the chain extension starts from c - 16 / c - 15 acetate unit , followed by a sequence of condensation with two methylmalonates , one malonate , one methylmalonate , one malonate , and one propylmalonate , and terminates at c - 18 by incorporation of one malonate ( figure 3 ) .
in multimodular type i pks pathways , combination of dh , er , and kr domains in each module regulates the oxidation level of carbons in the polyketide chain [ 5 ] .
this pks cluster has four dh / kr domains and one dh / er / kr domain , corresponding to four double bonds and one saturated methylene formation , respectively , but the actual product has only two double bonds .
dh domains in m3 and m6 are likely not functional ( represented by " dh " in figure 5 ) .
a quite similar gene cluster is present in the genome of lechevalieria aerocolonigenes nbrc 13195t , which will be discussed later ( figure 4b ) .

based on the results obtained from gene analysis ( table 2 ) , biosynthetic pathway for akaeolide is proposed ( figure 5 ) .
first , the polyketide backbone is synthesized by four type i pkss , orf8 - 520 to - 523 containing all the catalytic domains necessary for the construction of the carbon framework .
according to the kr fingerprints rule , both of the kr domains in modules 2 and 6 belong to b1 - type , suggesting that the absolute configuration of hydroxyl groups at c - 5 and c - 11 is " s " and that of the propyl group at c - 4 is " r " [ 17 ] .
the absolute configuration of the methyl group at c - 12 was suggested to be " s " on the basis of amino acid alignment in the er domain of module 2 [ 18 ] .
these predictions were completely consistent with the stereochemistry of the actual natural product .
after the release from the enzyme along with lactone formation , the putative linear product might undergo cyclic ether formation although it was unable to assign any genes responsible for this cyclization reaction only from the annotation data .
two cytochromes p450 would be involved in hydroxylation at c - 10 and oxidation of the methyl group at c - 16 to the aldehyde .
the next step could be carbon - carbon bond formation between the activated methylene c - 17 and the aldehyde at c - 16 .
this reaction would be catalyzed by a putative cyclase orf8 - 525 that was predicted to have a similar function to snoal on the basis of domain homology by interpro [ 19 ] .
snoal is a polyketide cyclase that catalyzes aldol condensation in the biosynthesis of nogalamycin , an aromatic polyketide produced by streptomyces [ 20,21 ] .
after dehydration from the aldol product , orf8 - 535 coding enoylreductase would act to reduce the conjugated c - c double bond between c - 16 and c - 17 .
these functional assignments are mostly reasonable to explain the biosynthesis of akaeolide ( 1 ) .
figure 5 pks domain organization and plausible biosynthetic pathway for akaeolide .
2.4 .
biosynthetic gene cluster for lorneic acid gene organization of the biosynthetic gene cluster for lorneic acids ( 2 and 3 ) is shown in figure 6 and proposed functions of the pks genes and the neighboring genes are summarized in table 3 .
the pks gene cluster is composed of one loading module and seven extension modules ( figure 7 ) .
signature amino - acid residues of at domains [ 12,13 ] predicted the substrate specificity : acetyl - coa ( c2 ) would be loaded onto lm , malonyl - coa ( c2 ) onto m1 , m2 , m3 , m5 , m6 , and m7 , and methylmalonyl - coa ( c3 ) onto m4 .
therefore , the polyketide carbon chain would be assembled by sequential incorporation of c2 , c2 , c2 , c2 , c3 , c2 , c2 , and c2 units , consistent with the results obtained from the 13c - labeling experiments ( figure 3 ) .
the pks cluster contains three dh / er / kr domains in m1 , m2 , and m4 and four dh / kr domains in m3 , m5 , m6 , and m7 , corresponding to three saturated methylene carbons and four double bonds , respectively .
however , the er domain in m4 might be unfunctional if a putative intermediate a ( figure 7 ) were generated as described below [ 22 ] .

annotation of the domain function for the pks genes indicated the formation of a linear polyolefinic acid starting from an acetate to which six malonates and one methylmalonate are condensed ( figure 7 ) .
this polyene intermediate tethered to the pks would have all - trans double bonds because the kr domain in module 5 is b - type [ 23 ] .
after being released from the enzyme , the intermediate would undergo cis / trans - double bond isomerization at c - 6 / c - 7 and cyclization .
orf1 - 257 located downstream of the pks genes shows high homology to cytochromes p450 , suggesting the involvement of p450 - mediated monooxygenation in the aromatization of the polyolefinic precursor ( a ) and the introduction of a hydroxyl group at c - 11 .
epoxidation of a by orf1 - 257 would give an epoxide ( b ) , which could undergo aromatization through an unknown pathway to provide lorneic acid b ( 3 ) ( figure 7 ) .
further dehydration might afford lorneic acid a ( 2 ) .
this pathway is likely plausible since the addition of one oxygen atom to the intermediate a ( c17h24o2 + o ) can give rise to the intermediate b that has the same molecular formula as that of lorneic acid b ( 3 , c17h24o3 ) .

2.5 .
distribution of biosynthetic gene clusters for akaeolide and lorneic acid in other strains akaeolide ( 1 ) and lorneic acids ( 2 and 3 ) have uncommon structural features , prompting us to investigate the distribution of related biosynthetic genes in other organisms .
homologues of pks genes for akaeolide and lorneic acid biosynthesis were searched in genbank dna database by using blast [ 24 ] .
an orthologous gene cluster to akaeolide cluster was likely present in l. aerocolonigenes nrrl b - 3298t ( table 2 ) but its presence was unclear because the cluster was divided into several contigs ( contig25.1 , contig88.1 , contig59.1 etc. ) and not completely sequenced .
therefore , we undertook genome sequencing of l. aerocolonigenes nbrc 13195t ( the same strain as nrrl b - 3298t , deposited at nbrc , japan ) to obtain the complete gene sequence .
pks domain organization of the akaeolide cluster ortholog in l. aerocolonigenes nbrc 13195t was in good agreement with that of the akaeolide cluster in streptomyces sp .
nps554 ( data not shown ) as well as the synteny of the cluster ( figure 4b ) .
this orthologous cluster present in l. aerocolonigenes might be responsible for the production of mangromicins , congeners of akaeolide , isolated from l. aerocolonigenes k10 - 0216 [ 25 ] .

nps554 in addition to akaeolide and lorneic acid clusters , eight orphan type i pks gene clusters are present in streptomyces sp. strain nps554 ( supplementary table s1 ) .
as for the six clusters completely sequenced , chemical structures of the linear products were predicted on the basis of domain organization ( figure 8 ) and prediction of stereochemistry of methyl and hydroxyl groups was made ( table s1 ) .
clusters # 2 and # 8 were predicted to yield linear polyketides comprising of 24 - and 23 - carbon chain length , respectively , while the products of clusters # 3 and # 4 were much smaller , consisting of less than ten carbons .
the structure of the product from cluster # 7 was not completely predicted since one of the pks modules lacked an at domain .
the side chains r1 and r2 could not be assigned only from the signature amino acid - sequences .
structures of the products from clusters # 9 to # 12 could not be predicted because these clusters were not completely sequenced .
we recently isolated a new polyhydroxylated tetraene - macrolide corresponding to the product from cluster # 5 .
the detailed structure determination will be reported in our forthcoming paper .

whole genome shotgun sequencing whole genomes of streptomyces sp .
nps554 (= nbrc 109706 ) and l. aerocolonigenes nbrc 13195t were read using a combined strategy of shotgun sequencing with gs flx + ( roche ; 58 mb sequences and 7.4 - fold coverage for nps554 , 96 mb sequences and 9.0 - fold coverage for nbrc 13195 ) and paired - end sequencing with miseq ( illumina ; 705 mb sequences and 91 - fold coverage for nps554 , 770 mb sequences and 71 - fold coverage for nbrc 13195 ) .
these reads were assembled using a newbler v2.6 software , and subsequently finished using a genofinisher software [ 26 ] , which led to a final assembly of 26 and 55 scaffold sequences of > 500 bp each for strains nps554 and nbrc 13195 , respectively .
the total size of the nps554 assembly was 7,736,999 bp , with a g + c content of 71.7 % , while that of nbrc 13195 one was 10,698,154 bp , with a g + c content of 68.9 % .

3.7 .
annotation of pks gene clusters the resulting scaffold sequences were submitted to the in - house auto - annotation pipeline .
coding sequences ( cdss ) were predicted by prodigal v2.6 [ 27 ] and searched for domains related to polyketide synthase ( pks ) genes such as ketosynthase ( ks ) domain using the smart and pfam domain databases .
pks gene clusters and their domain organizations were determined as reported [ 28 ] .
gene functions were assigned according to blast searches conducted using the ncbi blastp program [ 24 ] against the non - redundant protein sequences ( nr ) database .
substrates of each acyltransferase ( at ) domains were predicted based on substrate - specific signature amino - acid sequences [ 12,13 ] .
4. conclusions feeding experiments with 13c - labeled precursors elucidated the carbon framework construction of akaeolide ( 1 ) and lorneic acid a ( 2 ) by pks pathway .
draft genome sequencing of the producing strain , streptomyces sp .
nps554 , and annotation of the gene functions allowed identification of pks gene clusters for these type i polyketides and their possible biosynthetic pathways that possibly involve uncommon carbon - carbon bond forming reactions .
future investigation will be directed toward the biochemical analysis of the enzymatic reactions .
the genome sequence data also allowed mining of orphan type i pks gene clusters responsible for the production of unknown polyketides .
all these results indicate the high potential and uniqueness of secondary metabolism in marine actinomycetes , specifically the group of streptomyces .

objective chronic inflammation is considered as one of the contributing mechanisms of lower urinary tract symptoms ( luts ) .
serum c - reactive protein ( crp ) level is the widely used biomarker of inflammatory status .
this study investigated the association between serum crp level in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia ( bph ) and lower urinary tract symptoms ( luts ) before and after medical treatment .
methods a total of 853 men with bph and luts were enrolled .
all patients completed the international prostate symptoms score ( ipss ) questionnaire and urological examinations .
the parameters of uroflowmetry ( maximum flow rate , qmax ; voided volume , vv ) , post - void residual ( pvr ) , total prostate volume ( tpv ) and transition zone index ( tzi ) , serum prostate specific antigen ( psa ) , and serum crp levels were obtained .
all patients were treated with alpha - blocker or antimuscarinic agent based on the ipss voiding to storage subscore ratio ( ipss - v / s ) .
correlation analyses were performed between serum crp levels with age , ipss , tpv , tzi , qmax , pvr , vv , psa and between baseline and post treatment .
results the mean age was 66.9 +/ - 11.6 years old and the mean serum crp levels were 0.31 +/ - 0.43 mg / dl. univariate analyses revealed serum crp levels were significantly associated with age ( p < 0.001 ) , psa levels ( p = 0.005 ) and vv ( p = 0.017 ) , but not significantly associated with tpv ( p = 0.854 ) or pvr ( p = 0.068 ) .
crp levels were positively associated with urgency ( p < 0.001 ) and nocturia ( p < 0.001 ) subscore of ipss , total ipss ( p = 0.008 ) and storage ipss ( p < 0.001 ) and negatively associated with ipss - v / s ratio ( p = 0.014 ) .
multivariate analyses revealed that serum crp levels were significantly associated with age ( p = 0.004 ) and storage ipss subscore p < 0.001 ) .
patients with ipss - v / s < 1 and treated with tolterodine for 3 months had significant decrease of crp levels after treatment .
conclusion serum crp levels are associated with storage luts and sensory bladder disorders , suggesting chronic inflammation might play a role in the patients with storage predominant luts .

introduction international continence society ( ics ) defined lower urinary tract symptoms ( luts ) as three categories including storage , voiding , and post - micturition symptoms [ 1 ] .
in a cohort study consisting of 19,165 individuals in five countries by using the ics definition in 2002 , 62.5 % of men 40 years or older reported at least one luts .
storage symptoms ( 51 %) were more common than voiding symptoms ( 26 %) , and the incidence of all luts increased with age [ 2 ] .
the causes of luts varied with different gender and age groups .
in the male population , benign prostatic hyperplasia ( bph ) was considered the dominant cause of luts in the population aged greater than 60 years .
chronic inflammatory condition is a non - specific term which describes long - lasting or frequent recurrence of inflammation associated with a more specific disease .
subclinical inflammation has been reported to involve in the pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
endothelial dysfunction is believed associated with elevated proinflammatory cytokines in obese men [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
high - sensitivity c - reactive protein ( hs - crp ) level is helpful in predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in asymptomatic people [ 6 ] as well as in men with erectile dysfunction [ 7 ]. from the histological study of the patients enrolled in the reduction by dutasteride of prostate cancer event study ( reduce study ) , chronic inflammation of the prostate was found in 77.6 % of men in prostatic biopsy specimens at baseline and there is evidence of a relationship between the severity of luts and the degree of chronic inflammation [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
however , not all men with luts / bph have urodynamically confirmed bladder outlet obstruction ( boo ) .
overactive bladder ( oab ) symptoms in male luts are often caused by bladder dysfunctions alone or in combination with boo [ 10 ] .
the serum crp level is considered as the surrogate of the chronic inflammation .
in clinical practice , serum crp levels could predict renal involvement in 44 to 83 % of children with febrile urinary tract infection [ 11 ] and was significantly associated with metastatic disease in prostate cancer [ 12 ] .
the associations of serum crp level and clinical luts suggestive of bph ( luts / bph ) and treatment outcome have not been reported before .
the aims of this study are to investigate the association between serum crp levels and luts , and the role of serum crp levels in predicting the medical treatment outcome of voiding or storage predominant luts in men .
materials and methods this study was a retrospective analysis and was approved by buddhist tzu chi general hospital research ethics committee ( tcgh irb 099 - 03 ) .
written informed consent was not obtained from patients because the study was retrospectively performed , which was specifically waived by the approving irb .
a total of 853 men visited the urologic clinic for luts / bph were enrolled in this study .
all patients should have luts , a tpv >= 30 ml and completed the international prostate symptoms score ( ipss ) questionnaire and urological examinations .
the parameters of uroflowmetry ( maximum flow rate , qmax ) , voided volume vv ) , post - void residual ( pvr ) volume , total prostate volume ( tpv ) and transition zone index ( tzi ) measured by transrectal ultrasound , serum prostate specific antigen ( psa ) and serum crp levels were obtained at the initial visit and after 3 - month medical treatment .
serum crp was measured using a cobas integra 400 autoanalyzer and a particle enhanced turbidimetric assay ( cobas integra c - reactive protein latex ; roche diagnostics , madison , wi ) .
assays were performed at the hualien tzu chi general hospital central laboratory .
the lower limit of detection was 0.01 mg / dl and the normal range of the institute was 0.05 to 0.3 mg / dl .
. exclusion criteria included serum crp level >= 3 mg / dl , psa level >= 30 ng / ml without prostatic cancer , known urological malignancy , neurogenic bladder dysfunction and those taking non - steroid anti - inflammatory drugs or aspirin .
the patients were divided into three groups according to the severity of luts as mild ( ipss < 8 ) , moderate ( 8 < ipss < 20 ) and severe ( ipss >= 20 ) luts subgroups .
the ipss was further divided into voiding subscore ( ipss - v ) and storage subscore ( ipss - s ) and the voiding to storage subscore ratio ( ipss - v / s ) .
patients with ipss - v / s > 1 were considered as having emptying disorders and treated with doxazosin 4 mg qd. patients with ipss - v / s < 1 were considered as having bladder storage disorders and treated with tolterodine 4 mg qd [ 13 ] .
all patients underwent the medical treatment for 3 months .
a successful treatment as defined as having a global response assessment ( gra ) increase of 1 or more .
correlation analyses were performed between serum crp levels with age , ipss , tpv , tzi , qmax , pvr , vv , psa , between different luts subgroups , between baseline and post treatment , and between patients with a successful and failed treatment result .
continuous variables are expressed as mean +/ - standard deviation , and categorical data are expressed as number and percentages .
statistical comparisons between the subgroups were tested using chi - square test for categorical variables , and the wilcoxon rank sum test were used for continuous variables .
wilcoxon sign rank test was used to evaluate the significant difference of variables at baseline and after treatment .
pearson 's correlation was implemented to measure the degree of association between two continuous variables .
the variables that might affect the serum crp levels were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression .
all statistical assessments were 2 - sided and considered significant at p < 0.05 .
statistical analyses were performed using spss version 15.0 statistical software ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) .
results the mean age was 66.9 +/ - 11.6 years old and the mean serum crp level was 0.31 +/ - 0.43 mg / dl. in overall patients , serum crp levels were significantly positively associated age ( r2 = 0.139 , p < 0.001 ) , the serum psa levels ( r2 = 0.098 , p = 0.005 ) , and negatively associated with vv ( r2 = - 0.087 , p = 0.017 ) and qmax ( r2 = - 0.08 , p = 0.028 ) ( fig. 1 ) .
however , crp levels were not significantly associated with tpv ( r2 = - 0.006 , p = 0.854 ) , tzi ( r2 = - 0.038 , p = 0.278 ) or pvr ( r2 = 0.068 , p = 0.056 ) .
the mean ipss was 13.6 +/ - 7.2 in overall patients .
when we correlated serum crp levels with each item subscore of ipss , a significant association was only noted in urgency ( r2 = 0.133 , p < 0.001 ) and nocturia ( r2 = 0.122 , p < 0.001 ) , but not in the subscore of incomplete emptying ( r2 = 0.015 , p = 0.665 ) , frequency ( r2 = - 0.003 , p = 0937 ) , intermittency ( r2 = - 0.003 , p = 0.937 ) , weal stream ( r2 = 0.036 , p = 0.297 ) , straining to void ( r2 = 0.025 , p = 0.463 ) or quality of life index ( r2 = 0.014 , p = 0.678 ) .
serum crp levels were positively associated with total ipss ( r2 = 0.091 , p = 0.008 ) and ipss - s ( r2 = 0.151 , p < 0.001 ) , and negatively associated with ipss - v / s ratio ( r2 = - 0.089 , p = 0.014 ) , but not with ipss - v ( r2 = 0.026 , p = 0.457 ) ( fig. 2 ) .
the multivariate model was based on all significant variables in the univariate analysis and showed that only ipss - s ( p < 0.001 ) and age ( p = 0.004 ) were the independent predictors associated with an elevated serum crp level .

ipss : international prostate symptom score .

discussion our study demonstrated that serum crp levels in men with bph and luts increased with age , higher psa levels , the increased severity of luts , smaller voided volume , and higher storage symptoms .
multivariate analysis showed that ipss - s and age were the independent predictors associated with an elevated serum crp level , suggesting increased serum crp level is associated with increased storage luts in men with bph .
luts can result from a complex interplay of pathophysiologic features that include bladder dysfunction and bladder outlet dysfunction .
the male attitudes regarding sexual health ( marsh ) study showed that the overall prevalence of luts was as high as 28 % and storage symptoms are the most frequent subtype ( 13 %) [ 14 ] .
in the epic study , irwin et al also found that storage symptoms were the most prevalent and bothersome symptoms [ 2 ] .
in this study , 74.3 % patients have moderate to severe luts .
in addition , we found the storage symptoms are predominant as in 49.6 % of men with luts and the severity of storage symptoms is associated with the higher serum crp levels in patients .
based on these interesting findings , we suggest that serum crp , which implies the inflammatory condition in subjects , is associated with storage symptoms rather than voiding symptoms in male luts .
ipss - v / s ratio has been demonstrated to impact on phenotype of male luts and initial treatment options .
measuring ipss subscores and calculating ipss - v / s is a simple and useful method to differentiate failure to voiding and failure to storage lower urinary tract dysfunction ( lutd ) in men with luts .
when ipss - v / s was used to differentiate male luts , failure to voiding lutd was found in 81.2 % of patients with ipss - v / s > 1 , while failure to storage lutd was found in 75.7 % of patients with ipss - v / s <= 1 [ 15 ] .
using ipss - v / s > 1 in combination with tpv and qmax provides a stronger predictor for bladder outlet - related lutd than total ipss score [ 16 ] .
initial treatment with doxazosin for patients with ipss - v / s > 1 and tolterodine for patients with ipss - v / s <= 1 has been shown safe and feasible .
[ 13 ] .
the results of this study demonstrate that serum crp levels is significantly associated with urgency and nocturia subscore in ipss , and can provide predictive value for differentiating ipss - v / s > 1 and ipss - v / s < 1 subgroups , however , serum crp level cannot predict a successful treatment outcome for voiding predominant or storage predominant luts .
it is possible that chronic inflammation might also exist in the prostate tissue in patients with ipss - v / s > 1 .
medical treatment with alpha - blocker for 3 months could not reduce he serum crp levels in patients with ipss - v / s > 1 although the clinical symptoms had improved .
however , the inflammation in patients with ipss - v / s < 1 might exist in the bladder or other systems .
antimuscarinic therapy might provide a suppressive effect on both detrusor activity and suburothelial inflammation , therefore , both ipss - s and serum crp levels were significantly decreased .
the same result had been demonstrated in the decrease of urinary nerve growth factor levels in oab patients [ 17 ] .
our data differs from the findings of boston area community health ( bach ) survey , which has emphasized the association between male nocturia and straining and crp [ 18 ] .
in the present study , the serum crp levels positively associated with ipss - s ( p < 0.001 ) and negatively associated with ipss - v / s ratio ( p = 0.014 ) but not the ipss - v. similarly , the results in the cohort study in olmsted county also did not observe the association between of crp level and the increase of obstructive luts [ 19 ] .
according to the multivariate analyses in this study , serum crp was only significantly associated with age and ipss - s , suggesting that chronic inflammation increases with age and affects the bladder storage function that consequently causes decrease of voided volume and higher storage luts .
however , the development of prostatic obstruction is not completely attributed to the chronic inflammation in the prostate tissue , the enlarged prostate glands are the most dominant portion to cause boo and luts .
therefore , serum crp levels are not associated with prostate and uroflow parameters in this cohort study .
although treatment with alpha - blocker can improve voiding luts , this medication might not alter the inflammatory condition in the prostate tissue and , therefore , cannot significantly reduce crp levels after treatment .
chronic inflammation has been considered as the aging process and has contribution to the development of prostate enlargement .
chronic inflammation is commonly seen in the prostate biopsy specimens , ranging from 43 % to 98 % [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
there is evidence of a relationship between the severity of luts and the degree of chronic inflammation in the prostate [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
in this study , although there is no biopsy specimen to validate the degree of chronic inflammation , the serum crp level was found to increase in men with more severe luts .
these findings suggest the degree of inflammation seems to associate with the severity of luts in the patients with moderate to severe luts / bph .
among the patients with the mild and moderate luts , the elevation of serum crp levels was also found .
patients with mild or moderate luts might attribute to bladder dysfunction rather than the outlet obstruction , therefore , a higher crp level might indicate the presence of inflammation causing storage symptoms .
the role of serum crp in bladder dysfunction has gained specific attention recently .
tyagi et al evaluated urinary cytokines in oab patients and found that multiple cytokines related to inflammation were remarkably elevated in oab patients than controls [ 22 ] .
their findings also supported the concept that chronic inflammation is one of the pathology of bladder storage failure .
our previous studies have shown serum crp levels were significantly higher in subjects with oab or interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome than in controls .
no significant difference in serum crp level was noted between patients with oab and ic / bps .
these results supported the association between chronic inflammation of the urinary bladder in patients with oab or ic / bps [ 23 ] .
bach survey also confirmed a consistent association of increasing crp levels and oab among both men and women [ 24 ] .
in women with oab - wet , higher serum crp levels were also found and they were related to lower qmax and higher body mass indices [ 25 ] .
male luts comprises bladder disorders and bladder outlet disorders .
patients with luts / bph may have single or combined disorders .
since serum crp indicates chronic inflammation , patients with elevated serum crp levels and luts might have chronic inflammation in the lower urinary tract or other systems .
epidemiological studies have revealed a high prevalence rate of oab in patients with metabolic syndrome , obesity , chronic heart failure and diabetes [ 26 ] - [ 28 ] .
systemic inflammation might also increase circulating cytokines and cause oab [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] .
therefore , medical treatment which can reduce inflammation might also improve oab symptoms in male luts .
liao et al have found serum crp levels were significantly associated with residual urgency in the patients with bph after medical treatment .
patients with serum crp levels >= 0.30 mg / dl had more urgency than those with serum crp levels < 0.30 mg / dl [ 31 ] .
in the current study , the serum crp levels were only decreased significantly in the patients with ipss - v / s < 1 .
this result further suggested that serum crp levels are associated with storage luts , which might be due to some unknown mechanism of antimuscarinics on the inflammatory condition in bladder disorders .
conclusion the serum crp levels are associated with the storage predominant luts in the men with luts / bph , suggesting the presence of chronic inflammation in men with luts / bph .
however , we failed to demonstrate the predictive role of serum crp levels in differentiation between bladder disorders and bladder outlet disorders in male luts .

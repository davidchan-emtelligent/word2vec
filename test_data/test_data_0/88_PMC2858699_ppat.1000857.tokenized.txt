the coagulation system is characterized by the sequential and highly localized activation of a series of serine proteases , culminating in the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin , and formation of a fibrin clot .
here we show that c - terminal peptides of thrombin , a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade , constitute a novel class of host defense peptides , released upon proteolysis of thrombin in vitro , and detected in human wounds in vivo .
under physiological conditions , these peptides exert antimicrobial effects against gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria , mediated by membrane lysis , as well as immunomodulatory functions , by inhibiting macrophage responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide .
in mice , they are protective against p. aeruginosa sepsis , as well as lipopolysaccharide - induced shock .
moreover , the thrombin - derived peptides exhibit helical structures upon binding to lipopolysaccharide and can also permeabilize liposomes , features typical of " classical " helical antimicrobial peptides .
these findings provide a novel link between the coagulation system and host - defense peptides , two fundamental biological systems activated in response to injury and microbial invasion .
author summary wounding of the skin and other epithelial barriers represents an ever - present challenge and poses a potential threat for invasive infection and sepsis .
therefore , it is not surprising that evolutionary pressure has maintained and developed multiple host defense systems , involving initial hemostasis and fibrin formation , and the subsequent action of multiple proteins and peptides of our innate immune system .
in humans , the coagulation pathways and those mediating innate immune responses to infections have so far been seen as separate entities .
this view is challenged by the present study , which discloses novel host defense functions of c - terminal peptides of thrombin , a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade .
the thrombin - derived peptides , which are detected in human wounds and fibrin , effectively kill microbes by membrane lysis , but also exert potent immunomodulatory and anti - endotoxic functions .
importantly , these peptides protect against p. aeruginosa sepsis , as well as lipopolysaccharide - induced shock in animal models .
thus , from the perspective of wounding and infection , thrombin , after fulfilling its primary function by generating a first line of defense , the fibrin clot , serves an additional role by the generation of antimicrobial and anti - endotoxic host - defense peptides .
introduction the innate immune system , largely based on antimicrobial peptides , provides a first line of defense against invading microbes [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
during recent years it has become increasingly evident that many cationic and amphipathic antimicrobial peptides , such as defensins and cathelicidins , are multifunctional , also mediating immunomodulatory roles and angiogenesis [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , thus motivating the recent and broader definition host defense peptides ( hdp ) for these members of the innate immune system .
the family of hdps has recently been shown to encompass various bioactive peptides with antimicrobial activities , including proinflammatory and chemotactic chemokines [ 9 ] , neuropeptides [ 10 ] , peptide hormones [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , growth factors [ 13 ] , the anaphylatoxin peptide c3a [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , and kininogen - derived peptides [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
the coagulation cascade represents a fundamental host defense system activated in response to injury and infection [ 19 ] , [ 20 ]. through a series of cascade - like proteinase activation steps , thrombin is formed , leading to fibrinogen degradation and clot formation [ 20 ] .
in addition , thrombin has other physiologic functions in hemostasis ; i.e. , mediating clot stabilization by activation of tafi and activation of transglutaminase ( fxiii ) , providing anticoagulant and antifibrinolytic activities in complex with thrombomodulin , and causing platelet aggregation due to par cleavage [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
moreover , thrombin elicits numerous cellular responses , including increased cam expression and growth factor and cytokine release by endothelial cells , as well as growth stimulation of both smooth muscle and fibroblast cells [ 20 ] .
these pivotal functions of thrombin in host defense , its ubiquitous occurrence in blood and in fibrin networks , the high evolutionary conservation of the enzyme , as well as presence of an amphipathic , cationic and helical c - terminus in the protein [ 19 ] , made us raise the question whether thrombin could constitute a source of hdps released at sites of wounding and infection .
our results indeed show that c - terminal peptides of thrombin constitute a previously undisclosed and significant class of hdps , generated in humans during wounding and with therapeutic potential against infection and septic shock .
results proteolysis of prothrombin and thrombin generates antimicrobial activity to test the hypothesis that prothrombin or its activated forms may generate antimicrobial peptides upon fragmentation , we incubated human prothrombin and thrombin with neutrophil elastase , a major neutral protease released by leukocytes during blood coagulation and inflammation or in response to bacterial products such as endotoxins .
earlier studies have shown that neutrophil elastase acts on proteinase - sensitive regions in human thrombin , generating smaller fragments [ 21 ] .
as judged by the rda assays ( figure 1a ) , digestion of the proteins yielded antimicrobial activity already after 5 min of incubation with the enzyme .
in contrast , the intact mother proteins were inactive .
the activity following proteolysis was still observed after several hours of incubation , suggesting the presence of relatively stable intermediates .
noteworthy , the maximum observed inhibition zones were similar in size to those generated by the classical antimicrobial peptide ll - 37 .
analysis by sds - page ( figure 1b ) showed that the degradation generated several low molecular weight fragments in the range of 5 - 15 kda .
in spite of the known amidolytic properties of thrombin , no detectable antimicrobial activity was detected after prolonged incubation of the enzyme form alone ( not shown ) .
the observation that the zymogen as well as the activated forms generated similar activities , suggests that the antimicrobial epitopes localize to regions in the active enzyme after r271 ( prothrombin numbering ) .

rightmost two lanes show pt and t proteins at 2 microg .
structure - based screening for identification of antimicrobial epitopes in order to identify possible antibacterial peptide regions of prothrombin / thrombin , overlapping peptide sequences comprising 20mers ( figure 2a ) were synthesized and screened for antibacterial activities against the two test bacteria e. coli and p. aeruginosa .
properties common for most antimicrobial peptides include minimum levels of cationicity , amphipathicity , and hydrophobicity [ 5 ] .
taking these structural prerequisites into account , additional peptides comprising regions of high net charge and / or presence of amphipathic helical regions , such as those encompassing the c - terminus , were selected and synthesized ( figure 2a ) .
the experiments showed that particularly peptides derived from the c - terminal region ( peptides 45 - 48 ) were antimicrobial , although other active peptides were also identified ( eg. 9 and 31 ) ( figure 2b ) .
however , at high ionic strength ( 0.1 m nacl ) , only the c - terminal peptides retained their antimicrobial activity against e. coli as well as p. aeruginosa ( figure s1 ) demonstrating that only this region , characterized by a high relative hydrophobicity ( muhrel ) , positive net charge ( znet = + 2 for the most active c - terminal peptides ) ( figure 2b ) and amphipathicity ( figure 2c ) , features typical of classical antimicrobial peptides [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , may generate peptides active against bacteria at physiologic conditions .
corresponding to the antimicrobial activities observed above , only peptides derived from the c - terminal part significantly bound to e. coli lps ( figure 2d ) .

in addition to the regular overlapping peptides , peptide regions of high net charge , and / or content of predicted helical regions ( agadir ; http :// www.embl - heidelberg.de / services / serrano / agadir / agadir - start.html ) were selected .
peptides described in subsequent experiments are also indicated ; gky25 , vfr17 , and the major ~ 11 kda peptide ( amino acids 527 - 622 ) .

peptides ( 5 microg ) were applied to nitrocellulose membranes followed by incubation in pbs ( containing 2 % bovine serum albumin ) with iodinated ( 125i ) - lps .
only peptides from the c - terminal part of prothrombin demonstrated significant binding to lps .
( e ) molecular model of thrombin .
the peptides gky25 ( green - orange , indicated in figure 2a ) and vfr17 ( orange , peptide 48 in figure 2a ) are indicated in the crystal structure of human thrombin ( pdb code 1c5l ) .
( f ) activities of prothrombin ( pt ) , thrombin ( t ) , gky25 and vfr17 on e. coli atcc 25922 .
in viable count assays gky25 and vfr17 displayed significant antibacterial activities .
2x106 cfu / ml of bacteria were incubated in 50 microl with proteins and peptides at a concentration of 3 and 6 microm , respectively .
since the absence of activity of the holoproteins in rda could possibly be attributed to their high molecular weight ( compromising diffusion during the assay ) , the antibacterial results above were further substantiated by matrix - free viable count assays .
the results demonstrated that in contrast to the holoproteins , the selected model peptides vfr17 ( figure 2a ; peptide 48 ) and the longer 25mer peptide gky25 ( indicated in figure 2a ) from the c - terminal part of the enzyme ( both peptides indicated by colors in the 3d model of thrombin ; figure 2e ) , demonstrated significant antibacterial activity ( figure 2f ) , thus corroborating the rda assays above ( figure 1a and figure 2b ) .
in conclusion , lps - binding and antimicrobial data , combined with structural and biophysical considerations clearly indicate a pivotal role of thrombin - derived c - terminal peptides , in the following text denoted " tcp " , for mediating the antimicrobial activity .
definition of low molecular weight fragments generated by degradation of thrombin in parallel to the above structure - based screening approach , studies were undertaken to identify active fragments generated after subjection of thrombin to neutrophil elastase .
rp - hplc separation of elastase - digested thrombin , followed by antibacterial assays using e. coli identified several antibacterial peptide fractions ( figure 3a ) .
combined analyses using maldi - tof , esi - ms / ms , and n - and c - terminal sequencing of fraction no .
38 , which contained the majority of the activity comprising peptides active in high salt , unambiguously identified a major 11041 da fragment comprising the c - terminal 96 amino acids of thrombin ( amino acid 527 - 622 , predicted pi 8.4 , indicated in figure 2a ) .
correspondingly , sds - page identified one single peptide of ~ 11 kda , that contained the c - terminal epitope , as shown by immunoblot analysis using polyclonal antibodies against the c - terminal peptide vfr17 ( figure 3a , rightmost upper panel ) .
gel overlay assays demonstrated that the major antimicrobial peptide of fraction 38 corresponded to one major active peptide , also identified in neutrophil elastase - digested thrombin ( figure 3a , rightmost lower panel ) , showing significantly lower mobility when compared to the c - terminal peptide gky25 , thus reflecting its higher molecular mass .
interestingly , maldi - tof and esi - ms / ms of fraction no .
30 identified the peptide hvfrlkkwiqkvidqfge , described in the previous in vitro screening experiments ( figure 2a and b , peptide 47 ) , as well as a shorter 16 aa long variant ( figure 3a , frlkkwiqkvidqfge ) , both peptides from the c - terminus of thrombin .
the analyses of the less hydrophobic material ( fractions 20 and 21 ) yielded several low molecular weight fragments corresponding to internal , and cationic , sequences of low hydrophobicity and amphipathicity , matching antibacterial regions identified by the previous 20 - mer screening ( table s1 available online and figure 2a ) .
taken together , these results showed that neutrophil elastase generates antimicrobial tcps , of which the major forms comprise a ~ 11 kda fragment of 96 amino acids , but also smaller fragments from the distal helical and amphipathic terminus .

fraction 30 ( lower left ) contained two peaks of masses 2034.78 and 2270.88 , perfectly matching the indicated sequences obtained after esi - ms / ms analysis .
fraction 38 was analyzed by maldi - ms , and subsequently by esi - ms. the esi - ms analysis identified a dominant mass of 11041 corresponding to the 96 - amino acid long peptide n527 - e622 ( indicated in figure 2a ) with two intact disulphide bridges .
a minor mass corresponding to v528 - e622 was also detected by esi - ms / ms. n - and c - terminal sequencing yelded nlpi and egfq , respectively .

finally , peptides of fractions 20 - 21 were predicted using the findpept tool ( www.expasy.org / tools / findpept.html ) ( table s1 ) .
( b ) degradation of thrombin by neutrophil supernatants generates antibacterial activity in rda ( upper inset ) .
rda was performed in low - salt conditions. e. coli ( 4x106 cfu ) was used as test organism .
each 4 mm - diameter well was loaded with 6 microl of material ( c , supernatant only ; t , thrombin only ; t + ns ; thrombin incubated for 30 and 180 min respectively , with neutrophil supernatants ) .
the digests were analysed by sds - page ( 16.5 % tris - tricine gels ) and immunoblotting with antibodies against vfr17 ( lower panel ) .
( c ) prothrombin was digested with the enzymes as indicated for 3 h , and analyzed by sds - page ( 16.5 % tris - tricine gels ) and immunoblotting using antibodies against vfr17 ( ne , neutrophil elastase ; cg , cathepsin g ; pae , p. aeruginosa elastase ) .
( d ) rda results of prothrombin digested with cathepsin g ( cg ) and p. aeruginosa elastase ( pae ) for different time periods .
vfr17 and ll - 37 ( 10 microm ) are shown for comparison .
thrombin - derived c - terminal fragments are generated by human and bacterial proteinases during inflammation , neutrophils release a multitude of enzymes , which could have activity on either thrombin or its proform .
therefore , thrombin was incubated with supernatants from activated neutrophils and the material analysed for antimicrobial activity and generation of tcps .
indeed , antimicrobial activity was found upon proteolysis , while immunoblotting identified several tcps of similar molecular weights as those generated by neutrophil elastase alone ( figure 3b ) .
similar fragments ( figure 3c ) and corresponding antimicrobial activity ( figure 3d ) were also detected when prothrombin was subjected to neutrophil elastase , cathepsin g as well as the bacterial thermolysin - like proteinase of pseudomonas aeruginosa , lasb ( also denoted p. aeruginosa elastase ) [ 22 ] .
interestingly , low molecular weight peptides (~ 3 - 4 kda ) , generated by the latter p. aeruginosa enzyme , co - migrated with the model peptide gky25 ( figure 3c ) .
these results demonstrated that both human and bacterial enzymes may generate tcps , irrespective of the activation state of prothrombin .
c - terminal thrombin peptides are generated ex vivo and in vivo and are protective against infection prothrombin , as many other proteins in plasma , is under meticulous control by antiproteinases in the normal state , preventing its activation and / or degradation .
therefore , we hypothesized that favorable environments promoting tcp formation should comprise i ) localisation as well as concentration of thrombin , and ii ) local release of enzymes , such as neutrophil elastase or bacterial proteinases .
these environments are typical of sites of injury and infection , such as skin wounds , comprising thrombin activation , fibrin formation , bacterial colonization or infection , and subsequent neutrophil influx .
earlier studies have shown that thrombin binds to fibrin clots , and that fibrin acts as a reservoir for active thrombin [ 23 ] .
furthermore , human neutrophils release elastase during clotting , and neutrophils also penetrate fibrin [ 21 ] .
bacteria , such as s. aureus and p. aeruginosa frequently colonize and infect skin wounds , accompanied by excessive proteolysis and activation of neutrophils [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
given this , the production of tcps in fibrin , as well as in sterile or infected biological fluids and wounds was investigated .
the results showed that tcps were formed when fibrin clots were subjected to neutrophil elastase in vitro ( figure 4a ) .
furthermore , a similar ~ 11 kda fragment was detected in fibrin " slough " from a patient with a non - infected chronic venous leg ulcer , indicating that tcps can be found in fibrin in vivo ( figure 4a ) .
analogous results , showing rapid formation of tcps , were obtained using human plasma subjected to proteolysis by neutrophil elastase , thus simulating the high elastase activity observed during wounding ( figure 4b ) .
importantly , tcps were also identified in wound fluid from patients post - surgery , as well as in wound fluid from patients with chronic ( non - infected ) venous leg ulcers ( figure 4b ) .
the latter wounds are always colonized by bacteria such as s. aureus and p. aeruginosa [ 24 ] .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1000857.g004 figure 4 thrombin - derived c - terminal peptides , their presence and antimicrobial effects ex vivo and in vivo .
( a ) fibrin clots were produced from human plasma and incubated with neutrophil elastase for the indicated time periods ( fibrin ) , or obtained from a patient with a venous , non - infected , chronic ulcer ( pf ) , extracted , and analyzed by immunoblotting using polyclonal antibodies against the thrombin c - terminal peptide vfr17 .
( b ) human plasma , incubated with neutrophil elastase for the indicated time periods ( plasma , left panel ) , acute wound fluid ( patients 1 - 2 , awf , middle panel ) , or wound fluid from patients with chronic ulcers ( patients 1 - 6 , cwf , right panel ) was analysed by western blot using polyclonal antibodies against the thrombin c - terminal peptide vfr17 .
( c ) flow cytometry analysis of binding of c - terminal thrombin epitopes to p. aeruginosa bacteria .
bacteria were incubated for 4 h with control plasma ( p ) , human plasma depleted of prothrombin ( dp ) , depleted plasma supplemented with the peptide gky25 , or , acute wound fluid ( awf ) .
binding of c - terminal epitopes to the bacteria was detected using primary antibodies against the c - terminal epitope vfr17 followed by addition of fitc - labeled secondary antibodies .
( d ) visualization of binding and membrane damage by tcps. p. aeruginosa bacteria were incubated ex vivo with human plasma ( p ) , acute wound fluid ( awf ) , or wound fluid from a chronic leg ulcer ( cwf ) , or visualized in vivo in fibrin slough ( cws ) derived from a patient with a chronic ulcer infected by s. aureus .
arrows in p , awf , and cwf point to damaged bacterial membranes .
coccoid bacteria ( indicated by an arrow in cws ) show extensive binding of antibodies directed against the c - terminal peptide vfr17 ( negative and positive bacterial controls , and additional material are found in figure s3 and s4 ) .
( e ) tcps inhibit bacterial growth in human plasma .
control plasma ( p ) , plasma depleted of prothrombin ( dp ) , depleted plasma supplemented with either prothrombin ( dp + pt ) , or gky25 ( dp + gky25 ) ( pt and gky25 at 1.5 microm ) , or control awf or depleted awf ( d - awf ) , were inoculated with p. aeruginosa bacteria under similar conditions as in ( c - d ) .
the multiplication factors at various time points are given .
after incubation , cfus were determined by plating .
experiments were repeated three times and a representative experiment is shown .
( f ) the thrombin c - terminal peptide gky25 significantly increases survival .
mice were injected i.p. with p. aeruginosa bacteria , followed by subcutaneous injection of gky25 or buffer only , after 1 h. the injections were repeated after 24 hours .
treatment with the peptide significantly increased survival ( n = 10 for controls and treated , p = 0.002 ) .
( g ) gky25 suppresses bacterial dissemination to the spleen and kidney .
mice were infected as above , gky25 was administrated subcutaneously after 1 h , and the cfu of p. aeruginosa in spleen and kidney was determined after a time period of 8 h ( n = 10 for controls and treated , p < 0.05 for spleen and kidney. horizontal line indicates median value ) .
next , a series of experiments were performed in order to study the physiological role of tcps in relation to bacterial infection .
first , initial experiments showed that immunoreactive thrombin fragments , including the ~ 11 kda tcp peptide , are proteolytically generated and exclusively bind to bacteria during p. aeruginosa infection of plasma and in presence of fibrin ( figure s2a ) .
facs analysis utilizing antibodies against the c - terminal part of thrombin showed that tcps , either occurring in wound fluid from acute wounds , or generated in human plasma during p. aeruginosa infection , bind to the bacteria similarly to the above described antibacterial c - terminal peptide gky25 ( figure 4c ) .
similar results were obtained using s. aureus ( figure s2b ) .
second , electron microscopy studies employing gold - labeled antibodies demonstrated that tcps are predominantly associated with bacterial surfaces ex vivo and in vivo .
thus , p. aeruginosa grown in plasma or acute wound fluid exhibited disintegrated areas as shown by ejected cytoplasmic material and membrane blebs ( figure 4d , see p and awf ) .
furthermore , c - terminal epitopes of thrombin were found particularly in association with these damaged zones .
similar findings were seen after incubating p. aeruginosa with wound fluid derived from patients with chronic ulcers ( figure 4d , cwf ) , as well after incubating the bacteria with the c - terminal thrombin peptide gky25 ( figure s3 ) .
bacteria grown in plasma or acute wound fluid supplemented with heparin ( shown to block the antimicrobial effects of the two c - terminal , heparin - binding peptides of thrombin described above , gky25 and vfr17 ) were similar to the control bacteria , and did not exhibit either binding of tcps or membrane damage ( figure s3 ) .
additionally , analysis of fibrin slough from a patient with a chronic ulcer infected with p. aeruginosa and s. aureus , identified multiple coccoid bacteria both extracellularly and inside phagocytes ( figure 4d , cws ; figure s4 ) , that all displayed significant binding of immunogold antibodies , demonstrating the existence of tcps at bacterial surfaces in vivo in fibrin from human wounds .
figure 4e ( upper panel ) further shows that the growth of p. aeruginosa is significantly enhanced in plasma depleted of prothrombin , when compared with native control plasma .
furthermore , addition of physiological concentrations of prothrombin , or the peptide gky25 ( at 1.5 microm , equivalent to the physiological prothrombin concentration ) , restored the suppressive effect of plasma on bacterial growth .
acute wound fluid depleted of thrombin and c - terminal fragments also showed increased growth of p. aeruginosa when compared with the control ( figure 4e , lower panel ) .
similar results were obtained with s. aureus ( figure s2c ) .
taken together , these results , and given the above findings on the generation and binding of tcps to bacteria ex vivo and in vivo , unequivocally demonstrate a direct link between occurrence of tcps and suppression of bacterial growth in plasma .
further experiments with the model c - terminal peptide gky25 , exhibiting antibacterial activities similar to the endogenously produced c - terminal peptide hvf18 ( peptide 47 , figure 2a ) , were employed in order to further study a physiological , as well as therapeutic role of tcps .
the mic - levels of gky25 , according to standard ncsla - protocols , were comparable to , and in some cases lower than , those observed for ll - 37 and omiganan ( table s2 available online ) .
since the latter is a highly active and broad - spectrum designed antimicrobial peptide now in phase iii clinical studies , the data on gky25 also implied a possible therapeutic role for tcps .
initial studies revealed no significant permeabilizing effects of gky25 on human erythrocytes ( 60 - 120 microm peptide ) as well as keratinocytes ( up to 60 microm peptide ) in plasma and serum conditions , respectively ( figure s5 ) .
in order to investigate a possible in vivo function of gky25 , we therefore injected this peptide subcutaneously into mice infected intraperitoneally with p. aeruginosa .
compared to the controls , treatment with gky25 yielded a significant increase in survival ( figure 4f ) and significantly lower bacterial numbers in the spleen and kidney of the animals ( figure 4g ) .
taken together , these results demonstrate that tcps constitute a previously undisclosed neo - structure of thrombin , formed in vitro as well as ex vivo in plasma , but also in vivo in human wound fluid and fibrin , exerting antimicrobial activities at physiological concentrations in plasma , and finally , showing significant therapeutic potential .
immunomodulatory roles of tcps as mentioned above , recent evidence shows that hdps trigger a range of immunomodulatory responses .
the observation of lps - binding of tcps ( figure 2d ) , prompted us to investigate possible endotoxin - neutralizing effects of the model peptide gky25 .
slot - binding experiments showed that the peptides bound heparin as well as lps from e. coli and p. aeruginosa ( figure 5a ) .
in a mouse macrophage model , gky25 significantly inhibited no - release of lps - stimulated macrophages ( figure 5b ) , as well as release of tnf - alpha at concentrations below 2 microm ( figure s6 ) .
similar effects on tnf - alpha were noted using human monocyte - derived macrophages ( not shown ) .
in a mouse model of lps - induced shock , gky25 displayed a dramatic improvement on survival ( figure 5c ) .
analyses of cytokines 6 hours after lps injection , showed significant reductions of proinflammatory il - 6 , ifn - gamma , tnf - alpha , and il - 12p70 , whereas il - 10 remained unchanged ( figure 5d ) .
sem analyses of lungs from lps - treated animals demonstrated pulmonary leakage of protein and red blood cells ( see inset in figure 5e ) , an effect completely blocked by gky25 ( figure 5e ) .
the results thus demonstrate that gky25 , like many hdps , is multifunctional ; in addition to its antimicrobial activity it also exerts potent anti - endotoxic and immunomodulatory effects .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1000857.g005 figure 5 lps - binding and immunomodulatory role in vitro and in vivo of thrombin - derived c - terminal peptides .
( a ) gky25 binds heparin and lps .
2 and 5 microg gky25 were applied to nitrocellulose membranes .
these membranes were then blocked in pbs ( containing 2 % bovine serum albumin ) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated in pbs with iodinated ( 125i ) heparin or lps .
unlabeled heparin ( 6 mg / ml ) (+) was added for competition of binding .
ll - 37 was used for comparison .
the membranes were washed ( 3x10 min in pbs ) .
a bas 2000 radioimaging system ( fuji ) was used for visualization of radioactivity .
( b ) gky25 inhibits no production .
raw264.7 macrophages were stimulated with lps from e. coli and p. aeruginosa , in presence of gky25 at the indicated concentrations .
ll - 37 is presented for comparison .
( c ) gky25 significantly increases survival in lps - induced shock .
mice were injected with lps followed by intraperitoneal administration of gky25 ( 200 microg ) .
survival was followed for 7 days .
( n = 9 for controls , n = 10 for treated animals , p < 0.001 ) .
( d ) gky25 attenuates proinflammatory cytokines .
in a separate experiment , mice were sacrificed 6 h after i.p. injection of lps followed by treatment with gky25 ( 200 microg ) or buffer , and the indicated cytokines were analyzed in blood ( n = 9 for controls , n = 10 for treated animals , the p values for the respective cytokines are il - 6 , 0.001 ; ifn - gamma = 0.009 ; tnf , 0.001 ; il - 12p70 , 0.001. il - 10 was not significant. ) .
( e ) lungs were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy 20 h after lps injection i.p. , followed by treatment with gky25 ( 200 microg ) or buffer .
treatment with the peptides blocked leakage of proteins and erythrocytes ( see inset ) ( n = 3 in both groups , and a representative lung section is shown ) .
functional and structural studies of thrombin - derived c - terminal peptides to examine possible peptide - induced permeabilization of bacterial plasma membranes , p. aeruginosa and s. aureus was incubated with gky25 at concentrations yielding complete bacterial killing ( 30 microm ) , and analyzed by electron microscopy ( figure 6a ) .
clear differences in morphology between peptide - treated bacteria and the control were demonstrated .
the peptide caused local perturbations and breaks along p. aeruginosa and s. aureus plasma membranes , and intracellular material was found extracellularly .
these findings were similar to those seen after treatment with ll - 37 ( figure 6a ) .
the data suggest that gky25 acts on bacterial membranes , but do not demonstrate the exact mechanistic events following peptide addition to bacteria , as secondary metabolic effects on bacteria may also trigger bacterial death and membrane destabilization .
however , analogous results were also obtained using the impermeant dye fitc and e. coli as test bacterium ( figure 6b ) demonstrating membrane permeabilisation after exposure to gky25 .
kinetic studies showed that gky25 killed > 90 % of bacteria after 10 minutes , compatible with a direct action on bacterial membranes ( figure s7 ) .
furthermore , circular dichroism ( cd ) spectroscopy was used to study the structure and the organization of the peptides gky25 and vfr17 in solution and on interaction with negatively charged ( bacteria - like ) liposomes as well as e. coli lps .
neither gky25 nor vfr17 adopted an ordered conformation in aqueous solution , however the cd spectra revealed significant structural change , largely induction of helicity , taking place in the presence of negatively charged liposomes ( figure 6c ) , and e. coli lps ( figure 6d ) .
compatible with earlier results , ll - 37 displayed some helicity also in buffer solution [ 26 ] .
similarly to ll - 37 , the two thrombin - derived peptides induced leakage of liposomes , also at high ionic strength ( figure 6e ) .
kinetic analysis showed that ~ 80 % of the maximum leakage was reached within ~ 200 seconds for the two thrombin - derived peptides ( at 1 microm ) ( not shown ) .
considering the above results with gky25 and vfr17 , both containing the crucial helical ( and antimicrobial ) epitope , the results therefore indicate that tcps function like most helical amps such as ll - 37 [ 5 ] , [ 27 ] , by interactions with both the lipid membrane and lps ( possibly also peptidoglycan ) at bacterial surfaces , leading to induction of an alpha - helical conformation , which in turn facilitates membrane interactions , membrane destabilization , and bacterial killing .

( f ) activities of corresponding c - terminal peptides of the indicated coagulation factors .
peptides were tested in rda against the indicated bacteria .
bacteria ( 4x106 cfu ) were inoculated in 0.1 % tsb agarose gels .
each 4 mm - diameter well was loaded with 6 microl of peptide at 100 microm .
the zones of clearance correspond to the inhibitory effect of each peptide after incubation at 37degreesc for 18 - 24 h .
( g ) overlay 3d - model showing the three coagulation factors thrombin , and factor x and ix. the c - terminal parts are indicated .
the tcp structure complies with a gamma - core motif and is evolutionary conserved recently , a multidimensional signature , the gamma - core motif , was identified in multiple classes of cystein - containing amps [ 28 ] .
analysis showed that the 96aa tcp is closely related to this fundamental motif so common in various hdps ( figure s8 ) .
furthermore , this region of thrombin is highly conserved in various species ( figure s9 ) .
next , we compared the antibacterial activities of c - terminal peptide gky25 of thrombin with corresponding peptides from other closely related human coagulation factors ( figure 6f , for sequences see table s3 available online ) .
whereas the peptide from thrombin ( factor ii ) , as well as peptides from factors x and ix were antimicrobial against gram - negative p. aeruginosa and e. coli , gram - positive s. aureus and b. subtilis , as well as the fungus c. albicans ( figure 6f ) , corresponding peptides from factor xi and kallikrein were inactive against these microbes ( not shown ) .
as seen in the 3d model ( figure 6g ) , the coagulation factors ( ii , x , ix ) share a similar overall structure with a helical c - terminal " tail " .
indeed , c - terminals of these factors , as well as factor xi and kallikrein , contain a pattern sequence { ds } - x - [ pfy ] - g - [ fiv ] - y - t - x - v - { c } - [ aeqry ] - x - { r } - x - w - [ il ] - x - { h } - x ( 4,24 ) , which describes an amphipathic structure .
however , only factors ii , x , ix have a positive net charge (+ 3 or more ) in this region ( table s3 available online ) , thus in perfect agreement with the data obtained on the antimicrobial activity ( figure 6f ) .
taken together , these analyses show that the tcp molecule represents a novel structural entity , which is related to other cysteine - linked hdps containing the gamma - core motif , and also found in closely related coagulation factors .
discussion the key finding in this report is the discovery of a novel function of thrombin - derived c - terminal peptides in host defense .
the findings expand the field of innate immunity to thrombin and the coagulation system. from an evolutionary perspective , this function of thrombin is logical , since injury and infection both represent situations necessitating an optimized innate immune system .
hence , from the perspective of wounding , thrombin , after fulfilling its primary function in generating a first line of defense , the fibrin clot , adds expanded functionality this natural physical shield by subsequent generation of antimicrobial and anti - endotoxic hdps upon proteolysis .
the significant and curative effect of a thrombin - derived peptide in a model of lps - induced shock underscores the anti - inflammatory role this novel peptide , and contrasts to the pro - inflammatory actions of other hdps , such as the anaphylatoxin c3a and chemotactic defensins [ 14 ] , [ 29 ] .
thus , during injury and infection , different pathways are activated , employing hdps with multiple and sometimes opposite roles , all balancing and fine - tuning inflammation while counteracting microbial invasion .
recent evidence showing a significant cross - talk between the coagulation and complement systems [ 30 ] further adds biological relevance to the observed generation of c3a and various tcps during inflammation .
tcps further add to the increasingly recognized redundancy of host defense mechanisms , enforcing optimized control of the microbial flora by minimizing the risk for resistance development against one particular hdp , as well as protecting against detrimental effects due to specific hdp deficiencies .
notably , the observation of proteolytic formation of multiple tcp fragments of different lengths parallel previous findings on ll - 37 and c3a [ 14 ] , [ 31 ] , showing that these molecules are further processed while retaining their antimicrobial activity .
although not shown in this study , additional hdps may be released from c - termini of factor x and xi , further increasing the arsenal of hdps and adding to redundancy. from an investigatory standpoint , such concerted action is challenging when it comes to defining roles of a given peptide in vivo .
nevertheless , the suppressive effects of formed tcps on bacterial growth ex vivo , their association with bacterial surfaces ex vivo and in vivo , as well as significant effects of the tcp gky25 under standard ncsla conditions , as well as in an animal model of p. aeruginosa sepsis , clearly indicate an in vivo role for released tcps .
these findings , in concert with the anti - endotoxic and immunomodulatory effects of the peptides in vitro and in vivo , infer interesting therapeutic possibilities for tcps in treatment of local and systemic infections , as well as sepsis .
recent evidence , showing a higher susceptibility to s. aureus infection in mice rendered thrombin - deficient [ 32 ] , is also compatible with the new role in host - defense of thrombin - derived c - terminal peptides revealed here. of relevance is also the increased susceptibility to infection after inhibition of the contact system , linked to abrogated release of kininogen - derived hdps [ 16 ] , but possibly also due to a reduced capability to form tcps and other antimicrobial molecules associated with fibrin networks. of particular clinical relevance is also the finding that tcps are detected in wound fluids from patients with acute surgical wounds , as well as in patients with non - healing wounds .
the latter patient group is characterized by an excessive bacterial colonization e.g. by p. aeruginosa , extensive proteolysis and inflammation [ 24 ] .
although speculative , the noted absence of tcps in some patients could therefore be indicative of a defective host - defense and diminished control of released endotoxins ( local or systemic ) .
thus , apart from therapeutic possibilities , the present findings provide a potential diagnostic marker for inflammation , which is currently under evaluation in larger patient groups .
concerning the immunomodulatory role of tcps , it should be noted that although a direct binding and thus inhibition of lps activity was demonstrated , the observed anti - inflammatory effects could also depend on additional effects by tcps on various intracellular signaling pathways including inhibition of nf - kappab activation. from a structural standpoint , the tcp structure relates to the previously reported gamma - core signature that characterize many cysteine - containing amps [ 28 ] , further supporting the concept of multidimensional signatures in antimicrobial peptides and extending these also to hdps of coagulation factors .
the high degree of conservation of the cysteine - constrained tcp - molecule during evolution also suggests that the tcp structure is , although novel to science , not necessarily new .
interestingly , the 96 - amino acid tcp also contains a peptide region responsible for the well - known growth promoting activity of thrombin [ 33 ] , further adding biological importance to the findings .
it remains to be investigated whether thrombin fragments comprising this region promote cell - growth .
if so , these tcps , generated in response to injury mediate not only microbial evasion and immunomodulation , but also wound closure , three fundamental aspects of host defense .

figure s2 tcps are formed and bind to and inhibit microbes in plasma environment .
( a ) overnight cultures of p. aeruginosa 15159 bacteria were washed , resuspended , and incubated with citrate plasma or a preformed fibrin clot for 4 h at 37degreesc .
the bacterial cells were collected , washed with pbs , and bound proteins and corresponding supernatants were subjected to tris - tricine sds - page under reducing conditions , followed by immunoblotting with antibodies recognizing the c - terminal part of thrombin .
1 and 2 , unbound and bound material in plasma ; 3 and 4 , unbound and bound material after incubation with fibrin .
( b ) flow cytometry analysis of binding of c - terminal thrombin epitopes to s. aureus bacteria .
bacteria were incubated for 4 h with control plasma ( p ) , human plasma depleted of prothrombin ( dp ) , depleted plasma supplemented with the peptide gky25 , or , acute wound fluid ( awf ) .
binding of c - terminal epitopes to the bacteria was detected using primary antibodies against the c - terminal epitope vfr17 followed by addition of fitc - labeled secondary antibodies .
absence of detectable binding of fitc - labeled secondary antibodies to s. aureus in prothrombin - depleted plasma , excludes any significant influence of unspecific protein a based interactions in this experimental system .
likewise , fitc - labeled antibodies alone did not show any significant unspecific binding .
( c ) tcps inhibit growth of s. aureus in human plasma .
similarly as in figure 4e , control plasma ( p ) , plasma depleted of prothrombin ( dp ) , depleted plasma supplemented with either prothrombin ( dp + pt ) , or gky25 ( dp + gky25 ) ( both at 1.5 microm ) were inoculated with s. aureus bacteria .
the multiplication factors at various time points are given .
after incubation , cfus were determined by plating .

figure s3 tcps bind and damage bacteria .
visualization of binding and membrane damage by tcps. p. aeruginosa bacteria alone ( control ) or after incubation with 1.5 microm of gky25 , were analyzed by electron microscopy following negative staining .
p + hep and awf + hep indicate the results obtained after addition of 100 microg / ml heparin during the incubation with human plasma and acute wound fluid , respectively .
absence of tcps at bacterial surfaces as well as membrane damage was noted in the heparin - treated material .
examination of at least 50 different bacterial profiles demonstrated a significant difference between immunogold binding in p and awf sections and corresponding material with heparin .
thus > 80 % of gold particles were associated with bacterial surfaces in p and awf , whereas the material supplemented with heparin contained a low background of particles distributed unspecifically .

though electric field is usually used to control the orientation of dna molecules , it is also of great importance and significance to seek for other triggered methods to control the dna orientation .
here , we design a new strategy for controlling dna orientation in biosensors .
the main idea is to copolymerize dna molecules with responsive polymers that can show swelling / deswelling transitions due to the change of external stimuli , and then graft the copolymers onto an uncharged substrate .
in order to highlight the responsive characteristic , we take thermo - responsive polymers as an example , and reveal multi - responsive behavior and the underlying molecular mechanism of the dna orientation by combining dissipative particle dynamics simulation and molecular theory .
since swelling / deswelling transitions can be also realized by using other stimuli - responsive ( like ph and light ) polymers , the present strategy is universal , which can enrich the methods of controlling dna orientation and may assist with the design of the next generation of biosensors .
biosensors , which transduce a bio - recognition event into measurable electronic or opto - electronic signal , play a crucial role in a wide range of applications , including clinical diagnosis , environmental monitoring , forensic analysis and antiterrorism12345 .
as one of the most important biosensors , double - stranded ( ds ) dna sensors have been studied extensively by electrochemical methods , where controlling orientation is of great significance67 .
previous results have shown that the orientation of end - tethered dsdna on metal substrate can be controlled by alternating current ( ac ) electric field , while single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) cannot89 .
based on the different behaviors of ssdna and dsdna , dna hybridization can be identified101112 .
moreover , dsdna orientation switching dynamics in electric field will become slow when bound with biomarkers , such as nucleic acids , small molecules , ions , and proteins .
the detection and size analysis of these biomarkers can thus be achieved on the basis of this property13141516 .
the application of electric fields provides an especially powerful route in the operation of static surface systems as electronic signals can be rapid and localized to within a few nanometers from the electrode surface8 .
therefore , the use of electric field for controlling the dna orientation has been extensively studied and applied in a number of novel systems171819 .
despite this , one interesting problem occurs : how can we control dna orientation by other methods ?
actually , apart from the electric stimulus , there are many other stimuli in biological systems .
for example , temperature stimulus , which is one of the most studied stimuli for the controlled drug delivery2021 .
especially , poly ( n - isopropylacrylamide ) ( pnipam ) , with the lower critical solution temperature ( lcst ) of 32 degreesc , is the most suitable temperature - sensitive polymer in these systems22 .
however , to our best knowledge , there is nearly no study on using temperature stimuli to control dna orientation in biosensors .
in this work , we propose a new strategy to control the orientation of dna molecules in biosensors , namely , by copolymerizing dna molecules with responsive polymer and then grafting the copolymer onto an uncharged substrate .
in particular , the polymer can undergo swelling / deswelling transitions via altering external stimulus strength .
to illustrate the responsive property , here we use a general thermo - responsive polymer and pnipam in dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) simulation and molecular theory , respectively .
as we will show below , the dna orientation can show dual - and triple - thermo - responsive behaviors under different polymer lengths .
further , we will also reveal the underlying physical mechanism of the responsive behaviors in our new system .
results idea of temperature - sensitive dna orientation design fig. 1 shows the coarse - grained models of different components in our simulations .
the substrate is fabricated by arranging hydrophilic dpd beads ( p ) on a face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) lattice with lattice constant alpha = 0.50 nm23 .
since the potential in dpd is soft - repulsive , the substrate is composed of three layers to avoid the permeation of other beads across it2425 .
the dna molecules used here are double - stranded ones with the length of 4.0 nm (~ 12 bp ) , according to the practical biosensor , where 12 bp dsdna are used to detect protein and small molecule analytes26 .
in theories and simulations , because of the long persistent length ( 50 nm ) of double - stranded dna27 , when the length of dna is short they are often treated as the rigid rods2328 .
besides , some surface beads carry the charge of - e to ensure that the linear charge density is about 1 e / 0.17 nm28 .
further , in order to depict the order degree of dna orientation , we define the order parameter s by calculating the averaged value of dna orientation with respect to z direction : , where theta is the angle between dna molecules and z direction .
the thermo - responsive polymers that are grafted to the substrate and covalently bonded to dna molecules29 are composed of several connected beads ( the number of the beads can be varied , e.g. , there are 20 beads per chain in fig. 1 ) , whose hydrophilicity / hydrophobicity changes with external temperature30 .
thermo - responsive behaviors of dna orientation in simulation as shown in fig. 2a - d , when the temperature is low ( 1.0 t0 ) , the polymers are totally hydrophilic and behave like random - walk chain , which induces the random distribution of their end - grafted dna molecules .
in addition , since the space for each dna molecule under this situation is large due to long polymer length along z direction , the repulsive electrostatic interaction between dna molecules is small and may have little effect on their orientations .
thus the dna orientation is approximately random so that the order parameter s is low .
as the temperature increases , the polymers become weakly hydrophobic , which will make them collapsed .
as a result , the mean length in z direction becomes shorter and the space for dna molecules becomes smaller .
to minimize the electrostatic repulsive interaction as well as the excluded volume interactions , the orientation of dna molecules will tend to be uniform and the order parameter s increases .
but since the hydrophobicity is not very large , there still exist some polymers that are stretched by dna molecules to decrease the electrostatic repulsive interaction ( see snapshots of 1.02 t0 and 1.04 t0 ) .
nevertheless , with a further increase in temperature , the polymers are almost collapsed into globules .
we find that when the collapse of polymers becomes more obvious , the orientation should be more uniform , namely the order parameter increases with increasing the temperature .
however , when the polymers become more and more hydrophobic , as shown in fig. 2a - d ( and supplementary figure 1 ) , to avoid the contact with water , the neighboring polymers may aggregate and crosslink into domains .
the averaged aggregation number which can quantitatively describe the crosslinking degree of polymers will increase with the hydrophobicity of polymers .
since the dna is grafted to the polymers , the crosslinked polymers will enforce the corresponding dna molecules close to each other .
in this case , the uniform orientation of dna molecules is not the most energy - favorable state .
instead , the dna molecules grafted to the same polymeric domain may distribute like flowers ( see fig. 2e,f ) to reduce the distance between each other , and the order parameter s is therefore decreased .
generally , the dna orientation here shows triple - responsive behaviors , i.e , the order parameter is small under low - and high - temperature conditions while it becomes large when the temperature is in middle range .
interestingly , we also notice that the dynamic process of increasing the temperature is also of great importance. fig. 3a ( case i ) shows the case where the temperature gradually increases from 1.0 t0 to 1.1 t0 ( i.e. , the case discussed above ) while fig. 3b ( case ii ) shows the case where the temperature sharply increases from 1.0 t0 to targeted temperature. by comparing fig. 3a with fig. 3b , little difference occurs when the temperature is low .
but there exists notable difference under high temperature .
this is due to the fact that the polymers will quickly collapse into globules in case ii and the radius of globule is very small , which may weaken the crosslinking effect ( see the inset in fig. 3b ) .
as a result , the order parameter will not decrease under this situation .
instead , due to the obvious collapse , it will increase a little with temperature .
actually , this difference again indicates that the obvious crosslinking behavior is the main reason of the decrease of order parameter s at high temperatures in the case i. polymer length effect on dna orientation in simulation further , since the polymer length is one of the most important design parameters in experiments , here we also examine the effect of thermo - responsive polymer length on the dna orientation .
as shown in fig. 4 , for short polymers , the dna order parameter changes very little with temperature .
this is because the collapse is not obvious under this situation ( i.e. , z changes very little , see fig. 4b ) , and the mean space for each dna almost remains the same. with the increase of polymer length , the collapse of polymers under high temperature becomes obvious , which in turn causes the alignment of dna molecules more consistently to minimize the excluded volume interaction and the repulsive electrostatic interaction .
as a result , the orientational order increases with the increase of temperature .
further increase of polymer length may induce the crosslinking behavior at high - temperature regimes .
as shown in fig. 4c , there exist obvious crosslinking polymer domains when the polymer length is 20 and 25 .
therefore , as discussed above , the order parameter will begin to decrease under high temperature .
additionally , when the length is sufficiently long , the crosslinking behavior will become obvious even if the temperature is not very high , which will suppress the increase of the dna order parameter .
therefore under this situation ( e.g. , when the polymer length is 45 , shown in supplementary figure 2a ) , the order parameter will change little and there does not exist the triple - responsive behaviors .
generally , on the basis of above discussion , we may choose the polymer length about 10 to generate dual - thermo - responsive behavior , and the length between 20 and 25 for triple - thermo - responsive behavior .
pnipam length effect on dna orientation in theory in order to obtain more physical insights of the thermo - responsive behaviors of dna orientation , we further use the molecular theory to study the present system .
in our theory , we use pnipam as the specific thermo - responsive polymer , and focus on the conditions of surface coverage sigma = 0.04 nm - 2 and pnipam length l = 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 25 respectively in accordance with those used in simulations .
in fig. 5 , we show the dna order parameter as a function of temperature under five pnipam lengths .
for short pnipam length ( i.e. , l = 5 ) system , the dna order parameter linearly decreases with increasing the temperature without the appearance of obvious transition .
for longer pnipam length ( i.e. , l = 10 , 15 ) system , one obvious transition of the dna order parameter takes place when the temperature increases to a critical value , which is called lower critical solution temperature ( lcst ) .
this transition is so sharp that it is finished within only a few degrees celsius .
for the system with l = 20 , 25 , in addition to the first sharp transition of dna order parameter at lcst ( here we should notice that the lcst of longer pnipam system is smaller than that of shorter pnipam system ) , a second transition appears at a higher temperature , where the dna order parameter begins to decrease again .
this means that the dna order parameter under these two pnipam lengths shows a triple - thermo - responsive behavior .
we conclude that the dna orientation can show different thermo - responsive behaviors under different pnipam lengths .
physical mechanism of thermo - responsive behaviors since the dna orientation can show different thermo - responsive behaviors , it is of great importance to reveal the underlying physical mechanism of these differences .
here we calculate the potential of mean force ( pmf ) and chemical potential under different pnipam lengths .
in our system , there are mainly four kinds of driving forces .
we calculate their pmf by betau ( i ) = - ln q ( i ) , where i = chi , m - s , psi , pi represent pnipam hydrophobicity , maier - saupe interaction ( i.e. , the anisotropic attractive interaction of the rod - like dsdna which is used to improve excluded volume interaction ) 31 , electric interaction and excluded volume interaction , shown in fig. 6a - d , respectively .
the four kinds of pmf show different profiles as a function of temperature under short and long pnipam , which leads to the different thermo - responsive behaviors of dna orientation .
more specifically , for the system of l = 5 , as the temperature increases , the hydrophobicity of pnipam molecules changes very little so that their conformations remain almost the same .
meanwhile , there is no change of space for dna molecules .
as a result , no transition happens to the dna order parameter , and it just decreases a little due to the increase of copolymer conformational entropy as the temperature increases ( see supplementary figure 3 ) .
for longer pnipam system , transitions of the four kinds of pmf take place as the temperature increases , which further induces the transition of the dna order parameter .
here we analyze the triple - thermo - responsive system ( l = 25 ) concretely and focus on the two critical temperatures of 40 degreesc ( lcst ) and 45 degreesc .
at low temperature , pnipam molecules are hydrophilic .
they get hydrophobic as the temperature increases , and shrink a little due to the electrostatic repulsion between the dna molecules .
therefore , the space for dna molecules is large , and they are randomly distributed which results in the low order parameter .
as the temperature rises close to lcst ( 40 degreesc ) , pnipam molecules get much more hydrophobic quickly and the electrostatic repulsion cannot prevent them from sharply collapsing onto substrate to reduce the contact with water .
meanwhile , the dna molecules are dragged into a much smaller space .
as a result , the electrostatic repulsion as well as the excluded volume interaction becomes stronger .
the dna molecules will get much ordered to balance out these interactions .
as the temperature further increases and gets close to the second critical temperature ( 45 degreesc ) , pnipam molecules get more hydrophobic .
this leads to the appearance of the micro - phase separation ( see fig. 6e - g ) , meaning that pnipam molecule domains have formed on the substrate .
dna molecules in domains are so crowded that they escape from each other due to the strong electrostatic repulsion , which results in the decrease of dna order parameter ( see supplementary figure 4 ) .
comparison of simulation and theory results as shown above , we use the dpd simulation and molecular theory to separately study the new designed thermo - responsive system , so it is necessary to compare the main results obtained by the two different methods .
as a whole , the results agree well with each other , namely , for the system with l = 5 , no dna orientation transition takes place with the increase of temperature ; for longer pnipam systems ( l = 10 , 15 ) , the dna orientation shows dual - thermo - responsive behaviors ; for the systems with l = 20 , 25 , the dna orientation shows triple - thermo - responsive behaviors .
however , due to the different characters of thermo - responsive polymers used in simulation and theory ( in simulation , we use general thermo - responsive polymers which get hydrophobic gradually with the increase of temperature ; while in molecular theory , pnipam molecules get hydrophobic quickly and collapse sharply as the temperature gets close to their lcst ) , the transition of the dna order parameter in theory is sharper than that in simulation .
moreover , the thermo - responsive degrees under different polymer lengths in simulation and theory are also slightly different ( e.g. , l = 25 ) .
nevertheless , for the systems with very long polymer ( l = 55 ) , the results by simulations and theory also shows the same trend , i.e. , the dna orientation exhibits no thermo - responsive behaviors ( see supplementary figure 2 ) .
discussion in the present study , we propose a new strategy to control the dna orientation in biosensors and combine dpd simulation and molecular theory to prove its feasibility .
especially , when the thermo - responsive polymer has proper length , the dna orientation is triple - responsive as shown in fig. 7. the order parameter is low at low temperature .
as the temperature increases , the dna molecules get much ordered .
but further increase of temperature leads to the decrease of the dna order parameter .
furthermore , we point out the feasibility and application of our reported strategy in real detections .
firstly , we should notice that the present strategy can also be used to detect the binding of small molecules .
in order to demonstrate this , we also investigate the dna orientation as a function of temperature in the presence of protein , and find that the dna order parameter becomes larger than that in the absence of protein ( see supplementary figure 5 ) .
due to the fact that the variation of dna orientation can be detected by fluorescence energy transfer16 , the detection of proteins may be achieved .
besides , when detecting charged molecules ( e.g. , proteins ) , the present strategy could be more suitable than electric - field method , since the electric field may confuse the binding of charged molecules .
however , when compared with electric - field method , the variation degree of dna orientation in our strategy is not so obvious , which may lead to a lower sensitivity of the detection .
moreover , small molecules may bind to thermo - responsive polymers32 , which will also influence the sensitivity of the detection .
these are beyond the scope of the present work and we will address the above issues in our future works .
finally , we should notice that although thermo - responsive polymers are used in our study , the new strategy here is general because the responsive behavior of dna orientation is just caused by swelling / deswelling transitions of polymers .
therefore , other types of stimuli - responsive polymers can also be used to take place of the thermo - responsive polymers in the system .
for example , by using ph - sensitive polymers like pah2033 , the ph - responsive detectiom can be fabricated , which may be well suited in specific organs ( such as the gastrointestinal tract or the vagina ) or intracellular compartments ( such as endosomes or lysosomes ) ; the light - responsive detection can be synthesized by using photo - sensitive polymer containing o - nitrobenzyl2134 , which may have the advantage of non - invasiveness and the possibility of remote spatiotemporal control .
therefore , our strategy here can enrich the methods of controlling dna orientation .
we expect that the new strategy for controlling dna orientation could be engineered experimentally with the advance of present nanotechnology , and believe that it can promote future development on novel design of biosensors .
methods we briefly summarize the simulation and theory method used in this work and the details can be found in supplementary information .
dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) simulation dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) is a coarse - grained simulation technique with hydrodynamic interaction35 .
the dynamics of the elementary units which are so - called dpd beads , is governed by newton 's equation of motion .
typically , there are three types of pairwise forces in the dpd , i.e. , the conservative force , dissipative force , and random force .
here , in order to include electrostatic interaction between charged beads , the coulomb force is incorporated into our dpd simulations3637 .
additionally , we also use a harmonic bond to ensure the integrality of polymers38 .
all simulations are performed in the nvt ensembles using the velocity - verlet integration algorithm .
since our simulations involve the change of temperature , we choose room temperature as the reference , i.e. , setting kbt0 = 1.0 , where t0 = 298 k. the reduced temperature can be defined as t * = t / t02530 .
the size of the simulation box is 40rc x 40rc x 40rc with the number density of . the integration time step deltat = 0.015tau and each simulation time is at least 105tau .
all simulations in this work are carried out by using the modified soft package lammps ( 12 jun 2011 ) 39 .
molecular theory the molecular theory was previously used to study the thermodynamics and structural properties of end - tethered neutral and charged polymers with the consideration of the conformation , size , and shape of each molecule40 , and was shown to be in quantitative agreement with simulations and experimental observations41 .
more explicitly , the helmholtz free energy per unit area for the systems in fig. 1 is where beta = 1 / kbt is the inverse absolute temperature .
sp is the conformational entropy of copolymer , finter is the effective intermolecular interactions between pnipam segments and water , smix is the translational ( mixing ) entropy of small molecules , including the cations , anions and water , fm - s describes anisotropic interactions for dna in mayer - saupe self - consistent field approximation42 , felec accounts for the electrostatic contribution to the free energy .
each of these terms of free energy can be explicitly expressed as a functional of probability of copolymer conformations , the local density profiles of the small molecules in the solution , the orientation of dna and the electrostatic potential .
then by minimizing the free energy , a series of equations can be obtained , which can be solved by numerical method .
all structural properties can be determined from the probabilities and interaction fields obtained from the minimized free energy , and any thermodynamic quantity of interest can be calculated .
technical details and all the relevant equations of the molecular theory can be found in the supplementary information .

figure 1 schematic illustration of the model in simulations .
the dna molecules are copolymerized with responsive polymers that can show swelling / deswelling transitions under external stimulus and then grafted onto an uncharged substrate .
green beads represent dna molecules , yellow beads stand for the thermo - responsive polymers , while the planar substrate is formed of the cyan beads .

( a ) 1.00 t0 , ( b ) 1.02 t0 , ( c ) 1.04 t0 , ( d ) 1.06 t0 , ( e ) 1.08 t0 , and ( f ) 1.10 t0 .
the temperature is gradually increased from 1.0 t0 to 1.1 t0 .
figure 3 physical parameters describing the responsive behaviors under two conditions .
the order parameter s , z coordinate of center of mass ( com ) of polymers ( notice that z coordinate of the substrate is 1.0 nm ) , and ( inset ) averaged aggregation number as a function of temperature .
( a ) shows the case i where the temperature gradually increases from 1.0 t0 to 1.1 t0 , whereas ( b ) shows the case ii where the temperature sharply increases from 1.0 t0 to targeted temperature .
the polymer length is 20 .
figure 4 physical parameters describing the responsive behaviors for different polymer lengths .
( a ) the order parameter s , ( b ) z coordinate of com of polymers , and ( c ) averaged aggregation number as a function of temperature when the polymer length is 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 25 , respectively .
the temperature gradually increases from 1.0 t0 to 1.1 t0 .

( a - d ) the potential of mean force as a function of temperature .
( a ) pnipam hydrophilicity , ( b ) m - s interaction , ( c ) electric interaction , and ( d ) excluded volume interaction .
( e - g ) chemical potentials of five different pnipam length systems under three different temperatures .
( e ) at 30 degreesc , all chemical potentials rise with the increase of sigma , suggesting that all the systems are stable and no transitions occur ; ( f ) at 42 degreesc , chemical potential of the system with l = 25 decreases with the increase of surface coverage in the region of 0.04 nm - 2 < sigma < 0.06 nm - 2 , meaning that the micro - phase separation occurs in this system ; ( g ) at 50 degreesc , the micro - phase separation takes place not only in the systems with l = 25 under all surface coverages , but also in the systems with l = 20 in the region 0.02 nm - 2 < sigma < 0.05 nm - 2 .
this means that the micro - phase separation will happen when the temperature is high , especially for the systems with longer pnipam .
parameters are the same as fig. 5. figure 7 three different status of the triple - responsive biosensor .
( a ) when the temperature is low , the polymer is hydrophilic and extends randomly , and the dna order parameter is low ; ( b ) when the temperature becomes high , the polymer gets hydrophobic and sharply collapses , and the orientaional dna order is enhanced ; ( c ) when the temperature is sufficient high , the micro - phase separation of polymers appears , reducing the orientational dna order .

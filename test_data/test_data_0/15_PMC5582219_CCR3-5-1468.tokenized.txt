key clinical message spg 8 is an autosomal dominant hsp , which phenotype results from kiaa0196 gene mutations .
there have been twelve types of kiaa0196 mutations described in hgmd , which are located in conservative region of gene encoding strumpellin .
we describe first patient in poland , simultaneously second in the world with kiaa0196 mutation - p.v620a .

we describe first patient in poland who has had confirmed spg 8 with kiaa0196 strumpellin mutation - p.v620a .
hereditary spastic paraplegia type 8 ( spg8 , mim : # 603563 ) is a rare disorder , which has been described only in fifteen families in the world 1 .
spg 8 is an autosomal dominant hsp , which phenotype results from kiaa0196 gene mutations .
there have been twelve types of kiaa0196 mutations described in hgmd ( table 1 ) .
all mutations are located in conservative region of kiaa0196 gene encoding strumpellin .
precise role of strumpellin in neurons is unknown ; however , it is one of proteins in wash complex , which is responsible for interface between actin regulation and endosomal membrane dynamics 2 .
gait problems develop in patients who suffer from spg8 in adulthood as a result of upper motoneuron impairment .
the aim of the study was to describe the first identified polish patient with kiaa0196 mutation - p.v620a .
this mutation has been described previously only in one german family , in two individuals ( mother and son ) 3 .

e83k dutch 1 1 e713k japanese 1 1 r1035c dutch 1 1 john wiley & sons , ltd patient , 48 - year - old man , was examined because of gait and balance disturbances .
first - time symptoms appeared when patient was 34 years old and increased gradually .
involuntary movements during night sleep , similar to movements occurring in restless legs syndrome , have been observed for a few months .
neurological examination revealed dysarthria , excessive deep reflexes , and hypertension of muscles in all limbs as well as paraparesis ( grade ii in the lovett scale in the left and grade iii in the right limb ) with feet clonus .
similar gait problems have been also identified in mother and grandmother of the patient .
unfortunately , grandmother has already died and mother as well as other family members with neurological symptoms did not agree to perform genetic tests .
mri scans of a head and whole vertebral column of patient revealed only 9 - mm - long dilatation of central canal to 3 mm in a cervical spinal cord .
it is doubtful that paraparesis resulted from dilatation of central canal due to observed progression of paraparesis in time with simultaneously stabile size of dilatation .
in spite of wide diagnostic , reason of gait and balance problems remained unclear , especially , when the most often genetic reasons of paraparesis were excluded ( spg3a , spg4 , spg6 , spg7 , spg31 , sca1 , sca2 , and sca3 ) .
therefore , additional genetic tests were performed , using next - generation sequencing tests ( ngs ) .
libraries were created using trusight one kit .
the 29 genes related to different types of spg were analyzed ( ap4b1 , ap4e1 , atl1 , bscl2 , c12orf65 , c19orf12 , cct5 , cyp7b1 , entpd1 , erlin2 , fa2h , hspd1 , kiaa0196 , kif5a , licam , nipa1 , plp1 , pnpla6 , rab3gab2 , reep1 , rtn2 , scl33a1 , spast , spg11 , spg20 , spg21 , spg7 , zfyve26 , zfyve27 ) .
genes were chosen based on pubmed , omim and disgenet base , searching their correlation with paraplegias .
a known mutation p.v620a of kiaa0196 gene ( washc5 , genotype nm _ 014846.3 : c [ 1859t > c ];[=] , np _ 055661.3 : p. [ val620ala ];[=] was identified .
mutation was confirmed using sanger sequencing .
literature review did not show any prior evidence of such mutation in poland .
thus , we assume that this is the first patient in poland with spg 8 with p.v620a mutation and second family with this defect of kiaa0196 gene worldwide 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 .
time period since the first symptoms were observed till successful diagnosis and genetic confirmation of the disease in this patient took 14 years .
hereditary spastic paraplegias is a rare reason of gait disturbances .
paraplegias have very complex genetic background , and before ngs method applied to diagnostics , their identification was very expensive and time - consuming .
the identification of the genetic reason of the disease allows to apply respective treatment , very often personalized one .
for example , family with mutation of kiaa0196 gene ( mother and daughter ) were treated using l - dopa what resulted in decreasing level of lower limbs spasticity 6 .
despite positive response to l - dopa in one family affected by spg8 , causal therapy in other types of hsp remains unknown so far .
development of methods used in genetic diagnostics can reduce costs and time of diagnostics .
conflict of interest there is no conflict of interest .

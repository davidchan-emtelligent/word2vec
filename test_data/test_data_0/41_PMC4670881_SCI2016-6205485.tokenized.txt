mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) possess great immunomodulatory capacity which lays the foundation for their therapeutic effects in a variety of diseases .
recently , toll - like receptors ( tlr ) have been shown to modulate msc functions ; however , the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood .
emerging evidence suggests that long noncoding rnas ( lncrnas ) are an important class of regulators involved in a wide range of biological processes .
to explore the potential involvement of lncrnas in tlr stimulated mscs , we performed a comprehensive lncrna and mrna profiling through microarray .
10.2 % of lncrnas ( 1733 out of 16967 ) and 15.1 % of mrna transcripts ( 1760 out of 11632 ) were significantly differentially expressed ( absolute fold - change >= 5 , p value <= 0.05 ) in tlr3 stimulated mscs .
furthermore , we characterized the differentially expressed lncrnas through their classes and length distribution and correlated them with differentially expressed mrna .
here , we are the first to determine genome - wide lncrnas expression patterns in tlr3 stimulated mscs by microarray and this work could provide a comprehensive framework of the transcriptome landscapes of tlr3 stimulated mscs .
1. introduction mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) are a type of adult stem cells with the capacity to generate a wide range of cells such as adipocytes , osteoblasts , chondrocytes , and myocytes [ 1 ] .
being originally identified from the bone marrow , mscs now can be isolated from many other tissues including adipose tissue , placenta , and umbilical cord .
mscs also possess potent immunoregulatory abilities through interactions with both the adaptive and the innate immune cells .
the immunomodulatory effect of mscs is mediated by the secretion of soluble factors and / or by cell - cell contact - dependent regulation .
these features make mscs an interesting cell resource for tissue regeneration and cellular therapy .
recently , the findings of functional toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) expression on msc implicate these receptors in modulating mscs functions [ 2 ] .
tlrs are pattern recognition receptors involved in the recognition of pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( pamp ) by immune cells , initiating both primary and adaptive immune responses [ 3 ] .
to date , thirteen mammalian tlr analogs have been identified ( 10 in humans and 13 in mice ) .
beside their important roles in immunity , tlrs have also been recognized as regulators of stem cells functions , including cell growth , differentiation , and survival .
for instance , de luca et al. showed that tlr1 / 2 signaling instructed commitment of human hematopoietic stem cells to a myeloid cell fate [ 4 ] .
qi et al. demonstrated that both tlr3 and tlr4 promoted differentiation of bone marrow mscs to osteoblasts [ 5 ] .
in the field of immunology , recent publications have shown widespread changes in the expression of lncrnas during the activation of the innate immune response and t cell development , differentiation , and activation [ 6 ] .
it is well known that tlrs and their specific stimulus activate myd88 - dependent or - independent downstream signaling pathways .
however , whether epigenetic regulators such as long noncoding rna are involved in this process remains unclear .
in this study , we determined the tlr expression profile of adipose tissue derived mscs ( ad - mscs ) and the consequences of tlr3 ligation in terms of cytokine secretion by these cells .
to explore the potential involvement of lncrnas in tlr stimulated mscs , we performed comprehensive lncrna and mrna profiling through microarray .
10.2 % of lncrnas ( 1733 out of 16967 ) and 15.1 % of mrna transcripts ( 1760 out of 11632 ) were significantly differentially expressed ( absolute fold - change >= 5 , p value <= 0.05 ) in tlr3 stimulated mscs .
furthermore , we characterized the differentially expressed lncrnas through their classes and length distribution and correlated them with differentially expressed mrna .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study that links tlr3 with lncrnas in mscs .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
isolation and culture of ad - mscs adipose tissues were obtained from patients undergoing tumescent liposuction according to procedures approved by the ethics committee at the chinese academy of medical sciences and peking union medical college .
ad - mscs were isolated and culture - expanded as previously reported [ 1 , 7 ] .
passage 3 cells were used for the experiments .
2.2 .
adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of ad - mscs adipogenic differentiation was induced in high glucose of dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( h - dmem ) supplemented with 10 % fbs , 1 mum dexamethasone , 0.5 mm 3 - isobutyl - 1 - methylxanthine , and 5 mug / ml 0.1 mm l - ascorbic acid .
after being cultured in adipocyte induction medium for 4 days , medium was replaced with adipocyte maintaining medium , h - dmem , with 10 % fbs .
for osteogenic differentiation , ad - mscs were cultured in h - dmem containing 10 % fbs , 10 mm beta - glycerophosphate , 50 mumm l - ascorbic acid , and 0.01 mum dexamethasone for 14 days .
2.3 .
alp and oil red o staining the procedure of alp staining was performed according to the manufacturer 's instructions of alp staining kit ( institute of hematology and blood diseases hospital , chinese academy of medical sciences ) .
for oil red o staining , cells were washed twice with pbs and fixed with 10 % formalin for 10 min at room temperature .
after fixation , cells were stained with filtered oil red o solution ( stock solution : 3 mg / ml in isopropanol , working solution : 60 % oil red o stock solution and 40 % distilled water ) for 1 h at room temperature .
after staining , cells were washed with water to remove unbound dye , visualized by light microscopy , and photographed .
2.4 .
real - time polymerase chain reaction analysis total rna was extracted with trizol ( invitrogen ) , and cdna was prepared .
real - time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) was amplified in triplicates according to manufacturer 's procedures ( takara ) .
relative expression of mrna was evaluated by 2 - deltadeltact method and normalized to the expression of gapdh .
2.5 .
cytokines production ad - mscs were seeded in 12 - well plate in culture medium with or without poly i : c. supernatants were collected after 24 h and concentrations of il - 1beta , il - 4 , il - 6 , il - 8 , il - 10 , il - 12 , tnf - alpha , tgfbeta , and ifn - gamma were determined by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) ( r & d system ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
2.6 .
microarray and data analysis arraystar human lncrna microarray v3.0 is designed for the global profiling of human lncrnas and protein - coding transcripts , which is updated from the previous microarray v2.0 .
about 30,586 lncrnas and 26,109 coding transcripts can be detected by our third - generation lncrna microarray .
the lncrnas are carefully constructed using the most highly respected public transcriptome databases ( refseq , ucsc knowngenes , gencode , etc. ) , as well as landmark publications .
each transcript is represented by a specific exon or splice junction probe which can identify individual transcript accurately .
total rna was extracted and examined for quality control before array .
the od260 / od280 ratios were approximately 2.0 , and the od260 / od230 ratios were more than 1.8 ( supplementary table 1 in supplementary material available online at http :// dx.doi.org / 10.1155 / 2016 / 6205485 ) .
positive probes for housekeeping genes and negative probes are also printed onto the array for hybridization quality control .
( 1 ) rna labeling and array hybridization are as follows : sample labeling and array hybridization were performed according to the agilent one - color microarray - based gene expression analysis protocol ( agilent technology ) with minor modifications .
briefly , mrna was purified from total rna after removal of rrna ( mrna - only eukaryotic mrna isolation kit , epicentre ) .
then , each sample was amplified and transcribed into fluorescent crna along the entire length of the transcripts without 3 ' bias utilizing a random priming method ( arraystar flash rna labeling kit , arraystar ) .
the labeled crnas were purified by rneasy mini kit ( qiagen ) .
the concentration and specific activity of the labeled crnas ( pmol cy3 / mug crna ) were measured by nanodrop nd - 1000 .
1 mug of each labeled crna was fragmented by adding 5 mul 10x blocking agent and 1 mul of 25x fragmentation buffer and then the mixture was heated at 60degreesc for 30 min ; finally , 25 mul 2x ge hybridization buffer was added to dilute the labeled crna .
50 mul of hybridization solution was dispensed into the gasket slide and assembled to the lncrna expression microarray slide .
the slides were incubated for 17 hours at 65degreesc in an agilent hybridization oven .
the hybridized arrays were washed , fixed , and scanned using the agilent dna microarray scanner ( part number g2505c ) .
quality control for labeling efficiency was shown in supplementary table 2 .
( 2 ) data analysis is as follows : slides were scanned at 5 lm / pixel resolution using an axon genepix 4000b scanner ( molecular devices corporation ) piloted by genepix pro 6.0 software ( axon ) .
scanned images ( tiff format ) were then imported into nimblescan software ( version 2.5 ) for grid alignment and expression data analysis .
expression data were normalized through quantile normalization and the robust multichip average ( rma ) algorithm included in the nimblescan software .
the probe level files and mrna level files were generated after normalization .
all gene level files were imported into agilent genespring gx software ( version 11.5.1 ) and normalized by the quantile method ; then , combat software was used to adjust the normalized intensity to remove batch effects .
hierarchical clustering was performed using agilent genespring gx software ( version 11.5.1 ) .
the analysis was performed by kangchen biotech. , shanghai , china .
agilent feature extraction software ( version 11.0.1.1 ) was used to analyze acquired array images .
we have four samples ; three were control mscs and one is tlr3 - activated mscs .
lncrnas and mrnas that have flags in present or marginal ( all targets value ) in at least 2 out of the 3 control mscs samples were chosen for further data analysis .
differentially expressed lncrnas and mrnas with statistical significance between the two groups were identified through p value / fdr filtering .
hierarchical clustering and combined analysis were performed using homemade scripts .
for gene ontology analysis , fisher 's exact test was used to determine whether the overlap between the differentially expressed gene list and the go annotation list was greater than that expected by chance .
the p value denotes the significance of go term enrichment in the differentially expressed genes .
3. results 3.1 .
characterization of ad - mscs and the expression pattern of tlrs we isolated and expanded plastic adherent , spindle - like mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue ( figure 1 ( a )) .
ad - mscs expressed high levels of cd29 , cd44 , and cd105 but were persistently negative for cd31 , cd34 , and hla - dr ( figure 1 ( b )) .
osteogenic differentiation was detected by alizarin red staining and alp activity assay ( figure 1 ( c )) .
adipogenic differentiation was demonstrated by oil red o staining ( figure 1 ( c )) .
the expression of tlrs in mscs remains controversial .
pcr primers specific to tlr - 1 and to tlr - 10 were designed to detect tlrs from total rna in ad - mscs ( table 1 ) .
rt - pcr results showed that all tlrs were detectable within 33 cycles and that tlr3 has the highest expression level ( figure 1 ( d )) .
3.2 .
effect of tlr3 agonist on cytokine expression of ad - mscs since tlr3 had the highest expression level , to evaluate its functionality , we stimulated ad - mscs with tlr3 agonist ( poly i : c 20 mug / ml ) for 24 h and determined its effect on cell proliferation and cytokine secretion .
poly i : c slightly decreased proliferation of ad - mscs ( figure 2 ( a )) .
flow cytometry analysis of cell cycles showed that poly i : c stimulated ad - mscs had enhanced g2 phase ( figure 2 ( b )) .
we measured a number of cytokines known to be involved in immunomodulation , including il - 1beta , il - 4,il - 6 , il - 8 , il - 10 , il - 12 , tnf - alpha , tgfbeta , and ifn - gamma .
we found that poly i : c induced upregulation of il - 1beta , il - 6 , il - 8 , and tnf - alpha as measured by rt - pcr ( figure 2 ( c )) .
enhanced release of these cytokines was also detected by elisa ( figure 2 ( d )) .
exposure to poly ( i : c ) also increased the expression of tlr3 ( figure 2 ( e )) .
3.3 .
overview of lncrna and mrna profiles in tlr3 - activated ad - mscs and control ad - mscs to examine the lncrna expression profiles in ad - mscs treated with or without tlr3 agonist , we used arraystar human lncrna microarray v3.0 which contains 30,586 lncrna probes , collected from refseq , ucsc knowngenes , gencode , and so forth , and 26,109 mrna probes .
the overview of lncrna expression profiles is summarized in table 2 and figure 3 ( a ) .
overall , we found that 55.5 % of lncrnas ( 16967 out of 30586 ) and 44.5 % of protein - coding mrna transcripts ( 11632 out of 26109 ) on the microarray exhibited expression above background .
10.2 % of lncrnas ( 1733 out of 16967 ) and 15.1 % of protein - coding mrna transcripts ( 1760 out of 11632 ) were significantly differentially expressed ( absolute fold - change >= 5 , p value <= 0.05 ) between tlr3 - activated ad - mscs and control ad - mscs .
the top 10 up - and downregulated lncrnas in tlr3 - activated ad - mscs compared to control ad - mscs were shown in table 3 .
figure 3 ( b ) showed the hierarchical cluster of lncrnas expression in poly i : c stimulated ad - mscs and nonstimulated ad - mscs .
additionally , statistical analysis showed that the expressed lncrnas were widely distributed on all chromosomes ( figure 3 ( c )) and that chr1 had the most expressed lncrnas , while the mitochondrial genome had the least .
3.4 .
characteristics of lncrnas with changed expression in tlr3 - activated ad - mscs among the 7271 differentially expressed lncrna ( absolute fold - change >= 2 , p value <= 0.05 ) , 2155 lncrnas were upregulated in experimental group compared to the control group , while 5116 lncrnas were downregulated .
here , one upregulated lncrna uc010kun.2 was of particular interest for us because it is located upstream of il6 , a cytokine induced after tlr3 activation in ad - mscs .
using qpcr , we observed a 2.70 - fold upregulation in uc010kun.2 , consistent with microarray analysis results ( 2.63 - fold - change ) ( supplementary figure 1 ) .
table 3 showed the top 10 up - and downregulated lncrnas in tlr3 - activated ad - mscs versus control ad - mscs .
we classified these differentially expressed lncrnas into 6 groups : " sense - overlapping ," the lncrna 's exon is overlapping a coding transcript exon on the same genomic strand ; " intronic ," the lncrna is overlapping the intron of a coding transcript on the same genomic strand ; " natural antisense ," the lncrna is transcribed from the antisense strand and overlapping with a coding transcript ; " nonoverlapping antisense ," the lncrna is transcribed from the antisense strand without sharing overlapping exons ; " bidirectional ," the lncrna is oriented head to head to a coding transcript within 1000 bp ; " intergenic " : there are no overlapping or bidirectional coding transcripts nearby the lncrna .
figure 4 ( a ) showed the distribution of the six classes of lncrnas with changed expression in tlr3 - activated ad - mscs .
the lncrnas are mainly between 200 bp and 3000 bp in length .
figure 4 ( b ) showed the length distribution of differentially expressed lncrnas .
the majority of the differentially expressed lncrnas have a length between 500 bp and 1000 bp .
3.5 .
gene ontology and pathway analysis go analysis was performed to determine the gene and gene product enrichment in biological processes , cellular components , and molecular functions ( supplementary figure 2 ) .
we found that the highest enriched gos targeted by upregulated mrnas in tlr3 - activated mscs were mrna metabolic process ( ontology : biological process ) ( figure 5 ( a )) , intracellular part ( ontology : cellular component ) ( figure 5 ( b )) , and structural constituent of ribosome ( ontology : molecular function ) ( figure 5 ( c )) .
the highest enriched gos targeted by the downregulated transcripts in tlr3 - activated mscs were response to external stimulus ( ontology : biological process ) ( figure 5 ( d )) , ankyrin binding ( ontology : cellular component ) ( figure 5 ( e )) , and intrinsic to plasma membrane ( ontology : molecular function ) ( figure 5 ( f )) .
specifically , we analyzed expression of genes associated with immune response ( go : 0006955 figure 6 ( a )) , genes associated with immune response - regulation signaling pathway ( go : 0002764 figure 6 ( b )) , and genes associated with regulation of immune response ( go : 0050776 figure 6 ( c )) .
additionally , other genes associated with immune response ( go : 0050778 , go : 0042092 , go : 0002828 , go : 0002920 , and go : 0002821 ) were analyzed ( supplementary figure 3 ) .
pathway analysis indicated that 38 pathways were upregulated and 31 were downregulated in tlr3 - activated mscs .
figure 7 showed the top 10 of the changed pathways .
4. discussion tlrs play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity .
the expression and function of multiple tlrs have been described in many cell types , especially in cells of the innate immune system , where they function as sensors of infection or damage [ 8 , 9 ] .
however , conflicting results have been reported because tlrs expressed on different cell types from different species and tissues resulted in different responses [ 10 ] .
recently , it has been reported that msc derived from adult bone marrow also expresses functional tlrs that promote their survival and proinflammatory cytokine secretion [ 11 ] .
here , we show that ad - mscs express 10 types of tlrs and the expression level of tlr3 was the highest .
activation of tlr3 in ad - mscs leads to enhanced secretion of il - 1beta , il - 6 , il - 8 , and tnf - alpha .
it is well known that tlrs and their specific stimulus activate myd88 - dependent or - independent downstream signaling pathways .
however , whether epigenetic regulators such as long noncoding rna are involved in this process remains unclear .
lncrnas are over 200 nucleotides in length and are separate from the other known ncrna subsets .
previous studies have focused primarily on short noncoding rnas , such as micrornas , transfer rnas , and short interfering rnas .
increasing evidence confirmed lncrnas to be one of the most important factors controlling gene expression and the aberrant expression of which is involved in a variety of human diseases , including immunological disorders [ 12 , 13 ] .
guttman et al. were the first to use the intergenic deposition of epigenetic marks to identify 20 lncrnas induced in lipopolysaccharide - ( lps - ) stimulated mouse bone marrow - derived dendritic cells ( bmdd ) [ 14 ] .
later on , several lncrnas have been identified following activation of monocytes , macrophages , fibroblasts , and dendritic cells [ 15 - 18 ] .
the potential importance of lncrnas in the immune response is only now emerging .
immune - related lncrnas are generally identified through examination of differential expression in response to activation of immune cells [ 6 ] .
here , a major focus of our study was to define the repertoire of lncrnas in tlr3 - activated ad - mscs .
we performed comprehensive lncrna and mrna profiling through microarray and found 10.2 % of lncrnas ( 1733 out of 16967 ) and 15.1 % of mrna transcripts ( 1760 out of 11632 ) were significantly differentially expressed in tlr3 stimulated mscs .
furthermore , we characterized the differentially expressed lncrnas through their classes and length distribution and correlated them with differentially expressed mrna .
an interesting observation from sequencing data is that many of the immune - related lncrnas are located close to , or partially overlapping , the 5 ' end ( upstream ) or 3 ' end ( downstream ) of protein - coding genes implicated in the immune response [ 6 , 19 ] .
here , one upregulated lncrna uc010kun.2 was of particular interest for us because it is located upstream of il6 , a cytokine induced after tlr3 activation in ad - mscs .
another lncrna our data may highlight is lncrna - cox7a2 .
carpenter et al. indicated that cox2 and lncrna - cox2 regulated by myd88 and nf - kb were markedly induced after tlr4 stimulation in bmdms [ 17 ] .
here , lncrna - cox7a2 is predicted to be associated with cox7a2 , which is also a cytochrome c oxidase subunit .
tlr3 signaling and subsequent inflammatory responses are controlled by a multitude of regulatory molecules .
here , we propose a model whereby tlr3 signaling induces expression changes of lncrnas which then exert their effects as repressors or activators of genes through interactions with various regulatory complexes .
as such , lncrnas represent a new component of the tlr3 signaling pathway .
in summary , our study was the first to demonstrate that a set of lncrnas is significantly regulated in ad - mscs upon stimulation with tlr3 , suggesting a role of lncrnas in the immune response of ad - mscs .
this will provide the basis for the subsequent functional and mechanistic analysis of individual lncrnas .
currently , the precise functions of the differentially expressed lncrnas remain largely unknown and advances in the understanding of their role will allow us to tackle a range of challenges in ad - mscs immunomodulatory properties .
highlights tlr3 is highly expressed in adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells .
tlr3 agonist poly i : c promotes secretion of a variety of cytokines .
tlr3 - activated ad - mscs show dynamic changes in lncrna and mrna profiles .
supplementary material supplementary table 1 demonstrated the rna quantification and quality assurance of four samples ( one is tlr3 - activated mscs , three are control mscs ) ; table 2 showed the quality control for labeling efficiency during the microarray .

objectives : evaluating the long - term outcome of the surgical management for intestinal strictures developing after necrotizing enterocolitis ( nec ) .
patients and methods : this is a retrospective study of all patients with an intestinal stricture after completion of conservative management for nec .
they were treated during the eight years period from 1st january 2008 to 31st december 2015 .
results : during the study period 67 infants had an operation for nec , of which 55 had emergency surgery .
the remaining twelve infants ( 6 males ) had a stricture and were included in the study group .
their median gestational age was 35 ( range 27 - 40 ) weeks and the median weight was 2180 ( range 770 - 3290 ) g. the onset of nec was seen at a median of 2 ( range 1 - 47 ) days .
the median peak c - reactive protein ( crp ) level was 73.1 ( range 25.2 - 232 ) mg / dl. isolated strictures were seen in 9 ( 75 %) patients .
two - third of all strictures ( n = 15 ) were located in the colon .
surgery was done at a median of 5 ( range 3 - 13 ) weeks after diagnosing nec .
primary anastomosis was the procedure of choice ; only one needed a temporary colostomy .
this cohort had no mortality during a median follow up of 6.25 ( range 0.5 - 7.6 ) years , whilst the overall death rate for nec was 15 ( 22 %) .
two fifth of the group developed a neurological / sensory impairment .
conclusion : one fifth of the surgical workload for nec is related to post - nec strictures .
most strictures are located in the colonic region .
in the long - term no mortality and no surgical co - morbidities were observed .
necrotizing enterocolitis intestinal stricture primary anastomosis neurodevelopmental delay introduction necrotizing enterocolitis ( nec ) is an inflammatory disease process of the gastrointestinal tract commonly seen in the neonatal unit affecting mostly premature infants [ 1,2 ] .
the mainstay medical intervention consists of abdominal decompression , bowel rest , intravenous antibiotics and parenteral nutrition ; emergency surgery is required in infants with intestinal perforation or failure of medical management [ 3 ] .
intestinal strictures developing during or after the conservative management of nec have been reported since the late 1960s and rabinowitz has been credited with the first report of a stricture after nec [ 4 - 6 ] .
this study focuses on the long - term outcome of the surgical management of post - nec strictures .
materials and methods this retrospective study reviewed the records of all patients who had surgery for nec between 1st january 2008 and 31st december 2015 .
approved by the local ethics committee ( crec 2015.727 ) the demographics , presentation , results of radiological and laboratory investigations , operative findings and outcome , morbidity and mortality of the patient group were analyzed .
all patients with a suspected intestinal stricture ( e.g. food intolerance , recurrent abdominal distension , high gastric aspirates , radiological features of intestinal obstruction ) underwent a contrast enema ( ce ) to confirm the stricture and its location ( fig. 1 ) .
if the ce was normal , an upper gastrointestinal study with small bowel follow through ( ugi - sbft ) was added to identify the stricture ( 7 , fig. 1 ) .
only patients developing an intestinal stricture as a result of conservative management for nec were included in the study group .
patients found to have a stricture after surgery for nec following inadequate resection of necrotic tissue during the first operation or disease progression after emergency surgery were excluded .
figure 1 : panel a contrast enema with sigmoid colon stricture ( white arrow ) 4 weeks after onset of nec ; panel b follow - through with distal ileum stricture ( black arrow ) 4 weeks after onset of nec .
descriptive statistical analysis were used to report the frequency and median values of patients' demographics .
the results were compared with the outcome by other institutions reporting their experience with approximately 50 or more cases of nec .
results during the eight years observation period a total of 67 infants underwent surgery for nec .
fifty - five had emergency surgery for nec , as a result of perforation or failure of medical management .
twelve ( 6 males ) had surgery for one or more stricture ( s ) after completion of the conservative therapy for nec .
the overall mortality rate for infants undergoing surgery for nec was 15 ( 22 %) , but no infant died in the subgroup of post - nec strictures as illustrated by the kaplan - meier curve ( fig. 2 ) .
this cohort of post - nec stricture ( s ) compromised a median gestational age of 35 ( range 27 - 40 ) weeks and a median weight of 2180 ( range 770 - 3290 ) g ; there was no evidence of intrauterine growth retardation ( iugr ) within the group ( fig. 3 ) .

figure 3 : percentile weight distribution of infants with nec stricture ( note : no infants had iugr ) nec was diagnosed in this cohort at a median of 2 ( range 1 - 47 ) days after birth .
the median peak c - reactive protein ( crp ) level during the acute phase of the nec was 73.1 ( range 25.2 - 232 ) mg / dl. a suspected intestinal stricture was confirmed by ce and if necessary clarified by an additional ugi - sbft ( fig. 1 ) .
isolated strictures were seen in 9 ( 75 %) .
together with the 3 infants , who were found to have two strictures each , a total of 15 strictures were identified , of which two - thirds ( 10 ) were located in the colon ( fig. 4 ) .
surgical resection of the stricture ( s ) took place at a median of 5 ( range 3 - 13 ) weeks after diagnosing nec .
a primary anastomosis after resection of the strictured segment ( s ) was done in all patients except one .
she required a temporary colostomy for severe size discrepancy between the transverse colon ends ; the colostomy was reversed 6 weeks later .
postoperatively , two minor self - limiting wound dehiscences were recorded .
figure 4 : graphic illustration of the position of the strictures ( n = 15 ) in 12 infants , of which 3 had two strictures each with their respective position marked by bars ( a - c ) .
during the median follow up period of 6.25 ( range 0.5 - 7.6 ) years this subgroup of post - nec related strictures did not develop any further surgical complications ( e.g. adhesive intestinal obstruction , anastomotic stricture ) .
one patient 's total parenteral nutrition ( tpn ) related cholestatic jaundice resolved .
only one infant was found to have an intra - cranial hemorrhage , but five developed conditions associated with prematurity and possibly nec : three patients had neurodevelopmental delay and two sensory impairments , of which one required a hearing aid and one needed the correction of a divergent squint .
discussion this study sets out to investigate the results of the operative management of intestinal strictures , which developed during or after medical therapy for nec ; we are not concerned with intestinal strictures manifesting itself as a result of inadequate emergency surgery for nec or disease progression after surgery .
following sporadic reports on post - nec strictures in the 1960s a proliferation of reports concerning the management of post - nec strictures followed in recent decades [ 6 , 8 - 12 ] .
throughout the last four decades the colon has been by far the dominant site for stricture formation after medical therapy for nec ( table 1 ) .
as in our cohort two - thirds had a colonic stricture either in isolation or in conjunction with another bowel narrowing ( fig. 4 ) .
a recent study by gaudin and coworkers reported more than 80 % of colonic strictures in their analyzed group [ 12 ] .
these findings justify the utilization of a contrast enema as the first line radiological intervention to identify the location and the possible extend of the stricture [ 7 ] .
a contrast study should be done as soon as suspicious clinical findings ( e. g. vomiting , abdominal distension , high aspirates , etc. ) become apparent to avoid the development of potentially life - threatening sepsis or perforation associated with intestinal obstruction [ 6 ] .
table 1 : frequency and outcome of post - nec strictures at different institutions in most instances the stricture became clinically manifest at around 5 - 7 weeks after the onset of nec ( table 1 ) .
only bell and coworkers intervened to resect strictures in their cohort at 2 weeks after the commencement of nec , probably still operating during the acute phase of nec ( 8 ) .
whilst in the 1970s and 1980s stoma formation constituted the initial step in the management of the stricture alongside primary anastomosis , we give preference to a direct anastomosis after resection of the stricture .
this view is shared by gaudin and schimpl and their respective coworkers who prefer a primary anastomosis to a staged stoma formation except in circumstances of gross discrepancy between bowel ends [ 11,12 ] .
we cannot confirm the assertion by janik and coworkers , primary anastomosis may be hazardous before 3 months have elapsed , as histological specimen may demonstrate active inflammatory disease [ 10 ] .
in our cohort all but one resection of intestinal stricture ( s ) were done within 3 months after the onset of the nec ; in fact the median time for surgical intervention was just 5 weeks .
we did not encounter an anastomotic stricture .
the overall mortality for nec is around 20 + percent ( table1 ) .
however mortality in infants treated for post - nec stricture is remarkably low ( table 1 ) ; we did not record a death at all in our cohort ( fig. 2 ) .
the long - term results for surgical co - morbidities are also encouraging ; janik had no surgical complications after a mean observation time of 3.5 years [ 10 ] .
we encountered neither an adhesive intestinal obstruction nor a recurrent stricture after a median of 6.25 years follow up. however we observed a number of neurological and sensory sequelae in our cohort .
a majority of this group were premature infants susceptible to neurodevelopmental and sensory impairment , albeit only one had an intra - cranial hemorrhage .
nec , the effects of surgery and the prolonged hospital stay for these infants may contribute to the resulting neurodevelopmental delay and sensory impairment affecting two - fifth of this group [ 2 ] .
post - nec strictures accounted for 7 - 10 % of the overall nec workload in the 1970s and 1980s [ 3 - 6 ] .
looking at our results and contemporary studies there may be a trend towards a higher rate of post - nec strictures possibly as a result of better intensive care management for acute nec [ 12 ] .
whilst we acknowledge surgery in nec is frequently required at an early stage ( e.g. perforation ) , this study shows a clear survival advantage for infants developing a post - nec stricture .
heida and coworkers identified no post - nec strictures in patients with their highest crp level less than 46 mg / ml during the acute phase of nec [ 13 ] .
we cannot confirm these findings , in fact 17 % ( 2 / 12 ) of our cohort had a lower maximal crp level and still developed a stricture .
it is difficult to see a marker for a generalized inflammatory process predicting localized changes as the formation of strictures .
conclusion intestinal strictures after conservative management for nec constitute approximately 20 % of the surgical workload for nec .
the majority of strictures are single isolated strictures mostly in the colonic region .
surgery for post - nec related strictures carries a low mortality risk .
our study had no long - term mortality .
the long - term outcome shows a remarkably low risk for surgical co - morbidity ( e.g. adhesive intestinal obstruction ) , but neurodevelopmental and sensory impairment affect 40 % of the cohort .

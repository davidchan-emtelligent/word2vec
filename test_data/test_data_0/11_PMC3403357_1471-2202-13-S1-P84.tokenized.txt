it has been observed that this neuronal variability has the remarkable property that the fano factor of the neuron 's spike counts ( variance / mean ) is constant over broad ranges of their firing rates , a property that we call " fano factor constancy " .
realistic neuronal networks models in the balanced regime do not lead to fano factor constancy over broad ranges of firing rate unless their parameters are fine - tuned , posing a problem .
what mechanism could lead to fano factor constancy ?
one well - documented source of variability in cortex is synaptic noise .
however , whether synaptic noise can lead to the observed properties of neuronal variability is currently unknown .
to address this problem , we studied analytically a network of excitatory and inhibitory spiking integrate - and - fire neurons connected with arbitrary connectivity matrices .
the network was endowed with stochastic synaptic release with fixed probability .
the system was solved in the stationary regime when the network is strongly driven by stimuli .
to study robustness of the results , we studied numerically networks with short - term synaptic plasticity with stochastic release and with uncompleted saturation , in line with recent in vivo experimental results .
here we show that realistic neuronal networks of spiking neurons endowed with probabilistic synaptic release naturally generate constant fano factors over several orders of magnitude in the neurons' firing rate .
the mechanism does not require fine tuning of the network parameters , but rather it arises naturally from the amplification of the synaptic noise and the neuronal spiking threshold .
other mechanisms that introduce noise in the system like channel noise or constant external noise do not lead to fano factor constancy .
probabilistic synaptic release naturally leads to information loss .
then , what could be the role of this form of variability ?
we show that synaptic noise allows sampling the states of the network and , furthermore , that the fano factor constancy property implies that the state - sampling dynamics obeys a scale - invariant rule : if the input drive to the network is scaled by some factor , the probability of visiting the states of the network remains constant .
this means that , for instance , if the contrast of an ambiguous input image is doubled , the probability of interpreting it in a particular way does not change .
this result suggests that a form of weber - like scale - invariance perception is naturally implemented in neuronal networks with probabilistic synapses .
therefore , synaptic noise might not only be the responsible for the type of variability found in cortex , but it also might endow cortical neurons with crucial computational properties to solve inference problems with ambiguous information .

background in england , prostate cancer patients report worse experience of care than patients with other cancers .
however , no standard measure of patient experience of prostate cancer care is currently available .
this paper describes an evaluation of the reliability , validity and acceptability of the pcq - p , a newly developed instrument designed to measure patient experience of prostate cancer care .
methods the reliability , acceptability and validity of the pcq - p were tested through a postal survey and interviews with patients .
the pcq - p was posted to 1087 prostate cancer patients varying in age , occupation , and overall health status , sampled from five hospitals in england .
nonresponders received one reminder .
to assess criterion validity , 935 patients were also sent sections of the national centre for social research shortened questionnaire ; and to assess test - retest reliability , 296 patients who responded to the questionnaire were resent it a second time three weeks later .
a subsample of 20 prostate cancer patients from one hospital took part in qualitative interviews to assess validity and acceptability of the pcq - p. acceptability to service providers was evaluated based on four hospitals' experiences of running a survey using the pcq - p. results questionnaires were returned by 865 patients ( 69.2 %) .
missing data was low across the sections , with the proportion of patients completing less than 50 % of each section ranging from 4.5 % to 6.9 % .
across the sections of the questionnaire , internal consistency was moderate to high ( cronbach 's alpha ranging from 0.63 to 0.80 ) , and test - retest stability was acceptable ( intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.57 to 0.73 ) .
findings on criterion validity were significant .
patient interviews indicated that the pcq - p had high face validity and acceptability .
feedback from hospitals indicated that they found the questionnaire useful , and highlighted important considerations for its future use as part of quality improvement initiatives .
conclusion the pcq - p has been found to be acceptable to patients and service providers , and is ready for use for the measurement of patient experience in routine practice , service improvement programmes , and research .
background in this paper we report the reliability and validity of a questionnaire to measure the experience of prostate cancer care .
we also report the acceptability of the questionnaire to patients and to hospitals providing care for patients with prostate cancer .
in england , patients with prostate cancer report worse experience of care than patients with other cancers [ 1,2 ] , and the provision of readily usable measures was one element of a wider initiative designed to improve services [ 3,4 ] .
while care outcomes can be assessed through standard measures of health - related quality of life [ 5 ] , which include reports of general health and impact on functioning , no standard measures of patient experience of the process and delivery of prostate cancer care are available [ 6 ] .
in recent years , patient surveys have tended to focus on patient experience of care rather than on satisfaction with care .
satisfaction is a complex concept incorporating patients' expectations , their experience of what happened in care , their feelings about the care they received , and the importance to the patient of the aspect of care concerned .
measures of patients' experience - which comprise patients' reports of what happened in specific aspects of the delivery of care - are simpler to interpret and act upon than measures of satisfaction [ 7 ] .
surveys of experience are now generally preferred by providers , and considered helpful in evaluating and improving services .
in the wake of the nhs next stage review , all nhs organisations will be required to gather and publish information about patient experience of care , as part of a process of working towards high quality of care for all [ 8 ] .
the availability of valid and acceptable measures of patient experience is crucial to ensuring that meaningful data are collected .
to be suitable for wide use , measures of experience need to be developed systematically to address the issues that are important to patients , to be readily understood and acceptable by patients , and to meet standards of reliability and validity .
they should also be acceptable to providers , enabling them to assess specific stages of care , depending on the provider 's focus for quality improvement .
our aim was to develop a robust and acceptable measure suitable for use in routine practice and research .
this paper describes such a measure of patient experience of prostate cancer care - the prostate care questionnaire for patients ( pcq - p ) - and reports on the formal evaluation of the measure 's reliability , validity and acceptability to patients and service providers .
a companion measure for use with carers of men with prostate cancer has also been developed [ 9 ] .
methods development and characteristics of the pcq - p the pcq - p is a measure developed from preliminary research designed to determine the issues most important to prostate cancer patients , including a literature review of the experiences of patients of prostate cancer care , and interviews with patients and service providers [ 10 - 12 ] .
key issues included : information and explanations , involvement in decision making , provision of advice and support , delays in care , choice , coordination of care , and practical issues ( such as travel , and facilities at the hospital ) .
questions on these issues were developed , phrased in the words used by patients .
thorough piloting was undertaken [ 10 ] .
the measure , along with a user guide , is available online for download and use [ 13 ] .
the questionnaire is divided into five sections : gp visits and referral ( section a , 17 questions ) ; tests at the hospital ( section b , 19 questions ) ; diagnosis and treatment decision ( section c , 30 questions ) ; treatment and discharge ( section d , 25 questions ) ; and monitoring ( section e , 15 questions ) .
there is a sixth section to collect health and sociodemographic information ( section f , 10 questions ) .
sections can be administered separately , or in appropriate combinations ( e.g. it may be useful to give sections a , b , and c in combination to patients who have recently received a diagnosis of prostate cancer ) .
a short version of the questionnaire , comprising 24 questions chosen to include the most important issues to patients , is also available [ 10,13 ] .
sampling five hospitals in england were selected to participate in the study to test reliability , validity and acceptability to patients .
hospitals represented a range in terms of urban and rural locality , teaching and non - teaching hospitals , and foundation trust status ( table 1 ) .
each hospital drew a consecutive sample of all patients who had been diagnosed with , or treated for , prostate cancer within the past two years , excluding patients who had died or were too ill to participate ; this produced a list of between 152 and 253 patients per hospital depending on the numbers of patients with prostate cancer under their care .
the sample included patients at different stages of care ( e.g. undergoing treatment , undergoing post - treatment monitoring ) .
a total of 1087 patients were identified .
hospital staff mailed sections of the pcq - p to patients , and non - responders were sent one reminder .
sections a , b , c , and f in combination were sent to 431 patients ( in hospitals 1 and 3 ) , and sections d , e and f to 504 patients ( in hospitals 2 and 4 ) .
one hundred and fifty two patients ( in hospital 5 ) received all 5 sections in combination .

to assess test - retest reliability , 296 patients from two hospital sites ( hospitals 1 and 2 ) were posted the pcq - p questionnaire again three weeks later .
in addition , 20 patients from hospital 5 , who had completed all sections of the pcq - p , took part in semi - structured interviews to explore acceptability and face validity .
eleven face - toface and nine telephone interviews were carried out .
interviews were not transcribed , but notes were taken by the interviewer during the interview .
key properties of the questionnaire sections , including aspects of validity , reliability , and acceptability to patients were analysed .
for the purpose of testing the properties of the questionnaire , overall scores were calculated for each section of the questionnaire , by summing scores across questions and converting to a score out of 100 , with higher scores indicating more positive experiences of care [ 10 ] .
all statistical analyses were conducted using spss version 16.0 .
acceptability to patients acceptability was evaluated by examining completion rates for individual questions and questionnaire sections , and by analysing distributions of responses for individual questions .
acceptability was also assessed in patient interviews , by asking patients how they felt about the experience of completing the questionnaire .
validity criterion validity was assessed by examining pearson correlations between scores on sections b to e of the pcq - p and the ncsrsq .
the ncsrsq did not contain comparable questions for section a of the pcq - p. the ncsrsq is a measure of problems in care , where in contrast to the pcq - p a higher score indicates a less positive experience of care , therefore a negative correlation between the scores on the two questionnaires was expected .
the ncsrq is a generic questionnaire rather than being specific to prostate cancer , and a medium - sized correlation co - efficient ( - 0.3 to - 0.5 ) was expected as an indicator of validity [ 15,16 ] .
face validity was investigated through patient interviews , in which patients were asked to describe their experiences of care in conjunction with inspection of their responses to the questionnaire , as well as being asked directly whether there were any important aspects of care that were not included in the questionnaire .
content validity was assessed through comparing the results of exploratory principal components analysis ( pca ) with themes identified through the preliminary research [ 11,12 ] .
reliability internal consistency reliability for each section was measured using cronbach 's alpha [ 17 ] .
stability reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients ( iccs ) between scores on the first and second completion of the questionnaire .
stability was also assessed by calculating the percentages of patients answering each question the same way on the first and second completion of the questionnaire .
usability and acceptability to service providers the usability and acceptability of the questionnaire to service providers was assessed through inviting a separate sample of hospitals to coordinate and run a patient experience survey using the pcq - p , then seeking feedback on their experiences of this process .
hospitals were recruited via service improvement leads ( sils ) at the cancer networks , who identified hospitals within their network that would be willing to take part in this stage of the study .
four hospitals in england were selected from the list of identified hospitals , selected to ensure a range in terms of urban and rural locality , teaching and non - teaching hospitals , and foundation trust status .
the characteristics of the four hospitals which took part in this separate stage of acceptability testing are given in table 2 .
hospitals were provided with questionnaires , a user guide developed as part of the study [ 13 ] , and software to enable them to enter their data and produce basic summary results .
three hospitals each used a different selection of sections of the full measure , and one hospital used the short version of the questionnaire covering the whole patient journey .
hospitals were asked to survey around 100 patients , and feedback on their experiences was gained through semi - structured interviews with one or two key persons who had administered the survey in each hospital ( total of 5 interviews ) , along with informal discussion with other members of hospital staff .
interviews were not transcribed , but notes were taken by the interviewer during the interview .

this response rate is similar to that achieved for prostate cancer patients in the national survey of nhs cancer patients in 1999 / 2000 [ 18 ] .
the demographic characteristics and health status of responders are summarised in table 3 .

for patients who completed more than 50 % of the questionnaire , missing data for individual questions ranged from 0 % to 15.4 % , the majority showing less than 10 % missing data .
responses to most questions were well distributed across response options .
overall , patients more often reported positive experiences , with mean overall scores ranging from 65.9 to 86.4 across the sections .

one patient commented that his case did not fit well with the sequence of sections as they were presented in the full questionnaire ( compiled from all five subsections ) , and two patients felt that the full questionnaire was too long .
three patients emphasised that each section should be administered as soon as possible after the relevant phase of treatment or care , as they found it difficult to remember in detail events from several months previously .
patients suggested that the sections should be divided and used as separate questionnaires , or with just two to three sections in combination , with appropriate sections being administered as soon as possible after the relevant stage of care .
criterion validity out of 935 patients , 592 ( 63.3 %) completed both a pcq - p and a ncsr questionnaire .
response rates were 224 / 431 ( 52 %) for sections a , b , c , and f , and 368 / 504 ( 73 %) for sections d , e , and f. pearson 's correlation coefficient between sections b and c and the first half ncsrsq was - 0.23 ( p = 0.002 , n = 175 ) , and between sections d and e and the second half ncsrsq was - 0.46 ( p < 0.001 , n = 201 ) .
these correlations are in the expected direction , the first is small and the second is medium [ 15,16 ] , and both are significant at p < 0.005 .
face and content validity all interview participants indicated that the questionnaires covered important aspects of care .
however , several patients highlighted gaps in the section on discharge .
the particular issues identified as important were : knowing what to expect in terms of recovery time and side effects ; and knowing how to obtain appropriate supplies after discharge ( such as continence pads ) .
this led to two questions on these issues being added to the questionnaire .
content validity was assessed through exploratory principal components analysis .
analysis identified three to four components for each section of the questionnaire ( see additional file 1 : exploratory pca ) .
for example in section a ( gp visits and referral ) , three components emerged , and inspection of questions within each component suggested that the components related to : ' explanation ' , ' taking the problem seriously ' and ' experience of referral ' .
comparison of these components with themes from the initial patient interviews and literature review [ 11,12 ] confirmed that the key aspects of care identified in the preliminary research were satisfactorily incorporated in the pcq - p. internal consistency reliability cronbach 's alpha coefficients ranged from 0.63 to 0.80 , indicating moderate to high internal consistency for all sections of the pcq - p ( table 5 ) .

the test - retest iccs for the five sections were between 0.57 and 0.73 , and all were significant at p < 0.001 ( table 5 ) , indicating acceptable reliability [ 19 ] .
the consistency of responses to individual questions was high , between 52.6 % and 100 % of patients answering identically on the first and second mailing .
most questions ( 94 , 88.7 %) , were answered perfectly consistently by over 70 % of responders .
the questions where responses were less consistent were those with a higher number of response options , and for these questions the difference between responses on the first and second completion of the questionnaire tended to be a shift to the neighbouring response option , for example , from ' good ' to ' very good ' .
acceptability to service providers three of the four participating hospitals chose to administer the questionnaire by post , and one used a combination of postal administration and face - to - face administration in urology clinics .
none of the hospitals reported major difficulties with running the survey .
however , the administration of the survey was seen as time consuming , and hospitals found this problematic ; one hospital in particular had difficulty finding staff with time available to run the survey .
hospitals felt that the provision of support to run the survey would be helpful , and one hospital suggested that administering the survey prospectively to patients over a longer period of time would be more manageable and would produce valuable data .
agreement to conduct the survey had initially been obtained from a consultant in each hospital , and some staff felt that an essential first stage would be a meeting involving all staff who would have a role in the administration of the survey .
this would promote ownership of the survey , ensure local support , and provide a setting where input of time could be negotiated .
there were mixed feelings about the involvement of an external organisation to coordinate the survey , possibly on a national basis ; staff described a preference for using surveys as part of their own internal quality improvement process , and were resistant to the idea of surveys being used as an " external stick " ( hospital b ) to raise performance , or being linked to financial incentives .
hospital staff feedback indicated that they found the questionnaire relevant and would value it as a tool for their own use , particularly if benchmarks or comparative data were available from other hospitals .
staff were particularly keen to have access to comparative data for local hospitals , as they felt this would have the greatest impact on efforts to improve quality - they " like to do better than others locally ! !
( hospital a ) .
it is possible to present comparative data on the pcq - p at the level of whole sections , components within sections , and individual questions , using bar charts ( figure 1 illustrates this with data from three of the hospitals involved in reliability and validity testing ) .
although further work is required to establish the components within each section , the pcq - p shows potential to produce data across a range of levels of detail that may be useful in interpreting their results .
for example , inspecting results at the level of section and component scores allows a hospital to identify areas where they may be performing less well than other hospitals , then inspecting specific question results within a component can help pinpoint specific areas of care which may be problematic .
figure 1 comparative data from three hospitals. a. overall scores for section d. b. scores for component ' discharge '. c. percentage of patients responding positively to ' discharge ' question : ' did the doctor or nurse give you any information about who to contact for advice or support ( e.g. specialist nurse , patient support group )?'
discussion the evaluation of the pcq - p demonstrates that the instrument incorporates issues that are important to prostate cancer patients , has good reliability and validity , and is acceptable to patients and service providers .
the pcq - p can be used flexibly - single sections can be used independently or in combination with other relevant sections , and a short version [ 10 ] covering the whole patient journey is also available .
some limitations should be noted .
the evaluation of criterion validity was hampered by the absence of any satisfactory criterion .
no other suitable measure of patient experience of prostate cancer care was available , hence a generic patient experience questionnaire ( ncsrsq ) was used as an indicative criterion .
nevertheless , the findings of the criterion validity check show small to medium sized , but significant , correlations between scores on the pcq - p and the ncsrsq .
taken in conjunction with other tests of the pcq - p 's properties , this provides support for the validity of the pcq - p as a measure of patient experience of prostate cancer care .
the findings of this study confirm that the pcq - p is suitable for use in service improvement programmes .
the study also highlights the approach to using the questionnaire preferred by patients ( sections of the questionnaire administered separately , as soon as possible after the corresponding care stage ) , and indicates important considerations for hospitals planning to use the questionnaire , including ensuring that staff time is made available to administer the questionnaire .
the development of a version of the questionnaire that could be self - administered via computer would be valuable in addressing this problem .
attempts to develop and improve services should include assessment of patient experience when evaluating the impact of changes .
in the uk , the greater involvement of commissioners in the future will present an additional opportunity to monitor and improve patient experience , and patient experience surveys should play a role in this [ 20 ] .
the pcq - p could be used in future national patient surveys .
the use of a robust and acceptable questionnaire , specifically designed to collect experiences of prostate cancer care , would allow gps and hospitals to evaluate their performance on the aspects of care that are most important to prostate cancer patients , and to compare their performance to other , similar gp practices and hospitals .
the establishment of benchmark scores for the questionnaire would be of value in this context , and could be established via a national survey .
conclusion this study has demonstrated how a sophisticated patient experience questionnaire can be developed and evaluated systematically .
although the development process is prolonged , thoroughness in development and testing provides confidence in the data produced by the measure , and increases the value of the data for use in service evaluation and research .
the pcq - p could provide a starting point for the development of instruments for other cancer groups , as many of the issues that it covers are relevant to other cancers .
for example , the need for information and support throughout care is pertinent to the other common cancers , including lung , colorectal , and breast cancer .
new measures would require careful testing before use .
nonetheless , the detailed process undertaken to develop the prostate care questionnaire provides a springboard for developing instruments for other cancers .

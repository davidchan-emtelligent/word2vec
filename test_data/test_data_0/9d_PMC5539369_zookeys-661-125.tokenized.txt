the female adults can be distinguished by the strongly vaulted body and compacted body shape ; rostrum with a small median point ; short antennae which are close together ( only 6 articles in both antennula and antenna ) ; short and wide uropods extending to half the length of the pleotelson ; short dactyli on pereopod 7 ; and large recurved robust setae on the maxilla .
this is the first record of an elthusa schioedte & meinert , 1884 species from the hawaiian islands and only the fifth cymothoid described from this region .

https :// doi.org / 10.3897 / zookeys.661.11251 introduction the cymothoid genus elthusa schioedte & meinert , 1884 was first established in 1884 , with elthusa emarginata ( bleeker , 1857 ) the only known species at the time .
over a century later , bruce ( 1990 ) revised the genus , reclassifying 21 species from livoneca leach , 1818 into elthusa , and adding two new species .
since then , another four species have been described from new caledonia and mexico ( trilles and justine 2004 , 2006 , 2010 , rocha - ramirez et al. 2005 ) .
in their review of cymothoids , smit et al .
( 2014 ) stated that there were 28 known elthusa species .
since then , an elthusa homonym has been corrected ( hadfield et al .
2016a ) , making a current total of 29 recognised species within the genus .
elthusa has a global distribution ( rocha - ramirez et al. 2005 ) , being absent only from polar waters .
while moderately well - known from the caribbean , australia and central indo - pacific , the vast central pacific region has been scarcely studied , with recent records only from new caledonia ( trilles and justine 2004 , 2006 , 2010 ) .
in hawaii , bunkley - williams and williams jr ( 1996 ) listed the isopods known from hawaiian fish hosts , recording only four cymothoid species , namely : anilocra gigantea ( herklots , 1870 ) ; creniola breviceps ( schioedte & meinert , 1881 ) ; cymothoa recta dana , 1853 ; and ichthyoxenus puhi ( bowman , 1960 ) .
this study is the first record of a gill - attaching elthusa species in hawaii , with both the male and female being described for the new species .
methods during a research visit to the smithsonian national museum of natural history in washington dc ( usa ) in november 2014 , an unnamed specimen originally collected in 1959 from acanthurus nigroris valenciennes , 1835 , from oahu , hawaii , was observed .
recently , new material of the same species was collected from the gill rakers of a kole tang , ctenochaetus strigosus ( bennett , 1828 ) , speared by a scuba diver at approximately 20 m depth on 28 september 2015 in marine waters adjacent to the island of niihau , hawaii ( 22.00296 , - 160.11894 ) .
the host fish and parasites were stored frozen at - sea and initially examined approximately one month later at the hawaii institute of marine biology , kaneohe , hawaii .
isopods were subsequently removed from the gill chambers of the host fish and preserved in 70 % ethanol .
all specimens were processed following the techniques recorded in hadfield et al .
( 2010 , 2013 ) .
the female designated as the holotype ( and male paratype ) were minimally dissected in order to conserve the specimens .
the species descriptions were prepared in delta ( descriptive language for taxonomy ) using a general cymothoidae character set ( see hadfield et al. 2016b ) .
isopod classification follows brandt and poore ( 2003 ) and host nomenclature follows that of fishbase ( froese and pauly 2016 ) and catalog of fishes ( eschmeyer 2016 ). abbreviations .

type species .
livoneca emarginata bleeker , 1857 , by monotypy ( schioedte and meinert 1884 ). remarks .
diagnostic characters for elthusa include a weakly vaulted body ; pleonite 1 as wide as or slightly narrower than pleonite 2 ; posterior margin of cephalon not trilobed ; wide pleon ; antennula shorter than antenna , bases not in contact ( varying from close together to wide apart ) ; and pleopods all simple , lamellar .
a revised diagnosis of the genus was provided by bruce ( 1990 ) as well as trilles and randall ( 2011 ) .
elthusa can be regarded as one of the most morphologically varied cymothoid genera , with many elthusa species still requiring detailed study and redescription .
the antennula position ( being close together or far apart ) , shape of the cephalon anterior margin , as well as the width of the pleon and pleonite 5 are some of the varying characters noted within species of this genus ( bruce 1990 ) .
this variation can cause confusion in genus identifications and may lead to incorrect species placement if not taken into account with all of the other genus characters .

named after one of the collectors of the type specimen , morgan winston , who collected the type specimens while diving adjacent to the island of niihau , hawaii. distribution .
known only from hawaii. hosts .
known only from the kole tang , ctenochaetus strigosus , and the bluelined surgeonfish , acanthurus nigroris , both from the family acanthuridae bonaparte , 1835. remarks .
elthusa winstoni sp. n. can be distinguished from all congeners by the irregular , compact body shape ; short antennae ; short and wide uropods only extending to middle of the pleotelson ; and a strongly vaulted body .
this species conforms with many of the elthusa characters in having a wide pleon with pleonite 1 as wide a pleonite 2 ; the cephalon posterior margin is straight ; the antennula bases are not in contact ; and all of the pleopods are simple and lamellar .
elthusa winstoni sp. n. differs from other elthusa species in the asymmetrical , strongly vaulted body and short antennae not extending past the cephalon ( only 6 articles for both antennula and antenna in female , 8 in male ) .
furthermore , the mandibular palp is slender with only one seta , large recurved robust setae on maxilla , short dactyli on pereopod 7 , and a very compact body ( 1.2 - 1.6 times as long as wide ) .
there are no similar cymothoid species from hawaii .
many of the elthusa hosts remain unknown ; however , both acanthurus nigroris and ctenochaetus strigosus appear to be new hosts for elthusa isopods .
creniola breviceps has previously been located on ctenochaetus strigosus in hawaii , but acanthurus nigroris is a new host record for cymothoid isopods .

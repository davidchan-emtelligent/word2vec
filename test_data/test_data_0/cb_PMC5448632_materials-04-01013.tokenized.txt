oxidative polycondensation of 3,4 - ethylenedioxythiophene and ( - ) - myrtenal was carried out with pocl3 .
a pi - conjugated system thus constructed consists of aromatic and quinoidal alternating structure linked via methine groups .
we examined iodine doping effect for the resultant material with electron spin resonance spectroscopy .
circular dichroism spectra in chloroform solution showed blue - shift with increase of iodine concentration .
this result indicates that the doping process can tune chiroptical activity of the chiral pi - conjugated system .
poly ( 3,4 - ethylenedioxythiophene ) chiroptically active materials pi - conjugated materials 1 .
introduction many kinds of conjugated polymers have been widely studied for applications , such as transparent conductors , light - emitting diodes , thin film transistors , and photovoltaic devices [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 ] .
low - bandgap conjugated polymer is of interest because of its sensitivity in optical and electrical impulsions for external stimuli [ 10,11,12,13,14 ] .
poly ( 3,4 - ethylenedioxythiophene ) ( pedot ) and its derivatives are widely studied conjugated polymers due to their relatively low ionization potential , high electrical conductivity , and good stability [ 15,16,17,18,19,20 ] .
a conjugated polymer which has benzenoid and quinonoid alternating structure in the main chain bridged via methine group ( methine polymer ) has been paid much attention because of the relatively small - bandgap [ 21,22,23,24,25,26,27 ] .
polycondensation between arylene unit and aldehyde group in the presence of sulfuric acid has been developed [ 28,29 ] .
the polymerization is shown in scheme 1 .
we synthesized a methine oligomer ( abbreviated as me1 ) from edot and ( - ) - myrtenal , a chiral compound ( scheme 2 ) .
chiroptical activity and doping effect for the resultant thus prepared is examined based on consideration of high sensitivity derived from low - bandgap .
scheme 1 dehydrative polycondensation for methine type polymer .
2. experimental section polycondensation between aldehydes and thiophenes provides novolac - type polymers [ 30 ] .
in this reaction , the protonated aldehyde electrophile can sequentially react with active site ( alpha,alpha ' - position ) of thiophene .
chen and jenekhe proved following elimination of protons at methine linkages by sulfuric acid for producing full pi - conjugated skeleton [ 29 ] .
polycondensation of pyrrole and 1 - dodecanal was carried out for obtaining polypyrrole - methine type pi - conjugated polymers [ 31 ] .
the rothemund type reaction for synthesis of porphyrine can be applied for polycondensation between edot and chiral aldehydes for construction of pi - conjugated main chain [ 32,33 ] .
in this case , bulky group in the substituents can prevent a formation of cyclic compounds .
scheme 2 synthesis of methine bridged oligomer as a main product from 3,4 - ethylenedioxythiophene ( edot ) and ( - ) - myrtenal .
chemicals were purchased from tokyo kasei and aldrich and used as received .
1h nmr measurements of ( - ) - myrtenal and me1 were performed in cdcl3 with ecs 400 spectrometer ( jeol ) at room temperature .
chemical shifts are reported in ppm downfield from sime4 , using the solvent 's residual signal as an internal reference .
fourier transfer infrared ( ftir ) absorption spectra of me1 and ( - ) - myrtenal were obtained by ft / ir - 300 spectrometer ( jasco ) , with the kbr method .
molecular weights of me1 were determined by gel permeation chromatography ( gpc ) with mixed - d hplc column ( polymer laboratories ) , pu - 980 hplc pump ( jasco ) and md - 915 multiwavelength detector ( jasco ) , with thf used as the solvent , with the instruments calibrated by polystyrene standard .
uv - visible absorption spectra were recorded on v - 630 uv - vis optical absorption spectrometer ( jasco ) .
circular dichroism ( cd ) spectra were obtained with j - 720 spectrometer ( jasco ) .
electron spin resonance ( esr ) spectra were taken at room temperature using jes - te200 esr spectrometer ( jeol ) during in - situ vapor phase doping process with iodine .
the target material was synthesized by dehydrative polycondensation between edot and ( - ) - myrtenal with pocl3 .
the reaction was carried out in a schlenk tube .
a solution of edot ( 0.50 g , 3.5 mmol ) , ( - ) - myrtenal ( 0.54 g , 3.6 mmol ) , and pocl3 ( 0.061 g , 0.40 mmol ) in 1,4 - dioxane ( 5 ml ) was refluxed at 80 degreesc for 25 h ( molecular structure of edot and ( - ) - myrtenal are shown in scheme 2 ) .
the reaction mixture was poured into a large amount of methanol .
then , aqueous ammonia was added to remove the catalyst from the resultant .
the crude product was purified by several washes in methanol .
the precipitate was filtered off and dried under reduced pressure to yield the desired compound as a brown color solid .
1h nmr ( 400 mhz , delta from tms ( ppm ) , cdcl3 ) : delta 0.73 - 0.96 , 1.23 - 1.42 , 1.85 - 1.97 , 2.17 - 2.64 , 2.98 , 4.13 , 6.06 - 6.39 , 6.73 .
gpc measurement evaluated that the number average molecular weight ( mn ) is 900 , the weight average molecular weight ( mw ) is 1600 , polydispersity ( mw / mn ) is 1.72 .
this result indicates that the resultant is an oligomer with molecular weight dispersion ( figure 1 ) .
employment of edot as an arylene unit can be expected to avoid side reaction at beta and beta ' positions in the oxidative polycondensation because these parts are protected by the ethylenedioxy group .
figure 1 gpc curve of me1 .
3. results and discussion ir absorption spectra of ( - ) - myrtenal and me1 are examined , as shown in figure 2 .
an absorption band of c - h stretching vibration of the aldehyde group of ( - ) - myrtenal is observed at around 1700 cm - 1 .
on the other hand , ir absorption spectrum of me1 shows no signals at around 1700 cm - 1 .
the absence of the aldehyde signal in the ir absorption spectrum of me1 indicates completion of the polycondensation reaction [ 34,35 ] .
characteristic absorption bands at 1089 cm - 1 and 1360 - 1490 cm - 1 of me1 are attributable to c - o - c asymmetric stretching vibration and c = c stretching vibration of edot , respectively .
1h nmr measurements of me1 and ( - ) - myrtenal were also performed for verification of completion of the reaction .
nmr signals of me1 were totally broadened .
typical signal at 9 - 10 ppm attributed to aldehyde group disappears after the reaction .
this can be due to the fact that the polycondensation between the aldehyde group and arylene units was successfully carried out .
the characteristic signals of edot ( 4.16 ppm , - o - ch2 - ch2 - o - ) and ( - ) - myrtenal ( 0.7 - 2.9 ppm , each alkyl group ) were observed in me1 spectrum except aldehyde signal [ 36 ] .
this result agrees with the ir measurements .
figure 2 ir spectra of me1 and ( - ) - myrtenal .
figure 3 cd spectra of me1 and ( - ) - myrtenal in chcl3 solution .
uv - vis absorption measurements of ( - ) - myrtenal and me1 in chcl3 were examined ( figure 3 ) .
a broad absorption band of me1 indicates that the pi - conjugation length of the backbone is developed .
an optical bandgap of me1 calculated from the absorption spectrum is to be 2.8 ev. therefore , me1 is considered to be a semiconducting organic material .
although the previously reported methine type polymers exhibited extended pi - conjugation and low - bandgap because of benzenoid and quinonoid alternating structure in the main chain , the bandgap value in the present study is relatively large [ 28,37 ] .
this is mainly because of the low degree of the polycondensation .
besides , bulky ( - ) - myrtenal moieties in the side chain might decrease the coplanarity of the main chain .
cd absorption spectra of me1 and ( - ) - myrtenal were obtained in chcl3 solution , as shown in figure 3 .
both spectra show clear cd curves .
broad cd signal of me1 indicates that the backbone of me1 individually shows chiroptical activity .
after the polycondensation , chiroptical activity of the side chain remains and it induces chiroptical activity for the entire system .
such oxidative polycondensation can be simple and convenient method to introduce chiroptical activity for conjugated materials .
we examined a doping effect of iodine ( electron acceptor ) for me1 with uv - vis optical absorption , cd , and esr .
figure 4 shows cd and uv - vis absorption spectra of me1 in chcl3 with various iodine doping levels in solution .
as for uv - vis spectra , clear changes in uv - vis absorption spectrum of me1 were observed upon progress of the doping .
new absorption peaks at 295 nm and 355 nm appeared with progress of the iodine doping .
these two peaks indicate an occurrence of oxidation of me1 by the doping .
furthermore , broad absorption band at 600 - 800 nm appeared gradually .
this suggests generation of radical cations ( charge species , polarons ) for me1 [ 38 ] .
cd spectra of me1 by the iodine doping show blue shift at short wavelengths and decrease of the intensities by the iodine doping .
the blue shift implies that the short helical form induced by the chiral substituent is released by the doping .
color change of me1 in solution with various iodine doping levels is shown in figure 5 .
original color of iodine in a solution is purple .
however , addition of iodine leads changes in color for the material from orange to dark green .
this result suggests that the iodine doping tunes the color and chiroptical activity of me1 .
commission internationale de l'eclairage ( international commission on illumination , cie ) color space confirms the color in the solution , as shown in figure 6 .
figure 4 cd and uv - vis absorption spectra of me1 in chcl3 with various iodine doping levels .
figure 5 color change of me1 in chcl3 solution from orange to green with iodine doping .
figure 6 change in cie color space coordination diagram of me1 with iodine doping .
in - situ esr spectra of me1 with vapor phase iodine doping were measured ( figure 7 ) .
as prepared oligomer shows weak esr signal , indicating incomplete dedoping of pocl3 with aqueous ammonia treatment , or doping with oxygen in the air .
the spin concentration increased rapidly upon the doping .
this indicates a generation of radical cations along the main chain .
figure 8 shows g - value , intensity , and peak width ( deltahpp ) plots vs. the doping time .
the peak width and g - value are constant upon the doping .
however , the intensity is increased by the doping , indicating that the doping is effectively carried out and charge species are generated along the main chain [ 39 ] .
figure 7 in - situ esr spectra during vapor phase iodine doping .
figure 8 g - value , intensity , and peak width ( deltahpp ) of me1 with vapor phase iodine doping for 0 - 10 min .
4. conclusions a new methine pi - conjugated oligomer was synthesized from edot and ( - ) - myrtenal .
this shows a broad absorption band and a cd signal in the long wavelengths .
the chiral side chain induces helical conformation of the main chain to exhibit chiroptical activity .
iodine doping for the oligomer was examined , and the doped state was monitored with the uv - vis optical absorption , the cd , and the esr spectroscopy .
the uv - vis absorption and the esr measurements confirm the formation of radical cations .
cd spectra of the oligomer show blue shift of the cd signal during the doping .
this suggests that the change in electronic structure upon doping tunes its chiroptical activity .

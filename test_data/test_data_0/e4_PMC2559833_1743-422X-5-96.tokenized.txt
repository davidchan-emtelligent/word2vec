the v3 region of both hiv - 1 gp120 and hiv - 2 gp125 surface glycoprotein has been described as a target for neutralizing antibodies .
in this study a conformation - sensitive ( 3c4 ) and a linear site - specific ( 7c8 ) anti - hiv - 2 v3 monoclonal antibody ( mab ) were characterized .
the neutralization capacity of the purified mabs and their respective papain - generated fab fragments was analyzed .
the fabs were further characterized by sequence analysis .
our results demonstrate that neither purified mabs were capable of neutralizing hiv - 2 , while intact fab fragments from both mabs blocked in vitro infection of hiv - 2 isolates .
moreover , the conformation sensitive 3c4 fab neutralized both subtype a and b hiv - 2 isolates and sivsm .
sequence analysis of the hypervariable regions of 3c4 fab and 7c8 fab revealed that the third cdr of the heavy chain ( cdrh3 ) of the antibodies was not as long as many of the previously characterized neutralizing antibodies .
our findings suggest that whole 7c8 and 3c4 mabs are sterically hindered from neutralizing hiv - 2 , whereas the smaller size of fab fragments enables access to the v3 region on the virion surface .
findings the hiv - 1 v3 region has been identified as a target site recognized by neutralizing antibodies [ 1 ] .
monoclonal antibodies ( mabs ) targeting conformational epitopes within the v3 region have been demonstrated to neutralize primary hiv - 1 isolates [ 2 - 5 ] .
furthermore , anti - hiv - 1 v3 - specific mabs have recently been shown to have broad cross - reactivity , which was dependent on the extent of masking of the v1 / v2 regions and the sequence at the crown of the v3 - loop [ 6 ] .
neutralizing antibodies have been reported to bind within the hiv - 2 v3 region [ 7,8 ] , with the fhsq residues at the tip of the v3 - loop [ 9 ] .
however , mabs recognizing the linear ( fhsq ) site on gp125 could not neutralize hiv - 2 isolates [ 9,10 ] .
conversely , a conformational epitope composed of fhsq ( amino acids 315 - 318 in hiv - 2 isy clone ) and wcr ( amino acids 329 - 331 ) has been described in the v3 region of gp125 [ 9,11 ] , where mabs recognizing conformational epitopes in the gp125 v3 region could neutralize hiv - 2 isolates [ 9,12 ] .
while the exposure of the v3 region in hiv - 1 is debated , the accessibility of neutralizing sites on hiv - 2 v3 region has not been as extensively characterized as for hiv - 1 .
previously , two hybridoma cell - lines have been isolated from mice immunized with two overlapping peptides of hiv - 2 spanning the center and c - terminus of the v3 region [ 9 ] .
the hybridoma expressing the 3c4 mab recognized both peptides , while the 7c8 mab recognized only the center of the v3 region .
mouse ascitic fluid containing 3c4 has been reported to neutralize different isolates of hiv - 2 at a dilution of 1:20 , whereas the mouse ascitic fluid containing 7c8 had no neutralizing effect .
further characterization of the binding of these two mabs to recombinant gp125 indicated that 3c4 is conformation sensitive while 7c8 binds to a linear site [ 13 ] .
in this study , the hiv - 2 neutralization capacity of protein a - purified 3c4 and 7c8 mabs was analyzed .
a neutralization assay employing phytohemagglutinin - stimulated pbmcs ( peripheral blood mononuclear cells ) was used [ 14 ] .
two - fold serial dilutions of mab starting at 100 mug / ml were incubated for one hour at 37degreesc with a minimum of 15 tcid50 ( 50 % tissue culture infectious dose ) tissue culture supernatant from virus infected cells .
pbmcs ( 105 ) were then added to the mix and incubated overnight at 37degreesc .
the medium was changed with fresh il - 2 containing medium on the following day and on day 4 .
seven days after infection , supernatants were collected and analyzed for hiv - 2 antigen by a capture elisa [ 15 ] .
the neutralization concentration was defined as the concentration where a 80 % reduction or more of optical density at 490 nm in the culture supernatant was seen as compare to the negative control ( i.e. ic80 ) .
to determine the virus inoculum dose , a tcid50 titration was performed in parallel to each neutralization experiment .
contrary to what has been reported previously for 3c4 , up to 100 mug / ml of the purified mabs did not neutralize any of the hiv - 2 isolates tested ( data not shown ) .
this could be explained by the fact that ascitic fluid contains > 10 mg / ml of mab as well as other components that could alter the neutralization effect .
the lack of neutralization capacity displayed by both the linear - specific ( 7c8 ) and conformation - sensitive ( 3c4 ) antibodies may be related to the accessibility of the epitope recognized by these antibodies .
previous reports on the potent neutralization effect of fabs compared to mabs [ 16,17 ] prompted us to study the effect of the size of mabs on hiv - 2 neutralization capacity .
both 7c8 and 3c4 were digested using papain , and the different digestion products were separated using size - exclusion chromatography ( amersham biosciences ) .
fab fragments were purified using superose - 12 and eluted in a single peak using 20 mm tris buffer .
fractions from this peak were pooled and used in the neutralization assays .
hiv - 2sbl6669 is a cxcr4 co - receptor - using isolate belonging to subtype a. in contrast to the undigested mabs , both 3c4 and 7c8 fabs were capable of neutralizing the homologous hiv - 2sbl6669 isolate ( including the v3 sequence the mabs were generated against ) and the hetrologous ccr5 co - receptor - using laboratory - adapted isolate hiv - 2k135 .
table 1 indicates the concentrations of 3c4 and 7c8 fabs required to neutralize hiv - 2 as determined on at least two different occasions .
hiv - 2sbl6669 and hiv - 2k135 could be neutralized by both 7c8 and 3c4 fabs , where 3c4 fab was capable of viral neutralization at as low a concentration as 0.16 mug / ml. the concentration of 3c4 fab required for neutralization was dependent on the virus inoculum dose , whereas 0.63 mug / ml of 7c8 fab was required in the cases where neutralization was observed .
in all the neutralization assays , the 3c4 fab appeared to be twice as potent in neutralization as was the 7c8 fab .
furthermore , all the primary isolates tested , regardless of co - receptor usage , were neutralized by the 3c4 fab .
since the neutralization sites recognized by 3c4 are conserved in both hiv - 2 and siv , the neutralization of sivsm was also assessed .
sivsm was as efficiently neutralized by the 3c4 fab as the other hiv - 2 isolates tested .

^ very high virus inoculum dose .
- no neutralization observed up to 100 mug / ml. the level of neutralization varied depending on the quality of the fab produced by the papain digestion , where the digestion efficiency varied between experiments .
to further analyze the variation in neutralization efficiency of the generated fab fragments , superdex 75 size - exclusion chromatography column was used .
figure 1a depicts the separation of digestion products , where fabs ( peak ii ) are separated from over - digested fab fragments ( peak iii ) .
fab fragments of molecular weight ~ 47 kda were capable of neutralizing hiv - 2 , whereas over - digested fab fragments with a lower molecular weight of ~ 37 kda were not ( data not shown ) .
the preferential papain digestion sites on antibodies is illustrated in the schematic diagram in figure 1a .
as previously described , over - digestion by papain can release fv from fab fragments [ 18,19 ] , producing a digested fab fragment incapable of viral neutralization .

the bold arrow indicates were papain digests primarily before the cysteine - bridges on mab ( i ) .
the papain can also digest the fab fragment produced ( ii ) , as indicated by dashed arrow .
the digested fab ( iii ) may be missing one of the fv regions. b. the variable regions of 7c8 and 3c4 heavy and light chains , are aligned respectively .
the cdr regions as indicated by immunoglobulin superfamily database [ 31 ] are shaded .
the mechanism underlying the more potent neutralizing effect of fab fragments has been previously correlated with the smaller size of fab fragments compared to the size of whole igg , where steric factors could limit the accessibility to neutralizing epitopes [ 16 ] .
previous reports have also described different neutralization mechanisms between mabs and fabs at the attachment or fusion of the virus with target cells [ 20,21 ] .
to characterize the fab fragments , the variable regions of 7c8 and 3c4 were sequenced according to their subtypes .
sub - typing of 7c8 and 3c4 revealed that both mabs have kappa light chains and that they belong to subtypes igg1 and igg2a , respectively .
alignment of 7c8 and 3c4 variable regions ( figure 1b ) indicated that the light chains of both fabs are more conserved ( 93 % identity ) than the heavy chain ( 53 % identity ) .
the predicted cdr loops are indicated in figure 1b , where the cdr3 loop of 7c8 and 3c4 heavy chains consists of 13 and 11 residues , respectively .
the third cdr of the heavy chain ( cdrh3 ) of an antibody plays a distinctive role in determining antibody specificity [ 22 ] .
sequence analysis of 7c8 cdrh3 revealed a comparatively long region of 13 amino acids ( aa ) , whereas the average length of cdrh3 in mice is between 8 and 9 aa and < 11 % of mice antibodies have a cdrh3 length of > 13 aa [ 22,23 ] .
most human anti - gp120 antibodies have cdrh3 of > 15 aa [ 24 ] , as exemplified by the neutralizing mabs / fab , 17b , b12 , 2f5 , and x5 which recognize different epitopes on gp120 and have cdrh3 lengths of 19 , 18 , 22 , and 22 aa respectively [ 25 - 29 ] .
therefore , we do not believe that the comparatively longer cdrh3 regions of 3c4 and 7c8 would play a strong role in the viral neutralization .
in conclusion , a confirmation sensitive hiv - 2 v3 specific fab was shown to neutralize both hiv - 2 a and b subtypes and sivsm .
further analyses indicate that the smaller size of intact fab fragments may be a determining factor for hiv - 2 v3 - specfic viral neutralization .
these results could provide clues to small molecule anti - hiv inhibitors .

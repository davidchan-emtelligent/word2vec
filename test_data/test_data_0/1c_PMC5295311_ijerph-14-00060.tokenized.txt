research suggests that black youth are less likely to use e - cigarettes than their white counterparts , yet little is known as to why .
we examined perceptions of e - cigarettes among black young adults ( ages 18 - 25 ) to explore the meanings these youth ascribe to e - cigarettes and the role that identity plays in how these devices are viewed .
analysis of in - depth interviews with 36 black smokers and non - smokers in the san francisco bay area suggests that black youth perceive e - cigarettes as serving distinct , yet overlapping roles : a utilitarian function , in that they are recognized as legitimate smoking cessation tools , and a social function , insofar as they serve to mark social identity , specifically a social identity from which our participants disassociated .
participants described e - cigarette users in highly racialized and classed terms and generally expressed disinterest in using e - cigarettes , due in part perhaps to the fact that use of these devices would signal alignment with a middle class , hipster identity .
this analysis is discussed within a highly charged political and public health debate about the benefits and harms associated with e - cigarette use .
ends black youth cultural commodity identity 1 .
introduction use of electronic nicotine delivery systems ( ends ) , e.g. , e - cigarettes , is increasing among youth in the united states [ 1 ] .
while the devices are purportedly marketed to adult smokers as alternatives to cigarettes or as smoking cessation devices , research suggests that young people with no history of cigarette use are increasingly experimenting with e - cigarettes .
the first measure of e - cigarette use among u.s. adolescents was undertaken in the national youth tobacco survey ( nyts ) ( 2011 - 2012 ) .
at that time , 3 % of surveyed high school students had used e - cigarettes [ 2 ] .
more recent research suggests that the number of adolescents and young people using e - cigarettes has increased [ 3 ] .
for example , data collected from nyts 2015 suggests that approximately 16 % of all high school students in the united states currently use e - cigarettes [ 4 ] .
the public health implications of this increase are currently a subject of debate [ 5,6,7 ] .
though e - cigarettes appear to be increasing in popularity among youth and young adults generally , e - cigarette initiation and use nevertheless varies across youth groups .
similar to patterns of conventional cigarette use [ 8 ] , black adolescents may initiate e - cigarette use later and be less likely to continue using e - cigarettes compared to their white or hispanic counterparts [ 4,9 ] .
for example , lippert et al .
( 2015 ) surveyed over 15,000 6th through 12th graders in the u.s. and found that black students were significantly less likely to have ever used e - cigarettes compared to white students [ 10 ] .
in addition , data from the nyts 2015 suggests that only 8.9 % of black high school students used e - cigarettes in the past 30 days e - cigarettes compared to 17.2 % of non - hispanic white students .
similar trends are present among young adults .
mcmillen and colleagues ( 2015 ) conducted nationally representative surveys each year between 2010 and 2013 .
among young adults aged 18 to 24 , current e - cigarette use increased in prevalence from 0 % to 14 % during this time [ 1 ] .
among black young adults , however , only modest increases in the prevalence of e - cigarette use were observed , suggesting less adoption of e - cigarettes among black youth compared to white or " other " ethnic youth .
lower prevalence of e - cigarette use among black youth raises questions about how black youth perceive of these devices , yet , to date , the research is unclear .
for example , wackowski and colleagues ( 2016 ) found that though a majority of young adults perceive e - cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes , the same is not true for black young adults [ 5 ] .
conversely , peters and colleagues ( 2016 ) surveyed 47 teenage boys in the southern u.s. who currently use e - cigarettes , approximately half of whom were black [ 11 ] .
analysis of the focus group data suggested a widespread belief among participants , regardless of ethnicity , that e - cigarettes were healthier than cigarettes [ 11 ]. from a public health perspective , lower e - cigarette uptake among black youth may be regarded positively or negatively [ 12 ] .
though the biomedical literature argues that any nicotine is problematic for young people due to issues related to brain development and long - term nicotine dependency , alternatively social scientists have raised critical questions about the degree to which e - cigarettes play an important role in tobacco harm reduction [ 12,13 ]. from this point of view , lower levels of e - cigarette uptake among cigarette smokers may represent more , not fewer , deaths from tobacco - related illnesses than would have occurred with increased e - cigarette uptake among those who might otherwise have smoked cigarettes , though early empirical evidence for this is mixed [ 14,15,16 ] .
consequently , questions may be raised about the rejection of these devices among groups who have a high prevalence of smoking , such as low - income black adults .
since most people who smoke initiate in adolescence or young adulthood [ 17 ] , understanding nicotine and tobacco use from young people 's perspectives is important for developing prevention and policy efforts that are effective in reducing addiction and the overall prevalence of smoking [ 17,18,19 ] .
to begin to explore the relatively low levels of adoption of e - cigarettes among black youth and young adults , we sought to gain a greater understanding of the ways in which these youth perceive e - cigarettes , with a focus on exploring why some choose to use or not use these devices .
conceptual framework to understand how black youth perceive e - cigarettes , we draw on social science theories regarding social and cultural identity and the use of commodities to communicate those identities [ 20 ] .
nearly all goods signal some social information , whether that be the reinforcement of cultural boundaries , social status , kinship or belonging [ 21,22 ] .
as such , e - cigarettes are not solely physiologically or psychologically important , but their use is also tied to the construction of social identities that differentiate youth cultures .
cultural attitudes towards products are shaped by the degree to which products are associated with utilitarian functions ( e.g. , an alternative to smoking or as a way to relieve stress ) , as well as social identity functions ( e.g. , indicating group membership ) [ 23 ] .
in this way , consumer products take on a social signaling role , with the use of a given product signaling values and characteristics of the user , including attributes of the user 's social identity , to others [ 23 ] .
as douglas and isherwood argue , " commodities are good for thinking : treat them as a non - verbal medium for the human creative faculty " [ 20 ] ( p. 40 ) .
individuals may also choose not to use a product , or actively avoid certain objects or behaviors in order to disassociate with social groups [ 23 ] .
in this case , the decision not to use a specific product or engage in a particular behavior also serves to communicate identity [ 23,24 ] .
berger and rand ( 2008 ) proffer a simple anecdotal example of dissociative signaling in a survey of undergraduate students at stanford university , who collectively spurn bicycle helmets despite the numerous accidents that occur on campus each year and the known protective benefits of helmet - wearing [ 25 ] .
undergraduates cited a strong desire not to be mistaken for graduate students who do tend to wear helmets .
in this scenario , choosing not to wear a helmet served as a social signal that the cyclist was not a graduate student , and the signaling function of helmet - wearing , or non - helmet - wearing , superseded the unequivocally positive utilitarian function [ 25 ] .
thus , dissociative signaling can have a powerful influence on individual behavior , making products more or less attractive or accessible to different youth groups .
in this paper , we are concerned with understanding the ways in which e - cigarettes are socially positioned as cultural commodities , facilitating their use for some and their rejection for others .
2. methodology 2.1 .
research design between april 2014 and july 2015 , we conducted multiple method in - depth interviews with 46 black ( ages 18 - 25 ) smokers and non - smokers in the san francisco bay area for a study designed to understand perceptions of tobacco control policies and the intersections of tobacco - related stigma with other social identity stigmas ( e.g. , race , gender , socio - economic status ). of the 46 participants in the study , 36 participants discussed these devices in their interviews , and 15 had used e - cigarettes at some point in the past .
participants were recruited on the street , through facebook and craigslist advertising , and by referrals .
the interview guide was informed by ( 1 ) existing qualitative research on smoking among youth as well as by ( 2 ) exploratory focus groups we conducted with black youth prior to data collection in an effort to identify potentially salient issues [ 26 ] .
e - cigarette questions and probes were included for exploration , since this topic was not the main purpose of the study .
given the lack of literature on e - cigarettes among youth of color , an exploratory investigation was appropriate [ 27 ] .
the interview guide resulted in closed - ended questions to collect basic demographic information about nicotine and tobacco use , and open - ended questions about the background of the participant , racial identity , personal tobacco and e - cigarette use , smoking identity , beliefs about tobacco , the social acceptability of tobacco , and perceptions and use of e - cigarettes .
interviews lasted approximately two and a half hours and were digitally recorded .
to show our appreciation for their time , participants received a $ 40 honorarium .
all study procedures were approved by the pacific institute for research and evaluation institutional review board ( the pire irb project number is 987961 - 2 ) .
2.2 .
analysis following the interviews , the interviewer completed field notes to record preliminary analytical ideas emergent from interviews and to contextualize interviews with descriptive information not captured in audio recordings .
interviews were digitally recorded and professionally transcribed .
two research staff coded transcripts to distill data into manageable analytical segments , using atlas.ti ( atlas.ti scientific software development gmbh , berlin , germany ) , a qualitative data management system .
during the coding process , researchers wrote memos to capture their analytical thinking about the data .
memos serve to contextualize coded narrative data with researchers' emergent interpretations that are based on the entire context of the interview .
the code list was extensive to capture main study objectives , but for the purposes of the present analysis , only one relevant code was included ( i.e. , ends ) which indexed any narrative in interviews that either referenced e - cigarettes directly or was relevant to understanding perceptions of e - cigarettes .
after the coding process , the lead author conducted a second more directed yet exploratory pattern - level analysis of all narrative segments coded as ends and all related memos .
patterns of emergent themes were identified primarily by examining the frequency and omission of topics across interviews [ 28 ] .
frequency refers to a theme emerging as particularly salient across all interviews , while omission is defined by themes identified in the literature as salient yet surprisingly absent in the empirical data for the study .
this process revealed rich insight into the meaning and perceived role of e - cigarettes for study participants .
pseudonyms , selected by participants , are used throughout the findings to identify quotations .
3. findings analysis of the patterns of participants' narratives illustrated that black youth in this study perceive e - cigarettes as serving distinct , yet overlapping roles : a utilitarian function , in that they are recognized as legitimate smoking cessation tools , and a social function , insofar as they serve to mark social identity , specifically a social identity from which our participants disassociated .
the majority of participants in this study were of low socio - economic status , with a household income of less than $ 35,000 usd , technically classified as living in poverty in the san francisco bay area .
twenty - four young women and 22 young men comprised the sample .
twenty - five participants were current tobacco or nicotine users defined by past 30 - day use .
among the 15 ever e - cigarette users , 12 had used e - cigarettes in the previous year , and among these , all reported smoking cigarettes in the previous 30 days .
among the 36 respondents whose interviews included discussion of e - cigarettes , 21 were current smokers ( 10 men , 11 women ) and 15 were non - smokers ( five men , 10 women ) .
3.1 .
social identity function of ends overall , participants in our study described the stereotypical e - cigarette user as someone racially , socio - economically , and / or socially different from themselves .
participants emphasized that e - cigarettes " were n't for them ," ascribing social meanings to e - cigarette users from which participants in our study sought to disassociate .
for example , " z " , a 24 - year - old non - smoking man , who has not used e - cigarettes , identified a " typical " e - cigarette user as : " a higher - income person , ( someone ) who goes to the doctor and feels guilty about smoking cigarettes and tobacco , and is into technology and ( chuckles ) maybe rides a bike. " the perception of a typical e - cigarette user as someone who is affluent was common among our participants , as was the concept of e - cigarettes being popular among " hipsters " and " techies " as is alluded to in the quote above and reinforced in other participants' narratives .
for example , " jazzy " , an 18 - year - old non - smoking woman , who does not use e - cigarettes , succinctly positioned e - cigarettes as a marker of social identity when describing them as products for people who are trying to look cool or trendy : " i feel like a lot of hipsters use e - cigarettes .
a hipster is someone who tries to fit in with a certain image because it looks cool .
e - cigs are very trendy so they 're like ' ooh i look so cool with my e - cig. '" although hipster culture is notoriously difficult to define [ 29,30 ] , it is generally characterized by a rejection of mainstream social norms , including through the adoption of smoking cigarettes , which are broadly stigmatized by society and therefore well situated to communicate hipster sensibilities .
in their ethnographic exploration of hipster subculture , maly and varis note that " commodification and consumption is intrinsically connected to being a hipster ," since hipsters use consumer products to seek an " authenticity " that is defined in opposition to " mainstream " culture [ 29 ] ( p. 4 ) .
thus hipsters are avatars of the " very trendy " , adopting new products and behaviors in a continual effort to evade mainstream co - optation .
the demographics of hipster cultures primarily include white , urban , middle class individuals who are generally between the ages of 25 - 35 [ 29 ] .
as such , hipster cultures have long been criticized for lacking class and racial and ethnic diversity [ 30 ] .
like these critiques about hipsters in general , narratives about who uses e - cigarettes were highly racialized and classed .
for example , " diane " , a 22 - year - old non - smoker who does not use e - cigarettes , explained that e - cigarette users are : "... non - black people ...
so similarly with the cigarette smoking , actually having a cigarette , that is mostly white people .
then secondary , non - black people , non - white people .
but with the e - cigarettes , i suppose it would just be non - blacks .
i 've seen asians smoking as well . "
" jane doe " , a 24 - year - old woman who smokes , also stated that e - cigarettes are not something that she sees in the black community : " i sure do n't see black people smoking them ...
i see black people smoking real cigarettes .
i never see black people with e - cigarettes or vapors ..." she considered trying e - cigarettes but did not .
meanwhile " dee " , a 24 - year - old woman who smokes , but does not use e - cigarettes , highlighted socioeconomic factors that may contribute to the association of e - cigarettes with the " commodification and consumption ( that ) is intrinsically connected to being a hipster " [ 29 ] .
" who do i see smoking e - cigarettes ?
upper class individuals .
i have n't seen a person of color smoking those e - cigarettes ' cause they 're kind of expensive. '" she went on to state that : " usually i see affluent people smoking those ...
i do n't think they sell those in marginalized communities ... .
" keeno " , a non - smoking , non - e - cigarette - using man aged 24 , reinforces the notion that e - cigarettes signal membership in an external group (" tech show " participants ) typically associated with a hipster style of consumption .
noting increasing e - cigarette use in oakland and san francisco , keeno observes : " let 's just be straightforward .
particularly , i 've seen them in the hands of european americans , white folks ...
i worked this tech show last week in san francisco and i saw people with it. " from a public health perspective , the disassociation of e - cigarettes among black youth who smoke may be problematic due to the potential health benefits of switching from conventional smoking to e - cigarettes .
one participant , " lee " , a non - smoking man aged 21 , commented that he hoped e - cigarettes would become more than just a subcultural phenomenon , raising the possibility of harm reduction through e - cigarette use for black youth who smoke .
lee had tried e - cigarettes in the past , but did not like them , and only occasionally " takes a few puffs " from friends' devices .
" i see a lot more business people with vape pens nowadays taking a ...
break outside instead of cigarettes .
so that 's a good thing , in my opinion ...
maybe young black kids will prefer those over ...
cigarettes at some point in time. " lee 's comment points to how e - cigarettes can be positively perceived for their utilitarian functions but still rejected when they are socially positioned as cultural commodities that signal membership in a group from which a particular youth group may be disassociated .
3.2 .
utilitarian function of e - cigarettes in addition to the social identity signaling of e - cigarette use , analysis of the narrative data suggests that e - cigarettes were perceived to serve important utilitarian functions for some people - - i.e. , for smoking reduction or cessation or for minimizing cravings when smoking is prohibited .
according to " lee " , above , e - cigarettes are targeted " towards an older audience , you know , people that are trying to quit smoking or that are looking for an alternative for whatever reason " .
" black tar rebellion " , for example , a 21 - year - old non - smoking woman , summarizes the typical e - cigarette user as : " somebody who wants to quit or somebody who does n't want to smell like cigarettes. " black tar rebellion , who has never smoked , briefly used a nicotine - free vape pen as a way to look rebellious , but gave it up after experiencing negative health effects .
participants generally regarded people who used e - cigarettes for their utilitarian function as opposed to their social identity function more positively , and their perceptions of the typical utilitarian user did not tend to carry connotations of race and class .
" jazzy " , for example , who mocked the typical e - cigarette user as a hipster who just wants to look " cool " , acknowledged a utilitarian role of e - cigarettes and stated that she has more respect for people who use e - cigarettes to quit smoking , as opposed to adopting a new trend : " some people who actually had a habit of smoking cigarettes , who are trying to be better , they use them .
i respect them way more. " though participants in this study tended to disassociate from vapers and vaping , 15 participants nevertheless had experimented with e - cigarettes .
in general , their initial motivation for trying the devices stemmed from health concerns about smoking , and they had heard that e - cigarettes might help to facilitate cessation .
notably , however , there was skepticism about the effectiveness of e - cigarettes as cessation tools , and not just among the participants who had tried the devices .
for example , " karoline " , a non - smoking woman aged 19 , believed that e - cigarettes were primarily for individuals who cannot quit smoking , though she questioned the extent to which they work .
" people who smoke e - cigarettes are trying to get off cigarettes and they just ca n't go cold - turkey , so that 's like their in - between ...
but it 's very ineffective on that in - between to get you off of it. " similarly , " jazzy " described an acquaintance who used e - cigarettes to quit smoking , but who was ultimately unsuccessful .
" he had an e - cig , ' cause my mom bought it for him i think ' cause she wanted to help him .
she was happy that he was trying to be better , so in order to help him on his journey , she got him some e - cigs .
he would charge it. everything was cool .
he stopped using cigarettes .
now he 's just using his e - cig .
then after that , the next step would have been , ' okay , now you 're not even using an e - cig and you 're good .
you 're fine .
you do n't even need it. '.. .
he ended up relapsing. " in addition to skepticism about the effectiveness of e - cigarettes for smoking cessation , participants in this study who smoked were generally not interested in switching to e - cigarettes due to questions about their safety .
for example , " marley " , a 22 - year - old smoker who had tried e - cigarettes to quit smoking , believes that e - cigarettes are just as harmful as cigarettes .
" it 's just weird that they say it 's not smoke , but then i learned that they about have the same , like , bad stuff as cigarettes .
i thought it was healthier. that 's why i was doing it. but there 's no difference. " similarly , " jade ," a 22 - year - old smoker , questioned the point of switching from cigarettes to e - cigarettes : " this makes me wanna know a lot more about e - cigarettes , like what 's in them , why it 's okay to switch to e - cigarettes and it 's okay to maintain that habit , but not regular tobacco cigarettes .
so i wanna know what the differences are , but then also , why is the solution to stopping one habit starting another ..." notably , however , among the few participants who reported regular use of e - cigarettes was " nefarious ," a 21 - year - old woman who was using e - cigarettes to cut down on smoking and to minimize what she perceives to be negative consequences of smoking .
" i smoke like two cigarettes a day .
but i 'll try the vape pen most of the time .
like today , i forgot my vape pen , so i 'm like , damn it , i 'm gonna have to go get a cigarette .
i try to do as much of the vape pen as i can. " she goes on to say that she originally purchased a vaping device because of : " the smell ( of cigarettes ). that 's why i got the vape pen ...
i do n't smell like anything .
it 's all sweet and fruity .
i still smoke like two cigarettes , but i 've been working since i was homeless to not smell like cigarettes .
i was smelling like straight up cigarettes and god knows what else when i was homeless .
i did not like that .
my friends did n't like it. " here nefarious' use of e - cigarettes in combination with cigarettes can be described as " dual use ," about which researchers in public health have expressed great concern due to the potential of dual use to exacerbate nicotine addiction and reinforce smoking [ 31,32,33 ] .
however , nefarious 's dual use of cigarettes and e - cigarettes illustrates her attempt to minimize the social harms associated with smoking and the ability of e - cigarettes to negate those harms .
attempting to avoid the stigma associated with smoking , in terms of smell as well as other perceived negative stereotypes of smokers , is not uncommon , particularly for people who experience multiple stigmas , including homelessness such as in nefarious' experience [ 34,35 ] .
few participants had adopted positions similar to nefarious , however .
instead , participants in this study generally expressed safety concerns and / or skepticism about the effectiveness of e - cigarettes for cessation and few participants were using the devices .
research by camenga and colleagues , who conducted focus groups with middle school , high school , and college students , also found that adolescents and young adults were skeptical about the efficacy of e - cigarettes in successful smoking cessation .
nevertheless , their participants generally perceived e - cigarettes to be less harmful than cigarettes [ 31 ] .
conversely , participants in our study tended to believe e - cigarettes were " just as harmful " as smoking , a belief reinforced by contemporary health media messages [ 36 ] .
4. limitations findings should be considered in light of the following limitations .
importantly , this exploratory analysis is based on the narratives of 36 black women and men who were selected purposively for a study on perceptions of tobacco control strategies and experiences with multiple stigmas .
narrative surrounding e - cigarettes emerged occasionally throughout interviews , and after conducting 10 interviews for the study , we integrated a few open - ended questions about perceptions of e - cigarettes .
as such , this study was not designed around understanding perceptions of e - cigarettes among black youth , and , therefore , findings should be considered in light of this important limitation .
additionally , the study is limited in scope by the relatively small , non - random sample .
although this study is not necessarily a representative sample of black youth in the san francisco bay area , we did attempt to recruit a diverse range of participants ( e.g. , race / ethnicity , gender , geography , social class ) by using a multi - tiered recruitment strategy to reach participants from a variety of social contexts and networks .
notably , qualitative research does not aim for traditional conceptualizations of generalizability or representativeness .
instead , it aims to maximize the variation of perspectives among participants to develop theory that can be tested in future large - scale studies .
a final limitation to note here is that the theoretical ideas discussed in this paper are based on our research team 's interpretation of participants' narratives , and multiple interpretations of these narratives are possible .
however , we integrate standard procedures into our study designs in an effort to reduce threats to the valid interpretation of data and enhance reliability to justify analytical generalizability , i.e. , the likelihood that the theoretical contribution from our study is applicable to another situation .
5. discussion as douglas and isherwood wrote , " goods that minister to physical needs ... are no less carriers of meaning than ballet or poetry " [ 20 ] ( p. 49 ) .
this assertion is supported by our study which illustrates how e - cigarettes , which are perceived by participants to be highly utilitarian , also are defined by the meanings they communicate to others when consumed .
in particular , study participants offered clear individuating descriptions of a typical e - cigarette user , such as " hipster " and " rides a bike " .
there is evidence of a hipster association with e - cigarettes in the literature .
tobacco companies have actively courted hipsters [ 37 ] , and the same appears to be true of marketers of ends devices , with the makers of several popular brands of e - cigarettes incorporating elements of hipster subculture in advertisements , including retro tropes such as traditional cocktails , clothing , and craft beer [ 37 ] .
e - cigarette advertising overtly highlights the hip non - conformity and intrinsic coolness of vaping .
health , 2001 describes coolness as the " central status hierarchy in contemporary urban society " [ 38 ] .
however , what is " cool " is largely determined by cultural affinity , and even within a given culture , what is cool for one group may not be cool for another .
inasmuch as the use of e - cigarettes signals group membership , non - use of e - cigarettes also communicates meaning about social identities .
it may be that our participants express disinterest in e - cigarettes for several reasons , but arguably an underlying context of this disassociation is related to social identity .
we theorize that the rejection of e - cigarettes among our study participants who smoke is , in part , a function of dissociative signaling from a white , middle class , hipster social identity .
using e - cigarettes , even for their utilitarian function , would nevertheless signal membership in a racial , social , and socioeconomic status group that does not represent the identities of participants .
research in consumer psychology has explored why consumers will refuse to use or cease to use a product when it is associated with an unfavorable group [ 25,39 ] .
for example , white and dahl ( 2006 ) posit that individuals will avoid products associated with an out group in order to reaffirm their own group status .
they argue that men , for example , tend to avoid or entirely refuse products commonly viewed as " feminine " , which reaffirms their own masculinity and group solidarity [ 39 ] .
returning to berger and rand 's ( 2008 ) survey of helmet wearing , dissociative signaling can become problematic when the device or commodity in question has the potential to improve the health or well - being of the user [ 25 ] .
in our study , participants clearly viewed e - cigarettes as a tool that could aid in smoking cessation .
however , study participants who smoked , some of whom indicated an interest in quitting or reducing their smoking , nevertheless expressed disinterest in e - cigarettes due to their association with other youth cultural groups .
as " lee " points out above , e - cigarettes may be inaccessible to some black youth , which may harm them in the long run .
this situation is problematic from a range of harm reductionist viewpoints , which may incorporate claims that continue to be a source of controversy among public health advocates ( for example , that e - cigarettes can help smokers to quit [ 16,40 ]) , as well as claims that are increasingly accepted across a range of public health perspectives to varying degrees .
to what extent may the very rejection of e - cigarettes among black youth who smoke work to further perpetuate tobacco - related health inequity ?
it is well established that despite initiating cigarette smoking later and smoking fewer cigarettes per day than their white counterparts , black smokers have lower rates of smoking cessation and a younger average age of onset of lung cancer [ 41 ] .
black men , in particular , have a higher incidence of and mortality from tobacco - related cancers compared to white men [ 42 ] .
since combustible tobacco use is believed to cause a considerably higher risk of cancer than e - cigarette use , it is possible that the rejection of ends by young black smokers could be an important barrier to decreasing mortality in this population [ 43 ] .
6. conclusions whether or not e - cigarettes are a viable long - term strategy for tobacco - related harm reduction has yet to be determined [ 40 ] .
some public health organizations outside of the u.s. are actively encouraging smokers to switch to e - cigarettes as a step towards cessation or for harm reduction , whereas public health agencies in the u.s. tended to reject this approach .
there is clear conflict within the international public health community as to the role of e - cigarettes for smoking cessation with recent meta - analyses calling onto question the long - term efficacy [ 44,45 ] .
however , as the population - level prevalence of smoking remains low and significant inequities in smoking and related illnesses persist , we have to prioritize alternative approaches that work to reduce tobacco - related inequities , particularly among populations such as blacks , with disproportionately high prevalence of tobacco - related disease .
some critical scholars have argued that the e - cigarette has the potential to serve as a disruptive innovation and eradicate smoking entirely [ 12,46,47 ] .
though we are more cautious in our interpretation , we do acknowledge that studies among adults suggest that e - cigarettes can be an effective smoking cessation tool , and the majority of adult users are current or former smokers [ 48,49 ] .
studies among youth have found that there is a low prevalence of e - cigarette use among non - smoking youth , and that youth who do smoke view e - cigarettes as a less harmful alternative [ 50 ] .
in our study , participants expressed disinterest in e - cigarettes for a variety of reasons , most notably because they project a social image that is unacceptable to them .
however , these young adults did recognize the potential for e - cigarettes to serve as a smoking cessation tool , but concerns were expressed about their potential safety and / or effectiveness .
if evidence accumulates that e - cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking and are effective in smoking cessation , then our findings suggesting that black youth who smoke are disinterested in switching from smoking to vaping are especially problematic in terms of health equity .

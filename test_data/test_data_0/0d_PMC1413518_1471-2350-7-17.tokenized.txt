background elevated resting heart rate has been shown in multiple studies to be a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease .
previous family studies have shown a significant heritable component to heart rate with several groups conducting genomic linkage scans to identify quantitative trait loci .
methods we performed a genome - wide linkage scan to identify quantitative trait loci influencing resting heart rate among 3,282 caucasians and 3,989 african - americans in three independent networks comprising the family blood pressure program ( fbpp ) using 368 microsatellite markers .
mean heart rate measurements were used in a regression model including covariates for age , body mass index , pack - years , currently drinking alcohol ( yes / no ) , hypertension status and medication usage to create a standardized residual for each gender / ethnic group within each study network .
this residual was used in a nonparametric variance component model to generate a lod score and a corresponding p value for each ethnic group within each study network .
p values from each ethnic group and study network were merged using an adjusted fisher 's combining p values method and the resulting p values were converted to lod scores .
the entire analysis was redone after individuals currently taking beta - blocker medication were removed .
results we identified significant evidence of linkage ( lod = 4.62 ) to chromosome 10 near 142.78 cm in the caucasian group of hypergen. between race and network groups we identified a lod score of 1.86 on chromosome 5 ( between 39.99 and 45.34 cm ) in african - americans in the genoa network and the same region produced a lod score of 1.12 among caucasians within a different network ( hypergen ) .
combining all network and race groups we identified a lod score of 1.92 ( p = 0.0013 ) on chromosome 5p13 - 14 .
we assessed heterogeneity for this locus between networks and ethnic groups and found significant evidence for low heterogeneity ( p <= 0.05 ) .
conclusion we found replication ( lod > 1 ) between ethnic groups and between study networks with low heterogeneity on chromosome 5p13 - 14 suggesting that a gene in this region influences resting heart rate .
background heart rate has been implicated as a risk factor in cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) [ 1 - 9 ] , cancer [ 10,11 ] , and sudden death in middle - aged men [ 12 ] .
furthermore , elevated heart rate has been shown to be an independent predictor of cvd [ 8,10,13 ] .
even after other risk factors have been controlled for , resting heart rate remains significantly associated with cardiovascular mortality and total mortality [ 10 ] .
singh et al .
[ 14 ] and more recently kupper et al .
[ 15 ] reported that there is a significant genetic component to heart rate variability .
moreover , loci that influence heart rate have been located in a number of organisms including humans [ 16,17 ] , mice [ 18 ] , rats [ 19 - 21 ] and drosophila [ 22 ] .
in a population of normotensive and hypertensive individuals martin et al [ 23 ] report significant evidence of linkage ( lod = 3.9 ) on chromosome 4q for resting heart rate .
on chromosome 10 , a serine / glycine ( ser49gly ) substitution polymorphism in the beta1 adrenergic receptor was found to be highly associated with heart rate in a chinese and japanese hypertensive cohort , with higher mean heart rates occurring in individuals that are serine homozygotes [ 24 ] .
due to its importance in predicting cardiovascular and all - cause mortality , we have used data from caucasians and african - americans enrolled in the nhlbi family blood pressure program to evaluate genetic factors associated with resting heart rate .
we report a meta - analysis of genome scans within the gennet , genoa , and hypergen networks , using genotyping carried out by the mammalian genotyping service .
methods study participants subjects were recruited by four multicenter networks investigating the genetics of hypertension / blood pressure ( bp ) known collectively as the family blood pressure program ( fbpp )[ 25 ] .
data from 3 of the 4 networks [ gennet [ 26 ] , genoa [ 27 ] , and hypergen [ 28 ] were appropriate for the present analysis .
gennet sampled caucasian and african american families through mostly unmedicated probands with elevated bp levels who were younger than the age typically associated with the onset of hypertension .
genoa sampled 553 caucasian and african american families with at least two full siblings with essential hypertension diagnosed before the age of sixty .
hypergen sampled caucasian and african american families that contained hypertensive sibships .
the present analyses were based on a total of 7,271 subjects .
there were 542 caucasians ( from 203 families ) and 776 african - americans ( from 281 families ) in gennet ; 1,400 caucasians ( from 481 families ) and 1,695 african americans ( from 547 families ) in genoa ; and 1,340 caucasians ( from 583 families ) and 1,518 african americans ( from 684 families ) in hypergen who had both genotyping and data on resting heart rate and other covariates for adjustment of the phenotype .
each network has been approved by the appropriate local institutional review board and all participants provided informed written consent .
heart rate measurement prior to examination , participants were told to avoid caffeinated products such as tea , coffee , and chocolate as well as any other food and heavy physical activity for twelve hours .
clinical examinations all took place in the morning .
after being seated for five minutes , heart rate and blood pressure were measured by arterial pulsations measured from the upper arm using either a dinamap or omron automatic blood pressure monitor .
a measure of heart rate derived from 24 hour monitoring would be ideal ; however , the feasibility of such a measure on this number of participants is limited .
genoa and hypergen networks exclusively used the dinamap monitor , whereas the gennet network used both blood pressure monitors , with 71.3 % of patients measured with a dinamap monitor and 28.7 % of patients measured with an omron monitor .
each device was turned off and allowed to recalibrate between participants .
mean heart rate was calculated either from three ( for the dinamap monitor ) or two ( for the omron monitor ) measurements taken in a six minute interval to control for intra - individual variability .
genotyping blood was drawn into three 10 ml vacutainer tubes containing edta .
genomic dna was isolated using standard protocols .
the mammalian genotyping service ( mgs ) in marshfield , wi completed each genome screening using the same set of 368 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers for each network .
these markers have an average heterozygosity of ~ 80 % , an average intermarker distance of 10 cm , and cover ~ 95 % of the human genome .
specific details on gel preparation , pcr conditions , and the genetic map were reported by weber and broman [ 29 ] and are available from the mgs website [ 30 ] .
covariate measurement questionnaires were used to collect information on potentially confounding factors for heart rate including age , sex , smoking , alcohol use , and medication usage .
medication use was also assessed by inventory of the participant 's current prescriptions .
height and weight for the calculation of body mass index ( bmi ) were ascertained during the participant 's clinical examination .
smoking habits were defined by three categories : non - smoker , current smoker and past smoker and , if the participant answered yes to smoking currently or in the past , total pack years were calculated .
alcohol use was assessed by inquiring whether the person " presently drinks alcoholic beverages " .
hypertension was designated for participants if they met any of three criteria : ( 1 ) currently taking anti - hypertension medication ( 2 ) average diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mmhg or ( 3 ) average systolic blood pressure >= 140 mmhg .
in addition , normotensive individuals were defined as not being hypertensive or hypotensive .
previous reports of the effect of different hypertension medication use on heart rate within the networks of the fbpp have shown that beta - blocker medication users had , on average , a significantly lower heart rate than non - users [ 16 ] .
therefore , we adjusted heart rate for beta - blocker medication use and excluded participants taking beta - blocker medication in a separate analysis .
statistical methods mean values of resting heart rate were calculated from all available measurements ; for the dinamap monitor three readings were used and for the omron monitor two measurements were used .
we used a regression model to evaluate the relationship of covariates to heart rate within each gender and racial group .
variables that were significant predictors of heart rate were included in the race and gender - specific regression model for adjustment .
they included age , age2 , bmi , pack - years , currently drinking alcohol ( yes / no ) , hypertension status and beta - blocker use .
we then calculated the standardized residuals of heart rate for each gender and racial group within each network ( i.e. gennet , genoa and hypergen ) .
a second standardized residual was generated after excluding beta - blocker medication users from the sample and removing the beta - blocker medication use covariate from the regression model .
residuals from the models described above were used in subsequent linkage analysis .
linkage analyses were performed using variance component ( vc ) models as implemented in merlin version 0.10.2 [ 31 ] .
multipoint analysis was performed modeling genetic variance as additive polygenic and quantitative trait locus ( qtl ) .
the linkage analysis was carried out separately for each race within each network for all participants and for individuals not currently taking beta - blocker medication .
p values obtained from merlin 's vc linkage were combined using fisher 's method of combining p values [ 32 ] .
briefly , if n independent tests are made about the same hypothesis , resulting in the p values p1 , p2 ...
pn then sumi = 1n ( - 2ln pi ) is distributed as a chi2 with 2n degrees of freedom .
combined p values where converted to lod scores using the equation p = 1 - phi [ sign ( lod ) ( 2ln ( 10 )| lod |)] , where phi is the cumulative gaussian distribution function [ 33 ] .
in addition , any lod score derived from the above equation that was less than zero was converted to zero .
fisher 's method was adjusted for non - parametric linkage where a lod score of zero was interpreted as a p value of 12ln ( 2 ) =~ . 72 [ 34 ] .
a test for heterogeneity was performed using the program heterogeneity and genome search meta - analysis ( hegesma )[ 35,36 ] .
the genome was equally divided into 95 bins of ~ 30 cm and the maximum lod score was recorded for each bin .
each bin was ranked separately in each network and ethnic group with the highest lod score having the highest rank and heterogeneity was estimated by the q statistic [ 35 ] .
statistical significance for observing low heterogeneity ( p <= 0.05 ) was estimated from a null distribution of the q statistic calculated from 10,000 rank permutations within each study network and ethnic group .
results table 1 shows descriptive statistics for heart rate and the covariates included in the regression model to define the heart rate phenotype for all participants by network , race and gender .
unadjusted mean heart rates are higher among women than men in both ethnic groups in all networks .
furthermore , african - americans had higher resting heart rates than caucasians at 71.6 +/ - 2.7 and 67.9 +/ - 2.7 respectively .
the gennet network had higher heart rate readings than comparable ethnic / gender groups in both genoa and hypergen .
a gender effect for bmi was much greater in african - americans than in caucasians .
caucasian males and females had the same average bmi of 29.4 whereas african american males , on average , had lower bmi then females at 28.4 and 32.6 , respectively .
the prevalence of beta - blocker medication usage was higher in caucasians than in african - americans .
genoa and hypergen had more individuals diagnosed with hypertension than gennet .

in caucasians , the maximal lod score of 2.06 was seen on chromosome 10 at 142.78 cm within the hypergen network .
in african - americans , the maximal lod score was seen in the genoa network , where chromosome 13 produced a lod of 3.07 across a region from 55.31 cm to 63.9 cm. excluding participants taking beta - blocker medication had a minimal impact in lod scores ( average increase of 0.002 ) .
in the hypergen network the multipoint lod score of 2.06 detected for caucasians on chromosome 10 at 142.78 cm increased to 4.62 ( microsatellites at this linkage peak are ata29c03 , gata48g07a and ggaa5d10 ) and the maximal lod score seen in african - americans in genoa network on chromosome 13 decreased from 3.07 to 1.48 after removal of individuals using beta - blocker medication .
in african - americans , the maximal lod score in the sample not taking beta - blocker medication was on chromosome 16 at 43.89 cm in hypergen with a lod of 2.48 , an increase from 1.86 .

figure 2 shows the meta - analysis results from participants not taking beta - blocker medication combining the genome scans of all networks by race and combing all races and networks .
the combined caucasian sample not taking beta - blocker medication showed seven lod scores greater than 1.0 with a maximum of 4.08 on chromosome 10 at 142.8 cm near the microsatellite ata29c03 .
the combined african - american sample not taking beta - blocker medication showed nine lod scores above 1.0 with a maximum of 1.60 on chromosome 11 at 76.13 cm ( gata90d07 ) .
when ethnic groups where combined there were two major peaks seen with a maximal lod score of 3.06 on chromosome 10 at 78.14 cm and a smaller lod score of 1.96 on chromosome 5 between 39.99 and 45.34 cm. figures 2 and 3 show chromosomes 5 and 10 , respectively , presenting the meta - analysis by ethic group and the total combined meta - analysis in individuals not taking beta - blocker medication .
we found significance evidence of low heterogeneity ( p <= 0.05 ) for chromosome 5 between 39.99 and 45.34 cm. figure 1 original genome scans for each network .

also shown is the combined race meta - analysis for all individuals not taking beta - blocker medication ( combined ) discussion resting heart rate is a clinically significant variable that a large number of studies have shown to be associated with cvd , atherosclerosis , cancer , and all - cause mortality [ 1,2,5,6,8,10,11,37 - 39 ] .
individuals with elevated resting heart rate have been shown to have high cholesterol , triglycerides and fasting insulin which are known risk factors for hypertension [ 40 ] .
furthermore , elevated resting heart rate has been associated with increased bmi and blood glucose , dyslipidemia , and high hematocrit [ 37,41 ] .
the pathogenesis of the connection between tachycardia - associated disease and death is not well understood .
however , it has been postulated that tachycardia is a marker of abnormal autonomic control and is caused by shift in sympathovagal balance towards relative sympathetic dominance [ 40 ] .
given the importance of heart rate as an independent predictor of cvd and death , it becomes increasingly important to identify genetic modifiers that affect heart rate .
it has been shown that heart rate lowered by either surgical ( ablation of the sinoatrial node [ 42 ]) or pharmaceutical ( administration of beta - blocker medications [ 43,44 ]) means in cholesterol - fed monkeys slowed the development of coronary atherosclerosis .
therefore the identification of genes influencing heart rate may produce new drug targets that could decrease atherosclerosis and ultimately cvd .
we estimated the heritability of resting heart rate across all networks for all participants to be 32.62 % ( se = 2.53 ) for caucasians and 27.41 % ( se = 2.11 ) for african - americans .
these values are slightly higher than previous estimates of 26 % [ 23 ] and 21 % [ 14 ] but lower than a twin study estimate of 59 % [ 45 ] .
additionally much higher correlation for heart rate among siblings ( 0.23 ) than spouse pairs ( 0.06 ) has been reported [ 14 ] .
this evidence suggests a strong genetic component to heart rate and heart rate variability .
in our genome scan for resting heart rate , we found suggestive evidence for linkage at several loci for both caucasian and african americans , but only one locus in caucasians not taking beta - blockers reached the level of genomewide significance with a lod score of 4.62 ( chromosome 10 , 142.78 cm ) .
combining all races and networks we found suggestive linkage at several loci including overlapping regions of linkage across races in two separate networks , genoa and hypergen , implicating chromosome 5 with lod scores of 1.86 and 1.12 respectively .
the largest meta - analysis peak was seen on chromosome 10 at 142.78 cm and seems to be driven entirely by caucasians with a nominal contribution of the african - american cohort .
the second largest meta - analysis peak was seen on chromosome 5 between 39.99 and 45.34 cm and is driven by two completely separate networks and ethnic groups .
this linkage peak between 39.99 and 45.34 cm overlaps with a linkage peak in a recent genome scan for neonatal atrial fibrillation [ 46 ] .
contrary to previous reports [ 16,23 ] , we saw no evidence for a qtl on chromosome 4q .
finally , while the hypergen study provided strong evidence for linkage on chromosome 10 in caucasians and in the meta - analysis , the locus was only replicated with a 0.75 lod in one other race / network group .
while past studies of this region on chromosome 10 , have reported association for a polymorphism in the beta adrenergic receptor with increased resting heart rate [ 24 ] , the evidence for linkage to this region was driven by a single race / network group in our study .
the major strengths of our analysis include that it was carried out in multiple networks , each with multiple sites across the country , using a large population of caucasian and african americans .
moreover , adjustments for factors known to affect heart rate ( including bmi , smoking status , medication and alcohol use ) were made prior to analysis .
conclusion our finding of linkage in several locations in the genome strongly suggests that heart rate is a polygenic phenotype and additional study of the implicated loci is needed .
notably , the overlapping linkage region ( lod > 1 ) across ethnic groups and study centers on chromosome 5p13 - 14 with low heterogeneity provides strong support for a qtl influencing elevated resting heart rate .

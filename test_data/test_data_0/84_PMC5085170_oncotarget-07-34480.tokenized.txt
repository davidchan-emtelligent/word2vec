p75ntr , a member of tnf receptor family , is the low affinity receptor common to several mature neurotrophins and the high affinity receptor for pro - neurotrophins .
brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) , a member of neurotrophin family has been described to play an important role in development and progression of several cancers , through its binding to a high affinity tyrosine kinase receptor b ( trkb ) and / or p75ntr .
however , the functions of these two receptors in renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) have never been investigated .
an overexpression of p75ntr , pro - bdnf , and to a lesser extent for trkb and sortilin , was detected by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 83 clear cell rcc tumors .
p75ntr , mainly expressed in tumor tissues , was significantly associated with higher fuhrman grade in multivariate analysis .
in two derived - rcc lines , 786 - o and achn cells , we demonstrated that pro - bdnf induced cell survival and migration , through p75ntr as provided by p75ntr rna silencing or blocking anti - p75ntr antibody .
this mechanism is independent of trkb activation as demonstrated by k252a , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for trk neurotrophin receptors .
taken together , these data highlight for the first time an important role for p75ntr in renal cancer and indicate a putative novel target therapy in rcc .
p75ntr pro - bdnf trkb sortilin renal cell carcinoma introduction renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) represents 2 - 3 % of all worldwide cancers .
among the different histological types , the clear cell rcc is the most common subtype .
despite earlier diagnosis and considerable progress in treatment of metastatic rcc with targeted therapy , mortality rate remains high .
limited success of the current therapy could be explained by mechanisms of resistance to anti - angiogenic treatment , suggesting that other survival pathways are involved [ 1 ] .
thereby , recent advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of rcc might provide new therapeutic research pathways [ 2 ] .
several studies have highlighted the emerging biological functions of neurotrophins in different cancers [ 3,4 ] .
however , their expression and role have never been reported in rcc .
therefore , we focused this study on the potential functions of p75ntr , a neurotrophin receptor belonging to tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) receptor family and its ligand pro - bdnf , in clear cell rcc aggressiveness .
neurotrophins ( nts ) are a family of growth factors initially identified in the nervous system [ 6 ] involved in proliferation , differentiation or cell death in several cell types , including malignant cells .
these functions depend on their immature or mature forms and the activation of two types of receptors .
p75ntr , a type 1 transmembrane protein , belonging to the tnf receptor superfamily , is the common receptor for mature nts and their precursors , the pro - nts .
this receptor is a low affinity receptor for mature nts and a high affinity receptor for the pro - nts [ 5 , 6 ] .
the second receptors , neurotrophin tyrosine kinase receptors ( ntrk1 , 2 or 3 ) also named tropomyosin kinase ( trk ) receptors ( trka , b , and c ) , are high affinity receptors for the mature neurotrophins , nerve growth factor ( ngf ) , brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) and neurotrophin - 3 ( nt3 ) , respectively .
several studies point out the involvement of bdnf in tumor pathogenesis through trkb in different cancers [ 3 ] such as colon [ 7 , 8 ] , lung [ 9 - 11 ] , breast [ 12 ] neuroblastoma [ 13 , 14 ] , ovary [ 15 ] prostate [ 16 ] , head and neck [ 17 ] , as well as lymphoid malignant b cells and myeloma [ 18 - 20 ] .
trkb activation induces phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine residues and signaling pathways through ras / mapk ( mitogen - activated protein kinase ) , pi3k / akt ( phosphatidylinositol - 3 kinase ) and plc - gamma ( phospholipase c - gamma ) activations .
like other nts , bdnf is synthetized in a precursor form ( pro - bdnf ) , which is cleaved to form its mature form by proteolytic cleavage [ 6 ] through metalloproteinases [ 21 ] .
both pro - bdnf and bdnf are secreted and display opposite effects on neural cell proliferation and apoptosis [ 22 ] as well as in some malignant cells [ 7 , 18 ] .
the anti - apoptotic function of bdnf is mediated by interactions with the high - affinity receptor trkb .
in contrast , p75ntr binds pro - bdnf , and its ability to induce apoptosis requires its interaction with sortilin ( a vps10p - d , vacuolar protein - sorting domain protein , the third receptor for neurotensin [ 23 ]) its co - receptor to form a high - affinity dimeric receptor .
p75ntr has not intrinsic catalytic activity and its signaling depends on the recruitment of adaptor proteins [ 24 , 25 ] .
in malignant cells , the role of p75ntr is less well established than for trkb .
indeed , its overexpression is associated to aggressiveness in human glioblastoma [ 26 , 27 ] , melanoma [ 28 , 29 ] and breast cancer [ 12 ] .
in contrast , p75ntr displays a suppressor effect on cell proliferation and invasion in bladder [ 30 ] , hepatocellular [ 31 ] or gastric [ 32 ] carcinomas .
these opposite roles are related to dual functions of p75ntr in tumor cells , inducing either apoptosis in colorectal and in rat c6 glioma cell lines [ 7 , 27 ] or cell activation in human breast , glioblastoma and melanoma cancer cells , depending on the cell type and the pro - or mature neurotrophin binding [ 26 , 28 , 33 ] .
although the involvement of bdnf and trkb remains unknown in renal carcinoma , one study has reported that sera from non - responder patients to sunitinib ( a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti - angiogenic activity ) contained high levels of bdnf [ 34 ] .
however , bdnf and receptor expressions in rcc tumors were not described [ 34 ] .
therefore , the goal of the present study was to determine the expressions of bdnf and precursor ( pro - bdnf ) and its receptors in rcc , as well as their biological functions by using rcc - derived cell lines .
we report herein that pro - bdnf and p75ntr are overexpressed in tumors from rcc patients .
only p75ntr correlates with higher fuhrman grade and worse prognosis in a cohort of 83 clear cell rcc patients .
moreover , p75ntr function was determined in renal cell lines ( achn and 786 - o ) , showing a clear implication of this receptor in rcc cell survival and migration through pro - bdnf binding .
results pro - bdnf and p75ntr expressions are enhanced in renal cell carcinoma tumors clear cell rcc tumor tissues from 83 patients ( table 1 ) who underwent nephrectomy were processed by immunohistochemistry in tissue micro array ( tma ) for pro - bdnf / bdnf ( both mature and immature forms recognized by a common antibody ) , pro - bdnf alone , as well as p75ntr , trkb receptor or sortilin .
comparative analyses were performed between normal adjacent tissue and tumor areas by immunohistochemistry for each patient .
various intensity of immunostaining was evaluated by double blind pathologist / assay and also by quantification by image j software and refereed to the aggressiveness of renal carcinoma ( fuhrman grade ) .
in the absence of available specific antibody to mature bdnf , we performed two immunostaining assays with either a specific anti - pro - bdnf antibody or with an antibody directed against both immature and mature forms of bdnf .
immunostaining assays for pro - bdnf is comparable to results obtained for both mature and immature bdnf indicating that pro - bdnf was highly expressed in most tumor samples as in normal tissues ( figure 1a : a , b and figure 1b ) .
whereas pro - bdnf / bdnf , trkb and sortilin were expressed in normal tissues , mainly in tubules ( figure 1a : a , c , e , i ) , their expressions were also detected in tumor areas ( see figure 1a ) .
immunostaining was located in both cytoplasm and membrane for pro - bdnf / whole bdnf ( figure 1a : b and d ) , mainly in cytoplasm for trkb ( figure 1a : f ) and at the membrane for sortilin ( figure 1a : j ). by contrast , p75ntr expression was rarely detected in normal tissues , with a weakly expression in some areas ( figure 1a : g ) whereas different levels of expression were detected in some tumor samples ( figure 1a : h ) , with cytoplasmic and reinforced membranous staining in some tumor areas .
the score of immunostaining intensity , evaluated by image j in the different tumor samples was also indicated for each labelled protein ( figure 1b , 1c , 1e and 1f ) as well as double - positive expression for p75ntr and pro - bdnf ( figure 1d ) .
only p75ntr immunostaining intensity was significantly correlated with symptoms ( p = 0.013 ) , uiss ( ucla integrated staging system ) prognostic score ( p = 0.040 ) , fuhrman grade ( p = 0.001 ) ( table 2 ) .
multiple linear regression analysis confirmed that changes in p75ntr staining scores were only significantly associated with fuhrman grade ( beta =+ 0.66 , p = 0.0011 ) , whereas age ( p = 0.17 ) , gender ( p = 0.98 ) , symptoms ( p = 0.78 ) , ecog ( p = 0.26 ) , t stage ( p = 0.62 ) , n stage ( p = 0.53 ) , m stage ( p = 0.65 ) , pathological stage ( p = 0.76 ) , uiss prognostic groups ( p = 0.31 ) , progression ( p = 0.84 ) , dead ( p = 0.51 ) or staining scores of pro - bdnf ( p = 0.59 ) , trkb ( p = 0.80 ) and sortilin ( p = 0.17 ) were not found to be independently associated with p75ntr scores .

to this end , we randomly choose 30 frozen tissues from clear cell rcc tumors .
we considered 3 groups according to the ratio between tumor tissues and their normal counterparts for each tumor analysis .
lower than 1 ( no overexpression ) , 1 - 3 fold increase ( low overexpression ) whereas 3 fold or more increase was considered as high overexpression .
real time pcr assay showed that 16 / 30 ( 53.3 %) of the tumors expressed a high level of pro - bdnf transcripts ( figure 2a ) .
in addition , the transcripts for p75ntr were highly overexpressed in 19 / 30 ( 63.3 %) ( figure 2b ) .
in contrast , those for trkb ( both full - length and truncated forms ) were only overexpressed in 4 / 30 ( 13.3 %) patients ( figure 2c ) .
interestingly , the pair pro - bdnf / p75ntr appeared overexpressed in more of 50 % of analyzed ( 19 of 30 samples ) .
figure 2 pro - bdnf , p75ntr and trkb expressions in clear cell rcc tumors a. qrt - pcr analyses of total rna from 30 tumors and normal kidney tissue patients , expressed in relative mrna levels from tumor - derived samples referred to their normal counterpart tissue in each case for pro - bdnf , b .
p75ntr , c. trkb ( whole forms ) , hprt was used as housekeeping control .
three groups were defined according to the mrna ratio between tumor and normal tissues : lower than 1 ( no overexpression ) , 1 - 3 fold increase ( low overexpression ) and >= 3 fold increase ( high overexpression ). d. western blot performed to confirm p75ntr , trkb , sortilin and pro - bdnf protein expressions in tumors ( t ) and normal counterpart of each tumor sample ( c ) .
one tumor sample for each tma p75ntr immunostaining score ( 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 ) was selected to confirm protein levels according to expression levels .
to confirm p75ntr protein expression , according to tma score , we quantified p75ntr levels in immunoblot of protein lysates by choosing a single case per group , in comparison with their normal counterpart tissue ( figure 2d ) .
results showed a low p75ntr expression in control tissues as well as in score 1 and higher levels in score 2 and 3 , as expected by immunostaining analyses. by contrast , western blot confirmed a high basal expression of sortilin , pro - bdnf and trkb 95 ( truncated form ) in normal and tumor tissues , in agreement with our observation of figure 1a .
human renal carcinoma 786 - o and achn cells over - express pro - bdnf , p75ntr and sortilin considering our previous results and to study the functions of pro - bdnf , p75ntr and trkb , in clear cell rcc , two human cell lines derived from rcc were used , a primary renal cell carcinoma ( 786 - o ) [ 35 ] and a metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( achn ) [ 36 ] .
both cell lines expressed pro - bdnf , p75ntr , trkb and sortilin at mrna ( figure 3a ) and protein levels ( figure 3b ) with some differences depending on culture conditions including or not fbs in order to mimic stress conditions .
higher levels of pro - bdnf transcripts were detected in achn cell line than in 786 - o. besides , in achn cells an increase of pro - bdnf levels was detected after 24 hours of serum starvation at mrna ( p = 0.0012 ) and protein levels ( figure 3b ) .
p75ntr mrna increased ( p = 0.001 ) in starving conditions in 786 - o cell line but not in achn cells , whereas p75ntr protein levels increased in both serum - free cell lines .
only the truncated form ( 95 kda ) of trkb was detected in both cell lines at mrna and protein levels , without varying expression levels whatever culture conditions ( figure 3a ) .
finally , only in 786 - o cell line , mrna levels for sortilin increased in starving conditions ( p = 0.0001 ) while a slight increase of sortilin was detected at protein level for both cell lines ( figure 3b ) .

shsy5y neuroblastoma cell line was used as positive control .
values indicate the ratio of relative densitometric values of trkb - 95 , sortilin , p75ntr or pro - bdnf compared to beta - actin as loading control , normalized to an arbitrary value of 1 obtained in standard cultures containing fbs. c. relative mrna levels for trkb - 145 ( full - length ) and trkb - 95 ( truncated form ) for d562 , 786 - o and achn cell lines compared to colorectal - derived cell line sw620 .
therefore , levels of pro - bdnf and p75ntr increased in both cell lines in starved conditions , whereas low amounts of mature bdnf were detected ( data not shown ) and trkb full - length remained almost undetectable ( figure 3b ) .
to verify this observation , we perform a comparative qrt - pcr to determine trkb - 145 and trkb - 95 mrna levels in different cell lines known to express both forms of trkb , as observed in our laboratory ( figure 3c ) .
as expected , the colorectal - derived cell line sw480 showed higher levels of trkb expression ( both full - length and truncated isoforms ) ( figure 3c ) [ 7 ] .
the other cell line , d562 ( head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell line ) had lower levels ( figure 3c ) .
interestingly 786 - o and achn cells exhibited the lowest levels for truncated trkb - 95 with undetectable mrna levels for trkb full - length , as observed at protein level .
taken together , these data suggested that p75ntr and pro - bdnf are expressed in our experimental model of renal carcinoma - derived cell lines .
pro - bdnf increased cell viability and migration in renal cancer cell lines therefore , considering all the previous evidences , we have focused the study on the relationship between pro - bdnf / p75ntr and its possible pro - survival role in renal cell carcinoma .
next , the function of pro - bdnf as prosurvival factor through p75ntr was studied in renal carcinoma cell lines .
the role of pro - bdnf on cellular viability was evaluated in both cell lines by mtt assay .
the viability of both cell lines was increased in the presence of 20 ng / ml of pro - bdnf in serum - free medium ( figure 4a ) .
figure 4 pro - bdnf increases both cell viability and migration , in achn and 786 - o renal cell lines a. in serum deprivation conditions pro - bdnf ( 20 ng / ml ) was added and cell viability was measured at indicated times by mtt assay for achn ( left panel ) and 786 - o ( right panel ) cell lines. b. wound healing assay was performed in achn or 786 - o cell lines .
pro - bdnf ( 20 ng / ml ) was added in serum deprivation conditions and migration was evaluated at 24 hours. c. histograms show the area quantification ( expressed in percentage ) at 24 hours of three independent experiments performed in same conditions for achn and 786 - 0 cells .
(** p < 0.01 ) .
considering that apoptosis induced by pro - bdnf has been previously described in neurons and c6 glioma cells [ 21 , 27 ] , we have evaluated apoptosis in 786 - o and achn cells in the presence of pro - bdnf ( supplementary figure s1a ) .
as expected and in contrast to previous reports , pro - bdnf did not induce significant apoptosis in 786 - o or achn cells .
consistent with these data , cell viability was increased in presence of pro - bdnf alone or combined with gm6001 , a broad matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) inhibitor , used for inhibiting pro - bdnf cleavage .
these results confirmed the prosurvival role of pro - bdnf in both cell lines ( supplementary figure s1b ) .
interestingly , we have also detected a prosurvival effect for mature bdnf , in both cell lines .
( supplementary figure s1b ) .
then , we search for pro - bdnf function in cell migration by a wound healing assay performed in achn and 786 - o cells .
after 24 hours , a significant migratory response of achn ( p = 0.002 ) and 786 - o ( p = 0.0014 ) cells was observed in presence of pro - bdnf in comparison with control conditions ( figure 4b and 4c ) .
similar results were obtained in combination with mmp inhibitor , supporting the independent role of pro - bdnf ( supplementary figure s2a ) .
to validate that results obtained on wound healing assays are not due to cell proliferation , the same experiments were done in presence of cytarabine , ( 100mum ) - a mitotic inhibitor - ( supplementary figure s2b and s2c ) .
this experiment supports the dual role of pro - bdnf on cell viability and migration in rcc .
pro - bdnf promotes cell survival and migration through p75ntr in renal carcinoma cell lines in order to define the link between p75ntr and the increase of cell viability and migration , we performed sirna to suppress p75ntr expression .
an effective p75ntr knockdown was controlled at protein and rna levels , 48 hours after transfection in comparison with control sirna - transfected cells ( figure 5a ) .
then , wound healing assay was performed with control sirna and p75ntr - inactivated achn cells ( figure 5b ) .
achn cell migration was clearly decreased by p75ntr silencing in presence of pro - bdnf ( 20 ng / ml ) in comparison with control sirna cells ( p = 0.0026 ) ( figure 5b and 5c ) .
cell viability was also significantly decreased in silencing - p75ntr cells compared to control sirna in absence of pro - bdnf ( p = 0.035 ) ( figure 5d ) .
similar results were observed in presence of pro - bdnf ( p = 0.0066 ) ( figure 5d ) .
to confirm that p75ntr receptor is essential for achn cell migration , same approach was followed by using a specific blocking antibody directed against p75ntr receptor .
as expected , at 36 h anti - p75ntr antibody ( 15 ng / ml ) combined with pro - bdnf , decreased the achn cell migration , compared to cells treated with pro - bdnf alone ( p = 0.0062 ) ( figure 5e and 5f ) .
figure 5 p75ntr rna silencing or blocking anti - p75ntr antibody inhibits achn cell migration a. achn cells were transfected with control sirna or p75ntr sirna , mrna and protein levels were assessed 48 hours after transfection. b. a wound healing assay was performed in serum deprivation conditions for achn _ sic or achn _ sip75ntr in absence or presence of pro - bdnf ( 20 ng / ml ) and migration was evaluated at indicated times. c. histogram show the results of 3 independent experiments for wound healing assay under the same experimental conditions that in a. d. viability was evaluated by mtt assay and performed for both , achn _ sic and achn _ sip75ntr at indicated times points ( in serum deprivation conditions in presence or absence of pro - bdnf as in b ) .
results are presented as means +/ - sem of three independent experiments. e. and f. wound healing assay was performed in the presence of a specific blocking antibody for p75ntr .
histograms summarize the results of three independent experiments at 36 hours for achn cell line .
these results strongly suggest the important role for pro - bdnf / p75ntr interaction in the migration of renal carcinoma cells .
likewise , same results were obtained with the 786 - o cells .
indeed , p75ntr inactivation by sirna ( figure 6a ) compared to control sirna , significantly diminished cell migration in presence of pro - bdnf at 24h ( p = 0.0053 vs control sirna cells ) ( figure 6b ) , as well as cell viability ( p = 0.031 at 48 h and p = 0.001 at 72h ) ( figure 6c ) .
as expected , migration of 786 - o cells , in presence of pro - bdnf , was inhibited by p75ntr blocking antibody ( p = 0.048 vs cells treated with pro - bdnf alone ) ( figure 6d ) .
since trks family is targeted by k252a [ 37 ] and that its combination with pro - bdnf did not modify cell migration , this result fully supports the role of p75ntr on migration independently of trks receptors ( figure 6e ) .
in sum , we demonstrate that p75ntr inactivation affects both cell viability and migration induced by pro - bdnf in achn and 786 - o cells , supporting the general feature of our observation .

histogram shows quantification of three independent experiments .
pro - bdnf activates pro - survival signaling pathways mapk and akt activations in response to bdnf have already been reported [ 38 ] , therefore we analyze mapks activation ( erk1 / 2 ) and akt pathways in response to pro - bdnf ( 20 ng / ml ) in 768 - 0 cells ( figure 7a ) alone or in presence of gm6001 mmp inhibitor ( 20 ng / ml ) ( figure 7b and supplementary figure s3b ) .
a clear activation of both , akt and erk1 / 2 pathways was detected after pro - bdnf addition to culture media .
conversely , in presence of mature bdnf , no activation of erk1 / 2 pathway was detected and a low activation of akt pathway was detected in presence of bdnf , albeit not comparable to those induced by pro - bdnf ( supplementary figure s3a ) .
however , no activation of p38mapk was detected , whatever experimental conditions , supporting the specificity of our observations .
figure 7 study of prosurvival signaling pathways and immunoprecipitated receptors complex akt , erk1 / 2 and p38mapk signaling pathways were analyzed in 786 - o cell line cultured in starving conditions .
response to pro - bdnf alone ( 20 ng / ml ) a. or with gm6001 ( 20 mum ) b. was evaluated at indicated time points. c. immunoprecipitation was performed for trkb or sortilin in presence or absence or fbs or pro - bdnf ( 20 ng / ml ) as indicated in figure .
5 % ( v / v ) of whole cell lysate ( wcl ) was used as a control by western blotting in this experiment. d. 786 - o cell line was transfected with control ( sirna _ c ) or sortilin sirna ( sirna _ sort1 ) .
after 24 hours starving 786 - o _ sic and 786 - o _ sisortilin cells were treated for one hour with pro - bdnf ( 20 ng / ml ) before akt and erk activation studies .
western blots are representative of three independent experiments .
given that p75ntr can interact with co - receptors , sortilin [ 39 ] and trkb [ 40 ] , both detected in rcc cells , co - immunoprecipitations were carried out in 786 - o cells ( figure 7c ) .
using anti - sortilin antibody , immunoprecipitated proteins contained high levels of p75ntr associated with truncated trkb - 95 , without difference according to protein levels between culture conditions .
interestingly , the interaction of p75ntr with trkb was also detected by immunoprecipitation with anti - trkb antibody in the same conditions .
indeed , an immunoprecipitated protein complex containing also high levels of p75ntr associated with trkb - 95 was detected , while sortilin was weakly detected in the complex ; whatever experimental conditions ( figure 7c ) .
consequently , to define the role of sortilin in p75ntr activation through pro - bdnf , we have performed a sirna sortilin to evaluate akt and erk activation in presence of pro - bdnf .
indeed , we observed that akt and erk activations were decreased but not abolished in sirna sortilin cells compared to sirna control cells ( figure 7d ) .
although the precise elucidation of trkb - 95 and sortilin roles in the p75ntr functions remains unknown , our data suggest an interaction between p75ntr , sortilin and truncated trkb 95 that could promote the p75ntr ligand binding .
discussion bdnf and its two main receptors , trkb and p75ntr have been considered as important factors in oncogenesis .
although the overexpression of trkb , p75ntr and bdnf have been previously reported in several cancers as poor prognostic factors and to participate to tumor aggressiveness [ 7 , 12 , 18 , 19 ] , their implication in renal cell carcinoma has not been previously reported .
this study highlights the function of p75ntr and pro - bdnf in renal cell carcinoma .
our findings demonstrate that p75ntr and pro - bdnf are overexpressed in rcc patients .
unlike trkb and sortilin , expressed in normal tissues , p75ntr was only rarely detected in focal areas of normal counterpart tissues .
this finding is concordant with previous studies demonstrating that p75ntr expression is sparse and only located in interstitial space and mesenchymal cells in normal adult kidney [ 41 , 42 ] .
only p75ntr expression in rcc tumors was associated with high fuhrman grade and correlated to worse prognosis .
at cellular levels , we demonstrate that activation of p75ntr by pro - bdnf plays a major role in cell survival and migration of rcc cell lines , as assessed by transcriptomic and immunological approaches ( p75ntr sirna and blocking anti - p75ntr antibody ) , through akt and erk pathways .
this activation is independent of trkb , as demonstrated by the absence of k252a inhibitory effect on akt and erk phosphorylation in presence of pro - bdnf .
these findings supported the key function of p75ntr in the aggressiveness of rcc .
it was reported that p75ntr exhibits dual functions depending on the presence of a co - receptor and its activation by immature or mature neurotrophins .
opposite effects were initially described in neurons , inducing either apoptosis or cell survival depending on its co - receptor and the release of immature or mature neurotrophins [ 43 ] .
in neurons , pro - neurotrophins induce apoptosis depending on their binding to p75ntr and its co - receptor sortilin [ 22 , 39 ] , whereas p75ntr induces cell survival through its association to trk receptors , enhancing the binding of mature neurotrophins [ 43 ] .
this dual function of p75ntr is also reported in some cancer cells .
indeed , p75ntr suppressed cell proliferation and invasion [ 30 - 32 ] or was associated with cell proliferation and cancer aggressiveness [ 12 , 27 , 29 , 44 ] .
concerning trkb , the other receptor for bdnf , whereas its expression was detected in rcc patients tumors , only the truncated form trkb - 95 , known to be deleted for its tyrosine kinase domain [ 45 ] was observed in both rcc cell lines , as well as in the proteins extracted from some rcc tumor samples .
these results are consistent with a previous study showing that only the truncated form of trkb is largely expressed in normal human kidney whereas its full - length trkb - 145 is undetectable [ 46 ] .
such findings were reported in breast cancer , demonstrating that the association of truncated form of trkb with p75ntr is essential for ligand binding and p75ntr activation and is not inhibited by k252a [ 12 ] , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of trks [ 37 ] .
hence , we have verified that k252a did not suppress cell survival and migration induced by pro - bdnf .
the function of p75ntr in cancer aggressiveness was already described in some other cancers .
indeed , high expressions of both pro - bdnf and p75ntr are observed in high grade gliomas with invasive properties [ 27 ] .
interestingly , these invasive functions are also dependent of p75ntr and mature neurotrophin binding [ 26 ] .
similar function of p75ntr through mature neurotrophin activation was observed in melanoma independently of trka [ 47 ] .
in a similar way , we have found that mature bdnf could also be implicated in cell survival , independently of pro - bdnf , as shown in experiments combining mmp inhibitor .
furthermore , full - length trkb ( 145 kda , containing a tyrosine kinase motif ) the receptor for mature bdnf , was not detected at protein and mrna levels , by contrast to its truncated 95 kda isoform .
these data supported previous studies demonstrating that the association of truncated trkb to p75ntr enhances the responsiveness to low neurotrophin concentrations [ 12 , 40 ] .
to search for a potential p75ntr co - receptor , immunoprecipitations were performed on rcc cells with its putative co - receptor , trkb or sortilin .
we detected that p75ntr is mainly immunoprecipitated with trkb - 95 and to a lesser with sortilin whatever culture conditions ( with or without fbs as well as in presence or absence of pro - bdnf ) .
the sortilin silencing decreased but not abolished akt and erk activation in presence of pro - bdnf , suggesting that sortilin facilitates p75ntr function .
therefore , p75ntr activation could be mediated through the complex formed by p75ntr , sortilin and trkb - 95 .
the presence of sortilin in the trkb / p75ntr complex in rcc cells as described herein was not previously reported in other type of tumor .
its function is not related to the induction of apoptosis as deduced from experiments in the presence of pro - bdnf , inducing cell survival and migration .
we have previously described another function of sortilin , as a crucial protein to form a complex with two receptors containing a tyrosine kinase domain , trkb and egfr , in lung cancer [ 48 ] .
sortilin complexed with trka , another tyrosine kinase receptor for ngf , was also identified in breast cancer , promoting cell invasion through pro - ngf binding to this complex [ 49 ] .
similar results were reported in melanoma , expressing trks , p75ntr and sortilin , wherein cell migration and invasion induced by pro - ngf were depending on p75ntr [ 50 ] .
however , sortilin " per se " has been recently described to inhibit cell adhesion in colorectal cancer cell lines [ 51 ] and to activate breast cancer cell migration and invasiveness [ 52 ] .
these mechanisms depend on focal adhesion kinase ( fak ) and src activations , [ 52 , 53 ] without any change in apoptotic or proliferative cancer cell functions [ 52 ] .
however , in rcc cells , our results suggest that the role of sortilin is not crucial for p75ntr function through pro - bdnf activation as assessed by the decrease but not suppression of akt / erk activation .
therefore , in light of our findings , we postulate that sortilin could associate with p75ntr and truncated trkb - 95 .
in this complex , p75ntr could be activated by both immature and mature forms of bdnf , while trkb - 95 could enhance the ligand binding to p75ntr as previously described [ 12 , 40 ] .
in conclusion , we report herein that p75ntr expression is correlated with poor prognosis and tumor progression in rcc .
the involvement of pro - bdnf and p75ntr in cell survival and migration of rcc cells points out this mechanism supported by p75ntr .
our study highlights new mechanisms of aggressiveness in rcc depending on p75ntr and also point to p75ntr as a novel putative target for developing future rcc therapy .

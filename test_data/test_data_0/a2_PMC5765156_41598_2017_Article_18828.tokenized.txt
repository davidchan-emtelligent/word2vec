accumulation of somatic mutations in mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) has been proposed to be responsible for human aging and age - associated mitochondrial respiration defects .
however , our previous findings suggested an alternative hypothesis of human aging - - that epigenetic changes but not mutations regulate age - associated mitochondrial respiration defects , and that epigenetic downregulation of nuclear - coded genes responsible for mitochondrial translation [ e.g. , glycine c - acetyltransferase ( gcat ) , serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 ( shmt2 )] is related to age - associated respiration defects .
to examine our hypothesis , here we generated mice deficient in gcat or shmt2 and investigated whether they have respiration defects and premature aging phenotypes .
gcat - deficient mice showed no macroscopic abnormalities including premature aging phenotypes for up to 9 months after birth .
in contrast , shmt2 - deficient mice showed embryonic lethality after 13.5 days post coitum ( dpc ) , and fibroblasts obtained from 12.5 - dpc shmt2 - deficient embryos had respiration defects and retardation of cell growth .
because shmt2 substantially controls production of n - formylmethionine - trna ( fmet - trna ) in mitochondria , its suppression would reduce mitochondrial translation , resulting in expression of the respiration defects in fibroblasts from shmt2 - deficient embryos .
these findings support our hypothesis that age - associated respiration defects in fibroblasts of elderly humans are caused not by mtdna mutations but by epigenetic regulation of nuclear genes including shmt2 .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 introduction because mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species endogenously and preferentially accumulate exogenous chemical carcinogens , mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) is exposed to these mutagens , resulting in accumulation of somatic mutations with age1 - 5 .
some of these somatic mutations in human mtdna are pathogenic , because the same mutations are found in patients with mitochondrial diseases caused by mitochondrial respiration defects .
therefore , the mitochondrial theory of aging1 - 5 proposes that accumulation of somatic mutations in mtdna is responsible for human aging and age - associated mitochondrial respiration defects .
however , it is also possible that abnormalities in nuclear dna but not in mtdna induce age - associated mitochondrial respiration defects , because both nuclear dna and mtdna encode proteins required for mitochondrial respiratory function1 .
to determine which genome , nuclear or mitochondrial , is responsible for the respiration defects in the fibroblasts of elderly humans , we previously carried out intercellular transfer of mtdna6 or nuclear dna7 by using mtdna - less hela cells8 ; the results led us to propose that nuclear recessive mutations induce the age - associated respiration defects .
in contrast , the mitochondrial theory of aging has been supported by studies of mtdna mutator mice9,10 , which were generated by introducing a proofreading - deficient mtdna polymerase gene .
these mice showed accelerated accumulation of somatic mutations in mtdna , resulting in accelerated expression of respiration defects and premature aging phenotypes9,10 .
therefore , it has been controversial whether human aging and age - associated respiration defects are controlled by the accumulation of somatic mutations in mtdna9,10 or by nuclear recessive mutations7 .
more recently , epigenetic regulation of cellular senescence has been proposed in human fibroblasts11 .
our recent study12 addressed these issues by deep sequencing analysis of mtdna and showed that mtdna in fibroblasts from elderly humans does not accumulate somatic mutations .
moreover , reprogramming of these fibroblasts by generating induced pluripotent stem cells ( ipscs ) restores normal respiratory function12 .
this led us to hypothesise that age - associated respiration defects are controlled not by mutations in either nuclear or mtdna , but by epigenetic regulation of nuclear genes .
our microarray screening results suggest that epigenetic downregulation of the nuclear genes glycine c - acetyltransferase ( gcat ) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 ( shmt2 ) is involved in age - associated respiration defects of the fibroblasts of elderly humans12 .
because the products of both genes are localized in mitochondria and regulate glycine production in mitochondria13,14 , their downregulation would induce defects in mitochondrial translation and respiratory function , resulting in the age - associated respiration defects found in the fibroblasts of elderly humans6,7 .
to examine this possibility , we generated mice deficient in gcat or shmt2 , and investigated whether these mice would have mitochondrial respiration defects and premature aging phenotypes .
results generation of mice deficient in the gcat or shmt2 genes we generated knockout mouse strains deficient in the gcat gene or the shmt2 gene by using the crispr / cas9 system .
target sequences were designed according to the mouse gcat and shmt2 sequences ( supplementary fig. s1 ) .
cas9 mrna and single - guide rnas ( sgrnas ) were synthesized as reported previously15 , and were microinjected into fertilized eggs ( pronuclear stage ) from c57bl / 6j ( hereafter referred to as b6j ) mice .
the microinjected eggs were transferred to the oviducts of pseudo - pregnant females .
in the case of gcat knockout mice , 41 of 70 mice were mutation - positive in the surveyor assay ( see methods ) .
we analysed the sequence around the target region in the mice with mutations and selected one male mouse with an insertion and a deletion that would disrupt gcat gene function ( supplementary fig. s1 ) ; we used this mouse as a founder for further breeding to obtain heterozygous ( gcat m /+) females and males. by mating heterozygous females with heterozygous males , we obtained 34 pups .
genotyping showed that 11 pups had no mutation , 19 were heterozygous , and 4 were homozygous ( gcat m / m ) ( fig. 1a ) .
we then obtained offspring ( gcat +/+ , m /+ , m / m ) by in vitro fertilization using heterozygous females and a heterozygous male .

( a ) mutations in gcat .
pcr products of 266 bp and 234 bp correspond to gcat without mutations (+/+) and with mutations ( m / m ; see supplementary fig. s1 for sequences ) , respectively .
the presence of both fragments indicates heterozygosity ( m /+) .
arrowhead shows an additional fragment that may represent heteroduplex molecules .
( b ) mutation in shmt2 .
because an xcmi site was eliminated by an insertion of t ( supplementary fig. s1 ) , xcmi digestion of pcr products without the mutation produces two fragments ( 318 bp and 280 bp ) , whereas digestion of pcr products with the t insertion produces a single fragment ( 599 bp including the t insertion ) .
the presence of all three fragments indicates heterozygosity ( m /+) .
no mice with homozygous mutations ( m / m ) were found , indicating their embryonic lethality .
in the case of shmt2 knockout mice , 20 of 25 mice were mutation - positive in the surveyor assay .
we selected one female mouse with a single - nucleotide insertion ( t ) resulting in a frame shift that would disrupt shmt2 gene function ( supplementary fig. s1 ) and used this mouse as a founder for further breeding to obtain heterozygous ( shmt2 m /+) females and males. by mating heterozygous females with heterozygous males , we obtained 45 pups .
genotyping by xcm i digestion of the pcr products showed that 14 mice had no mutation and 31 were heterozygous , but no mice had a homozygous mutation ( fig. 1b ) , indicating the lethality of embryos with a homozygous mutation in shmt2 ( shmt2 m / m ) .
characterization of mice deficient in the gcat gene because the gcat m / m mice did not show embryonic lethality , we performed western blot analysis to confirm the suppression of the gcat gene in these mice .
the gcat protein was not detectable in livers of 5 - month - old gcat m / m mice , but was detectable in wild - type (+/+) or heterozygous ( m /+) mice ( fig. 2 ) .
these observations confirm complete absence of the gcat protein in gcat m / m mice .

( b ) quantification of western blot data .
however , no growth retardation or obvious macroscopic abnormalities including premature aging phenotypes , such as hair greying , alopecia , or kyphosis , were observed in gcat m / m mice for at least 9 months after birth , even though they did not have the gcat protein .
mice with a heterozygous mutation in the shmt2 gene ( shmt2 m /+ mice ) also showed no growth retardation or no obvious macroscopic abnormalities for at least 9 months after birth .
further investigations would be required to determine whether these mice have any premature aging phenotypes or shorter lifespan than those of mice without the mutations .
characterization of embryos deficient in the shmt2 gene the absence of shmt2 m / m mice among the offspring ( fig. 1b ) suggested their embryonic lethality .
to investigate the embryonic lethality , we used 12.5 - dpc ( days post coitum ) and 13.5 - dpc f1 embryos obtained by mating heterozygous females with heterozygous males .
we found no macroscopic abnormalities in any of the 12.5 - dpc embryos , but detected abnormalities such as small size and anaemia in three of the ten 13.5 - dpc embryos ( fig. 3a ) , indicating that the lethality occurs after13.5 dpc .

then , we genotyped the embryos by xcm i digestion of pcr products. of the ten 13.5 - dpc embryos , one had no mutation , six were heterozygous , and three had homozygous mutations ( fig. 3b ) ; the three embryos with homozygous mutations were the same as those showing macroscopic abnormalities .
western blot analysis ( fig. 3c ) showed that the amounts of shmt2 protein in embryos without the mutation were about twice those in heterozygous embryos .
in embryos with homozygous mutations , low amounts of the shmt2 protein were detectable ( fig. 3c ) , probably due to contaminating maternal cells , such as placenta or blood cells .
examination of gcat and shmt2 expression during embryonic stages a question that arises from the absence of embryonic lethality in gcat m / m mice ( fig. 1a ) is whether the expression of the gcat gene is not required at any embryonic stage .
to answer this question , we examined the levels of the gcat and shmt2 proteins in the placenta ( foetal side ) , brain , and liver from 11.5 - , 12.5 - and 13.5 - dpc embryos without mutations by western blot analysis .
both proteins were present in all three tissues at all embryonic stages examined ; their levels decreased slightly but significantly after 11.5 dpc , except that the level of shmt2 in the liver did not change significantly ( fig. 4 ) .
therefore , the absence of embryonic lethality in gcat m / m mice cannot be explained by the absence of gcat expression during embryogenesis .

data are means +/ - s.e.m .
* p < 0.05 , anova followed by tukey 's multiple comparison test .
isolation and characterization of mouse embryonic fibroblast lines from the embryos of shmt2 m / m mice to investigate the cause of embryonic lethality of shmt2 m / m mice , we obtained two pregnant mice by mating heterozygous mice , and isolated a mouse embryonic fibroblast ( mef ) line from each of the 12.5 - dpc embryos .
genotyping showed that three lines had no mutation ( shmt2 +/+ mef ) , five were heterozygous , and eight had homozygous mutations ( shmt2 m / m mef ) .
we used three shmt2 +/+ mef lines and three shmt2 m / m mef lines for further investigation ( fig. 5a ) .
the absence of the shmt2 protein in the shmt2 m / m mef lines was confirmed by western blot analysis ( fig. 5b ) .
given that mef lines do not contain maternal cells , the presence of low amounts of shmt2 in 12.5 - dpc shmt2 m / m embryos ( fig. 3c ) was likely due to contamination with maternal cells .

experiments were performed in triplicate .

* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , student 's t - test .
then , we examined whether the absence of shmt2 results in mitochondrial respiration defects by using shmt2 +/+ mefs and shmt2 m / m mefs .
first , we performed biochemical analysis of respiratory function , and found the reduced activities of mitochondrial respiratory complexes in shmt2 m / m mefs in comparison with shmt2 +/+ mefs ( fig. 5c ) .
next , we used western blot analysis to compare the amounts of nuclear - and mtdna - coded subunits of respiratory complexes between shmt2 +/+ mefs and shmt2 m / m mefs , and found preferential decrease of mtdna - coded subunits in shmt2 m / m mefs ( fig. 5d ) .
probably , the absence of shmt2 ( fig. 5b ) induced significant respiration defects ( fig. 5c ) as a consequence of the reduction of one - carbon metabolism to produce glycine and n - formylmethionine - trna ( fmet - trna ) 13,14,16 , both of which are required for the mitochondrial translation that produces mtdna - coded subunits of respiratory complexes .
finally , we compared the doubling times between shmt2 +/+ mefs and shmt2 m / m mefs , and found significant growth retardation in shmt2 m / m mefs ( fig. 5e ) .
therefore , the embryonic lethality observed in shmt2 m / m mice is likely due to both the respiration defects and growth retardation caused by the shmt2 deficiency .
isolation and characterization of mef lines from the embryos of gcat m / m mice next , we generated mef lines from gcat m / m embryos , and examined their respiratory function and doubling times to investigate why gcat m / m embryos are not embryonic lethal .
we obtained two pregnant mice by mating heterozygous mice , and isolated a mef line from each of the 12.5 - dpc embryos .
genotyping showed that seven lines had no mutation ( gcat +/+ mef ) , seven were heterozygous , and three had homozygous mutations ( gcat m / m mef ) .
we randomly selected three of the seven gcat +/+ mef lines and the three gcat m / m mef lines for further investigation ( fig. 5a ) .
the complete absence of the gcat protein in gcat m / m mef lines was confirmed by western blot analysis ( fig. 5b ) .
comparison of respiratory function and doubling time between gcat +/+ mefs and gcat m / m mefs showed no respiration defects and no growth retardation in gcat m / m mefs ( fig. 5c and e ) .
moreover , the amounts of nuclear - and mtdna - coded subunits of respiratory complexes did not differ substantially between gcat +/+ mef and gcat m / m mef lines ( fig. 5d ) .
these observations suggest that the absence of respiration defects and growth retardation in gcat m / m mef lines are related to the absence of embryonic lethality of gcat m / m mice .
discussion in our previous studies12,17 , we put forward the hypothesis that age - associated respiration defects in human fibroblasts are not due to mutations but to the epigenetic regulation , because reprogramming fibroblasts from elderly humans by generating ipscs restores normal mitochondrial respiratory function .
our hypothesis also proposed that epigenetic downregulation of human gcat or shmt2 or both would partly be related to age - associated respiration defects .
to test this hypothesis , we generated mice deficient in gcat or shmt2 , and examined whether suppression of these genes induces respiration defects .
mice deficient in shmt2 ( shmt2 m / m ) showed embryonic lethality , but mice deficient in gcat ( gcat m / m ) did not ( fig. 1 ) .
to further investigate the embryonic lethality of shmt2 m / m mice , we isolated mef lines from 12.5 - dpc embryos and showed that shmt2 m / m mef lines had respiration defects ( fig. 5c ) .
moreover , the absence of shmt2 ( fig. 5b ) reduced the amounts of the mtdna - coded subunits of the respiratory complexes ( fig. 5d ) .
therefore , these results are consistent with our hypothesis12,17 that epigenetic downregulation of human shmt2 is involved in age - associated respiration defects .
probably , age - associated downregulation of human shmt2 12 suppresses one - carbon metabolism to produce glycine and fmet - trna13,14 , both of which are required for translation in mitochondria , and thereby decreases the production of the mtdna - encoded subunits of the respiratory complexes , resulting in expression of age - associated respiration defects .
questions that then arise are why gcat m / m mice are not embryonic lethal ( fig. 1 ) , and why gcat m / m mef lines do not show respiration defects ( fig. 5c ) , even though both gcat and shmt2 genes are involved in glycine production in mitochondria13,14 .
this discrepancy could be resolved by assuming that embryonic lethality and the respiration defects induced by shmt2 disruption result from fmet - trna depletion but not glycine depletion .
the shmt2 pathway generates fmet - trna via two processes ; one is conversion of serine and tetrahydrofolate ( thf ) to glycine and 5,10 - methylene - thf , and the other is conversion of the resultant glycine to 5,10 - methylene - thf via the glycine cleavage system ( gcs ) 14 .
in contrast , the gcat pathway , which involves the l - threonine dehydrogenase ( tdh ) gene , contributes to the generation of fmet - trna only via conversion of threonine to glycine followed by gcs to produce 5,10 - methylene - thf14 .
moreover , mouse embryonic stem cells use both shmt2 and gcat pathways for production of fmet - trna , but differentiated tissues use the shmt2 pathway predominantly due to inactivation of the gcat pathway by suppression of tdh 13 .
given that lethality of shmt2 m / m embryos occurs after 13.5 dpc ( fig. 3 ) , it can be supposed that shmt2 m / m embryos could not produce sufficient amounts of fmet - trna after 13.5 dpc due to disruption of shmt2 and suppression of tdh , resulting in respiration defects and embryonic lethality .
in contrast , gcat m / m embryos produce fmet - trna even after 13.5 dpc due to the active shmt2 pathway , resulting in the absence of respiration defects and embryonic lethality .
furthermore , the results of an in vitro study18 suggest that shmt2 catalyzes not only conversion of serine to glycine but also conversion of threonine to glycine , which indicates compensation of the gcat pathway by shmt2 pathway ; this compensation could also explain the absence of respiration defects in gcat m / m mefs and the absence of lethality in gcat m / m embryos .
in addition to the mitochondrial respiration defects , shmt2 m / m mefs also showed significant growth retardation , but gcat m / m mefs showed neither respiration defects nor growth retardation ( fig. 5 ) .
the growth retardation of shmt2 m / m mefs could be due to the respiration defects , because our previous studies19,20 provided evidence that respiration defects caused by pathogenic mtdna mutations in mouse tumor cells delay their growth under the skin of syngenic b6j mice .
however , it is also possible that growth retardation of shmt2 m / m mef is due to impaired nucleotide production , because shmt2 also contributes to nucleotide production via one - carbon metabolism13,14 , and plays an important role in growth or survival of tumor cells21 - 23 and immune cells24 .
all these observations suggest that shmt2 disruption impairs one - carbon metabolism producing nucleotides and fmet - trna13,14 , and thus could be responsible for growth retardation and respiration defects , resulting in the lethality of shmt2 m / m embryos ( figs 1 b and 3a ) .
at the time of writing this report , the gcat m / m mice and shmt2 m /+ mice ( 9 month - of - age ) showed no macroscopic abnormalities including premature aging phenotypes , such as kyphosis , greying , or alopecia , which have been observed in the mtdna mutator mice9,10 .
in a previous study25 , we generated mtdna mutator mice with the same b6j nuclear background as that of gcat m / m or shmt2 m /+ mice , and found that their lifespan was short and they had kyphosis but no greying or alopecia .
this premature aging phenotype ( kyphosis ) in our mtdna mutator m / m mice was also observed in mito - micedelta carrying mtdna with a large - scale deletion and having the b6j nuclear background , which we generated previously as a model for mitochondrial diseases26,27 .
given that median survival times of heterozygous and homozygous mtdna mutator mice with the b6j nuclear background were 27 and 10 months , respectively25 , further studies are required to examine whether gcat m / m and shmt2 m /+ mice eventually have shorter lifespans than that of b6j mice and express a premature aging phenotype of kyphosis .

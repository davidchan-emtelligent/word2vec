background respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) is a major cause of severe lower respiratory tract illness in young children worldwide .
treatment options for severe rsv disease remain limited and the development of therapeutic treatment strategies remains a priority .
ll - 37 , a small cationic host defense peptide involved in anti - inflammatory and anti - bacterial responses , reduces replication of or infection by multiple viruses , including influenza virus , in vitro , and protects against lethal challenge with influenza virus in vivo .
ll - 37 also protects against rsv infection of hep - 2 cells in vitro ; however , hep - 2 are not reflective of polarized airway epithelial cells and respond differently to rsv infection .
an air - liquid interface ( ali ) calu - 3 model that more closely mimics the human airway epithelium was established .
using this in vitro model , the effectiveness of ll - 37 in preventing rsv infection and replication was examined .
results ll - 37 , when pre - incubated with virus prior to rsv infection ( prophylactic ) , significantly reduced the level of viral genome detected in infected calu - 3 cells , and decreased chemokine expression associated with rsv infection in vitro .
in contrast , therapeutic treatment of rsv - infected ali calu - 3 at 24 h and 3 days post - infection had minimal impact on rsv infection .
conclusions differences in the efficacy of ll - 37 at reducing rsv infection under prophylactic and therapeutic conditions may in part be ascribed to differences in the method of peptide exposure .
however , the efficacy of ll - 37 at reducing rsv infection under prophylactic conditions indicates that further studies examining the efficacy of ll - 37 as a small peptide inhibitor of rsv are warranted .
keywords ll - 37 cathelicidin respiratory syncytial virus air - liquid interface calu - 3 issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 findings respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract illness in infants and children and of serious disease in elderly and immune compromised patients [ 1 - 3 ] .
rsv infection results in substantial morbidity and hospitalizations each year [ 4 , 5 ] , and treatment for rsv associated illness is limited .
there is currently no safe and effective licensed vaccine against rsv , and immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab is indicated to reduce the incidence of rsv - associated disease in high - risk infants [ 6 ] .
treatment of acute rsv disease remains primarily supportive in nature [ 7 ] .
aerosolized ribivarin , a synthetic nucleotide analog , may be considered for use in severe rsv disease in hospitalized patients or in those who are at risk for severe disease ; however , due to its expense , delivery method , and toxicity , its use is limited [ 8 ] .
several small molecule inhibitors have been evaluated for treatment of rsv [ 9 - 11 ] , but none have yet been reported to be effective in humans .
thus , the development of alternative therapeutic strategies remains important .
the cationic peptide cathelicidin , ll - 37 , is an important part of the early innate immune response to bacterial infection .
ll - 37 is the predominant active cleavage product of the cationic host defense peptide hcap18 , and its expression , upregulated in response to inflammation and bacterial and viral infection , is detectable in multiple cell types , including neutrophils , epithelial cells , and macrophages [ 12 ] .
initially characterized as an anti - microbial peptide , ll - 37 also demonstrates anti - viral activity .
in vitro , ll - 37 inhibits replication of human immunodeficiency virus - 1 ( hiv - 1 ) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [ 13 ] , reduces vaccinia virus plaque formation and mrna expression [ 14 ] , and reduces infectious virus following herpes simplex virus - 1 ( hsv - 1 ) and adenovirus - 19 infection in a549 cells [ 15 ] .
ll - 37 has potent in vitro and in vivo anti - viral activity against influenza virus .
ll - 37 therapeutic treatment reduced mortality , virus titers , and the levels of cytokine expression in the lungs of mice challenged with a lethal strain of influenza virus [ 16 ] .
ll - 37 is also effective at reducing the number of rsv - infected hep - 2 cells , and at reducing the spread of rsv infection in hep - 2 in vitro [ 17 ] .
hep - 2 cells , derived from a human laryngeal carcinoma , are often used to propagate rsv , and to study human epithelial cellular responses to rsv infection .
however , hep - 2 cells do not polarize or differentiate , and in contrast to a polarized , differentiated model of normal human bronchial epithelial cells [ 18 , 19 ] , hep - 2 form large cytopathic effect ( cpe ) following rsv infection , indicating that the hep - 2 cell line is not an ideal model system for characterizing in vivo human cellular response to rsv infection .
previous studies have demonstrated that liquid covered cultures of polarized calu - 3 cells ( lcc calu - 3 ) are susceptible to rsv infection [ 20 , 21 ] .
however , these cells are cultured with medium at both the apical and basolateral surfaces .
to more closely mimic the physiology of the human airway epithelium , air - liquid interface cultures of calu - 3 ( ali calu - 3 ) , shown to exhibit morphological characteristics similar to differentiated , polarized normal human bronchial epithelial cells ( nhbe ) [ 18 ] , were derived from liquid - covered calu - 3 ( lcc calu - 3 ) cultures .
before examining the ability of ll - 37 to inhibit rsv infection of calu - 3 cells , the susceptibility of ali calu - 3 to rsv strain a2 ( rsv - a2 ) infection was compared to that of lcc calu - 3 , examining relative viral genome levels by qrt - pcr , reported as genome equivalents / ml , and the production of infectious virus by plaque assay , reported as pfu / ml. similar to lcc calu - 3 , ali calu - 3 were susceptible to rsv - a2 infection at the apical surface , with viral genome or infectious virus detected as early as 3 days post - infection ( pi ) , and little infectious virus detected in the basolateral compartment of cultures following infection ( data not shown ) .
identical relative levels of viral genome in rsv - a2 infected ali calu - 3 and lcc calu - 3 were observed at 3 days ( 6.2 x 104 genome equivalents / ml rsv - a2 infected ali - calu - 3 and 8.6 x 104 genome equivalents / ml rsv - a2 infected lcc calu - 3 ; p = 0.073 ) and 1 week pi ( 1.0 x 105 genome equivalents / ml rsv - a2 infected ali - calu - 3 and 1.7 x 105 genome equivalents / ml rsv - a2 infected lcc calu - 3 ; p = 0.20 ) indicating that there are no differences in susceptibility to infection between ali and lcc calu - 3 models .
though viral genome was detectable as early as 3 days pi , the production of infectious virus by rsv - a2 infected ali calu - 3 was not consistently detectable from all replicates until 7 days pi , and the level of viral genome production reached a plateau at day 7 pi. thus , studies were performed at 7 days pi. taken together , ali calu - 3 maintained a stable ali and can be used as an in vitro model for rsv infection of human airway epithelium .
thus , the effectiveness of ll - 37 as a potential prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against rsv infection were examined in ali calu - 3 .
peptides ll - 37 ( llgdffrkskekigkegkrivqrikdflrnlvprtes ) and an ll - 37 analog having a " scrambled " sequence ( rslegtdrfpfvrlknsrklefkdikgikreqfvkil ; sll37 control peptide ) were synthesized as previously described [ 16 ] .
to assess in vitro antiviral effects of these peptides , rsv - a2 was exposed to 50 mug / ml peptides for 1 h at 37 degreesc in serum - free eagle 's minimum essential medium ( emem ) prior to apical infection of ali calu - 3 , ( prophylactic treatment , performed using undiluted peptide - rsv a2 incubated reaction ) , or ali calu - 3 were infected at the apical surface with rsv - a2 , and peptides were added to the basolateral medium of ali calu - 3 24 h after infection and replenished 3 days pi ( therapeutic treatment ) .
dose response studies performed in monolayer cultured , non - polarized calu - 3 demonstrated that prophylactic administration of 50 mug / ml of ll - 37 effectively inhibited the release of infectious virus from cells , whereas tenfold lower doses of ll - 37 did not inhibit the release of infectious virus from infected cells ( data not shown ) .
in ali calu - 3 , pre - incubation of rsv - a2 with 50 mug / ml ll - 37 under prophylactic conditions resulted in a range of 60 - 92 % reduction in the amount of viral genome detected in infected cells at 7 days pi ( fig. 1 ) as compared to untreated , infected cells ( p = 0.00043 ) or sll - 37 treated , infected cells ( p = 0.00022 ) .
therapeutic treatment of rsv - a2 - - infected ali calu - 3 , in which 50 mug / ml ll - 37 was added to the basolateral compartment of infected cells 24 h pi and replenished at 3 days pi , was associated with a 39 % reduction in the amount of viral genome detected at 7 days pi ( p = 0.054 ) .
in contrast , prophylactic or therapeutic treatment with the control scrambled ll - 37 , was not associated with a change in the level of viral genome detected in infected ali calu - 3 , demonstrating the specificity of the ll - 37 peptide sequence at inhibiting rsv replication .
consistent with previous studies , rsv - a2 infection of polarized calu - 3 did not impact the trans - epithelial electrical resistance ( teer ) of infected calu - 3 cells at 7 days pi ( table 1 , [ 21 ]) .
at the time point examined , treatment with ll - 37 and sll - 37 did not impact the teer of infected ali calu - 3 , indicating that the concentration of peptides used in this study was not detrimental to the polarized nature of the cultures ( table 1 ) .
though the teer at day 7 pi was below 1000 omega x cm2 , the ali cultures retained their ali. fig. 1 ll - 37 reduces rsv - a2 infection of and replication in ali calu - 3 .
ali - - cultured calu - 3 cells were infected at the apical surface with rsv - a2 at moi = 1 , or treated prophylactically or therapeutically with 50 mug / ml ll - 37 or sll - 37 .
prophylactic treatment was defined as a 1 h co - incubation of virus with peptide immediately prior to infection .
therapeutic treatment was defined as inclusion of peptide in the basolateral medium , beginning 24 h pi , with replacement of medium and peptide at 3 days pi. total cellular rna was isolated from five replicates per infection condition at 7 days pi , and the relative level of rsv - m gene was determined by qrt - pcr .
data is presented as the mean relative level of rsv - m gene , in genome equivalents / ml , of five replicates +/ - sd. asterisk indicates p <= 0.05 as determined by unpaired two - tailed analysis .
the data presented in this figure is representative of three independent experiments table 1 trans - epithelial electrical resistance of ali calu - 3 at 7 days post - infection treatment untreateda prophylactic therapeutic mock - infected 392 +/ - 16 ( range 376 - 451 ) - - rsv - a2 445 +/ - 152 ( range 421 - 1098 ) - - rsv - a2 + ll - 37 - 520 +/ - 105 ( range 315 - 886 ) 313 +/ - 84 ( range 184 - 594 ) rsv - a2 + sll - 37 - 560 +/ - 126 ( range 289 - 936 ) 316 +/ - 114 ( range 221 - 864 ) the trans - epithelial electrical resistance ( teer ) of five wells per treatment condition was evaluated at day 7 post - infection , and is presented as median omega x cm2 +/ - sem of five individual wells per treatment condition , with the range of teer measurements indicated in parentheses .
no significant differences between prophylactic and therapeutic treatments or between mock - infected and infected treatment conditions were found using unpaired two - tailed statistical analysis .
the data presented in this table is representative of three independent experiments a all experimental conditions were performed as one experiment ; mock infected and rsv - a2 infected controls in the absence of peptide were performed simultaneously alongside prophylactic and therapeutic peptide treatments of infected ali calu - 3 rsv infection of airway epithelium is associated with induction of multiple cytokines and chemokines .
to evaluate the impact of ll - 37 treatment on cytokine and chemokine expression induced in response to rsv - a2 infection of ali calu - 3 , a 30 min wash of the apical surface of infected cells with emem + 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum was obtained 7 days pi , and cytokine and chemokine expression levels were determined using a bioplex cytokine assay ( biorad ) according to the manufacturer 's directions .
rsv - a2 infection of ali calu - 3 was consistently associated with a statistically significant ( p <= 0.05 ) increase in the apical release of ip - 10 and rantes ( fig. 2 , p <= 0.05 compared to mock - infected ali calu - 3 ) .
the levels of il - 1ra , il - 4 , il - 10 , il - 13 , ifngamma , mcp - 1 , pdgf - bb , bfgf and vegf released from the apical surface of ali calu - 3 did not differ following mock - - or rsv - a2 infection at 7 days pi ( data not shown ) .
finally , the levels of il - 1beta , il - 2 , il - 5 , il - 7 , il - 8 , il - 9 , il - 12p70 , il - 15 , il - 17 , g - csf , mip - 1alpha and - 1beta , tnfalpha , eotaxin , and gm - csf released from the apical surface of ali - calu - 3 did not demonstrate consistent changes between experiments following rsv - a2 infection ( data not shown ) .
in 2 of 3 replicate experiments , rsv - a2 infection was also associated with significant increase in the apical release of il - 6 ( p = 0.0003 ) and g - csf ( p = 0.006 )) .
ll - 37 and sll - 37 , used either under prophylactic or therapeutic conditions , reduced rsv - a2 - - induced expression of both of these cytokines .
however , ll - 37 reduced rsv - a2 - - induced il - 6 expression by 34 - 40 % ( p = 0.035 ) , whereas sll37 reduced rsv - a2 - - induced il - 6 expression by 16 - 18 % ( p = 0.029 ). fig. 2 prophylactic treatment with ll - 37 reduces chemokine expression associated with rsv - a2 infection .
ali - - cultured calu - 3 cells were infected at the apical surface with rsv - a2 at moi = 1 , or treated prophylactically or therapeutically with 50 mug / ml ll - 37 or sll - 37 .
prophylactic treatment was defined as a 1 h co - incubation of virus with peptide immediately prior to infection .
therapeutic treatment was defined as inclusion of peptide in the basolateral medium , beginning 24 h pi , with replacement of medium and peptide at 3 days pi. at 7 days pi , an apical wash was performed of all samples , and cytokine and chemokine expression was determined by 27 - plex bioplex assay of three samples per infection condition .
data is presented as mean pg / ml of each cytokine +/ - sd. asterisk , p <= 0.05 compared to levels of expression from mock - infected ali - calu - 3 ; dagger , p <= 0.05 compared to levels of expression from rsv - a2 - - infected ali - calu - 3 ; double dagger , p <= 0.05 between ll - 37 and sll - 37 - - treated , rsv - a2 infected ali - calu - 3 , as determined by unpaired two - tailed analysis .
the data presented in this figure is representative of three independent experiments the induction of rantes and ip - 10 by rsv infection is consistent with previous studies in other cell lines [ 22 , 23 ] , and in plasma following rsv infection in children [ 24 ] , however their function in modulating the immune response to rsv infection is unclear .
the expression of rantes and ip - 10 , the only chemokines whose expression was consistently increased at 7 days post infection with rsv - a2 , were specifically reduced by prophylactic treatment of rsv - a2 with ll - 37 ( p = 0.005 and 0.001 , respectively ) , and not by sll37 ( fig. 2 ) .
in contrast , therapeutic treatment of rsv - a2 - - infected ali calu - 3 with either ll - 37 or sll - 37 was associated with a reduction in the levels of rsv - a2 associated levels of expression of ip - 10 ( p = 0.035 and 0.038 , respectively ) , but neither peptide significantly impacted the induction of rantes expression in response to rsv - a2 infection .
in our study , pre - incubation of rsv with ll - 37 was more efficient than therapeutic treatment at reducing viral load and chemokine expression in rsv infected cells .
these observations are consistent with previous studies , in which ll - 37 reduced rsv - a2 infection of hep - 2 cells , when ll - 37 was incubated with either cells or virus prior to infection , and also when administered simultaneously with rsv infection [ 17 ] .
these observations suggest that ll - 37 may be effective in part through direct interaction with rsv , and in part through interaction with and uptake by hep - 2 cells [ 17 ] .
similar to the results of our study , delayed treatment of hep - 2 cells ablated the ability of ll - 37 to reduce rsv infection or spread in vitro [ 17 ] .
additionally , pre - incubation of influenza virus with ll - 37 was more successful at neutralizing infection of mdck and primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells ( htbe ) compared to treatment of infected cells with ll - 37 after infection [ 25 ] , in part due to direct interaction of ll - 37 with influenza virus .
together , these studies suggest that ll - 37 may have been more effective at reducing the amount of viral genome following rsv infection when used as a prophylactic agent instead of a therapeutic agent because pre - incubation of virus with ll - 37 reduced the amount of infectious rsv available to infect ali calu - 3 .
differences in peptide uptake at the apical and basolateral surfaces may also be partly responsible for the observed differences in the ability of ll - 37 to reduce viral replication when used under therapeutic treatment conditions .
currently , there is no evidence that endogenous hcap - 18 / ll - 37 is activated upon rsv infection , and endogenous expression of ll - 37 by calu - 3 cells has not been demonstrated .
additional studies are required to determine whether treatment of calu - 3 with peptide , as opposed to pre - incubation with rsv - a2 , inhibits rsv infection of ali calu - 3 , and whether the apical and basolateral surfaces of ali calu - 3 differ in their ability to uptake ll - 37 peptide .
human cathelicidin ll - 37 enhances tlr3 - - mediated signaling and il - 6 , il - 10 , and mcp - 1 expression in the airway epithelial cell line beas - 2b in response to rhinovirus infection [ 26 ] .
the ability of tlr3 to mediate double - stranded rna responses in beas - 2b is due to endosomal co - localization of ll - 37 and tlr3 , and the presence of ll - 37 in tlr3 - - containing endosomes is increased in the presence of dsrna [ 27 ] , an intermediate in the replication cycle of rsv .
rsv infection of a549 and of human tracheal bronchial epithelial cells ( htbe ) induces expression of tlr3 and upregulates nf - kappab activation and cytokine expression in response to dsrna in a pkr - dependent manner [ 28 ] .
these observations contrast with our study , in which ll - 37 was associated with reduced levels of cytokine and chemokine expression in response to infection .
previous studies have demonstrated that the amount of rsv strain a used to infect human epithelial kidney cells directly correlated with the level of cxcl8 / il - 8 and rantes produced in response to infection , and chemokine production in response to infection was dependent on tlr3 expression [ 29 ] .
thus , although tlr3 has been associated with increased cytokine and chemokine production in response to dsrna and to rsv infection , the lower amount of viral rna present in ll - 37 - - treated ali calu - 3 may at least in part be responsible for the lower levels of cytokine and chemokine production following rsv infection .
however , the differences observed in cytokine and chemokine expression may also in part be due to the greater fusion activity and pathogenicity of rsv a compared to rsv - a2 [ 30 - 33 ] .
the mechanism by which both ll - 37 and sll - 37 reduce rantes and ip - 10 expression when used to therapeutically treat rsv - - infected ali calu - 3 in our studies is unclear .
recent studies have demonstrated apical , cytoplasmic , and basolateral expression of tlr3 in human airway epithelium , primary human airway epithelial cell cultures , and polarized beas - 2b cells [ 34 ] , suggesting that the ability of ll - 37 to interact with tlr3 is not impacted by basolateral delivery of ll - 37 as used in our studies .
cationic peptides , including poly - arginine , are able to activate tlr3 signaling in beas - 2b cells [ 26 ] , suggesting that at least some of the non - specific ability of sll - 37 to inhibit cytokine and chemokine expression in rsv - infected ali calu - 3 may be due to the cationic nature of the peptide .
our results show a reduction in intracellular viral genome and in the production of cytokines and chemokines associated with rsv strain a2 when ll - 37 is used in a prophylactic regimen .
these studies support further evaluation of ll - 37 effectiveness against more pathogenic rsv strains and recent clinical isolates .

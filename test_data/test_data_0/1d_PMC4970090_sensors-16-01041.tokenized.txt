precise localization has attracted considerable interest in wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) localization systems .
due to the internal or external disturbance , the existence of the outliers , including both the distance outliers and the anchor outliers , severely decreases the localization accuracy .
in order to eliminate both kinds of outliers simultaneously , an outlier detection method is proposed based on the maximum entropy principle and fuzzy set theory .
since not all the outliers can be detected in the detection process , the maximum entropy function ( mef ) method is utilized to tolerate the errors and calculate the optimal estimated locations of unknown nodes .
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed localization method remains stable while the outliers vary .
moreover , the localization accuracy is highly improved by wisely rejecting outliers .
wireless sensor networks localization outliers maximum entropy principle fuzzy set theory 1 .
introduction wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) , the networks of sensor nodes , have been widely used in many promising applications such as condition monitoring , target tracking , and home security .
precise localization plays an important role in wsns localization systems. from the viewpoint of localization systems , there are two types of sensor nodes in wsns .
anchor nodes , also known as beacon nodes , can obtain their location directly by using manual placement or global positioning system ( gps ) ; unknown nodes , also known as regular nodes , derive their locations through localization methods .
up to now , most existing localization algorithms of wsns could be classified as either range - based localization [ 1,2 ] or range - free localization [ 3,4 ] .
range - based localization algorithms use absolute point - to - point range measurements ( distance or angle ) to estimate unknown nodes' locations , while range - free localization algorithms depend on the contents of received messages .
in this paper , the range - based localization methods are taken into consideration , since they are normally of high localization accuracy [ 5 ] .
in localization methods , the calculation of unknown node 's positions heavily relies on primary data , which are the distances between neighboring nodes and the position knowledge of anchors .
in many applications of wsns , sensor nodes are vulnerable to the internal or external disturbance .
as a result of the inference , the measured distances and anchor positions can deviate from their true values .
these inaccurate values are called outliers , including both the distance outliers and the anchor outliers .
due to the existence of outliers , the usage of such corrupted data can severely degrade the localization accuracy .
hence , the outlier detection process [ 6 ] is a necessary step to assure data quality in localization process .
up to the present , most existing outlier detection methods [ 7,8,9 ] simply assume that either distance or anchor position is the outlier , thus they are not comprehensive detecting methods .
furthermore , when the difference between the outlier value and the normal value is small enough , the outlier will not be detected , thus these methods will clearly be invalid .
therefore , an error - tolerant localization method is greatly needed to calculate the estimated locations of unknown nodes in the presence of undetected outliers .
the error - tolerant localization method is a positioning refinement process which allows the existence of undetected outliers instead of discarding them. through the error - tolerant localization process , the accuracy of localization will be improved efficiently .
in this paper , a novel secure localization method is developed to reject both the distance outliers and anchor outliers .
firstly , the uncertain value of the measured distances is obtained based on the maximum entropy theory in the lack of ranging error distribution .
the uncertain value is served as the threshold in the membership function , which is compared with the difference between the euclidean distance and the measured distance between every two neighboring anchor nodes .
the euclidean distance is calculated by the coordinates of the two anchors while the measured distance is obtained by the range - based methods .
secondly , a trust evaluation model is constructed based on the fuzzy set theory .
in the trust evaluation model , a membership function is used to calculate the mutual trust values of anchor nodes. through the data fusion , the trust value of each anchor node is obtained , and the lower trust value nodes are discarded .
finally , the maximum entropy function ( mef ) method is used to calculate the optimal estimated locations of unknown nodes by using the trustable data .
simulations demonstrate that the outliers can be detected effectively and the localization method can achieve high accuracy .
the rest of this paper is organized as follows .
section 2 reviews the related works .
section 3 shows a preliminary structure of sensor nodes localization system .
section 4 describes the outlier detection method .
section 5 presents the mef method for calculating the optimal estimated locations of unknown nodes .
section 6 shows the simulation results .
finally , section 7 concludes this paper .
2. related works generally speaking , the outliers have three anomalous causes : ( 1 ) hardware malfunctions ; ( 2 ) environment interferences ; or ( 3 ) malicious attacks [ 10 ] .
for instance , in time of arrival ( toa ) and time difference of arrival ( tdoa ) systems , the transmission time or reception time of a packet can be delayed , thus resulting in distance enlargement or distance reduction [ 11 ] .
in received signal strength indicator ( rssi ) - based localization systems , the signal strength may be unstable or shadowed in the presence of natural or artificial interferences [ 12 ] .
in malicious attacks , an attacker can increase or decrease the transmission power to make the measured distances deviate from their true values .
in addition , the attacker can also capture anchor nodes to declare fake anchor positions to generate anchor outliers [ 13 ] .
in practice , the existence of outliers is a fact that cannot be neglected for localization algorithms .
in the case of distance outliers , a consistency check method [ 14 ] has been proposed to filter out the malicious beacon signals .
the signals contain measured distance outliers on the basis of the " consistency " .
however , if the attackers do not revise the measured distances randomly , but make the modified distances be consistent , the strategy mentioned above will be failed under this scenario .
in literature [ 15 ] , linear equations are used to describe the localization problem .
hence , the norm and linear programming are applied to detect the outliers and avoid the wild measurements in the final solution .
to deal with noisy and outlier ranging results , a theoretical foundation [ 16 ] has been built to identify distance outliers based on graph embeddability and rigidity theory .
however , rigidity theory requires high ranging accuracy and it is computationally intensive. by applying the rigidity theory , the concept of verifiable edges [ 17 ] has been presented and the conditions for an edge to be verifiable have been derived .
on this basis , the paper designs outlier detection method which explicitly eliminates ranges with large errors .
however , facing with the undetected small outliers , the method would lose efficacy .
in summary , based on the detection target , the literatures [ 14,15,16,17 ] mentioned above ignore the influence of anchor outliers .
therefore , these methods are one - sided .
regarding anchor outliers , a scheme named localization anomaly detection ( lad ) [ 18 ] is put forward to detect malicious anchor node .
the scheme attempts to perform compromise resistant localization without removing the malicious anchors .
to monitor and timely detect anchor outliers in large - scale wsns , a rule - based anomaly detection system , called rads [ 19 ] , has been proposed .
in conclusion , the results of the algorithms [ 18,19 ] which are committed to eliminate anchor outliers are not comprehensive without analyzing the influence of ranges with large errors. with respect to both outliers , an innovative modular solution [ 20 ] , featuring two lightweight modules , has been developed .
one is attack detection module that harnesses simple geometric triangular rules and an efficient voting technique .
the other is secure localization module that computes and clusters certain reference points to estimate the coordinate of the unknown nodes .
in [ 21 ] , a novel algorithm , called neighbor constraint assisted distributed localization ( nca - dl ) , has been proposed .
the method introduces the geometric constraints to detect outliers .
to make localization attack - tolerant , a robust statistical method [ 22 ] has been presented. by using an adaptive least squares and least median squares ( lms ) position estimator , the method is capable of switching to a robust mode when the outliers exist .
as a summary of the foregoing , the methods [ 20,21,22 ] could dispel either the anchor outliers or distance outliers .
if two kinds of outliers both exit , the geometric constraints and statistical method will become invalid to filter out malicious colluding beacons or the beacon whose measured distance and coordinates change at the same time .
in addition , to reduce the impact of both outliers simultaneously , jin et al .
[ 23 ] has put forward a trilateral localization algorithm for outliers suppression .
however , the study of the paper focuses on the error of the algorithm itself , and discusses the stability of equations .
this outliers excluded are just a portion of malicious beacons .
reference [ 24 ] designs a beta reputation system - based localization ( brsl ) algorithm to mainly detect and eliminate both outliers , but the taylor - series least squares localization algorithm utilized after trust evaluation phase ca n't reach high accuracy .
3. preliminaries a wsn consists of two types of nodes , namely anchor nodes and unknown nodes .
the anchor nodes are specially equipped and aware of their coordinates after deployment .
the unknown nodes , whose positions are yet to be discovered , estimate their locations by measuring distances to neighboring anchor nodes .
all the nodes are randomly deployed in a 2d spatial region .
the communication radius of unknown or anchor nodes is r. every node is capable of measuring the distance to any of its immediate neighbors through measurement techniques such as rss , toa or tdoa .
as shown in figure 1 , when the unknown node nu gets enough measured distances dui ' to anchor nodes ni ( i = 1,2 ,... , m ) , m >= 3 , a system of euclidean equations can be set up according to the trilateration : ( 1 ) {( x1 - xu ) 2 +( y1 - yu ) 2 = du1'2 ( x2 - xu ) 2 +( y2 - yu ) 2 = du2'2 ...( xm - xu ) 2 +( ym - yu ) 2 = dum'2 where xu =[ xu,yu ] t is nu 's coordinates that need to be estimated , xi =[ xi,yi ] t is anchor node ni 's declared position , and dui ' is the measured distance between the anchor node and the unknown node .
generally , xu should be located in the intersection of m circles , of which the centers and radiuses are xi and dui ' , respectively .
the smaller the intersection is , the more accurately xu can be pinpointed .
when both xu and dui ' are accurate , the xu can be well estimated by solving equation ( 1 ) .
however , if the distance outliers or the anchor outliers exist , the system would incorrectly estimate the xu to a location that deviate far from its physical position .
the measured distance can be expressed as dui '= dui + er , and the declared anchor position can be expressed as xi '=[ xi + epx,yi + epy ] , where er and ep are the ranging error and the anchor position error , respectively .
ranging error er is the difference between real distance and measured distance between two sensor nodes .
position error ep is the difference between the real position of the anchor node and the received position of the anchor node .
if the distance - measuring process is disturbed , the measured distance du2 ' between anchor node a2 and unknown nodenu , as well as the measured distance between anchor node a2 and a1 , will be enlarged or reduced .
take the enlarged case for example .
as shown in figure 2a , the distance outlier is du2 ''= du2 + er + da = du2 '+ da , where da is the enlarged distance , and du2 is the real distance between anchor node a2 and unknown node nu. meanwhile , the euclidean distance between a1 and a2 , i.e. , || a1a2 || , is different from their measured distance || a1a2 '|| .
in addition , if the measured distance du2 ' , as well as the measured distance between anchor node a2 and a1 , is reduced , the computed distance between a1 and a2 , i.e. || a1a2 || , is also different from its measured distance || a1a2 '|| .
as shown in figure 2b , if anchor node a2 is malicious , the declared anchor position may deviate far from the true position .
the anchor outlier is defined as x2 ''=[ x2 + epx + dx,y2 + epy + dy ] , where [ dx,dy ] is the offset distance .
in addition , the euclidean distance between a1 and a2 , i.e. || a1a2 '|| , is not equal to their measurement distance || a1a2 || .
based on the above discussion , these outliers will severely degrade the localization accuracy .
therefore , it is necessary to eliminate the outliers in localization systems .
the measured distance and anchor positions exist in pairs in the localization systems .
considering two neighboring anchor nodes around an unknown node , no matter the measured distance between the two anchor nodes is enlarged or the declared position of one anchor node deviates far from the true position , the euclidean distance will be different from the measured distance between the two anchor nodes .
therefore , no matter the distance outliers or the anchor outliers exist , or how they are generated , the difference between the euclidean distance and the measured distance , as well as the cooperation of anchor nodes , can be utilized to detect the outliers .
4. outlier detection method in this section , firstly , the uncertain value of measured distances is calculated based on maximum entropy theory by using the ranging error priori information .
then a trust evaluation model is constructed based on the fuzzy set theory by using the uncertain value and the difference between the euclidean distance and the measured distance .
in the trust evaluation model , the trust value of each anchor node can be obtained .
4.1 .
calculation of the entropy uncertainty based on the maximum entropy theory , the uncertain value of the measured distance can be obtained by utilizing the mean and standard deviation of ranging error in this section .
the information entropy h ( er ) [ 25 ] of ranging error can be calculated as formula ( 2 ) , ( 2 ) h ( er )= - sumi = 1np ( eri ) ln p ( eri ) where p ( er ) is the probability density function of ranging error .
the ranging error er is assumed to appear in [ er1,er2 ] with equal probability before measuring .
then , after measurement , the estimated ranging error er ' with bias +/ - u is obtained , where u is the entropy uncertainty of ranging error .
hence the true value of ranging error appears in [ er ' - u,er '+ u ] .
the information entropy of er ' can be calculated as formula ( 3 ) .
( 3 ) h ( er ')= - integraler ' - uer '+ u12uln12uder = ln 2u as we all know , the probability density function of gaussian distribution n ( 0,sigma2 ) is ( 4 ) p ( er )= 12pisigmaexp ( - er22sigma2 ) hence the information entropy of ranging error can be calculated as formula ( 5 ) .
( 5 ) h ( er )= integral - infinity + infinityp ( er ) ln p ( er ) der = 12ln [ 2episigma2 ] let formula ( 3 ) equal to formula ( 5 ) , the entropy uncertainty of gaussian distribution n ( 0,sigma2 ) can be derived as formula ( 6 ) .
( 6 ) u = 2pie2sigma = 2.07sigma the entropy coefficient of gaussian distribution is 2.07 .
in general , let u = ksigma , where k is called entropy coefficient and sigma is the standard error deviation .
the value of k depends on the error distribution .
in this paper , the distribution of ranging error is unknown , so that k cannot be calculated directly .
definition 1 illustrates how to choose the value of k. definition 1 .
based on the maximum entropy principle [ 26 ] and the obtained partial information of the unknown distribution , the distribution with the maximum entropy should be selected .
in all the distributions , gaussian distribution has the maximum information entropy .
thus , the entropy coefficient of gaussian distribution can be used to calculate the entropy uncertainty of ranging error in this paper .
it is a relatively conservative but reasonable choice .
proof of definition 1 .
given the probability distribution of p ( x ) and q ( x ) , the in equation ( 7 ) can be obtained by using the inequation of log x <=( x - 1 ) , ( 7 ) integralp ( x ) logq ( x ) p ( x ) dx <= integralp ( x )( q ( x ) p ( x ) - 1 ) dx = integralq ( x ) dx - integralp ( x ) dx = 0 meanwhile , since logq ( x ) p ( x )= logq ( x )+ log1p ( x ) , integralp ( x ) logq ( x ) p ( x ) dx can be changed into another format .
( 8 ) integralp ( x ) logq ( x ) p ( x ) dx = - integralp ( x ) logp ( x ) dx + integralp ( x ) logq ( x ) dx through formulas ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) , the in equation ( 9 ) can be obtained .
( 9 ) h ( p )<= - integralp ( x ) log q ( x ) dx the formula ( 9 ) is a famous conclusion that entropy of a probability distribution is always less than the relative entropy in the information theory .
only when q ( x )= p ( x ) can the equality hold in formula ( 9 ) .
let q ( x )= n ( u,sigma2 ) , when p ( x ) is under the given condition of mean value u and variance sigma2 , then the formula ( 9 ) can be derived as follows .
( 10 ) h ( p )<= - integralp ( x ) log { 12pisigmae - ( x - u ) 22sigma2 } dx = integralp ( x ){( x - u ) 22sigma2 + log2pisigma } dx = 12sigma2integralp ( x )( x - u ) 2dx + log2pisigma under the limit of the mean value and the variance of p ( x ) : integralp ( x )( x - u ) 2dx = sigma2 , the inequation of h ( p )<= 12sigma2sigma2 + log2pisigma = 12 + log2pisigma can be obtained .
when p ( x )= n ( u,sigma2 ) , the equality of formula ( 9 ) holds .
hence , the conclusion mentioned above in definition 1 is verified .
since the gaussian distribution has the maximum information entropy , it has the maximum entropy coefficient .
choosing the entropy coefficient of gaussian distribution is relatively conservative .
however , based on the maximum entropy principle , the reasonable inference of the unknown distribution is the distribution which is most random and is in accord with the known information .
because this is the only choice which could be made impartially , and any other options mean that other constraints and assumptions would be added , which cannot be obtained based on the known information .
gaussian distribution is the most random distribution in nature , as we all know .
thus , the entropy coefficient of gaussian distribution is a reasonable choice .
4.2 .
foundation of the trust evaluation model after obtaining the entropy uncertainty of ranging error , the uncertain value of distance estimation can be written as ud = b + 2.07sigma , where b is the mean of ranging error .
more specifically , b is calculated as formula ( 11 ) , ( 11 ) b = sumu = 1n ( dui ' - ( xu ' - xu ) 2 +( yu ' - yu ) 2 ) n where dui ' is the measured distance between the anchor node and the unknown node , ( xu ' - xu ) 2 +( yu ' - yu ) 2 is the computed distance between the anchor node and the unknown node , and n is the number of unknown nodes .
because the real distance between the unknown node and anchor node cannot be known in the localization process , the distance outlier needs to be detected by using the cooperation of the neighboring anchor nodes around the unknown node .
the difference between euclidean distances and measured distances is dij =| dij - dij '| , where dij is the euclidean distance between the anchor nodes and dij ' ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 ,... , m ; j = 1 , 2 , 3 ,... , m ; i != j ) is the measured distance between the anchor nodes .
dij is defined as dij =( xi ' - xj ') 2 +( yi ' - yj ') 2 ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 , ... , m ; j = 1 , 2 , 3 , ... , m ; i != j ) , where xi '=[ xi ' , yi '] ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 , ... , m ) , xj '=[ xj ' , yj '] ( j = 1 , 2 , 3 , ... , m ) are the declared coordinates of anchor nodes , and m is the number of anchor nodes .
based on the fuzzy set theory and the neighboring anchor nodes , a trust evaluation model is constructed .
in the model , the fuzzy membership function is shown as formula ( 12 ) .
( 12 ) tij ={ 1dij <= ud0dij > ud define tij as the trust value of anchor node ai from anchor node aj. all these mutual trust values calculated by formula ( 12 ) comprise the fuzzy relation matrix t .
( 13 ) t =[ 0t12 ... t1mt210 ... t2m ............ tm1tm2 ... 0 ] then give a weight matrix w to calculate the trust value of each anchor node .
( 14 ) w =[ 0w12 ... w1mw210 ... w2m ............ wm1wm2 ... 0 ] where wij = 1 / m - 1. through data fusion , an evaluation result vector s can be obtained s = wot =[ s1s2 ... sm ] , where si is the trust value of anchor node ai and si = sumi != j,j = 1mwijtij .
definition 2 .
based on the majority principle , if the trust value of an anchor node is larger than 0.5 , it can be concluded that this anchor node is trusted or normal .
if the trust value of an anchor node is smaller than or equal to 0.5 , it can be determined that the position of the anchor node is an outlier or the corresponding measured distance is an outlier .
discard the outliers and only use the trustable data to estimate the locations of unknown nodes .
since the presence of moving obstacles and other special situations could generate outliers temporarily , the corresponding trust values will decrease at the same time .
throughout the lifetime of the network , this kind of trust value is not credible .
therefore , all the trust values are not stored into the sensor nodes in this paper .
in every localization process , the trust values will be recalculated .
5. mef - based location estimation method 5.1 .
formulation of the localization problem overall , the localization process against outliers consists of two steps .
firstly , in order to eliminate both kinds of outliers simultaneously , an outlier detection method is proposed based on the maximum entropy principle and fuzzy set theory .
the first step of the localization process , named as the initial localization phase or the detecting phase is the foundation of the follow - up positioning process .
then , since not all the outliers can be detected in the detection process , the maximum entropy function ( mef ) method is utilized to tolerate the errors and calculate the optimal estimated locations of unknown nodes .
both steps of the localization algorithm are indispensable .
only by utilizing both steps can the localization accuracy be highly improved .
in a word , the detection method mentioned above should be applied to eliminate distance and anchor outliers in the initial localization phase .
after the detecting phase , the unknown nodes utilize all their multihop communication anchor nodes to estimate their coordinates .
based on the formula ( 1 ) in section 3 , the nodes localization problem is shown as formula ( 15 ) , ( 15 ) min f ( xu )= min sumi = 1m | fi ( xu )|= min sumi = 1m |( xi - xu ) 2 +( yi - yu ) 2 - di '| where xu =[ xu,yu ] t is the coordinate of the estimated unknown node nu in the localization , xi =[ xi,yi ] t is the anchor node ni 's declared position , and di ' is the measured distance between the anchor node ni and the unknown node nu. from formula ( 1 ) , fi ( xu ) is assumed equal to zero .
due to the presence of errors and outliers , fi ( xu ) is not equal to zero actually. by obtaining the minimum sum of fi ( xu ) ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 , ... , m ) , the impact of the comprehensive error on the localization will be minimized .
therefore , the estimated coordinate of unknown node with the minimum sum of fi ( xu ) ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 , ... , m ) can be as the optimal estimated coordinate in the localization .
note that f ( xu ) is a non - smooth function and is difficult to be minimized from formula ( 15 ) .
therefore , the mef method , which is the least biased estimate possibility on the given information and mainly used to solve the non - smooth minimum optimization problem [ 27 ] , is used to estimate the locations of unknown nodes in this paper .
using the mef method , f ( xu ) can be changed into the entropy function fp ( xu ) , which is smooth and obtained by the following formula , ( 16 ) fp ( xu )= 1psumi = 1mln [ exp ( pfi ( xu ))+ exp ( - pfi ( xu ))] where p is called the maximum entropy factor .
based on [ 27 ] , the following properties of the entropy function fp ( xu ) are listed as follows .
theorem 1 .
for any estimated coordinate xu of unknown node , ( 1 ) when p - - >+ infinity , fp ( xu ) - - > f ( xu ) ; ( 2 ) for any p , f ( xu )<= fp ( xu )<= f ( xu )+( lnm )/ p. proof of theorem 1 .
( 1 ) given xu'inr2 , if there is a vector - valued function v ( xu ') with components vi ( xu ')= exp [ fi ( xu ')] , where 1 < i < m , then the lp - norm of v ( xu ') is .
( 17 ) || v ( xu ')|| p ={ sumi = 1m [ vi ( xu ')] p } 1 / p ={ sumi = 1mexp [ pfi ( xu ')]} 1 / p hence , fp ( xu ')= ln || v ( xu ')|| p. consequently , ( 18 ) limp - - > infinity || v ( xu ')|| p = max1 <= i <= mvi ( xu ')= exp [ f ( xu ')] that is limp - - > infinityfp ( xu ')= f ( xu ') .
( 2 ) with the properties of lp - norm , for xu'inr2 , fp ( xu ') is a monotonically decreasing function in terms of p , hence ( 19 ) 0 <= fp ( xu ') - f ( xu ')= ln || v ( xu ')|| p - ln [ expf ( xu ')]=( 1 / p ) lnsumi = 1mexp { p [ fi ( xu ') - f ( xu ')]}<=( 1 / p ) ln m the theorem mentioned above describes the relationship between entropy function fp ( xu ) and original function f ( xu ) when p changes .
fp ( xu ) converges to f ( xu ) point wisely on xu , as p tends to infinity .
theoretically , under the given conditions , as long as p is sufficiently large , the error between the optimal solution of f ( xu ) and the optimal solution of fp ( xu ) can be made arbitrarily small .
however in terms of numeral calculations , when p is fairly large , the value of entropy function fp ( xu ) is overflow .
therefore , in case of the overflow , equation ( 16 ) is transformed into the following modus .
( 20 ) fp ( xu )= sum1m | fi ( xu )|+ 1psum1mln [ 1 + exp ( - 2p | fi ( xu )|)] derivation steps as follows .
( 21 ) fp ( xu )= 1psum1mln [ epfi ( xu )+ e - pfi ( xu )]= sum1mln [ epfi ( xu )+ e - pfi ( xu )] 1p = sum1mln [ ep | fi ( xu )|( 1 + e - 2p | fi ( xu )|)] 1p = sum1m | fi ( xu )|+ 1psum1mln [ 1 + e - 2p | fi ( xu )|] hence , summarizing all results , the nodes localization problem can be described as formula ( 22 ) when p - - >+ infinity , ( 22 ) min fp ( xu )= min { sum1m | fi ( xu )|+ 1psum1mln [ 1 + exp ( - 2p | fi ( xu )|)]} where xu is the estimated unknown node coordinate in the localization , and p is called the maximum entropy factor. through minimizing the entropy function fp ( xu ) , the estimated coordinate of the unknown node can be regarded as the optimal estimated coordinate in localization .
5.2 .
mef - based localization process after removing the detected outliers , the mef - based method , which has good error tolerance and calculation accuracy , is used to estimate the locations of unknown nodes in this paper .
meanwhile , it can also rapidly converge to the global optimal value by only iterating twice or three times .
based on the above discussion , the following definition can be concluded about the localization process : definition 3 .
the entropy function fp ( xu ) is the overall approximation to the localization function f ( xu ) .
in the localization systems , by minimizing the entropy function fp ( xu ) and increasing p , the minimum f ( xu ) can be indirectly obtained under certain accuracy after several iterations .
thus the optimal estimated locations of unknown nodes are obtained .
the detailed procedures of the mef - based method for estimating the optimal locations of unknown nodes are presented in table 1 .
6. performance evaluation in this section , simulation results are presented and discussed .
for all of the simulations , the sensor nodes are uniformly distributed in a 150 m x 150 m square field .
we assume a fixed transmission range r = 30 m for both anchor nodes and unknown nodes .
the measured distance of the sensor nodes consists of two sections .
one is the real distance between two nodes and the other is the measurement error .
the measurement error obeys a gaussian distribution with the mean of 0 and the variance of 1 .
thus , the ranging error is set er ~ n ( 0,1 ) .
the distance outliers , which are the measured distance attacked or disturbed by external factors , can be described as d ''= d '( 1 + alpha ) , where d ' is the measured distance without attacks or disturbance , and alpha is the disturbed distance percentage .
in each simulation , the sensor nodes of the network are deployed 100 times to compute the average localization accuracy .
the default parameters of the simulation are shown in table 2 .
lms [ 22 ] and brsl [ 24 ] are used to compare with proposed localization method .
they are both aimed at solving the problem of locating the unknown nodes in the presence of outliers .
lms is an outlier tolerance method and brsl is an outlier detection and elimination method .
compared with these two different methods , the advantage of our method is revealed clearly in the simulations .
the average localization error ( ale ) using in the experiment is calculated as formula ( 23 ) .
( 23 ) ale = sumu = 1n ( xu ' - xu ) 2 +( yu ' - yu ) 2nr where n is the number of unknown nodes , r is the network communication radius .
in the initial localization phase , no matter the measured distance between an anchor node and unknown node or the declared anchor position is outlier , the detection result is the same .
hence , the scenarios in which distance outliers are only considered are simulated .
in the outlier detection phase of the simulation , based on the maximum entropy principle and fuzzy set theory , if the trust value of an anchor node is smaller than or equal to 0.5 , it can be determined that the corresponding measured distance is an outlier .
discard the outliers and only use the trustable data to estimate the locations of unknown nodes .
if the trustable data left are not enough to estimate the locations of unknown nodes , the information of the neighboring unknown nodes which have been located are used .
in this section , all simulations are executed in matlab .
6.1 .
impact of the number of distance outliers figure 3 shows the ale of our localization method and the compared methods under different numbers of distance outliers .
in this simulation , set alpha = 50 % and ranging error er ~ n ( 0,1 ) .
simulation results show that all the detected percent of distance outliers are almost equal to 100 %. with the increase of number of outliers , the ale of lms rises obviously , while that of mef and brsl remain stable , which declares that our localization is robust to the variation of distance outliers .
meanwhile , under the same numbers of distance outliers , our method can greatly improve the average localization accuracy than brsl .
6.2 .
impact of disturbed distance percentage figure 4 presents the ale of our localization method and the compared methods under different disturbed distance percentage .
in this simulation , set the number of distances outliers as 10 and ranging error er ~ n ( 0,1 ) .
in this case , the detected percent is increased to almost 100 % when alpha =+/ - 50 % .
as shown in figure 4 , no matter when alpha > 0 or alpha < 0 , the absolute difference | d '' - d '| increases with the rise of | alpha | .
in conclusion , the localization accuracy of our method decrease slowly under different disturbed distance percentages , which shows that our localization can effectively inhibit aggressive behaviors of malicious nodes and improve the localization accuracy of unknown nodes .
6.3 .
impact of the mean of ranging error figure 5 illustrates the performance of our method under different means of ranging error and disturbed distance percentages .
in this simulation , set the number of distances outliers as 10 .
because the distance outlier detection is based on the uncertain value of distance estimation , the detected percent of distance outliers is decreased with the increasing mean of ranging error when the variation in distance is small. from the figure 5 , the localization accuracy is increased with the decreasing detected percentand the increasing mean of ranging error in the curves of alpha = 30 % and alpha = 50 % .
thus , it can be concluded that when the difference between the distance outlier and estimated distance is small , our localization method is error - tolerant to the undetected distance outliers ; when the estimated distance is large , our localization method can detect the distance outliers .

impact of the standard deviationof ranging error figure 6 presents the performance of our localization method under different standard deviations of ranging errors and disturbed distance percentages .
in the simulations , also set the number of distance outliers as 10 .
compared with figure 5 , the standard deviation of ranging error has a larger impact on localization accuracy .
6.5 .
impact of the iteration step length note that mef - based algorithm contains a variable parameter , i.e. the iteration step length l , the value of which will affect the performance of the algorithm .
to this end , the simulation is applied to analyze the influence of step length value on algorithm performance and explain the rationality of the parameter value selection .
in this simulation , set the number of distances outliers to 10 , p = 10 , alpha = 50 % and ranging error er ~ n ( 0,1 ) .
figure 7 illustrates the change trend of the average localization error and average iteration times with l increases .
the increasement of iteration step length contributes to improve the efficiency of the localization .
however , on the contrary , it also results in the reduction of the localization accuracy .
in summary , the small value of l will reduce the efficiency of iteration .
meanwhile , the quite large value of l will decrease the localization accuracy .
it should be taken into consideration that the effect of value l to the localization accuracy and the localization efficiency , when deciding the appropriate value of l in the mef - based iteration method .
7. conclusions this paper develops an error - tolerant localization method against distance outliers and anchor outliers .
first , an outlier detection method is proposed based on the maximum entropy principle and fuzzy set theory. with the cooperation of the neighboring anchor nodes of unknown node , the outliers can be detected effectively .
in order to tolerate the undetected outliers and achieve high localization accuracy , mef method is used to estimate the locations of unknown nodes .
compared with the brsl method and lms method , simulation results show that our localization method has higher localization accuracy .

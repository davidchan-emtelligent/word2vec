risk factors in these patients include critical illness , mechanical ventilation , sedative medications and central venous catheter insertion [ 2 ] .
in cases where pharmacological prophylaxis is not feasible , inferior vena cava filters ( ivcf ) have been recommended [ 1 ] .
objectives evaluation of the indications , course and outcome for filter placement in the critically ill population .
methods we retrospectively reviewed charts of 95 patients who had an ivc filter placed between january 2011 and december 2014 at our institution .
we studied the indications for ivcf placement , hospital course , insertion / retrieval dates , contraindications to anticoagulation and the complications associated with the filter .
these patients were matched to their appropriate ivc filter guideline indications [ 4 ] , which were analysed .
results 53 of the 95 patients were admitted to icu with a median age of 47 ( 20 - 86 ) years. of the total icu population with placement , 37 ( 70 %) of the placements were therapeutic and 16 ( 30 %) were prophylactic .
in trauma patients ( n - 20 ) , 70 % of the ivc filters were placed as a prophylactic measure whereas in non - traumatic cases 94 % of ivc filters were placed for therapeutic indications .
venous access was mostly via the right internal jugular vein ( 91 %) and majority were placed infra - renal ( 96 %) .
16 ivc 's were retrieved after a median of 67 ( 21 - 185 ) days ; representing 30 % of the total and 41 % of the surviving patients .
no immediate procedural complications occurred during placement or retrieval ; 3 developed dvt and 1 patient developed pe after insertion. of the total population involved , 14 patients ( 26 %) died ( all being in the non - trauma subgroup ) .
8 patients were lost to follow up. conclusions our review shows that the ivcf practices at our institution are consistent with the accepted recommendations .
the vast majority of the patients had a contraindication to anticoagulation therapy .
the rate of immediate and delayed complications are low , however further follow up is required to assess the incidence of late complications .
all patients who died after placement of an ivc were non - trauma patients with serious co - morbidities , which should allow us to be more liberal in their use in trauma cases .

piloleiomyoma is an uncommon benign smooth muscle neoplasm arising from arrector pili muscle .
it is clinically defined by the presence of solitary or multiple reddish brown , dome - shaped , smooth papules or nodules , ranging in size from a few millimeters to a centimeter .
the patients are otherwise healthy ; but mental retardation developing in some patients with multiple piloleiomyomas has been emerging as an intriguing matter for analysis by the scientists .
in this case report , a mentally retarded patient with piloleiomyoma is described , who , besides the characteristic smooth and dome - shaped lesions on the anterolateral aspect of the dorsum of the right foot , had developed crusting on one of the largest lesions .
the histopathological features were consistent with piloleiomyoma .
the occurrence of piloleiomyoma in a mentally retarded child and its unusual crusted nature has been rarely reported .
the association between piloleiomyoma and mental retardation is further stressed in this case report .
crusting mental retardation piloleiomyoma introduction piloleiomyoma as the name suggests arises from arrectores pilorum muscle , which is a smooth muscle component of the pilosebaceous unit .
the primary lesion is multiple dome - shaped reddish brown nodules or a plaque with a smooth and shiny surface situated on the face , back or extremities .
secondary changes such as crusting or ulceration has been rarely seen .
multiple lesions may involve more than one part of the body .
sensitivity to cold or touch correlates well with the mechanism of goose flesh , brought about by the contraction of the arrector pili muscle .
case report a 17 - year - old male born of non consanguineous marriage presented with multiple nodules on the dorsum of the right foot , for two years .
there was history of spontaneous pain intermittently and also pain on exposure to cold and trauma .
the patient was mentally subnormal since childhood , as compared to others of his age .
on examination , there was a large swelling of 7cm x 5cm in size , present on the anterolateral aspect of the dorsum of the right foot .
four to five smaller nodules were present adjacent to it. the lesions were well defined , with a smooth surface and firm in consistency .
the larger lesion showed central crusting which had occurred , due to spontaneous rupture , two months previously .
swelling was not fixed to the underlying structure [ figure 1 ] .
no other skin or mucus membrane lesion was found .
there was no family history of similar lesions .
the patient was referred to the department of psychiatry for evaluation of mental intelligence .
applying the who criteria , he was diagnosed as having moderate mental retardation .
the diagnosis was done after assessment using the stanford binet and bhatia battery of intelligence tests , which showed his iq ( intelligence quotient ) levels to be 38 and 44 respectively .
his magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) showed all the structures within normal limits .
figure 1 multiple piloleiomyoma on the dorsum of the foot routine investigations were within normal limits .
excision biopsy of the lesion revealed interlacing bundles of smooth muscle fibers , with variable amounts of collagen bundles in the dermis .
muscle fibers were straight , without any waviness with central , elongated nuclei , and , thus , a histopathological diagnosis of piloleiomyoma was made [ figure 2 ] .
figure 2 histopathological picture ( h & e x40 ) the lesions were excised en masse , followed by split skin grafting .
during surgery , the lesions were found above the deep fascia and were easily separated from it. post operative recovery was uneventful .
discussion leiomyomas are benign soft tissue neoplasms that arise from smooth muscle and were first described by virchow in 1854 .
the onset is in the second or third decade of life .
they usually appear as reddish brown papulo - nodules .
patients may develop several hundred lesions .
piloleiomyomas are believed to arise from the arrector pili muscle of the pilosebaceous unit .
the arrector pili muscle , from which piloleiomyoma originates , attaches proximally to the hair follicle and distally to multiple attachment points within the papillary and reticular dermis , as well as to the basement membrane .
piloleiomyomas can plausibly emerge from each of these various points of insertion and occur as multiple tumors .
these tumors are painful on exposure to cold and trauma and pain could result from local pressure by the tumor on cutaneous nerves .
however , the histological findings do not show that prominent nerve fibers are associated with these tumors .
yet , some have suggested that muscle contraction may be pivotal in the induction of pain .
the excitation of the arrector pili muscle occurs via the sympathetic nervous system which secretes norepinephrine , by postganglionic nerve fibers , thus activating the alpha - receptors of the muscle .
subsequently , muscle contraction ensues , which is triggered by the influx of calcium ions .
understanding this basic physiologic process may be relevant to the medical treatment of symptomatic leiomyomas .
an association between multiple cutaneous leiomyomas and mental retardation was described by fryns et al. in 1985 , where they described chromosomal abnormality of 9p trisomy / 18p monosomy as a probable genetic basis of this association. [ 1 ] a genetic underpinning of leiomyoma has long been foreseen and the notion has been strengthened by identification of genetic loci , with a strong linkage to it. the most compelling evidence for its genetic basis comes from a recent identification of the mcul 1 locus on chromosome 1q 42.3 - 43 in 10 families that had multiple cutaneous leiomyomas and uterine fibroids ,[ 2 ] and by the identification of two pedigrees with a specific combination of renal cell carcinoma and uterine and cutaneous leiomyomas linked to the same loci .
our case brings up two issues to be discussed .
first is the co - occurrence of mental retardation with piloleiomyoma .
although mental retardation is often found with several neurocutaneous and tumor syndromes , its co - morbidity piloleiomyoma has been reported only a couple of times .
the latest report was of a huge leiomyoma in a woman with down 's syndrome. [ 3 ] our patient did not show any features suggestive of down 's or other syndromes .
this brings up the next important issue of an independent genetic basis of this co - morbidity .
in spite of the fact that chance factors can be easily stressed in view of such a few occurrences , a genetic basis cannot be ruled out , in view of the strong genetic associations reported with leiomyoma cases in general and , specifically , in conditions of its co - morbidity with mental retardation. [ 13 ] the limitation of facilities for a genetic workout inhibited us from establishing a genetic association in our case , which is seriously warranted in such cases and which weigh in favor of this association .
central crusting in piloleiomyoma itself is a rare occurrence which was reported earlier. [ 4 ] conclusion to conclude , it will be appropriate to state that any case with skin tumors should be thoroughly assessed for other tumors and neuropsychiatric abnormalities , and a genetic assessment should be carried out whenever possible , as it can lead to further unraveling of genetic underpinnings of these disorders .

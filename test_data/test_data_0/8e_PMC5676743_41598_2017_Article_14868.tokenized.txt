exogenous nutrient elements modulate the energetic metabolism responses that are prerequisites for cellular homeostasis and metabolic physiology .
although zinc is important in oxidative stress and cytoprotection processes , its role in the regulation of energetic metabolism remains largely unknown .
in this study , we found that zinc stimulated aspect in cell motility and was essential in restoring the ochratoxin a ( ota ) - induced energetic metabolism damage in hek293 cells .
moreover , using zinc supplementation and zinc deficiency models , we observed that zinc is conducive to mitochondrial pyruvate transport , oxidative phosphorylation , carbohydrate metabolism , lipid metabolism and ultimate energy metabolism in both normal and toxic - induced oxidative stress conditions in vitro , and it plays an important role in restoring impaired energetic metabolism .
this zinc - mediated energetic metabolism regulation could also be helpful for dna maintenance , cytoprotection and hereditary cancer traceability .
therefore , zinc can widely adjust energetic metabolism and is essential in restoring the impaired energetic metabolism of cellular physiology .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction emerging evidence from animal models has indicated a fundamental interplay between micronutrients and metabolic physiology with implications for health and disease1,2 .
an impaired energetic metabolism is often accompanied by a shortage of cellular energy supply and vice versa .
nutrient availability and stress stimuli are important factors that regulate cellular energy levels in response to pivotal changes in cellular homeostasis .
the disruption of this balance can potentially lead to a number of pathologies , including diabetes , cancer and cardiovascular disease3 .
cell motility is a fundamental phenomenon and has been implicated in a variety of biological processes , from morphogenesis , metastasis and the immune response to the development of pathologies such as cancer growth4 - 7 .
the cell motility of mechanical property changes also has an impact on many important biological behaviors of cells , including adhesion , division , differentiation and deformation .
controlled energy metabolism makes all of these behaviors feasible8 .
cells have evolved a highly integrated network of mechanisms to utilize micronutrient and to coordinate cellular energy metabolism , survival / death , proliferation , differentiation and repair with metabolic states9 .
zinc is an essential trace metal and acts as a cofactor for numerous enzymes and transcription factors that require it for various cellular functions10,11 .
it has been known for decades that zinc plays a key role in the regulation of the cellular secretory phenotype , cell cycle and apoptosis12 - 14 .
dietary consumption of zinc in humans is related to the levels of plasma glucose , tumor necrosis factors ( tnfs ) , interleukins ( ils ) , zinc transporters ( znts ) and metallothioneins ( mts ) , such zinc metabolism is related to certain disorders such as metabolic syndrome , diabetic complications and immunodeficiency syndrome11,15,16 .
zinc deficiency sensitizes cells to oxidative stress17 .
a number of articles have reported that appropriate zinc supplementation can attenuate toxin - induced toxicity and diseases14,18 - 20 , however , the intake of an inappropriate concentration of zinc is considered a risk factor for neurotoxicity and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response21 .
ochratoxin a ( ota ) has definite cytotoxicity and can cause mitochondrial damage and energy metabolism disturbance by increasing the mitochondrial membrane potential , disrupting the mitochondrial electron transport chain and perturbing the tca cycle22 - 24 , thereby , inhibiting the generation of atp25 .
moreover , because of impaired energy metabolism , ota can also lead to disorders of glucose metabolism , lipid metabolism and cell senescence in vivo and vitro 26 - 28 .
the bulk of cellular energy is mainly generated in the mitochondria , in the form of atp through oxidative phosphorylation ( oxphos ) and participation in essential cellular processes29,30 .
lon peptidase 1 ( lonp1 ) is a mitochondrial dna binding protein that is important for mtdna maintenance .
it is associated with the tricarboxylic acid cycle and plays a key role in metabolic reprogramming by remodeling oxphos complexes31,32 .
in eukaryotic cells , pyruvate is one of the most important metabolic factors ; its uptake can be controlled by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier ( mpc ) , and after uptake , it cannot be oxidized for efficient atp production33 .
mitochondrial biogenesis and glucose and fatty acid metabolism are regulated by peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 - a ( pgc1alpha ) 34 .
pgc1alpha acts as a protective molecule against ros generation and damage35 .
the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ( ppargamma ) is involved in the regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism36 .
amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk ) represents an energy sensor and metabolic regulator and responds to imbalances in metabolic homeostasis and nutrition status in vivo 37 .
the important role of ampk in the control of food intake is involved with acetyl - coa carboxylase ( acc ) , a substrate of ampk38 .
the enzymatic step following mitochondrial entry is the conversion of pyruvate to acc by the pyruvate dehydrogenase ( pdh ) complex , in which the phosphorylation of pdh is specifically regulated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase ( pdk ) , which controls the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and the homeostasis of carbohydrate fuels in mammals .
moreover , pdk activity has been shown to decrease in individuals consuming a diet39 .
however , the function of zinc in the cellular energy supply or restoring impaired energetic metabolism is largely unknown .
except for ppargamma , the relationship between zinc and its regulators remains unclear .
this study began by investigating the function of zinc in stimulated cell motility and motility speed in normal cell lines .
afterwards , energy metabolism pathways and impaired energetic metabolism models were introduced to show the function of zinc in the cellular energy supply .
materials and methods cell culture and treatment human embryonic kidney 293 cells ( hek293 ) were grown in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) supplemented with 10 % fbs ( hyclone , utah , usa ) , 100 u / ml penicillin , 100 mug / ml streptomycin , 250 ng / ml amphotericin b ( macgene , beijing , china ) at 37 degreesc in 5 % co2 and 95 % humidity. by the day of the experiment , the cells had usually proliferated to 70 - 80 % confluence .

subsequently , 10 mul of wst - 8 dye and 100 mul of pbs were added to each well .
the cells were then incubated at 37 degreesc for 1 h. the absorbance at 450 nm was determined using a microplate reader ( thermo , massachusetts , usa ) .
phase holographic imaging cells were seeded in a 6 - well plate at 37 degreesc in 5 % co2 , 95 % humidity and shielded from light .
the holomonitortm m3 digital holographic microscope ( phase holographic imaging ab , lund , sweden ) records 3d information of cells using the hologram x 20 lens , and interfering wave fronts were induced by the exposure to a 0.8 mw hene laser ( 633 nm ) .
the hologram can be displayed showing either the phase or amplitude information of the light wave .
the motility refers to how far the cells have moved from their starting point at the beginning of the analysis until the current time point .
the motility speed is the total cell movement per hour .
the migration is the shortest distance between the starting point of the cell analysis and the current point .
image were analyzed in the holostudiotm software , according to the instrument manual .
atp concentration detection cells were seeded in a 6 - well plate at 37 degreesc in 5 % co2 , 95 % humidity and shielded from light .
after treatment , the atp assay kit ( beyotime , beijing , china ) and glomax ( r ) 96 microplate luminometer ( promega , wisconsin , usa ) were used in the atp concentration detection .
sod activity assay the cells were lysed with 300 mul lysis buffer on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm and 4 degreesc for 10 min .
the supernatants were used to measure the sod activity using an sod kit ( jiancheng bioengineering institute , namjing , china ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
protein extraction and measurement after harvest and washing with ice - cold pbs , cells were dissolved in ripa buffer pmsf ( 150 mm sodium chloride , 1.0 % triton x - 100 , 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0.1 % sds , 50 mm tris , protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture ( beyotime , beijing , china )) .
the cells were transferred to a 1 ml syringe and were then homogenized .
the resulting cellular lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 degreesc .
the supernatant proteins were collected and quantified using the bca protein assay kit ( beyotime , beijing , china ) .
western blot analysis extracted protein from each sample were loaded onto 12.5 % tricine - sds - page gels , transferred to a pvdf membrane ( millipore , massachusetts , usa ) , blocked in 5 % ( wt / vol ) skim milk in tbst ( 0.02 m tris base , 0.14 m nacl , 0.1 % tween 20 , ph 7.4 ) , and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 degreesc before being incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with hrp .
the following primary antibodies were used : rabbit acetyl - coa carboxylase antibody (# 3662 , cst , massachusetts , usa , 1:1000 ) , rabbit ampkalpha antibody (# 2532 , cst , usa , 1:2000 ) , rabbit phosphoinositide - dependent kinase 1 ( pdk1 ) antibody (# 3062 , cst , usa , 1:1000 ) , rabbit mpc1 antibody (# 14462 , cst , usa , 1:2000 ) , rabbit mpc2 antibody (# 46141 , cst , usa , 1:1000 ) , rabbit phospho - acetyl - coa carboxylase ( ser79 ) antibody (# 3661 , cst , usa , 1:1000 ) , rabbit phospho - ampkalpha ( thr172 ) antibody (# 2535 , cst , usa , 1:1000 ) , rabbit lonp1 antibody ( 15440 , proteintech , usa , 1:1000 ) , rabbit pgc1alpha antibody ( ab54481 , abcam , cambridge , usa , 1:1000 ) , rabbit ppargamma antibody (# 2443 , cst , usa , 1:1000 ) , mouse total oxphos rodent wb antibody cocktail ( ab110413 , abcam , usa , 1:1000 ) , and rabbit beta - actin antibody ( aa128 , beyotime , china , 1:1000 ) .
the restore plus western blot stripping buffer ( thermo , massachusetts , usa ) and the super signal west pico chemiluminescent substrate ( sagecreation , beijing , china ) were used for coloration of proteins .
the total gray values of each band were digitized using bandscan v4.3 .
the relative expression level of each protein was normalized to a reference protein , and the resulting ratios in the control group were normalized to 1 .
statistical analysis all data are shown as averages +/ - standard deviation of the three single experiments .
in the phase holographic imaging assays , at least 12 cells per treatment were used for the calculation .
the data from the different treatments were subjected to a one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) , and the means were compared using duncan 's multiple range test .
the differences were considered significant for p - values less than 0.05 .
results zinc improved the motion performance of hek293 cells to address the influence of zinc in cell morphology and motility , 3d holographic imaging records of an unfixed object in real time were used , based on interfering wave fronts from a laser ( fig. 1a ) .
dynamic changes in the cells were recorded as well ( video. 1 ) .
compared to the control groups , zinc improved the motion distance ( fig. 1b ) .
quantitative analyses of the cell moving distance shows that in both normal and toxic cellular environments , 24 h 50 mum zinc supplementation improved cell motility by approximately 1.5 times in hek293 cells ( fig. 1c ) .
in addition , the cell migration and cellular displacement also showed that zinc benefits cell motility ( fig. 1d ) .
while different cell lines grew with adherence , ota could lead to cellular apoptosis40 .
the suspending death cells had increased motility , and this dynamic increase in cell motility was constitutionally distinguished with zinc in migration improvements .
we observed that ota could lead to the changing morphology of adherent cells , from a distended flattened appearance with stretching ability to a fully rounded shape with occasional surface blebs , suggesting a loss of cytoskeletal integrity or even autocytolysis ( fig. 1e ) .
zinc supplementation maintained an adherent morphology in the presence of 25 mum ota for 24 h ( fig. 1e and g ) .
it is noteworthy that zinc also can speed up hek293 cells movement from 8 mum / h to 16 mum / h ( fig. 1f ) , but this was not significant in ota - induced stress situation .
figure 1 the motion performance of zinc supplementation in hek293 cells in normal and toxic environments .
( a ) the holographic imaging records , based on interfering wave fronts from a laser of hek - 293 cells ( 2 x 105 ) , plated in culture media containing 10 % fbs , 100 u / ml penicillin , 100 mug / ml streptomycin , 250 ng / ml amphotericin ( b ) , 2 mm l - glutamine , and 1 % mem nonessential amino acids .
cells were treated with 50 mum znso4 ( group zn ) , 25 mum ota ( group ota ) , 50 mum znso4 and 25 mum ota ( group ota + zn ) , or serum - free medium as a control ( group c ) for 24 h. the motion performance of ( b ) the motion distance , ( c ) the cell motility , ( d ) the cell migration , ( e ) the cell volume changes , ( f ) the motility speed and ( g ) the cell area changes were analyzed using the holostudiotm software .
in ( e,g ) , the x axis represents the time variable .
the values in each set are counted of twelve independent data points .
the data were analyzed using one - way anova .
"*" indicates a significant difference compared with the control group p < 0.05 , "**" indicates p < 0.01 , "***" means p < 0.005 .
moderate zinc supplementation maintains cell viability and superoxide dismutase ( sod ) activity of note , supraphysiological concentrations of tpen are cytotoxic , but appropriate concentrations were suggested for an evaluation model that is sufficient to induce zinc deprivation , but not sacrifice cell viability41,42 .
ota has a half maximal inhibitory concentration ( ic50 ) of 25 mum and leads cellular dna damage , cell cycle arrest and apoptosis .
it is regarded as a toxic stress manifestation model26,43 .
here , we confirmed this relationship among biologically effective doses for the performance .
the apoptotic bodies were significantly decreased by zinc supplement in an ota - induced toxic environment ( fig. 2a ) .
the quantitative relationship with cck - 8 showed that 25 mum ota reduced the cell viability to 48 % .
in addition , consistent with previous reports , 50 mum znso4 had little effect on cell viability and morphological changes44 - 48 .
but notably , 50 mum zinc supplement in the ota + zn groups improved 20 % of the cell viability compared with the ota groups ( fig. 2b ) .
this result showed that moderate zinc supplementation can maintain cell viability .
in addition , the sod activity was captured ( fig. 2c ) .
under an exposure time of ota treatment for 6 h , the sod activity was increased by zinc supplementation and decreased following zinc chelation .
over 24 h , this trend became clear .
chelated zinc in an ota - induced toxic environment caused the sod activity to drop to 58 % of the control group .
figure 2 zinc contributes to the restoration of cell viability , sod and atp activity in toxic environments .

( c ) the sod activity of the treated cells in a 6 - well plate were measured after 6 h and 24 h .
( d ) the atp concentration of the treated cells were measured after 24 h , by using a microplate luminometer .
all the data were expressed as a percentage of the control .
the data are presented as the means +/ - sd of three independent experiments .
the data were analyzed using one - way anova .
different characters indicate significant differences between the compared groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
ota - induced energy metabolism impairment was relieved by zinc but worsened with zinc chelation after exposure for 24 h , the atp concentrations in both the ota and tpen groups were decreased by 50 % ( fig. 2d ) .
zinc supplement increased to 30 % of the atp concentration relative to zinc chelated under ota exposure conditions .
furthermore , a group of regulators involved with energy metabolism were investigated under the ota - induced toxicant environment ( fig. 3a ) .
pgc1alpha is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and regulates energy metabolism49 .
lonp1 is an atp - dependent serine protease in the mitochondrial matrix50 .
in adversity , relative to the ota and zinc chelation groups , zinc promotes the up - regulation of pgc1alpha by 1.6 times and 2.2 times ; the upregulation of lonp1 by 1.3 times and 3.0 times ( fig. 3b and c ) .
pdk1 and ppargamma are also essential in energy homeostasis and stress response51,52 .
although zinc supplementation showed limited proactive roles in stimulating pdk1 activation in normal conditions , under the ota - induced pdk1 inhibition , zinc supplementation kept the expression of pdk1 at a high level , almost 3 times more than in the zinc chelated groups ( fig. 3d ) .
the expression of ppargamma was not sensitive to additional zinc supplementation , but zinc chelation by 5 mum tpen downregulated ppargamma by more than 50 % compared to the ota treatment group ( fig. 3e ) .
figure 3 zinc functions to restore impaired energetic metabolism pathways .
( a ) the expression levels of energy metabolism - associated proteins were detected by western blotting .
the expression levels of ( b ) pgc1alpha , ( c ) lonp1 , ( d ) pdk1 and ( e ) ppargamma were normalized to beta - actin expression .
( f ) the expression of the mpc1 : mpc2 ratio .
( g ) the expression levels of mpc1 were normalized to the beta - actin expression levels .
the values are expressed as the means +/ - sd of three independent experiments .
the data were analyzed using one - way anova .
different characters indicate significant differences between the compared groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
mpc complexes and pyruvate transport were regulated by zinc supplementation mpc activation could obviously improve the tca cycle and energy provision .
mpc1 and mpc2 are required for formation of the functional mpc complex and effectual pyruvate transport .
the mpc1 : mpc2 ratio is an effective indicators used to evaluate the function of mpc complexes , beyond just assessing decreased intact mpc complexes and pyruvate transport33 .
here , we observed that in the normal environment , zinc supplements could improve the mpc1 : mpc2 ratio 1.8 times more than the control ( fig. 3f ) .
this changes was dependent on the up - regulated expression of mpc1 ( fig. 3g ) .
zinc deficiency did not contribute to changes in pyruvate transport .
however , in the ota - induced toxic environment , the expression of mpc2 played a key role ( fig. 3f ) , which increased in ota treatment and was strengthened in zinc deficiency , such the corresponding mpc1 : mpc2 ratio decreased .
zinc remodeling of oxphos complexes occurs primarily around sdhb and ndufb8 in toxic stress oxidative phosphorylation ( oxphos ) is an essential process for most atp generation .
here , four members of the oxphos complexes , the alpha subunit of f - 1 - atp synthase ( atp5a ) , the ubiquinol - cytochrome - c reductase core protein 2 ( uqcrc2 ) , the succinate dehydrogenase b ( sdhb ) and the nadh dehydrogenase ( ubiquinone ) i beta subcomplex 8 ( ndufb8 ) were investigated to show the function of zinc on oxphos ( fig. 4a ) .
in our results , the expression of atp5a was not sensitive to the addition of a zinc supplement or to zinc deficiency ( fig. 4b ) .
uqcrc2 is a component of the ubiquinol - cytochrome c reductase complex and is associated with the mitochondrial respiratory complexes and atp generation capacity53 .
zinc supplementation led to a 1.3 times up - regulation of uqcrc2 compared to the control .
in general , the expression of uqcrc2 was not sensitive to the concentration of zinc in either normal or toxic stress conditions ( fig. 4b ) .
however , zinc played obvious and key roles in the sdhb and ndufb8 of oxphos .
in normal conditions , zinc supplementation led to a 1.2 times up - regulation of the expression of ndufb8 .
to show the expression of sdhb and ndufb8 in zinc deficiency , tpen were treated and both regulators were shown to be down - regulated by 1.3 times ( fig. 4b ). of note , in the ota - induced groups this trend was amplified .
ota induced a 3.5 times and 7.1 times down - regulation in the expression of sdhb and ndufb8 , respectively .
interestingly , chelated zinc by tpen induced a further 4.2 times and 7.6 times down - regulation in the expression of sdhb and ndufb8 , respectively , compared to ota alone .
in contrary , zinc supplementation promoted sdhb and ndufb8 expression to 2.4 times and 8.2 times the levels under ota conditions ( fig. 4b ) .
to our knowledge , this is the first study indicating an important role for zinc in sdhb and ndufb8 regulation .
figure 4 zinc remodeling impaired oxphos complexes and is essential in stabilizing ampk phosphorylation .
( a ) the expression of oxphos complex proteins was detected by western blotting .
( b ) the relative quantity of oxphos complex proteins was normalized to the beta - actin expression .
( c ) the phosphorylation degree of ampk in thr172 and acc in ser79 was detected by western blotting .
( d ) the phosphorylation degree of ampk in thr172 was normalized to ampk expression .
( e ) the phosphorylation degree of acc in ser79 was normalized to acc expression .
the values are expressed as the means +/ - sd of three independent experiments .
the data were analyzed using one - way anova .
"*" indicates a significant difference compared with the control group p < 0.05 , "**" indicates p < 0.01 , "***" means p < 0.005 .
different characters indicate significant differences between the compared groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
zinc is essential in stabilizing the homeostasis of the ampk pathway ampk is activated by thr172 phosphorylation37 .
as a substrate of ampk , phosphorylation of acc in ser79 was up - regulated 1.8 times and 1.6 times by tpen in normal or toxic conditions ( fig. 4c and d ) .
accordingly , the thr172 phosphorylation of ampk was up - regulated 2.5 times and 1.3 times by tpen in normal or toxic conditions , respectively ( fig. 4c and e ) .
discussion ota can inhibit the metabolism of energy by regulating the krebs cycle , glycometabolism , arginine and proline metabolism , cysteine and methionine metabolism , and inhibiting the ppar signaling pathway , resulting in metabolic disturbances27,54 .
the connection between zinc homeostasis and ota toxicity in the intestinal epithelium has previously been reported55 .
ota exposure can modulate the expression of zinc transporters znt and zip , especially znt155 , and reduce the zinc content in the cell total protein56 .
besides , ota - induced oxidative stress can regulate the expression of mts55 , which is an important ligand form of cellular zinc , and the zinc - mts complex was an effective chaperone and donor for delivery and uptake of zinc by mitochondria57 .
besides , the ota treatment in zinc depleted cells reflects a mechanism that maintains intracellular zinc homeostasis and may lead to profound changes in zinc dependent energy metabolism impairment .
oxphos is a metabolic pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients , thereby releasing energy that is in turn used to reform atp .
the nadh dehydrogenase complex is essential in the oxidative phosphorylation process .
here , we first show that the restorative function of zinc is high relative to the expression of ndufb8 .
ndufb8 is mediated by the overexpression of zinc - associated mitochondrial superoxide dismutase58 and is considered to be an important regulator of the zinc - mediated restoration of mitochondrial homeostasis .
uqcrc2 is including in oxidative phosphorylation and cellular energy metabolism promotion .
interestingly , uqcrc2 is known to be correlated with male fertility via spermatogenesis59,60 .
in sperm , it is generally accepted that zinc is an essential trace element for the maintenance of sperm functions , the progression of spermatogenesis and the regulation of sperm motility , tpen treatment of sperm suppresses the rate and duration of their motility61,62 .
in the present study , the capacity of zinc in cell motility improvement was seen not only in sperm but also in cell motility regulation in general cell types .
succinate dehydrogenase subunit b ( sdhb ) participates in both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain to promote energy metabolism63 .
sdhb loss - of - function mutations lead to mitochondrial enzyme sdh dysfunction , tgf - beta signaling activation , and inflammation and are associated with tumor formation64 .
sdh - deficient tumors are believed to have a strong syndromic and hereditary basis and distinct natural history65 .
currently , sdh - deficient renal carcinoma66 , pituitary carcinoma67 and nasopharyngeal carcinoma68 are being discovered and classified .
here , given the strong regulation of zinc , we speculate that the hereditary nature of sdh - deficient tumors is relative to the long - term zinc deficiency of evolutionary history and that dietary zinc supplementation is one possible way to prevent or even treat sdh - deficient carcinomas .
lonp1 also plays a key role in metabolic reprogramming by remodeling oxphos complexes and protecting against senescence31 .
lonp1 is also a mitochondrial dna binding protein that is important for mtdna maintenance and is associated with the tricarboxylic acid cycle by degrading the oxidized aconitase32 .
to our knowledge , no previous researches has determined the relationship between zinc and lonp1 .
lonp1 can be down - regulated by ota69 , and both lonp1 and zinc provide cytoprotection against oxidative stress32 .
here , zinc supplementation has promoted lonp1 expression in both normal and toxic environments .
in addition , the dose - response relationship between zinc and lonp1 provokes the cytoprotection of zinc in dna methylation and epigenetic modifications70 could be achieved through lonp1 .
furthermore , lonp1 deficiency induced insufficient energy supply , dna instability , senescence or even apoptosis31,32 can be alleviated by zinc supplementation .
the mitochondrial import of pyruvate by the mpc is a key component of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier which links cytosolic and mitochondrial intermediary metabolism71,72 .
mpc deficiency causes reduced contribution of glucose - derived pyruvate to the tca cycle , diminishing tca cycle intermediates , energy deficit and a perturbed balance of neurotransmitters73 .
zinc is closely linked with neurotransmitters74 and has an effective role in preventing adverse outcomes of pregnancy and reducing the risk of reproduction disease in human and mammal75,76 .
in the present study , we therefore suspected that zinc - associated physiological protection could be involved with mpc , which activates the uptake of pyruvate , thus regulating the metabolic state necessary for embryonic development , neurotransmitter balance and post - natal survival73 .
moreover , zinc deprivation tends to decrease mitochondrial pyruvate uptake and utilization , especially in adverse situations .
the reduced mpc activity is an important aspect of cancer metabolism .
typically , cancer cells appear to select against mpc expression33 , because altered mpc1 / mpc2 expression or activity may result in significant metabolic disorders and contribute to an increase in aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells ( a.k.a. , the warburg effect ) 77 , so that increased mpc activity may decrease cancer proliferation78 .
although the enhancement of cell motility could be relative to cancer proliferation , the zinc - induced increase in mpc activity seems to not agree with this point .
this may be because cell motility and proliferation occur through different biological processes .
pdk1 is necessary for the complete and stable activation of protein kinase c ( pkc ) , which is involved in the regulation of cell polarization , directional sensing , cell migration and particularly cell motility79 - 81 .
faced with toxicity - induced stress , we showed that zinc supplementation promoted cellular anti - adversity , motility and pdk1 expression .
considering that pdk1 activation is essential in the central control of energy homeostasis and stress response through the phosphatidylinositol - 3 kinase ( pi3k ) signaling pathway51,82 , pdk1 was regarded to be a major site for zinc in restoring the impaired energetic metabolism .
except for the activity index of normal cells or sperms , cell motility is also an important parameter used in the study of cancer metastasis83 .
here , we confirmed that zinc can restore impaired energetic metabolism of cells under toxic stress , but this is a double - edged sword because zinc does not play active roles in acquired cancer therapy .
this could be because zinc can upregulate the expression of the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) kinase , which is a master regulator of protein synthesis that couples nutrient sensing to cell growth and cancer84,85 .
zinc is also helpful to vessels and aids in the resistance to vascular diseases86 , which is believed to be good news for tumor proliferation .
furthermore , the results of a phase iii double - blind , placebo - controlled trial did not show that zinc sulfate could prevent taste alterations in cancer patients who were undergoing radiotherapy of the oral pharynx87 .
regardless , dietary deficiencies in zinc absolutely contribute to single - and double - stranded dna breaks and oxidative modifications to dna that increase the risk for cancer development88 .
the energy sensor ampk acts as a regulator of energy balance at both the cellular and the whole - body levels by stimulating atp - generating pathways and inhibiting atp - consuming anabolic pathways89 .
the overall metabolic consequence of ampk activity is the maintenance of energy levels under atp - limiting conditions90 .
in this regard , ampk is highly sensitive to amp , as any increase in the amp / atp ratio due to a decrease in the cellular energy state , stimulates ampk activity91 .
activated ampk stimulates glucose uptake and lipid oxidation in peripheral tissues92 and plays an important role in maintaining the energy balance of eukaryotes , where ampk activity can be regulated by a wide array of factors93 .
a decrease in cellular atp and a concomitant increase in amp levels triggers the phosphorylation - dependent activation of ampk at thr - 17294 .
pgc1alpha is a transcriptional coactivator , the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis that regulates energy metabolism and linking environmental stimulus to adaptive thermogenesis49,95 .
although it is not physiologically stimulated by zinc under normal conditions , in the conditions of oxidative stress or adverse environments , zinc makes a considerable degree of callback in the expression of pgc1alpha .
considering that pgc1alpha has been proposed to be responsible for muscle fiber type determination and beta - aminoisobutyric acid secretion by exercising muscles96,97 , it is not surprising that zinc supplementation not only reinforced energetic metabolism but also relieved some of the pressure for the oxidative stress .
zinc participates in the cellular energetic metabolism enhancement pathways of hek293 cells in both normal and toxin - induced conditions .
its roles are summarized in fig. 5. first , zinc is conducive to mitochondrial pyruvate transport .
second , especially since uqcrc2 and sdhb in oxidative phosphorylation are sensitive to zinc in both normal and toxic environments , it directly promotes energetic metabolism .
third , the promotion of energetic metabolism and pdk1 could be an important aspect of zinc - mediated cell motility improvement8 .
fourth , in the opposite case , zinc chelation suppresses atp content , pyruvate transport , ampk - , pgc1alpha - and ppargamma - mediated energy metabolism and homeostasis , thus aggravating the impaired energetic metabolism .
our results suggest that zinc can improve the cell motility and energy metabolism of normal cells in vitro and restore the expression of lonp1 , pgc1alpha , pdk1 , uqcrc2 and sdhb in toxin impaired energetic metabolism .
our results also suggest that the hereditary characteristics of sdh - deficient tumors could be relative to long - term zinc deficiency , and dietary zinc supplementation is a possible way to prevent sdh - deficient carcinoma .
figure 5 model for how zinc participates in energy metabolism pathways in both normal and ota - induced adversity conditions .
( a ) in the normal condition , zinc is conducive to mitochondrial pyruvate transport , uqcrc2 and ndufb8 - related oxidative phosphorylation , cell motility and lonp1 - related energy metabolism regulation .
zinc chelation suppress atp contents , ampk activation , oxidative phosphorylation , pgc1alpha - , ppargamma - mediated energy metabolism , thus having adverse effects on energetic metabolism .
( b ) in toxin - induced adversity , zinc is helpful to restore the impaired energetic metabolism by the expression of lonp1 , pgc1alpha , pdk1 , ndufb8 , uqcrc2 , and sdhb .
in addition to cell motility , protection and dna maintenance could also be reinforced .
in addition , zinc deficiency could be related to the development of sdh - deficient carcinoma through the regulator sdhb and mpc complexes64,65,77 .

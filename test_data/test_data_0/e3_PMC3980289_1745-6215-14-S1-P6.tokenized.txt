this has also led to the development of new statistical methods that are especially designed for making causal inferences from non - randomised exposures under transparent , less restrictive and more plausible assumptions .
i will provide an overview of common research questions in trials of complex interventions ( psychological therapies ) that target causal effects other than the effects of random treatment offers and are not easily assessed using standard methods .
a pertinent example where the effects of non - randomised exposures are of interest is the investigation of treatment effect modification by post - treatment characteristics of therapy such as therapeutic alliance .
a second example relates to mechanism investigations in trials of complex interventions .
the active components of a complex intervention typically target intermediate process variables in order to improve clinical outcome .
thus it is of interest to investigate empirically whether treatment effect mediation does indeed take place .
i will show that such research questions require careful statistical design and analysis to enable consistent estimation of causal parameters of interest .
in particular , statistical methods not typically used in routine analysis of clinical trials outcomes , such as instrumental variables methods , can be helpful in addressing further research questions posed by complex interventions .
i intend to make the case that causal inference techniques have a lot to offer trials research in complex interventions .

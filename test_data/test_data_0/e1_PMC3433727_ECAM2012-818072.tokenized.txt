testosterone replacement is the choice of treatment in androgen - deficient osteoporosis .
however , long - term use of testosterone is potentially carcinogenic .
eurycoma longifolia ( el ) has been reported to enhance testosterone level and prevent bone calcium loss but there is a paucity of research regarding its effect on the bone structural parameters .
this study was conducted to explore the bone structural changes following el treatment in normal and androgen - deficient osteoporosis rat model .
thirty - six male sprague - dawley rats aged 12 months were divided into normal control , normal rat supplemented with el , sham - operated , orchidectomised - control , orchidectomised with testosterone replacement , and orchidectomised with el supplementation groups .
testosterone serum was measured both before and after the completion of the treatment .
after 6 weeks of the treatment , the femora were processed for bone histomorphometry .
testosterone replacement was able to raise the testosterone level and restore the bone volume of orchidectomised rats .
el supplementation failed to emulate both these testosterone actions .
the inability of el to do so may be related to the absence of testes in the androgen deficient osteoporosis model for el to stimulate testosterone production .
1. introduction hormonal replacement therapy with testosterone is the choice of treatment for hypogonadism in men [ 1 - 3 ] .
it is well documented that testosterone therapy improves bone mineral density ( bmd ) and promote patient compliance in such cases [ 1 , 4 ] .
however , long - term use of testosterone is potentially carcinogenic [ 1 , 5 ] and commonly causes secondary osteoporosis [ 6 ] .
a suitable substitute for testosterone is needed , but there is paucity in studies discovering new alternative for the treatment of osteoporosis secondary to hypogonadism .
several studies have shown androgen - like or testosterone - enhancing effects of eurycoma longifolia ( el ) .
these were evident in animal studies where el has increased the copulatory activity , levator ani muscle activity , initiation of sexual performance and spermatogenesis [ 7 - 13 ] .
research studies on human subjects suffering from late - onset hypogonadism have shown that el improved the patient 's symptoms as well as the concentration of the testosterone serum [ 14 ] .
these experimental outcomes revealed the potential of el as a natural substitute to testosterone .
el ( simaroubaceae family ) is a traditional medical plant , known locally in malaysia as tongkat ali , tung saw in thailand , pasak bumi in indonesia , and cay ba bihn in vietnam [ 15 ] .
the root has been proven to have medicinal values , which is rich in various bioactive compounds ( eurycomaoside , eurycolactone , eurycomalactone , eurycomanone , and pasak bumi - b ) , among which the alkaloids and quassinoids form a major portion [ 15 , 16 ] .
the standardized water soluble extract of el has also exhibited antimalarial properties and anticancer effects [ 17 - 19 ] .
a recent study showed that el can prevent bone calcium loss in orchidectomised rats ( osteoporotic animal model ) and has the potential as an alternative treatment for androgen - deficient osteoporosis [ 20 ] .
this beneficial effects on bone may have been contributed by its testosterone - enhancing effects .
to date , there has been no published report regarding the effect of el on the bone structural parameters. with the current scenario that el is taken by normal individual as a health supplement , the first part of the study was conducted to determine the effects of el on the testosterone level and bone structure of normal male rat .
the second part of the study was carried out to determine the effects of el on the bone structural changes and testosterone level of androgen - deficient osteoporosis rat model .
2. material and methods thirty - six male sprague - dawley rats aged 12 months and weighing 370 - 500 g were used for the studies .
for the first part of the study , twelve rats were divided into two groups ; normal control ( nc ) and normal and supplemented with el ( el ) groups .
for the second part of the study , the rest of the rats were divided into sham - operated ( sham ) , orchidectomised - control ( orxc ) , orchidectomised and given testosterone replacement ( orx + t ) and orchidectomised and supplemented with el ( orx + el ) groups .
before the start of the study , the rats were allowed to adjust to the new environment at least for a week .
two rats were placed in each plastic cage at 29 +/ - 3degreesc under natural day / night cycle and were fed with commercial rat chow and tap water ad libitum .
the study was approved by the ukm animal ethics committee ( pp / far / 2008 / nazrun / 13 - feb / 217 - feb - 2008 - feb - 2010 ) .
the body weights of the rats were measured and recorded weekly .
the rats in the first part of the study were not subjected to any surgical procedures .
in the second part of the study , aged orchidectomised rats were used as the model for androgen - deficient osteoporosis [ 21 ] .
the rats were anesthetised with ketapex : xylazil ( 1 : 1 ) and scrotal approach was used to access the testis for orchidectomy [ 22 ] .
a small incision 2 mm was made at the tip of the scrotum .
the tunic was opened and the testis , cauda epididymis , vas deferens , and the spermatic blood vessels were exteriorized .
the blood vessels and vas deferens were then ligated with 4 - 0 absorbable suture .
the testis and epididymis were then removed .
the remaining tissue was returned into the sac .
the procedure was repeated for the other testis .
the skin incision was closed with a nonabsorbable suture .
the rats were monitored closely to avoid postsurgical complications especially chewing of the sutures and infections [ 22 ] .
el aqueous extract was supplied by phytes biotek sdn. bhd .
( malaysia ) .
it was extracted from the root of the plant using a patented high - pressure water extraction ( us patent no : us7 , 132 , 117 b2 ) .
the extract was in brownish powder form and contained bioactive 22.0 % eurypeptide , 41.1 % glycosaponin , and 1.6 % eurycomanone .
el aqueous extract powder was dissolved in normal saline .
it was given to the rats through oral gavages at the dose of 15 mg / kg rat weight daily at 9 am for 6 weeks [ 11 ] .
testosterone was purchased from tci uk ltd ( uk ) .
it was diluted in olive oil ( bertolli , italy ) , and 8 mg / kg was injected intramuscularly once daily at 9 am for 6 weeks [ 23 ] .
blood samples were collected before and after 6 weeks of treatment for measurements of testosterone serum level .
blood samples were obtained from the retroorbital vein after anesthetising the rats with ether .
after 3 hours , the blood was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes and the serum was stored at a temperature of - 70degreesc .
after the completion of the treatment , the rats were euthanized and the femora were dissected out .
2.1 .
bone histomorphometry bone histomorphometry is a quantitative examination of an undecalcified bone .
the bone structural changes were measured using bone histomorphometric analysis according to the american society of bone mineral research histomorphometry nomenclature committee 1987 [ 24 - 26 ] .
the undecalcified left femurs were embedded in methyl methacrylate ( osteo - bed bone embedding kit ; polysciences , usa ) .
the femora were sectioned at 9 mm thickness using a microtome ( leica rm2155 , wetzlar , germany ) .
the slides were stained using a modified von kossa method ( von kossa , 1974 ) and analyzed under nikon eclipse 80i microscope ( nikon instrument inc. , usa ) with an image analyzer software pro - plus v .
5.0 ( media cybernetics , silver spring , md , usa ) .
measurements at the metaphyseal region were performed for the structural bone histomorphometry .
it is located at 3 - 7 mm from the lowest point of the growth plate and 1 mm from the lateral cortex , excluding the endocortical region [ 27 ] .
the structural parameters measured were trabecular volume ( bv / tv ) , thickness ( tbth ) , number ( tbn ) , and separation ( tbsp ) .
2.2 .
statistical analysis the results were expressed as mean +/ - standard error of mean ( sem ) .
data analysis was performed using statistical package for social sciences software ( ibm spss statistics v20 ) .
data was tested for normality using the test of homogeneity of variances .
one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) followed by post hoc tukey test was used to test the data for significance .
3. results at the end of the study , there was no significant difference in the mean body weights of the different groups throughout the study ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
before the treatment , there was no significant difference in the testosterone serum levels for all the groups .
at the end of the 6 weeks of treatment , in the first part of the study , the testosterone level of the el group was not significantly different from the nc group ( figure 3 ) .
in the second part of the study , the testosterone levels of the orxc and orx + el groups were significantly lower than the sham group ( figure 4 ) .
testosterone replacement was found to elevate the testosterone level of the orx + t group significantly higher than the orxc and orx + el groups ( figure 4 ) .
the bone structural parameters ( bv / tv , tbth , tbn and tbsp ) were evaluated using bone histomorphometry technique .
in the first part of the study , there were no significant differences in the bv / tv , tbth , tbn , and tbsp between the nc and el group ( figures 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 ) .
while for the second part of the study , orchidectomy has resulted in significantly lower bv / tv of the orxc group compared to the sham group .
when the orchidectomised rats were given testosterone ( orx + t group ) , the bv / tv was restored equal to that of the sham group .
however , when the orchidectomised rats were supplemented with el ( orx + el ) , the bv / tv remained unchanged and was significantly lower than the orx + t group ( figure 9 ) .
there were no significant differences in the tbth , tbn , and tbsp parameters between the different treatment groups ( figures 10 , 11 , and 12 ) .
4. discussion in the past , neither alternative medicinal therapy received recognition in general nor herbal medicines accepted by pharmacological societies due to various reasons .
until recently , the effects of herbal products have not been standardised experimentally , and active compounds have not been isolated meticulously leading to gross dilution of the importance of alternative medicine .
several herbal - based products have shown therapeutic potentials in certain diseases such as malaria , cancer , and many others [ 17 - 19 ] .
recently , it has been reported that el may prevent bone calcium loss in orchidectomised rats and has been shown as potential alternative or complimentary therapy for androgen - deficient osteoporosis [ 20 ] .
el has also shown the ability to activate 17 alpha - hydroxylase / 17 , 20 lyase ( cyp17 ) enzyme that will increase testosterone level [ 28 ] .
cyp17 is a p450 enzyme that catalyzes the last step of androgen biosynthesis in both the testis and the adrenals .
in androgen - deficient patient ( hypogonadism ) , there is a failure of the testis to produce physiological levels of androgen especially testosterone due to disruption of one or more levels of the hypothalamic - pituitary - testicular axis [ 1 ] .
the choice of treatment for androgen deficiency syndrome is testosterone replacement therapy [ 1 - 4 , 6 ] .
androgens play vital role in bone formation through androgen receptor ( ar ) which are present in most bone cells .
testosterone acts both direct and indirectly via the ar and following aromatization , via the estrogen receptor ( er ) , respectively [ 29 - 31 ] .
androgens may protect men against osteoporosis by maintaining the cancellous bone mass and expansion of the cortical bone [ 31 ] .
however , the adverse effects of testosterone can be troublesome to the patients such as sleep apnea , polycythemia , liver toxicity , and more importantly , the risk of developing cancer [ 1 , 5 , 32 , 33 ] .
hormone - dependent cancers such as metastatic prostate cancer and breast cancer may be stimulated during testosterone treatment .
testosterone is not recommended for those with underlying or high - risk factors for cancer [ 1 , 5 ] .
therefore , an alternative to testosterone should be recommended to these patients .
based upon earlier studies , el may increase the testosterone levels and preserve the bone calcium content [ 14 , 20 ] .
it was found that el supplementation to normal male rats failed to elevate the testosterone levels compared to nontreatment rats .
while for orchidectomised rat , the model for androgen - deficient osteoporosis [ 21 ] , there was a significant reduction in the testosterone levels .
similar findings were found in several other studies which reported that the testosterone level falls immediately after orchidectomy [ 34 , 35 ] .
testosterone replacement was shown to reverse the effect of orchidectomy .
the testosterone levels of the orchidectomised rats remained low with el supplementation ( figure 4 ) .
these findings showed that el supplementation did not alter the testosterone levels of both normal and testosterone - depleted rats .
based on the histomorphometric analysis of the first part of the study , there was no significant change in the bv / tv of normal rat with el supplementation .
in the second part of the study , the drop in the testosterone level in the orxc group was associated with the reduction in bv / tv. when the testosterone level was raised with testosterone replacement in the orx + t group , bv / tv was restored to that of the sham group .
testosterone was able to improve the trabecular bone volume of orchidectomised rats ; however , el failed to emulate the testosterone action .
this may be contributed by the failure of el to raise the testosterone level of orchidectomised rats as that demonstrated by testosterone replacement .
only the bv / tv parameter produced significant findings .
although there were differences in the rest of the structural parameters , they failed to reach statistical significance among the groups .
clinical study in human has found that the dose up to 600 mg / kg did not cause any adverse effects [ 36 ] .
el is normally recommended to be administered by men at the dose of 200 - 400 mg daily .
the dose of el used in the present study is equivalent to the dose of about 100 mg / day in human , which is considered safe .
acute toxicity study revealed that the ld50 for el extract was more than 5000 mg / kg [ 37 ] .
it is unlikely to cause fatality in human as the equivalent dose of el is 35 kg in a 70 kg man .
in subacute toxicity study , el extract at doses of more than 1200 mg / kg was shown to cause pathological changes in the rat liver .
this dose was equivalent to approximately 8200 mg taken by a 70 kg man [ 37 ] .
in the first part of the study , el supplementation ( el group ) did not seem to elevate the testosterone levels in rats with intact testes .
this contradicted the finding that el raised testosterone level in rats [ 8 ] and late onset hypogonadism patients which used different dosage [ 14 ] .
however , there is a possibility that el may only work when there is testosterone deficiency and that the testes are still intact .
el may only work to rectify the androgen deficiency state by stimulating the testes to produce testosterone .
in androgen - deficient osteoporosis model , the rats were orchidectomised ; therefore , we cannot determine if that was the case .
however , it was proven that el was unable to raise the testosterone level in rats with the absence of testes .
5. conclusion el failed to emulate the testosterone replacement 's ability to raise the testosterone level and restore the bone structure of orchidectomised rats .
it also failed to produce any effect when supplemented to normal male rats .
further studies are required to determine if el may be useful in androgen - deficient state if the testes are still intact .

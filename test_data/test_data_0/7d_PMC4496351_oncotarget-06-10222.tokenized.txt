many studies have shown that vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , especially the human vegf - a165 ( hvegf - a165 ) isoform , is a key proangiogenic factor that is overexpressed in lung cancer .
we generated transgenic mice that overexpresses hvegf - a165 in lung - specific clara cells to investigate the development of pulmonary adenocarcinoma .
in this study , three transgenic mouse strains were produced by pronuclear microinjection , and southern blot analysis indicated similar patterns of the foreign gene within the genomes of the transgenic founder mice and their offspring .
accordingly , hvegf - a165 mrna was expressed specifically in the lung tissue of the transgenic mice .
histopathological examination of the lung tissues of the transgenic mice showed that hvegf - a165 overexpression induced bronchial inflammation , fibrosis , cysts , and adenoma .
pathological section and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) analyses demonstrated a positive correlation between the development of pulmonary cancer and hvegf expression levels , which were determined by immunohistochemistry , qrt - pcr , and western blot analyses .
gene expression profiling by cdna microarray revealed a set of up - regulated genes ( hvegf - a165 , cyclin b1 , cdc2 , egfr , mmp9 , nrp - 1 , and kdr ) in vegf tumors compared with wild - type lung tissues .
in addition , overexpressing hvegf - a165 in clara cells increases cd105 , fibrogenic genes ( collagen alpha1 , alpha - sma , tgf - beta1 , and timp1 ) , and inflammatory cytokines ( il - 1 , il - 6 , and tnf - alpha ) in the lungs of hvegf - a165 - overexpressing transgenic mice as compared to wild - type mice .
we further demonstrated that the intranasal administration of microrna - 16 ( mir - 16 ) inhibited lung tumor growth by suppressing vegf expression via the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways .
in conclusion , hvegf - a165 transgenic mice exhibited complex alterations in gene expression and tumorigenesis and may be a relevant model for studying vegf - targeted therapies in lung adenocarcinoma .
vegf transgenic mice pulmonary tumorigenesis magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) mirna therapy introduction despite major advances in cancer therapeutics , the survival rate for patients with lung cancer has not significantly improved , even in the era of targeted therapy [ 1 ] .
lung cancer is responsible for 1.3 million annual deaths worldwide [ 2 ] , and it remains the leading cause of cancer - related deaths in the western world , with approximately 160,000 deaths annually [ 3 ] .
it is clear that chemotherapy effectiveness has reached a plateau [ 4 ] , and newer , more active approaches are needed to improve the prognosis of this devastating disease .
thus , mouse models for human lung cancer have been developed in recent years to understand the mechanisms of the disease , to identify several potential molecular targets and to develop novel " targeted therapies " .
the primary cause of pulmonary cancer consists of gene mutations induced by carcinogens contained in items , such as the cigarette smoke inhaled by long - term addicts or environmentally polluted air .
the number of the gene mutations that accumulate over time may promote cell carcinogenesis and the growth of a tumor .
in addition to cigarette addiction , the long - term inflammatory response in the lungs caused by allergens in the air may also cause pulmonary adenocarcinoma .
thus , chronic diseases in the lungs and family inheritance are two common causes of pulmonary adenocarcinoma .
according to previous studies , genetic background is another cause of pulmonary cancers .
a person with a family history of pulmonary cancer will have a higher probability of pulmonary carcinogenesis [ 5 ] .
additionally , there is evidence that gene mutations ( k - ras , cyclin d1 , bcl2 , rb , and apc ) play a role in the formation of human lung adenocarcinoma [ 6 , 7 ] .
angiogenesis is one of the crucial causes of cancer development , and vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) .
therefore , angiogenesis - targeting agents were among the first to be recognized for their potential benefit against nsclc [ 8 ] .
several proangiogenic factors have been identified , and vegf is considered the most potent [ 9 ] .
the abnormal function of vegf results in many diseases , such as cardiovascular diseases , pulmonary edema , improper inflammation response , tumor metastasis , and angiogenesis [ 10 ] .
the vegf gene family consists of four homologues : vegf - a ( usually referred to as vegf ) , vegf - b , vegf - c , and vegf - d. vegf - a is considered the most important for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis [ 9 , 11 ] .
additionally , under normal regulatory conditions , vegf - a helps in wound occlusion and in regulating the female menstrual cycle [ 12 ] .
a cell or a tissue under hypoxia or ischemia is able to induce the expression of the hypoxia - inducible factor - 1 ( hif - 1 ) protein to promote the efficiency of vegf - a mrna transcription , to promote the occurrence of the vegf - a protein , and to cause angiogenesis .
moreover , vegf - a is divided into four isoforms , including vegf - a121 , vegf - a165 , vegf - a189 , and vegf - a206 .
vegf - a165 , the most common form of vegf - a , primarily functions in promoting angiogenesis .
when vegf - a lacks exon 6 , the resulting protein , vegf - a165 , still retains the heparin - binding site , but its ability to link to acetyl heparin sulfate is much lower than that of the two isoforms vegf - a206 and vegf - a189 .
early - stage cancer cells will continue to proliferate , leading to nutrition and oxygen deficiencies and resulting in a large amount of cell death .
therefore , an inflammatory response will occur , and hif - 1alpha will be activated to induce the secretion of a large quantity of vegf - a165 .
vegf - a165 will then bind to vegfr2 , activating downstream signals to induce vasculogenesis [ 12 , 13 ] .
it is evident that vegf - a165 supports the growth and metastasis of malignant tumor cells .
when cancer cells secrete a large amount of vegf - a165 , vasculogenesis is induced to provide a sufficient amount of nutrients and oxygen to the tumor , thus increasing the rate of tumor growth [ 14 ] .
the over - secretion of vegf - a165 promotes degradation of the extra - cellular matrix and increases vascular permeability , rendering the tumor cells liable to invade other tissues [ 15 ] .
therefore , the development of inhibitors and therapies targeting vegf - a165 and its related factors are popular areas of research .
here , we developed a method for generating transgenic mice that express vegf - a165 ; these animals can serve as a model for investigating the regulatory mechanism of pulmonary adenocarcinoma .
results production of transgenic mice carrying the mccsp - vegf - a165 - sv40 transgenic fusion gene a 1,975 - bp mccsp - vegf - a165 - sv40 transgene ( figure 1a ) was directly microinjected into pronuclear - stage mouse embryos , which were then transferred into the fallopian tubes of recipient females .
after parturition , 36 newborn mice were obtained and underwent pcr screening , and 3 newborn mice , named tg1 - f0 , tg2 - f0 , and tg3 - f0 , were identified to have successful integration of the transgene .
each of the three transgenic mice was mated to a normal fvb mouse to produce offspring ( f1 , f2 and f3 ) .
the integration pattern of the foreign gene was determined by southern blot analysis ( figure 1b ) , and three transgenic founders were found to possess different transgenic patterns .
multiple integrated copies of the transgene were found to be stably inserted into the germ lines of these founders .
to determine the expression level of the transgene in the transgenic mice , semi - quantitative reverse transcription - pcr ( rt - pcr ) was performed .
as shown in figure 1c , a 243 - bp rt - pcr product was amplified from the lung tissue of transgenic mice .
the transgenic line tg3 exhibited a higher level of hvegf - a165 expression than the transgenic line tg2 , while no hvegf - a165 expression was detected in the transgenic line tg1 or the wild - type mice .
therefore , the transgenic founders of the transgenic line tg3 had the highest hvegf - a165 expression .
additionally , the hvegf - a165 mrna of the transgenic line tg3 - f3 - 1 was specifically expressed in the lungs of the mouse and was not expressed in the tissues of other organs , including the kidney , gonad , brain , and liver ( figure 1d ) .

the southern blot data showed that the foreign gene was found in similar patterns within the genomes of the transgenic founder mice and their offspring. c. the pulmonary vegf - a165 mrna expression level in the offspring of transgenic mice was determined by semi - quantitative rt - pcr .
the data showed that the vegf - a165 mrna was expressed in the tg 2 and tg 3 offspring , but it was not expressed in the tg 1 offspring .
beta - actin was used as an internal control. d. the vegf - a165 mrna expression in specific tissues was determined using semi - quantitative rt - pcr .
rt - pcr showed that vegf - a165 mrna was expressed specifically in the lung tissue of transgenic mice .
beta - actin was used as an internal control .
histology of the transgenic mice we performed serial histologic analysis of the lungs of transgenic and wild - type mice up to the age of 12 months .
the wild - type mice showed normal lung histology with no evidence of malignancy ( figure 2a , left ) .
in contrast , the transgenic mice began to develop neoplasms on the periphery of the pulmonary alveolus and adenomas near the lung bronchus ( figure 2a , right ) .
in addition , we also observed bronchial fibrosis in the transgenic mice ( figure 2b , right ) but normal bronchial walls in the wild - type mice ( figure 2b , left ) .
compared with the wild - type mice , the transgenic mice had an increased number of intra - alveolar macrophages with strong eosinophilic cytoplasm , which presumably represented an obvious inflammation response ( figure 2c , right ) .
a cyst created by hyperplasia of the epidermis on the bronchus and blockage of the secretory tissues further induced pulmonary emphysema in the transgenic mice ( figure 2d , right ) .
additionally , both local cell hyperplasia and flattening phenomena on the epidermis of the bronchus of the transgenic mouse were also found ( figure 2d , right ) .
according to the results , the inflammatory response in the bronchus to alveoli may have been induced by overexpression of hvegf - a165 .
furthermore , immunoblot analysis confirmed that an increased hvegf - a165 protein level was detected in the lung tissue of transgenic mice ( figure 2e , right ) and that no hvegf - a165 protein was found in the wild - type mice ( figure 2e , left ) .
therefore , exogenous hvegf - a165 protein was specifically expressed in the clara lung cells of the transgenic mice , and the expression level of this protein was noticeably higher in the transgenic mice than the wild - type mice .
as shown in figure 2f , the expression of fluorescently labeled ccsp was found in the bead - like clara cells in lung capillary bronchus sections from the wild - type mice ( figure 2f , left ) , while only very weak expression of the fluorescently labeled ccsp was found in the transgenic mice ( figure 2f , right ) .

hvegf - a165 expression in three tumorigenesis levels of transgenic mice to analyze the relative expression levels of hvegf - a165 , we divided the > 12 - month - old transgenic mice into three groups , tg - level - 1 , tg - level - 2 , and tg - level - 3 ( figure 3a ) .
the tg - level - 1 transgenic mice showed no obvious differences in their exterior lung tissues .
however , the lung tissues of the tg - level - 2 transgenic mice exhibited red color block distribution in their exterior lung tissues .
the lung tissues of the tg - level - 3 transgenic mice had serious injury to their exterior lung tissues and had formed a tumor protrusion .
as shown in figure 3b , the transgenic mice of the three tumorigenesis levels showed differential hvegf - a165 protein expression by western blot analysis .
the hvegf - a165 protein expression level was significantly higher by 2.7 - and 4.5 - fold in the tg - level - 2 and tg - level - 3 transgenic mice , respectively , compared with that of the tg - level - 1 as well as wild type mice ( p < 0.05 ). by matching the hvegf - a165 protein expression level to the lung tissues of the three tumorigenesis levels of transgenic mice , it was speculated that both the injuries and carcinogenesis of the transgenic mice were positively related to a specific hvegf - a165 protein expression level in the lung .

additionally , the quantitation of the angiogenesis of lung - tissue spreads using an angiogenesis image analyzer ( kurabo , usa ) is shown in figure 3c .
the number of branches of angiogenesis was significantly higher by 2.0 - , 2.7 - , and 3.9 - fold in tg - level - 1 , tg - level - 2 , and tg - level - 3 transgenic mice , respectively , compared with that of the wild type mice ( p < 0.05 ) .
to evaluate the angiogenic activity of the three tumorigenesis levels of the transgenic mice , chick embryo chorioallantoic membranes ( cams ) were used , and the results are shown in figure 3d .
there was obvious hyperplasia in the lung tissues of the tg - level - 2 and tg - level - 3 transgenic mice that clearly produced a larger vascular zone in cams compared with the lung tissue of wild - type mice ( figure 3d ) .
however , there were no significant differences between the lung tissues of wild - type mice and tg - level - 1 transgenic mice .
the cdna microarray analysis the differences in the gene expression profiles of the transgenic and wild - type mice were investigated using cdna microarrays to understand adenocarcinomagenesis , and the results are as shown in figure 4 .
using an agilent mouse whole genome 44k oligonucleotide microarray , the lung tissue expression patterns of 44,000 known genes were analyzed. of the 3,000 genes represented on the microarray , we selected genes that were at least 2 - fold differentially expressed , and of these genes , 580 ( cell - cell adhesion : 80 , signal pathway : 532 , apoptosis : 53 , and cell cycle regulation : 477 ) were up - regulated in the lung tissue of tg - level - 3 compared with wild - type mice , as shown in supplementary table 1 .
furthermore , the microarray data were analyzed using ingenuity pathway analysis ( ipa ) software .
the ipa result showed that a cluster of genes were triggered by overexpressed hvegf - a165 , and these genes are targets of cancer development , respiratory disease , and cell cycle regulators .

the cy5 / cy3 ratios of 580 cdnas that deviated by more than 2 - fold are shown. c. the ingenuity pathway analysis ( ipa ) of the mouse cdna microarray data obtained from wild - type and tg - level - 3 mice .
to validate the gene expression patterns of the three tumorigenesis levels of transgenic mice revealed by microarray analysis , the expression levels of nine selected genes ( hvegf - a165 , cyclin b1 , cdc2 , egfr , mmp9 , brca - 1 , myc , nrp - 1 , and kdr ) were determined using qrt - pcr ( figure 5a ) .
the expression levels of seven of these genes ( hvegf - a165 , cyclin b1 , cdc2 , egfr , mmp9 , nrp - 1 , and kdr ) were significantly higher , verifying the validity of the gene expression patterns that were observed by microarray analysis and ipa .
in addition , the expression levels of six proteins in the lung tissues of the three tumorigenesis levels of transgenic mice were evaluated by western blot analysis ( figure 5b ) .
the descending order of protein expression ( hvegf - a165 , cyclin b1 , cdc2 , p - cdc2 , brca - 1 , and myc ) of the different levels of transgenic mice was tg - level - 3 > tg - level - 2 > tg - level - 1 > wild type mice. of these , the tg - level - 3 transgenic mice exhibited the highest hvegf - a165 , cyclin b1 , cdc2 , p - cdc2 , brca - 1 , and myc protein expression levels of all the transgenic mice .

gadph was used as an internal control .
endoglin ( cd105 ) , fibrogenic genes , and inflammatory cytokines in three tumorigenesis levels of transgenic mice the cd105 level was significantly higher by 1.73 - , 3.58 - , and 4.10 - fold in the tg - level - 1 , tg - level - 2 , and tg - level - 3 transgenic mice , respectively , compared with that of the wild - type mice ( figure 6a ) .
the increasing order of fibrogenic genes ( collagen alpha1 , alpha - sma , tgf - beta1 , and timp1 ) of the different levels of transgenic mice was tg - level - 3 > tg - level - 2 > tg - level - 1 > wild - type mice ( figure 6b ) .
in addition , the tg - level - 3 transgenic mice exhibited the serious inflammatory response with the highest inflammatory cytokines ( il - 1 , il - 6 , and tnf - alpha ) following by tg - level - 2 , tg - level - 1 , and wild - type mice ( figure 6c ) .

magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) for monitoring lung tumor growth in transgenic mice to evaluate individual tumors in vivo , tumors from anesthetized animals were imaged using high - resolution mri that continuously collected images over a long period of tumor growth and treatment .
when the animals became moribund , they were sacrificed , and their lungs were inflated with fixative , embedded in paraffin , and then serially sectioned to compare the tumors using both high - resolution mri and histological methods .
mri proved to be most useful in detecting lung tumors located in the hilar area and least useful in detecting serosal surface and anterior lobe tumor foci .
figure 7 shows that solitary nodules were observed in four of four recipients in the > 12 - month - old , lung - specific hvegf - a165 - overexpressing ( tg - level - 2 and tg - level - 3 ) transgenic mice .
histological sections also showed adenocarcinoma foci in the lung ; in contrast , no tumors were found in the wild - type mice .

microrna - 16 reduces pulmonary tumorigenesis in vegf - overexpressing transgenic mice the generated mouse model can be used to investigate the role of vegf in pulmonary adenocarcinoma .
therefore , we further investigated the inhibitory effect of microrna - 16 ( mir - 16 ) on lung tumors ( figure 8 ) because recent reports have linked the expression of specific micrornas with tumorigenesis and metastasis .
after three intranasal administrations of 20 mug mir - 16 or mock mir per mouse once a week , we found that mir - 16 , which lowered the expression of vegf in both lung tissues ( figure 8b and 8c ) and circulation blood ( figure 8d ) ( p < 0.01 ) , affected the formation of lung tumors in > 12 - month - old lung - specific hvegf - a165 overexpressing transgenic mice ( figure 8a ) .
thus , mir - 16 can inhibit lung cancer growth by suppressing vegf expression .
to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying mir - 16 - induced apoptosis , apoptosis - related proteins were examined via western blot analyses .
the results of the western blot analyses revealed that the cleaved forms of caspase 3 , 8 , 9 , and poly ( adp - ribose ) polymerase ( parp ) were activated after mir - 16 treatment in the hvegf - a165 overexpressing transgenic mice ( figure 8e ) .
based on these results , mir - 16 may induce apoptosis via both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways .

microrna - 16 reduces pulmonary tumorigenesis in human orthotopic non - small cell lung cancer xenograft model the therapeutic efficacy of mir - 16 was evaluated in the a549 - pcag - irfp - 2a - verus orthotopic lung tumor mouse model .
a549 - pcag - irfp - 2a - verus tumor cells suspended in matrigel / pbs were injected into the left lung parenchyma to a depth and the wounds were closed with a surgical skin clip .
figure 9a showed that mir - 16 lowered pulmonary tumorigenesis via decreased the expression of vegf in both lung tissues ( figure 9a , lower panel ) and circulation blood ( figure 9b ) , and also decreased the expression of cd105 tumor marker in serum ( figure 9c ) , affected the formation of lung tumors in human orthotopic non - small cell lung cancer xenograft model .
thus , the result was the same with vegf - overexpressing transgenic mice model that mir - 16 can inhibit lung cancer growth by suppressing vegf expression .

discussion in this study , we developed a method for studying the lung - specific expression of a hvegf - a165 transgene under the control of the mouse clara cell - specific protein ( mccsp ) gene promoter in > 12 - month - old hvegf - a165 - overexpressing transgenic mice with significant lung inflammation and adenocarcinoma formation ( figure 2 ) .
vegf increases endothelial cell permeability and enhances endothelial cell migration and proliferation [ 16 ] , rendering vegf necessary for tumor growth and angiogenesis [ 17 ] .
during lung adenocarcinoma development , intrinsic ccsp expression was decreased in the bead - like clara cells in the lung capillary bronchus of the transgenic mice .
hicks et al .
[ 18 ] also showed that only an occasional cell or segment of the bronchiolar epithelium stained positively for ccsp ( also known as cc10 ) using immunohistochemical methods , and all tumors were found to be uniformly negative for staining .
based on the results of the foregoing studies , it was concluded that the chronic inflammation or serious injuries and even the formation of a tumor during carcinogenesis that occurred in the lung of transgenic mice aged 12 months or older were related to lung - specific vegf - a165 protein expression .
vegf - a is highly expressed in numerous tumors of the lung , brain and gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts [ 19 ] .
vegf - a binds to two receptor tyrosine kinases , vegfr1 ( flt - 1 ) and vegfr2 ( flk - 1 / kdr ) , and transduces angiogenic signals .
this expression is induced through several genetic ( activation of oncogenes , or inactivation or loss of tumor suppressor genes ) and epigenetic ( hypoxia , low ph , interleukin - 6 , inflammatory cytokines and growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor ) mechanisms [ 20 ] .
in nsclc , vegf expression is associated with increased tumor microvasculature and potentially poor prognosis [ 21 , 22 ] .
the expression of vegf - a165 is related to the growth and spread of cancer cells .
when cancer cells secrete a large amount of vegf - a165 , vasculogenesis is induced to provide sufficient nutrition and oxygen to the tumor , which increases the rate of tumor growth [ 12 ] .
in this study , we confirmed that the expression of vegf - a165 is positively related to the formation of pulmonary cancer ( figure 3a and 3b ) .
vegf - a165 primarily binds to kdr , inducing dimerization of kdr , which promotes intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation that results in a series of signal transductions that promote endothelial cell survival , hyperplasia and differentiation [ 23 ] .
to examine the molecular mechanisms induced by hvegf - a165 overexpression , we conducted microarray and ipa analyses and found that cyclin b1 and cdc2 ( cell cycle ) , mmp9 ( metastasis ) , and brca1 and myc ( oncogenes ) were overexpressed in > 12 - month - old hvegf - a165 - overexpressing ( tg - level - 2 and tg - level - 3 ) transgenic mice ( figures 4 and 5 ) .
these results suggest that vegf overexpression induces cell cycle progression and metastasis by increasing the cyclin b1 , cdc2 , and mmp9 levels .
these findings have important implications for the role of vegf overexpression in pulmonary tumors .
cd105 is a membranous protein overexpressed in tumor - associated endothelial cells .
in this study , the cd105 level was significantly higher in hvegf - a165 - overexpressing transgenic mice than wild - type mice ( figure 6a ) .
in addition , overexpressing hvegf - a165 in clara cells causes increased fibrogenic genes ( figure 6b ) and inflammatory cytokines ( figure 6c ) in the lungs of hvegf - a165 - overexpressing transgenic mice as compared to wild - type mice .
the data presented here strongly suggest that vegf overexpression may be one of the reasons for the initiation of tumorigenesis .
thus , various vegf inhibitors are being widely proposed as potential therapeutic agents for cancer treatment .
vegf signaling has become an important target for cancer therapy because of its central role in regulating angiogenesis , and targeting vegf signaling is proving to be a valuable therapeutic approach in cancer patients .
significantly , the humanized anti - vegf monoclonal antibody bevacizumab showed promising results when used in combination with chemotherapy in nsclc phase iii trials [ 24 ] .
however , in another phase iii trial , adding bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy did not result in an overall longer survival of the nsclc patients [ 25 ] .
therefore , it is important to identify reliable predictive factors that will allow for the selection of patients who are most likely to benefit from anti - angiogenesis agents in future studies .
furthermore , the present study provides a method for generating mice for investigating the role of vegf in pulmonary adenocarcinoma formation .
the mice were genetically engineered to specifically express hvegf - a165 in the lung .
furthermore , the mice developed different degrees of tumorigenesis , as demonstrated by histopathological analyses .
to evaluate the individual lung tumors in vivo , we employed a living image system using high - resolution mri of anesthetized animals ( figure 7 ) .
the mri technique that was used for the mouse tumor models has several advantages , such as the following : 1 ) mri can continuously collect images over a long period of tumor growth and treatment ; 2 ) mri reveals information ranging from anatomical structure to chemical composition and physiological parameters , such as blood flow [ 26 ] ; 3 ) mri provides much higher contrast between various soft tissues than computed tomography ( ct ) , and paramagnetic contrast agents can further enhance this contrast [ 27 ] ; and 4 ) successful applications of mri in the mouse have led to the development of high - throughput drug discovery techniques [ 28 ] .
using the lung - specific adenocarcinoma transgenic mouse model and the a549 - pcag - irfp - 2a - verus orthotopic lung tumor mouse model , we further investigated the novel approaches for microrna target therapy and demonstrated that mir - 16 effectively inhibits lung cancer growth by suppressing vegf expression via the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways ( figure 8 ) .
few published studies have identified mirnas that contribute to the expression of vegf .
hua et al .
[ 29 ] showed that vegf is predicted to be targeted by multiple mirnas , including mir - 15b , mir - 16 , mir - 20a and mir - 20b , and transfection of these mirnas into cne cells ( a human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line ) can inhibit vegf expression [ 29 ] .
more recently , roccaro et al .
[ 30 ] showed that mir - 15a / 16 are decreased or completely absent in relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma ( mm ) patients and that mir - 15a / 16 are critical regulators of mm pathogenesis .
however , strong evidence demonstrating that these mirnas regulate vegf in mm and other cancer types has not yet been reported [ 31 , 32 ] .
in conclusion , our hvegf - a165 - bearing mice had pronounced pulmonary inflammation , hyperplasia and tumorigenesis that were triggered by higher vegf - a expression levels in lung - specific clara cells .
we further demonstrated that the intranasal administration of mir - 16 could inhibit lung cancer growth by significantly suppressing vegf expression .
therefore , this animal model may be used to study cancer pathophysiology , tumor - associated inflammation , and the effects of new target therapy interventions .
materials and methods detection of the transgene by pcr screening and southern blot hybridization the mccsp - vegf - a165 - sv40 - transgenic mice ( fvb ) were generated by pronuclear microinjection .
a 1,975 - bp transgene fragment ( figure 1a ) , consisting of the mccsp promoter , hvegf - a165 cdna and sv40 poly ( a ) signal sequence , was obtained from the plasmid by nrui - sapi double - digestion .
the purified transgene was then microinjected into the male pronuclei of fertilized eggs and transferred to pseudo - pregnant recipient females as previously described [ 33 , 34 ] .
to detect the hvegf - a165 transgene in mice , the pups were rapidly screened by pcr analysis of tail genomic dna using the primer set hvegf94 (+) and hvegf315 ( - ) , which is listed in table 1 .
the screening results were further verified by southern blot hybridization as previously described [ 33 ] .
briefly , 10 mug of genomic dna were digested with ncoi at 37degreesc overnight , electrophoresed on a 0.8 % agarose gel , and then transferred to a durose nitrocellulose membrane ( stratagene , la jolla , ca ) .
the psti - bglii fragment of the hvegf - a165 cdna ( 0.6 kb ) was used as a radioactive probe and hybridized to the membrane , and the blots were subjected to autoradiography for one week at - 20degreesc .

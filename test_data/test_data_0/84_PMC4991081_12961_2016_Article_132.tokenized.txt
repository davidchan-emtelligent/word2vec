background research capacity building and its impact on policy and international research partnership is increasingly seen as important .
high income and low - and middle - income countries frequently engage in research collaborations .
these can have a positive impact on research capacity building , provided such partnerships are long - term collaborations with a unified aim , but they can also have challenges .
what are these challenges , which often result in a short term / non viable collaboration ?
does such collaboration results in capacity building ?
what are the requirements to make any collaboration sustainable ?
this study aimed to answer these and other research questions through examining an international collaboration in one multi - country research capacity building project arcade rsdh ( asian regional capacity development for research on social determinants of health ) .
method a qualitative study was conducted that focused on the reasons for the collaboration , collaboration patterns involved , processes of exchanging information , barriers faced and perceived growth in research capacity .
in - depth interviews were conducted with the principal investigators ( n = 12 ) , research assistants ( n = 2 ) and a scientific coordinator ( n = 1 ) of the collaborating institutes .
data were analysed using thematic framework analysis .
results the initial contact between institutes was through previous collaborations .
the collaboration was affected by the organisational structure of the partner institutes , political influences and the collaboration design .
communication was usually conducted online , which was affected by differences in time and language and inefficient infrastructure .
limited funding resulted in restricted engagement by some partners .
conclusion this study explored work in a large , north - south collaboration project focusing on building research capacity in partner institutes .
the project helped strengthen research capacity , though differences in organization types , existing research capacity , culture , time , and language acted as obstacles to the success of the project .
managing these differences requires preplanned strategies to develop functional communication channels among the partners , maintaining transparency , and sharing the rewards and benefits at all stages of collaboration .

the reasons for low research output from lmics can be shortages of local qualified researchers , limited funding , poor infrastructure , and lack of expertise in academic writing [ 3 - 7 ] .
building and sustaining research capacity within developing countries is a complex [ 7 , 8 ] , but essential and effective means of accelerating research contributions to health and development [ 9 - 12 ] .
however , researchers have noted that 90 % of global research investments addresses the needs of only 10 % of the world 's population [ 13 ] .
most research output is also from high - income countries [ 14 ] .
facilitating collaboration between developed and developing counterparts [ 15 ] could result in higher research outputs from lmics [ 16 , 17 ] .
to this end , organisations , such as the council on health research for development ( cohred ) in 2003 , were created at the global level to work directly with governments in lmics to promote national and international collaborations [ 18 ] .
research collaboration in general has grown in importance for scientists , research organisations and policymakers [ 19 - 21 ] .
however , in spite of many initiatives , generally originating from high - income countries , collaborations are often criticised for failing to strengthen , incorporate , and involve low - income partners in priority setting and publications , and research collaboration does not always result in increased outputs [ 15 ] .
an international , cross - disciplinary , project faces many challenges , such as communication and coordination problems , misunderstandings , and mismatched expectations .
participants in such projects come from different fields of work and work for a unified goal , and are usually dependent on each other [ 16 ] .
therefore , the responsibility for making such collaboration successful falls onto the lead researchers , leading others at partner universities and institutes .
this management of multiple stakeholders with different resources and expectations is also a challenge [ 13 ] .
it is suggested that successful research collaborations need exploration and identification of areas of interventions , effective dissemination strategies , uptake of results and , most importantly , the commitment of the partner countries [ 9 , 10 ] .
barriers to successful collaboration include , amongst others , aims that are not shared , unequal distribution of power , lack of trust , ineffective membership structures and poor leadership [ 22 ] .
despite these challenges , international collaborations are often presented as a panacea for particularly complex issues and problems that exist within the fields of policy and politics in a wide range of international contexts [ 23 ] .
many benefits and requirements of such interventions are documented in the past , but the actual process of the collaboration has been studied infrequently .
given the challenges in trans - disciplinary and international collaborative research , and the possible barriers to success , it is important to learn from existing collaborations to give recommendations for countering challenges .
therefore , we aimed to understand ( 1 ) what are these challenges , which often result in a short - term / non - viable collaboration ?
( 2 ) does such collaboration result in capacity building ? and ( 3 ) what are the requirements to make collaborations sustainable ?
in one multi - country research collaboration , arcade rsdh ( asian regional capacity development research on social determinants of health ) .
methods arcade rsdh project arcade rsdh ( www.arcade - project.org ) was developed in response to inequities in health in the asian context , coinciding with weak local health research capacity , especially in the social determinants of health ( sdh ) research [ 24 ] .
the project originated as an adaptation of its sister project arcade hssr .
the project developed and progressed through funds from the european union .
the purpose of this collaboration was to add new research training capacity by training a new generation of researchers .
the focus was on postgraduate , doctoral and postdoctoral training in lmics in asia , and on the promotion of research on the sdh [ 24 ] .
under this collaboration , many courses were developed and delivered across institutions , and institutional capacity in grants management and communications was built [ 25 , 26 ] .
various innovative technologies were used by the project to produce world class online learning modules. through innovative technology , courses were made available to researchers in lmics that may not otherwise have had access to such material .
the list of arcade partners is shown in table 1 .

karolinska institutet ( ki ) , based in sweden , coordinated the project activities .
at each partner institution , principal investigators ( pi ) were mostly senior staff , supported by junior staff ( postdoctoral fellows , researchers or phd students ) in running the project .
activities were developed collaboratively within the consortium .
the consortium had two regional training centres ( hubs ; tjmc and sjnanhs , at the time of this study ) , each training doctoral and postdoctoral students , from their own countries , from the other asian partners and from the european partners , as well as open to international student applications .
the european partners and their networks supported the two regional training centres through staff visits and exchanges .
the two regional training centres supported each other through exchange of course materials , experience , skills and staff , joint training programmes for their students , and joint applications for research and research training grants in cooperation with european partners .
study setting we conducted a qualitative interview study online in r d gardi medical college , ujjain , india with 12 partner universities , from india , china , oman , vietnam , uk , sweden , finland and south africa , between march 2014 to june 2014 .
the study was conducted in the middle phase of this project .
data collection email invitations were sent to all the pis and project staff of the partner organizations for in - depth interviews , stating the purpose and objectives of the study .
in total , 16 participants from 12 institutions ( 12 pis , two research assistants , one project manager and one scientific coordinator ) participated in the study .
half of the interviewees were key people involved in formulation and execution of the project , and the rest played a less central role .
individual interviews at a time and place convenient to the participants were conducted in english through skype in march and april 2014 .
the interviews followed a set of topic guides , which were designed for the following categories of participants : coordinating organisation partners with large funding including the hub and partners with little funding .
the topic guide addressed ( 1 ) the reasons for collaboration , ( 2 ) how the information was exchanged and the challenges faced while carrying out project 's activities , and ( 3 ) whether capacity growth has occurred in the developing country over the course of the collaboration ( additional file 1 ) .
each interview lasted approximately 40 to 45 minutes .
the interviews were recorded electronically using a tape recorder .
the first author then transcribed them and this was cross - checked by the last author ( vd ) .
in order to protect anonymity , each transcript was marked with a unique case identification number and all names were removed .
data analysis the data collected were analyzed using thematic framework analysis .
the transcripts were read and reread and initial codes were enlisted by research team .
each code was described briefly. from these codes , a list of categories were developed which were tabulated using microsoft excel 2010 .
this framework was applied again on the transcripts , charting the data onto excel , modifying categories where necessary .
the final framework , consisting of 52 codes and 16 subcategories was analysed further to develop seven categories and three themes .
to increase the reliability , the complete thematic framework was read by the last author independently and updated .
analyses were discussed repeatedly among the authors [ 27 - 29 ] .
results three themes emerged from the analysis , namely ( 1 ) collaboration process : perception , phases and patterns ; ( 2 ) communication and outputs hampered by internet infrastructure and consortium size ; and ( 3 ) outcomes of the collaboration : what was actually achieved ( table 2 ) .

category 1 : perception about the project - unequal participation depending on available funding a clear understanding about the project aim and goal is important in an international collaborative project .
it seemed that arcade rsdh partners shared an understanding of the project .
many interviewees saw arcade rsdh as a great way of extending collaboration and adding research capacity to their own institutes .
" our institute needs to work with other international institutes , to enhance our network " - interviewee , small partner organisation .
" the peculiarity of this project is that the big partners have a bigger involvement , stronger roles and they tend to participate more .
the involvement of smaller partners seems to be a little less involved , but there are some exceptions in our case " - interviewee , coordinating organisation .
participants regarded the project as a way to improve both the collaboration capacity at the organisations as well as the educational capacity of the organisations .
category 2 : the collaboration process - importance of networks the consortium was developed based on previous working experience .
initially , partners were selected based on previous working relationships with kis and knowledge and interest in the subject area .
" we knew that they were excellent from previous experience and we wanted to bring the collaboration to the new project to continue working with them " - interviewee , coordinating organisation .
partner organisations were not just selected because they were known to the coordinator , they also had to have expertise and resources to implement the study .
for example , one of the small partners did not have any previous relation with the coordinating institute , but joined the collaboration to extend its international collaboration .
" no , this is the first time we are working with ki , we do n't have any previous collaboration with any of the institute .
our institute is very much aligned to the aim of the project and we need to enhance our network " - interviewee , small partner .
similar interests with the project 's objectives acted as a motivation to join the project , though motivations differed between ' smaller ' and ' larger ' partners .
partners with less funding were motivated to participate by access to resources and opportunity to communicate with international experts , which would ultimately enhance their institute 's scientific / research carrying capacity .
on the other hand , ' larger ' partners wished to share their resources and skilful expertise with the developing institutes in order to help them gain technical capacity .
this kind of mutual interest aided the collaboration : " ki approached us to give training to the less resourced research organisation and we have resources to help them , so we joined the project " - interviewee , big partner .
" by this kind of collaboration , we could increase educational resource and communicate with international experts " - interviewee , small partner organisation .
category 3 : collaboration pattern - challenges between asian partners the organisational culture and its structure influence any collaboration to a great extent .
in this project , the preference for collaboration was with universities due to their flexible working style , though not all the partners were universities .
according to one interviewee , the bureaucratic structure and other political issues often made collaboration difficult with some government run organizations because of their rigid working structure .
" the role of politicians is very much higher so it is much more difficult to work with government institute especially in india .
however , i am working with other institution in other countries , their political involvement is not there and it 's easy to work with them in comparison to india " - interviewee , coordinating institute .
while analysing the pattern of collaboration among arcade rsdh partners , collaboration was seen ( 1 ) between organisations in european countries ; ( 2 ) between organisations in european and asian countries ; ( 3 ) between organisations in asian countries ; and ( 4 ) between organisations within the same country .
active collaboration was seen between the european partners .
one of the european partners is the coordinating organisation , which receives help from another european organisation in developing online courses .
the collaboration among asian and european partners was seen as good , though there seemed to be less involvement of smaller asian partners than the ' larger ' asian partners : " we have this kind of activity of mentorship .
we have expert faculties from chinese university and ids [ united kingdom ] " - interviewee , small partner organisation .
however , the links between the asian partners were found to be weak .
only one or two institutes from asian countries collaborated with each other as opposed to collaborating with european institutes .
some of the reasons mentioned for this included little interaction and previous experience of working together between partners .
the differences in goals and administrative structures of the partners ( medical colleges , management and research institutes , universities ) also influenced the collaboration practice negatively .
" we came to know our partner after the consortium was formed ; most of the institutes are universities different from us so we do n't have much scope to learn from them " - interviewee , small partner .
participants observed that ' smaller ' partners collaborated with the hub institutes and other ' larger ' partner organisations , but there was no or little interaction between them .
the participants suspected this was caused by a lack of resources at ' smaller ' partners , limited funding and differences in the educational system , language and culture of the institutes .
" i think , as project needs more communication , many times we could n't get some difference in culture and language and we have different educational systems which poses challenges .
yes language is a big problem " - interviewee , small partner .
missing common goals among the partner institutes may hinder the process of international collaboration .
to some extent , this was the case in arcade rsdh - according to one of the small partner pis , the programme intends to build the research capacity of the institutes by giving training to the phd students and not the staff .
therefore , as these institutes did not have phd students , they were not active participants .
theme 2 : communication and outputs hampered by internet infrastructure and consortium size this theme emerged from the following categories : ( 1 ) email facilitating communication in a large consortium , and ( 2 ) the size of the consortium and diverse partners as a challenge to communication and activity .
category 1 : email facilitating communication in a large consortium technology plays an important role in building international collaboration .
it helps to bridge the cultural diversity and differences in an international collaboration such as arcade rsdh .
expectations of the collaboration can be quite different , and therefore good communication channels between the partners are important , which is usually facilitated by technology .
the most common and convenient method used in communicating daily activities was email .
technology such as skype and gotomeeting ( www.gotomeeting.com ) were used to arrange online meetings .
while reports gave partners an idea of ongoing activities , the most interaction and sharing of work occurred at annual meetings : " this is a huge project so many people have joined and working in the same year , the best way to get more response is by email " - interviewee , small partner , asia .
as the coordinating institute preferred to work via email , all partners also found that response from the coordinator was good .
" we get loads of emails they are good at providing emails .
they immediately reply .
we come to know about all the activities " - interviewee , small partner , asia .
partners communicated in the consortium to different degrees - responses to the coordinator varied from partner to partner .
similarly , the hub institutes reported getting mixed responses from ' smaller ' partners , as some replied promptly and others were more reluctant : " the main challenge is people do n't respond to emails so that 's the problem " - interviewee , hub institute , asia .
category 2 : size of the consortium and diverse partners as a challenge to communication and activity the size of the consortium , and the diversity of partners , was one of the challenges in arcade rsdh .
one of the main challenges is keeping track of all the ongoing activities , as arcade rsdh had 13 partners : " since it is a big workload for the coordinator to keep track of all the activities of the partners , sometimes some of the activities go under the radar " - interviewee , coordinating institute .
lack of in - depth knowledge of ongoing activities was also seen as a barrier to activity by small partners ; as some partners were ignorant about the project activities they lost interest in the project and became passive : " we need effective communication we have so many partners .
for example , i do n't know the recent development of this project and activities done " - interviewee , small partner organisation .
as some of the staff contributed to the project part - time , they were seen as overburdened .
they could contribute only limited hours to the project , some due to limited budget .
according to an interviewee , part - time involvement also affected the project outputs .
one 's entire attention is needed on the project to make the project successful .
inability to motivate the partners was also stated as a shortcoming .
" if we want arcade to happen really the interest should be solely focused on arcade activities .
motivation shall be as such that one really pays attention to this .
now the communication between the organisations is also must , the annual meeting is also a problem as not all are able to participate because of the time difference or the difficulty to reach the place .
having a conference on skype is also difficult " - interviewee , big partner organisation .
the basic structure of the consortium , in which the hub institutes communicated with smaller partners and coordinating institutes , was seen as one of the challenges in communication .
this specific structure sometimes resulted in turbulent flows of information as the exchange of information mostly occurred among the coordinating institute and larger partners and less between small partners .
smaller partners were mostly dependent on the hub institute for communication : " another problem is the structure of arcade is based on hub working / communicating with small institutes in some way that has not been working and this is creating a problem " - interviewee , coordinating institute .
according to the participants , new ways should have been explored to engage all the partners in the project .
to increase their involvement , they should be told about the benefits of engaging themselves in grant writing and grant management workshops , which will later help them build their research capacity .
the diversity of partners meant that there were several challenges to address in communication , including lack of infrastructure for communication and time differences .
lack of infrastructure as barrier to collaboration within the large consortium , lacking infrastructure , including internet facilities in ' small ' partner organisations , affected the planned ongoing activities of the project .
even if internet was available , the bandwidth may not have been sufficient , which was one of the most important prerequisites for conducting online courses and other online activities for a project like arcade rsdh .
all this resulted in a weak collaboration , especially among the small partners and between small and big partners .
" if you want to give good video or audio , bandwidth shall be good , but the institute is not able to give its entire bandwidth to this education " - interviewee , coordinating institute .
as can be expected , no technical issues were reported in european partners .
time difference as many of the partners were from different countries , time differences also hampered the collaboration and resulted in increased dependency on the use of email .
arranging online meetings with all the partners was difficult as any time decided was odd for one or another partner .
" setting up of some meeting , which would engage one person from canada and other partners based in china and vietnam , bringing up everyone in the same meeting is challenging " - interviewee , coordinating institute .
the small partners , who were less active , did not find timing as a major issue in collaboration .
" until now , we have not arranged any such meetings so i do n't see any challenge , it 's just a management issue " - interviewee , small institute .
theme 3 : outcomes of the collaboration : what was actually achieved ?
this theme emerged from the following categories : ( 1 ) limited effects on research training capacity and ( 2 ) infrastructure development as an additional outcome .
category 1 : limited effects on research training capacity participants felt that building research capacity for any institute is a gradual process and takes time , though enhancement in the research capacity was certainly observed .
" increase in research carrying capacity , specifically in sdh [ social determinants of health ] is not that significant , if judged by the no of proposals submitted for funding .
but it will soon become better .
i cannot score it high " - interviewee , small partner organisation .
hub institutes felt that their capacity had increased , with mentoring activities , development and networks being extended : " there are courses which are not developed in our institute but are developed by other partner organisations , so our students get the benefit of those courses .
other than that it 's an internal learning too , how to work in collaboration with other organisations " - interviewee , big partner organisation , european country .
according to participants , mapping the impact of research capacity building activities was essential to an international collaborative project .
for this , certain indicators were to be developed .
arcade rsdh had some process indicators to assess the ongoing activities in the project , but those were not sufficient to map the gain in the research carrying capacity of the partner institute .
" this is something we have n't really captured with indicators as to how our project is progressing and this is very much qualitative and depends on the level of satisfaction , etc . "
- interviewee , coordinating organisation .
category 2 : infrastructure development as an additional outcome some participants reported that they had developed in terms of infrastructure , which they were lacking earlier , and had become increasingly aware about grant management and implementation of online activities such as meetings and courses .
an increase in human resource capacity was also observed in partner organisations .
specific platforms for online learning , such as moodle ( www.moodle.org ) were adopted and developed by the hub institutes to conduct online courses .
many blended courses had been conducted across the partner institutes and a good enrolment of students for these courses was seen .
" staff has increased so small partner organisation 's capacity has also grown .
i think last time , when online activities were conducted , they were not that good as of now .
things are better technically [ internet connectivity ]" - interviewee , hub institute .
discussion this study explored the process of collaboration in an international collaborative project , arcade rsdh , which focused on building research capacity of young postgraduate , doctoral and postdoctoral researchers .
the project activities were carried out in a collaborative environment , with different collaborative partners and a unified goal [ 30 ] .
the project partners were assigned different roles that ranged from providing the resources to being the end - users of materials developed within the project .
the study highlighted how a collaboration begins and develops , and the challenges and solutions for communication and achieving the set goals .
collaborative projects are often seen challenging , as the project managers come from different organisations and backgrounds to work together .
the diversity in cultural and national backgrounds , skill sets and expertise , and managerial roles , results in different expectations , which may be difficult to meet [ 30 ] .
arcade rsdh had 12 partners with diverse cultural and organisational backgrounds , which were brought together mainly due to previous working relationships .
it is often seen that human , linguistic or social ties form as a result of historical interactions and support present - day collaborations [ 14 , 18 ] .
the partners involved in arcade were known to each other through previous work relations , though not all of them were familiar with each other .
these working relationships were not necessarily long term .
other studies have suggested that spatial proximity encourages collaboration [ 14 ] .
arcade rsdh did not seem to be influenced by spatial proximity as much as previous working ties .
however , the geographic spread also created challenges in collaboration , including time zones , organisational cultures and distance to meetings despite an active use of online resources .
in order to counter the effects of distance , emails were used as the main mode of communication .
however , email is usually overloaded and often missed by project staff [ 14 , 18 ] , and thus may not be the most effective mode of communication [ 14 ] .
project - related communication was enhanced by quarterly and annual meetings , but not all partners attended these .
in order to overcome these communication challenges a robust communication strategy should be planned , which should encourage face - to - face interaction among all the project partners , taking into account the time and cultural differences in the beginning phase of the project [ 22 , 29 ] .
one of the barriers found in this project , both with regards to communication and achieving outcomes , was understanding each other 's infrastructures and administrative organisations .
in this collaboration , some partners who initially committed to the project later became passive .
this could have been due to incentives not aligning with the demand for achievements , recognition and rewards [ 22 , 31 ] .
lack of a clear understanding about other partners' organizational structure and working style is also one of the reason behind them becoming passive .
successful collaborations require an understanding of each other 's working environment from the project planning stage of the partnership in order to get a clear insight about each other 's working methods .
this alignment can be achieved by openly discussing the differences and processing them at the beginning of the project , enhancing a focus driven collaboration [ 32 ] .
paradoxically to the aim of collaborations to enhance research capacity , existing research capacity in an institute also attracted collaboration with international partners in our study .
research indicates that scientific research requires a ' baseline ' level of scientific infrastructure to make collaboration effective in capacity building [ 14 ] .
therefore , institutions that do not have capacity at that critical level may not attract further capacity building , an issue that deserves attention and further research .
one reason for " smaller " partners becoming passive could be the funding structure and management structure that operated through hubs [ 33 ] .
in another collaboration , african partners could not contact each other directly and were obliged to direct their communication through united kingdom - based researchers [ 6 , 34 , 35 ] .
this kind of structure can decrease communication among the partners , and thus result in passivity .
attention should also be paid to funding structure in projects .
' small ' partners with limited resources cannot commit resources , including staff , to projects fully .
paying attention to ' smaller ' partners' needs is important in planning activities .
this helps enhance their research capacity , and in ensuring an equitable approach to capacity building [ 36 ] .
long and sustained collaboration is key to a project 's positive outcome .
sustained , systematic effort is particularly needed in collaborations aiming to build research capacity [ 8 ] .
short - term collaborations often lead to loss of existing achievements , especially in lmics , with capacities left unused and researchers migrating away in search of other job opportunities [ 13 ] .
research projects receive funding for a short period , which allows the creation of the project , but sustaining it longer when timelines are strict and further financing limited is challenging [ 37 ] .
arcade rsdh was a 4 - year span project , which received its funding from the european union seventh framework programme .
these activities came to an end after 4 years , though relationships were developed with project partners .
our participants felt that collaboration in arcade rsdh had indeed helped to develop research carrying capacity of partner organisations in various ways , though the activities initiated should have been carried on further as research capacity building takes many years and systematic effort and is not built in a short time frame .
limitations this study explored international collaboration using a cross - sectional , qualitative study .
as the study was conducted at a particular point of time during the middle phase of the project , it cannot represent the working of the collaboration during the entire project .
following the implementation from the beginning to the end may have yielded more substantial results .
this study did not assesses the process indicators and outcomes of activities planned during the project .
evaluation of such indicators in future will give more insight of research collaboration in such a large consortium .
conclusion this study explored work in a large , north - south collaboration project focusing on building research capacity in partner institutes .
collaborative partners emphasised the need to set up clear targets , communication strategies and align research interests at the start of collaboration .
managing these challenges requires pre - planned strategies to develop proper communication channels among the partners , maintaining transparency , and sharing the rewards and benefits at all stages of collaboration .
north - south collaborations should ensure that funding is equitable to ensure active participation .
collaborations such as arcade rsdh have potential to build research capacity in all partners , but such activity needs sustained and systematic effort .

many plant and animal viruses are spread by insect vectors .
cauliflower mosaic virus ( camv ) is aphid - transmitted , with the virus being taken up from specialized transmission bodies ( tb ) formed within infected plant cells .
however , the precise events during tb - mediated virus acquisition by aphids are unknown .
here , we show that tbs react instantly to the presence of the vector by ultra - rapid and reversible redistribution of their key components onto microtubules throughout the cell .
enhancing or inhibiting this tb reaction pharmacologically or by using a mutant virus enhanced or inhibited transmission , respectively , confirming its requirement for efficient virus - acquisition .
our results suggest that camv can perceive aphid vectors , either directly or indirectly by sharing the host perception .
this novel concept in virology , where viruses respond directly or via the host to the outside world , opens new research horizons , that is , investigating the impact of ' perceptive behaviors' on other steps of the infection cycle .
doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.00183.001 elife digest viruses are infectious agents that can replicate only inside a living host cell .
when a virus infects an animal or plant , it introduces its own genetic material and tricks the host cells into producing viral proteins that can be used to assemble new viruses .
an essential step in the life cycle of any virus is transmission to a new host : understanding this process can be crucial in the fight against viral epidemics .
many viruses use living organisms , or vectors , to move between hosts .
in the case of plant viruses such as cauliflower mosaic virus , the vectors are often aphids .
when an aphid sucks sap out of a leaf , virus particles already present in the leaf become attached to its mouth , and these viruses can be transferred to the next plant that the insect feeds on. however , in order for cauliflower mosaic virus particles to become attached to the aphid , structures called transmission bodies must form beforehand in the infected plant cells .
these structures are known to contain helper proteins that bind the viruses to the mouth of the aphid , but the precise role of the transmission body has remained obscure .
now martiniere et al. show that the transmission body is in fact a dynamic structure that reacts to the presence of aphids and , in so doing , boosts the efficiency of viral transmission .
in particular , they show that the action of an aphid feeding on an infected leaf triggers a rapid and massive influx of a protein called tubulin into the transmission body .
the transmission body then bursts open , dispersing helper protein - virus particle complexes throughout the cell , where they become more accessible to aphids .
this series of events increases viral transmission rates twofold to threefold .
the results show that a virus can detect insect vectors , likely by using the sensory system of its host , and trigger a response that boosts viral uptake and thus transmission .
this is a novel concept in virology .
it will be important to discover whether similar mechanisms are used by other viruses , including those that infect animals and humans .

introduction transmission is a pivotal step in the infection cycle of viruses : it controls the passage from one host to another and is thus essential for dissemination .
this step can represent a significant bottleneck for the infection cycle , since it is common for only a small proportion of the countless viral genomes produced to be passed on to a new host in a transmission event ; for example , only one to three of the many transmissible genomes initiate a new infection after potato virus y transmission ( moury et al. , 2007 ) .
it is thus expected that viruses have adapted their life cycle and developed sophisticated strategies to optimize their transmission .
whereas non - viral pathogens are known to allocate resources for the production of transmission - specific morphs ( discussed in matthews , 2011 ) , surprisingly little is known for this mechanism regarding viruses ( for review see blanc et al. , 2011 ) .
some viruses are transmitted vertically to host offspring and others are transmitted by contact between hosts ( e.g. , by wind , water or physical contact ) , but most viruses rely on vectors for rapid proliferation within host populations ( for review see kuno and chang , 2005 ; blanc et al. , 2011 ; bak et al. , 2012 ) .
the most important vectors are found among the arthropods .
those with a piercing - sucking feeding behavior such as mosquitoes ( or other blood - feeding dipterans ) and ticks are especially significant for vertebrate viruses , and likewise aphids , white flies and other sap - feeding bugs are consequential for plant viruses .
these vectors are ideal , as their variety of mouth parts can puncture cells , blood vessels , and plant sap vessels with great precision , thus enabling efficient uptake and injection of pathogens without killing the host .
vector transmission can be classified into two main transmission modes .
in circulative transmission , the virus is taken up by the vector together with the nutrients ( e.g. , blood , plant sap , cell contents ) , where it actively crosses from the intestine into the vector interior .
then it cycles through the hemocoel ( the internal body cavity awash in hemolymph ) to the salivary glands , where the virus can be secreted together with the saliva into a new host .
the second transmission mode is alternatively referred to as mechanical transmission ( for human and animal viruses ) or non - circulative transmission ( for plant viruses ) .
in this transmission mode , the arthropod vector only briefly comes into contact with the virus , in which it transiently attaches to the vector mouth parts and is subsequently released ; an internalization step does not occur .
the viral proteins involved in this seemingly simple process have been well - described in the literature , often down to the molecular level ( for review see ng and falk , 2006 ) .
on the other hand , their precise roles during virus - acquisition by the vector remains largely unexplored ( for review see blanc et al. , 2011 ) .
cauliflower mosaic virus ( camv ) , the virus studied here , is a non - circulative virus transmitted by aphids .
camv binds to a receptor protein located at the tip of the aphid 's needle - like mouth parts , the stylets ( uzest et al. , 2007 , 2010 ) .
the camv transmissible complex is composed of the icosahedral viral particle ( containing the viral genome enclosed by a shell of capsid protein p4 ) , the virus - associated protein p3 , and finally the aphid - transmission factor or helper component , the viral protein p2 ( blanc et al. , 1993a ; leh et al. , 1999 ; plisson et al. , 2005 ) .
p2 is central to the virus 's transmission , as it links the virus particle to the aphid stylets through the interaction of its c - terminus with virus - associated p3 , as well as the linking of its n - terminus with the stylet receptor ( figure 1a ) .
interestingly , although p2 deletion mutants of camv are not transmissible by aphids , they are perfectly infectious when inoculated artificially to host plants .
this shows that the only role for p2 in the camv life cycle is virus - vector interaction .
p2 localizes exclusively to a specific cytoplasmic inclusion in infected plant cells , the transmission body ( tb , figure 1b ) .
there , p2 co - aggregates with the viral protein p3 to form a matrix in which some virus particles are embedded ; the existence of any cellular components within this matrix remains elusive ( espinoza et al. , 1991 ; drucker et al. , 2002 ) .
the tb - contained p3 is most likely dissimilar in conformation to the p3 associated with the virus particle , and has been suggested to play a role in tb structure and maintenance , but any details are yet unknown ( drucker et al. , 2002 ; hoh et al. , 2010 ) .
tbs are indispensable to this transmission , as it has previously been shown that aphids are unable to acquire the virus in their absence ( i.e. , p2 deletion mutants , woolston et al. , 1983 ) , as well as when tbs are malformed .
the p2 mutant , p2g94r ( described in khelifa et al. , 2007 ) , assists efficiently in the transmission of purified camv particles associated with p3 , when aphids are allowed to acquire all three components in vitro from suspensions across parafilm membranes .
however , when the p2g94r mutant is expressed in planta in the context of camv infection , it induces the formation of a misshaped tb ( for details see khelifa et al. , 2007 ) , preventing plant - to - plant transmission by the aphid vector .

the camv transmissible complex and the transmission body .
( a ) left : the camv transmissible complex comprises the virus particle , composed of capsid protein p4 ( yellow ) , virus - associated protein p3 ( blue ) and the helper component p2 ( red ) .
p2 binds via its c - terminus to p3 and via its n - terminus to a protein receptor localized in the stylet tips of the aphid vector ( middle and right ) .
( b ) infected cells contain many cytoplasmic virus factories ( vf ) , where most virus particles ( blue - yellow circles ) accumulate in a matrix composed of virus protein p6 ( grey ) , and a single transmission body ( tb ) .
the tb ( also cytoplasmic ) is composed of p2 ( red ) and p3 ( blue ) as well as scattered virus particles .
p3 in tbs is most likely in a conformation that differs from virus - associated p3 .
the spatial separation of the components of the transmissible complex ( p2 in the tb and most virus particles in vfs ) lead us to propose that they unite only at the moment of vector acquisition ( drucker et al. , 2002 ) .
cortical microtubules are designated in green and the cell wall in dark green .

( 2005 ) .
doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.00183.003 to understand camv acquisition , some knowledge of the unique feeding behavior of aphid vectors is required .
aphids feeding on plant leaves insert their stylets into the middle lamella that separates adjacent cells , and subsequently perform a series of brief test punctures into the epidermis and parenchyma cells ; this continues until eventually reaching the phloem where they can feed for long periods , provided the plant is a suitable host ( for review see fereres and moreno , 2009 ) .
most plant cells survive the initial test punctures , during which only minute amounts of cytoplasm are ingested .
camv and hundreds of other viral species can be acquired during this feeding behavior , but detailed events occurring within the punctured cell at the precise moment of stylet entry and how they result in virus acquisition are largely unknown .
in the example of camv , it is known that microtubules are involved in the generation of tbs at the onset of infection ( martiniere et al. , 2009 ) and that the microtubule depolymerizing drug oryzalin inhibits virus acquisition by aphids ( martiniere et al. , 2011a ) , but any details of the mode of action of oryzalin on tbs and how tbs function in virus transmission are still unclear .
here , we have analyzed the three - way interaction between camv , host plant cell , and aphid at the precise moment of the intracellular penetration of the stylets and imminent virus acquisition .
our study reveals an unforeseen capability of camv in that it senses - - probably by using the host cell machinery - - the aphid feeding , and then instantly produces a transmissible form for uptake by the insect .
results different tb forms are detected in infected plant cells at the beginning of this study was the observation that several different tb phenotypes could be discerned in infected tissues , as viewed by double - labeling experiments using antibodies against the tb marker p2 and the microtubule protein alpha - tubulin .
thus , typical tbs were detected , and these were rather large ( 2 - 5 mum in diameter ) and mostly ovoid single cytoplasmic inclusions , having a cortex heavily labeled by p2 antibody and a less intensely labeled interior .
most importantly , little if any tubulin was detected in this regular form of the tb ( figure 2a ) .
interestingly , we also observed a second class of tbs that was phenotypically nearly identical , with the exception that tubulin had greatly accumulated in their centers ( figure 2b ) .
even more surprisingly , we were unable to detect tbs in some cells ; at best , small p2 foci without the typical tb structure were visible ( hereafter referred to as fragmented tbs ) .
instead , most p2 decorated the microtubule network in these cells ( a p2 distribution pattern hereafter designated as ' mixed - networks' and referring to mixed p2 - tubulin networks ; figure 2c ) .
a common point among these three tb phenotypes was that their occurrence varied greatly from one experiment to the next .
depending on the tissue preparation , anywhere from almost none to practically all of the tbs contained tubulin ; the proportion of cells containing mixed - networks also varied from one experiment to another .
to account for these observations , we hypothesized that , among the different tb morphologies observed ( hereafter referred to as ' morphs ') , the tubulin - loaded ( tub +| tb ) and mixed - network phenotypes were induced by unidentified stresses during leaf handling , whereas the tubulin - less phenotype ( tub - | tbs ) corresponded to unstressed ' standby ' tbs found under normal conditions .
as the only known role for tbs is in transmission , this further raised the question of whether and how the presence of tubulin within tbs impacts transmission by aphids .
to investigate this phenomenon , we first aimed to identify artificial stresses that could trigger specific transformation of standby tbs into tub +| tbs and mixed - networks .
heat - shock , wounding and co2 exposure all induced tb transformation ( figure 2d - f and figure 2 - - figure supplement 1 ) .
quantification of the various tb morphs ( figure 3 ) established that all three treatments induced tub +| tbs .
however , mixed - networks ( co - existing with tub +| tbs and fragmented tbs ) were significantly increased only in wounded or co2 - exposed leaves , and were rarely observed in heat - shocked or untreated leaves .
this indicates that the different stresses had different and specific effects on tbs .

immunofluorescence of infected leaves against p2 ( red ) and alpha - tubulin ( green ) , with co - labeling appearing as yellow / orange , reveals the different tb forms : ( a ) a tubulin - less tb ( arrow ) , ( b ) a tub +| tb ( arrow ) and ( c ) mixed - networks .
images show confocal projections ; insets show optical single sections from the tbs indicated by the arrows in ( a ) and ( b ) , and of the enclosed zone in ( c ) .
the orange arrows in the insets mark the line scans and the direction used to create the profiles of p2 ( red ) and tubulin ( green ) label intensity , shown to the right of the insets .
the line scans show that the tb in ( a ) contains hardly any tubulin , whereas the tb in ( b ) is heavily tubulin - labeled , revealing stronger tubulin labeling in the center of the tb than at the cortex .
finally , the distributions of p2 and tubulin labels colocalize in the mixed - networks shown in ( c ) .
the intensities are indicated in arbitrary units ( au ) since the acquisition conditions were not identical for the different samples .
( d - f ) stress induces tb transformation .
immunofluorescence labeling ( p2 in red , tubulin in green , dapi nucleic acid stain in blue ) of infected leaves after the indicated stress treatment shows that heat shock ( d ) induces only tub +| tbs , whereas wounding stress ( e ) and exposure to co2 ( f ) additionally induce tb fragmentation ( as revealed by the small red or orange foci in e and f ) and mixed - networks .
the upper panels of ( d - f ) show confocal projections , and the lower panels show selected optical single sections .
for heat shock ( d ) , two individual sections representing a median section through each of the two encircled tbs are shown .
in ( e - f ) , the arrows indicate filamentous p2 labeling that is continuous with microtubule labeling , and the arrowheads point to small p2 aggregates in the vicinity of microtubules .

quantitative analysis of the different tb morphs induced under stress conditions .
leaf samples were either left untreated ( control ) , exposed for 2 h at 37degreesc ( heat shock ) , exposed for 15 min to co2 atmosphere ( co2 exposure ) , cut with a razor blade and then fixed within 10 s ( wounding ) , or fixed first and then cut with a razor blade ( wounding after fixation ) .
all leaf samples were then processed in parallel for immunostaining against p2 and alpha - tubulin and scored for the occurrence of the different tb morphs : ' standby ' tub - | tbs ( turquoise ) , ' activated ' tub +| tbs ( yellow ) or mixed - networks ( red ) .
results are from three independent experiments and the total number of tbs and networks counted for each condition were control ( 284 ) , heat shock ( 293 ) , co2 exposure ( 282 ) , wounding stress ( 313 ) , and 288 in tissues wounded after fixation .

doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.00183.013 having access to an experimental system to specifically induce tb transformation , we next examined what role ( s ) the different tb morphs might play in camv aphid - transmission .
here , we pursued three complementary objectives : i ) to characterize the dynamics of tb transformation ; ii ) to investigate whether aphid feeding activity can trigger this transformation ; and iii ) to test whether tb transformation is required for successful camv transmission .
tb dynamics occur on a fast time scale for tb changes to have any biological relevance in camv acquisition by aphid vectors , they must happen fast enough to be compatible with the duration of the intracellular penetration of the aphid stylets during test probes , that is , within ~ 10 s. to estimate the speed of tb transformation , we first tested wounding stress by inflicting cuts with a razor blade on infected turnip leaves .
the tissue was then fixed immediately (~ 10 s ) and the tb phenotype analyzed by immunofluorescence .
tub +| tbs and mixed - networks were detected readily at the wounding sites ; by contrast , the cells of control tissue , or tissue wounded after fixation , predominantly harbored standby tbs ( figure 3 ) .
we next evaluated the kinetics of tubulin entry into tbs .
the surface of a camv - infected arabidopsis leaf expressing genetically tagged gfp - tubulin ( gfp - tua6 ; ueda et al. , 1999 ) was touched with a microelectrode , and the response of tbs in epidermis cells was recorded using confocal time - lapse macroscopy .
in the event of a fast entry of tubulin into tb , we should expect to observe a rapid appearance of fluorescent foci , corresponding to tub +| tbs within these cells .
figure 4a and movie 1 reveal the detection of gfp - tubulin in tbs as early as ~ 5 s after microelectrode impact ; fluorescence in these inclusions reached a maximum and stabilized within ~ 10 s. similar results were obtained in ~ 50 % of all infected cells tested ( table 1 ) .
contrarily , gfp - tubulin formed a diffuse fluorescent cloud at the impact site in healthy control cells , in line with previous reports ( hardham et al. , 2008 ) ; fast appearance of tubulin inclusions as in infected cells was never observed .
subsequently , we examined whether the tubulin within tbs is exchanged with that of the cytoplasm , by measuring gfp - tubulin turnover in tub +| tbs in fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments ( frap ) .
photo - bleached gfp - tubulin in tbs was rapidly replaced by fresh cytoplasmic gfp - tubulin ( figure 4b - d ) , suggesting that this protein circulates continuously between tub +| tb and the cytoplasm .
taken together , these results indicate that the appearance of both tub +| tbs and mixed - networks is fast enough to occur during an aphid puncture , and that there is a dynamic equilibrium between cytosolic and tb - contained tubulin .

tubulin influx into tbs occurs on a rapid time scale .
( a ) kinetics of tubulin entry into tbs .
the epidermis of camv - infected arabidopsis leaves expressing gfp - tagged alpha - tubulin ( arabidopsis gfp - tua6 ) was touched with a microelectrode tip ( yellow ) , and the effect of the impact recorded by time - lapse confocal macroscopy .
gfp - tubulin fluorescence is shown in green , chloroplast fluorescence in orange / red .
negative and positive time points are before and after the microelectrode - epidermis contact , respectively .
the red circle denotes the impact zone , and the three arrows point to newly formed gfp - tubulin inclusions .
the blue asterisk indicates a reference epidermis cell that did not change its z - position during the time lapse recording and can be used as a landmark for orientation .
( b - d ) tubulin cycles between tbs and the cytoplasm .
arabidopsis gfp - tua6 plants were infected with camv and the epidermis was screened for rare spontaneously occurring tub +| tbs ( no deliberate stress treatment was inflicted on the leaf ) ; these were identified by the characteristic shape of the fluorescent tubulin - containing inclusions ( see figure 2 - - figure supplement 1 ) .
the gfp - tubulin in these tub +| tbs was photobleached , and the recovery of the gfp fluorescence ( due to replacement by fresh cytoplasmic gfp - tubulin ) was recorded by time lapse microscopy .
( b ) microscopic images of a typical frap experiment .
the first picture shows a gfp - tubulin - containing tub +| tb before photobleaching .
the dashed circle in the second picture indicates the photobleached zone at t = 0 s , and the following pictures show recovery of the gfp - fluorescence at indicated time points after photobleaching .
( c - d ) the graphs show quantifications of fluorescence recovery : after photobleaching of tbs ( c ) , and after photobleaching of a cytoplasmic zone as a control of free tubulin diffusion ( d ) .
the fluorescence levels were normalized ( 100 % = fluorescence before bleaching , 0 % = fluorescence just after bleaching ) .
for the two quantification graphs , frap trend lines ( red ) were calculated from seven frap experiments on gfp - tubulin - containing tbs , or from 18 frap experiments on cytoplasmic zones .
the difference in t ( 1 / 2 ) for fluorescence recovery between tbs and the cytoplasm was highly significant ( p < 0.0001 , t - test with n = 18 for tbs and n = 21 for cytoplasm ) .
in contrast , the difference in the mobile fractions , that is , the percentage of exchangeable gfp - tubulin , the so - called mobile fraction , was not significant ( p = 0.504 , t - test with n = 18 for tbs and n = 21 for cytoplasm ) .
these results indicate that tubulin cycles between the cytoplasm and tbs , albeit at much slower rates than free diffusion in the cytoplasm .

a large fluorescent inclusion detected within 30 s or less was considered to be a wound - related tubulin entry into tb. in roughly half the experiments using infected tissue , rapid formation of large fluorescent inclusions was observed ; in the other experiments , either no reaction occurred or formation of diffuse fluorescent clouds prevailed .
in healthy controls , most cells responded with the appearance of diffuse tubulin clouds , as previously reported ( hardham et al. , 2008 ) ; rapid appearance of tubulin inclusions was never observed .
tb transformation follows a precise temporal order the above experiments demonstrating the existence of distinct tb morphs , we next turned our attention to the possible transformation of one form into another , and aimed to establish a chronology of tb morphological changes .
to facilitate tracking , we used infected protoplasts to screen for various conditions that could induce tb transformation ( table 2 ) , including various physical , chemical and biological stresses .
these wide - ranging cell treatments showed that of all the tested stresses , only heat , the chemical sodium azide , compacting of cells by sedimentation and carbon dioxide ( co2 ) induced tb transformation .
as in leaves , heat treatment of protoplasts only induced tub +| tbs ( data not shown ) , whereas co2 and azide stimulated tub +| tbs as well as mixed - networks ( figure 5a,b ) .
the kinetics of tb transformations followed a precise order : first , standby tbs are loaded with tubulin , and then mixed - networks and tubulin - containing tb fragments appear , at the expense of tub - | tbs .
after 5 min ( co2 treatment ) or 40 min ( azide treatment ) most cells displayed mixed - networks ( figure 5c,d ) .
a most remarkable property of the tbs was their rapid reversion from the mixed - network phenotype back to tubulin - less tbs ; this was provoked either after substituting normal air for co2 ( figure 5e ) , or after removing azide from the culture medium ( figure 5f ) .
moreover , it was possible to induce several consecutive rounds of tb transformation in the mixed - networks , as well as reversion to the same cell suspension , by continually relieving and resubmitting cells to stress ( figure 5e ) .

source data for figure 5f doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.00183.026 virus particles are also redistributed onto mixed - networks these time series experiments reveal p2 relocalization , from tbs to microtubules , following the application of different stresses. are virus particles , the other major component of the camv transmissible complex , also distributed onto the mixed - networks ?
to answer this question , we carried out immunofluorescence of the mixed - networks using a camv capsid protein antibody .
figure 6a shows that capsid protein localizes to cytoplasmic inclusions ( which are most likely virus factories ) in unstressed cells .
under conditions that trigger the formation of the mixed - networks , that is , co2 ( figure 6b ) or azide treatment ( figure 6c ) , p4 label colocalized with microtubules .
quantification of this observation ( figure 6d ) indicates that almost all cells displayed p4 networks after stress treatment .
nearly the same proportion of cells contained p2 or p4 networks after treatment with co2 or azide ( compare figure 6d with figure 5c,d ) , which suggested that mixed - networks are also associated with virus particles .
we confirmed this by electron - and immunogold microscopy , which showed ( in treated cells ) that cortical microtubules displaying p2 were indeed also decorated heavily with camv particles ( figure 7a - c ) .
finally , we also examined the ultrastructure of standby and tub +| tbs .
the latter were induced by heat shock and then the tissues prepared for electron microscopy .
figure 7d - g shows that tbs consist of an electron - lucent matrix in which some virus particles are embedded as previously reported ( espinoza et al. , 1991 ; drucker et al. , 2002 ) .
in control tbs , the virus particles seemed either to be distributed evenly throughout the tb matrix ( figure 7d ) or to be more concentrated at their cortex ( figure 7f ) .
heat - shocked tbs displayed similar tb phenotypes ( figure 7e,g ) and we could not observe any flagrant differences in tb phenotype between heat - shock - induced tub +| tbs and control tbs .
this corresponded to the results obtained by fluorescence microscopy ( figure 2d,e ) where likewise no obvious differences between the two tb morphs were observed .

the split channel representations and merges as well as the p4 and alpha - tubulin profiles obtained by scanning the lines indicated by the orange arrows show that the two stress treatments induced relocalization of capsid protein p4 from inclusions onto microtubules .

for scale bars , ( a - c ) : 100 nm ; ( e - g ) : 250 nm. doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.00183.032 taken together , these results demonstrate that mixed - network formation is always preceded by a massive entry of tubulin into the standby tb , which in itself does not induce a major ultrastructure change .
however , under specific stress conditions such as azide or co2 ( but not heat - shock ) , this tubulin entry can be followed by a total disruption of the tb. this includes an even dispersion of the components of the camv transmissible complex ( i.e. , p2 and virus particles ) onto microtubules throughout the cortical cytoplasm .
this redistribution might render the camv transmissible complexes more readily accessible to aphid vectors .
aphid behavior triggers tb transformation the results in figures 3 - 5 show that standby tbs can transform reversibly into tub +| tbs , and then again into mixed - networks , on a time scale that is fully compatible with aphid intracellular probing ( fereres and moreno , 2009 ) .
however , in all of the above cases , tb transformations were induced by artificial stresses and might not reflect a ' natural ' induction of tb changes in aphid - infested plants .
we therefore aimed to determine whether aphid feeding activity by itself triggers tb transformation .
accordingly , we developed a protocol that simultaneously allows observation of the tb phenotype in infected cells and the discrimination of cells , based on whether or not they had been in direct contact with aphid stylets .
for this procedure , aphids were allowed to feed on infected leaves for 15 min , before the leaf was fixed and subsequently screened by confocal microscopy .
we then identified , by their auto - fluorescence , the salivary sheaths that remain in the tissue after aphid removal , and which precisely document the path followed by the stylets ( miles , 1968 ) .
in addition , we identified by immunofluorescence the different tb morphs in plant cells that were either in close contact or farther away from these sheaths .
standby tbs were predominantly detected in uninfested tissues , or in infested tissues greater than 15 mum from the stylet track ( figure 8a ) .
in contrast , cells of infested leaves within a 15 mum perimeter of salivary sheaths often displayed typical mixed - networks , fragmented tbs and tub +| tbs ( figure 8b,c ) .
mixed - networks in cells close to the stylet track were also loaded with virus particles , as indicated by positive p4 capsid protein label of microtubules ( figure 8d ) .
quantification of the aphid - induced effect showed that 30 - 40 % of tbs in cells in contact with a stylet track displayed a modified tb phenotype , whereas 99 % of tbs in cells found more than one cell layer away from this track remained in the standby state ( figure 8e ) .
in parallel experiments , aphids were removed after the 15 - min feeding period and the leaves were allowed to recover for 2 h before analysis .
this intriguingly provoked the aphid - induced mixed - networks to revert back to standby tbs , as demonstrated by the strong decrease in the number of modified tbs close to the stylet tracks ( figure 8e ) .
this resembled the reversion observed in protoplasts , upon relief from either azide or co2 treatment ( figure 5e,f ) .
taken together , these results show that the probing activity of aphid stylets is a robust trigger of tb transformation , and that these aphid - induced tb changes are completely reversible .

( e ) aphids trigger tb transformation , and this transformation is reversible .
aphids were placed for 15 min on infected leaves .
following this , the leaves were fixed immediately and processed for immunofluorescence ( 15 - min aphid infestation ) , or the aphids were removed and the leaves were processed 2 h later ( aphids removed ) .
the tb phenotype ( standby tub - | tbs , tub +| tbs and mixed - networks ) was scored next to salivary sheaths ( 0 - 15 mum ) and in surrounding tissue ( 15 - 100 mum ) .
tub +| tbs and mixed - networks were predominantly observed close to salivary sheaths in freshly aphid - infested tissue .
the effect was highly significant ( p < 0.0001 , glm , df = 1 , chi2 = 194.59 , n = 3 ) .
tub +| tbs and mixed - networks reverted back to ' stand - by ' tub - | tbs 2 h after aphid removal , indicating that tb activation is reversible .

doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.00183.037 tb transformation enables efficient transmission in order to be biologically relevant , aphid - induced tb morphs ( tub +| tbs and / or mixed - networks ) should display a significant impact on camv transmission .
we therefore investigated whether tb transformation is required for aphid - transmission of camv .
assessing the effect of tb transformation on transmission was however not straightforward , since aphids themselves provoke tb transformation .
as a possible means to circumvent this problem , we observed while quantifying tb morphs ( figure 8e ) that only 30 - 40 % of the tbs had transformed after contact with the stylets .
we thus reasoned that a pre - treatment of infected cells that would substantially increase the proportion of modified tbs prior to aphid feeding should ' prime ' these cells for virus acquisition and enhance the camv transmission rate .
to investigate this , we first induced mixed - networks in protoplasts with azide , and then used the cells in aphid transmission experiments .
we observed significantly elevated transmission rates compared to transmission from control cells that displayed mainly standby tbs ( figure 9a ) .
the effect was not caused by altered aphid behavior resulting from the presence of azide in the protoplast medium , because the chemical had no effect in transmission experiments in which aphids were allowed to acquire camv instead from cells from suspensions containing purified virus , recombinant p2 and p3 ( figure 9b ) .
azide also had no effect on protoplast viability under the conditions used ( figure 9c ) .
taken together , these results rule out a possible confounding effect of azide , and clearly indicate that it was the presence of mixed - networks that lead to increased transmission rates .
in order to compare this situation with that of intact plant tissues , we examined infected co2 - treated or heat - shocked leaves in transmission assays .
under heat shock treatment , tb transformation appeared incomplete and arrested at the tub +| tb stage , as reported above ( figure 2d and figure 2 - - figure supplement 1 ) .
the heat - shocked leaves did not perform any better than controls in aphid - transmission tests ( figure 9d ) , indicating that tubulin entry into tbs alone is not sufficient to enhance transmission .
in contrast , co2 induced complete tb transformation into mixed - networks ( figure 2e ) .
moreover , significantly enhanced transmission rates were recorded when co2 - treated leaves were used in aphid transmission experiments ( figure 9e ) .
10.7554 / elife.00183.038 figure 9 .
tb transformation correlates with enhanced transmission efficiency .
( a ) azide enhances transmission from protoplasts .
aphids were allowed to acquire camv from infected protoplasts that displayed mixed - networks induced by azide .
they were then transferred to healthy test plants for inoculation , and infected plants were counted 3 weeks later .
the difference in transmission was highly significant ( p < 0.0001 , hierarchical glm model , table 3 and figure 9 - - source data 1 ) .
( b ) azide does not affect aphid behavior .
to rule out an unwanted effect of azide on aphid viability and behavior , aphids were membrane - fed solutions containing purified virus particles , recombinant p2 and p3 , in the presence or absence of azide , and then transferred to healthy test plants for inoculation .
transmission rates were determined 3 weeks later by scoring infected plants .
data from one experiment are shown , using three different virus preparations as a virus source for each condition .
see figure 9 - - source data 2 for details .
( c ) azide does not affect protoplast viability .
protoplasts were incubated for 1 h ( the duration of a transmission test ) in the presence or absence of 0.02 % azide , and then protoplast viability was determined with the fda test ( widholm , 1972 ) .
data from one out of two experiments are shown .
the difference in viability was insignificant in this experiment ( p = 0.0658 , n = 6 , mann - whitney test ) and also in the second experiment .
see figure 9 - - source data 3 for all data .
( d ) heat shock does not enhance camv transmission .
leaves from gfp - tua6 arabidopsis either received heat shock (+) or did not ( - ) .
the presence of tub +| tbs was verified by fluorescence microscopy and the leaves were then used in aphid transmission assays .
no significant difference in transmission was observed in either of two independent experiments ( p = 0.73 and p = 0.08 , respectively , hierarchical glm model , see table 4 and figure 9 - - source data 4 ) .
( e ) co2 enhances camv transmission .
leaves with mixed - networks induced by co2 were used in plant - to - plant aphid transmission experiments .
co2 - treated leaves performed significantly better in transmission tests than controls ( p = 0.0025 , hierarchical glm model , see table 5 and figure 9 - - source data 5 ) .

as we found a non - significant interaction between experiments and treatments ( glm , df = 2 , chi2 = 2.92 , p = 0.23 ) , the three experiments were pooled for analysis ( line named ' global ') .
co2 induced a significant increase in the transmission rate compared to the controls without co2 ( hierarchical glm model , df = 1 , chi2 = 9.12 , p = 0.0025 ) , with 13.0 % ( 95 % ci : 9.4 - 17.0 %) for control in ambient atmosphere and 22.4 % ( 17.8 - 27.2 %) for co2 - treatments .
n : number of repetitions per experiment ; lci , uci : lower and upper limits of confidence intervals , respectively .
we conclude from these results that the sole entry of tubulin into tbs is insufficient to explain increased transmission .
furthermore , we hypothesize that the higher accessibility of camv to its aphid vector can be explained by microtubules serving as a scaffold for the rapid redistribution of p2 and virus particles over the entire cell .
if this were true , then depolymerization of microtubules by oryzalin should both prevent the formation of mixed - networks , and significantly decrease the transmission rate .
we have previously shown that oryzalin diminishes transmission from infected protoplasts ( martiniere et al. , 2011a ) .
consistent with these results , we show here that oryzalin induces tub +| tbs within 15 min , but prevents mixed - network formation ( figure 9f,g ) .
to further confirm the role of tb changes in aphid - transmission of camv , we pursued an independent approach and examined a camv mutant impaired in transmission .
this mutant , camv p2 - tc , harbors a 7 - amino acid insertion , including a tetracysteine tag ( griffin et al. , 1998 ) at position 100 of the p2 protein .
the mutant virus was fully infectious as compared to wild type virus ; furthermore , the p2 - tc protein as well as viral proteins p3 , p4 and p6 accumulated to similar levels in infected plants ( figure 10a ) .
however , in comparison to wild type tbs , this mutant induced tbs ( tb - tcs ) that seemed to be smaller , with a more regular rounded shape , and a more pronounced p2 - rich cortex , as revealed by immunofluorescence ( figure 10b ) .
heat shock induced an influx of tubulin into tb - tcs , and photobleached gfp - tubulin contained in tb - tc was observed to be exchanged with cytoplasmic tubulin in frap experiments ( figure 10c ) , although the kinetics differed from tubulin replacement in wild type tbs ( compare figure 10c with figure 4b ) .
thus the tb of the p2 - tc mutant bears some similarity to wild type tb. nevertheless , camv p2 - tc was completely non - transmissible in plant - to - plant transmission experiments ( figure 10d ) .
this could be due to a defect of tb - tc in undergoing correct transformation upon aphid puncture ; an alternative is that this is due to a lack of interaction between the mutant p2 - tc protein and either virus particles or aphid stylets .
to distinguish between these possibilities , we first tested whether p2 - tc protein can mediate the binding of virus particles to the aphid stylets .
one way to test this is to allow aphids to feed on suspensions containing recombinant p2 - tc , p3 and purified virus particles through membranes , before they are transferred to test plants for inoculation .
binding of transmissible complexes acquired by the aphids from the feeding solution is then scored by counting the number of successful transmission events , that is , the number of infected test plants .
although the transmission rates were significantly lower than that obtained with wild type p2 , the p2 - tc mutant protein was indeed active in such assays , retaining around 50 % of the wild p2 activity ( figure 10e ) .
we thus reasoned that defects in p2 - tc binding to virus particles or stylets can only partially explain the complete failure in plant - to - plant transmission of the p2 - tc mutant , and that a failure in tb - tc transformation may also be involved .
to investigate this possibility , we allowed aphids to infest camv - p2tc - infected leaves for 15 min .
the leaves were then processed for immunofluorescence against p2 and alpha - tubulin , and scored for the tb phenotype in cells found close to and farther away from the salivary sheaths .
figure 10f,g demonstrates that only standby tbs were detected , and not tub +| tbs or mixed - networks .
this result is further evidence for a strong positive correlation between the appearance of mixed - networks ( i.e. , tb transformation ) and successful aphid transmission , and presents direct biological evidence in support of our transmission hypothesis .

the p2 - tc mutant of camv is inactive in plant - to - plant transmission .
( a ) accumulation of viral proteins in camv p2 - tc - infected plants .
western blot analysis of total leaf extracts shows that virus factory protein p6 , the three forms of capsid protein p4 , as well as p2 and p3 accumulate to similar levels in plants infected with wild type camv ( b - ji ) or the p2 - tc mutant ( tc ) .
rub = rubisco loading control stained with ponceau red .
( b ) camv p2 - tc - infected plants display tbs .
confocal projection of infected leaf sections labeled for p2 ( red ) and alpha - tubulin ( green ) shows that the camv mutant p2 - tc forms tbs ( arrows ) that are smaller and more regular than wild type tbs .
nuclei are counterstained with dapi ( blue ) .
the optical single sections used for the projection are presented in figure 10 - - source data 1 .
( c ) tubulin turnover in p2 - tc mutant tbs .
arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing gfp - tubulin were infected with the camv p2 - tc mutant .
leaf epidermis was screened by fluorescence microscopy for gfp - tubulin inclusions that were identified as tbs based on their typical shape .
the gfp - tubulin was photobleached in these tbs , and the recovery of the gfp - fluorescence ( due to replacement of the photobleached gfp - tubulin by fresh tubulin ) was recorded in frap experiments .
the graph shows recovery kinetics from t = 0 s ( time point of photobleach ) onwards .
the fluorescence levels were normalized ( 100 % = fluorescence before bleaching , 0 % = fluorescence just after bleaching ) .
the red trend line was calculated from nine experiments .
data points from the nine experiments are indicated as blue dots .
these results indicate that tubulin cycles between the cytoplasm and mutant tbs , albeit with different kinetics than for wild type tbs ( compare with figure 4c ) .
compared to wild type tbs , the t ( 1 / 2 ) for fluorescence recovery was significantly slower ( p < 0.0001 , t - test with n = 21 for wild type tbs and n = 23 for tc - tbs ) and the proportion of the mobile fraction was significantly higher in p2 - tc tbs ( p = 0.0001 , t - test with n = 21 for wild type tbs and n = 23 for tc - tbs ) .
refer to figure 10 - - source data 2 and figure 4 - - source data 1 ( wild type tbs ) for data sets .
( d ) the mutant p2 - tc does not support plant - to - plant transmission .
aphids were placed for 15 min on camv wild type - infected ( b - ji ) or p2 - tc - infected ( tc ) leaves and then transferred to healthy test plants for inoculation .
infected plants were scored 3 weeks later .
pooled data are shown from two independent experiments using 12 different leaves for each condition .
no statistical analysis was performed , as the effect of the p2 - tc mutant on plant - to - plant transmission was total ( no transmission from p2 - tc - infected plants was observed ) .
see figure 10 - - source data 3 for the data sets .
( e ) the p2 - tc protein itself is active in transmission .
recombinant wild type p2 ( b - ji ) or mutant p2 - tc ( tc ) were mixed together with recombinant p3 protein and purified camv particles .
aphids were allowed to feed on the suspensions across membranes for 15 min and were then transferred to healthy test plants for inoculation .
infected plants were counted 3 weeks later .
the histogram shows that p2 - tc supported aphid transmission of camv under these conditions , although this was significantly reduced as compared to the wild type p2 ( p = 0.02 , n = 8 from two independent experiments , mann - whitney test ) .
see figure 10 - - source data 4 for data .
( f ) aphid stylet activity does not trigger tb transformation in camv p2 - tc - infected leaves .
aphids were allowed to feed on camv - p2 - tc - infected leaves for 15 min .
the tissue was then processed for immunofluorescence against p2 ( red ) and alpha - tubulin ( green ) ; nuclei were stained with dapi ( blue ) .
the confocal projection in ( f ) indicates that cells in contact with a salivary sheath ( sheath ) display tubulin - less tbs ( arrows ) .
chloroplasts are displayed in magenta to better distinguish the cells .
please see figure 10 - - source data 5 for the confocal single sections used to create the projection .
( g ) quantitative analysis of the tb forms of camv - p2 - tc in aphid - infested tissue reveals the absence of tub +| tbs and mixed - networks , both close to salivary sheaths ( 0 - 15 mum ) and farther away ( 15 - 100 mum ) .
data shown are from three independent experiments where a total of 510 tbs were analyzed ( see figure 10 - - source data 6 for details ) .
as the effect was total , no statistical analysis was performed .

doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.00183.055 discussion combined , our results establish that the tb is a dynamic structure , which in the presence of an aphid vector can react immediately to promote camv transmission ( figure 11 ) .
transmission is controlled by the different tb morphs .
the tubulin - less tb found in normal ' unstressed ' cells has been well - described over the past several decades ( shalla et al. , 1980 ; rodriguez et al. , 1987 ; espinoza et al. , 1991 ; blanc et al. , 1993b ; drucker et al. , 2002 ) , and here functions as a standby tb that ' anticipates' the vector arrival .
then , when aphids land on the plant and insert their stylets into tissues , camv uses the plant 's response during stylet entry to its advantage at a very early stage of the plant - aphid interaction .
this results in tbs that undergo dramatic , short - lived changes leading to the temporary redistribution of p2 and virus onto microtubules .
these hitherto overlooked tb alterations result in a reversible tb ' activation ' that optimizes virus acquisition .
the activation or increased transmission efficiency is probably due to the mixed - networks distributing p2 and virus homogeneously on microtubules throughout the cell periphery .
this could in turn facilitate virus acquisition : in this new configuration , p2 and the virus are more accessible to the vector during its random punctures , as compared to the remote localization of p2 in isolated tbs .
this hypothesis is supported by the observation that inhibition of mixed - network formation , either in the camv - p2tc mutant or pharmacologically by oryzalin , resulted in decreased transmission .
the converse situation also applies , as artificial induction of mixed - networks by co2 and azide were correlated strongly with increased transmission rates .
these results additionally indicate that the tb reaction is required for transmission .
10.7554 / elife.00183.056 figure 11 .
model of camv acquisition .
( a ) in an infected cell in the ' standby ' state , there are numerous virus factories ( vf ) containing most of the replicated virus particles ( yellow - blue circles ) , enclosed within a matrix of viral protein p6 ( grey ) .
this is accompanied in the cell by a mostly single transmission body ( tb ) , composed of a matrix containing all of the cell 's p2 ( red ) , co - aggregated with p3 ( blue ) and some virus particles .
microtubules are represented in green .
( b ) an aphid landing on an infected plant inserts its stylets into a cell to test the plant .
this causes a mechanical stress ( stylet movement ) and / or a chemical stress ( e.g. , elicited by saliva components ) .
this stress , symbolized by the yellow flashes , is immediately perceived by the plant and can induce subsequent defense responses .
the initial aphid recognition signal is transduced simultaneously in a tb response , characterized by an influx of tubulin ( green ) into the tb .
( c ) in a second step , the tb disintegrates rapidly ( within seconds ) , and all the p2 as well as some virus particles relocalize on the cortical microtubules as mixed - networks. whether or not the virus particles originate at the vfs , as presented here , is unknown .
transmissible p2 - virus complexes are now homogeneously distributed throughout the cell periphery , which significantly increases the chances of successful binding of p2 and virus to the stylets and thus transmission .
( d ) after departure of the aphid vector ( here loaded with p2 and virus ) , a new tb is reformed from the mixed - networks and is ready for another round of transmission .
doi : http :// dx.doi.org / 10.7554 / elife.00183.056 one enduring question that deserves further attention is precisely where the virus particles come from that are recruited onto the microtubules .
whereas the origin of microtubule - associated p2 is clearly the tb ( since the tb is the only source of p2 ) , the origin of the virus particles aligning on the microtubules is less clear .
they could derive either from the tb , which contains some virus particles , or from the many virus factories dispersed throughout the cytoplasm ( espinoza et al. , 1991 ; drucker et al. , 2002 ) .
we were also intrigued to observe that only certain stresses - - notably aphid feeding activity , wounding , azide and co2 - - could trigger tb transformation .
this reveals a certain level of specificity in tb activation , although it is more broad than the classical pattern recognition receptor - mediated defense responses of plants against pathogens ( including insects ) that are often species or even isolate - specific ( hogenhout and bos , 2011 ) .
this broad specificity is not surprising , since camv is transmitted by at least 30 different aphid species .
importantly , this suggests that the plant responses against aphids ( that are probably exploited by camv for the tb reaction ) are triggered by an elicitor common to all aphids. whether this elicitor triggers an innate plant immunity pathway or a separate perception / reaction cascade remains an open question .
the significance of this remarkable phenomenon described here extends beyond camv transmission to broader fields of research .
first , this opens up a fascinating new direction within virology , to explore whether other viruses form transmission morphs in response to vector - sensing by the host .
second , the transient accumulation of tubulin in tbs , followed by redistribution of tb contents on microtubules uncovers unforeseen capacities of tubulin / microtubule dynamics and raises further questions pertinent to cell biology .
for example : how can apparently soluble tubulin concentrate in the tb and what is its function there ?
does this serve as the source for the mixed - networks ?
most strikingly , our work reveals that a virus can detect external stresses ( probably by using its host 's perception system ) and respond in a way that is somewhat independent of the host 's response .
we propose naming this phenomenon : ' virus perceptive behavior ' .
this concept is nicely illustrated by three compelling observations made in this study .
first , tb transformation occurs while the host plant is still in the process of transducing the triggering signal .
this shows that the virus appropriates the host 's perception machinery itself , rather than relying upon downstream reactions that take tens of minutes ( or hours ) to manifest and establish local and systemic defense responses ( kusnierczyk et al. , 2008 ; de vos and jander , 2010 ) .
second , after transformation of the tb into mixed - networks , the fate of camv appears disconnected from the final host response .
indeed , within the time frame required for the host plant to respond to an aphid attack , mixed - networks have already served as a robust virus source for aphids , and have long since reverted back to standby tbs .
third , the response mechanisms themselves are also entirely different from the reported plant physiological responses to aphid attack .
these include callose deposition near the salivary sheaths and within sieve tubes ( villada et al. , 2009 ) , changes in gene expression patterns ( kusnierczyk et al. , 2008 ) , altered emission of volatile compounds ( de vos and jander , 2010 ) ; and the initiation of salicylic , abscisic , and jasmonic acid systemic defense pathways ( giovanini et al. , 2007 ; kusnierczyk et al. , 2008 ; de vos and jander , 2009 ) .
in contrast , the tb response seems to be restricted to a camv - specific and immediate diversion of tubulin / microtubules ( plus putative unknown associated partners ) for virus transmission , in a manner unlike anything described before. whether such viral perceptive behaviors play a role in the vector - transmission of other viruses is entirely unknown , and will thus be a question of great priority in the field of research on virus transmission .
viruses tightly regulate all the different steps of their life cycle , from intracellular replication and short - and long - distance intra - host movement , to inter - host spread .
in this sense , the ability to specifically trigger the ' transmission - mode ' at the right time and the right place seems like a valuable adaptation for avoiding the deleterious interference between these various functions .
on a more broad scope , our results highlight many unexpected research horizons to explore in the biology of these fascinating pathogens .
the possible instances in which viruses could react directly to cues from the host environment , the diversity of sensorial pathways that could be exploited in both animal and plant hosts , and the number of key life cycle steps that could be optimized accordingly all inspire questions that will shape future research directions in this field .
finally , aside from being an academic challenge , this phenomenon also represents a potential achilles heel in viral transmission that could lead to novel virus control strategies .
materials and methods plants , viruses and inoculation turnip plants ( brassica rapa cv .
' just right ') and transgenic arabidopsis thaliana col0 plants with a gl1 marker expressing gfp - tua6 under control of the 35s promoter ( ueda et al. , 1999 ) were alternatively used as camv hosts , depending on the experiment .
two - week - old plants were mechanically inoculated with wild - type camv strain cabb b - ji ( delseny and hull , 1983 ) or cabb b - ji deltap2 as described in martiniere et al .
( 2009 ) , and processed as indicated at 14 days post infection ( dpi ) .
in order to obtain the mutant virus cabb b - ji p2 - tc ( referred to as p2 - tc in the text ) , the oligonucleotides 5 ' - tcgagttgctgtccaggatgttgc - 3 ' and 5 ' - tcgagcaacatcctggacagcaac - 3 ' were annealed .
this created xhoi - compatible restriction sites at the two extremities of the then double - stranded oligonucleotide that were used for insertion into the unique xhoi site in the cabb b - ji genome cloned into the pca24 plasmid ( delseny and hull , 1983 ) .
positive clones were identified by pcr and verified by sequencing .
they contained a seven - amino - acid insertion at amino acid position 100 of the p2 open reading frame , coding for a tetracysteine tag ( ccpgcc [ griffin et al. , 1998 ]) as well as an additional serine .
aphids a non - viruliferous clonal myzus persicae population was reared under controlled conditions ( 22 / 18degreesc day / night with a photoperiod of 14 / 10 h day / night ) on eggplant and cultivated by g. labonne ( inra , montpellier ) .
the population was started from a single virginiparous female .
recombinant p2 - tc to produce recombinant p2 - tc using the sf9 / baculovirus system , the tetracysteine sequence and an additional serine were introduced into the unique xhoi site in the p2 coding region of plasmid p119 - p2 , using the same strategy as for cloning camv - p2tc described above .
recombinant baculovirus was obtained by homologous recombination as described in blanc et al .
( 1993b ) .
infected sf9 cells were harvested 48 h after inoculation and total cell extracts were prepared in ses buffer and stored at - 20degreesc until use .
isolation of protoplasts protoplasts were prepared from healthy or infected ( 14 dpi ) leaves of turnip plants as described in martiniere et al .
( 2009 ) .
briefly , leaves were sterilized by submerging them in 20 - fold diluted domestos solution ( http :// www.unilever.com ) for 3 min .
the leaves were then washed three times with water , prior to overnight incubation in protoplast medium m ( 0.5 m mannitol , 1 mm cacl2 , 10 mm mes , ph 5.8 ) containing freshly added 0.5 % cellulose ' onozuka ' r10 and 0.05 % macerozyme r10 ( both enzymes obtained from yakult , http :// www.yakult.co.jp / ypi /) .
protoplasts were separated from undigested tissue by filtration through miracloth ( http :// www.merckmillipore.com ) , and washed three times with buffer m by centrifugation at 80xg for 5 min in a swing - out rotor .
prior to treatments , protoplasts were maintained fourfold diluted in buffer m at room temperature with slow agitation ( 5 rpm ) for 2 h. drug and stress treatments the different drug treatments with respective experimental times were : 10 mum oryzalin ( 1 h ) , 0.02 % azide ( 40 min ) , or co2 atmosphere ( 15 min ) .
azide ( 100x concentration ) or oryzalin ( 1000x concentration ) stock solutions were added to water or dmso , respectively .
pure solvent was used as a control .
for co2 treatment , leaves or protoplasts were placed in a plastic box filled with co2 that was generated by sublimation of dry ice in water , contained in a small beaker in the box .
we visually confirmed the displacement of the water cloud initially created by the subliming co2 to assure that the heavier co2 had replaced the air ( no more water vapor visible ) ; only then was the plant material placed in the box .
we also verified that the dry ice did not lower the temperature of the atmosphere in the box .
for tb reversion , protoplasts were cycled every 15 min between the plastic box and standard bench - top conditions for the co2 treatment or the azide was removed by replacing the protoplast medium with fresh medium after centrifugation of the protoplasts for 5 min at 80xg in a swing - out rotor .
protoplast viability was verified by the fluorescein diacetate test ( widholm , 1972 ) .
for heat shock treatment , protoplasts or plants were placed in an incubator at 37degreesc .
to inflict wounding , leaves were cut with a new razor blade .
histology leaf segments ( 5 - to 7 - mm - long ) of turnip or arabidopsis were fixed in 1 % glutaraldehyde prepared in stabilizing buffer ( 50 mm hepes , ph 8 ) .
the tissue was then embedded in either steedman 's wax , as described in vitha et al .
( 2000 ) , or in 5 % agarose .
for the steedman 's wax method , the leaf segments were rinsed twice for 10 min each with 50 mm hepes ph 8 , followed by two 10 - min washes with pbs .
after dehydration through an ethanol series , the samples were infiltrated at 40degreesc with steedman 's wax by using a graded ethanol / wax series .
finally , the segments were embedded in pure steedman 's wax .
after polymerization of blocks at room temperature , a microtome was used to cut slices with a 14 - mum thickness .
for the agarose method , the leaf segments were rinsed twice for 5 min in pbs and then embedded in 5 % low melting temperature agarose .
finally , 50 mum sections were cut with a vibratome .
electron microscopy samples for electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy were processed as described in drucker et al .
( 2002 ) .
for transmission electron microscopy , infected leaves or agarose - embedded protoplasts were fixed with 4 % glutaraldehyde , postfixed with 2 % oso4 , and embedded in epon resin ( http :// www.emsdiasum.com ) .
for immunoelectron microscopy , protoplasts were fixed with 0.5 % glutaraldehyde and 2 % paraformaldehyde and embedded in lr gold resin ( http :// www.emsdiasum.com ) .
all primary antisera and secondary antibodies were used at 1:25 dilution .
the grids were observed in a jeol jem 100cx ii electron microscope ( http :// www.jeol.com ) operated at 60 - 80 kv. antisera the following antibodies or antisera were used : rabbit anti - p2 ( blanc et al. , 1993b ) , anti - p3 ( drucker et al. , 2002 ) , anti - p6 ( khelifa et al. , 2007 ) , monoclonal mouse anti - alpha - tubulin dm1a ( http :// www.sigmaaldrich.com ; blose et al. , 1984 ) , and rabbit anti - p4 ( http :// plant.neogeneurope.com ) .
for secondary antibodies , we used alexa 488 and alexa 594 conjugates ( http :// www.lifetechnologies.com ) or 10 nm colloidal gold conjugates ( http :// www.bbigold.com ) .
western blotting plant tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen , and the powder was resuspended in 2x laemmli buffer ( laemmli , 1970 ) and boiled for 5 min .
after brief centrifugation in a tabletop centrifuge ( 5 min at 16,000xg ) , aliquots were separated by sds / page using 12 % gels .
proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and antigens were revealed by the nbt - bcip reaction as described in drucker et al .
( 2002 ) .
immunofluorescence of protoplasts after treatments , protoplasts were fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0.5 m mannitol and 50 mm hepes ph 8 , and washed with ts buffer ( 50 mm tris , 150 mm nacl , ph 7.4 ) .
protoplasts were immobilized on polylysine - coated slides , incubated for 15 min with 0.2 % nabh4 , washed with ts and blocked with ts containing 5 % dry milk powder ( ts - m ) for 30 min .
the slides were incubated with primary antisera ( all diluted 1:250 in ts - m ) for at least 2 h. after two rinses with ts , slides were incubated for at least 2 h with secondary antibodies diluted 1:300 .
after two rinses with ts , slides were mounted in antifading medium , which optionally included dapi ( 50 ng / ml ) .
immunofluorescence of leaf sections the 14 - mum microtome sections were immobilized on polylysine - coated slides , incubated for 1 h with 0.2 % nabh4 , washed with ts and incubated for 90 min in an enzyme solution ( containing 2 % cellulose ' onozuka ' r10 , 1 % macerozyme r10 ) and 2 % driselase ( http :// www.sigmaaldrich.com , prepared in 10 mm mes ph 5.6 ) .
the 50 - mum vibratome sections were incubated for 1 h with 0.2 % nabh4 in a 24 - well plate .
all sections were then blocked with 3 % bsa or 5 % bsa in ts supplemented with 0.01 % tween20 for 30 min and incubated with primary antisera in 1 % bsa / 0.01 % tween20 in ts - m for at least 12 h at the following dilutions : 1:200 for rabbit anti - p2 and rabbit anti - p4 and 1:100 for mouse anti - alpha - tubulin .
after two rinses with ts or pbs , slides were incubated for at least 12 h with alexa fluor conjugates at a 1:200 dilution .
after two rinses with ts or pbs , slides were mounted as described above .
microscopy slides were observed with zeiss lsm510 or lsm700 ( http :// www.zeiss.com ) or leica sp2 ( http :// www.leica.com ) confocal microscopes operated in sequential mode to avoid crosstalk .
raw images were processed using lsm , zen or las software and final figures were prepared using gimp 2.6.11 ( http :// www.gimp.org ) and openoffice 3.4 ( http :// www.openoffice.org ) .
quantification of tb phenotype was performed by counting 200 - 300 cells in 10 different , randomly chosen microscopy fields per treatment .
transmission tests groups of about 500 aphids were placed inside copper rings covered with stretched parafilm m membranes ( http :// www.parafilm.com ) for a 1 h pre - acquisition period in a humid chamber .
then , either protoplasts or suspensions containing purified virus particles , p2 and p3 in ses buffer ( blanc et al. , 1993a ) were placed on the parafilm m and covered with a cover slip .
aphid were then allowed a 15 min acquisition feed through the parafilm membranes on the suspensions .
for plant - to - plant transmission experiments , aphids were transferred to an infected detached leaf for 1 - 5 min acquisition feeding .
afterwards , either 1 aphid ( fed on a leaf ) or 10 aphids ( fed on protoplasts or virus particles ) were transferred onto each turnip test plantlet for a 4 +/ - 1 h inoculation period ; 24 plants were inoculated per plant tray and 12 trays were used in a typical assay .
aphids were killed with 0.2 % pirimor g ( http :// www.certiseurope.fr ) as described in martiniere et al .
( 2011a ) .
finally , the fraction of symptomatic plants was scored by visual inspection 3 weeks later .
analyzing movement of gfp - tua6 in live cells by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( frap ) frap experiments were performed according to martiniere et al .
( 2011b ) on infected or healthy arabidopsis gfp - tu6 leaves using a zeiss lsm700 confocal microscope with a 63x na 1.4 oil - immersion objective .
leaf samples were mounted in 1 % low melting point agar to prevent focus shift .
twenty scans of the entire field of view were made at pre - bleach intensity , and then a circular 20 mum2 region of interest ( roi ) , which included a tb , was photobleached .
three iterations of the 488 - nm laser at 100 % intensity were used for the bleaching .
for recovery of the fluorescence in tbs , images were recorded for 110 s , with a 512 x 512 px picture size , a scan speed of 167 ms / frame and a delay between frames of 0.2 s. for controls , to account for fast tubulin diffusion in the cytosol , recovery was recorded in identical rois for only 5.9 s , with a 100 x 50 px picture size , a scan speed of 16 ms / frame and a delay between frames of 23 ms. we verified that the energy of the 488 - nm laser used for the post - bleach added no bleaching effect by recording a control region outside the bleaching roi .
the experiment was repeated 21 times for wild type tb bleaching , 23 times for tb - tc bleaching and 18 times in the case of cytoplasmic soluble tubulin .
average intensities in all rois including the background signal were measured using imagej 1.44p software ( http :// imagej.nih.gov / ij ) , before exporting data into microsoft excel 2007 ( http :// www.microsoft.com ) .
fluorescence recovery data was normalized as follows : in =(( it - imin )/( imax - imin )) x100,where in is normalized intensity , it is intensity at any time t , imin is the minimum intensity post bleach and imax is the mean intensity pre - bleach .
non - linear regression was used to model frap data .
in this case , a one - phase exponential curve was used : y ( t )= a exp ( - k )( t )+ b,where a , b and k are parameters of the curve and t is time. from this curve , the half time of recovery was calculated as t ( 1 / 2 ) = 0.69 / k. finally , t ( 1 / 2 ) was used to calculate the diffusion rate as d = ( 0.88 r2 )/( 4 t ( 1 / 2 )) , where d is the diffusion rate and r is the radius of the bleaching area .
robostylets ( microelectrode experiments ) a pulled glass microelectrode was fitted on a micromanipulator ( http :// www.prioruk.com ) and placed either on the stage of a leica confocal lsi macroscope equipped with a 0.56 - 16x zoom and a 5x objective or a zeiss lsm700 confocal microscope with a 10x objective .
either a whole potted plant ( visualized with the macroscope ) or a detached leaf taped to a slide and with a water - soaked paper wrapped around its stalk ( visualized with the microscope ) was placed under the objective .
the microelectrode was carefully brought up to the leaf , and the epidermis was touched or pierced .
the approach , the mechanical stress and the reaction of the plant leaf epidermis cell were all recorded by time lapse fluorescence microscopy using acquisition settings as described above for the lsm700 microscope , or excitation with a 488 - nm diode laser and an emission bandwidth from 505 - 550 nm for the lsi macroscope .
the pinholes were opened to record sections approximately with 20 - mum thickness , and the microscope settings were selected for minimal acquisition times at the expense of image quality .
statistical analysis for frap , d values were compared with a two - tailed t - test .
tb activation states close to and distant from salivary sheaths , as well as transmission rates , were analyzed using glm and hierarchical glm models with a binomial distribution .
for p2 - tc transmission experiments , the mann - whitney test was used .
to test for differences in tb states between wild type - infected and p2 - tc - infected tissue , a nominal logistic model was used since three parameters were analyzed .
statistical analyses were carried out using jmp 10 ( http :// www.jmp.com ) , r 2.9.2 ( http :// www.r - project.org ) and vassarstats ( http :// vassarstats.net /) software .
the p values < 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant .

an edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown , indicating the substantive concerns or comments ; minor concerns are not usually shown .
reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent ( see review process ) .
similarly , the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers .
thank you for choosing to send your work entitled " perceiving the outside world : a virus uses the host sensory system for instantaneous transmission by an insect vector " for consideration at elife .
your article has been evaluated by a senior editor , a reviewing editor , and 2 reviewers .
the following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission want to reveal their identity : thorsten nurnberger ( bre ) ; georg jander ( peer reviewer ) ; saskia hogenhout ( peer reviewer ) .
the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision .
our goal is to provide the essential revision requirements as a single set of instructions , so that you have a clear view of the revisions that are necessary for us to publish your work .
the discovery that aphid feeding and other stresses can trigger a tubulin - dependent reorganization of transmission bodies in plant cells infected with camv , that this reorganization depends on viral protein p2 , and that the " mixed networks " mediate viral transmission are original and significant contributions and highly appropriate for elife .
however , elife is a broad audience journal and it is critical that the manuscript is written in a manner that will be accessible to its readership .
accordingly : 1 .
the manuscript should be re - written to provide background information and to improve the writing .
special attention should be given to the introduction and results section ' tb transformation enables efficient transmission ' .
consider obtaining detailed feedback from a colleague who is not in the plant virus field .
2. the confocal work should include line scans to show the position of tubulin and em images are needed for tubulin minus and plus transmission bodies .
3. label the figures in a manner that is more intuitive with each micrograph separately labeled and provide clear explanations for some of the figures .
specifically , the graphs in figure 3b need to be explained , figures 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5k need improved labeling , and figure 6c was difficult to interpret .
4. figure 1 should be expanded to provide an overall model for the paper with a timeline of key events .
consider moving it to the end .
5. we would ask you to re - phrase the title and abstract of your study .
in our view , this is mandatory as it indicates that viruses indeed make use of the host machinery for vector - mediated transmission .
while this hypothesis seems plausible , it was not investigated in your study to an extent that would justify this rather strong statement .
10.7554 / elife.00183.058 author response 1 .
the manuscript should be re - written to provide background information and to improve the writing .
special attention should be given to the introduction and results section ' tb transformation enables efficient transmission ' .
consider obtaining detailed feedback from a colleague who is not in the plant virus field .
we took great care to present our results in a way appropriate for a broad audience .
many parts of the manuscript were rewritten ( especially the introduction , the results section , and the figure legends ) .
the text was edited for language and readability by a native english - speaking biologist not from the plant virus field .
we hope that the text is now easier to understand .
2. the confocal work should include line scans to show the position of tubulin and em images are needed for tubulin minus and plus transmission bodies .
line scans were added to figure 2a - c and the new figures 5a,b and 6a - c. this was a cool idea because the profiles show clearly the differential distribution of p2 within a tb ( tb cortex with strong p2 label and center region with weaker p2 label and the opposite for the a - tubulin label ) .
the text was adapted accordingly .
3. label the figures in a manner that is more intuitive with each micrograph separately labeled and provide clear explanations for some of the figures .
specifically , the graphs in figure 3b need to be explained , figures 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5k need improved labeling , and figure 6c was difficult to interpret .
the original 6 figures were split up into 11 newly designed figures .
we took care to improve the labeling : where possible , each panel has now its proper character label .
4. figure 1 should be expanded to provide an overall model for the paper with a timeline of key events .
consider moving it to the end .
to leave some " suspense " we explain the biological model in figure 1 as before , and present the different steps of tb activation in the new figure 11 that summarizes the results .
5. we would ask you to re - phrase the title and abstract of your study .
in our view , this is mandatory as it indicates that viruses indeed make use of the host machinery for vector - mediated transmission .
while this hypothesis seems plausible , it was not investigated in your study to an extent that would justify this rather strong statement .
to take account of your remarks on the title , we changed it to " looking outside : a virus responds instantly to the presence of the vector on the host and forms transmission morphs " .
we believe that this title better reflects our work and is less speculative .
if you have any suggestions for alternative titles , we will be happy to consider them .
the abstract , the digest and the impact statement were also changed to respect the fact that , although the results suggest it , we do not directly prove viral use of the host sensory system .

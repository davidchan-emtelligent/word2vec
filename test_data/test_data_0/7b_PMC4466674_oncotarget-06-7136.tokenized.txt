mtor is a central controller for cell growth / proliferation and survival .
recent studies have shown that mtor also regulates cell adhesion , yet the underlying mechanism is not known .
here we found that inhibition of mtor by rapamycin reduced the basal or type i insulin - like growth factor ( igf - 1 ) - stimulated adhesion of cancer cells .
further research revealed that both mtorc1 and mtorc2 were involved in the regulation of cell adhesion , as silencing expression of raptor or rictor inhibited cell adhesion .
also , pp242 , an mtorc1 / 2 kinase inhibitor , inhibited cell adhesion more potently than rapamycin ( mtorc1 inhibitor ). of interest , ectopic expression of constitutively active and rapamycin - resistant mutant of p70 kinase 1 ( s6k1 ) or downregulation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4e ( eif4e ) - binding protein 1 ( 4e - bp1 ) conferred resistance to rapamycin inhibition of cell adhesion , whereas expression of constitutively hypophosphorylated 4e - bp1 ( 4ebp1 - 5a ) or downregulation of s6k1 suppressed cell adhesion .
in contrast , neither genetic manipulation of akt activity nor pharmacological inhibition of akt affected cell adhesion .
the results suggest that both mtorc1 and mtorc2 are involved in the regulation of cell adhesion ; and mtorc1 regulates cell adhesion through s6k1 and 4e - bp1 pathways , but mtorc2 regulates cell adhesion via akt - independent mechanism .
rapamycin mtor cell adhesion akt 4e - bp1 introduction cancer metastasis is recognized as the primary cause of death in most cancer patients .
the metastatic process consists of a series of sequential and interrelated steps , including cancer cell detachment from the primary tumor , invasion of the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) , intravasation of the vascular or lymph vessels , extravasation from the vessels of delivery , attachment to and proliferation within specific distant organs in the body [ 1 , 2 ] .
inhibition of any of these steps may impair cancer metastasis formation .
as attachment is a critical step during this process , intervening cancer cell adhesion should be an effective strategy to prevent cancer metastasis .
the serine / threonine ( ser / thr ) kinase mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) lies downstream of type i insulin - like growth factor ( igf - 1 ) receptor and phosphatidylinositol 3 ' - kinase ( pi3k ) , and is a central controller of cell growth / proliferation and survival [ 3 , 4 ] .
in mammalian cells , mtor functions at least as two complexes ( mtorc1 and mtorc2 ) [ 3 , 4 ] .
mtorc1 is composed of mtor , mlst8 ( also termed g - protein beta - subunit - like protein , gbetal , a yeast homolog of lst8 ) , raptor ( regulatory - associated protein of mtor ) , and pras40 ( proline - rich akt substrate 40 kda ) , and is rapamycin - sensitive [ 5 - 10 ] .
mtorc2 consists of mtor , mlst8 , msin1 ( mammalian stress - activated protein kinase - interacting protein 1 ) , rictor ( rapamycin insensitive companion of mtor ) , and protor ( protein observed with rictor ) , and is rapamycin - insensitive , although long - term rapamycin treatment can inhibit mtorc2 in some cell types [ 5 , 11 - 18 ] .
both mtorc1 and mtorc2 can be inhibited by atp - competitive mtor kinase inhibitors such as azd8055 and pp242 [ 4 ] .
in addition to their different sensitivity to rapamycin , mtorc1 and mtorc2 are activated by different stimuli and have distinct substrate specificity and functions .
mtorc1 responds to growth factors , amino acids , energy and oxidative stress , but mtorc2 appears to be mediated only by growth factors [ 3 , 4 , 19 ] .
mtorc1 phosphorylates p70 s6 kinase 1 ( s6k1 ) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4e ( eif4e ) binding protein 1 ( 4e - bp1 ) , and controls protein and lipid synthesis , cell growth , proliferation , survival and motility [ 3 - 10 , 20 ] .
mtorc2 regulates phosphorylation or activity of akt , glucocorticoid - inducible kinase 1 ( sgk1 ) , pkcalpha , focal adhesion proteins and small gtpases , and controls cell survival and actin cytoskeleton [ 11 - 18 , 21 - 25 ] .
both mtorc1 and mtorc2 interact with a negative regulator deptor [ 26 ] .
s6k1 is defined to be primarily responsible for translation of mrna species containing 5 ' terminal oligopyrimidine ( top ) tracts [ 27 , 28 ] .
however , further studies have demonstrated that s6k1 turns on and off the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 ( eif3 ) translation initiation complex in a growth factor - and rapamycin - sensitive manner [ 29 ] .
activated s6k1 phosphorylates its translational targets , including the 40s ribosomal protein s6 and eif4b , promoting translation initiation [ 29 ] .
4e - bp1 primarily functions as a suppressor of eif4e [ 30 ] .
hypophosphorylated 4e - bp1 tightly binds to the cap - binding protein eif4e and represses cap - dependent mrna translation by blocking the interaction of eif4e with the eif4g protein and formation of the eif4f initiation complex [ 30 , 31 ] .
the phosphorylation of 4e - bp1 at multiple site ( thr37 , thr46 , ser65 , thr70 , ser83 and ser112 ) releases eif4e to restore cap - dependent translation [ 30 ] .
both s6k1 and 4e - bp1 / eif4e pathways contribute to translation [ 29 - 31 ] .
while extensive data have highlighted the importance of mtor in cell growth , proliferation and survival , research of mtor in cell adhesion is still in its infancy .
studies have shown that rapamycin inhibits the basal and epidermal growth factor ( egf ) stimulated cell adhesion in colon cancer cells ( hct116 ) [ 32 ] .
rad001 , a rapamycin analog ( rapalog ) , inhibits collagen or laminin - induced cell adhesion in renal carcinoma cells ( a498 , caki - 1 and ktc - 26 ) as well [ 33 ] .
here we show that rapamycin inhibits the basal and igf - 1 stimulated adhesion of tumor cells derived from human rhabdomyosarcoma ( rh30 ) , ewing sarcoma ( rh1 ) , colon carcinoma ( ht29 ) and cervical adenocarcinoma ( hela ) .
collectively , these findings suggest that mtor plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion ; and mtor inhibitors may have a potential not only for treatment of cancer , but also for prevention of cancer metastasis .
since the molecular mechanism by which mtor regulates cell adhesion has not been elucidated , this study was designed to address this question .
here , for the first time , we show that both mtorc1 and mtorc2 are essential for cell adhesion .
interestingly , mtorc1 regulates cell adhesion through s6k1 and 4e - bp1 pathways , but mtorc2 regulates cell adhesion via akt - independent mechanism .
results rapamycin inhibited the basal or igf - 1 - stimulated cell adhesion as mtor lies downstream of igf - 1 receptor , we focused on assessing the role of mtor in igf - 1 - mediated cell adhesion .
for this , human rhabdomyosarcoma ( rh30 ) and ewing sarcoma ( rh1 ) cells were primarily chosen as models , because these cells , under autocrine conditions , are able to produce large quantity of igf - ii , which has approximately equal affinity to igf - 1 receptor as igf - 1 [ 34 - 36 ] .
consistent with the finding in colon cancer cells ( hct116 ) [ 32 ] , treatment with rapamycin ( 100 ng / ml ) for 2 h inhibited the basal or igf - 1 - stimulated adhesion of rh1 and rh30 cells ( figure 1a ) .
similar results were observed in ht29 and hela cells ( figure 1a ) .
the results support the notion that mtor regulates cell adhesion .
figure 1 rapamycin inhibits the basal or igf - 1 - stimulated cell adhesion rh30 , rh1 , ht29 and hela cells were treated with or without rapamycin ( rapa , 100 ng / ml ) in the presence or absence of igf - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) for 1.5 h following pre - incubation with rapamycin for 2 h , respectively .
( a ) adherent cells were determined using cn iv - , fibronectin - or laminin - coated cell adhesion assay , and ( b ) cell viability was evaluated by mts assay , as described in materials and methods .
results are means +/ - se ( n = 4 - 12 ) .
* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , difference versus control group .
## p < 0.01 , difference versus igf - 1 group .
to exclude the possibility that rapamycin inhibits cell adhesion by reducing cell viability , we also examined the effect of rapamycin on cell viability using mts assay .
as shown in figure 1b , treatment with rapamycin ( 100 ng / ml ) for 4 h did not significantly influence cell viability in all cell lines tested ( rh1 , rh30 , ht29 and hela ) .
the results indicate that rapamycin inhibits cell adhesion , which is not through reducing cell viability .
this is consistent with our previous finding that exposure to rapamycin ( 100 ng / ml ) for ~ 24 h did not obviously affect cell viability in rh30 and hela cells [ 20 ] .
mtor kinase activity is essential for cell adhesion recently we have found that rapamycin inhibited cell motility in an mtor kinase activity - dependent manner [ 20 , 24 , 25 ] .
cell adhesion is a key step of cell migration [ 37 ] .
therefore , we reasoned that rapamycin inhibits cell adhesion by inhibiting the kinase activity of mtor as well .
however , it has been described that mtor regulates cell differentiation in an mtor kinase activity - independent manner [ 38 ] .
to determine whether mtor regulates cell adhesion requiring its kinase activity , rh30 cells were infected with recombinant adenoviral vectors encoding gfp ( control ) , flag - tagged rapamycin - resistant but kinase active mtor ( s2035t ; mtor - t ) or kinase - dead mtor - t ( s2035t / d2357e ; mtor - te ) , serum - starved , and treated with or without rapamycin ( rapa , 100 ng / ml ) for 2 h , followed by stimulation with or without igf - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) for 1 h. as expected , expression of mtor - t , but not mtor - te or gfp , prevented rapamycin inhibition of phosphorylation of 4e - bp1 in rh30 cells , one of the best - characterized downstream effector molecules of mtor ( figure 2a ) .
the data revealed that mtor - t functioned as a rapamycin - resistant mutant , and mtor - te as a kinase - dead mutant in rh30 cells , as seen in c2c12 cells [ 38 ]. of interest , ectopic expression of mtor - t strongly increased cell adhesion and conferred high resistance to rapamycin , whereas expression of a kinase - dead mtor mutant ( mtor - te ) remained sensitive to rapamycin ( figure 2b ) , indicating that rapamycin inhibits cell adhesion in an mtor kinase activity - dependent manner .
figure 2 mtor kinase activity is essential for cell adhesion serum - starved rh30 and / or hela cells , infected with ad - mtor - t , ad - mtor - te , or ad - gfp ( for control ) , or with lentiviral shrnas to mtor or gfp , were treated with or without rapamycin ( rapa , 100 ng / ml ) for 2 h , followed by stimulation with or without igf - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) for 1 h .
( a and c ) total cell lysates were subjected to western blotting using indicated antibodies .
the blots were probed for beta - tubulin as a loading control .
similar results were observed in at least three independent experiments .
( b and d ) adherent cells were determined using cn iv - coated cell adhesion assay .
( a ) western blot analysis showed stable expression of flag - tagged mutants of mtor in rh30 cells infected with ad - mtor - t and ad - mtor - te , but not in the control cells infected with ad - gfp .
expression of mtor - t , but not mtor - te or gfp , prevented rapamycin inhibition of the basal or igf - 1 - stimulated phosphorylation of 4e - bp1 ( thr70 ) in rh30 cells .
( b ) ectopic expression of mtor - t strongly increased cell adhesion and conferred high resistance to rapamycin , whereas expression of mtor - te remained sensitive to rapamycin .
( c ) lentiviral shrna to mtor , but not gfp , downregulated mtor in rh30 cells .
( d ) downregulation of mtor inhibited the basal and igf - 1 - stimulated adhesion in rh30 and hela cells .
results are means +/ - se ( n = 12 ) .
* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , difference versus control group .
## p < 0.01 , difference versus igf - 1 group .
$$ p < 0.01 , ad - mtor - t group versus ad - gfp group , or mtor shrna group versus gfp shrna group .
to further corroborate the importance of mtor kinase activity in cell adhesion , mtor expression was silenced using rna interference ( rnai ) in rh30 and hela cells .
as shown in figure 2c , lentiviral shrna to mtor , but not gfp , downregulated mtor by approximately 90 % in rh30 cells , as detected by western blotting .
similar results were seen in hela cells ( data not shown ) .
importantly , downregulation of mtor significantly decreased cell adhesion in rh30 and hela cells ( figure 2d ) .
taken together , our findings strongly suggest that mtor kinase activity is essential for cell adhesion .
disruption of mtorc1 or mtorc2 suppresses cell adhesion two mtor complexes ( mtorc1 and mtorc2 ) have been identified , but only mtorc1 is sensitive to short rapamycin exposure [ 3 , 4 ] .
in the present study , we have found that treatment with rapamycin for 2 h inhibits cell adhesion ( figure 1 ) .
therefore , we hypothesized that mtorc1 is critical for cell adhesion .
to this end , rnai was utilized to downregulate raptor , an essential component of mtorc1 [ 3 , 4 ] .
as shown in figure 3a , lentiviral shrna to raptor , but not gfp , downregulated raptor protein expression by ~ 90 % in rh30 cells .
consistent with the previous findings [ 20 ] , downregulation of raptor inhibited the basal and igf - 1 - stimulated mtor - mediated phosphorylation of s6k1 and 4e - bp1 ( figure 3a ) .
furthermore , downregulation of raptor significantly reduced cell adhesion in rh30 and hela cells ( figure 3b ) .
the data indicate that the integrity of mtorc1 is crucial in the regulation of cell adhesion .
figure 3 disruption of mtorc1 or mtorc2 suppresses cell adhesion serum - starved rh30 and / or hela cells , infected with lentiviral shrnas to raptor , rictor , or gfp ( for control ) , were treated with or without rapamycin ( rapa , 100 ng / ml ) for 2 h , followed by stimulation with or without igf - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) for 1 h .
( a and c ) total cell lysates were subjected to western blotting using indicated antibodies .
the blots were probed for beta - tubulin as a loading control .
similar results were observed in at least three independent experiments .
( b and d ) adherent cells were determined using cn iv - coated cell adhesion assay .
( a ) lentiviral shrna to raptor , but not gfp , downregulated raptor and prevented the basal and igf - 1 - stimulated phosphorylation of s6k1 and 4e - bp1 .
( b ) downregulation of raptor inhibited the basal and igf - 1 - stimulated cell adhesion in rh30 and hela cells .
( c ) lentiviral shrna to rictor , but not gfp , downregulated rictor and inhibited phosphorylation of akt ( ser473 ) in rh30 cells .
( d ) downregulation of rictor inhibited the basal and igf - 1 - stimulated cell adhesion in rh30 and hela cells .
results are means +/ - se ( n = 12 ) .
** p < 0.01 , difference versus control group .
## p < 0.01 , difference versus igf - 1 group .
$$ p < 0.01 , raptor shrna group or rictor shrna group versus gfp shrna group .
next , we also tested whether mtorc2 plays a role in the regulation of cell adhesion .
rictor and msin1 are two essential components of mtorc2 , and they interact with and stabilize each other [ 3 , 4 ] .
as expected , rapamycin activated phosphorylation of akt ( s473 ) in rh30 cells , but downregulation of rictor by ~ 90 % using lentiviral shrna to rictor obviously inhibited the basal and igf - 1 - stimulated phosphorylation of akt ( s473 ) ( figure 3c ) , a substrate of mtorc2 [ 22 ] .
interestingly , downregulation of rictor also suppressed cell adhesion in rh30 and hela cells ( figure 3d ) .
the findings suggest that both mtorc1 and mtorc2 control cell adhesion .
since rictor also has mtorc2 - independent functions related to regulation of cytoskeleton and cell migration [ 39 - 42 ] , to confirm the role of mtorc2 in the regulation of cell adhesion , pp242 , an mtor kinase inhibitor that blocks both mtorc1 and mtorc2 , was used .
as predicted , pp242 inhibited both mtorc1 - mediated phosphorylation of s6k1 and mtorc2 - mediated phosphorylation of akt in rh30 and ht29 cells ( figure 4a ) .
interestingly , pp242 ( inhibition of mtorc1 / 2 ) suppressed the basal or igf - 1 - stimulated cell adhesion of rh30 and ht29 cells more potently than rapamycin ( inhibition of mtorc1 ) ( figure 4b ) .
collectively , the above results demonstrate that both mtorc1 and mtorc2 are involved in the regulation of cell adhesion .
figure 4 inhibition of mtorc1 / 2 by pp242 potently suppresses the basal or igf - 1 - stimulated cell adhesion serum - starved rh30 and ht29 cells were treated with or without pp242 ( 1 mum ) or rapamycin ( rapa , 100 ng / ml ) for 2 h , followed by stimulation with or without igf - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) for 1 h .
( a ) total cell lysates were subjected to western blotting using indicated antibodies , showing that pp242 potently inhibited the basal or igf - 1 - stimulated phosphorylation of akt ( ser473 ) and s6k1 ( thr389 ) in rh30 and ht29 cells .
the blots were probed for beta - tubulin as a loading control .
similar results were observed in at least three independent experiments .
( b ) cell adhesion was determined using cn iv - coated cell adhesion assay , showing that inhibition of mtorc1 / 2 by pp242 dramatically suppressed the basal and igf - 1 - stimulated adhesion in rh30 and ht29 cells , and the inhibitory effect of pp242 was more potent that of rapa .
results are means +/ - se ( n = 6 ) .
** p < 0.01 , difference versus control group ; ## p < 0.01 , difference versus igf - 1 group ; ++ p < 0.01 , pp242 group or pp242 + igf - 1 group versus rapa group or rapa + igf - 1 group .
s6k1 pathway is essential for mtor - mediated cell adhesion to understand how mtorc1 mediates cell adhesion , next , we investigated the effect of s6k1 , one of the best - characterized downstream effector molecules of mtorc1 , on cell adhesion [ 3 , 4 ] .
to this end , rh30 cells were firstly infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing ha - tagged wild - type ( wt ) s6k1 ( ad - s6k1 - wt ) , constitutively active and rapamycin - resistant s6k1 mutant of s6k1 ( ad - s6k1 - ca ) and control virus encoding gfp alone .
as shown in figure 5a , high levels of recombinant s6k1 - wt or s6k1 - ca in the cells infected with ad - s6k1 - wt or ad - s6k1 - ca , but not in the cells infected with ad - gfp , were seen as determined by western blotting. of note , cells expressing s6k1 - wt or s6k1 - ca , but not gfp , had a robust phosphorylation of s6 ribosomal protein ( p - s6 ) , a substrate of s6k1 .
addition of igf - 1 failed to further enhance the phosphorylation of s6 .
possibly , the constitutively active s6k1 saturated the phosphorylation of s6 , or alternatively , the constitutively active s6k1 blocked the action of igf - 1 through the s6k - irs feedback loop [ 3 ] .
nevertheless , cells expressing s6k1 - ca , but not s6k1 - wt or gfp , were resistant to rapamycin inhibition of phosphorylation of s6 .
similarly , cells expressing s6k1 - ca , but not s6k1 - wt or gfp , were resistant to rapamycin inhibition of the basal and igf - 1 - stimulated cell adhesion ( figure 5b ) , suggesting that mtor positively regulates cell adhesion , at least , requiring a certain level of s6k1 activity .
figure 5 mtorc1 - mediated s6k1 pathway is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion serum - starved rh30 cells , infected with ad - s6k1 - wt , ad - s6k1 - ca , or ad - gfp ( for control ) , were treated with or without rapamycin ( rapa , 100 ng / ml ) for 2 h , followed by stimulation with igf - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) for 1 h .
( a and c ) total cell lysates were subjected to western blotting using indicated antibodies .
the blots were probed for beta - tubulin as a loading control .
similar results were observed in at least three independent experiments .
( b and d ) adherent cells were determined using cn iv - coated cell adhesion assay .
( a ) and ( b ) rh30 cells expressing s6k1 - ca , but not s6k1 - wt or gfp , were resistant to rapamycin inhibition of phosphorylation of s6 , as well as basal and igf - 1 - stimulated cell adhesion .
( c ) lentiviral shrna to s6k1 , but not gfp , downregulated s6k1 in rh30 cells .
( d ) downregulation of s6k1 significantly inhibited the basal and igf - 1 - stimulated cell adhesion in rh30 cells .
results are means +/ - se ( n = 12 ) .
** p < 0.01 , difference versus control group ; ## p < 0.01 , difference versus igf - 1 group ; $$ p < 0.01 , ad - s6k1 - wt or ad - s6k1 - ca group versus ad - gfp group , or s6k1 shrna group versus gfp shrna group .
in addition , we also investigated whether expression of constitutively active s6k1 is able to attenuate the inhibitory effect of pp242 on cell adhesion .
as predicted , treatment with rapamycin ( 100 ng / ml ) for 2 h only inhibited mtorc1 in the control cells infected with ad - gfp , whereas treatment with pp242 ( 1 mum ) for 2 h inhibited both mtorc1 and mtorc2 very potently , since both mtorc1 - mediated p - s6k1 ( thr389 ) and mtorc2 - mediated p - akt ( ser473 ) were almost completely blocked in the control cells infected with ad - gfp ( figure s1a ) .
in consistence with the findings in figure 5a and 5b , expression of constitutively active and rapamycin - resistant s6k1 ( s6k1 - ca ) , but not gfp ( control ) , conferred resistance to rapamycin inhibition of p - s6 and cell adhesion ( figure s1a and s1b ). of interest , expression of s6k1 - ca also rendered resistance to pp242 inhibition of p - s6 and cell adhesion , although the resistance to pp242 was weaker than that to rapamycin ( figure s1 ) .
the results further support that s6k1 plays a critical role in mtor - mediated cell adhesion .
to substantiate the role of s6k1 in cell adhesion , lentiviral shrna to s6k1 was used to silence expression of s6k1 in rh30 cells .
as demonstrated in figure 5c , infection of rh30 cells with lentiviral shrna to s6k1 for 5 days downregulated expression of cellular s6k1 protein by ~ 80 % compared to control cells ( infected with lentiviral shrna to gfp ) .
in line with this , silencing s6k1 expression resulted in reduction of s6k1 kinase activity , as detected by western blotting with antibodies to phospho - s6k1 ( t389 ) and phospho - s6 ribosomal protein ( s235 / 236 ) , respectively ( figure 5c ) .
consequently , the adhesion of rh30 cells treated with s6k1 shrna was significantly inhibited ( figure 5d ) .
the results further indicate that s6k1 pathway is essential for mtor - mediated cell adhesion .
4e - bp1 / eif4e pathway is necessary for mtor - mediated cell adhesion 4e - bp1 / eif4e is another best - known downstream signaling pathway of mtorc1 [ 3 , 4 ] .
next , we further evaluated the role of 4e - bp1 / eif4e pathway in the regulation of cell adhesion .
as shown in figure 6a , infection of rh30 cells with lentiviral shrna to 4e - bp1 resulted in a significant downregulation of 4e - bp1 protein expression compared to control cells infected with lentiviral shrna to gfp , as detected by western blotting with antibodies to 4e - bp1 .
consequently , the adhesion of 4e - bp1 - downregulaed rh30 cells was significantly elevated ( figure 6b ) , suggesting that mtor regulates cell adhesion also at least in part by 4e - bp1 / eif4e pathway .
figure 6 mtorc1 - mediated 4e - bp1 pathway is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion serum starved rh30 cells , infected with lentiviral shrnas to 4e - bp1 or gfp ( for control ) , or with ad - 4ebp1 - 5a and ad - gfp , were treated with or without rapamycin ( rapa , 100 ng / ml ) for 2 h , followed by stimulation with or without igf - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) for 1 h .
( a and c ) total cell lysates were subjected to western blotting using indicated antibodies .
the blots were probed for beta - tubulin as a loading control .
similar results were observed in at least three independent experiments .
( b and d ) adherent cells were determined using cn iv - coated cell adhesion assay .
( a ) lentiviral shrna to 4e - bp1 , but not gfp , resulted in a significant downregulation of 4e - bp1 in rh30 cells .
( b ) downregulation of 4e - bp1 significantly elevated the basal and igf - 1 - stimulated cell adhesion in rh30 cells .
( c ) exposure to rapamycin due to ha - tagged 4e - bp1 in ad - 4ebp1 - 5a - infected cells failed to change the mobility of 4e - bp1 - 5a ( upper panel ) .
however , using 7 - methyl gtp - sepharose pull - down assay , very striking amount of recombinant 4ebp1 - 5a was observed to bind to eif4e , even in the absence of rapamycin ( bottom panel ) .
( d ) expression of 4ebp1 - 5a inhibited the basal and igf - 1 - stimulated cell adhesion in rh30 cells .
results are means +/ - se ( n = 12 ) .
** p < 0.01 , difference versus control group ; ## p < 0.01 , difference versus igf - 1 group ; $$ p < 0.01 , gfp shrna group versus 4e - bp1 shrna group , or ad - 4ebp1 - 5a group versus ad - gfp group .
to further confirm the functional significance of 4e - bp1 / eif4e pathway in the mtorc1 - mediated cell adhesion , next , we employed recombinant adenovirus encoding ha - tagged 4e - bp1 mutants where thr36 , thr45 , ser64 , thr69 and ser82 are replaced by ala residues ( designated 4ebp1 - 5a ) mimicking hypophosphorylated residues , thus tightly binding to and sequester eif4e in cells [ 31 ] .
as shown in figure 6c , ha - tagged 4e - bp1 and higher levels of 4e - bp1 were detected in ad - 4ebp1 - 5a - infected cells .
exposure to rapamycin failed to change the mobility of 4e - bp1 - 5a ( figure 6c , upper panel ) .
however , using 7 - methyl gtp - sepharose pull - down assay , very striking amount of recombinant 4ebp1 - 5a was observed to bind to eif4e , even in the absence of rapamycin ( figure 6c , bottom panel ) .
the results clearly demonstrate that ad - 4ebp1 - 5a functions as a dominant suppressor of eif4e in the cells .
interestingly , expression of 4ebp1 - 5a inhibited the basal and igf - stimulated cell adhesion ( figure 6d ) .
the finding verifies that 4e - bp1 / eif4e pathway is as critical as s6k1 pathway for mtor - mediated cell adhesion .
akt does not contribute to mtor - mediated cell adhesion we have displayed that mtorc2 controls cell adhesion ( figure 3 ) .
it has been reported that mtorc2 directly phosphorylates akt on ser473 [ 22 ] .
akt is a well characterized substrate of mtorc2 [ 3 , 4 ] .
therefore , we asked whether mtorc2 - mediated akt pathway plays an important role in the regulation of cell adhesion .
for this , akt inhibitor x , a selective akt inhibitor , was utilized .
we found that treatment with akt inhibitor x ( 10 mum ) for 2 h inhibited phospho - akt and phospho - gsk3beta in the cells , as detected by western blot analysis ( figure 7a ). of note , the adhesion of rh30 cells , treated with or without rapamycin and / or igf - 1 after pre - incubation with or without akt inhibitor x for 2 h , was not significantly affected ( figure 7b ) .
similar data were also seen in hela cells ( figure 7b ) .
the results imply that akt may not contribute to mtorc2 - mediated cell adhesion .
figure 7 pharmacological inhibition of akt or ectopic expression of constitutively active or dominant negative akt does not affect cell adhesion ( a ) serum - starved rh30 were treated with or without akt inhibitor x ( 10 mum ) for 2 h , followed by western blot analysis using indicated antibodies , showing that akt inhibitor x inhibited the phosphorylation of akt and its substrate gsk3beta in the cells .
( b ) the adhesion of rh30 and hela cells , treated with or without rapamycin and / or igf - 1 following pre - incubation with or without akt inhibitor x for 2 h , was not significantly affected .
( c and d ) serum starved rh30 and / or hela cells , infected with ad - myr - akt , ad - dn - akt , or ad - gfp ( for control ) , were treated with or without rapamycin ( rapa , 100 ng / ml ) for 2 h , followed by stimulation with or without igf - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) for 1 h .
( c ) total cell lysates were subjected to western blotting using indicated antibodies .
the blots were probed for beta - tubulin as a loading control .
similar results were observed in at least three independent experiments .
( d ) adherent cells were determined using cn iv - coated cell adhesion assay , showing that ectopic expression of myr - akt or dn - akt did not exhibit an obvious stimulatory or inhibitory effect on cell adhesion in rh30 and hela cells .
results are means +/ - se ( n = 12 ) .
* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , difference versus control group ; # p < 0.01 , ## p < 0.01 , difference versus igf - 1 group .
to corroborate the above finding , recombinant adenoviruses encoding ha - tagged constitutively active akt ( ad - myr - akt ) and dominant negative akt ( ad - dn - akt ) , respectively , were employed .
infection of rh30 cells with ad - myr - akt and ad - dn - akt , but not ad - gfp ( control virus ) , resulted in expression of high levels of ha - tagged akt mutants ( figure 7c ) .
expression of myr - akt , but not expression of dn - akt , led to robust phosphorylation of akt ( ser473 ) even without stimulation with rapamycin and / or igf - 1 ( figure 7c ) , indicating that the akt mutants were functional in the cells as expected .
surprisingly , ectopic expression of myr - akt or dn - akt did not obviously stimulate or inhibit cell adhesion in rh30 and hela cells treated with or without rapamycin and / or igf - 1 ( figure 7d ) .
the results clearly indicate that mtorc2 regulates cell adhesion independently of akt .
discussion migration of cancer cells is under intense investigation as a prerequisite for cancer metastasis , which is a primary cause of mortality in most cancer patients [ 1 , 2 , 43 - 47 ] .
as cell migration is a multistep cellular event , including cell polarization / protrusion , adhesion and de - adhesion [ 37 ] , disturbance of any of these steps may intervene cancer metastasis .
therefore , it is of great importance to find a novel therapeutic target and strategy to control cancer metastasis in individuals with cancer .
we have shown that rapamycin inhibits cell motility by suppression of mtor - mediated s6k1 and 4e - bp1 pathways [ 20 ] , and identified that rapamycin inhibition of cell motility is related to its prevention of f - actin reorganization [ 24 , 25 ] .
here , for the first time , we show that both mtorc1 and mtorc2 are essential for cell adhesion .
furthermore , mtorc1 regulates cell adhesion via s6k1 and 4e - bp1 pathways , but mtorc2 regulates cell adhesion through akt - independent mechanism .
it is well known that mtor functions as a central controller of cell growth , proliferation , differentiation and survival [ 3 , 4 ] .
increasing evidence implicates that mtor pathway also plays a crucial role in the regulation of tumor cell motility and invasion , as well as cancer metastasis [ 20 , 24 , 25 , 48 , 49 ] .
rapamycin suppresses tumor cell growth / proliferation [ 3 , 4 ] and motility [ 20 , 24 , 25 ] , and induces apoptosis of tumor cells under certain conditions [ 50 , 51 ] by inhibiting the kinase activity of mtor .
previous studies have also shown that rapamycin inhibits the basal and epidermal growth factor ( egf ) stimulated cell adhesion in colon cancer cells ( hct116 ) [ 32 ] .
rad001 , a rapalog , has also been found to inhibit collagen or laminin - induced cell adhesion in renal carcinoma cells ( a498 , caki - 1 and ktc - 26 ) [ 33 ] .
in the present study , we further observed that allosteric inhibition of mtorc1 by rapamycin suppressed igf - 1 - stimulated cell adhesion in a panel of tumor cell lines , including human rhabdomyosarcoma ( rh30 ) , ewing sarcoma ( rh1 ) , colon carcinoma ( ht29 ) , and cervical adenocarcinoma ( hela ) cells , which was not by reducing the cell viability .
in addition , inhibition of mtorc1 / 2 kinase activity by pp242 exhibited more potent inhibitory effect on cell adhesion in the tumor cells .
the findings from this group and others [ 32 , 33 ] strongly support the concept that mtor regulates cell adhesion , which is independent of cancer cell lines or stimuli .
cell adhesion is a key step during cell migration [ 37 ] .
since it has been shown that mtor regulates cell differentiation independently of mtor kinase activity [ 38 , 52 ] , although there exist disputations [ 53 , 54 ] , this prompted us to study whether rapamycin inhibits cell adhesion in an mtor kinase activity - dependent manner .
we found that expression of a rapamycin - resistant but kinase active mtor ( s2035t ; mtor - t ) , but not kinase - dead mtor - t ( s2035t / d2357e ; mtor - te ) , prevented rapamycin from inhibiting igf - 1 - stimulated cell adhesion ( figure 2b ) , revealing that mtor kinase activity is essential for cell adhesion .
this is further supported by the observations that the adhesion of rh30 and hela cells treated with mtor shrna or pp242 ( an mtor kinase inhibitor ) was profoundly inhibited .
taken together , our data underscore a critical role of mtor in cell adhesion .
studies have identified two structurally and functionally distinct mtor - containing multiprotein complexes ( mtorc1 and mtorc2 ) [ 3 , 4 ] .
the functions of mtorc1 and mtorc2 are greatly affected by the complex integrity , especially their associations with raptor [ 6 , 7 ] and rictor [ 11 , 12 ] , respectively .
mtorc1 regulates phosphorylation of s6k1 and 4e - bp1 [ 6 , 7 ] , and mtorc2 phosphorylates akt at s473 [ 22 ] .
most functions of mtorc1 are sensitive to rapamycin , and mtorc1 controls translation initiation , ribosome biogenesis and other growth - related events [ 3 , 4 ] .
however , the action of rapamycin on mtorc2 - mediated akt depends on the concentration and duration of rapamycin treatment , and mtorc2 regulates polarization of actin cytoskeleton [ 11 , 12 ] .
here we found that disruption of mtorc1 or mtorc2 by silencing raptor or rictor , respectively , inhibited the basal and igf - 1 - stimulated adhesion of cancer cells .
furthermore , pp242 ( an mtorc1 / 2 kinase inhibitor ) inhibited cell adhesion more potently than rapamycin ( an mtorc1 inhibitor ) , suggesting that both mtorc1 and mtorc2 regulate cell adhesion .
s6k1 and 4e - bp1 are two best - characterized downstream targets of mtorc1 [ 3 , 4 ] .
to gain more insights into in the event that mtorc1 regulates cell adhesion , we dissected the roles of these two downstream pathways in the regulation of cell adhesion .
the levels or activities of s6k1 and 4e - bp1 were individually manipulated genetically .
cells infected with an adenoviral recombinant expressing constitutively active and rapamycin - resistant mutant of s6k1 ( ad - s6k1 - ca ) , but not with an adenovirus expressing wild - type s6k1 ( ad - s6k1 - wt ) , or a control viral vector ( ad - gfp ) , conferred to resistance to rapamycin , and cell adhesion was rescued .
consistently , igf - 1 failed to stimulate adhesion in the s6k1 - downregulated cells .
on the other hand , downregulation of 4e - bp1 by shrna greatly attenuated the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on cell adhesion .
in contrast , genetic expression of constitutively hypophophorylated 4e - bp1 ( 4e - bp1 - 5a ) potently inhibited igf - 1 - stimulated cell adhesion .
the findings highlight that both mtorc1 - mediated s6k1 and 4e - bp1 pathways are essential for cell adhesion .
a new question that arises from this work is how mtorc1 - mediated s6k1 and 4e - bp1 pathways regulate cell adhesion .
it is well known that both s6k1 and 4e - bp1 / eif4e pathways contribute to protein synthesis [ 3 , 4 ] .
cell adhesion is mediated by multiple signaling molecules , such as integrins , e - cadherin , focal adhesion kinase ( fak ) , src , integrin - linked kinase , the small gtpases ( rhoa , rac1 , cdc42 ) , protein phosphatase 2a , and erk1 / 2 [ 32 , 55 - 58 ]. whether mtorc1 - mediated s6k1 and 4e - bp1 pathways regulate cell adhesion by impacting those proteins at transcriptional , translational or post - translational level remains to be defined .
obviously , more studies are required to address the questions .
in the studies , we found that silencing rictor inhibited cell adhesion , suggesting that mtorc2 may participate in the regulation of cell adhesion .
since rictor is not only essential for mtorc2 function , but also carries mtorc2 - independent functions related to regulation of cytoskeleton and cell migration [ 39 - 42 ] , in order to verify our finding that the inhibition of cell adhesion by rictor shrna indeed represents the role of mtorc2 in the regulation of cell adhesion , we took advantage of the mtorc1 / 2 inhibitor pp242. of interest , pp242 suppressed the basal or igf - 1 - stimulated cell adhesion of rh30 and ht29 cells more potently than rapamycin ( mtorc1 inhibitor ) ( figure 4 ) .
the data support the conclusion that both mtorc1 and mtorc2 are involved in the regulation of cell adhesion .
as akt is a well characterized substrate of mtorc2 [ 26 ] , we therefore speculated that the akt pathway is involved in regulating cell adhesion .
however , to our surprise , the experiments using genetic manipulation or pharmacological inhibition of akt activity demonstrated that mtor - mediated cell adhesion was independent of akt pathway .
this is in contrast to the observation that akt activity is important for stromal cell - derived factor - 1 ( sdf - 1 ) - induced hematopoietic progenitor cell adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells [ 59 ] .
the discrepancy is likely due to the different cell lines or experimental conditions used .
noticeably , although akt positively regulates motility in many cell lines [ 60 , 61 ] , it negatively regulates sdf - 1 - mediated migration of hematopoietic progenitors [ 59 ] .
since mtorc2 not only regulates phosphorylation of akt , but also regulates phosphorylation of serum - and glucocorticoid - induced protein kinase 1 ( sgk1 ) [ 19 ] , focal adhesion proteins ( fak , paxillin , and p130cas ) [ 18 , 25 ] and protein kinase c - alpha [ 17 ] , the activities of small gtpases ( rhoa , cdc42 and rac1 ) [ 18 , 24 , 58 ] , further research is required to determine whether mtorc2 regulates cell adhesion by mediating any of these signaling molecules .
in summary , we have demonstrated that rapamycin inhibits the basal or igf - 1 - stimulated adhesion of cancer cells .
mtor kinase activity is essential for cell adhesion .
both mtorc1 and mtorc2 participate in the regulation of cell adhesion ( figure 8 ) .
however , mtorc1 regulates cell adhesion through s6k1 and 4e - bp1 pathways , but mtorc2 regulates cell adhesion by akt - independent mechanism .
further research is needed to address how mtorc2 regulates cell adhesion .

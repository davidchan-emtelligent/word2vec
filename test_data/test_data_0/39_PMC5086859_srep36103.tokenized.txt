to view a copy of this license , visit http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 / to search for a strategy to prevent kidney stone formation / recurrence , this study addressed the role of alpha - enolase on apical membrane of renal tubular cells in mediating calcium oxalate monohydrate ( com ) crystal adhesion .
its presence on apical membrane and in com crystal - bound fraction was confirmed by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining .
pretreating mdck cells with anti - alpha - enolase antibody , not isotype - controlled igg , dramatically reduced cell - crystal adhesion .
immunofluorescence staining also confirmed the direct binding of purified alpha - enolase to com crystals at { 121 } > { 100 } > { 010 } crystal faces .
coating com crystals with urinary proteins diminished the crystal binding capacity to cells and purified alpha - enolase .
moreover , alpha - enolase selectively bound to com , not other crystals .
chemico - protein interactions analysis revealed that alpha - enolase interacted directly with ca2 + and mg2 + .
incubating the cells with mg2 + prior to cell - crystal adhesion assay significantly reduced crystal binding on the cell surface , whereas preincubation with edta , a divalent cation chelator , completely abolished mg2 + effect , indicating that com and mg2 + competitively bind to alpha - enolase .
taken together , we successfully confirmed the role of alpha - enolase as a com crystal receptor to mediate com crystal adhesion at apical membrane of renal tubular cells .
it may also serve as a target for stone prevention by blocking cell - crystal adhesion and stone nidus formation .
due to the polarized characteristics of renal tubular epithelial cells , their apical membranes directly contact with tubular fluid and thus are involved with com crystal adhesion , which is one of the initial mechanisms for kidney stone formation12 .
recently , a number of potential com crystal - binding molecules and / or proteins expressed on the apical membranes of renal tubular epithelial cells have been identified234 .
after renal tubular cell injury by numerous inducers , the injured renal tubular cells showed increased expression of com crystal - binding molecules / proteins in concordance with the enhanced com crystal binding on the cell surfaces5 .
therefore , identification and characterizations of crystal - binding molecules / proteins on apical membranes of renal tubular epithelial cells may make kidney stone prevention feasible .
our previous expression proteomics study successfully identified a large number of com crystal - binding proteins isolated from apical membranes of mdck renal tubular epithelial cells4 .
among them , a glycolytic enzyme alpha - enolase was also identified by mass spectrometry in the com crystal - bound fraction .
alpha - enolase is a 47 - kda enzyme that plays multiple roles in various cellular processes , including growth control , glycolysis and hypoxic tolerance6 .
over the last few years , growing evidence has demonstrated that alpha - enolase is localized not only in cytoplasm but also on the cell surface of a variety of eukaryotic cells at which enzymatic catalytic activity remains7 .
surface alpha - enolase also has a role in plasminogen - binding activity and serves as a plasminogen receptor , which is important for the development of some cancers89 .
this protein has increased expression level in the injured and regenerating cells during wound healing process1011 .
in kidney stone disease , increasing evidence has pointed out its significance in kidney stone formation .
high oxalate and testosterone treatments , both of which are the stone aggravators , increase expression level of alpha - enolase in renal tubular cells1213 , whereas epigallocatechin gallate ( egcg ) , a stone suppressor from both in vitro and in vivo studies , decreases alpha - enolase level in renal tubular cells14 .
expression and additional data from these studies suggest that alpha - enolase may serve as a potential com crystal receptor to mediate crystal binding on the cell surface .
nevertheless , the precise role of alpha - enolase as a receptor for com crystals has not been confirmed .
this study thus aimed to validate the role of alpha - enolase as a com crystal receptor on apical membranes of renal tubular epithelial cells by using western blotting , immunofluorescence staining , laser - scanning confocal microscopy , cell - crystal adhesion assay , neutralization of surface alpha - enolase by its specific antibody , crystal - protein binding assay , crystal face - specific binding determination , chemico - protein interactions analysis , and competitive binding assay using mg2 + and divalent cation chelator .
results western blotting was performed to confirm the presence of alpha - enolase on apical membranes of mdck renal tubular epithelial cells and also in com crystal - bound fraction .
figure 1 shows that alpha - enolase was found in whole cell lysate , apical membrane and com - bound fractions .
immunofluorescence staining and laser - scanning confocal microscopy were also performed to further validate apical surface localization of alpha - enolase in polarized mdck cells .
polarized mdck cells were fixed with 3.7 % paraformaldehyde without any permeabilization step ( to just demonstrate its surface localization , not the cytoplasmic expression ) and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti - alpha - enolase antibody .
the confocal micrographs clearly illustrated apical surface localization of alpha - enolase ( fig. 2 ) .
these data strengthen the apical membrane localization of alpha - enolase in epithelial cells in addition to cytoplasm , which is its main localization .
to further validate the role of surface alpha - enolase as a com crystal receptor , its expression on cell surface was neutralized by incubating with rabbit polyclonal anti - alpha - enolase specific antibody prior to com crystal administration in cell - com crystal adhesion assay .
after 1 - h incubation with com crystals , the unbound crystals were eliminated by extensive washes with pbs and the remaining crystals were observed under a phase - contrast microscope ( fig. 3a ) and counted in at least 15 random high power fields ( hpfs ) ( fig. 3b ) .
neutralizing the surface alpha - enolase on mdck cells significantly decreased the number of adherent com crystals by approximately half of that observed in the blank control and isotype - controlled igg groups ( fig. 3b ) .
similarly , the percentage of com crystal - bound cells was also reduced by specific antibody neutralization by over a half as compared to the blank control and isotype - controlled igg ( fig. 3c ) .
we next addressed whether the binding of alpha - enolase to com crystal specific or not .
com crystals were incubated with purified protein alpha - enolase and its binding to crystal surfaces was verified by immunofluorescence staining .
the data obviously showed immunofluorescence staining of alpha - enolase ( in red ) on com crystal surfaces , whereas carbonic anhydrase ii , which was used as a negative control , showed no binding to com crystal surfaces ( fig. 4 ) .
these findings indicated that alpha - enolase specifically bound to com crystals and their interactions might be determined by particular domain on the alpha - enolase molecule that could capture ca2 + on the com crystal surfaces .
com crystals , which were generated in an inorganic solution , showed three common crystal faces , including { 100 } , { 010 } and { 121 } ( fig. 5a,c ) .
binding of purified alpha - enolase on these different crystal faces was then evaluated ( fig. 5b,d ) .
top and lateral views of immunofluorescence images showed the preferential binding of purified alpha - enolase on { 121 } as compared to { 100 } and { 010 } ( fig. 5e,f ) .
these data indicated face - specific binding feature of alpha - enolase onto com crystals .
human urine normally composes of a lot of macromolecules , particular urinary proteins , which may have affect binding between com crystals and alpha - enolase on renal tubular epithelial cells .
we thus examined the effect of urinary proteins on com crystal adhesion by coating com crystal surface with urinary proteins prior to cell - com crystal adhesion and crystal - protein binding assays .
the data showed less binding capacity of the urinary proteins - coated crystals to adhere with mdck cells as compared to the uncoated crystals ( fig. 6a,b ) .
in addition , coating the crystals with urinary proteins dramatically reduced binding of the purified alpha - enolase onto com crystal surfaces ( fig. 6c,d ) .
these data clearly demonstrated the interference of urinary macromolecules to the binding of com crystals and surface alpha - enolase on renal tubular epithelial cells .
differential crystal types may have significant effects on alpha - enolase binding .
we thus evaluated the specificity of binding of alpha - enolase on com crystal surfaces by comparing with other crystal types , including calcium oxalate dihydrate ( cod ) , brushite , hydoxyapatite ( hap ) and uric acid crystals .
immunofluorescence data showed the most potent binding of alpha - enolase on com crystals , whereas its binding to other crystal types was much weaker ( fig. 7 ) .
this data confirmed the specific binding of alpha - enolase onto com , not other crystal types .
a - enolase has three binding sites for divalent cations1516 .
it is thus possible that various cations in the urine could competitively bind to apical surface alpha - enolase and affect com crystal binding616 .
all the divalent cations commonly found in human urine via renal excretion including ca2 + , mg2 + , mn2 + , zn2 + and cu2 + 17 , all of which play important roles in various biological processes , were subjected to chemico - protein interactions analysis to predict their interactions with alpha - enolase using stitch tool version 4.0 ( http :// stitch.embl.de /) .
such interactions analysis revealed that alpha - enolase directly interacted with ca2 + , zn2 + and , with a greater extent , mg2 + , which also interacted with all other cations ( fig. 8a ). from this chemico - protein interactions network , the data suggested that mg2 + , which is a major abundant cation in the urine , is a potent alpha - enolase binder and thus could interfere with binding between alpha - enolase and com crystal .
we then examined whether blocking cation - binding sites of alpha - enolase on apical membranes of polarized renal tubular epithelial cells by mg2 + could diminish cell - com crystal adhesion or not .
moreover , we also addressed whether a divalent cation chelator could abolish or neutralize effect of mg2 + competitive binding or not .
the cells were pretreated with equal volume of mem ( blank control ) , mg2 + - free tbs ( preservative or background control ) , or 0.1 m mgcl2 in mg2 + - free tbs for 30 min prior to cell - com crystal adhesion assay .
the data showed significant reduction of the number of adherent crystals on the cells pretreated with mg2 + as compared to the blank and background controls ( fig. 8b,c ) .
moreover , the data also demonstrated that edta could completely abolish the competitive effect of mg2 + ( fig. 8b,c ) .
these data strongly suggested that divalent cation - binding sites of alpha - enolase on apical surface of renal tubular epithelial cells play a critical role in mediating com crystal adhesion .
discussion adhesion of com crystals onto apical surface of renal tubular epithelial cells has been thought to be an early phase of stone nidus and kidney stone formation181920 .
our previous expression proteomics study identified alpha - enolase as a com crystal - binding protein on apical membranes of renal tubular epithelial cells by quadrupole time - of - flight ( q - tof ) tandem mass spectrometry ( ms / ms ) 4 .
additional supportive evidence has demonstrated that expression level of alpha - enolase was increased and decreased after renal tubular cells were treated with stone aggravators1213 and inhibitor14 , respectively .
however , its precise role as the potential com crystal receptor remained unclear .
the present study thus aimed to validate the role of alpha - enolase as the com crystal receptor on apical surface of renal tubular epithelial cells .
enolase ( ec 4.2.1.11 ) , also known as phosphopyruvate dehydratase , is a multifunctional metalloenzyme that catalyzes interconversion of 2 - phospho - d - glycerate ( pga ) and phosphoenolpyruvate ( pep ) in the glycolytic pathway6 .
this catalytic reaction requires divalent cation , particular magnesium ( mg2 +) , for function1516 .
in mammals , there are three enolase isoenzymes , including alpha , beta and gamma , each of which is a homodimeric protein21 .
alpha - enolase is generally found in a variety of tissues , including the kidney22 .
in renal tubules , alpha - enolase is expressed in almost all segments of the nephron , especially distal tubule and collecting duct21 , which are the main tubular segments for com stone nidus formation23 .
our data demonstrating the apical membrane localization of alpha - enolase on mdck renal tubular epithelial cells ( figs 1 and 2 ) were in concordance with findings of bonilha et al.24 who used a proteomic approach to characterize proteome of the isolated retinal pigment epithelium microvilli from polarized retinal epithelial cells and found that alpha - enolase was one of the microvillar proteins .
recently , alpha - enolase has been reported with a novel function as a potential plasminogen receptor to bind with plasminogen and activate plasminogen to produce plasmin and induce fibrinolysis7825 .
in addition , surface alpha - enolase has been implicated in tissue invasion and metastasis of various cancer cells , including cervical , colon , adenocarcinoma , and breast cancers as a result of plasminogen activation2627 .
moreover , our previous study has also demonstrated that alpha - enolase is involved in plasminogen activation leading to com crystal invasion into renal interstitium28 .
the findings from our present study demonstrating that alpha - enolase served as a com crystal receptor to mediate cell - crystal adhesion strengthened its significant roles in kidney stone disease pathogenesis .
approximately 2.5 % of total dry weight of kidney stone composes of organic matrices , of which > 50 % are enriched with urinary proteins that can affect various steps of kidney stone formation293031 .
the effects of urinary proteins on binding ability of com crystals to alpha - enolase on renal tubular cells were examined ( fig. 6 ) .
our findings were consistent with those reported in previous studies , which demonstrated that macromolecules present in human urine could block the adhesion of com crystals to renal tubular cells by coating crystal surface to prevent crystal retention inside the kidney293233 .
the binding of proteins to com crystals has been thought to be associated with atomic array orientation of chemical compositions on the crystal surfaces343536 .
face - specific binding analysis revealed that alpha - enolase preferentially bound to com crystal surfaces with the following order : { 121 } > { 100 } > { 010 } ( fig. 5 ) .
preferential binding of alpha - enolase to { 121 } and also { 100 } faces might be due to the high ca2 + density on these two faces of com crystals37 .
a - enolase is a symmetrical dimeric enzyme , in which each monomer has three binding sites to divalent cations1516 .
interestingly , previous studies have suggested that the presence of mg2 + could affect the adhesion forces between com crystals and renal tubular epithelial cells3839404142 .
moreover , the increase of urinary mg2 + excretion could inhibit kidney stone formation by preventing crystallization of ca2 + and oxalate ( c2o42 - ) ions in the urine3839404142 and by inhibiting adhesion of com crystals to renal tubular epithelial cells3943 .
in this study , we thus used a high ( supraphysiologic ) concentration of mg2 + ( at 0.1 m ) to neutralize the divalent cation - binding sites of surface alpha - enolase to decrease ca2 + affinity prior to performing cell - com crystal adhesion assay .
the data showed that the number of the crystals adhered onto the cell surface was significantly reduced by mg2 + , whereas preincubation with edta , a divalent cation chelator , completely abolished mg2 + effect ( fig. 8 ) , indicating that com and mg2 + competitively bind to alpha - enolase via divalent cation - binding domain .
this information implicates that manipulation of urinary compositions and / or intratubular microenvironment ( i.e. by mg2 + supplement / treatment ) may be one of the strategies to prevent kidney stone formation or its recurrence .
indeed , edta treatment following mg2 + preincubation caused a slightly increase in number of com crystals bound on the cell surface ( fig. 8c ) .
this was not unexpected because edta could chelate not only exogenous mg2 + that was added during preincubation but also existing mg2 + and other divalent cations , which are normally bound onto the apical surface molecules / proteins , including alpha - enolase .
this finding was consistent with previous studies reporting the usage of edta to remove divalent cations from cell membranes4445 .
thus , the free divalent cation - binding sites on alpha - enolase molecule were increased and more available to bind with com crystals .
in summary , our present study investigated functional role of alpha - enolase on apical membranes of renal tubular epithelial cells in association with kidney stone pathogenesis by using western blotting , immunofluorescence staining , laser - scanning confocal microscopy , cell - crystal adhesion assay , neutralization of surface alpha - enolase by its specific antibody , crystal - protein binding assay , crystal face - specific binding determination , chemico - protein interactions analysis , and competitive binding assay using mg2 + and divalent cation chelator .
all these investigations successfully confirmed the role of alpha - enolase as a com crystal receptor to mediate com crystal adhesion at apical membranes of renal tubular epithelial cells .
it may also serve as a target for future stone prevention by blocking com crystal - cell binding and stone nidus formation .

crystal - protein binding assay followed by immunofluorescence staining to further confirm that com crystal - binding ability of alpha - enolase is specific , we directly incubated purified alpha - enolase with com crystals and detected the presence of alpha - enolase on the com crystal surface using immunofluorescence staining .
briefly , 5 mug purified alpha - enolase ( sino biological inc. ; beijing , china ) was resuspended in 1 ml of protein - free artificial urine ( as detailed above ) .
com crystals ( 5 mg ) were added into the protein suspension and then incubated on the orbital rotator at 4 degreesc overnight .

an equal amount of purified carbonic anhydrase ii ( sigma - aldrich ; singapore ) served as a negative control in parallel experiments using of rabbit polyclonal anti - carbonic anhydrase ii ( chemicon international ; hampshire , uk ) and chicken anti - rabbit igg conjugated with alexa 555 ( invitrogen - molecular probes ) as primary and secondary antibodies , respectively .
imagej software ( http :// imagej.nih.gov / ij /) was used to quantify the fluorescence intensity of alpha - enolase on individual faces ({ 100 } , { 010 } and { 121 }) of com crystals from at least 100 individual crystals .
to compare the binding ability of alpha - enolase on five different crystal types , including com , cod , brushite , hap and uric acid crystals , the experiments were done using exactly the same protocol as of com crystals ( as described in details above ) using equal amount of crystals ( 5 mg / ml artificial urine ) .

this tool analyzed interactions between proteins and chemicals using both experimental and mining data retrieved from various databases53 .
competitive binding assay using mg2 + the interaction between alpha - enolase and ca2 + was also validated by a competitive binding assay using mg2 + .
after 4 days of cultivation , culture medium was removed and mdck cells were rinsed twice with mg2 + - free tris - buffered saline ( tbs ) ( containing 50 mm tris - hcl and 150 mm nacl , ph 7.5 ) .
the cells were then incubated with 0.1 m mgcl2 in mg2 + - free tbs for 30 min to block the divalent cation - binding sites of alpha - enolase on the cell surface prior to cell - crystal adhesion assay .
to further evaluate the role of divalent cation - binding sites on alpha - enolase in mediating com crystal adhesion , we recovered the divalent cation - binding sites by further incubating the cells with 5 mm edta in mg2 + - free tbs for 15 min before performing cell - crystal adhesion assay .

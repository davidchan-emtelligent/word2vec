a 64 - year - old male with a history of hypertension presented with worsening diarrhea and 25 - pound weight loss over the preceding three months .
prior screening colonoscopy was unremarkable , and the patient failed conservative management .
on presentation , the patient had orthostatic hypotension associated with prerenal azotemia for which olmesartan ( 40 mg / day ) was held .
initial workup for chronic diarrhea was essentially unremarkable .
then , egd was performed with small bowel biopsy , which showed a moderate villous blunting and an intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration .
celiac disease was excluded by negative conventional serology tests and the absence of clinical response to a gluten - free diet .
in the interim , diarrhea became resolving without any other interventions , and clinical response was achieved even with gluten - containing diet .
two months later , he achieved a complete resolution of diarrhea and regained 20 - pound weight .
spruelike enteropathy is a clinical entity manifested by chronic diarrhea and intestinal villous atrophy .
spruelike enteropathy associated with olmesartan as a cause of drug - induced diarrhea is rare , and it has been reported only in a case series to date .
this case highlighted the importance for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for olmesartan as a precipitant of spruelike enteropathy .
1. introduction olmesartan is one of several angiotensin ii receptor blocking ( arb ) agents .
olmesartan has been shown to have a longer half - life and a greater effect on systolic blood pressure than other arb agents , making it widely prescribed for the management of hypertension .
diarrhea is a common adverse effect of many medications , and it is one of the common adverse effects of olmesartan .
however , in most cases the mechanisms underlying diarrhea remain unclear .
spruelike enteropathy is a clinical entity manifested by chronic diarrhea and intestinal villous atrophy .
spruelike enteropathy as a cause of drug - induced diarrhea has been recognized in posttransplant patients while taking immunosuppressive medications [ 1 - 3 ] .
subsequently , a case series of spruelike enteropathy associated with olmesartan in transplant - naive patients has recently been reported from a tertiary referral center [ 4 ] , but no similar reports have been reported to date .
2. case presentation a 64 - year - old male with a past medical history of hypertension presented with worsening diarrhea and 25 - pound weight loss over the preceding three months .
he reported 5 - 10 daily episodes of watery , nonbloody diarrhea associated with abdominal bloating .
the patient failed conservative management including an opioid - receptor agonist and gluten - free diet as well as a trial of oral antibiotic for possible small bowel bacterial overgrowth .
he denied any other symptoms suggestive of local or systemic infections , recent travels or sick contacts , prior exposure to health care environments , or changes in his diet habit or medications within the last few years .
prior screening colonoscopy was unremarkable .
on presentation , the patient had orthostatic hypotension for which olmesartan ( 40 mg / day ) was held .
physical examination was unremarkable except for the finding of moderate dehydration .
laboratory data were pertinent for k 3.3 mmol / l , hco3 19 mmol / l , bun 44 mg / dl , and cr 3.1 mg / dl ( all the variables were previously documented as normal ) .
steatorrhea was documented by quantitative measurement of stool fat with microscopic examination revealing > 100 stained fat droplets per high power field .
other initial workup including serum thyroid stimulating hormone , stool cultures , stool clostridium difficile toxin assay , stool ova and parasites , stool osmolality , and stool electrolytes was unrevealing .
after recovery from acute prerenal azotemia , a ct scan of abdomen and pelvis was performed , and it was negative for pancreatic abnormality or other suspicious lesions for malignancy .
serum levels of gastrin , vasoactive intestinal poplpeptide , chromogranin a , and urine 5 - hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( hiaa ) level came back to normal limits .
a colonoscopy with random colonic biopsies revealed no evidence of microscopic colitis or inflammatory bowel disease .
then , egd was performed with small bowel biopsy , which showed moderate villous blunting and intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration without subepithelial collagen depositions ( figure 1 ) .
however , both iga tissue transglutaminase ( ttg ) antibody and iga tissue endomysial antibody were negative .
hla - dq2 and dq8 were not present .
celiac disease was excluded by negative conventional serology tests and the absence of clinical response to a gluten - free diet .
in the interim , the frequency and amount of stool became decreasing , and the patient gradually became tolerating oral intake .
no medication was needed to control diarrhea after clinical response was achieved even with gluten - containing diet .
he was discharged to home with suspension of olmesartan .
at a two - week followup , he reported 1 - 2 formed stools a day without abdominal symptoms .
two months later , he achieved complete resolution of diarrhea and regained 20 - pound weight .
he has been well and continued under observation .
3. discussion we described a case of severe spruelike enteropathy which achieved a remarkable clinical improvement with suspension of olmesartan .
small bowel biopsy confirmed moderately severe spruelike manifestations including villous blunting and intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration .
celiac disease was excluded by negative conventional serology tests , the absence of hla class ii heterodimer hla - dq2 or hla - dq8 , and the absence of clinical response to a gluten - free diet .
virtually , all patients with celiac disease have the celiac disease - associated alleles , the dq2 or dq8 molecule [ 5 ] .
thus , the presence of those alleles provides a sensitivity close to 100 % for celiac disease and a very high negative predictive value for the disease [ 6 ] .
biopsy did not show subepithelial collagen depositions , increased crypt apoptosis , or crypt predominant lymphocytosis .
other less common enteropathies were excluded .
this case highlighted very similar clinicopathological manifestations presented in the previous case series of spruelike enteropathy associated with olmesartan [ 4 ] .
the study by rubio - tapia et al. described a group of 22 patients ( 13 women , median age of 69.5 years ) who presented with severe diarrhea and weight loss with a median of 18 kg loss .
most patients had been taking 40 mg of olmesartan daily for several months or years ( average of 3.1 years ) before developing symptoms .
clinical response was observed in all the patients after suspension of olmesartan .
in all patients , results of iga ttg antibody were negative , a gluten - free diet was not helpful , and baseline intestinal biopsies demonstrated villous atrophy with mucosal inflammation .
followup intestinal biopsies were performed in 18 patients ( 82 %) , and histologic recovery of the duodenum was documented in 17 patients .
we acknowledge that this case lacks information of histologic recovery after discontinuation of olmesartan .
however , given the achievement of clinical remission , it is very unlikely that the presence of villous blunting or mucosal inflammation persisted .
deliberate rechallenge test with olmesartan was not indicated because of the life - threatening nature of the syndrome .
resolution of the symptoms in the absence of clinicopathological evidence of other diseases associated with enteropathy suggests that the association is not likely to be a chance as the previous report by rubio - tapia et al. mentioned as well .
the mechanisms underlying spruelike enteropathy associated with olmesartan remain unclear .
given the time between the initiation of olmesartan and the development of symptoms , it is unlikely that clinical picture is the result of a type i hypersensitivity response .
one proposed mechanism is that the enteropathy is due to a cell - mediated immune response that results in damage to the small intestinal brush border .
angiotensin ii induces gene expression of transforming growth factor - ( tgf - ) beta .
the upregulation of tgf - beta levels is involved in damage to various organs , and the gene expressions are induced by angiotensin ii [ 7 ] .
in the gastrointestinal tract , tgf - beta plays a central role in the intestinal epithelial cells and the mucosal immune system to maintain a normal balance between proinflammatory and antiinflammatory factors [ 8 ] .
in conclusion , we report a very unique case describing an association of severe form of spruelike enteropathy and olmesartan .
although olmesartan has not been proved for the causality of spruelike enteropathy , our case supports the findings in the recently published first case series .
further investigation is warranted to elucidate the specific mechanism of olmesartan - associated enteropathy and to determine whether other drugs in the arb class can result in a similar adverse reaction .
until these questions are answered , it is important for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for olmesartan and potentially other arbs as precipitants of spruelike enteropathy .
conflict of interests the authors declare that they have no conflict of interests .

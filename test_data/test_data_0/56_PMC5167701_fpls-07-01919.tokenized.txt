a differentiated structure called " aril " has been described in seeds of several plant species during the course of evolution and might be considered as a supernumerary integument .
besides its ecological function in seed dispersal , the structure also represents a relevant character for systematic classification and exhibits important properties that impart agronomic value in certain species .
little is known about the molecular pathways underlying this morphological innovation because it is absent in currently used model species .
a remarkable feature of the seeds of passiflora species is the presence of a conspicuous aril .
this genus is known for the ornamental , medicinal , and food values of its species .
in view of the molecular resources and tools available for some passiflora species , we highlight the potential of these species as models for developmental studies of the aril .

an important question in plant biology is when and how these features emerged during evolution .
one of such novel features is the aril .
the aril is a differentiated structure present in seeds of several gymnosperm and angiosperm species , forming seed dispersal units .
in many species , the aril accumulates several nutritional compounds attracting and rewarding frugivorous animals .
there is a great amount of information available about morphological and molecular development of plant ovules and seeds and they can be used as initial clues to investigate aril development .
these appendages are often used in systematics classification , since its presence , absence , form , and function vary among taxa .
the well known model species do not exhibit this feature evidencing the need for novel models to study this specific structure .
a better understanding of the processes involved in aril origin and development is interesting and necessary due to its economical , ecological and phylogenetic importance .
aril origin and importance several plant species develop differentiated structures associated with their seeds , often constituting diaspores , which are plant dispersal units mostly related to their dispersion syndrome ( corner , 1976 ) .
some authors also believe that these structures originated as a protection mechanism for seeds and embryos , regardless of their role in dispersion ( mack , 2000 ) .
also associated to the ovule / seed , either one or more integuments are found .
the current theory of the evolution of integuments states that there are different evolutionary origins for the outer and inner integuments in flowering plants ( endress , 2011 ) .
in angiosperms , the inner integument is considered homologous to the single integument of extant and fossil gymnosperms ( reinheimer and kellogg , 2009 ) , and the outer integument may have been derived from a cupule / leaf - like structure found in several gymnosperms ( gasser et al. , 1998 ) .
the integuments may or may not originate appendages that perform a defined role in seed dispersion .
such seed appendages may be wings , spines , hairs , plumes , fibers , or fleshy tissues , receiving different denominations in the literature .
both gymnosperms and angiosperms evolved the habit of enveloping the seeds with a fleshy tissue ( lovisetto et al. , 2012 ) .
such tissue , called " aril ," generally accumulate sugars and other substances that will confer biological roles similar to those of fruits ( herrera , 1989 ) .
the use of the term " aril " is quite controversial in the literature .
it has been used both in a broader sense , referring to any fleshy structure associated with the seed , but also to designate structures with a specific anatomical origin .
according to corner ( 1976 ) , the term defines a structure varying from a fleshy to a more - or - less hard consistency , which develops from part of the ovule after fertilization and envelopes the seed partially or completely .
van der pijl ( 1972 ) preferred to distinguish these structures according to their anatomical origin , the aril being originated from the funiculus .
therefore , a structure developing from other parts of the ovule are usually called arillode , false aril , or aril - like structure ( figure 1 ) .
both , aril and arillode , are somehow associated with integuments .
in fact , some authors consider the " true " aril as a supernumerary integument ( maheshwari , 1950 ; kapil and vasil , 1963 ; endress , 2011 ) .
figure 1 anatomical origin of different fleshy seed appendages or aril - like structures .
areas in black represent the fleshy structures .
( a ) true aril - develops from the funiculus as a ring around it .
( b ) caruncle - develops from the micropilar region of the integument .
( c ) strophiole - develops from the raphe .
( d ) sarcotesta - involves the differentiation of the outermost layer of the outer integument after fertilization .
in the dashed box ( b,c ) , structures considered as " arillodes. " as arils are generally fleshy structures , they are of extreme importance because during their development and ripening they accumulate substances that confer properties that not only attract dispersion agents , but also arouse interest for human consumption .
arils are very common in tropical and subtropical species and might accumulate oils ( e.g. , ricinus communis ) , flavor - and aroma - rich compounds ( myristica fragrans ) , nutrients , and sugars ( passiflora edulis ) , among other substances .
aril ontogeny few studies describe the ontogeny and / or morphological aspects of aril formation and associate these with ovule development ; this lack of information probably led to its controversial nomenclature .
additionally , the current model plant species do not exhibit this unique structure , making it difficult to characterize its development , especially at the molecular level .
aril developmental stages were observed in some species of passiflora ( raju , 1956 ; singh , 1962 ; dathan and singh , 1973 ) , and described in greater detail in p. suberosa and turnera ulmifolia ( kloos and bouman , 1980 ) .
it has also been described in leguminosae , such as eriosema glaziovii ( grear and dengler , 1976 ) , cytisus striatus , and c. multiflorus ( rodriguez - riano et al. , 2006 ) .
more recently , the development of an aril was described in celastraceae , however , the authors showed that the origin of the aril - like structure was not from the funiculus , calling it " caruncula " ( zhang et al. , 2011 ) .
aril development has been divided into stages by some authors , and ontogenetic descriptions suggest that it is a pre - anthesis event originating during megagametogenesis from periclinal divisions of epidermal cells of the funiculus , followed by anticlinal divisions , forming a ring or collar - like structure surrounding the ovule ( kloos and bouman , 1980 ; rodriguez - riano et al. , 2006 ) .
the specific stage of ovule development in which the aril initiates is not very clear in most of the reports .
the first divisions might be observed between the tetrad formation stage , when integuments are elongating toward the nucellus , and the beginning of megagametogenesis , when the outer integument has already enveloped the inner integument and the nucellus , forming the micropyle ( raju , 1956 ; singh , 1962 ; dathan and singh , 1973 ; grear and dengler , 1976 ; kloos and bouman , 1980 ; rodriguez - riano et al. , 2006 ) .
molecular mechanisms controlling integument initiation and growth as mentioned , the aril initiates during ovule development after the emergence and growth of integuments , resembling its development and exhibiting similar patterns of polarity .
thus , to speculate on whether the aril is an extra integument , and which molecular mechanisms might be involved in its identity and development , one should look closely to the molecular basis at the integument initiation and growth .
the development of the ovule in plants has been well characterized in model species , such as arabidopsis and petunia , through molecular genetic studies .
several genes involved in different events of ovule development where identified through mutant screening , as reviewed by angenent and colombo ( 1996 ) , gasser et al .
( 1998 ) , and schneitz ( 1999 ) .
the results obtained from mutant characterization , patterns of gene expression , and transcriptomic analyses in the last two decades allowed for the elucidation of regulatory networks controlling the initiation and development of integuments .
most of the genes characterized encode transcription factors , and molecular studies have been performed to better understand the means by which these factors act , and how they interact regulating integument morphogenesis .
integument formation marks the transition from the earlier established proximal - distal axis of the ovule primordia to an additional adaxial / abaxial polarity axis .
integument initiation is characterized by epidermal cell proliferation in a region between the nucellus and the funiculus .
the putative transcriptional regulator nozzle / sporocyteless ( nzz ) is required for maintaining the homeobox gene wuschel ( wus ) expression limited to the nucellus ( figure 2 ) ( sieber et al. , 2004 ) .
another factor restraining wus in the nucellus is the interaction of bel1 ( a homeodomain protein ) with an integument identity protein complex that represses wus in the chalaza , and activates inner no outer ( ino ) for outer integument development ( figure 2 ) ( brambilla et al. , 2008 ) .
wus , in turn , is sufficient to induce integument formation from the underlying chalazal tissue , since it generates downstream signals inducing meristematic activity even where it is not expressed ( gross - hardt et al. , 2002 ) .
an evidence for this is the induction of ectopic structures resembling integuments at the flanks of the funiculus , when wus is ectopically expressed in the chalaza , under the control of the aintegumenta ( ant ) promoter ( gross - hardt et al. , 2002 ) .
thus , ectopic wus expression caused by natural gain - of - function mutation ( s ) might be involved in the evolutionary origin of supernumerary integuments and , therefore , in structures resembling arils .
figure 2 summary of gene interactions during early integument development ( adapted from skinner et al. , 2004 ) .
modulation of these interactions might cause the formation of supernumerary integument and / or aril - like structures .
additionally , nzz is known to restrict both the homeodomain - leucine zipper gene phabulosa ( phb ) in the abaxial domain of the chalazal region where the inner integument initiates ( sieber et al. , 2004 ) , and ino , which is responsible for outer integument differentiation ( figure 2 ) ( schneitz et al. , 1997 ; villanueva et al. , 1999 ) .
ino expression , in turn , is restricted to the outer integument by wus and , more specifically , to the abaxial side , where it is repressed by superman ( sup ) .
thus , ino and sup are responsible for the asymmetric growth of the outer integument ( figure 2 ) ( meister et al. , 2002 ) .
bel1 , ant , and huellenlos ( hll ) also participate directly or indirectly in ino negative spatial regulation ( villanueva et al. , 1999 ) .
these antagonistic relations control integument polarity .
an additional mutant in which both integuments are present , but exhibits aberrant features is worth mentioning .
the unicorn ( unc ) mutation results in excrescences emerging from the outer integument ( schneitz et al. , 1997 ) .
later on , unc was found to encode an agc viii kinase that directly interacts with and represses the activity of aberrant testa shape ( ats ) , a transcriptional regulator belonging to the kanadi family ( figure 2 ) ( enugutti et al. , 2012 ; enugutti and schneitz , 2013 ) .
thus , ectopic expression of ats would provide another mechanism by which additional initiation and growth of integument - derived tissue may occur , therefore indicating an alternative possible molecular mechanism underlying the evolutionary origin of aril or aril - like structures .
considering the amount of information on regulatory networks for integument initiation and growth , along with the fact that most of these mechanisms are conserved among different taxa , and the known morphoanatomy of arils , it becomes possible to identify the initial cues on the molecular basis of aril origin and development .
molecular aspects of the " ripening " of fleshy seed structures the development of fleshy seed structures such as the aril can be divided in three main stages : ( 1 ) initiation , which includes cell proliferation ; ( 2 ) growth , with cell expansion , mainly ; and ( 3 ) accumulation of storage products , which would be equivalent to a " ripening " stage .
as we are assuming a similarity between integument and aril development , we considered the first two stages in the previous section , and we will now consider the third stage .
since gymnosperms do not form ovaries that will develop into fruits after fertilization , many species developed fruit - like fleshy structures around their seeds to attract frugivorous animals that act as seed dispersers ( herrera , 1989 ) .
because of its importance in the formation of reproductive structures in both gymnosperms and angiosperms , the involvement of mads - box genes in the development of fleshy structures was investigated in ginkgo biloba and taxus baccata , both gymnosperms ( lovisetto et al. , 2012 , 2013 , 2015a ) , and in magnolia grandiflora , a basal angiosperm ( lovisetto et al. , 2015b ) .
gene expression analyses showed that agamous , agl6 ( a gene phylogenetically close to the sepallata clade ) , and tm8 - like genes , are involved in the development of fleshy structures in both the sarcotesta of ginkgo and the aril of taxus , regardless of their anatomical origin ( lovisetto et al. , 2012 ) .
moreover , activated forms of agl6 ( agl6 : : vp16 ) triggered ectopic outgrowths on the surface of reproductive structures in arabidopsis ( koo et al. , 2010 ) .
a subfamily of mads - box , the b - sister genes , is believed to be required for the correct development of ovule and seed , with their expression analyzed in the gymnosperms mentioned above ( lovisetto et al. , 2013 ) .
the pattern of gene expression differed between these two species , being weaker throughout aril development in taxus , indicating that the involvement of b - sisters in the formation of fleshy fruit - like structures might be dependent of their origin .
in magnolia , with a fleshy tissue also originating from the seed tegument , agamous , agl6 , sepallata , and b - sister were also detected during the sarcotesta formation and growth ( lovisetto et al. , 2015b ) .
there is evidence that a common set of genes was recruited independently in distantly related taxa , regulating the development of all fleshy structures , regardless of their anatomic origin in , both , gymnosperms and angiosperms .
accordingly , a group of tomato mads - box genes have been implicated in fruit ripening , including members of the sepallata and b - sister clades ( vrebalov et al. , 2002 ; yasuhiro , 2016 ) .
altogether , these observations suggest that fleshy tissues that undergo physiological changes that involve tissue softening , pigmentation , and accumulation of sugars , aroma , and flavor ( or " ripening syndrome ," in general ) , appeared independently in fruits and seeds but are likely to be regulated , at the molecular level , by conserved pathways .
passiflora as a suggested model system to study aril development among the angiosperms , species belonging to passiflora are noteworthy regarding their aril , which are often cited in anatomical and morphological literature as an example of a true aril .
passiflora is the largest genus of the family passifloraceae with over 500 species , mostly originated in neotropical regions , with hundreds of species throughout latin america ( kugler and king , 2004 ; ulmer and macdougal , 2004 ) .
passiflora also include commercial species , such as p. edulis , p. alata , and p. incarnata , which are important for their ornamental , medicinal , and food values , the latter given specifically by the aril in which juice is produced and accumulated .
typically , the fruits of passiflora are indehiscent berries , rarely a dehiscent capsule , very variable in shape , size , and color , and in general produces a mucilaginous or aqueous acidic pulp , forming a cupuliform or saccate aril , covering each of numerous seeds ( figure 3 ) ( cervi , 1997 ; dhawan et al. , 2004 ) .
passionfruit propagation is mainly carried out by seeds ( pereira and dias , 2000 ) , and the aril works as a reward for its dispersing agents ( ulmer and macdougal , 2004 ) , therefore , being directly related to the reproductive success of the wild species ( fenster et al. , 2004 ) , which highlights the ecological importance of this structure .

bars : a,d = 1 cm ; b = 0.5 mm ; c = 1 mm. studies about the aril ontogeny in passiflora are scarce , although it has been addressed in descriptions of the embryology or seed coat structure of passifloraceae ( raju , 1956 ; singh , 1962 ; dathan and singh , 1973 ; kloos and bouman , 1980 ) .
the first mention of aril initiation in passiflora is from p. suberosa and describes it as a ring around the distal area of the funiculus ( kratzer , 1918 in kloos and bouman , 1980 ) .
later studies also refer to the aril primordium as a rim , collar or ring around the funiculus in several species of the family , p. calcarata ( raju , 1956 ; singh , 1962 ) , p. foetida ( singh , 1962 ) , p. caerulea , p. molissima ( dathan and singh , 1973 ) , and p. edulis ( dathan and singh , 1973 ; corner , 1976 ) .
these authors describe the origin of the aril as dermal , epidermal or hypodermal , and are not precise whether it develops from the funiculus , exostome , hilum , micropyle or raphe .
a more detailed case study of aril development was performed using p. suberosa and t. ulmifolia , ( kloos and bouman , 1980 ) .
according to this description , the aril is initiated during megagametogenesis by periclinal and anticlinal divisions of dermal cells , forming a rim around the funiculus from the raphe to the outer integument region at the micropyle ( kloos and bouman , 1980 ) .
differences among species occur mainly after fertilization .
the aril of p. suberosa continues to grow , covers the micropyle , and by division of its apical cells , equally envelopes the developing seed , while the aril of t. ulmifolia grows unilaterally leaving the exostome exposed .
in spite of these descriptions of the initiation and development of the aril in passiflora species , the molecular mechanisms implicated in these processes have not been described yet .
few studies addressed gene expression in passiflora arils , such as the analysis of differential expression among peetr1 , peers1 , and peers .
these genes encode proteins involved in ethylene perception in passiflora fruit tissues , with higher levels of mrna in arils than in seeds during fruit ripening ( mita et al. , 1998 ; mita et al. , 2002 ) .
nevertheless , these focused mainly on fruit ripening and , therefore , in genes involved in later aril developmental stages , and not in the identity and differentiation of this specialized structure .
although in recent decades there has been a breakthrough in genome sequencing and genomic data analysis from crop species , efforts for entire genome sequencing were not done in passiflora species , and very little is known about the genomics of this genus .
the currently available sequence data in public databases are molecular markers used in phylogenetic and genetic diversity studies , such as microsatellites ( oliveira et al. , 2005 , 2008 ; padua et al. , 2005 ; caze et al. , 2012 ; cerqueira - silva et al. , 2012 , 2014 ) , and internal transcribed spacers ( muschner et al. , 2003 ; yockteng and nadot , 2004 ) .
on the other hand , specific transcript and genomic libraries for passiflora have been constructed : a database of expressed sequence tags ( ests ) from libraries derived from p. edulis and p. suberosa reproductive tissues ( cutri and dornelas , 2012 ) , and a large - insert bacterial artificial chromosome ( bac ) library of p. edulis ( santos et al. , 2014 ) .
these are very resourceful for genomic studies allowing a greater understanding of gene structure and function , and the process of differentiation of complex morphological characters , which provide the diversity found among plants , such as the aril .
another useful resource that should aid these functional and developmental studies is the availability of genetic transformation and in vitro regeneration protocols for passiflora species .
such protocols where generated by the large number of studies aiming at the genetic improvement of passion fruit , that have been carried out since the 1990s ( cerqueira - silva et al. , 2014 ) , mainly to obtain transgenic plants resistant to the woodiness virus in p. edulis ( manders et al. , 1994 ; alfenas et al. , 2005 ; trevisan et al. , 2006 ; monteiro - hara et al. , 2011 ) , and p. alata ( correa et al. , 2015 ) .
several protocols for in vitro regeneration via organogenesis or somatic embryogenesis for a large number of passiflora species where established aiming at germplasm preservation , and recovery of transgenic plants , as reviewed by vieira and carneiro ( 2004 ) and otoni et al .
( 2013 ) .
although designed for breeding purposes , these methodologies are important tools to study the molecular basis of aril development .
novel genomic editing tools , such as the crispr / cas9 technology , will also help in the genetic and molecular analysis of aril development .
conclusion arils are accessory seed structures present in both gymnosperms and angiosperms , being important for seed dispersal , and might possess economic importance .
nonetheless , aril evolutionary origin and ontogenesis are largely unknown , with , both , structural and molecular information lacking and needed .
here we established parallels between ovule integuments and arils that might help the design of further studies .
our testable statements need a novel model species , since the traditional plant models do not develop arils .
we postulate that passiflora species are good candidates for such needed model .

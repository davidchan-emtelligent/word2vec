neuroblastomas are the most common extracranial solid tumors in children and arise from the embryonic neural crest .
mycn - amplification is a feature of ~ 30 % of neuroblastoma tumors and portends a poor prognosis .
neural crest precursors undergo epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) to gain migratory potential and populate the sympathoadrenal axis .
neuroblastomas are posited to arise due to a blockade of neural crest differentiation .
we have recently reported effects of a novel met inducing compound ml327 ( n - ( 3 - ( 2 - hydroxynicotinamido ) propyl ) - 5 - phenylisoxazole - 3 - carboxamide ) in colon cancer cells .
herein , we hypothesized that forced epithelial differentiation using ml327 would promote neuroblastoma differentiation .
in this study , we demonstrate that ml327 in neuroblastoma cells induces a gene signature consistent with both epithelial and neuronal differentiation features with adaptation of an elongated phenotype .
these features accompany induction of cell death and g1 cell cycle arrest with blockage of anchorage - independent growth and neurosphere formation .
furthermore , pretreatment with ml327 results in persistent defects in proliferative potential and tumor - initiating capacity , validating the pro - differentiating effects of our compound .
intriguingly , we have identified destabilization of myc signaling as an early and consistent feature of ml327 treatment that is observed in both mycn - amplified and mycn - single copy neuroblastoma cell lines .
moreover , ml327 blocked mycn mrna levels and tumor progression in established mycn - amplified xenografts .
as such , ml327 may have potential efficacy , alone or in conjunction with existing therapeutic strategies against neuroblastoma .
future identification of the specific intracellular target of ml327 may inform future drug discovery efforts and enhance our understanding of myc regulation .
ml327 neuroblastoma mycn neural crest epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition introduction neuroblastomas are the most common extracranial solid tumors in children , accounting for 10 % of cancer - related deaths in children [ 1 ] .
children afflicted with neuroblastoma are risk - stratified based upon age at diagnosis , stage of tumor progression , and biologic features including the presence of mycn - amplification [ 2 , 3 ] .
mycn - amplification is present in ~ 30 % of all neuroblastomas and overexpression of n - myc is sufficient to drive neuroblastoma - like tumors in animal models , highlighting the critical role of this oncogene in neuroblastoma development and progression [ 4 , 5 ] .
neuroblastomas arise from neural crest derivatives and may develop anywhere along the sympathoadrenal axis , most commonly in the adrenal medulla [ 3 ] .
neural crest precursors develop from the dorsal neural tube , where the cells undergo epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) to gain migratory potential and populate the sympathetic nervous system [ 3 , 6 ] .
this process is characterized by loss of e - cadherin within adherens junctions and destabilization of tight junctions that mediate cell adhesion .
during normal sympathoadrenal development , post - migratory neural crest cells express high levels of n - myc , where it regulates the ventral migration and expansion of neural crest cells [ 6 ] .
n - myc protein levels gradually decrease as the neural crest precursors differentiate into sympathetic neurons , suggesting that sympathoadrenal maturation requires low or absent n - myc expression [ 7 ] .
as such , aberrantly high n - myc is thought to contribute to neuroblastoma tumorigenesis at least in part by promoting a persistent mesenchymal phenotype within neuroblastomas .
the emt changes observed in early neural crest migration parallels those observed in epithelial carcinoma metastasis [ 8 , 9 ] .
acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype has been linked to advanced stage disease , chemoresistance , and radiation resistance in epithelial carcinomas , suggesting that reversal of emt using small molecules may represent a novel anti - cancer strategy [ 8 - 10 ] .
as previously reported , we conducted a high throughput chemical probe screen of 83,200 small molecules to identify novel compounds capable of inducing the re - expression of e - cadherin in colon and lung carcinoma cells exhibiting emt features [ 11 , 12 ] .
chemical optimization of an effective initial " hit " yielded approximately 400 chemical derivatives , from which we identified ml327 ( n - ( 3 - ( 2 - hydroxynicotinamido ) propyl ) - 5 - phenylisoxazole - 3 - carboxamide ) as a potent inducer of mesenchymal - to - epithelial transition ( met ) in epithelial cancers and that also blocks cancer invasiveness [ 12 - 14 ] .
in the present study , we hypothesized that treatment with the met induction agent ml327 would induce differentiation in neural crest - derived neuroblastoma tumor cells .
herein , we demonstrate that ml327 induces morphological , behavioral , and gene signature changes patterns consistent with differentiation .
intriguingly , we also demonstrate that ml327 arrests neuroblastoma cell growth and transcriptionally suppresses myc expression in neuroblastomas .
furthermore , we demonstrate that ml327 alters the proliferative potential and tumor - initiating capacity of neuroblastoma cells and that ml327 treatment blocks the growth of established neuroblastoma xenografts .
together , these findings suggest that ml327 is a novel chemical probe that blocks myc expression in neuroblastomas and may represent a lead compound for further development of novel therapeutics for this aggressive pediatric solid tumor .
results ml327 initiated g1 cell cycle arrest and cell death in neuroblastoma cells based on our prior observations in carcinoma cell lines , we first sought to determine the effects of ml327 on neuroblastoma growth in vitro .
for our initial characterization , we performed an adherent colony forming assay on seven neuroblastoma cell lines wherein cells were seeded at a clonal density and treated with either ml327 ( 10 mum ) or vehicle for a period of 7 - 10d ( figure 1a , 1b ) .
treatment with ml327 induced an elongated morphology in neuroblastoma cells .
representative images of be ( 2 ) - c and lan1 neuroblastoma cells are shown ( figure 1a ) .
these phenotypic changes were associated with marked inhibition ( at least 14 - fold ) in adherent colony formation in all of the tested neuroblastoma cell lines ( figure 1b ) .
we then utilized our tetrazolium - based assay to conduct a concentration response analysis of ml327 in be ( 2 ) - c , lan1 , imr32 , and sh - sy5y cell lines to estimate the ic50 value for ml327 after 72 h treatment ( figure 1c , supplementary figure 1a - 1c ) .
the calculated ic50s for be ( 2 ) - c , lan1 , imr32 , and sh - sy5y were 4 , 6 , 10 , and 5 mum , respectively ( figure 1c , supplementary figure 1a - 1c ) .
thus , ml327 inhibits neuroblastoma growth in the low micromolar range (< 10 mum ) in vitro .
to demonstrate the timing of growth inhibition , we treated neuroblastoma cell lines with ml327 ( 10 mum ) and measured cellular viability over a 4d time course ( figure 1d , supplementary figure 1d - 1f ) .
significant growth inhibition was first noted by day 2 in be ( 2 ) - c and sh - sy5y cells and by day 3 in lan1 and imr32 cells .

( c ) representative concentration - dependent cellular viability plot for be ( 2 ) - c cells with an estimated ic50 of 4 microm .
( d ) time course plot of cellular viability in be ( 2 ) - c cells using cck - 8 colorimetric assay .
( e ) cell cycle analysis with propidium iodide demonstrates enhanced g1 cell cycle arrest and induction of subg0 phase at 48 h following treatment .
( f , g ) anchorage - independent growth and sphere forming frequency ( sff ) is blocked in be ( 2 ) - c cells by treatment with ml327 ( 10 microm ) .
we performed cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry with propidium iodide to determine how ml327 is altering neuroblastoma growth .
be ( 2 ) - c cells treated with ml327 demonstrated g1 cell cycle arrest with a concordant decrease in s phase population , and a significant increase in the sub g0 population ( figure 1e ) .
enhancement of the subg0 population represents cells that are undergoing dna fragmentation and cell death .
taken together , these findings demonstrate that ml327 impairs neuroblastoma growth via induction of g1 cell cycle arrest and cell death .
we further validated the effects of ml327 on neuroblastoma growth in vitro by quantifying anchorage - independent growth and sphere - forming frequency .
anchorage - independent growth is generally regarded as a hallmark of transformation , while the sphere - forming population of neuroblastomas has an enriched tumor - initiating capacity [ 15 , 16 ] .
i - type be ( 2 ) - c cells are high sphere and colony - forming neuroblastoma cell lines [ 17 , 18 ] .
concurrent treatment with ml327 completely abolished the ability of be ( 2 ) - c cells to develop soft agar colonies ( figure 1f ; 0 vs. 95 colonies ; p < 0.0001 ) .
furthermore , we estimated the sphere - forming frequency of be ( 2 ) - c cells in the presence of ml327 and demonstrated a marked inhibition in sphere formation ( figure 1g ; 2.2 vs. 5.9 % ; p < 0.0001 ) in the presence of ml327 ( 10 mum ) .
these findings suggest that ml327 represses the transformation potential and may block the tumor - initiating cell population of neuroblastomas .
ml327 induces a neuroepithelial - like differentiation signature in neuroblastoma based upon the morphologic , behavioral , and cell cycle arrest features induced by ml327 , we postulated that ml327 enhanced neuroblastoma differentiation .
we completed rna sequencing utilizing rna isolated from be ( 2 ) - c cells treated with ml327 or vehicle for 7d ( supplementary table 1 ) .
for our initial characterization , we utilized the neuroblastoma differentiation signature described by frumm et al .
[ 19 ] .
gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated enrichment of the neuroblastoma differentiation signature with ml327 treatment ( figure 2a ; supplementary figure 2a ) .
further , enrichment analysis for gene ontology demonstrated significant enrichment of epithelial ( figure 2b ; supplementary figure 2b ) and neuronal development ( figure 2e ; supplementary figure 2c ) , and neuroepithelial cell differentiation ( supplementary figure 2f , 2g ) .
expression of e - cadherin ( cdh1 ) and the formation of occludin - containing ( ocln ) tight junctions are two hallmarks of epithelial differentiation .
ml327 induced the expression of cdh1 in all seven of the neuroblastoma cell lines with a 50 to 1,400 - fold induction of cdh1 mrna expression ( figure 2c ) .
more modest increases in ocln expression were also observed , ranging from 1.5 to 50 - fold induction ( figure 2d ) .
other notable epithelial markers enriched by ml327 in our rna sequencing analysis include : cd109 , gli3 , cdh3 ( supplementary figure 2b ) .
the trk family of neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinases are neuronal hallmarks that play critical roles in neuroblastoma survival and differentiation .
specifically , trka ( ntrk1 ) and c ( ntrk3 ) expression are associated with favorable outcomes in neuroblastoma , while trkb ( ntrk2 ) is associated with biologically aggressive disease [ 20 ] .
we surveyed our seven neuroblastoma cell lines for ntrk1,2,3 expression and demonstrated enhanced mrna levels for ntrk2 and ntrk3 in all tested cell lines ( figure 2g , 2h ) , as well as enhanced ntrk1 expression in 5 of 7 experimental cell lines ( figure 2f ) .
taken together , these findings suggest that ml327 induces a gene signature consistent with neuroblastoma differentiation , featuring characteristics of partial neuroepithelial differentiation .

ml327 blocked myc expression in neuroblastomas to further elucidate a potential mechanism by which ml327 may be exerting its anti - tumorigenic effects in neuroblastoma , we performed gene set enrichment analysis utilizing the hallmark gene sets provided through the broad institute. of interest , we determined that two hallmark myc target gene sets were negatively associated with ml327 treatment ( figure 3a , 3b ; supplementary figure 2d , 2e ) .
these findings were supported by a five - fold reduction repression of mycn transcription levels in our be ( 2 ) - c cells by rna sequencing ( supplementary table 1 ) .
this finding led us to hypothesize that ml327 may be repressing myc signaling in our neuroblastoma cell lines .
figure 3 ml327 blocks myc signaling in neuroblastoma ( a , b ) rna sequencing demonstrates repression of hallmark myc target gene sets by gsea ( c ) western blots demonstrate that ml327 inhibits c - myc expression and n - myc protein expression levels in mycn - single and mycn - amplified neuroblastoma cell lines , respectively .

( e ) co - treatment with cycloheximide demonstrates that ml327 fails to alter protein half - life of myc .
( f ) rt - pcr demonstrates early changes in mycn mrna levels in the presence of ml327 .
( g ) co - treatment with actinomycin d demonstrates that ml327 fails to alter mrna half - life .
thirty percent of neuroblastomas have mycn - amplification featuring elevated n - myc expression , while the c - myc is predominantly expressed in mycn - single copy neuroblastomas .
we first validated that ml327 represses myc signaling by demonstrating repression of n - myc protein expression in the treatment of 4 mycn - amplified neuroblastoma cell lines and c - myc repression in 3 mycn - single copy cell lines ( figure 3c ) .
thus , ml327 blocked the expression of myc family of oncogenic transcription factors in all tested neuroblastoma cell lines .
we further characterized the timing and mechanism of n - myc repression using our mycn - amplified be ( 2 ) - c cell line .
immunoblotting time course demonstrated early repression of n - myc expression within 2 h of treatment with ml327 ( 10 microm ; figure 3d ) .
p21 / cip1 expression was also induced by 2 h. changes in n - myc and p21 / cip1 expression temporally preceeded the reexpression of e - cadherin .
intriguingly , p53 levels were suppressed by treatment with ml327 , suggesting that myc repression and p21 induction occurs via a p53 - independent mechanism ( figure 3d ) .
to further clarify the mechanism of n - myc repression , we completed cycloheximide chase experiments demonstrating no significant changes in protein half - life between ml327 treatment and vehicle control treated cells ( 36 vs. 31 min ; figure 3e ) .
also , mycn mrna expression levels were significantly decreased two - fold within 2 h of treatment suggesting that the decrease in n - myc levels after ml327 treatment was due to downregulation of mycn mrna expression ( figure 3f ) .
no changes in mrna stability were noted with co - treatment with actinomycin d ( figure 3g ) .
as such , ml327 treatment appears to result in decreased mycn transcription .
bromodomain inhibitors , such as jq1 , have demonstrated considerable preclinical promise for the treatment of myc - driven malignancies , including neuroblastomas [ 21 , 22 ] .
we sought to determine whether jq1 was able to recapitulate the epithelial features observed with ml327 treatment .
notably , jq1 failed to induce e - cadherin protein expression ( supplementary figure 3a ) .
we also sought to determine whether rna interference of myc was sufficient for the induction of epithelial differentiation in neuroblastoma .
myc silencing alone failed to induce e - cadherin re - expression and myc silencing failed to augment e - cadherin expression in the presence of ml327 ( supplementary figure 3b ) .
taken together , these findings suggest that ml327 both represses the myc signaling cascade and independently modulates the expression of critical epithelial markers , such as e - cadherin .
ml327 pretreatment blocked the proliferative potential and tumor - initiating capacity of neuroblastomas given that ml327 induces transcriptional , morphologic , and cell cycle arrest features consistent with differentiation , we sought to determine whether pretreatment with ml327 alters the proliferative potential and tumor - initiating capacity of neuroblastoma cells even after withdrawal of compound .
be ( 2 ) - c cells were pretreated for 1 week with ml327 ( 10 microm ) or vehicle and subsequently plated to quantify proliferation , adherent colony formation , soft agar colony formation , and neurosphere formation .
intriguingly , ml327 - pretreated cells demonstrated reduced proliferative potential in both tetrazolium - based ( p < 0.0001 ) and adherent 2d colony formation ( 41 vs. 400 ; p < 0.0001 ; figure 4a , 4b ) demonstrating persistent defects in proliferation even after removal of ml327 .
similarly , ml327 - pretreated be ( 2 ) - c cells grew significantly fewer soft agar colonies ( figure 4c ; 74 vs. 16 ; p < 0.0001 ) and neurospheres ( figure 4d ; 6.6 vs. 0.4 % ; p < 0.0001 ) , as compared with vehicle - pretreated cells .
as such , pretreatment with ml327 decreases the proliferative potential , anchorage - independent growth , and tumor - initiating cell population of neuroblastomas .
figure 4 pretreatment with ml327 blocks neuroblastoma proliferative potential and tumor - initiating capacity pretreating be ( 2 ) - c cells with ml327 ( 10 microm ) decreased proliferative potential as measured by ( a ) cell viability with cck - 8 assay , ( b ) adherent clonogenesis , ( c ) soft - agar colony formation , and ( d ) sphere - forming frequency .
( e ) pretreatment ( 7d ) of be ( 2 ) - c cells with ml327 limits their tumor - initiating capacity in a subcutaneous xenograft model .
( f ) be ( 2 ) - c cells pretreated with vehicle were injected into the left subscapular region , while ml327 - pretreated cells with injected on the right side .
representative images were obtained two weeks following injection .
given these persistent in vitro findings , we next evaluated whether pretreatment with ml327 could alter the ability of be ( 2 ) - c cells to develop subcutaneous xenografts .
after 7d of pretreatment , identical numbers ( 1 x 106 ) of vehicle pre - treated cells were injected into the left flank , and ml327 - pretreated cells were injected into the right flank .
after two weeks , 80 % ( 8 out of 10 ) of vehicle pre - treated cells had developed tumor on the left side , while no tumors ( 0 out of 10 ) developed on the right side where ml327 - pretreated cells were implanted ( figure 4e , 4f ) .
together , these findings are consistent with ml327 inducing differentiation in neuroblastomas , as evidenced by persistent defects in proliferative potential and tumor - initiating capacity .
ml327 blocked growth of established neuroblastoma xenografts given the established role of n - myc in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis , we sought to characterize the preclinical efficacy of ml327 in established neuroblastoma xenografts .
athymic male mice were injected with 2 x 106 be ( 2 ) - c cells into the subcutaneous flank and allowed to grow into established tumors of 75 - 100 mm3 .
mice developing tumors were then randomized to receive either ml327 ( 50 mg / kg ) or vehicle by intraperitoneal twice daily injections for two weeks .
tumor volumes were measured daily .
ml327 treatment significantly reduced tumor volume by three - fold over the two - week treatment period ( figure 5a ; p = 0.02 ) .
similarly , tumor explant weights were approximately three - fold smaller in the ml327 - treated mice ( figure 5b ; p = 0.01 ) .
figure 5 growth inhibition of neuroblastoma xenografts by ml327 be ( 2 ) - c subcutaneous xenografts were established and randomized to receive intraperitioneal injection with ml327 ( 50 mg / kg b.i.d. ; n = 9 ) or vehicle control ( n = 8 ) .
( a ) tumor volumes were measured daily and ( b ) explant weights were obtained at time of sacrifice following 2 weeks of treatment .
( c ) daily weight measurements demonstrated a 12 % weight loss in ml327 - treated mice .
( d ) mycn mrna levels were measured by rt - pcr using rna isolated from ml327 and control tumors .
( e ) representative h & e sections were obtained from ml327 and vehicle - treated tumors and demonstrated large areas of necrosis within ml327 - treated tumors ( 10x magnification ) .
( f ) residual , viable neuroblastoma cells in ml327 - treated remained poorly differentiated ( 40x magnification ) .
ml327 - treated mice demonstrated normal activity while receiving treatment with ml327 .
interestingly , mice treated with ml327 lost 12 % more body weight than vehicle treated mice ( figure 5c ) .
the majority of the weight loss occurred in the first four days of treatment , after which their weights stabilized , demonstrating potential side effects that may be associated with ml327 treatment ( figure 5c ) .
we collected blood from four ml327 - treated and three vehicle control - treated mice to perform laboratory analysis to discern evidence of toxicity .
no significant differences in hematologic , immunologic , liver function , or kidney function were appreciable .
we isolated rna from ml327 and vehicle - treated tumors to determine whether ml327 had comparable effects on mycn and cdh1 expression to those observed in vitro .
importantly , ml327 treatment results in a two - fold decrease in mycn expression , confirming that ml327 inhibits xenograft mycn expression ( figure 5d ; p = 0.0035 ) .
intriguingly , cdh1 levels were not detectable from rna isolated from any of the xenografts that received two weeks of treatment .
histologic analysis of tumor samples was performed by a blinded , pediatric pathologist ( h.c. ) who noted large pools of coagulative necrosis within the ml327 - treated tumors (~ 30 % vs. < 10 % ; figure 5e ) .
the remaining viable neuroblastoma tissue was poorly differentiated ( figure 5f ) .
together , these findings suggest that ml327 suppresses mycn levels within neuroblastoma xenografts and induces cell death within xenografts .
we hypothesized that the pools of necrotic cells within the ml327 - treated tumors may have expressed cdh1 earlier in the treatment course .
as such , we completed a separate , pilot study to evaluate whether cdh1 expression was induced with a shorter duration ( 5 doses ) of ml327 treatment ( 50 mg / kg b.i.d ). with this shorter treatment course , cdh1 expression was detectable and the mrna levels were robustly induced compared to vehicle - treated tumors ( supplementary figure 4 ) .
this pilot study validates that ml327 is capable of inducing cdh1 expression within neuroblastoma xenografts and demonstrates conservation of the gene signature changes observed in vitro .
discussion neuroblastomas demonstrate considerable clinical and biologic heterogeneity with select tumors spontaneously regressing while others progress despite our most aggressive interventions [ 2 , 3 , 20 ] .
herein , we hypothesized that ml327 , an met induction agent identified in epithelial carcinomas , would elicit anti - tumorigenic effects in neural crest - derived neuroblastomas .
intriguingly , ml327 elicited striking changes in cell viability not previously observed in epithelial - derived cancers [ 14 ] .
we attribute these alterations in cell viability to induction of cell death and features of neuroblastoma differentiation in vitro .
specifically , ml327 successfully induces cell cycle arrest , morphologic changes , and gene expression signatures consistent with neuroepithelial differentiation ( figures 1 , 2 ; supplementary figure 2 ) .
we also demonstrate significant induction of the subg0 population by propidium iodide - based cell cycle analysis consistent with the onset of dna fragmentation and cell death .
immunoblotting for proteolysis - activated mediators of apoptosis ( parp and caspase 3 ) demonstrated minimal induction of parp cleavage and no caspase 3 cleavage , suggesting that cell death may be occurring by necrosis ( results not shown ) .
overall , these findings demonstrate the capacity of ml327 to elicit cell death and features of neuroepithelial differentiation within neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro .
intriguingly , we were able to block established mycn - amplified xenograft growth with intraperitoneal ml327 administration over a two week period ( figure 5a ) .
the most striking feature observed on histologic evaluation of ml327 - treated xenografts was the induction of large pools of coagulative necrosis with remaining , viable tumor being poorly differentiated ( figure 5e , 5f ) .
we were able to demonstrate suppression of mycn within these ml327 - treated xenografts , however cdh1 levels were undetectable by rt - pcr .
to remedy the discrepant cdh1 changes observed in vitro and in vivo , we conducted a pilot study and demonstrated that cdh1 was significantly enriched with a shorter period ml327 treatment ( supplementary figure 4 ) .
our working hypothesis is that there is a heterogenous uptake of ml327 within the xenografts and those neuroblastoma cells that express e - cadherin in the presence of ml327 subsequently succumb to cellular necrosis .
this possibility remains hypothetical and is a focus of on - going investigations .
c - myc and n - myc are the two predominant pro - tumorigenic members of the myc family driving cell cycle progression , angiogenesis , genomic instability , and metastasis [ 5 , 23 ] .
these features highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting the myc family oncogenes in the treatment of both pediatric and adult malignancies .
directly targeting the myc protein family has proven to be a vexing effort [ 23 , 24 ] .
recent advances have been made in targeting the transcription of myc through bromodomain inhibition or promoting protein degradation utilizing aurora kinase inhibitors [ 21 ] .
both of these families of compounds have demonstrated preclinical efficacy with inhibition of neuroblastoma cell growth , but early reports of resistance have emerged [ 25 - 28 ] .
in this study , we have identified a novel isoxazole - based compound that similarly destabilizes the myc signaling cascade .
notably , we have demonstrated both blockade of n - myc and c - myc expression , respectively within the mycn - amplified and mycn - single copy cell lines .
ml327 appears to transcriptionally regulate myc mrna levels .
these findings are associated with the induction of cell cycle arrest and blockade of anchorage - independent growth and neurosphere formation in vitro .
furthermore , we have demonstrated that ml327 is capable of blocking established xenograft growth and changes in mycn mrna levels in vivo .
a critical deficiency of our experiments with ml327 remains that we have yet to identify a direct intracellular effector of this small molecule .
efforts at labeling ml327 with radioisotopes , biotin , and iodine result in a loss of compound efficacy in vitro and identifying its potential binding partner is the focus of ongoing studies .
however , the phenotypic responses and gene signature elicited by ml327 treatment have considerable therapeutic potential .
in particular , myc can induce emt in driving tumor progression , but the reports demonstrate that this occurs post - transcriptionally [ 29 ] .
in conjunction with our previous work , we have demonstrated that ml327 is a novel small molecule that both represses myc transcription and transcriptionally activates cdh1 in both colon cancer cells and neuroblastomas [ 14 ] .
myc silencing utilizing rna interference is not sufficient to induce e - cadherin , and bromodomain inhibition fails to initiate reexpression of e - cadherin in be ( 2 ) - c cells despite successful myc blockade , highlighting the unique properties of ml327 ( supplementary figure 3 ) .
the transcriptional plasticity of myc expression has led to early development of resistance to bromodomain inhibitors [ 25 , 27 , 28 ] .
specifically , wnt - activation has been previously shown to mediate the reactivation of myc signaling in leukemia cells resistant to bromodomain inhibition [ 27 ] .
dual - treatment strategies with ml327 and bromodomain inhibitors offer the potential both for additive myc blockade and the potential tumor suppressor effects of e - cadherin .
intriguingly , e - cadherin has been shown to bind to and block beta - catenin nuclear localization [ 30 ] , suggesting a potential mechanism by which ml327 may potentiate or re - sensitize cancers to bromodomain inhibition .
such theoretical considerations merit further investigation and highlight the need to identify the precise mechanisms by which ml327 acts .
in conclusion , we have identified the isoxazole - based compound ml327 as a novel inhibitor of the myc signaling cascade in neuroblastoma .
these features inhibit the transformation potential , tumor - initiating capacity , and established xenograft growth of neuroblastomas .
myc signaling has previously been shown to have considerable transcriptional plasticity , and ml327 may have potential efficacy both alone or in conjunction with existing therapeutics .
future identification of the binding partner of ml327 will both inform future drug discovery efforts and enhance our understanding of myc regulation .

colonies were stained with 0.05 % crystal violet , photographed , and quantified .
sphere formation assay neurosphere formation was quantified by performing serial limiting dilution analysis in the presence and absence of ml327 ( 10 mum ) .
spheres were reared in neurobasal media supplemented with b27 , epidermal growth factor ( 20 ng / ml ) , and fibroblast growth factor ( 20 ng / ml ; invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) .
cells were plated onto an ultra - low attachment 96 - well plate at serial dilutions .
each well was scored for presence of sphere formation as previously described [ 31 ] .
cell cycle analysis cell cycle distribution was analyzed using flow cytometry .
1 x 106 cells were trypsinized , washed with pbs , and fixed in 70 % ethanol .
fixed cells were incubated with rnase ( 100 mug / ml ) , stained with propidium iodide ( 50 mug / ml ) , and analyzed on a 3 - laser bd lsrii ( bd biosciences , san jose , ca ) .
flow cytometry experiments were performed in the vumc flow cytometry shared resource .
rt - pcr and western blot analyses total rna was isolated and purified using an rneasy isolation kit with dnase digestion .
cdna was synthesized using the high - capacity cdna reverse transcription kit ( applied biosystems , carlsbad , ca ) .
specific target primers are , mycn ( forward 5 ' - gcttctacccggacgaagatg - 3 ' ; reverse 5 ' - cagctcgttctcaagcagcat - 3 ') , ntrk1 ( forward 5 ' - ttccatttcactcctcggctcagt - 3 ' ; reverse 5 ' - acgtcacgttcttcctgttgaggt - 3 ') , ntrk2 ( forward 5 ' - tcaatgccaggcaggtctcctaaa - 3 ' ; reverse 5 ' - ttggtgcagaattcccagcaaagg ) , ntrk3 ( forward 5 ' - tgcagtccatcaacactcaccaga - 3 ' ; reverse 5 ' - tgtagtgggtgggcttgttgaaga - 3 ') , ocln ( forward 5 ' - aggaaccgagagccaggt - 3 ' ; reverse 5 ' - ggatgagcaatgccctttag - 3 ') , cdh1 ( forward 5 ' - ttgacgccgagagctacac - 3 ' ; reverse 5 ' - gtcgaccggtgcaatctt - 3 ') , gapdh forward 5 ' - gttccaatatgattccaccc - 3 ' ; reverse 5 ' - tgagtccttccacgatacc - 3 ') .
amplification was performed for 40 cycles of 30 s at 95degreesc , 30 s at 55degreesc , and 40 s at 72degreesc .
gapdh was used as a control .
western blot analysis was performed using beta - actin as a loading control as described [ 32 ] .
rna sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis be ( 2 ) - c neuroblastoma cells ( n = 3 per group ) were reared in dmso or ml327 for 7d , and rna was collected using rneasy kits with dnase treatment .
processing of rna using a truseq stranded mrna sample prep kit was conducted according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( illumina , san diego , ca ) .
approximately 30 million 75 base pair single - end reads were generated , per sample .
we mapped the reads to the human genome hg19 using tophat - 2.0.10 [ 33 ] .
then , we counted the number of reads that fall into annotated genes by samtools - 0.1.19 [ 34 ] and htseq - 0.5.4p5 [ 35 ] using the method described by anders et al .
[ 36 ] .
for gene set enrichment analysis , gene set collections were from the molecular signatures database ( http :// www.broadinstitute.org / gsea / msigdb /) .
tumor - initiating capacity be ( 2 ) - c cells were pretreated for 1 week with ml327 ( 10 mum ) or vehicle ( dmso ) .
following 7 d of treatment , cells were trypsinized and resuspended in hbss at 1 x 106 cells / 100 mul .
ml327 and vehicle - pretreated cells were injected into the subcutaneous tissue lateral to the right and left scapular region , respectively .
mice were monitored twice weekly for the development of tumors over a two - week period .
growth of established xenografts male athymic nude mice ( 4 - 6 weeks old ) were maintained as described [ 37 ] .
all studies were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at vanderbilt university .
be ( 2 ) - c cells xenografts were established as previously described [ 37 ] .
briefly , 1 x 106 cells / 100 microl of hbss were injected subcutaneously into flanks using a 26 - gauge needle ( n = 10 per group ) .
mice were monitored daily for xenograft formation and assessed by measuring the two greatest perpendicular tumor diameter with venier calipers ( mitutoyo , aurora , il ) .
xenograft volumes were estimated using the following formula [( length x width2 )/ 2 ] .
once tumors reached 75 - 100 mm3 , mice were randomized to receive either 50 mg / kg of ml327 or control vehicle ( 70 % polyethylene glycol ) via intraperitoneal injection twice daily for 14d .
weight and tumor volume were recorded daily .
after completion of two weeks of treatment , mice were euthanized and tumors were excised , weighed , and rna was isolated .
statistical analysis for in vitro experiments , student 's t - test or one - way anova with tukey correction were used for two or >= 3 group experiments , respectively .
tumor explant weight was compared using student 's t - test .
serial tumor volume measurements were compared using a mixed effects model in stss using fixed effects of treatment and day with a random effect of mouse .
for all experiments , p < 0.05 was considered significant .

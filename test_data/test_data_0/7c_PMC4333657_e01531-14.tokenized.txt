burkholderia multivorans belongs to the burkholderia cepacia complex , which comprises opportunistic pathogens infecting cystic fibrosis ( cf ) patients .
here , we report the genome sequences and annotations of two sequential b. multivorans clinical isolates ( d2095 and d2214 ) displaying different traits .
the differences in the genomic contents of these isolates may provide clues regarding the evolution of b. multivorans within the airways of a cf patient .
cover - datejanuary / february 2015 genome announcement the burkholderia cepacia complex comprises 18 species of closely related betaproteobacteria capable of establishing infections in cystic fibrosis ( cf ) and immunocompromised patients ( 1 - 3 ) .
these microorganisms have large genomes and a high gene content , providing them with the ability to rapidly adapt and colonize different niches , like the airways of cf patients ( 4 ) .
within the b. cepacia complex , the species burkholderia multivorans is one of the most frequently isolated from cf patients ( 2 ) .
moreover , b. multivorans undergoes phenotypic changes while chronically colonizing cf airways , and mucoid - to - nonmucoid transitions within cf lungs have been reported ( 5 , 6 ) .
a genomic comparison between two b. multivorans sequential isolates that underwent a mucoid - to - nonmucoid morphotype transition within the cf lung is lacking .
here , we report the genome sequences of two isolates , d2095 and d2214 , isolated from the same cf patient attending a vancouver cf clinic .
d2095 was isolated from a throat swab in june 2006 and was highly mucoid in yeast - extract - mannitol ( yem ) solid medium due to exopolysaccharide production , while d2214 was isolated from a sputum sample in november 2006 and displayed a nonmucoid morphotype ( 5 ) .
an extensive phenotypic characterization of these isolates , together with transcriptomic profiling and morphotype stability studies , was performed ( 7 , 8 ) .
genomic dna from b. multivorans d2095 and d2214 was extracted and purified using the dneasy blood and tissue kit ( qiagen ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
genomic libraries were prepared using the truseq sbs kit version 5 ( illumina ) , and genome sequencing was performed using illumina hiseq 2000 technology , giving rise to paired - end libraries of 2 x 100 bp , with an insert size of approximately 300 bp (~ 1,000x coverage ) .
the raw paired - end reads of d2095 and d2214 were assembled using edena version 3.131028 ( 9 ) , and the assembly of the genomes was finished using sspace premium version 2.3 ( 10 ) .
for d2095 scaffolding , an additional paired - end library and a mate - pair library were used .
genomic dna of b. multivorans d2095 was resequenced using illumina hiseq 2000 technology , yielding an extra 2 x 100 - bp paired - end library , with an insert size of 300 bp (~ 80x coverage ) , and a 2 x 50 mate - pair library , with an insert size of 5 kb (~ 70x coverage ) .
the d2095 and d2214 genomes were assembled into 15 and 26 contigs , accounting for 6,668,882 bp and 6,465,997 bp and estimated g + c contents of 67.1 % and 67.4 % , respectively .
the d2214 assembly was more fragmented due to the nonusage of a mate - pair library during the scaffolding process .
both genome drafts were annotated using the ncbi prokaryotic genomes automatic annotation pipeline , which revealed that the d2095 isolate possesses 5,952 open reading frames ( orfs ) , whereas d2214 has 5,782 orfs .
a major genome deletion of 175 kb was identified in d2214 , consisting mainly of genes encoding hypothetical proteins .
we also identified in the d2214 genome a 37 - kb genome duplication of phage - related protein - coding genes .
further comparative genomics of both isolates will bring insights into the mechanisms of virulence / persistence and evolution employed by b. multivorans within the airways of a cf patient .
nucleotide sequence accession numbers .
the b. multivorans d2095 and d2214 whole - genome shotgun sequence projects were deposited in ddbj / embl / genbank under the accession numbers jfhp00000000 ( d2095 ) and jfhq00000000 ( d2214 ) .
the versions described in this paper are the first versions .

the anterior cingulate cortex ( acc ) plays an important role in higher brain functions including learning , memory , and persistent pain .
long - term potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission has been observed in the acc after digit amputation , which might contribute to plastic changes associated with the phantom pain .
here we report a long - lasting membrane potential depolarization in acc neurons of adult rats after digit amputation in vivo .
shortly after digit amputation of the hind paw , the membrane potential of intracellularly recorded acc neurons quickly depolarized from ~ - 70 mv to ~ - 15 mv and then slowly repolarized .
the duration of this amputation - induced depolarization was about 40 min .
intracellular staining revealed that these neurons were pyramidal neurons in the acc .
the depolarization is activity - dependent , since peripheral application of lidocaine significantly reduced it. furthermore , the depolarization was significantly reduced by a nmda receptor antagonist mk - 801 .
our results provide direct in vivo electrophysiological evidence that acc pyramidal cells undergo rapid and prolonged depolarization after digit amputation , and the amputation - induced depolarization in acc neurons might be associated with the synaptic mechanisms for phantom pain .
the anterior cingulate cortex ( acc ) is involved in sensory signal processing such as integration of general affect , cognition , and pain unpleasantness [ 1 - 6 ] .
neurons in the acc respond to peripheral nociceptive stimulation [ 7 - 10 ] .
it has been shown that digit amputation causes a long - lasting potentiation of the acc responses to peripheral electrical stimulation , which might contribute to the phantom limb pain [ 10,11 ] .
phantom limb pain is experienced in a limb that is no longer present .
about 50 - 80 % amputees suffer from phantom limb pain [ 12,13 ] .
recent studies have indicated that cortical reorganization occurs following digit or limb amputation [ 14,15 ] , which correlates with phantom limb pain or phantom limb sensation in most amputees [ 12,13 ] .
however , less information is available about the possible early changes within the acc after amputation .
recent studies using in vitro brain slice preparations showed that digit amputation in rats caused the loss of long - term depression ( ltd ) in the acc [ 7 ] .
here we employed intracellular recordings from anesthetized adult rats and reported a prolonged membrane depolarization in acc neurons after digit amputation of the hind paw .
male adult wistar rats ( 200 - 350 g ) were anesthetized with 1 - 2 % halothane .
the core body temperature was maintained at 37degreesc with a heating pad .
in vivo intracellular recording was performed as previously described [ 16,17 ] .
briefly , the animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame .
a craniotomy was performed in the region above the left acc ( ap : 1.0 - 3.7 mm , rl : 0.5 - 1.0 mm , h : 1.3 - 3.0 mm , bregma ) [ 18 ] .
the intracellular recording electrodes had a tip resistance of 40 - 70 m _ as filled with a solution of 4 % neurobiotin ( vector , ca , usa ) in 2 m potassium acetate .
the microelectrode was advanced slowly into the left acc to impale neurons .
after impalement , the neurons with a stable membrane potential of - 60 mv or greater and action potential amplitudes of at least 60 mv were selected for further study .
after a baseline recording , the 3rd digit of the hind paw was amputated with deep anesthesia ( 2 - 3 % halothane ) .
in some experiments , extracellular recording was simultaneously conducted in the acc with intracellular recording .
the extracellular recording electrodes had a tip resistance of ~ 4 m _ as filled with a solution of 2 m sodium chloride .
one femoral vein was cannulated in some animals for drug delivery .
data were digitized and stored with a macintosh computer using the data acquisition program axodata ( axon instruments , ca , usa ) .
values were presented as mean +/ - s.e.m. analysis of variance ( anova ) followed by post - hoc fisher 's test was used for statistical analysis .
changes were considered significant if p < 0.05 .
after each successful recording , neurobiotin was iontophoresed into the cell by passing depolarizing current pulses ( 2 hz , 300 ms , 1.0 - 1.5 na ) for 10 - 20 min .
at the end of the experiment , the animal was deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 0.01 m phosphate - buffered saline followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde .
the brain was removed and stored in fixative overnight .
coronal sections were cut at 80 mum thickness using a vibratome ( ted pella , ca , usa ) and incubated in 0.1 % horseradish peroxidase - conjugated avidin - d ( vector , ca , usa ) in 0.01 m potassium phosphate - buffered saline ( kpbs , ph 7.4 ) with 0.5 % triton x - 100 for 6 - 8 h at room temperature .
after detection of peroxidase activity with 3,3 ' - diaminobenzidine , the sections were examined in kpbs .
the sections containing labeled neurons were mounted on gelatin - coated slides and processed for light microscopy .
a total of 77 rats were used in the present study .
among these animals , intracellular and extracellular recording were performed simultaneously in 38 rats .
in order to compare electrophysiological responses in acc neurons before and after digit amputation , only one neuron was recorded from each animal .
all intracellularly stained neurons were successfully recovered , among which 36 were pyramidal neurons in acc .
two neurons were located in other regions of the brain and were excluded from the present study .
an example of intracellularly stained acc pyramidal neurons is presented in fig 1 .
two neurons were excluded from the present study because they were identified as neurons in other regions of the cortex .
because maintaining a prolonged intracellular recording is extremely difficult , extracellular recording alone was performed in the rest of animals ( n = 39 ) .
the dc potential response recorded by extracellular recording exhibited the same profiles as that of intracellular recording , so the data from intracellular recordings and extracellular recordings were pooled together .

the upper panel is the membrane potential intracellularly recorded from a pyramidal neuron , the middle panel is the intracellularly applied hyperpolarizing current pulses ( 1 hz , - 0.5 na , 200 ms ) , the lower panel is the simultaneous extracellular recording of dc potential in the acc region .
the arrows indicate the time of digit amputation .
approximately 2 min after amputation , the baseline membrane potentials from both recording quickly depolarize for approximately 50 mv and gradually returned to the control level in about 55 min .
after digit amputation , a dramatic membrane potential depolarization occurred in approximately 70 % of the neurons ( or animals ) recorded in acc ( 52 / 75 ) .
the depolarization occurred shortly after amputation with a latency of 0.52 +/ - 0.08 min ( n = 20 ) and quickly reached the maximal amplitude in approximately 2 minutes .
the amplitude of this amputation - induced depolarization was 53.5 +/ - 4.0 mv ( n = 24 ) with the membrane potential shifted from - 71.9 +/ - 1.2 mv to - 15.1 +/ - 5.3 mv from intracellular recordings ( n = 15 ) and from 0 mv to 50.1 +/ - 7.0 mv from extracellular recordings ( n = 9 ) .
the membrane potential slowly repolarized and returned to the control levels .
the duration of this depolarization was 43.0 +/ - 4.5 min ( n = 12 ) .
during intracellular recording , hyperpolarizing current pulses were delivered to monitor the membrane input resistance , which was indicated by the amplitude of membrane potential deflection .
no obvious changes in membrane input resistance were detected during the amputation - induced depolarization .
representative traces of simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recording of amputation - induced depolarization is shown in fig 1c .
the onset , time course , and the amplitude of these two traces were almost identical .
to elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying the amputation - induced depolarization , lidocaine ( 2 % , 1 ml , s.c. ) was locally injected into the right hind paw 5 min before the digit amputation .
in animals with lidocaine injection , the amplitude of depolarization significantly reduced to 34.0 +/ - 6.5 mv ( n = 10 , p < 0.01 ) and the duration dramatically shortened to 13.2 +/ - 2.8 ms ( n = 8 , p < 0.01 ) .
however , the latency of the onset of depolarization in lidocaine treated animals remained about the same as of control ones ( table 1 ) .
these results suggest that the amputation - induced depolarization is associated with the nociceptive stimulation .
table 1 effects of lidocaine and glutamate receptor antagonists on membrane depolarization control lidocaine mk - 801 latency 0.52 +/ - 0.08 ( n = 20 ) 0.48 +/ - 0.08 ( n = 10 ) 1.53 +/ - 0.15 * ( n = 10 ) amplitude ( mv ) 53.5 +/ - 4.0 ( n = 24 ) 34.0 +/ - 6.5 * ( n = 10 ) 28.5 +/ - 2.1 * ( n = 10 ) duration 43.0 +/ - 4.5 ( n = 12 ) 13.2 +/ - 2.8 * ( n = 8 ) 23.3 +/ - 6.0 * ( n = 8 ) * , p < 0.01 compared with control it has been shown that the glutamatergic activation is involved in the pain signal processing in acc [ 1,19,20 ] .
to reveal the involvement of glutamate receptors in amputation - induced depolarization , nmda receptor or non - nmda receptor antagonists were applied intravenously 5 min before the digit amputation .
in animals received nmda receptor blocker mk801 ( 1 mg / kg ) , the amplitude of depolarization significantly decreased to 28.5 +/ - 2.1 mv ( n = 10 , p < 0.01 ) and the duration reduced to 23.3 +/ - 6.0 min ( n = 8 , p < 0.01 ) .
in contrast , the latency to the onset of depolarization was significantly prolonged to 1.53 +/ - 0.15 min ( n = 10 , p < 0.01 ) ( table 1 ) .
these data indicate that the amputation - induced depolarization is mediated by nmda receptors .
accumulated evidence indicates that the acc is involved in pain processing .
surgical ablation or electrolytic lesion of the acc reduces pain related unpleasantness [ 2 ] .
activation of opioid receptors in the acc is accompanied by a reduction in pain [ 4 ] .
a number of functional imaging studies have shown consistently the acc activation during application of noxious stimuli to various parts of the body [ 5,21,22 ] .
recent reports demonstrate that the digit amputation causes the enhancement of sensory responses in the acc and the loss of ltd in in vitro acc slices for at least 2 weeks [ 7,10 ] .
interestingly , in the present study , we observed a dramatic membrane depolarization in acc neurons after digit amputation .
dramatic membrane depolarization has been observed during cortical spreading depression or cerebral ischemia [ 23,24 ] .
cortical spreading depression could be triggered by chemical , electrical or mechanical stimulation [ 25 ] while anoxic or ischemic depolarization is mainly caused by the failure of na + - k + pump due to energy depletion [ 26 ] .
the depolarization in acc neurons after amputation is most likely elicited by nociceptive stimulation as local anesthesia could significantly reduce the size of the depolarization .
however , local application of lidocaine could n't completely block the amputation - induced depolarization .
besides the possible insufficient dosage , it is possible that subcutaneous injection of lidocaine fails to block the sensory afferent fibers from the deep structures such as bones and joints .
glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system including the acc [ 7 ] .
growing evidence has recently shown that nmda receptors are involved in synaptic plasticity related to injury [ 2,27 ] .
nmda receptors are highly expressed in the acc [ 2 ] .
it has been demonstrated that nmda receptors play important roles in mediation of pain signal processing in the acc [ 7,28 ] .
data from the present study suggest that activation of nmda receptor is mainly responsible to the depolarization elicited by digit amputation .
coincided with our observation , nmda receptor antagonist mk801 blocks the cortical spreading depression [ 29 ] .
it is conceivable that membrane potential depolarization induced by amputation results in the enhancement of ca2 + influx through voltage - dependent ca2 + channels and nmda receptors , which might initiate the intracellular events leading to the alteration of synaptic transmission .
a recent study showed that calcium - stimulated adenylyl cyclase including ac1 and ac8 may play critical roles in inducing long - term potentiation in the acc neurons [ 30 ] , behavioral nociceptive responses to inflammation and tissue injury as well as allodynia related to nerve injury [ 31 ] .
the prolonged postsynaptic membrane depolarization in the acc pyramidal cells provides a novel induction mechanism for triggering long - term plastic changes within the acc such as ltp and ltd .
these rapid onset and prolonged changes in excitatory synaptic transmission activate a series of signaling pathways including stimulating new protein synthesis that may play important roles in amputation related cortical reorganization as reported in monkeys and humans .

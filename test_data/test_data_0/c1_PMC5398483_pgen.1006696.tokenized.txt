the cytoplasmic peptide : n - glycanase ( ngly1 in mammals ) is a de - n - glycosylating enzyme that is highly conserved among eukaryotes .
it was recently reported that subjects harboring mutations in the ngly1 gene exhibited severe systemic symptoms ( ngly1 - deficiency ) .
while the enzyme obviously has a critical role in mammals , its precise function remains unclear .
in this study , we analyzed ngly1 - deficient mice and found that they are embryonic lethal in c57bl / 6 background .
surprisingly , the additional deletion of the gene encoding endo - beta - n - acetylglucosaminidase ( engase ) , which is another de - n - glycosylating enzyme but leaves a single glcnac at glycosylated asn residues , resulted in the partial rescue of the lethality of the ngly1 - deficient mice .
additionally , we also found that a change in the genetic background of c57bl / 6 mice , produced by crossing the mice with an outbred mouse strain ( icr ) could partially rescue the embryonic lethality of ngly1 - deficient mice .
viable ngly1 - deficient mice in a c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background , however , showed a very severe phenotype reminiscent of the symptoms of ngly1 - deficiency subjects .
again , many of those defects were strongly suppressed by the additional deletion of engase in the c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background .
the defects observed in ngly1 / engase - deficient mice ( c57bl / 6 background ) and ngly1 - deficient mice ( c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background ) closely resembled some of the symptoms of patients with an ngly1 - deficiency .
these observations strongly suggest that the ngly1 - or ngly1 / engase - deficient mice could serve as a valuable animal model for studies related to the pathogenesis of the ngly1 - deficiency , and that cytoplasmic engase represents one of the potential therapeutic targets for this genetic disorder .
author summary ngly1 is a cytoplasmic de - n - glycosylating enzyme that is ubiquitously found in eukaryotes .
this enzyme is involved in a process referred to as endoplasmic reticulum - associated degradation ( erad ) , one of the quality control mechanisms for newly synthesized proteins .
a genetic disorder , ngly1 - deficiency , caused by mutations in the ngly1 gene has recently been discovered .
however , the precise mechanism for the pathogenesis of this devastating disease continues to remain unclear .
we report herein that ngly1 - deficient mice are embryonically lethal in a c57bl / 6 background .
surprisingly , the lethality was suppressed by crossing the mice with an outbred mouse strain ( icr ) , suggesting that the phenotypic consequence of ngly1 is greatly influenced by their genetic background .
in both cases , the additional deletion of engase in ngly1 - deficient mice could strongly mitigate the phenotypes .
interestingly , the remaining defects in ngly1 - deficient or ngly1 / engase - deficient mice were reminiscent of the symptoms of subjects with an ngly1 - deficiency .
our results clearly point to the importance of ngly1 in mammals and show that the inhibition of engase represents an effective therapy for treating an ngly1 - deficiency .
most importantly , the mice described herein could serve as valuable viable model mice for studies related to the pathophysiology of an ngly1 - deficiency .

introduction the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) is the organelle responsible for the biosynthesis of proteins that pass through the secretory pathway .
this organelle has an efficient protein quality control or homeostasis system , in which abnormal or excess proteins are targeted for destruction [ 1 - 3 ] .
in such systems , cytoplasmic proteasomes play a major role in degrading proteins , and the degradation system is often referred to as er - associated degradation , or erad in short .
ngly1 is a highly conserved deglycosylating enzyme that is involved in the erad process [ 4 - 6 ] .
ngly1 cleaves n - glycans from misfolded glycoproteins during the erad process , and is thought to play an important role in the efficient degradation of misfolded glycoproteins [ 7 - 11 ] .
n - glycans released by ngly1 are known to be processed by cytoplasmic glycosidases such as engase and the alpha - mannosidase , man2c1 ( fig 1a , upper scheme ) [ 12 - 14 ] .
cytoplasmic engase is another deglycosylating enzyme that acts directly on n - glycans that are attached to glycoproteins but leaves a single n - acetylglucosamine ( glcnac ) residue attached to the protein ( fig 1a , lower scheme ) .
this enzyme belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase ( gh ) family 85 , and while conserved widely in eukaryotes , some yeast , including s. cerevisiae and s. pombe , do not produce this enzyme .

allow indicates ngly1 and asterisks indicate non - specific bands .
several studies dealing with the biological functions of ngly1 and / or engase have been reported .
mutants of ngly1 and its orthologues have been analyzed in various organisms [ 7 , 15 - 19 ] .
interestingly , the phenotypic consequences were found to be quite distinct between species ; for example , budding yeast show no significant viability / growth defects [ 7 ] , while mutant flies exhibited severe growth delay / arrest [ 15 ] .
the molecular details behind the phenotypes , however , remain poorly understood .
as of this writing , mutants of engase have been analyzed in a. thaliana [ 20 ] and c. elegans [ 21 ] but , in both cases , no significant phenotypes were observed .
in 2012 , the first patient harboring mutations in ngly1 alleles ( ngly1 - deficiency ) was identified through an exome analysis [ 22 ] and , since then , clinical cases involving humans have been reported [ 23 - 26 ] .
these patients show very severe systemic symptoms such as delayed global development , movement disorders , hypotonia and hypo / alacrima [ 24 , 26 ] .
these reports point to the biological significance of ngly1 in the normal development of mammals .
more recently , using a model erad substrate , we reported that the ablation of ngly1 causes a disruption in the erad process in mouse embryonic fibroblast ( mef ) cells [ 27 ] .
interestingly , this erad disruption was found to be caused by an unexpected deglycosylating activity of engase , and the direct action of this enzyme towards the model substrate was shown to result in the formation of aggregation - prone n - glcnac proteins [ 27 ] .
moreover , the disruption of erad in ngly1 - deficient cells was restored by the additional deletion of the engase gene .
while this result using a model substrate suggests that an engase inhibitor could be a potential therapeutic target for treating an ngly1 - deficiency , the issue of how engase - deletion affects mice phenotypes lacking ngly1 remains unknown .
results ngly1 - / - mice in c57bl / 6 are embryonically lethal the goal of this study was to clarify the details of the biological function of the deglycosylating enzymes , ngly1 and engase , at the individual level in mice .
to this end , we used mice ( c57bl / 6 background mice ) that had been generated in a previous study , in which the ngly1 and engase genes had been knocked out [ 27 ] .
the knockout constructs of ngly1 and engase are shown in fig 1b and 1c , respectively .
while the generation of these ko mice has been described previously [ 27 ] , a detailed phenotypic analysis of those mice has not been reported .
the targeted genomic disruption of ngly1 and engase was confirmed by pcr using 8 sets of primers ( fig 1b and 1c ; s1 table for primer sequences ) .
the loss of ngly1 activity was confirmed by an activity assay [ 27 ] .
we further examined the expression of the ngly1 protein by western blot analysis using cytoplasmic fractions from mef cells .
as shown in fig 1d , the loss of ngly1 in mef cells from ngly1 - / - mice was confirmed .
in the case of engase , we confirmed the loss of the engase activity through an activity assay in a previous study [ 27 ] as well as by conducting a detailed structural analysis of the free oligosaccharides ( foss ) in the cytoplasm of mef cells [ 28 ] .
the ngly1 heterozygous ( ngly1 - /+) mice were fertile and did not show any obviously recognizable phenotypes .
however , viable homozygous ngly1 - / - pups were not produced , despite the repeated crossing of the ngly1 - /+ mice ( table 1 ) , suggesting that the deletion of the ngly1 allele results in a lethal condition in c57bl / 6 mice .
to delineate the timing of the lethality , ngly1 - /+ mice were crossed and embryos were collected at several stages of gestation .
the viability of collected embryos was confirmed by checking their heart beat and their genotypes were analyzed using genomic dna extracted from the amnion .
the results of this genotyping are summarized in table 1 .
the ngly1 - / - embryos were viable , even at embryonic day 18.5 ( e18.5 ) , one day prior to birth .
at the same time , however , about 30 % of ngly1 - / - embryos were inviable at later stages of development ( e17.5 - 18.5 ) .
when embryos were collected early in the morning of the day of birth , only the ngly1 - /+ and ngly1 +/+ embryos were alive when we revived them by gentle massaging , but no ngly1 - / - mice could be revived .
we also analyzed the genotype of pups within a few hours after their birth ( p0 ) and confirmed the absence of ngly1 - / - pups ( table 1 ) .
at e14.5 and e16.5 , however , only viable ngly1 - / - embryos were observed .
therefore , the lethality caused by the ngly1 deficiency appears to occur between e16.5 and before birth .

a ventricular septal defect is observed in ngly1 - / - embryos to investigate the defects in ngly1 - / - embryos in more detail , x - ray micro - computed tomography ( mu - ct ) analyses were carried out on ngly1 - / - or ngly1 +/+ embryos at e16.5 ( fig 2a and 2b ) .
as shown in fig 2b , the ngly1 - / - embryos showed a ventricular septal defect ( vsd ) ( 5 out of 5 embryos ( 5 / 5 )) .
histological analyses also confirmed the occurrence of a vsd in ngly1 - / - embryos ( 3 / 3 ) ( fig 2c and 2d ) .
vsd is one of the most frequently - observed cardiovascular phenotypes in embryonic / perinatal lethal mice [ 29 ] .
we also found that some ngly1 - / - embryos showed anemia ( 12 / 28 [ 42.86 %] , fig 2e , left panel ) or edema ( 4 / 28 [ 14.29 %] , fig 2f , left panel ) , which were not observed in ngly1 +/+ embryos ( 0 / 44 , fig 2e and 2f , right panel ) .

the additional deletion of the engase gene partially rescues the lethality caused by the loss of ngly1 in sharp contrast to the case of ngly1 - / - mice , the engase - / - mice showed normal behavior / values in several tests as follows : behavior test ( open field ) , morphology / behavioral / sensory test ( riken modified - shirpa ) , hematology / clinical chemistry test ( hematology , urinalysis , clinical blood chemistry ) , pathology test ( body weight ) , cardiovascular test ( blood pressure , electrocardiogram ) and neurology / psychiatry test ( light / dark transition , home - cage activity , tail suspension , hot plate , tail flick ) ( the number of tested mice are described in materials and methods ) .
according to our previous cell - based study using an erad model substrate [ 27 ] , we hypothesized that engase could have the ability to function as a deglycosylating enzyme and that its deletion could rescue the defects caused by the lack of ngly1 .
in this study , we attempted to verify the effect of the additional engase deletion of ngly1 - / - in mice at an individual level .
to this end , we crossed ngly1 - /+ ; engase - /+ or ngly1 - /+ ; engase - / - mice and found that surviving ngly1 - / - mice were produced upon the crossing ( table 2 ) .
upon further examination , all of the surviving mice were found to be ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - double - knockout mice , strongly indicating that the additional deletion of engase partially rescued the lethality caused by the defect of ngly1 at an individual level .

vsd appears to be one of the critical causes of lethality in ngly1 - / - mice we next investigated the issue of whether vsd was present in ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - embryos at e16.5 .
if vsd was to be critical for the lethality of ngly1 - / - embryos , then this phenotype should be suppressed by the additional deletion of engase .
as we expected , vsd was not observed in the ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - embryos , as evidenced by mu - ct ( 0 / 2 ) and histological analyses ( 0 / 2 ) ( fig 2g and 2h ) .
it is therefore possible that vsd is at least one of the critical phenotypes that cause the lethality of ngly1 - / - mice / embryos and the deletion of the engase gene , for unknown reasons , rescues this phenotype .
we also examined the gross morphology of embryos at e16.5 and found that some ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - embryos showed anemia ( 5 / 16 [ 31.25 %] , fig 2i , left panel ) while no ngly1 +/+ ; engase - / - embryo showed this phenotype ( 0 / 20 , fig 2i , right panel ) .
additionally , ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - embryos did not show edema ( 0 / 16 ) .
unexpectedly , there is no significant difference of the appearance ratio between ngly1 - / - embryos and ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - embryos at e16.5 ( table 1 ) .
these results suggest that engase deletion resulted in the rescue of not all but several phenotypes caused by ngly1 deletion such as vsd and edema .
these results also indicated that multiple pathways appear to be involved in the pathophysiology of ngly1 - / - mice .
ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice can survive but they still show several progressive defects similar to the symptoms of human subjects with an ngly1 - deficiency we next analyzed the phenotypes of the viable ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice in c57bl / 6 background .
when the mice were tested for viability , an apparent decrease in the viability of the ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice was observed after 45 weeks ( about 10 months ) , suggesting that they show age - related defects ( fig 3a ) .
we then attempted to characterize the major defects that were observed in ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice .
when they were young ( about 4 ~ 5 weeks of age ) , the differences between the ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice and their littermates were negligible .
however , when they became older ( about 6 ~ 7 months of age ) , the ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice showed several defects / abnormal behavior , such as bent spines ( fig 3b , upper panel , 15 / 15 ) , trembling ( s1 and s2 movies , 15 / 15 ) , hind - limb clasping ( fig 3c , s3 movie , 15 / 15 ) , and front - limb shaking ( s3 movie , 15 / 15 ) .
moreover , the ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice showed a significant reduction in body weight compared to their littermates ( fig 3d and 3e ) .
we currently have no explanation for why only male ngly1 - /+ ; engase - / - mice show a slow weight gain relative to ngly1 +/+ ; engase - / - mice , but it may , in part , be due to the fact that male mice are larger than female mice and therefore make a change in weight gain could be detected more easily .
we observed no other haploinsufficient effects in male / female ngly1 - /+ ; engase - / - mice .

for statistical analysis , student 's t - test was used .

( g ) female ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice developed eye opacity ( n = 8 ) .
shown are representative appearances .
ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice also had coarse fur ( 12 / 15 [ 80 %]) which may be due to either intrinsic skin problems or , alternatively , impaired grooming behavior ( fig 3f ) .
female ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice exhibited eye opacity much more frequently than their littermates after 20 ~ 30 weeks of age ( 8 / 10 [ 80 %] , fig 3g ) .
those results clearly indicate that , while the deletion of the engase gene results in suppressing the critical phenotypes , including the vsd caused by deletion of the ngly1 gene , not all of the defects were fully rescued .
a change in the genetic background of c57bl / 6 mice can partially rescue the embryonic lethality caused by the loss of ngly1 it was previously shown that a change in the genetic background of fut8 - / - mice from an inbred c57bl / 6 strain to an outbred icr strain , that maintain a certain genetic variation within the colonies , postnatal lethality was rescued [ 30 ] .
it is also noteworthy that , when we examined the symptoms of ngly1 - deficiency patients , there were a wide spectrum of symptoms and a genotype - phenotype correlation was not so obvious [ 23 - 25 ] .
these results imply that the genetic background may influence the severity of the phenotypes caused by the defects of ngly1. with that in mind , we crossed ngly1 - /+ mice in a c57bl / 6 background with icr mice .
among the f1 mice that were produced , the ngly1 - /+ mice were further crossed to produce f2 mice .
as shown in table 3 , we found that viable f2 ngly1 - / - mice were obtained from these crosses .
the phenotypes of the ngly1 - / - mice in the c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background were found to be much more severe compared with the ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice in the c57bl / 6 background , and about 70 % of them died within 3 weeks ( fig 4a ) .
the ngly1 - / - mice in the c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background also showed a significant reduction in body weight ( fig 4b and 4c ) and hind - limb clasping ( fig 4d , 9 / 9 ) , which were also observed in aged ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice in the c57bl / 6 background ( fig 3c - 3e ) .
it should be noted that the deletion of the engase gene resulted in a slight reduction in the body weight in mice of the c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background ( ex. compare fig 3b , 3c , 3d and 3e for ngly1 - /+ mice ) .
this observation suggests that the loss of the engase gene affects weight gain in mice .
we suspect , however , that this fluctuation in the data could be simply due to the diverse genetic background of the mice that were analyzed , especially since icr mice are , in general , much larger than c57bl / 6 mice .
consistent with this assumption , pathological tests at the japan mice clinic showed that the average weight of 26 - week old engase - / - mice ( average 26.64 / 26.61 g for male / female mice ( n = 5 )) was not affected when compared with that of wild - type mice ( 26.79 / 26.64 g for male / female mice ( n = 1 )) with the c57bl / 6 background .
however , we currently cannot exclude the possibility that the loss of the engase gene may become problematic when ngly1 levels are compromised .

in the case of the ngly1 - / - mice in the c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background , however , they began to show these abnormalities when they were still young ( 4 weeks old ) .
therefore , the phenotype of the ngly1 - / - mice in the c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background turned out to be much more severe than that of ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice in the c57bl / 6 background , even when they partially evaded embryonic lethality .
these results also indicate the suppressive effects of the deletion of engase for phenotypes of ngly1 - / - mice , since mice with the c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background are generally thought to be more tolerant to genetic mutations when compared with the inbred c57bl / 6 background .
to determine if the partial suppression of lethality in the icr and c57bl / 6 mixed background may have been caused by the low engase activity in icr mice , we carried out engase enzyme assays using pa - labeled sugar derivatives on liver tissue obtained from icr and c57bl / 6 mice .
the findings indicated that the samples from the icr and c57bl / 6 mice had equivalent engase activity ( 0.39 +/ - 0.11 pmol / min / mg protein for c57bl / 6 and 0.42 +/ - 0.07pmol / min / mg protein for icr ) , and no engase activity was detected in the liver of engase - / - mouse .
these results indicate that the rescue of the lethality of ngly1 - / - mice resulting from a change in their genetic background does not appear to be correlated with engase activity .
the deletion of engase can partially alleviate the defects caused by ngly1 deletion in viable ngly1 - / - mice to test the effect of engase deletion in the viable ngly1 - / - mice , we next generated ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice in the c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background .
as shown in table 3 , we were able to obtain ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice in the f3 mice by crossing the f2 ngly1 - /+ ; engase - / - mice in the c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background .
all of the f3 ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice were alive at 30 weeks ( n = 9 ) , in sharp contrast to the case with the f2 ngly1 - / - mice in the c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background , where none of them had survived at 30 weeks ( n = 29 ) ( fig 4a ) .
moreover , the ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice showed an attenuated body weight reduction compared to the ngly1 - / - mice in the c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background ( fig 4e and 4f ) .
these results clearly indicate that the disruption of engase can alleviate , at least partially , the defects caused by ngly1 deletion in the viable mice ( e.g. reduction of % survival and body weight ) .
the phenotypes of the ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice from this cross were found to be even more mild than the ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice in the c57bl / 6 background , in that they did not show any overt defects , other than hind - limb clasping ( 9 / 9 ) , suggesting that the deletion of the engase gene and mixing with icr - background have an additive effect in suppressing the defect of the ngly1 - / - mice .
identification of n - glycoproteins accumulated in the cytoplasm of ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - and wild - type mef cells regarding the potential mechanism for how engase can rescue the defects due to the loss of ngly1 , we previously proposed an " n - glcnac hypothesis " [ 27 ] .
in this proposed process , engase acts on cytoplasmic misfolded glycoproteins in a stochastic fashion , especially when ngly1 activity is compromised .
as a result , n - glcnac modified proteins ( proteins that are modified with one glcnac unit ) would be generated in the cytoplasm .
the formation of the excessive levels of n - glcnac proteins could somehow lead to detrimental effects ( fig 5a ) .
we also previously showed that there appears to be higher levels of cytoplasmic n - glycoproteins in ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mef cells compared with wild - type mef cells , as judged by lectin blot experiments [ 27 ] .
such cytoplasmic n - glycoproteins may serve as precursors for endogenous n - glcnac proteins , some of which may be linked to the pathogenesis of an ngly1 - deficiency , in ngly1 - / - cells .

( a ) schematic representation of an n - glcnac hypothesis and therapeutic treatment of ngly1 - deficiency based on engase inhibition .
in the absence of ngly1 , engase acts on some portions of unfolded glycoproteins to form n - glcnac proteins .
the presence of an excess of n - glcnac proteins somehow results in detrimental effects on cells / mice .
( b ) relative peak area intensity (%) of glycopeptides observed in ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mef cells .
the peak area of each glycopeptide in wild - type mef cells was identified as 100 % and the relative ratio of the glycopeptide peak area in ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mef cells were calculated .
shown are the average values for two samples that were independently prepared .
to identify specific n - glycoproteins that accumulate in ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mef cells , a glycoproteomics analysis was carried out on the cytoplasm of ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mef cells .
to minimize contamination from the membrane fraction , we utilized a mild digitonin - treatment to recover the cytoplasmic fraction [ 31 ] .
the cytoplasmic fractions thus prepared were subjected to a glycoproteomics analysis .
after trypsinization , the n - glycopeptides were concentrated by acetone precipitation [ 32 ] , and the n - glycans were released by pngase f digestion , followed by the detection of deglycosylated peptide in which n - glycosylated asparagines are converted into aspartic acids .
among the 79 potential n - glycopeptides that were detected ( s2 and s3 tables ) , 13 n - glycopeptides were detected as deamidated peptides , even in the absence of pngase f - treatment ( s3 table ) , indicating that those 13 glycopeptides are formed by deamidation of the asparagine residues in a non - enzymatic fashion .
the presence of n - glycans on the remaining 66 peptides ( s2 table ) was further confirmed by the detection of signals for n - glcnac peptide ions on lc / ms / ms analysis of pngase f - untreated sample [ 32 ]. through this analysis , 18 n - glycopeptides derived from 12 glycoproteins were unequivocally identified in the ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - cytoplasm ( table 4 , s1 fig for product ion spectra ) .
a comparison of the ms peak areas of these glycopeptides between ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - and wild - type revealed that larger signals were detected for several n - glycopeptides in the ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - cytoplasm samples ( table 4 , fig 5b ) , while our analysis is by no means quantitative and the difference in the amount of n - glycoproteins in the two different cells may also be due to the differential recovery of the n - glycoproteins during the concentration of the n - glycoproteins .
nevertheless , our data clearly indicates that , indeed , the cytoplasm did contain n - glycoproteins , which may become potential substrates for ngly1 / engase in the cytoplasm and therefore can serve as precursors for n - glcnac proteins .

discussion in this study , the functional significance of the ngly1 gene in mice were characterized .
the results are consistent with the recent reports on ngly1 - deficient human subjects bearing mutations in the ngly1 allele [ 22 - 26 ] .
surprisingly , the lethality of the ngly1 - / - mice was partially suppressed by the additional knockout of the engase gene .
this result is consistent with findings reported in an earlier study [ 27 ] , which showed that the disruption of erad in ngly1 - ko cells was restored by the additional deletion of engase , at an individual level. through analyses of various mutants for ngly1 gene orthologues , an enzyme - independent function of the ngly1 - orthologue was proposed for some organisms [ 15 , 18 , 33 ] .
the results reported herein clearly suggest , however , that the embryonic lethal phenotype of ngly1 - / - mice is mainly related to its deglycosylation - dependent function , given the fact that the lethality was partially suppressed by the additional deletion of engase , a gene encoding another cytoplasmic deglycosylating enzyme .
regarding the ventricular septum defect observed for ngly1 - / - embryos , it should be noted that no significant heart problems have been reported for human patients [ 22 - 26 ] , suggesting that the functional importance of ngly1 for the heart may be limited to its embryonic developmental stage .
in this connection , it is also noteworthy that one of the patients was diagnosed as " small drop out in interventricular septum " by a fetal echo analysis ( personal communication from mr. andreas thermann ) .
while the lethality of the ngly1 - / - mice was partially rescued by the additional deletion of engase or by changing the genetic background , recognizable phenotypes were still observed in the ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice , as well as the ngly1 - / - mice in the c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background .
it should be noted here that most of the phenotypes observed for those mice are reminiscent of the symptoms observed for an ngly1 - deficiency in human subjects ( s4 table ) .
since the ngly1 - / - mice are embryonic lethal in the c57bl / 6 background , the ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice as well as the ngly1 - / - mice in the c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background could serve as viable model animals for studying the functions of ngly1 , which could be of great value , especially for evaluating the efficacy of potential drugs for the treatment of ngly1 - deficiency subjects in the future. with respect to the potential mechanism responsible for the detrimental effect of engase in ngly1 - / - mice , we previously proposed an n - glcnac hypothesis as described above [ 27 ] .
such n - glcnac proteins were recently reported to be present in murine synaptosome proteins [ 34 ] .
in addition , in plants , at least one of the n - glcnac proteins was shown to be generated by the action of the cytoplasmic engase [ 35 ] .
there was also a report suggesting that the proximal n - glcnac on n - glycosylation sites has a critical role in stabilizing carrier proteins [ 36 ] .
we therefore hypothesize that engase might cleave glycans on misfolded glycoproteins in the cytoplasm to generate n - glcnac proteins , and that the presence of an excess of these n - glcnac proteins somehow contributes to the detrimental effects in mice , such as n - glcnac proteins forming aggregates , or impairment of cytoplasmic o - glcnac signaling ( n - glcnac hypothesis ) ( fig 5a ) .
indeed , we found that a model erad substrate was converted into an n - glcnac - modified protein in ngly1 - / - mef cells [ 27 ] .
in this connection , it should be noted that a galnac - galnac ( galnac : n - acetylgalactosamine ) interaction was recently reported to occur in the binding of mucins with tn ( galnac alpha1 - ser / thr ) or sialyl tn cancer antigens [ 37 ] .
it would be interesting to see if similar interactions , at least in part , contribute to the aggregation of n - glcnac proteins .
on the other hand , we have not been able to detect ngly1 - deficient specific change in the o - glcnac modification among mef cells by western blotting ( s2 fig ) .
however , the possibility that changes in specific o - glcnac proteins had occurred cannot be excluded .
clearly , a more comprehensive analysis will be required .
moreover , ngly1 - deficient specific protein aggregation was not observed by histological analyses ( e.g. congo red staining , pas staining ) of tissue sections from mice embryos .
further studies will be needed to verify our n - glcnac hypothesis and efforts are currently underway to identify endogenous n - glcnac proteins in mef cells derived from various genotypes ( wild - type , ngly1 - / - , engase - / - and ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - ) .
it should be noted that ngly1 - ko does not lead to a general erad - defect [ 8 , 9 , 38 ] .
these observations strongly indicate that the pathogenesis of ngly1 - / - mice cannot be attributed to general er stress , but rather specific substrates likely appear to be involved .
we previously reported that larger amounts of n - glycoproteins appeared to be accumulated in the cytoplasm of ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mef cells compared with those of wild - type , ngly1 - / - or engase - / - mef cells [ 27 ] .
to extend our analysis , in this study we identified several n - glycoproteins that had accumulated in the cytoplasm of ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - cells .
such glycoproteins can serve as precursors for endogenous n - glcnac proteins that are potentially formed in ngly1 - / - cells .
while we used sequential detergent extraction for the cytoplasmic fraction to minimize contamination of other organelles , traces of lysosomal components could still be detected in the cytoplasmic fraction ( s3 fig ) .
it is therefore possible that some glycoproteins of lysosomal origin may be present due to contamination by lysosomes in the cytoplasmic fraction .
in any event , the phenotypes observed for ngly1 - / - and ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice were found to be very analogous to the symptoms observed in patients with an ngly1 - deficiency ( s4 table ) , which make those mice valuable animal models for this genetic disorder .
it should also be noted that the degree of suppression by egnase - deletion are distinct among phenotypes ( ex fig 2 ) .
these observations clearly suggest that multiple pathways , i.e. engase - dependent and - independent pathways , are involved in the pathogenesis of ngly1 - ko mice or ngly1 - deficiency subjects .
since many of the ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice in both the c57bl / 6 background and the c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background survive for more than 1 year after birth ( one lived for more than 2 years ) , this either suggests that ( 1 ) once they escape the developmental defect during embryogenesis , the ngly1 - / - mice could have a relatively normal life span or ( 2 ) the effect of suppression by engase - deletion is quite effective for adult mice .
however , the ngly1 - / - mice in the c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background showed quite severe phenotypes , favoring the latter possibility .
moreover , the additional deletion of engase in the c57bl / 6 and icr background also resulted in a significant improvement of the phenotypes (% survival , body weight gain ) , further supporting the conclusion that a defect in the engase - gene has strong positive effects for viable mice .
in this connection , it should be noted that , while the birth rate of ngly1 - / - ; engase - / - mice from ngly1 - /+ ; engase - / - cross was found to be better in the c57bl / 6 and icr mixed background ( 12.33 %) than the c57bl / 6 homogeneous background ( 8.98 %) ( tables 2 and 3 ) , it was still significantly lower than the expected rate ( 25 %) .
these results clearly suggest that the deletion of engase is not sufficient to fully suppress the ngly1 defect during embryogenesis .
further studies will be required to understand the molecular details on the functional importance of ngly1 in embryogenesis .
given the dramatic rescue of the mice phenotypes by the additional engase deletion , one could easily envision that an in vivo inhibitor of cytoplasmic engase would be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of an ngly1 - deficiency in humans ( fig 5a ) .
it has previously been shown that the thiazoline modified oligosaccharide functions as an effective inhibitor for the cytoplasmic engase [ 39 ] , and it may be possible to design cell permeable inhibitors for engase derived from this compound .

all of the identified peptides were then filtered at a false discovery rate ( fdr ) threshold of 1 % .
the amino acid sequences of glycopeptides were identified by matching between the product ion of peptide carrying a single n - acetylglucosamine residue and the identified deglycosylated peptide .
western blotting cytoplasmic fractions of mef cells derived from ngly1 - / - , or wild type mice were separated by sodium dodecylsulfate ( sds ) - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( page ) and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride ( pvdf ) membrane .
the membrane was blocked for 1 h with 4 ( w / v )% skim milk in pbs and incubated with anti - mouse ngly1 antibody in pbs supplemented with 0.05 % ( wt / vol ) tween20 ( pbst ) ( 1:3000 ) at 4degreesc for 16 h , followed by hrp goat anti - rabbit igg ( 1:3000 , ge healthcare ) in pbst at room temperature for 2 h. the membranes were monitored by an immobilon western chemiluminescent hrp substrate ( millipore ) .
the chemiluminescence was visualized using a las - 3000 imager ( fujifilm ) .
preparation of cytoplasm from mice tissues livers obtained from 7 - week - old female mice of icr background ( n = 3 ) , and c57bl / 6 background ( n = 3 ) , as well as a 16 - week - old female c57bl / 6 mouse of engase - / - ( n = 1 ) were suspended in 2 volumes of cytoplasm extraction buffer containing 10 mm hepes - naoh ( ph7.4 ) , 250 mm sucrose , 1 mm dtt , 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( edta ) , 1xcomplete protease inhibitior cocktail ( edta - free ; roche ) and 1 mm pefabloc ( roche ) , and homogenized on ice using a potter - elvehjem homogenizer .
the homogenate was centrifuged twice at 10,000xg for 5 min at 4degreesc to remove debris , and then further centrifuged at 100,000xg for 60 min at 4degreesc .
the supernatant was collected , not including the floating lipid layer , as the cytosolic extract for the engase activity assay .
the amount of protein was determined using a bradford assay ( bio - rad protein assay , bio - rad ) with bovine serum albumin as the standard .
engase assay the engase activity assay reaction ( total 10 mul ) included 2 mul of cytosolic fraction in which the protein concentration was adjusted to 30 mg / ml ) , 4 pmol of man9glcnac2 - pa ( takara bio inc. ) in a final 50 mm of mes - naoh buffer ( ph6.0 ) , and the reaction was carried at 30degreesc for 1 hour .
the reaction was terminated by adding 100 mul 75 % ( vol / vol ) ethanol and the resulting solution was incubated on ice for 15 min .
after centrifugation at 15,000xg for 10 min at 4degreesc , the supernatant was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 40 mul of water , and was subjected to hplc analysis using a shodex nh2p - 50 4e column as described previously [ 43 ] .

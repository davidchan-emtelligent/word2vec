introduction juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with arthritis of unknown etiology that begins before the age of 16 and persists for longer than 6 weeks .
the frequency of recurrence after arthroscopic synovectomy in patients with oligoarthritis juvenile idiopathic arthritis was reported to be lower than that in patients with polyarthritis .
however , recurrence in cases of oligoarthritis after arthroscopic knee synovectomy was shown to be 67 % in one recent study and , furthermore , a shorter period free from recurrence was also reported after synovectomy .
here we report a child who suffered recurrent knee arthritis with a 10 - year asymptomatic period after arthroscopic synovectomy .
case presentation a 12 - year - old japanese girl presented with normal birth and developmental history .
at the age of 2 years she experienced joint swelling in both knees .
her symptoms continued and arthroscopic synovectomy was eventually performed .
during the operation , rice bodies and thickening of the synovial membrane were observed ; however , no definitive diagnosis was made .
after a 10 - year asymptomatic period , knee joint swelling recurred on one side without any cause .
arthroscopic synovectomy was beneficial in reducing the symptoms and in diagnosis .
conclusions children who suffer prolonged joint swelling have a risk of juvenile idiopathic arthritis .
even if the symptoms heal and no definite diagnosis is made at the first treatment , informed consent is needed to make the patients understand the future risk of recurrent arthritis after even lengthy asymptomatic periods .
introduction juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( jia ) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with arthritis of unknown etiology that begins before the age of 16 and persists for longer than 6 weeks [ 1 ] .
jia has several disease categories and pathologies .
these categories include systemic , polyarthritis , and oligoarthritis [ 2 ] .
the frequency of recurrence after arthroscopic synovectomy in patients with oligoarthritis was reported to be lower than that in patients with polyarthritis [ 3 ] .
however , recurrence in cases of oligoarthritis after arthroscopic knee synovectomy was shown to be 67 % in one recent study [ 4 ] .
furthermore , a shorter period free from recurrence was also reported after synovectomy [ 4 ] .
the diagnosis of jia is essentially a clinical one .
without specific clinical and laboratory findings , the differential diagnosis of jia is extensive and diagnosis can be difficult .
here we report the case of a child who suffered recurrent knee arthritis with a 10 - year asymptomatic period after arthroscopic synovectomy .
case presentation a 12 - year - old japanese girl presented with normal birth and developmental history .
there was no notable family or medical past history .
at 2 years old , she experienced swelling of both knee joints without any cause .
there was no rest pain in either knee ; however , pain on motion in the right knee and joint effusion in both knees were noted at the first examination .
full extension was observed for the right knee but flexion was limited to 130degrees .
the left knee had a normal range of movement .
aspiration of clear yellow joint fluid showed a negative culture result .
laboratory findings showed a white blood cell ( wbc ) count of 10,700 / mul , c - reactive protein ( crp ) of 0.45mg / dl , and erythrocyte sedimentation reaction ( esr ) of 21mm / hour .
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) revealed small masses in her knee joints ( figure 1 ) .
her symptoms were not improved after several joint aspirations .
arthroscopic synovectomy was eventually performed for both knees .
during the operation , rice bodies and thickening of the synovial membrane were observed ( figure 2 ) .
the pathological findings for the rice bodies showed acidophilic tissues with lymphoid infiltration ( figure 3 ) ; however , no definite diagnosis was made .
after the operation , the pain and swelling in the knees were improved .
a 10 - year asymptomatic period after arthroscopic synovectomy precluded the need for annual medical examinations .
figure 1 magnetic resonance imaging ( t2 - weighted ) at 2 years showed a small mass in her knee joint ( arrows ) .
figure 2 arthroscopic findings at 2 years showed rice bodies and thickening of the synovial membrane .
removal of the rice bodies and synovectomy was performed for both knees .
figure 3 pathological findings of the rice bodies revealed acidophilic tissues with lymphoid infiltration .
when she was 12 years old , her left knee again showed swelling without any cause .
several joint aspirations and intra - articular injection of steroids failed to improve her symptoms .
she did not experience any pain in her left knee .
full extension was observed for her knee but flexion was limited to 130degrees .
laboratory findings revealed a wbc count of 4,300 / mul , crp of 0.10mg / dl , esr of 12mm / hour , rheumatoid factor ( rf ) of < 5iu / ml , matrix metalloproteinase - 3 of 95.1ng / ml , and an antinuclear antibody ( ana ) test was 1:80 positive .
contrast - enhanced mri showed joint effusion and thickening of the synovial membrane ( figure 4 ) .
an arthroscopic synovectomy was performed for her left knee ( figure 5 ) , and pathological findings revealed the presence of a villiform structure , increased blood vessels , chronic inflammatory cells , and lymphocyte infiltration ( figure 6 ) .
she had no uveitis , but was diagnosed with jia and received methotrexate ( mtx ) medication .
since that time there has been no recurrent knee arthritis .
figure 4 contrast - enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( fat suppression t1 - weighted ) at 12 years showed joint effusion and thickening of the synovial membrane .
figure 5 arthroscopic findings during synovectomy at 12 years .
a : anterior cruciate ligament and the engorged synovial membranes .
b : the synovial membranes in the suprapatellar pouch .
figure 6 pathological findings at 12 years revealed the presence of a villiform structure , increased blood vessels , chronic inflammatory cells , and lymphocyte infiltration .
discussion jia is classified into three broad categories : systemic , polyarthritis , and oligoarthritis [ 2 ] .
oligoarthritis is prevalent in females , with negative rf and positive ana results being pathognomonic [ 5 ] .
oligoarthritis has a relatively good prognosis compared with the other categories .
our patient was diagnosed with oligoarticular jia when she was 12 years old ; however , no definitive diagnosis was made when her symptoms first appeared at 2 years old .
the diagnosis of jia is made based on the child 's symptoms and the results of physical and blood examinations .
it is recognized that a definite diagnosis is difficult as there is no single , definitive laboratory test for jia .
joint effusion and numerous rice bodies were observed in the knees of our patient during her first operation .
rice body formation is not a frequently observed pathology and diseases accompanied by rice body formation in the affected joints include soft tissue tumors , such as synovial chondromatosis , or chronic arthritis ( septic , tuberculous , or systemic ) .
the existence of rice bodies is not considered to be typical of jia .
however , we think from our experience that jia should be taken into consideration during differential diagnosis when rice bodies are identified [ 6,7 ] .
we performed arthroscopic synovectomy for diagnosis at 2 years of age .
since the pathological findings for the rice bodies showed acidophilic tissues and no definite diagnosis was made , biopsy at 2 years of age might not have been helpful for the diagnosis of jia .
however , soft tissue tumors and tuberculous arthritis could be ruled out .
the general approach to treating jia includes nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs and multiple intra - articular injection of steroids as first - line therapy , and the second option is mtx or a biological product .
if these are not sufficient , synovectomy might be an effective treatment option for mono - articular jia .
the surgical treatment for jia remains controversial .
adamec et al. [ 8 ] reported that surgical treatment should be evaluated in cooperation with a rheumatologist after administration of an appropriate conservative therapy for at least 6 months .
dell'era et al. [ 4 ] reported the outcomes of 31 knee synovectomies ( six cases of oligoarthritis , 20 of polyarthritis , and five of psoriatic arthritis ) in 19 children with jia .
the best results were observed in the group with oligoarthritis .
they concluded that the aim of arthroscopic synovectomy was to enhance nonsurgical therapy .
in our patient , no definite diagnosis was made before the second operation , although knee swelling was prolonged and repeated knee aspiration was required .
arthroscopic knee synovectomy was helpful in reducing her symptoms and in making a diagnosis of atypical recurrent jia , which leaded to treatment with the appropriate medication .
typically , surgical intervention is not recommended until erosions are radiologically manifested .
however , we think that arthroscopic synovectomy is one of the options of treatment and prevention of bone erosions for jia .
toledo et al. [ 9 ] described the following : that arthroscopy made it possible to remove synovial tissue mechanically during the subacute phase of mono - articular jia , might prevent pannus formation , and may lead to complete remission of arthritis .
medication for jia also remains controversial .
she received mtx medication due to recurrence of knee arthritis .
there has been no recurrent knee arthritis , and no side effects .
the recurrence of symptoms , even in oligoarthritis , is not uncommon , with the relapse rate after synovectomy reported to be 36 to 67 % [ 4,9 ] .
in addition , the mean period free from recurrence was only 1.69 years [ 4 ] .
thus , surgical treatment alone may not be sufficient for the treatment of jia .
this patient was diagnosed as oligoarticular jia and was treated with arthroscopic synovectomy of both knees at the age of 2 years .
after a 10 - year asymptomatic period , arthritis recurred in one knee without any cause .
children who suffer prolonged joint swelling are at risk of jia .
even if the symptoms heal and no definite diagnosis is made at the first treatment , informed consent is needed to make the patients understand the future risk of recurrent arthritis after even lengthy asymptomatic periods .
conclusions we reported a child who suffered recurrent knee arthritis with a 10 - year asymptomatic period after arthroscopic synovectomy .
informed consent is needed to make the patients understand the future risk of recurrent arthritis of jia after even lengthy asymptomatic periods .

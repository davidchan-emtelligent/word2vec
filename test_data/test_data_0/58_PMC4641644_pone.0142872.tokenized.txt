introduction hantavirus infections are characterized by both activation and dysfunction of the endothelial cells .
the underlying mechanisms of the disease pathogenesis are not fully understood .
here we tested the hypothesis whether the polymorphisms of endothelial nitric oxide synthase , enos g894t , and inducible nitric oxide synthase , inos g2087a , are associated with the severity of acute puumala hantavirus ( puuv ) infection .
patients and methods hospitalized patients ( n = 172 ) with serologically verified puuv infection were examined .
clinical and laboratory variables reflecting disease severity were determined .
the polymorphisms of enos g894t ( glu298asp , rs1799983 ) and inos g2087a ( ser608leu , rs2297518 ) were genotyped .
results the rare enos g894t genotype was associated with the severity of acute kidney injury ( aki ) .
the non - carriers of g - allele ( tt - homozygotes ) had higher maximum level of serum creatinine than the carriers of g - allele ( gt - heterozygotes and gg - homozygotes ; median 326 , range 102 - 1041 vs. median 175 , range 51 - 1499 mumol / l ; p = 0.018 , respectively ) .
the length of hospital stay was longer in the non - carriers of g - allele than in g - allele carriers ( median 8 , range 3 - 14 vs. median 6 , range 2 - 15 days ; p = 0.032 ) .
the rare a - allele carriers ( i.e. aa - homozygotes and ga - heterozygotes ) of inos g2087a had lower minimum systolic and diastolic blood pressure than the non - carriers of a - allele ( median 110 , range 74 - 170 vs.116 , range 86 - 162 mmhg , p = 0.019 , and median 68 , range 40 - 90 vs. 72 , range 48 - 100 mmhg ; p = 0.003 , respectively ) .
conclusions patients with the tt - homozygous genotype of enos g894t had more severe puuv - induced aki than the other genotypes .
the enos g894t polymorphism may play role in the endothelial dysfunction observed during acute puuv infection .

introduction hantaviruses cause two clinical syndromes in humans , the haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome ( hfrs ) in europe and asia , and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome ( hcps ) in the americas .
puumala hantavirus ( puuv ) is the most common hantavirus causing hfrs in europe [ 1 ] .
the main characteristics of puuv - hfrs are increased capillary leakage , thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury ( aki ) .
although puuv - hfrs has a low rate of case fatality ( up to 0.4 %) , significant acute - phase complications as well as long - term hormonal , renal and cardiovascular consequences can occur [ 1 , 2 ] .
the main pathophysiological mechanisms of hantavirus infection include activation of cytokines [ 3 , 4 ] and cytotoxic cd8 + t - lymphocytes [ 5 ] , vascular endothelial growth factors [ 6 , 7 ] , and the complement system [ 8 ] .
recently discovered biomarkers that reflect puuv - hfrs disease severity include pentraxin - 3 , indoleamine 2,3 - dioxygenase , plasma cell - free dna , soluble urokinase - type plasminogen activator and gata - 3 [ 9 ] .
host genetic factors also influence the outcome of acute puuv infection .
in the finnish population , individuals with human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) alleles b8 , c4a * q0 and drb1 * 0301 are more prone to have a severe form of puuv infection [ 10 , 11 ] .
also polymorphisms of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnf - alpha ) , interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) and il - 1 receptor antagonist impact on the clinical severity of puuv - hfrs [ 10 , 12 ] .
likewise , genetic polymorphisms of plasminogen activator inhibitor , the main physiological regulator of fibrinolysis , and platelet glycoprotein 1a , associate with severe puuv infection [ 13 ] .
increased nitric oxide ( no ) levels induced by elevated tnf - alpha concentrations have been suggested to participate in the pathogenesis of hantaviral infections [ 14 , 15 , 16 ] .
elevated concentrations of no correlate with increased serum creatinine value and hypotension , and inversely correlate with platelet count in patients with acute puuv infection [ 15 ] .
according to a swedish study , no has antiviral effects on hantaviruses by inhibiting viral replication at the early phase of infection [ 17 ] .
endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( enos ) , and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) that can be induced in a variety of cell types , are the key enzymes catalysing no synthesis [ 18 ] .
a widely explored polymorphism of the enos gene , the g894t ( rs1799983 ) polymorphism encoded by the nos3 gene in chromosome 7 , has been linked to increased risk of coronary artery disease ( cad ) , myocardial infarction , coronary spasms , hypertension , and ischemic stroke [ 19 - 24 ] .
recent data suggest that the t - allele of g894t polymorphism is also associated with increased susceptibility to and risk of end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) [ 25 ] , and also with earlier onset age of esrd in males with autosomal dominant polycystic disease [ 26 ] .
the inos , encoded by the nos2 gene in chromosome 17 , is expressed in macrophages , neutrophils and hepatocytes as a host immune response to cytokines .
the g2087a ( rs2927518 ) polymorphism of inos has been implicated in a variety of diseases , including inflammatory bowel disease , gastric cancer , migraine with aura , septic shock , and non - hodgkin lymphoma [ 27 - 30 ] .
so far there is no evidence whether the nos polymorphisms influence the clinical course of hantaviral infections .
we aimed to study the influence of the above polymorphisms that have the potential to affect endothelial and vascular function , enos g894t ( glu298asp , rs1799983 ) and inos g2087a ( ser608leu , rs2297518 ) , on disease severity in patients with acute puuv infection .
we sought to determine whether the genetic variations within the genes of nos3 and nos2 could contribute to individual differences in the outcome of acute puuv infection .
material and methods ethics statement the study was carried out at tampere university hospital and university of tampere , school of medicine .
all patients were recruited and enrolled after providing a written informed consent .
in addition , informed verbal consent was obtained from the guardians of the minors .
blood samples of the minors were collected before the current medical reseach act was valid in finland .
the ethics committee of tampere university hospital approved the study protocol and consent procedure according to the ethical principles at the time of the study .
the study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the declaration of helsinki .
patients the study cohort consisted of 172 prospectively collected , consecutive hospitalized patients with serologically confirmed acute puuv infection .
the collection of clinical data including routine laboratory measurements has been described in detail elsewhere [ 13 ] .
all patients came from the pirkanmaa area and were hospitalized in tampere university hospital , finland for the median time of six days ( range 2 - 15 ) during the period from september 1997 to february 2009 .
the median age of the patients was 40 years ( ranging from 15 to 74 years ) , and 119 were males ( 69 %) .
the concomitant diseases of the study group were arterial hypertension ( n = 12 ) , dyslipidemia ( n = 7 ) , cad ( n = 5 ) , bronchial asthma ( n = 6 ) , atrial fibrillation ( n = 3 ) and rheumatoid arthritis ( n = 3 ) .
there were also patients with celiac disease , inflammatory bowel disease , valvular heart disease or neurological disease ( n = 2 for each ) .
definition of aki aki was defined according to kidney disease : improving global outcomes ( kdigo ) criteria as an increase in plasma creatinine >= 1.5 times baseline , which was presumed to have occurred within the prior seven days [ 31 ] .
the upper limits of the reference values for plasma creatinine ( women 90 mumol / l and men 100 mumol / l ) were taken as baseline levels .
thus , plasma creatinine >= 135 mumol / l in women , and >= 150 mumol / l in men was defined as aki .
genotyping dna was extracted from whole blood using a commercially available kit ( qiagen inc. , hilden , germany ) .
the gene polymorphisms of enos g894t ( glu298asp , rs1799983 ) and inos g2087a ( ser608leu , rs2297518 ) were genotyped with taqman ( r ) snp genotyping assay ( life technologies ltd , carlsbad , ca , usa ) under standard conditions using the abi prism 7900ht sequence detection system ( taqman , applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) .
reaction volume used was 5 mul and it was prepared with taqman genotyping mastermix ( life technologies ltd , carlsbad , ca , usa ) .
amplification data were analyzed with sds 2.2 software ( taqman , applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) .
the distributions of all snps did not deviate from the hardy - weinberg equation .
the genotyping was successful in 167 of 172 patients ( 97 %) for enos and in 166 patients ( 96.5 %) for inos .
statistical analysis the highest and lowest values of continuous variables measured during acute puuv infection were designated as maximum or minimum values .
in order to describe the data , medians and ranges were given for skewed continuous variables and numbers for categorical variables .
the allele frequencies were calculated , and the patients were grouped into carriers ( including both homozygotes and heterozygotes ) and non - carriers of specific alleles .
differences in the clinical severity of puuv infection between groups were tested using mann - whitney u - test or kruskal - wallis test for numerical data and chi2 - test or fisher ` s exact test for categorical data , as appropriate .
all p - values were two - tailed , and the statistical significance was considered at 0.05 .
statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss software version 21 .
results clinical and laboratory findings the clinical and laboratory findings of the 172 patients with acute puuv infection are shown in table 1 .
all patients suffered from serologically verified [ 32 ] and clinically typical puuv infection , and they were examined and hospitalized during the acute phase of illness .
three patients ( 2 %) were in clinical shock on admission to the hospital .
aki was found in 96 ( 56 %) patients .
seven patients ( 4 %) needed hemodialysis treatment during hospitalization .
all patients recovered .

the non - carriers of the g - allele had also higher maximum blood leukocyte count during acute phase of puuv infection than the carriers of the common g - allele ( gt - heterozygotes and gg - homozygotes , median 12.9 , range 8.1 - 26.8 vs. median 9.9 , range 3.9 - 31.2 * 109 / l ; p = 0.047 ; fig 1c ) .

discussion in this study we found that the tt - genotype of enos g894t polymorphism was associated with the severity of puuv infection .
puuv - infected patients with the tt - homozygous genotype were prone to more severe aki and longer hospital stay than the gt - heterozygotes or gg - homozygotes .
they had also higher maximum leukocyte count and hematocrit values measured in the acute phase of the infection when compared with the other genotypes .
the g894t polymorphism of enos gene was not associated with the depth of thrombocytopenia , which is in concordance with our previous finding that the severity of aki does not associate with thrombocytopenia in acute puuv infection in finnish patients [ 33 ] .
in some german studies severe thrombocytopenia has predicted severe aki in puuv infection [ 34 , 35 , 36 ] .
we do n't know the reason for these divergent results , but genetic factors in different populations may influence .
furthermore , we also found that the inos g2087a gene polymorphism was associated with decreased blood pressure .
the carriers of the rare a - allele of inos g2087a gene variant were the most susceptible ones to suffer from severe hypotension during the acute phase of infection .
however , this inos polymorphism was not associated with the other clinical and laboratory markers reflecting disease severity .
no is important in maintaining vascular homeostasis via relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells and inhibition of growth , platelet activation and aggregation , as well as leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium [ 37 ] .
no is synthesized via a calcium - dependent process in endothelial cells from the amino acid l - arginine by the constitutively expressed enos , i.e. nos3 [ 38 ] .
the calcium - independent formation of no via inos in macrophages is mainly expressed during inflammation and infection , and is triggered by cytokines [ 39 ] .
in addition to maintaining vasodilatation of the vasculature and thus controlling blood pressure , enos has numerous vasoprotective and anti - atherosclerotic effects [ 40 ] .
polymorphism of the nos3 gene , localized in 7q36 region of chromosome 7 [ 41 ] , seems to have functional significance .
the enos polymorphism g894t ( glu298asp ) results in a substitution of glutamate for aspartate at position 298 in enos exon 7 , and this change has been associated with reduced basal no production in the forearm of healthy subjects [ 42 ] .
increased capillary permeability and vascular leakage explain many clinical features of hantavirus infection , such as hemoconcentration , hypotension , shock and tissue edema .
hantaviruses target the endothelial cells in the small vasculature [ 1 , 9 ] .
the data so far does not suggest that the infection would have direct cellular cytotoxicity to the endothelium , but virus - induced inflammation and host immune responses may contribute to the loss of endothelial barrier function [ 7 , 43 ] .
in this study , the rare g894t tt - homozygous genotype was associated with many of the clinical markers of severe puuv infection , including hemoconcentration , leukocytosis , longer length of hospital stay , and especially the severity of aki .
as subjects with the common gg - genotype of enos g894t polymorphism had the mildest form of acute illness , the presence of this common g - allele might have some protective role during acute puuv infection .
effective renal blood flow is decreased in puuv - induced aki , but hypotension does not seem to explain the underlying intrarenal functional changes .
renal failure can occur without hypotension , and blood pressure levels do not correlate with the severity of aki [ 9 ] .
renal tubular cells and mesangial cells produce no , which is a significant regulator and also a protector of renal blood flow , glomerular filtration rate , and tubular function [ 44 ] .
interestingly , the increase in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow in response to exogenous l - arginine infusion has been found to be blunted in subjects with the g894t allele of endothelial nos , suggesting that this polymorphism is a functional variant also in human kidneys [ 45 ] .
thus , diminished no bioavailability due to enos g894t polymorphism could predispose to the impairment of vascular and renal function through vasoconstriction .
polymorphism of inos g2087a ( ser608leu ) leads to an amino acid substitution from serine to leucine in the coding region of exon 16 in nos2 [ 30 ] .
this gene variant is supposed to promote excessive no formation and inflammation through increased inos activity within the a - allele carriers .
in macrophages no is a mediator of tumoricidal and bactericidal actions [ 30 ] .
previous studies have indicated that inos plays an important role in the origin of hypotension in septic shock .
the a - allele carriage has been associated with increased susceptibility to septic shock [ 29 ] .
our finding indicated that the rare a - allele carriers ( i.e. ga - heterozygotes and aa - homozygotes ) of inos g2087a gene variant also suffered from more severe hypotension than the non - carriers of a - allele during acute puuv infection .
we recently reported two cases of puuv - hfrs with severe capillary leakage syndrome that were successfully treated with icatibant , a bradykinin b2 - receptor antagonist [ 46 , 47 ] .
the activation of the kinin - kallikrein system and the subsequent formation of bradykinin is enhanced in hantavirus - infected endothelial cells [ 48 ] .
the synthesis of enos is activated by bradykinin , which causes blood vessels to dilate via the release of no and other endothelial autacoids [ 49 ] .
interestingly , it has been demonstrated that there is an association between hfrs and acute myocardial infarction and stroke in the acute phase of the disease , which may be partly explained by the increased platelet activation [ 50 , 51 ] .
many studies have implicated enos polymorphism in the development of cardiovascular diseases [ 52 ] , and the homozygous mutant ( tt ) genotype of g894t has conferred increased susceptibility to cad [ 53 , 54 ] .
in the present study , the tt - homozygotes had the most severe aki as evaluated by maximum creatinine levels , followed by the gt - heterozygotes and the gg - homozygotes .
although the number of the tt - homozygotes in our study here was only 10 patients , the results well correspond to the other findings above that have been associated with the g894t polymorphism of the enos gene .
taken together , our findings point to the possibility of impaired constitutive no synthesis in the pathogenesis of acute hantavirus infection .
in conclusion , this study implies that enos g894t polymorphism may influence the clinical course of puuv infection .
this enos gene variant , associated with various vascular diseases , may also play some part in the endothelial and kidney dysfunction in the complex pathogenesis of acute puuv infection .
among puuv - infected patients , those with the rare tt - genotype of enos g894t polymorphism were more susceptible to severe aki .
moreover , patients with the rare a - allele of inos g2087a polymorphism had more severe hypotension during the acute phase of infection .
to our knowledge this is the first study to associate enos and inos polymorphisms and disease severity of hfrs .

the kidding rate is one of the most important economic traits for goat production , but the genetic mechanism that is associated with ovulation rate is poorly understood .
recently , increasing evidence has suggested that micrornas ( mirnas ) influence ovarian biological processes .
the present study provides the first comparison of the ovarian mirnas of prolific jintang black goats ( jtgs ) and non - prolific tibetan goats ( tbgs ) during the follicular phase using rna - seq technology .
we generated 11.19 million ( m ) and 11.34 m clean reads from the tbg and jtg libraries , respectively , from which a total of 389 known mirnas were identified and 142 novel mirnas were predicted .
a total of 191 mirnas were differentially expressed between the two breeds .
among the 10 most abundant mirnas , mir - 21 - 5p was defined as differentially expressed mirna with a higher level in the jtg library than in the tbg library , but the other mirnas were not different between the breeds .
the predicted mirna - targeted genes were further analyzed by gene ontology and kegg pathway analyses .
the results revealed that mir - 21 , mir - 99a , mirna - 143 , let - 7f , mir - 493 and mir - 200b may affect follicular development .
these findings will increase the current understanding of the role of ovarian mirnas in the regulation of ovulation rate in goats .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction micrornas ( mirnas ) are a family of small rna molecules ~ 22 nucleotides ( nt ) in length that posttranscriptionally silence gene expression by binding to and / or cleaving the 3 ' - untranslated regions ( 3 ' - utrs ) of target mrnas1 , 2 .
these molecules function in various biological processes , including cell proliferation3 , differentiation4 , apoptosis5 , tumourigenesis6 , hormone secretion7 , and metabolism8 .
a growing body of evidence indicates a possible role for mirnas in nearly all ovarian biological processes , including folliculogenesis , ovulation , luteal development , and regression , which are all widely recognized9 .
mir17 - 5p and let7b participate in angiogenesis by regulating the expression of the antiangiogenic factor tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 .
a lack of mir17 - 5p and let7b results in angiogenesis in the mouse corpus luteum ( cl ) and ultimately causes infertility10 .
a pair of mirnas ( mir - 200 and mir - 429 ) in the pituitary gland has been implicated in the regulation of female luteinizing hormone ( lh ) and fertility11 .
mir - 26b increases the number of dna breaks and promotes porcine granulose cellular ( gc ) apoptosis during follicular atresia by targeting the ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( atm ) gene12 .
there is a temporal relationship between the up - regulation of mir - 21 and the posttranscriptional regulation of programmed cell death 4 ( pdcd4 ) during porcine oocyte maturation13 .
mir - 34a regulates bovine luteal cell proliferation and function during the transition from developing to functional cl14 .
mirna - 320 in the human follicular fluid is associated with embryo quality in vivo and affects mouse embryonic development in vitro 15 .
mir - 125b can regulate the expression of genes crucial for embryo development and implantation in porcine endometrial luminal epithelial cells16 .
recently , a large number of differentially expressed known and novel mirnas that participate in the regulation of reproduction have been identified and characterized using high - throughput rna sequencing ( rna - seq ) technology .
mirnas abundant in the extracellular vesicles ( evs ) of small bovine follicles were associated with cell proliferation pathways , whereas mirnas abundant in large follicles were related to inflammatory response pathways17 .
a large number of differentially expressed known and novel mirnas have also been identified and comparatively analyzed in the ovaries of goats that are pregnant vs. non - pregnant18 or have high vs. low kidding rates19 - 21 and in pigs with high vs. low litter sizes22 .
for example , miao et al. identified 30 differentially expressed mirnas in the ovaries of highly prolific jining grey goats and the less prolific laiwu black goats , and most of these mirnas had defined homologs that were key mirnas related to reproduction21 .
jintang black goats ( jtgs ) represent a local chinese breed famous for its high fecundity ( average kidding rate = 242 %) and meat performance .
while these animals have been used in many areas of china to increase the fecundity and meat performance of local breeds , no direct evidence has been reported for the involvement of mutations with large effects on prolificacy23 .
tibetan goats ( tbgs ) ( capra hircus ) , with a population of 7.2 million , are single - birth breeds characterized by their adaptation to the cold , hypoxic ecological conditions in the qinghai - tibet plateau .
these animals provide their owners with meat where few other animals ( except for yaks and tibetan sheep ) survive , although their production traits are inferior to those of improved goat breeds .
in the present study , we summarize the first characterization and investigation of the mirna expression profiles in the ovaries of prolific jtgs and non - prolific tbgs during the follicular phase using rna - seq technology .
the results will increase the current understanding of the role of ovarian mirnas in the regulation of ovulation rate in goats .
results sequence analysis and mapping of small rna reads to identify and characterize mirnas during the follicular phase in goat ovaries , two small rna libraries , non - prolific tbgs and prolific jtgs , were constructed .
a total of approximately 14 million raw reads were obtained from each library by high - throughput sequencing .
after eliminating adaptor and low - quality reads , we finally obtained 11,192,277 ( 78.08 % of total ) and 11,341,703 ( 81.75 %) clean reads from tbgs and jtgs for further analysis , respectively ( table 1 ) .
the sequence length distributions ranging from 18 to 30 nt were similar between the two libraries , and the majority of small rna molecules ranged from 20 to 24 nt in length ( fig. 1 ) .
there was a peak at 22 nt in length , the typical size of dicer - derived products24 , which accounted for 44.89 % and 44.65 % of the total sequence reads in the tbg and jtg libraries , respectively .

the compositions of the small rna classes of the solexa sequencing results are shown in fig. 2 and supplementary table s1 .
in the present study , the total mirna accounted for 51.13 % and 50.07 % , whereas the total rrna accounted for only 3.30 % and 1.80 % in the tbg and jtg libraries , respectively , indicating that the collected ovary samples were of high quality .
a total of 5,362,108 ( 47.91 %) and 5,595,846 ( 49.34 %) clean reads in the tbg and jtg libraries , respectively , were mapped to the goat genome .

identification of conserved mirnas to identify conserved mirnas in hircine ovaries , all clean reads were aligned to the mirna precursor / mature mirnas of capra hircus in the mirbase 21.0 database ( http :// www.mirbase.org / ftp.shtml ) .
we then obtained the family groups , expression levels and sequences of the mirnas ( supplementary table s2 ) .
in summary , we identified 388 and 389 conserved mirnas in the tbg and jtg libraries , respectively .
among these molecules , 379 were co - expressed , and nine and 10 mirnas were specifically expressed in the non - prolific tbg and prolific jtg libraries , respectively .
the levels of these specifically expressed mirnas were extremely low ( under 5 read counts ) .
novel mirna prediction the hairpin structures of the mirna precursors were used to predict novel mirnas using mireap v0.2 .
these novel mirnas were then mapped to the goat genome .
in total , we detected 142 novel mirnas , of which 61 were co - expressed , and 33 and 48 were specific mirnas in the tbg and jtg libraries , respectively ( supplementary table s3 ) .
six novel mirnas with expression higher than 1,000 read counts were the same between the two libraries ( table 2 ) .

analysis of the sequencing data resulted in the identification of 191 unique mirnas , which were significantly differentially expressed in different libraries at a threshold of fold - change >= 1.0 or <= - 1.0 and a q - value < 0.05 .
among these 191 unique mirnas , 120 ( 49 prolific - specific , 71 co - expressed ) and 71 ( 33 non - prolific - specific , 38 co - expressed ) unique mirnas were up - and down - regulated , respectively , in the prolific jtg library compared to expression in the non - prolific tbg library .
the top 10 most significantly differentially expressed mirnas were mir - 21 , mir - 199b , mir - 199c , mir - 127 , mir - 200a , mir - 379 , mir - 200b , mir - 204 , mir - 411a , and mir - 493 .

to predict potential target genes regulated by mirnas .
given the high false positive rates for mirna target prediction , we only identified those potential target genes predicted by all three methods .
in the non - prolific tbg library , a total of 29,489 target genes were predicted from 388 conserved mirnas , and 29,260 target genes were predicted from 94 novel mirnas .
in the prolific jtg library , a total of 29,489 target genes were predicted from the 389 conserved mirnas , and 29,314 target genes were predicted from 109 novel mirnas ( supplementary table s5 ) .
gene ontology and kegg pathway analysis of target genes gene ontology ( go ) of the predicted mirna target genes was performed by searching against the interpro database26 using interproscan27 .
for all predicted mirna target genes in these two libraries , a total of 10,793 target genes were mapped to the go terms of cellular components , 10,486 target genes were associated with the go terms of molecular function , and 10,019 target genes were related to the biological processes of the go terms in the prolific jtg and non - prolific tbg libraries .
compared to the reference gene background , go terms were neither significantly enriched for these two libraries based on the above three ontologies in go nor significantly enriched for differentially expressed genes ( degs ) predicted from the known mirnas ( fig. 4 ) .
however , 12 go terms were significantly ( q - value < 0.05 ) enriched for degs predicted from the novel mirnas based on the molecular function ( supplementary table s6 ) , including transferase activity , metal ion binding , catalytic activity , small molecule binding , nucleotide binding , nucleoside phosphate binding , purine nucleotide binding , and others .
figure 4 go functional classification of all differentially expressed genes ( degs ) predicted from the known mirnas .
the go distributions of the degs in the ovaries of the non - prolific tibetan goats ( tbg ) vs. the prolific jintang black goats ( jtg ) were classified into three categories : cellular components ( 15 subcategories ) , molecular functions ( 14 subcategories ) , and biological processes ( 23 subcategories ) .
the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) pathways of target genes were assigned using kaas webserver28 .
kegg pathway annotation revealed that 22,885 background genes were annotated for 310 biological functions .
there were no significantly ( q - value > 0.05 ) enriched kegg pathways .
the top five pathways were olfactory transduction , regulation of actin cytoskeleton , pathways in cancer , biosynthesis of secondary metabolite , and focal adhesion in prolific jtgs compared to metabolic pathways , olfactory transduction , regulation of actin cytoskeleton , pathways in cancer , and biosynthesis of secondary metabolite in non - prolific tbgs .
the degs also participated in 310 pathways , but there were no significantly enriched kegg pathways .
the top five most enriched pathways were olfactory transduction , regulation of actin cytoskeleton , biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , focal adhesion , and endocytosis .
validation of sequencing results by quantitative real - time rt - pcr ( rt - qpcr ) the expression levels of six randomly selected mirnas , including three known mirnas ( mir - 21 - 5p , mir - 127 - 3p and mir - 199b - 5p ) and three novel mirnas ( mir - 93 , mir - 20 and mir - 81 ) , were verified in the ovaries of prolific jtgs ( n = 5 ) and non - prolific tbgs ( n = 5 ) using rt - qpcr .
solexa sequencing results indicated that four of these genes were differentially expressed .
rt - qpcr analysis demonstrated that the relative expression levels of these six selected mirnas were consistent with the rna - seq results ( fig. 5 ) .

discussion the kidding rate is fundamental to goat production , but the genetic mechanism underlying ovulation rates is poorly understood , which largely limits the improvement of this trait through genetic selection29 , 30 .
various mutations influencing ovulation rate and litter size in sheep provide additional opportunities to rapidly adjust genetic potentials , but these mutations require careful breeding management31 .
comparable major genes have not yet been identified in goats29 , 30 .
in the present study , we provided the first characterization and investigation of the ovarian mirna expression profiles of the prolific jtgs and non - prolific tbgs during the follicular phase using solexa sequencing technology .
we harvested intact ovaries from prolific and non - prolific goats during the follicular phase and completely homogenized these samples for rna extraction and thus ensured that the mirna - seq results were representative of the ovarian mirnaome .
in the present study , the length distribution showed that more than 90 % of the small rna sequences were primarily distributed in the 19 - to 24 - nt range in both libraries .
the dominant size of small rnas in the ovary was 22 nt , followed by 21 - and 23 - nt sequences .
these results are consistent with typical dicer - processed small rna products with a known 19 - to 24 - nt range for mirnas24 .
these results indicate that the high - throughput sequencing data were highly enriched for small rna sequences .
these sequencing data are consistent with previous findings in mice32 , pigs22 , goats18 - 21 , and chickens33 , but vary among bovine ovaries , where the 20 - nt size was the most abundant , followed by 22 nt34 , 35 , likely reflecting species differences .
we identified total of 388 and 389 conserved mirnas in the non - prolific tbg and prolific jtg libraries , respectively .
the 10 most highly expressed mirnas ( mir - 99a , mir - 148a , mir - 143 , mir - 10b , mir - 26a , mir - 21 , mir - 125b , mir - 27b , let - 7f , and mir - 101 ) identified in the present study were also highly expressed in the ovaries of goats18 , 20 , pigs22 , and other animal species as reviewed by li et al.9 .
six of these mirnas ( mir - 99a , mir - 143 , mir - 10b , mir - 26a , mir - 125b , and let - 7f ) are specifically or predominantly expressed in bovine ovaries compared to the somatic tissue pools ( e.g. hypothalamus , liver , heart , lung , kidney , etc. ) assessed by rt - qpcr36 .
most of these mirnas are also abundantly present in human ovaries37 .
the ovary contains oocytes and multiple somatic cell types such as gcs and theca cells .
the expression and function of mirnas are associated with different cell types .
various mirnas were expressed in gcs ( mir - 143 , mir - 125b , let - 7 family , mir - 21 , mir - 10b , mir - 378 , etc. ) 38 - 40 , theca cells ( mir - 24 , mir - 222 and mir - 378 ) 40 , 41 , and oocytes ( mir - 10a , mir - 10b , mir - 100 , let - 7 family , etc. ) 36 , 42 , 43 .
all of these mirnas were also highly expressed in goat ovaries in the present study , and they may play a housekeeping role in the ovary , independent of species .
there is increasing evidence to suggest that these ovarian specifically or predominantly expressed mirnas may play important roles in normal physical development and basic reproductive activities .
mir - 99a has been shown to be one of the most predominant mirna populations in mammalian ovaries18 , 22 , 41 ; it induces g1 - phase cell cycle arrest and suppresses tumourigenicity44 , which may play critical roles in normal ovarian functions .
mir - 125b suppresses proapoptotic protein expression45 , and androgens attenuate follicular atresia through nuclear and extranuclear signalling pathways by enhancing mir - 125b expression , which in turn suppresses proapoptotic protein expression46 .
the members of the let - 7 family play important roles in cell fate determination and are associated with regulating housekeeping genes during ovarian development47 .
target prediction indicated that mir - 143 might bind to the frizzled - 6 and frizzled - 3 receptor genes in the wnt signalling pathway , through which it affects the binding of wnt - 4 to its receptor18 .
the wnt - 4 gene , one of the most important members of the wnt family , may regulate the function of ovarian gcs and luteal cells by binding to specific members of the frizzled receptor family48 , 49 .
mir - 26a is abundant in the ovary but not in the testis .
mir - 26a promotes ovarian cancer proliferation and tumorigenesis50 , which may be related to follicle degeneration at various stages of follicular growth and development in mammalian ovaries .
in total , 142 novel mirnas were detected from the prolific jtg and non - prolific tbg libraries , which is distinctly higher than the amount predicted in the ovaries of polytocous compared with monotocous goats19 , 20 and pigs with high and low litter sizes22 .
analysis of the sequencing data resulted in the identification of 191 unique mirnas , which were significantly differentially expressed between the prolific jtg and non - prolific tbg libraries .
the top 10 most significantly differentially expressed mirnas ( mir - 21 , mir - 199b , mir - 199c , mir - 127 , mir - 200a , mir - 379 , mir - 200b , mir - 204 , mir - 411a , mir - 493 ) were analysed .
mir - 21 plays an important role in the posttranscriptional regulation of transcripts involved in the prevention of apoptosis of murine gcs .
the apoptosis increased and ovulation rate decreased in locked nucleic acid 21 ( lna - 21 ) - treated murine ovaries51 .
hasuwa et al. described anovulation and infertility in female mice lacking the micrornas mir - 200b and mir - 429 .
both mirnas are strongly expressed in the pituitary gland , where they suppress the expression of the transcriptional repressor zeb1 .
eliminating these mirnas , in turn , inhibits lh synthesis by repressing the transcription of its beta - subunit gene , thereby reducing the serum lh concentration , impairing lh surge , and repressing ovulation11 .
these results reveal roles for mir - 200b and mir - 429 , and their target gene zeb1 , in the regulation of mammalian reproduction .
thus , the hypothalamo - pituitary - ovarian axis required mir - 200b and mir - 429 to support ovulation11 .
mir - 127 has a tumour suppressor function in cancer pathways52 .
the expression level of mir - 493 - 3p was also higher in ovaries of polytocous compared with monotocous goats19 , 21 .
booroola was the first major gene ( fecb ) that has been reported to increase ovulation rate in sheep in the early 1980's53 .
twenty years later , sheep carrying the fecb have been demonstrated to have a mutation ( q249r ) in the coding sequence of the bone morphogenetic protein receptor - type 1b ( bmpr1b ) responsible for the hyperprolific phenotype54 - 56 .
recently , the bmpr1b gene has been reported to be regulated by chi - mir - 493 - 3p alone21 .
rt - qpcr was performed to analyse the expression profiles of six randomly selected mirnas ( including three known mirnas and three novel mirnas ) in prolific and non - prolific goat ovaries , and the results were consistent with the sequencing analysis , indicating the good reliability and reproducibility of transcript abundance assayed using rna - seq .
olfactory transduction , actin cytoskeleton regulation , secondary metabolite biosynthesis , focal adhesion , and endocytosis were the major pathways involving degs .
focal adhesion and actin cytoskeleton regulation pathways were also enriched in the ovary transcriptomes of other goat breeds57 , 58 .
focal adhesion plays essential roles in important biological processes , including cell motility , cell proliferation , cell differentiation , regulation of gene expression and cell survival59 .
numerous small molecular substances that regulate oocyte growth and development are transported through this connection60 .
recent studies have shown that the actin cytoskeleton also has an important function in the early development of oocyte maturation .
the regulation of the dynamic actin cytoskeleton includes signalling to the cytoskeleton , which can lead to diverse effects on cellular activity , such as changes in cell shape , migration and proliferation61 .
the cell prepares for meiosis when actin cytoskeleton dynamics change appropriately62 , 63 .
therefore , these signalling pathways are closely associated with follicle development .
in conclusion , we identified 379 co - expressed mirnas , and 9 and 10 specific mirnas in the ovaries of the non - prolific tbgs and prolific jtgs , respectively , during the follicular phase .
we also obtained 191 differentially expressed mirnas in the ovaries of the two distinctive breeds , of which 120 were up - regulated and 71 were down - regulated in the prolific jtgs compared to the non - prolific tbgs .
142 novel mirnas were predicted , of which 61 were co - expressed , and 33 and 48 were specifically expressed in the tbg and jtg libraries , respectively .
mir - 21 , mir - 99a , mirna - 143 , let - 7f , mir - 493 and mir - 200b may play important roles in follicular development .
the results of the present study will increase the current understanding of the role of ovarian mirnas in the regulation of ovulation rate in goats .
materials and methods ethics statement all experimental procedures and sample collections were conducted in accordance with the regulations for the administration of affairs concerning experimental animals ( ministry of science and technology , china ; revised in august 2011 ) and were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of southwest university for nationalities , chengdu , china .
animals and ovary collection a total of twelve healthy female goats were used in the present study from two breeds , i.e. , the extreme high prolific breed of jintang black goat ( jtg : n = 6 ) , and the non - prolific breed of tibetan goat ( tbg : n = 6 ) .
to reduce the effects of age , parity and stage of oestrus on the rna - seq results , all animals selected had the same age ( 4 - yr ) and parity ( four parities ) , and oestrus cycles were synchronized .
the jtgs had a history of successive multiple births (>= triplet births ) , and the tbgs had a history of successive single birth .
all does were treated for 13 days using controlled internal drug release devices ( cidr ) containing 300 mg progesterone ( eazi - breed cidr , interag , hamilton , new zealand ) to synchronize oestrus .
all does were intramuscularly injected with 3.75 mg of the pgf2alpha analogue luprostiol ( 0.5 ml prosolvinl , intervet ) at 24 h prior to cidr removal .
five goats showing the most synchronized time of oestrus in each breed were subsequently slaughtered at 40 h ( follicular phase ) after cidr removal .
the intact ovaries were rapidly harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen , followed by storage at - 80 degreesc for the subsequent generation of small rna libraries .
small rna library construction and sequencing the ovaries were completely ground , and total rna was extracted using trizol ( invitrogen inc. , california , usa ) .
rna purity was assessed using a nanophotometer ( r ) spectrophotometer ( implen , ca , usa ) .
the rna concentration was measured using the qubit ( r ) rna assay kit in qubit ( r ) 2.0 fluorometer ( life technologies , ca , usa ) .
rna integrity was assessed on a bioanalyzer 2100 ( agilent , usa ) using an rna nano 6000 kit ( agilent technologies , palo alto , ca ) .
one and half micrograms of total rna per sample was used as input material for the creation of two small rna libraries .
sequencing libraries were generated using a nebnext ( r ) ultratm small rna sample library prep kit for illumina ( r ) ( neb , usa ) following the manufacturer 's recommendations , and index codes were added to identify the sequences from each sample .
briefly , the rna was reversed transcribed into cdna after ligation of the multiplex 3'sr adaptor , hybridization of the reverse transcription primer , and ligation of the multiplex 5'sr adaptor .
rna libraries were amplified by pcr using illumina - compatible index primers .
the amplified libraries were resolved on a 6 % native polyacrylamide gel ( bio - rad , ca ) .
finally , the library quality was assessed on a bioanalyzer 2100 ( agilent ) , and the libraries were quantified by real - time qpcr using kapa library quantification kits ( kapa biosystems , wilmington , ma ) .
the clustering of the index - coded samples was performed on a cbot cluster generation system using a truseq pe cluster kit v4 - cbot - hs ( illumina ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
after cluster generation , the library preparations were sequenced on an illumina hiseq 2500 platform , and paired - end reads were generated .
sequence analysis the clean reads were obtained by removing reads containing with 5 ' adaptor contaminants or poly - a , reads without 3 ' adaptor or insert tag , shorter than 18 nt , or low quality reads from the raw data .
subsequently , we obtained the length , distribution and counts of these clean reads .
in the alignment and annotation steps , some small rna tags may be mapped to more than one category .
to ensure that unique small rnas mapped to only one annotation , we followed the following priority rule : rrnaetc ( genbank > rfam ) > known mirna > pirna > repeat > exon > intron24 .
all clean reads were mapped to the ncrna database from rfam 11.0 ( http :// rfam.janelia.org ) and genbank databases using a blastn algorithm .
they were also mapped to the goat genome ( http :// goat.kiz.ac.cn / ggd / download.htm ) 64 using soap v2.20 to analyze their expression and distribution in the goat genome .
the clean reads were aligned to the mirna precursor / mature mirna of capra hircus in mirbase 21.0 ( http :// www.mirbase.org / ftp.shtml ) to identify the sequences and counts of mirna families observed in the samples .
the characteristics of hairpin structures of mirna precursors can be used to predict novel mirnas .
mireap v0.2 ( http :// sourceforge.net / projects / mireap /) was used to analyze the unannotated reads .
analysis of differential mirna expression between tbgs and jtbs to compare the differential mirna expression between tbg and jtg libraries , the clean reads from each mirna were normalized using the following formula : normalized expression = mapped read count / total number of reads x 1,000,000 .
if the normalized read count of a given mirna is zero , then the expression value is set to 0.01 for further analysis .
differential expression analysis of two samples was performed using the degseq ( 2010 ) r package25 .
the p - value was adjusted using the q - value65 , and the q - value was set as the default threshold for significant differential expression .
the differentially expressed mirnas were screened with a threshold of fold - change >= 1.0 or <= - 1.0 ( the log2 jtg / tbg ) and a q - value < 0.05 .
predictions of target genes the 3 ' - utr sequences of the goat refseq genes ( http :// goat.kiz.ac.cn / ggd / download.htm ) were downloaded and used to identify mirna targets using three different computational approaches : miranda v3.3a , targetscan vert _ 61 , and pita v6 .
only the 3 ' - utr targets identified by all three approaches were further considered .
annotation of mirna targets gene ontology ( go ) and kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) enrichment analysis of the predicted mirna target genes were performed as previously described66 .
first , the go annotation was performed by searching against the interpro database26 using interproscan27 .
kegg pathways were assigned using the kaas webserver28 .
we used a hypergeometric test to identify the significantly enriched go terms or pathways in degs compared to the genome background .
multiple tests were adjusted using the false discovery rate ( fdr ) method67 .
the adjusted p - value <= 0.05 was set as the significant threshold .
validation of sequencing results using real - time rt - pcr six mirnas were selected for validation using quantitative real - time pcr ( rt - qpcr ) .
primers for rt - qpcr ( supplementary table s7 ) were designed with primer3web software ( http :// primer3.ut.ee /) .
rt - qpcrs were analysed in a biorad cfx96 real - time pcr system with sybr green pcr master mix ( bio - rad ssofast , usa ) and were amplified with 2 mul of cdna template , 10 mul of 2 x sybr green pcr supermix , and 0.5 mul of each primer ( 10 nm ) in a final volume of 20 mul by adding milliq water .
the amplification programme consisted of 95 degreesc for 10 min , followed by 40 cycles at 95 degreesc for 15 s and 60 degreesc for 15 s. the fluorescent products were detected in the last step of each cycle .
a melting curve analysis was performed at the end of 40 cycles to ensure proper amplification of target fragments .
all reactions were performed in three replicates , and beta - actin was used as the internal control .
the relative expression level of each mirna was caculated using the 2 - deltadeltact method .
the data are indicated as the means +/ - se ( n = 5 ) .
the significance of the expression in two samples was calculated using a two sample t - test in spss statistical software ( version17.0 , chicago , il , usa ) .
the difference was considered as significant when p < 0.05 .

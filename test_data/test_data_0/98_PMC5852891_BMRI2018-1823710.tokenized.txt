sarcoidosis has significant heterogeneity involving multiple organs ; treatment of the disease is a significant therapeutic challenge due to the difficulties in accurately monitoring disease activity and estimating prognosis .
fluorine - 18 - fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography / computed tomography ( 18f - fdg - pet / ct ) plays an important role in assessing the metabolic activity .
however , there is not enough evidence about the influence of this method in the clinical management and prognosis prediction for sarcoidosis .
this study aims to investigate the clinical utility of 18f - fdg pet / ct for therapeutic evaluation and prognostic prediction in sarcoidosis .
we had retrospectively enrolled 23 patients with sarcoidosis assigned to receive systemic glucocorticoids .
all patients underwent baseline 18f - fdg pet / ct before initiating therapy and follow - up 18f - fdg pet / ct within 3 months after the therapy .
the metabolic and clinical responses were classified .
the baseline 18f - fdg pet / ct showed increased uptake in all patients .
based solely on biopsy - proven sites , the sensitivity of 18f - fdg pet / ct was 91.7 % , and the sensitivity improved to 100 % after excluding skin involvement .
in the subsequent follow - up pet scans within 3 months after glucocorticoids therapy , the suvmax were variously decreased except one ; there are significant differences in the clinical remission rates and the relapse rates between patients with a favorable response and cases with no response on follow - up pet scan , the increasing metabolic response was associated with the increase in clinical remission rates and the reduction in recurrence rates .
in conclusion , the present study shows that 18f - fdg pet / ct is an effective way to monitor the early therapeutic reaction and is helpful in predicting the long - term prognosis of sarcoidosis .
1. introduction sarcoidosis is a multisystemic disease characterized by a variable clinical presentation and course , which can lead to severe problems and even death because of advanced pulmonary fibrosis and , less commonly , cardiac , central nervous system ( cns ) , and hepatic involvement [ 1 ] .
however , its prognosis is difficult to predict [ 2 ] .
what is more , monitoring disease activity and response to treatment is difficult in sarcoidosis .
traditional clinical evaluation of patients with sarcoidosis needs many different diagnostic tools , such as chest x - ray ( cxr ) , thoracic high - resolution ct ( hrct ) , and tests of serum angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) concentrations ; however , these techniques have been considered to play limited roles [ 3 , 4 ] .
ga - 67 scintigraphy showed multiple additional foci of extrathoracic pathological tracer uptake and pinpointed disease activity , but the low sensitivity of this method also limits its uses [ 5 - 7 ] .
studies have shown that whole - body fluorine - 18 - fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( 18f - fdg - pet ) or pet / computed tomography ( ct ) can be used to accurately assess disease extent and activity and evaluate treatment response [ 8 , 9 ] ; it is more sensitive and useful than ga - 67 scintigraphy in patients with sarcoidosis [ 6 , 10 - 13 ] .
however , the value of 18f - fdg pet / ct in the management and prognostic prediction of sarcoidosis is not known .
thus , we aimed to investigate the potential usefulness of 18f - fdg pet / ct for the response assessment and prognostic prediction of patients with sarcoidosis .
2. materials and methods clinical information was retrospectively obtained from patients with newly diagnosed sarcoidosis in the daping hospital between january 2011 and december 2012 .
the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was based on clinical findings , supported by histological evidence ( with the presence of noncaseating epithelioid cell granulomas on biopsies ) and after the exclusion of other diseases associated with positive pet findings , such as wegener syndrome , aspergillosis , and tuberculosis , and malignancies were in accordance with the consensus statement on sarcoidosis of the ats / ers / wasog [ 1 ] .
lacking pathological evidence , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , asymptomatic sarcoidosis , sarcoidosis without glucocorticoids therapy , receipt of other treatment , or lacking 18f - fdg pet / ct scan on the baseline and / or within 3 months after systemic corticosteroid treatment were exclusion criteria .
region of interests ( rois ) were selected as those displaying intense uptake on baseline and follow - up 18f - fdg pet , and the roi showing the maximum suv from these pet slices was taken as suvmax .
the suvmax were obtained from pet - ct report .
clinical information of patients was obtained by review of the medical record .
the metabolic response was identified as follows : complete metabolic response ( cmr ) : the decrease in suvmax of > 75 % from baseline ; partial metabolic response ( pmr ) : the decrease in suvmax between 25 % and 75 % ; stable metabolic disease ( smd ) : the decrease in suvmax < 25 % or an increase in the suvmax <= 25 % ; progressive metabolic disease ( pmd ) : the increase in suvmax of > 25 % .
five roentgenographic stages of intrathoracic changes were recognized according to the classification of scadding : stage 0 describes no mediastinal adenopathy or lung infiltrates ; stage i is bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy ; stage ii is bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and pulmonary infiltrations ; stage iii is pulmonary infiltrations without bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy ; and stage iv consists of advanced fibrosis with evidence of honeycombing , hilar retraction , bullae , cysts , and emphysema [ 1 ] .
clinical remission was defined as the significant improvement of chest radiographs and clinical symptoms (> 75 % reduction in the subjective perception of intensity of symptoms ) .
relapse was defined as the progression of clinical symptoms , and / or a radiologic progression .
the student 's t - test was applied for comparisons of the measurement data with a homogeneous variance and normal distribution , while the mann - whitney u test was used for comparisons of the measurement data with a heterogeneous variance and nonnormal distribution .
the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve was employed to determine the cutoff point for baseline suvmax in order to set apart patients with high risk of relapse .
kaplan - meier curves were applied to compare the difference of relapse - free survival between groups of different metabolic relapses .
3. results this retrospective study included 23 patients with clinically diagnosed and histologically proven sarcoidosis ( figure 1 ) ; multiple biopsies of skin , thyroid gland , sinonasal mucosa , bronchial mucosa , gastric mucosa , superficial lymph node , and thoracic lymph node were done according to patient 's clinical symptomatology and radiological outcomes .
the majority of patients had roentgenographic stage i or ii intrathoracic change ( 20 of 23 ; 87.0 %) .
the demographics and clinical characteristics are shown in table 1 .
18f - fdg pet / ct showed increased uptake in all the patients ( table 2 ) .
the intrathoracic extent of the pet - positive disease is complete in accordance with roentgenographic stage .
mean ( sd ) suvmax of positive lesions was 18.6 ( 7.1 ) ( range , 7.0 - 31.6 ) .
three patients with cxr stage iv ( patients 7 , 14 , and 20 ) showed significantly increased uptake in the lung parenchyma .
meantime , 18f - fdg pet / ct showed a more extensive disease than hrct scans in 19 cases ; unsuspected extrathoracic sarcoidosis were detected in 7 / 23 , including unsuspected neurosarcoidosis ( patient 15 ) .
abdominal and superficial lymph nodes were the most frequent extrathoracic sites found on 18f - fdg pet / ct , followed by liver , spleen , bone , and so on. in all 8 patients with biopsy - proven thoracic sarcoidosis , pathological 18f - fdg uptakes were detected above lung and / or mediastinal lymph nodes .
moreover , in 15 patients with pathologically proven extrathoracic sarcoidosis ( 16 biopsy - proven sites of sarcoidosis ) , 18f - fdg pet / ct showed 10 true positives ( tps ) in 10 patients with superficial lymph node involvement ; 2 tps in 2 patients with sinonasal mucosa involvement ; 1 tp in 1 patient with thyroid gland involvement ; 1 tp in 1 patient with gastric mucosa involvement ; 2 false negatives ( fn ) in 2 patients ( patients 13 and 18 ) with erythema nodosum .
twenty - two of 24 biopsy - proven sites of sarcoidosis were accurately detected using 18f - fdg pet / ct. based solely on biopsy - proven sites , sensitivity of 18f - fdg pet / ct was 91.7 % ; sensitivity improved to 100 % after excluding skin involvement .
figure 2 shows changes in the representative index for the roi with suvmax for all 23 patients at baseline and follow - up. the mean baseline suvmax was 15.4 +/ - 6.0 ( 23.8 - 7.0 ) in 11 patients without relapse , and 21.5 +/ - 6.8 ( 31.6 - 7.1 ) in 12 patients with relapse ( p = 0.034 ) .
the roc analysis revealed a suvmax 18.1 as an optimal cut - off level to distinguish between patients with good prognosis and with higher risk of relapse ( auc = 0.742 , 95 % ci : 0.537 - 0.948 ) with a sensitivity of 83.3 % and a specificity of 63.6 % ( figure 3 ) .
in the subsequent follow - up pet scans within 3 months after systemic corticosteroid therapy , the suvmax were variously decreased except patient 17 compared with that at baseline ( table 2 ) ; all the lesions with the most intense uptake but patient 7 were the same as baseline pet / ct scan .
on the last follow - up pet scan within 3 months , a favorable metabolic response ( cmr , 6 patients ; pmr , 7 patients ) was seen in 56.5 % of the patients ( as shown in figure 4 ) , and 10 patients ( smd ) had no response on pet scan ( as shown in figure 5 ) .
patients with different situations , after taking corticosteroids , had varying degrees of and generally fewer symptoms ; some patients could achieve symptomatic improvement .
as shown in table 3 , 4 patients with cmr were in clinical remission 3 months after the treatment , and the clinical remission rate rose to 100 % within 6 months. with 5 - year follow - up , no recurrence was found in patients with cmr .
among 7 patients with pmr , the clinical remission rates were 42.9 % and 71.4 % within 3 months and 6 months after treatment , which were as low as 10.0 % and 40.0 % in 10 patients with smd .
meanwhile , 5 - year recurrent rate was 57.1 % in pmr patients and it was as high as 80.0 % in smd patients .
as illustrated in figure 6 , the kaplan - meier survival curves showed a significant difference in relapse - free survival between patients with a favorable metabolic response ( cmr and pmr ) and those with smd ( log rank test p = 0.020 ) ( figure 5 ) .
4. discussion several studies reported a high sensitivity of 18f - fdg pet / ct in sarcoidosis [ 5 , 6 ] .
in the current series , 18f - fdg pet / ct was contributing the detection of anatomic extent of sarcoidosis , but , more importantly , the baseline suvmax and metabolic response might help to predict the prognosis of sarcoidosis patients with corticosteroids , suggesting that these may be reliable predictors to stratify sarcoidosis patients treated with systemic corticosteroid .
sarcoidosis may contain numerous different clinical presentations .
the rapid diagnosis and the accurate judgment of damage to important extrapulmonary organs and inflammatory activity of pulmonary fibrosis is the fundamental premise of the proper treatment [ 1 , 2 ] .
however , diverse and less typical presentations are present in 50 % - 75 % of cases , which may lead to delayed diagnosis [ 14 ] .
what is more , for traditional means , noninvasive assessment of the granulomatous inflammatory activity and of the extent of sarcoidosis remains a challenge [ 15 ] .
our results showed that 18f - fdg pet / ct had a good sensitivity in evaluating disease extent in sarcoidosis and made it possible to study morphological and metabolic changes together .
consequently , it may contribute to initial individualized treatment plans by means of detecting unsuspected crucial extrathoracic diseases especially for asymptomatic patients , and differentiating foci of active inflammatory from lung fibrosis .
additionally , follow - up 18f - fdg pet / ct may be particularly useful in diagnosis of sarcoidosis without pathologic evidence for the sensitivity in reflecting the metabolic activity changes , which were associated with the early therapeutic effect of glucocorticoids .
accordingly , the application of 18f - fdg pet / ct in the accurate diagnosis and treatment will have a high potential .
systemic glucocorticoids remain the most commonly used drug for treating sarcoidosis [ 1 ] .
timely dose modification ( including discontinuation ) is conducive to mitigating the side effects , which depend on the accurate treatment response evaluation .
however , no clear protocol has been validated for dose and treatment duration [ 16 ] .
yamane et al. reported that pet / ct is capable of identifying very early response to treatment in cancer patients [ 17 ] .
this " therapeutic test " could obviously not be used only in cancer patients ; effective treatment could also decrease 18f - fdg uptake in inflammation ; the quantitative approach using suv is useful in the estimation of residual inflammatory activity in patients partially responding to anti - inflammatory treatment .
in our study , a favorable metabolic response occurred in a part of patients whose clinical remission had not yet appeared .
it suggests that 18f - fdg pet / ct is a more sensitive parameter of the therapeutic effect than clinical manifestations in sarcoidosis , which may be beneficial in making treatment and regulatory decisions timely and correctly .
interestingly , it was also found that there are significant differences in the relapse rates between patients with a favorable response and stable disease on follow - up pet scan ; the reduction in recurrent rate depended on the increasing metabolic response .
the present results indicate that serial assessment of the changes of pet scans is useful in predicting prognosis .
5. conclusion altogether , 18f - fdg pet / ct is able to detect changes in the magnitude and extent of inflammatory activity during follow - up and plays a unique role in clinical management of sarcoidosis .
more importantly , 18f - fdg pet / ct may be valuable in predicting long - term clinical outcome of sarcoidosis via the basic suvmax level and the metabolic response to systemic corticosteroid therapy .
conflicts of interest no potential conflicts of interest were disclosed .

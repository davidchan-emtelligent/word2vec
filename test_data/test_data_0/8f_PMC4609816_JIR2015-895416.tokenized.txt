1. introduction human alveolar echinococcosis ( ae ) is a lethal parasitic infectious disease which may lead to liver failure if left untreated .
it is caused by the larval stage of the fox tapeworm echinococcus multilocularis and usually develops a substantial occupation in solid organs [ 1 ] .
liver is the most common targeted organ which accounts for nearly 95 % of infections , with 5 % percent to other organs including lung , brain , and bone .
the parasite usually displays a cancer - like biological behavior and infiltrates to the liver tissue and major vasculature and is characterized by its granulomas formation .
previous studies have shown that cd4 + t cell subsets play an active role in the development and immune response in ae and showed an upregulation of t helper ( th ) 2 immune response which has been shown in the liver lesions locally and in circulating lymphocytes in animal models and patients .
there is , however , evidence that cellular immunity and th1 related cytokines also play a role by controlling totally the parasite growth in some individuals and limiting the size of the lesions in patients with the diseases .
clearly , th1 / th2 imbalance plays an important role in controlling the immunopathogenesis of ae infection .
meanwhile , the immunological responses of host 's th17 and treg cells against ae have been extensively studied and displayed an important role of both t helper cells in immune tolerance and immune - pathological injury during the infection [ 2 , 3 ] .
th9 cells , a new member of cd4 + t cell family which is characterized by its specific cytokine il - 9 and transcription factors pu.1 and irf - 4 , have been known recently to have a critical role in allergic diseases and cancers as well as the parasitic infection .
our previous study has shown that th9 cells have been involved in the immune response on cystic echinococcosis [ 4 ] .
however , whether this novel t cell subset is involved in regulating the immune response during the infection and development of ae is still unclear .
thus , we aimed to evaluate mrna expression levels of il - 9 , pu.1 , and irf - 4 in pbmcs and circulating cytokine il - 9 in ae patients and healthy control , as well as the mrna levels of il - 9 , pu.1 , and irf - 4 in lesion , paralesion , and normal hepatic tissues in hepatic ae patients in an effort to evaluate their potential role , if any , in the disease and their relation to disease activity .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
patients this study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki ( 1964 ) and conformed to the approved institutional guidelines and was approved by the ethical committee of xinjiang medical university .
twenty - eight subjects were eligible for this study and informed consents were obtained from every single subject .
they were divided into two groups : healthy control group ( hc ) and alveolar echinococcosis group ( ae ) , with each group containing fourteen subjects .
healthy controls were qualified for medical testing and attended voluntarily , including 8 men and 6 women .
all the patients with ae infection including 6 men and 8 women underwent surgery in the department of liver & laparoscopic surgery , first affiliated hospital of xinjiang medical university .
the infection with e. multilocularis in all patients was confirmed by postoperative pathological examination .
all ae patients were classified according to the who / iwge classification [ 5 ] .
no patient was treated with anti - inflammatory drugs such as nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids .
none had chronic inflammatory disease , cardiovascular disease , disseminated intravascular coagulation , advanced lung disease , renal failure , malignant disease , or other infectious diseases ( such as septicemia and pneumonia ) .
2.2 .
blood samples blood samples were obtained from all the subjects in the recumbent position with a 21 - gauge needle for clean venipuncture of an antecubital vein after admission in a fasting state on the following morning of the admission day .
the samples were collected into collection tubes containing 0.2 ml sodium heparin .
peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) were prepared by ficoll density gradient for analysis of real - time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) .
plasma was obtained after centrifugation and stored at - 80degreesc for the measurement of the cytokine and transcription factors .
2.3 .
surgery and liver tissue samples all resections were performed via laparotomy .
all surgical procedures were performed by three experienced hepatic surgeons .
experienced senior surgeons carried out all partial hepatic resections to guarantee at least one - centimeter safety margin .
frozen section examinations at the hepatic transsection line were performed in all cases .
all surgical specimens were reviewed by a senior pathologist .
clinical and pathologic staging were reassessed according to the world health organization on alveolar echinococcosis pnm classification of ae. only one sample of lesion , paralesion ( hepatic tissue within 1 cm from the ae lesion ) , and normal liver tissues was obtained for all the patients .
the specimens had been snap - frozen in rna later and liquid nitrogen for 15 seconds and were immediately stored at - 80degreesc .
2.4 .
il - 9 , pu.1 , and irf - 4 mrna expression determined by real - time pcr total rna was extracted with trizol extraction ( invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's instruction .
cdna was synthesized using primerscript rt reagent kit ( takara , biotechnology , dalian , china ) .
sybr green primers for human il - 9 , pu.1 , irf - 4 , and gapdh mrna were purchased from sangon , shanghai .
the samples were analyzed using the abi prism 7900 sequence detection system ( biorad , life science research , hercules , ca , usa ) .
the following primer pairs were used : il - 9 : f : 5 ' - ctctagcagtccact tcaccaa - 3 ' , r : 5 ' - acagcatgggtctgtcttct - 3 ' ; pu.1 : f : 5 ' - ggagcccggctggatgttac - 3 ' , r : 5 ' - caccaggtcttctgatggctga - 3 ' ; irf - 4 : f : 5 ' - gacccgcagatgtccatgag - 3 ' , r : 5 ' - tgtagttgtgaacctgctggg - 3 ' ; gapdh : f : 5 ' - gcaccgtcaaggctgagaac - 3 ' , r : 5 ' - tggtgaagacgccagtgga - 3 ' .
for each sample , mrna expression was normalized to the level of gapdh housekeeping genes ( table 1 ) .
both the housekeeping and the target genes for each sample were amplified in triplicate using the following procedure of initial denaturation at 95degreesc for 3 min , 39 cycles of 95degreesc for 10 s , 60degreesc for 30 s , and 65degreesc for 5 s , and after that they directly evolved to the ultimate temperature of 95degreesc .
the 2 - deltadeltact method was used to determine the cycle number ct value corresponding to a specific fluorescence threshold and quantify the target genes .
2.5 .
elisa detection of plasma concentration level of il - 9 the plasma levels of il - 9 were measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) , following the manufacturer 's protocols ( all kits from elabscience biotechnology co. , ltd. ) .
the minimal detectable concentrations range was 15.625 pg / ml for il - 9 , and the sensitivity was 9.375 pg / ml. intra - assay and interassay coefficients of variation for all elisa were < 5 % and < 10 % , respectively .
all samples were measured in duplicate .
2.6 .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using the spss 17.0 , and values are expressed as median ( p25 and p75 ) in the text and tables .
the data were analyzed by using nonparametric friedman test .
if significance was found , wilcoxon signed ranks test and mann - whitney u test were performed to detect the difference among groups .
spearman correlation was used as a test of correlation between two continuous variables .
correlations were determined by spearman correlation coefficients .
a probable value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .
3. results 3.1 .
basic clinical characteristics of patients age , gender , diameters of lesions , and previous surgical history are listed in table 2 .
there were no significant differences between the two groups .
four patients have undergone laparotomy for cholecystectomy in three patients and laparoscopic exploration in one patient at another institution .
all patients in the ae group underwent hepatic resections .
all ae patients were classified according to the pnm classification of who / iwge as abovementioned .
among them , 12 patients were classified as p1n0m0 and the rest of them were classified as p2n0m0 ( p1 : peripheral hepatic lesion with no proximal hepatic vascular or biliary involvement ; p2 : central hepatic lesion with proximal involvement of vessels biliary ducts in one lobe ; n0 : no regional involvement ; m0 : no metastasis ) .
3.2 .
expression of il - 9 , pu.1 , and irf - 4 mrna in pbmcs in two groups il - 9 is the main cytokine secreted by th9 cells .
pu.1 and irf - 4 are significant transcription factors for the differentiation of th9 cells .
we thus investigated the expressions of il - 9 , pu.1 , and irf - 4 mrna in pbmcs from patients with ae and healthy controls .
as shown in figure 1 and table 3 , the expression levels of il - 9 , pu.1 , and irf - 4 mrna were all significantly higher in ae group than those in hc group (*** p < 0.001 , *** p < 0.001 , and *** p < 0.001 , resp. ) .
3.3 .
expression of il - 9 , pu.1 , and irf - 4 mrna in different liver tissues of ae patients as shown in figure 2 , the relative expression levels of il - 9 mrna in lesion tissues ( 1.248 ; iqr , 0.389 - 3.071 ) were markedly higher than those in paralesion and normal tissues ( 0.008 ; iqr , 0.002 - 0.105 ; ** p = 0.002 , 0.002 ; iqr , 0.001 - 0.007 ; *** p < 0.001 ) , and there was no statistical significance between paralesion group and normal group ( p > 0.05 ) .
pu.1 mrna expression levels were elevated in lesion tissues ( 2.675 ; iqr , 0.851 - 4.865 ) as compared with those in paralesion and normal tissues ( 0.111 ; iqr , 0.085 - 0.782 ; * p = 0.013 , 0.065 ; iqr , 0.034 - 0.083 ; *** p < 0.001 ) .
significantly elevated levels of irf - 4 mrna were found in lesion group ( 0.025 ; iqr , 0.009 - 0.413 ) compared to those in normal group ( 0.007 ; iqr , 0.005 - 0.031 ; *** p < 0.001 ) .
however , there was no statistical significance between lesion group and paralesion group ( p > 0.05 ) .
3.4 .
plasma cytokine concentrations in two groups as shown in figure 3 , the plasma il - 9 concentration levels were slightly lower in ae group than those in hc group , and there was no statistical significance between the two groups ( p > 0.05 ) .
3.5 .
correlation analysis between il - 9 and pu.1 and irf - 4 mrna expression levels in pbmcs and liver tissues as showed in figures 4 ( a ) and 4 ( b ) , il - 9 mrna expression in pbmcs had a positive correlation with pu.1 and irf - 4 mrna expression ( r = 0.8228 , *** p < 0.0001 ; r = 0.9332 , *** p < 0.0001 , resp. ) .
spearman correlation coefficients indicated that il - 9 mrna expression in the liver tissues had a positive correlation with both pu.1 and irf - 4 mrna expression ( r = 0.7996 , *** p < 0.0001 , r = 0.4467 ; ** p = 0.003 , resp. ) as shown in figures 4 ( c ) and 4 ( d ) .
4. discussion along the years , the important role of both innate and acquired immunity in the field of e. multilocularis infection has been extensively studied .
among them , the role of cd4 + t cells in the development of the parasitic lesion and immune evasion from human immune system 's attack has been highlighted [ 6 ] .
it is widely acknowledged that the parasitic infection can initiate a successful crosstalk between human immune system and parasite itself and actively modulate cd4 + t cells development , thus guaranteeing its persistent survival .
both clinical and experimental studies displayed that e. multilocularis infection accompanies the imbalanced th1 / th2 immune profile which is in favor of the parasitic survival [ 7 - 9 ] .
although different infection phase demonstrated various immune response patterns , the enhanced th2 response and ameliorated th1 response are considered to be linked with the survival of the parasite .
recent advances in the field of immunology have commenced new era for parasitic immunology .
further studies on novel t cell subset have unveiled the previously unknown phenomenon .
like other autoimmune diseases , cancers , fungal diseases , and parasitic infections , the reciprocal role of th17 and treg cells has drawn a great interest [ 10 , 11 ] .
our previous animal and human studies have shown that the treg cells overwhelmed immune response , although no significant alteration was found in terms of th17 [ 2 , 12 ] .
as a new member of cd4 + t cell family , th9 cells have been known to play a significant role in some diseases , such as allergic diseases and cancers as well as the parasitic infections [ 13 ] .
furthermore , th9 cells , through the expression of the effector cytokine il - 9 , are more efficient than classical th2 cells at orchestrating antihelminthic responses in helminthic infection in vivo [ 14 ] .
our recent research has shown that th9 and its functional cytokine il - 9 are upregulated in ce patients suggesting that they may be involved in regulating the immune response or even promote the process of echinococcus granulosus infection [ 4 ] .
however , whether th9 cells also participate in the ae infection has not been studied yet , so we implemented this research to investigate its potential function in the ae infection .
two decades before the description of th9 cells , it was reported that il - 9 production by cd4 + t cells depends on il - 2 , is promoted by il - 4 and transforming growth factor tgf - beta , and is further enhanced by il - 1 , while ifn - gamma represents a potent inhibitor of il - 9 expression [ 15 ] .
as a great body of previous studies have revealed that il - 9 produced by th9 cell promoted pathogenic processes in several autoimmune diseases , such as allergy and asthma [ 16 ] .
accumulating studies revealed a major role for il - 9 in protection against and expulsion of some helminthic parasites .
as demonstrated in a recent study , il - 9 blockade prevents worm expulsion in mice infected with trichinella spiralis , indicating that il - 9 was a pivotal cytokine to mediate effective expulsion of t. spiralis and was important for mediating an effective worm clearance [ 17 ] .
in this study , il - 9 mrna expression level was markedly increased in ae patient 's pbmcs and , most intriguingly , the il - 9 mrna expression levels were exponentially higher in ae lesions than in paralesion and normal liver tissues .
however , the plasma il - 9 concentration levels in patients with ae were lower than in hc group without statistical significance .
this suggests that il - 9 may be involved in ae infection process and may have a potential role in parasite clearance as shown in previous studies [ 4 ] .
pu.1 and another transcription factor irf - 4 are key transcription factors that induce differentiation of th0 cells into th9 cells .
pu.1 plays a crucial role in the regulation and expression of cd80 , cd86 , and cells in the hematopoietic system and it can also block several autoimmune diseases and even induce donor - specific tolerance to allograft [ 18 ] .
a recent research showed that modifications in the pu.1 promoter uniquely and dynamically control the threshold for th9 cells development in naive and memory cd4 + t cells [ 19 ] .
detailed analyses revealed that some cytokines play a pivotal role in th9 development and function by inducing the expression of pu.1 [ 20 ] .
some studies have described pu.1 as a unique regulator of th9 memory acquisition and th9 immunity [ 21 ] .
it has been reported to determine th9 cells development and can enhance or be required for il - 9 production in th9 cells [ 22 ] .
t cell specific deletion of pu.1 results in decreased il - 9 production in vitro , as well as in vivo , coincident with diminished allergic inflammation [ 23 ] .
irf - 4 was also found to be crucial in th9 response , as irf - 4 deficient cd4 + t cell failed to develop into il - 9 - producing th9 cells , and irf - 4 rnai knockdown suppressed il - 9 production in wt cd4 + t cells .
furthermore , chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that irf - 4 directly bound to the il - 9 promoter in th9 cells [ 24 ] .
our previous study on cystic echinococcosis , which is caused by e. granulosus , has showed a distinct increase of both il - 9 and pu.i in infected patients' pbmcs [ 4 ] .
in line with this , this study for the first time displayed the dramatic highly elevated levels of il - 9 , pu.1 , and irf - 4 mrna in both pbmcs and hepatic tissues , albeit with no clear alteration in plasma levels .
hepatic ae patients in this study were all categorized according to the pnm classification of who / iwge and 12 were categorized p1n0m0 and two were p2n0m0 .
all the cases were progressive ae patients .
the regional discrepancies of il - 9 , pu.1 , and irf - 4 mrna are quite clear in parasitic lesion , paralesion , and normal tissues .
this may be because the parasite itself and its functional molecules modulate the systemic and regional t helper cell differentiation thus creating th9 dominating immune response which is now known to be in favor of parasitic survival and , thus , may play a role in immune response and granuloma formation during the ae infection .
furthermore , as revealed in the correlation analysis in this study , il - 9 expression levels were positively correlated with the levels of pu.1 and irf - 4 expression , respectively , both in pbmcs and in local hepatic lesion tissues .
these details further confirmed the significant roles of pu.1 and ifr - 4 in the differentiation and function of th9 cells .
in conclusion , the results reveal a rising trend in th9 levels in both local and pbmcs in patients with ae. moreover , a recent study implicated a potential role of th9 cells promoting pathology in filarial disease and suggested it is dependent on the effect of il - 9 on promoting inflammatory responses in target cells [ 25 ] .
these details suggest that th9 / il - 9 were involved in the ae infection and response during the e. multilocularis - host interplay and might play critical potentially beneficial roles in the parasite survival and pathogenesis in ae infection .
in our study , we disclosed for the first time that th9 cell and its signature cytokine il - 9 and transcription factors pu.1 and irf - 4 were upregulated in peripheral and local hepatic tissues in ae patients .
our research strongly indicates that th9 / il - 9 may be associated with development of e. multilocularis infection and even may play a critical potential role to facilitate the infiltrative growth of the parasite and its persistence in human host .
further studies should be implemented for exploring the exact mechanism , and we believe it will deserve further attention in future studies .

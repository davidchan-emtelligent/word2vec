doi : 10.1016 / j.neuroimage.2016.08.043 interoception interstitial cells of cajal vagal afferents pacemaking brain gut axis motility gastric motility the study by richter et al .
( 2017 ) found significant electrophysiological communication between gastric pacemaker activity and the alpha rhythm within certain regions of the cerebral cortex including the right anterior insula .
in other words , they found a role for interstitial cells of cajal in interoception , the sensory system responsible for detecting internal regulation responses .
the communication between icc and the insular cortex occurred through phase amplitude coupling , the phase of the lower frequency gastric pacemaker modulated the amplitude of alpha waves in the anterior insula .
although phase amplitude coupling has almost exclusively been shown to occur within the brain , this study discovered that it also facilitates gut - - brain communication .
interestingly , phase amplitude coupling was also observed within the gut ; the amplitude of the higher frequency dominant intestinal pacemaker [ the " slow wave " generated by interstitial cells of cajal associated with the myenteric plexus ( icc - mp ; huizinga et al. , 1995 ; thomsen et al. , 1998 )] was seen to be modulated by the phase of a lower frequency induced rhythmic depolarization likely originating in the network of icc associated with the deep muscular plexus ( icc - dmp ) ( huizinga et al. , 2014 ) .
this interaction changed propulsive activity into the classical segmentation pattern of the intestine associated with absorption of nutrients .
the study from richter et al .
( 2017 ) is highly significant since it demonstrates the ongoing monitoring of gastric pacemaker activity by the right anterior insula .
in the stomach , the three - cycles / min pacemaker activity responsible for the orchestration of its dominant peristaltic activity , is generated by a network of icc - mp and icc - im ( the intramuscular icc ) ( edwards and hirst , 2006 ) .
the communication between gastric icc and the brain involves the intramuscular array ( ima ) - icc - complexes which incorporate icc - im , nerve endings of the vagal afferents and varicosities of motor neurons ( powley et al. , 2008 , 2016 ) , ideally suited for bi - directional communication with the brain ( figure 1 ) .
the vagal afferents connect to the insular cortex via the nucleus tractus solitarius ( shipley , 1982 ) and the insular cortex innervates the dorsal motor nucleus , which , in turn , provides innervation to enteric nerves of the stomach ( berthoud et al. , 1990 ) .
the insular cortex was activated during gastric balloon distention and deactivated during ingestion of a meal , indicating a detailed monitoring of stomach conditions ( geeraerts et al. , 2011 ) .
vagal afferents are all connected to icc ( powley et al. , 2016 ) indicating that the vagus will not monitor individual icc but the features of the interconnected network of icc ( huizinga et al. , 2015 ; pawelka and huizinga , 2015 ; wei et al. , 2016 ) .
how detailed information from this network is conveyed to the brain should be a topic for future research .
this information will contain signals from several slow waves propagating over the stomach at the same time .
this information will contain changes in icc network properties that occur in response to a meal ( chen and mccallum , 1992 ) ( berthoud , 2008 ) , which may relate to satiety ( andrews and sanger , 2002 ) .
there is the potential that detailed information regarding meal quality and / or quantity , or even types of nutrients ingested could be signaled via alterations in icc signaling .
detailed information is now emerging how icc network properties change in patients with gastroparesis ( o'grady et al. , 2012 ; o'grady and abell , 2015 ) and diabetes ( he et al. , 2001 ) .
dyspepsia may relate to abnormal vago - vagal reflexes , including efferent innervation and abnormal signaling from the stomach to the insula or abnormal processing of such signals ( page and blackshaw , 2009 ; lee et al. , 2016 ) .
abnormalities in initiation and conduction were observed in patients with gastroparesis in the presence of a normal 3 cpm frequency ( o'grady et al. , 2012 ) suggesting that in certain conditions , the recorded icc pacemaker frequency may be normal but that it is the injury to the icc network that is related to gastroparesis , which may relate to delayed gastric emptying and / or the initiation of nausea and vomiting through vagal afferents .
gastric dysmotilities are also related to depression indicating the myriad of ways that different regions of the brain can influence each other ( ruhland et al. , 2008 ) .
gastric slow wave activity changes markedly in response to neurotransmitters and hormones ( el - sharkawy and szurszewski , 1978 ; el - sharkawy et al. , 1978 ) , hence it is likely that the insular cortex monitors such changes .
vagal stretch and tension receptors are always incorporated in mechanistic explanations as to how the stomach signals to the brain ( young et al. , 2008 ; kentish et al. , 2013 ) .
the study of richter et al .
( 2017 ) suggests that the icc - ima complexes are a sensorimotor unit and that sensations might be primarily integrated by and expressed by icc activity and as such monitored by the insular cortex , where , in conjunction with other regions of the brain , conscious and subconscious decisions are made how to react to these stimuli .
monitoring of slow wave activity , even at rest ( richter et al. , 2017 ) , ensures an exquisitely sensitive system that is instantly available to inform the brain of any activity , change in activity or abnormal conditions .
further investigations into the role of icc will be essential to unravel this gut brain communication pathway , including the sensitivity of icc to inflammation , the remarkable ability of icc to recover from severe injury and loss ( wang et al. , 2002 ; bettolli et al. , 2012 ) and the molecular basis of icc network regeneration ( hayashi et al. , 2013 ) .
figure 1 branches of imas ( brown , 3,3 ' - diaminobenzadine stained ) run in tight apposition with icc - im ( blue - gray , c - kit immuno - labeled with peroxidase ) .
branches of ima arrays vary in their degree of varicosity and in the tightness of apposition .
( a ) four neighboring principal branches of an ima array coursing in tight apposition with a network of neighboring icc - im intercalated among smooth muscle bundles ( unstained ) .
in this example , the ima branches express modest swellings or varicosities , most of which are in close proximity to the somata and processes of icc - im .
( b ) two neighboring principal branches of an ima array course near to , and appear to contact intermittently , the local icc - im network .
in contrast to the array branches shown in ( a ) , those shown in ( b ) are more lamelliform , the apparent contacts with the icc - im are more intermittent , and many of the ima lamellae appear to lie on the smooth muscle bundles ( unstained ) adjacent to the icc - im network .
( c,d ) two examples of principal ima branches that course in tight conjunction with icc - im and form swellings or varicosities on both icc - im somata and fibers .

background clinical applicability of folate receptor - targeted intraoperative molecular imaging ( fr - imi ) has been established for surgically resectable pulmonary adenocarcinoma .
a role for fr - imi in other lung cancer histologies has not been studied .
in this study , we evaluate feasibility of fr - imi in patients undergoing pulmonary resection for squamous cell carcinomas ( sccs ) .
methods in a human clinical trial ( nct02602119 ) , twelve subjects with pulmonary sccs underwent fr - imi with a near - infrared contrast agent that targets the folate receptor - alpha ( fralpha ) , otl38 .
near - infrared signal from tumors and benign lung was quantified to calculate tumor - to - background ratios ( tbr ) .
folate receptor - alpha expression was characterized , and histopathologic correlative analyses were performed to evaluate patterns of otl38 accumulation .
an exploratory analysis was performed to determine patient and histopathologic variables that predict tumor fluorescence .
results 9 of 13 sccs ( in 9 of 12 of subjects ) displayed intraoperative fluorescence upon nir evaluation ( median tbr , 3.9 ) .
otl38 accumulated within sccs in a fralpha - dependent manner .
fr - imi was reliable in localizing nodules as small as 1.1 cm , and prevented conversion to thoracotomy for nodule localization in three subjects .
upon evaluation of patient and histopathologic variables , in situ fluorescence was associated with distance from the pleural surface , and was independent of alternative variables including tumor size and metabolic activity .
conclusions this work demonstrates that fr - imi is potentially feasible in 70 % of scc patients , and that molecular imaging can improve localization during minimally invasive pulmonary resection .
these findings complement previous data demonstrating that ~ 98 % of pulmonary adenocarcinomas are localized during fr - imi and suggest broad applicability for nsclc patients undergoing resection .
squamous cell carcinoma surgery molecular imaging folate receptor introduction each year , nearly 200,000 americans are diagnosed with non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) [ 1 ] .
surgical resection provides the best opportunity for long - term survivorship for nsclc patients , and nearly 80,000 patients undergo pulmonary resection in the united states annually [ 1 ] .
although the use of minimally invasive pulmonary resection ( video - assisted thoracic surgery or robotic surgery ) for nsclc is common , these approaches limit a surgeon 's ability to visually inspect and palpate the entire lung [ 2 ] .
consequential incomplete intraoperative information during minimally invasive pulmonary resection can make localization and adequate resection of tumors challenging .
intraoperative molecular imaging ( imi ) , also known as fluorescence guided surgery , is a rapidly evolving technique that has been demonstrated to improve the surgeon 's ability to accurately identify malignant nodules during oncologic resection [ 3 - 10 ] .
this approach incorporates the systemic delivery of optical contrast agents which preferentially accumulate in malignant tissues , and allows for real - time fluorescent imaging using calibrated camera systems .
imi has been effectively utilized for a variety of malignancies including thoracic malignancies [ 11 - 14 ] , central nervous system tumors [ 15 ] , head and neck cancers [ 8 ] , ovarian carcinomas [ 5 ] , and thymoma [ 16 ] .
over the last decade our group has initiated several human clinical trials involving folate receptor - targeted intraoperative molecular imaging ( fr - imi ) for the most common nsclc histology , pulmonary adenocarcinomas [ 3 , 11 , 13 , 17 - 19 ] .
pulmonary adenocarcinomas were chosen as an initial disease histology given a high level of fralpha expression which approaches 85 % [ 13 , 20 , 21 ] .
in a phase i trial , we found fr - imi with otl38 to be both safe and feasible .
after optimizing imaging parameters , we appreciated that more than 90 % of pulmonary adenocarcinomas accumulated otl38 and displayed fluorescence in situ or ex vivo [ 13 ] .
in a follow - up study involving 50 subjects , the addition of fr - imi to standard of care intraoperative assessment allowed for detection of occult subcentimeter nodules in 12 % of subjects [ 3 ] .
together , these intraoperative findings impacted operative planning , tumor staging , and postoperative adjuvant therapy treatment .
although initial trials with fr - imi have been successful for localization of pulmonary adenocarcinomas , utility for other nsclc histologies remains undefined .
pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas ( sccs ) account for approximately 30 % of all lung cancers and 35 % of nsclcs , thus exploration of imi with otl38 in sccs has the potential for high clinical impact [ 22 ] .
unfortunately , there is currently a paucity of information describing fralpha expression patterns in sccs [ 20 , 21 ] .
further , the few reports describing fralpha expression provide conflicting data , with fralpha expression levels ranging from 10 % to 60 % [ 20 , 21 ] .
this limited information has impeded progress of folate - receptor targeted molecular imaging for sccs .
as our group prepares to move fr - imi with otl38 to phase ii evaluations , we sought to better understand the utility of fr - imi in patients with scc .
in this report , we evaluate fr - imi with otl38 in 12 subjects undergoing minimally invasive pulmonary resection for sccs .
in this study , our primary goals were to determine if otl38 reliably accumulates within scc and generates tumor fluorescence .
our secondary goals were to characterize folate receptor expression within scc 's and determine factors which contribute to tumor fluorescence during fr - imi .
results subject and drug delivery data between august 2015 and february 2017 , 12 subjects with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary scc underwent vats resection with fr - imi with otl38 .
seven included subjects were male and 5 were female .
the median age of subjects at resection was 70 years ( iqr , 68 - 77 years ) .
except for subject 5 , all subjects had a solitary pulmonary nodule by preoperative imaging .

sccs displaying fluorescence during fr - imi in situ molecular imaging using the iridium 's thoracoscopic configuration identified tumor - specific fluorescence signal through the pleural surface in 7 ( 58.3 %) of 12 subjects ( figure 1a - 1d ; supplementary video 1 ) , with 7 of 13 ( 53.8 %) nodules being localized by nir imaging .
upon thoracoscopic nir evaluation , the median tumor fluorescence intensity was noted to be 91.0 au ( iqr , 83 - 105 au ) ( figure 1e ) , which was higher than within surrounding benign pulmonary parenchyma which measured 28.5 au ( iqr , 23 - 45 au ) ( figure 1f ) ; p < 0.001 ( figure 1g ) .
the median in situ tbr of nodules displaying in situ fluorescence was 2.4 ( iqr , 2.2 - 3.7 ) .
the median size of the 7 in situ fluorescent tumors was 1.7cm ( range , 1.1 - 4.6 cm ) .
based on preoperative imaging , each of these tumors were sub - pleural and located within 1.2cm of the lung surface .

after resection and direct tumor exposure during ex vivo tumor bisection , two sccs which were non - fluorescent by thoracoscopic assessment displayed obvious ex vivo fluorescence upon tumor bisection ( subject 1 and subject 10 ) ( figure 2a - 2f ; supplementary video 2 ) .
all ( 7 of 7 ) sccs exhibiting in situ signal also displayed fluorescence upon exoscopic fr - imi .
in total , 9 of 13 ( sensitivity 69.2 % ; false negative rate of 31.8 %) evaluated sccs evaluated ( in 9 of 12 subjects ) displayed strong signal during fr - imi .
we noted uniform tumor - associated fluorescence throughout the tumor surface with a clear demarcation noted between the tumor margin and benign surrounding lung parenchyma ( figure 2f ) .
median fluorescence of these 9 sccs was nearly 4 - fold higher than signal of surrounding benign lung ( 103 vs 29 au ; p < 0.001 ) ( figure 2g - 2i ) .
the median tbr of those sccs displaying ex vivo fluorescence upon bisection was 3.9 ( iqr , 3.5 - 4.2 ) ; which was higher than tbrs observed during in situ fluorescent evaluation ; p = 0.02. of note , lesions displaying only signal upon ex vivo evaluation were similar in size to those displaying in situ ( median 4.1cm vs 1.7cm ; p = 0.18 ) ; however , were deeper than those also displaying in situ signal ( median 3.0cm vs. 0.2cm ; p < 0.01 ) .

folate receptor - targeted otl38 accumulation within sccs of those sccs demonstrating fluorescence upon fr - imi , each demonstrated fralpha expression ( 1 + , 2 + or 3 +) upon immunostaining ( representative examples of 0 , 1 + , 2 + and 3 + staining provided in figure 3 ) .
three ( 33.3 %) fralpha - expressing tumors were found to have predominantly 1 + staining , 4 ( 44.4 %) had predominantly 2 + staining patterns , and 2 ( 22.2 %) had predominantly 3 + staining .
in each fralpha - positive specimen , heterogenous expression patterns were appreciated with each specimen displaying areas of 0 , 1 + , 2 + and 3 + staining. of note , fralpha - expression was absent in the three non - fluorescent sccs submitted for histopathologic review .

2 + and 3 + staining patterns were considered overexpression .
to better characterize patterns of otl38 accumulation within scc and confirm accumulation in fralpha - expressing tumors areas , all fluorescent scc underwent microscopic tumor mapping using a nir scanning system and molecular correlative analysis using a combination of h & e staining and fralpha immunohistochemistry ( representative analysis provided in figure 4 ) .
after noting tumor margins by of h & e and ihc , quantitative fluorescent analysis confirmed elevated mean fluorescence intensities within tumors as compared to normal benign pulmonary parenchyma ( versus 98.1 au vs 20.3 ; p < 0.001 ) ( figure 4 ) .
within tumors , we noted significant increases in fluorescent intensity in those areas with fralpha - overexpression ( 2 + or 3 + staining ) versus those areas with lower expression patterns ( 140.6 au vs 57.2 au ; p < 0.001 ) .

fr - imi improves localization of t1a squamous cell carcinomas after confirming fralpha - dependent accumulation of otl38 within scc , we reviewed how fr - imi impacted clinical care .
in 3 of 12 subjects , utilization of fr - imi impacted surgical care by allowing for intraoperative localization of t1a lesions ( measuring less than 2.0cm ) .
for example , subject 9 presented with a 18fdg - avid , 1.1cm right upper lobe nodule ( figure 5a , 5b ) .
this patient was taken to the operating room for a vats wedge resection .
during standard thoracoscopic localization ( white light and finger palpation ) , the nodule could not be localized through the pleural surface ( figure 5c ) .
however , after implementation of in situ nir molecular imaging , the nodule was readily identified ( figure 5d ) .
using the real - time fluorescent feedback , the lesion was successfully resected and adequate margins were confirmed by exoscopic fluorescent evaluation .
fluorescent results were confirmed by both frozen section and final pathologic evaluation .
without the addition of fr - imi , the operating surgeon would have otherwise converted from vats to thoracotomy to accomplish localization and resection .
similarly , in subject 5 and subject 12 the addition of fr - imi allowed for the resection of t1a nodules to continue in a minimally invasive fashion .
figure 5 representative example displaying fr - imi localization of a small sccs subject 9 presented with a metabolically active 1.1cm nodule of the right upper lobe as determined by preoperative ct ( a ) and pet ( b ) .
intraoperatively , the nodule could not be localized using standard visualization techniques ( c ) ; however , upon fr - imi that nodule highly visible ( d ) .
histopathologic and clinical variables predicting in - situ fluorescence of sscs during fr - imi to maximize utility of fr - imi for localization , in situ intraoperative fluorescence is paramount .
to determine which patient and tumor variables predict in situ signal upon fr - imi ; several clinical , radiographic and histopathologic variables were assessed : depth from pleural surface on preoperative ct , time from infusion to imaging , preoperative suv , tumor location , scc size , amount of drug given , subject age and final subject gender ( table 3 ). of the 9 tumors which accumulated otl38 , we determined that only depth from pleural surface impacted in situ fluorescence , with deeper nodules associated with less fluorescence ( p = 0.005 ) .
in fact , among the 12 subjects analyzed , only those with sccs within 1.2cm of the pleural surface displayed identifiable signal during in situ fr - imi .
other trends predicting increased in situ tbr included longer time to imaging , however , this did not reach significance ( p = 0.06 ) .
no other examined variable predicted in situ tumor fluorescence .

discussion more than 80,000 patients undergo resection for ncslc in the united states each year [ 1 ] .
localization of pulmonary nodules , particularly during minimally invasive pulmonary resection , can be challenging .
our group has previously demonstrated that fr - imi with otl38 can be a safe and reliable intraoperative adjunct to improve localization of pulmonary adenocarcinomas .
in this study , we expand upon our previous experiences , and demonstrate fr - imi with otl38 can also be a useful surgical adjunct for patients undergoing pulmonary resection of pulmonary sccs .
we demonstrate that otl38 accumulates in nearly 70 % of sccs by exhibiting fralpha - targeted mechanisms .
reproducible fluorescent signal during fr - imi improved intraoperative localization of small , subpleural nodules during minimally invasive resection .
otl38 was developed in efforts to incorporate advantages of several alternative imaging agents currently under phase i / ii evaluation .
more specifically , otl38 incorporates highly specific fralpha - targeted binding as previously observed with ec17 ( folate - fitc ) [ 18 ] .
unlike ec17 , folate is linked to s0456 ( a commercially available nir dye ) in otl38 [ 23 ] .
nir imaging agents offer several advantages over visual - range agents including minimal autofluorescence and improved depth of tissue penetration [ 17 ] .
given an abundance of data describing fralpha expression within 70 - 80 % of pulmonary adenocarcinomas [ 24 ] , we chose to initiate first - in - human studies using this histology as a study model .
in these early trials involving more than 70 patients ; fr - imi with otl38 was noted to be safe , highly sensitive in localizing small pulmonary adenocarcinomas ( as small as 2 - 3mm ) , and capable identifying occult malignancy in 12 % of subjects enrolled [ 3 , 13 ] .
in light of high reproducibility and excellent sensitivity of fr - imi within pulmonary adenocarcinomas , we chose to explore fr - imi with otl38 in the second most common nsclc histology , sccs .
sccs account for nearly 30 % of all lung cancers , and nearly 35 % of all nsclc histologies .
unlike pulmonary adenocarcinomas , previous data describing fralpha expression patterns in sccs was unclear and ranged from 10 % to nearly 60 % [ 20 , 21 ] .
in addition to inconsistent expression values , previous reports have been limited due to a small sample size , sampling error introduced by microarray analysis , and poor generalizability to surgical patients .
because of these limitations we sought to execute a feasibility study aimed at exploring fr - imi in patients with resectable pulmonary scc .
in this study , we were encouraged to that find 9 of 12 subjects successfully underwent fr - imi with otl38 .
in addition to reproducibility , we noted that fr - imi provided subcentimeter sensitivity and an effective adjunct to minimally invasive pulmonary resection .
upon fluorescent and correlative histopathologic assessment , we confirm that otl38 accumulation in sccs was indeed targeted to fralpha expressing areas within tumor .
in total , 69 % of sccs displayed fralpha expression .
we point out that higher rates of fralpha expression in our cohort as compared to previous studies may be explained by several factors , perhaps most notably involves our histologic evaluation approach which utilized whole sections as compared to tissue microarrays in previous studies .
furthermore , we observed significant intratumoral heterogeneity in fralpha expression as compared to our prior experiences involving pulmonary adenocarcinomas .
nevertheless , these results support our previous findings insomuch tumors display macroscopic fluorescence when as little as 10 % cells display the fralpha [ 3 , 13 , 25 ] .
these results provide an encouraging platform for future studies that can better clarify these trends in pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas .
similar to previous studies involving fr - imi and alternative nir optical contrast agents , we found significant limitations of with tumors deeper than 1.2cm .
this mirrors our experiences with pulmonary adenocarcinomas where in situ nodule localization was ineffective for lesions deeper than 2.0cm [ 3 , 13 ] .
at this time a number of additional techniques , such as photoacoustic imaging and nir - endoscopy , are in development .
these approaches have proven successful for metastatic melanoma [ 26 ] and head and neck malignancies [ 27 ] , respectively .
despite these limitations , molecular imaging offers several advantages over alternative localization approaches currently available .
first , from a purely logistical perspective , molecular imaging requires no additional procedures which contrasts with ct - guided percutaneous wire localization , fluoroscopy , fiducial marking , and tumor tattooing [ 28 ] .
in comparison , during fr - imi otl38 is delivered just hours prior to resection in the preoperative holding area .
secondly , fr - imi for lung cancer has demonstrated an excellent safety profile with only grade i toxicities noted [ 3 , 13 ] .
we note a good safety profile in this trial , with no adverse events being observed in this study cohort .
this provides important morbidity advantages over previously mentioned localization techniques [ 29 ] .
finally , systemic drug delivery involved in imi provides an opportunity for detection synchronous disease and lymph nodes evaluation as previously noted in our experiences with fr - imi in pulmonary adenocarcinomas and other groups investigating antibody - based approaches [ 3 , 30 ] .
despite limitations , we are optimistic about the role of fr - imi for patients with pulmonary sccs and view these results as a template for additional studies which can help better define how fr - imi can improve upon standard treatment approaches for nsclc patients .
more specifically , we are currently exploring fr - imi with otl38 as a tool to improve localization of ill - defined pulmonary ground - glass opacities ( nct02769156 ) .
in addition to this registration trial , we are embarking on a multi - center phase ii trial ( nct02872701 ) involving fr - imi otl38 which will mark the united states' first trial involving targeted imi .
these additional investigations will provide a better understanding of how fr - imi can impact care for patients undergoing minimally invasive pulmonary resection for nsclc .
materials and methods study design this clinical trial was approved by the university of pennsylvania 's institutional review board .
the primary objectives of this study were to determine if otl38 accumulates within sccs and to assess in vivo and ex vivo tumor fluorescence .
secondary objectives included the determination of fluorescent dependence on patient and tumor variables including fralpha expression .
twelve subjects provided informed consent and were enrolled between july 2015 and january 2017 .
sample size and study design were based on consensus guidelines provided by the world molecular imaging society [ 31 ] .
all subjects presented with solitary pulmonary nodules that were histologically confirmed to be sccs .
all identified subjects underwent preoperative high - resolution ct scanning which was reviewed by a thoracic radiologist to confirm the presence pulmonary nodule and identify other suspicious nodules .
each subject also underwent preoperative 18fdg - positron emission tomography ( pet ) .
for imaging studies obtained outside the university of pennsylvania health system ( uphs ) , at least one uphs thoracic radiologist reviewed preoperative imaging to confirm the presence of pulmonary nodules , rule - out synchronous disease , and confirm findings of 18fdg - positron emission tomography .
based on limitations in depth of penetration recognized in our prior experience with nir imaging , we selected subjects sccs within 4cm of the visceral pleural surface on preoperative imaging [ 13 ] .
a transparent reporting of evaluations with nonrandomized designs ( trend ) flow diagram with complete inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided ( supplementary figure 1 ) .
all subjects were scheduled for minimally invasive pulmonary resection ( video - assisted thoracic surgery - - vats ) .
in the preoperative holding area , study participants received 0.025 mg / kg of otl38 by intravenous infusion 3 - 6 hours prior to resection as previously described [ 13 ] .
during vats , surgeons first utilized standard thoracoscopic visualization ( white - light thoracoscopy ) and finger palpation to identify known tumors .
after identification of preoperatively identified nodules , molecular imaging was used to confirm lesion fluorescence .
if the preoperatively identified nodule was unidentifiable by white - light thoracoscopy or finger palpation , localization using fluorescence guidance was attempted .
if additional fluorescent lesions were identified , they were wedge resected .
all specimens were then imaged ex vivo prior to submitting for histopathologic examination by a pulmonary pathologist .
study drug otl38 ( c61h63n9na4o17s4 ; molecular weight : 1414.42 da ) is composed of a folate analogue conjugated to an nir fluorescent dye as previously described [ 3 ] .
otl38 maximally excites at a wavelength of 774 - 776 nm and has a peak emission of 794 - 796 nm [ 3 , 9 ] .
otl38 (> 96 % purity ) was obtained from on target laboratories ( west lafayette , in , usa ) .
all subjects received 0.025 mg / kg of intravenous otl38 through a peripheral vein 3 to 6 hours prior to resection .
otl38 dosage and time to imaging was based on previous human [ 3 , 9 ] and canine pharmacokinetic data [ 32 ] .
imaging device in situ , real - time fluorescent imaging was performed using an iridium ( r ) system optimized for detection of otl38 ( visionsense corp , philadelphia , pa ) as previously described [ 3 ] .
the iridium ( r ) is a high definition , dual band ( white light and nir ) camera system capable of emitting and detection light in the nir spectrum .
an excitation source with a wavelength of 785 nm was utilized , and fluorescence was detected using a bandpass filter selective to light ranging from 800 to 835 nm. during vats , the iridium ( r ) was equipped with a 5mm , 0 - degree thoracoscope .
during in situ imaging during vats , the distance was normalized using the iridium ( r )' s " distance lock " feature .
for ex vivo back table evaluation of specimens , a free - standing exoscope was utilized. by exoscopic evaluation , imaging was performed at a distance of 15 inches. of note , during both in situ and ex vivo imaging , the " autogain " function was utilized , and power was maintained at the default setting .
fluorescent and histopathologic assessment of specimen excised specimens were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded .
sequential 5mum sections were obtained and underwent comprehensive histopathologic and fluorescent analysis by a board - certified thoracic pathologist .
sections were stained using standard hematoxylin / eosin ( h & e ) staining .
immunohistochemical ( ihc ) staining for fralpha was performed using a monoclonal antibody , 26b3.f2 ( morphotek inc. , pa ) as previously described [ 13 ] .
once stained , a certified pulmonary pathologist manually scored specimen using an established scoring system ranging from 0 to 3 + as previously described [ 13 ] .
briefly , a score of 0 corresponded with absence of staining ; 1 + equaled faint staining on luminal borders ; 2 + equaled moderate staining on apical and sometimes lateral borders and 3 + indicated strong circumferential staining .
the tumor was considered positive when more than 10 % of malignant cells were positively stained .
lastly , in order to understand otl38 accumulation patterns at a microscopic level , an additional unstained 5mum section was evaluated using a nir microscopic scanner ( odyssey , licor , lincoln , ne ) .
statistical analysis post hoc image analysis was performed to quantify the amount of fluorescence using region of interest ( roi ) software within imagej ( free software program available through the national institute of health ; http :// rsb.info.nih.gov / ij ) .
a background fluorescence level was similarly obtained , and tumor - to - background ( tbr ) was calculated for all identified lesions .
a tbr was utilized to control for extrinsic variables including ambient operating room signal , natural fluorophores , and systemic patient variables .
data are presented as median ( iqr ) unless otherwise noted .
given the small sample size , differences between two groups were compared by the mann - whitney test .
given the exploratory nature of this study , multiple prediction models were made using linear regression to assess patient and histopathologic variables that related to tumor fluorescence .
all comparisons were made use stata statistical software : release 14 ( college station , tx : statacorp lp ) .
a p - value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant .

kabuki syndrome mll2 gene autoimmune thyroiditis vitiligo dear editor kabuki syndrome ( ks ) is a multiple congenital anomalies / intellectual disability syndrome characterized by developmental delay , specific facial features , skeletal and visceral abnormalities .
this syndrome is caused by mutations in mll2 and kdm6a gene .
autoimmune abnormalities such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , hemolytic anemia , thyroiditis , and vitiligo have been described very rarely in patients with ks ( 1,2,3 ) .
herein , we present a very rare condition , ks in association with autoimmune thyroiditis and vitiligo due to a de novo heterozygous p.r2471 * mutation in mll2 gene .
case report : a female patient aged 7 7 / 12 years presented with short stature .
there was no consanguinity between her parents .
she was born as a term neonate weighing 2100 g as the product of a twin pregnancy and had no perinatal complications .
on physical examination , the patient was noted to have large and low - set ears , broad and arched eyebrows , elongated palpebral fissures with eversion of the lateral third of the lower eyelid , as well as high and narrow palate .
she also had other phenotypic malformations such as numerous vitiligo lesions of different sizes in the neck , brachydactyly , prominent fetal finger pads , and hyperlaxity in her joints .
her height was 116.3 cm ( - 1.85 standard deviation score [ sds ]) and weight was 21.7 kg ( - 0.78 sds ) .
she had sensorineural hearing loss ( left 65 db , right 55 db ) and moderate mental retardation ( stanford - binet intelligence scale total score was 43 ) .
she had a normal female karyotype ( 46,xx ) .
a clinical diagnosis of ks was considered .
additionally , laboratory findings revealed autoimmune thyroiditis [ thyroid - stimulating hormone ( tsh ) : 242 miu / l ( reference range : 0.55 - 6.7 ) and free thyroxine ( ft4 ) was 0.42 ng / dl ( reference range : 0.91 - 1.92 ) , anti - microsomal antibody : 450.6 u / ml ( reference range : 0 - 9 ) , anti - thyroglobulin antibody : 2766 u / ml ( reference range : 0 - 4 )] .
thyroid ultrasonography demonstrated a rough pattern , consistent with thyroiditis .
levothyroxine ( 50 microg / day ) replacement therapy induced a euthyroid state ( tsh : 3.65 miu / l and ft4 : 1.15 ng / dl ) .
the main causes of ks are point mutations with large intragenic deletions and duplications of the histone methyl transferase mll2 gene ( 1,4,5 ) .
we detected a de novo heterozygous p.r2471 * ( c.7411c > t ) mutation in this patient .
no mutations were detected in mll2 gene in her parents and her brother .
this mutation causes an early stop codon and a truncated protein .
it severely affects the protein structure .
to our knowledge , this mutation was not reported in ks patients to date .
as this is a truncating mutation , it is most probably a disease causing mutation .
in several patients , ks was reported to be associated with autoimmune abnormalities such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , hemolytic anemia , thyroiditis , and vitiligo ( 3,5 ) .
the autoimmune disorders may be manifestations of abnormal immune regulation .
ming et al ( 3 ) conclude that ks is associated with an increased incidence of autoimmune disorders .
in our patient , the vitiligo lesions in the neck and thyroiditis were considered to be signs revealing an autoimmune condition .
we recommend that all ks patients be investigated for possible coexistence of autoimmune disorders .

in pulmonary tuberculosis ( tb ) , the inflammatory immune response against mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb ) is associated with tissue destruction and cavitation , which drives disease transmission , chronic lung disease , and mortality .
matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp ) - 1 is a host enzyme critical for the development of cavitation .
mmp expression has been shown to be epigenetically regulated in other inflammatory diseases , but the importance of such mechanisms in mtb - associated induction of mmp - 1 is unknown .
we investigated the role of changes in histone acetylation in mtb - induced mmp expression using inhibitors of histone deacetylases ( hdacs ) and histone acetyltransferases ( hat ) , hdac sirna , promoter - reporter constructs , and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays .
mtb infection decreased class i hdac gene expression by over 50 % in primary human monocyte - derived macrophages but not in normal human bronchial epithelial cells ( nhbes ) .
non - selective inhibition of hdac activity decreased mmp - 1 / - 3 expression by mtb - stimulated macrophages and nhbes , while class i hdac inhibition increased mmp - 1 secretion by mtb - stimulated nhbes .
mmp - 3 expression , but not mmp - 1 , was downregulated by sirna silencing of hdac1 .
inhibition of hat activity also significantly decreased mmp - 1 / - 3 secretion by mtb - infected macrophages .
the mmp - 1 promoter region between - 2,001 and - 2,942 base pairs from the transcriptional start site was key in control of mtb - driven mmp - 1 gene expression .
histone h3 and h4 acetylation and rna pol ii binding in the mmp - 1 promoter region were increased in stimulated nhbes .
in summary , epigenetic modification of histone acetylation via hdac and hat activity has a key regulatory role in mtb - dependent gene expression and secretion of mmp - 1 and - 3 , enzymes which drive human immunopathology .
manipulation of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms may have potential as a host - directed therapy to improve outcomes in the era of rising tb drug resistance .
mycobacterium tuberculosis matrix metalloproteinases histone deacetylases histone acetyltransferases epigenetics wellcome trust10.13039 / 100004440fundacao para a ciencia e a tecnologia10.13039 / 501100001871rosetrees trust10.13039 / 501100000833 introduction tuberculosis ( tb ) remains a major global health problem , with 10.4 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths per year ( 1 ) .
the rapid emergence of widespread drug resistance necessitates new strategies to improve the efficacy of treatment in tb , both to decrease transmission and to improve patient outcomes .
ideally , such therapies will shorten the duration of therapy , which is currently a minimum of 6 months and may be years in drug - resistant disease .
host - directed therapies are increasingly of interest in tb ( 2 ) .
the primary site of mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb ) infection is the lung , and pulmonary disease is characterized by granulomatous inflammation with destruction of lung parenchyma .
the outcome of infection is very variable between hosts , and the factors determining this are not well understood , although host genetics and innate immune responses are important determinants of disease ( 3 , 4 ) .
matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) are zinc - dependent endopeptidases , which have key roles in tissue repair and in diseases characterized by inflammatory tissue destruction such as emphysema ( 5 ) .
mmps are key mediators of inflammatory cell migration , and modulators of chemokine and cytokine signaling ( 6 , 7 ) .
mmp activity is strongly implicated in the immunopathogenesis of tb. our group and others demonstrated the involvement of mmp - 1 , the major human collagenase , and its activator mmp - 3 ( stromelysin - 1 ) in driving pathology in pulmonary tb ( 8 - 10 ) .
mmps are secreted by mtb - infected monocytes and macrophages , and also by uninfected stromal cells stimulated via intercellular networks ( 11 ) .
epigenetic mechanisms are emerging as major regulators of mmp activity in non - infectious diseases ( 12 , 13 ) , including chronic lung diseases such as asthma and copd ( 14 ) , but their role in mmp expression in tb is less established .
epigenetic regulation encompasses all chromosomal modifications that alter gene expression without altering the nucleotide sequence of coding dna ( 15 , 16 ) .
eukaryotic dna is packaged as chromatin around octamers of histone proteins , which contain globular domains and negatively charged tails .
these are subject to extensive post - translational modification , including acetylation of highly conserved lysine residues .
acetylation of histones h3 and h4 , carried out by histone acetyltransferases ( hats ) , is associated with increased gene transcription ( 17 ) .
conversely , acetyl groups are removed by the histone deacetylases ( hdacs ) , which are divided into four classes .
the class i hdacs ( 1 , 2 , 3 , and 8 ) are ubiquitously expressed , whereas class ii hdacs ( such as hdac 4 and 5 ) are selectively expressed in different tissues .
hdac activity is usually associated with silencing of gene expression ( 18 , 19 ) .
however , this is not uniformly the case and opposite regulation may occur .
for example , hdac inhibition reduced mmp - 9 gene expression in cancer cell lines resulting in a less invasive phenotype ( 20 ) .
the epigenetic mechanisms regulating inflammatory immune responses in tb are an emerging field .
altered mirna expression in serum and sputum from tb patients compared to controls has been shown , and potential biomarkers for diagnosis have been identified ( 21 ) .
a growing body of evidence exists to support the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in other respiratory infections , for example , altered dna methylation patterns in asthma patients versus healthy controls have been implicated in the pathogenesis of rhinovirus infection ( 22 ) .
similarly , altered dna ( cytosine - 5 - ) - methyltransferase - 1 ( dmt - 1 ) expression in nasal epithelial cells from smokers was identified as a possible mechanism of increased susceptibility to influenza ( 23 ) .
in vitro studies of airway epithelial cells demonstrated increased hdac2 expression and decreased histone acetylation in respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) - infected cells , while chemical hdac inhibition restricted rsv replication ( 24 ) .
in the current study , we have investigated whether epigenetic modifications , specifically histone acetylation / deacetylation , regulated the characteristic tb - associated expression of mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 by monocyte - derived macrophages and normal human bronchial epithelial cells ( nhbes ) , thereby augmenting tb immunopathology .
the role of histone acetylation in induction of mmp - 1 / - 3 expression was specifically investigated , since this dynamic epigenetic mark is associated with transcriptional activation .
we demonstrate that mtb infection alters macrophage class i hdac expression and that mmp - 1 expression induced by mtb is sensitive to hdac / hat inhibition .
in addition , increased histone acetylation was seen at mmp - 1 and - 3 promoter regions compared with unstimulated cells , specifically in the region - 2,001 to - 2,942 bp of the mmp - 1 promoter , which contains key inducible sites activated in mtb - stimulated cells .

for comparison of three or more groups , one - way anova was used with tukey 's correction for multiple comparisons .
unless otherwise stated in figure legends , graphs show mean values for triplicate samples and error bars are the sd. results class i hdacs are suppressed by mtb infection of macrophages experiments were designed to investigate epigenetic regulation of tb immunopathology , first investigating whether mtb infection of macrophages altered class i hdac expression .
expression of class i hdacs was repressed by mtb infection , with a 68 % decrease in hdac1 , 69 % in hdac2 , 76 % in hdac3 , and 58 % in hdac8 compared with uninfected controls ( all p < 0.05 ) ( figures 1a - d ) .
next , we examined monocyte network - dependent stimulation of nhbes by comtb .
in contrast to macrophage stimulation by mtb , comtb stimulation of nhbes did not significantly alter accumulation of any class i hdac mrnas ( figures 1e - h ) .
expression of class ii hdacs 4 and 5 was also examined by rt - pcr .
hdac4 mrna accumulation was increased by 48 % in mtb - infected macrophages , while no difference was observed for hdac5 ( figures 1i,j ) .
increase in hdac4 protein level was confirmed by western blot ( figure s1 in supplementary material ) .
class ii hdac expression in comtb - stimulated nhbes was similar to control conditions ( figures 1k,l ) .
thus , exposure to live mtb selectively suppressed macrophage class i hdac expression .
figure 1 class i histone deacetylase ( hdac ) expression is downregulated in mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb ) - infected macrophages .
macrophages were infected with h37rv at a multiplicity of infection of 1 , while normal human bronchial epithelial cells ( nhbes ) were stimulated with comtb ( 1:5 dilution ) , for 24 h before total rna was extracted for class i hdac gene expression analysis .
figures show mrna levels ( au ) for : ( a,e ) hdac1 , ( b,f ) hdac2 , ( c,g ) hdac3 , ( d,h ) hdac8 for macrophages and nhbes , respectively .

non - selective hdac inhibition reduces mmp - 1 and - 3 expression in macrophages and nhbes during mtb infection next , we investigated whether histone acetylation status affected mmp expression using the non - selective hdac inhibitor ( hdaci ) tsa .
a total of 100 ng / ml tsa markedly decreased mtb - stimulated mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 secretion by macrophages ( figures 2a,b ) .
in nhbes , tsa significantly decreased baseline mmp - 1 secretion by over 50 % ( p < 0.05 ; figure 2c ) .
comtb - stimulated mmp - 1 secretion was decreased by tsa treatment , although this did not reach statistical significance ( figure 2c ) .
in contrast , comtb - stimulated mmp - 3 secretion was significantly reduced in a dose - dependent manner by 25 % with 1 ng / ml tsa ( from 2.4 to 1.8 ng / ml ) and by 72 % with 10 ng / ml tsa ( 685 pg / ml ) ( figure 2d ) .
figure 2 mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb ) - driven matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp ) - 1 and - 3 secretion is suppressed by histone deacetylase ( hdac ) inhibition .
macrophages and normal human bronchial epithelial cells ( nhbes ) were preincubated with 1 - 100 ng / ml trichostatin a ( tsa ) ( a - d ) , 0.1 - 5 microm cbha ( e - h ) or 1 - 10 microm ms - 275 ( i - l ) to inhibit hdac activity , prior to infection with h37rv ( multiplicity of infection 1 ) or stimulation with comtb ( 1:5 dilution ) for 72 h , then mmp - 1 and - 3 secretion was measured .
pretreatment with tsa suppressed : ( a ) mmp - 1 and ( b ) mmp - 3 secretion from mtb - infected macrophages .
in comtb - stimulated nhbes ( c ) , mmp - 1 secretion was unaltered and ( d ) mmp - 3 secretion decreased with tsa treatment .
pretreatment with cbha suppressed : ( e ) mmp - 1 and ( f ) mmp - 3 secretion from mtb - infected macrophages and ( g ) mmp - 1 and ( h ) mmp - 3 secretion from comtb - stimulated nhbes .
the class i selective hdaci ms - 275 suppressed : ( i ) mmp - 1 and ( j ) mmp - 3 secretion from mtb - infected macrophages , while it increased ( k ) mmp - 1 secretion and decreased ( l ) mmp - 3 secretion from comtb - stimulated nhbes .
secretion of mmp - 7 was not affected by ( m ) tsa and ( n ) 1 microm ms - 275 treatment in mtb - infected macrophages .
bars represent mean +/ - sd and analysis was performed using one - way anova with tukey 's posttest .
* p < 0.05 ; ** p < 0.01 ; **** p < 0.0001 .
cbha , m - carboxycinnamic acid bis - hydroxamide .
further experiments were performed using an alternative chemical hdaci , cbha ( m - carboxycinnamic acid bis - hydroxamide ) , to confirm that the observed effects were due to hdac inhibition and not non - specific .
pretreatment of macrophages with 4 microm cbha before mtb infection decreased mmp - 1 secretion by 77 % ( from 8.89 to 2.05 ng / ml ) and mmp - 3 secretion to undetectable levels ( figures 2e,f ) .
comtb - driven mmp - 1 secretion was reduced by cbha treatment in a dose - dependent manner .
5 microm cbha reduced mmp - 1 secretion by 41 % ( from 797 to 473 pg / ml ; p < 0.05 ; figure 2g ) , while 1 microm cbha was sufficient to completely inhibit comtb - induced mmp - 3 secretion ( p < 0.0001 ; figure 2h ) .
these results indicate that hdacs may differ between cell types , each with specific mmp regulatory pathways .
the hdac class i - selective inhibitor ms - 275 ( 1 microm ) inhibited mtb - driven macrophage mmp - 1 secretion by 92 % and reduced mmp - 3 concentrations by 94.4 % ( figures 2i,j ) .
this supports the earlier finding and implies a key regulatory role for class i hdacs in macrophages mmp - 1 / - 3 expression .
in contrast , ms - 275 enhanced mmp - 1 secretion by both unstimulated ( p < 0.05 ) and comtb - stimulated nhbes ( p < 0.0001 ; figure 2k ) .
ms - 275 at a low concentration of 1 microm increased mmp - 3 secretion 4.6 - fold compared to comtb alone ( p < 0.05 ) , but this was not observed at the higher concentration of 10 microm ms - 275 ( figure 2l ) , possibly due to sublethal cell toxicity , which could not be detected by cell viability experiments .
the effects of these hdaci on mmp secretion were selective , since neither tsa nor 1 microm ms - 275 significantly altered mmp - 7 secretion by mtb - infected macrophages ( figures 2m,n ) .
silencing hdac1 expression does not affect comtb - driven mmp - 1 expression next , we investigated whether a specific class i hdac enzyme was necessary for comtb - induced mmp - 1 and - 3 expression .
hdac1 mrna was reduced by more than 80 % in comtb - stimulated cells transfected with 30 nm hdac1 sirna compared to non - targeting ( nt ) sirna or untransfected controls ( figure 3a ; p = 0.001 ) .
despite efficient hdac1 silencing , no significant differences were observed in mmp - 1 mrna accumulation ( figure 3b ) .
consistent with this , mmp - 1 concentrations were 3,204 pg / ml in comtb / hdac1 sirna treated samples compared to 3,746 pg / ml in the comtb / nt sirna samples ( figure 3c ) .
mmp - 3 mrna was upregulated threefold by comtb stimulation but no difference was observed between nt and hdac1 sirna - transfected nhbes ( figure 3d ) .
mmp - 3 protein secretion in the nt - transfected cells was upregulated by comtb ( p < 0.001 ) , and mmp - 3 secretion was reduced by 30 % in hdac1 sirna - transfected cells compared to nt - transfected conditions ( p < 0.01 ; figure 3e ) .
silencing of hdac2 in epithelial cells with sirna ( figure 3f ) was also effective and increased comtb - stimulated mmp - 1 , but not mmp - 3 , mrna expression compared to comtb alone ( p < 0.05 ; figures 3g,h ) .
silencing hdac3 with sirna did not affect mmp - 1 or mmp - 3 expression ( figures s2a - c in supplementary material ) .
figure 3 silencing of hdac1 and hdac2 expression does not inhibit comtb - driven matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp ) - 1 gene expression .
normal human bronchial epithelial cells ( nhbes ) were transfected with 30 nm non - targeting ( nt ) , hdac1 - or hdac2 - specific sirna , or treated with transfection reagent alone .
cells were then stimulated with comtb ( 1:5 ) for 24 or 48 h .

macrophage - derived mmp - 1 and - 3 gene expression and secretion during mtb infection are blocked by hat inhibition next , the role of hat activity was investigated using the inhibitor hati ii .
10 microm hati ii significantly decreased mmp - 1 secretion from mtb - infected macrophages by 56 % ( from 5,029 to 2,187 pg / ml ) and mrna accumulation by 62 % ( figures 4a,b ) .
mmp - 3 secretion was decreased from 1,653 to 190 pg / ml ( p < 0.0001 , figure 4c ) .
there was a non - significant trend to decreased mmp - 3 mrna accumulation with hati ii treatment ( figure 4d ) .
hati ii treatment did not affect mmp - 7 secretion in response to mtb infection ( figure s3 in supplementary material ) .
figure 4 hati ii inhibits mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb ) - driven matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp ) - 1 and - 3 secretion .
macrophages were preincubated with 10 microm hati ii or 1 - 10 microm aa prior to infection with h37rv ( multiplicity of infection 1 ) .
total rna was extracted after 24 h and cell culture supernatants were collected after 72 h. pre - treatment with the hati ii suppressed : ( a ) mmp - 1 secretion and ( b ) mmp - 1 mrna accumulation , as well as ( c ) mmp - 3 secretion and ( d ) mmp - 3 mrna accumulation .

a second hat inhibitor , aa ( 10 microm ) , reduced mtb - infected macrophage mmp - 1 secretion by 74 % ( from 5,029 to 1,302 pg / ml ; p < 0.0001 ) ( figure 4e ) .
similarly , a significant decrease in mmp - 1 secretion was also detected in stimulated nhbe cells pretreated with aa ( figure s4 in supplementary material ) .
secretion of mmp - 3 in mtb - infected macrophages was also inhibited by 10 microm aa ( p < 0.01 ; figure 4f ) .
the aa compound is closely related to salicylic acid and has been reported to have some antimicrobial activity , including against mtb ( 26 , 27 ) .
we therefore investigated whether these results might be secondary to an effect on mtb growth , but this was not altered in broth cultures containing aa at concentrations between 2 and 25 microm ( figure 4g ) .
these experiments support the hypothesis that hat activity is required for inducible expression of mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 in macrophages and nhbes stimulated with mtb .
mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 promoter - reporter analysis in tb plasmid promoter - reporter constructs of the mmp - 1 and mmp - 3 promoter regions were transfected into a549 respiratory epithelial cells to investigate the effect of mtb - stimulation on promoter activity .
a schematic representation of the relevant region of the human mmp - 1 promoter region is shown in figure 5a .
comtb treatment increased promoter activity of the wt construct by more than threefold compared to controls ( p = 0.02 ; figure 5b ) .
comtb - mediated promoter activation was significantly enhanced by 98 and 71 % in the 3,830 and 2,942 bp constructs , respectively , compared to comtb - stimulated wt ( p < 0.01 ) .
further truncation of the promoter resulted in loss of comtb - driven promoter activity .
the mmp - 3 promoter , examined using similar methodology , showed a progressive reduction in both basal and comtb - stimulated promoter activity with truncation of the construct from 1,612 to 642 bp in length ( figure 5c ) compared to wt. the 1,612 bp truncation is missing a stromelysin platelet - derived growth factor responsive element ( spre ; - 1,659 to - 1,643 bp ) and part of the stromelysin il - 1 responsive element ( - 1,614 to - 1,595 bp ) , and in addition , the 642 bp truncation is missing 4 ap - 1 , 2 stat3 , and 1 c - rel binding sites .

comtb - driven mmp - 1 expression and increased histone acetylation in the promoter region to further investigate whether epigenetic modifications of the mmp - 1 promoter controlled the response to comtb , we examined the histone acetylation status of the mmp - 1 promoter region by chromatin immunoprecipitation .
preliminary experiments using the respiratory epithelial a549 cell line suggested marked increases in histone h4 acetylation with comtb treatment at 1 and 2 h poststimulus ( data not shown ) .
in primary nhbes , rna polymerase ii binding to the mmp - 1 promoter was increased between 10 - and 15 - fold in cells after 2 h of comtb treatment ( figure 6a ) .
histone h3 acetylation was increased 2 h poststimulation and was approximately threefold greater than under control conditions in the proximal promoter , and fivefold higher than control when measured 2 kbp upstream of the mmp - 1 transcriptional start site ( figure 6b ) .
detection of acetylated histone h4 after 2 h of comtb stimulation was also increased across the mmp - 1 promoter region .
histone h4 acetylation was 10 - fold higher at - 2 kbp and - 500 bp , and 6 - fold higher than unstimulated controls at the transcriptional start site ( figure 6c ) .
figure 6 mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb ) - driven matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp ) - 1 expression is associated with increased rna pol ii binding and increased histone h3 and h4 acetylation of the mmp - 1 promoter .
chip assays were performed on normal human bronchial epithelial cells treated with comtb ( black triangles ) or control medium ( gray circles ) for 1 h ( dashed line ) or 2 h ( solid line ) poststimulation .
( a ) rna pol ii , ( b ) acetylated histone h3 , and ( c ) acetylated histone h4 association with the mmp - 1 promoter increases after 2 h comtb stimulation , particularly between - 2,000 to - 1,000 bp from the transcriptional start site .

previous studies from our group and other have demonstrated that mtb - stimulation upregulates mmp - 1 expression , which is enzymatically active and able to degrade type i collagen , the main component of the lung 's ecm [ al ( 10 , 28 , 29 )] .
expression of other mmps is also induced in pulmonary tb ( 28 , 30 ) , and mmps are implicated in central nervous system immunopathology ( 31 , 32 ) .
in this study , we demonstrated that expression of mmp - 1 and - 3 in response to mtb is controlled by epigenetic changes in histone acetylation .
hdacs are canonically considered to be negative regulators of gene expression , and we showed a change in the profile of hdac expression following mtb infection of macrophages .
downregulation of class i hdac gene expression was observed with a concomitant and selective upregulation of hdac4 but not hdac5 .
in contrast , in respiratory epithelial cells , class i and class ii hdac expression were unchanged after comtb stimulation , implying that this is a cell type - specific effect .
tlr signaling is known to induce changes in hdac expression and activity ( 33 ) , and our findings are consistent with published evidence of selective changes in macrophage hdac expression in response to specific inflammatory stimuli ( 34 ) .
our data show that mtb infection of macrophages induces a change in the cellular hdac profile .
we went on to investigate the likely effects of this change by performing experiments in which mmp responses were examined under conditions of both general and specific hdac blockade .
non - selective hdac inhibition using tsa and the bipolar hybrid cbha suppressed mtb - driven mmp - 1 and - 3 secretion and mrna accumulation in primary epithelial cells and macrophages .
such a paradoxical effect on mmp expression has been previously reported in an in vitro model of arthritis , where chondrocyte collagenase activity was inhibited by tsa ( 35 ) .
in a mouse model of arthritis , tsa also inhibited mmp - 1 , - 3 , and - 13 expression ( 36 ) .
similarly , lps - induced mmp expression by murine bone marrow - derived macrophages was inhibited by tsa ( 37 ) .
the class i selective hdaci ms - 275 had contrasting effects : increasing basal and comtb - stimulated mmp - 1 and - 3 secretion in epithelial cells , while in mtb - infected macrophages , it decreased mmp - 1 / - 3 secretion .
similar inhibition of cytokine - induced mmp - 1 was seen in ms - 275 treated human chondrocytes ( 38 ) .
the effects of ms - 275 may be due to selective inhibition of hdac1 at lower concentrations , and additional effects on the activity of hdac2 and 3 at higher concentrations ( 39 ) .
individual hdac enzymes are likely to play different roles in regulation of mmp expression , and since these chemicals affect function of multiple hdacs , it is impossible to dissect the relative contribution of each hdac by a chemical inhibition approach alone .
the increased secretion of mmp - 1 and - 3 from nhbes observed with class i hdac inhibition , as compared to non - selective hdac inhibition , is consistent with the premise that class i hdacs are key negative regulators of mmp expression .
hdac1 was shown to be recruited to the mmp - 9 promoter site , reducing histone h3 acetylation and nf - kappab recruitment , leading to repression of mmp - 9 expression in fibrosarcoma cells ( 40 ) .
the enhancement of comtb - stimulated mmp expression observed with ms - 275 led us to hypothesize that silencing the expression of hdac1 might similarly increase inducible mmp expression .
the catalytic activity of hdac 1 and 2 is reliant on their incorporation as heterodimers into multiprotein assemblies ( 41 ) and therefore we expected that silencing either hdac 1 or hdac 2 would affect mmp expression .
however , in spite of a high efficiency of hdac1 silencing , mmp - 1 expression was unaffected , and mmp - 3 secretion was decreased in hdac1 - silenced cells .
in contrast , upregulation of mmp - 1 in comtb - stimulated conditions was further enhanced with hdac2 inhibition , suggesting that ms - 275 could be having its effect via inhibition of hdac2 rather than hdac1 .
the differing results for hdac1 and hdac2 silencing are unexpected given the close homology between these proteins , and consequently further dissection of their relative contributions to control of mmp expression is needed .
in other experimental systems , different hdacs have been implicated in mmp regulation and there may be cell and stimulus specificity in host responses .
in synovial fibroblasts from arthritis patients , hdac1 sirna enhanced tnfalpha - induced mmp - 1 expression ( 42 ) , whereas hdac4 was identified as a negative regulator of mmp - 1 expression ( 43 ) .
consistent with the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications regulate mmp secretion in tb , expression of mmp - 1 and - 3 were both suppressed by hat inhibition with hati ii. experiments using a structurally unrelated hat inhibitor , aa , generated consistent data .
similarly , in human dermal fibroblasts exposed to uv light , aa inhibited mmp - 1 expression , as did sirna silencing of p300 expression .
increased hat activity and histone h3 acetylation and decreased hdac activity preceded changes in mmp - 1 gene expression ( 44 ) .
the finding that both hat and hdac inhibition decreased mmp - 1 and - 3 expression , while apparently contradictory , may reflect the complex interdependence of these processes .
it is well recognized that many non - histone substrates of these enzymes exist ( 45 , 46 ) and indeed phylogenetic studies have indicated that bacterial hdac homologs pre - date the existence of histones ( 47 ) .
lysine acetylation of many non - histone proteins has been shown to be enhanced by hdac inhibition , for example , with ms - 275 ( 46 ) .
many transcription factors contain such lysine acetylation sites , including camp response element - binding protein ( creb ) , whose activity is increased in the presence of tsa ( 48 ) .
creb can be acetylated at three sites , enhancing its transcription factor activity , and hdac8 is known to act on the creb acetylation sites ( 49 ) .
the nf - kappab family of transcription factors is also subject to posttranslational modification including acetylation as well as phosphorylation ( 50 ) .
myocyte enhancer factor - 2 is deacetylated by hdac3 , which also acts on the hats pcaf and p300 / cbp ( 51 ) .
in addition to transcription factors and hats , the hdacs themselves contain lysine acetylation sites , as do a number of structural and regulatory proteins ( 52 ) .
therefore , it is difficult to dissect out the relative contribution of inhibition of histone acetylation / deacetylation compared to effects on these other substrates when considering the effects of chemical inhibitors , and our findings indicate a complex interplay of signaling pathways occurs during infection .
the promoter - reporter analysis showed that inhibitory elements located 4,372 - 2,942 bp upstream from the mmp - 1 transcriptional start site decrease promoter activation , since deletion of this region enhanced comtb - driven promoter activity .
the area between - 2,942 and - 2,001 bp contains several critical elements required for the induction of gene expression , including a putative nf - kappab binding site .
there is also an ap - 1 site at - 1,950 bp just proximal to the - 2,001 bp truncation that might be functionally disrupted by this truncation .
there is substantial evidence that mmp - 1 expression is regulated by both nf - kappab and ap - 1 family transcription factors ( 8 , 53 , 54 ) , and our data support a central role .
similarly , multiple transcription binding sites may be important in mmp - 3 promoter function .
our chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that comtb stimulation leads to increased h3 and h4 acetylation at the mmp - 1 promoter region .
histone acetylation was an early event after comtb stimulation occurring concurrently with binding of rna pol ii to the mmp - 1 promoter .
in summary , mmp - 1 and 3 expression in tb is regulated by hdac and hat activity .
mmp - 1 upregulation , as a result of epigenetic control , has the potential to drive tissue damage in the lung , thereby facilitating spread of infection and development of pathology .
chemical inhibition suggests that hdac and hat activity is necessary for inducible expression of mmp - 1 and - 3 in mtb - infected macrophages , but that different mechanisms operate in nhbes , where class i hdacs appear to act as a brake on collagenase expression .
this is a selective effect , as mmp - 7 , which is constitutively expressed in mdms and upregulated by mtb infection , was unaffected by hdac and hat inhibition .
the minimal inhibition of mmp responses seen with sirna targeting individual class i hdacs implies that there may be some redundancy of function .
increased histone acetylation in the mmp - 1 promoter region follows mtb stimulation , favoring rna pol ii binding , and results in upregulation of mmp gene transcription and enzyme secretion .
tissue breakdown mediated by mmp activity is a key event in tb immunopathology and manipulation of host epigenetic changes have potential applications as host - directed therapy in the era of rising drug resistance in tb. author contributions jf conceived the project .

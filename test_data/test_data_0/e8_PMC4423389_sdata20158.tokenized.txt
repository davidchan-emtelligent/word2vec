global environmental change has influenced lake surface temperatures , a key driver of ecosystem structure and function .
recent studies have suggested significant warming of water temperatures in individual lakes across many different regions around the world .
however , the spatial and temporal coherence associated with the magnitude of these trends remains unclear .
thus , a global data set of water temperature is required to understand and synthesize global , long - term trends in surface water temperatures of inland bodies of water .
we assembled a database of summer lake surface temperatures for 291 lakes collected in situ and / or by satellites for the period 1985 - 2009 .
in addition , corresponding climatic drivers ( air temperatures , solar radiation , and cloud cover ) and geomorphometric characteristics ( latitude , longitude , elevation , lake surface area , maximum depth , mean depth , and volume ) that influence lake surface temperatures were compiled for each lake .
this unique dataset offers an invaluable baseline perspective on global - scale lake thermal conditions as environmental change continues .
subject terms climate - change ecology limnology climate change background & summary freshwater ecosystems are vulnerable to the effects of global environmental change1 .
lakes are sentinels of climate change2 and are an effective indicator of a limnological response to global climate change , as they integrate climatic and landscape factors3 .
lake surface temperatures can directly or indirectly influence physical , chemical , and biological processes in a lake , including the temperature of the photosynthetic zone4 , water - column stability , lake primary productivity5 , fish species range shifts3 , and species interactions6 .
climatic factors , including air temperature , cloud cover , and solar radiation , in addition to geomorphometric factors , such as lake surface area and depth , influence surface water temperatures in lakes7,8 .
here , we present a database of 25 - year ( 1985 - 2009 ) lake surface water temperatures from 291 lakes around the world , collected by either in situ , satellites , or both , and some of the main corresponding climatic and geomorphometric factors that are relevant to lake surface water temperatures. between 1986 and 2005 , global air temperatures have increased by 0.61 degreesc ( ref. 9 ) .
water temperatures have increased over recent decades coinciding with changing air temperatures , with a few exceptions .
generally , water temperatures tend to coincide with regional air temperatures , warming or cooling at similar rates to that of air temperatures10,11 .
however , there are some regions , such as around the great lakes region of north america and northern europe , in which bodies of water are warming more rapidly than ambient air11,12 .
solar radiation is a key component of lake heat budgets13 .
increases in the amount of incoming solar radiation increase average lake temperatures14 .
cloud cover can reduce incident solar radiation , but also result in greater longwave ( atmospheric ) radiation15 .
thus , the influence of cloud cover on lake temperatures can be bidirectional and complex .
lake - specific properties , including depth , surface area , and volume can mediate the effects of these climate drivers and influence lake temperatures13 .
for example , surface water temperatures have been found to be inversely correlated with mean depth8,16 .
in general , shallower lakes tend to warm more rapidly with higher surface water temperatures compared to deep lakes that have greater heat storage capacities8 .
however , at broad spatial scales , climatic factors have a larger influence on surface water temperatures than lake morphology17 .
the motivation to assemble a global database of lake surface water temperatures , climatic forcing variables , and geomorphometric characteristics was to address two key scientific issues by the global lake temperature collaboration ( www.laketemperature.org ) : i ) what are the global and regional patterns of water temperature changes over the past 25 years and are they coherent over spatial and temporal scales ? ; and ii ) which climatic forcing variables and geomorphometric factors are most important in driving changes in water temperature , i.e. , do similar lake types exhibit similar rates of warming or cooling globally ?
this novel dataset can be used to address additional research questions including those pertaining to understanding the mechanistic drivers of surface water temperature warming and ecological consequences of changes in lake temperatures .
methods in situ water temperatures in situ data we compiled in situ surface water temperatures and corresponding lake geomorphology and climatic data from 151 lakes ( figure 1 ; tables 1 and 2 ; data citation 1 ) .

satellite surface water temperatures we compiled satellite - derived surface water temperatures from 154 lakes ( figure 1 ) .
the methodology used for obtaining satellite - based lake surface temperatures largely follows the approach described in schneider and hook11 .
only lakes that exhibited at least a 10x10 km area of pure water surface without any islands or shorelines were selected , in order to make sure that there was no contamination by land surfaces .
we used data from two series of satellite instruments in order to maximize the sampling frequency and thus to provide more accurate estimates of the average lake surface temperature for each july , august , and september ( jas )/ january , february , and march ( jfm ) period .
these were the advanced very high resolution radiometer ( avhrr ) series and the along track scanning radiometer ( atsr - 1 , atsr - 2 , advanced atsr ) series .
the avhrr series of satellite instruments has been measuring thermal infrared ( tir ) radiation since the late 1970 s. for this study , we used data from the version 5 product of avhrr pathfinder collection59 .
this is a joint nasa / noaa global reprocessing of the avhrr data archive that provides twice daily temperatures of large inland water bodies worldwide at a spatial resolution of approximately 4 km. avhrr pathfinder data between 1985 and 2009 were used .
we extracted a single pixel for every site and every day from the manually selected coordinates over each lake that maximized the distance from any shoreline and any islands .
this avoided any possible bias due to contamination from mixed pixels containing both land and water .
we only used night time data in this study .
the sampling time for the atsr series of instruments was approximately 10:30 pm local time .
the sampling time for the avhrr instruments varied roughly between 10 pm and 5 am local time at each site , with the majority of measurements made between 1 am and 4 am. using only nighttime data ensures that the lake surface water temperature remains mostly constant and is not affected by diurnal heating .
in addition , we performed cloud masking so that any pixels that were acquired at zenith angles of greater than 45 degrees were discarded .
the avhrr pathfinder product has been rigorously validated in the past against in situ radiometer data over open oceans60,61 and against buoy observations over inland water bodies11 .
secondly , we used tir data from the series of along - track scanning radiometers ( atsr ) .
atsr - 1 began acquiring data in 1991 , and was followed by atsr - 2 which was launched in 1995 , and by the advanced along - track scanning radiometer ( aatsr ) launched in 2002 .
atsr - 1 , atsr - 2 and aatsr stopped acquiring useful data in 1996 , 2003 , and 2012 , respectively .
the atsrs are multi - channel imaging radiometers with the primary purpose of providing highly accurate sea surface temperature data worldwide .
the instruments provide a nominal pixel size of 1 km2 at the centre of nadir and about 1.5x2.0 km at the centre of the forward swath .
at the coordinates selected for each site , we extracted a 3x3 pixel array of thermal infrared data for each nighttime overpass .
we eliminated cloudy pixels from the time series of top - of - atmosphere brightness temperatures using a subset of the cloud tests provided with the atsr product and complemented by a spatial homogeneity test that excluded any arrays where the standard deviation of the 3x3 pixel array was greater than 0.5 degreesc .
we used the satellite data to calculate bulk water temperatures from skin temperatures using sensor - specific correction factors derived from the laurentian great lakes11 .
we computed water skin temperature from the brightness temperatures using the dual - view operational split - window coefficients provided for atsr62 .
atsr data has also been extensively validated over the oceans and over the lake tahoe ( ca / nv ) validation site operated by the jet propulsion laboratory63 .
we compiled time series from both series of satellite instruments independently at all 141 sites , with avhrr data available for the period 1985 - 2009 and atsr data available for the period 1991 - 2009 .
we then merged the cloud - free observations from both series of instruments into a single dataset to maximize the sampling frequency .
this allows for more accurate estimates of the 3 - month summer means .
geomorphometric characteristics we collected latitude , longitude , elevation , surface area , volume , mean depth , and maximum depth for each lake , if available ( table 1 ) .
although these values are presented as static , we note that these variables could have varied during the 1985 - 2009 period , especially for reservoir systems .
whenever possible , metadata for each lake were obtained from the original data provider .
for many of the lakes sampled using satellite imagery , very little morphometric information was readily available .
in these cases , we conducted searches in the primary literature , online web sources ( ilec ( http :// www.ilec.or.jp / en /) , iaglr ( http :// www.iaglr.org /) , lakenet ( http :// www.worldlakes.org /) , wikipedia ( http :// en.wikipedia.org / wiki / main _ page )) , google earth , or contacted colleagues in the relevant countries to obtain information .
air temperatures we obtained mean , minimum , maximum , and diurnal temperature range ( defined as the difference between daytime maximum and nighttime minimum temperatures ) for summer , winter , and annual air temperature data for each lake from two separate sources : the climatic research unit ( cru ) at the university of east anglia , united kingdom and the national centers for environmental prediction ( ncep ) .
we obtained the cru data from version 3.21 of their dataset using 0.5 - degree resolution grid cells64 .
these data are monthly gridded files calculated from observations .
lake values were the mean of all months within the appropriate time period to match the sampling period ( e.g. , july - august - september for northern hemisphere summer , january - february - march for northern hemisphere winter ) , see section g below ) for a given year for the single grid cell that contained the sampling location for the lake .
exceptions included large bodies of water , such as lake superior and the caspian sea , which included an average of the grid cells that surrounded these lakes ( because we used a land - based air temperature dataset , grid cells that were over only water did not have data ) .
the air temperature data we obtained from ncep represent version 2 of the ncep reanalysis data65 .
we retrieved air temperature data at a height of 2 m for each lake using the rncep package , a user - friendly package for use in the r programming language66 .
air temperatures for the ncep reanalysis data are projected onto a global t62 gaussian grid of 192 equally spaced points in longitude and 94 unequally spaced points in latitude65 .
for lakes smaller than one cell on the t62 grid , we extracted data for the cell containing the latitude and longitude representing the approximate center of the lake .
for lakes larger than one cell size on the grid , we aggregated all cells within a geometric square representing the surface area of the lake .
finally , we aggregated these data into summer means using the rncep.aggregate function66 .
solar , longwave and total radiation summer and winter surface solar ( i.e. , shortwave ) and longwave radiation data are a satellite product taken from the nasa / global energy and water cycle experiment ( gewex ) surface radiation budget ( srb ) radiation dataset , version 3.0 ( obtained from the nasa langley research center atmospheric science data center ) .
the data are generated on the basis of the international satellite cloud climatology project ( isccp ) dx radiance and cloud parameters67 , using an updated version of the university of maryland 's shortwave flux algorithm and an adaptation of the longwave algorithm .
the dataset has a spatial resolution of 1degreesx 1degrees and temporal resolution of 3 h. in addition to the srb incoming shortwave radiation ( sw ) and longwave radiation ( lw ) , we also provide estimates of the total incoming radiation ( r tot = 0.93 * sw + 0.97 * lw ) that is absorbed by a dark , water surface under ice - free conditions ( i.e. , an assumed shortwave albedo of 7 % and longwave emissivity of 0.97 ) .
the srb radiation data have been shown to be one of the best global radiation datasets and exhibit smaller biases than reanalysis data and other satellite products .
for example , gui et al .
68 assessed srb solar radiation data using ground measurements collected at 36 globally distributed sites from 2000 - 2002 .
results indicate that the downwelling solar irradiance shows good overall agreement with ground measurements , except for a few large biases in southeast asia ( sukothai , bukit , and kogma ) .
these biases range from - 90.2 w m - 2 ( - 22 %) at sukothai to + 45.8 w m - 2 (+ 12.8 %) at bukit when comparing srb solar radiation data with ground observations .
overall , however , the srb data show a lower mean bias across 36 global sites ( - 5.5 w m - 2 ; - 1.9 %) ( ref. 68 ) .
markovic et al .
69 also evaluated the srb dataset at six surface radiation sites from the united states surface radiation ( surfrad ) network and found good agreement with the srb data across the annual cycle .
cloud cover instrumentation measuring global cloud cover was rarely continuous during the full observational period of this study ( 1985 - 2009 ) .
the noaa 5 - channel advanced very high resolution radiometer ( avhrr ) cloud imagery record began in 1981 , and cloud statistics derived using pathfinder atmosphere 's extended ( patmos - x ) processing system are available with global coverage70 .
to calculate seasonal means for this study we used temporally interpolated values representing 13:30 local time for cloud amount ( fractional cloud cover ) from a 1degrees re - gridded version of this dataset71 .
we calculated mean cloud cover ( 0 - 1 ) during the summer and winter periods using the average of these daytime values for 1985 - 2009 .
summer mean surface water temperature calculations we calculated summer mean temperatures for a 3 - month period .
generally , for lakes situated in the northern hemisphere we used the period of 1 july - - 30 september ( jas ) ; whereas , in the southern hemisphere , we used 1 january - - 31 march ( jfm ) .
exceptions were latitudes less than 23.5degrees , for which the jas metric was used south of the equator and the jfm metric was used north of the equator .
this was done in order to avoid the cloudy wet season in the tropics and instead collect data during the dry season , which allows for an increased number of cloud - free satellite observations11 .
we use the term ' summer ' throughout to refer to these time periods ( jas or jfm ) depending upon location of the lake .
the only exception to this time period was the in situ data for toolik lake , alaska , for which we used june - august because of the lack of data available for september due to the early onset of winter at this high latitude .
the term ' winter ' refers to the 3 - month period opposite ' summer ' in the calendar year .
in situ mean calculations assuming sampling for a given year preceded ( or started on ) the first interpolation date and extended past ( or ended on ) the last interpolation date , we used linear interpolation to create a daily value for all dates between the beginning and end of the interpolation period ( inclusive ) .
the summer mean was calculated by finding the mean of all of these daily values beginning on the first day of july and ending on the last day of september ( for northern hemisphere lakes ) .
we also calculated gap lengths , which were the intervals in days between sequential sampling times .
gaps were calculated only for the sampling points that existed within the seasonal bounds .
we defined the maximum gap as the maximum of all gaps for a single year .
the mean gap was the mean of all gaps for a single year .
if sampling did not extend to or beyond the start and end dates of the interpolation period , we used a curve - fitting extrapolation routine ( see below ) .
extrapolation of observations for shortened sampling periods where necessary , we used a curve - fitting extrapolation technique to extend daily in situ observations to the bounds of the summer mean period .
more specifically , we used temperature estimates from lake - specific curves to populate daily values for the missing part of the interpolation period .
to generate the curve , we pooled all temperature values ( for a given depth and given lake ) according to day - of - year ( doy ) , and fit a curve of the type ' temperature = a * doy ^ 2 + b * doy + c ' .
this equation yielded a generic representation of the seasonal pattern in the data .
for years that did not have data that covered the full interpolation period , we used the curve fit to extrapolate values preceding the first sample point ( if applicable ) or beyond the last sample point ( if applicable ) , or in some cases , both .
the curve was adjusted along the y ( temperature ) axis by modifying the value of c in the equation to intersect the first sample point ( if missing data appeared during the early portion of the interpolation period ) or last sample point ( if there were missing data in the latter part of the interpolation period ) , and daily values were taken from the equation for the portion ( s ) missing from the record .
when this routine was used , we made a notation in the log file describing if extrapolation was used for the beginning and / or end period and we included the equation of the curve ( see data records ) .
satellite mean calculations as the satellite observations generally are not distributed evenly throughout each 3 - month period , we used a robust locally weighted regression smoothing ( lowess ) approach72 on a year - by - year basis for each time series .
this technique provides a continuous temperature estimate and is robust against outliers in the observations helping to avoid sampling bias in the calculation of the 3 - month mean .
we computed a separate lowess fit for the temperature curve of each calendar year and at each inland water body .
we subsequently computed the mean temperature of a 3 - month period over all 92 daily values obtained from the fitted lowess curve .
an average temperature was only computed if at least 20 valid cloud - free satellite retrievals were available in a given 3 - month period , to ensure that the observations adequately characterize the temperature curve .
data records the data are available in two comma delimited text files ( data citation 1 ) .
the first , gltclakeinformation.csv , contains information for each lake , who collected the data , lake location and surroundings .
the second table ( table 2 ) , gltcvalues.csv , contains the actual values and may be linked to the lake information via the siteid column .
a zip folder of processing log files is included , called gltc _ means _ processing _ log _ files.zip .
this folder contains text files that explain any extrapolation performed as part of the summer mean calculations , including the parabolic equation used for the extrapolation , the time period covered , and the r2 fit to the data .
data used in this study have not previously been published , however , methods of collection and manipulation for harmonization are described in detail for each lake above and in the metadata .
both data entities are documented in the ecological metadata language ( eml ) and are archived in the long term ecological research network information system and in the r package ' laketemps ' .
both data and metadata can be accessed at http :// portal.lternet.edu / , https :// www.dataone.org / and in the r package ' laketemps ' .
technical validation quality control and assurance of in situ data in order to efficiently assemble a complete product from the disparate data sources used for this dataset , we composed a set of scripts in the r programming language73 .
after the assembly of the dataset was complete , we examined the distribution of mean lake temperatures using a series of histograms and maps .
the histograms allowed us to identify outliers while the maps provided geographic plots that could be examined for unusual observations or spatial patterns that might indicate technical errors during the assembly of the dataset .
to maximize our chances of identifying erroneous values , the histograms and maps were examined by all co - authors .
to ensure that the geomorphometric data in the completed dataset were accurate we had several individuals independently check the values against reputable sources .
the final step taken to assure the quality of our assembled dataset was to share the derived mean summer temperatures and geomorphometric data with the original data providers .
we sent an email to each of the data providers containing the relevant data for their lake ( s ) along with a request to validate the values that we have included in the completed dataset .
this final step was probably the most important as it allowed us to get feedback from the individuals that are most familiar with the lakes in our dataset .
whenever there were inconsistencies in data , we worked directly with the original data provider to resolve the issue and update the data accordingly .
assessment of sampling gap impacts on temperature trends as described in section g above , we used interpolation to calculate daily temperatures within the summer window for each lake with in situ data .
the mean summer surface temperature for each lake was then calculated by taking the mean of those daily estimates .
while this approach allowed us to standardize the methodology used for calculating mean summer temperatures across our lakes , we were concerned that mean temperatures calculated for lakes with longer sampling intervals ( e.g. , one temperature measurement each week ) would have more error than lakes with shorter sampling intervals ( e.g. , daily temperature measurements ) .
our rationale for this concern was that linear interpolation can produce an underestimate of mean summer surface temperatures when few data points are available , and the temperature trajectory is parabolic ( figure 3 ) .
in order to estimate the amount of error attributable to differences in sampling interval , we designed bootstrap simulations in the r programming language .
for these simulations , we used temperature records from six sites on four lakes that had daily temperature data available ( figure 3 ) .
for each site , we constructed simulated temperature datasets consisting of a subset of the daily temperature observations .
we used sampling intervals ranging from once per day to once every 34 days and constructed 20000 simulated datasets for each sampling interval .
the date of the first sample for each of the 20000 datasets was chosen as a random date in june and then the following samples were equally spaced in time starting from that date .
therefore , variation among the simulated datasets for each sampling interval was driven by random variation in the choice of the initial sampling date .
we then used linear interpolation to calculate daily temperatures for july , august , and september .
the mean of these daily temperatures represented the annual mean summer temperature .
we treated the mean annual summer temperature calculated with a sampling interval of 1 ( daily measurements ) as the ' true ' mean temperature .
for all of the other sampling intervals we calculated the difference between the true mean and the mean calculated with interpolation .
the difference was calculated by year for each simulated dataset .
we then took the average error for the 20,000 simulated datasets for each sampling interval and plotted the results .
in this manner , we were able to construct a relationship between sampling interval and error in our temperature estimates ( figure 4 ) .
our results demonstrated that although errors in our temperature estimates did increase at large sampling intervals , they were relatively modest , even at a sampling interval of once every 34 days ( - 0.25 to - 0.4 degreesc ; figure 3 ) .
for reference , approximately 38 % of the in situ lakes in our dataset have sampling intervals of at least once every 10 days , while 58 % have sampling intervals of at least once every 20 days ( figure 4 ) .
only 13 % have sampling intervals >= once every 30 days ( figure 5 ) .
validation of satellite data with in situ measurements we validated the satellite data with the in situ data by conducting four analyses .
first , we compared summertime mean values for the 11 lakes that had both satellite and in situ data ( biwa , baikal , erie , garda , geneva , huron , michigan , peipsi , superior , tahoe , taihu ) .
second , we compared interannual anomalies .
the rmse between satellite and in situ measurements for the 11 long - term summer mean lake surface temperatures was 1.15 degreesc .
differences between the two mean values are assumed to be the result of different sampling times ( often day versus night ) , different sampling frequencies , measurement errors , and differences between skin and bulk water temperatures .
when we compared interannual anomalies ( average deviations from the 1985 - 2009 mean ) , the rmse declined to 0.72 degreesc .
third , we compared trends from the in situ data for 1985 - 2009 .
trends that we calculated from temporally - matched satellite and in situ summer means for the 11 lakes had an rmse difference of 0.03 degreesc per year .
fourth , on a small subset of the data , schneider and hook11 used high - frequency buoy measurements to conduct a more direct comparison of water temperature trends that eliminated differences in timing and observation frequency .
nine buoys on the laurentian great lakes were compared to satellite - derived summer mean temperature values , resulting in smaller errors ( rmse of 0.43 degreesc ) and negligible biases for satellite estimates .
schneider and hook11 also applied two additional methods to summer means from these nine sites to confirm that these biases did not negatively affect the computed trends : firstly a direct validation of satellite - derived trends against corresponding trends obtained for in situ observations at buoys was carried out and the results indicated a good correspondence with an rmse of 0.013 degreesc per year .
secondly , a linear regression analysis of time series of annual biases revealed no significant trend , indicating that satellite calibration drift did not adversely affect trends obtained from the data .

figure 2 histogram of temporal data coverage of summer mean water temperatures for sites within the gltc dataset .
figure 3 linear interpolation was used to calculate daily temperature estimates for july , august , and september for each in situ sampled lake .
the mean summer temperature for each lake was then calculated by taking the mean of those daily estimates .
the figure shows interpolation conducted with temperature measurements conducted at an interval of once every 10 days ( panel a ) , once every 20 days ( panel b ) , or once every 30 days ( panel c ) .
at high sampling intervals ( panel c ) , linear interpolation can underestimate daily temperatures , leading to an underestimate of the mean summer temperature .
figure 4 the relationship between sampling interval and error in our mean summer temperature estimates for in situ sampled lakes .
a sampling interval of 1 indicates that temperature measurements were collected daily , while an interval of 34 indicates one temperature measurement every 34 days .
temperature measurements collected with a sampling interval of 1 were considered to have no error and served as a basis for comparison with data collected at higher sampling intervals .

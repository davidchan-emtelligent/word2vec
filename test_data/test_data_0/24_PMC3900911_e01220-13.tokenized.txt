despite efficient control programs , large clonal outbreaks of tuberculosis ( tb ) may arise in low - risk populations .
recently , an unusual tb outbreak was reported in uruguay , reaching an elevated disease attack rate ( 53 to 69 %) .
here , we report the genome sequence of the mycobacterium tuberculosis strain associated with this rapidly progressing outbreak , named mturu - 001 .
cover - datejanuary / february 2014access - typefree genome announcement recently , we reported an unusual tuberculosis ( tb ) outbreak centered on a professional basketball team in montevideo , uruguay , a country with a low tb incidence ( 1 ) .
in august 2008 , a young male member of the basketball team was diagnosed with tb , and a chest x - ray indicated a bilateral pulmonary form with cavities .
tb was bacteriologically confirmed 20 days later and the patient was cured after first - line treatment .
as described in coitinho et al .
( 1 ) , following this index case , six other team members who lived at the same place for a week and four other contacts were successively diagnosed with tb over the next 2.5 years .
all patients ( ranging between 17 and 23 years of age ) were immunocompetent , athletic , and wealthy .
no other comorbidity factors were detected .
despite control programs , large clonal tb outbreaks can develop even in low - incidence countries , reflecting ongoing disease transmission ( 2 , 3 ) .
the mycobacterium tuberculosis strain showed an elevated disease attack rate ( 53 to 69 %) that sharply contrasts with the lifetime risk of developing active tb , being estimated at < 10 % among infected individuals in the general population .
we report here the draft genome sequence of the tb isolate from the index case .
sequencing was performed at the institut pasteur de montevideo on an illumina genome analyzer iix platform and generated 2,379,897 paired - end reads ( 2 x 100 cycles ) .
the resulting library was first corrected using allpaths - lg ( 4 ) and then assembled with velvet ( 5 ) software , producing 195 contigs with an average coverage of 84 - fold .
the assembly quality was improved using the pagit toolkit ( 6 ) , based on the genome sequence of m. tuberculosis h37rv ( genbank accession no. nc _ 000962 ) as a reference strain .
the final assembly quality was evaluated with the assembly likelihood estimator ( ale ) software ( 7 ) , and the assembly was automatically annotated with rast ( 8 ). m. tuberculosis mturu - 001 has a circular chromosome of 4,378,296 bp , with an average g + c content of 65 % , including 4,314 protein - encoding genes , 1 rrna operon , and 45 trna genes .
in comparison with m. tuberculosis h37rv , 4,096 orthologous groups were defined with orthomcl ( 9 ) and 1,016 polymorphisms were identified using the burrows - wheeler aligner ( bwa ) ( 10 ) and gatk ( 11 ) .
a subset of 849 polymorphisms ( 802 single - nucleotide polymorphisms [ snps ] and 47 indels ) were inside coding sequences , and 480 affect protein sequences , especially 24 that introduced stop codons disrupting several hypothetical proteins , one transcriptional regulator , 2 genes for the haloacid dehalogenase ( had ) superfamily , and 3 involved in lipid metabolism .
further comparative genomics across this genome may provide genotype - phenotype associations that might explain the rapid progression of this unusual outbreak .

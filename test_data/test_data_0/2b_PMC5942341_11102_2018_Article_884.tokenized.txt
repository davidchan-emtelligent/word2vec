objective in rare disease research , most randomized prospective clinical trials can only use limited number of patients and are comprised of highly heterogeneous populations .
therefore , it is crucial to report the results in such a manner that it allows for comparison of treatment effectiveness and biochemical control between studies .
the aim of this review was to investigate the current methods that are being applied to measure and report growth hormone ( gh ) and insulin - like growth factor - 1 ( igf - 1 ) as markers for drug effectiveness in clinical acromegaly research .
search strategy a systematic search of recent prospective and retrospective studies , published between 2012 and 2017 , that studied the effects of somatostatin analogues or dopamine agonists in acromegaly patients was performed .
the markers of interest were gh , igf - 1 , and the suppression of gh after an oral glucose tolerance test ( ogtt ) .
additionally , the use of pharmacokinetic ( pk ) measurements in these studies was analyzed .
the sampling design , cut - off for biochemical control , reported units , and used summary statistics were summarized .
results a total of 49 articles were selected out of the 263 screened abstracts .
igf - 1 concentrations were measured in all 49 studies , gh in 45 studies , and an ogtt was performed in 11 studies .
a wide range of different cut - off values and sampling designs were used to determine biochemical control in acromegaly patients .
the summary statistics were reported in various ways , with the percentage of biochemical control most frequently used .
nine studies sampled the pk at one or more time points .
non - compartmental analyses were commonly performed on the available pk data .
conclusions the way gh and igf - 1 are measured and reported in acromegaly research varies considerably .
a consensus on how to report study results would enable better comparisons between studies , thereby improving evidence based decision making to optimize treatment in acromegaly .

keywords acromegaly growth hormone pituitary adenoma igf - 1 - - review issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer science + business media , llc , part of springer nature 2018 introduction acromegaly is a rare disease ( prevalence of 60 - 70 per million [ 1 ]) characterized by growth hormone ( gh ) hypersecretion that results in the abnormal growth of extremities , high morbidity , and an increased mortality risk .
in virtually all cases , acromegaly is the result of a gh secreting pituitary adenoma [ 2 - 4 ] .
under normal physiological conditions , gh is secreted in discrete bursts that result in a pulsatile plasma gh concentration - time profile .
gh secretion is mainly upregulated by growth hormone - releasing hormone ( ghrh ) , gh - releasing peptide ( ghrp , e.g. ghrelin ) , and inhibited by somatostatin .
binding of gh to gh - receptors located in the liver induces insulin - like growth factor - 1 ( igf - i ) synthesis and secretion into the circulation .
negative feedback on gh secretion is mediated by igf - 1 and by gh itself [ 5 ] .
major negative determinants of gh secretion are aging and adiposity , while on the other hand aromatizable sex steroids amplify gh secretion [ 6 , 7 ] .
guideline recommendations both the gh and igf - 1 plasma concentrations are typically increased in active acromegaly and will decrease during effective treatment .
both biomarkers are therefore used in clinical practice to monitor biochemical control in acromegaly and to determine treatment effectiveness .
as a result of the biological mechanisms underlying acromegaly , the most recent guidelines , by the endocrine society and the american association of clinical endocrinologists ( aace ) , for the diagnosis and treatment monitoring in acromegaly focus on three key biomarkers ; ( a ) igf - 1 , ( b ) ( mean ) gh and ( c ) level of suppression of gh concentrations during an oral glucose tolerance test ( ogtt ) , further referred to in this article as the biomarkers of interest [ 8 , 9 ] .
insulin - like growth factor - 1 in clinical practice , a main treatment goal is a reduction in igf - 1 concentrations to the clinically accepted ' normal ' values for age and sex , which has been associated with improved / normalized mortality .
in the guidelines , the upper limit of normal ( uln ) was introduced as a surrogate for ' safe ' igf - 1 levels which can be used to monitor the biochemical control of an individual acromegaly patient .
this uln is commonly defined by 2 x the standard deviation ( sd ) of normal values , for age and sex , where age related changes have the largest impact on igf - 1 concentrations [ 10 , 11 ] .
additionally , uln corrected values have the added benefit that it can be used as a comparable measure of igf - 1 concentrations between individuals .
growth hormone the primarily pathologically affected hormone in acromegaly is gh. a random gh measurement is therefore performed to provide an indication of the actual endogenous 24 h gh profile .
however , the use of random gh levels , or the mean of multiple samples , to monitor treatment effectiveness has many challenges ( e.g. highly pulsatile profile of gh , assay variability , lack of a safe range ) but requires minimal clinical effort to obtain , compared to a full 24 h gh profile with short sampling intervals which is not feasible in clinical practice .
therefore , igf - 1 is generally considered as a better and more stable biomarker .
the 2014 endocrine society guideline suggests the use of a random gh measurement ( cut - off < 1 ng / ml ) , with only a low level of evidence for determining biochemical control [ 8 ] .
due to the challenges associated with random gh concentrations , the guidelines reports that these values should be handled with caution [ 8 , 9 ] .
for example , we have recently demonstrated that a single random gh measurement underestimates the actual level of gh secretion in patients treated with somatostatin analogues [ 12 ] .
oral glucose tolerance test an ogtt is performed as a test to differentiate between healthy individuals and patients with active acromegaly .
furthermore , an ogtt can be performed already 1 week after surgery to assess successful reduction of gh secretion [ 13 ] .
in healthy individuals , the increase in plasma glucose levels suppresses gh secretion to well below 1 ng / ml [ 9 ] .
insufficient suppression of gh is indicative for disruption in the regulation of the hypothalamus - pituitary - somatotropic axis .
a ' standard ' ogtt is performed using 75 g of orally administered glucose and the monitoring of blood samples for gh concentrations every 30 min for 2 h. at present , the recommended cut - off used both for biochemical control , and the diagnosis of acromegaly , is a nadir gh of < 1 ng / ml [ 8 ] , which has been re - adapted in 2014 from a previously more sensitive cut - off value of 0.4 ng / ml [ 9 ] .
however , the quantification of gh concentrations in these lower regions is highly dependent on the used analytical assay .
study comparison there are limited prospective clinical trials that included large cohorts of acromegaly patients , due to the low prevalence of acromegaly .
therefore , systematic reviews and meta - analyses serve as a powerful tool to combine study results , thereby increasing statistical power [ 14 ] .
for correct comparison of studies , the cut - off values used to determine biochemical control , and thereby the quantification of a response rate of a drug , should preferably be equal .
as a complicating factor , the assays used to analyze serum gh and igf - 1 samples are heterogeneous and have been previously identified as important factors of influence [ 15 ] .
different international recombinant reference preparations have been used for the analysis of both hormones , which lead to discrepancies in the concentrations of the reported biomarkers between studies [ 15 ] .
additionally , the proposed cut - off values reported in the guidelines are not assay specific which results in a bias in the interpretation of the proportion of patients with biochemical control between studies [ 15 ] .
pharmacokinetics to establish the effectiveness of drug treatment in general , the investigated drug must reach the site of action , e.g. the pituitary for somatostatin analogues and dopamine agonists [ 16 ] .
sufficient circulating plasma / serum drug concentrations should be reached and maintained in order to drive the desired drug effect at the level of the pituitary .
these concentrations should be within the drug - specific therapeutic window in order to trigger an effect .
commonly , to assess the responsiveness of a patient to octreotide , which is a somatostatin analog , a suppression test is performed with a single dose .
however , this test does not take into account the circulating plasma / serum concentrations that are reached and is perhaps not the most reliable predictor of drug effectiveness [ 17 ] .
information on the pharmacokinetic ( pk ) profile of an individual patient can give additional information on the level of inter - individual variability in response to a certain dose .
this , in combination with the somatostatin subtype receptor expression of the target tissue could inform endocrinologists on the optimal treatment of patients [ 18 ] .
aim the aim of this review is to summarize the methods that are being applied to measure and report gh and igf - 1 in studies that evaluated medical treatment efficacy in acromegaly patients in peer - reviewed journals , published between 2012 and 2017 .
it is assumed that this selection provides a good representation of the current state of the reporting of biomarkers , following the recommended cut - off values proposed in the 2011 guideline [ 9 ] .
in addition , we made an overview of studies measuring the pk of the drugs of interest and the performed pk analysis .
consequently , this will provide a perspective on the consistencies in the used methodology and reporting of studies in acromegaly research and therewith in the comparability of study results .
methods in - and exclusion criteria prospective and retrospective clinical studies , that included a minimum of five acromegaly patients treated with the standard of treatment of somatostatin analogues ( octreotide , lanreotide or pasireotide ) or dopamine agonists ( bromocriptine , cabergoline ) , and investigated the effect of treatment on one or more biomarkers of interest were included .
studies solely investigating the effect of gh receptor antagonists were excluded , except when a gh receptor antagonist was studied as a separate cohort or in combination therapy with a somatostatin analog or dopamine agonist .
review articles , case studies , in vitro experiments and experiments in non - human species were excluded .
search strategies identification of relevant studies was done using the medline database accessed through pubmed .
electronic search was performed on october 18th 2017 .
studies which were indexed between january 2012 and october 2017 , up until the search date , were included in this review .
all included studies were therefore published after the release of the 2011 guideline [ 9 ] .
sensitive search in pubmed was done using the search terms # 1 to # 5 presented below , where compoundname was replaced by the expanded names of bromocriptine , cabergoline , octreotide , lanreotide and pasireotide .
the full search term can be found in the online resource 1 .
search results were extracted from pubmed in plain text format .

for selected studies , full text articles were studied and checked against the in - and exclusion criteria .
for all included full text articles , study characteristics were summarized in a data extraction form .
this form consisted of general study characteristics , information on the study design , the used biomarkers , analytical assay , and the reported summary statistics .
an overview of all variables documented in this data extraction form can be found in online resource 2 .
results a total of 49 studies fulfilled all in - and exclusion criteria ( fig. 1 ) .
the selected articles cover a wide range of study designs , from randomized phase i clinical trials to post - marketing approval retrospective database analyses .
the majority of articles reported on prospective trials ( 63 %) .
in total , the studies report on data of more than 6400 patients .
the median number of subjects that completed a study was 58 , with a 25 - 75 % interquartile range [ iqr ] from 27 to 107 .
one article included a large number of patients : 2572 patients from the united kingdom that were included in a retrospective database analysis [ 19 ] .
the patient populations in the studies were diverse , varying from treatment naive to long term somatostatin treatment after surgery .
an extensive overview of the used study designs and the patient populations per study has been included in online resource 3. fig. 1 flow diagram of included studies and main reasons for exclusion .
n total number , n subset of total , ogtt oral glucose tolerance test , gh growth hormone , igf - 1 insulin - like growth factor 1 , pk pharmacokinetics the igf - 1 concentrations were measured in all 49 studies ( table 1 ) , gh was measured in 45 studies ( table 2 ) , and an ogtt was performed in 11 studies ( table 3 ) .
the tables present a summary of the reporting of the sampling design , used cut - offs , used summary statistics and the frequency of reporting the analytical assay for each biomarker .
approximately 92 % of the studies reported both the igf - 1 and the gh response in the population .
one article was excluded from the summary tables due to the reporting of a population pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic ( pk / pd ) model instead of focusing on the biochemical control in the population , which will therefore be reported in the " pharmacokinetics " section [ 20 ] .
only nine studies measured and reported the pk of the drug of interest ( table 4 ) .

igf - 1 was reported as uln corrected levels in 60 % , and in concentration units ( ng / ml ) in 44 % of the studies .
the reporting of both uln corrected levels and igf - 1 concentrations also occurred .
the uln corrected cut - off used to assess individual biochemical control , ranged from < 1.0x uln to < 1.5x uln .
the used summary statistics to report the igf - 1 concentrations ranged from individual profiles , geometric means with confidence intervals , % change from baseline , to time of nadir igf - 1 concentrations .
the % biochemical control , individual uln corrected levels and mean +/ - sd were most commonly used .
a total of 22 other ways of reporting the igf - 1 concentrations were identified and 83 % of the studies reported the used igf - 1 assay .
growth hormone a wide variability was observed in the sampling schedule used to measure gh , ranging from 1 random sample to the mean of 8 - 10 samples taken with 1 h intervals .
a total of 10 studies used a random 1 point sample whereas 14 studies did not report the number and the timing of samples taken .
the most commonly used gh cut - offs were < 1 ng / ml and < 2.5 ng / ml , used in 36 and 70 % of studies respectively , indicating that multiple cut - offs were reported in an individual study .
in the 44 studies reporting gh results , 25 different ways were used to report the gh summary statistics , with the % biochemical control , individual concentrations and mean +/ - sd as most prevalent outcomes .
a total of 34 out of 45 studies reported the used gh assay .
oral glucose tolerance test four studies reported the execution of an ogtt in their methods section but did not report any results , these studies were therefore excluded from the summary table [ 19 , 34 , 35 , 47 ] .
in the majority of the included studies , the used methodology for an ogtt was not reported ( 8 out of 11 ) .
for the studies that did report the methodology , different sampling schedules were used , although all did use a glucose loading of 75 g. the interpretation of the outcomes of the ogtt varied between studies , with cut - offs for gh ranging from 0.4 ng / ml to 1 microg / dl. the majority of studies ( n = 6 ) did not use the ogtt results in determining the biochemical control of a patient and only reported summary statistics or individual gh concentrations .
the used gh assay was reported in 7 out of 11 studies .
pharmacokinetics a total of 9 studies took samples for pk analysis of the drug of interest .
the data were analyzed using a non - compartmental analysis in all but one article that applied a population pk / pd model [ 20 ] .
due to the wide range in the number of samples taken in each study , different ways of reporting were used .
most commonly , the graphical analysis was presented as mean +/ - standard error ( se ) over time .
the correlation of an individual 's pk with their response on gh or igf - 1 , was only reported in 2 studies .
discussion this review clearly demonstrates that many methods are applied to measure and report on biomarkers in acromegaly research .
to improve comparability of results between studies and the determination of optimal treatment in acromegaly , protocols should be more uniform on the biochemical reporting .
however , different cut - off values and summary statistics are commonly applied to determine when a patient qualifies as being biochemically controlled , limiting the possibility to include the study results in a meta - analysis .
insulin - like growth factor - 1 to assess if igf - 1 concentrations decrease to ' safe ' ranges after treatment , the use of uln corrected levels should be used as a surrogate for treatment effectiveness .
additionally , the influence of age and sex on igf - 1 concentrations needs to be corrected for to enable comparison within a population and between studies .
unless the study population characteristics are similar ( small age range , same sex ) the reporting of igf - 1 concentrations that are not adjusted for by age and sex adds limited value .
however , we observed that 40 % of the studies reported igf - 1 concentrations that were not adjusted by the uln , precluding reliable comparisons of biochemical control between studies .
the healthy population that is used as reference to determine normal igf - 1 concentrations over age and sex may also play a role , however it is hypothesized that differences in large reference populations are small .
also , many of the studies ( 46 %) did not clearly report the number of samples taken to measure the igf - 1 concentrations .
however , since the serum igf - 1 concentration is assumed to be relatively stable during the day , this will most likely have a limited effect on the outcome [ 68 ] .
the response to drug treatment can also be judged on whether the igf - 1 reduction is consistent on multiple occasions during treatment , to assess the day - to - day variability .
this approach , using longitudinal igf - 1 data , would require validation compared to the use of a single igf - 1 sample which are being measured at a fixed time period after the start of treatment .
the variability in cut - offs that are currently used to determine biochemical control was also identified by stalla et al .
[ 69 ] .
they identified that 32 % of the respondents of an online survey from 45 countries apply a cut - off of 1.3x uln and 18 % use a cut - off of 1.5x uln .
the results of this study are in line with the used cut - off values identified in this review , with 13 % of the studies accepting uln corrected igf - 1 levels to be < 1.2x uln , whereas one study used a cut - off of 1.5x uln .
the high proportion of studies ( 85 %) reporting biochemical control can only be used for the comparison between studies , if identical criteria to assess biochemical control are used .
however , a total of seven different cut - offs to determine biochemical control were used .
the impact of the approach to determine biochemical control is high , which was exemplified by the use of time weighted averages for igf - 1 compared to the use of only a single measurement at the end of treatment , resulting in different outcomes [ 70 ] .
the majority of studies ( 83 %) reported the used igf - 1 assay .
this reporting is especially important when non - corrected igf - 1 concentrations are reported .
for the correct reporting of igf - 1 outcomes , the used method of sampling , the criteria for biochemical control ( preferably < 1x uln ) , and the % of change from baseline per individual should be presented .
if non - corrected igf - 1 concentrations are given , the individual 's age and sex should also be included .
growth hormone the wide range of methods to sample gh and determine biochemical control of gh can influence the results , as was recently shown in a paper that suggested that in patients with active acromegaly , the mean of four samples , sampled with 4 h intervals , reflected an endogenous 24 h gh profile best [ 12 ] .
only one trial included in this review used this approach to determine the mean gh level , indicating that this sampling method is rarely used in clinical practice [ 48 ] .
in 70 % of the studies , both the gh and igf - 1 concentration were used to define the individual biochemical control , with a multitude of different cut - off values .
this percentage is high when taking into account the cautionary remarks in the guidelines on the use of gh levels to determine biochemical control and the lack of a safe reference range .
the wide use of < 1 ng / ml or < 2.5 ng / ml as cut - off value for adequate control of gh precludes reliable comparability of studies .
the reporting of the percentage biochemical control using both cut - offs would improve this .
for gh reporting , only 77 % of the studies specified which gh assay was used .
this percentage is low , considering the high variability between assays , and should be made mandatory for all future publications .
if more than 1 gh assay was used in a study , between or within patients , it should also be noted whether the same international reference was used or what correction to the data was applied [ 19 ] .
the method of sampling , the used analytical assay , the distribution of gh concentrations and the % of change from baseline are informative to include in a report .
preferably , the gh observations should not be used to assess the biochemical control and treatment effectiveness , due to the reasons previously discussed .
oral glucose tolerance test the ogtt is commonly performed at study initiation for the confirmation of active acromegaly or to assess surgery success multiple weeks after surgery .
unfortunately , there is limited use in performing an ogtt to determine medical treatment efficacy .
however , the gh nadir concentrations that are obtained as the main outcome of an ogtt at study initiation or after surgery reflects an individual 's disease state , which may be a predictor of an individual 's response to treatment .
therefore , a consensus in the reporting of the ogtt results would be appropriate to allow comparison between the responses in different biomarkers .
the analysis of the ogtt show that different cut - offs were used for the gh response after an ogtt in which biochemical control was most commonly defined as a gh nadir < 1 ng / ml , which is supported by the endocrine society guidelines [ 8 ] .
only one study performed and reported the sampling schedule as suggested in literature , a 2 h sampling period with samples every 30 min .
the majority ( 64 %) of studies provided sufficient details on the used gh assay .
since gh concentrations are measured in the lower assay regions during an ogtt , inclusion of the details of the gh assay used in the methods section is imperative .
pharmacokinetics in this review , nine studies ( 18 % of total ) were available that measured at least 1 pk sample .
when these studies were explored , all except one study [ 20 ] , performed a standard non - compartmental analysis .
a non - compartment analysis will generally result in the reporting of summary statistics of the secondary pk parameters ( cmax , tmax , area under the curve ) [ 71 ] .
alternatively , individual pk profiles are more informative than these summary statistics .
this was also the case when the dosage and dose frequency was altered for lanreotide autogel [ 21 ] .
in this case , the individual pk profiles showed a clear overlap between the two cohorts and a high variability within the groups .
this could indicate that the variability in drug exposure between individuals is higher than the exposure differences caused by the alternative dosing regimen .
despite the importance of individualizing treatment responses , the current focus in literature is predominantly on the identification of a dose - response relationship , which neglects the individual concentrations that are reached in patients .
in the investigated studies , the reporting of the time after dose was inconsistent .
this may have a significant impact on the observed response , which is depended on the drug concentrations at that time point , and should be included in the reporting .
the discrepancy in drug dose and response between individuals might be caused by the high variability in individual serum / plasma drug concentrations .
this high variability is often misrepresented due to the reporting of the mean +/ - se in pk profiles [ 22 , 34 , 36 ] .
especially in large populations , the use of standard errors are a poor indicator to assess the level of inter - individual variability [ 72 ] .
this can be clearly observed in the study by chieffo et al .
[ 36 ] in which individual concentrations reached 33 times the mean cmax , which cannot be clearly observed from the reported figure .
in this situation , the use of individual profiles , or a 95 % confidence interval , is much more informative to quantify and show the inter - individual variability in the pk over time .
besides the variability in response to treatment due to tumor heterogeneity , the impact of different levels of circulating drug levels are commonly ignored .
the studies that measured the pk of the drug had the unique opportunity to investigate the concentration - effect relationship and explore possible covariates , variables that could explain the inter - individual variability in the pk , while studying a wide range of concentrations in a highly heterogeneous population .
this approach was only undertaken by garrido et al .
[ 20 ] in the development of a population pharmacodynamic model that included drug response on both the individual mean gh and igf - 1 levels , allowing a more evidence based approach in acromegaly treatment .
summary statistics the most common way of reporting the biomarkers concentrations in the included studies was a mean +/ - sd , which was reported in 42 % of the igf - 1 studies and in 41 % of the gh studies .
however , as a general rule of thumb , the mean +/ - sd should only be used for normally distributed data [ 73 ]. that gh data is commonly non - normally distributed can be clearly observed from the report by neggers et al. , where the depicted standard deviation would indicate that more than 15 % of the data are negative gh concentrations [ 23 ] .
many tests for data normality exist ( e.g. shapiro - wilk , kolmogorov - smirnov ) , which are commonly included in statistical software , and are required to be checked as an assumption for some statistical tests [ 74 ] .
for non - normally distributed data , the reporting of a median and iqr ( 25 - 75 % distribution of the data ) is advised [ 73 ] .
if data are non - normally distributed , a mann - whitney u test can be applied to assess significant differences between groups .
online resource 4 contains an extensive checklist of the advised reporting of igf - 1 , gh , ogtt and pk results in acromegaly studies .
study inclusion criteria in addition to the variability in the reported outcomes , a wide variability in the study inclusion criteria was identified ( online resource 3 ) .
this patient selection criteria differed between studies on the basis of both the used gh and igf - 1 cut - offs or medical treatment history ( e.g. treatment naive , long term treatment ) , which may significantly alter the study outcomes .
however , the impact of patient selection , and the identification of possible differences between patient groups , cannot yet be quantified due to the differences in the methods used to measure and report gh and igf - 1 , as identified in this review .
in conclusion , supplementary to a consensus on the diagnosis and the monitoring of treatment effectiveness in acromegaly , a second consensus on reporting of the results of both prospective and retrospective trials is urgently needed .
this uniform reporting should , as a minimum , include the patient inclusion and exclusion criteria , the definition of biochemical control used in a study , the proportion of patients achieving biochemical control after treatment ( igf - 1 and / or gh ) , the percentage of change from baseline , the uln - corrected levels for igf - 1 concentrations ( mean / median depending on data normality ) , the used sampling design , and preferably , individual results .
when gh concentrations are reported , the used analytical assay must be included , with the international reference standard .
additionally , the results of an ogtt or the individual pk profiles can be used to obtain explanatory information on an individual 's response to a drug which can be used as a basis for dose optimization .
these recommendations will enhance the inter - study comparison and therewith improve evidence based decision making in acromegaly .

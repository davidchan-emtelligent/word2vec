recent work has highlighted glutaminase ( gls ) as a key player in cancer cell metabolism , providing glutamine - derived carbon and nitrogen to pathways that support proliferation .
there is significant interest in targeting gls for cancer therapy , although the gene is not known to be mutated or amplified in tumors .
as a result , identification of tractable markers that predict gls dependence is needed for translation of gls inhibitors to the clinic .
herein we validate a small molecule inhibitor of gls and show that non - small cell lung cancer cells marked by low e - cadherin and high vimentin expression , hallmarks of a mesenchymal phenotype , are particularly sensitive to inhibition of the enzyme .
furthermore , lung cancer cells induced to undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( emt ) acquire sensitivity to the gls inhibitor .
metabolic studies suggest that the mesenchymal cells have a reduced capacity for oxidative phosphorylation and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress , rendering them unable to cope with the perturbations induced by gls inhibition .
these findings elucidate selective metabolic dependencies of mesenchymal lung cancer cells and suggest novel pathways as potential targets in this aggressive cancer type .

introduction it has been appreciated for 60 years that glutamine ( gln ) is a conditionally essential amino acid for the growth of cancer cells in culture [ 1 ] .
glutamine is the most abundant circulating amino acid in humans at a concentration of ~ 500 microm in serum , and many studies indicate that gln is a major source of carbon and nitrogen for tumor cells [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
one enzyme in particular , glutaminase , localizes to the mitochondria and appears to be critical for entry of glutamine carbon into the tricarboxylic acid ( tca ) cycle in many cancer cells [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
glutamine is converted to glutamate and ammonia by glutaminase , and the glutamate carbon is subsequently shuttled into the tca cycle via conversion to alpha - ketoglutarate ( alpha - kg ) by several different enzymes including glutamate dehydrogenase and various aminotransferases .
mammals carry two genes that encode mitochondrial glutaminase , gls1 ( or kga ) and gls2 ( or lga ) , which were initially identified in normal kidney and liver , respectively [ 6 ] .
the gls1 gene produces two predominant splice variants encoding canonical gls1 ( also known as kga ) and gac , however the differential functions of these two variants are not well understood [ 7 ] .
several elegant studies have illustrated the contribution of carbon derived from gln into the tca cycle via glutaminolysis [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
gls1 expression has also been identified as a target of the myc oncogene [ 10 ] and has been implicated as an effector of rho - mediated transformation in breast cancer cell lines [ 11 ] .
interference with gls activity via either genetic or pharmacologic manipulation has been demonstrated by a number of groups to negatively impact the growth of select cancer cell lines [ 11 ] - [ 13 ] .
based on the totality of published data on the importance of gln and glutaminase in cancer , gls has been highlighted as a potential drug target for oncology indications [ 14 ] .
to our knowledge gls1 is not mutated or amplified in human cancers .
in order to facilitate the use of gls1 inhibitors in the clinic a better understanding of the genetic and phenotypic contexts that drive dependence on gls1 is required .
in this study we validate the on - target cell - based activity of a published gls1 inhibitor , bptes ( bis - 2 - ( 5 - phenylacetamido - 1,2,4 - thiadiazol - 2 - yl ) ethyl sulfide ) [ 15 ] , showing that it acts specifically via a gls1 - dependent mechanism to induce anti - proliferative and metabolic perturbations in cells .
we use bptes as a validated tool compound to screen a panel of lung cancer lines and identify a subset of lines that exhibit gls dependence and express markers characteristic of a mesenchymal phenotype .
tgf - beta mediated induction of emt sensitized cells to gls inhibition and was associated with impaired mitochondrial respiratory capacity and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress .
these findings point to a selective role for gls in mesenchymal nsclc cells , which utilize gls to provide a carbon source for oxidative phosphorylation and to maintain redox balance required for cellular proliferation .
results cell line panel screen and validation of bptes as a tool compound to gain insight into the genetic / phenotypic determinants of gls dependence , we screened a panel of cell lines with the published gls1 inhibitor bptes [ 15 ] .
we focused specifically on one tumor type , lung cancer , due to the large number of established cell line models available. of the 62 lung lines selected for analysis using bptes , 44 have been classified as nsclc ( s1 table in s2 file ) .
relative growth rates ( mu _ bptes / mu _ dmso ) were calculated following drug treatment in order to best compare relative sensitivity to bptes between cell lines that varied in doubling time .
approximately 30 % of these 62 lines exhibited significant sensitivity to bptes as defined by > 40 % reduction in growth rate ( fig. 1a , s1 table in s2 file ) .
the degree of sensitivity to bptes was highly varied , with cell death evident in some cell lines ( microbptes / microdmso < 0 ; e.g. a427 ) and a near complete lack of response in others ( e.g. nci - h1563 ) .
since celltiter - glo ( ctg ) , which measures atp levels , was used as a rapid , surrogate method for screening cell number following bptes treatment , we validated that the effects of glutaminase inhibition on cellular atp levels was a representative readout of cell number .
assessment of cell number by dna content ( syto60 ) demonstrated a comparable effect of bptes treatment on cell proliferation as indicated by ctg at the 72 hr endpoint ( s1 figure in s1 file ) .

( a ) sensitivity of a panel of nsclc lines to inhibition of growth by 10 microm bptes in a 72 hr proliferation assay .
growth rates ( mu ) plotted relative to dmso control for each cell line ( mu / max ) .
( b,c ) a427 parent cells or cells stably expressing an empty vector control ( con ) , wild - type gac ( gac ) , or a bptes - resistant gac enzyme ( gac - br ) were treated with the indicated concentrations of bptes ( a ) or the inactive bptes analogue , agx - 4769 ( c ) , in a 72 hr proliferation assay .
results are representative of three independent experiments with mean and standard deviation indicated .

results are the mean of three replicates with the standard deviation indicated .
calculated p - values from student t - test , *( 3x10 - 8 ) , **( 10 - 9 ) , #( 10 - 7 ) , ##( 2x10 - 6 ) .
in order to confirm that the effects of bptes on cells are on - target , we engineered a427 cells to overexpress cdna encoding a previously described bptes resistant mutated gac , named gac - br ( f318a and f322a ) and assessed the effect of bptes on cell growth of these cells compared to cells overexpressing wild - type gac ( gac - wt ) or an empty vector .
gac - br is unable to bind bptes but maintains catalytic activity [ 16 ] .
overexpression of gac - br rendered the a427 cells resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of bptes ( fig. 1b ) whereas cells expressing empty vector or gac - wt retained significant sensitivity to bptes .
the modestly blunted effect of bptes on growth of the gac - wt compared to the parental or empty vector expressing lines is likely due to the ~ 2x increase in gac expression in this model .
we also utilized this system to address the on - target effects of bptes in modulating de novo synthesis of glutamate and aspartate from glutamine .
s2 figure ( in s1 file ) highlights the flow of carbon from glutamine to glutamate and downstream tca intermediates as has been described [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
overexpression of gac - br , but not gac - wt , ameliorated the bptes induced block in glutamine flow into glutamate and aspartate ( fig. 1d,e ) .
the incomplete restoration of 13c ( 5 ) - aspartate levels may reflect the particular sensitivity of this metabolite to gls inhibition , perhaps due to the contribution of both carbon and nitrogen from glutamine to aspartate biosynthesis and / or due to effects from inhibition of the endogenous gls1 activity .
a biochemically inactive bptes analogue , agx - 4769 , with a conservative modification ( s3 figure in s1 file ) , was used to treat the same cell lines and had no effects on proliferation or downstream metabolites ( figs. 1c - e ) .
these data indicate that the effects of bptes on proliferation and modulation of downstream metabolites is due to inhibition of gls1 and not due to off - target effects .
as yet another means of validating the utility of bptes as a tool compound to screen for gls dependence , we performed sirna mediated knockdown of gls1 ( either total or gac specifically ) in a subset of 6 of the nsclc lines from the panel .
all 3 lines that were sensitive to bptes were also sensitive to gls kd , while the 3 that were not sensitive to bptes were less / not sensitive ( s4 figure in s1 file ) .
while kd of gac alone resulted in substantial growth inhibition in the bptes sensitive lines , kd of total gls1 resulted in an even more profound impairment indicating that both isoforms of gls1 ( kga and gac ) contribute to growth / viability of these cells .
gls1 dependence in nsclc with a mesenchymal ( emt ) phenotype based on the range of bptes sensitivity observed across the 62 cell lines ( fig. 1 ) , we searched for transcriptional markers that associated with sensitivity or resistance using a publicly available dataset from the broad institute ( https :// array.nci.nih.gov / caarray / project / golub - 00327 ). of note , neither gls1 nor gls2 mrna expression levels correlated with sensitivity .
the top 200 probes showing most significant correlation with sensitivity were then submitted to genego pathway analysis ( http :// portal.genego.com / cgi / data _ manager.cgi ) .
we noted that no metabolism - related pathways were strongly associated with bptes responsiveness , indicating that any intrinsic differences in metabolism between sensitive and resistant cells are not broadly reflected at the transcriptional level ( table s2 in file _ s2 ) .
interestingly , 4 of the top 25 pathways were related to emt ( ranks 1 , 15 , 23 , 25 ; fig. 2a ) .
immune response pathways were also highly represented in this analysis .
while we chose to focus our investigations on the link between emt and gls1 dependence , it is notable that a link between nf - kappab and glutaminase activity has been demonstrated by others [ 11 ] , [ 17 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0115144.g002 figure 2 association between emt - related markers and bptes sensitivity in nsclc lines .

histone h3 was used as a loading control .

p = 0.03 comparing gac / pc protein levels in sensitive compared to insensitive lines ; p = 0.06 comparing sensitive to intermediate groups ( unpaired 2 - tail t - test ) .
in order to identify specific markers predictive of bptes sensitivity , we probed the list of significantly correlated probes from the above analysis for individual emt related genes .
e - cadherin and vimentin were positively and negatively correlated with growth in the presence of bptes ( i.e. lack of sensitivity to gls inhibition ) , respectively ( fig. 2b ) .
low e - cadherin / high vimentin are well - defined markers of cells that have a mesenchymal phenotype [ 18 ] .
a significant correlation was also observed for several other genes typically modulated during emt , including claudin4 / 7 and zeb1 ( table s3 in file _ s2 ) .
following the initial bptes screen , a subset of 21 of the nsclc lines was re - examined for bptes sensitivity and analyzed for protein expression levels of selected markers identified from the transcriptional profiling analysis ( fig. 2c,d ; table s4 in file _ s2 ) .
in 6 / 7 of the top sensitive nsclc lines , low e - cadherin and high vimentin protein levels were reproducibly observed ( fig. 2c ) .
the group of sensitive lines were also marked by an average higher ratio of gac / pyruvate carboxylase ( pc ) protein levels ( fig. 2c , d ; p = 0.03 ) .
similar results were obtained comparing total gls1 / pc levels .
we chose to focus on gac levels as this isoform predominates in most cancer cells .
pc protein levels alone were significantly elevated in the insensitive compared to sensitive lines ( p = 0.02 ) and mrna levels negatively correlated with bptes sensitivity in the larger panel of 60 + lung cancer lines screened ( pearson correlation factor : 0.29 ; pearson p value : 0.03 ) .
since pyruvate carboxylase can substitute for glutaminase in providing carbon to the tca cycle [ 19 ] , the association of altered gac / pc ratios with sensitivity to gls inhibition suggests the possibility that alternative modes of carbon entry into the tca can influence gls dependence .
interestingly , the three nsclc lines that were most sensitive to bptes ( a427 , lxf289 , sw1573 ) all carry activating mutations in beta - catenin ( t41a in a427 and lxf289 , s33f in sw1573 , table s4 in file _ s2 ) .
wnt / beta - catenin signaling is one of several pathways that have been implicated in driving emt [ 20 ] .
as a result , we used sirna mediated knockdown of beta - catenin in a427 cells to determine if loss would result in a change in sensitivity to bptes .
strikingly , beta - catenin knockdown resulted in reduced sensitivity to bptes treatment ( fig. 3a ) .
interestingly , the reduction in beta - catenin protein levels was accompanied by an increase in e - cadherin levels ( fig. 3b ) , as has previously been described in bladder cancer cells [ 21 ] .
in the absence of bptes treatment , beta - catenin kd resulted in a modest ( 23 % decrease ; p = 0.02 ) impairment in cell growth ( fig. 3a ) .

( d ) nci - h358 parental and 6wk tgf - beta treated cells were treated in triplicate with bptes for 72 hrs and cell growth assessed by ctg .
results are representative of 3 independent experiments and are plotted as average growth rates (+/ - sd ) compared to dmso treated cells .
tgfbeta - induced emt in nci - h358 nsclc cells leads to gls1 dependence in order to better understand the contribution of mesenchymal versus epithelial phenotype to gls dependence , we treated nci - h358 cells , which are phenotypically epithelial ( high e - cadherin / low vimentin ) and exhibit moderate sensitivity to bptes ( fig. 2c ) , with tgfbeta to induce emt .
as has been reported [ 22 ] , tgfbeta shifted the nci - h358 line to a mesenchymal phenotype as demonstrated by decreased e - cadherin and elevated vimentin ( fig. 3c ) .
notably , gac protein levels were also affected during this transition , with a 2 - fold increase in protein levels in the mesenchymal variant ( fig. 3c ) .
in contrast , pc levels were slightly reduced ( 1.4x decrease ) upon emt , resulting in an increased gac / pc ratio ( fig. 3c ) .
interestingly , concomitant with the increase in gac expression , levels of the less prominently expressed kga isoform decreased (~ 40 %) upon emt .
the regulation and potential differential function of the different gls1 isoforms remains unclear .
consistent with the model that mesenchymal character predicts gls1 dependence , the tgfbeta - treated nci - h358 mesenchymal cells showed significantly enhanced sensitivity to bptes relative to the untreated cells ( fig. 3d ) .
the tgfbeta - treated line had a 1.5 - 2 fold reduced growth rate compared to the parental line , though from the larger panel of lines screened , there was no correlation between growth rate and sensitivity to bptes .
this data , combined with the expression analyses of the cell line panel , strongly argues that mesenchymal lung cancer cells are predisposed to dependence on gls1 .
since glutaminase serves as a key regulator of glutamine carbon entry into the tca , we asked whether inhibition of gls1 differentially affects oxidative phosphorylation ( oxphos ) in the epithelial compared to mesenchymal ( nci - h358 _ m ) line .
mitochondrial oxygen consumption was measured in real time following bptes treatment .
at baseline , o2 consumption rate ( ocr ) was not significantly different between the two lines ( s5a figure in s1 file ) .
following 2 hr treatment with bptes , ocr was comparably reduced in the epithelial and mesenchymal lines compared to the dmso treated cells ( fig. 4a ; s5b figure in s1 file ) .
notably , with increasing time post - bptes treatment , the ocr in the parental line slowly recovered , while ocr continued to decrease with time in the nci - h358 _ m cells ( fig. 4a , s5b figure in s1 file ) .
the decrease in ocr was not reflective of decreased cell number at this early ( 20 hr ) time point ( s5c figure in s1 file ) .
to confirm that this effect of gls inhibition was not unique to the nci - h358 cells we performed the same experiment in an additional pair of sensitive ( nci - h1703 ) and insensitive ( nci - h1563 ) cells .
inhibition of o2 consumption was highly selective for the gls1 dependent nci - h1703 line ( fig. 4b ) suggesting that impairment of oxidative phosphorylation is one component of the anti - proliferative effects induced by gls inhibition .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0115144.g004 figure 4 oxygen consumption rates differentially altered upon drug perturbation in sensitive compared to insensitive cells .
( a ) nci - h358 epithelial and mesenchymal lines or ( b ) nci - h1703 ( bptes sensitive ) and nci - h1563 ( bptes insensitive ) cells were treated with dmso or 8 microm bptes and oxygen consumption rate ( ocr ) was monitored over a 20 hr treatment .

( d ) addition of pyruvate to media restores the impaired fccp response in the mesenchymal line .
average values +/ - sem indicated .
results representative of 2 - 3 independent experiments .
the differential impact of bptes on mitochondrial respiration in the mesenchymal versus epithelial line led us to question whether these lines might more broadly differ in their capacity to adaptively respond to metabolic / mitochondrial stress .
to explore such a possibility , we performed sequential treatment of cells with oligomycin ( atp synthase inhibitor ) , fccp ( uncouples respiration from atp synthesis , allows assessment of maximal respiration ) , and rotenone ( inhibits entry of electrons at complex i ) [ 23 ] .
strikingly , the nci - h358 _ m cells were defective in increasing o2 consumption in response to fccp , indicative of a lower respiratory capacity of these cells ( fig. 4c ; s5d figure in s1 file ) .
recently , it was demonstrated that pyruvate is required for stimulation of maximal ocr in breast cancer cells [ 24 ] .
interestingly , additional supplementation of the rpmi media ( containing 11 mm glucose and 2 mm glutamine ) with 2 mm pyruvate in the presence of mitochondrial inhibitors restored the ability of the nci - h358 _ m cells to respond to fccp with an increased ocr ( fig. 4d ) , indicating that these cells may be unable to effectively utilize endogenous supplies of pyruvate / other alternative carbon sources to adequately fuel their reserve respiratory capacity .
taken together , these results suggest that the transition to a mesenchymal state may result in an impaired ability to adaptively respond to gls inhibition and potentially to other mitochondrial stresses .
we next tested whether alternative carbon sources could also rescue the impaired growth of the nci - h358 _ m cells following bptes treatment .
addition of either sodium pyruvate or a cell permeable analog of alpha - kg , dimethyl - 2 - oxoglutarate ( m - alphakg ) , to the growth medium resulted in a rescue of proliferation to ~ 85 - 90 % that observed in vehicle treated cells , compared to ~ 45 % for dimethyl succinate ( fig. 5 ) .
unlike alphakg and pyruvate , succinate to our knowledge has not been reported to have anti - oxidant properties .
since glutamate derived from glutamine can feed into the glutathione ( gsh ) biosynthetic pathway and contribute to maintaining redox balance [ 25 ] ( as well as fueling the tca via conversion to alpha - kg ) we also examined the effect of a cell permeable derivate of gsh , glutathione reduced ethyl ester ( gsh - mee ) , and the antioxidant n - acetylcysteine ( nac ) on bptes induced growth inhibition .
both gsh - mee and nac alone restored growth to ~ 75 - 85 % that of vehicle treated cells while the combination of pyruvate and nac restored proliferation to close to 95 % that of control cells ( fig. 5 ) .
these findings suggest that impairments in both redox stress and tca cycle anaplerosis contribute to the anti - proliferative effects of gls inhibition in these cells .

nci - h358 _ m cells were treated with dmso or 8 microm bptes in triplicate in the presence or absence of dimethyl 2 - oxoglutarate ( m - alpha - kg ) , sodium pyruvate , dimethyl succinate , glutathione reduced ethyl ester ( gsh - mee ) , or n - acetylcysteine ( nac ) for 96 hrs and cell growth was measured by ctg .

in order to further elucidate the mechanism underlying the differential sensitivity of the epithelial and mesenchymal nci - h358 cells to gls inhibition , we performed a metabolic analysis of these cells , examining patterns of glutamine and glucose ( glc ) utilization ( glc labeling schematic depicted in s6 figure ( in s1 file ) and the effects of gls inhibition .
we first confirmed that bptes was comparably inhibiting gls in both of the lines by monitoring 13c ( 5 ) - gln and 13c ( 5 ) - glu levels by lcms in cells fed with uniformly labeled 13c - gln ( u - 13c - gln ) .
using 13c ( 5 ) - glu / 13c ( 5 ) - gln levels as a readout for gls activity , we demonstrated effective ( 97 %) inhibition of gls activity in both epithelial and mesenchymal lines ( fig. 6a ; s7 figure in s1 file ) .
this data indicates that the vast majority of conversion of gln to glu in these cell lines is catalyzed by gls1 and not gls2 or other gln utilizing enzymes .
one potential hypothesis to explain the differential sensitivity of the two lines was that the mesenchymal cells might preferentially utilize glutamine to fuel the tca .
surprisingly , a 4 hr feed of cells with u - 13c - gln demonstrated substantial contribution of glutamine to citrate pools in both the epithelial ( 63 %) and mesenchymal ( 49 %) line ( fig. 6b ) .
consistent with the prominent contribution of glutamine to citrate pools , a 20 hr bptes treatment reduced the total levels of tca metabolites , including alpha - kg and citrate ( fig.6c ; s7 figure in s1 file ) .
little or no effect of drug on cell numbers was observed within this time of bptes treatment in these ( s5c figure in s1 file ) and other cell lines tested ( s1 figure in s1 file ) .
in spite of the fact that glutamine contributed more prominently to citrate pools in the epithelial compared to mesenchymal line ( fig. 6b ) , citrate levels dropped more dramatically and to lower ( 61 %) total levels in the bptes treated nci - h358 _ m cells .
taken together with the increased drop in o2 consumption by bptes in the mesenchymal compared to epithelial line , these data suggest a potential impairment in the ability of the mesenchymal line to adapt to a block of gln flow into the tca , perhaps due to a differential ability to use alternative carbon sources in this setting .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0115144.g006 figure 6 metabolic profiling of epithelial and mesenchymal cells and effects of gls inhibition .
nci - h358 epithelial ( e ) and mesenchymal ( m ) lines were treated with dmso or 8 microm bptes for 20 hrs .

p values for comparison of metabolite levels +/ - bptes : * 0.1 , ** 0.57 , # 0.04 , ## 0.07 .
results representative of 2 independent experiments .
interestingly , monitoring of glucose flow into the tca using a u - 13c - glc feed ( s7 figure in s1 file ) , revealed glucose contribution to 28 % and 37 % of the total citrate pool in epithelial and mesenchymal cells , respectively ; upon bptes treatment , this relative contribution was reduced to 15 % in the epithelial and 3 % in the mesenchymal line ( fig. 6d ; s7 figure in s1 file ) , indicative of a selective block in glucose flow into the tca with bptes treatment in the mesenchymal line .
consistent with this notion , examination of glycolytic intermediate pool sizes revealed increased dhap and reduced 3 - pg levels ( fig. 6e ; s7 figure in s1 file ) with bptes treatment in the mesenchymal line , indicating a block in flow at this step in glycolysis .
in addition to differences in metabolites involved in bioenergetic / biosynthetic pathways , the nci - h358 _ m cells had lower reduced glutathione ( gsh ) levels in both the basal and bptes treated setting compared to the epithelial variant ( fig. 6c ; s7 figure in s1 file ) .
in 6 additional nsclc lines examined , there was a similar trend between degree of drop in gsh pools with bptes sensitivity ( s8a figure in s1 file ) , leading us to investigate the effects of bptes treatment on ros levels .
modulation of oxidative stress by gls inhibition in mesenchymal nsclc cells correlates with sensitivity to test whether sensitivity to gls inhibition correlated with increased oxidative stress upon bptes treatment , we measured levels of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) using cm - h2dcfda in the nci - h358 epithelial and mesenchymal pair as well as another pair of bptes sensitive ( nci - h1703 )/ insensitive ( nci - h838 ) lines .
the nci - h838 line was chosen for examination since , similar to the nci - h358 line , it exhibits poor sensitivity to bptes despite having a substantial contribution of gln to tca carbon pools ( unpublished data ) .
while gls inhibition resulted in increased ros levels in all four lines tested , the sensitive lines exhibited a greater magnitude of increase in ros by bptes ( 7.4 vs 4.4 - fold in nci - h358 _ m compared to parental ; 15.9 - fold vs 4.6 - fold in nci - h1703 compared to nci - h838 cells ; fig. 7a ) .
interestingly , it has been shown that oxidative stress can impair carbohydrate flux through glycolysis via inactivation of enzymes , including gapdh [ 26 ] .
taken together , these data suggest a model in which increased ros generation following gls inhibition in the mesenchymal cells sensitizes to gls inhibition in part via inhibition of glucose flow into tca , resulting in reduced citrate levels and oxphos ( fig. 7c ) .

results representative of 3 independent experiments ; data plotted as ros levels relative to dmso treatment of each cell line ( mean +/ - sd ) ; p = 0.01 comparing induction of ros by bptes in the 2 pairs of sensitive / insensitive lines .
( b ) nci - h358 epithelial and mesenchymal lines were treated with bso or h202 in a 72 hr ctg assay .
results representative of 2 - 3 independent experiments and plotted as mean +/ - sd .
( c ) model for sensitivity of mesenchymal nsclc cells to gls inhibition .
inhibition of gln - - > glu conversion by bptes impairs flow of carbon from gln into the tca in both lines .
in the mesenchymal line , bptes treatment results in a selective block in glucose flow into the tca due to impaired flow from dhap / ga3p to 3 - pg in upper glycolysis .
a model is proposed wherein increased ros levels following bptes treatment in the mesenchymal line underlie the altered flow through glycolysis .
we next asked whether other means of reducing glutathione / increasing oxidative stress differentially affects the epithelial and mesenchymal nci - h358 cells .
interestingly , the mesenchymal line was significantly more sensitive than the epithelial line to perturbation of gsh synthesis with the glutamylcysteine transferase inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine ( bso ) .
the maximum dose of bso used ( 2 mm ) resulted in a 79 % reduction in growth rate in the nci - h358 _ m cells compared to a 9 % reduction in growth rate in the parental line .
examination of two additional pairs of bptes sensitive ( a427 , nci - h1703 ) and insensitive ( nci - h838 , nci - h1563 ) lines revealed a similar pattern of increased sensitivity to bso in the bptes sensitive lines ( s8b figure in s1 file ) .
similarly , lower concentrations of hydrogen peroxide were required to blunt growth / kill nci - h358 _ m compared to parental cells ( gi90 = 28 vs 56 microm ; fig. 7b ) .
to confirm that the increased sensitivity of the mesenchymal cells to gls inhibition and oxidative stress inducing agents was not simply indicative of a heightened sensitivity to all drug treatments , the two lines were examined for sensitivity to the egfri , gefitinib as well as the chemotherapeutic agent , docetaxel .
in contrast to the gls inhibitor and oxidative stress inducing agents , gefitinib and docetaxel were more effective at inhibiting growth in the epithelial compared to mesenchymal nci - h358 cells ( s9 figure in s1 file ) .
discussion the recent explosion in cancer metabolism research has focused not only on the area of glucose and the warburg effect , but also on the complementary roles of myriad other nutrients that contribute to cancer cell growth .
glutaminase has emerged as one of several enzymes utilized by tumors to enable gln use as a key nutrient for some tumor cells .
as a result , targeting glutaminase as a cancer therapeutic has garnered significant attention .
to our knowledge , gls1 is not consistently mutated or amplified in any reported cancers .
recent studies have highlighted vhl - deficient rcc [ 27 ] and idh1 mutant glioblastoma [ 12 ] as particular genetic settings in which tumors may depend on gls .
in an analysis of gln dependency in nsclc , it was found that cell lines varied widely in their reliance on gln , although there were no clear genetic markers identified that correlated with this dependence , including gls1 expression levels [ 7 ] .
as gln is utilized for nucleotide synthesis and glycosylation pathways [ 28 ] , in addition to fueling the tca cycle via gls activity , it is likely that multiple factors play a role in determining gln dependence .
in this study , we screen a panel of lung cancer lines with a published tool compound , bptes , to specifically inhibit gln utilization via gls1 .
although bptes has been used extensively in the literature , prior to this study , it had not been validated for the specificity of its cellular effects .
we herein validate the specificity of the cellular and metabolic effects of bptes and demonstrate , for the first time , that a mesenchymal phenotype predisposes nsclc cells to dependence on gls1 .
in addition to being marked by low e - cadherin / high vimentin expression , bptes sensitive nsclc lines on average had elevated gac and lower pyruvate carboxylase expression compared to insensitive lines .
notably , gac expression was selectively increased with tgfbeta treatment in the nci - h358 nsclc model .
together these findings represent an interesting extension of previous findings in which tgfbeta was found to enhance the expression of gls1 in the llc - pk ( 1 ) - fbpase model system [ 29 ] .
further , in a comprehensive study by thomson et al [ 30 ] examining the downstream consequences of emt , gls expression was found to be similarly elevated at the transcriptional level in nci - h358 cells that were induced to undergo emt via several different mechanisms ( tgfbeta treatment , or snail / zeb1 overexpression ) .
another recent study examining metabolic gene alterations in several pairs of non - invasive epithelial vs. invasive mesenchymal breast cancer lines reported elevated gls1 gene transcription in the mesenchymal versus epithelial lines [ 31 ] .
taken together with our work , these data indicate that tgfbeta / emt may be a regulator of glutaminase and metabolic control in multiple diverse systems .
the possibility that the process of emt results in altered metabolic dependencies is of particular interest given the association between emt and acquired resistance to a growing list of targeted therapies in a number of cancer types [ 32 ] - [ 35 ] .
conversely , several recent studies have shown that alterations in metabolism can regulate emt .
knockdown of atp citrate lyase was shown to reverse emt in lung cancer cells [ 36 ] , while knockdown of citrate synthase was found to induce emt [ 33 ] .
also interesting is the recent elucidation of a stem or mesenchymal cellular program that is seen in the context of idh1 / 2 mutations downstream of epigenetic regulation by 2 - hydroxyglutarate [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
ongoing studies should clarify if it is the emt program that drives sensitivity to gls1 inhibitors in these settings .
the implication that a gls1 inhibitor might be used for the treatment of a subset of nsclc with mesenchymal markers is an exciting prospect since this tumor type is generally described as being late stage , aggressively metastatic , and highly refractory to current therapeutic strategies [ 34 ] .
many questions remain to be answered , including whether a mesenchymal phenotype predisposes to gls inhibition in the in vivo setting .
a more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie gls dependence and through which cells can potentially compensate for loss of gls activity will guide in the investigation of relevant combination strategies .
our data suggests that a reduced capacity to cope with oxidative stress in association with emt may in part dictate the response to gls inhibition in the mesenchymal nsclc models examined .
rescue experiments in additional sensitive lines will help clarify the general importance of oxidative stress induction to the growth inhibitory phenotype .
as both the thioredoxin / peroxiredoxin and glutathione pathways play an important role in maintaining redox balance [ 39 ] , it is notable that reduced peroxiredoxin 2 / 5 and thioredoxin levels were observed upon emt in the osi study described above [ 30 ] .
in such a setting cells may be particularly vulnerable to perturbations in the glutathione pathway driven by gls inhibition or bso treatments .
since the generation of ros can regulate tgf - beta signaling and its effects on differentiation / emt [ 40 ] - [ 42 ] , the possibility remains that alterations in redox state could serve as an initial driver and link between mesenchymal phenotype and gls1 dependence .
interestingly , in the context of dna damage / oxidative stress , induction of gls2 expression has been shown to occur in a p53 - dependent manner , indicating that both gls1 and gls2 are positioned to protect cells from pathways that induce oxidative stress [ 43 ] .
studies are currently underway to achieve a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving altered dependence on gls in the setting of emt , as well as to achieve a more comprehensive analysis of alterations in metabolite flux that occur with this transition .
in particular , it will be interesting to determine if the bptes mediated reduction in citrate levels differentially impacts lipid biosynthesis in the mesenchymal compared to epithelial cells .
since pyruvate carboxylase levels negatively correlate with bptes sensitivity , differences in the ability to adapt to gls inhibition by oxidation of glucose could be a factor in the more dramatic drops in respiration and growth inhibition in sensitive versus insensitive lines .
it is tempting to speculate that the substantial increase in oxidative stress that occurs following gls inhibition in sensitive lines can modulate enzymes such as gapdh , a known target of oxidative modification [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] , impairing glycolytic flux [ 26 ] .
finally , future studies will help establish whether or not gls1 dependence is driven by emt and oxidative stress in other tumor types where emt has been shown to play an important role in tumorigenesis [ 46 ] .
recent studies have suggested that glutamine and gls1 activity are required for optimal growth of breast cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] and additional work will clarify whether mesenchymal markers predict sensitivities to gls inhibition in this population .

we aimed to assess the predictive value of admission hba1c level in nondiabetic patients presented by acute stemi , on outcome of pci and short term outcome of adverse cardiac events. methods .
60 nondiabetic patients were admitted to cardiology department , zagazig university hospital , with acute stmi : 27 patients with hba1c levels of 4.5 % to 6.4 % ( group 1 ) , 17 patients with hba1c levels of 6.5 % to 8.5 % ( group 2 ) , and 16 patients with hba1c levels higher than 8.5 % ( group 3 ) .
either invasive intervention was done at admission by ( ppci ) or coronary angiography was done within month ( 3 - 28 days ) from taking thrombolytic .
participants were followed up for 6 months. results .
there was significant difference among different groups of hba1c as regards the number of diseased vessels , severity of cad lesions ( p value < 0.01 ) , and timi flow grades ( p value < 0.05 ) .
there was significant difference among different groups as regards the adverse cardiac events on short term follow - up period ( p value < 0.05 ). conclusion .
the present study showed that admission higher hba1c level in patients presented by acute stemi is associated with more severe cad , lower rate of complete revascularization , and higher incidence of adverse cardiac events .
1. introduction stress hyperglycemia in st - segment elevation myocardial infarction ( stemi ) patients was found to be associated with significantly increased rates of mortality and congestive heart failure and shock [ 1 - 3 ] .
most of these studies , however , were in trials of fibrinolytic therapy ; conversely the evidence linking hyperglycemia with an adverse prognosis in patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( ppci ) is limited and derived mainly from observational registries [ 4 ] .
in acute myocardial infraction ( ami ) , stress hyperglycemia commonly occurs secondary to increased catecholamine levels , so looking only at plasma glucose levels at the time of an ami cannot predict the prognosis [ 5 ] .
glycosylated hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) is a measure of the average blood glucose levels over 2 months [ 6 ] and is minimally affected by acute hyperglycemia often observed in myocardial infarction ( mi ) .
elevated hba1c is an important determinant of atherosclerosis beyond the risk associated with established diabetes [ 7 ] .
aim of the work .
our study aimed to assess the predictive value of admission hba1c level in nondiabetic patients presented to zagazig university hospital by acute stemi , on outcome of ppci and short term outcome of adverse cardiac events .
2. patients and method we performed a single - center , observational prospective study of sixty nondiabetes patients with acute stemi , candidate for reperfusion therapy admitted to cardiology department , zagazig university hospital , between january 2013 and december 2013 .
2.1 .
inclusion criteria confirmed admission diagnosis of acute stemi , within 12 h of symptom onset and with persistent st - segment elevation or new or presumed new lbbb , early mechanical ppci , or pharmacological reperfusion should be performed as early as possible .
2.2 .
exclusion criteria patients with passed time mi , patients who have undergone rescue pci , patients who have contraindication to dye as dye allergy and chronic kidney disease , patients with liver cell failure , haemoglobinopathies , haemolytic anaemia , chronic malaria , or severe iron deficiency anaemia due to giving unreliable results leading to inaccurate hba1c level , and patients with past history of diabetes or on antidiabetic treatment were excluded .
2.3 .
clinical data and blood samples main demographic data and the five major risk factors obesity , history of hypertension , dyslipidemia , family history , and cigarette smoking were carefully evaluated .
hba1c levels of all patients were measured within 3 hours of admission , using siemens dca analyzer for quantitative assay for hba1c in blood .
both the concentrations of hba1c specifically and the concentration of total hemoglobin are measured and the ratio reported as percent hba1c .
all of the reagents for performing both reactions are contained in the dca hba1c cartridge [ 8 ] and using a method which is national glycohemoglobin standardization program ( ngsp ) [ 9 ] .
patients were divided into three groups according to the level of hba1c with cut - off 6.5 % as a diagnostic criteria of diabetes mellitus according to ( 2010 ) ada diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [ 10 ] : 27 patients with hba1c levels of 4.5 % to 6.4 % ( group 1 ) , 17 patients with hba1c levels of 6.5 % to 8.5 % ( group 2 ) , and 16 patients with hba1c levels higher than 8.5 % ( group 3 ) .
2.4 .
angiography either invasive intervention was done at admission by ppci or coronary angiography was done within month ( 3 - 28 days ) from taking thrombolytic in stable asymptomatic patients according to the best evidence based medicine [ 11 , 12 ] .
45 cases were subjected to ppci and 15 cases received thrombolytic .
for ppci wiring culprit artery based upon ecg , revascularization of culprit artery only was done unless patient is in cardiogenic shock [ 13 ] .
we used the visual method for evaluation and assessment of number of significantly diseased coronary arteries , with special focus on infracted related artery ( guided by ecg ) on type of the lesion either type a , b , or c [ 14 ] .
also , we used timi flow grading system in ppci cases [ 15 ] .
angiographic results were interpreted by two angiographers who were blinded to clinical or demographic data .
the study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee and all patients provided written , informed consent before study entry .
2.5 .
follow - up period follow - up for six months after the onset of mi mainly for ( 1 ) heart failure , ( 2 ) reinfarction , and ( 3 ) mortality was through phone calls followed by hospital visit in outpatient clinic .
2.6 .
statistical analysis statistical presentation and analysis of the present study were conducted , using the mean , standard deviation , analysis of variance ( anova ) test , and chi - square test by spss v 21 , student 's t - test was used to test the significance of the difference between two independent sample means ; value of < 0.05 indicates significant results .
3. results baseline clinical characteristics and angiographic data regarding number of diseased vessels and lesion type are shown in table 1 .
there was no significant difference between the three groups regarding age , sex , hypertension , smoking , family history , and obesity ( p value > 0.05 ) .
regarding number of diseased vessels , there was high statistically significant difference between the three groups ( p value < 0.001 ) , figure 1 .
there was high statistically significant difference between the three groups regarding lesion types a , b , and c ( p value 0.000 ) , figure 2 .
table 2 shows significant difference among different groups of hba1c as regards the degree of successful reperfusion .
this was supported by the significant difference among different groups as regards timi flow grades with higher percentage of timi grade 3 in group 1 and higher percentage of timi grade 1 in favor of group 3 ( p value < 0.05 ) , figure 3 .
also as shown in table 2 patients in group 1 have higher rates of timi flow grade 0 ( 16.7 %) as compared to group 2 ( 5.9 %) and group 3 ( 10 %) .
adverse cardiac events on short term follow - up period were shown in table 3 ; statistically significant difference among different groups of hba1c with higher mortality , reinfarction , and heart failure in group 3 ( p value < 0.05 ) is shown in figure 4 .
a multiregression analysis in the present study confirmed that hba1c over 6.5 % is an independent predictor outcome of adverse cardiac events .
4. discussion in acute myocardial infraction ( ami ) , stress hyperglycemia commonly occurs secondary to increased catecholamine levels , so looking only at plasma glucose levels at the time of an ami cannot predict the prognosis [ 5 ] .
glycosylated hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) is a measure of the average blood glucose levels over 2 months [ 6 ] and is minimally affected by acute hyperglycemia often observed in myocardial infarction ( mi ) .
in the present study there was significant difference among different hba1c groups as regards the number of diseased coronary vessels with higher percentage of three - vessel disease , better than higher number of three - vessel disease in group ( 3 ) .
this was concordant with previous studies by cakmak et al .
[ 16 ] and kassaian et al .
[ 17 ] .
this can be explained by insulin resistance in hyperglycemia promoting molecular mechanism by advanced glycation end products ( ages ) which are intimately involved in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease by stimulating inflammation , contributing to atheroma formation modulating vascular stiffness and the disturbed endothelial function by reduction of nitric oxide release and increased vascular smooth muscle proliferation [ 18 ] and increase of hba1c one percent is associated with 2.8 - fold increase in cad and in severity of coronary artery lesions , beyond high risk profile of those patients ; it is worth mentioning that even hba1c value in normal range is associated with presence and severity of cad [ 19 ] .
on the contrary , this was discordant with ertem et al .
[ 20 ] who found no significant difference between hba1c level and severity of cad .
this discrepancy may be due to the different score for assessment of the severity cad in their study or the sample size or population difference .
in the present study there was significant difference among different hba1c groups as regards lesion type ( a , b , and c ) with higher lesion type a in group ( 1 ) and lesion type c in group ( 3 ) .
this was in agreement with kassaian et al .
[ 17 ] who found highly significant difference among hba1c groups as regards lesion type c. this may be explained by the fact that diabetes is associated with more extensive coronary artery lesion , more complex lesion , more diffuse excessive tortuosity in the proximal segment , extreme angulations , and total occlusion [ 20 ] .
in the present study there was significant difference among different hba1c groups as regards timi flow grades in patients who had undergone ppci , with higher percentage of timi 3 in group ( 1 ) and significant higher percentage of timi 1 in favor of group ( 3 ) and this was in agreement with planner et al .
[ 4 ] .
this finding may be explained by the fact that hyperglycemia is associated with higher rate of timi 0 \ 1 and lower rate of complete revascularization timi and hyperglycemia adversely affect platelets function and endothelial function , promote inflammation , and result in procoagulable condition ; it is worth mentioning that hyperglycemia per se in stemi leads to impaired coronary flow on presentation and after ppci [ 4 ] .
this goes with our finding that timi 3 complete revascularization is higher in group ( 1 ) , the least level of hba1c , and timi 1 flow has statistical significant difference between groups ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) with higher percentage in favour of group ( 3 ) , the highest level of hba1c , beyond the fact that patients with higher hba1c on admission have larger myocardial infarction and less frequently have open infracted artery .
in the present study we assess hba1c level on the short term outcome ( six months ) to detect major adverse cardiac event as mortality , heart failure , and reinfarction .
in the present study there was significant difference among different hba1c groups as regards adverse cardiac events ; this was concordant with cakmak et al .
[ 16 ] and kassaian et al .
[ 17 ] .
this may be explained by the fact that higher hba1c level at admission was associated with worse cardiometabolic characteristics , larger infarct size , more extensive coronary artery lesion , higher percentage of tmi 1 flow , and lower rate of complete revascularization timi 3 flow .
5. conclusion the present study showed that admission higher hba1c level in nondiabetic patients presented by acute stemi is associated with more severe cad , lower rate of complete revascularization timi 3 , and higher incidence of adverse cardiac events and mortality .
higher hba1c level may be considered for risk stratification of patients presented by acute stemi who are amenable to primary pci , but these findings need to be verified by multicenter and larger cohort studies .
in addition , this study was limited to egyptian subjects , so conclusions for other ethnic groups are needed .

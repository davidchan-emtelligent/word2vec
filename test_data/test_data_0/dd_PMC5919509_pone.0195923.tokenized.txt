the xn series automated hematology analyzer has been equipped with a body fluid ( bf ) mode to count and differentiate leukocytes in bf samples including cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) .
however , its diagnostic accuracy is not reliable for csf samples with low cell concentration at the border between normal and pathologic level .
to overcome this limitation , a new flow cytometry - based technology , termed " high sensitive analysis ( hsa ) mode ," has been developed .
in addition , the xn series analyzer has been equipped with the automated digital cell imaging analyzer di - 60 to classify cell morphology including normal leukocytes differential and abnormal malignant cells detection .
using various bf samples , we evaluated the performance of the xn - hsa mode and di - 60 compared to manual microscopic examination .
the reproducibility of the xn - hsa mode showed good results in samples with low cell densities ( coefficient of variation ; % cv : 7.8 % for 6 cells / mul ) .
the linearity of the xn - hsa mode was established up to 938 cells / mul .
the cell number obtained using the xn - hsa mode correlated highly with the corresponding microscopic examination .
good correlation was also observed between the di - 60 analyses and manual microscopic classification for all leukocyte types , except monocytes .
in conclusion , the combined use of cell counting with the xn - hsa mode and automated morphological analyses using the di - 60 mode is potentially useful for the automated analysis of bf cells .

introduction cell density counting and cell type differentiation in body fluid ( bf ) samples are essential for determining therapeutic approaches to various diseases .
for example , analysis of cell density and leukocyte type in cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) is essential for the treatment of meningitis and encephalitis [ 1 ] .
detection of malignant cells in ascites and pleural effusion is essential for disease staging .
although bf examinations must be conducted as soon as possible , manual microscopic examination and cell counting is time consuming , and the diagnosis can be affected by the individual examiner 's skill level [ 2 ] .
therefore , new analysis systems have recently been developed to automatically count cells using hematological analyzers [ 3 - 5 ] .
however , developing new algorithms is still technically challenging .
for example , cell counting in samples with extremely low cell concentration yields high imprecision .
differentiation of malignant cells also requires sophisticated algorithms due to variability in cell morphology , size , and intracellular content .
to overcome these technological difficulties , high - sensitive analysis mode ( hsa mode , xn - hsa ) and the automated digital cell imaging analyzer di - 60 have been developed and incorporated into the automated hematology analyzer xn series ( xn ; sysmex , kobe , japan ) [ 6 ] .
leukocyte morphology , which is useful to determinate between bacterial and viral infections based on the relative proportions of neutrophils and lymphocytes as well as to detect abnormal malignant cells , can be semi - automatically analyzed with di - 60 on cytospin slides stained using the may - grunwald giemsa method [ 7 ] .
this study investigated the feasibility and accuracy of the xn - hsa mode and di - 60 using various bf samples .
materials and methods sample collection this study was conducted using patient samples , and approval was obtained from the juntendo university hospital medical ethics committee .
written informed consent was waved by the ethical committee since all samples were de - identified for analyses .
the original data are available upon request ( http :// www.juntendo.ac.jp / english / research.html ) .
the samples included 60 csf samples and 60 other bf samples ( 51 pleural effusions , 8 ascites , 1 pericardial effusion ) that were sent to the clinical laboratory department , juntendo university hospital ( tokyo , japan ) .
cytospin slides used for the cell classification were prepared using a shandon cytospin 4 cytocentrifuge ( thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma ) and then were stained with may - grunwald giemsa using heg - nst ( sysmex ) .
for the control method , manual cell counting using the fuchs - rosenthal method was performed in accordance with the clinical and laboratory standards institute ( clsi ) h56 - a guidelines using 200 cells on the same slide that was used in the di - 60 analysis .
within - run precision the xn - hsa mode has several new features to increase its accuracy : ( 1 ) providing a 4 - part differential count ; ( 2 ) utilizing flow cytometry technique for counting rbcs ; ( 3 ) aspirating more sample volume ( 180 mul ) than the xn - bf mode ; and ( 4 ) counting twice as many cells [ 8 ] .
to evaluate within - run precision , cell counts were repeated five times for each primary bf sample using different cell densities .
the mean cell density and coefficient of variation (% cv ) were calculated and compared between the xn - hsa mode and the xn - bf mode .
dilution linearity to evaluate the overall linearity of the hsa mode , csf samples were sequentially diluted with phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) .
the diluted samples were analyzed using the xn - hsa and xn - bf modes .
the measured cell numbers were plotted against the theoretical values , and the plots were fitted with a linear regression method .
correlation between the manual microscopic method and di - 60 to evaluate the feasibility of cell classification utilized an automated digital cell imaging analyzer di - 60 , we analyzed 200 leukocytes in various body fluid samples .
each slide was pre - classified by the di - 60 and subsequently post - classified by an experienced medical technologist ( h.t. ) who was proficient in hematopathology and cytopathology .
a senior clinical pathologist ( y.t. ) supervised the results .
collection and analysis of the bf samples which were performed in compliance with clsi guideline h56 - a ( clsi , body fluid analysis for cellular composition ; approved guideline [ clsi document h56 - a ] , wayne : clsi ; 2006 ) .
the post - classification results using di - 60 in csf ( 34 samples ) and other bf samples ( 60 samples ) were compared to the results of manual microscopic method ( 200 cell counts ) performed by h.t. correlation studies were conducted for neutrophils , lymphocytes , eosinophils , and monocytes .
statistical processing the correlation between the two different methods was evaluated using the pearson product - moment correlation coefficient .
statistical analyses were performed with microsoft excel 2007 ( microsoft , redmond , wa ) .
results within - run precision csf samples with various cell densities were measured five consecutive times using the xn - hsa and xn - bf modes .
table 1 shows the mean cell densities and cvs .
in both modes , the cvs were inversely correlated with cell density .
to compare the precision of these two methods , the cvs were plotted against the cell densities ( fig 1 ) .
in the low cell density range , the cvs using the xn - hsa mode were smaller than for xn - bf ( 7.5 % vs. 12.3 % at the cell density of 6 cells / mul ) .

correlation between the digital cell imaging di - 60 and the manual microscopic examinations finally , we investigated the feasibility of the digital cell imaging analyzer di - 60 by comparing with microscopic examinations using csf ( n = 34 ) and other bf samples ( n = 60 ) .
the cells were classified into four different cell types ( neutrophil , lymphocyte , eosinophil and monocyte ) .

each plot was fitted with a linear regression analyses , which yielded the following coefficients : r = 0.743 for neutrophils ; r = 0.819 for lymphocytes ; r = 0.770 for eosinophils ; and r = 0.778 for monocytes .
in the other body fluid samples , including ascites and pleural effusion , the correlation between the di - 60 ( post - classification ) and manual microscopic examinations were r = 0.973 for neutrophils ; r = 0.939 for lymphocytes ; r = 0.803 for eosinophils ; and r = 0.638 , for monocytes ( fig 4b ) .
in both samples , good correlations were found between the two methods with the exception of monocytes .
in non - csf bf samples , the proportion of neutrophils and lymphocytes obtained using di - 60 tended to be lower than with the manual microscopic method .

discussion many researchers and manufacturers have attempted to develop new automated analyzing systems to measure cells in bf to replace manual examination which are time - and labor - consuming [ 9 ] , and several new analysis algorithms have been invented that can be incorporated with automated hematology analyzers [ 6 , 10 , 11 ] .
in this study , we evaluated the feasibility and accuracy of the most recently developed bf analyzing mode , xn - hsa , and morphology classifying imaging system , di - 60 , using primary bf samples and comparing the results with manual microscopic examination .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study that determined the within - run precision of xn - hsa in primary csf samples with low leukocyte concentrations .
feasibility and accuracy of the xn - hsa cell counting in various bf samples by conventional automated hematology analyzers has been challenging , particularly when the cell density is extremely low .
for example , the diagnostic threshold of leukocyte counts for meningitis in csf samples is only 5 cells / mul , and there is large variability of cell counts in this range [ 1 ] .
the cell density where the cv exceed 20 % is arbitrarily defined as the lower limit of detection ( loq ) , and this has been used to compare analyzers [ 3 ] .
in our previous study using sysmex xe - 5000 , the predecessor of the xn series , the cv in the measurement of csf with a leukocyte density of 7.6 cells / mul was 27.9 % [ 10 ]. by contrast , the cvs for similar samples with xn - hsa was less than 10 % .
this agreed with the detection limits of leukocyte densities reported by fleming et al .
[ 6 ] .
these results indicate that xn - hsa mode can result in greater accuracy for bf laboratory examinations compared to the previous version .
one issue is that the xn - hsa mode requires a larger sample volume ( 200 mul ) than the xn - bf mode ( 88 mul ) .
although this can be problematic if the sample volume is limited , as it can be with csf , further technical improvement is warranted .
feasibility and accuracy of the di - 60 in our study , the results of cell classification in bf samples using di - 60 showed good correlation with manual microscopic examinations for all of the cells except monocytes .
this is likely due to the morphological complexity of monocytes ; the morphology of monocytes is sometimes similar to macrophages since these cells share the same lineage and their morphological changes are continuous .
furthermore , the preparation of cytospin slides has several methodologic limitations [ 12 ] .
for example , the morphologically degenerated cells during the centrifugation procedure to prepare cytospin slides were classified as smudge cells by the di - 60 system , which is another possibility that cause the relatively low correlation in with manual microscopic examination .
poor detection rate of monocytes in body fluid indicates the limitation of morphological examinations .
currently , monocytes can be differentiated using flowcytometry using cd markers .
however , this is an expensive method and lots of labor are required .
to overcome this issue , development of algorithms for more detailed differentiation of mononuclear cells in body fluid by the automated hematology analyzer might offer a possible solution .
although the detection of malignant cells , which is clinically important to determine the appropriate course of treatment , is beyond the scope of this study , we are planning the further studies with larger sample sizes including malignant bf samples .
in addition , we intend to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the novel combining flow - through cellular analysis using the xn - hsa mode with a new gating algorithm and di - 60 digital image analysis for the detection of malignant cells .
there were several limitations to this study .
this was a single center study , the number of samples is relatively small , and the samples did not include any malignancies .
we evaluated the accuracy of xn - hsa and di - 60 by comparing the manual microscopic examination , which is considered the gold standard .
however , manual microscopic examination itself has several limitations including inter - and intra - examiner variance , inconsistent staining , and cell deformities due to the sampling procedure .
for example , whereas the loq we detected for the hsa mode was approximately 5 cells / mul , the loq of the manual microscopic leukocyte counts has been reported to be 10 cells / mul [ 3 ] which is even higher than the one of hsa .
therefore , the comparison among these different methods can be affected by many unavoidable factors .
even considering these limitations , we conclude that the combined use of xn - hsa mode and di - 60 equipped in an automated hematology analyzer can potentially provide physicians with prompt and accurate diagnostic information for the treatment of various diseases .
however , further technological improvement is needed to improve the accuracy of dysmorphic cell detection .

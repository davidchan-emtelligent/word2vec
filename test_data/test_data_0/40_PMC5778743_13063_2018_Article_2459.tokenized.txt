background there are a number of obstacles which may impede the recruitment of underserved populations in clinical research studies ; some of these factors include mistrust of medical research , socioeconomic constraints , cultural factors , and language barriers .
for chronic metabolic disease indications , these barriers may also include lack of disease awareness .
recently , national organizations such as the american diabetes association ( ada ) and centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) have highlighted the need for prediabetes recognition .
therefore the aim of the study was twofold : to raise prediabetes awareness in an under - represented hispanic community and to engage prediabetes participants in clinical research .
methods hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) screening was performed at major outreach events catered to the hispanic community .
all participants signed an ethics review board approved waiver which collected basic demographic information and the hba1c test was performed with a hand - held monitor and finger - stick blood sample .
participants were given their hba1c results at the event as well as information on prediabetes and upcoming clinic studies .
after the event , participants were contacted by a study participant recruiter to assess interest in participating in clinical research .
results the majority of participants screened fell within a prediabetes hba1c range .
mean hba1c was similar among men and women , yet higher in individuals aged 45 - 65 years compared to adults aged < 45 years ( p < 0.05 ) .
for recruitment purposes , the highest number of leads came from participants attending a faith - based community event .
in all , 17 % of individuals contacted expressed interest in participating in clinical research and created a profile within our database to be eligible for future studies .
conclusions providing no - cost hba1c screening is an excellent recruitment tool for clinical research as well as an opportunity to raise prediabetes awareness in a traditionally underserved population .
keywords hemoglobin a1c early clinical studies clinical research organization minority populations hispanic recruitment issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 background the food and drug administration ( fda ) encourages pharmaceutical and biotech companies to enroll participants in clinical trials that are representative of individuals who will likely benefit from the therapeutic drug once approved by the agency .
although a more common practice in late stage clinical trials , a recent trend in this domain is to engage patients early in drug development phase i and phase ii studies to obtain signals of efficacy in a population of interest .
for chronic metabolic disease indications such as type 2 diabetes , this patient population may also include individuals with diabetes risk factors such as obesity and prediabetes .
the incidence of type 2 diabetes and prevalence of these risk factors are commonly observed in under - represented groups such as hispanics , african americans , and native americans [ 1 ] .
a number of studies have shown that genetic , environmental , and socioeconomic factors can all contribute to metabolic diseases in disparate populations [ 2 , 3 ] .
while in the us racial and ethnic minorities comprise roughly 40 % of the population [ 4 ] , the number of disparate individuals enrolling in clinical trials is incredibly low [ 5 ] .
despite initiatives to increase minority participation in publicly funded medical research such as the revitalization act , which was passed in the early 1990s [ 6 ] , the national institutes of health ( nih ) continues to see low minority enrollment rates in clinical studies [ 7 ] .
for instance , african americans represent 13.2 % of the us population yet it is estimated that only 5 % participate in clinical studies .
moreover , hispanics represent 16 % of the general population and only 1 % participate in clinical trials [ 8 ] .
further , in 2012 it was reported that minority participation rates in industry - led clinical studies was estimated to be relatively low at 16.7 % [ 9 ] .
common barriers to the recruitment of an underserved population in medical research include : a mistrust of medical research ; lack of awareness of available studies ; economic constraints ( i.e. loss of wages , need for childcare ) ; language barriers ; lack of transportation ; and failure to meet inclusion criteria [ 10 , 11 ] .
to address these challenges , attention should be focused on education of medical research programs with support from community entities .
for metabolic disease research lines , active community - based recruitment has proven to be a successful strategy [ 12 ] .
within the hispanic community , there are organized health fairs , cultural events , and religious centers that can serve as integral recruitment sources .
the aim of this study was to examine the recruitment efficiency of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes participants at various community events marketed to a hispanic population .
furthermore , to increase prediabetes and type 2 diabetes awareness in a traditionally underserved community , we provided free hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) screening .
hba1c reflects average blood glucose over the past three months and can be used to identify individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes .
methods we attended five major events catered to a hispanic population from may to september 2016 in phoenix , arizona : two health fairs , a church open - house , a cultural street party , and a county exposition .
the event organizers were responsible for advertising the events to the community which included but was not limited to flyers , billboards , tv , radio , social media , and print advertisements .
celerion participated as an exhibitor at these events .
all participants signed a waiver form approved by an ethics review board .
basic demographic data were collected , such as date of birth and ethnicity .
participants were given an explanation of the procedure as well as literature on hba1c and prediabetes .
english and spanish material as well as english - and spanish - speaking staff were available at all events .
the personnel that conducted the screening included nurses , study participant recruiters ( spr ) , and metabolic specialists .
the screening was performed using a hand - held hba1c monitor ( pts diagnostics , indianapolis , in , usa ) with a finger - stick blood sample .
the hba1c monitor has a coefficient of variation of 4.59 % and 5.31 % for a low and high glycated - hemoglobin control solution ( nova - one diagnostic , calabasas , ca , usa ) , respectively .
hba1c results were obtained within 5 min and reported to the participant .
following the ada guidelines [ 13 ] , hba1c values were categorized as healthy (< 5.7 % ; 39 mmol / mol ) , prediabetes ( 5.7 - 6.4 % ; 39 - 46 mmol / mol ) , and diabetes (>= 6.5 % ; 48 mmol / mol ) .
when hba1c values were outside of the healthy range , the participant was encouraged to contact their primary care physician for a diagnosis ; primary care provider information was available for those without a family practitioner .
after the event , a celerion spr made two attempts to contact all screened participants to assess interest in participating in clinical research and documented responses .
the goal of the follow - up calls was to register interested individuals into our participant database for future paid medical research studies .
statistical analysis age and hba1c results are presented as mean and standard deviations ( sd ) , with ranges and sample size ( n ) given .
statistically significant differences were analyzed by unpaired student 's t - test or one - way anova followed by tukey 's post - hoc test as indicated in the figure or table legend .
categorical data such as gender , ethnicity , and diabetes status are presented as sample size ( n ) and percentage (%) with statistical significance determined by chi - squared test with degrees of freedom ( df ) shown ( chi2 df ) .
statistical significance set at p < 0.05 .
results a total of 401 participants expressed an interest in the event and 391 participated in the free hba1c screening .
across all five events , more women signed up for the screening than men , approximately 60 % vs 40 % ( table 1 ) .
the individuals at the church event were , on average , older than those participating at the health fairs or other community events. by design , the majority of participants were of hispanic descent .
hispanic ethnicity was almost exclusively indicated by participants attending the two health fairs , with < 5 % indicating " other " or " unknown. " meanwhile , a more diverse population attended the other community events ( table 1 ) .

hba1c was similar among male and female individuals ( fig. 1a ) as well as hispanic and non - hispanic participants ( fig. 1b ) ; however , it was significantly higher in the 45 - 65 - year age group ( p < 0.05 , fig. 1c ) .
the overall prevalence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes , based on hba1c values , were 33.0 % and 14.8 % , respectively .
the highest incidence of prediabetes was observed at the church and cultural street party events , with ~ 38 % each .
furthermore , type 2 diabetes was more common at health fair 1 , observed in 23 % of the participants ( table 1 ). fig. 1 hba1c values obtained during outreach events .

the contact rate was in the range of 31 - 78 % , with leads generated from the two health fairs having the greatest success in reaching the participants by phone .
overall , from the responses collected at the event and during the outreach calls , 14 % of individuals stated they were interested in participating in clinical research , while 47 % were not ( table 2 ) .
in addition , 19 % expressed they would call back at a later time , 7 % indicated they would go online to create a registration profile , and 2 % requested more information about clinical research participation and available studies .
reasons for not registering during the outreach call included ; scheduling issues ; not having proper identification ; or wanting to discuss with family members first .
a total of 31 participants ( 17 % of all individuals contacted by phone ) created a profile within our database to be able to participate in future clinical studies .
it is interesting to note that four individuals created profiles after the initial contact from our spr team , having time to review our website and information provided about clinical study participation .
the church event was the most successful for recruiting followed by the street party and the county expo ( fig. 2a ) .
leads from the two health fairs resulted in the lowest recruitment rate .
in all , 14 prediabetes and three type 2 diabetes individuals were added to our database through this recruitment initiative ( fig. 2b ) .

( a ) percentage of individual registration during spr calls by event .
( b ) number of healthy , prediabetes , and type 2 diabetes registered participants by event discussion the hba1c screening during outreach events serves two key objectives : raising type 2 diabetes and prediabetes awareness in under - represented communities and assessing interest in paid medical research participation .
in the us , an estimated 9.4 % of the adult population has type 2 diabetes [ 14 ] .
this national average is also similar for the state of arizona , with an estimated 9.1 % of the population diagnosed with diabetes [ 15 ] .
however , here we observed 14.8 % of participants falling within the diabetes range based on the hba1c screening .
we did not collect medical history information at the time of the outreach event and are not able to report the percent of individuals with a known diabetes diagnosis .
both the ada and cdc recommend that screening for undiagnosed diabetes should be managed by a healthcare organization , as they express concerns that community - based screening programs tend to have low yield and poor follow - up , preferring efforts and resources directed to intervention programs [ 16 ] .
nonetheless , it is important to note that one - third of americans have prediabetes , yet only 10 % are aware of their condition [ 14 ] .
taken altogether , these alarming statistics stress the importance of screening events regardless of the sponsoring organization .
coupling lack of prediabetes awareness with little education regarding clinical studies leads to a very narrow overlap of potential participants ; the result is a common challenge for clinical study success and participant recruitment [ 17 ] .
to remedy this , several avenues of solicitation exist such as tv , radio , printed advertisements , and social media ; and clinical research organizations do not rely solely on one medium .
while handing out flyers can be an ineffective recruitment strategy [ 12 , 18 - 20 ] , numerous studies have shown that community - based programs can be highly effective to engage disparate populations in clinical research [ 21 , 22 ]. from a recruitment perspective , we determined that cultural and church events were more successful in registering individuals for paid clinical studies than events marketed as " health fairs. " indeed , the effectiveness of using churches for community outreach recruiting is well documented [ 12 , 23 ] .
one potential reason for this difference in registration rate observed here might be related to the participants' expectations .
for the most part , health fair attendees were strictly seeking medical services .
the two health fairs were designed to support the wellbeing and health of an underserved population , providing a variety of free medical services such as dental health checks , blood pressure testing , and hiv and pregnancy screening .
on the other hand , the community events offered traditional food , music , entertainment , and shopping in a social setting , which may have provided an atmosphere for individuals willing to participate in research .
this small group approach has also been noted to be more effective in other instances of recruitment for difficult to reach populations in contrast to the traditional one - on - one delivery [ 24 ] .
research by ramesy et al. found referrals from friends provided a boon to recruitment with difficult - to - recruit groups [ 25 ] .
given the familial nature of interpersonal community events , it should not be unexpected that the relationship between people might drive interest or referral for others once communal education is presented .
this was noted within our study , multiple individuals of the same family participated in the screen ( personal observation ) .
this group effort provides a unique opportunity for recruitment along with education .
while someone with the condition may not be present , given the prevalence of diabetes , education of a potential family member at the very least can drive a later conversation which could result in treatment or enrollment depending on circumstances .
there are a number of reasons why people are interested in participating in clinical research .
geppert et al. recently described that altruism and receiving ( better ) treatment are chief motivations for diabetes participants who are willing to participate in clinical research .
concerns over risk and aversion to research were cited for those not willing to participate [ 26 ] .
robiner et al. also identified economic burden ( missing work ) , study schedule ( study length and frequency of clinic visits ) , as well as procedural discomfort as major barriers to participating in a diabetes clinical study [ 27 ] .
although here we were not recruiting for a particular study , we were able to gauge the main reason for not registering within our database was unwilling / not interested in clinical research .
other deterrents to registration included scheduling issues and lack of proper identification .
also , many participants were not aware that clinical studies are available for those who do not fall within the " normal healthy " category , such as obese , prediabetes , and type 2 diabetes individuals .
providing education regarding clinical studies and inclusion / exclusion criteria during the screening may encourage more people to participate in clinical research in the future .
a number of study limitations must be addressed .
lack of medical history , anthropometric , or clinical data other than hba1c limits the characterization of the study population to simple demographic analysis .
while , we attempted to capture information why individuals were not willing to participate in clinical research , we did not record the reasons others did register .
understanding both the needs and concerns of potential participants may provide valuable insight for future recruitment strategies .
in addition , only two follow - up calls were made to individuals to engage in recruitment discussions ; these were made shortly after the event was held .
further contact with potential participants may have increased recruitment rates .
conclusion the hba1c screening is an effective recruitment tool , with one new registration for every 13 participants screened .
furthermore , offering free hba1c screening at local health fairs and cultural events can provide an underserved population with a valuable medical service and is an excellent opportunity to raise diabetes awareness and provide education on clinical studies .

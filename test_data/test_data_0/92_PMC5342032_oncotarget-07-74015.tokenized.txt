several fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) isoforms act to stimulate epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) during cancer progression .
fgf4 and fgf7 are two ligands of fgf receptor 2 ( fgfr2 ) .
using two lung adenocarcinoma ( adc ) cell lines , a549 and h1299 , we showed that fgf4 , but not fgf7 , altered cell morphology , promoted emt - associated protein expression , and enhanced cell proliferation , migration / invasion and colony initiation .
in addition , fgf4 increased store - operated calcium entry ( soce ) and expression of the calcium signal - associated protein orai1 .
the soce inhibitor 2,5 - di - tert - butylhydroquinone ( bhq ) or orai1 knockdown reversed all of the emt - promoting effects of fgf4 .
bhq also inhibited fgf4 - induced emt in a mouse xenograft model .
finally , 60 human lung adc samples and 21 sets of matched specimens ( primary and metastatic foci in lymph nodes from one patient ) were used to confirm the clinicopathologic significance of fgf4 and its correlation with e - cadherin , vimentin and orai1 expression .
our study thus shows that fgf4 induces emt by elevating soce in lung adc .
fgf4 epithelial - mesenchymal transition store - operated calcium entry orai1 fgf7 introduction the fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) family consists of at least 23 members .
fgfs are involved in numerous physiological processes , ranging from vertebrate segmentation and elongation of the embryonic axis to skeletal development [ 1 , 2 ] .
fgf overexpression has been linked with the pathogenesis and progression of multiple cancers , including breast , prostate [ 3 ] and lung cancer [ 4 ] .
epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) is a crucial process in cancer progression .
during emt , epithelial cells escape from their origin , gain fibroblastic characteristics , and migrate to distant locations [ 5 , 6 ] .
the emt program is promoted by many soluble growth factors , including fgfs [ 2 , 7 ] .
for example , the activation of the fgfr / mek / erk pathway by fgf2 promotes cell growth and emt in the chordoma [ 8 ] and fgf10 can induce emt of breast cancer cells [ 9 ] .
furthermore , fgf8 can induce a more aggressive phenotype displaying emt and enhanced invasion and growth in colorectal cancer cells [ 10 ] .
takanami et al. measured fgf2 expression in 143 lung adenocarcinoma ( adc ) tissues [ 11 ] and found that high fgf2 expression was a prognostic indicator for unfavorable outcome .
donnem and colleagues showed that high fgf2 expression in non - small - cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) is associated with poor five - year survival [ 4 ] .
li demonstrated that immunoreactive scores of fgf1 were higher in nsclc specimens than in peritumoral normal tissues and patients with high fgf1 expression had a lower overall survival rate [ 12 ] .
nsclc patients with high fgf9 expression were also reported to have a worse prognosis than those with low fgf9 expression [ 13 ] .
fgf signals are transduced through fgf receptors ( fgfrs ) .
alternative splicing of fgfr2 mrna generates the fgfr2 - iiib isoform , which selectively binds fgf7 with high affinity , or the fgfr2 - iiic isoform , which selectively binds fgf4 .
the dedicated ligands for fgfr2 - iiib and fgfr2 - iiic are usually expressed in mesenchymal and epithelial cells , respectively [ 2 , 14 , 15 ] .
a switch from fgfr2 - iiib to fgfr2 - iiic has been reported in the malignant progression of prostate and bladder cancer [ 14 , 16 ] .
in our study , out of the 23 reported fgfs , we focused on fgf4 and fgf7 , the representative fgf ligands for fgfr2 splice variants , and studied their functions in the emt program of lung adc .
emt has been linked with the dysregulation of fgf / fgfr signaling , including mek / erk and pi3k - akt signaling [ 2 , 8 , 17 ] .
in addition , the activation of fgf / fgfr can activate inositol trisphosphate ( ip3 ) , which triggers ca2 + signaling [ 18 ] .
as a ubiquitous secondary messenger , intracellular calcium regulates nearly every aspect of cellular function , including excitability , exocytosis , cytoskeletal reorganization , motility , deformability , and gene expression [ 19 ] .
altered ca2 + homeostasis is also a hallmark of numerous cancers , including breast , prostate , and ovarian cancers [ 6 , 20 - 23 ] .
store - operated calcium entry ( soce ) is responsible for activating ca2 + channels in the plasma membrane following depletion of ca2 + stores .
soce is the foremost pattern for ectocytic ca2 + entry in non - excitable epithelial cells [ 19 , 24 , 25 ] .
the molecular components of soce include the endoplasmic reticulum ca2 + sensors stromal interaction molecule1 ( stim1 ) , stim2 and the store - operated ca2 + channel - forming subunits orai1 , orai2 , and orai3 .
orai1 is recognized as the central component of soce because of it exhibits the highest potency in the conduction of ca2 + currents [ 25 , 26 ] .
although several studies reported that altered soce is linked to egf [ 22 ] and tgf - induced emt [ 27 ] , the effects of soce induced by fgf in emt remain unclear .
in the present study , we show that fgf4 , but not fgf7 , induces emt and promotes proliferation , migration / invasion , and colony initiation in a549 and h1299 lung adc cell lines .
more importantly , we demonstrate that fgf4 induces emt via enhancement of soce in lung adc .
results treatment with fgf4 , but not fgf7 , induces emt , causes a switch from fgfr2 iiib to fgfr2 iiic and changes the morphology and behavior of a549 and h1299 cells to evaluate the effect of fgf4 and fgf7 on promoting emt , a549 and h1299 cells were treated at different concentrations of 0 , 5 , 10 , 25 , and 50 ng / ml for 24 h. as shown in figure 1a , fgf4 decreased e - cadherin and increased vimentin expression in both cell lines .
in addition to the classical emt markers , we also checked the expression of an array of emt transcription factors , including snail , slug , and twist .
these factors could induce emt by directly binding to the e - boxes of the e - cadherin promoter .
among these three factors , snail and twist were upregulated in the cells exposed to fgf4 .
moreover , the emt - promoting effect of fgf4 on both cells was dose - dependent .
in contrast to fgf4 , fgf7 showed no evident influence on the expression of these emt - associated proteins .

except for alterations in epithelial and mesenchymal proteins expression , we also found alterations in cellular morphology and functional phenotypes. by using phalloidin to dye fibrous actin ( f - actin ) , we observed that fgf4 treatment ( 10 ng / m , 24 h ) caused a549 and h1299 cells to form structures with irregular shape and non - uniform composition ( figure 1c ) .
in cck8 assays , we observed that fgf4 could promote cell proliferation as early as the third day ( figure 1d ) .
in migration and invasion assays , significantly more cells passed through the transwell chamber filter when stimulated with fgf4 , compared with control cells ( figure 1e ) .
anchorage - independent growth was increased in cells with fgf4 stimulation ( figure 1f ) .
compared with control cells , fgf7 showed no influence on proliferation , migration / invasion , and colony - initiating ability of a549 and h1299 cells .
fgf4 elevates intracellular calcium concentration and increases the expression of orai1 binding of some fgf ligands to fgfrs induces activation of the downstream intracellular signaling components including mek / erk and pi3k - akt .
however , fgf4 stimulation did not alter the expression of akt , erk and phosphorylated akt and erk , which are key signal transducers downstream of the fgfr ( figure 2a ) .
fgf / fgfr signaling also evokes ca2 + release from calcium stores into the cytosol , which reportedly contributes to the emt process .
we detected orai1 expression and found that orai1 was significantly upregulated after fgf4 treatment in both cell lines ( figure 2a ) .
we further evaluated intracellular calcium concentration by fluo 3 - am as a calcium indicator .
our flow cytometry experiments demonstrated that the mean fluorescence intensity ( mfi ) of the fgf4 group ( 10.16 x 103 ) was significantly higher than the mfi of the control ( 1.5 x 103 ) ( p < 0.01 ) ( figure 2b ) .
the interaction between fgf4 and orai1 was further confirmed by reciprocal co - ip analysis ( figure 2c ) .
furthermore , nvp - bgj398 ( a selective inhibitor of the fgfr ) could restore intracellular calcium concentration and abolish the expression of orai1 caused by fgf4 stimulation ( supplementary figure s1 ) , demonstrating the soce - elevating effect of fgf4 / fgfr signaling .

orai1 knockdown and bhq impair fgf4 - induced emt in a549 and h1299 cells given that soce is the predominant pattern for extracellular ca2 + influx in non - excitable cells , we investigated whether soce contributes to the emt response to fgf4 .
a549 and h1299 cells were transfected with orai1 sirna ( si - 1 , supplementary figure s2 ) for 24 h , and then treated with 10 ng / ml fgf4 .
bhq is an inhibitor of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum ( ca2 + - mg2 +) atpase and functions as an endoplasmic reticulum ca2 + pump inhibitor .
we observed that both orai1 knockdown and bhq could reverse the increased cytosolic ca2 + concentration caused by fgf4 ( figure 3a ) , indicating that orai1 and bhq have an inhibitory effect on ca2 + signaling .
as shown in figure 3b , all mesenchymal factors ( vimentin , snail and twist ) increased due to fgf4 stimulation with contrary expression of epithelial marker ( e - cadherin ) .
western blot showed that either orai1 knockdown or bhq treatment could rescue e - cadherin inhibition and decrease vimentin , snail and twist levels induced by fgf4 ( figure 3b ) , suggesting that soce was involved in fgf4 - induced emt .
to rule out the different si - orai1 variations , we also transfected another orai1 sirna ( si - 2 ) into a549 and h1299 cells and tested the expression of emt - associated proteins by western blot ( supplementary figure s3 ) .
the results were similar to those obtained from orai1 sirna ( si - 1 ) .

a549 and h1299 cells transfected with non - sense control sirna and without fgf4 or bhq treatment were used as controls. a. the level of intracellular ca2 + using fluo 3 - am was measured by flow cytometry. b. the expression of emt - associated proteins ( e - cadherin , vimentin , snail and twist ) was detected by western blot .

bhq and orai1 knockdown induce restoration of epithelial phenotype , impair migration and invasion , and inhibit cell growth in monolayer cultures and anchorage - independent growth in soft agar of a549 and h1299 cells we next assessed whether fgf4 - induced mesenchymal cell features could be blocked by soce inhibition .
as expected , either bhq or orai1 knockdown changed the morphology of a549 and h1299 cells from a spindle - like shape to a cobble stone - like shape ( figure 4a ) , inhibited cell growth in monolayer cultures ( figure 4b ) , migration / invasion ( figure 4c ) , and colony - initiation ( figure 4d ) in a549 and h1299 cells with fgf4 treatment .

bhq inhibits in vivo tumor growth and metastasis caused by fgf4 in a h1299 xenograft mouse model , induces e - cadherin expression , and decreases the expression of orai1 and vimentin in tumor tissues using the highly metastatic h1299 lung adc cells , we made a mouse xenograft model to assess the effect of bhq on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo .
in accordance with our in vitro findings , cells with fgf4 treatment grew into larger tumor masses than control cells and cells with fgf4 + bhq treatment ( figure 5a ). of the 10 mice injected with cells with fgf4 stimulation , two showed lung metastasis , two showed intravascular thrombus and three showed tumor invasion into skeletal muscle ( figure 5b ) , whereas no metastasis sites were detected in mice injected with control cells and cells with fgf4 + bhq treatment .
we then performed fgf4 , orai1 , e - cadherin , vimentin and ki - 67 immunohistochemical staining on the sections of xenograft tissues .
immunohistochemical analyses showed that tumor sections from fgf4 - stimulated cells exhibited a marked increase in orai1 whereas tumor sections from control and fgf4 + bhq - stimulated cells revealed no or weak staining .
moreover , compared with control cells , fgf4 - treated cells showed decreased e - cadherin expression and increased vimentin and ki - 67 expression .
bhq reversed fgf4 - induced expression of emt - associated proteins , including e - cadherin and vimentin ( figure 5c ) .
these results substantiate our findings that fgf4 induces soce enhancement , which contributes to promoting the emt process in lung adc cells .

association of fgf4 expression with clinicopathological features of lung adc cases the expression patterns of fgf4 were examined on an array of 60 human lung adc cases .
among 60 samples , 38 ( 63.3 %) showed positive fgf4 expression .
tumors were categorized as strong (++) , weak (+) , or negative ( - ) expression for fgf4 .
relationships between fgf4 levels and each clinicopathological parameter are summarized in table 1 .
fgf4 expression was strongly correlated with histological type ( p < 0.05 ) , tnm stages ( p < 0.05 ) , and metastasis ( p < 0.05 ) .
the frequency of positive fgf4 expression was higher in solid predominant and micropapillary predominant samples than in ones with other histological types .
positive fgf4 expression was observed in 11 of 13 patients ( 84.6 %) with advanced stage carcinomas ( tnm stages iii and iv ) , and in 27 of 47 patients ( 57.4 %) with early - stage carcinomas ( tnm stages i and ii ) .
a total of 23 ( 38.3 %) lung adc patients experienced metastasis .
the patients with positive fgf4 expression had a higher rate of metastasis ( 19 / 38 , 50.0 %) than those with negative fgf4 expression ( 4 / 22 , 18.2 %) .
no correlations were found between fgf4 expression level and patient age or gender , tumor size or location .
interestingly , we observed differences in fgf4 expression within tumors , with strong fgf4 expression observed in tumor cells located close to stroma ( figure 6a ) .
we also analyzed fgf4 expression in 21 sets of matched specimens ( including lung adc primary foci and lymph node metastatic foci ) obtained from one patient to gain a better picture of fgf4 expression in the lung adc progression .
table 2 and figure 6b show that fgf4 expression in the lymph node metastatic foci was higher than in the primary foci ( p < 0.05 ) , implying that fgf4 may be involved in the emt process of lung adc cells .

expression of fgf4 is concomitant with emt immunohistochemical features and orai1 expression to further assess the relationship between fgf4 and emt in human lung adc tissues , we investigated the expression of e - cadherin and vimentin .
as shown in table 3 and figure 7a , the fgf4 - negative group showed higher e - cadherin expression ( p < 0.05 ) and lower vimentin expression ( p < 0.05 ) than the weakly and strongly positive groups , thereby confirming the emt - promoting effect of fgf4 on lung adc .

orai1 expression was higher ( p < 0.05 ) in the samples with weakly and strongly positive fgf4 expression than in those with negative fgf4 expression ( table 4 and figure 7b ) .
these findings suggested that fgf4 may induce emt by elevating soce .

discussion lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer - associated death worldwide .
adc accounts for almost 40 % of all lung malignancies and its incidence has rapidly increased in recent years [ 12 ] .
several targeted drugs against growth factors or their receptor tyrosine kinases have been used to treat adc [ 4 , 11 - 13 , 28 - 30 ] ; however , the prognosis of patients remains dismal .
a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the development and progression of lung adc might facilitate the development of novel treatment strategies that improve patient prognosis .
fgf / fgfr signaling is involved in many physiological and pathological processes .
in general , fgfrs encoding exon iiib ( fgfr - iiib ) are expressed in epithelial cells , whereas fgfrs encoding exon iiic ( fgfr - iiic ) are expressed in mesenchymal cells [ 7 , 14 , 16 , 31 ] .
in emt , fgfr2 - iiib switches to fgfr2 - iiic .
fgf4 , which binds fgfr2 - iiic with high affinity , was previously reported to be highly expressed in advanced - stage and poor - prognosis cases of serous ovarian cancer [ 32 ] .
fgf7 , which exerts its biological effects by binding to fgfr - iiib , was observed to promote tumor angiogenesis and migration of pancreatic cancer [ 33 ] .
in this study , we found that fgf4 , but not fgf7 , could downregulate e - cadherin expression and upregulate the expression of vimentin and the two emt transcription factors snail and twist .
we also demonstrated that fgf4 treatment could cause a switch from fgfr2 - iiib to fgfr2 - iiic .
except for altering the expression of differentiation proteins , fgf4 can induce cancer cells to be more mesenchymal - like and enhance their proliferation , invasion / migration , and colony initiation abilities .
experiments conducted on human lung adc tissue samples showed that fgf4 expression was relatively high in lymph - node metastatic foci and in lung adc tissues with metastasis .
mouse experiments also indicated that fgf4 treatment may induce tumor metastasis .
immunohistochemical staining of human and mice tissue samples demonstrated that fgf4 could induce a phenotype displaying emt .
these results were consistent with a previous study , in which fgf4 was found to maintain trophoblast stem cells under undifferentiating , self - renewing conditions and display decreased e - cadherin expression and increased slug and twist expression [ 34 ] .
following fgf binding and receptor dimerization , downstream components including akt and erk kinases are activated to initiate several signaling pathways .
fgf / fgfr signaling also confers selective and strong binding to phospholipase cc for the catalysis of phosphatidylinositol diphosphate to generate two effectors , namely , diacylglycerol and ip3 [ 1 , 2 , 17 , 19 ] .
ip3 then binds to the ip3 receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and evokes ca2 + release from calcium stores into the cytosol .
once the stim protein senses a ca2 + level drop in the endoplasmic reticulum , it binds with orai channels and elicits ca2 + influx .
this process is known as soce [ 19 , 25 , 26 , 35 ] .
in this study , we observed that the expression of phosphorylated akt and erk in fgf4 - stimulated cells were not increased compared with control cells .
on the other hand , fgf4 treatment remarkably upregulated orai1 expression and elevated the intracellular calcium concentration .
in the human lung adc tissue samples , we observed higher levels of orai1 expression in the fgf4 strong expression group than in the weak and negative expression groups .
a similar result was observed in the mouse xenograft model .
this suggests that fgf4 may exert its emt - promoting effect by elevating soce and not through the akt and erk signaling pathways .
we also showed that either soce pharmacological inhibitor bhq or orai1 knockdown could abrogate the induction of the emt response to fgf4 in vitro .
furthermore , bhq could restrained tumor formation and metastasis in an mouse xenograft model .
all of these results indicated that fgf4 - induced emt correlates with enhancement of soce .
soce promotes malignant phenotypes [ 19 ] and reduces the production of vegf , tissue factor and cox - 2 ( which are essential for angiogenesis ) in cancer cells [ 26 , 36 ] .
aberrant soce induces directional migration and inhibition of soce results in the upregulation of p21 and the downregulation of cdc25c , cycline , cyclind , cdck2 , and cdck4 , which eventually elicit cell - cycle arrest [ 37 ] .
the clinical diagnostic and prognostic potential of orai1 and stim1 have also been demonstrated in many cancer types , including prostate cancer , melanoma , nsclc , and colorectal cancer [ 19 , 26 ] .
soce has been reported to be involved in tgf - beta or egf - induced emt in breast cancer cells [ 27 , 21 ] .
similarly , here we report that soce helps to drive the fgf4 - induced emt program .
however , inconsistent results have been reported .
a study by niu et al. showed that fgf7 stimulates cell proliferation in pancreatic ductal epithelial cells [ 38 ] .
according to previous reports , fgfs exert different actions depending on the type and origin of cells examined [ 39 ] .
future studies assessing the precise function of fgfs and their receptors in the emt and tumor progression are needed .
on the other hand , our results contradict a recent study by davis et al. , who demonstrated that egf - induced emt in mda - mb - 468 breast cancer cells was associated with reduced soce [ 40 ] .
in addition to fgf4 / fgfr signaling , several other signaling pathways ( e.g. , tgfbeta , egf , notch , wnt ) have also been shown to induce emt [ 5 , 22 , 41 , 42 ] .
interestingly , some of these pathways are found among the functional gene sets associated with fgf / fgfr signaling and soce regulation .
future investigations may reveal how soce changes in emt induced by alternative cytokines and signaling pathways .

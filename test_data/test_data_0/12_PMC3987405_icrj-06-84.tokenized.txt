objective the aim of the present investigation was to explore probable association of renal artery stenosis ( ras ) with coronary artery disease ( cad ) and the prevalence of renal artery stenosis ( ras ) in patients with cad .
patients and methods this study comprised 165 consecutive patients with cad , including 52.7 % males and 47.2 % females with respective mean ages of 60.3 +/ - 8.9 and 59.5 +/ - 10.1 .
the patients underwent simultaneous coronary and renal angiographies , and the lumen reduction of 50 % or more was considered as significant stenosis .
indeed , stenosis of more than 70 % of the arterial lumen was regarded as severe .
results according to our findings , the prevalence of renal artery stenosis in our hypertensive and normotensive patients were 46.2 % and 19.5 % respectively ( p = 0.002 ) .
renal artery angiography revealed that 64 ( 38.8 %) of the patients had simultaneous renal artery stenosis .
ras is more common in females than males ( p = 0.031 ) .
multivariate analysis revealed that among all examined factors , hypertension and serum creatinine were associated with ras .
there was no correlations found between gensini score and ras ( p = 0.63 ) .
conclusion we found a relatively high prevalence of ras including 46.2 % in hypertensive and 19.5 % in normotensive patients in our patients with cad .
coronary artery disease renal artery stenosis hypertension introduction atherosclerosis is a diffuse process characterized by functional and morphologic changes of the arterial wall including endothelial dysfunction , increased wall thickness and progressive plaque formation ( 1,2 ) .
although the disease begins early in life it has no symptoms for a long period of time .
it usually affects main arteries of body including the coronary , carotid , and renal arteries .
the initial clinical presentation of coronary artery disease ( cad ) may be abrupt due to plaque rupture with varying amounts of superimposed thrombus , vasoconstriction , and distal embolization , leading to acute coronary events , such as angina pectoris ( ap ) or myocardial infarction ( mi ) ( 3 - 5 ) .
as mentioned above , atherosclerosis can occurs in renal arteries leading to renal artery stenosis which is an important cause of secondary hypertension and also a main reason for renal failure in elderly .
as investigated , 60 - 97 % of renal artery stenosis in different areas are due to atherosclerosis ( 6,7 ) and 10 - 20 % of all reported end stage renal diseases have a background of renal ischemia ( 7,8 ) .
angiography is the gold standard method for evaluation of stenosis in arteries in which it is used widely for detecting coronary artery obstruction ( 1 ) .
it is shown that most of the renal artery stenosis is clinically silent , and according to large scale studies about 15 % of patients with cad have concurrent renal artery stenosis , thus it is suggested by some authors that cad may be a strong predictor for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis ( 9 - 11 ) .
considering the importance of these indolent lesions , the present study attempted to explore the prevalence of renal artery stenosis and its probable association with cad .
patients and methods between september 2010 and may 2011 , 165 consecutive patients with cad admitted to our department for coronary angiography were enrolled in this study .
all the patients were selected and underwent coronary angiography according to american heart association and american college of cardiology ( aha / acc ) guidelines .
renal angiography was also performed in all patients and during one session using a siemens highcore system ( siemens company , germany ) .
all coronary angiographic examinations were performed by the seldinger technique through femoral artery access .
angiographies were carried out in several views that best displayed the lesion and enabled stenosis grade evaluation .
intra - arterial systolic and diastolic pressures of the ascending aorta were measured during cardiac catheterization .
in patients with creatinine level 1.5 mg / dl or less and significant coronary artery disease , abdominal aortography was conducted using a pigtail catheter with a pump injector .
whenever difficult to evaluate the degree of stenosis , selective renal arteriography was performed with a right 6 or 7 french judkins catheter in the anterior - posterior , and when necessary in oblique projection .
lumen reduction of 50 % and more was considered as significant stenosis .
indeed , stenosis more than 70 % of the arterial lumen was considered as severe stenosis .
all angiograms were analyzed by an experienced interventional cardiologist and together with another analyst who reviewed the angiograms reached a consensus .
patients were classified as having single vessel disease ( 1vd ) , two vessles disease ( 2vd ) and three vessels disease ( 3vd ) if they had a significant stenosis in 1 , 2 , and 3 major epicardial coronary vessels . left main lesions counted as 2vd were considered present when luminal diameter was reduced by 50 % .
fasting blood sugar ( fbs ) , serum total cholesterol , low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl ) , high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hdl ) , triglycerides ( tg ) and creatinine were measured in all patients ( bt 3000 , biotecnica instruments , rome , italy ) .
hypercholesterolemia denoted total serum cholesterol more than 240 ( mg / dl ) , and hypertriglyceridemia indicated triglycerides more than 200 ( mg / dl ) .
high ldl and low hdl were defined as more than 160 ( mg / dl ) , and less than 35 ( mg / dl ) respectively .
patients with blood pressures higher than 140 / 90 mmhg or documented history of hypertension or antihypertensive therapy were considered as hypertensive .
serum creatinine level <= 1.4 mg / dl considered as normal value and patients with creatinine level > 1.5 excluded from this study as well as patients who had undergone previous renal or coronary revascularization .
gensini 's score was also calculated for each patient as previously described ( 12 ) .
patients with fbs greater than 126 mg / dl or documented history of medication for diabetes mellitus ( dm ) were considered as diabetic .
demographic data including age and related family history of cad were also collected using a standard questionnaire .
an established positive family history ( fh ) for cad was based on a known history of cad in a first - degree relative male or female aged less than 55 and 65 years .
the study was approved by tehran university of medical sciences ethics committee , and written informed consent was obtained from all patients willing to participate in the study .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using spss version 16.0.1 ( spss inc. , chicago , il , u.s.a. ) .
normality of data was evaluated with the kolmogorov - smirnov test .
the results were expressed as mean +/ - sd for parametric and mean +/ - sem for nonparametric data .
the statistical differences between proportions were determined by chi2 analysis .
numerical data were evaluated using analysis of variance , followed by tukey 's post hoc test .
p value less than 0.05 was considered as significant .
pearson and spearman correlation tests were used for parametric and nonparametric numeric data analysis respectively .
results among 165 patients 52.7 % were males and 47.2 % females with respective mean ages of 60.3 +/ - 8.9 and 59.5 +/ - 10.1 years , and without any statistically significant difference between them. of the patients under study,71 ( 43 %) had diabetes mellitus ( dm ) , 119 ( 72.1 %) were hypertensive ( htn ) , 129 ( 78.2 %) had hyperlipidemia ( hlp ) , 63 ( 38.2 %) were cigarette smokers and 38 ( 23 %) had family history of cad .
patients' creatinine level was 1.15 +/ - 0.2. of 165 ( 6.1 %) patients,10 ( 6.1 %) had creatinine levels higher than normal range .
table 1 shows detailed demographic data of all patients .

seven patients ( 4.2 %) had more than 50 % stenosis in left main coronary artery that categorized as 2 vessels in absence of significant right coronary stenosis and 3 vessels with significant right coronary stenosis or left side dominancy .
renal artery angiography revealed that 64 ( 38.8 %) of the patients had simultaneous renal artery stenosis which in 26 patients it was in the right renal artery , 26 in the left and 12 ( 7.3 %) in both renal arteries .
ras was present in 64 patients , which was severe in 26 ( 40.6 %) .
results showed that ras is more common in females than males ( p = 0.031 ) .
there was no relationship found between the number of stenotic coronary arteries and ras severity ( p > 0.05 ) .
also no correlations were observed between severity of coronary artery disease ( gensini 's score ) and renal artery stenosis ( p = 0.63 ) the means systolic and diastolic blood pressures of patients which measured during angiography were 151.7 +/ - 27.5 and 82 +/ - 12.5 respectively .
there was no significant difference between the mean age of patients with or without ras ( p = 0.9 ). however , the mean age of patients with htn was significantly higher than normotensive patients ( p < 0.001 ) , and the stratifying data for ras revealed the same result , showing that the mean age of patients with htn was significantly higher than normotensive patients in both ras and non - ras patients ( p = 0.001 ) .
also the prevalence of ras in hypertensive patients was more than normotensive patients ( p = 0.002 ) .
indeed , patients with ras had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures and serum creatinine level with respective p values of 0.009 , 0.006 and < 0.001 .
as described above , we showed a total prevalence of 38.8 % ras in our patients .
the prevalence of ras in our hypertensive and normotensive patients were 46.2 % and 19.5 % respectively .
the patients' ejection fraction ( ef ) was 54.2 % +/ - 9.9 .
multivariate analysis revealed that among all factors examined , hypertension and serum creatinine were associated with ras , where in patients with cad , higher blood pressure and higher serum creatinine levels are predisposing factors ( p = 0.009 and p = 0.03 , respectively ) .
there was no association between ras and dm , hlp , smoking or family history with respective p values of 0.23 , 0.15 , 0.13 and 0.87 .
the mean value of gensini score was 36.1 +/ - 2.6 .
analysis showed that serum creatinine level and cardiac ef was correlated with gensini scores ( p = 0.002 , correlation coefficient = 0.24 and p < 0.001 , correlation coefficient = - 0.4 , respectively ) .
however , no correlations were found between gensini 's score and ras percentage , ras , systolic or diastolic blood pressure ( table 2 ) .

recent studies indicated that ras was not a rare finding in patients with coronary artery disease and our results showed that about 39 % of our patients with cad had ras besides cad .
considering htn , our results showed that the prevalence of ras in patients with no history of htn was about 19.5 % .
this finding was compatible with other studies reporting such prevalence rate as 15.7 % to 42 % .
some of these studies have used non - invasive methods to determine the prevalence of ras and this is one of the reasons for high ras prevalence found in their patients .
however , some other studies showed lower prevalence of ras ( 7,9,13,14 ) .
our results showed that ras was more common in females than males , which is compatible with another study ( 15 ) .
however , additional investigation indicated that male gender was an independent pedictor of ras ( 16 ) .
our results revealed that the means of systolic and diastolic blood pressures and serum creatinine level were higher in ras than in those without ras .
also the prevalence of hypertension was higher in ras patients .
some studies demonstrated that ras was usually indolent and most of the patients with ras were not hypertensive .
although in our study the patients with ras had significantly higher blood pressures , nevertheless we also found a high prevalence of ras among normotensive patients .
multivariate analysis revealed that there was strong association of ras with hypertension and serum creatinine level .
a trend towards a significant relationship between hypertension and the presence of ras has previously been established .
hypertension was shown to be a risk factor for ras as well as a possible clinical manifestation of the activated renin angiotensin system secondary to ras ( 13,17 ) .
high serum creatinine level is an indicator of renal insufficiency .
previous studies have shown the association between ras and renal insufficiency based on creatinine clearance ( 18 ) , which is consistent with our findings .
as renovascular disease can lead to ischemic nephropathy or end stage renal disease , high prevalence of ras can cause significant mortality and morbidity ( 19 ) .
our study showed no association between the number of coronary involved vessels and the severity of the ras but there are some studies showing significant association between them ( 13 ) .
association between age and ras was not seen in our study which was shown elsewhere ( 13,20 ) .
some studies have introduced cad as a strong predictor for ras ( 1 ) .
in the current study , although we found a high prevalence of ras in cad patients regardless of hypertension , no relationship was found between gensini score and ras .
gensini score is previously described as a determinant of coronary artery disease severity ( 12 ) .
some studies showed an association between the number of cardiac atherosclerotic vessels and ras ( 21 ) .
in this connection , the presence of more than 2 significant coronary lesions is recognized as an independent predictor of ras ( 20 ) .
our data revealed no association between ras and dm , hlp , family history of cad or smoking .
these findings are in line with other studies ( 15,22 ) .
the limitation of our study was that it was performed on a group of patients with confirmed cad , thus the results obtained cannot be extrapolated to other patients with peripheral vascular atherosclerosis without any evidence of cad .
we found a relatively high prevalence of ras , 46.2 % in hypertensive and 19.5 % in normotensive patients , in our patients with cad .
this finding underlines the importance of further awareness of renal function in patients with cad .
more studies are suggested to determine the relationship between cad , ras and htn , in order to avoid ras mortality and morbidities among cad patients .
concurrent renal and coronary angiographies might be of benefit to those with history of hypertension and higher creatinine levels and the patients with increased intra - arterial systolic and diastolic pressures detected during the procedure .
this investigation is based on a thesis submitted to tehran university of medical sciences .
implication for health policy / practice / research / medical education : this study is intended to figure out clinical predictors of renal artery stenosis in patients undergoing coronary angiography .

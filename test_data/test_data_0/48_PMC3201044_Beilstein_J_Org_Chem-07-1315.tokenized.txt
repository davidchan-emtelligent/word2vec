the optimization and scope of this reaction are discussed , and the utility of this process is demonstrated in the one - pot preparation of a number of chiral diols as well as a short synthesis of the chiral ligand vivol .
chiral diol directed ortho - metalation hydrobenzoin this article is part of the thematic series " directed aromatic functionalization " .
introduction the discovery of new chiral ligands and auxiliaries continues to expand the frontiers of catalytic asymmetric synthesis .
in particular , c 2 - symmetric diols , such as ( s ) - binol ( 1 ) [ 1 ] and ( - ) - taddol ( 2 ) [ 2 ] ( fig. 1 ) , have garnered considerable attention owing to the wide variety of asymmetric reactions promoted by these ligands and / or their derivatives .
although hydrobenzoin ( e.g. , 3 ) has not been utilized to the same extent , it has also demonstrated utility as both a chiral ligand [ 3 - 8 ] and auxiliary [ 9 - 17 ] .
for example , hall reported that the hydrobenzoin.sncl4 complex 5 promotes the allylboration of hydrocinnamaldehyde with modest enantioselectivity ( 26 % ee ) [ 3 ] , and a hydrobenzoin - ytterbium complex was found to catalyze asymmetric aldol / evans - tishchenko reactions [ 5 ] .
moreover , the hydrobenzoin dimethyl ether 7 was shown to direct the asymmetric addition of organolithium reagents to arene tricarbonylchromium complexes [ 7 ] and alpha,beta - unsaturated aldimines [ 8 ] .
notably , derivatives of hydrobenzoin in which the aromatic rings have been functionalized in the ortho and ortho ' positions often display improved diastereo - or enantioselectivity over the parent diol 3 [ 3,14 ] .
for example , the addition of cyclooctyl rings to the ortho and ortho ' positions of the hydrobenzoin.sncl4 complex ( i.e. , vivol.sncl4 ( 6 )) leads to a dramatic improvement in enantioselectivity in the allylboration of hydrocinnamaldehyde ( 93 % ee ) [ 3 ] .
unfortunately , while ( r,r ) - and ( s,s ) - hydrobenzoin are relatively inexpensive [ 18 ] , or can be readily prepared on kilogram - scale from trans - stilbene through sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation ( sad ) [ 19 - 20 ] , the synthesis of ortho,ortho ' - functionalized derivatives of hydrobenzoin typically requires several steps that include mcmurry coupling of an ortho - substituted benzaldehyde followed by i2 - catalyzed isomerization of the resulting stilbene and subsequent sad [ 21 - 22 ] .
thus , while various hydrobenzoin derivatives have been reported , their multi - step synthesis , the modest enantioselectivity in the sad step [ 22 ] , the problems associated with their optical enrichment [ 6 ] , and the necessary determination of optical purity for each derivative , all complicate the rapid preparation of congeneric libraries .
to address these issues , we recently reported a new process for the direct functionalization of ( r,r ) - hydrobenzoin ( 3 ) [ 23 ] through a directed ortho,ortho ' - dimetalation strategy in which the alcohol functions in hydrobenzoin are deprotonated by n - buli and the resulting lithium benzyl alkoxides serve as directed metalation groups ( dmgs ) [ 24 - 28 ] and facilitate formation of the tetralithio intermediate 8 .
herein , we provide a detailed account of this work as well as the application of these methods to a short synthesis of the chiral diol vivol ( 4 ) .

results and discussion as indicated in scheme 1 , the optimized conditions for the directed ortho,ortho ' - dimetalation of ( r,r ) - hydrobenzoin ( 3 ) involve the treatment of a solution of 3 under reflux with an excess ( 6 equiv ) of n - buli , followed after 16 h by treatment with an electrophile [ 23 ] .
the optimization of this process relied on a series of d2o quenching studies and analysis of the 1h nmr and mass spectra derived from the crude reaction products .
these studies led to the eventual selection of a 2:1 mixture of hexane / ether as the most favorable reaction solvent for the formation of the tetralithio intermediate 8 [ 23 ] .
scheme 1 directed ortho,ortho ' - dimetalation of ( r,r ) - hydrobenzoin ( 3 ) .
despite the high level of deuterium incorporation ( 92 %) observed in the reaction of the tetralithio intermediate 8 with d2o ( scheme 1 ) , this result was not observed for reactions with other electrophiles ( see below ) .
in addition , the products from deuterium quenching studies were often accompanied by the formation of varying amounts of the deoxybenzoin 10 , which presumably derives from reaction of an alkoxide function in 8 with d2o , followed by deuteroxide elimination / enolate formation and subsequent reactions with d2o .
bearing this in mind , the directed ortho,ortho ' - dimetalation of hydrobenzoin was reinvestigated using i2 as the electrophile quench .
as indicated in table 1 , the use of stoichiometric ( i.e. , 4 equiv , entry 1 ) amounts of n - buli led to low isolated yields of the diiodohydrobenzoin 12 .
successively increasing the equivalents of n - buli resulted in approximate increases of 15 % in the isolated yield of 12 , with a maximum yield of roughly 50 % achieved when 6 equiv of n - buli were employed ( entries 2 and 4 ) .
although the use of 8 equiv of n - buli led to a slightly higher isolated yield of 12 ( 53 %) , and only 8 hours were required for the formation of the tetralithio intermediate ( entries 6 and 7 ) , the conditions identified in entry 4 require fewer equivalents of base and electrophile and were consequently selected as the optimal reaction conditions [ 23 ] .
notably , addition of tmeda ( entries 3 and 5 ) , which would presumably assist in the disaggregation of organolithium species , failed to improve these results and in fact led to lower conversion and isolated yields of the diiodohydrobenzoin 12 .

fnot determined .
during the evaluation of the reaction of the tetralithio intermediate 8 with i2 ( table 1 ) , we were surprised to find that monoiodohydrobenzoin 11 was produced in equivalent or lower yield than the diiodohydrobenzoin 12 , even at low overall conversion ( e.g. , table 1 , entries 1 and 2 ) .
these results suggested that the rate - limiting step in the formation of the tetralithio intermediate 8 may be the first dom ( i.e. , formation of a trilithio intermediate ) and that the second dom event is relatively more rapid .
to gain further insight into this process , the reaction of ( r,r ) - hydrobenzoin ( 3 ) with n - buli followed by treatment with d2o [ 23 ] or ch3i was monitored by mass spectrometry and 1h nmr spectroscopy , respectively .
as indicated in fig. 2 , the results of the d2o quenching study were in accordance with our original observation : a relatively slow removal of the first ortho proton is followed by a second , more rapid dom event .

when the progress of the sequential ortho - metalations was monitored by quenching with ch3i , however , the difference in rates was not as pronounced , and only in the case where the formation of the tetralithio intermediate 8 was allowed 6 hours at reflux was the proportion of mono - and dimethylhydrobenzoin ( i.e. , 14 and 15 ) equivalent .
it is notable that the differing results depicted in fig. 2 and fig. 3 may be attributed to intra - or intermolecular deprotonation of the o - tolyl group following reaction of the tetralithio intermediate 8 with one equiv of ch3i , leading to the formation of misleading amounts of the monomethylhydrobenzoin 14 , or simply differing reactivity of the tetralithio intermediate with d2o and ch3i .
figure 3 percentage of methylhydrobenzoin ( 14 ) (*) , and dimethylhydrobenzoin ( 15 ) ( delta ) as determined by 1h nmr spectroscopy .
the remainder of the material is recovered ( r,r ) - hydrobenzoin ( 3 ) .
a possible explanation for the differing rates of dom events observed during the d2o quenching studies is depicted in scheme 2 [ 29 ] .
thus , following the first ortho - metalation , the intermediate aryl lithium 17 ( presumably in an aggregated form ) may adopt a conformation in which the lithium alkoxide ( dmg ) and consequently the base ( i.e. , n - buli or its aggregates ) are positioned in close proximity to the ortho proton that is to be removed .
alternatively , the intermediate aryl lithium 17 may undergo rearrangement to the six - membered heterocycle 18 , in which the cis - relationship between the distal lithium alkoxide and the unlithiated phenyl ring facilitates the second deprotonation .
while the latter proposal is less likely , based on seebach 's observation that 2 - phenylethanol does not undergo ortho - lithiation [ 30 ] , reaction of the tetralithio intermediate 8 with dimethyldichlorosilane led to the formation of the bis ( siloxane ) 19 ( not the 5 - membered ring bis ( siloxane ) isomer ) , whose structure was unambiguously confirmed by x - ray crystallographic analysis ( see scheme 2 , inset ) .
scheme 2 formation of the tetralithio intermediate 8 and the x - ray crystal structure of the bis ( siloxane ) 19 .
as indicated in scheme 3 , formation of the tetralithio intermediate 8 and subsequent reaction with various electrophiles led to synthetically useful yields of ortho - functionalized hydrobenzoin derivatives [ 23 ] .
in each case , approximately 5 - 10 % of the corresponding monofunctionalized hydrobenzoin ( e.g. , 14 , fig. 3 ) was also produced , but was readily separable from the desired product by flash chromatography .
unfortunately , reaction of the tetralithio intermediate 8 with carbonyl electrophiles ( e.g. , acetone , acetaldehyde , diethyl carbonate , valeraldehyde , cyclohexanal , crotonaldehyde , formaldehyde , dmf , benzaldehyde ) , trimethylsilyl chloride , or allyl / benzyl chloride / bromide failed to provide the desired products in reasonable yield .
for example , treatment of the tetralithio intermediate 8 with benzyl chloride resulted in recovery of ( r,r ) - hydrobenzoin along with 1 - chloro - 1,2 - diphenylethane , the latter of which arises through the deprotonation of benzyl chloride by 8 and reaction of the resulting benzyl anion with a second equivalent of benzyl chloride .
likewise , attempts to effect a reductive coupling of the tetralithio intermediate to afford the dihydrophenanthrenediol 23 [ 22 ] with the aid of various copper or iron halides [ 31 ] , or palladium ( ii ) chloride [ 32 ] were unsuccessful .
in an effort to fine - tune the procedure by attenuating the reactivity of the tetralithio intermediate 8 , transmetalation with zncl2 or mgbr2 followed by treatment with various electrophiles was also investigated .
disappointingly , these efforts failed to offer any improvement in the coupling of 8 with dmf , benzaldehyde , or allyl bromide and consequently we focused our attention on reactions of the readily available diiodohydrobenzoin 12 and bis ( benzoxaborol ) 20 .
scheme 3 reaction of the tetralithio intermediate 8 with various electrophiles .
as highlighted in scheme 4 , attempts to directly engage diiodohydrobenzoin 12 in cu - catalyzed c - n cross - coupling reactions [ 33 ] led only to the formation of cis - 4b,9b - dihydrobenzofuro [ 3,2 - b ] benzofuran ( 24 ) [ 34 ] .
consequently , the diol 12 was converted to the corresponding acetonide 25 or methyl ether 26 prior to cross - coupling .
in this manner , the diphenylhydrobenzoin derivative 27 could be accessed in excellent overall yield [ 3,23 ] .
alternatively , lithium - halogen exchange carried out on diiodohydrobenzoins 25 or 26 , followed by reaction with various electrophiles affords access to a wider array of hydrobenzoin derivatives than those highlighted above in scheme 3 [ 17 ] .
for example , electrophiles such as tmscl and dichlorodimethylsilane engage in high yielding reactions with the dianions 28 and 29 to provide the silyl - functionalized hydrobenzoin derivatives 30 - 33 .
scheme 4 reactions of the diiodohydrobenzoin 12 and x - ray crystal structure of the dihydrosilepin 31 .
the bis ( benzoxaborol ) 20 also proved to be a versatile intermediate for the synthesis of hydrobenzoin derivatives through pd - catalyzed cross - coupling reactions ( scheme 5 ) .
this approach compliments those described above and avoids the need to protect the diol function prior to the cross - coupling step .
notably , purification of the bis ( benzoxaborol ) 20 proved unnecessary as the diphenylhydrobenzoin 34 was prepared in an overall yield of 32 % from ( r,r ) - hydrobenzoin ( 3 ) without purification of 20 , compared to 21 % when the intermediate bis ( benzoxaborol ) 20 was purified by column chromatography [ 23 ] .
finally , the efficiency of this process was demonstrated in a short formal synthesis of ( r,r ) - vivol ( 4 ) .
thus , a pd - catalyzed cross - coupling of the known triflate 35 [ 35 ] with the bis ( benzoxaborol ) 20 afforded the dicyclooctenylhydrobenzoin 36 , which was reduced in quantitative yield to afford vivol ( 4 ) by hall [ 3 ] .
notably , this three - step procedure for the preparation of optically pure vivol compares well with the reported synthesis and should be effective for the rapid production of new ligands for asymmetric synthesis .
scheme 5 cross coupling reactions of the bis ( benzoxaborol ) 20 and a short formal synthesis of ( r,r ) - vivol ( 4 ) .
conclusion in conclusion , an efficient and economical process was developed for the direct functionalization of hydrobenzoin that relies on a directed ortho,ortho ' - dimetalation strategy .
importantly , a wide variety of chiral diols ( e.g. , vivol ( 4 )) are now readily accessible in optically pure form following this one - pot reaction .
although the range of electrophiles that engage in synthetically useful reactions with the tetralithio intermediate 8 is limited , the diiodohydrobenzoin 12 and bis ( benzoxaborol ) 20 are both prepared in good yield and are readily derivatized through cross - coupling reactions .
we are currently exploring the utility of the bis ( benzoxaborol ) 20 and derivatives of this substance as chiral lewis acids and will report our findings in due course .

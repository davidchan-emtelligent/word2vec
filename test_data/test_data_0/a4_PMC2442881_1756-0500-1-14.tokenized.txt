background a recurrent somatic mutation , e17k , in the pleckstrin homology domain of the akt1 gene , has been recently described in breast , colorectal , and ovarian cancers .
akt1 is a pivotal mediator of signalling pathways involved in cell survival , proliferation and growth .
the e17k mutation stimulates downstream signalling and exhibits transforming activity in vitro and in vivo .
findings we developed a sensitive high resolution melting ( hrm ) assay to detect the e17k mutation from formalin - fixed paraffin - embedded tumours .
we screened 219 non - small cell lung cancer biopsies for the mutation using hrm analysis .
four samples were identified as hrm positive .
subsequent sequencing of those samples confirmed the e17k mutation in one of the cases .
a rare single nucleotide polymorphism was detected in each of the remaining three samples .
the e17k was found in one of the 14 squamous cell carcinomas .
no mutations were found in 141 adenocarcinomas and 39 large cell carcinomas .
conclusion the akt1 e17k mutation is very rare in lung cancer and might be associated with tumorigenesis in squamous cell carcinoma .
hrm represents a rapid cost - effective and robust screening of low frequency mutations such as akt1 mutations in clinical samples .
findings genetic alterations in akt the human homologues of the viral oncogene v - akt , encode serine / threonine protein kinases which have a pivotal activity in the pi3k - related signalling pathway , affecting cell survival , proliferation and invasion [ 1 ] .
the three highly homologous isoforms , akt1 , akt2 and akt3 are composed of three functional domains : an amino terminal pleckstrin homology ( ph ) domain , a central catalytic domain , and a carboxyl terminal regulatory domain with the hydrophobic motif .
deregulated akt activity is a well - established genetic defect implicated in tumorigenesis [ 2 ] .
on activation , akt exerts its anti - apoptotic and proliferative cellular functions through its kinase activity on various substrates [ 3 ] .
frequent genetic alterations of the akt genes , especially akt2 , have been demonstrated in human malignancies [ 4,5 ] .
akt1 amplification was initially identified in gastric cell lines [ 6 ] and has shown to be associated with cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells through the mtor pathway [ 7 ] .
no akt1 somatic mutation was described until carpten et al. identified an e17k ( c.49g > a ) mutation in the pleckstrin homology domain from breast , ovarian and colorectal cancers [ 8 ] .
transforming activity was demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro .
the mutation causes constitutive activation by localisation to the plasma membrane in a pi3k - independent manner .
it is of interest which tumour types other than breast , ovarian and colorectal cancers also show the recurrent e17k mutation .
the mutation was not found in acute myeloid leukaemia and brain tumours [ 9,10 ] .
in this study , we used high resolution melting ( hrm ) analysis to screen the akt1 e17k mutation in a panel of 219 non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) tumour biopsies to determine if this mutation may occur in nsclc .
methods a total of 219 nsclc samples were included in this study .
two hundred of these samples had previously been tested for egfr and kras mutations .
our panel of samples have also been described in another recent study [ 20 ]. of those , 141 were adenocarcinomas , 39 were large cell carcinomas , 14 were squamous cell carcinomas , and 25 were of unknown or other histology .
genomic dna was extracted using the dneasy tissue kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) following proteinase k digestion at 56degreesc for 3 days .
this study was approved by the ethics of human research committee at the peter maccallum cancer centre ( project number 03 / 90 ) .
hrm primers were designed to screen the e17k mutation , generating a 78 bp product .
the sequences of the primers were 5 ' - cgagggtctgacgggtagagtg - 3 ' ( forward ) and 5 ' - ggccgccaggtcttgatgt - 3 ' ( reverse ) .
pcr for hrm analysis was performed on the rotor - gene 6000 ( corbett research , sydney , australia ) in the presence of the fluorescent dna intercalating dye , syto 9 ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) .
the reaction mixture in a final volume of 20 mul was made using hotstartaq ( qiagen ) as follows ; 1 x pcr buffer , 2.5 mm mgcl2 , 200 nm of each primer , 5 ng of genomic dna , 200 mum of dntps , 5 mum of syto 9 , and 0.5 u of taq polymerase .
the cycling and melting conditions were as follows ; one cycle of 95degreesc for 15 minutes ; 50 cycles of 95degreesc for 10 seconds , 65degreesc for 10 seconds with an initial 10 cycles of touchdown ( 1degreesc / cycle ) , 72degreesc for 20 seconds ; one cycle of 97degreesc for 1 minute and a melt from 70degreesc to 95degreesc with the temperature rising 0.2degreesc per second .
all samples were tested in duplicate .
samples with potential mutations identified by hrm analysis were sequenced .
each sample was reamplified with a new reverse sequencing primer to cover the entire coding region of the exon 4 .
the sequence of the reverse primer was 5 ' - ccccaaatctgaatcccgaga - 3 ' .
pcr was performed as follows ; initial denaturation at 95degreesc for 15 minutes ; 50 cycles of 95degreesc for 10 seconds , 60degreesc for 10 seconds , 72degreesc for 20 seconds with an initial 10 cycles of touchdown ( 1degreesc / cycle starting from 65degreesc ) ; one cycle of 72degreesc for 10 minutes .
6 mul of the pcr products were purified with exosapit ( ge healthcare , little chalfont , england ) followed by sequencing using big dye terminator v3.1 ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
the sequencing products were ethanol precipitated before running on a 3100 genetic analyser ( applied biosystems ) .
the sequencing data was analysed using sequencher 4.6 ( gene codes corporation , ann arbor , mi ) .
results hrm analysis on a panel of 219 nsclc samples identified four hrm positive samples which displayed aberrant melting curves compared with wild - type .
their melting curves were clearly separated from that of wild - type , suggesting that sequence changes were present in those amplicons ( figure 1 ) .
subsequent sequencing of those samples revealed an e17k mutation in one sample and a rare intronic snp c.47 - 12g > a ( rs17846816 ) in the remaining three samples .
the e17k mutation was detected in one of the 14 squamous cell carcinomas , and was absent in the 141 adenocarcinomas and 39 large cell carcinomas as well as the 25 samples of unknown or other histology .

panel a : normalised plot of akt1 exon 4 .
melting profiles of the wild - type control ( wt ) and four samples ( tx25 , tx94 , tx285 , 07m470 ) are shown .
the melting profile of tx25 is similar to that of the wild - type control .
tx94 , tx285 and 07m470 show different melting profiles than the wild - type control .
panel b : difference plot of akt1 exon 4 .
melting profiles of each sample were normalised against the wild - type control ( wt ) .
tx94 , tx285 and 07m470 show distinctively different melting curves .
panel c : sequencing of the hrm positive samples .
these identified a rare snp , ivs3 - 12g > a , from both tx94 and 07m470 .
panel d : sequencing identifies the e17k ( c.49g > a ) mutation .
tx285 was positive for the e17k ( c.49g > a ) mutation .
sequencing was carried out in both directions to confirm the presence of the mutation .
discussion high resolution melting ( hrm ) is a methodology that can detect sequence changes in amplicons through monitoring of the fluorescence of a double stranded dna binding dye which dissociates from the dna as it denatures with increasing temperature .
it is an in - tube method which can be performed in a fast , simple , and robust manner .
if sequence changes , either snps and / or mutations , are present within the amplicon , they cause a difference in the melting profile compared with the wild - type .
a range of alternative methodologies are available for screening monomorphic mutations such as the c.49g > a ( e17k ) .
these include pcr - rflp [ 11 ] , allele specific competitive blocker polymerase chain reaction [ 12,13 ] and taqman " genotyping " [ 14,15 ] .
each methodology has its own particular advantages and disadvantages .
the disadvantages of these methodologies are that they detect only specified mutations ( competitive blocker , taqman ) and / or require post - pcr handling of the product ( pcr - rflp , competitive blocker ) or relatively expensive probes for visualisation ( taqman ) .
however , hrm is capable of detecting any sequence changes present within the amplicon tested , and thus can screen not only the specified mutation but also the whole amplified sequence .
furthermore , the use of a fluorescent intercalating dye allows hrm to be performed in - tube , which eliminates post - pcr handling .
in this study , the e17k ( c.49g > a ) mutation in exon 4 of the akt1 gene was screened by hrm with primers generating a short amplicon of 78 bp suitable for the screening of formalin - fixed paraffin - embedded samples. by hrm screening and subsequent sequencing , we found the akt1 e17k mutation in one of the 219 nsclc samples .
the tumour sample with the transforming mutation was collected from a female diagnosed with nsclc at the age of seventy .
the tumour biopsy ( 2 x 3 mm size ) was taken from the left upper lobe and was histologically confirmed as squamous cell carcinoma ( figure 2 ) .
no mutation was found in egfr exons 18 to 21 and kras exon 2 in this sample .
more cases need to be studied to determine whether this mutation is recurrent in squamous cell carcinomas .
figure 2 hematoxylin and eosin stained section of the tumour with an akt1 e17k mutation .
a 5 mum tumour section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin .
the tumour was histologically diagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma .
two magnifications are shown .
association of akt activation with resistance to chemotherapeutic agents has been studied in lung and breast cancers .
akt1 amplification was shown to be a cause of cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells [ 6 ] .
in another study , constitutive activation of akt was found in over 90 % of nsclc cell lines ( 16 / 17 ) and its activation contributed to both pi3k inhibitor ( ly294002 ) and radiation resistance [ 16 ] .
in breast cancer cell line studies , akt activation markedly increased resistance to microtubule - directed agents as well as trastuzumab and tamoxifen treatment [ 17,18 ] .
furthermore , the e17k was shown to alter the sensitivity to an allosteric kinase inhibitor but not to atp competitive inhibitors .
the finding of this recurrent akt1 mutation in various tumours suggests that akt may be an attractive therapeutic target for some patients .
in conclusion , this study shows that the transforming akt1 e17k mutation occurs at a very low frequency in nsclc .
it may be restricted to squamous cell carcinoma where its frequency is likely to be higher .
in addition , hrm is an effective screening method for this mutation due to its low incidence .
note added in proof a second study has appeared since this ms was submitted for review .
malanga et al. examined a panel of 105 nsclc by sequencing and observed e17k mutations in two of the 36 squamous cell carcinomas but in no other nsclc subtype [ 19 ] .
these results and our results considered together indicate that the e17k mutation is probably limited to squamous cell carcinomas in nsclc .

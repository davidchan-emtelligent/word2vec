they result from inflammatory processes induced by lipoproteins such as oxidized low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) , vldl and lipoprotein ( a ) ( lp ( a )) .
fifty years after the first publication by kare berg from oslo , lp ( a ) has meanwhile been accepted as an individual risk factor .
however , in spite of the increasing scientific interest in lp ( a ) , biological function and biosynthetic and catabolic processes of this molecule are still widely unknown .
furthermore , the exact laboratory determination of lp ( a ) plasma concentration and its different isoforms is still challenging .
the individual lp ( a ) serum concentration is genetically determined and remains relatively constant thoughout life .
some ethnic groups in arabic and african countries show very high lp ( a ) plasma concentrations .
in the meantime , several registries have indicated that a high lp ( a ) plasma concentration is associated with an increased incidence of coronary heart disease , aortic valve stenosis and heart failure .
however , there is still no systematic analysis of the population in order to assess their cardiovascular risk depending on lp ( a ) .
for the first time , the european society of cardiology has now included lp ( a ) determination in the extended screening for the assessment of the cardiovascular risk .
in germany , there are still no effective drugs to lower lp ( a ) plasma concentration .
neither are the recently approved pcsk9 inhibitors expected to significantly improve therapeutic options .
thus , lipid apheresis has to be regarded as the only effective therapeutic option to decrease cardiac events .
against this background , the contributions to the present supplement are intended to focus on the clinical aspects of lp ( a ) and to emphasize the importance of lipid apheresis .
this editorial is part of the special issue " lp ( a ) - the underestimated cardiovascular risk factor " .

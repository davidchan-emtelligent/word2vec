background / aims anti - ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( gachr ) antibodies are observed in autoimmune diseases , as well as in patients with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy .
however , the genetic background of anti - gachr antibodies is unclear .
here , we investigated hla alleles in autoimmune hepatitis ( aih ) patients with or without anti - gachr antibodies .
methodology / principal findings genomic dna from 260 patients with type - 1 autoimmune hepatitis ( aih ) were genotyped for hla - a , b , drb1 , and dqb1 loci .
anti - gachr antibodies in the sera form aih patients were measured using the luciferase immunoprecipitation system , and examined allelic association in patients with or without anti - gachr antibodies .
methodology / methods we detected anti - alpha3 or - beta4 gachr antibodies in 11.5 % ( 30 / 260 ) of patients with aih .
among aih patients there was no significant association between hla - a , b dqb1 alleles and the positivity for anti - gachr antibodies .
whereas the hla - drb1 * 0403 allele showed a significantly increased frequency in aih patients with anti - gachr antibodies compared with those without anti - gachr antibodies .
conclusions / significance the frequency of the hla - drb1 * 0403 allele differed among japanese patients with aih according to the presence or absence of anti - gachr antibodies .
our findings suggest that particular hla class ii molecules might control the development of anti - gachr antibodies in the autoimmune response to gachr .

introduction autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy ( aag ) is an acquired channelopathy that is characterized by pandysautonomia [ 1 ] , in which autoantibodies to ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( gachr ) may play a central role [ 2 ] .
we established the luciferase immunoprecipitation system ( lips ) assay as a new tool to detect anti - gachr antibodies and demonstrated these auto - antibodies in aag [ 3 ] .
furthermore , using this established anti - gachr antibody assay system , we reported that a significant proportion of patients with autoimmune diseases were positive for anti - gachr antibodies [ 3 ] .
anti - gachr antibodies in the patient ' serum recognize ( alpha and beta subunits ) of the ganglionic acetylcholine receptor [ 4 ] .
the major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) genes are the best documented genetic risk factors for the development of autoimmune diseases and could be involved in autoantibody production [ 5 ] .
this is because of their expression on antigen - presenting cells , which could favor presentation of autoantigen epitopes to t cells , leading to specific help in autoantibody production [ 6 ] .
for example , an increased frequency of conserved hla - drb1 domain " shared epitopes " has been demonstrated in rheumatoid arthritis patients with anti - citrullinated peptide antibodies [ 7 ] .
similarly , a genetic predisposition to autoantibody production in autoimmune hepatitis ( aih ) has been shown to be associated with hla genes [ 8 ] .
we hypothesized that antibodies against gachr exist in a subset of aih patients with genetic susceptibility factors , including hla .
we genotyped the hla - a , b , drb1 , and dqb1 genes in 260 aih patients with or without anti - gachr antibodies and evaluated the association between hla genotype and the production of anti - gachr antibodies .
materials and methods study population consecutive type - 1 aih patients were initially enrolled in the register of the japanese national hospital organization ( nho ) liver - network study , contributed to medical facilities in japan , and prospectively followed since 2009 as a multicenter cohort population [ 9 ] all patients satisfied the 1999 revised criteria of international autoimmune hepatitis group ( iaihg ) diagnosis of type - 1 aih [ 10 ] .
patients were excluded from the study if there was histological evidence of cholangitis or non - alcoholic steatohepatitis .
in addition , patients who were positive for hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) - surface antigen ( hbsag ) or hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) - rna were excluded .
patients with other causes of liver disease , such as excess alcohol or drug use , were excluded based on reviews of their appropriate history and investigations .
the control groups included in this study consisted of 73 healthy controls ( hc ; mean age , 38.3 +/ - 11.1 years old , 31 males and 42 females ) and 34 subjects with other neurological diseases with any autonomic symptoms ( ond ; mean age , 56.3 +/ - 20.4 years old , 19 males and 15 females ) .
the control group for hla - drb1 genotyping consisted of 120 gender - matched japanese healthy subjects ( 6 men and 114 women ) .
the mean +/ - sd age was 46.0 +/ - 14.3 years .
all of subjects gave their written , informed consent to participate in the present study .
the study was approved by the ethics committee of national hospital organization ( nho ) central irb ( h26 - 2111007 ) .
variables at study entry demographic and other characteristics of the 230 retained patients were recorded in a database at the initial assessment .
data included sex , age at diagnosis , time of onset of symptoms or other evidence of liver disease , markers of infection with hepatitis viruses hbv and hcv , alcohol intake , coexisting autoimmune diseases , serum levels of alt , ast , alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin , platelet count and prothrombin time .
anti - nuclear antibodies ( ana ) and anti - smooth muscle antibodies ( asma ) were measured by indirect immunofluorescence on hep - 2 cells and cut - off titers for positivity were 1:40 .
liver tissue from percutaneous biopsy performed at the referring facility was available for the majority of patients at the time of entry ( 223 / 260 , 85.8 %) , but for only a few at the subsequent follow - up examination ( 8 / 260 , 3.1 %) .
hla - a , b , - drb1 and - dqb1 genotyping dna was extracted from the blood sample and subjected to hla - a , b , - drb1 and - dqb1genotype determination by wakflow hla typing kit ( wakunaga pharmaceutical , osaka , japan ) based on the reverse sequence - specific oligonucleotide probes method coupled with xmap technology designed for use with the luminex system ( luminex japan , tokyo , japan ) .
lips assay for the detection of autoantibodies to gachr [ 3 ] serum antibodies to gachr were detected by the lips assay , as described elsewhere [ 3 ] .
to generate luciferase reporters for the gachr alpha3 and beta4 subunits ( termed gachralpha3 - gl and gachrbeta4 - gl , respectively ) of the human gachr , full - length human achr alpha3 ( p32297 , promega corporation , madison , wi , usa ) or beta4 ( p30296 , promega corporation ) was fused to a gaussia luciferase ( gl ) mutant ( gl8990 ) .
human embryonic kidney ( hek ) 293f cells ( life technologies corportion , graind island , ny , usa ) were then transfected with the expression plasmid encoding either gachralpha3 - gl or gachrbeta4 - gl with fugene6 ( promega corporation ) .
two days later , the transfected cells were solubilized with a tris - based saline containing 1 % triton ( tm ) x - 100 .
to detect alpha3 or beta4 gachr antibodies , 100 mul of the soluble fraction , containing gachr alpha3 - gl or gachr beta4 - gl , was incubated with 15 mul of human serum for 1 hour at 4degreesc .
subsequently , the fraction was mixed with 15 mul of protein g - sepharose ( ge healthcare , little chalfont , buckinghamshire , uk ) , 600 mul phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) with 3 % bovine serum albumin and 0.05 % tween ( r ) 20 , and incubated for several hours at 4degreesc .
following centrifugation and two washes of pbs containing 0.05 % tween ( r ) 20 , bioluminescence activities of the luciferase reporters in protein g - sepharose were measured with a biolux ( tm ) gl assay kit ( new england biolabs , ipswich , ma , usa ) and a lumat lb 9507 luminometer ( berthold technologies gmbh & co. kg , bad wildbad , germany ) ; luminometer output was measured in relative luminescence units ( rlu ) .
in order to confirm the accuracy of the lips assay for gachr antibodies , we used commercially available antibodies to human gachr alpha3 and beta4 ( h - 100 and s - 15 ; santa cruz biotechnology , inc. , dallas , tx , usa ) as positive controls .
based on anti - gachralpha3 and beta4 antibody data from the 73 hcs , cut - off values were calculated as the mean plus 3 standard deviations ( sd ) from the mean .
in this study , antibody levels were expressed as an antibody index ( a.i. ) that was calculated as follows : a.i =[ measurement value of the sample serum ( rlu )]/[ the cut - off value ( rlu )] the normal value that was established in this study from healthy individuals was < 1.0 a.i. to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of this assay , we verified the cut - off points for all data collected in the previous study .
cut - off points calculated sensitivity and specificity , and roc curves were obtained .
according to the roc curves , we confirmed the most discriminative cut - off points .
at these points , the sensitivity , specificity , and positive and negative predictive values ( ppv and npv ) were calculated .
the auc was 0.849 ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] : 0.786 - 0.911 ) for the lips assay of the anti - gachralpha3 antibody. with the anti - gachralpha3 antibody cut - off point of 1.0 , the sensitivity and specificity were 46.9 % ( 95 % ci : 33.7 - 60.6 %) and 99.2 % ( 95 % ci : 94.8 - 100.0 %) , respectively , and the ppv and npv were 95.8 % and 81.8 % , respectively .
the auc was 0.720 ( 95 % ci : 0.632 - 0.807 ) for the lips assay of the anti - gachrbeta4 antibody. with the anti - gachrbeta4 antibody cut - off point of 1.0 , the sensitivity and specificity were 14.3 % ( 95 % ci : 6.9 - 27.1 %) and 100.0 % ( 95 % ci : 96.2 - 100.0 %) , respectively .
the ppv and npv were 100.0 % and 74.4 % , respectively .
this sensitivity and specificity anti - gachralpha3 antibody in our assay system is similar to the previous reports [ 11 ] .
statistics the distribution of hla types was compared between patients with or without anti - gachr antibodies .
the risk / protective effects of carrier status of hla alleles were evaluated by odds ratio ( or ) obtained by the comparison of frequencies between patients with or without anti - gachr antibodies .
comparisons between the 2 groups for phenotype frequencies of each hla allele were made , and each p value was corrected ( pc ) , multiplying by the number of tested alleles at each considered locus .
p values were regarded as significant when they were less than 0.05 .
continuous variables were compared using mann - whitney tests .
all the statistical analyses were performed using the statistical analysis system ( sas ) and spss version 18 software ( spss , chicago , il , usa ) .
results demographic data table 1 shows the demographic data for the enrolled type - 1 aih patients .
the age at diagnosis ranged from 15 to 88 years ( mean , 60.2 +/ - 12.7 years ) , which is greater than that in earlier studies on caucasian patients , and females predominated .
in 45 ( 17.3 %) patients , there was concurrent symptomatic autoimmune disease , notably , hashimoto 's disease 18 ; sjogren 's syndrome 13 ; rheumatoid arthritis 13 ; basedow disease 2 ; primary biliary cirrhosis 1 ; systemic lupus erythematosus 1 ; multiple sclerosis 1 ; crest syndrome 1 ; polymyalgia rheumatica 1 ; scleroderma 1 ; mixed connective tissue disease 1 ; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura 1 .
regarding tests for autoantibodies , data for sma were lacking in 2 and for ana in 1. of those tested , 232 ( 89.6 %) gave positive tests ( titer > 1:40 ) for ana and 36 ( 40.9 %) for sma .
ninety - eight patients ( 37.7 %) had been treated with prednisolone and 51 ( 9.6 %) with ursodeoxycholic acid alone .

clinical characteristics of aih patients with gachr antibodies of the 260 patients with aih screened , anti - gachr alpha3 antibodies were detected in 28 ( 10.8 %) patients and anti - gachr beta4 antibodies were detected in 18 ( 6.9 %) patients .
mean anti - gachralpha3 antibodies in hcs and onds were 0.305 a.i. and 0.336 a.i. , respectively .
these levels were significantly lower than anti - gachralpha3 antibodies in aih samples , with a mean level of 0.609 a.i .
( p < 0.001 , fig 1a ) .
mean anti - gachrbeta4 levels in hcs were 0.367 a.i. and in onds was 0.302 a.i. , which were significantly lower than that in aih samples ( 0.506 a.i. , p = 0.001 , fig 1b ) .
we investigated the correlation between gachr alpha3 and beta4 antibodies levels in patients with both antibodies ( n = 17 ) .
as shown in fig 2 , there was no significant correlation between gachr alpha3 and beta4 antibodies levels .
also antibodies against particular gachr single submit have been demonstrated [ 12 ] .
therefore , the cross - reactivity of gachr antibodies against alpha3 and beta4 subunits seems to be unlikely .
table 2 shows the clinical characteristics of aih patients with or without gachr antibodies .
the gachr antibody - positive ( ab +) patients had significantly lower serum albumin levels at the time of registering , as well as lower platelet counts compared with those of the gachr antibody - negative ( ab - ) patients ( tables 2 and 3 ) .

we tested the sera from patients with aih , disease controls ( odc ) , and healthy controls ( hc ) .
a ) anti - gachralpha3 antibodies were detected in 28 samples .
the mean anti - gachralpha3 antibody level in the hc was 0.305 antibody index ( a.i. ) , which was significantly lower than in the aih samples with a mean level of 0.609 a.i .
( p < 0.001 ) .
b ) anti - gachrbeta4 antibodies were also detected in patient with aih .
the mean anti - gachrbeta4 antibody levels in the hc was 0.367 a.i. , which was significantly lower than the mean levels of 0.506 a.i. in the aih samples ( p < 0.001 ) .

calculation of the correlation between anti - gachr alpha3 and anti - gachr beta4 antibody levels in aih patients with both autoantibodies ( n = 17 ) .
correlation was calculated using spearman 's rank correlation test .
there is no correlation at all ( r = - 0.04 , p = 0.58 ) .
hla - a , b alleles among aih patients with anti - gachr ab the results of hla - a and - b loci typing among aih patients with anti - gachr antibodies are summarized in s1 - s3 tables .
the frequencies of hla - a and - b alleles were not significantly different between gachr ab + and ab - aih patients .
frequencies of hla - drb1 and dqb1 alleles as shown in table 4 , gachr alpha3 ab + aih patients had a higher frequency of the drb1 * 0403 allele than did gachr alpha3 ab - patients .
similarly , gachr beta4 ab + aih patients had a higher frequency of the drb1 * 0403 allele compared with gachr beta4 ab - patients ( table 5 ) .
the frequencies of the hla - drb1 * 0403 allele were significantly increased in aih patients with anti - gachr alpha3 or beta4 antibodies ( table 6 ) .
we compared the antibody index ( ai ) of anti - gachr antibodies between aih patients with or without hla - drb1 * 0403 allele ( fig 3 ) .
the levels of ai for anti - gachr alpha3 in patients with * 0403 allele ( 1.06 +/ - 0.74 a.i ) were significantly higher compared to those without * 0403 allele ( 0.59 +/ - 0.71 a.i ) .
similarly , the levels of ai for anti - gachr beta4 antibodies in patients with * 0403 allele ( 0.76 +/ - 0.33 a.i ) were significantly higher compared to those without * 0403 allele ( 0.50 +/ - 0.32 a.i ) .
finally , the hla - drb1 alleles distributions in type 1 aih were compared with gender - matched japanese healthy subjects .
hla - drb1 * 0405 allele , not drb1 * 0403 , had been shown to be a genetic factor in japanese patients with type - 1 aih [ 13 ] .
in consistent with the previous report [ 13 ] , the hla - drb1 * 0405 alleles were associated with type i aih , whereas , no significant difference in the frequency of drb1 * 0403 was present between aih patients and healthy subjects ( table 7 ) .

discussion although it is accepted that aag and other autoimmune diseases can coexist because of a background of autoimmunity , few reports have examined anti - gachr antibodies in autoimmune diseases [ 14 ] .
we established the lips assay as a new tool to detect autoantibodies against gachr [ 3 ] .
using this assay , we demonstrated that a significant number of aih patients have this autoantibody .
this study comprised 260 japanese patients with aih , who were carefully selected according to the diagnostic criteria for type 1 aih .
we performed molecular genetic analysis of hla genes in these patients , and compared the findings against anti - gachr antibody status .
we found that anti - gachr antibody positivity was associated with the hla - drb1 * 0403 allele .
therefore , it is possible that the hla - drb1 gene controls anti - gachr antibody production and that this production is modulated by particular hla - drb1 alleles .
type - 1 aih is characterized by the presence of anti - smooth muscle antigen ( sma ) directed against smooth muscle actin [ 15 ] .
whereas anti - gachr antibodies specifically recognize neuronal alpha or beta subunits of acetylcholine receptor .
therefore , the cross - reactivity of anti - gachr antibodies against liver antigens such as smooth muscle antigen seems to be insignificant .
furthermore , the associations between anti - sma antibodies and hla - b8 or dr3 alleles were reported [ 16 ] .
therefore genetic predisposition of type - 1 aih specific autoantibody ( anti - sma antibody ) may not affect the production of anti - gachr antibodies .
type 2 and type 3 autoimmune hepatitis are rare disorders characterized by antibodies against liver - kidney microsome 1 ( lkm1 ) and soluble liver antigens ( sla ) [ 17,18 ] .
genetic predispositions including hla for these autoantibodies ( anti - sma. lkm1 and sla ) were shown to be different [ 19 ] .
we could not recruit these different subtypes of aih patients in this study .
we focused on the type 1 aih rather than heterogeneous aih subtypes with differential genetic predispositions and autoantibody profiles .
hla - drb1 is one of the best known polymorphic loci in the human genome , with more than 1700 alleles [ 20 ] .
hla - drb1 alleles contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases as well as the production of autoantibodies [ 21 ] .
for the last two decades , scientists have been investigating the relationship between hla - drb1 alleles and autoantibodies [ 5 ] .
an important discovery was that shared epitope - encoding drb1 alleles have been linked to high levels of anti - citrullinated peptide ( ccp ) antibody in rheumatoid arthritis [ 22 ] .
shared epitope - encoding alleles such as drb1 * 04:01 and * 04:04 that confer rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility are more common in different ethnic populations [ 23 ] .
epitope recognition via restriction by the mhc is required for effective t cell help [ 24 ] .
documented associations between anti - ccp antibodies and particular hla class ii alleles are likely to reflect presentation of selected t cell determinants .
it has been proposed that several positions of the drb1 molecule independently play a role in antigen presentation according to the nature of the antigen [ 25 ] .
at present , there is no mechanistic explanation for the association of particular hla alleles with anti - gachr antibody responses .
although linkage disequilibrium with non - hla alleles cannot be ruled out , it is possible that different hla class ii alleles share relevant amino acid residues in the hypervariable regions , which are considered important for antigen presentation to t cells [ 26 ] .
peptide motifs for mhc class ii binding and t cell receptors for antigen recognition are presumed to be crucial for immunodominant self - peptides and activation of autoreactive t cells [ 27 ] .
recent studies of the hla class ii region suggested several candidate amino acids in the hypervariable regions of the hla - drb1 alleles that are predicted to map to the floor of the peptide - binding groove of class ii mhc molecules [ 28 ] .
they could function by presenting antigenic peptides to lymphocytes to initiate anti - gachr autoimmune responses .
we speculate that anti - gachr antibody production requires efficient help to b cells , which could be provided by drb1 * 0403 - restricted t helper cells recognizing gachr determinants .
this explanation may account for the differential drb1 allele association with anti - gachr antibodies , but does not give any clue as to the reason for the necessary presence of anti - gachr antibodies .
drb1 * 0403 and * 0406 were positively associated with anti - gachr antibodies , whereas drb1 * 0405 was negatively associated in this study .
the drb1 * 0403 and drb1 * 0406 alleles share a glu amino acid at position 74 [ 29 ] , whereas the drb1 * 0405 allele has ala at this position [ 23 ] ; this might imply a role for glu at position 74 in the development of anti - gachr antibodies .
we suggest a mechanism by which different hla class ii molecules preferentially affect gachr - specific t helper responses , thereby controlling diversification of the autoantibody response .
this hypothesis could be tested by examining the specificity and hla restriction of anti - gachr antibodies in patients with other autoimmune diseases .
this study has limitations .
most notably , we did not examine clinical manifestations characteristic of aag in our aih patients .
clinical investigations are necessary to confirm the relationship between gachr antibody positivity and autonomic symptoms .
additionally , it was difficult to perform a replication study due to the very low prevalence of type - 1 autoimmune hepatitis and limited numbers of enrolled patients .
in this study , we strictly enrolled type - 1 aih patients according to the international diagnostic criteria to maximize diagnostic specificity .
therefore , we could not reserve sufficient sample size , and the possibility of underpowered study cannot be denied .
additionally , it was difficult to perform a replication study due to the very low prevalence aih .
in conclusion , we have presented evidence that an autoimmune response to gachr is influenced by different hla - drb1 alleles in japanese patients with aih .
we suggest a mechanism by which different hla class ii molecules might preferentially affect the gachr - specific t cell response , controlling diversification of the autoantibody response .
this hypothesis should be further tested by examining the hla restriction of anti - gachr antibodies in patients with autoimmune diseases .
proof awaits the development of an immunodominant epitope of anti - gachr antibodies and antigenic motifs for mhc class ii binding .

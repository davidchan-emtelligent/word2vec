background hyposplenism , due to splenectomy , inherited red blood cell disorders or acquired conditions such as celiac disease , has an important impact on the severity of malaria , especially in non - immune patients .
conversely , that malaria may reveal functional hyposplenism has not been described previously .
methods a 31 - year old gardener was diagnosed with an uncomplicated attack of plasmodium malariae 11 years after leaving the endemic area .
in addition to trophozoites and schizonts , thick and thin smears also showed howell - jolly bodies , pointing to functional hyposplenism .
this was later confirmed by the presence of a calcified spleen in the context of s / beta + sickle - cell syndrome in a patient previously unaware of this condition .
conclusion malaria may reveal hyposplenism .
although howell - jolly bodies are morphologically similar to nuclei of young plasmodium trophozoite , distinction on smears is based on the absence of cytoplasm and irregular size of howell - jolly bodies .
in the patient reported here , hyposplenism was revealed by the occurrence of p. malariae infection relatively late in life .
timely diagnosis of hyposplenism resulted in the implementation of appropriate measures to prevent overwhelming infection with capsulated bacteria .
this observation highlights the importance of diagnosing hyposplenism in patients with malaria despite the morphological similarities between ring nuclei and howell - jolly bodies on thick smears .
hyposplenism plasmodium malariae howell jolly bodies sickle cell syndrome malaria background hyposplenism corresponds to the impairment of splenic function .
this is a serious condition because the spleen plays a major role in immunological and mechanical defences against infections .
diagnosis of spleen dysfunction is based on the measure of its filtering function .
the gold standard is the measure of phagocytosis of colloid particles in the spleen using radioisotopic methods .
however , quantification of morphological alterations or deformability [ 1 ] of circulating red blood cells is a more practical marker [ 2 ] .
howell - jolly bodies are small nuclear remnants from erythroblasts that cannot be removed from red blood cells if the spleen is absent .
in sickle cell disease , there is a strong correlation [ 3 ] between the number of red blood cells harbouring howell - jolly bodies , or the number of " pitted cells " ( i e , red blood cells containing small vesicles ) in circulation and the intensity of functional hyposplenism .
in plasmodium infections , the spleen contributes to innate resistance and limits the magnitude of parasitaemia .
this is particularly well established in plasmodium falciparum infection [ 4 ] .
for other species , such as plasmodium malariae , the influence of hyposplenism on the outcome of infection is poorly documented .
here , is the clinical history report of a patient in whom chronic infection with p. malariae ( 11 years after leaving the endemic area ) revealed functional hyposplenism and a major sickle cell syndrome .
methods a 31 - year - old gardener was admitted to an emergency department in december 2010 .
he had moved from mali to france in 1999 and had never travelled back to africa or to any tropical country .
the patient had a surgical history of inguinal abscess .
he had no medication , smoked tobacco for 14 years and did not drink alcohol. between 2006 and 2009 , he experienced episodes of chronic fever and asthenia .
on physical examination the patient was febrile with a temperature of 39degreesc had a 119 - beat per minute pulse and a blood pressure of 147 / 97 mmhg .
he reported headache , myalgia and lumbar pain .
the rest of physical examination was normal .
the patient was admitted to the internal medicine department .
he mentioned repeated flu - like syndromes in the previous three months and recent episodes of rhythmic fever occurring once every three days .
at admission , physical examination was unremarkable and main laboratory parameters were : leucocytosis , white blood cells 11.9 x 109 / l n ( 4.0 - 10.0 ) , microcytic anaemia with haemoglobin 11.5 g / dl n ( 13.0 - 17.5 ) and mean corpuscular volume 72 fl n ( 80 - 100 ) , platelets 252 x 109 / l n ( 150 - 400 ) , creatinaemia 81 mumol / l n ( 62 - 106 ) , and inflammatory syndrome with c - reactive protein 33 mg / l n (< 5 ) and ferritinaemia 2,020 mug / l n ( 30 - 300 ) .
thin and thick smears were performed from venous blood .
the rosette - like aspect of a schizont ( figure 1a ) , the small size of the erythrocyte - hosting gametocytes on the thin smear ( figure 1b ) and the absence of maurer or schuffner dots were highly suggestive of p. malariae infection , latter confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for p. malariae [ 5 ] .
this diagnosis was consistent with the very long incubation period and the rhythm of fever .

thick ( a ) and thin ( b ) smear at admission ( original magnification x1000 , giemsa - r staining ) .
in red squares , a sample of p. malariae rings showing morphological similarities between ring nuclei and howell - jolly bodies .
the absence of cytoplasm is key for the differential diagnosis. a. two leukocyte nuclei , the rosette - like aspect ( vertical arrow ) of the schizont ( plasmodium malariae ) , and several howell - jolly bodies ( red arrows ). b. small size of the erythrocyte hosting a p. malariae gametocyte ( vertical arrow ) and unifected red blood cells showing microcytosis , anisochromasia , and target aspect .
initially , the small , round , purple bodies on the thick smear were interpreted as the nuclei of young trophozoites ( rings ) , thereby strengthening the diagnosis .
however , the absence of cytoplasm in contact with these bodies and their markedly variable size contradicted this interpretation .
study of the thin smear confirmed that the bodies corresponded instead to typical howell - jolly bodies [ 6 - 8 ] .
the thin smear also showed morphological abnormalities of red cells : microcytosis , anisochromasia , target cells and schistocytes , raising the hypothesis of an associated haemoglobin disorder .
liquid chromatography of haemoglobin revealed a s / beta + sickle cell syndrome ( hbs 60 % and heterozygous beta thalassaemia beta + with hba2 6.5 % hbf 6.1 %) [ 9 ] .
the patient had no abdominal surgery scars .
due to the presence of howell - jolly bodies and the s / beta + sickle cell syndrome , a computed tomography scan of the abdominal region was performed and showed an atrophic calcified spleen ( figure 2 ) .
figure 2 abdominal ct - scan identify a small calcified spleen ( yellow arrow ) .
the malaria attack resolved rapidly with a three - day course of oral chloroquine .
clinical and laboratory markers returned to normal in one week .
the patient was discharged after being vaccinated for encapsulated bacteria ( streptococcus pneumoniae , haemophilus influenzae and neisseria meningitidis ) and provided with long - term oral beta - lactams to prevent potential complications of asplenia [ 10 ] .
malaria prophylaxis was recommended in case of travel to africa .
conclusion in patients with sickle cell anaemia , repeated sequestration crises leading to infarctions generally result in early splenic atrophy with calcifications [ 11 ] .
this evolution is almost constant in adult patients with homozygous sickle cell disease but is less frequent in patients with the s / beta + sickle cell syndrome [ 11 ] .
progressive hyposplenism and splenic atrophy in this patient were revealed by a malaria episode , and occurred relatively late in life .
sickle cell trait , i e , the heterozyte form , is protective against severe and fatal p. falciparum infections [ 12 ] , whereas in homozygosity , protection against severe malaria is counterbalanced by hyposplenism which appear during childhood [ 13,14 ] .
this observation suggests the existence of a similarly balanced influence of the presence of hbs on the evolution of infection with p. malariae .
much less is known on the impact of anatomical or functional hyposplenism on the course of infections with plasmodium vivax , plasmodium ovale , plasmodium knowlesi and p. malariae than on the more frequent p. falciparum [ 8,15 ] .
indeed , p. falciparum infection is more frequently severe and fatal in non - immune splenectomized patients [ 4,8 ] .
plasmodium malariae infection can be severe in patients with splenectomy or functional asplenia [ 16 - 18 ] .
here the patient experienced only mild symptoms .
it is assumed that in p. malariae as observed with p. falciparum patients who acquired immunity before becoming asplenic , uncomplicated attacks are more frequent than severe malaria [ 4 ] .
presence of howell - jolly bodies on a blood sample is a fairly specific indicator of hyposplenism [ 19,20 ] .
in this patient their presence on the thick / thin smear was due to sickle cell anaemia but presence of howell - jolly bodies is also be associated with several diseases : bone marrow transplantation ( 40 %) , celiac disease ( 33 - 76 %) , hiv infection / aids 36 (%) , alcoholic liver disease ( 37 - 100 %) and systemic lupus erythematosus ( 7.5 %) [ 2 ] .
the prevalence of hyposplenism is generally underestimated and the diagnosis often overlooked .
this has potentially severe consequences in infectious diseases in general , and in malaria in particular .
detecting hyposplenism can thus be life - saving as it triggers the adoption of appropriate preventive measures against overwhelming infections [ 2 ] .
this observation highlights the importance of diagnosing hyposplenism in patients with malaria despite the morphological similarities between ring nuclei and howell - jolly bodies on thick smears .

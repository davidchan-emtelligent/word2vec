introduction there are approximately 7000 new cases of tuberculosis every year in the uk , the majority of which are pulmonary .
approximately 5 % affect the lymph nodes in immunocompetent patients .
scrofula is an old term used to describe lymph nodes of the neck infected with tuberculosis case presentation in the elderly population , growing neck lumps are always treated as red flags until a diagnosis is confirmed .
here , the case of an 89 - year - old caucasian woman is presented .
she was reluctant to seek medical help as she feared the cause was sinister and did not want surgical intervention .
conclusion it is difficult to culture tuberculosis from superficial swabs , resulting in a high proportion of false negative results .
where there is a high degree of clinical suspicion for tuberculosis , it is important to consider a biopsy with culture .
patients over the age of 65 have waning immunity and are therefore a vulnerable group for acute infections as well as the re - activation of indolent organisms .
post - splenectomy patients are at a major disadvantage during sepsis and when a cellular immune response is required , such as when faced with a mycobacterium tuberculosis infection .
scrofula is treated with a similar regime as pulmonary tuberculosis and has a near 100 % success rate .
introduction in the elderly population , growing neck lumps are always treated as red flags until a diagnosis is confirmed .
the case of an elderly patient presenting with neck lumps is here described .
she was reluctant to seek medical help as she feared the cause was sinister and did not want surgical intervention .
there are many laboratory tests used to diagnose tuberculosis ( tb ) infection however we rely on a high level of clinical suspicion .
scrofula is an old term for tb affecting the lymph nodes of the neck , a more meaningful term is cervical tuberculous lymphadenopathy .
it is usually the result of a primary infection of the lymph nodes with mycobacterium tuberculosis .
the bacteria can be spread by the lymphatic system or blood .
therefore , it could originate from a primary pulmonary focus .
in adults , it is usually m. tuberculosis and in children , nontuberculous mycobacteria [ 1 ] .
scrofuloderma results from the breakdown of skin overlying a tuberculous focus , usually at a lymph node but also where skin overlies infected bones or joints .
in the past , milk was frequently contaminated with m. bovis that resulted in a high number of children presenting with scrofuloderma .
the oral or tonsillar primary lesion could progress to cervical adenitis which in turn resulted in the formation of cold abscesses .
clinically , these lesions are firm painless nodules that gradually enlarge and suppurate , forming ulcers and sinus tracts in overlying skin .
spontaneous healing can occur but often takes years and is often accompanied by the formation of hypertrophic scars .
as in this case , the most common presentation of scrofula is a painless , often suppurative abscess that shows no signs of calor or erythema unless there is a secondary infection .
patients less frequently present with systemic signs such as weight loss and night sweats [ 2 ] .
in europe , with the rapid decrease of tb in the second half of the twentieth century , scrofula has become a very rare disease .
the marked decrease in prevalence amongst the more economically developed countries was due to the pasteurization of milk and the bacillus calmette - guerin vaccine .
tb is still a major problem across the less economically developed countries , and therefore clinicians have a higher degree of suspicion when assessing patients .
every year in the uk , it is estimated that there are 7000 new cases of tb. according to a study carried out in india , extrapulmonary tb constitutes about 15 % to 20 % of new tb cases in immunocompetent patients .
these extrapulmonary sites are demonstrated in figure 1 .
this can rise to over 50 % in immunocompromised patients , especially in patients positive for the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) [ 3 ] .
figure 1 pie chart to compare the % of pulmonary tb ( ptb ) to extra - pulmonary tb ( eptb ) in newly diagnosed cases .
column graph demonstrates the breakdown of extra pulmonary sites of tb infection in the 15 - 20 % .
body response to infection with tb tb is spread by droplets that are inhaled into the respiratory tract , passing through the pharynx .
it most commonly affects the lungs although it is possible to trigger a response in the tonsillar region .
how the host 's immune system responds to m. tuberculosis has a major role in determining the clinical manifestations .
once the organism has reached the alveoli it has four potential fates [ 4 ] : the immune system may destroy the bacilli and the patient gains immunity ; the bacilli multiple and cause disease , that is , pulmonary tb ; the bacilli become dormant and never cause disease ; or the patient may develop reactivation tb - active disease due to an existing impairment in the immune system through , for example , hiv , malignancy or malnutrition .
during the primary infection with tb and during any subsequent secondary active disease , the bacteria are spread by blood or through the lymphatic system to any part of the body .
usually the bacteria are destroyed by the immune system ; however , they may concentrate at a particular site and lie dormant for decades before causing disease .
case presentation an 89 - year - old caucasian woman presented to our outpatients clinic with a left - sided neck lump which she had had for six months .
it had started as a small pea - sized lump and developed into a 3 cm x 4 cm smooth , fixed mass ( figure 2 ) .
it had grown relatively slowly and the woman has been otherwise healthy throughout .
she reported no pyrexia , dysphagia , weight loss , night sweats or hoarseness .
accompanied by her niece , our patient made it clear that , if it was malignant , she wanted it treated conservatively .

a further history revealed that she had a three - year history of recurrent neck swellings that progressed to abscesses , continuously discharging and healing slowly .
on closer physical inspection , there was visible scarring from a previous abscess approximately 5 cm inferior to this mass on her left side .
as can be seen in figure 3 and figure 4 , on our patient 's right side there was an old , slowly healing abscess that has been present for over a year .
figure 3 old slow to heal right sided neck abscess , scrofuloderma skin changes .
figure 4 image to show the contrast between the two abscess at different stages , left sided is more recent whilst the right has partially healed with the surrounding scrofuloderma skin changes .
our patient had always enjoyed good health , with the only other significant past medical history being a splenectomy , resulting in taking life - long daily penicillin .
the abscesses were treated by her general practitioner with recurrent antibiotics and frequent dressings .
previous swabs from the neck abscess , sent by her general practitioner , did not grow the tuberculous organism .
our patient agreed to have further investigations .
a chest x - ray and fine needle aspiration ( fna ) were performed .
the chest x - ray showed chronic fibrotic changes and no evidence of tb infection .
the fna contained necrotic debris and foam cells ; acute inflammatory cells were not prominent and granulomata were not seen .
ziehl - neelsen staining was performed and no acid - alcohol fast bacilli were seen .
the features found represented a partially treated skin abscess but the negative staining did not exclude the possibility of tb. part of the aspirate was submitted to microbiology for conventional and tb culture .
the differential diagnosis included neoplasia , tertiary syphilis , deep fungi ( for example , sporotrichosis , actinomycosis ) and chronic granulomatous disease .
three weeks after submitting the aspirate to microbiology for culture , tb was confirmed .
the infectious disease team took over our patient 's care immediately .
our patient underwent various tests , including liver function tests , urea and electrolytes test , hiv screening and visual acuity prior to commencing the anti - tb regime .
our patient was started on ethambutol 700 mg to be taken in the morning , rifampicin 450 mg , isoniazid 300 mg , pyrazinamide 900 mg and pyridoxine 20 mg. within two months she showed a significant improvement , and after four months there were visible scars only .
discussion the body 's initial immune response involves type 1 cd4 + t lymphocytes and natural killer t lymphocytes ( nk cells ) that secrete interferon - gamma .
this activates macrophages to produce a variety of substances that inhibit growth and kill mycobacteria .
this is a very simplified explanation ; the process involves many other aspects including suppression from interleukin 4 - 10 , amplification by interleukin 12 and many cytokines [ 5 ] .
re - infection is a rare event when immunity is intact , however , over the past few decades it has been demonstrated in patients with advanced hiv , with the use of chemotherapy and disease - modifying antirheumatic drugs and , in theory , is possible in any other process that reduces the host immune response [ 6 ] .
aging is known to have detrimental effects on the immune system and is referred to as immunosenescence .
it is a complex process that affects cell mediated immunity [ 7 ] .
as we age , we lose lymphoid tissue .
t - cell activation is reduced plus a larger percentage of activated t - cells responses start later and stop sooner .
nk cell activity is also reduced significantly .
it has been suggested that , as we age , the innate response prevails over the adaptive response [ 8 - 10 ] .
the immune response to tb greatly relies on t lymphocytes and nk cells and so the aging immune system is much less capable of responding to m. tuberculosis .
the spleen is an important organ in the defense against invading pathogens .
it acts as a filtering system , permitting phagocytosis of bacteria by cells in the reticuloendothelial system .
the spleen is also an important site capable of producing large quantities of antibodies , which has proven vital in preventing and tackling sepsis .
therefore , the major risk post - splenectomy is that of overwhelming sepsis [ 11 ] .
the humoral role of the spleen has been well documented and recent studies have shown the spleen to have a significant role in cell mediated immunity .
the spleen is an important organ for the differentiation and maturation of stem cells into immunocompetent b - cells .
b - cells were once mostly associated with the humoral immune response .
however , recent studies have shown a variety of interactions of b - cells with the cellular immune response , which is necessary against infection by m. tuberculosis [ 12 ] .
in the future , if a mass is suspected for tb , tissue should be attained to help with the diagnosis .
as in this case , the initial ziehl - neelsen stain came back negative , however the culture was positive .
this is a common problem and emphasizes the importance of a high clinical suspicion .
having to repeat fna is also common , especially if the mass is long standing .
some empirical antibiotics , such as macrolides , have been shown to partly treat mycobacterium organisms , therefore reducing the likelihood of getting positive cultures .
treatment is similar to that for pulmonary disease , which is with isoniazid , rifampicin , pyrazinamide and ethambutol for two months followed by a longer course of rifampicin and isoniazid .
the length of time for treatment has long been debated , with no firm consensus .
the duration depends on the patient , the response to treatment , the risk of relapse and the site and tissue involved .
where there is limited lymph node involvement , treatment is usually continued for at least four months .
surgery is usually not implicated. with adequate treatment , clinical remission is practically 100 % .
it is recommended that people in close contact , such as family members , should undergo testing for tb. there are numerous investigations to be taken prior to initiating anti - tb treatment .
these include a full blood count , a urea and electrolytes test , uric acid analysis , liver function tests , hiv screening , chest x - ray and three sputum acid - fast bacillus smears ( to ensure no pulmonary involvement ) .
visual acuity and fields should be documented prior to treatment .
for the first two months , a regime of four drugs is used : isoniazid 5 mg / kg , rifampicin 10 mg / kg , pyrazinamide 20 mg / kg , ethambutol 25 mg / kg and pyridoxine 10 mg once daily .
thereafter , a three - weekly regime can be used for a following four or more months : isoniazid 10 mg / kg , rifampicin 10 mg / kg and pyridoxine 10 mg once daily [ 13 ] .
local infectious disease departments should be contacted for advice and risk stratification .
conclusion our patient and her family were convinced there was an underlying malignant process and therefore she lived with these recurrent lumps and abscesses for years , undergoing daily dressings and multiple courses of antibiotics .
she was very relieved to get a diagnosis of neck lymph node tb and overwhelmed to learn that the treatment basically has a 100 % success rate .
there is a high false negative culture result from superficial swabs , therefore a biopsy with culture should be considered if there is a high degree of clinical suspicion .
it is important to realize that patients aged over 65 years have waning immunity and therefore are a vulnerable group for infections as well as re - activation .
post - splenectomy patients are at a major disadvantage in sepsis and also in cellular immunity , as in the required response for m. tuberculosis infection .

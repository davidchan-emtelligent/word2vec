background ecstasy is one of the popular illicit drugs in the world and its usage has been recently increased in iran .
this compound can destroy the serotonergic neurons and produces cognitive and psychopathology diseases .
3,4 - dihydroxymethamphetamine ( hhma ) which is the main metabolite of this compound , seems to be responsible for this effect .
however , no consensus has been reached among the researchers about its role .
this disagreement between the researches may be due to failure in determination of hhma as free form in physiological fluids .
in this study , the stability of this crucial metabolite of ecstasy was examined in different mediums .
methods the stability of hhma was studied in the perfusion medium and water at 100 and 10 ng / ml concentrations .
moreover , the effect of temperature ( 0 - 25degreesc ) , ph ( 3 - 10 ) , calcium chloride ( 0 - 150 g / l ) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( edta ) on the stability of hhma was also examined .
results our result suggested that the free form of hhma could be degraded in the perfusion medium .
the rate of this degradation has direct proportion to temperature ( at 25degreesc = 0.037 min - 1 and at 0degreesc = 0.002 min - 1 ) .
calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate are two responsible components in this instability .
moreover , the alkaline phs and increasing the shaking time can accelerate this effect .
although , while degradation was prevented at ph = 3 , edta could only reduce this rate about 30 % .
conclusions calcium cation can act as an accelerator of hhma degradation .
therefore , the perfusion medium should not contain ca2 + and the ph of medium is better to be adjusted at acidic range .
since , the internal cellular source of calcium is endoplasmic reticulum system , it can be assumed that , this cation may change hhma and dopamine to reactive compounds that can bind covalently to the cysteinyl group of biological compounds and damage cellular components .
hhma hptlc - ms stability calcium chloride neurotoxicity introduction ecstasy ( 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine , mdma ) is one of the popular drugs of abuse among youths .
the tendency toward this compound has increased since the last two decades [ 1,2 ] .
in 2009 , it was reported that 2.8 million of americans over 12 years old have abused mdma at least once [ 3 ] .
the usage of this compound has been recently increased among iranian youths as well [ 4,5 ] .
mdma is a releaser and reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and dopamine which can destroy serotonin axon terminal of brain and produces cognitive dysfunction and psychopathology diseases in humans .
however , the mechanism behind this phenomenon is not clearly known [ 2,6,7 ] .
it was reported that the intracranial administration of mdma in animals does not produce any neurotoxic effects .
however , the peripheral administration can do so [ 7 ] .
this result and some other reports proposed that mdma metabolites may have a role in its neurotoxic activity [ 7,8 ] .
mdma is metabolized via either o - demethylation or n - dealkylation in humans and rats .
n - dealkylation pathways produce 3,4 - methylenedioxyamphetamine ( mda ) which is known as " love drug " and has similar pharmacological effects to mdma [ 1 ] .
o - demethylation produces reactive catechol metabolite , i.e. 3,4 - dihydroxymethamphetamine ( hhma ) ( figure 1 ) .
hhma is the main metabolite of mdma in urine and plasma which exist in conjugated form ( sulfate and glutathione ) and there is no report for determination of its free form in biological fluids [ 2,7 ] .
it has been reported that hhma conjugated with glutathione could produce apoptosis on rat hipocampal neurons [ 8 ] .
figure 1 structure of mdma and its metabolites over the years , different reports have been published about the neurotoxicity associated with mdma metabolites .
some reports proposed that mda is responsible for such an effect [ 6 ] and the others have introduced hhma and thioether adducts as the toxic metabolite which cause apoptosis and damage in the cells [ 7,8 ] .
this controversy may be due to the failure in determination of hhma as a free form in brain after mdma administration .
hhma , due to its catecholamine structure , can display various properties .
the catecholamine moiety is prone to oxidation and formation of ortho quinone - like structure .
oxidizing agents such as clo - , mno4 - and etc. , alkaline phs and light can trigger this reaction [ 9 ] .
moreover , mda can also be o - demethylated and form another metabolite with catecholamine structure which can exert similar properties with hhma [ 2 ] .
to the best of our knowledge , there are no reports about hhma stability in physiological fluids and there are only some reports regarding the stability of dopamine which has the closest structure to hhma .
these reports indicate that dopamine , in the presence of oxidizing agents like mn3 + or naio4 , is converted to the reactive compounds such as aminochrome ( ac ) , indole - 5,6 - quinone and 5,6 - dihydroxyindole .
these reactive compounds can bind covalently to the cysteinyl group of biological compounds in the body and damage cellular components such as dna , proteins and lipids .
the role of these reactive compounds in alzheimer 's and parkinson 's has been established ( figure 2 ) [ 10,11 ] .
figure 2 the oxidation pathway of dopamine [ 10 ] .
due to the ethical and safety issues , studying the metabolism changes of illicit or toxic compounds at high concentration in human subjects is constrained .
therefore , the kinetic of these compounds is preferred to be studied in similar systems to human such as isolated animal organs .
in these cases , the perfusion medium is used instead of plasma [ 12 ] .
however , the stability of the compounds and their related metabolites in the perfusion medium is of important concern .
since mdma is an illicit compound and can cause multi organ failure , especially liver damage and death at high concentrations [ 13 ] , its metabolic transformation is preferred to be studied in intact animals or in in vitro perfused organs .
in the present study , stability of hhma in perfusion medium was examined .
the constituents of this medium appear in almost all of physiological fluids of human body .
determination of the possible effect of these constituents on the stability of hhma free form could help researcher to determine the role of hhma in mdma neurotoxicity .
materials and methods chemicals ultrapure water was obtained from millipore direct - q system ( france ) .
hhma was synthesized in four steps , from commercially available 3,4 - dimethoxy - benzaldehyde and nitroethane , through procedures previously reported [ 8 ] .
dopamine was a gift from caspian tamin pharmaceutical company .
hplc ( high performance liquid chromatography ) grade methanol and all other chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from merck ( darmstadt , germany ) .
the krebs buffer ( 6.903 g / l nacl , 0.335 g / l kcl , 0.162 g / l kh2po4 , 0.163 g / l mgso4 , 0.305 g / l cacl2 , 2.1 g / l nahco3 and 1 g / l glucose , ph was adjusted to 7.2 - 7.4 ) was used as a perfusion medium .
apparatuses and chromatographic conditions the knauer chromatographic system which was used , consisted of a pump model k - 1001 , a fluorescence detector ( fl ) model rf - 10axl , a photodiode array ( pda ) detector model k - 2800 , a solvent degasser and a 100 mul loop injector .
ezchrom elite software was used for instrument control , data acquisition and analysis .
the separation of analytes was performed at ambient temperature ( 25degreesc ) on the chromolith ( r ) performance rp - 18e ( 100 x 4.6 mm ) column with chromolith ( r ) rp - 18e ( 5 x 4.6 mm ) guard from merck ( darmstadt , germany ) .
the fl detector wavelength was fixed at 285 nm for excitation and at 320 nm for emission and pda wavelength was fixed at 285 nm. the mobile phase was 0.02 m potassium dihydrogen phosphate ( kh2po4 ) solution with ph = 3 ( orthophosphoric acid was used for ph adjustment ) .
the cecil uv spectrophotometer model ce9500 and camag high performance thin layer chromatographic ( hptlc ) system consisted of a camag tlc scanner 3 , a tlc automatic developing chamber and a camag automatic tlc sampler 4 with a pda and fl detectors , were used .
in the hptlc system , the separation was performed on hptlc plates coated with silicagel 60 f254 ( 10 x 10 cm ) from merck ( darmstadt , germany ) .
a mixture of dioxane : methanol : chloroform : acid acetic ( 6:1:1:1,v / v / v / v ) was used as the mobile phase .
the instrument was controlled and the data were analyzed by wincats planar chromatography manager software .
tlc plates developed by hptlc were subjected for tlc - mass spectrometry using a 1200 agilent hplc pump coupled to a agilent electrospray ionization ( esi ) mass detector ( 6410 triple quadrupole ) through a camag tlc - ms interface .
methanol was used for elution of tlc spots to the mass detector .
the mass detector was operated in positive mode ( esi +) and the fragmentor voltage was 60 v. detection was performed in full scan mode .
stability study the stability of five replicate samples of hhma at concentrations of 100 and 10 ng / ml , at ambient temperature ( 25degreesc ) and 0degreesc , in both perfusion medium and water was examined for 24 hours .
in the case of perfusion medium , the stability was checked at 0 , 5 , 15 , 30 , 60 , 120 and 180 min , and in the case of water , samples were taken at 0 , 5 , 15 , 30 , 60 , 120 , 180 , 240 min and 24 hours .
these samples were analyzed by the hplc / fl for the determination of hhma residual in corresponding medium .
the impact of perfusion medium components on hhma stability was examined separately on 5 replicate samples ( at a concentration appeared in perfusion medium ) of the 100 ng / ml aqueous solution of hhma .
samples were analyzed immediately after dissolving the component by the hplc / fl and were compared with the 100 ng / ml freshly prepared samples of hhma in water .
the influence of ph ( 3 - 10 ) and different concentration ( up to saturated concentration ) of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( edta ) on the stability of hhma in perfusion medium was also investigated .
moreover , the stability of hhma in water in the presence of calcium chloride ( cacl2 ) ( concentration 0 - 150 g / l ) was studied .
samples were analyzed by hplc / uv immediately after the changes were made and the results were compared with the results obtained for freshly prepared samples of hhma in corresponding medium .
this part was done on 5 replicate samples of 1 mug / ml solution of hhma .
the effect of cacl2 ( 150 g / l ) on the stability of hhma aqueous solution ( 1 mug / ml ) was also examined by hptlc system on 3 replicate samples .
in another part of the present study , those components which were supposed to be responsible for instability of hhma in perfusion medium were also examined , for their impact on the stability of dopamine ( 1 mug / ml aqueous solutions ) .
statistics the t - independent test was used for determination of differences between means of groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
results and discussion the 100 and 10 ng / ml solutions of hhma in water were stable at ambient temperature and 0degreesc for 24 hours .
no significant differences between area under the curve ( auc ) of peak of freshly prepared samples and tests were observed ( n = 5 , p > 0.05 ) , whereas the 100 and 10 ng / ml solutions of hhma in perfusion medium were unstable .
after 2 hours , about 100 % of the 100 ng / ml solution of hhma was degraded at ambient temperature ( kdegradation = 0.037 min - 1 ( 0.030 - 0.047 ) at 25degreesc ) and a new small peak appeared in the hplc / fl chromatogram .
reduction of the temperature to 0degreesc could reduce the rate of degradation , so that after 2 hours , only about 20 % of the 100 ng / ml solution of hhma was degraded ( kdegradation = 0.002 min - 1 ( 0.0006 - 0.003 ) at 0degreesc ) ( figure 3 ) .
in the case of 10 ng / ml solution of hhma in perfusion medium , the similar pattern was observed .
figure 3 the degradation rate of 100 ng / ml solution of hhma in perfusion medium at ambient temperature and 0degreesc .
points shown as mean +/ - sd , n = 5 while the reduction of ph to 3 could stop the degradation reaction , increasing the ph could accelerate degradation rate , in such a way that the corresponding peak to hhma in hplc / fl or hplc / uv chromatograms disappeared rapidly after ph was reached to 9 .
the hhma peak disappearance was permanent and by reducing the ph of the alkaline samples to 3 , the hhma peak did not appear again ( figure 4 ) .
figure 4 the effect of ph on degradation of hhma ( 1 mug / ml ) in water ( a ) and perfusion medium ( b ) at ambient temperature .
a1 : at ph = 9 ; a2 : changing the ph of alkaline sample to 3 ; a3 : at ph = 3 ; b1 : at ph = 9 ; b2 : changing the ph of alkaline sample to 3 ; b3 : at ph = 3 ; b4 : at ph = 7.3 .
our results were in accordance with gouarne et al. report [ 14 ] .
they reported that the degradation rate of catecholamins is in direct proportion with ph of medium .
the hydroxyl groups in the catecholamine structure deprotonate easier at phs higher than 3 and form the corresponding quinone structure readily .
at high phs , quinine structures are susceptible to oxidation , cyclization and polymerization [ 10,11 ] .
it should be mentioned that the ph of aqueous solutions of hhma was about 3 and perhaps due to this reason , hhma has been stable in these aqueous solutions .
adding edta to the hhma solution in perfusion medium , even at a saturated concentration could only reduce the rate of degradation about 30 % .
it has been reported that mgcl2 and cacl2 enhances the oxidation of ascorbate [ 15 ] .
edta , due to its chelating property , can reduce the rate of oxidation reaction by sequestering the ca2 + and mg2 + , but this chelator was not effective in inhibition of hhma peak reduction .
in order to further investigate this phenomenon , the components of perfusion medium ( at their concentrations in perfusion medium ) were added to hhma aqueous solution separately .
adding mgso4 , nacl , kcl , kh2po4 or glucose did not affect the auc of hhma peak even after 2 hours .
these results indicated that mg2 + , which is a crucial cation in catechol - o - methyltransferase ( comt , an enzymes that play a role in catecholamine degradation ) activity [ 16 ] and can bind to hydroxyl ring of catecholamine at phs higher than 7 [ 17 ] , has no effect on hhma instability .
however , cacl2 and nahco3 were the components which caused hhma concentration to reduce .
in case of nahco3 , the reduction of hhma concentration was expected due to its ability in increasing the ph of solutions .
however , the observed rate for concentration reduction of hhma , was slower than the observed rate for hhma in perfusion medium .
in addition to nahco3 , cacl2 could cause reduction in concentration of hhma in aqueous solution .
when the concentration of cacl2 increased from 0.3 to 150 g / l , the auc of hhma peak reduced faster .
moreover , increasing the shaking time from 5 to 60 seconds reduced the auc of hhma peak , significantly .
the hptlc analysis of hhma aqueous solution in the presence of cacl2 showed that a new spot appeared in the chromatogram after adding cacl2 ( 150 g / l ) with the rf = 0.25 .
this spot did not exist in the chromatograms of hhma or cacl2 aqueous solutions alone .
mass spectroscopic analysis of this spot on a triple quadruple mass detector revealed that its molecular weight is different from that of hhma .
moreover , the uv spectrum of this spot was different from the uv spectrum of hhma aqueous solution ( figures 5 and 6 ) .
the same results were obtained in all replication .
these results indicated that hhma has changed to other compounds in the presence of cacl2 .
there are no reports in the literature about a direct role of cacl2 in oxidation of catecolamines .
it seems that cl - has no impact on stability of hhma , because adding nacl could not reduce the auc of hhma peak over 2 hours .
it could be speculated that calcium cation ( ca2 +) , due to free d - orbital in its electronic configuration , can act as a catalyst or something like that in this phenomenon , but magnesium cation ( mg2 +) , due to the lack of this free d - orbital , cannot play such role .
figure 5 the hptlc chromatogram of hhma ( 1 mug / ml ) in water and in the presence of cacl2 ( 150 g / l ) .
figure 6 extracted ion chromatogram at ( m / z182 ) of hhma ( 1 mug / ml ) in the absence ( a ) and in the presence ( b ) of cacl2 ( 150 g / l ) .
it has been reported that hhma can be oxidized to related ortho quinone compounds that react with nucleophilic groups of macromolecules or form neurotoxins [ 8,18 ] .
moreover , hhma can change to carbene intermediate and covalently bind to heme iron of cyp2d6 in the biological systems [ 18,19 ] .
beside hhma , dopamine , which is structurally the most similar compound to hhma , is oxidized in the presence of mno2 and naio4 to the reactive ortho quinone compounds which covalently bind to cysteinyl group of proteins and impair their functions .
moreover , reactive ortho quinone compounds are responsible for neurodegenerative process of dopaminergic system .
when the oxidizing agents were added to the aqueous solutions of dopamine , the absorption intensity at lambda = 280 nm decreased and two new peaks appeared at lambda = 300 and 475 nm in the uv spectrum , which were associated with ac structure [ 10,11 ] .
the similar pattern changes were reported in the uv spectrum of hhma when oxidized electrochemicaly [ 8 ] .
in our study , such a phenomenon was observed when the cacl2 was added to aqueous solution of dopamine .
in the uv spectrum when cacl2 ( 150 g / l ) was added to 1 mug / ml dopamine aqueous solution , the intensity of the absorption at lambda = 276 nm decreased , and after 10 min a new peak at lambda = 294 and a small peak at about 455 nm appeared .
in light of the above observations , it could be speculated that hhma , in the presence of cacl2 , is oxidized to its corresponding aminochrome like structures .
therefore , in study of mdma effect on isolated organs , the perfusion medium should not contain cacl2 or ca2 + .
however , calcium cation has a crucial role in cell biological activity , vesicle movement and exocytosis [ 20 ] .
the total vesicular concentration of ca2 + is about 1.6 g / l and the main internal source of this cation is endoplasmic reticulum .
in addition to , cyp450 isoenzymes are located and activated in endoplasmic reticulum .
therefore , the role of this cation in generating reactive ortho quinonic compounds and neurotoxicity associated with mdma could be speculated .
conclusion serotonin neuron damage which is related to the mdma metabolites is one of crucial aspect of mdma side effects .
different reports have been published about this effect , some of them suggesting hhma as the neurotoxic metabolite of mdma , while other reports suggest mda as the neurotoxin .
one of the possible reasons for this controversy can be due to failure in hhma determination as a free form in these studies .
the results of our study indicated that ca2 + besides sodium bicarbonate can be responsible components in hhma concentration reduction in perfusion medium .
in order to obtain reliable results in these cases , the perfusion medium should not contain ca2 + and the ph of medium is better to be adjusted at acidic range .
moreover , ca2 + can play a role in dopamine conversion to ac , which has a distinctive role in neurodegenerative process of dopaminergic system .
in summary , it would be possible that ca2 + accelerates hhma degradation or plays a role in producing neurodegenerative diseases associated with dopamine or mdma neurotoxicity .

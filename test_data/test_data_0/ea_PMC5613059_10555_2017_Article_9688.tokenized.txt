head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( hnscc ) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide .
there is an urgent need to develop effective therapeutic approaches to prevent and treat hnscc .
recent deep sequencing of the hnscc genomic landscape revealed a multiplicity and diversity of genetic alterations in this malignancy .
although a large variety of specific molecules were found altered in each individual tumor , they all participate in only a handful of driver signaling pathways .
among them , the pi3k / mtor pathway is the most frequently activated , which plays a central role in cancer initiation and progression .
in turn , targeting of mtor may represent a precision therapeutic approach for hnscc .
indeed , mtor inhibition exerts potent anti - tumor activity in hnscc experimental systems , and mtor targeting clinical trials show encouraging results .
however , advanced hnscc patients may exhibit unpredictable drug resistance , and the analysis of its molecular basis suggests that co - targeting strategies may provide a more effective option .
in addition , although counterintuitive , emerging evidence suggests that mtor inhibition may enhance the anti - tumor immune response .
these new findings raise the possibility that the combination of mtor inhibitors and immune oncology agents may provide novel precision therapeutic options for hnscc .
keywords mtor head and neck cancer precision therapy immune oncology issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer science + business media , llc 2017 background head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( hnscc ) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide .
as a major public health concern , hnscc arises in the oral cavity , larynx , and pharynx , affecting approximate 600,000 patients each year [ 1 ] , only 40 - 50 % of which will survive more than 5 years [ 2 ] .
the leading risk factors include the use of tobacco , alcohol , and betel quid and areca nut chewing , while high - risk human papillomavirus ( hpv ) infection has emerged as a major risk factor , nowadays accounting for more than 20 % of all hnscc cases [ 3 ] .
currently , the main therapeutic modalities include surgery , radiation , and chemotherapy .
however , these nonselective treatments may cause associated morbidity and mortality and usually have high systemic toxicities .
cetuximab , a monoclonal antibody - inhibiting egfr , is the only cancer - targeting agent approved for hnscc , although only ~ 10 % of hnscc patients respond to this agent and often for a short period of time [ 4 , 5 ] .
two immune check point inhibitors targeting pd - 1 have been recently approved by the fda for hnscc patients , albeit the rate of response is approximately 20 % , lower than that of other malignancies , such as melanoma [ 6 - 14 ] .
there is an urgent need to develop new effective strategies to prevent and treat hnscc .
understanding the contribution of genomic alterations driving hnscc initiation and progression may help explore novel precision therapeutic options .
genomic landscape in head and neck cancer deep sequencing approaches for the study of cancer genomes have recently revolutionized medical oncology [ 15 ]. by providing an unprecedented knowledge of the multiplicity and diversity of genomic and epigenetic alterations which underlie every individual cancer lesion , these approaches deepen the understanding of dysregulated signaling circuitries and molecular mechanisms driving cancer development .
based on these information , novel druggable targets for therapeutic interventions in various human malignancies have been revealed .
several recent reports [ 16 - 19 ] and a landmark study from the cancer genome atlas ( tcga ) network [ 1 ] has provided a comprehensive genomic characterization of hnscc , revealing hundreds of mutations in each hnscc lesion .
this complexity of genomic alterations makes it daunting to search for molecular events driving the development of cancer , especially to differentiate driver from passenger mutations , the latter having a minimal influence on tumor progression and / or therapeutic response .
however , in - depth analysis of the hnscc oncogenome suggests that despite the complexity of the distinct molecular alterations in individual lesions , they all fall within a limited number of dysregulated molecular pathways that may contribute to most hnscc patients [ 1 , 3 ] .
specifically , the most frequently identified alterations in hnscc participate in biologic processes regulated by the tp53 ( 71 % mutated ) , fat1 ( 23 % mutated and 5 % deleted ) , notch1 ( 9 % mutated and 66 % signaling pathway alterations ) , casp8 ( 10 % mutated ) , cdkn2a ( 22 % mutated and 60 % gene copy loss ) genes , and pik3ca (~ 20 % mutated and 30 % signaling pathway alterations ) [ 3 ] .
this reductionist approach based on comprehensive genomic profiling may be exploited to distinguish oncogenic signaling - related subgroups from unselected cancer cohorts and facilitate the identification of actionable therapeutic targets for hnscc patients .
activation of pi3k - mtor signaling pathway in head and neck cancer a more pathway - specific analysis of the hnscc oncogenome suggests that most genomic alterations are involved in aberrant mitogenic signaling routes , including the pi3k , mapk , and jak / stat pathways [ 17 ] .
remarkably , the pi3k - mtor pathway is mutated in the highest percentage of the cases .
in contrasts , mapk and jak / stat pathways harbor mutations in less than 10 % of the lesions .
specifically for pi3k , the in - depth analysis of tcga data from 428 hpv - and 76 hpv + hnscc samples [ 20 ] revealed that pik3ca is the highest mutated gene when considering all hnscc cases ( 16.8 %) , and pi3k mutations ( pik3ca , pik3cb , pik3cg , and pik3cd ) are frequently mutated genes in 30 % of the hpv + lesions .
moreover , pi3k mutations are not the only genomic alterations causing the persistent activation of pi3k / akt / mtor pathway in hnscc .
various genetic and epigenetic changes coordinate with pi3k mutations to sustain activation of this pathway in hnscc ( fig. 1 ). fig. 1 frequent genetic alterations of pi3k / mtor signaling pathway in hnscc .
data was extracted from the hnscc cancer genome anatomy ( tcga ) effort , including 428 hpv ( - ) and 76 hpv (+) hnscc samples .
alterations identified in each key gene are shown , percentages outside and inside parentheses represent hpv ( - ) and hpv (+) samples , respectively .
red represents oncogene mutations and amplifications , and green represents tumor suppressor gene mutations and copy losses ( copy loss refers to homozygous and heterozygous deletion of genes ) for instance , dna copy number gain and messenger rna ( mrna ) overexpression of pik3ca frequently occur in hnscc ( 20 and 52 % , respectively ) .
other pi3k isoforms and multiple pi3k regulatory subunits also have mutations and copy number gains ( 0.5 - 11 %) .
over 90 % of hnscc lesions overexpressed the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) , which is upstream of pi3k / akt signaling , a major driver of epithelial cell proliferation. and a low frequency of hnscc cases has mutations in akt2 and mtor or its regulatory subunits , rictor and raptor .
a network - based analysis of the hnscc oncogene revealed that a high percentage of lesions also exhibit loss of at least one copy of a candidate pi3k / mtor pathway tumor suppressor gene ( tsg ) , pten ( 31 %) , tsc1 ( 11 %) , tsc2 ( 13 %) , stk11 ( 34 %) , and eif4ebp1 ( 36 %) [ 20 ] .
interestingly , co - occurrence of their gene loss is a highly statistically significant event ( table 1 ) .
similarly , pik3ca amplification co - occurs in a highly statistically significant fashion with gene copy gains in pi3kcb , encoding the pi3kbeta subunit .
these occurrences of multiple alterations may cooperate to persistently activate pi3k / akt / mtor pathway in most hnscc lesions .
table 1 frequent co - occurrence of genomic alterations in oscc .
co - occurrence and mutually exclusivity in genomic alterations in the pi3k / mtor signaling network ( fig. 1 ) was computed using the cbioportal bioinformatics platform .
significant interactions ( p < 0.05 ) were included gene - gene p value log odds ratio association pik3ca - pik3cb < 0.001 > 3 co - occurrence pten - tsc2 < 0.001 0.917 co - occurrence stk11 - tsc2 < 0.001 0.889 co - occurrence stk11 - tsc1 < 0.001 1.021 co - occurrence pik3cb - pik3cg 0.004 1.524 co - occurrence hras - stk11 0.017 < - 3 mutual exclusivity stk11 - eif4ebp1 0.022 0.403 co - occurrence pik3cb - pten 0.032 0.592 co - occurrence hras - pten 0.041 < - 3 mutual exclusivity hpv infection has been recently recognized as a viral etiologic agent responsible for hnscc , more specifically in the oropharynx [ 21 , 22 ] .
while the overall incidence for hnscc continues to decrease , it is observed that the incidence of hpv - associated hnscc has a highly significant increase , predominantly among young patients [ 23 - 25 ] .
among the viral proteins encoded by high - risk hpvs ( hpv16 primarily in hnscc ) , e6 and e7 function as major driver oncogenic proteins. by disrupting p53 and rb tumor suppressor proteins , respectively [ 26 - 28 ] , e6 and e7 induce malignant transformation .
recent findings suggest that hpv + hnscc has a significant enrichment of pik3ca mutations ( 25 % more than hpv - ) and exhibit elevated mtor activity [ 1 , 29 - 31 ]. of note , e6 and e7 oncoproteins could not be therapeutically targeted so far , making it essential to explore druggable targets for hpv + hnscc , in which mtor inhibition provides suitable therapeutic options [ 31 ] .
taken together , the above findings suggest that , although genomic alterations found in hnscc varies and are remarkably complex , most fall within certain oncogenic pathways , most of which result in persistent aberrant activation of the mtor signaling pathway .
the roles of mtor signaling pathway in cancer the mtor ( mechanistic target of rapamycin ) pathway regulates major cellular processes involved in organismal growth and homeostasis [ 32 - 34 ] .
dysregulation of this pathway occurs in multiple human diseases , such as cancer , obesity , type ii diabetes , and neurodegeneration , to name but a few [ 33 ] .
in the past decades , mtor - dependent processes have been continuously uncovered .
briefly , mtor is an atypical serine / threonine protein kinase. by interacting with several proteins , mtor encompasses two distinct protein complexes : mtor complex 1 ( mtorc1 ) ( which includes raptor , pras40 , deptor , and mlst8 ) and mtor complex 2 ( mtorc2 ) ( which includes rictor , msin1 , protor1 / 2 , deptor , and mlst8 ) [ 33 ]. through phosphorylation of two key eukaryotic translation regulators , p70s6k ( p70 - s6 kinase ) and eif4ebp1 ( 4ebp1 , short for eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e binding protein 1 ) , mtorc1 regulates ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis .
in addition , mtorc1 also controls lipid synthesis , autophagy , and metabolism by targeting key effectors srebp1 / 2 , hif1alpha , and ulk1 / atg13 / fip200 , respectively [ 32 , 33 ] .
mtorc2 directly phosphorylates akt at s473 , and mtorc2 is required for activation of sgk1 , known as serum and glucocorticoid - regulated kinase 1 , and plays an essential role in multiple processes including cell survival , neuronal excitability , and renal sodium excretion [ 35 - 38 ] .
collectively , the mtor pathway regulates cell growth and components of the pathway are key molecules involved in numerous pathological conditions .
specifically for cancer pathogenesis , many studies have documented the important role of mtor pathway .
evidence shows that deregulation of protein synthesis controlled by 4e - bp / eif4e , downstream of mtorc1 , plays a central role [ 39 - 43 ] .
it is thought that mtor phosphorylates and represses the inhibitory activity of 4e - bp1 on eif4e , affecting the translation of mrna coding for a subset of pro - oncogenic proteins , including cmyc and cyclin d1 [ 41 , 43 - 49 ] .
lipid synthesis is characterized as a hallmark for proliferation of cancer cells [ 50 ] .
srebp1 , a central pro - lipogenic factor , can be activated by mtorc1 [ 51 ] .
autophagy has both tumor suppressive and cancer cell survival protective effects .
in a nutrient and oxygen deprivation environment , autophagy makes cancer cells insensitive to these stressors and provides survival advantage .
meanwhile , autophagy may cause apoptosis due to lack of energy storage .
activation of mtorc1 signaling inhibits autophagy in cancer cells and may protect against autophagy - induced apoptosis [ 33 , 52 ] .
in addition to mtorc1 , recent studies suggest mtorc2 plays a distinct role in multiple cancer types .
the mtorc2 - akt - foxo circuit regulates proliferation , angiogenesis , and apoptosis [ 53 - 55 ] .
these evidences point to the importance of mtor pathway in cancer initiation and progression .
due to the recent characterization of molecular alterations found in hnscc , we now know that the pi3k / mtor signaling circuitry is the most frequent dysregulated signaling pathway in hnscc , as described above .
thus , the use of precise molecular therapeutic approaches to reduce the activity of the mtor pathway could have anti - cancer effects in hnscc , and the dissection of the underlying mechanisms may help select the patient population that will benefit the most from this therapy .
targeting mtor signaling pathway in head and neck cancer rapamycin , also known as sirolimus , represents the first generation of mtor inhibitors .
it was firstly used as an immunosuppressant since the 1970s .
despite its anti - cancer activity being discovered in the early 1980s , the application of rapamycin for cancer therapy was not exploited until the late 1990s [ 32 ] .
a class of drugs that target mtor , termed rapamycin analogues ( also known as rapalogs ) , were subsequently developed [ 56 - 58 ] .
rapamycin and rapalogs block primarily mtor in its complex 1 ( mtorc1 ) indirectly by binding to fkbp12 , while a second generation of mtor inhibitors block mtor kinase directly , hence inhibiting both mtorc1 and mtorc2 [ 34 , 57 - 59 ] .
to investigate the effectiveness of mtor inhibitors in hnscc , a series of experimental models has been established .
our group pioneered the use of rapamycin as a single agent to treat hnscc xenografts ; rapamycin rapidly decreased mtor activity , as indicated by its marker , ps6 , and caused rapid tumor regression [ 60 ] .
since then , several groups demonstrated anti - cancer effect of rapalogs in hnscc xenografts either as a single agent or when combined with chemotherapy / radiotherapy [ 61 - 66 ] .
genetically relevant cell lines are necessary for xenograft models , and in recent studies , we reported the detailed characterization of a large panel of hnscc - derived cell lines by performing exome and transcriptome sequencing [ 30 ] .
not surprisingly , genetic alteration in pik3ca , hras , pten , and other agents which results in pi3k - mtor pathway activation were identified in those panels , consistent with the hnscc genomic landscape described above .
these efforts facilitated the identification of biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment , providing selective precision models for xenograft studies [ 30 , 67 ] .
patient - derived tumorgraft ( pdx ) models maintain the tumor heterogeneity of the primary tumor ; thus , they may be better for clinical outcome prediction .
many recent studies reported the effectiveness of mtor inhibitors in hnscc pdx models [ 68 - 70 ] .
meanwhile , chemically induced mouse scc experimental models were also established .
the dmba - tpa two - stage chemical - induced carcinogenesis is widely used as a mouse scc experimental model , and in genetically defined animals , such as mice conditionally expressing hpv e6 / e7 , or lacking pten or tgfbr1 , dmba - tpa induces more scc lesions and more rapidly [ 71 - 73 ] .
another carcinogen , 4 - nitroquinoline - 1 - oxide ( 4nqo ) that mimics tobacco use , was optimized in our laboratory as an oral - specific chemical carcinogenesis model [ 74 ] .
using drinking water with soluble 4nqo , oral tumors could be developed in the tongue within several weeks .
in both chemical carcinogenesis - induced models , persistent mtor activation was observed , which could be blocked by administration of rapamycin , hence causing regression of sccs [ 71 - 74 ] .
overall , these experimental efforts led to a rationale for using mtor inhibitors as a novel precision therapeutic approach for hnscc .
several mtor inhibitors are being used either alone or in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy in hnscc clinical trials , including rapamycin ( sirolimus ) , everolimus ( rad001 ) , temsirolimus ( cci - 779 ) , and others , as summarized in table 2 .
most clinical trials using mtor inhibitors in hnscc are under evaluation or have been recently completed .
our study treating newly diagnosed hnscc patients with rapamycin ( nct01195922 ) showed encouraging outcomes , as the majority of the patients ( 15 of 16 ) gained clinical improvement , including one patient with complete response [ 75 ] .
meanwhile , metformin , a drug with well - established safety profile routinely used in type ii diabetes patients , has been discovered as a potential anti - cancer agent by reducing mtor activity in experimental animal models [ 76 , 77 ] .
a multi - institutional phase iia trial ( nct02581137 ) in patients with oral premalignant lesion ( opl ) has been initiated to evaluate the effect metformin for oral cancer prevention .
it is expected that the patients with hnscc or opl could benefit from these experimental efforts and relevant clinical trials .

however , the clinical efficacy of several agents is frequently compromised due to the emergence of drug resistance .
specifically for therapeutic drugs targeting the mtor pathway , despite the fact that promising outcomes were achieved using mtor inhibitors in experimental models and rapamycin showed encouraging result in the adjuvant setting in a hnscc clinical trial ( nct01195922 , table 2 ) , advanced hnscc patients may still display unpredictable drug resistance .
one possible reason is that hnscc patients , similar to other cancer types , usually receive multiple rounds of radiation and chemotherapy .
this may cause dna damage ; thus , the consequent genetic alterations and epigenetic regulation can induce the emergence of drug resistance .
understanding the molecular basis of potential drug resistance has emerged to be a formidable challenge .
to date , diverse mechanisms of drug resistance have been discovered , including adaptive changes impacting drug pharmacokinetics ( such as absorption , distribution , metabolism , and excretion ) , structural changes in the drug - binding domain of targeted molecules , and ( re ) activation of pro - survival signaling pathway .
mechanisms of resistance vary depending on the individual drug .
for example , metformin , a novel drug candidate for cancer prevention , is proved to inhibit mtor signaling [ 78 ] , and low expression of organic cation transporter 3 ( oct3 / slc22a3 ) , a metformin uptake transporter [ 77 , 79 ] causes resistance to metformin .
the immunodetection of oct3 expression levels in hnscc cases provide a surrogate marker which may predict a favorable response to metformin , and on the other hand , it may also suggest that patients with low oct3 expression may be excluded from metformin trials [ 77 , 79 ] .
changes in the structure of drug target proteins are frequently observed in experimental models when cell lines were continuously exposed to certain precision medicines .
selective pressure leads tumor cells to develop resistant subpopulations .
it is reasonable to predict that a patient with long - term use of a drug may experience similar situations .
structure - based functional design of drugs could be used to optimize existing compounds to target altered drug - insensitive proteins .
for example , deep sequencing of mcf7 breast cancer cells acquiring mtor resistance revealed the juxtaposition of the binding sites of rapamycin and azd8055 , an mtor kinase inhibitor .
based on this knowledge , it was possible to develop a bivalent mtor inhibitor .
this third - generation mtor inhibitor , named rapalink - 1 , maintained activity in both rapamycin - resistant and azd8055 - resistant xenografts in breast cancer [ 80 ] .
this drug discovery effort provides opportunities for precision medicine approaches to target mtor for cancer therapy .
perhaps more often , targeted agents promote the activation of adaptive survival signaling in tumor cells , either by the same or parallel pathways to mtor .
for example , rapamycin - induced feedback phosphorylation and activation of akt signaling is frequently reported [ 81 - 84 ] .
also , mtor inhibition by rapamycin and other tor kinase inhibitors induces tyrosine receptor kinase and erk / mapk feedback activation [ 84 - 87 ] .
low expression of 4e binding protein 1 ( 4ebp1 ) , a primary downstream substrate of mtor suppressing eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e ( eif4e ) , may confer resistance to mtor inhibitors [ 39 - 41 ] .
other dysregulations include p27 , pp2a , pim , and many others , but their roles in resistance to mtor inhibition are less characterized [ 33 ] .
to date , precision therapeutic strategies , mtor inhibition included , are designed based on the concept of oncogene addiction , in which the growth and survival of cancer cells can be often impaired once one single oncogene is inhibited [ 88 ] .
however , the discoveries of drug resistance bring to attention the importance of co - targeting strategies .
in fact , numerous clinical trials using mtor inhibitors are being carried out in combination with other targeted therapy ( table 2 ) .
the knowledge of the mechanism of resistance to mtor inhibition may provide optimized second target ( s ) to be combined with as a therapeutic option .
for instance , compensatory increased akt and / or erk signaling after mtor inhibition are responsible for tumor relapse and their targeted agents have been widely investigated [ 81 - 87 ] .
consistent with the above findings , we recently performed a synthetic lethality screen using shrna libraries in hnscc cell lines and found that co - targeting numerous molecules involved in erk / mapk pathway sensitizes the growth suppressive activities of mtor inhibition .
indeed , trametinib , a mek1 / 2 inhibitor , exhibited a synergistic effect by sensitizing hnscc to rapamycin [ 89 ] .
in another study , co - targeting mtor with cetuximab , a monoclonal antibody targeting egfr that acts upstream of both akt and erk pathway , prevented the growth of hnscc tumor xenografts by decreasing cell proliferation and lymphangiogenesis [ 90 ]. of importance , safety of cetuximab has been proven and its combination with mtor inhibitors may minimize their side effects .
these pre - clinical efforts have provided a rationale for using mtor co - targeting strategies in hnscc patients .
mtor and cancer immunology cancers , including hnscc , are immunosuppressive diseases .
cancer cells normally avoid immune surveillance and anti - tumor immune response by recruiting myeloid - derived suppressor cells ( mdsc ) and suppressive regulatory t cells ( tregs ) [ 91 ] , while macrophages undergo polarization toward an immune suppressive ( m2 ) tumor - associated macrophage ( tam ) phenotype [ 92 - 94 ] .
in hnscc , patients often have low absolute lymphocyte counts ( alc ) , impaired natural killer ( nk ) cell activity , and poor antigen presentation function compared to healthy volunteers [ 6 ] .
to recognize cancer cells as foreign instead of self and effectively attack them by the immune system , three general categories , known as immuno - oncology ( io ) therapies , could be applied , including checkpoint inhibitors , immune stimulatory cytokines , and cancer vaccines [ 6 , 95 ] .
recently , revolutionary therapeutic strategies have been used to restore t cell - mediated anti - tumor immunity in hnscc by targeting immune checkpoint molecules , such a pd - l1 and pd - 1 .
these studies demonstrated immune modulation and durable remissions and led to the recent approval by the fda of anti - pd - 1 antibodies , nivolumab and pembrolizumab , for use in hnscc treatment [ 6 - 11 ] .
numerous trials in hnscc are being evaluated .
however , the overall response rate to these io therapies in hnscc is only ~ 20 % [ 6 - 11 ] .
there is a clear need to identify therapeutic options to enhance the response to these io agents in hnscc .
both precision therapies and io therapies are novel therapeutic modalities being under clinical evaluation for cancer treatment .
this provides numerous potential opportunities for synergistic treatment strategies .
specifically for mtor inhibition , the mtor pathway was early considered to be a target of immunosuppressive therapy , and rapamycin has been used in renal transplant patients who were also taking cyclosporine and corticosteroids [ 96 ] .
nonetheless , rapamycin - treated patients have similar numbers of myeloid dendritic cells ( dcs ) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pdcs ) , suggesting that at the dose used , rapamycin does not compromise the dc compartments in patients [ 97 ] .
moreover , in cancer patients , multiple trials using single - agent rapamycin ( or rapalogs ) have shown no evidence of increased incidence of immunosuppression [ 98 - 100 ] .
paradoxically , recent basic and clinical studies have associated rapamycin with increased immune responses and potentiation of the activity of io agents in cancer models [ 101 - 109 ] .
thus , it is possible that co - targeting mtor may potentially enhance rather than reduce the anti - tumor activity of io agents .
the generation of anti - tumor immune response usually requires multiple steps , including ( 1 ) tumor antigen ( peptide epitope ) capture , ( 2 ) effector t cell differentiation , and ( 3 ) evasion of negative regulation [ 91 ] .
firstly , mtor inhibitors , similar to many other cancer precision therapeutic options , may cause programmed cancer cell death [ 110 ] .
the apoptotic tumor cells killed in situ can expose multiple antigens .
similar to a variety of cancer vaccines , those antigens can be processed into major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) class i and class ii pathways , to activate cd8 + t cells and cd4 + t cells , respectively [ 91 ] .
secondly , mtor has double - edged sword effects during the progress of t cell differentiation .
while mtor activation programs their differentiation into functionally distinct lineages [ 111 ] , mtor inhibition drives t cell toward long - lived tumor specific memory t cells [ 91 ] .
thirdly , the checkpoint proteins ctla4 and programmed cell death protein 1 ( pd1 ) are among the major inhibitory molecules suppressing activated t cells [ 112 - 115 ] .
we reported in a hnscc mouse model that an increase in programmed death - ligand 1 ( pd - l1 ) expression can be elicited by pten gene deletion [ 116 ] , suggesting pi3k / mtor pathway activation contributes to pd - l1 / pd1 stimulation in hnscc .
a recent study showed that co - targeting mtor and pd - l1 enhances tumor control by increasing the ifngamma production capacity in peripheral and tumor - infiltrating cd8 t cells in a syngeneic oral cavity cancer model [ 109 ] .
meanwhile , tolerogenic cytokines secreted by regulatory t ( treg ) cells and mdscs also inhibit anti - tumor immune responses [ 117 , 118 ] .
the expression of inhibitory molecules , such as interleukin - 10 ( il - 10 ) and transforming growth factor - beta ( tgfbeta ) could be decreased by mtor inhibition [ 119 - 122 ] ( fig. 2 ). fig. 2 mtor inhibition may enhance the anti - tumor immune response .
a dcs capture tumor antigens and present them to t cells through mhc ( class i and class ii ) pathways .
mtor inhibition induces apoptotic cells , which may contribute as vaccination in situ .
b mtor inhibition drives t cells toward long - lived tumor specific memory t cells .
c the inhibitory molecule pdl1 from tumor cells can bind pd1 in t cells and weaken effector t cell 's function .
co - targeting mtor may reduce pd - l1 expression , restraining pd - l1 / pd1 mediated inhibition .
effector t cells refer to as cytotoxic t cells ( cd8 +) and helper t cells ( cd4 +) .
d immunosuppressive cytokines secreted by tregs and mdscs inhibit anti - tumor response .
mtor inhibition may prevent cytokine secretion by regulation of their translational control .
dcs dendritic cells , mhc major histocompatibility complex , tregs regulatory t cell , mdscs myeloid - derived suppressor cells therefore , although counterintuitive , emerging evidence supports that pi3k / mtor inhibition can be optimized to enhance , rather than suppress , the anti - tumor immune response by overcoming immune evasion in a context - dependent fashion .
thus co - targeting the mtor signaling circuitry based on the genetic stratification of pi3k / mtor network subtypes with io agents , may represent a novel precision immune therapeutic approach for hnscc .
conclusion in summary , the importance of mtor signaling circuitry in hnscc has been well documented , and targeting mtor as a precision therapy approach in hnscc has been widely investigated in experimental models , and recently tested in clinical trials .
newly developed genetic approaches could be applied to evaluate the status of mtor activation which may predict individuals' clinical response to this precision therapy .
this mechanism - based therapeutic approach may help select patient populations that may benefit the most from the concomitant administration of mtor inhibitors , and also provide improved therapeutic options , namely co - targeting strategies to circumvent innate and acquired resistance to mtor inhibitors .
furthermore , there is now a strong rationale for co - targeting mtor with io agents to enhance their anti - tumor activity .
overall , we can expect that the development of novel mtor co - targeting strategies may achieve durable responses and cancer remission , hence increasing the life expectancy and quality of life of hnscc patients .

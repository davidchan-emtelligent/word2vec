objective current levels of ambient air pollution are associated with morbidity and mortality in the general population .
to determine the influence of gaseous air pollutants on neonatal respiratory morbidity , we tested the association between daily respiratory hospitalizations and daily concentrations of ambient air pollution gases : ozone , carbon monoxide , sulfur dioxide , and nitrogen dioxide , in 11 large canadian cities .
study design daily time - series analyses were employed and results were adjusted for day of the week , temperature , barometric pressure , and relative humidity .
results the percent increases in hospitalization associated with an increase in air pollution equivalent to its interquartile range were 3.35 [ 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) , 1.73 - 4.77 ] for o3 , 2.85 ( 95 % ci , 1.68 - 4.02 ) for no2 , 1.66 ( 95 % ci , 0.63 - 2.69 ) for so2 , and 1.75 ( 95 % ci , 0.48 - 3.02 ) for co. the independent effect of all pollutants combined was 9.61 % ( 95 % ci , 4.52 - 14.7 %) .
conclusion our results suggest that neonates are experiencing adverse effects of air pollution at current levels in canada , and that accounts for a significant proportion of hospitalizations in this subgroup .
carbon monoxide hospital admission infants ozone sulfur dioxide current levels of ambient air pollution in the americas , europe , and australia have been associated with increased respiratory and cardiac morbidity and mortality in the general population ( bascom et al. 1996 ; dockery and pope 2002 ; morgan et al. 1998 ) .
the primary focus has usually been either adults or children of all ages combined , but research is needed to know whether the results are generalizable to more narrowly defined age groups which have special characteristics .
associations between ambient air pollution and pregnancy outcomes , including preterm birth , low birth weight , and intrauterine growth restriction ( iugr ) , have been studied in several countries ( ritz et al. 2002 ; wang et al. 1997 ) .
liu et al .
( 2003 ) found that maternal exposure to increased concentration of gaseous air pollutants , sulfur dioxide , nitrogen dioxide , and carbon monoxide during pregnancy were positively associated with preterm birth and iugr .
the number of sids ( sudden infant death syndrome ) deaths increased on days of high gaseous air pollution in canada ( dales et al. 2004 ) .
neonates , 0 - 28 days of age , have a unique spectrum of morbidity including clinical presentations such as " acute life - threatening events " and " respiratory distress syndrome. " to understand better the contribution of pollution to neonatal morbidity , we used time - series studies to test the hypothesis that gaseous air pollutants are associated with hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among neonates in 11 large canadian cities .
we compared hospitalization rates on higher and lower air pollution days for the same population .
as stated by peng et al .
( 2006 ) the results from multicity time - series studies are robust against alternative methodologies for confounding adjustment .
to bias the results , a variable would need to be associated with daily changes in air pollution and also be a risk factor for neonatal hospitalization for asthma , making confounding unlikely .
methods the study population the study population was all emergency admissions to hospital for respiratory disease in patients from birth to the age of 27 days between 1 january 1986 and 31 december 2000 in 11 of the largest canadian cities from the atlantic to pacific coasts : calgary , edmonton , halifax , london , hamilton , ottawa , saint john , toronto , vancouver , windsor , and winnipeg .
the hospitalization data were provided by the canadian institute for health information ( http :// secure.cihi.ca / cihiweb / splash.html ) , which collects information on all urgent and emergency admissions in canada ; the availability of this information is made possible by the fact that acute care general medical hospitals in canada are publicly funded .
there were a total of 9,542 hospital discharge records for cases in which the principal reason for hospitalization was a respiratory disorder described by the international classification of disease , 9th revision ( icd - 9 ; world health organization 1975 ) code : asphyxia ( 799.0 ) , respiratory failure ( 799.1 ) , dyspnea and respiratory abnormalities ( 786.0 ) , respiratory distress syndrome ( 769 ) , unspecified birth asphyxia in live - born infant ( 768.9 ) , other respiratory problems after birth ( 770.8 ) , and pneumonia ( 486 ) .
meteorologic and air pollution data for each city , the following daily data were provided by environment canada and the national air pollution monitoring system ( http :// www.mb.ec.gc.ca / index.en.html ) : mean , maximum , and minimum temperature ; mean relative humidity ; maximum 24 - hr change in barometric pressure ; and daily measurements of so2 , no2 , co , and ozone throughout the 15 - year study period .
most cities had several monitoring stations .
averaging data over all monitors within each city created daily summary pollution exposure measures .
daily average values for no2 , so2 , co , and o3 were used in our analysis .
twenty - four - hour averaged particulate matter < 10 mum in median aerodynamic diameter ( pm10 ) and sulfates ( so4 ) were measured every sixth day .
statistical methods the air pollution , neonatal respiratory hospital admission , and weather variables , measured over the course of the study , were each expressed as a time series .
we correlated daily variations in the number of neonatal hospitalization with daily variations in ambient concentrations of air pollutants by using a random - effects regression model for count data ( burnett et al. 1997 ) .
because the response of interest is counts , the residual variation was assumed to be proportional to the expected response , accommodating overdispersion or underdispersion relative to poisson variation .
neonatal respiratory admissions , air pollution , and weather can vary seasonally and may have other unexplained time trends that can cause confounding ( peng et al. 2006 ) .
we adjusted for temporal trends in neonatal respiratory admissions , including day of the week , and effects of weather on neonatal respiratory admissions using piecewise constant functions that varied by 30 , 90 , 180 , 270 , and 365 days throughout the study period .
this approach , used to address the low counts of neonatal respiratory admissions in some cities , has been previously used by dales et al .
( 2004 ) to study sids .
we then selected a model with time period that either minimized the akaike information criterion ( aic ; akaike 1973 ) , or maximized the evidence that the model residuals did not display any type of structure , including serial correlation , using bartlett 's test .
we examined serial correlation structure in the residuals after fitting models with functions that were constant over time intervals .
the above steps were implemented separately for each city .
using s - plus ( version 6.2 ; insightful , seattle , wa , usa ) , we tested the association between weather and respiratory admissions with a nonlinear model and natural spline functions of weather variables to remove unwanted temporal trends .
these variables included daily minimum and maximum temperature , mean daily temperature , 24 - hr change in barometric pressure , and mean relative humidity .
three lags ( 0 , 1 , and 2 days ) were examined for each of these weather variables .
the model containing the latter three weather variables minimized the aic and was selected as the predictive weather model for daily neonatal respiratory hospitalization .
finally , air pollutants , with lags , were added to the model containing weather variables .
we tested time lags between daily pollution concentration and daily neonatal respiratory admissions of 0 - 5 days .
results for the lag associated with the largest t ratio - - the ratio of percentage increase in admissions to the standard error .
once the final model was selected , the percent change in daily hospitalization and the accompanying standard errors in relative risks were generated for each city .
the results for each city were pooled .
we calculated the estimates of the pooled effect size mean +/ - se by using a fixed - or random - effects model .
this weights the individual city effects by the inverse of the between and within - city variance .
we used a random - effects model whenever the between - city variance was > 0 , even if the heterogeneity among effect - size estimates for individual cities was not statistically significant .
we assessed the presence of statistical heterogeneity in effect size between cities using the chi - square statistic .
pooled estimates were expressed as the percentage increase in neonatal hospitalization associated with an increase in the concentration of air pollutants equivalent to the interquartile range among all cities ( burnett et al. 1995 ) .
as stated by peng et al .
( 2006 ) , the results from multicity time - series studies are robust against alternative methodologies for confounding adjustment .
to bias the results , a variable would need to be associated with daily changes in air pollution and also be a risk factor for neonatal hospitalization for asthma , making confounding unlikely .
results the frequency of occurrence of the icd codes used in this study , presented in table 1 , was relatively low over the 15 - year period of observation , with respiratory distress syndrome being the most common of the respiratory diagnoses studied and asphyxia the least common .
details on population size and the mean of air pollution and meteorologic data are presented in table 2 .
o3 concentrations ranged from 13.3 ppb in vancouver to 23.1 ppb in saint john , with a population - weighted average of 17.0 .
no2 concentrations ranged from 9.2 ppb in saint john to 25.6 ppb in calgary , with a pooled average of 21.8 .
so2 concentrations ranged from 1.2 ppb in winnipeg to 10.1 in halifax , with a pooled average of 4.3 ppb , and co concentrations ranged from 0.4 in london and to 1.2 ppm in toronto , with a pooled average of 1.0 ppm .
pairwise pearson correlations between pollutants were quite variable between cities .
correlations between no2 , so2 , and co were all positive although they varied from 0.13 to 0.76 ( table 3 ) .
correlations between pm10 and o3 and other pollutants varied from negative to positive , - 0.55 to 0.71 .
we tested the association between air pollutants and hospitalization using lags of 0 - 5 days .
averaged over cities , the mean lags providing the greatest association were 2 days for o3 , 2 days for so2 , 1 day for no2 , and 1.8 days for co. based on minimization of the aic , temperature was included in the models for edmonton and halifax .
relative humidity on the same day was included in all models except the two aforementioned cities .
in addition , relative humidity lagged 1 day was included for calgary , vancouver , windsor , and winnipeg .
change in barometric pressure over the day did not enter the models .
all individual pollutants were associated with increased respiratory hospitalizations , with no2 having the strongest effect whether or not adjusted for the other gases ( table 4 ) .
the independent effects of each gas remained stable whether or not adjusted for the effects of the other gases .
the percent increases in hospitalization associated with an increase in air pollution equivalent to its interquartile range were 3.35 [ 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) , 1.73 - 4.77 ] for o3 , 2.85 ( 95 % ci , 1.68 - 4.02 ) for no2 , 1.66 ( 95 % ci , 0.63 - 2.69 ) for so2 , and 1.75 ( 95 % ci , 0.48 - 3.02 ) for co. the total effect of all gaseous pollutants was a 9.61 % ( 4.52 - 14.7 %) increase in respiratory admissions , with an increase in pollutants equivalent to their interquartile range .
to determine the degree to which pm10 may have confounded the findings , we restriced the analyses to every sixth day , when these pollutants were measured during the years 1986 - 2000 .
the gases remained statistically significant , with the largest difference in effect - size estimate found for the association between hospitalizations and so2 : 2.06 % ( 95 % ci , 1.04 - 3.08 %) for the daily model versus 1.41 % ( 95 % ci , 0.35 - 2.47 %) for the model restricted to every sixth day .
discussion although admissions for respiratory disease are uncommon in neonates compared with adults , we were able to detect a significant association with gaseous air pollutants .
if the association was causal , air pollution at ambient levels seen in canada may account for 16 % of admissions .
our results are consistent with previously observed associations in older children and adults between air pollution and respiratory symptoms , lung function , hospitalization , and mortality .
the two strongest effects observed were with no2 and o3 .
a large meta - analysis of studies from around the world found consistent associations between mortality and no2 even when adjusted for other pollutants ( stieb et al. 2002 ) .
associations have also been found linking all air pollutant gases with lung function impairment in both children and adults ( gauderman et al. 2000 ; peters et al. 1999a , 1999b ) .
in other observational studies , acute changes in no2 have been associated with sudden infant death syndrome in canada , infant mortality in mexico city , and asthma symptoms in children ( dales et al. 2004 ; delfino et al. 2002 ; loomis et al. 1999 ) .
exposures during pregnancy have been associated with low birth weight in seoul , korea , and iugr in vancouver , canada ( ha et al. 2001 ; liu et al. 2003 ) .
controlled human exposures to no2 have demonstrated small increases in bronchial reactivity ( folinsbee 1992 ) and an enhanced effect of allergen - induced bronchoconstriction ( strand et al. 1998 ) .
in mice , no2 exposure increases morbidity from mycoplasma pulmonis ( parker et al .
1989 ) and mortality from klebsiella pneumoniae ( ehrlich 1966 ; gauderman et al. 2000 ; peters et al. 1999a , 1999b ; stieb et al. 2002 ) .
the effects of no2 in large observational studies have been found at lower concentrations than those investigated in laboratory studies .
several possible reasons exist .
the much larger sample size in population studies allows the ability to detect smaller effects .
the laboratory studies control for other confounding variables better than can be done in an observational study .
perhaps no2 is simply a marker of other toxicants in a complex mixture of pollutants that share a common source .
nevertheless , our findings of increased neonatal morbidity from air pollution gases are consistent with other studies of early life .
particulates such as no2 are also markers of exposure to vehicular traffic .
although our study focused on air pollution gases , we had an opportunity to assess the effects of pm10 measured every sixth day .
a 10 - mug / m3 increase in pm10 has been associated with a 0.51 - 1 % increase in all - cause mortality ( burnett et al .
1995 ) and a 1 - 4 % increase in hospital visits ( pope et al. 1995 ) .
our results were of similar magnitude , although in a different age group .
we found a 1.5 - 2.1 % increase in hospitalization among neonates associated with a 15 - mug / m3 increase in pm10 , of similar magnitude to studies of other age groups .
a more recent cohort study of cystic fibrosis patients found that living in an area with a 10 - mug / m3 higher concentration of pm10 was associated with an 8 % ( 95 % ci , 2 - 15 %) increase in the odds of at least two disease exacerbations requiring hospitalization or home intravenous antibiotics ( goss et al. 2004 ) .
for a 100 - ppb increase in the daily one - hour maximum of o3 , thurston and ito ( 1999 ) reported that the relative risk of respiratory hospitalization for all ages was 1.18 ( 95 % ci , 1.1 - 1.3 ) , and the 1 - sec forced expiratory volume in children attending summer camps decreased by 50.0 ( se = 7.0 ) ml. most of the literature on air pollution and health includes both adults and children together .
the many reports of air pollution and children 's health either excluded neonates ( farrow et al. 1997 ; gouveia and fletcher 2000 ; ha et al. 2003 ; woodruff et al .
1997 ) or did not study them separately from all children ( burnett et al. 2001 , 1994 ; loomis et al. 1999 ) .
yet neonates have a unique set of respiratory diagnoses such as acute life - threatening events and respiratory distress syndrome , whereas older children commonly suffer from asthma , croup , and bronchiolitis , and adults are admitted with asthma , pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
we could not find previous studies of air pollution and hospitalization for neonatal respiratory disease , but the findings are consistent with the few published studies focusing on neonatal mortality .
lin et al .
( 2004 ) reported that a 23.3 - mug / m3 increase in pm10 was associated with a 4 % ( 95 % ci , 2 - 6 %) increase in total daily mortality in neonates in sao paulo , brazil , whereas a 9.2 - mug / m3 increase in so2 was associated with a 6 % ( 95 % ci , 4 - 8 %) increase in mortality .
the combined effects of the two pollutants was 6.3 % ( 95 % ci , 6.1 - 6.5 %) , indicating that the so2 alone could explain most of the effect .
no significant effects , and weather variables .
effect of no2 , co , or o3 could be detected , although an average of 6.1 deaths occurred daily over the 1,096 days of study .
bobak and leon ( 1999 ) performed a case - control study of live births in the czech republic between 1989 and 1991 .
each infant death was matched with 20 living infants who were of the same sex and born on the same day .
no significant effect of total suspended particulates ( tsp ) , so2 , or no2 was found in the 1,684 cases of death in the neonatal period , adjusted for unspecified socioeconomic factors , gestational age , and birth weight .
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke was not known .
tsp and so2 were significantly associated with respiratory ( n = 111 cases ) but not all - cause deaths ( n = 810 ) in the postneonatal period , with rate ratios of 1.95 ( 95 % ci , 1.1 - 3.5 ) and 1.74 ( 95 % ci , 1.0 - 3.0 ) respectively for an increase of 50 mug / m3 .
lipfert et al .
( 2000 ) matched the u.s. environmental protective agency 's air pollution database with the national linked birth / infant death data set of the national center for health statistics for 1990 .
annual averages of air pollution were estimated for each infant based on the county of birth .
so4 and pm10 were positively associated with total neonatal deaths , and pm10 was associated with neonatal respiratory deaths , adjusted for mother 's smoking , marital status , race , infant 's month of birth , and average heating degree days .
there were no associations with co , and associations with so2 and no2 were not reported .
dales et al .
( 2004 ) reported that between 1984 and 1999 , daily increases in so2 and no2 equivalent to their interquartile ranges were associated with an 18 % increase in daily sids .
the study was based on infant deaths occurring in the same canadian cities on which the present study is based .
even earlier in life , there is emerging evidence suggesting adverse effects of air pollution .
in british columbia , lower birth weight has been found in areas of higher air pollution adjusting for maternal age , parity , infant sex , gestational age or birth weight , and month of birth ( liu et al. 2003 ) .
however , socioeconomic status , a potential confounder , was not accounted for in the study .
in conclusion , current canadian levels of ambient air pollution are associated with a significant proportion of hospitalizations for respiratory disorders in neonates .
this is consistent with findings of adverse effects in both older and younger age groups .

vitamin d deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of asthma exacerbations. objective .
this study aimed to compare vitamin d status during the period of severe asthma exacerbations and investigate if vitamin d supplementation improves asthma control. methods .
a total of 47 asthmatic patients and 40 healthy subjects participated in this study .
serum 25 - hydroxyvitamin d ( 25 ( oh ) d ) , asthma control test ( act ) score , and % predicted peak expiratory flow rate were evaluated in the period with and without severe asthma exacerbations .
after that , we provided vitamin d2 supplements to the patients with low vitamin d levels for 3 months. results .
at the period of asthma exacerbation , the prevalence of vitamin d deficiency and insufficiency was 38.29 % and 34.04 % .
there was no significant difference in the levels of serum 25 ( oh ) d with and without asthma exacerbations but the levels were significantly higher in the healthy group .
serum 25 ( oh ) d levels significantly correlated with act score .
moreover , vitamin d2 supplementation improved asthma control in uncontrolled asthma group. conclusions .
hypovitaminosis d was common in asthmatic patients but was not the leading cause of asthma exacerbations .
serum 25 ( oh ) d levels correlated with the ability to control asthma .
improving vitamin d status might be a benefit in uncontrolled asthmatic patients .
phramongkutklao hospital 1 .
introduction asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the lower airway .
the prevalence of asthma is approximately 300 million cases in the world and in thailand it affects approximately 6.9 % of adults [ 1 ] .
asthma exacerbation is defined as asthma attack .
the airway becomes swollen and inflamed and the muscles around the airway contract causing the bronchial tubes to narrow .
symptoms and exacerbations of asthma include breathlessness , coughing , wheezing , and chest tightness [ 2 ] .
severe exacerbations of asthma are potentially life - threatening and require prompt care , close observation for deterioration , and frequent treatments [ 2 ] .
the public health burden of acute exacerbation asthma is an especially important and costly problem .
the major cause of exacerbation in children and adults is common respiratory virus [ 3 ] .
at least one exacerbation is an important risk factor for recurrent asthma exacerbation [ 4 ] .
moreover , asthma exacerbation is associated with accelerated loss of lung function [ 5 ] .
vitamin d is a fat - soluble vitamin that is important to the body by balancing calcium and bone , innate and adaptive immunity , and homeostasis of many organs [ 6 ] .
vitamin d from food or dermal synthesis is inactive and requires enzymatic conversion to become active .
hypovitaminosis d is typically diagnosed by measuring the concentration in blood of 25 - hydroxyvitamin d ( 25 ( oh ) d ) , the primary circulating form of vitamin d , and then 1,25 - dihydroxyvitamin d , the active form of vitamin d , by the enzyme 25 - hydroxylase in the liver and kidney [ 7 ] .
vitamin d insufficiency is defined as a 25 ( oh ) d level less than 30 ng / ml. furthermore , vitamin d deficiency is defined as 25 ( oh ) d levels below 20 ng / ml , with a resultant consistent elevation of pth and reduction in intestinal calcium absorption .
people living in tropical countries are exposed to the sun and usually have high levels of vitamin d. however , studies in tropical countries have found the prevalence of vitamin d deficiency to be about 30 to 50 % [ 8 , 9 ] .
in thailand , the prevalence of hypovitaminosis d is nearly more than 50 % [ 10 ] .
low serum levels of vitamin d have been linked to increased risk of asthma exacerbation in children and adults .
hypovitaminosis d is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease , autoimmune disease , cancer , and allergy disease [ 11 , 12 ] .
vitamin d plays a significant role in the immune system of asthma .
it directly affects the adaptive immune system through its effects on th1 , th2 , and regulatory t cells [ 13 ] .
it promotes peripheral tolerance by inhibiting inflammation and the induction or maintenance of regulatory t cell populations , both il - 10 + and foxp3 + [ 13 ] .
serum 25 ( oh ) d levels correlated with cd4 + foxp3 + treg cells numbers in moderate / severe asthma [ 14 ] .
this cross - sectional study demonstrated that the frequency of circulating cd4 + foxp3 + treg cells is significantly lower in steroid resistance than in steroid sensitive asthmatic patients [ 14 ] .
also , it directs the induction of innate antimicrobial mechanisms to efficiently resolve infection , especially respiratory viral infections [ 15 ] .
hypovitaminosis d is frequent in asthmatic patients [ 16 , 17 ] .
notably , vitamin d insufficiency has been associated with severe asthma exacerbations in children and decreased serum vitamin d levels are associated with increased corticosteroid use [ 18 , 19 ] .
vitamin d deficiency has been associated with the asthma epidemic , obesity in african americans , westernization of countries with higher - risk populations for asthma , increased airway hyperresponsiveness , lower pulmonary functions , worse asthma control , and possibly steroid resistance [ 20 ] .
people given vitamin d supplement had fewer asthma attacks needing treatment with oral steroids [ 21 ] .
the average number of asthma attacks per person per year decreased from 0.44 to 0.28 with vitamin d [ 21 ] .
vitamin d reduced the risk of attending hospital with acute exacerbation asthma from 6 per 100 to around 3 per 100 [ 21 ] .
however , in tropical countries like thailand , data on the association between serum vitamin d level and asthma exacerbation in adult patients is limited .
this study compared serum vitamin d levels during the period of asthma exacerbation and during the periods in stable condition .
also , patients with low vitamin d levels received vitamin d2 supplement for three months and then asthma control and lung function were monitored .
2. methods this study employed a cross - sectional design .
adults with asthma exacerbation were recruited from the allergy clinic and emergency department , phramongkutklao hospital , bangkok , thailand .
bangkok 's latitude and longitude are 13degrees45 ' north and 100degrees31 ' east .
severe asthma exacerbation is defined by acute episodes of progressively worsening shortness of breath , coughing , wheezing , and chest tightness .
a patient has dyspnea at rest that interferes with conversation [ 22 ] .
a patient with asthma exacerbation requires treatment with nebulized short - acting beta - 2 agonist and oral corticosteroid added to daily asthma medications .
act is a five - item patient self - assessment tool for asthma control [ 23 ] .
we enrolled patients ( 18 years of age or older ) with asthma exacerbation and without upper respiratory tract infection .
serum 25 ( oh ) d , asthma control test ( act ) score , and peak expiratory flow rate ( pefr ) were measured during the period of severe exacerbation .
at least two weeks after the exacerbation , the patients during the period in stable condition ( control asthma without inhaled short - acting beta - 2 agonist ) visited the allergy clinic again to check serum vitamin d levels , act score , and pefr .
a clinical history of asthma was confirmed by bronchodilator responsiveness ( as defined by an improvement in the fev1 of > 200 ml and 12 % after administration of four puffs ( 360 mg ) of salbutamol by metered dose inhaler ) .
participants with significant medical illness other than asthma , those with a history of respiratory tract infection in the past seven days , those with nonadherence to use control medication , and those taking vitamin d supplement were excluded .
the control subjects were adults without a history of chronic illness .
during the period of control asthma , if the serum level of 25 ( oh ) d was less than 30 ng / ml , the subjects were treated with the ergocalciferol ( vitamin d2 ) supplement at a dose of 20,000 iu every alternate day .
after 3 months , subjects were evaluated again for serum 25 ( oh ) d , act score , and pefr .
during 3 months of vitamin d2 supplement , subjects received the same control asthma medication , that is , inhaled long - acting beta - 2 agonist plus corticosteroid and leukotriene receptor antagonists .
there was no randomization in vitamin d supplement study .
the study was approved by the institutional review board , royal thai army medical department .
all patients provided written informed consent before taking part in the study .
pefr was measured during forceful exhalation , starting from full lung inflation with the patient standing .
percent predicted pefr was calculated from standard pefr value in thailand [ 24 ] .
serum total 25 ( oh ) d was quantified by high - performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry and categorized in 25 ( oh ) d sufficiency >= 30 ng / ml , insufficiency < 30 ng / ml , and deficiency < 20 ng / ml. therefore , the serum level of 25 ( oh ) d was considered the best biomarker of vitamin d metabolic status and reflected contributions from all sources of vitamin d. patients were divided into three groups : complete asthma control ( act = 25 ) , partial asthma control ( act 21 - 24 ) , and poor asthma control ( act < 20 ) .
data were analyzed using graphpad prism 6 ( graphpad software , la jolla , ca , usa ) .
data description was primarily based on means and standard deviations ( sd ) for continuous endpoints and on frequencies for categorical parameters .
nonparametric comparisons between asthma exacerbation and asthma control were made using wilcoxon matched - pairs signed test .
the mann - whitney test is a method to compare two population means that come from the same population .
we assessed the association between serum vitamin d levels and act that was evaluated by spearman 's correlation .
a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
2.1 .
study population a total of 47 adult patients with exacerbation asthma were enrolled and baseline characteristics are shown in table 1 .
the mean age of patients was 63.48 +/ - 11.79 years .
the majority of patients were aged more than 70 years ( 34.04 %) .
a total of 13 of 16 ( 81.25 %) patients with age > 70 years had abnormal vitamin d levels. of these , three patients had a vitamin d level < 10 ng / ml. subjects were predominantly female ( 74.47 %) .
also , females had more abnormal d levels ( 82.85 %) than males ( 41.66 %) .
thirty - four subjects ( 72.34 %) with asthma exacerbation had vitamin d levels below normal .
therefore , patients that had uncontrolled asthma ( act < 20 ) and vitamin d deficiency constituted a third of the total .
in the healthy control group , females comprised 65 % and the mean age was 63 +/ - 17.29 years .
the prevalence of vitamin d insufficiency in the healthy control group was 47.5 % without vitamin d deficiency .
2.2 .
serum vitamin d levels , age , sex , pefr , and act score mean 25 ( oh ) d concentrations were 23.84 +/ - 8.89 ng / ml in the period of asthma exacerbation and increased to 24.34 +/ - 9.8 ng / ml in terms of no exacerbation but differed insignificantly , p = 0.6 ( figure 1 ( a )) .
in the healthy control group , mean 25 ( oh ) d concentration was 31.75 +/ - 7.28 ng / ml. to compare between asthmatic patients and healthy controls , the mean 25 ( oh ) d levels in the period with asthma exacerbation and without exacerbation in the asthma group were significantly lower than those in the healthy control group , p = 0.0002 and p < 0.0001 , respectively ( figure 1 ( a )) .
analyzing mean 25 ( oh ) d concentrations between females , 22.55 +/ - 7.74 ng / ml , and males , 27.59 +/ - 11.16 ng / ml , revealed no significant difference ( figure 1 ( b )) .
however , females had a higher risk of developing vitamin d deficiency ( or = 5.83 ; 95 % ci = 1.12 - 30.4 , p = 0.03 ) and vitamin insufficiency than males ( or = 8.17 ; 95 % ci = 1.30 - 51.4 , p = 0.02 ) .
age affected vitamin d level in this study .
severe asthma exacerbation mean 25 ( oh ) d concentrations , found between ages <= 50 , 51 - 59 , 60 - 69 , and >= 70 years , were 33.57 +/ - 5.77 ng / ml , 23.67 +/ - 6.68 ng / ml , 23.2 +/ - 7.4 , and 20.24 +/ - 9.82 , respectively .
age <= 50 years presented more significantly higher vitamin d levels than other age groups ( figure 1 ( c )) .
also , in the period without exacerbation , age <= 50 had higher vitamin d levels than >= 70 years ( figure 1 ( c )) .
no significant difference was observed between partly controlled ( act < 20 ) and uncontrolled asthma ( act 21 - 24 ) in mean 25 ( oh ) d concentration with asthma exacerbation and without asthma exacerbation ( figure 1 ( d )) .
for asthmatic patients with % predicted pefr > 80 % , mean 25 ( oh ) d concentration 26.48 +/ - 6.17 ng / ml was significantly higher than in asthmatic patients with % predicted pefr < 60 % ( 18.81 +/ - 7.04 ng / ml , p = 0.02 ) ( figure 1 ( e )) .
in patients with % predicted pefr > 80 % , mean 25 ( oh ) d concentrations between with asthma exacerbation 26.48 +/ - 6.17 and without asthma exacerbation 24.34 +/ - 6.36 ng / ml significantly differed , p = 0.009 ( figure 1 ( e )) .
we also observed vitamin d status with controlled asthma and lung function .
representative vitamin d status and asthma control test score are shown in figure 2 ( a ) .
interestingly , vitamin d status affected the ability to control asthma .
patients with sufficient vitamin d levels had significantly higher act scores than patients with vitamin d deficiency during asthma exacerbation ( 20.23 +/ - 1.83 versus 15.11 +/ - 5.73 , p = 0.04 ) ( figure 2 ( a )) .
moreover , during the period without asthma exacerbation , patients with vitamin d insufficiency and deficiency significantly increased asthma control test score to compare in the period with exacerbation asthma ( figure 2 ( a )) .
vitamin d status presented no difference in % predicted pefr ( figure 2 ( b )) .
we next tested whether serum vitamin d levels were associated with age , controlled asthma , and % predicted pefr .
increasing age inversely correlated with serum vitamin d level ( p = 0.003 , r = - 0.30 ) ( figure 3 ( a )) .
then serum 25 ( oh ) d levels significantly positively correlated with controlled asthma ( p = 0.006 ; r = 0.30 ) ( figure 3 ( b )) .
however , an association between serum vitamin d levels and lung function was not observed ( figure 3 ( c )) .
2.3 .
supplement vitamin d in asthmatic patients with low vitamin d levels twenty - four of 34 subjects ( 70.58 %) who had serum 25 ( oh ) d level less than 30 ng / ml participated in receiving vitamin d2 supplement ( 12 subjects denied treatment with vitamin d supplement ) .
we prescribed a vitamin d2 supplement , ergocalciferol ( vitamin d2 ) , 20,000 iu every alternate day for 3 months to 24 asthmatic patients ( 7 , partly controlled , and 17 , uncontrolled asthma ) .
after 3 months of vitamin d administration , mean 25 ( oh ) d concentration was significantly higher than baseline among asthmatic patients ( 20.41 +/ - 5.13 versus 36.41 +/ - 5.22 ng / ml , p < 0.0001 ) ( figure 4 ( a )) .
to compare with baseline , vitamin d supplement improved asthma control in uncontrolled asthmatic patients .
in the uncontrolled asthma group , mean act score at baseline , 16.12 +/ - 1.03 , significantly increased after receiving vitamin d supplement for 3 months ( 20.37 +/ - 3.55 , p = 0.0004 ) ( figure 4 ( b )) .
the lung function in the partly controlled and uncontrolled asthma group showed slightly increased % predicted pefr after 3 months of vitamin d supplement but without significant difference ( figure 4 ( c )) .
next , we observed % change of act score and percent predicted pefr between partly controlled and uncontrolled asthma group .
uncontrolled asthma group had significantly improved act score more than partly controlled asthma group ( figure 4 ( d )) .
no significant difference with % change of percent predicted pefr between both groups was observed ( figure 4 ( e )) .
furthermore , no side effect of vitamin d supplement was reported from this study .
3. discussion this cross - sectional study examined vitamin d levels in adult asthmatic patients with differing periods of severe asthma exacerbation and without exacerbation .
the study could not conclude that decreased vitamin d level was the leading cause of severe asthma exacerbation among asthmatic thai adults .
however , many studies have suggested vitamin d deficiency was linked to increased risk of asthma exacerbation .
vitamin d insufficiency among north american and puerto rican children was associated with severe asthma exacerbations [ 25 , 26 ] .
moreover , adults presenting vitamin d deficiency were reported in to be linked to the risk of severe asthma exacerbations [ 27 ] .
furthermore , a large cohort from israel showed asthmatic patients with vitamin d deficiency had a 25 % higher chance of having an exacerbation than patients within normal range [ 28 ] .
however , many studies examined serum vitamin d level only one time and did not compare with the period without exacerbation in the same patient .
we showed vitamin d insufficiency and deficiency were more highly prevalent among asthmatic patients than among healthy people .
the prevalence of low vitamin d status was 45 % among healthy thai people [ 29 ] .
similarly , the study in asthmatic thai children showed the prevalence of decreased vitamin d status was 64 % [ 30 ] .
thailand , a southeast asian country , is located close to the equator and has a tropical rainforest climate with high sun exposure , one source of vitamin d among humans .
one possible explanation is that vitamin d metabolism is influenced by various factors including skin pigmentation , sunscreen use , clothing , drugs , smoking , age , obesity , and several chronic illnesses .
dietary intake and supplements are a secondary source of vitamin d. few natural vitamin d rich food sources are available in thailand and foods are not fortified with vitamin d [ 31 ] .
avoiding sun exposure and low intake of vitamin d may play significant roles in vitamin d insufficiency among people .
an inverse relationship was found between concentration of 25 ( oh ) d and age .
the frequency of vitamin d insufficiency was more common in females and elderly patients .
being old and female might influence vitamin d levels in asthmatic patients .
the study by chailurkit et al. among 2,641 thai adult subjects found the prevalence of vitamin d insufficiency was dependent on geographic region and associated with females , younger age , and living in an urban area [ 32 ] .
a positive relationship was observed between concentrations of 25 ( oh ) d and asthma control test score .
the findings of the present study confirmed report that patients with various degrees of vitamin d status were associated with asthma severity , monitored among children and adults [ 27 , 33 ] .
lower vitamin d levels were associated with worse asthma control .
asthma has been treated by vitamin d supplement in at least three adult random controlled trials ( rct ) .
arshi et al. conducted an rct enrolling 130 patients with moderate persistent asthma and found vitamin d supplementation to be associated with asthma controllers that could significantly improve fev1 in mild to moderate persistent asthma after 24 weeks [ 34 ] .
in addition , yadav and mittal reported monthly doses of 60,000 iu vitamin d3 significantly reduced the number of exacerbations as compared with placebo and pefr significantly increased in the treatment group [ 35 ] .
moreover , the study by de groot et al. conducted an rct involving 44 patients with nonatopic asthma and found vitamin d supplementation reduced eosinophilic airway inflammation among patients with nonatopic asthma with severe eosinophilic airway inflammation [ 36 ] .
however , castro et al. studied rct involving 408 adult asthmatic patients and concluded vitamin d3 did not reduce the rate of exacerbation among adults with persistent asthma and vitamin d insufficiency [ 37 ] .
in addition , martineau et al. conducted an rct comprising 250 adults with asthma in london and reported bolus - dose vitamin d3 supplementation did not influence time to exacerbation in a population of adults with asthma [ 38 ] .
the more recent rct results suggest likely interactions of the vitamin d acute respiratory tract infection association by baseline vitamin d status ( i.e. , vitamin d deficient individuals receive more benefit than those with normal concentrations ) and possibly greater advantage for subgroups that are at higher risk of acute respiratory tract infection , such as young children , older adults , or individuals with immune defects [ 39 ] .
providing vitamin d supplements to improve asthma symptoms and treatment is controversial .
the limitation of the study is no randomized control trial and no control group in vitamin d supplement study that it is difficult to conclude the benefit of vitamin d supplement in uncontrolled asthmatic patients .
it might be a placebo effect .
in addition , the subjects in this study are of low number because asthma exacerbation with upper respiratory tract infection is common in thailand ; this study excluded the cause of asthma exacerbation with upper respiratory tract infection .
we used vitamin d2 supplementation because the cost of the treatment is less than vitamin d3 supplementation .
however , vitamin d2 supplementation is effective in increasing serum 25 ( oh ) d level and not toxic when provided in large amounts .
further study will be planned to do randomized control trial and multicenter study to prove the benefit of vitamin d supplement in asthmatic patients .
4. conclusion hypovitaminosis d was common in patients with asthma exacerbation , but the low vitamin d level did not cause asthma exacerbation .
vitamin d insufficiency and deficiency were usually found in females and the elderly .
lower vitamin d level increased the difficulty in controlling asthma .
vitamin d supplements provided to uncontrolled asthmatic patients help to control asthma symptoms .
the study showed the benefits of examining serum 25 ( oh ) d and providing vitamin d supplements to uncontrolled asthmatic patients .

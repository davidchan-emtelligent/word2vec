berries contain significant amounts of phytochemicals , including polyphenols , which are reported to reduce cancer risk , coronary heart disease and other degenerative diseases .
these effects are mainly attributed to the antioxidant capacity of polyphenols found in berries .
strawberry tree ( arbutus unedo ) berries are used in folk medicine but seldom eaten as fresh fruits .
their phenolic profile and antioxidant capacity reveal a high potential , but they are not well characterized as a " health promoting food " .
the aim of this study was to assess the antioxidant properties of the edible strawberry tree fruit in vitro and in a neurodegeneration cell model .
raspberry ( rubus idaeus ) , a well documented health - promoting fruit , was used as a control for comparison purposes. a. unedo yielded a similar content in polyphenols and a slightly lower value of total antioxidant capacity in comparison to r. idaeus .
although the chemically - measured antioxidant activity was similar between both fruits , r. idaeus increased neuroblastoma survival in a neurodegeneration cell model by 36.6 % whereas a. unedo extracts caused no effect on neuroblastoma viability .
these results clearly demonstrate that a promising level of chemically - determined antioxidant activity of a plant extract is not necessarily correlated with biological significance , as assessed by the effect of a. unedo fruit in a neurodegeneration cell model .
polyphenols flavonoids antioxidants neuroprotection strawberry tree 1 .
introduction aerobic cellular metabolism continuously produces reactive oxygen species ( ros ) with concomitant potential for mutagenic and oncogenic effects .
the imbalance between ros and endogenous plus exogenous antioxidants induces oxidative stress , characteristic of some diseases , however diet provides natural antioxidants present in many fruits and vegetables that may participate in disease prevention .
there is epidemiological evidence that insufficient intake of fruits and vegetables may predispose the human body to a range of chronic health disorders , including cancer and cardiovascular disease [ 1 ] .
fruits are a rich source of antioxidants , especially polyphenols [ 2 ] , which may protect against damage caused by ros .
intake of fruits like berries seems to have a range of beneficial effects , from inhibition of cancer to alleviation of neurodegeneration [ 3 ] .
neurodegenerative diseases involve a complex set of oxidative reactions leading to neuronal cell death .
central nervous system cells are able to combat oxidative stress using some limited resources : vitamins , bioactive molecules , lipoic acid , antioxidant enzymes and redox sensitive protein transcriptional factors .
however , this defense system can be activated / modulated by nutritional antioxidants such as polyphenols .
flavonoids have been reported to have substantial neuroprotective activity [ 4,5,6,7 ] .
these effects have been attributed to their general free radical trapping capacity , or antioxidant activity per se , on neurons , but they also intervene in multiple biological processes , such as iron chelation , activation of survival genes , cell signaling pathways and regulation of mitochondrial function [ 1,2 ] .
strawberry tree ( arbutus unedo l. ; ericaceae family ) is an evergreen shrub , a native mediterranean species that is also cultivated in other regions of eastern europe [ 8 ] .
its fruits are spherical , about 2 cm in diameter , dark red , and tasty only when fully ripe in autumn. a. unedo berries are rarely eaten as fresh fruits , but have some importance in local agricultural communities where they are used for the production of alcoholic beverages , jams , jellies and marmalades [ 9,10 ] .
the fruits are also used in folk medicine as antiseptics , diuretics and laxatives , while the leaves have long been employed as an astringent , diuretic , urinary anti - septic agent and , more recently , in the therapy of hypertension and diabetes [ 11 ] .
together with its traditional applications , the wide range of antioxidants in strawberry tree fruit , such as phenolic compounds ( e.g. anthocyanins , gallic acid derivatives and tannins ) , vitamin c , vitamin e and carotenoids [ 8,9,10,12,13 ] , suggest a potentially high value as a " health promoting food " .
however , the biological significance of these in vitro - detected antioxidant properties remains to be determined .
it is therefore of considerable interest to validate the bioactivities of a. unedo fruits in cell / organism - based assays to assess their potential therapeutic effect against a wide range of human diseases .
in this work , the antioxidant properties of the edible fruit from a. unedo were tested .
raspberry ( rubus idaeus ) was used as a control for comparison purposes , since it is a well documented antioxidant fruit with recognized biologically significance effects [ 14,15,16 ] .
their total polyphenol and anthocyanin contents were measured and their antioxidant potential was assessed by measuring the antioxidant capacity for one of the most relevant free radicals for humans , the peroxyl radical .
their phenolic composition was also checked by lc - ms. the biological activity of a. unedo fruit phytochemicals ( at known non - toxic levels ) was further characterized using a more specific bioactivity assay , performed on a neurodegeneration cell model .
peroxides are often used as models to induce oxidative damage in cells cultured under in vitro conditions [ 17 ] .
to this end , the neurodegeneration cell model consisted of a human sk - n - mc neuroblastoma cell line which was submitted to an oxidative injury by hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) .
the neuroprotective capacity of a. unedo and r. idaeus fruit extracts were evaluated and compared by the increase in cell viability detected when extract pre - conditioning was performed before the oxidative insult .
2. results and discussion 2.1 .
total phenols , anthocyaninsand peroxyl scavenging activity hydroethanolic extractions were performed on each fruit , a. unedo and r. idaeus , and the yield was determined .
the extract yield was higher for a. unedo ( 79 % , w / w ) than for r. idaeus ( 47 % , w / w ) .
the total content in phenols was determined ( table 1 ). a. unedo extract yielded a similar content of total phenolics ( 16.46 +/ - 3.66 mg gae. g - 1 dw ) to r. idaeus ( 13.23 +/ - 0.94 mg gae. g - 1 dw ) .
content in total phenols are in the range of values described in the literature for a. unedo and r. idaeus [ 9,18,19 ] .
phenolic compounds previously identified in strawberry tree fruits were mainly gallic acid derivatives , anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins , which are highly active as antioxidants [ 20 ] .
within these groups of antioxidant compounds , proanthocyanidins were the most abundant , representing more than 80 % of the total flavonoid content [ 10 ] .
the phenolic composition obtained for strawberry tree fruits used in this work ( see supplementary data , table 1 and figure 1 ) was similar to the reported bibliography .
we also detected some quercetin and ellagic acid derivatives as minor components .
the raspberry extracts gave lc - ms profiles similar to previous work [ 14 ] and were dominated by anthocyanins and ellagitannins ( see supplementary data , table 3 and table 4 and figure 2 ) , with a number of other minor components .
anthocyanins are a group of phenolic compounds of great interest in nutrition and medicine because of their potent antioxidant capacity and possible protective effects on human health [ 21 ] .
the total anthocyanin content of raspberry was much higher than strawberry tree fruits ( table 1 ) .
three main anthocyanins ( cyanidin - 3 - o - beta - d - galactopyranoside , delphinidin - 3 - o - beta - d - glucopyranoside and cyanidin - 3 - o - beta - d - arabinopyranoside ; see supplementary data , table 2 and figure 1c ) were seen in a. unedo fruits which agrees with previous reports [ 12 ] .
on the other hand , the most abundant r. idaeus anthocyanins are usually cyanidin - 3 - o - sophoroside , cyanidin - 3 - o - ( 2g ) - glucosylrutinoside , cyanidin - 3 - o - glucoside , pelargonidin - 3 - o - sophoroside , cyanidin - 3 - o - rutinoside and pelargonidin - 3 - o - ( 2g ) - glucosylrutinoside .
lower amounts of pelargonidin - 3 - o - glucoside and pelargonidin - 3 - o - rutinoside were also detected [ 14 ] .
the raspberry extracts used in this study differed from reported anthocyanin compositions ( e.g. [ 14 ]) with the dominant anthocyanins being cyanidin - 3 - o - sophoroside and cyanidin - 3 - o - rutinoside , probably as a result of varietal differences ( see supplementary data , table 4 and figure 2c ) .
nutrients - 02 - 00214 - t001 _ table 1 table 1 total phenol , anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity of a. unedo and r. idaeus fruits .
fruit total phenol content ( mg gae g - 1 dw ) anthocyanin content ( mg cy - 3 - glucoside. 100 g - 1 dw ) antioxidant activity ( mmol te. 100 g - 1 dw ) a. unedo 16.46 +/ - 3.66 76.26 +/ - 9.85 *** 11.66 +/ - 2.01 r. idaeus 13.23 +/ - 0.94 438.60 +/ - 12.20 15.37 +/ - 2.73 each value is the average of three independent replicates +/ - sd .
*** - significantly different values for p < 0.001 .
based on their high phenol content , it was possible to reasonably anticipate a high antioxidant activity for both a. unedo and r. idaeus berries .
the antioxidant capacity , assessed by orac , was similar for both fruits ( 11.66 +/ - 2.01 mmol te.100 g - 1 dw for strawberry tree fruit and 15.37 +/ - 2.73 mmol te. 100 g - 1 dw for raspberry ) .
antioxidant capacities reported in the literature are difficult to compare due to differences in the methodologies used .
however , garcia - alonso and co - workers determined the antioxidant activity of 27 fruits , including strawberry tree and raspberry , and established a ranking ( teac method ) where strawberry tree antioxidant capacity was ranked slightly higher than that of raspberry [ 22 ] .
both a. unedo and r. idaeus berries have been characterized as good sources of antioxidants , with their antioxidant properties associated to different groups of compounds .
for a. unedo , this activity is attributed to the high flavonoid content , ( mainly comprised by proanthocyanidins , cyanidin and delphinidin glycosides ) , ellagic acid and its diglucoside derivative , vitamin c and e and carotenoids [ 10 ]. r. idaeus studies performed with an ellagitannin - rich fraction show that this fraction had considerably higher antioxidant capacity than the original raspberry extract or an anthocyanin - rich fraction [ 14 ] , a observation already noted by others [ 23 ] .
over 50 % of the total raspberry antioxidant capacity is conferred by sanguiin h6 and lambertianin c [ 23 ] .
knowledge of the chemically - determined antioxidant characterization of a. unedo berries is certainly important .
however , its biological significance remains to be evaluated .
it is therefore crucial to validate these bioactivities on different cell - based human - disease models assays and , at the end , in the overall organism .
2.2 .
effect of fruit extracts on a neurodegeneration cell model based on promising in vitro antioxidant results , a neuroprotective test was performed using an sk - n - mc human neuroblastoma cell line .
firstly , a non - toxic range of concentrations of raspberry and strawberry tree fruit extracts were defined .
toxicity tests involved the determination of cell viability after a 4 h incubation in the range 0 to 500 mug gae .
ml - 1 medium .
no toxic effects were observed in cell viability until 125 mug gae .
ml - 1 for both fruits , as shown in figure 1 .
for concentrations higher than 125 mug gae .
ml - 1 , the viability decreased , particularly with raspberry , probably because the compounds become toxic for cells .
this phenomenon should happen since many plant secondary products seem to have a paradoxical ( hormetic ) effect on diseases that depend on their concentration and thus level of consumption [ 24 ] ; at low concentrations a compound could exert a benefic effect , but when its concentration is too high for the organism / cells it starts to be toxic [ 25,26,27 ] .
figure 1 cytotoxicity evaluation of a. unedo and r. idaeus extracts in the neuroblastoma cell line sk - n - mc. cell viability was determined with 3.45 x 105 cells / well in the range of 0 to 500 mug gae .
ml - 1 medium , using the celltiter - blue ( r ) cell viability assay. a. unedo r. idaeus .
each point is the average of three independent replicates .
vertical bars represent +/ - sd. to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of the fruit extracts , the neuroblastoma cell line sk - n - mc was submitted to an oxidative stress after a pre - incubation with the dried fruit extracts solubilized in medium .
peroxides are often used as models to induce oxidative damage in cells cultured under in vitro conditions [ 17 ] .
to this end , the ability of hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) to induce oxidative stress in sk - n - mc cells was assessed by the cell viability test already described above .
non - toxic concentrations of the fruits extracts were used in the sk - n - mc cells challenged with 1 mm h2o2 to evaluate the neuroprotection capacity of the phytochemicals .
this test evaluates the cytoprotective activities of the compounds , by protecting cell viability after pre - conditioning the cells with the extracts before the oxidative injury .
although the chemically - measured antioxidant activity exhibited by strawberry tree fruit was slightly lower from that of raspberry , the raspberry extract rescued cell survival while no significant effect in neuroblastoma viability was detected with the strawberry tree berry extract , using the same amount of polyphenols , estimated by folin - ciocaulteau method ( figure 2 ) .
figure 2 effect of a. unedo and r. idaeus fruit extracts on cell viability after h2o2 insult sk - n - mc cells were treated with 1 mm h2o2 for 1.5 h after 1 h pre - conditioning with the fruit extracts .
assay was performed with 2.8 x 105 cells / well as described in methods , and cell viability was determined using the celltiter - blue ( r ) cell viability assay .
(*) 0 ( control ) , () 50 , () 125 and (*) 175 microg gae . ml - 1 .
each point is the average of three independent replicates .
vertical bars represent +/ - sd .
** - significantly different values for p < 0.01 . in fact , the incubation of the human cells with 1 mm h2o2 for 1.5 hours reduced viability to 25 % , whereas pre - incubation with r. idaeus extract enhanced cell survival to 33.8 % .
in other words , the overall increase in cell viability with r.idaeus was estimated as 36.6 % at 50 microg gae .
ml - 1 and 27.8 % at 125 microg gae .
ml - 1 , but decreased for higher concentrations ( 8.9 % at 175 microg gae. ml - 1 ) .
both r. idaeus and a. unedo fruits are potential sources of bioactive compounds like vitamin c , phenolic acids , proanthocyanidins and flavonol derivatives , however the absence of cell protection detected for a. unedo suggests that its phytochemical composition is not effective against h2o2 stress induced in this neuroblastoma cell models , but does not exclude biological effectiveness in other systems .
these fruits are qualitatively quite different in their chemical composition which could explain the different bioefficacy in protecting cells from oxidative stress .
in fact , the biological effects presented by r. idaeus fruits could be attributed to ellagitannin content ( not present in a. unedo ) and the higher levels of anthocyanins .
this study is a good example of the importance in evaluating the biological function of phenolics to validate their in vitro antioxidant activity .
further assays in different biosystems will be performed to validate the biological effects of a. unedo phytochemicals .
3. experimental section 3.1 .
biological material arbutus unedo l. fruits were collected in november 2007 , by random sampling in an extensive area of arrabida natural park ( southern region of portugal ) .
the samples were immediately ground and freeze dried and stored at - 80degreesc prior to extraction .
rubus idaeus cv. polka was grown in herdade experimental da fataca , odemira , portugal .
3.2 .
extract preparation to each 1 g of lyophilized powder , 12 ml of hydroethanolic solvent ( ethanol 50 % ( v / v )) were added and the mixture was shaken for 30 min , at room temperature in the dark .
the mixture was then centrifuged at 12,400 g during 10 min at room temperature .
the supernatant was filtered through paper filter and then through 0.20 microm cellulose acetate membrane filters .
the resulting extracts were stored frozen at - 80 degreesc , no longer than one month .
for each fruit extract , an aliquot was freeze dried under vacuum conditions and the yield was determined .
3.3 .
total phenolic measurement determination of total phenolic compounds was performed by the folin - ciocalteau method [ 28 ] .
briefly , to each well of a microplate , 235 microl water , 5 microl sample ( or solvent , in the control ) , 15 microl folin - ciocalteau 's reagent ( fluka ( r )) and 45 microl saturated na2co3 were added .
the microplate was incubated for 30 min at 40 degreesc and the absorbance at 765 nm measured .
gallic acid was used as the standard and the results were expressed in mg of gallic acid equivalents per g of dry weight of plant material ( mg gae. g - 1 dw ) .
3.4 .
anthocyanin content the total anthocyanin content of the fruit extracts was determined using a ph differential absorbance method [ 18 ] .
absorbance readings were related to anthocyanin content using the molar extinction coefficient of 12100 calculated for cyanidin - 3 - o - glucoside .
results were expressed as mg of cyanidin 3 - glucoside equivalents per 100 g of dry weight of plant material ( mg cy - 3 - glucoside. 100 g - 1 dw ) .
3.5 .
peroxyl radical scavenging capacity assay peroxyl radical scavenging capacity was determined by the orac ( oxygen radical absorbance capacity ) method [ 19,29 ] .
briefly , the reaction mixture contained 150 microl of sodium fluorescein ( 0.2 nm ) ( uranine , fluorescein sodium salt ( r ) tci europe ) , 25 microl sample and 25 microl of 2,2 ' - azobis ( 2 - amidopropane ) dihydrochloride ( 41.4 g.l - 1 ) .
the blank contained 25 microl 75 mm phosphate buffer ( ph 7.4 ) instaed of sample , whereas the standards contained 25 microl of 10 to 50 microm 6 - hydroxy - 2,5,7,8 - tetramethylchroman - 2 - carboxylic acid ( trolox ( r )) in place of the sample .
the fluorescent emission at 515 nm was then monitored kinetically during 30 min at 37 degreesc , after excitation at 493 nm using a flx800 fluorescence microplate reader ( biotek ) .
the final results were calculated using the area differences under the fluorescence decay curves between the blank and the sample , and were expressed as mm trolox equivalents per g of dry weight of plant material ( mm te. 100 g - 1 dw ) .
3.6 .
hplc - ms phenolic profile determination phenolic extracts were dried by rotary evaporation , ressuspended in 5 % ( v / v ) acetonitrile in water and was analyzed on a lcq - deca system controlled by the xcalibur software ( 2.0 , thermofinnigan ) .
the lcq - deca system comprised a surveyor autosampler , pump and photo diode array detector ( pdad ) and a thermo finnigan mass spectrometer iontrap .
the pda collected spectral data from 200 - 600 nm and scanned three discrete channels ( at 280 , 365 and 510 nm ) .
the samples were applied to a c - 18 column ( synergi hydro c18 column with polar end capping , 4.6 mm x 150 mm , phenomonex ltd. ) and eluted over a gradient of 95:5 solvent a : b at time = 0 minutes to 60:40 a : b at time = 60 minutes at a flow rate of 400 mul / min .
solvent a was 0.1 % ( v / v ) formic acid in ultra pure water and solvent b 0.1 % ( v / v ) formic acid in acetonitrile .
the lcq - deca lc - ms was fitted with an esi ( electrospray ionization ) interface and analyzed the samples in positive and negative - ion mode .
two scan events , full scan analysis in mass range 80 - 2000 m / z followed by data dependent ms / ms of the most intense ions , were used for compounds detection and identification .
the data - dependent ms / ms used collision energies ( source voltage ) of 45 % .
the capillary temperature was set at 275 degreesc with sheath gas at 60 psi and auxiliary gas at 10 psi .
before the analysis , the system was tuned by using known concentrations of cyanidin - 3 - glucoside ( positive mode ) and quercetin - 3 - glucoside ( negative mode ) in ultrapure water .
3.7 .
cell culture human neuroblastoma sk - n - mc cells were obtained from the european collection of cell cultures ( ecacc ) and cultured in emem supplemented with 2 mm glutamine , 10 % ( v / v ) heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( gibco ) , 1 % ( w / v ) of non - essential amino acids and sodium pyruvate ( 1mm ) .
the cells were maintained at 37 degreesc in 5 % co2 .
all experiments were carried out 24 - 48 h after cells were seeded .
3.8 .
cell viability hydroethanolic extracts were prepared as described above , dried under vacuum and solubilized in cell medium for the cytotoxicity tests .
the test was performed by a 96 - well plate cell viability assay on the neuroblastoma human cell line sk - n - mc , to identify the nontoxic range of extract concentrations .
toxicity tests involved a 4 h incubation in the range 0 to 500 mug gae .
ml - 1 medium .
cell viability was assessed using the celltiter - blue ( r ) cell viability assay , a fluorescent method based on the ability of living cells to convert a non - fluorescent redox dye ( resazurin ) into a fluorescent end product ( resorufin ) , according to the manufacture instructions .
nonviable cells rapidly lose their metabolic capacity and thus do not generate the fluorescent signal .
3.9 .
intracellular antioxidant activity neuroblastoma cells were pre - incubated for 1 h with strawberry tree or raspberry fruit extracts and then were treated with h2o2 ( 1 mm ) for 1.5 h. fruit hydroethanolic extracts were prepared as described above , dried under vacuum and dissolved in cell medium .
cell viability was evaluated as described above .
3.10 .
statistical analysis the results reported in this work are the averages of at least three independent experiments and are represented as the mean +/ - sd. differences among treatments were detected by analysis of variance [ 30 ] with tukey hsd ( honest significant difference ) multiple comparison test ( alpha = 0.05 ) using sigmastat 3.10 ( systat ) .
4. conclusions the involvement of free radicals , specially their increased production , appears to be a common feature to most human diseases , including cardiovascular disease , neurodegeneration and cancer .
as such , dietary antioxidants have been suggested to be particularly important tools to fight against these diseases , by affording protection towards free radical damage in cellular dna , lipids and proteins .
in rubus species an attempt has been made to rationalize the antioxidant potential in terms of the phenolic compounds present [ 18 ] .
in all samples analyzed , ascorbic acid was found to make only a minor contribution ( 3 %) to the total antioxidant capacity ; the majority of the antioxidant capacity thus appeared to be due to flavonoids , the dominant family of phenolic compounds [ 18 ] .
although the chemically - determined antioxidant characterization of berries is important , evidence for their biological significance in human diseases and homeostasis is lacking .
therefore , the validation of these bioactivities in different cell - based human - disease model assays is very important , together with information on the bioavailability and metabolism of these phytomolecules .
in this study , a neurodegeneration cell model was used to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of the strawberry tree and raspberry fruit phenolics .
the neuroblastoma cell line sk - n - mc was subjected to an oxidative stress after pre - incubation with the fruits extracts .
although the measured chemical antioxidant activity exhibited by strawberry tree fruit was comparable to that presented by raspberry , the latter could increase cell survival by 36.6 % while no effect in neuroblastoma viability was detected with the former .
these results clearly demonstrate that an interesting level of chemically - determined antioxidant activity present in a plant extract is not necessarily correlated with biological significance , as concluded by the effect of strawberry tree fruit on a neurodegeneration cell model .
it is clearly evident that many more cell and organism assays should be performed to validate previously detected chemical bioactivities .
as a whole , the results presented in this work show that there is no protective effect of strawberry tree berry phenolics on a neurodegeneration cell model , but do not exclude other possible relevant biological effects .

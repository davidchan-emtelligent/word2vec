the most common form of muscular dystrophy is duchenne muscular dystrophy ( dmd ) , which is an x - linked disorder affecting 1 in 3500 newborn males across the world .
dmd is caused by the lack of dystrophin which is a protein that provides stability to the sarcolemma and is likely involved in the transmission of force between the extracellular matrix and the intracellcular contractile apparatus ( lovering and brooks , 2013 ) .
due to the absence of this protein , the sarcolemma is easily damaged in response to muscle contraction ( markert et al. , 2012 ) .
although there is no cure for dmd , exercise has been proposed as a possible treatment ; however , the risk of muscle damage is a large concern for this population ( markert et al. , 2012 ) .
therefore , traditional strength training which includes high load eccentric contractions may need to be avoided in patients with dmd due to the susceptibility of muscle damage with lengthening contractions .
in addition , although submaximal exercise may exert some benefits for this population , the low load exercise is unlikely to be an optimal stimulus for maintaining or increasing muscle function .
interestingly , there are numerous studies (> 40 ) in healthy subjects which suggest that submaximal exercise in combination with blood flow restriction ( bfr ) can elicit muscle adaptations similar to that observed with higher load resistance training ( loenneke et al. , 2012c ) without increasing indices of muscle damage ( loenneke et al. , 2011 ) .
briefly , bfr is a stimulus commonly applied with specialized pressure cuffs placed at the top of a limb which are inflated to a set pressure throughout exercise .
the pressure applied should be high enough to occlude venous return from the muscle but low enough to maintain arterial inflow into the muscle .
available evidence indicates that the pressure applied should be based on the size of the limb ( i.e. , bigger the limb higher the pressure ) ( loenneke et al. , 2012b ) .
the proposed mechanisms ( loenneke et al. , 2012a ) behind the effects of low load exercise in combination with bfr on skeletal muscle include acute muscle cell swelling , increased fiber type recruitment from metabolic accumulation , decreased myostatin ( 48 h after last training session ) , decreased atrogenes ( 8 h post exercise ) , and the proliferation of satellite cells ( 8 days into training intervention , 3 and 10 days after cessation of training ) ( nielsen et al. , 2012 ) .
a recent review discussed 5 mechanisms of dmd pathology which may improve or worsen as a result of exercise training which included : ( 1 ) mechanical weakening of the sarcolemma ; ( 2 ) inappropriate calcium influx ; ( 3 ) aberrant cell signaling ( angiogenesis ) ; ( 4 ) increased oxidative stress ; and ( 5 ) recurrent muscle ischemia ( markert et al. , 2012 ) .
the purpose of this manuscript is to discuss each one of these mechanisms as it relates to what is known about low load resistance exercise in combination with bfr .
mechanical weakening muscles that lack dystrophin result in sarcolemmal fragility , making the muscle easily susceptible to damage ( menke and jockusch , 1995 ) .
maximal eccentric contractions are known to result in muscle damage ; however , this is not observed with submaximal exercise in combination with bfr ( unpublished observations ) .
despite this lack of muscle damage , pronounced changes in muscle mass and strength occur ( loenneke et al. , 2012c ) .
recent research suggests that the concentric muscle action is playing the most important role with respect to changes in muscle mass and strength ( yasuda et al. , 2012 ) .
therefore , it is conceivable that patients with dmd could possibly increase muscle size and strength from completing submaximal concentric only muscle actions with bfr , which has not been observed to increase any indices of muscle damage in healthy subjects ( unpublished observations ) .
however , it is acknowledged that this response may be different in patients in dmd , who already have a fragile sarcolemma .
calcium influx the maintenance of calcium at an appropriate level in skeletal muscle ( resting cytosolic concentration of ~ 50 nm ) is important and when calcium is not properly regulated , muscle degradation can occur .
the mechanism behind this muscle degradation is not completely known , however , one proposed mechanism is an increase in calpains .
calpain 3 is tightly bound to titin and is involved in degradation by disassembling the outer layers of proteins from the myofibril .
muscles of mdx mice have increased calpain concentration and activity ( spencer et al. , 1995 ) , which is diminished in mdx mice that overexpress calpastatin ( spencer and mellgren , 2002 ) .
interestingly , it has been recently hypothesized that calpastatins are likely increased with the application of bfr ( loenneke et al. , 2012d ) .
the possible increase in calpastatin with bfr is thought to occur through signaling of the beta 2 adrenoceptor following binding of norepinephrine .
although theoretically plausible due to the increase in norepinephrine following the application of bfr , future work is needed to determine if the increase in calpastatin actually occurs in healthy or dmd muscle .
angiogenesis angiogenesis in skeletal muscle results from hypoxia , shear stress , and increases in growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) ( larkin et al. , 2012 ) .
in addition , there is evidence that the frequency of mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) correlates with blood vessel density ( da silva meirelles et al. , 2009 ) which suggests that angiogenesis may increase the availability of mscs for regenerating tissue in patients with dmd .
recently , low load resistance exercise in combination with bfr has been observed to increase post - exercise expression of mrna related to skeletal muscle angiogenesis in healthy young adults ( larkin et al. , 2012 ) .
this provides proof of concept for possible future work in patients with dmd to determine if tissue regeneration is possible following exercise in combination with bfr .
however , it should also be mentioned that if the availability of mscs is increased with exercise in combination with bfr , these mscs would carry the same genetic mutations as the patients' somatic cells ( markert et al. , 2012 ) .
oxidative stress oxidative stress is a biological phenomenon marked by an imbalance between reactive free radicals and antioxidant defenses .
when oxidative stress is severe and / or prolonged , the natural defense system can be overwhelmed , leading to subsequent oxidative damage of lipids , proteins , and dna .
lipids comprise part of the sarcolemma and these lipids are preferentially attacked by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species ( murphy and kehrer , 1989 ) .
if this attack is not corrected by antioxidants , it could lead to the destruction of the contractile units of the muscle cell , actin , and myosin .
although heavy resistance training can increase oxidative stress , submaximal exercise with bfr has not been shown to increase oxidative stress in those who are healthy ( goldfarb et al. , 2008 ) or in those with heart disease ( madarame et al. , 2013 ) .
therefore , exercise with bfr may be able to increase / maintain muscle function in those with dmd without further increasing levels of oxidative stress .
recurrent muscle ischemia there is some mechanistic evidence for recurrent muscle ischemia in the muscle of dmd patients .
briefly , studies have shown that in healthy skeletal muscle , blood flow during exercise is increased to the working muscle due to nitric oxide release .
however , this does not occur in dmd muscle , therefore the reflex sympathetic vasoconstriction that accompanies contraction of dmd muscle is unopposed by nitric oxide mediated vasodilation resulting in ischemic muscle ( markert et al. , 2012 ) .
although the application of bfr during exercise is acute and brief , it is possible that this impaired vascular control in those with dmd could contraindicate them to this mode of exercise .
the only evidence available to suggest bfr in combination with exercise may be safe in this population comes from a single case study from a patient with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy ( gualano et al. , 2010 ) .
it has been hypothesized that idiopathic inflammatory myopathies also have impaired vascular function ( grundtman and lundberg , 2009 ) , suggesting that improvements in muscle function may occur following acute bouts of bfr exercise in patients with a compromised vascular system .
however , the mechanism of vascular dysfunction for idiopathic inflammatory myopathy is different than that for dmd ; therefore direct comparisons between the two conditions should be made with caution .
conclusion in conclusion , we wish to suggest the possibility that the application of bfr in combination with exercise may be beneficial for maintaining / increasing muscle function in patients with dmd .
this is based on the observations that bfr in combination with submaximal exercise increases muscle function without increasing markers of muscle damage or oxidative stress .
future research is needed to confirm that these effects largely observed in healthy subjects , would transfer to patients with dmd .
it may be useful to first design and test this theory in an animal model to determine proof of concept .

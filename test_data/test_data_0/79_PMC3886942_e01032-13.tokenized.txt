a ranavirus ( rv ) was isolated from chinese giant salamanders ( andrias davidianus ) in china in 2010 and provisionally designated andrias davidianus ranavirus ( adrv ) .
the complete genome sequence is 106,719 nucleotides long .
genomic sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that adrv has a high degree of conservation with other rvs .
cover - datejanuary / february 2014access - typefree genome announcement ranavirus , one of the genera of the iridoviridae family , is recognized as causing an emerging infectious disease that is included in the list of notifiable diseases by the world organisation for animal health ( oie ) .
ranavirus ( rv ) infections have been associated with mass mortalities of several amphibian , reptile , and fish species worldwide ( 1 ) .
in july 2010 , an rv was isolated from diseased chinese giant salamander ( andrias davidianus ) , which is one of the world 's largest amphibian species and is classified as critically endangered by the international union for the conservation of nature and natural resources ; this virus was provisionally designated andrias davidianus ranavirus ( adrv ) ( 2 ) .
to obtain the complete genome sequence of adrv , the virus was cultured on bluegill fry ( bf2 ) cells , and dna from purified viral particles was extracted as described previously ( 3 ) .
sequencing was performed using a 454 gs flx titanium sequencing system ( roche ) combined with sanger sequencing of the pcr products for unresolved regions .
newbler assembler software ( 454 life sciences ) was used to assemble the data into unordered and unoriented contigs .
open reading frames ( orfs ) were predicted with glimmer 3.0 and prodigal version 1.2 ( http :// compbio.ornl.gov / prodigal / server.html ) .
annotation of the predicted orfs was conducted using blastp searches ( http :// blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / blast.cgi ) and rps - blast searches ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / structure / cdd / wrpsb.cgi ) at the ncbi conserved domain database ( cdd ) and clusters of orthologous groups of proteins ( cog ) database .
the adrv genome has a full length of 106,719 bp , with a g + c content of 55.04 % and 101 orfs encoding putatively expressed proteins with conserved domains assigned to structural proteins , as well as proteins potentially involved in replication , transcription , and host response modification , which possess defined functions and are highly homologous to those of other rvs .
for 95 adrv - predicted proteins , orthologs were readily found in other rv genomes , with identities ranging from 77 % to 100 % .
only six orfs had not been previously annotated in other rvs , but no significant similarities to other known proteins were found in the databases. whether these proteins are truly expressed and functional during adrv infection remains to be addressed .
the phylogenetic relationships between adrv and other fully sequenced rvs show that adrv has a high degree of similarity to other rvs , which are closely related to the type virus of the genus ranavirus , frog virus 3 ( fv3 ) ( 4 ) .
the degree of colinearity analysis performed by using dot plot analyses of the adrv genome with those of other rvs revealed similar results ( data not shown ) .
interestingly , the adrv genome shows complete colinearity with the genome of common midwife toad virus ( cmtv ) , isolated from diseased tadpoles in 2007 in spain ( genbank accession no. jq231222 ) ( 5 ) .
studies investigating the complete genome of adrv will provide novel information about rvs and are beneficial for investigating the epidemiology and ecology of rvs worldwide .
nucleotide sequence accession number .
the complete genome sequence of adrv has been deposited in genbank under the accession no. kf033124 .

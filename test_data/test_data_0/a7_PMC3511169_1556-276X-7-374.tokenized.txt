we present a systematic study of lead - salt nanocrystals ( ncs ) doped with mn. we have developed a theoretical simulation of electronic and magneto - optical properties by using a multi - band calculation including intrinsic anisotropies and magnetic field effects in the diluted magnetic semiconductor regime .
theoretical findings regarding both broken symmetry and critical phenomena were studied by contrasting two different host materials ( pbse and pbte ) and changing the confinement geometry , dot size , and magnetic doping concentration .
we also pointed out the relevance of optical absorption spectra modulated by the magnetic field that characterizes these ncs .
nanocrystals quantum dots dms ii - vi semiconductors lead salts magneto - optical properties review recently , the successful fabrication of iv - vi nanocrystals doped with mn has shown possible effective tuning of the emission energy from infrared ( dot radius ~ 200 a ) up to near - ultraviolet ( dot radius ~ 20 a ) regions [ 1 ] .
the iv - vi semiconductors , such as pbse nanocrystals ( ncs ) , provide access to the limit of strong quantum confinement where , besides the changes induced by very small dot size , the direct narrow band - gap that can also be engineered by the gradual addition of dilute amounts of magnetic mn ions to the dot structure .
the members of the lead - salt family , such as pbse and pbte , have rock - salt crystalline structure with a direct bandgap in the l - point and the energy branches are four - fold degenerate .
the bottom of the conduction band has l6 - symmetry with the top of the valence band displaying l6 + symmetry of the double group d3 .
this corresponds to the opposite situation observed in iii - v or ii - vi zinc blend materials , since here the valence band - edge bloch function displays s - like symmetry whereas the conduction band - edge bloch function has pz - like symmetries , where z denotes the < 111 > direction of the cubic lattice [ 2 ] .
in this letter , we contrast quantum dot electronic properties of two iv - vi semiconductor materials by modifying the quantum confinement from spherical to semispherical and varying the diluted concentration of incorporated mn2 + ions .
the electronic , magnetic , and optical properties are studied as a function of mn content for varying temperature .
the total hamiltonian of the system is h = hkp + v + hx where hkp is the hyperbolic or kane - dimmock [ 3 ] k . p hamiltonian model for iv - vi semiconductors , v is a hard wall confinement potential and hx is the exchange interaction between mn2 + ions and conduction band ( valence band ) spins .
here , hkp was slightly modified to explore spherical symmetries of the confinements ( 1 ) hkp = eg - d1 - hplm0pz0hptm0p - hplm0pzd2 + hptm0p - 00hptm0p + eg - d1 - hplm0pzhptm0p + 0hplm0pzd2 + where di +/ - = - h2nabla22mt +/ - + cipz2 , with nabla2 as the 3d laplacian operator , and c1 = h221ml - - 1mt - c2 = h221ml + - 1mt + are electron and hole effective mass terms while ptand pl are the anisotropic conduction - valence kane - dimmock coupling parameters for longitudinal and transverse directions ; pz and p +/ - = px +/ - ipy are the momentum operators , whereas eg is the bandgap and m0 is the free electron mass .
the relevant kane - dimmock parameters for the materials analyzed in this work can be found in [ 4,5 ] .
also , hx = - x / 2 < sz ( bt )> n0 . alpha (. beta ) , where < sz ( btx )> is the mean field magnetization at temperature t , represented as a brillouin function in dilute doped sample containing n0 unit cells and mn content , x [ 6 ] .
finally , alpha and beta are the exchange constants for the semimagnetic materials , n0 . alpha = - 0.08 ev and n0.beta = 0.02 ev for pbmnse , while n0.alpha = - 0.45 ev and n0.beta = 0.29 ev for pbmnte [ 5 ] .
a complete set of eigenfunctions for the total hamiltonian h can be spanned in terms of products of periodic bloch functions | j,jz > near the l - point and envelope functions .
for spherical confinement , we expand the four - component spinor wave functions in two hilbert subspaces with the general form [ 7,8 ] .
( 2 ) psii [ ii ] m ( r )= sumnsuml >= minfinitycn,2l [ 2l + 1 ] mfn,2l [ 2l + 1 ] ml6 - ^ cn,2l + 1 [ 2l ] mfn,2l + 1 [ 2l ] ml6 +^ cn,2l [ 2l + 1 ] m + 1fn,2l [ 2l + 1 ] m + 1l6 - vcn,2l + 1 [ 2l ] m + 1fn,2l + 1 [ 2l ] m + 1l6 + v , for the spherical model , these states fulfill the boundary condition psii,iim ( r )= 0 at the dot radius ; thus , the function components have the form fn,lm ( r,theta,phi )= an,ljl ( knlr ) ylm ( theta,phi ) where an,l is a normalization constant , jl ( x ) is the spherical bessel function , and ylm ( theta,phi ) are the spherical harmonics .
the subspaces must be constructed with special combinations of even ( fn,lm ( r )) or odd ( fn,2l + 1m ( r )) with wave number knl = munl / r , where munl is the nth zero of jl ( x ) = 0 .
for the semispherical structures , the states must also fulfill the boundary condition psii,iim ( r,theta = pi2,phi )= 0 at the equator plane which restricts the set of quantum numbers l and m to the condition | l - m | = odd number .
hence , the parities of the spinor components differ from the full spherical case and the states psii [ ii ] m ( r ) for a semispherical confinement require the replacement 2l ( 2l + 1 ) in the second ( third ) line of equation 2 by 2l + 1 ( 2l ) .
figure 1a,b shows the changes in the magnetic energy dispersions for the first few levels in pb1 - xmnxse dots with r = 300 a when the confinement is changed from spherical to semispherical .
the broken symmetry induces stronger changes on the electron than on the hole energy dispersions by inducing anti - crossing regions .
the exchange coupling affects mainly the conduction carrier dispersion .
however , for pb1 - xmnxte dots with the same size r , shown in figure 2a,b with both broken symmetry and exchange interaction , induce strong changes on both carrier magnetic dispersions but with the valence - band being more sensitive .
the interplay between the usual zeeman effect and the exchange interaction gives place to the crossing between spin - split levels at certain critical field , bc , as displayed in figure 2 for both spherical and semispherical dot spatial confinements .
figure 1 conduction and valence band energy levels as function of magnetic field in pb1 - xmnxse ncs with spherical ( a ) and semispherical ( b ) confinements of radius r = 300 a andt = 1.8 k. the subbands structure with ( solid line ) and without mn - doping ( dashed line ) were calculated using ec ( v ) - eg ( x ) .
figure 2 conduction and valence band energy levels as function of the magnetic field in pb1 - xmnxte ncs with spherical ( a ) and semispherical ( b ) confinements with radius r = 300 a and t = 4.8 k. the other subband structure details are given in figure 1 .
figure 3a,b shows that the critical field strength for pb1 - xmnxte dots , at a fixed temperature , increases with increasing mn content for different dot sizes .
note that the smaller the dot size r , the larger the critical concentration xc where bc => 0 .
for the limit b - - > 0 , we have calculated the lande g - factor of the conduction band ground state of pb1 - xmnx te dots as gemubb = e ( e ^ , 1 / 2,n ) - e ( ev , - 1 / 2,n ) , where mub = eh /( 2m0c ) is the bohr magneton , e ( e ^( v ) , fz n ) is the energy of the corresponding spin state , and fz = lz + jz is the z - component of total angular momentum f = l + s. the ge - values for pb1 - xmnxte dots as shown in figure 3c,d displays similar behavior as reported in [ 9,10 ] ge ( brx ) to approximately1 / r. figure 3 critical magnetic field as function of the mn concentration for different pb1 - xmnx te nc radii critical magnetic field as function of the mn concentration for different pb1 - xmnx te nc radii ( a,b ) ; lande g factor in the limitb - - > 0as function of the nc radius for various mn contents ( c,d ) and for the spherical ( left panels ) and semispherical confinements ( right panels ) .
as noted in figure 3c,d , there are mn concentration regions where the g factor becomes strictly positive or negative , independent of the confinement shape .
for fixed dot radius , it is possible to predict the existence of a zero critical field value for a certain value xc for different dot and confinement geometries .
for large dot sizes , a nonlinear increasing of bc is observed for low values of x and a quasi - linear behavior otherwise .
in order to discuss the optical absorption spectrum , the probability for dipole - allowed optical transitions between single electron and hole states has to be evaluated in detail .
within the electrical dipole approximation , the oscillator strength is a linear combination of the matrix elements of the optical transitions , mj,j '=< psij | e ^. p ^| psij '>=< fj | fj '>.< uj | e ^. p ^| uj '>+< uj | uj '>.< fj | e ^. p ^| fj '> .
here , e ^ is the light polarization vector , p ^ is the momentum operator , fjand ujare the envelope and periodic bloch functions at the l point for each involved carrier j , respectively .
the second term on the right - hand side is responsible for intraband optical transitions , since < uj | uj '> = deltajj ' .
in this case the incident light couples , in the same band , state with different symmetries whenever the term < fj | e ^. p ^| fj '>!= 0 for a given polarization .
in our case the complete set of selection rules are obtained from the nonvanishing products of the matrix elements ie,hdeltale,lhpialpha,alpha ' , where pialpha,alpha ' is the matrix of the parity operator , and ie,h = < fe,alpha | fh,alpha > is the overlap integral of the electron - hole envelope functions allowed by the interband transition alpha - - > alpha ' .
the allowed transitions between states belonging to the hilbert subspaces described by spinors ( 2 ) are determined from the angular dependence of the wave functions fn,lm ( r ) .
the corresponding selection rules for each optical transition in any polarization can be precisely obtained according to kang et al .
[ 2 ] .
due to the differences in the angular momenta l ( symmetry and parity ) of electron and hole spinor components , the allowed transitions occur only between initial ( hole ) and final ( electron ) states belonging to different hilbert subspaces ( i => ii or ii => i ) for linear light polarization piz and for circular light polarization sigma +/ - . moreover , the preservation of the total angular momentum fz , between initial and final states requires that deltam = 0 for voigt - piz , and deltam = +/ - 1 for faraday - sigma +/ - geometry .
for the circular polarization , the optical matrix element takes the form ( 3 ) < psie,ime | e ^+/ - . p ^| psih,iimh >= pfne,menh,mh ( i,ii ) deltame,mh +/ - 1 , where ( 4 ) fne,menh,mh ( i,ii )= sumn,l >= mcn,betae +/ - cn,betae +/ - + cn,betah +/ - cn,betah +/ - , with beta = 2l + 1 / 2 - /+ 1 / 2 .
in the same way , the i - - > ii transitions can be obtained by interchanging 2l + 1 / 2 - /+ 1 / 2 by 2l + 1 / 2 +/ - 1 / 2 .
the absorption coefficient can then be written as follows [ 7 ] : ( 5 ) alpha ( e ^+/ - , omega )= alpha0sumne,nh,mgammapixfne,mnh,m +/ - 1 ( i,ii ) 2 [ ene,m ( i ) - enh,m +/ - 1 ( ii ) - homega ] 2 + gamma2 + fne,mnh,m - /+ 1 ( i,ii ) 2 [ ene,m ( ii ) - enh,m - /+ 1 ( i ) - homega ] 2 + gamma2 , where alpha0 is a magnitude which includes the bulk p parameter and the dielectric constant .
the material parameters can be found in [ 4,5 ] .
for the linear light polarization piz , the optical matrix element becomes ( 6 ) psie,ime | e ^+/ - . p ^| psih,iimh = pvne,menh,mh ( i,ii ) deltame,mh +/ - 1 , where ( 7 ) vne,menh,mh ( i,ii )= sumn,l >= mcn,betae + cn,betah ++ cn,betae - cn,betah - , and the related absorption coefficient turns ( 8 ) alpha ( e ^ z,omega )= alpha0sumne,nh,mgammapixvne,mnh,m ( i,ii ) 2 [ ene,m ( i ) - enh,m ( ii ) - homega ] 2 + gamma2 + vne,mnh,m ( i,ii ) 2 [ ene,m ( ii ) - enh,m ( i ) - homega ] 2 + gamma2 .
in the case of semispherical geometry , the selection rules for the circular light polarization are the same as for the spherical case ; meanwhile , for the linear light polarization , these allow transitions within the same subspace due to the parities of the components of the wave functions in the subspaces .
the excitonic resonances for piz and sigma + , calculated as a function of the magnetic field for each mn - doped lead - salt dot and confinements , are shown in figure 4a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h. in figure 5 , we displayed the corresponding excitonic resonances for sigma + of the reference samples ( without mn doping ) for spherical confinement .
comparing figures 4e and 5a and figures 4g and 5b , we confirm that the effect of mn doping on the absorption spectra is stronger on the bandgap renormalization than on the subband levels in the doped salt - selenide unlike the salt - telluride , where the mn presence strongly modifies all the band structure [ 11,12 ] .
the resonant transitions shown in figure 5a,b involve just the conduction band ground state of spherical and semispherical pbmnse dots .
the corresponding spectra for pbmnte , shown in figure 4c,d , correspond to the transitions to the first crossing conduction band levels .
figure 4d displays an absorption bottleneck due to the level crossing ( see figure 2a,b ) for pbmnse spherical dots .
another absorption quenching appears at b = 1.2t in figure 4e caused by the character admixture close to a level crossing .
in turn , figure 4f displays a single transition to the conduction band ground state .
in figures 4g,h two transitions appear that fade - off for lower and higher fields , respectively .
this effect is produced by the modulation of the oscillator strength .
for small nanocrystal size , the spectra will show quantitative variation due to the effective gap modulation and the subsequent weakening of the intersubband coupling .

the same parameters were as referred in figures 1 and 2 .

conclusions summarizing , we have investigated the electronic and magneto - optical properties of pb1 - xmnx se and pb1 - xmnx te semimagnetic dots by taking advantage of their strong sensitivity to spatial confinement asymmetry and properties induced by the mn doping .
we have shown the appearance of the critical phenomena as the spin level crossing for certain concentration of mn on the pb1 - xmnx te and the modulation of the optical absorption controlled by field b and confinement anisotropy .
subtle effects of mn content variation were predicted for the energy spectra of the pb1 - xmnx se dots , whereas important consequences are expected for pb1 - xmnx te dots .
we believe that these results may stimulate research groups working on these important materials to explore device applications working on the wide spectral range .

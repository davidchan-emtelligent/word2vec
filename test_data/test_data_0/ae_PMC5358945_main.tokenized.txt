the proteins subjected to srm analysis , were extracted from wild type and sufr deletion mutant strains grown under iron sufficient and deprived conditions .
2 experimental design , materials and methods 2.1 growth conditions synechocystis sp. pcc 6803 sufr deletion mutant and the wild type strains were cultivated under photoautotrophic conditions in algaetron ag 230 growth chamber ( photon systems instruments , drasov , czech republic ) , under controlled conditions , with 1 % co2 ( v / v ) .
the temperature was set to + 30 degreesc and the light intensity to 50 micromol photons m - 2 s - 1 .
the cells were grown in bg - 11 medium [ 4 ] , buffered with 20 mm tes - koh ( ph 8.0 ) in erlenmeyer culture flasks on a rotary shaker ( 120 rpm ) .
the precultures ( 40 ml bg - 11 in 100 ml flasks ) were grown under standard bg - 11 media until mid - logarithmic phase , harvested by centrifugation and washed either one or three times in standard or iron - depleted bg - 11 media , respectively .
the precultures were used to inoculate the main cultures ( 40 ml bg - 11 in 100 ml flasks ) to the starting od750nm of 0.1 .
the cell density was estimated by measuring the optical density at 750 nm ( od750nm ) with a genesys 10 s uv - vis spectrophotometer ( thermo scientific ) .
the cells were harvested from both iron sufficient and deprived conditions at od750nm 1.0 , and after 12 days under iron deprivation as described in [ 5 ] .
in order to remove all traces of iron from the culture flask used for iron depleted growth , the glassware was treated with 10 % hcl , and rinsed thoroughly with mq - water prior autoclaving .
2.2 sample preparation cells for the proteomics analysis were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with 50 mm tes - koh buffer , ph 8.0 .
the cell pellet was suspended in protein extraction buffer [ 0.1 % ( w / v ) rapigest sf in 8 m urea solubilized in 0.1 m nh4hco3 supplemented with 200 microm pmsf ] with equal volume of acid - washed glass beads ( 150 - 212 microm , sigma ) .
the cells were broken by a bead beater and the insoluble fraction and glass beads were removed by centrifugation .
the proteins were reduced with dithiotreitol and alkylated with iodoacetamide .
the protein extracts were precipitated with 1:5 v / v of 50 % acetone / 50 % ethanol o / n at - 20 degreesc .
the pellet was solubilized by trypsin digestion ( 1:100 trypsin : protein ratio ) in 50 mm nh4hco3 and 5 % acetonitrile ( acn ) buffer for 4 - 5 h at + 37 degreesc shaking .
digestion was continued for an additional 15 - 16 h following a second addition of trypsin in the same ratio .
the digestion was stopped by adding formic acid ( fa ) ( sigma ) to a final concentration of 0.5 - 1 % to lower the ph below 2 .
the digestion mixture was incubated for 30 min at + 37 degreesc at 130 rpm and centrifuged .
to desalt the samples , solid phase extraction of the peptide mixture was performed with 4 mm / 1 ml extraction disk cartridge ( empore ( tm ) c18 - sd , 3 m ( tm )) according to manufacturer 's protocol .
the eluted peptide samples were vacuum - dried ( savant spd1010 , speedvac concentrator , thermo scientific ) and solubilized in 0,1 % fa and 2 % acn and stored at - 80 degreesc prior to ms analysis .
2.3 srm analysis and data - processing the srm assays were performed on a tsq vantage qqq mass spectrometer ( thermo scientific ) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source .
the desalted peptides were separated on a nanoflow hplc system ( easynanolc 1000 ; thermo scientific ) .
the amount of each injected unfractionated biological triplicate was 150 ng. a 60 min non - linear gradient ( 5 - 20 % b in 35 min ; 20 - 35 % b in 50 min ; b = acn : water , 98:5 ) was applied at a 300 nl / min flow rate .
once the peptides were eluted and ionized , they were analyzed in the qqq - ms , operated in the srm mode , as described in [ 5 ] .
to maintain high sensitivity of the srm measurements , the selected targets were divided to three different transition lists and scheduled assays with a 5 min retention time window for each peptide was applied , resulting in a cycle time of 2.5 s and a dwell time of > 20 ms. the protein targets and the respective srm assay parameters were selected from the public dataset , available in panorama public ( https :// panoramaweb.org / labkey / vuorijoki _ et _ al _ 2015.url ) [ 5 ] .
for the quantification of six proteins ( encoded by sll0542 , sll1031 , sll1525 , slr1963 , slr2067 , slr2136 ) , a different set of 2 - 3 proteotypic peptides were selected , due to more stable signals between the replicates .
the indexed retention times ( irt - values ) for these peptides are listed in table 1 .
the data was analyzed and refined in skyline [ 6 ] and the generated msstats input file ( table 2 ) was processed with msstats 3.1.4 [ 7 ] .
a global standard normalization was used for the data with two endogenous peptides ( snldsnhiiyr and seellgaasnr ) of the probable dna - directed rna polymerase omega subunit ( ssl2982 ) .
the data was processed with msstats by using restricted scope of conclusions to the three replicates .
the experimental design was based on msstats implemented group comparison tool .
the statistical information on the expression level changes of all quantified proteins can be found from table 3 .
the entire srm data can be viewed as a skyline document in panorama public via following link : https :// panoramaweb.org / labkey / sufr .
the raw ms - data (. raw - files ) and the transition list (. csv - file ) can be accessed in the peptide atlas srm experiment library ( passel ) with an identifier pass00765 ( http :// www.peptideatlas.org / pass / pass00765 ) .

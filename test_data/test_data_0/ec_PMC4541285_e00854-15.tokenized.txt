the chrysanthemum stunt viroid ( csvd ) , a member of the genus pospiviroid with a single circular rna genome , infects many chrysanthemum species .
here , we report 25 complete genome sequences of csvd in a single chrysanthemum cultivar , revealing 20 variants .
cover - datejuly / august 2015 genome announcement viroids are the smallest pathogens , consisting of a single circular rna genome , which does not encode any protein ( 1 , 2 ) .
the chrysanthemum stunt viroid ( csvd ) is a member of the genus pospiviroid in the family pospiviroidae ( 3 , 4 ) .
a wide range of chrysanthemum species are major hosts for csvd , but csvd also infects other plant species , including ageratum , dahlia , petunia hybrida , and senecio ( 5 ) .
csvd is mechanically transmitted via grafting and flower cutting .
infection of csvd in chrysanthemum plants causes chlorotic spots and light green in the leaves as well as stunting ( 5 ) .
mostly , csvd infection does not induce visible disease symptoms in infected plants .
viroids are fast - evolving rna pathogens and display quasi - species in an infected host plant ( 6 ) .
to obtain information about quasi - species in a single chrysanthemum plant , we screened several commercial chrysanthemum cultivars for csvd infection by reverse transcription ( rt ) - pcr using csvd - specific primers ( 5 ' - aaagaaatgaggcgaagaagtc - 3 ' and 5 ' - ttctttcaaagcagcagggt - 3 '). of csvd - infected chrysanthemum cultivars identified , the " disk club " cultivar showed strong csvd infection .
to obtain information of csvd quasi - species in the disk club cultivar , we conducted rt - pcr to amplify the complete genome of csvd .
the obtained pcr products were cloned into the pgem - t - easy vector ( promega , wi , usa ) , and a total of 25 clones were subjected to sequencing .
out of the 25 complete genome sequences ( genbank accession numbers kt005803 to kt005827 ) obtained , we found 20 variants .
variant 1 , including five csvd genomes , was the dominant csvd sequence , followed by variant 2 , containing two csvd genomes .
the other 18 variants contain a single csvd genome .
next , we generated a consensus csvd genome sequence of 25 csvd genomes in the disk club cultivar .
blast search found that the consensus csvd genome sequence was highly matched to the known csvd strain sk1 ( accession number ab679193.1 ) , with 100 % sequence similarity .
after alignment of each identified variant sequence to the obtained csvd consensus genome sequence , we identified 21 single - nucleotide variations .
using complete sequences of 20 variants , a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the mega6 program ( 7 ) .
we found that 20 variants were divided into two groups containing 12 and 8 csvd genomes , respectively .
in summary , we performed csvd genome sequencing in a single chrysanthemum cultivar , revealing the presence of at least 20 variants .
in addition , we demonstrate the quasi - species nature of csvd with single - nucleotide variations in a single chrysanthemum plant .
nucleotide sequence accession numbers .
the genome sequences of the chrysanthemum stunt viroid isolate disk club have been submitted to genbank ( accession numbers kt005803 to kt005827 ) .

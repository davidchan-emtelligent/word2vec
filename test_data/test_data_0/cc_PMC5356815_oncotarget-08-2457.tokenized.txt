overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor can be found in more than 80 % of patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma and is associated with shorter survival .
in this work , we evaluated the feasibility of adding nimotuzumab to chemoradiation in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma .
twenty - three patients with clinically staged t3 - 4 or any node - positive disease were enrolled .
they were scheduled to receive one cycle of induction chemotherapy followed by intensity - modulated radiotherapy , weekly administration of nimotuzumab and concurrent chemotherapy .
results showed that all patients received a full course of radiotherapy , 19 ( 82.6 %) patients completed the scheduled neoadjuvant and concurrent chemotherapy , and 22 ( 95.7 %) patients received = 6 weeks of nimotuzumab .
during the period of concurrent chemoradiation and nimotuzumab , grade 3 - 4 toxicities occurred in 14 ( 60.9 %) patients : 8 ( 34.8 %) had grade 3 - 4 oral mucositis , 6 ( 26.1 %) had grade 3 neutropenia , and 1 ( 4.3 %) had grade 3 dermatitis .
no acne - like rash was observed. with a median follow - up of 24.1 months , the 2 - year progression - free survival and overall survival were 83.5 % and 95.0 % , respectively .
in conclusion , concurrent administration of chemoradiation and nimotuzumab was well - tolerated with good compliance .
preliminary clinical outcome data appear encouraging with favorable normal tissue toxicity results comparing with historical data of concurrent chemoradiation plus cetuximab .
nasopharyngeal carcinoma nimotuzumab chemoradiotherapy induction chemotherapy introduction concurrent chemoradiation ( ccrt ) is the standard combinational treatment modality for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( la npc ). with the addition of platinum - based concurrent chemotherapy , a significant survival benefit has been achieved compared with radiotherapy alone [ 1 , 2 ]. however , up to 30 % of patients still die of distant metastasis , while 10 % - 20 % of patients will develop local and regional recurrences [ 3 - 5 ]. the optimum sequence and combination of chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of la npc remains controversial .
newer treatment modalities , including different sequences and combinations of chemoradiotherapy are explored .
on the other hand , overexpression of egfr can be found in more than 80 % of patients with la npc [ 6 ] .
high egfr expression was associated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy resistance , and increased risks of locoregional recurrence , distant metastasis , and poor prognosis [ 7 , 8 ] .
cetuximab , the most commonly used anti - egfr antibody , has received considerable attention and achieved encouraging progress for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( hnscc ) [ 9 - 11 ] .
the schedule of ccrt with cetuximab in la npc [ 12 - 15 ] has also demonstrated promising preliminary results .
however , the incidence of acne - like rash and radiotherapy - related acute skin and mucosal toxic effects was significantly increased , thus its clinical application was greatly limited .
distinct from cetuximab , nimotuzumab is a humanized egfr monoclonal antibody with a unique safety profile [ 16 ] .
however , there is little research focusing on the use of ccrt in combination with nimotuzumab in la npc .
in the phase ii single - arm trial presented here , we adopted a combinational treatment modality of induction chemotherapy , followed by concurrent chemoradiation and nimotuzumab for the treatment of la npc ( figure 1 ) .
the main purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and treatment compliance of this treatment regimen .
here , we present the preliminary results of our study .

discussion the main objective of this phase ii study is to determine the toxic effects and compliance of adding nimotuzumab to chemoradiation in la npc .
initial results show that this combinational treatment modality is feasible , with good compliance and acceptable toxicity .
all patients received a full course of radiotherapy , 19 ( 82.6 %) patients completed the scheduled neoadjuvant and concurrent chemotherapy , and 22 ( 95.7 %) patients received >= 6 weeks of nimotuzumab .
no acne - like rash was observed .
the incidence rate of grade 3 - 4 acute toxicities from concurrent chemoradiation and nimotuzumab in our cohort was 60.9 % .
as with other studies of ccrt , radiation - induced oral mucositis was the most common acute side - effect .
in our study , grade 3 - 4 oral mucositis occurred in 36.8 % of patients who actually received ccrt + nimotuzumab .
compared with other studies of ccrt regimens , in which grade 3 - 4 oral mucositis was reported between 29 % and 52.4 % [ 5 , 17 - 19 ] , the incorporation of nimotuzumab in our cohort was well - tolerated , without aggravation of oral mucositis .
we also noted that 6 ( 26.1 %) patients suffered with grade 3 neutropenia , which was higher than that reported by a previous study [ 19 ] .
gastrointestinal side - effects , including anorexia , nausea and vomiting , were relatively mild in this study .
we attribute this to the characteristic feature of nedaplatin , a derivative of cisplatin with less gastrointestinal toxicity but greater hematologic toxicity. with the optimized local treatment by imrt , locoregional recurrence rates have been markedly reduced [ 3 - 5 ] .
in our study , no locoregional recurrence was observed .
the main cause for failure in npc is now distant metastases , especially in these with advanced disease at the primary site or regional lymph nodes .
in the present study , 65.2 % and 73.9 % of patients developed t3 - t4 and n2 - n3 disease , respectively , and 5 patients developed one or more systemic diseases .
however , our results should be regarded as preliminary because of the relatively small sample size and short follow - up. at present , concurrent chemotherapy during the course of radiotherapy should be considered the standard of care for la npc .
in addition to conventional 3 - weekly ( 100mg / m2 ) or weekly ( 30 - 40mg / m2 ) schedule of cisplatin , other concurrent agents and regimes combined with radiotherapy have been explored .
in a retrospective study by xu and colleagues [ 20 ] , the regime of paclitaxel plus nedaplatin was administered , comparable survival to those of the cisplatin - based regimens was found .
besides , considering that many patients with la npc demonstrate excessive expression of egfr , and egfr overexpression is associated with increased risks of distant metastasis and shorter survival , the strategy of egfr inhibition seems attractive and has demonstrated encouraging clinical outcomes [ 21 , 22 ] .
however , evidence from published data is still insufficient to warrant changing the standard of care from chemoradiation to egfr antagonists plus radiotherapy .
in this preliminary study , we incorporated nimotuzumab into chemoradiation , the couplet regimen of docetaxel ( 75mg / m2 ) plus nedaplatin ( 80mg / m2 ) and weekly schedule of nimotuzumab were administered as concurrent agents .
concurrent chemotherapy was administered at intervals of 4 weeks after induction chemotherapy , which almost at the 4th week of radiotherapy. and then , during the next 3 weeks of radiotherapy , weekly nimotuzumab alone was administered .
as is well - known , cetuximab ( a human - murine chimeric immunoglobulin g1 monoclonal antibody ) , is the first fda approved agent in clinic against egfr .
the schedule of cetuximab in combination with ccrt in la npc has demonstrated promising preliminary results [ 12 - 15 ] .
however , all of the studies reported an unexpectedly higher incidence of acneiform rash and grade 3 / 4 oral mucositis and dermatitis .
table 6 summarizes the observed adverse effects from these studies .
collectively , 85.8 % - 100 % of patients experienced an acneiform rash , and grade 3 / 4 rash , mucositis and dermatitis occurred in 10 % - 39.4 % , 66.7 % - 87 % and 18.2 % - 25 % of patients , respectively , which were much more common than those in our study .
we ascribe these favorable normal tissue toxicity results to the feature of nimotuzumab .
compared with cetuximab , the affinity constant of nimotuzumab is lower .
nimotuzumab requires bivalent binding for stable attachment , which means that it selectively binds cells that express moderate to high egfr levels , thus sparing normal tissues where egfr expression is low [ 16 ] .
most recently , by a retrospective analysis [ 23 ] , liu and colleagues also concluded that nimotuzumab could be safely combined with concurrent chemoradiation in the treatment of la npc .
table 6 comparision of adverse effects with previously published studies treated with ccrt + cetuximab study feng et al. ma et al. niu et al. he et al. our series number of patients 28 30 33 21 23 year 2014 2012 2013 2013 2016 all grades rash (%) 85.8 93 93.9 100 0 grade 3 / 4 rash (%) 17.9 10 39.4 19.1 0 grade 3 / 4 mucositis (%) 71.4 87 84.9 66.7 36.8 grade 3 / 4 dermatitis (%) 25 20 18.2 23.8 5.3 abbreviations : ccrt , concurrent chemoradiation the role of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy remains ambiguous .
the updated mac - npc meta - analysis confirmed that the addition of concomitant chemotherapy to radiotherapy significantly improves survival .
however , this analysis does not completely answer the question whether there is a benefit of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy in the concomitant setting [ 24 ] .
there was no evidence of overall survival benefit observed with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy .
in addition , trends seen in specific trials showed that the additional treatment of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy was poorly tolerated with increased toxic effects , and consequently , any possible benefit on survival may be offset [ 25 , 26 ] .
in our study , one cycle of induction chemotherapy was administered during the time period of imrt planning within 1 week prior to radiotherapy , with an intention of reducing tumor volume and preventing early disease progression , subsequent delivery of one cycle of concurrent chemotherapy was administered at intervals of 4 weeks after induction chemotherapy .
adjuvant chemotherapy with the same regimen of neoadjuvant setting was not mandatory but was planned for selected patients ( those with good tolerance to concurrent chemoradiation and good response to induction chemotherapy ) , with the intention of reducing treatment - related toxicities .
he and colleagues reported a similar treatment modality of chemoradiation plus cetuximab , preliminary survival data are encouraging compared with historic data [ 14 ] .
in summary , our study showed that concurrent administration of chemoradiation and nimotuzumab was well - tolerated and showed encouraging clinical activities. with a median follow - up of 24.1 months , the estimated 2 - year pfs and os were 83.5 % and 95.0 % , respectively , which appear promising in comparison with previous data [ 27 , 28 ] .
however , our results were only for a short follow - up and a small sample size .
further randomized , controlled , larger sample clinical trials are warranted .
materials and methods patients patients were eligible for enrollment if they were aged 18 years or older , with eastern cooperative oncology group ( ecog ) performance status 2 or lower , all of them had histopathologically confirmed world health organization ( who ) type ii or iii at the primary site .
all patients were staged according to the union for international cancer control ( uicc ) 2010 staging system .
patients were eligible for inclusion if their tumors showed evidence of t3 or t4 stage and any n stage , m0 or n1 - 3 stage and any t stage , m0 , as assessed by clinical examination , nasopharyngoscopy , mri scan of the nasopharynx and neck , chest computed tomography , abdominal sonography , and bone scan .
mri was recommended for local staging .
other inclusion criteria were no evidence of metastatic disease , adequate hematological , liver , and renal function .
conditions for exclusion included prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy , egfr inhibitors , other cancers , pregnancy , lactation , or clinically significant cardiopulmonary diseases .
this study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the affiliated hospital of jiangnan university .
all patients signed written informed consent before participating in the study .
treatment regimens radiotherapy intensity - modulated radiotherapy was delivered at 70gy over 33 daily fractions to the planning target volume ( ptv ) of the primary tumor and metastatic cervical lymph nodes , 60gy over 33 daily fractions to the subclinical disease around the primary tumor and upper neck , and 54gy to the lower neck and supraclavicular region in the absence of nodal involvement .
for patients with persistent lesions at the nasopharynx or regional lymph nodes at the end of imrt , a radiation boost was given ( 4 - 6gy in 2 - 3 fractions ). all patients were treated once daily , five fractions weekly .
in order to delineate the target accurately , computerized optimization was used with the help of fusion of mri and ct images in the treatment planning system .
dose constraints to the critical organs at risk ( oar ) were applied according to the radiation therapy oncology group ( rtog ) 0225 protocol .
chemotherapy and nimotuzumab therapy a flow chart depicting the drug delivery of chemotherapy and nimotuzumab is shown in figure 1 .
according to the protocol , all patients were scheduled to receive one cycle of induction chemotherapy during the time period of imrt planning within 1 week prior to radiotherapy , subsequent delivery of concurrent chemotherapy with the same regimen of neoadjuvant setting was administered at intervals of 4 weeks after induction chemotherapy .
four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy ( with the same regimen of neoadjuvant setting ) was not mandatory but was planned for selected patients ( those with good tolerance to concurrent chemoradiation and good response to induction chemotherapy ) , starting at 4 weeks after radiotherapy .
detailed inclusion criteria for adjuvant chemotherapy were eastern cooperative oncology group ( ecog ) performance status 2 or lower , nonexistence of grade 3 - 4 radiotherapy - related skin and mucosal toxic effects , and adequate haematological , liver , and renal function at 4 weeks after radiotherapy .
chemotherapy regimens : docetaxel 75mg / m2 on day 1 , nedaplatin 80mg / m2 on day 2 .
nimotuzumab was administered concomitantly with imrt at a dose of 200mg weekly , commenced from the first day of radiotherapy .
it was diluted in 250 ml saline and intravenously infused over 1 hour .
eight weeks of nimotuzumab was recommended but not mandatory .
patient evaluation and follow - up the assessment of tumor response used response evaluation criteria for solid tumors ( recist ) , which was performed 3months after the completion of radiotherapy with an mri scan of the nasopharynx and neck .
evaluation of treatment - related toxicities began from the start of protocol therapy .
patients were monitored weekly during radiotherapy and before each chemotherapy cycle , with regard to hematologic and non - hematologic adverse effects .
systemic chemotherapy toxicities were assessed by the national cancer institute common toxicity criteria ( nci ctcae , version 3.0 ) , whereas rt - related toxicities were graded according to the acute and late radiation morbidity scoring criteria of rtog .
doses were modified in response to toxicities according to predefined guidelines .
follow - up visits were at intervals of 3 months after radiotherapy for 2 years , 6 months for the next 3 years and annually thereafter .
assessments consisted of patient history , physical examination , mri scan of the nasopharynx , chest computed tomography and abdominal sonography .
histological confirmation of locoregional recurrence and distant recurrence was encouraged .
study end points and statistics the main objective of the clinic trial was to evaluate the toxic effects and compliance of the combined modality treatment .
secondary endpoints included response rate to treatment , pfs and os . os was defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of death due to any cause or the date of lastfollow - up. pfs was the time between the date of enrollment and the first occurrence of locoregional or distant recurrence or the date of last follow - up. locoregional recurrence was determined as the presence of recurrent disease at the nasopharynx and / or regional lymph nodes .
distant metastasis was defined as the presence of distant disease .
descriptive statistics [ with 95 % confi ; dence intervals ( cis ) where applicable ] were used to report the study end points and survival curve was estimated with the kaplan - meier method .

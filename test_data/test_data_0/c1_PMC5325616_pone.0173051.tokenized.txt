introduction ischemic heart disease such as myocardial infarction is one of the leading causes for death throughout the world [ 1 - 3 ] .
a hypoxic stress is the main problem in the ischemic heart disease , which induces apoptosis through the activation of caspase - cascade by a release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm [ 4,5 ] .
cell death of matured myocardial cells directly causes a fatal cardiac dysfunction [ 6 - 8 ] .
therefore , the control of the hypoxia - induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes is thought to be an important therapeutic strategy in the treatment of ischemic heart disease .
type iv collagen , a major component of the basement membrane , consists of a triple helical structure [ 9,10 ] .
canstatin , a non - collagenous fragment , is cleaved from type iv collagen alpha2 chain , an essential component of basement membrane surrounding cardiomyocytes [ 11 - 18 ] .
it is presumed that canstatin exerts anti - angiogenic and anti - tumor effects through binding its receptor , alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins , in endothelial and tumor cells [ 11 - 16 ] .
alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins are colocalized with human coxsackie - adenovirus receptor on the cardiomyocyte sarcolemma in a dilated cardiomyopathy patient [ 19 ] .
in situ hybridization revealed that intense expression of alphav integrin mrna was seen in rat cardiomyocytes [ 20 ] .
in primary adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes , alphav and beta1 , beta3 or beta5 integrins are required in periostin - induced cardiomyocyte cell - cycle reentry [ 21 ] .
it has been reported that cell surface expression of alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins is increased by hypoxia stimulation in tumor cells [ 22,23 ] .
beta3 integrin prevents oxidative stress - induced apoptosis in hl - 1 mouse cardiomyocyte cell line [ 24 ] .
it has also been reported that alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins activated the survival signaling pathway through the activation of akt [ 25 - 27 ] which was responsible for the protection against ischemia - reperfusion injury in mouse cardiomyocytes [ 28 ] .
in addition , we previously reported that canstatin inhibited isoproterenol - induced apoptosis of differentiated h9c2 cardiomyoblasts [ 29 ] .
thus , it is suggested that canstatin might be an endogenous cardioprotective factor in cardiomyocytes .
in this study , we tested the hypothesis that canstatin affects hypoxia - induced apoptosis of cardiomyoblasts through the integrins / akt pathways .
materials and methods reagents and antibodies reagent sources were as follows : recombinant mouse collagen alpha - 2 ( iv ) chain , partial ( canstatin ) ( cusabio life science , hubei , china ) , cilengitide ( adooq bioscience , irvine , ca , usa ) , ly294002 ( wako , osaka , japan ) .
antibodies sources were as follows : phospho - focal adhesion kinase ( fak ) ( ser397 ) , total - fak , alphav integrin , vinculin ( santa cruz biotechnology , santa cruz , ca , usa ) ; phospho - akt ( ser473 ) , cleaved caspase - 3 , total - akt ( cell signaling technology , beverly , ma , usa ) , total - actin ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) hypoxic conditioning h9c2 cardiomyoblasts obtained from american type culture collection ( crl - 1446 ; manassas , va , usa ) were cultured in dulbecco modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ; wako , osaka , japan ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ; invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa or hyclone / ge healthcare , little chalfont , uk ) and a mixture of 1 % penicillin - streptomycin - amphotericin b ( nacalai tesque , kyoto , japan ) .
h9c2 cells at confluence were starved with serum - free dmem and incubated in a normoxic condition ( 20 % o2 , 5 % co2 , 37degreesc ) or a hypoxic condition ( 1 % o2 , 5 % co2 , 37degreesc ) in the presence of varying drugs .
phase contrast microscopy h9c2 cardiomyoblasts were grown to confluent and stimulated with canstatin ( 10 - 250 ng / ml ) or vehicle of canstatin ( 20 mm tris , 500 mm l - arginine , 50 % glycerol , ph 8.0 for control group ) for 48 h. cell morphology was observed with a phase contrast microscope ( ckx - 31 , olympus , tokyo , japan ) .
cell counting assay living cell number was counted by a cell counting kit 8 ( cc8 ; dojindo , kumamoto , japan ) as described previously [ 30 ] .
after the stimulation with hypoxia ( 48 h ) in the presence or absence of canstatin ( 10 - 250 ng / ml ) , the cells were washed with tris - buffered saline ( tbs , ph 7.4 ) and treated with cc8 solution ( 50 mul / 1.0 ml medium ) for 1 h at 37degreesc .
the absorbance of the media at 485 nm was measured using a standard microplate reader ( tristar , berthold technology , bad wildbad , germany ) .
western blotting western blotting was performed as described previously [ 30 ] .
after the stimulation of the cells with hypoxia ( 24 - 48 h ) in the presence or absence of canstatin ( 10 - 250 ng / ml ) , cilengitide ( 1 mum ) and / or ly294002 ( 10 mum ) , total cell lysates were harvested by homogenizing the cells with triton x - 100 - based lysis buffer ( cell signaling technology ) with a protease inhibitor cocktail ( nacalai tesque ) .
protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid method ( pierce , rockfold , il , usa ) .
equal amounts of proteins ( 10 mug ) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) ( 7.5 - 14 %) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane ( pall corporation , ann arbor , mi , usa ) or polyvinylidene fluoride membrane ( atto , tokyo japan ) .
after being blocked with 0.5 % skim milk ( for total proteins ) or 3 % bovine serum albumin ( for phosphorylated proteins ) , the membranes were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4degreesc .
after incubation with secondary antibody , the chemiluminescence signal was detected by ez - ecl western blotting detection reagents ( biological industries , kibbutz beit , haemek , israel ) using the atto light capture system ( ae - 6972 ; atto co. , tokyo , japan ) .
immunocytochemical staining immunocytochemical staining was performed as described previously [ 31 ] .
twenty four hours after incubation in a normoxic condition ( 20 % o2 , 5 % co2 , 37degreesc ) or a hypoxic condition ( 1 % o2 , 5 % co2 , 37degreesc ) , the h9c2 cardiomyoblasts were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde at 4degreesc for 10 min .
then the cells were permeabilized with 0.2 % triton x - 100 ( sigma - aldrich ) at room temperature for 1 min .
the permeabilized cells were blocked with 5 % normal goat serum for 1 h and incubated with anti - alphav integrin and anti - vinculin antibody overnight at 4degreesc .
the cells were incubated with alexa 488 dye conjugated goat anti - rabbit igg at room temperature for 1 h. the images were blindly captured using truechromeii plus ( biotool , gunma , japan ) .
statistical analysis data were shown as mean +/ - standard error of the mean ( s.e.m ) .
statistical evaluations were performed by one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) followed by bonferroni 's post hoc test .
a value of p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant .
results canstatin inhibits hypoxia - induced apoptosis of h9c2 cardiomyoblasts we first confirmed that canstatin - alone treatment ( 10 - 250 ng / ml , 48 h ) had no effect on the morphology of h9c2 cardiomyoblasts under normoxia ( fig 1a , n = 3 ) .
we also confirmed that a higher concentration of canstatin ( 1 mug / ml ) under normoxia had no effect on cell viability ( data not shown , n = 6 ) .
we next examined the effects of canstatin on hypoxia - induced morphological changes in h9c2 cardiomyoblasts .
morphological changes of cell death , such as detachment of cells , were observed in hypoxia ( 48 h ) - stimulated cells , which were suppressed by canstatin ( 10 - 250 ng / ml ) in a concentration - dependent manner ( n = 7 , fig 1b ) .
we also found that hypoxia ( 48 h ) significantly decreased cell viability ( p < 0.01 vs. cont ) , which was significantly suppressed by canstatin in a concentration - dependent manner ( 10 - 250 ng / ml ) ( n = 5 , p < 0.01 vs. hypoxia , fig 1c ) .

canstatin suppresses hypoxia - induced apoptosis in h9c2 cardiomyoblasts through activating integrins it is presumed that canstatin binds alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins in endothelial and tumor cells [ 14,15 ] .
therefore , we investigated whether canstatin exerts the cytoprotective effects through the interaction with alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins by using cilengitide ( 1 mum ) , an alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin inhibitor .
canstatin significantly inhibited the hypoxia ( 48 h ) - induced decreases of cell viability , which was significantly suppressed by cilengitide ( n = 5 , p < 0.01 vs. cont , p < 0.01 vs. hypoxia , and p < 0.01 vs. hypoxia + canstatin , fig 2a and 2b ) .

canstatin enhances phosphorylation of fak and akt under hypoxia alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins are known to activate akt and subsequent survival signaling pathway [ 25 - 27 ] .
therefore , we investigated whether canstatin affects the phosphorylation of fak and akt .
canstatin - alone treatment ( 250 ng / ml , 24 h ) had no effect on the phosphorylation of fak and akt under normoxia ( fig 3a - 3d ) .
interestingly , canstatin ( 250 ng / ml , 24 h ) significantly enhanced phosphorylation of fak ( n = 6 , p < 0.01 vs. hypoxia ) and akt ( n = 4 , p < 0.01 vs. hypoxia ) under hypoxia ( fig 3a - 3d ) .
cilengitide ( 1 mum ) significantly inhibited the canstatin - induced phosphorylation of fak ( n = 6 , p < 0.01 vs. hypoxia + canstatin ) and akt ( n = 4 , p < 0.01 vs. hypoxia + canstatin ) ( fig 3a and 3b ) .
we confirmed that ly29002 ( 10 mum ) , a phosphatidylinositol - 3 kinase ( pi3k )/ akt pathway inhibitor , significantly inhibited the canstatin - induced phosphorylation of akt ( n = 4 , p < 0.01 vs. hypoxia + canstatin ) but not phosphorylation of fak ( fig 3c and 3d ) .

recruitment of alphav integrin to the focal adhesion it has been reported that hypoxia induces the recruitment of alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins to cell membrane in tumor cells [ 22,23 ] .
we finally investigated whether hypoxia stimulation causes a localization of alphav integrin to focal adhesion in h9c2 cardiomyoblasts by performing a double immunofluorescence staining of alphav integrin and vinculin , a focal adhesion marker .
co - localization of alphav integrin and vinculin was observed prominently in hypoxia ( 24 h ) - stimulated h9c2 cardiomyoblasts compared with normoxia ( n = 4 , fig 5 ) .
canstatin and / or cilengitide did not affect the hypoxia - induced recruitment of alphav integrin to focal adhesion ( data not shown , n = 4 ) .

discussion in this study , we for the first time demonstrated that canstatin has a cytoprotective effect on hypoxia - induced apoptosis in h9c2 cardiomyoblasts through the activation of alphavbeta3 and / or alphavbeta5 integrins and the phosphorylation of fak and akt .
( fig 6 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0173051.g006 fig 6 schematic model for cytoprotective effects of canstatin on hypoxia - induced apoptosis of h9c2 cardiomyoblasts .
hypoxia induces the recruitment of integrins to cell membrane and causes apoptosis through the activating caspase - 3 cascade .
canstatin inhibits the hypoxia - induced apoptosis through phosphorylation of fak and akt by activating alphavbeta3 and / or alphavbeta5 integrins in h9c2 cardiomyoblasts .
canstatin is produced by cleaving type iv collagen alpha2 chain which is ubiquitously expressed around cardiomyocytes .
to the best of our knowledge , the blood concentration of canstatin in a living body has not been clarified .
hamano et al. reported that the blood concentration of tumstatin , an alpha3 chain cleaved product of type iv collagen , is 336 +/ - 28 ng / ml in a normal mouse [ 32 ] .
thus , we thought that the physiological level of canstatin is ng / ml order and used the concentrations of canstatin ranging from 10 to 250 ng / ml in this study .
firstly , we confirmed that canstatin - alone treatment had no effect on the morphology of h9c2 cardiomyoblasts .
as with the previous report [ 33 ] , hypoxia significantly increased cleaved caspase - 3 expression and caused apoptosis in h9c2 cardiomyoblasts .
in this study , canstatin suppressed the hypoxia - induced several apoptotic features , such as morphological damages , decreases of cell viability and increased cleaved caspase - 3 expression , in a concentration - dependent manner .
we previously reported that canstatin inhibited the isoproterenol - induced apoptosis in differentiated h9c2 cells [ 29 ] , supporting the present findings that canstatin has a cytoprotective effect in cardiac cells .
while canstatin is known to exert a pro - apoptotic effect on endothelial and tumor cells [ 11 - 16 ] , it showed the opposite effects on the h9c2 cardiomyoblasts .
the reason is speculated that the concentration of canstatin used in this study is much lower than the concentration of canstatin ( 15 - 20 mug / ml ) reported to stimulate apoptosis [ 11 - 13,16 ] .
kamphaus et al. reported that 1 mug / ml canstatin can inhibit proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) , while it ( up to 40 mug / ml ) had no significant effect on the proliferation of renal carcinoma cells ( 786 - 0 ) , prostate cancer cells ( pc - 3 ) or human embryonic kidney cells ( hek 293 ) [ 11 ] .
we found that canstatin ( 1 mug / ml ) under normoxia had no effect on cell viability ( n = 6 ) .
it is thus suggested that lower concentration of canstatin might exert cytoprotective effects through the different mechanisms from endothelial cells .
the receptor for canstatin in endothelial and tumor cells was proposed as alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins [ 14,15 ] and these integrin subtypes are expressed in cardiomyocytes [ 19 - 21 ] .
therefore , we next investigated whether canstatin exerted the cytoprotective effects against hypoxia through integrins and integrin - related signal pathway in h9c2 cardiomyoblasts .
cilengitide , an alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin inhibitor , significantly suppressed the cytoprotective effect of canstatin .
it has also been reported that fak / akt pathway , which is involved in cell survival , exists downstream of alphavbeta3 / alphavbeta5 integrins [ 25 - 27 ] .
therefore , we further investigated whether canstatin activates fak / akt signaling .
while canstatin - alone treatment had no effect on the phosphorylation of fak and akt under a normoxic condition , canstatin significantly enhanced phosphorylation of fak and akt under a hypoxic condition .
in the present study , the mrna expression of alphav , beta3 and beta5 integrins was not elevated by hypoxia for 24 h ( data not shown , n = 3 ) .
it has been reported that hypoxia induced the recruitment of alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins to cell membrane in tumor cells [ 22,23 ] .
in this study , we confirmed that hypoxia enhanced the recruitment of alphav integrin to focal adhesion which was determined by a co - immunostaining with vinculin , a focal adhesion marker protein .
previous study has shown that the overexpression of alphavbeta5 integrin induced the phosphorylation of fak in human dermal myofibroblasts [ 34 ] .
the activation of integrin / fak / akt pathway was also shown to be regulated by conformational change of integrin as well as the quantity and clustering of integrin [ 35 ] .
the conformational change of integrin has been reported to be induced by inside - out signaling derived from various exogenous stimulations .
hypoxia has also been reported to convert the integrin conformation to active form in myocardial cells [ 36 ] .
thus , it is proposed that the recruitment to the focal adhesion and conformational change of integrins may be responsible for the activation of fak / akt signaling by canstatin under the hypoxic condition but not under the normoxic condition in h9c2 cardiomyoblasts .
we also showed that cilengitide significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of fak and akt .
further , ly294002 , an inhibitor of pi3k / akt pathway , significantly suppressed the cytoprotective effect of canstatin on the hypoxia - induced apoptosis .
it has been reported that akt inactivates the caspase pathway by phosphorylating pro - apoptotic proteins like bad and inhibiting the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria [ 37,38 ] .
collectively , canstatin might inhibit the hypoxia - induced caspase - dependent apoptosis pathway through the activation of fak / akt signaling via activating alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins in h9c2 cardiomyoblasts .
the integrin ligands containing arg - gly - asp ( rgd ) are shown to bind a binding pocket , an extracellular domain of integrin alpha and beta chains [ 39,40 ] .
although cilengitide has the rgd motif , recombinant canstatin used in this study does not have it. kireeva et al. reported that ccn1 , a matricellular protein , which does not have rgd sequence , adhered to huvecs via alphavbeta3 integrin and the adhesion was inhibited by arg - gly - asp - ser ( rgds ) peptides [ 41 ] .
they also indicated that the binding of rgds on alphavbeta3 integrin exerted conformational changes which caused a masking of other binding sites on the receptor for non - rgd - containing ligands [ 41 ] .
thus , cilengitide may change the conformation of alphavbeta3 and / or alphavbeta5 integrins by binding and inhibit the activation of canstatin .
canstatin has been reported to inhibit fak / pi3k / akt signaling in huvecs [ 16 ] .
in the present study , however , canstatin activated fak / akt signaling in h9c2 cardiomyoblasts .
legler et al. reported that a cyclic rgd - peptide , which binds alphavbeta3 integrin , has biphasic effects ( an antagonistic phase at high concentrations and an agonistic phase at low concentrations ) [ 42 ] .
it has also been reported that higher concentration (>= 20 mum ) of cilengitide has an anti - angiogenic , while lower concentration ( 0.2 - 20 nm ) of cilengitide enhances the growth of tumors by promoting vascular endothelial growth factor - mediated angiogenesis [ 43 ] .
it is thus suggested that lower concentration of canstatin used in the present study might exert agonistic effects on alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins .
further studies regarding the effects of higher concentration of canstatin on h9c2 cardiomyoblasts might help to clarify the discrepancy .
in conclusion , we for the first time revealed that canstatin inhibits hypoxia - induced apoptosis via fak and akt pathways through activating alphavbeta3 and / or alphavbeta5 integrins in h9c2 cardiomyoblasts ( fig 6 ) .
our findings indicate canstatin as a new drug target in ischemic heart disease due to its cardioprotective effects against hypoxic stress - induced apoptosis .

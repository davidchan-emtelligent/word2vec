microrna cluster mirn23a has previously been shown to promote myeloid development at the expense of lymphoid development in overexpression and knockout mouse models .
this polarization is observed early in hematopoietic development , with an increase in common lymphoid progenitors ( clps ) and a decrease in all myeloid progenitor subsets in adult bone marrow .
the pool size of multipotential progenitors ( mpps ) is unchanged ; however , in this report we observe by flow cytometry that polarized subsets of mpps are changed in the absence of mirn23a .
additionally , in vitro culture of mpps and sorted mpp transplants showed that these cells have decreased myeloid and increased lymphoid potential in vitro and in vivo .
we investigated the mechanism by which mirn23a regulates hematopoietic differentiation and observed that mirn23a promotes myeloid development of hematopoietic progenitors through regulation of hematopoietic transcription factors and signaling pathways .
early transcription factors that direct the commitment of mpps to clps ( ikzf1 , runx1 , satb1 , bach1 and bach2 ) are increased in the absence of mirn23a mirnas as well as factors that commit the clp to the b cell lineage ( foxo1 , ebf1 , and pax5 ) .
mirn23a appears to buffer transcription factor levels so that they do not stochastically reach a threshold level to direct differentiation .
intriguingly , mirn23a also inversely regulates the pi3 kinase ( pi3k )/ akt and bmp / smad signaling pathways .
pharmacological inhibitor studies , coupled with dominant active / dominant negative biochemical experiments , show that both signaling pathways are critical to mirn23a 's regulation of hematopoietic differentiation .
lastly , consistent with mirn23a being a physiological inhibitor of b cell development , we observed that the essential b cell transcription factor ebf1 represses expression of mirn23a .
in summary , our data demonstrates that mirn23a regulates a complex array of transcription and signaling pathways to modulate adult hematopoiesis .
author summary micrornas ( mirnas ) are small ~ 22 nucleotide long rna molecules that are involved in regulating multiple cellular processes through inhibiting the expression of target proteins .
we previously identified a gene ( mirn23a ) that codes for 3 mirnas that control the development of immune cells in the bone marrow .
the mirnas promote the development of innate immune cells , macrophages and granulocytes , while repressing the development of b cells .
here we show that mirn23a mirnas negatively affect the expression of multiple proteins that are involved in directing blood progenitor cells to become b cells .
additionally , we observed that modulation of foxo1 and smad proteins , downstream effectors of two signaling pathways ( pi3 kinase / akt and bmp / smad ) , is critical to direct immune cell development .
this is the first observation that these pathways are potentially coregulated during the commitment of blood progenitors to mature cells of the immune system .
consistent with mirn23a being a critical gene for committing progenitors to innate immune cells at the expense of b cells , we observed that a critical b cell protein represses the expression of mirn23a .
in conclusion , we demonstrate the mirn23a regulation of blood development is due to a complex regulation of both transcription factors and signaling pathways .

mirnas are ~ 22 nucleotide long rna molecules that negatively regulate gene expression post - transcriptionally by binding to the 3 ' untranslated region ( utr ) of target mrnas [ 1,2 ] .
we previously screened for mirnas regulated by the hematopoietic transcription factor pu.1 ( sfpi1 ) that could be involved in immune cell fate acquisition .
we identified the mirn23a mirna cluster as a pu.1 activated gene [ 3 ] .
the mirn23a gene is located on murine chromosome 8 and codes for 3 pre - mirnas : mir - 23a , mir - 24 - 2 , and mir - 27a .
overexpression of mirn23a in hematopoietic progenitors biases cell fate decisions towards the myeloid lineage at the expense of the lymphoid lineage both in vitro and in vivo [ 3 ] .
recently we reported that when mirn23a is deleted from mice , there is an increase in b cell development and a concomitant decrease in myelopoiesis in the bone marrow that persists in the periphery .
this differentiation bias occurs early during hematopoietic development , as an increase in common lymphoid progenitors ( clps ) is observed in mirn23a - / - bone marrow , as well as a decrease in common myeloid progenitors ( cmps ) , granulocyte / monocyte progenitors ( gmps ) and megakaryocyte / erythroid progenitors ( meps ) .
no differences in hematopoietic stem cells ( hsc ) and multipotential potential progenitors ( mpp ) were observed .
the overexpression and knockout results suggest that mirn23a mirnas promote myelopoiesis through repressing lymphopoiesis .
however , the hematopoietic targets that mirn23a regulates to drive myeloid cell development are not clear .
commitment of bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( hspcs ) to specific lineages is tightly controlled by a complex network of cell intrinsic and extrinsic cues that regulate downstream signaling cascades and transcriptional pathways. [ 4 - 7 ] the initial differentiation event towards a committed hematopoietic lineage is from the mpp into the clp or cmp .
it has recently become appreciated that the mpp pool can be sub - divided into 4 distinct mpp subpopulations that have varying polarizations towards different hematopoietic lineages [ 8 ] .
commitment to the clp from the mpp is heavily dependent on the expression of several hematopoietic transcription factors , including pu.1 ( sfpi1 ) , ikzf1 ( ikaros ) mef2c , satb1 and runx1 [ 9 - 13 ] .
commitment to the b cell lineage from the clp is dependent on b cell fate determinants e2a , ebf1 , and foxo1 [ 14 - 16 ] .
pax5 along with bach1 and bach2 , repress myeloid genes in clps and early b cell precursors to lock them into the lymphoid cell fate [ 17,18 ] .
in this study , we follow up previous overexpression and knockout experiments in an attempt to elucidate hematopoietic pathways regulated by mirn23a .
although we previously reported that mirn23a loss does not alter the pool of mpps , here we observe that it does result in changes in the polarized mpp subsets .
in vitro culture of mpps and in vivo transplants reveals that loss of mirn23a inhibits myeloid differentiation and promotes lymphoid development from the mpp pool .
gene and protein analysis from multipotential eml cell lines [ 19 ] generated from mirn23a +/+ and mirn23a - / - mice show that misregulation of ikzf1 , bach1 , satb1 , and runx1 in the absence of mirn23a contribute to an increased output of lymphoid cells .
additionally , we observed that mirn23a regulated downstream effectors of both the pi3k / akt and bmp / smad pathways , suggesting that , mirn23a agonizes pi3k / akt while simultaneously antagonizing bmp / smad signaling in order to promote myelopoiesis .
our data suggest a model where mirn23a regulates hematopoietic differentiation through buffering the expression of transcription factors and coupling the activation and repression of 2 critical signal transduction pathways .
results mirn23a regulates mpp3 / mpp4 progenitor populations to influence cell fate decisions we previously observed that overexpression of mirn23a in hematopoietic progenitor 's increased myeloid development at the expense of b cell development [ 3 ] .
similarly , analysis of immune cell populations in mirn23a - / - mice showed increased b cell development at the expense of myeloid development [ 20 ] .
analysis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell ( hspc ) populations revealed increased clps and decreased cmps in mirn23a - / - mice , while mpp populations were unchanged .
since mpp populations were unchanged in mirn23a - / - mice , this suggested that mirn23a null mpps are more biased towards the clp lineage than wildtype mpps .
it has recently become appreciated that the mpp pool consists of at least 4 distinct polarized populations , with the mpp3 being biased toward myeloid differentiation and the mpp4 being biased toward lymphoid differentiation [ 8 ] .
to examine whether these populations were altered in the bone marrow mirn23a - / - mice , we stained nucleated hematopoietic cells with the previously described markers to identify mpp1 - 4 populations ( fig 1a. ) this analysis revealed no significant difference in the total mpp pool , consistent with our previous results ( fig 1b ) .
however , when the mpp populations were compartmentalized into mpp1 - 4 populations , this surprisingly revealed a significant increase in the mpp1 and mpp3 ( myeloid - biased ) populations , and an accompanying decrease in the mpp2 and mpp4 ( lymphoid - biased ) bone marrow populations in the mirn23a - / - mice compared to wildtype ( fig 1c ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1006887.g001 fig 1 mirn23a regulates balance of mpp3 / mpp4 progenitor populations .
nucleated bone marrow was harvested from the femurs and tibias of wildtype and mirn23a - / - mice and stained for cell surface markers .
a ) multipotent progenitor populations mpp1 - mpp4 were analyzed by flow cytometry .
mpp3 represents a myeloid biased population , while mpp4 represents a lymphoid biased population .
representative plots are shown .
b ) the total mpp population was not significantly changed between wildtype and mirn23a - / - mice .
c ) mirn23a - / - mice had significantly increased mpp1 and mpp3 populations and significantly decreased mpp2 and mpp4 populations .
for all mpp analyses , n = 10 wildtype and n = 9 mirn23a - / - mice were examined .
statistical analysis was performed by unpaired students t - test .
to examine the differentiation potential of mirn23a - / - mpps , we performed in vitro differentiations .
previously we observed that culturing a pool of mirn23a - / - stem and progenitor cells ( lineage negative ) on op9s resulted in increased b lymphopoiesis with decreased myelopoiesis compared to wildtype cells .
to determine if mpps were responsible for this , we sorted 1 , 10 , or 100 mpp ( lsk cd34 +) cells onto 96 well plates coated with op9 stromal cells in the presence of il - 7 and flt3l for 8 or 20d ( fig 2a ) .
after 20d less than 5 % of the wells in which 1 mpp was sorted gave rise to enough cells to analyze , which was not enough to generate any significant conclusions .
after 8d , the 10 and 100 cell well cultures contained sufficient cells per well for analysis .
consistent with previous in vitro stromal culture of mpps , the cultures were predominantly myeloid ( cd11b +) at 8d [ 16 ] .
at 8d , the 10 cell / well mirn23a +/+ cultures consist of ~ 65 - 70 % cd11b + myeloid cells , while mirn23a - / - cultures only contain ~ 40 - 45 % cd11b + cells , suggesting that loss of mirn23a hinders or slows myeloid differentiation ( fig 2b ) .
there are no detectable b220 + cells in either culture , but the cd11b - b220 - double negative population is significantly increased in mirn23a - / - cells , further suggesting the inhibition of myeloid development from mpp ( fig 2b ) .
similar results were obtained with 100 cell / well cultures ( s1a and s1b fig ) .
at 20d , there were enough cells in the 10 cell / well culture for flow cytometric analysis ( 100 cells / well were too dense with extensive cell death at this timepoint precluding meaningful analysis ) .
after 20d , lymphoid cells were present in the cultures ( b220 +) .
individual mirn23a +/+ mpp cultures generated ~ 25 % b220 + cells , while mirn23a - / - cultures generated ~ 45 % b220 + b cells ( fig 2c ) .
these cultures have no detectable cd11b + populations .
this suggests that loss of mirn23a promotes lymphoid differentiation from the mpp pool .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1006887.g002 fig 2 mirn23a - / - mpps are functionally polarized to the lymphoid lineage .
a ) wildtype and mirn23a - / - mpps were isolated by facs and used in subsequent functional experiments .
b ) the differentiation potential of wildtype and mirn23a - / - mpps to the myeloid or lymphoid lineage was evaluated by sorting 10 mpp cells into a 96 well plate with op9 stromal cells in the presence of il - 7 and flt3l cytokines .
mirn23a - / - mpp wells show a significant increase in their b220 - cd11b - population compared to wildtype mpps after 8 days of culture .
the increase in b220 - cd11b - populations in mirn23a - / - cultures is accompanied by a significant decrease in differentiated cd11b + populations .
c ) mirn23a - / - cultures have significantly increased b cell differentiation after 20 days of culture .
the increase in b cell differentiation is accompanied by a significant decrease in b220 - cd11b - populations in mirn23a - / - cultures .
d ) cd45.2 wildtype and mirn23a - / - mpps were transplanted into lethally irradiated cd45.1 congenic recipients with cd45.1 support marrow .
contribution of mpps to the lymphoid and myeloid lineage was analyzed 4 weeks after transplant .
for transplant analysis , n = 4 wildtype and n = 4 mirn23a - / - mice were examined e ) contribution to the lymphoid lineage was significantly increased in mirn23a - / - mpps .
statistical analysis was performed by unpaired students t - test .
to investigate whether mirn23a null m5pps have increased lymphoid potential in vivo , we sorted lsk cd34 + mpps ( same gating scheme in fig 2a ) from cd45.2 mirn23a - / - mice and transplanted 2,000 mpps with 2x105 cd45.1 support marrow cells into lethally irradiated cd45.1 recipient mice .
contribution to the b cell and myeloid cell lineage was examined 4 weeks after transplant and revealed a significant increase in b220 + b cells from mirn23a - / - mpps ( fig 2d and 2e ) .
since the contribution to the lymphoid lineage was low compared to the myeloid lineage (~ 3 % vs ~ 70 % respectively in wt mice ) , decreases in the myeloid lineage were harder to observe , and although we observed a slight decrease in cd11b + myeloid cells , these changes were not statistically significant ( fig 2e ) .
to investigate whether defects in proliferation could contribute to these phenotypes , we conducted in vivo brdu experiments that revealed no difference in proliferation between wildtype and mirn23a - / - lsk cells ( s2a and s2b fig ) .
further analysis by facs for cell surface markers annexin v and 7aad revealed no differences in apoptosis ( s2c and s2d fig ) .
together , this work shows that mirn23a - / - mpps have increased lymphoid potential in vitro and in vivo compared to wildtype mpps , despite the population having an increase in myeloid - biased cells based on cell surface phenotype .
mirn23a loss results in increased lymphoid stem cell gene expression programs to elucidate the molecular mechanisms driving increased clp production from the mpp pool in mirn23a null mice , we created multipotent erythroid - myeloid - lymphoid ( eml ) cell lines from wild type and mirn23a - / - mouse bone marrow [ 19 ] .
these cells , along with being multipotent , express stem cell markers c - kit and cd34 , while not expressing any committed lineage markers , including cd11b and b220 , suggesting that they model mpps ( s3a fig ) .
consistent with our primary bone marrow cell data , differentiation of wildtype and mirn23a - / - eml cells to the myeloid lineage revealed that mirn23a - / - emls have impaired myeloid differentiation ( fig 3a ) .
conversely , differentiation of eml cells to the lymphoid lineage was enhanced in mirn23a - / - emls ( fig 3b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1006887.g003 fig 3 mirn23a regulates critical hematopoietic gene expression networks to influence cell fate decisions .
primary multipotent eml cells were generated from wildtype and mirn23a - / - mice .
eml differentiation experiments were conducted to evaluate the lymphoid and myeloid potential of these populations .
a ) mirn23a - / - emls were differentiated to the myeloid lineage using atra , as well as wehi - 3b and hm5 conditioned media .
mirn23 - / - emls show decreased myeloid differentiation compared to wildtype emls .
b ) differentiation to the lymphoid lineage was evaluated by op9 coculture with exogenously supplied il7 and flt3l .
mirn23a - / - cells have significantly increased lymphoid potential .
c ) to confirm mirn23a regulation of bach1 , lightswitch luciferase reporter assays with the bach1 3'utr were conducted in 293t cells overexpressing empty vector control ( mscv ) , the entire mir23a cluster ( mscv - mir - 23acl ) , or mir - 23a alone ( mscv - mir - 23a ) .
overexpression of mir - 23acl or mir - 23a alone results in significantly decreased expression of rlu when the bach1 3 ' utr is present d ) rna was prepared from wildtype and mirn23a - / - eml cells and analyzed by qrtpcr .
satb1 , runx1 , ikzf1 , and bach1 expression was significantly increased in mirn23a - / - cells .
e ) whole cell protein lysates were prepared from wildtype and mirn23a - / - eml cells and probed for runx1 , satb1 , ikzf1 , and bach1 expression by immunoblot .
numbers designate fold change in protein levels as determined by densitometry .
f ) rna was harvested from primary lsk cd34 + mpps from wildtype and mirn23a - / - mice .
analysis of gene expression by qrt - pcr revealed significantly increased expression of satb1 , runx1 , and bach1 .
statistical analysis was performed by unpaired students t - test .
mechanistically , development of the mpp to the clp is dependent on the presence of essential hematopoietic transcription factors .
among these critical transcription factors are runx1 , satb1 , bach1 , and ikzf1 , all of which are required for normal lymphoid development [ 9,11,17,21 ] .
runx1 and ikzf1 have been shown to be targets of mirn23a mirnas in hematopoietic cells , and satb1 was shown to be a direct target in osteosarcoma cells [ 22 - 24 ] .
direct targeting by mirn23a mirnas for each gene was validated by luciferase - utr assays .
the bach1 3'utrs contains a conserved targeting site for mir - 23a / b as predicted by the targetscan algorithm [ 25 ] .
we observe that expression of the entire mirn23a cluster or mir - 23a alone represses expression of a luciferase transcript containing the bach1 3'utr ( fig 3c ) .
to determine if mirn23a loss affected expression of these factors in multipotent eml cells , we collected rna from wildtype and mirn23a - / - eml cells and analyzed for expression of transcription factors by qrt - pcr .
this analysis revealed a significant increase in satb1 , runx1 , bach1 , and ikzf1 mrna expression in mirn23a - / - emls ( fig 3d ) .
furthermore , reintroduction of mirn23a to mirn23a - / - emls decreased expression of these critical lymphoid transcription factors ( fig 3d ) .
to validate the increase in these factors at the protein level , we collected whole cell lysates from wildtype and mirn23a null eml cells and analyzed for protein expression by immunoblot .
this analysis confirmed that bach1 , runx1 , satb1 , and ikzf1 protein levels were all increased in mirn23 - / - eml cells ( fig 3e ) .
to examine whether these critical factors were changed in vivo , we collected rna from sorted lsk cd34 + mpp populations and analyzed gene expression by qrt - pcr .
bach1 , satb1 , and runx1 expression were all significantly increased , while no change was observed in ikzf1 expression ( fig 3f ) .
taken together , these results suggest that loss of mirn23a results in increased expression of transcription factors that skew the mpp differentiation towards the clp at higher frequencies than observed in wildtype cells .
mirn23a regulates critical b lymphocyte gene expression networks to sustain commitment to the b cell lineage previously we observed that the majority of the increased clp population consists of ly6d + b cell biased progenitors ( bcps )[ 20 ] .
to further identify b cell transcription networks inhibited by mirn23a that direct commitment of the clp to the b cell lineage , we overexpressed the individual cluster mirnas in the 70z / 3 pre - b lymphoblast cell line using murine stem cell virus ( mscv ) retroviruses co - expressing gfp .
high expressing lines were generated through limiting dilution and 2 unique lines for each mirna and a control line infected with empty retrovirus were analyzed for genome wide rna expression by microarray analysis using affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays ( s1 - s3 tables ) .
examining genes differentially expressed 2 fold or more we observed that exogenous mir - 24 - 2 expression results in upregulation of myeloid cell associated genes , including lyz , ccl9 , and csf1r .
this is consistent with our previous study showing that mir - 24 alone could enhance myeloid development in vitro [ 3 ] .
to validate the upregulation of myeloid specific genes , rna was prepared from control or mirn23a cluster ( mirs - 23a , - 24 - 2 , and - 27a ) overexpressing 70z / 3 cells and gene expression was assayed by qrtpcr .
mir - 24 expression is ~ 8 fold overexpressed in these cells ( s4a fig ) .
myeloid genes ccl9 , csf1r , and lyz1 were upregulated in cells overexpressing all 3 cluster mirnas ( fig 4a ) .
we also examined expression of the transcription factors sfpi1 ( pu.1 ) and runx1 that are known to regulate these genes , but did not observe significant changes .
however we cannot rule out that activity and / or protein expression of pu.1 and runx1 is affected .
overexpression of the individual cluster mirnas demonstrated that mir - 24 alone could enhance ccl9 and csf1r expression ( s4b fig ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1006887.g004 fig 4 mirn23a regulates essential b cell promoting genes to sustain commitment to the b cell lineage .
to evaluate targets of mirn23a that could promote sustained commitment towards the b cell lineage downstream of the mpp , we overexpressed empty vector control ( mscv ) or the mirn23a cluster ( mscv - 23a27a24 ) into 70z / 3 pre - b cells and evaluated gene expression by qrt - pcr .
a ) myeloid genes ccl9 , csf1r , and lyz were significantly increased when the mirn23a cluster was overexpressed .
b ) ebf1 , pax5 , ikzf1 , and bach1 gene expression was significantly decreased in 70z / 3 cells overexpressing mirn23a cluster .
c ) rna was harvested from primary wildtype and mirn23a - / - clp populations and analyzed for lymphoid gene expression by qrt - pcr .
essential b cell promoting genes ebf1 , stat5b , and bach2 were significantly increased in mirn23a - / - cells .
statistical analysis was performed by unpaired students t - test .
the increased myeloid gene expression could potentially be due to decreased expression of essential b cell transcription factors e2a ( tcf3 ) , ebf1 and pax5 [ 16,26,27 ] .
we isolated rna from 70z / 3 mscv , or mscv - mirn23a cluster expressing cells and assayed for gene expression of e2a ( tcf3 ) , ebf1 , pax5 , and ikzf1 .
this analysis revealed significantly decreased ebf1 , pax5 , and ikzf1 expression in mirn23a expressing cells , while no change was observed in e2a expression ( fig 4b ) .
in addition , since the transcription factors bach1 was shown to repress myeloid genes in lymphoid cells , we analyzed their expression in 70z / 3 cells and observed that it is downregulated by mirn23a expression ( fig 4b ) .
in contrast to the myeloid genes examined above , the majority of the lymphoid genes were downregulated by the expression of a single mirna member of the cluster ( s4c fig ) .
to investigate whether lymphoid transcription factors were increased in primary cells lacking mirn23a , we sorted clp populations from wildtype and mirn23a - / - bone marrow and analyzed gene expression by qrt - pcr .
this analysis revealed significantly increased expression of ebf1 ( fig 4c ) .
bach1 was not observed to be affected by loss of mirn23a , however the related factor bach2 , which also represses myeloid associated genes , was overexpressed in mutant clps [ 17 ] .
to identify pathways affected by mirn23a that could promote lymphoid development , we performed a gene set enrichment analysis ( gsea )[ 28 ] with the expression data obtained from the 70z / 3 microarrays .
a heat map of a ranked list of the top 50 upregulated and downregulated genes in the mirna expressing 70z / 3 lines compared to the empty vector expressing lines is shown ( s5 fig ) .
the mirna expressing lines were enriched for genes associated with il2 / stat5 signaling pathway in control cells compared to mirna overexpressing cell lines ( s6 fig ) .
examination of gene expression in in mirn23a - / - clps showed that stat5b is upregulated in the absence of mirn23a mirnas ( fig 4c ) .
previously stat5b was shown to be critical downstream of the il7 receptor for commitment of lymphoid progenitors to the b cell lineage [ 29 ] .
mir - 24 target trib3 regulates hematopoietic gene expression networks exogenous expression of ebf1 in hematopoietic progenitors increases b - cell development and antagonizes myeloid promoting transcription factors c / ebpalpha and pu.1. [ 16 ] since ebf1 is not a validated or predicted target of the mirn23a cluster , we examined the list of mirn23a downregulated genes in 70z / overexpressing lines that have the potential of regulating ebf1 expression .
tribbles 3 ( trib3 ) was downregulated in the mir - 24 - 2 expressing 70z / 3 cells as determined by microarray analysis , and has previously been shown to be a mir - 24 - 2 target in vascular smooth muscle cells [ 30 ] .
in addition , we previously observed that forced expression of trib3 in op9 cocultures results in increased b cell development at the expense of myeloid development , consistent with the phenotype of mirn23a - / - mice .
trib3 has the potential to regulate ebf1 through negative regulation of akt [ 31 ] , which antagonizes nuclear forkhead box protein o1 ( foxo1 )[ 31 ] .
foxo1 has previously been shown to drive ebf11 expression in hematopoietic cells , which is necessary for early b - cell maturation and peripheral immune cell function [ 15,31,32 ] .
trib3 also has the potential to regulate b cell development through negative regulation of smurf1 and the bmp / smad pathway , as bmp4 promotes b cell development in ex vivo cultures [ 33 ]. through these mechanisms , we hypothesized that mirn23a regulation of trib3 could help sustain commitment to the b cell lineage ( as opposed to t cell / nk cell ) downstream of the mpp .
we validated that mir - 24 - 2 and mirn23a cluster expression in 70z / 3 cells decreases trib3 expression using qrtpcr ( fig 5a ) .
to examine if trib3 alone had the potential to regulate myeloid gene expression networks , we generated 70z / 3 plko.1 control or plko.1 - shtrib3 knockdown cells and isolated rna for qrtpcr analysis .
these cells have 4 - 5 fold knockdown of trib3 expression ( s7a fig ) .
this revealed significantly increased expression of myeloid genes lyz , ccl9 , and csf1r , similar to what was observed with mirn23a overexpression ( fig 5b ) .
examination of b cell genes in these cells revealed decreased expression of ebf1 and pax5 ( fig 5c ) .
to examine whether overexpression of trib3 could lead to decreased myeloid gene expression , we switched to the 32dcl myeloid cell line that has high levels of endogenous myeloid gene expression , making decreases in myeloid gene expression more readily observable ( s7b fig ) overexpression of trib3 in 32d myeloid cells resulted in an ~ 2 fold reduction in csf1r and ccl9 expression , while lyz did not amplify ( fig 5d ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1006887.g005 fig 5 mir - 24 target trib3 regulates hematopoietic gene expression networks .
a ) rna from 70z / 3 pre - b cells overexpressing mscv , mscv - mir - 23a27a24 , or mscv - mir24 retrovirus was analyzed by qrtpcr for expression of mir - 24 target trib3 .
b ) rna was prepared from 70z / 3 cells expressing control ( plko.1 ) or trib3 shrna knockdown ( plko.1 - shtrib3 ) vectors and analyzed by qrtpcr for myeloid specific gene expression .
myeloid genes lyz , ccl9 , and csf1r were all significantly increased in trib3 knockdown lines .
c ) b cell genes ebf1 and pax5 were significantly decreased in 70z / 3 cells with trib3 knockdown .
d ) trib3 was overexpressed in 32dcl3 cells and analyzed by qrtpcr for expression of myeloid specific genes .
myeloid genes csf1r and ccl9 were significantly decreased when trib3 is overexpressed e ) a20 cells were transduced with control ( plko.1 ) or shrna knockdown ( plko.1 - shtrib3 ) of trib3 and analyzed by qrtpcr for expression of b cell specific genes ebf1 and pax5 .
ebf1 and pax5 were significantly downregulated in shtrb3 knockdown cells f ) trib3 knockdown in a20 cells resulted in decreased foxo1 expression by immunoblot analysis .
statistical analysis was performed by unpaired students t - test .
we next wanted to confirm whether trib3 could regulate essential b cell gene expression networks in an additional cell line , so we chose the a20 b lymphoma cell line since a20 cells express high levels of endogenous ebf1 and pax5 .
a20 plko.1 - shtrib3 cells were generated and showed a ~ 3 fold decrease in trib3 expression ( s7c fig ) .
consistent with mirn23a overexpression leading to decreased b cell gene expression , knockdown of trib3 results in a > 2 - fold reduction in ebf1 and pax5 ( fig 5e ) .
to examine the effect of trib3 knockdown on foxo1 protein expression in these cells , we performed immunoblots and observed decreased expression of foxo1 in shtrib3 samples ( fig 5f ) .
together , these results suggest that mir - 24 target trib3 regulates immune cell gene expression networks that sustain lymphoid commitment while repressing myeloid development in mice .
bmp / smad and akt / foxo1 signaling is critical for mirn23a mediated immune cell regulation trib3 has previously been shown to negatively regulate smurf1 , an e3 ubiquitin ligase capable of targeting smad1 / 5 and antagonizing the bmp / smad pathway [ 34 ] .
activation of the bmp / smad pathway has previously been shown to promote b cell development in ex vivo cultures [ 33 ] .
to examine whether mirn23a expression affects smurf1 protein levels in hematopoietic cells , we performed immunoblot analysis on mirn23a +/+ and mirn23a - / - primary eml cells and observed decreased smurf1 protein in mirn23a - / - cells ( s8a fig ) .
as expected decreased smurf1 levels correlated with an increase in smad5 levels , while smad1 expression is not detectable in these cells ( s8b fig ) .
as discussed above , mirn23a also has the potential to regulate immune cell development through the akt / foxo1 pathway , which is directly targeted by trib3 .
analysis of foxo1 protein expression by immunoblot in primary eml cells revealed increased foxo1 expression in mirn23a - / - emls ( s8c fig ) .
mirn23a - / - emls also have decreased expression of active p - akt ( inactivates foxo1 through phosphorylation ) and p - foxo1 ( the inactive cytoplasmic form ) ( s8d and s8e fig ) .
to functionally test whether these pathways were critical contributors to the mirn23a knockout mouse phenotype , we isolated primary lin - cells from the bm of wildtype and mirn23a - / - mice and transduced them with pmiev empty vector ( ev ) control or smurf1 overexpressing retrovirus .
we then cocultured these cells on op9 stromal cells for 9d with il - 7 and flt3l .
these conditions promote the growth of pro - b - cells from hematopoietic progenitors under normal conditions [ 35 ]. by 9d , there is a mix of both myeloid and lymphoid cell .
culturing lin - hematopoietic cells with pmiev ev control for 9d shows that mirn23a null cells have significantly increased b cell development when compared to wildtype cells ( fig 6a and 6b ) .
however , overexpression of smurf1 in these cells results in decreased overall b cell development and negates the phenotype of increased b cells in mirn23a - / - cultures ( fig 6a and 6b ) .
additionally , directly antagonizing the bmp pathway with the ldn193189 bmp inhibitor during op9 coculture ( with no retroviral inserts ) results in decreased b - cell development and similar numbers of b220 + b cells in both wildtype and mirn23a - / - cultures , showing that inhibition of the bmp pathway abrogates the increased b cell development phenotype seen in the absence of mirn23a ( fig 6c ) .
this suggests that bmp signaling is critical for both normal lymphoid development and the enhanced lymphoid development in mirn23a - / - mice .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1006887.g006 fig 6 bmp / smad and akt / foxo1 signaling is critical for mirn23a mediated immune cell regulation .
a ) primary lineage negative wildtype and mirn23a - / - cells were transduced with empty vector control or smurf1 and plated on op9 cells with il7 and flt3l to evaluate the effect of smurf1 overexpression on b cell development .
mirn23a - / - cells show increased b cell development when transduced with empty vector control , while overexpression of smurf1 results in decreased overall b cell development in both cultures , but abrogates the increased b cell development observed in mirn23a - / - cultures .
representative plots are shown .
b ) the increased b cell development in mirn23a - / - cultures transduced with empty vector control was statistically significant , while no difference was observed in smurf1 overexpressing cultures .
c ) primary lin - hematopoietic cells from wildtype and mirn23a - / - mice were cocultured on op9 stromal cells in the presence of il - 7 , flt3l , and with or without bmp inhibitor ldn 193189 .
b cells were significantly increased in mirn23a - / - cultures with dmso vehicle control , while no difference was observed with the addition of bmp inhibitor .
d ) similar to a , primary lineage negative cells were transduced with empty vector control or a constitutively active myrakt1 .
overexpression of myrakt1 decreased b cell development and also abrogated the effect of mirn23a loss .
representative plots are shown .
e ) the increased b cell development was statistically significant in empty vector transduced cultures , while no difference was observed in myrakt1 cultures .
f ) op9 cultures were performed as described in c , except with the addition of foxo1 inhibitor as1842856 and analyzed after 9 days of culture .
b cells were significantly increased with vehicle control , while no difference was observed with foxo1 inhibitor .
statistical analysis was performed by unpaired students t - test .
to test whether akt / foxo1 signaling contributes to the mirn23a - mediated phenotypes , we overexpressed a constitutively active akt ( myrakt ) in primary lin - cells and observed b cell differentiation after 9d of op9 coculture .
in the absence of mirn23a , trib3 levels rise repressing akt activity leading to accumulation of foxo1 in the nucleus .
expressing myrakt was expected to reverse the stabilization of foxo1 in mirn23a - / - cells .
like smurf1 overexpression , this analysis revealed that overexpression of activated akt decreases b cell development and abrogates the effect of mirn23a loss on b cell development ( fig 6d and 6e ) .
we conducted similar experiments with foxo1 dominant negative ( dn )[ 36 ] overexpression , but the effect of this overexpression was almost a complete block in b cell differentiation in both wildtype and mutant cultures .
however , we performed op9 cocultures with primary cells in the presence of dmso or pharmacological foxo1 inhibitor as1842856 , which revealed that foxo1 inhibition also abrogates the increased b cell development observed in mirn23a - / - cultures ( fig 6e and 6f ) .
together , these results suggest that the bmp / smad pathway and the akt / foxo1 pathway are both critical for mirn23a 's effect on b cell development .
essential b cell transcription factors bind to the mirn23a promoter and repress activity we previously observed that mirn23a gene expression is positively regulated by the transcription factor pu.1 .
we reasoned that if mirn23a repressed b cell development , it should be a target for repression by b cell specific transcription factors .
examining encode chip - seq [ 37 ] data for binding of b cell transcription factors binding to the mirn23a locus revealed that e2a ( tcf3 ) , ebf1 , and pax5 associated with the mirn23a locus , whereas other factor such as irf4 and ikzf1 are not detected at the locus ( fig 7a ) .
additionally , a chip on chip experiment with a chromosome 19 array had identified a conserved region upstream of mirn23a that bound the e2a related transcription factor heb ( tcf12 )[ 38 ] .
to confirm binding to the mirn23a promoter , we collected chromatin from a20 cells and performed chips with pulldowns for igg ( negative control ) , ebf1 , e2a , pax5 , and ikzf1 ( additional negative control ) .
analysis by qrtpcr revealed increased binding of ebf1 and pax5 over igg control , while no differences were observed in e2a or ikzf1 binding ( fig 7b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1006887.g007 fig 7 essential b cell transcription factors bind to the mirn23a promoter and repress activity .
a ) analysis of the encode chip - seq database for b cell transcription factor binding to mirn23a gene regulatory regions showed binding of ebf1 , pax5 , pu.1 , tcf3 , and tcf12 to regulatory elements of the mirn23a gene , while other transcription factors ( such as ikzf1 and irf4 ) did not interact with the mirn23a gene .
base pair positions refer to human feb .
2009 ( grch37 / hg19 ) genome assembly .
b ) confirmation of dna - protein interactions was performed by chromatin ips in a20 cells .
ebf1 and pax5 binding to the mirn23a upstream region was significantly increased over igg control , while no difference was observed for e2a .
c ) an 888 promoter fragment from the mirn23a promoter was cloned into a luciferase reporter construct and transfected with e47 proteins scl , e47 , or e47 / scl combined .
relative luciferase activity was measured .
the same 888 bp construct was used to evaluate the effect of increasing concentrations of d ) ebf1 or e ) pax5 on the mirn23a promoter .
experiments were performed in triplicate and statistical analysis was performed by unpaired students t - test .
in addition , we examined the ability of these b cell transcription factors to regulate mirn23a regulatory regions in luciferase reporter assays .
we generated a luciferase reporter plasmid with an 888bp murine mirn23a promoter fragment cloned upstream of the luciferase gene transcription start site .
in addition to examine e2a regulation of mirn23a we isolated a conserved upstream region of mirn23a reported to bind heb and e2a , and cloned it upstream of the mirn23 promoter in the luciferase reporter plasmid .
in transient transfections , e2a protein e47 had a modest effect on activity of the luciferase reporter containing both the promoter and conserved upstream element with a reduction of ~ 20 % ( fig 7c ) .
e2a protein e47 can heterodimerize with the transcription factor scl [ 39 ] .
the two proteins are co - expressed together in early b cell progenitors where downregulation of mirn23a would be necessary [ 40 ] .
scl interacts with the corepressor eto2 , which allows it to repress gene transcription [ 41 ] .
coexpressing e47 and scl had an enhanced effect on repression of mirn23a regulation with an ~ 50 % reduction in reporter activity .
scl alone generated similar results as expression of e47 alone .
the effects of e47 / scl were rather modest so we also tested b cell factors ebf1 and pax5 .
both pax5 and ebf1 are implicated in repressing myeloid gene expression in developing b lymphocytes [ 16,27 ] .
transient transfections were performed with a reporter gene regulated by only the 888bp mirn23a reporter .
increasing amounts of ebf1 plasmid in transient transfections resulted in a graded decrease of mirn23a promoter activity ( fig 7d ) , whereas increasing pax5 plasmid had a more modest effect on activity ( fig 7e ) .
ebf1 negatively regulates mirn23a gene expression since ebf1 had the strongest effect in transient transfection , we followed up this observation by examining the effects on endogenous mirn23a expression when ebf1 levels were modified .
we knocked down ebf1 in a20 b lymphoma cells using lentiviral shrna and collected rna for analysis by qrtpcr .
a20 cells expressing shebf1 had ~ 30 % expression of control ebf1 levels ( fig 8a ) .
knockdown of ebf1 resulted in significantly increased expression of mir - 23a , mir - 24 , and mir - 27a , consistent with ebf1 negatively regulating mirn23a ( fig 8b ) .
to evaluate whether overexpression of ebf1 leads to decreased expression of mirn23a mirnas , we transiently transfected ebf1 into nih / 3t3 fibroblasts and collected rna 48hr post transfection .
overexpression of ebf1 in transfected cells was confirmed by rt - pcr ( fig 8c ) .
cells overexpressing ebf1 showed a significant decrease in mir - 23a , mir - 27a , and mir - 24 expression ( fig 8d ) .
taken together , these results show that ebf1 represses mirn23a transcription , creating a regulatory feedback loop between mirn23a and ebf1 .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1006887.g008 fig 8 ebf1 negatively regulates mirn23a gene expression .

discussion the mir - 23a mirna cluster promotes myeloid development at the expense of b cell development , as evidenced by overexpression and genetic knockout studies [ 20,42 ] .
however , the pathways targeted by mirn23a that are critical to this process were previously unknown .
in this study , we used a combination of bioinformatics , gene expression analysis , and functional primary cell studies to identify critical mirn23a targets and pathways that drive myeloid development at the expense of b cell development .
our results revealed that the mirn23a mirna cluster regulates several transcription factor genes in multipotent cells , including runx1 , satb1 , ikzf1 , and bach1 .
for these gene expression studies , we utilized multipotent eml cell lines derived from wildtype and mirn23a - / - mice , as well as primary sorted mpps .
while we observed 2 - 4 fold changes in target gene expression in the eml cell line model , this did not directly correlate with the primary mpp gene expression analysis .
increased expression of all transcription factors seen in the mutant eml cells were observed in mirn23a - / - mpps except for ikzf1 .
however , the increases though significant , were only in the range of 1.4 - 1.6 fold .
the less robust increase in gene expression observed in primary mpps is likely due to the differentiation block in eml cell lines , which allows them to accumulate levels of essential transcription factors beyond what induces differentiation in vivo .
the eml cells require strong differentiation promoting conditions , such as high levels of all trans retinoic acid for myeloid development or coculture with stromal cells with exogenously supplied cytokines for b cell development .
however , it is important to note that these experiments , along with previous overexpression and knockout experiments with these lymphoid promoting transcription factors , do not define the precise levels of expression needed to direct differentiation .
while the precise levels needed to direct differentiation have not been established , we postulate that mirn23a mirnas buffer the levels of these transcription factors in mpps within a narrow threshold to influence differentiation , which is likely less than 2 fold changes in expression .
this is based on growing evidence that modest differences in concentration of transcription factors have distinct effects on cellular differentiation , and thus , their levels of expression must be tightly controlled [ 43 ] .
this was first shown with oct - 4 in embryonic stem cells where less than a 2 - fold increase in protein would direct differentiation into primitive mesoderm and endoderm , whereas a decrease would lead to development of trophectoderm [ 44 ] .
this showed that a precise level of oct4 is required to maintain pluripotency .
we have also previously showed the importance of levels of pu.1 in gmp cells in directing differentiation into monocytes and granulocytes [ 45 ] .
additionally , b cell promoting factors bach1 / 2 , ikzf1 , and ebf1 have been shown to compete with myeloid factors to direct mpps to differentiate into b cell progenitors , demonstrating that their concentrations relative to myeloid transcription factors is critical for b cell commitment [ 16,46 - 48 ] .
lastly , satb1 is expressed in both hscs and clps and is critical for the function of both cell types [ 11,49 ] .
however , as mentioned previously , these studies do not delineate the precise level of lymphoid gene expression necessary for differentiation from multipotent progenitors .
currently , our model suggests that mirn23a mirnas are part of a mechanism that maintains levels of b cell commitment factors to allow the cells to remain multipotent .
in the absence of mirn23a , we postulate that normal fluctuations of protein levels are able to accumulate above a threshold level more often to commit mpps to clps .
previously we observed that the majority of the clp population in mirn23a - / - mice consists of b cell biased progenitors ( bcps )[ 20 ] .
this bias toward b cells appears to be occurring through mirn23a inversely regulating 2 signaling pathways : pi3k / akt and bmp / smad .
trib3 modulation is in part responsible for this effect .
trib3 is an important downstream mediator of mirn23a as we previously reported that trib3 overexpression could enhance in vitro b cell development similar to loss of mirn23a [ 20 ] .
a recent genetic knockout study of trib3 revealed no differences in myeloid vs lymphocyte composition , suggesting that trib3 effects on b cell development are likely downstream of the mpp [ 50 ] .
the b cell developmental populations , as well as b cell versus t cell cell fate decisions from the clp stage , remain unknown in trib3 - / - mice .
this data suggests , however , that mirn23a regulation of trib3 is likely critical in the clp / pro - b stage , while the initial differentiation from the mpp is dependent on transcription factors bach1 , ikzf1 , satb1 , and runx1 .
in addition , here we show that knockdown of trib3 expression has similar effect on gene expression as overexpressing the mirn23a mirnas ( fig 3 ) .
mirn23a mirna mir - 24 targets trib3 , which represses akt kinase and smurf1 e3 ubiquitinase activity [ 20,30,31,34,51 ] .
trib3 repression of smurf1 leads to increased levels of bmp regulated smads 1 and 5 in vascular smooth muscle [ 34,52 ] .
this regulation also occurs in hematopoietic cells as loss of mirn23a results in decreased levels of smurf1 and increased levels of smad1 in eml cells ( fig 4 ) .
consistent with repression of akt , we observed an increase in the downstream - regulated protein foxo1 in mutant cells .
mirn23a also regulates these pathways independent of trib3 .
the pi3k / akt pathway can be upregulated by mirn23a targeting the pathway inhibitors pten ( mir - 23 ) , and ppp2rse ( regulatory subunit of pp2a , mir - 23 )[ 53,54 ] .
mir - 27a synergizes with akt by targeting transcription factors foxo1 ( mir - 27 ) that is repressed by akt phosphorylation [ 55,56 ] .
mirn23a downregulates the bmp / smad pathway through the targeting of the common smad4 ( mir - 27a , mir - 24 ) , which is an obligate heterodimer partner for activated smad1 and 5 [ 57,58 ] .
additionally , mir - 23a has been shown to target smad5 [ 59 ] .
mirn23a 's regulation of these pathways is consistent with the promotion of myelopoiesis over b lymphopoiesis .
several lines of evidence support a role for pi3k / akt in promoting myelopoiesis .
pten deletion or expression of a dominant active akt results in a decrease in lymphoid development and enhancement of monocyte / granulocyte development in vivo [ 60,61 ] .
additionally , deletion of the akt - repressed targets foxo1 , o3 , and o4 in hscs results in increased myeloid progenitors [ 62 ] .
two studies report a role for bmp / smad signaling in the commitment of mpps to the myeloid and lymphoid lineage .
overexpression of smad7 ( inhibitory smad ) in human hematopoietic progenitors blocks b cell development and enhances monocyte / granulocyte development similar to mirn23a overexpression [ 63 ] .
secondly op9 cells support in vitro b cell growth through secretion of bmp4 [ 33 ] .
our inhibitor studies suggest that both pathways are critical to mediating the differentiation phenotype observed in mirn23a - / - mice .
absence of mirn23a results in decreased akt activity and increased foxo1 .
treatment of wildtype and mirn23a - / - cells with foxo1 inhibitor or myrakt ( phosphorylates foxo1 to reduce nuclear accumulation ) results in an ablation of the differences in b lymphopoiesis seen in op9 cultures ( fig 4 ) .
similarly , inhibiting bmp signaling with ldn193189 or smurf1 e3 ubiquitinase expression ablates the differences in lymphoid development versus myeloid development in wildtype versus mirn23a - / - cultures .
this study adds to the mounting evidence that bmp signaling is critical for early b lymphopoiesis [ 33,63 ] .
it will be important to address the molecular mechanisms regulated by smad transcription factors during adult b lymphopoiesis and examine whether foxo1 and smad1 / 5 cooperate to regulate b lineage genes .
comparing the mpp populations between wildtype and mutant mice , we were expecting that the lymphoid biased mpp4 population would be increased in the mutant bone marrow , but were surprised to observe that the myeloid biased mpp3 population was enhanced and the mpp4 population decreased in the mutants ( fig 1 ) .
however , the in vitro and in vivo functional results with pooled mpps , as well as molecular data from eml cells and primary mpps , may explain these findings .
loss of mirn23a may be increasing mpp4 polarization through increased levels of key transcription factors while simultaneously decreasing akt activity , leading to increased nuclear foxo1 accumulation , which stimulates the transcription of b cell fate determinant ebf1 .
this may be speeding up differentiation of the mmp4 to b cell biased progenitors , making the mpp4 population unstable .
similarly , higher levels of transcription factor bach1 , which inhibits myeloid genes , may be slowing down the differentiation of the mpp3 cell to the myeloid lineage , explaining their accumulation in the mutant mouse .
the accumulation of mpp3 may become more pronounced as the mouse tries to compensate for the decreased mature myeloid population .
consistent with the idea that differentiation of mpp3 is slowed down , we observed an increase in the population of cells not expressing myeloid or lymphoid markers in the op9 cultures of mirn23a - / - mpps in the early stages of these cultures when myeloid development is predominant ( fig 2 ) .
this interpretation would explain why transplanted mpps isolated from mirn23a - / - mice have increased contribution to the b lymphoid lineage compared to wildtype mpps although initially consisting of more myeloid biased mpp3s .
lastly , the importance of mirn23a in commitment of progenitors to the myeloid lineages is underscored by the negative transcriptional regulation of mirn23a by key b cell transcription factors .
if mirn23a regulates myeloid commitment through repression of b cell specific genes , one would expect that it would be repressed by b cell promoting factors .
analysis of chip - seq data from the encode project demonstrated that e2a , ebf1 , and pax5 are associated with the promoter and conserved regions of the mirn23a locus .
this was confirmed by chip assays in this report .
furthermore , transient transfection analysis demonstrated that e2a , ebf1 , and pax5 all could repress transcriptional activity with ebf1 having the most potent effect .
both overexpression and underexpression of ebf1 confirmed its ability to negatively regulate the endogenous mirn23a gene .
overall , this study shows that mirn23a regulates several complex pathways to drive immune cell fate decisions in the mouse .
in the mpp , many critical factors are targeted by all members of the mirn23a cluster .
however , sustained commitment to the lymphoid lineage appears heavily dependent on mir - 24 and its direct target trib3 .
trib3 modulates this sustained commitment by regulation of both the akt / foxo1 and bmp / smad pathways , which appear to synergistically work together to reinforce b cell commitment .
the inverse regulation by mirn23a of the pi3k / akt and bmp / smad pathways is intriguing and may be also of great importance in other developmental systems .
the mirn23a regulation of lymphoid and myeloid gene expression has potentially useful medical implications .
mirnas appear to be promising therapeutic targets based on their small size , high conservation , and ability to manipulate gene expression in a physiological range [ 64 ] .
based on its role in immune cell development , mirn23a mimics and antagonists may be used to treat disorders such as cytopenias , immune deficiencies , and hematological malignancies .
understanding the role of mirnas in hematopoiesis and their mechanism of action will be critical to manipulating mirna expression in the treatment of human disease .

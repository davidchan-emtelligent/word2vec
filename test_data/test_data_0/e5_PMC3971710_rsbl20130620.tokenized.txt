predator - prey interactions are fundamental in the evolution and structure of ecological communities .
our understanding , however , of the strategies used in pursuit and evasion remains limited .
here , we report on the hunting dynamics of the world 's fastest land animal , the cheetah , acinonyx jubatus .
using miniaturized data loggers , we recorded fine - scale movement , speed and acceleration of free - ranging cheetahs to measure how hunting dynamics relate to chasing different sized prey .
cheetahs attained hunting speeds of up to 18.94 m s - 1 and accelerated up to 7.5 m s - 2 with greatest angular velocities achieved during the terminal phase of the hunt .
the interplay between forward and lateral acceleration during chases showed that the total forces involved in speed changes and turning were approximately constant over time but varied with prey type .
thus , rather than a simple maximum speed chase , cheetahs first accelerate to decrease the distance to their prey , before reducing speed 5 - 8 s from the end of the hunt , so as to facilitate rapid turns to match prey escape tactics , varying the precise strategy according to prey species .
predator and prey thus pit a fine balance of speed against manoeuvring capability in a race for survival .

introduction the interactions between predators and prey are fundamental for the evolution and structure of ecological communities [ 1 ] .
our understanding , however , of the strategies adopted by predators and prey during pursuit and evasion remains limited .
recent advances in the miniaturization of animal - borne sensors now enable us to measure the fine - scale movements of free - ranging animals with hitherto unparalleled accuracy .
here , we use miniaturized data loggers to document hunting strategies of the cheetah acinonyx jubatus .
we report that , besides the oft - cited power costs for forward acceleration [ 2 ] , turning costs to follow ' jinking ' prey may also play a critical role in hunting strategy , necessitating speed modulation .
to our knowledge , this is the first time that fine - scale hunting strategies of any terrestrial predator have been documented ( but cf. [ 3 ] for marine predators ) .
cheetahs are morphologically [ 4,5 ] and physiologically [ 6,7 ] adapted to running , being capable of attaining speeds in excess of 28 m s - 1 [ 2,8 - 10 ] .
such high speeds should enable them to run down slower prey , with failed hunts attributed to exhaustion [ 7 ] or overheating [ 11 ] .
however , prey escape tactics can involve sudden directional changes [ 9,12,13 ] , which are more difficult to accommodate with increasing velocity [ 2 ] .
moreover , turns at higher speeds lead to greater forces on animals' limbs and muscles , particularly when turn angles are acute [ 14,15 ] , as well as higher energetic costs [ 16 ] .
thus , while the ability to hunt at high speed may enable cheetahs to outrun prey , they may not always choose to use maximum speed , especially when chasing prey that attempts evasion by sudden changes in direction .
to examine the interplay of speed and turning , we deployed gps and accelerometer loggers on six free - ranging cheetahs in kgalagadi transfrontier park , southern africa , to measure how hunt trajectory , speed and acceleration related to different prey species chased .
2. material and methods speed , position and acceleration estimates were obtained using minigps devices ( earth & ocean technologies , germany ) and accelerometer loggers ( cefas g6a , uk ) attached to drop - off collars ( sirtrack , new zealand ) .
two or three gps units and two accelerometers were deployed per animal .
gps devices , each lasting 9 - 12 h , were programmed to obtain positional fixes at 1.0 hz over consecutive days .
accelerometers recorded at 30 hz in each of the three orthogonal axes over 5.5 days .
we calculated linear acceleration as the change in speed and angular velocity , as the change in geometrically calculated angle between sequential gps fixes .
raw accelerometer data were converted to static body acceleration ( sba ) by smoothing each channel using a running mean of 2 s ; axis - specific dynamic body acceleration ( dba ) was then derived by subtracting axis - specific static acceleration from the raw data [ 17 ] .
vectorial dynamic body acceleration ( vedba ) and vectorial static body acceleration ( vesba ) were calculated as the vectorial sum of the three dba and sba axes , respectively [ 18 ] .
under conditions of constant velocity , vesba = 1.0g , whereas a departure from 1.0g ( deltas ) indicates the g - force derived from forward and sideways acceleration produced by the cheetahs during their chases , independent of gravity [ 19 ]. from newton 's law , where force = mass x acceleration , any deviation from 1.0g indicates that the ( terrestrial ) animal is exerting a force , which will vary with speed and turn radius [ 14,15 ] , with a consequent energetic cost [ 16 ] ( for a detailed description of accelerometer and gps devices , and analyses , see electronic supplementary material , s1 ) .
3. results we recorded movements using gps devices for six chases during a total logger - active period of 124 h. from visual observations , prey species comprised one large ostrich chick ( struthio camelus ) which was captured , three adult steenbok ( raphicerus campestris ) , two of which were captured , and two springbok ( antidorcas marsupialis ) which were not captured. with accelerometers , we recorded an additional 35 chases over 1375 h ; additional prey species included hare ( lepus spp. ) , common duiker ( sylvicapra grimmia ) , blue wildebeest ( connochaetes taurinus ) calf and gemsbok ( oryx gazella ) calf .
all chases were brief , with the longest run lasting 59 s and the greatest period of continuous running in excess of 13.9 m s - 1 lasting 23 s and covering 379 m. the fastest speed was 18.94 m s - 1 and the fastest ( gps - derived ) linear acceleration was 7.5 m s - 2 , while the highest ( accelerometer - derived ) vedba was 4.70g .
overall , the faster cheetahs ran , the less tortuous route they took ( f1,176 = 4.32 , p = 0.039 ; figure 1 ) with angular velocity differing in response to prey ( chi2 = 12.25 , p = 0.032 ) .
the mean of the greatest speeds attained in individual hunts was 12.90 m s - 1 , and occurred 5 s prior to the end of the chase ( figure 1 ) .
thereafter , there was a significant decrease in speed ( chi2 = 44.04 , p < 0.001 ) but a significant increase in angular velocity ( chi2 = 4.28 , p = 0.039 ) .
angular velocity differed with prey ( chi2 = 27.58 , p < 0.001 ) and , while chase speed was not related to hunt success ( chi2 = 1.15 , p = 0.284 ) , angular velocity during the last 5 s was significantly greater when hunts were successful ( chi2 = 13.44 , p < 0.001 ). by comparison , the greatest mean vedba was 1.71 +/ - 1.10g and occurred 8 s prior to the end of the chase ( figure 1 ) .
thereafter , vedba decreased significantly ( chi2 = 158.41 , p < 0.001 ) and differed with prey species ( chi2 = 40.96 , p = 0.045 ) .

error bars represent standard errors ; ( b ) speed ( km h - 1 ) against time ( s ) ( n = 6 , 1.0 hz ) across the last 15 s of cheetah chases for ostrich ( o ) , steenbok ( st1 , st2 and st3 ) and springbok ( sp1 and sp2 ) .
hunts o , st2 and st3 were successful .
the linear relationships of cumulative deltas over time were significant ( figure 2 ) , indicating that forces exerted by the cheetahs resulted in approximately constant overall ( lateral and forward ) accelerations during chases .
over all chases , cheetahs were subject to an average deltas of 0.27 +/ - 0.077g ( max 0.45g ) .
we observed significant three - way interactions between cheetah identity , hunt success and time as well as between prey species , hunt success and time on cumulative deltas ( chi2 = 1694.54 , p < 0.001 , figure 2a and chi2 = 358.29 , p < 0.001 , figure 2b ) .
these results indicate that chase behaviour is both cheetah - specific and prey - specific ( see electronic supplementary information , s2 and s3 ) .

4. discussion our results concur broadly with previous studies [ 2 ] in that , although the maximum speeds and acceleration values observed were impressive , and faster than racing greyhounds canis familiaris ( 17.61 m s - 1 ) [ 20 ] , the values observed were slower than racehorses equus ferus ( 19 m s - 1 ) [ 21 ] .
thus , the widely held belief that cheetah hunts consist of simple high - speed chases seems an oversimplification .
rather , we suggest that cheetah chases comprise two primary phases : ( i ) an initial rapid acceleration resulting in high speed to quickly catch up with prey , followed by ( ii ) a prey - specific slowing period that enables the cheetah to match turns instigated by prey as the distance between them closes .
mass - specific power of cheetahs during pursuit was recently estimated to reach 120 w kg - 1 [ 2 ] , astonishingly high compared with 30 w kg - 1 of racehorses or 60 w kg - 1 of greyhounds [ 22 ] .
however , this formulation only considered forward acceleration and speed , ignoring lateral acceleration .
in fact , wilson et al .
[ 16 ] demonstrated empirically that the lateral forces necessary for terrestrial animals to turn require considerable energy ; walking humans executing a 180degrees turn require as much energy as 5.5 m straight - line travel .
these lateral acceleration costs should be added to those derived from velocity and forward acceleration to obtain comprehensive power consumption figures .
we thus suggest that a more likely reason why high turning angles and speeds do not co - occur ([ 2 ] , figure 1 ) is at least partially power - based rather than being related to the capacity of limbs to withstand the forces generated [ 2 ] or environment conditions impeding the speeds seen in captive cheetahs running on a straight course [ 10 ] .
a similar argument might suggest why in humans [ 23 ] , as well as polo horses equus caballus [ 15 ] , maximum speed is limited by turn capability .
in general , therefore , there is a trade - off between speed versus manoeuvrability in biological systems of which predator - prey hunting dynamics is one such pertinent example .
the varying amounts of force developed by the cheetahs chasing different prey , as shown in the cumulative deltas plots ( figure 2b ) , clearly illustrate species - specific chase strategies .
if force generation is considered a major driver of power , this implies species - specific capture costs .
certainly , speed is only a part of the tactic ; the ability to change direction rapidly to catch prey , such as small antelopes and ostriches that are adept at turning quickly , is also essential [ 9,13 ] .
this critical capacity to turn , generally occurring during the final stages of the hunt , is at odds with high speeds , explaining the need for cheetahs to slow down .
indeed , this study shows that rapid turning during the final stages of the chase may be just as important and just as costly as accelerating rapidly at the beginning .
much of a cheetah 's pursuit thus appears less of a high - speed rush , and more of a carefully played out life - or - death duel between predator and prey , in which opposing qualities of speed and manoeuvrability are pitted against each other .

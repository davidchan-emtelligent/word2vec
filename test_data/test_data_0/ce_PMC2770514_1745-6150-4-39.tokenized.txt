one of the hallmarks of eukaryotic information processing is the co - existence of 3 distinct , multi - subunit rna polymerase complexes that are dedicated to the transcription of specific classes of coding or non - coding rnas .
archaea encode only one rna polymerase that resembles the eukaryotic rna polymerase ii with respect to the subunit composition .
here we identify archaeal orthologs of the eukaryotic rna polymerase iii subunit rpc34 .
genome context analysis supports a function of this archaeal protein in the transcription of non - coding rnas .
these findings suggest that functional separation of rna polymerases for protein - coding genes and non - coding rnas might predate the origin of the eukaryotes .
reviewers : this article was reviewed by andrei osterman and patrick forterre ( nominated by purificacion lopez - garcia ) findings all eukaryotes possess 3 distinct , multi - subunit rna polymerases ( rnaps ) : rna polymerase i ( transcription of 16s and 23s rrna ) , rnap ii ( transcription of protein - coding mrnas ) , and rnap iii ( transcription of 5s rrna , trna and some other small non - coding rnas ) .
plants have two additional rnaps involved in the transcription of small interfering rna [ 1 ] .
rnap iii has counterparts ( either identical or paralogous ) to all subunits of rnap i and rnap ii [ 2 ] .
in addition , rnap iii possesses the loosely bound rpc82 / rpc34 / rpc31 sub - complex .
this sub - complex is present in all eukaryotes , although rpc31 is missing in two major eukaryotic lineages ( alveolates and excavates ) [ 3 ] .
transcription initiation by rnap iii requires , among others , the tbp and tfiiib70 proteins .
tbp is shared with rnap ii , and the n - terminal region of tfiiib70 is homologous to the rnap ii factor tfiib , whereas the c - terminal region is specific for tfiiib70 .
the archaeal rnap ( arnap ) resembles rnap ii in its subunit composition [ 2 ] .
furthermore , the arnap machinery employs the transcription initiation factors tbp and tfb , which are orthologs and functional counterparts to the eukaryotic tbp and tfiib / tfiiib70 , respectively [ 4 ] .
in the rnap ii and arnap machineries , tfiib and tfb are thought to recruit the rnap directly to the transcription pre - initiation complex .
in contrast , rnap iii requires the rpc34 subunit to mediate the interaction between tfiiib70 and rnap iii [ 5 - 7 ] .
both the conserved n - terminal region and the unique c - terminal region of tfiiib70 contribute to rpc34 binding [ 6,8 ] .
given the conservation of rpc34 in all eukaryotes and its central role in the recruitment of rnap iii to the pre - initiation complex , it seems likely that rpc34 played an important role in the evolution of the rnap iii transcription system .
to address this possibility , we set out to identify potential archaeal homologs of rpc34 .
identification of archaeal homologs of rpc34 using psi - blast search [ 9 ] ( against the refseq database [ 10 ] , with default parameters ) with human rpc34 as the query ( gi : 149640989 ) , we detected a hit to a cenarchaeum symbiosum ( strain a ) protein [ gi : 118575757 with e - value = 5 x 10 - 5 ] after the first iteration .
reciprocal search starting from the cenarchaeum symbiosum sequence [ gi : 118575757 ; 244 - 362 aa ] identified the first eukaryotic rpc34 homolog [ gi : 157138209 with e - value = 4 x 10 - 10 ] after the first iteration .
all archaeal orthologs can be retrieved after the first iteration in the course of the same search ( the complete information is available in additional file 1 ) .
we identified apparent orthologs of rpc34 in all crenarchaeal and thaumarchaeal genomes as well as in several lineages of euryarchaeota but not in candidatus korarchaeum cryptofilum opf8 , the only korarchaeote sequenced so far ( additional file 1 ) .
none of these archaeal sequences are annotated as rpc34 homologs in the refseq database .
in agreement with the psi - blast results , a conserved domain database search [ 11 ] with various crenarchaeal and thaumoarchaeal sequences as queries identifies the statistically significant similarity ( e - value ~ 0.001 ) of their c - terminal domain to a profile pfam05158 , rna polymerase rpc34 subunit .
a similar result was obtained using hhpred search [ 12 ] .
for the same cenarchaeum symbiosum a query , pfam05158 ( rna polymerase rpc34 subunit ) was detected with e - value = 6.6 x 10 - 23 ; in the same hhpred search , the sequence corresponding to the structure of human rpc34 winged helix - turn - helix ( whth ) domain [ pdb : 2dk5 ] was detected with e - value = 2 x 10 - 11 .
the next most similar family of whth - domain - containing proteins was the marr family of transcriptional regulators ( pfam010470 , with e - value = 1.2 x 10 - 9 ) .
the latter observation is also consistent with the psi - blast search results of the hth region of archaeal rpc34 orthologs in which marr family sequences were identified as the closest hits .
most likely , this relationship between rpc34 and marr is the cause of the misannotation of some of the apparent archaeal orthologs of rpc34 as marr family transcriptional regulators [ e.g. gi : 18313992 ] .
thus , the n - terminal region of archaeal rpc34 orthologs contains a whth domain , whereas the c - terminal domain is a distinct zn - finger domain shared with most eukaryotic rpc34 sequences .
the multiple alignment of the eukaryotic rpc34 sequences and their archaeal orthologs reveals conservation of two regions ( figure 1 ) .
in agreement with the above observations , the first region corresponds to the n - terminal whth domain ( with all structural elements of whth , namely , three alpha - helices and two beta - strands , preserved ) whereas the second conserved region corresponds to the zn - finger domain with the unique cxxc - x ( 3 - 5 ) - c - x ( 4 - 10 ) - c signature .
there are substantial differences in the zn - finger domain architectures of the euryarchaeal domains , on the one hand , and the crenarchaeal , thaumarchaeal and eukaryotic domains , on the other hand .
in particular , the zn - finger signature cysteines are not conserved in all sequences from halobacteriales .
all eukaryotic sequences contain a structured insert between the whth and the zn - finger domains ( according to psipred [ 13 ] secondary structure prediction ) that probably represents a distinct domain .
thaumoarchaeal proteins contain an extended region of low complexity n - terminal of the whth domain .

phylogenetic analysis of the rpc34 family we constructed a phylogenetic tree from the alignment of the whth and zn - finger domains of the eukaryotic and archaeal rpc34 orthologs , using the marr family whth domain as an outgroup ( figure 2 ) .
consistent with the apparent synapomorphies in the zn - finger domain architecture ( see above ) , the phylogenetic analysis shows that eukaryotic proteins group with crenarchaeal and thaumarchaeal sequences with reliable bootstrap support , excluding all euryarchaeal sequences ( figure 2 and additional file 2 ) .
moreover , the eukaryotic lineage is rooted deeply within the crenarchaeal - thaumarchaeal subtree ( figure 2 ) , suggesting that eukaryotic rpc34 indeed originates from an ancestor that belonged to this group of archaeal proteins .
figure 2 the archaeal rpc34 orthologs - phylogenetic analysis of the rpc34 family .
the ml tree was rooted using selected representatives of the marr family as the outgroup ( archaeal members of this group are shown in blue ) .
a version of the tree with complete information for all the sequences used for tree construction and rell bootstrap values is available in additional file 2 .
analysis of neighborhood of archaeal rpc34 orthologs to gain insight into possible functions of the archaeal rpc34 orthologs , we analyzed the genomic context of the respective genes .
in thaumarchaeal and crenarchaeal genomes , the rpc34 genes co - localize and are predicted to be co - transcribed with several genes for proteins involved in modification or processing of trna and rrna ( figure 3 ) .
in the majority of crenarchaea , the rpc34 gene is also potentially co - transcribed with a gene for a tfb paralog ( cog1405 ) .
generally , archaeal genomes encode at least two tfb paralogs , so an intriguing possibility is that the crenarchaeal rpc34 ortholog interacts with a specific tfb paralog analogously to the interaction of eukaryotic rpc34 with the tfiib paralog tfiiib70 .
genes encoding the euryarchaeal rpc34 orthologs , with the exception of those from halobacteriales , are predicted to be co - transcribed with genes for sm - like protein paralogs ( cog1958 ) .
the archaeoglobus fulgidus homolog af - sm2 has been shown to co - immunoprecipitate with rnase p rna , and sm - like proteins are generally believed to form ribonucleoprotein complexes [ 14 ] .
figure 3 the archaeal rpc34 orthologs - genome context analysis of archaeal rpc34 orthologs .
bold lines indicate possible co - transcription ( intergenic region < 100 bp ) .
the genome of sulfolobus solfataricus p2 contains a gar1 homolog ( locustaq sso6830 ) , which is not annotated as a gene , upstream of sso0944 .
possible role of the archaeal rpc34 ortholog in transcription the genomic context of the archaeal rpc34 ortholog as well as the analogy with the eukaryotic rpc34 , suggest that these archaeal proteins might be involved in transcription of rrna and trna genes .
it has been shown that , in a reconstituted in vitro transcription system from sulfolobus shibatae transcription from rrna and trna promoters could be successfully initiated in the absence of the rpc34 ortholog [ 15 ] .
hence , there is no strict rpc34 requirement for recognition of these promoters and recruitment of the arnap .
nevertheless , a regulatory role of this protein in the transcription of structural rnas by arnap appears likely .
the whth motif might mediate protein - dna - interactions given that the eukaryotic rpc34 was cross - linked to dna in transcription initiation complexes [ 16 ] but , to our knowledge , rpc34 has not been reported to contribute to promoter recognition .
electron microscopy revealed the position of the rpc82 / rpc34 / rpc31 sub - complex in the core rnap iii close to the " clamp " formed by the n - terminal part of the largest subunit , c1 [ 17 ] .
the " clamp " - domain is conserved in all multi - subunit rnaps , but an rnap iii - specific region is thought to be important for rpc34 binding specificity [ 3 ] .
the archaeal rpc34 ortholog might similarly recruit arnap to the transcription pre - initiation complex via the " clamp " - domain and so enhance the transcription of structural rnas .
on the origin of eukaryotic rnap multiplicity the detection of a rpc34 ortholog in archaea suggests that the separation of rna polymerases into dedicated forms for the transcription of protein - coding genes and genes for structural rnas ( eukaryotic rnap ii and rnap iii , respectively ) might have evolved already in archaea and was inherited by eukaryotes from the " archaeal parent " .
in this scenario , the archaeal rpc34 ortholog would modulate the specificity of the single arnap , whereas in eukaryotes the specialization deepened as a result of the duplication of the genes coding for other rnap subunits and general transcription factors .
experimental analysis of the functions of the archaeal rpc34 ortholog will provide a direct test of this hypothesis .
the nature of the archaeal " parent " of eukaryotes is a wide open question [ 18,19 ] .
detailed comparison of individual functional systems allows partial reconstruction of the gene repertoire of this elusive entity. with respect to the transcription system , the present findings add to the other recent observations that reveal the existence of rnap subunits and transcription factors that are specifically shared between eukaryotes and crenarchaeota , along with either thaumarchaeota or korarchaeota [ 20 - 23 ] .
methods sequence analysis refseq database at the ncbi [ 10 ] was used for psi - blast searches .
database searches were performed using psi - blast [ 9 ] with default .
we also used the remote homology identification servers for cdd - search [ 11 ] and hh search [ 12 ] .
multiple alignments of protein sequences were constructed by using muscle program [ 24 ] , followed by a minimal manual correction on the basis of local alignments obtained using psi - blast [ 9 ] .
protein secondary structure was predicted using the psipred program [ 13 ] .
maximum likelihood ( ml ) phylogenetic trees were constructed from the alignment of archaeal rpc34 orthologs ( the positions used for reconstruction are shown in figure 1 ) , by using the molphy program [ 25 ] with the jtt substitution matrix to perform local rearrangement of an original fitch tree [ 26 ] .
the molphy program was also used to compute rell bootstrap values .

reviewers' comments reviewer 's report 1 andrei osterman , burnham institute a compact and insightful article of f. blombach et al. proposes and provides a compelling genomic evidence for a very interesting evolutionary hypothesis shedding new light on the origin of the eukaryotic transcription machinery .
based on detailed comparative analysis of sequences , domain organization and genome context , the authors predicted a role of an uncharacterized archaeal protein in the transcription of noncoding rnas , analogous to rpc34 subunit of the eukaryotic rnapiii .
in addition to important evolutionary implications , this bioinformatic analysis yielded a testable functional assignment that should and , due to this publication , most likely would soon be challenged by focused experiments .
andrei osterman reviewer 's report 2 patrick forterre , universite paris - sud / institut pasteur ( nominated by purificacion lopez - garcia , universite paris - sud ) the paper by blombach and colleagues describes the discovery , using in silico methods , of an archaeal homologue of the eukaryotic rna polymerase iii subunit rpc34 .
this is a very interesting finding , since archaea contain otherwise a single rna polymerase which harbours subunits homologous to those of eukaryal rna polymerase ii. genome context analysis suggests that the archaeal rpc34 homologue is involved in rna metabolism .
very interestingly , the authors notice that the gene encoding the archaeal rpc34 is often potentially co - transcribed with a tfb paralogue .
the authors suggest that some specialization occurs in archaea between transcription of protein coding genes and non - coding genes ( trna and / or rrna genes ) .
both type of transcription being driven by different tfb , the tfb required for the transcription of non - coding genes interacting with rpc34 .
it is known that transcription of trna or rrna genes in vitro by archaeal rna polymerase can occur in the absence of this protein .
it will be nevertheless interesting to test this hypothesis by checking the effect of this protein on such system , for example in competition experiment with different types of promoter and different tbp .
it will be also important to test the function of these proteins in vivo using the genetic systems recently developed for sulfolobus species .
the publication of this nice short paper will certainly encourage different labs to perform this kind of experiments .
on the other hand , one cannot exclude the possibility that the archaeal rpc34 and related tbp are not involved in transcription per se but play another fundamental role in archaeal rna metabolism .
interestingly , the archaeal rpc34 homologue is present in crenarchaea and thaumarchaea , but not in korarchaea and euryarchaea , the latter containing a more distantly related homologue .
this indicates that the rpc34 was present in the last common archaeal ancestor and was later on lost in euryarchaea .
the authors suggest from their data that the specialization of rna polymerase between those transcribing coding and non - coding genes might have evolved already in archaea and was inherited by eukaryotes from the " archaeal parents " .
i previously criticized this notion of archaeal parents , noticing that we do n't descend from apes .
eugene koonin correctly pointed out that i was wrong since we are apes indeed !
however , are eukaryotes archaea ?
we do n't know .
it might be that archaea are reduced proto - eukaryotes ?
in my opinion , it 's still a prejudice to consider that eukarya evolved from archaea .
i would say that the data presented in this nice paper indicate that the rpc34 protein was present in the last common ancestor of archaea and eukarya .
as an alternative to the hypothesis proposed by the authors , it could be that this ancestor contained the ancestor of rna polymerase iii and that this protein ( but not rpc34 ) was lost in archaea ( streamlining ) .
authors' response : we appreciate the constructive remarks and would like to briefly comment on only two aspects .
first , it is hard to agree that " one cannot exclude the possibility that the archaeal rpc34 and related tbp are not involved in transcription per se but play another fundamental role in archaeal rna metabolism " .
all we know about these proteins points to direct involvement in transcription , so this seems to be a safe bet. of course , our suggestion that they are involved specifically in structural rna synthesis is far more speculative .
second , about the " archaeal parent " of eukaryotes , very briefly , because this issue is far beyond the scope of the paper .
although much of it is semantics , meaningful distinctions can be made .
humans are indeed apes , the third species of chimpanzee by any legitimate criterion used in evolutionary biology. by contrast , eukaryotes are not archaea for the crucial reason that their genetic makeup is an archaeo - bacterial chimera .
this is the reason why we find it preferable to speak of the archaeal " parent " of eukaryotes rather than the archaeal ancestor .
this logic is not much affected by the exact nature of the archaeal parent - whether it was a typical archaeon or a derived one with some evolved eukaryotic features .

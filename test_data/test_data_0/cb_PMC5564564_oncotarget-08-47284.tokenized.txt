the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of l - type calcium channels ( ltccs ) on mptp - induced dopamine ( da ) neuron degeneration and iron accumulation in the substantia nigra ( sn ) of mice. by real - time pcr and western blots , we first quatified expressions of l - type cav1.2 and cav1.3 calcium channel alpha1 subunits in the sn of experimental mice treated with mptp .
we found that the expressions of cav1.2 and cav1.3 calcium channel alpha1 subunits markedly increased after mptp treatment for 2 and 3 weeks .
secondly , we observed the effects of isradipine , a ltcc antagonist , on mptp - induced da neuron degeneration and iron accumulation in the sn. our results showed that isradipine treatment prevented against mptp - induced cav1.2 and cav1.3 calcium channel alpha1 subunits up - regulation in the sn. we also found that isradipine prevented against mptp - induced da neuron depletion in the sn and partly restored the da content in the striatum .
moreover , we found that isradipine inhibited the increase of iron positive cells in the sn of the mptp - treated mice .
finally , we investigated the effects of isradipine on cellular iron accumulation in the dopaminergic mes23.5 cell line .
our studies showed that mpp + treatment accelerated iron influx in the mes23.5 cells .
treatment with bayk8644 further aggravated iron accumulation .
treatment with isradipine prevented against mpp + - induced iron influx in the mes23.5 cells .
these results suggest that up - regulation of ltccs may be responsible for the da neuron degeneration in the mptp - treated mice , the ltccs may directly contribute to iron influx into da neurons , and isradipine may suppress cellular iron accumulation and prevents neurodegeneration .
l - type calcium channel isradipine dopamine neuron iron accumulation parkinson 's disease introduction parkinson 's disease ( pd ) is one of the slowly progressing neurodegenerative disorders characterized by resting tremors , bradykinesia , and rigidity .
the pathogenesis of pd is selective loss of dopamine ( da ) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta ( snpc ) and exhaustion of dopamine in the striatum [ 1 ] .
many factors have been implicated in the pathological process of da neuron degeneration , which include but is not limited to oxidative stress , neuroinflammation , apoptosis , increased iron leave , excito - toxicity , and decreased proteasome function [ 1 - 4 ] .
increasing evidence has indicated that iron plays a key role in the pathogenesis of da neuron degeneration .
substantially increased content of iron in the pd brains was observed and demonstrated in previous studies .
this iron increase only occured in the sn but not in the ventral tagmental area ( vta ) [ 5 - 10 ] .
the exceedingly increased iron may lead to neuronal death by reacting with oxygen and produces highly reactive hydroxyl radicals .
increased iron content may damage lipids , carbohydrates , proteins and nucleic acids , thereby inducing da neuron degeneration in the sn [ 11 ] .
however , the underlying mechanisms of iron selective accumulation in the sn remain unclear .
in addition to the iron selective accumulation in the sn , growing evidence suggests that the l - type calcium channels ( ltccs ) may play an important role in the selective da neuron degeneration in the sn [ 12 - 14 ] .
the potential linkage of ltccs to pd is strengthened by epidemiological studies , which showed a decreased risk for pd in humans who were treated for hypertension with dihydropyridines ( dhps ) [ 4 , 15 , 16 ] .
l - type cav1.2 and cav1.3 calcium channels , especially the cav1.2 calcium channels are abundant in neurons [ 16 ] .
nevertheless , the ltccs are responsible for mitochondrial oxidant stress ; and increased vulnerability in the sn da neurons is largely attributable to the expression of cav1.3 calcium channels [ 17 , 18 ] .
da neurons in the sn rely on sodium channels for pacemaking at their juvenile , but rely on l - type cav1.3 calcium channels to drive autonomous pacemaking at the progress of adulthood ; whereas , da neurons in the vta rely on sodium channels for pacemaking [ 19 , 20 ] .
previous studies showed that ca2 + enter da neurons via the continuous opening of cav1.3 calcium channels during pacemaking .
this could be a reason why sn da neurons exhibit vulnerability when stressed [ 3 , 21 ] .
further support for an involvement of ltccs in the pathogenesis of pd , comes from the finding that cav1 subtype was elevated in the brain regions affected in pd , resulting in a generally higher level of cav1.3 subtype expression relative to that of the cav1.2 subtype [ 22 ] .
the increased expression and therefore , presumably increased cellular use of cav1 subtypes could lead to increased metabolic stress on neurons .
yet , to date , the dynamic variations of cav1 subtypes expression in the pathological process of pd are still unknown .
in the last few years , ltcc was reported to provide a major pathway for iron entry into cardiomyocytes [ 23 , 24 ] .
ltcc may also provide an alternative route for iron import to neuronal cells [ 25 ] .
previous study in my laboratory demonstrated that ltcc blocker nifedipine attenuated iron deposit in the sn during iron - overload condition [ 26 ] .
we proposed that ltcc might partly mediate iron selective accumulation in the sn. in the present study , we first quantified the expressions of l - type cav1.2 and cav1.3 calcium channel alpha1 subunits in the sn of experimental mice treated with mptp .
secondly , we observed the effects of isradipine , a ltcc blocker , on the mptp - induced neurotoxicity and iron accumulation in the mice .

figure 4a showed the fluorescence pictures of the whole sn. the summarized data of th positive neurons were shown in figure 4b .
compared with the controls , the th positive neurons exhibited a progressive loss in the sn in the mptp treated group .
this effect was partly restored in the isradipine treatment group (* p < 0.05 , *** p < 0.001 , compared with control ; # p < 0.05 , ### p < 0.001 , compared with mptp treatment group ; n = 5 ) .

isradipine inhibited mptp - induced iron influx in the mes23.5 cells the intracellular iron contents in mes23.5 cells were measured by fluorescence dye calcein .
fluorescence quenching indicates that extracellular iron was transported into cells .
as shown in figure 7 , there was a time - dependent intracellular fluorescence quenching with 1 mmol / l ferrous iron perfusion ( control ) , indicating the increased intracellular iron level .
when cells were treated with mpp + for 24 h , a rapid fluorescence quenching were detected ( mpp + treatment group ) .
the fluorescence quenching further accelerated when cells were perfused with 0.01 mmol / l bayk8644 compared with mpp + treatment group , indicating an further iron influx in these cells .

discussion in the present study , we found out that isradipine , the ltcc antagonist , was able to improve motor coordinate deficit , to protect against da neuron degeneration in the sn , and to resist against the decrease of da content in the striatum induced by mptp in the mice .
these findings confirm the critical role of ltccs played in the pathogenesis of da neuron degeneration .
our results for the first time clearly showed the up - regulation of cav1.2 and cav1.3 alpha1 subunits in the sn of mptp - induced pd mice .
it has been shown that l - type cav1.2 calcium channels were widely expressed in mouse brain ( about 76.5 % of cav1.2 in total l - type alpha1 subunit mrna ) [ 27 ] , meanwhile , a relatively lower expression of cav1.3 calcium channels ( 23 %) and an even lower expression of cav1.1 and cav1.4 calcium channels ( 0.5 % together ) were observed [ 27 ] .
the da neurons in the sn are inhabited by both cav1.2 and cav1.3 calcium channels alpha1 subunit isoforms .
recently , the cav1.3 calcium channel 's functions were identified , including pacemaking and making sn da neurons more vulnerable to toxins [ 21 ] .
research suggested that ca1.3 calcium channels were the cause of ca2 + overload in sn da neurons [ 19 ] .
there is also evidence shows that , disregulated calcium homeostasis is one of the major factors that implicated the pathogenesis of pd [ 4 , 7 , 22 , 28 ] .
in our acquired results , cav1.2 and cav1.3 calcium channels increased with the progression of pd. both type of channels are up - regulated in the sn. therefore , with the increase of these two channels , ca2 + concentration also increases in the cytoplasm , this proportional alteration results in a series of reactions accompanied by the ca2 + overload .
it was worth noting that the up - regulation of both channels decreased after 4 - week mptp treatment , and the expressions of both channels even returned to the control level .
this observation might be attributed to the loss of many da neurons .
more importantly , our study demonstrated the iron continuous accumulation in sn was accompanied by the progression of pd , yet isradipine reversed this phenomenon effectively in mptp - treated mice .
in mpp + - induced pd cell model , we also observed mpp + treatment was able to accelerate iron transport in mes23.5 cells .
activation of ltccs by bayk8644 further accelerated this process .
the isradipine that successfully inhibited iron influx in the cells , may indicate that iron might be transported across cell membrane via the ltccs .
all these results directed the fact that ltccs participate in iron accumulation in the sn. it is known that iron plays a key role in the development of pd [ 29 ] .
prevention of iron in the sn provides an effective method to slow down or terminate the progression of pd [ 25 ] .
however , the cause of the selectivity of the iron deposit in the sn remain unknown .
ltccs were reported to serve as a major pathway of iron entry into cardiomyocytes [ 22 , 23 ] .
iron may enter into neurons via ltccs as well [ 30 ] .
these findings suggest that ltccs may provide an alternative route for iron import into neuronal cells .
compared with previous studies , our study first demonstrated the persistent accumulation of iron in the sn progresses with pd progression , rather than suddenly appears at the final stage of pd. isradipine apparently inhibits the increase of iron level in the sn and inhibits iron influx into cells .
these results indicate that ltccs at least partly contribute to the iron accumulation in the sn. however , we still do not know , whether cav1.2 or cav1.3 calcium channels mediated iron deposit .
to date , we cannot find a dhps which selectively blocks cav1.2 or cav1.3 calcium channels .
most of the dhps , including nimodipine and nifedipine , are more effective blockers for cav1.2 than for cav1.3 calcium channels .
however , low potency dhps such as nimodipine could fail to antagonize cav1.3 against mptp on dopaminergic terminals , while cav1.3 is still involved in terminal degeneration [ 15 , 31 ] .
isradipine , one of the dhps , from earlier studies on these drugs , has a roughly 40 fold higher affinity for cav1.3 calcium channel than other dhps , and has neuroprotective effect on both mptp and 6 - ohda - induced pd models [ 11 , 32 ] .
we cannot rule out the fact that cav1.3 calcium channels mediate iron deposit , which could be responsible for pd pathogenesis .
in conclusion , our study indicates that the l - type calcium channels are associated with the development and progression of da neuron degeneration via accelerating calcium and iron accumulation .
isradipine , a calcium channel blocker , may slow down da neuron degeneration by the blockage of cav1.2 and / or cav1.3 calcium channels .

the mean fluorescence intensity of 25 - 30 single cell in four separate fields was monitored at 200 x magnification and processed with fluoview 5.0 software [ 38 ] .
data represent the means of three independent experiments .
statistical analysis the results were represented as means +/ - sem .
the data were analyzed by two - way anova followed by bonferroni post hoc comparison of the means by using graphpad 5.0 software ( graphpad software , usa ) .
p values that were less than 0.05 were considered to be significant .

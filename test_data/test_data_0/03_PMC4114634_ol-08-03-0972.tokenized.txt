radiation therapy is one of the cornerstones of modern multidisciplinary cancer treatment .
normal tissue tolerance is critical as radiation - induced side effects may compromise organ function and quality of life .
the importance of normal tissue research is reflected by the large number of scientific articles , which have been published between 2006 and 2010 .
the present study identified important areas of research as well as seminal publications .
the article citation rate is among the potential indicators of scientific impact .
highly cited articles , arbitrarily defined as those with >= 15 citations , were identified via a systematic search of the citation database , scopus .
up to 608 articles per year were published between 2006 and 2010 , however , < 10 % of publications in each year accumulated >= 15 citations .
this figure is notably low , when compared with other oncology studies .
a large variety of preclinical and clinical topics , including toxicity prediction , the dose - volume relationship and radioprotectors , accumulated >= 15 citations .
however , clinical prevention or mitigation studies were underrepresented .
the following conclusion may be drawn from the present study ; despite the improved technology that has resulted in superior dose distribution , clinical prevention or mitigation studies are critical and must receive higher priority , funding and attention .
radiotherapy radiation oncology normal tissue side effects citation research evaluation introduction due to the infiltrative nature of malignant tumors and the resulting requirement for safety margins surrounding macroscopic lesions , as well as tumor motion and set - up variations , radiation treatment inevitably influences surrounding normal tissues .
due to the potentially serious consequences of normal tissue damage , significant investigations have been directed towards improving the therapeutic index ( 1 - 4 ) .
as a result of feedback from previous studies , clinical studies regarding normal tissue ( including those concerning long - term cardiovascular disease or neurotoxicity ) were considered to be difficult to perform due to the requirement for long - term follow - up , a rigorous methodology and large patient numbers , in addition to being costly ( 5 - 7 ) .
the aim of the present study was to quantify this assumption in a systematic review of the literature by identifying the particularly influential scientific publications as well as the areas that are currently predominantly being investigated .
for various reasons , including ( although not limited to ) tenure track or probability of future funding , study groups attempt to publish their results in a way that ensures high visibility and allows for the broad adoption of the progress achieved .
the success of a publication may be defined by various factors .
the impact factor of journals is a double - edged sword , for example in publication bias exists , where negative or inconclusive studies are not reported ( 8 - 10 ) .
article download rates may provide an indication of visibility and impact ; however , this depends on the presence and the amount of fees that are charged by the publisher .
another potential measure of the quality and impact of studies is the citation rate ( 11,12 ) .
notable or practice - changing studies are likely to be cited by follow - up trials , editorials and review articles .
the citation rates of articles published between 2006 and 2010 were evaluated for the purpose of the present study .
information regarding highly cited article types may facilitate strategic decision - making and preparation of future research projects .
furthermore , identifying underrepresented research areas may initiate the improvement of resource allocation and increase the focus on these areas .
materials and methods data source , search strategy and inclusion criteria on november 7 , 2012 , a systematic search of the database , scopus ( elsevier b.v. ; www.scopus.com ) using the key words ' normal tissue ' and ' radiotherapy ' was performed .
the evolution of publication activity following the year 2000 was analyzed in order to provide a broader view of the subject .
articles , including reviews , and clinical and experimental studies , published between 2006 and 2010 were selected regardless of language and article type .
pure dosimetric studies , for example those comparing normal tissue doses with photons versus protons ( treatment planning without clinical follow - up data ) were excluded .
analysis of patterns of citation finally , patterns of citation ( using the field , ' times cited ' in the scopus citation database ) were analyzed as described in our previous study ( 13 ) .
the total number of accumulated citations was evaluated ( irrespective of their origin ) and the proportion of highly cited articles , arbitrarily defined as those with >= 25 citations , was investigated .
due to the notably low number of such articles , the cut - off was lowered to >= 15 citations .
a complete list of articles that have been cited >= 15 times may be requested from the corresponding author .
statistical analysis to estimate the longitudinal trends , the estimated annual percentage change was calculated by use of a linear regression model ( ibm spss statistics 21 , armonk , ny , usa ) .
statistical significance was assessed using the two - tailed test .
p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference .
results review of the literature between 482 and 608 articles per year were published during the five - year period that was investigated. fig. 1 presents the number of publications per year , which significantly increased between 2006 and 2010 by > 50 % ( p > 0.05 ) .
in each year < 10 % of publications accumulated >= 15 citations. fig. 1 also shows that accumulation of citations takes >= 3 - 4 years subsequent to publication .
therefore , articles published in 2009 and 2010 were less likely to have accumulated >= 15 citations .
most cited references references ( 14 - 38 ) represent the five most cited articles annually between 2006 and 2010 .
the most cited articles were published in 12 different scientific journals .
ten articles ( 40 %) were published in the international journal of radiation oncology biology and physics , and two ( 8 %) in each of the journal of clinical oncology , radiotherapy and oncology , nature reviews cancer and oncologist .
table i shows the 10 most cited articles overall .
the majority of these were reviews or radiobiological modeling studies and all but three were published prior to 2009 .
since articles that were published , for example , in 2006 are more likely to have accumulated a large number of citations than articles that were published in 2010 , the mean of the annual numbers of citations was also calculated .
for this purpose , 2012 was defined as 0.85 years ( january 1st - november 7th ) .
table ii displays the 10 articles with the most citations per year and contains articles that were published between 2006 and 2010 .
the majority of these were also reviews or radiobiological modeling studies .
discussion the aim of the current study was to identify influential and highly cited scientific publications ( thereby determining the trends in current research ) concerning the pathogenesis , epidemiology , prevention , diagnosis , and treatment of normal tissue toxicity during the five - year period between 2006 and 2010 .
it was hypothesized that large , clinical toxicity prevention or mitigation studies may complement the technical efforts towards improved dose distribution and organ sparing , and improve quality of life of irradiated cancer survivors .
however , large , clinical toxicity prevention or mitigation studies are difficult to conduct due to cost issues and competition for funding , thus , are rare and relatively underrepresented .
following arbitrary decisions regarding which database to search and what keywords to use , a systematic literature search was performed and a broad definition of normal tissue - associated publications was applied ( excluding pure treatment planning studies without clinical follow - up data ) .
the citation rate of published articles was subsequently evaluated .
articles that have accumulated a high number of citations are likely to have impressed other clinicians / scientists and , thus , may profoundly influence clinical practice or future developments in the field .
the number of studies performed has increased in the time period that was studied in the present study .
in contrast to general radiotherapy publications ( 39 ) , none of the articles regarding normal tissues achieved > 40 citations per year .
in our previous study , 15 % of all articles accumulated >= 40 citations per year and 42 % had between 20 and 39 .
most citations per year were recorded for meta - analyses and randomized phase iii trials .
notably , the lowest figures were observed for review articles , non - phase iii prospective clinical trials and retrospective clinical studies ( 39 ) .
in a recent review of glioblastoma research , the ten articles with the highest number of citations were cited >= 100 times annually ( 13 ) .
only 1.5 % of all glioblastoma articles published between 2006 and 2010 accumulated >= 100 citations , however , ~ 10 % had 25 - 99 citations .
in a previous study regarding radiosurgery for various conditions the same figure was reported ( 40 ) ; this particular study did not include articles with < 100 citations .
to the best of our knowledge , no other published citation studies have focused on normal tissue research .
the results of the present study indicate that considerable differences exist with regards to the topics mentioned above .
in addition to the absolute number of citations , the mean annual citation rate was also evaluated as the exact time course or kinetics of citation are difficult to predict , and vary with the topic and journal ( 41 ) .
the accumulation of citations of recently published articles and the reduced interest in older articles over time presents a challenge if reliable quantitative analysis is to be attempted .
the current study did not account for the date of publication in terms of whether an article was published earlier or later during a specific year .
for the purpose of this study , the selected methods were considered to be sufficient .
however , more detailed and quantitative analyses may be performed with the internet - based tools available .
it must be noted that searches using different databases or different key words may result in more or less variable citation counts ; therefore , the present results only provide a snapshot .
furthermore , self - citation is likely to influence the final citation count of sparsely cited articles , whereas its impact on highly cited articles may be less pronounced .
it was recently estimated that 6.4 % of all citations per article ( interquartile range , 2.8 - 11.3 ; mean , 8.4 ) were self - citations ( 42 ) .
the studies most vulnerable to this effect were those with a higher number of authors and small sample sizes .
the results of the present study are consistent with the theory that citation rate progressively increases several years after publication .
however , the aim of the present study was not to investigate the dynamics of citation counts .
as the majority of scientific radiation oncology journals have steadily increased in numbers of published issues and articles , and considering that each article contains a certain number of references , the increase in total publication numbers over time is expected to result in a parallel increase in citation rates .
notably , the highly cited studies were published in a large number of different scientific journals with or without high impact factors and were always in english. between 2006 and 2010 , significant progress has been achieved in the areas of genomic analyses , toxicity prediction and implementation of highly conformal radiotherapy techniques , which reduce normal tissue doses .
various articles regarding these subjects were among those with the highest numbers of citations ( 13,26,27,31,32 ) .
systematic reviews were also considered likely to achieve a high number of citations .
the large diversity of current research topics covering all clinical , pre - clinical , biological and technical aspects of the field is noteworthy .
prospective clinical research in areas including prevention and mitigation , using radioprotectors and response modifiers , was underrepresented .
this is unusual considering the major focus on radiation - induced long - term effects in breast cancer , lymphoma and brain cancer survivors ( 43 - 45 ) .
efforts to support awareness , funding and publication of normal tissue studies , in particular clinical strategies that aim to reduce toxicity and improve quality of life , may be warranted .
in conclusion , publication numbers have increased in recent years ; however , the number of highly cited articles is limited .
in addition to the dose - volume relationship and pathogenesis of normal tissue effects , the predominating research areas were genomic analyses and toxicity prediction .
for clinical practice , the development of effective prevention and mitigation strategies is required , as improvements in technology alone cannot prevent all types of radiation - induced toxicity .
radiation fields inevitably include certain amounts of normal tissue , however , current clinical studies primarily focus on cancer cells and efforts to increase their radiosensitivity .
thus , general support and funding for clinical studies focusing on normal tissues are required .

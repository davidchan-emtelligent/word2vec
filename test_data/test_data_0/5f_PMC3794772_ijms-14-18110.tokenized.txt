cutaneous wounds are often superinfected during the healing process and this leads to prolonged convalescence and discomfort .
usage of suitable wound dressings is very important for an appropriate wound care leading to a correct healing .
the aim of this study was to demonstrate the influence of a nano - coated wound dressing ( wd ) on candida albicans colonization rate and biofilm formation .
the modified wd was achieved by submerging the dressing pieces into a nanofluid composed of functionalized magnetite nanoparticles and satureja hortensis ( so ) essential oil ( eo ) .
chemical composition of the eo was established by gc - ms. the fabricated nanostructure was characterized by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) , differential thermal analysis ( dta ) and fourier transform - infrared spectroscopy ( ft - ir ) .
the analysis of the colonized surfaces using ( scanning electron microscopy ) sem revealed that c. albicans adherence and subsequent biofilm development are strongly inhibited on the surface of wound dressing fibers coated with the obtained nanofluid , comparing with regular uncoated materials .
the results were also confirmed by the assay of the viable fungal cells embedded in the biofilm .
our data demonstrate that the obtained phytonanocoating improve the resistance of wound dressing surface to c. albicans colonization , which is often an etiological cause of local infections , impairing the appropriate wound healing .
nano - modified wound dressing satureja hortensis essential oil fungal biofilm candida albicans magnetite nanoparticles iron oxide 1 .
introduction the use of modified nanostructured surfaces for the design of film - coated surfaces of solid and fiber - based materials provide a new approach to prevent or disrupt the formation of microbial biofilms [ 1 ] .
candida albicans associated wound infections are frequently associated with burns ( 28 %) [ 2 ] , and less frequently with non - surgical epithelial injuries ( 0.8 %) [ 3 ] .
a significant increase was seen in infections attributable to c. albicans in surgical site postoperative infections [ 4 ] .
one of the major complications in c. albicans wound infections is biofilm formation , since microorganisms embedded in biofilms are hundred times more resistant to antifungal compounds [ 5,6 ] , the infection being therefore difficult to eradicate [ 7,8 ] .
iron oxide based nanosized materials are of great interest for the biomedical field due to their excellent properties [ 9 ] , derived from their intrinsic magnetic nature , as well as from the enhanced physico - chemical properties , such as ultra small and controllable size , large surface area to mass ratio , high reactivity , and functionalizable structure [ 10 ] .
magnetite ( fe3o4 ) has been widely studied for biomedical applications in biological separations [ 11 ] , drug delivery and targeting [ 12 - 15 ] , magnetic resonance imaging [ 16 ] , hyperthermia [ 17 ] , cancer treatment [ 18,19 ] , stabilization of essential oils [ 20 ] , inhibition of microbial colonization [ 21 ] and ferrofluids [ 9,22 ] .
the magnetic nanoparticles as delivery nanosystems are considered effective new tools to tackle the current challenges in treating infectious diseases , by improving the therapeutic index of antimicrobial drugs , and diminishing the local and systemic side effects including cutaneous irritation , peeling , scaling and gut flora reduction [ 23 ] .
the essential oils are an interesting alternative for the antimicrobial therapy , acting by multiple mechanisms , including cell wall damages , inhibiting the cell wall or protein synthesis , or interfering with intermediary metabolisms or dna / rna synthesis / function [ 24,25 ] .
however , the therapeutic effects of the essential oils can be impaired by their high volatility , highlighting the necessity of vectoring stabilizing systems .
satureja hortensis ( sh ) is an annual , herbaceous plant belonging to the family labiatae [ 26 ] .
the main components of the essential oils of this plant are the carvacrol , thymol , p - cymene , beta - caryophyllene , linalool and other terpenoids [ 27 ] .
the essential oils isolated from various species of satureja have biological properties such as antimicrobial , antiviral , antispasmodic and antidiarrhoeal [ 28 ] .
routinely used wound dressings are essential in any wound care .
an ideal wound dressing should be completely biocompatible and skin - friendly , but also unpermissive for microbial development on the wound lesion .
we have previously reported the obtaining of modified textile wound dressings coated with functionalized magnetite nanoparticles , with improved antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties , towards both bacterial and fungal strains .
also the functionalized magnetite nanoparticles proved to act as an efficient delivery system for essential oils and some of their major components .
in this study we report the fabrication , characterization and bioevaluation of a novel wound dressing coating , containing iron oxide nanoparticles and satureja hortensis essential oil .
these modified wound dressings exhibited improved antimicrobial properties , preventing fungal colonization and biofilm development .
2. results and discussion among the promising approaches to combat biofilm infections is the generation of surface modification of devices to reduce microbial attachment and biofilm development , as well as incorporation of antimicrobial agents to prevent colonization .
the essential oils represent a promising alternative to antimicrobial substances , due to their multiple advantages , such as : an easy way of obtaining low mammalian toxicity , quick biodegradability and low probability for the development of bacterial resistance [ 29 ] .
recent studies have shown that nanoparticles can be used for the stabilization and prolonged delivery of essential oils and for the enhancement of their activity at the site of infection , thus surpassing some of the main drawbacks for conventional antimicrobial agents , which are the development of multiple drug resistance and adverse side effects .
our previous studies have demonstrated that rosmarinus officinalis essential oil - coated magnetic nanoparticles strongly inhibited the adherence ability and biofilm development of c. albicans and c. tropicalis clinical strains [ 30 ] on the catheter surface , and usnic acid - coated magnetic nanoparticles strongly inhibited the adherence ability and biofilm development of staphylococcus aureus on the coverslips surface , opening new perspectives for the design of antimicrobial and antibiofilm surfaces , based on hybrid functionalized nanostructured biomaterials [ 31 ] .
in this paper we have investigated the antifungal biofilm properties of a modified wound dressing with hybrid nano - coating based on magnetic nanoparticles and sh essential oil .
the sh essential oil isolated by microwave assisted distillation from the aerial parts of s. hortensis , was found to be a yellow liquid and the main components were presented in table 1 .
eleven components were identified in the essential oil of sh. the main constituents of the essential oil of sh are the carvacrol ( 46.9 %) , gamma - terpinene ( 38.7 %) , p - cymene ( 4.8 %) , alpha - terpinene ( 3.6 %) and myrcene ( 1.3 %) .
variation in essential oil content and composition of sh essential oils from different origins has been reported in the literature [ 32 ] .
the reported results support previous literature data [ 33 ] .
xrd pattern ( figure 1 ) show that the mnp @ 18 are well - crystalline and exhibit diffraction peaks corresponding to ( 111 ) , ( 220 ) , ( 311 ) , ( 400 ) , ( 511 ) and ( 440 ) planes of cubic crystal system .
the position and relative intensity of diffraction peaks are same with the standard data for bulk magnetite ( jcpds file no .
19 - 0629 ) which further indicates the purity of synthesized mnp @ 18 .
xrd supports the data previously reported [ 34 ] .
the tem images of the mnp @ 18 were used to determine the shape , size and uniformity of the particles .
figure 2a,b that the particles are spherical and polydispersed with an average size of 10 nm. the tga thermograms revealed continuous weight loss for c18 and sh ( figure 3 ) .
the weight losses are 23.45 % for mnp @ 18 , and 37.82 % for of mnp @ 18 - sh. the results confirmed the attachment and stabilization of the volatility of the sh essential oil on mnp @ 18 surface .
the sh essential oil content was estimated as the difference between the weight loss for the region at approximately 500 degreesc for mnp @ 18 - sh and mnp @ 18 , and it was approximately 14.37 % .
the ft - ir spectrum of modified wound dressing ( figure 4 ) showed characteristic band of iron oxide at ~ 545 cm - 1 attributed to the stretching vibration of fe - o bonds [ 35 ] and characteristic bands assigned to stretching vibration of c - h from organic coating ( c18 ) at about 2919 and 2851 cm - 1 .
recent studies have proved that the major compounds identified in the composition of sh essential oil exhibit antimicrobial properties [ 36,37 ] .
the essential oils extracted from different aerial parts of sh ( i.e. , budding , full flowering , immature fruit , and ripened fruit stages ) exhibited strong antibacterial activities against a wide range of bacterial and fungal strains ( including s. aureus , e. coli and c. albicans ) , clearly demonstrating their potential to be used in the management of microbial infections [ 38 - 41 ] .
other studies have shown that the amount of eos extracted from different air dried samples were quite similar varying from 1.8 % in case of ripened fruit stage to 2.5 % at full flowering , as well as the chemical composition , which was quite consistent , the delta - terpinene being the major compound of the eo at all developmental stages , except the ripened fruit stage when it was replaced by carvacrol [ 37 ] .
these two compounds have been also found in major percentages in the composition of the eo used in the present study .
the sh essential oils could also contribute to the development of environmentally safer alternatives to protect the spoilage of food products from pathogenic and saprophytic fungi , by inhibiting the mycelial growth of alternaria mali roberts and botrytis cinerea pers fungi , and also exhibiting a fungicidal effect against these phytopathogenic species [ 42 ] .
in our study , viable cell counts results revealed that mnp @ 18 - sh coated wd exhibited significant antimicrobial properties , disrupting fungal adherence and biofilm formation .
on the regular wd fibers , the kinetics of c. albicans biofilm registered an ascending trend from 24 h to 72 h , as revealed by the increasing number of biofilm embedded viable cells .
the biofilm formation on the nanomodified wds was impaired in its early as well as mature phases , quantified at 24 h , 48 h and 72 h ( figure 5 ) , therefore the nano - coating stabilizes and preserves the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil .
viable cell counts data were also confirmed by the microscopic examination of the biofilm architecture and development .
the scanning electron microscopy images showed that c. albicans formed yeast microcolonies embedded in an extracellular mathrix on the surface of control wds , this ability being abolished when using nanobiocoated wd surfaces colonized for 24 h , 48 h and 72 h ( figure 6 ) .
the antimicrobial activities of sh essential oil could be explained by the high content in phenolic compounds , such as thymol and carvacrol or p - cymene , whose antimicrobial effect is due to damages induced in the membrane integrity , causing changes in ph homeostasis and also in the equilibrium of inorganic ions [ 39 ] .
although p - cymene is not reported in the literature as having antimicrobial activity , it increases the antimicrobial activity of thymol or carvacrol [ 43 ] , by destabilizing the cytoplasmic membrane of microbial cell [ 44 ] .
this synergic activity of the active compounds has motivated us to use the essential oil whole extract instead of individual compounds .
the antibiofilm activity of the modified wound dressing was preserved on the entire duration of the experiment , proving that the nanoparticles acted as an efficient stabilization and long lasting release vehicle for the essential oil .

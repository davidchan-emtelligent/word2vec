abstract migratory species experience morphological and physiological changes during transitions between different life stages .
in particular , modification of sensory systems is critical for animals to adapt to new environments .
for example , to prepare for entry into seawater , salmonids undergo smoltification with dramatic changes in ultraviolet photoreceptors and polarized vision , which are important for orientation and foraging behaviours .
extraretinal organs are also involved in photoreception ; however , the ontogenetic development of extraretinal photoreceptors is not well known , especially in migratory species .
here , we investigated whether rainbow trout dermal photoreceptors , melanophores , undergo change in spectral sensitivity during smoltification and which candidate molecules may account for this ontogenetic alteration .
our results showed that , contrary to parr melanophores which are insensitive to light , smolt melanophores displayed chromatic photoresponses with the emergence of cryptochrome and melanopsin expression .
we suggest that these modifications may benefit the active foraging behaviour of smolts and enable adaptation to variable environments .
chromatophore photoreceptor opsin photoresponse pigment cell rainbow trout visual pigment introduction non - mammalian animals have multiple types of photoreceptors to detect changes in ambient light conditions allowing them to accomplish a variety of photosensory tasks , including both image - and non - image - forming processes ( peirson et al. , 2009 ) .
ontogenetic changes in photosensory systems enable organisms to adapt to their environments .
this is particularly true and critical for migratory species whose environments can vary considerably at different life stages .
salmonids have been used as model organisms to study ontogenetic changes of the visual system and polarization sensitivity of vision ( hawryshyn , 2010 ) .
in oncorhynchus mykiss , the appearance of uvs ( ultraviolet - sensitive ) cone photoreceptors leads to polarized uv visual sensitivity , which is important for plankton - foraging and orientation behaviours ( hawryshyn , 2010 ) .
on the other hand , extraretinal photoreceptors play an important role in non - visual functions .
for example , the vertebrate pineal gland , the most investigated extraretinal photosensitive organ , is important for setting biological rhythms and modulating neurotransmission during development ( shand and foster , 1999 ) .
although the expression of visual pigments in extraretinal photoreceptors and the associated photoresponses have been reported ( shand and foster , 1999 ) , little is known about ontogenetic changes of such photoreceptors in peripheral tissues of migratory species .
chromatophores are specialized dermal photosensitive pigment cells and are responsible for teleost pigmentation and color patterns .
based on their internal structure and pigments , chromatophores can be categorized into two major cell types with characteristics of light absorption ( melanophores , erythrophores , xanthophores , and cyanophores ) or light reflection ( leucophores and iridophores ) ( fujii , 1993 ) .
teleosts can tune their coloration using two processes : long - term morphological color change through the adjustment of cell size or number , and short - term physiological color change via the movement of internal elements ( fujii , 1993 ) .
in addition to hormones , light can trigger rapid color change through the movement of pigment granules or crystal plates .
although ontogenetic changes of the visual system have been well - studied in different salmonids , how extraretinal photosensory systems of migratory species develop at different life stages remains poorly understood .
in the dermal photosensory system of rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss , we hypothesize that melanophore photosensitivity differs before and after smoltification , which is a period of dramatic change taking place in the visual system .
to test our hypothesis , we investigated photoresponses of melanophores in parrs and smolts .
we also examined the expression of candidate photopigments which could be involved in the photosensitivity of melanophores .
melanophore photosensitivity and photopigment expression in integumentary tissues differ in parrs and smolts , suggesting that the dermal photosensory system is important for adaptation to changes in the photic environment associated with migration .
for the first time , our work demonstrates ontogenetic change of chromatophore photoresponses in migratory species , particularly with the possible involvement of two non - visual pigments in the extraretinal photosensory system .
furthermore , the rainbow trout melanophore is the second type of chromatophore with a chromatically - dependent antagonistic photosensitive mechanism besides the erythrophores of tilapia ( oreochromis niloticus ) ( chen et al. , 2013 ) .
results and discussion many salmonids undergo morphological and physiological changes during ontogeny .
in particular , smoltification accomplishes the transformation from the parr that is essential for an anadromous species prior to its seaward migration .
modulation of sensory systems is critical for adaptation to distinct habitats at different life stages .
chromatophores are the primary agents contributing to body coloration and mediating body coloration changes in response to light .
therefore , any morphological or physiological change of chromatophores , such as cell numbers or the ability to translocate pigment granules , will lead to the modifications of body patterns and pigmentations .
in the present study , we aimed at understanding how the dermal photosensory system of migratory species develops at different life stages .
first , we investigated ontogenetic changes of melanophore distributions in parrs and smolts of rainbow trout ( oncorhynchus mykiss ) .
we found that the patterns of melanophore distribution in caudal fin tissues of parrs and smolts were different .
in parrs , most melanophores were restricted to the regions near fin rays ( fig. 1a ) .
during smoltification , melanophores increased in number and extended their distribution to the region between fin rays .
thus , smolts had darker caudal fins with more melanophores , notably in the area between fin rays ( fig. 1b,c ) .
eventually , the development of melanophores leads to morphological color change of o. mykiss. fig. 1. pigmentation and melanophore counts of rainbow trout parr and smolt caudal fins .
pigmentation of ( a ) parr and ( b ) smolt .
in close - ups of the caudal fins on the right of the images , note that in smolts the number of melanophores increased and more melanophores were present in the area between fin rays .
( c ) the number of melanophores in the area between fin rays increased in smolt ( n = 11 for each group ; also see supplementary material table s1 ) .
scale bars : 2 cm. subsequently , we examined if melanophore photoresponses undergo ontogenetic change during smoltification .
under illumination , parr melanophores did not show obvious photoresponse regardless of wavelengths ( n = 16 ; supplementary material fig. s1 ) ; conversely , light triggered smolt melanophores to aggregate or disperse their pigment granules , melanosomes ( fig. 2a,b ) .
smolt melanophores showed photoresponses in a wavelength - dependent manner .
aggregations occurred in the uv ( 380 - 400 nm ) region and dispersions at 420 - 600 nm ( n = 8 ; fig. 2c ) .
furthermore , the spectral sensitivity curve showed two response peaks at 380 and 480 nm ( fig. 2c ) , suggesting that two light - sensitive molecules could be involved in the photoresponses : one photopigment being responsible for aggregation in the uv and short wavelengths and the other for dispersion in the middle and long wavelengths .
this biphasic photosensitivity of rainbow trout melanophores is similar to the spectral characteristics of many extraretinal photoreceptors showing sensitivity to short - and middle - wavelength regions ( shand and foster , 1999 ). fig. 2. spectral sensitivity of smolt melanophores and candidate photopigments involved in melanophore photosensitive processes .
( a,b ) incident light triggered a smolt melanophore to aggregate or disperse inner pigment granules ( melanosomes ) : ( a ) aggregation at 380 nm ; ( b ) dispersion at 480 nm .
( c ) melanophores responded to light in a wavelength - dependent manner .
aggregations occurred with uv and short wavelength illumination and dispersions with middle and long wavelength illumination .
( d ) western blot analysis of photopigment proteins of the integumentary tissues of parrs and smolts .
proteins extracted from caudal fins of parrs and smolts were subjected to western blot analysis .
blots were probed with antibodies against uvs , cry , opn4 , and actin which served as a loading standard .
after incubation with nbt / bcip , uvs , cry , and opn4 , and actin were detected at their expected sizes ( in kda ) : uvs = ~ 40 ; cry = ~ 66 ; opn4 = ~ 63 ; actin = ~ 42 .
scale bars : 50 microm .
chromatophore photoresponses are associated with photopigment expression ( ban et al. , 2005 ) .
in the spectral sensitivity curve of rainbow trout melanophores , we found distinct sensitivity peaks at 380 and 480 nm. in rainbow trout , opsins expressed in rods ( rh1 ) and four classes of cones ( uvs , sws , mws , and lws ) and their peak sensitivities ( lambdamax ) have been identified using different approaches : rods ( rh1 : 504 nm ) ; uvs ( sws1 : 373 nm ) , sws ( sws2 : 423 nm ) , mws ( rh2b : 500 nm ; rh2a : 542 nm ) , and lws ( lws : 585 nm ) cones ( anderson et al. , 2010 ; hawryshyn et al. , 2001 ) .
in addition to these retinal visual pigments , the possible involvement of novel light - sensitive molecules for non - visual functions in a variety of extraretinal photoreceptors cannot be excluded .
for example , cryptochromes ( cry ) are sensitive to short wavelengths , and melanopsin ( opn4 ) and vertebrate ancient ( va ) opsins possess lambdamax close to 480 nm , with a spectrum ranging from 460 to 500 nm ( peirson et al. , 2009 ) .
the sensitivity peak we found in the uv region makes uvs and cryptochrome the candidate photopigments responsible for aggregations .
on the other hand , because a variable vitamin a1 / a2 chromophore ratio can lead to spectral tuning of the peak absorbance of visual pigments ( hawryshyn et al. , 2001 ) , opsins like rh1 , rh2b , opn4 , and va , with peak absorption near 480 nm may be the opsin responsible for dispersions .
in order to determine which photopigments could be involved in melanophore photoresponses , antibodies against three retinal opsins and one cryptochrome ( uv - / short wavelength - sensitive uvs opsin and cryptochrome for aggregation , and middle wavelength - sensitive rhodopsin [ rh1 ] and melanopsin for dispersion ) were used in western blot analyses .
we did not detect rh1expression in the integumentary tissues of parrs and smolts ( data not shown ) .
uvs was expressed at both stages though the expression level showed no obvious change associated with smoltification ( fig. 2d ) .
instead , the immunosignals of cry and opn4 were detected only at the smolt stage ( fig. 2d ) .
together , these results indicate that cryptochrome and melanopsin could be involved in the photoresponses of smolt melanophores , suggesting that cryptochrome and melanopsin are responsible for light - induced aggregation and dispersion , respectively .
however , since the cryptochrome and melanopsin sequences of rainbow trout are not available , we are unable to validate their subtypes .
future research on mrna expression at the single - cell level and functional analysis of photopigments will be helpful to understand the photosensory mechanism of melanophores .
salmonids show variable foraging and prey - search behavior on both temporal and spatial scales .
their growth and mortality risks are greatly affected by the biotic and abiotic factors that are highly associated with the habitats at different life stages .
parrs tend to hold positions near the streambed and behave as " sit - and - wait " predators .
they frequently feed on benthic invertebrates or by catching drifting prey locally .
instead , smolts show increased feeding activity and are able to capture a variety of surface prey .
thus , salmonids have to progressively adjust or tune their sensory systems during ontogeny .
the distribution of chromatophores leads to the formation of pigment spots and bars ; hence , the color change of chromatophores in response to light will certainly influence fish appearance .
although the change of coloration during the course of smoltification has been reported ( hoar , 1988 ) , the ontogeny of chromatophore photoresponses in rainbow trout remains unknown so far .
in the present study , rainbow trout melanophores showed photoresponses only in smolts but not parrs .
for smolts , light - induced color change benefits their adaptation to different environments .
in rainbow trout , the ontogenic change of body coloration and the appearance of retinal uvs cone are mediated by thyroid hormone ( th ) ( hoar , 1988 ) .
it is possible that the development of intrinsic photosensitivity of melanophores is also a th - regulated process .
in order to fully evaluate the role of melanophore photoresponses in non - image - forming tasks during ontogeny , the characterization of melanophore photosensitivity at later life stages and the association with environments and behaviours must be determined .
nevertheless , our findings provide the first demonstration of developmental change of chromatophore photosensitivity of migratory species as well as developmental changes in the expression of two non - visual pigments , cryptochrome and melanopsin , which could participate in the photoresponses of extraretinal photoreceptors .
materials and methods animals rainbow trout ( oncorhynchus mykiss ) at two developmental stages were obtained from the rainbow springs trout hatchery ( thamesford , ontario , canada ) .
parrs were 13.5 +/ - 3.8 g in weight and 10.2 +/ - 1.7 cm in length ; smolts were 88.45 +/ - 3.4 g in weight and 21.1 +/ - 0.3 cm in length .
they were maintained in flow - through freshwater ( 15degreesc ) holding tanks under a 12 h : 12 h l : d light cycle .
lighting was provided by full spectrum fluorescent lamps ( full spectrum solutions , inc. , jackson , mi , usa ) .
fish were anaesthetized by immersion in ms - 222 ( syndel laboratories ltd. , qualicum beach , bc , canada ) and split - fin tissues were taken from tails for the measurements of melanophore photoresponses .
all procedures complied with the canadian council for animal care regulations .
measurements of cell numbers and photoresponses of melanophores split - fin tissues containing melanophores were perfused with pbs ( 15degreesc ; nacl 125.3 mm , kcl 2.7 mm , cacl2 1.8 mm , mgcl2 1.8 mm , d - glucose 5.6 mm , tris - hcl buffer 5.0 mm [ ph 7.2 ] ; sigma - aldrich [ oakville , ontario , canada ]) and were stimulated with light generated by a 150 w xenon lamp system and a monochrometer ( photon technology international , london , on , canada ) .
images were taken using a qimaging microimager ii ccd camera with qcapture suite v2.46 software ( qimaging , burnaby , bc , canada ) .
cell counting was conducted in regions ( 200 microm2 ) between the 3rd and 4th fin rays .
to measure melanophore photoresponses , matlab software ( mathworks , natick , ma , usa ) was used for pixel counts of the pigment - covered area of a cell in a series of images .
first , a cell was selected with a rectangular software tool , fitting it as close to the cell dendrites as possible .
the selected image was converted to a binary image using a threshold level which defined pixel numbers with the highest correlation to the results obtained using adobe photoshop cs ( adobe systems , san jose , california ) with manual selection ( supplementary material fig. s2 ) .
pixel intensity values greater than the threshold were determined a value of 1 .
the sum of values in each image was used to represent the pigment - covered area within a melanophore .
smolt melanophores displayed biphasic photoresponses , i.e. aggregations and dispersions , when presented with uv / short and middle / long wavelengths , respectively .
to choose an appropriate intensity of stimulus , response versus intensity ( ri ) curves were generated for aggregation ( at 380 nm ) and dispersion ( at 500 nm ) .
for each measurement cycle , tissues were illuminated at 380 nm ( 13.88 log photons cm - 2 s - 1 ) or 500 nm ( 13.92 log photons cm - 2 s - 1 ) for 1.5 minutes , followed by 5 - min darkness to reach full aggregation or dispersion .
subsequently , stimulus intensity was increased in a step - wise fashion with 1.5 minutes at each level controlled by a neutral density ( nd ) wedge ( for aggregation : 12.26 [ 1.6nd ] , 12.62 [ 1.2 nd ] , 13.09 [ 0.8nd ] , 13.48 [ 0.4nd ] and 13.88 [ 0nd ] log photons cm - 2 s - 1 ; for dispersion : 12.87 [ 1nd ] , 13.09 [ 0.8nd ] , 13.3 [ 0.6nd ] , 13.52 [ 0.4nd ] , 13.72 [ 0.2nd ] and 13.92 [ 0nd ] log photons cm - 2 s - 1 ) .
the intensities ( is ) required for half - maximal photoresponses were used for the following measurements of photoresponses ( aggregations : 12.90 log photons cm - 2 s - 1 ; dispersions : 13.32 log photons cm - 2 s - 1 ) .
to determine if cells were sensitive to light , melanophore photoresponses were measured as follows .
first , full aggregation ( afull aggregation ) or full dispersion ( afull dispersion ) was achieved under illumination at 380 ( 13.88 log photons cm - 2 s - 1 ) or 500 nm ( 13.92 log photons cm - 2 s - 1 ) for 1.5 minutes , followed by 5 - min darkness .
then , cells were presented with light stimulus at wavelengths ( lambda = 380 , 420 , 460 , 500 , 540 , and 580 nm ) at is for 1.5 minutes .
the ratio ( r ) of pigment covered area change was calculated as : ( 1 ) where alambda denotes the pixel counts of pigmented area at a particular wavelength ( lambda ) .
we found that parr melanophores were insensitive to light , while smolt cells showed photoresponses at each test wavelengths ( supplementary material fig. s1 ) .
we further investigated the spectral sensitivity of smolt melanophores using the aforementioned method with smaller measuring interval from 380 to 600 nm ( lambda = 380 , 390 , 400 , 420 , 440 , 460 , 480 , 500 , 520 , 540 , 560 , 580 , and 600 nm ) .
melanophore photosensitivity ( as ) was calculated as : ( 2 ) afull photoresponse is afull dispersion when lambda = 380 , 390 , 400 nm , and afull aggregation when lambda = 420 - 600 nm. these data were normalized with maximum aggregation and dispersion at - 1 and + 1 , respectively , to minimize the variation between cells , and a photosensitivity curve of mean normalized sensitivity against wavelength was plotted .
western blot western blotting was performed using rat polyclonal anti - rainbow trout uvs ( sws1 ) opsin ( allison et al. , 2006 ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - zebrafish rod opsins ( 86 % identity with the homolog of rh1 of o. mykiss ; generous gifts from dr. david hyde , university of notre dame ) , mouse monoclonal anti - human cryptochrome 1 ( cry 1 ; abcam inc. , toronto , on , canada ) , and rabbit polyclonal anti - human melanopsin ( opn4 ; abnova , taipei , taiwan ) antibodies .
mouse monoclonal anti - chicken actin ( abcam inc. , toronto , on , canada ) was used as a loading standard .
first , proteins were extracted from caudal fins of parrs and smolts ( n = 5 per stage ) by homogenization in ice - cold cell lysis buffer ( 50 mm tris [ ph 8.0 ] , 150 mm nacl , 1 % triton x - 100 ; [ sigma - aldrich , oakville , ontario , canada ]) .
subsequently , lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4degreesc .
supernatants were collected and used in western blots with the antisera .
proteins were resolved in a 10 % sds - polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a pvdf membrane .
after blocking using 5 % non - fat dry milk in pbst ( pbs with 0.1 % tween20 ) for 30 minutes at room temperature , membranes were incubated with antibodies ( anti - uvs = 1:1000 , anti - rh1 = 1:50,000 , anti - cry 1 = 1:500 , anti - opn4 = 1:20 , and anti - actin = 1:5000 , diluted in blocking solution ) at 4degreesc overnight .
following several washes with pbst , immunosignals were detected with goat anti - rat , anti - mouse or anti - rabbit antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase ( vector laboratories , burlingame , ca , usa ) and visualized with bcip / nbt ( calbiochem , san diego , ca , usa ) .

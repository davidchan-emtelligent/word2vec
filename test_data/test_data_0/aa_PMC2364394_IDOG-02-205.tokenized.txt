objective : the purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of erythromycin , amoxicillin , and clindamycin in eradicating chlamydia trachomatis from the lower genital tract of pregnant women .
methods : a total of 174 women at < 36 weeks gestation with positive cervical cultures for c. trachomatis were enrolled .
patients were assigned in a randomized prospective fashion to either erythromycin ( 500 mg q.i.d , for 7 days ) , amoxicillin ( 500 mg t.i.d , for 7 days ) , or clindamycin ( 600 mg t.i.d , for 10 days ) .
six women elected not to participate and 8 patients were lost to follow - up , leaving 53 patients in the erythromycin group , 55 patients in the amoxicillin group , and 52 patients in the clindamycin group .
all sexual partners of the enrolled women were offered doxycycline ( 100 mg b.i.d. for 7 days ) and patients were instructed to use barrier contraception until treatment was complete .
results : all 3 medications were effective agents for the treatment of antenatal c. trachomatis infection with treatment efficacies of 96 % , 94 % , and 98 % for the erythromycin , amoxicillin , and clindamycin groups , respectively .
when the antibiotic groups were compared , no statistically significant differences were noted in intolerance .
however , the differences in the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms between erythromycin and amoxicillin and / or clindamycin were significant ( p < 0.05 ) .
conclusions : these findings suggest that 1 ) all 3 antibiotic regimens are efficacious , 2 ) erythromycin has a higher incidence of side effects , and 3 ) amoxicillin or clindamycin are reasonable alternatives for the treatment of c. trachomatis in pregnant patients unable to tolerate erythromycin .

background we have previously shown that the eukaryotic elongation factor subunit 1b gamma ( eef1bgamma ) interacts with the rna polymerase ii ( pol ii ) alpha - like subunit " c " ( polr2c ) , alone or complexed , in the pol ii enzyme .
moreover , we demonstrated that eef1bgamma binds the promoter region and the 3 ' utr mrna of the vimentin gene .
these events contribute to localize the vimentin transcript and consequentially its translation , promoting a proper mitochondrial network .
methods with the intent of identifying additional transcripts that complex with the eef1bgamma protein , we performed a series of ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation ( rip ) assays using a mitochondria - enriched heavy membrane ( hm ) fraction .
results among the eef1bgamma complexed transcripts , we found the mrna encoding the che - 1 / aatf multifunctional protein .
as reported by other research groups , we found the tumor suppressor p53 transcript complexed with the eef1bgamma protein .
here , we show for the first time that eef1bgamma binds not only che - 1 and p53 transcripts but also their promoters .
remarkably , we demonstrate that both the che - 1 transcript and its translated product localize also to the mitochondria and that eef1bgamma depletion strongly perturbs the mitochondrial network and the correct localization of che - 1 .
in a doxorubicin ( dox ) - induced dna damage assay we show that eef1bgamma depletion significantly decreases p53 protein accumulation and slightly impacts on che - 1 accumulation .
importantly , che - 1 and p53 proteins are components of the dna damage response machinery that maintains genome integrity and prevents tumorigenesis .
conclusions our data support the notion that eef1bgamma , besides its canonical role in translation , is an rna - binding protein and a key player in cellular stress responses .
we suggest for eef1bgamma a role as primordial transcription / translation factor that links fundamental steps from transcription control to local translation .

the eef1 holoenzyme plays a role in protein synthesis by recruiting the aminoacyl - trnas to the a site of the ribosome [ 1 ] .
using the current nomenclature for higher eukaryotes , eef1 consists of two different sub - complexes : eef1a and eef1b .
eef1a ( formerly eef1alpha ) is a single polypeptide , whereas eef1b is a multimer of eef1balpha ( formerly eef1beta ) , eef1bdelta ( formerly eef1delta ) , and eef1bgamma ( formerly eef1gamma ) .
there is evidence to indicate that eef1bgamma stimulates , but is not required for , the catalytic activity of eef1balpha [ 2 , 3 ] .
indeed , eef1bgamma appears dispensable for translation , and its absence does not seem to affect the global rate of translational elongation [ 4 , 5 ] .
nevertheless , multiple non - canonical roles for eef1bgamma are emerging , some of which can be regulated by phosphorylation driven by several protein kinases [ 6 ] .
a role of eefb1gamma in the oxidative stress response pathways is justified by the presence in the n terminus of a conserved sequence resembling the glutathione - binding region of the theta class of glutathione s - transferase ( gst ) enzymes , which are involved in the detoxification of oxygen radicals .
the over - expression of the eef1bgamma gene product has been reported in several tumors , including pancreatic , breast , colon , and gastric tumors [ 7 - 11 ] .
there is growing evidence that the elongation step is also regulated in response to environmental cues , supporting the idea that deregulation of translational control serves as a common mechanism by which diverse oncogenic pathways promote cellular transformation and tumor development [ 12 , 13 ] .
in a wider context , aberrant proliferation of cancer cells is supported by adaptation to nutrient microenvironment mediated by a dynamic metabolic reprogramming [ 14 ] .
importantly , the level of eef1bgamma upregulation was shown to positively correlate with tumor aggressiveness , presumably due to an altered redox balance [ 2 , 15 , 16 ] .
eef1bgamma displays an affinity for membrane and cytoskeleton elements , and it can properly anchor the different subunits of the ef1 complex to the cytoskeleton [ 2 , 6 , 17 ] .
interestingly , al - maghrebi et al .
( 2002 ) demonstrated the rna - binding properties of eef1bgamma by showing for the first time its binding to the 3 ' utr of vimentin mrna [ 18 ] , suggesting that eef1bgamma could exert many of its biological functions through the binding of a pool of mrnas .
in addition , human eef1bgamma was recently identified in a proteomic screen as a member of the pre - mrna 3 ' end cleavage complex [ 19 ] .
in this context , eef1bgamma could participate in the anchoring and translation of a set of mrnas that are preferentially translated on cytoskeletal - or membrane - bound ribosomes , such as vimentin mrna .
vimentin has been recently reported to have a regulatory role in supporting the morphology , organization and function of mitochondria [ 20 , 21 ] .
importantly we previously demonstrated that eef1bgamma partially co - localizes with mitochondria [ 5 ] .
yoo 's research group showed that hcdc73 , a component of the human rna polymerase ii - associated factor complex ( pafc ) , binds and destabilizes p53 mrna via eef1bgamma , thus acting as a binding platform [ 22 ] .
they proposed that mis - regulation of this interaction may lead to tumor progression .
liu et al. reported a new role for eef1bgamma in the activation of the nf - kb signaling pathway , through targeting the mitochondrial antiviral adaptor protein ( mavs ) , which bridges viral rna recognition and downstream signal activation [ 23 ] .
the esposito research group showed that the tnf receptor associated protein ( trap1 ) , a mitochondrial member of the hsp90 family , which is involved in the protection of oxidative stress , selectively binds eef1bgamma , and , remarkably , both trap1 and eef1bgamma are co - upregulated in human colorectal cancers [ 24 ] .
we have previously shown that eef1bgamma interacts with the rna polymerase ii ( pol ii ) alpha - like subunit " c " ( polr2c ) , alone or complexed , in pol ii [ 25 - 27 ] .
the polr2c / polr2j heterodimer ( also called rpb3 / rpb11 ) is reminiscent of the alpha subunit homodimer of bacterial rna polymerase [ 28 ] .
in bacteria , the alpha subunit homodimer associates with sigma factors that mediate promoter recognition [ 29 - 31 ] .
moreover , eef1bgamma has been described to bind the vimentin 3 ' utr , and we have shown that it also binds the promoter region of the vimentin gene [ 5 , 18 ] .
these results suggest that eef1bgamma has a role in shuttling / nursing vimentin mrna ( and presumably a specific set of mrnas ) from their gene locus to their appropriate cellular compartment for translation .
on the basis of eef1bgamma sub - cellular localization and its involvement in rna metabolism and mitochondria / cytoskeleton organization , herein , using a mitochondria - enriched heavy membrane ( hm ) fraction , we identified , by ribonucleoprotein complex immunoprecipitation ( rip assay ) , several novel transcripts that complexed with eef1bgamma .
among the isolated mrnas , we found genes involved in translation and in mitochondrial / cytoskeleton metabolism .
in particular , we found the mrna of the pol ii binding protein che - 1 / aatf , and we confirmed the presence of the p53 transcript [ 22 ] .
che - 1 plays a role in multiple fundamental processes , including control of transcription , cell cycle regulation , dna damage responses and apoptosis [ 32 - 34 ] .
recent studies suggest that che - 1 protein level dysregulation could be relevant for the transformation process .
che - 1 is found upregulated in several leukemia cell lines and in patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [ 33 ] .
loss or mutation of the oncosuppressor p53 is strongly associated with the susceptibility to cancer and to malignant tumor progression [ 35 , 36 ] .
notably , che - 1 directly binds p53 and is an important regulator of p53 activity [ 37 ] .
moreover , che - 1 enhances the oncogenic potential of the mutated forms of the oncosuppressor p53 ( mtp53 ) [ 34 , 38 ] .
here , we show for the first time that eef1bgamma binds to the che - 1 and tp53 promoter regions .
in addition , we describe a novel mitochondrial localization for the che - 1 protein , and we show that che - 1 needs mitochondrial integrity for correct localization .
we suggest a role for eef1bgamma as a primordial transcription / translation factor that links the fundamental steps between transcription control and local translation .

results eef1bgamma binds specific mrnas and their gene promoter regions the eef1bgamma protein has been shown to associate with both the vimentin promoter and vimentin 3 ' utr mrna , thus influencing the cellular shape and mitochondria localization [ 5 , 18 ] .
here , with the intent of identifying additional transcripts complexed with the eef1bgamma protein , we performed a series of ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation ( rip ) assays .

the cdna output was randomly amplified , size selected and cloned. fig. 1c shows the resulting hm - cdna library .
interestingly , among the mrnas complexed with eef1bgamma , we isolated the che - 1 / aatf mrna .
the rt - pcr analysis , shown in fig. 1d , demonstrated the presence of che - 1 mrna in eef1bgamma rip assay output. fig. 1 eef1bgamma binds specific mrnas and their gene promoter regions a schematic representation of the rip assay .
b hela cell extract , enriched in heavy membrane ( hm ) fractions , was immunoprecipitated with anti - eef1bgamma rabbit polyclonal antibodies or with no antibodies ( no - ab ) .

immunoprecipitates from each sample were analyzed by pcr performed with primers specific for the human che - 1 promoter and for the human tp53 promoter .
the thymidine kinase human promoter was amplified as a negative control .
a sample representing linear amplification of the total input chromatin ( input ) was included in the pcr as a control although in a specific subcellular fraction , we confirmed the presence of vimentin and p53 transcripts , as previously reported [ 18 , 22 ] .
additional file 2 : table s2 shows a list of selected individual clones randomly sequenced from the mitochondria - enriched heavy membrane ( hm ) - cdna library .
additional file 3 : figure s1a shows the rt - pcr validation of some of the individual clones .
the finding of the che - 1 transcript in the eef1bgamma rip assay output is consistent with the presence of eef1bgamma on the che - 1 promoter that we have communicated in our previous manuscript [ 5 ] .
as shown in fig. 1e , by dna chip analysis in hela cells , we confirmed the presence of eef1bgamma on the che - 1 promoter , and , importantly , we showed for the first time the presence of eef1bgamma on the tp53 gene promoter .
the chip experiments were also performed on human neuroblastoma hsh - sy5y cells , confirming the data ( additional file 4 : figure s2a ) .
eef1bgamma co - localizes with specific mrnas it has been shown that in vimentin 3 ' utr mrna , eef1bgamma binds an rna element named the " y shaped structure " , which exhibits striking sequence homology across species [ 47 , 48 ] .
moreover , sasvari et al. demonstrated a role for eef1bgamma in tomato bushy stunt virus ( tbsv ) replication by interacting with a stem - loop structure at the 3 ' end of the viral rna [ 49 ] .
interestingly , as shown in fig. 2a , the human che - 1 3 ' utr mrna is characterized by a stem - loop secondary structure folded according to the dynamic programming algorithm originally proposed by zuker and stiegler [ 50 ] .
to visualize and validate the interaction between eef1bgamma and the che - 1 3 ' utr , we performed an ms2 assay [ 51 ] .
figure 2b ( left panel ) shows a schematic representation of the ms2 assay .
briefly , the ms2 - gfp system is based on two components : a fusion of the ms2 coat protein with the gfp protein carrying a nuclear localization signal nls ( ms2 - gfp ) and a reporter transcript ( report mrna ) containing multimers of the rna stem - loop , recognized by the ms2 - gfp protein , upstream of the 3 ' utr of the mrna of interest .
ms2 - gfp chimeric protein , over - expressed alone in mammalian cells , shows a nuclear localization , whereas when it binds to the rna stem - loop , it tends to move in the cytoplasmic compartment .
as shown in fig. 2b ( right panel ) , ms2 - gfp protein expressed in hela cells alone or with the 3 ' utr of che - 1 or vimentin was analyzed in the presence or absence of myc - eef1bgamma .
only in the presence of myc - eef1bgamma a clear dot fluorescent pattern is observed in the cytoplasmic compartment .
additional file 3 : figure s1b shows additional ms2 assays performed on different mrnas complexed with eef1bgamma ( see additional file 2 : table s2 ) .
as shown in fig. 2c , to visualize co - localization of endogenous eef1bgamma protein and endogenous che - 1 or vimentin mrnas , we performed rna - fish analysis combined with indirect eef1bgamma - immunofluorescence in hela cells .
we quantified eef1bgamma / 3'utr mrna co - localization by measuring intensity correlation quotient ( icq ) values as shown in the bar graph. fig. 2 eef1bgamma co - localizes with specific mrnas a the human che - 1 3 ' utr was folded according to the computer algorithm of zuker and stiegler to yield a structure of minimum free energy [ 65 ] .
b schematic representation of the chimeric bacteriophage ms2 coat protein fused to the gfp protein ( ms2 - gfp ) and the reporter transcript containing multimers of the rna stem - loop , recognized by the ms2 - gfp protein , upstream of the 3 ' utr of the mrna of interest named : " report mrna " ( left panel ) .
the ms2 - gfp protein was expressed in hela cells either alone or with the report mrna carrying the 3 ' utr of che - 1 or vimentin mrnas ( upper panel ) .
in the lower panel , ms2 - gfp was co - expressed with myc - eef1bgamma protein and with the report mrna carrying either the 3 ' utr of che - 1 or the 3'utr of vimentin transcripts ( right panel ) .
c co - localization of endogenous eef1bgamma protein and either che - 1 or vimentin endogenous mrnas in hela cells .
expression of eef1bgamma was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using polyclonal eef1bgamma antibodies ( red ) , whereas che - 1 and vimentin mrnas ( green ) were detected by rna - fish .
nuclei ( blue ) were stained with dapi .
intensity correlation quotient ( icq ) shown in the bar graph was calculated using coloc 2 plugin in the image j / fiji software and indicates whether the intensity of co - staining varies in synchrony over space .
the values indicated represent an average over at least 10 cells from different images and the error bars indicate standard error characterization of the eef1bgamma mrna binding property taking into account that eef1bgamma acts as an rna - binding protein , we assessed the eef1bgamma distribution in a polysomal profile in hela cells ( fig. 3a , right ) .
cytoplasmic extracts were subjected to ultracentrifugation in a sucrose density gradient in the presence or absence of edta .
the edta treatment dissociated the large and small ribosomal subunits and virtually disrupted all polyribosomes .
in our experimental conditions , eef1bgamma protein was mainly retained in slow - sedimenting fractions that were enriched in ribonucleoprotein particles ( mrnps ) ( fig. 3a , left ) .
we also tested the distribution of the survival motor neuron ( smn ) protein because it has been demonstrated that this rna - related protein associates with polyribosomes [ 42 , 52 ] .
the protein composition of each collected fraction was validated using s6 and l7 antibodies to monitor the small and large ribosomal subunits , respectively .
the eef1bgamma protein is a multi - domain polypeptide that harbors a gst like domain on the n - terminus and an eef1g super - family domain at the carboxyl terminus ( ref : pfam 00147 ) .
in addition , in the carboxyl terminus , there is a region with 74 % homology to the sigma - 70 factors ecf subfamily signature ( ref : pdoc00814 ) .
to identify the eef1bgamma domain / s responsible for che - 1 and p53 mrna interactions , a series of eef1bgamma deletion mutants fused to the myc tag was constructed ( fig. 3b ) .
hela cells were transiently transfected with myc - eef1bgamma or with its deletion mutants to perform a rip assay analysis .
the immunoprecipitations , performed using myc - tag antibodies , were analyzed by western blotting as shown in fig. 3c ( left panel ) , and co - immunoprecipitated mrnas were extracted and converted to cdna .
che - 1 and p53 mrnas co - immunoprecipitated with the indicated constructs were plotted in a graph .
the data are expressed as percent precipitation relative to the input mrnas .
the mean background level is illustrated by the horizontal line in the graph [ 53 ]. by rt - pcr , the cdna output confirmed the presence of both che - 1 and p53 transcripts in full - length eef1bgamma and their limited presence in deletion mutants eef1bgamma - deltanh2 and eef1bgamma - deltax. fig. 3 characterization of the eef1bgamma mrna binding property a polysome profiles of hela cells by sedimentation velocity through sucrose density gradients .

the horizontal line illustrates the mean background level che - 1 protein mitochondria localization and eef1bgamma depletion effects we previously demonstrated that eef1bgamma contributes to govern the correct localization of vimentin intermediate - filament protein , which is known to be involved in cell morphology and organelle positioning [ 5 ] .
because the che - 1 protein was observed in both the nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles [ 33 , 54 , 55 ] , we examined che - 1 sub cellular localization in more detail .
in fig. 4a ( left panel ) , using the rat che - 1 antibody in a dual - label immunofluorescence assay with mitochondrion - selective dye mitotracker ( red ) , we detected novel localization of che - 1 protein in mitochondria .
to further verify the che - 1 mitochondrial localization , we used the mitochondrial marker tom20 in a dual - label immunofluorescence assay in hsh - sy5y cells .
extensive co - localization between endogenous che - 1 and tom20 is revealed by the merged - color image ( additional file 4 : figure s2b ) .
western blot analysis of the mitochondria - enriched heavy membrane ( hm ) fraction , prepared from hela cells , clearly confirmed a che - 1 mitochondrial association ( fig. 4a , right panel ) .
che - 1 mitochondrial localization was also observed in the mitochondrial fraction prepared from hsh - sy5y cells ( additional file 4 : figure s2c ) .
to investigate the possible effects of eef1bgamma depletion on mitochondrial che - 1 expression levels , quantitative real time pcr ( qpcr ) and western blot analyses were performed with hela cells .
in our experimental conditions , eef1bgamma knockdown did not produce any significant change in che - 1 expression levels ( both rna and protein levels ) in mitochondria - enriched hm fractions ( fig. 4b , c ) .
the same results were obtained using a purified mitochondrial fraction ( fig. 4b , c ) .
we also checked transcript and protein levels of che - 1 upon eef1bgamma depletion by analyzing the whole - cell lysate .
histograms presented in additional file 3 : figure s1c and s1d show almost no changes in che - 1 levels .
similar results were obtained when qpcr was performed on representative mrnas co - immunoprecipitated with eef1bgamma ( additional file 2 : table s2 and additional file 3 : figure s1c ) .
equivalent results were obtained for eef1bgamma sirna in the hsh - sy5y cell line ( additional file 4 : figure s2d and e ) .
next , we investigated the mitochondrial localization of che - 1 by indirect immunofluorescence with both anti - tom20 antibodies and rat anti - che - 1 antibodies in hela cells treated with eef1bgamma sirna .
figure 4d shows the results of mitochondrial fragmentation , swelling and disorganization .
the mitochondrial network was severely compromised ( fragmented ) and the co - localization che - 1 / tom20 was partially lost. fig. 4 che - 1 mitochondrial localization and impact of eef1bgamma depletion a co - localization of endogenous che - 1 , performed using the anti - che - 1 rat polyclonal antibody ( green ) , and mitotracker ( r ) - red , which stains mitochondria , in hela cells .

nuclei were stained with dapi ( blue ) eef1bgamma in cellular responses to genotoxic stress because our data on eef1bgamma depletion indicated almost no changes in the che - 1 and p53 levels , we investigated the possible impact of eef1bgamma in stress pathways shared by che - 1 and p53 , such as genotoxic stress induced by treatment with doxorubicin ( dox ) .
to this end , we examined the effect of eef1bgamma depletion on che - 1 and p53 mrna and protein levels in hct116 cells during dox - induced dna damage .
as shown in fig. 5a , quantitative real time pcr ( qpcr ) analysis indicated that hct116 cells transiently transfected with either sirna - eef1bgamma or sirna - control and treated with 1 mum dox at one hour and two hours did not display significant changes of both p53 and che - 1 mrna levels .
only a slightly decrease of che - 1 and p53 transcripts was detected when dox treatment was coupled with eef1bgamma depletion .
western blot analysis indicated that hct116 cells transiently transfected with either sirna - eef1bgamma or sirna - control and treated with 1 mum dox at one hour and two hours produced an evident decrease of p53 protein accumulation and a slight decrease of che - 1 protein accumulation ( fig. 5b ) [ 33 , 56 ]. fig. 5 eef1bgamma depletion : effects on dna damage response a hct116 cells were transiently transfected with either sirna - eef1bgamma or sirna - control and 72 h later were treated with 1 mum doxorubicin ( dox ) at various time points as indicated .

densitometric analysis represents the mean +/ - s.d. of four independent experiments ( right panel ) discussion it is clear that eef1bgamma , in addition to its canonical role in the translation elongation complex , displays rna binding ability [ 18 , 22 , 48 ] .
in particular , eef1bgamma has been shown to bind the vimentin 3 ' utr , and we have shown that it also binds the promoter region of the vimentin gene [ 5 , 18 ] .
here , to identify further functional pathways in which eef1bgamma is involved , we put our efforts in the isolation and characterization of additional mrnas recognized by eef1bgamma protein , using the rip assay technology .
to this end , we focused on the mitochondria - enriched heavy membrane ( hm ) subcellular fraction with the idea of assessing eef1bgamma involvement in mitochondrial and cytoskeletal metabolisms .
among the isolated mrnas , we mainly found genes involved in cytoskeleton transport / organization , translation and mitochondrial metabolism .
we confirmed the presence of vimentin and p53 transcripts , already reported [ 18 , 22 ]. by serendipity , we found the mrna of the pol - ii binding protein che - 1 / aatf .
the human che - 1 3'utr is characterized by the presence of a conserved rna stem - loop structure that could be the target of eef1bgamma protein. by use of different imaging techniques ( ms2 - gfp and fish combined with immunofluorescence ) , we visualized the co - localization / interaction of endogenous eef1bgamma with endogenous che - 1 or vimentin mrnas in peculiar granules accumulated in the cytoplasm around the nucleus .
the polysomal profile analysis reveals that the eef1bgamma protein is mainly present in the ribosome free mrnps - enriched fractions .
these data together support the notion that the ability of eef1bgamma to bind selected mrnas is fundamental to carrying out its non - canonical roles .
a further eef1bgamma non - canonical role resides in its ability to recognize specific gene promoters .
we have previously shown that eef1bgamma binds the promoter region of the vimentin gene , and here , we showed that eef1bgamma is also found in both che - 1 and tp53 promoters regions .
these results suggest a role for eef1bgamma in nursing / trafficking selected mrnas from the gene locus to the local product translation site .
these findings are consistent with the following notions : 1 ) eef1bgamma binds the p53 transcript and controls its stability , and we show here that eef1bgamma also binds che - 1 mrna ; 2 ) fanciulli and colleagues demonstrated that che - 1 directly interacts with p53 and is involved in regulating p53 expression [ 37 ] ; and 3 ) both che - 1 and eef1bgamma directly bind to the alpha - like pol ii heterodimer .
more precisely , eef1bgamma binds to the subunit polr2c ( rpb3 ) , whereas che - 1 contacts the small subunit polr2j ( rpb11 ) .
these two subunits form a core subassembly unit of pol ii and are considered the functional counterpart of the bacterial rna polymerase alpha subunit homodimer .
in bacteria , the alpha subunit homodimer associate with sigma factors that mediate promoter recognition [ 29 - 31 ]. with the aim of characterizing the eef1bgamma protein domain responsible for mrna binding , we used a series of eef1bgamma deletion mutants in rip assay .
in our assays , only two deletion mutants retained minimal che - 1 and p53 mrna binding ability , thus suggesting that eef1bgamma protein integrity is required for proper rna binding activity .
data reported in the literature have indicated a very wide che - 1 protein distribution , including the nucleolus , nucleus , cytoplasm , golgi apparatus , centrosome and focal adhesion [ 33 , 54 , 55 ] .
we have shown for the first time that che - 1 localizes at the mitochondria .
indeed , che - 1 has been reported to ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction associated with the accumulation of superoxide [ 57 ]. is it possible that eef1bgamma is important for transportation of the che - 1 mrna to the mitochondria , and once the mrna is there , eef1bgamma is dispensable for its translation .
garg 's research group recently demonstrated that che - 1 cooperates with mir - 2909 in the regulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 ( ucp2 ) , a critical protein whose dysregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of a number of human diseases , including cancer [ 58 , 59 ] .
the connection between eef1bgamma , che - 1 and p53 proteins and their transcripts indicated , for these genes , involvement in closely related pathways .
indeed , p53 is involved in regulation of the mitochondrial metabolism , playing multiple roles depending on its wild - type / mutation status and translocation into the mitochondria [ 60 - 62 ] .
as wells as for che - 1 , eef1bgamma could also participate to p53 localization and / or translation .
in this scenario , eef1bgamma affecting che - 1 and p53 rna metabolism , could be an important player within functional networks interconnecting che - 1 and p53 proteins .
the depletion of eef1bgamma induces mitochondrial fragmentation and disorganization ; this phenomenon correlates with an aberrant che - 1 protein sub - cellular distribution , as we already described for vimentin intermediate filaments [ 5 ] .
because in a steady - state condition eef1bgamma depletion produces almost no changes in che - 1 levels , we investigated the possible impact of eef1bgamma in stress pathways in which both che - 1 and p53 are involved such as dna damage [ 33 , 63 , 64 ] .
in a dox - induced genotoxic stress in hct116 cells , eef1bgamma depletion decreases p53 protein accumulation and slightly impacts also on che - 1 accumulation .
importantly , che - 1 and p53 proteins are effectors of the dna damage response machinery that is responsible for maintaining genome integrity and preventing tumorigenesis .
our data are in agreement with the role of eef1bgamma in cellular stress responses , suggesting that the dna damage response pathway will be fundamental in further investigations of non - canonical eef1bgamma functions , pointing also at elucidating eef1bgamma role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression .
conclusions using the rip assay with eef1bgamma in the mitochondria - enriched hm fraction , we isolated several novel mrnas involved in cytoskeleton transport / organization , translation and mitochondrial metabolism .
among the eef1bgamma complexed transcripts , we found the mrna that encodes che - 1 protein and we confirmed the presence of the p53 transcript .
importantly , we demonstrated that eef1bgamma binds to both che - 1 and tp53 gene promoters .
we described for the first time che - 1 mitochondrial localization .
in a dox - induced dna damage assay , we show that eef1bgamma depletion significantly decreases p53 protein accumulation and slightly impacts also on che - 1 protein accumulation .
taking into account that eef1bgamma is able : 1 ) to bind directly pol ii , 2 ) to bind to target gene promoters , 3 ) to bind their transcripts , 4 ) to accompany the mrnas to the correct translation site and 5 ) to participate / enhance translation elongation through its detoxification gst - domain and through its ability to anchor cytoskeleton , we suggest for eef1bgamma a role in cellular stress responses as primordial transcription / translation factor that links fundamental steps from transcription control to local translation .

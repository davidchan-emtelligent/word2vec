apart from the antihyperglycemic effects , dpp4 inhibitors and glp - 1 molecules are involved in the preservation of cardiac functions .
we have demonstrated that dpp4 - deficient rats possess resistance to endotoxemia and ischemia / reperfusion stress .
however , whether the decrease of dpp4 activity simply augmented the glp - 1 signaling or that such decrease resulted in a change of cellular function remain unclear .
accordingly , we investigated the responses of h2o2 - induced oxidative stress in adult wild - type and dpp4 - deficient rats isolated cardiomyocytes .
the coadministration of glp - 1 or dpp4 inhibitor was also performed to define the mechanisms .
cell viability , ros concentration , catalase activity , glucose uptake , prosurvival , proapoptotic signaling , and contractile function were examined after cells exposed to h2o2 .
dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes were found to be resistant to h2o2 - induced cell death via activating akt signaling , enhancing glucose uptake , preserving catalase activity , diminishing ros level and proapoptotic signaling .
glp - 1 concentration - dependently improved cell viability in wild - type cardiomyocyte against ros stress , and the ceiling response concentration ( 200 nm ) was chosen for studies .
glp - 1 was shown to decrease h2o2 - induced cell death by its receptor - dependent akt pathway in wild - type cardiomyocytes , but failed to cause further activation of akt in dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes .
acute treatment of dpp4 inhibitor only augmented the protective effect of low dose glp - 1 , but failed to alter fuel utilization or ameliorate cell viability in wild - type cardiomyocytes after h2o2 exposure .
the improvement of cell viability after h2o2 exposure was correlated with the alleviation of cellular contractile dysfunction in both dpp4 - deficient and glp - 1 treated wild - type cardiomyocytes .
these findings demonstrated that glp - 1 receptor - dependent pathway is important and exert protective effect in wild - type cardiomyocyte .
long term loss of dpp4 activity increased the capability against ros stress , which was more than glp - 1 dependent pathway .

introduction dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 ( dpp4 ) cleaves multiple peptide substrates , including the incretin hormones glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( glp - 1 ) that stimulate insulin secretion from beta - cells and inhibit hepatic glucose production [ 1 ] .
a number of studies have demonstrated cytoprotective actions of glp - 1 in several kinds of cell type beyond its modulation of glucose metabolism [ 2 ] .
glp - 1 inhibits cell apoptosis or necrosis in pancreatic betacells [ 3 ] , neurons [ 4 ] , endothelial cells [ 5 ] , and cardiomyocytes [ 2 ] .
incubation with glp - 1 inhibits activation of apoptotic process and increases viability in neonatal cardiomyocytes undergoing hypoxia / reoxygenation injury [ 6 ] .
glp - 1 also prevents activation of cell death signal in adult murine hl - 1 cardiomyocytes incubated with staurosporine , a apoptotic stimuli [ 2 ] .
in addition , the presence of glp - 1 signaling has been demonstrated in cardiac function preservation in various animal model experiments , such as dilated cardiomyopathy , heart failure , and myocardial infarction [ 1 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
all these experiments demonstrate that the cytoprotective effect of glp - 1 is mediated mainly by mechanisms dependent on the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( pi3k ) and extracellular signal regulated kinase ( erk ) .
furthermore , it is worth noticing that several clinical studies showed the cardioprotective effects of glp - 1 - based therapy against ischemic and failing hearts [ 8 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
in contrast to glp - 1 , much less is known about the cardiovascular biology of dpp4 .
dpp4 known as cd26 is a homodimeric type ii transmembrane glycoprotein , which is one of the accessory molecules of helper t cells , and has three major functions : adenosine deaminase binding , extracellular matrix binding , and peptidase activity [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
a previous study showed that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of dpp4 improved cardiovascular outcomes following myocardial infarction in mice [ 19 ] .
our previous studies also showed that genetic deficiency of dpp4 in rats improved cardiac function during endotoxemia and ischemia / reperfusion , which were partly associated with glp - 1 signaling [ 11 ],[ 20 ] .
furthermore , inhibition of dpp4 enzyme activity modulates the activity of several peptides such as chemokines , neuropeptide y , and stromal cell derived factor - 1 ( sdf - 1 ) via non - glp - 1 mechanisms of action [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] .
evidences also proved that dpp4 - deficient - based cytoprotection is more complex than glp - 1 signaling .
g - csf administration in combination with dpp4 inhibitor leads to the stabilization of active sdf - 1 , which attracted stem cells to the heart and improved outcome after myocardial infarction [ 23 ] .
it remains unclear how deficiency of dpp4 leads to the protection of myocardium in animal experiments .
in vitro cellular experiments should be performed to determine whether the decrease in dpp4 activity simply augmented the glp - 1 protective signaling pathway or that such decrease resulted in a change of cellular function .
several studies used neonatal cardiomyocytes or cardiac cell lines for in vitro cellular studies , but no study has examined the effects of glp - 1 or dpp4 inhibitor on adult cardiomyocytes .
accordingly , we isolated cardiomyocytes from two kinds of adult rats , examined , and compared their response to the reactive oxygen species ( ros ) stress .
ros are thought to serve as a mediator in several cardiovascular disease [ 24 ] .
elevation of ros results in potentially cytotoxic oxidative stress , which leads to apoptosis [ 24 ] .
h2o2 is commonly used as an exogenous source of ros , which increases lipid peroxidation , decreases antioxidant enzyme activity and induces cell injury in cardiomyocyte [ 25 ] .
for these reasons , we investigated the responses of h2o2 - induced oxidative stress in adult wild - type and dpp4 - deficient rat isolated cardiomyocytes .
the coadministration of glp - 1 or dpp4 inhibitor was also performed to define the mechanism .
materials and methods 1 .
experimental animals the investigation was performed in accordance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals published by the us national institutes of health ( nih publication no .
85 - 23 , revised 1996 ) , and was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the national taiwan university .
adult fischer 344 and dpp4 - deficient mutant ( dchchsd - dpp iv ) rats were obtained from national laboratory animal center of taiwan and harlan laboratories , inc , respectively .
fischer 344 is the wild - type strain for the dpp4 - deficient rats .
animals were maintained under a 12 - h light / dark cycle at a controlled temperature ( 21 +/ - 2degreesc ) with free access to food and tap water .
2. determination of dpp4 activity gly - pro - amc ( st. louis , mo , usa ) , a synthesis substrate of dpp4 , was used to evaluate dpp4 activity in protein as described previously [ 11 ] .
the amount of amc liberation was determined for dpp4 activity .
cardiac protein in 50 mm hepes solution containing 100 um gly - pro - amc was incubated at 37degreesc for 60 min , and the liberation of free amc was monitored at 370 nm excitation and 440 nm emission .
3. adult rat cardiomyocyte isolation adult ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated from both fischer 344 and dpp4 - deficient rats .
rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital ( 50 mg / kg , i.p. ) for 15 minutes .
after rats appeared calm , hearts were quickly excised , and directly perfused on a modified langendorff perfusion apparatus with krebs buffer ( containing : 110 mm nacl , 2.6 mm kcl , 1.2 mm kh2po4 , 1.2 mm mgso4 , 25 mm nahco3 and 11 mm glucose ( ph 7.4 )) for 5 minutes .
buffer solutions were replaced by enzyme mixtures containing 0.04 % w / v collagenase ( type ii , washington biochemical corp. ) and 0.02 % w / v hyaluronidase for 20 minutes .
then , hearts were dissected mechanically to small pieces and shaken in flasks with enzyme mixture for another 40 minutes .
the collagenase digested ventricle suspensions were then filtered through a mesh to remove remnants of connective tissues .
after rinsing with solutions , cell suspensions were placed on top of bsa solution where non - cardiomyocytes were removed by a density gradient .
cells were cultured in medium with dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) supplemented with antibiotics ( 100 microg / ml penicillin and 100 microg / ml streptomycin ) at 37degreesc under a 5 % co2 - 95 % air atmosphere .
one hour after plating , the culture medium was changed to remove unattached dead cells and the viable cardiomyocytes were incubated overnight .
after the initial incubation period , quiescent cardiomyocytes were treated with h2o2 ( 300 microm ) for one hour .
in some study , glp - 1 ( 200 nm ) was preincubated for 60 min before h2o2 administration .
to explore the mechanisms activated by glp - 1 , antagonists of the glp - 1 receptor ( ex ( 9 - 39 ) ; 150 nm ) , pi3k ( ly294002 ; 15 microm ) , mek ( pd98059 ; 15 microm ) , and pka ( h89 ; 20 microm ) were used for 30 min before the addition of glp - 1 .
to evaluate whether loss of dpp4 activity induce protective effect against h2o2 - induced ros stress , a dpp4 inhibitor , diprotin a ( 50 microm ) , was added 90 min prior to h2o2 treatment .
4. detection of cell viability cell viability was determined by mtt assay .
cells were treated with mtt ( 3 - ( 4,5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2,5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide ) at 0.5 mg / ml. the purple formazan crystals were dissolved in dmso .
solutions were then loaded in a 96 well plate , and determined on an automated microplate spectrophotometer at 570 nm. each condition tested was performed in triplicate in each experiment .
5. detection of endogenously produced reactive oxygen species ( ros ) in cardiomyocytes ros generation in cardiomyocytes was detected by labeling with fluorescence dye cm - h2dcfda ( 5 - ( 6 ) - chloromethyl - 2'7 ' - dihydrofluorescein diacetate ). by using fluorescence microscopy , cardiomyocyte ros level could be monitored at 488 nm excitation and 515 nm emission .
fluorescence intensity was calculated by averaging fluorescence intensity of numerous outlined cells using imagequant ( molecular dynamics , inc. , sunnyvale , ca , usa ) .
6. detection of catalase activity in cardiomyocyte catalase activity was measured by elisa kit ( cayman chemicals , ann arbor , mi ) .
cardiomyocyte protein was prepared to measure catalase activity .
after the addition of reaction mixture , the absorbance of each sample was read at 540 nm by using a 96 - well microplate spectrophotometer .
each condition tested was performed in duplicate in each experiment .
7. detection of glucose uptake in cardiomyocyte glucose uptake was measured by elisa kit ( cayman chemicals , ann arbor , mi ) .
fluorescently - tagged glucose derivative ( 2 - nbdg ) uptake was monitored at 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission .
each condition tested was performed in triplicate in each experiment .
8. detection of cell shortening in cardiomyocyte contractile properties of cardiomyocyts were measured by using an ionoptix myocyte contractility system ( ionoptix , milton , ma usa ) .
cells were paced at 1 hz via a pair of electrode to provide field stimulation .
only clear edges with rod shapped cardiomyocytes without spontaneous contraction were selected .
several parameters were chosen for analysis : maximal velocities of shortening / relengthening (+/ - dl / dt ) , cell length of peak shortening , and time to peak shortening .
9. protein extraction of cardiomyocyte ripa buffer ( tris - hcl 50 mm , nacl 150 mm , egta 1 mm , edta 1 mm , np - 40 1 % , sodium deoxycholate 1 %) containing cocktail protease and phosphatase inhibitor ( sigma , st. louis , mo , usa ) was added to extract the protein of left ventricular or cardiomyocyte .
protein concentrations were determined by bca protein assay kit ( thermo fisher scientific inc. , rockford , il , usa ) .
10. western blot protein samples were denatured for 10 min in boiling sample buffer ( 31.3 mm tris - hcl ph 6.8 , 25 % glycerol , 10 % sds , 10 % 2 - mercaptoethanol , 0.00125 % bromophenol blue ) .
proteins were separated by sds - page and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes ( perkin - elmer life sciences , boston , ma , usa ) .
the membranes were blocked in 5 % fat - free milk dissolved in tbst ( tris / phosphate / saline / tween ) and incubated with primary antibody to actin ( purchased from santa cruz biotechnology , inc. ) , p - akt ( ser - 473 ) , akt , p - erk ( thr - 202 / tyr - 204 ) , erk , bax , bcl - 2 ( purchased from cell signaling technology , inc ) overnight at 4degreesc .
the membranes were then washed several times with tbst and followed by further incubation with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody ( santa cruz biotechnology , inc. ) for an hour .
after being washed several times , the signals were detected with the ecl system ( millipore , bedford , ma , usa ) .
the blots were scanned and quantified by imagequant ( molecular dynamics , inc. , sunnyvale , ca , usa ) .
10. statistical analysis all values were presented as means +/ - se. the results were analyzed using anova followed by bonferroni 's post hoc tests .
p < 0.05 was considered as significant difference .
results 1 .
dpp4 activity in wild - type and dpp4 - deficient heart to confirm the deficiency of dpp4 activity in mutant ( dchchsd - dppiv - ) heart , dpp4 activity in both total heart and cardiomyocyte protein were measured ( fig. 1 a and b ) .
the expression of dpp4 was determined by western blot ( fig 1c ) .
dpp4 mutant is regarded as dpp4 deficiency , since both dpp4 expression and activity of isolated cardiomyocytes from mutant rats was much lower than that in wild - type rats .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0054518.g001 figure 1 measurement of dpp4 activity and protein expression .
dpp4 activity of ( a ) total heart and ( b ) cardiomyocyte protein were measured in wild - type and dpp4 - deficient rats .
( c ) dpp4 expression was measured in two kinds of cardiomoyocytes by using western blot .

( n = 5 ) * p < 0.05 vs. wild - type .
2. cell viability in dpp4 - deficient and wild - type cardiomyocytes after h2o2 exposure to determine whether dpp4 deficiency exerted protective effect is directly or indirectly related to glp - 1 , cardiomyocytes isolated from two kinds of rats underwent h2o2 treatment in the presence or absence of glp - 1 were examined ( fig. 2 ) .
cell viability was then tested via mtt assay .
viability of dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes was higher than that of wild - type cardiomyocytes after h2o2 exposure ( fig. 2a ) .
we investigated the role of protein kinases pi3k , erk , and pka in the regulation of cell survival by using ly294002 , pd98059 , and h89 , which are capable of selectively blocking pi3k , erk , and pka , respectively .
in normal condition , the three inhibitors did not affect cell viability .
on exposure to h2o2 , pi3k and erk inhibitors caused further reduction of cell viability in wild - type and dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes .
however , pka inhibitor did not cause further reduction of cell viability in cardiomyocytes exposed to h2o2 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0054518.g002 figure 2 effects of h2o2 treatment on cell viability in wild - type and dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes .
( a ) cardiomyocytes isolated from two kinds of rats underwent h2o2 ( 300 microm ) treatment for an hour .
( b ) glp - 1 concentration ranging from 20 nm to 500 nm was preincubated for an hour before h2o2 administration in wild - type cardiomyocyte .
( c ) glp - 1 ( 200 nm ) was added for an hour before h2o2 exposured in both wild - type and dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes .
antagonists of the glp - 1 receptor ( ex ( 9 - 39 ) ; 150 nm ) , pi3k ( ly294002 ; 15 microm ) , mek ( pd98059 ; 15 microm ) , and pka ( h89 ; 20 microm ) were used for 30 min before the addition of glp - 1 .
cell viability was tested via mtt assay .
( n = 5 ) .
* p < 0.05 vs. wild - type control , # p < 0.05 vs. dpp4 - deficient control , ++ p < 0.05 vs. wild - type h2o2 , psip < 0.05 vs. dpp4 - deficient h2o2 , & p < 0.05 vs. wild - type h2o2 + glp - 1 , @ p < 0.05 vs. dpp4 - deficient h2o2 + glp - 1 .
since glp - 1 signaling was found to have a crucial role in protecting heart against i / r injury in dpp4 - deficient rats [ 11 ] , we investigated the role of glp - 1 in isolated cardiomyocytes .
different concentrations of glp - 1 were added one hour before wild - type cardiomyocyte exposed to h2o2 ( fig 2b ) .
treatment with glp - 1 was capable of improving cell viability .
40 nm of glp - 1 was shown to slightly exert protect effect , while 200 nm of glp - 1 reached the maximal response .
we selected 200 nm of glp - 1 for the following study , since the ceiling response concentration may omit the augmentation of glp - 1 signaling in dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes .
co - treatment with inhibitors of pi3k , erk , pka , and glp - 1 receptor antagonist reduced glp - 1 mediated protection of cell viability in wild - type cardiomyocyte ( fig. 2c ) .
glp - 1 slightly but insignificantly improved cell viability in dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes after h2o2 exposure .
3. h2o2 - induced high ros concentration was ameliorated in dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes the intracellular level of ros was measured by loading isolated cardiomyocytes with cm - h2dcfda .
the original microcopy photo was shown ( fig. 3a ) , and the results were all quantified ( fig. 3b ) .
small amount of ros was found in the control cardiomyocytes .
after h2o2 treatment , the ros level was significantly higher in the wild - type than that in the dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes .
glp - 1 pretreatment before h2o2 administration resulted in the alleviation of ros concentraion in wild - type cardiomyocytes , and the protective effect of glp - 1 was shown to be diminished by ex ( 9 - 39 ) , a glp - 1 receptor antagonist .
however , glp - 1 failed to further decrease ros level in dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes .
catalase activity of wild - type cardiomyocyte was significantly decreased after h2o2 exposure ( fig. 3c ) .
pretreatment with glp - 1 significantly prevented the reduction of catalase activity after h2o2 exposure in wild - type cardiomyocytes , and the protective effect of glp - 1 was abolished by ex ( 9 - 39 ) .
catalase activity in dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocyte was not altered by h2o2 .
glp - 1 failed to change catalase activity of h2o2 exposed dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0054518.g003 figure 3 effects of h2o2 treatment on ros concentration and catalase activity in wild - type and dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes .
cardiomyocytes isolated from two kinds of rats underwent h2o2 treatment in the presence or absence of glp - 1 or glp - 1 receptor antagonist , ex ( 9 - 39 ) .

4. bax / bcl2 ratio and caspase - 3 activity was lowered in dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes after exposure to h2o2 bax / bcl2 ratio serves as a marker to determine cell susceptibility to apoptosis .
in the control condition , similar bax / bcl2 ratios were found in both cardiomyocytes ( fig. 4a amd b ) .
in response to h2o2 , bax / bcl2 ratio increased in wild - type cardiomyocytes .
the elevation was less in dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes .
glp - 1 inhibited h2o2 - induced bax / bcl2 ratio elevation in both cardiomyocytes , however , only glp - 1 induced reduction of bax / bcl2 ratio in wild - type cardiomyocyote was antagonized by ex ( 9 - 39 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0054518.g004 figure 4 effects of h2o2 treatment on bax , bcl - 2 level , and caspase - 3 activity in wild - type and dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes , with or without glp - 1 or glp - 1 receptor antagonist cotreatment .
( a ) original western blots of bax and bcl - 2 were reported .
( b ) ratios of bax to bcl - 2 , and ( c ) caspase - 3 activity were reported .

caspase - 3 is a member of the cysteine - aspartic acid protease family .
sequential activation of caspase proteins plays a central role in cell apoptosis .
capase - 3 activity was shown and found to be lower in dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes than in wild - type cardiomyocytes after exposure to h2o2 ( fig. 4c ) .
glp - 1 pretreatment before h2o2 administration resulted in the alleviation of capase - 3 activity in both cardiomyocytes .
only glp - 1 induced alleviation of caspase - 3 activity in wild - type cardiomyocytes was antagonized by ex ( 9 - 39 ) .
5. p - erk activation was upregulated in h2o2 treated cardiomcyoytes erk protein phosphorylation appeared to be expressed similarly in control condition in both cardiomyocytes ( fig. 5a and c ) .
phosphorylation of erk after h2o2 exposure was significantly increased in both cardiomyocytes , while cotreatment with glp - 1 or exendin ( 9 - 39 ) did not alter the expression .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0054518.g005 figure 5 effects of h2o2 treatment on erk and akt phosphorylation in wild - type and dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes , with or without glp - 1 or glp - 1 receptor antagonist cotreatment .
( a ) original western blots of erk and p - erk were reported .
( c ) ratios of p - erk / erk were shown .
( b ) original western blots of akt and p - akt were reported .
( d ) ratios of p - akt / akt were shown .
( n = 3 - 4 ) * p < 0.05 vs. wild - type control , # p < 0.05 vs. dpp4 - deficient control , ++ p < 0.05 vs. wild - type h2o2 , & p < 0.05 vs. wild - type h2o2 + glp - 1 .
6. p - akt was activated in dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes after exposure to h2o2 akt protein phosphorylation appeared to be expressed similarly in control condition in both cardiomyocytes ( fig. 5b and d ) .
phosphorylation of akt after h2o2 exposure was significantly increased in dpp4 - deficient but not in wild - type cardiomyocytes .
glp - 1 upregulated p - akt after h2o2 treatment in wild - type cardiomyocytes , which was reversed by cotreatment with ex ( 9 - 39 ) .
glp - 1 did not further increase p - akt level in dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes .
7. dpp4 inhibitor did not improve cell viability in wild - type cardiomyocytes after h2o2 exposure to find the appropriate concentration for diprotin a to inhibit dpp4 activity , wild - type cardiomyocytes were exposed to different concentrations of diprotin a ( fig. 6a ) .
we selected 50 microm of diprotin a to inhibit dpp4 activity for the following study , and evaluate whether loss of dpp4 activity induces protective effect against ros stress in wild - type cardiomyocytes .
diprotin a alone did not alter cell viability in wild - type cardiomyocytes exposed to h2o2 ( fig. 6b ) , but amplified the protective effect of low dose glp - 1 ( 40 - 100 nm ) .
however , diprotin a did not augment the protective effect of high dose glp - 1 ( 200 nm ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0054518.g006 figure 6 effects of diprotin a on cell viability after h2o2 treatment in wild - type cardiomyocyte .
( a ) dpp4 activity was measured in diprotin a - treated wild - type cardiomyocyte .
( b ) cardiomyocytes isolated from wild - type rats underwent h2o2 ( 300 microm ) treatment for an hour in the absence or presence of diprotin a ( 50 microm , 90 min prior to h2o2 treatment ) .
glp - 1 was added for 60 min before the addition of h2o2 .
( n = 4 ) * p < 0.05 vs. wild - type control , ++ p < 0.05 vs. wild - type h2o2 .
8. dpp4 deficiency and glp - 1 improved glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes to determine whether dpp4 deficiency affects energy production and fuel utilization , glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes were measured .
short term treatment of diprotin a in wild - type cardiomyocytes did not alter glucose uptake in the control condition ( fig. 7a ) , but chronic dpp4 deficiency was shown to increase glucose uptake .
cardiomyocytes exposed to h2o2 resulted in increasing glucose uptake in each group , and a more prominent increase of glucose uptake was found in dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0054518.g007 figure 7 effects of h2o2 treatment on glucose uptake in wild - type and dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes .
( a ) glucose uptake was measured in wild - type , wild - type + diprotin a , and dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes with or without h2o2 cotreatment .
( b ) wild - type cardiomyocytes were treated with glp - 1 or glp - 1 + ex ( 9 - 39 ) in the absence or presence of h2o2 , and along with glucose uptake measurement ( n = 4 ) .
* p < 0.05 vs. wild - type control , # p < 0.05 vs. dpp4 - deficient control , ++ p < 0.05 vs. wild - type h2o2 , & p < 0.05 vs. wild - type h2o2 + glp - 1 , @ p < 0.05 vs. wild - type + glp - 1 .
glp - 1 was shown to increase glucose transporter expression in myocardium [ 12 ] , the effect of glp - 1 on glucose uptake was determined .
glp - 1 increased glucose uptake in wild - type cardiomcyoytes in both control and h2o2 - treated condition ( fig. 7b ) , and the effects were both abolished by ex ( 9 - 39 ) , a glp - 1 receptor antagonist .
9. dpp4 deficiency and glp - 1 ameliorated contractile function after cardiomyocytes exposed to h2o2 in order to understand whether the improvement of cell viability after h2o2 exposure affect contractile function , the cell shortening of cardiomyoyctes were performed .
in the control condition , similar contractile function was found in both cardiomyoyctes ( fig. 8 ) .
contractile function was suppressed after h2o2 exposure , with the reduction of peak shortening , +/ - dl / dt , and the prolongation of time to peak shortening .
the attenuation of contractile function was more deteriorated in wild - type than that in dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes .
these h2o2 - induced changes in wild - type cardiomcyoytes were partly prevented by glp - 1 treatment .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0054518.g008 figure 8 effects of h2o2 treatment on contractile function in wild - type and dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes .
cardiomcyoytes contractile function were measured after h2o2 ( 300 microm ) exposure for an hour .
glp - 1 ( 200 nm ) was preincubated for an hour before h2o2 administration in wild - type cardiomyocytes .
( a and b ) representative recordings of cell shortening were reported in wild - type and dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes .
( c ) maximal velocities of shortening (+ dl / dt ) , ( d ) maximal velocities of relengthening ( - dl / dt ) , ( e ) cell length of peak shortening , and ( f ) time to peak shortening were calculated .
n = 22 - 30 cells from three rats per group .
* p < 0.05 vs. wild - type control , # p < 0.05 vs. dpp4 - deficient control , ++ p < 0.05 vs. wild - type h2o2 .
discussion the present study demonstrated that h2o2 diminished catalase activity and increased intracellular ros concentration , which led to increased bax / bcl - 2 ratio , caspase - 3 activation , and cell death .
glp - 1 was shown to ameliorate h2o2 - induced cell death in wild - type cardiomyocyte via preserving the activity of catalase and increasing the phosphorylation of akt and glucose uptake , which were abolished by ex ( 9 - 39 ) , suggesting the importance of glp - 1 receptor dependent pathway .
the present study proved that dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes were more resistant to h2o2 than wild - type cardiomyocytes in the absence of glp - 1 cotreatment .
furthermore , dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes showed enhanced akt phosphorylation , glucose uptake , and preserved catalase activity after h2o2 exposure .
the improvement of cell viability after h2o2 exposure was correlated with the alleviation of cellular contractile dysfunction in both dpp4 - deficient and glp - 1 treated wild - type cardiomyocytes .
the results were consistent with our previous animal model experiments , that the cardiac performance after i / r injury in dpp4 - deficient rats was better than that in wild - type rats [ 11 ] .
dpp4 deficiency increased the capability against stress in both in vivo and in vitro studies , which were mediated more than glp - 1 dependent pathway cardiac energy metabolism is altered during stress .
enhancing the use of glucose as a fuel is beneficial to allow the heart to produce energy in ischemic condition [ 26 ] , while stimulation of cardiomyocytes with h2o2 resulted in a concentration - dependent increase of glucose transporter expression [ 27 ] .
acute treatment of dpp4 inhibitor only augmented the protective effect of low dose glp - 1 , but failed to improve cell viability alone in wild - type cardiomyocyte after h2o2 exposure .
in addition , only long term but not acute inhibition of dpp4 activity increased glucose utilization in cardiomyocytes , indicating that chronic loss of dpp4 activity may induce functional change and increase capability of cardiomyocytes against h2o2 stress .
the finding coincides with the other study that direct infusion of dpp4 inhibitor before ischemia did not improve functional recovery after i / r injury in the isolated heart [ 19 ] , suggesting that acute reduction of cardiac dpp4 activity is not sufficient to produce cardioprotection .
indeed , ten days of treatment with sitagliptin enhanced the circulating levels of the glp - 1 , and upregulated glut4 translocation and expression in spontaneously hypertensive rats hearts [ 28 ] .
glp - 1 increased glucose uptake in perfusion heart , and increased glut4 translocation in animal model of dilated cardiomyopathy [ 12 ] , [ 29 ] .
long term loss of dpp4 activity leads to the accumulation of plasma glp - 1 level in dpp4 - deficient rats [ 11 ] , [ 28 ] , which may be partly associated with the improvement of glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes .
chronic deficiency of dpp4 activity may improve glucose utilization , which may therefore result in a resistance of cardiomyoyctes to oxidative stress .
activation of akt may preserve cardiac function during oxidative stress , and reduce myocyte apoptosis [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] .
inhibition of akt signaling by pi3k / akt inhibitor or genetic deletion abrogated the protective effect ( mullonkal and toledo - pereyra 2007 ) .
activation of pi3k by glp - 1 was required to prevent proapoptotic events exposed to h2o2 in several kinds of culture cell [ 3 ] , [ 33 ] .
glp - 1 receptor agonist was shown to activate pi3k / akt signaling to improve cell viability after hypoxia / reoxygenation treatment in isolated neonatal cardiomyocyte [ 6 ] .
in our study , activation of pi3k was required to prevent cell death in response to h2o2 .
elevation of p - akt was associated with the amelioration of cell injury , while pi3k inhibitor reduced p - akt and caused reduction of cell viability in both dpp4 - deficient and glp - 1 treated wild - type cardiomyocytes .
since akt pathway is involved in h2o2 - mediated glut4 translocation and glucose uptake stimulation [ 27 ] , [ 34 ] , akt activation in glp - 1 pathway and dpp4 deficiency may contribute to enhance glucose uptake and increase the resistance to oxidative stress .
glp - 1 activated akt signaling through its receptor - dependent pathway , but failed to cause further activation of akt in dpp4 - deficient cadiomyocytes after h2o2 exposure .
we can not detect any auto - release of glp - 1 in cultured medium of dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes ( data not shown ) , and the mechanisms involved in the activation of akt in dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes remains unclear .
dpp4 is known to exert its effects via both enzymatic and non - enzymatic mechanisms [ 35 ] .
the non - enzymatic function of dpp4 may also regulate inflammatory responses in immune system , and its inhibition may have a role in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis [ 35 ] .
long term deficiency of dpp4 may modulate inflammatory response in cardiomyocytes , and may contribute to the akt activation in response to oxidative stress .
ros trigger the activation of multiple signaling pathways , instead of akt pathway , erk pathway is also induced in response to oxidative stress and plays an important role in regulating cell survival [ 36 ] .
several studies have shown that erk activation prevents cell injury induced by h2o2 [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
in our study , h2o2 treatment caused a marked activation of erk , while cotreatment with pd98059 , a mek kinase inhibitor , resulted in losing of cell viability , implying that erk is an important survival pathway in cardiomyocyte under oxidative stress .
although glp - 1 or dpp4 deficiency did not alter the expression of p - erk , erk signaling can not be excluded in the glp - 1 and dpp4 defiiciency signaling for counteracting oxidative stress in cardiomyocyte .
in fact , glp - 1 receptor agonist was shown to exert protective actions against hypoxia / reoxygenation induced cell death in isolated neonatal cardiomyocyte via erk - dependent pathway [ 6 ] .
glp - 1 also mediates antiapoptotic effect by phosphorylating bad through a beta - arrestin 1 - mediated erk1 / 2 activation in pancreaticbeta - cells [ 39 ] .
glp - 1 receptor can trigger the generation of the second messenger camp and followed by activation of pka [ 40 ] .
our data supported the importance of glp - 1 receptor signaling pathway in the alleviation of cell apoptosis after h2o2 exposure , by preserving catalase activity , alleviating of ros level , bax / bcl2 ratio , and caspase - 3 activity .
the protective effect of glp - 1 is pka - dependent , since the improvement of cell viability of glp - 1 after h2o2 exposure in wild - type cardiomyocyte was blocked by h89 , a pka inhibitor .
in correlated with other studies , glp - 1 was shown to have an anti - apoptotic action mediated by a camp / pka - dependent signaling pathway in pancreatic betacell and endothelial cell [ 3 ] , [ 5 ] .
in addition , activation of pi3k / akt can be achieved by activation of pka [ 41 ] , and a direct interaction of pka and akt was also found in glp - 1 action [ 3 ] .
glp - 1 receptor antagonist was shown to abolish the elevation of akt phosphorylation in response to h2o2 in wild - type cardiomyocyte .
although the activation of akt by pka was not completely understood in the present study , our data favor the idea that glp - 1 receptor - pka - akt activation pathway is required in the protective signaling of glp - 1 in wild - type cardiomyocytes .
however , it has been shown that glp - 1 improved cardiac function after i / r in glp - 1 receptor knock - out langendorff - perfused heart [ 29 ] .
an inactive cleaved form of glp - 1 , glp - 1 ( 9 - 36 ) , was also shown to have an anti - apoptotic effects in cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells in a alternative receptor [ 6 ] , [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] .
the role of glp - 1 ( 9 - 36 ) can not be excluded in this study .
our limitation of the study is that dpp4 - deficient cardiomyocytes retained one third level of dpp4 activity , which is similar to that reported in a recent paper [ 44 ] .
the maximal inhibition concentration of ditropin a also retained one third level of dpp4 activity .
there are several subtypes of dpp , which may also cleavage gly - pro - amc , the synthetic substrate of dpp4 [ 45 ] .
the non - specific cleavage of gly - pro - amc can not be excluded in the dpp4 activity study .
in conclusion , glp - 1 exerted protective effect against ros stress via receptor - dependent akt pathway .
long term deficiency of dpp4 induces changes of cellular function , and increase the capability against oxidative stress via enhancing akt signaling and glucose uptake in association with preserving catalase activity , probably via both glp - 1 receptor - dependent and - independent signaling .

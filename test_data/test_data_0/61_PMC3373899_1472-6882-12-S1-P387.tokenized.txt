methods this paper uses data from two separate community groups .
focus groups with volunteers aged over 58 explored perceptions of health and wellbeing .
they were carried out in two community centers in southwest ( 3 focus groups ) and northeast london ( 1 focus group ) .
the first three groups specifically targeted healthcare decision making , and the fourth covered the experiences of participants in a taiji class .
data was content analyzed using framework analysis and atlas ti. results thirty - seven people participated in the three decision - making focus groups , 8 in the taiji group .
regarding decision - making , five themes emerged ; physical wellbeing , impact on activity , emotional issues , community and health services , and keeping positive .
a range of cam was used , commonly mind / body or physical therapies .
the main reason was to ' keep going ' and maintain wellbeing .
conventional medicine was perceived as central to wellbeing , with cam used to address its limitations .
decision making was rarely systematic ; anecdotal information dominated , and disclosure to conventional practitioners was uncommon .
results from the taiji focus group reinforced these themes and the importance of cam ( taiji ) as a ' tool ' for coping with day - to - day problems , perceived as helpful for mobility , sleep and relaxation .
conclusion ' keeping going ' is important for older people and often promoted by cam , including manipulative and exercise therapies such as taiji .
concurrent cam and conventional medication use , unreliable information and insufficient discussion with conventional providers may have safety implications .
older people perceive great benefit from cam such as taiji , and often use it as a self - management tool .
healthcare practitioners should consider exploring cam use with older people and facilitating access to cam information .
asking older people about cam use may be integral to providing holistic , safe care .

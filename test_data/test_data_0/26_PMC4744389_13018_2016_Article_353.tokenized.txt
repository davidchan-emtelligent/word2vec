background surgical treatment of long - bone metastases requires a comprehensive approach .
the indications for surgery are based on the patient 's general condition , type and stage of cancer , and survival time expectancy .
tumor modular endoprostheses have been increasingly used .
surgery should provide pain relief and improve the quality of life .
methods between 2010 and 2013 , 67 patients with malignant metastases were surgically treated with resection prostheses .
we performed a retrospective analysis of the indications for the surgery , its course , the type of the prostheses used , and the implantation techniques applied .
we evaluated the most important clinical parameters influencing the postoperative quality of life of the patients .
results breast , prostate , and lung cancers are the most common primary tumors that metastasize to bones .
the most common site of the lesions is the proximal femur ; sporadically , they do occur in bones distal to the knee and elbow .
after the surgery , all the patients could walk , most of them without crutches .
the pain , rated on a vas scale , decreased significantly , and the karnofsky score improved .
we observed that joint mobility and the strength of the muscles in the limbs allowed for normal functioning .
postoperative complications including infections and local tumor recurrences were rarely observed .
conclusions the use of modular prostheses is an adequate method of treatment in patients with bone metastases .
a radical resection of the tumor , which prevents local recurrences and loosening of implants , gives good outcomes .
reduced joint mobility resulting from muscle attachment cutting is well tolerated and concerns mainly patients that underwent operations on the humerus .
keywords bone metastases bone tumor resection postresectional bone alloplasty modular prostheses bone radiotherapy grzegorz guzikissue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background a significant progress in oncology has resulted in the prolonged survival of patients with myeloma as well as breast , prostate , kidney , and thyroid cancer , but the incidence of bone metastasis has risen .
most patients with bone metastases need a combination of surgical and oncological treatment .
the disease is associated with general bad condition , pain , reduced mobility , trouble walking and working , and problems with independent functioning .
often , the patients have to give up their independent living and move to care facilities .
in the case of large , lytic tumors posing a risk of pathological fractures and the already existing fractures , radiotherapy is ineffective [ 1 - 3 ] .
bone metastases most commonly affect the axial skeleton involving the vertebral column , ribs , pelvis , and the proximal femur and humerus .
in most cases of bone metastases , bone resorption and formation processes coexist .
the predominance of one process over the other determines the type of metastasis .
sclerotic lesions , almost exclusively arising from the prostatic carcinoma , are rarely an indication for surgical treatment .
lytic and mixed metastases occur most frequently and pose a risk of pathological fractures when involving load - bearing bones [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] .
it is very important to perform the surgery before fracture occurs .
standard radiograms provide sufficient information about the structure of the bone and the risk of a pathological fracture which is quantified in mirel 's scoring system .
in the case of the involvement of the vertebral column or the pelvis , ct scans and mri prior to the surgery are recommended for the more precise evaluation of the extent of the lesions and thus appropriate planning of the surgery [ 1 , 5 ] .
the qualification for surgery should be multifaceted with account being taken of the age of the patient , general condition and the type , staging , and grading of cancer .
patients in poor general condition and with poor survival prognosis are referred for palliative care .
in such cases , it is usually agreed not to perform metastatic tumor resection but to stabilize the fracture , which is followed by radiotherapy .
patients with better prognoses undergo resections of the metastatic tumor , which significantly decrease pain and reduce the risk of local recurrences .
the use of tumor endoprosthesis should provide effective and fast pain relief , early mobilization , and longer implants survival .
however , the use of megaprostheses has some drawbacks , such as a high risk of infections arising in surgical wounds and reduced functions of the limbs due to damaged muscle attachments [ 1 , 6 - 8 ] .
methods over the period 2010 - 2013 at the orthopaedic department in brzozow , 67 long - bone metastatic tumor resections combined with modular prostheses implantations were performed .
the implants used at our department were gmrs , stryker ( 28 ) and mutars , implantcast ( 39 ) .
we analyzed the medical records of the patients with special attention being given to the type and the stage of cancer , the duration of the disease , the type of treatment , and the prognosis .
what was also assessed was the general condition of the patients , the location and the intensity of pain rated by vas , karnofsky performance status score in patients , their joint mobility and ability to move , and the provided orthopedic equipment .
before the surgery , radiographic examinations in two projections were conducted .
in the cases of particularly large or histopathologically unconfirmed tumors , we carried out ct and mri scans of the involved regions to assess the size and location of the tumor , bone tissue , and cortical layer condition as well as the involvement of the medullary cavity .
no vascular angiography of the tumor was performed .
the analysis of preoperative imaging tests always involved precise planning of the surgical approach and the evaluation of the extent of bone and soft tissue resection .
tumor resections were made with a wide margin just like in the cases of primary bone tumors .
after the surgery , we assessed the intensity of pain with vas as well as the limb vasculature and innervation .
rehabilitation records were reviewed considering the time when the walking and postoperative kinesitherapy was started and the provided orthopedic equipment .
the passive and active range of joint motion was evaluated 14 days and 3 months after the surgery .
we also considered the efficiency of different muscle groups , pain intensity , and the karnofsky performance status score in patients .
on the second , the 14th day , and 3 months after the surgery , radiographic signs were analyzed in the context of the risk associated with recurrence or implant loosening .
the patients are under the medical care of orthopedists with follow - up visits repeated at 3 - month intervals .
the research has been performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki .
as this retrospective analysis consists of anonymised clinical routine data , the research ethics committee ( okregowa izba lekarska in crakov , ul krupnicza ) deems the application for and issue of an ethics approval not necessary .
all the patients gave a written consent to the use of data for research .
results most patients ( 41 ) were women , and 26 were men .
the average age of women was 67 , and of men 69 .
the mean length of the monitoring period was 2.3 years ( range 3.6 - 1.4 years ) .
so far , 21 patients have died .
pathological fractures were diagnosed in 61 patients .
in six patients , the size of the metastasis suggested a high risk of a fracture .
in all the patients with no detected fractures , the lesions involved the proximal area of the femur .
lytic lesions were noted in 66 cases ( fig 1 ) , and a sclerotic lesion in one case .
large soft tissue tumors were diagnosed in 52 patients. fig. 1 typical indications for modular endoprosthetic replacement in the distal femur .
bone destruction by metastatic breast carcinoma ( a , b ) and radiograph of the modular endoprosthetic replacement ( c ) the incidence of primary cancers presented itself as follows : breast cancer ( 32 patients ) , myeloma ( 12 patients ) , kidney cancer ( 11 patients ) , bowel cancer ( 2 patients ) , thyroid cancer ( 2 patients ) , lung cancer ( 2 patients ) , prostate cancer ( 1 patient ) , and cancer of unknown primary site ( 5 cases ) .
the patients in whom the pathological fracture was the first symptom of neoplastic disease underwent biopsy and the surgery was postponed until its results were obtained ( fig 2 ) .
in all the five cases , the histopathological examination confirmed the metastatic bone tumor. with regard to the diagnosis , kidney cancer was detected in two cases , and lung cancer in one case .
in the remaining two cases , it was not possible to precisely determine the primary site of the neoplasm which revealed itself as adenocarcinoma in the histopathological analysis ( table 1 ). fig. 2 radiographs of proximal femur destruction by metastatic renal cancer ( a ) and modular endoprosthetic replacement ( b ) table 1 metastatic cancer type correlated with a modular prosthesis used cancer type proximal femur distal femur total femur proximal tibia proximal humerus total humerus breast cancer 23 3 1 3 2 myeloma 9 1 1 1 kidney cancer 6 1 3 1 colon cancer 2 thyroid cancer 2 lung cancer 1 1 prostate cancer 1 unknown site 2 1 1 1 the implanted prostheses included : 2 total humerus prostheses , 7 proximal humerus prostheses , 45 proximal femur prostheses , 6 distal femur prostheses , 2 total femur prostheses , and 5 proximal tibia prostheses ( table 2 ) .

the position of the limb was forced , and the presence of various deformities was detected ( shortening , bent axis , thickened contour ) .
any attempts at moving resulted in a strong pain .
no symptoms of ischemia or damage to peripheral nerves were detected .
six patients with extensive lytic lesions in the lower limb were walking with the support of walking frames .
the mobility of joints was reduced due to pain .
attempts made in a lying position at lifting the leg above the bed and extending the knee caused pain or were impossible .
metastases in the upper extremity did not affect the patients' ability to walk .
the patients were immobilized in dessault vests or plaster splints .
also in this group , symptoms of ischemia or damage to peripheral nerves were not observed ( fig 3 ). fig. 3 radiographs of proximal humerus destruction by myeloma ( a ) and modular endoprosthetic replacement ( b ) bone and soft tissue resections were wide margin .
there was no need to perform large vessel or nerve resections , with an exception of four patients with the axillary nerve situated in the tumor area .
in any of the patients , the cancer did not infiltrate the skin , so it was not necessary to perform excision followed by reconstruction with flaps .
the extent of bone resections ranging from the minimum of 6 cm in the humerus and the tibia and the maximum of 22 cm in the femur is shown below ( table 4 ) .

the mean pain intensity score by vas in patients after lower extremity surgeries was 3.8 and 3.1 in patients after upper extremity surgeries .
the mean karnofsky performance score was 65 in patients after lower extremity surgeries and 75 in patients after upper extremity surgeries .
in a group of 58 patients with metastases to lower extremities , 12 have been walking normally without the support of crutches .
those are the patients with implants in the following regions : the proximal area of the femur ( 6 patients ) , the distal area of the femur ( 5 patients ) , and the proximal area of the tibia ( 1 patient ) .
thirty - nine patients have been using only one crutch or stick when walking longer distances , while seven patients have been walking with both crutches .
in each patient , a significant decrease in the strength of muscles in the operated extremity was observed .
the postoperative passive joint mobility was relatively good , but active joint mobility was significantly reduced in the patients who underwent the surgery of the arm .
the mean flexion of the arm was 70degrees , the mean extension 47degrees , internal rotation achieved 30degrees , and external 15degrees of movement .
trendelenburg 's sign was clearly positive in patients after femur surgeries which was indicative of gluteal muscle dysfunction .
the patients were able to manage the stairs either alternating feet ( 47 patients ) or reverting to each step ( 11 patients ) .
we observed no contractures of a knee joint which normally cause trouble getting up from a chair or make it impossible .
the loss of range of knee motion was observed as extension deficit to 10degrees and flexion to 40degrees .
during each of the proximal tibia resections , the patellar ligament was sutured to a reversed flap obtained from the medial head of the triceps muscle .
the limb was immobilized in a brace for 6 weeks , and after that , time rehabilitation was started to improve the function of a knee extensor .
each time , a full knee extension range of motion was achieved .
no pathological fractures occurred in the same bone during the hospitalization .
complications involving loosening of an implant occurred in one patient ( a case summarized below ) .
operative wound revision was necessary in two patients .
the wounds were cleared from the granulation tissue , irrigated with betadine solution , and the garamycin sponge was implanted .
intraoperative evaluations were culture - negative .
the wounds healed without further complications .
operative prosthesis revision was required in one case and simultaneous implantation of a new prosthesis was performed .
the surgical wound healed by primary intention within 2 weeks after the revision procedure .
in the remaining three cases , minor surgical wound infections were treated with intravenous antibiotic therapy without surgical intervention .
no thromboembolic complications were observed .
in one patient with renal clear - cell carcinoma , a massive local recurrence of the neoplasm occurred in the thigh 3 months after the surgery .
the patient died after 5 months ( fig. 4 ). fig. 4 chronologically arranged radiograms of kidney cancer metastases to the proximal femur ( a ) after resection of bone tumor and modular prosthesis implantation ( b ) .
next , the radiogram ( c ) shows the postoperative recurrence of the disease .
a coronal view from an mri ( d ) shows a large tumor involving the whole thigh .
there is visible damage to the femur and a loose prosthesis in three other patients , minor local recurrences occurred .
the patients were referred for palliative radiotherapy which resulted in the stability of the disease confirmed by the radiological examination .
no dislocations of the prostheses were noted .
one patient required lumic prosthesis implantation due to acetabular fracture after falling down .
discussion conventional osteosynthesis ( fixation with an intramedullary nail or plates with or without bone cement ) have represented a common option for surgical management of metastatic lesions [ 9 - 11 ] .
another possible choice of treatment that has been increasingly used is modular prostheses due to possibly long survival time in patients with myeloma and other metastatic cancers ( breast , prostate , kidney , bowel , or thyroid cancer ) [ 12 - 17 ]. with the progress in oncology , a significant number of malignant cancers , particularly those metastasizing to bones , have become chronic [ 18 - 21 ] .
technological developments in other fields , including material science , anesthesiology and surgical techniques , have made it possible to use large prostheses with an acceptable risk of complications .
materials used in a manufacturing process are increasingly better and biocompatible ; therefore , the incidence of allergic reactions and intolerance symptoms has been lower .
the comparisons of various surgical treatment options , osteosynthesis ( with or without pmma ) and the prosthesis implantation , clearly indicate the superiority of the latter as presented in literature ( fig 5 ) [ 18 , 20 , 21 ]. fig. 5 failed fixation ( gamma nail with pmma ) of a proximal femoral fracture due to breast cancer metastasis ( a ) and radiographs after modular endoprosthesis replacement ( b ) the survival rate of the patients with modular prostheses after radical resections of metastatic tumors is higher when compared to the patients that underwent outdated standard treatment .
the overall survival rate is sometimes as high as 37 months , which obviously varies in different cases , depending on the type of cancer , the grade of malignancy , the stage of the disease , and the methods of treatment [ 19 - 22 ] .
most studies have found that treatment results are better in cases where pathological fractures have never occurred which result from an easier technique of resection and a lower incidence of recurrences .
thus , it is recommended to perform a surgery in all the cases where metastases posing a risk of fracture were diagnosed .
clinical and radiological criteria for determining the risk of pathological fracture are now widely known .
it should be kept in mind that a particularly high risk is associated with bones subject to heavy loading ( the femur , the tibia , and the vertebral column ) [ 18 , 21 , 23 ] .
the recurrence rate in patients after long - bone metastatic tumor resections ranges from 4 to 28 % .
the most important objective seems to be a wide margin with a cuff of healthy tissues which is a condition necessary for effective treatment [ 6 , 8 , 21 , 22 , 24 ] .
one should consider the possibilities of adjuvant treatment , especially the use of radiation therapy and bisphosphonates .
in the past , radiotherapy was a method of choice in treating bone metastases , particularly to the spine and the pelvis .
currently it is important as a method of reducing pain in 50 - 85 % of patients as well as reducing the incidence of local recurrences after surgeries .
bisphosphonates are also effective in pain reduction , and they significantly reduce the number of pathological fractures by 25 - 50 % .
they are particularly often used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer , prostate cancer , and multiple myeloma ) [ 4 , 6 , 7 , 25 ] .
in the case of the metastases of kidney cancer , thyroid cancer , and myeloma , a trans - arterial embolization ( tae ) can be performed .
this procedure limits vascularization of the tumor , which results in a twofold or even threefold reduction in bleeding during the surgery , and the operation time is reduced by about 25 % .
many authors have confirmed the effectiveness of this treatment method in reducing pain and number of local recurrences after resection of the tumor .
reduced intraoperative bleeding allows for more precise preparation of tissues and resection of lesions .
according to some authors , embolization increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy .
we have not performed preoperative embolization of tumors localized in the extremities at our department .
this procedure has been performed exclusively when the tumor was localized in the pelvis and the spine [ 26 - 28 ] .
the indications for amputation due to cancer metastases are extremely rare .
it is performed in the case of large metastatic tumors infiltrating the vascular and nerve trunks or skin when limb - salvage treatment is not possible .
an indication for amputation may be extensive inflammation of bone and soft tissues that is localized within the site of a former prosthetic implantation and which is impossible to treat [ 2 , 3 , 18 ] .
the present study clearly indicates that most metastases occur in the proximal area of the femur .
metastases in other sites are less frequent ; very rarely do they occur in the area below the elbow or knee joint .
breast cancer is the most metastatic ( fig 6 ) .
prostate cancer metastases , frequent as they are , rarely necessitate surgical treatment because of a relatively low risk of a fracture. fig. 6 radiographs of proximal humerus destruction by metastatic breast cancer ( a ) and after modular endoprosthetic replacement ( b ) most common complications that may follow modular alloplasty are surgical wound infections [ 29 , 30 ] .
patients constitute a group at the highest risk of infectious and thromboembolic complications because the surgeries are most often urgent , therefore , mrsa screening or other pathogen detection tests are rarely carried out .
there are no clear recommendations as to the routine local antibiotic therapy in the case of primary resection alloplasty .
a rate of infectious complications ranges between 1.2 and 19.5 % .
preoperative radiotherapy is seen as one of the major risk factors for developing infections .
major risk factors include : decreased immunity as a result of neoplastic disease and chemotherapy , wide surgical approach with significant blood loss , and the size of metal implants .
worse still , the patients are usually elderly and with various general health problems .
other potential complications include dislocation or loosening of the implants and periprosthetic fractures .
revision procedures are required in 3 - 17 % of patients [ 31 , 32 ] .
the procedures concerning preparation and implantation of gmrs and mutars prostheses differ .
the mutars prostheses allow for a smooth rotation of the prosthesis stem .
what is more , surgical management of the bone marrow canal is carried out not by reaming , but by rasping .
the stems are bent , which minimizes the risk of damaging the cortical bone while driving them .
the prostheses have a golden and silver coating , which reduces the incidence of infectious complications and allergic reactions .
functional results of modular alloplasty are satisfactory , especially in patients after proximal and distal femur resections .
decreased gluteal muscles function was not a big problem to patients .
most of the patients walk efficiently without crutches .
a slight limb length discrepancy was not noticed by the patients and did not affect their walking .
the quality of life of the patients after metastasis resections and implantations of modular prostheses improved significantly .
the vas and karnofsky scales showed clearly reduced pain and improved functioning .
conclusions modular tumor endoprosthesis may be an option in surgical treatment of long - bone metastases providing fast pain relief and early mobilization .
radical metastatic tumor resection is a condition necessary for a good treatment outcome .
it prevents local recurrences and damage to implant or its loosening .
proximal humerus resections result in a reduced shoulder mobility and weakening of muscle strength which impair normal limb functions .
the incidence rate of infections in patients after modular prostheses implantations varies .
efforts should be directed at preventing infectious complications because they are very difficult to treat .

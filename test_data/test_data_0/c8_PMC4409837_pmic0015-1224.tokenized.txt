we describe a " gel - assisted " proteomic sample preparation method for ms analysis .
solubilized protein extracts or intact cells are copolymerized with acrylamide , facilitating denaturation , reduction , quantitative cysteine alkylation , and matrix formation .
gel - aided sample preparation has been optimized to be highly flexible , scalable , and to allow reproducible sample generation from 50 cells to milligrams of protein extracts .
this methodology is fast , sensitive , easy - to - use on a wide range of sample types , and accessible to nonspecialists .
bottom - up proteomics comparative proteomics gel - assisted sample preparation sample preparation technology bottom - up or " shotgun " proteomics has a profound impact on modern biology and biomedical research , providing molecular windows underlying biological processes [ 1 ] .
such experiments essentially rely on the proteolytic digestion of biological material ( e.g. , protein extracts ) as ms / ms - based sequencing of peptides remain the primary analytical approach using ms. the two major sample preparation strategies include in - solution [ 2 ] and in - gel protocols [ 3,4 ] , and they have recently been extended by filter - based [ 5,6 ] and pipette tip based methods [ 7 ] .
these yielded increased sensitivity over conventional methods and allow compatibility with strong denaturants , such as sds to maximize protein solubilization , in particular of membrane and chromatin - associated proteins .
in - gel sample preparation is employed after the gel electrophoresis based separation of proteins and is widely used even outside laboratories specialized on proteome analysis .
in - solution protocols are technically more challenging and usually involve chaotropic reagents , such as urea , to increase the solubilization of proteins , and are applied to analyze the " deep proteome " in shotgun / bottom - up proteomics [ 8 ] .
in - gel sample preparation has been applied to copolymerized protein extracts in glass capillaries ( tube - gel ) by lu and zhu [ 4 ] to solubilize hydrophobic proteins from membrane preparations , leading to the development of a variety of " gel - assisted " [ 9 - 14 ] methods in which electrophoretic separation in a polyacrylamide matrix is omitted and the function of the polymer matrix is diminished to the effective containment and retention of protein material for washing and digestion steps .
gel - assisted approaches have been applied predominantly to homogenized and lysed tissue samples ( brain [ 11 ] , breast [ 12 ] , or colon [ 13 ]) in the search for biomarkers focusing on membrane proteins and in combination with label - free and itraq quantitation to exploit the solubilization of transmembrane , raft , and exosomal [ 14 ] proteins by gel - assisted methods .
we developed a gel - assisted method that was optimized and simplified compared to previous protocols [ 4,9 - 14 ] , in which the complete and fast reaction of cysteine residues with monomeric acrylamide to form cys - s - beta - propionamide ( pam - cys ) [ 15 ] replaces the alkylation of cysteine residues with reagents , such as iodoacetamide or 2 - chloroacetamide , that require additional processing steps .
the proposed method limits the contact with the sample to a minimum to avoid contamination ; minimizes sample loss ; and is robust , scalable , sensitive , and easy to use for nonspecialists .
we reasoned that the resulting method would have similar advantages as compared to " filter - aided " protocols , such as compatibility with high concentrations of detergents ( i.e. , sds ) and highly effective proteolysis or increased sensitivity over conventional in - solution methods .
besides the different mechanism for protein retention ( filter vs. gel matrix ) as demonstrated by lu and zhu [ 4 ] , the working principle and workflow is very similar to " filter - aided sample preparation " ( fasp ) , hence the use of an analogue acronym " gel - aided sample preparation " ( gasp ) .
however , fasp has limitations in total protein input , ease of use ( i.e. , repeated long centrifugation steps ) , or robustness ( i.e. , filter clogging or failure ) .
we propose that gel - assisted methods do not suffer from these limitations and showcase gasp as an alternative to filter - assisted and in - solution methods , generating proteomic samples for ms analysis of equal or higher quality .
the essential elements of gasp are as follows : ( i ) protein extraction in presence of reducing agent , such as dtt , ( ii ) copolymerization of proteins with monomeric acrylamide , ( iii ) shredding of gel plug to increase surface area , ( iv ) depletion of small molecules , such as detergents and inhibitors , ( v ) proteolysis , and ( vi ) peptide recovery ( fig.1a ) .
lc - ms / ms analysis was performed using a linear ion trap - orbitrap instrument ( orbitrap velos , thermo scientific ) [ 15 ] or a hybrid quadrupole - orbitrap instrument ( q exactive , thermo scientific ) [ 16 ] ( details available in the supporting information methods section ) .
for the cutting of the gel plug into smaller pieces , we recommend a pulse centrifugation of the gel through a plastic grid , which can be obtained by removing the filter membrane from spinx ( corning ) filtering devices fitting into 1.5 ml tubes ( i.e. , by dissolving a cellulose acetate membrane in acetone ) or using the also available version without filter membrane .
this step is necessary to increase the effective surface area of the gel matrix for buffer exchange .
the principle has been described by lazarev et al .
[ 17 ] using a hand - made device .
for data analysis , we used different search algorithms ( peaks , proteinpilot , and mascot ) to address specific experimental questions ( for details see supporting information methods ) .
figure 1 gel - aided sample preparation ( gasp ) workflow .
( a ) cell or tissue extracts are prepared in the presence of dtt to reduce disulphide bridges .
acrylamide / bis - acrylamide solution is added to a final concentration of 20 % , by which cysteine residues are converted quantitatively to pam - cys ( propionamide ) .
polymerization is initiated by adding temed and ammonium persulfate .
the gel block is then cut into small pieces by centrifugation through a plastic mesh to remove detergents and chaotropic reagents by further processing as in regular in - gel protocols ( for details see supporting information methods ) .
gasp can be easily adapted to process high protein amounts , cell extracts , or intact cells .
( b ) comparison of gasp at different acrylamide concentrations .
the summed ion counts of identified , binned proteins show increased protein immobilization at higher acrylamide concentrations .
the profile of identified proteins is similar to the mass distribution in the human proteome ( secondary axis ) .
( c ) the summed ion counts of identified , binned peptides show better peptide recovery at higher acrylamide concentrations , due to the better immobilization of proteins .
( d ) gasp needs to negotiate protein immobilization and peptide recovery .
at an acrylamide concentration higher than 18 % , peptide recovery plateaus , while protein immobilization is further improved at 20 % .
as a compromise , we chose an acrylamide concentration of 20 % for all further experiments .
in previous publications [ 4,9 - 14 ] , acrylamide concentrations of <= 10 % were used to immobilize proteins in a gel matrix , suggesting that peptide recovery may be the rate - limiting step for a sensitive detection of proteins rather than protein immobilization .
to further optimize " gel - assisted " protein sample preparation , we evaluated the impact of the acrylamide concentration on the contrarian objectives " protein immobilization " and " peptide recovery " ( fig.1b to d ) .
the pore size of the polyacrylamide matrix varies depending on the concentration of bis - acrylamide [ 18 ] .
to analyze whether the pore size has a selective effect on the molecular weight of the immobilized proteins , we compared the molecular weight of proteins identified by ms / ms after conducting gasp , using different bis - acrylamide concentrations ( fig.1b ) .
as readout , we used the summed peptide ion intensities per protein , grouped into protein molecular weight bins .
the measured protein intensities correlated with the used acrylamide concentration over the whole mass range with less prominent differences in the very high and very low molecular weight of proteins .
we observed better immobilization of proteins at higher acrylamide concentrations independent of molecular mass , which is probably a consequence of the smaller pore size of the polyacrylamide matrix .
interestingly , if compared to the binned number of human proteins in uniprot ( 20 264 entries , 04 / 2014 ) , the number of proteins in the database correlated well with the intensities of the identified proteins per mass range at all acrylamide concentrations examined ( fig.1b , secondary axis ) , possibly because the copy number of a large proportion of proteins are within a limited dynamic range [ 7 ] .
the recovery of the peptides after in - gel digest has always been a concern as it depends on their size / hydrophobicity and the pore size of the gel matrix .
to address if the acrylamide concentration in gasp introduces a systematic bias towards the size and amount of identified peptides , we plotted summed peptides intensities in mass bins ( fig.1c ) .
our results show that the summed ion intensity of the recovered peptides is higher with increased acrylamide concentration .
this is somewhat surprising as a better recovery with a greater pore size of the gel matrix ( lower acrylamide concentration ) would be expected .
we also noticed that the size of gel pieces after shredding is smaller when higher acrylamide concentrations are used .
this effect could contribute to the observed results .
however , with a smaller pore size , more total protein is immobilized ( see above and fig.1b ) .
therefore , peptide recovery not only depends on the pore size , but also on the protein amount immobilized .
we plotted the total ion intensities of immobilized proteins versus recovered peptides and calculated the peptide / protein intensity ratio at different acrylamide concentrations ( fig.1d ) , revealing that 18 - 20 % acrylamide concentration is optimal for protein immobilization and at the same time maximal peptide recovery .
our results suggest that the better retention of proteins at higher acrylamide concentrations outweighs a decreased peptide recovery at higher acrylamide concentrations .
as we positioned gasp as an alternative to in - solution and fasp methods , we compared the three methods with 100 mug of a total cell extract prepared with 1 % np - 40 ( in - solution ) or 4 % sds ( fasp , gasp ) .
the mechanistically most unrestricted approach regarding protein / peptide size and substrate retention in a lysate should be the in - solution digest as no filtering / immobilization steps are involved .
we therefore compared the mass distributions of proteins identified from gasp and fasp prepared samples with in - solution digestion , and found them to be comparable ( supporting information fig. 1 ) .
therefore , none of the methods introduces a systematic bias towards protein size .
we also compared gasp with fasp and in - solution methods for overall protein identification and spectrum usage and observed that all methods yielded comparable results ( supporting information table 1 ) regarding number of identified peptides / proteins and subcellular localization of identified proteins .
fasp requires a centrifugation of peptides through a molecular weight cut - off filter , while in gasp peptides have to be extracted from the gel matrix .
we tested whether fasp and gasp introduce a bias towards molecular weight of eluted peptides ( supporting information fig. 2 ) or their hydrophobicity ( supporting information fig. 3 ) as compared to in - solution protocols .
all three methods exhibit the same profile when plotting summed peptide intensities over mass bins .
however , we noted that the observed peptide intensities using fasp and gasp are about five times higher compared with in - solution digest despite using the same amount of starting material , possibly due to less effective digest in solution .
consistent with this , fasp and gasp produced less missed cleavage sites than in - solution digest , pointing towards a better solubilization and increased accessibility of cleavage sites to trypsin in those samples .
the mean protein coverage was increased in the gasp processed sample ( 24.9 %) over in - solution ( 24.2 %) and fasp ( 22.7 %) processing .
in summary , these results suggest that gasp and fasp produce samples of similar abundance and quality from total cell extracts .
we expected an increased number of membrane protein ids with fasp or gasp due to better solubilization over the in - solution digest , but could not verify this in our data .
one particular feature of gasp is the embedment of cysteine alkylation as part of the process of polyacrylamide matrix formation .
to assess not only the completeness of conversion of cysteine to pam - cys , but also to evaluate the formation of other adducts in presence of monomeric acrylamide or ammonium persulfate , we analyzed the data with proteinpilot ( pp , v4.0 , absciex ) ( supporting information table 2 ) , a software that uses the paragon algorithm [ 19 ] and is capable to detect unexpected modifications in addition to systematic mass shifts on peptides in an unbiased way .
all samples that have been reduced with dtt and alkylated with iodoacetamide achieved high efficiency ( 99.69 % for in - solution digest and 100 % for fasp ) .
however , we observed undesired side reactions , such as carbamylation and carbamidomethylation of n - termini , or carbamidomethylation of lysine and some other amino acid residues , interfering with their identification using traditional search algorithms such as mascot and sequest with standard search parameters .
the modification of cysteine with monomeric acrylamide during the gasp protocol is almost complete ( 99.83 %) .
interestingly , much less undesired side reactions were detected in the presence of chaotropes ( 6 m urea and 2 m thiourea ) .
we also noticed a markedly higher absolute number of cysteine - containing [ 20 ] peptides identified in the gasp sample as compared to the other protocols .
to evaluate the scalability of the method , we conducted gasp with different amounts of protein extract ranging from 100 ng to 100 mug in the same matrix volume of 100 mul ( fig.2a ) .
we analyzed relative amounts of the samples representing 100 ng on column for all conditions .
when starting with 100 ng of extract , we observed a decrease in protein identifications of approximately 40 % as compared to analyzing 10 % of a 1 mug gasp run , indicating minimal sample loss when performing gasp on amounts smaller than 1 mug of cell extract .
we also performed gasp using counted intact cells as starting material ranging from 50 to 10 000 cells .
cells were lysed using np - 40 / dtt buffer and copolymerized and further processed without clearing .
we were able to identify 316 proteins from as little as 50 cells ( fig.2b ) .
the number of identifications plateaus at 5000 cells partly due to undersampling of the ms instrumentation at the lc - ms settings used .
gasp can be scaled up easily as only the volume of the gel matrix needs to be adjusted .
we demonstrated the scalability of gasp with a 1000 mug sample , prepared in a gel matrix of 1000 mul ( fig.2b ) .
the identification of a similar number of proteins when injecting 0.01 % of this sample , which equals calculated 100 ng on column , demonstrates that gasp can be performed with higher amounts of cell extract at the same efficiency as with smaller protein amounts - - a result which may be difficult to reproduce with in - solution or filter - assisted methods .
figure 2 sensitivity and reproducibility of gasp with different sample amounts and types .
( a ) gasp was applied to cell extracts ranging from 100 ng to 50 mug in a gel volume of 100 mul and 1 mg in a gel volume of 1 ml in triplicates .
percentages of the generated samples to match 100 ng on column were analyzed with lc - ms. the number of identified proteins shows improving reproducibility with higher amounts of starting material (> 1mug ) .
( b ) scepter ( millipore ) counted cells were lysed and further processed with gasp .
we observed good sensitivity by identification of up to 316 proteins from only 50 cells starting material .
( c ) comparison between gasp applied to crude / uncleared cell lysate and intact cells ( cell gasp ) .
while subcellular profile of identified proteins is similar ( supporting information fig. 4 ) , the relative abundance of chromosome binding and organelle lumen derived proteins as well as the total number of identified proteins ( d ) is increased by cell gasp - based sample processing .
we propose that gasp can be used on a large variety of samples , such as ips , homogenized tissues , or small intact organs ( i.e. , malpighian tubules from drosphila , unpublished data ) .
to demonstrate the versatility of gasp , we copolymerized pbs suspended , intact cells directly ( cell gasp ) .
the sample was then processed in the same way as a cell extract ( see also supporting information methods ) .
we achieved an even higher number of protein ids than in the protein extracts from the same cell number ( equivalent of 5000 cells on column , fig.2d ) .
however , we observed that even though the subcellular profile of the sample is unchanged ( supporting information fig. 3 ) , the abundance of proteins derived from organelle lumen and chromosomes is increased in the sample when intact cells are processed with gasp ( fig.2c ) .
in summary , gasp combines the advantages of in - solution and filter - based methods with the simple , robust , and well - established protocols for in - gel sample preparation without the need of alkylation , precipitation , filtering , or electrophoresis steps .
gel - assisted methods - - pioneered originally by lu and zhu [ 4 ] - - have been used previously predominantly on membrane preparations using low acrylamide concentrations .
we demonstrate that a smaller pore size at 20 % acrylamide minimizes sample loss and enables a highly sensitive detection of proteins in total cell extracts from only 50 cells .
furthermore , gasp can be applied to intact cells or cell extracts between 1 and 1000 mug without loss in efficiency or sensitivity .
the gasp protocol can eliminate alkylation and even cell lysis steps from sample preparation for proteomics and is a simple way for producing high - quality samples for ms for nonspecialists .
in comparison to fasp , we did not observe significant differences in identified protein numbers and abundance , but found gasp less prone to sample loss ( filter failure , sds carry over ) in our hands and less time - consuming on smaller sample series .
clear advantages are the scalability and the omission of reduction / alkylation steps in gasp , as well as its application to intact cells .

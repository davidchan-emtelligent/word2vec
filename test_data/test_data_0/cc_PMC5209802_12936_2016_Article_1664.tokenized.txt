in most tropical areas , pregnant women are at increased risk of malaria , as a consequence of the massive sequestration of parasitized red blood cells in the placenta .
the placenta plays a key role in embryonic and fetal development as well as in maternal - fetal exchanges , and pregnancy - associated malaria may alter selected placenta functions that lead to stillbirth and low birth weight .
although there are several tools ( blood smear examination , rdt , pcr ) to diagnose malaria infection during pregnancy , there is currently no test to assess placenta dysfunction in the framework of pregnancy - associated malaria .
pregnancy - associated malaria shares many features with preeclampsia , an extensively studied disease .
various biomarkers associated with placental dysfunction have been identified as associated with preeclampsia .
several of these are inflammatory markers that lack of specificity .
a few seem more specific of placenta dysfunction , including s - endoglin and sflt1 , increased in the peripheral blood during preeclampsia .
the predictive value of these biomarkers should be studied in the context of pregnancy - associated malaria to evaluate their usefulness in identifying placental dysfunction during malaria .
these biomarkers should be considered to improve the diagnosis of placental dysfunction during malaria and pregnant women monitoring .
keywords biomarker pregnancy malaria preeclampsia dhu risks in pregnancyissue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background placenta and syncytiotrophoblast cells placenta is a new transitional organ essential to the preservation of pregnancy and fetal development .
it ensures maternal - fetal exchanges and is also involved in maternal tolerance of feto - paternal antigens .
in some species , including human , the placenta exerts hormonal functions that are required for the maintenance of gestation and fetal well - being .
during pregnancy , a vascular shunt is formed , and maternal blood crosses the myometrium via utero - placental arteries to invade the intervillous space under maternal blood pressure .
throughout pregnancy , syncytiotrophoblasts ( st ) evolves towards cellular death by apoptosis in the intervillous space .
their renewal is a continuous phenomenon , and is more pronounced in case of placental suffering .
st represent the first mother - fetal interface , and fulfil many functions .
they also have a major endocrine role by participating in the steroidogenesis and in the synthesis of pregnancy - specific hormones , human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) and human placental lactogen ( hpl ) .
hcg is a placentation early marker , and a functionality marker [ 1 , 2 ] .
finally , the st have an immuno - modulation function by allowing maternal tolerance in front of the semi - allogenic transplant of the feto - placental unit .
malaria infection plasmodium falciparum infection is contracted from an anopheles bite by injection of sporozoites , which quickly begin an intra - hepatocytic maturation phase .
merozoites are released from the hepatocyte and invade erythrocytes , beginning a 48 - h long erythrocytic cycle during which the parasite goes through several morphological stages , from ring to trophozoite and schizont [ 3 ] .
the key step during this erythrocytic cycle is the important trafficking of proteins .
indeed , p. falciparum - derived proteins are successively expressed , some are exported , and presented at the surface of infected erythrocytes ( ie ) cell membrane , leading to physical and morphological alterations of ie. ie shape and deformability are modified , and electron dense protrusions , the knobs , appear at their surface .
knob structure involves complex interactions between parasite proteins and the ie membrane cytoskeleton .
knobs are involved in the export of variant surface antigens ( vsas ) , such as p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein - 1 ( pfemp - 1 ) , mediating the adhesion of ie to endothelial cell receptors , a phenomenon required for the completion of the erythrocytic cycle .
pfemp - 1 is a highly variable protein , allowing the parasite to escape host immunity , and to specifically adhere to endothelial cells or to deep organs , such as the surface of the st at the intervillous spaces of the placenta .
this adhesion requires a specific receptor on the endothelial cell , which in the case of the st is chondroitin sulphate a ( csa ) [ 4 ]. by presenting these ligands , the parasite allows host immune recognition of the altered ie surface .
to evade the immune response , these proteins display extensive antigenic variation , concurrently changing the receptor recognition , and then the tissue tropism of the ie [ 5 ] .
one member of the pfemp - 1 family , var2csa , is specific of parasites encountered during pregnancy .
only the parasites expressing the var2csa variant are able to sequester in the placenta and those parasites cannot bind to receptors expressed elsewhere , therefore , they have never been able to multiply in the host before the first pregnancy , and no immune response against var2csa exists [ 6 ] .
the binding is strengthened by the attraction of their opposite charges and resists the maternal blood flow [ 7 ] .
the result is the adherence and accumulation of ie in the intervillous space .
this parasite adhesion to placental receptor csa is the initiator of the immune response to csa - binding ie , fundamental to the pregnancy - associated malaria ( pam ) pathogenesis .
pregnancy - associated malaria the sequestration of numerous ie in the placenta is responsible for inflammatory damages with fibrinoid deposits at its surface , similar to chronic intervillitis [ 8 ] .
these damages may alter the placenta functions and lead to delayed fetal growth .
malaria infection has pro - inflammatory effects , in particular on infected placentas where appear an oxidative stress and fibrin deposits .
ie sequestration leads to acute vascular modifications of placental villi , reducing the available surface for feto - placental exchanges .
this decrease may be correlated with intra - uterine growth retardation [ 9 , 10 ] .
the blood flow modifications by the accumulation of ies in the intervillous spaces originate st hypoxia and angiogenesis deregulation .
the long - term placental infringements may result in low birth weight , in utero fetal death , and important perinatal morbi - mortality [ 11 ] .
abnormal intra - uterine environment ( exchange defect and hypoxemia ) affects the cognitive , metabolic and anthropometric development of the fetus , which may lead to a greater risk of disease for the newborn child [ 12 ] .
in p. falciparum - infected pregnant women , ultrasound studies reported intra - uterine fetal growth restriction , and doppler analysis showed fetal brain vasodilatation , witness of hypoxia [ 13 ] .
current recommendations for pam diagnosis and prevention for pregnant women living in moderate to high malaria transmission areas , the world heath organization ( who ) recommends the use of long - lasting insecticide - impregnated bed nets and intermittent preventive treatment ( ipt ) which consists of a curative regimen of sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine , from the second half of pregnancy , during each antenatal visit providing those are spaced by at least one month .
this prevention allows to reduce the number of malaria attacks during pregnancy , the placental sequestration , and the fetal consequences [ 14 ] .
nevertheless , ipt is only partially effective in preventing malaria infection during pregnancy and its consequences , due to several reasons , including the lack of coverage of the first trimester by ipt , and the high prevalence of parasite resistance to sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine in most malaria endemic areas .
women living in areas of stable malaria present even ( or non - existent ) symptoms that do not allow predicting placental infringement .
in clinical practice , the biological diagnosis of malaria relies on thick blood smear microscopic examination and rapid diagnostic test ( rdt ) .
the thick smear allows to estimate the parasite density in the maternal peripheral blood , but does not reveal the level of placental parasite sequestration .
rdt may be a better diagnostic tool for use in pregnant women , as p. falciparum sequesters in the placenta and , therefore , may not be present in the peripheral blood , producing false - negative results of the blood smear .
for the who , the rdt is now the reference test [ 15 ] .
however , the evidence of the presence of parasites in peripheral blood ( either by blood smear or rdt ) does not inform the clinician about the importance of placental sequestration , nor about the current placental function .
in addition , both thick blood smear examination and rdts suffer from a lack of sensitivity , and the molecular diagnosis by pcr allows to evidence as many as 2 - 4 times more women infected by p. falciparum experiencing a so - called sub - microscopic infection .
these sub - microscopic infections are also associated with poor pregnancy outcomes , as maternal anaemia , premature birth and low birth weight are more frequent [ 16 ] .
currently , no tool is available in endemic areas to identify suffering placentas .
such a tool would be of great interest , allowing to identify patients at risk of pam complications , such as iugr .
a curative treatment could potentially be initiated , and an observation of the fetus suffering from the defective functions of the placenta should be initiated .
immunology during pregnancy and pam an immunological balance during pregnancy allows the tolerance of the semi - allogenic transplant , represented by the feto - placental unit .
this balance contains three successive immunological phases .
the first is a strong inflammatory response during the implantation , the placentation and the first quarter of pregnancy .
then , arises an anti - inflammatory phase , with a th2 type strong response to assure the mother - fetus symbiosis and fetus development .
pregnancy maintenance is dependent on this cytokine profile with cd4 + cells secreting il - 4 , il - 5 , il - 6 , il - 10 , and il - 13 cytokines [ 17 ] .
finally , the parturition requires a strong pro - inflammatory response to induce the uterine contractions .
th1 lymphocytes produce mainly il - 12 , ifn - gamma , and tnf - beta that stimulate the production of prostaglandins and metalloproteases , leading to delivery [ 18 ] .
this balance of the th1 / th2 responses is essential to pregnancy , but leads pregnant woman more susceptible to infections , including malaria .
adult women living in malaria endemic areas have acquired a protective immunity to the repertoire of the p. falciparum variants they have been previously infected with .
during pregnancy , their susceptibility to malaria infection increases .
in areas of stable malaria transmission , this increase in susceptibility is parity - dependent , being highest in primigravidae .
several hypotheses have been suggested to explain this .
pregnant women would be more attractive to anopheles and thus more bitten by mosquitoes than non - pregnant women [ 19 ] .
increased susceptibility has also been explained by the immunomodulation related to the th1 / th2 immune response imbalance .
the increase of plasma factors , such as cortisol and prolactine , can inhibit the inflammatory response necessary for the control of the parasites [ 18 ] .
however , none of these observations explain the higher prevalence of malaria in primigravidae , nor the elective localization of ie in the placenta [ 20 ] .
the identification of var2csa variants allowed emitting a new hypothesis .
the emergence of a pregnancy - specific variant corresponds to the parasite adaptation in its ability to bind csa , a new receptor present at the surface of the st of the placenta .
the lack of previously - - acquired specific immunity for this new variant antigen allows the development of the infection [ 6 ] .
epidemiological and immunological features of malaria infection during early pregnancy are almost completely unknown , as in most malaria endemic countries women first attend to maternity wards at a late gestational age , usually in the second half of second trimester .
at the placental level , ie binding promotes intense infiltration of immune cells [ 21 , 22 ] in the intervillous spaces , resulting in an important pro - inflammatory cytokines production necessary to parasite elimination , but harmful to pregnancy .
the placental inflammation promotes placental lesions and exchanges imbalance that are deleterious for intrauterine fetal growth [ 11 , 23 ] .
disruption of angiogenesis through elevated levels of sflt - 1 ( or svefgr1 ) in the second trimester has been also reported [ 24 ] .
the building of the vascular network is mediated by the vegf protein , a pro - angiogenic factor expressed by trophoblast that can bind to its receptor , sflt - 1 , and inhibit its activity .
the consequences of this local inflammation are maternal anemia , in utero growth retardation and trans - placental transfer of soluble antigens to the fetus [ 23 ] .
st shapes local immunity by recruiting mononuclear cells from the peripheral blood .
immune balance aims towards th1 cytokines , such as tnf and ifn - gamma .
yet , in primigravidae , tnf - alpha and ifn - gamma increase correlates with severe anaemia and low birth weight [ 25 ] .
activated macrophages produce il - 1 , il - 6 , tnf and free radicals that engender placental changes , and disturb the mother - fetal exchanges [ 26 ] .
to protect st , anti - inflammatory cytokines , such as il - 10 , are increased [ 27 ] .
in the peripheral blood , high concentrations of plasmatic il - 10 , tnf and g - csf induce an inflammatory response [ 28 ] .
in asymptomatically infected pregnant women , parasite density is correlated to the levels of soluble mediators of inflammation , such as soluble tnf receptors ( tnf - r1 and tnf - r2 ) , il - 10 and g - csf , suggesting these factors may represent markers of pam - related inflammation [ 28 , 29 ] .
altered dcs and monocytes , and reduced frequency and low expression of the cd86 and cd80 activation markers , are observed in malaria - infected pregnant women , suggesting dc migration to lymphoid organs [ 30 ] .
hemozoin , the malaria pigment , may induce dc activation and maturation via the expression of cd80 , cd86 and chemokine receptors cxcr4 , promoting their migration to lymphoid organs [ 31 ] .
the development of specific humoral immunity to var2csa tries to limit the influx of inflammatory cells .
during successive pregnancies , women develop specific immune memory against var2csa variants , and acquire protective immunity .
multigravidae possess antibodies against var2csa that efficiently inhibit the adhesion of ie to st. the presence of anti - var2csa antibodies at a high titre from early pregnancy until term allows to protect women from placental infection [ 32 ] .
antibodies against var2csa are essential in the elimination of the parasites , and the level of antibodies allows to estimate the level of immune protection against placental malaria [ 33 ] .
primigravidae exposed to p. falciparum are able , from the first quarter of pregnancy , to produce these specific antibodies , but to a low level , insufficient to confer effective protection against malaria [ 34 ] .
currently , numerous biomarkers , mainly inflammatory markers , have been studied in the context of pam .
a systematic review of the topic reported that all these biomarkers were unspecific and none shown a significant advantage as single biomarker [ 35 ] .
however , a combination of multiple biomarkers involved in different pathophysiological pathways of pam may increase specificity , and could have the needed diagnostic value to identify at - risk patients .
other pathologies leading to fetal growth restriction have been much more extensively studied than pam .
in these , biomarkers indicative of placenta dysfunction have been identified and may be of interest in the context of pam .
a biomarker of placenta dysfunction , even if not specific to malaria , but associated with a positive thick smear or rdt could determine the women most at risk of complications .
one of the most extensively studied among such pathologies is preeclampsia that shares numerous pathophysiological features with pam .
similarities between pam and preeclampsia preeclampsia is due to a placental dysfunction that releases in the maternal circulation substances ( free radicals ) causing an endothelium infringement .
there are epidemiologic similarities between pam and preeclampsia , both being more frequent in primigravidae [ 36 ] , and a major cause of maternal mortality in developing countries [ 36 , 37 ] .
some authors described similar seasonal changes in the incidence of both preeclampsia and pam , with increased incidence during the rainy season [ 38 , 39 ] .
clinically , reduced placental perfusion is a common link between these pathologies that are associated with fetal growth restriction [ 10 , 40 ] .
indeed , preeclampsia translates into a high arterial blood pressure , a glomerular renal disease with proteinuria , and can be complicated by lung edema , renal insufficiency , and eclampsia .
placental dysfunction is the consequence of an immunological imbalance that originates a deficit of the vascular reshaping of maternal arteries during the trophoblastic invasion by extravillous cytotrophoblasts ( evct ) .
an excessive activation of the maternal immune response impairs the recognition of trophoblastic cells and their lysis .
the defect of placental vascularization causes a decrease of blood flow in the intervillous spaces , gradually leading to chronic hypoxia .
the oxidative stress increases apoptotic fragments of the st , and different factors ( free radicals , oxidized lipids , cytokines , sflt - 1 , s - endoglin ) are released in the maternal circulation where they damage the endothelium .
during preeclampsia , sflt - 1 levels are increased , and vegf levels are significantly decreased [ 41 ] .
several reports suggest that an inflammatory reaction , and an abnormal secretion of secondary cytokines during placental malaria might be initiators of severe preeclampsia and eclampsia [ 42 - 44 ] .
several preeclampsia biomarkers have been described to detect patients at risk .
sflt - 1 , the soluble receptor of vegf having an anti - angiogenic effect , is increased in the peripheral blood , and its level correlated with the severity of the preeclampsia syndrome [ 45 ] .
high concentrations of sflt - 1 disturb angiogenesis , even worsened by elevated maternal blood levels of s - endoglin .
this trans - membrane anti - angiogenic glycoprotein is also increased in the maternal blood in the second quarter of pregnancy [ 46 ] .
levine et al .
[ 47 ] reported a mean sflt - 1 value three times higher in women with preeclampsia than in normal pregnancies .
women with subsequent preeclampsia had twice higher concentrations of sflt - 1 at 16 - 20 weeks than the controls [ 24 ] .
placental protein 13 ( pp13 ) is also increased in preeclampsia [ 48 ] , whereas pregnancy - associated plasma protein a ( papp - a ) glycoprotein synthesized by the placenta is decreased .
the placenta is also a source of circulating inflammatory cytokines , chemokines or immunoglobulins like ifn - gamma , mcp - 1 and icam - 1 , vcam - 1 [ 49 ] , as well as tnf in the third quarter of pregnancy are increased in patients with preeclampsia [ 50 ] .
inhibin a , involved in gonadotropin repression , is also increased in preeclampsia .
conversely , the level of visfatin , a placental factor involved in glucose homeostasis , is decreased in the maternal blood [ 45 ] .
several molecules are increased in plasma during pam , including ferritin with anti - inflammatory functions , as well as leptin and ifn - gamma .
an increase of il10 , that has an anti - inflammatory role and a negative feedback on tnf , has specificity and sensibility of placental inflammation in pam [ 51 ] .
the immune response to csa - binding ie involves tnf and its receptors tnf - r1 and r2 .
they stimulate the phagocytic activity of leukocytes by increasing icam - 1 expression and the pro - inflammatory response by favouring the liberation of il6 and il8 [ 51 ] .
other biomarkers have been described as increased in the peripheral blood during pam : il1 , il10 , tnf , tnf - r1 , tnf - r2 and ifn - gamma [ 52 , 53 ] .
similarities between pam and preeclampsia are striking and could lead to define biomarkers identified within the framework of preeclampsia as pam 's potential markers .
indeed , several markers are increased in both pathologies , including tnf , ifn - gamma , icam - 1 , il10 , and il6 , but those are lacking specificity .
other factors , such as nitric oxide synthase , s - endoglin , or tgf - beta soluble receptor are associated to preeclampsia , but also to severe malaria in children and in infected primigravidae [ 44 ] .
this oxidative stress has been reported in several placental disorders , pregnancy pathologies , and also in pam [ 54 , 55 ] .
malondialdehyde ( mda ) is correlated positively with parasitaemia and no is correlated negatively with birth weight [ 55 ] .
sflt - 1 is also increased during pam and associated with fetal loss , intra - uterine growth restriction , and placental inflammation .
duffy 's study reported a correlation between pam and hypertension in young primigravidae .
in this population , levels of sflt - 1 are elevated , suggesting its involvement in this correlation [ 42 ] .
these similarities between malaria infection and preeclampsia open additional horizons .
all these biomarkers are thus potential candidates for the diagnosis of pam with placental damage , but have not been validated in clinical practice .
a randomized study may allow validating their interest to improve the detection of a suffering placenta as a consequence of malaria infection .
preeclampsia screening involves monthly blood pressure and proteinuria check .
the diagnosis is made after 20 gestational weeks if the blood pressure is more than 14 / 10 mm / hg and proteinuria > 0.3 g / 24 h. actually , new ways of detection are studied , adding to these measures the uterine doppler and the plgf and sflt - 1 dosages .
combined they should identify , in the third trimester , 84 % of preeclampsia with 10 % of false positive [ 56 ] .
indeed , the biomarkers can help to the screening of women at risk of preeclampsia .
but this has to be confirmed .
in france , numerous laboratories work on this hypothesis that is not currently included as standard practice , only blood pressure and urine protein test being part of the monitoring during prenatal consultations .
moreover , there are suspicions ( although this is not clearly demonstrated ) that malaria during pregnancy is a risk factor for preeclampsia , most probably through placental alterations .
in a malaria - endemic area , it is certainly difficult to manage preeclampsia , but women presenting an sflt - 1 / plgf high level should be submitted to protein urinary stick and blood pressure measurement .
conclusion identification of patients at risk of poor pregnancy outcome thanks to biomarkers will allow to optimize the prevention of the consequences of placental sequestration .
currently , the management of pam , by long - lasting insecticide - impregnated nets ( llin ) and intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy , occurs often late , and is taking care of malaria infection but not of its consequences on the placenta that may persist after having cure the infection .
it seems clear that the availability of a tool to identify , at an early stage , a placenta ' under stress' resulting from pam would represent an important step forward in terms of diagnosing and treating one of the main causes of poor pregnancy outcomes in african populations .
such biomarker would help in understanding the relationships between the timing and severity of p. falciparum infections and poor pregnancy outcomes , and to optimize preventive and curative interventions .
a biomarker of placenta dysfunction along with a positive thick smear or rdt , should evidence a suffering placental .
this screening test would allow to add to ipt a regular monitoring during the pregnancy with a more appropriated treatment .
it would be a primary tool to predict poor pregnancy outcomes , to adapt monitoring , and to ensure a close clinical and sonographic surveillance of these patients ( fig. 1 ) .
pam increases the risk of preterm delivery by the secretion of cytokines , and the risks of iugr by chronic hypoxia of the fetus .
the identification of women at risk would allow the initiation of curative treatment during the pregnancy by artemisinin - based combination therapy ( act ) [ 57 ] .
if the patients have severe malaria , treatment with artesunate iv is recommended in complement with paracetamol to limit the hyperthermia .
in case of severe anaemia ( hb < 7 g / dl ) , blood transfusion will be needed [ 57 ] .
an echography to estimate the fetal weight , with doppler measure could be realised at the beginning of treatment , and at 15 days intervals .
the doppler will allow to evaluate the level of placental alterations .
indeed , the doppler allows , in function of the gestational age , to evaluate the benefice to follow - up the pregnancy in case of severe iugr [ 58 , 59 ] .
additionally , variations in the biomarker level could have a prognostic value for the surveillance of placenta stress evolution. of course , these prerogatives cannot be currently implemented in all health centres in malaria transmission areas .
however , things are moving fast , and ultrasound apparatus are now available in an increasing number of health centres in tropical areas .
the goal is also to improve the surveillance of pregnancies , access to screening , to treatments , and the evaluation of the fetal health by doppler echography. fig. 1 how a biomarker of placental dysfunction can help to identify women at greater risk of poor pregnancy outcome ?

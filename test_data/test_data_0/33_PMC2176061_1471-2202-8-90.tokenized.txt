background cell adhesion molecules are plasma membrane proteins specialized in cell - cell recognition and adhesion .
two related adhesion molecules , necl - 1 and necl - 2 / syncam , were recently described and shown to fulfill important functions in the central nervous system .
the purpose of the work was to investigate the distribution , and the properties of necl - 3 / syncam - 2 , a previously uncharacterized member of the necl family with which it shares a conserved modular organization and extensive sequence homology .
results we show that necl - 3 / syncam - 2 is a plasma membrane protein that accumulates in several tissues , including those of the central and peripheral nervous system .
there , necl - 3 / syncam - 2 is expressed in ependymal cells and in myelinated axons , and sits at the interface between the axon shaft and the myelin sheath .
several independent assays demonstrate that necl - 3 / syncam - 2 functionally and selectively interacts with oligodendrocytes .
we finally prove that necl - 3 / syncam - 2 is a bona fide adhesion molecule that engages in homo - and heterophilic interactions with the other necl family members , leading to cell aggregation .
conclusion collectively , our manuscripts and the works on necl - 1 and syncam / necl - 2 reveal a complex set of interactions engaged in by the necl proteins in the nervous system .
our work also support the notion that the family of necl proteins fulfils key adhesion and recognition functions in the nervous system , in particular between different cell types .
background multicellular organization entails cell - cell recognition and adhesion .
the cell adhesion molecules ( cams ) are among the specialized plasma membrane proteins that carry out these functions .
the mechanisms of recognition and adhesion are of particular relevance in the nervous system whose operation heavily relies on cell - cell communication , and whose many cell types acting in concert are capable of extensive re - organization in development , learning and memory .
recently two related cams , necl - 2 - syncam [ 1 - 4 ] and necl - 1 [ 5 ] , were shown to fulfill important functions in the central nervous system ( cns ) .
in addition to acting as a cam in other tissues [ 6 - 11 ] , syncam can induce presynaptic differentiation in co - cultured neurons [ 1,4 ] , whereas necl - 1 is expressed specifically in brain and localizes at contact sites between neurons and glial cells [ 5 ] .
these two cams are ig superfamily members and genomic analysis predicts that they are part of a set of four closely related proteins [ 1,12 - 15 ] for which different nomenclatures have been proposed , in particular nectin - like 1 to 4 ( necl - 1 to - 4 ) , and synaptic cam 1 to 4 ( syncam - 1 to - 4 ) , each with its merits [ 1,13,15,16 ] .
here we describe necl - 3 / syncam - 2 , a previously uncharacterized member of the family , which we term necl - 3 throughout for simplicity and because the term is neutral with respect to function .
necl - 3 shares with the other necls / syncams a conserved modular organization comprising three ig domains , a single trans - membrane pass and a short cytoplasmic region containing 4.1 and pdz binding motifs [ 1,12 - 15 ] .
necl - 3 accumulates in several tissues , including those of the nervous system , where it localizes to myelinated axons and in ependymal cells .
we also demonstrate that necl - 3 engages in homo - and heterophilic interactions leading to cell aggregation and discuss its possible implication in processes dependent on neural cell adhesion .
results necl - 3 expression genes that are differentially expressed in the postnatal development of the rat cns may inform on important aspects of neurogenesis [ 17 ] .
one such gene codes for necl - 3 , whose expression we assessed in various rat tissues by northern blot and real - time pcr .
a necl - 3 mrna greater than 5 kb was detected in various structures of the cns ( midbrain , cerebellum and hippocampus ) , whereas it was either undetectable or poorly expressed in all other organs tested except for testis ( data not shown ) .
real - time pcr analysis of eighteen tissues using a primer pair spanning two exons confirmed the northern blot result ( fig. 1 ) .
we next examined necl - 3 protein accumulation .
since there is a high degree of homology among the necl family members ( in the rat , necl - 3 has 48 % , 44 % , and 35 % amino - acid identity to necl - 1 , necl - 2 , and necl - 4 respectively ) , it was critical to ensure specificity when raising and testing anti necl - 3 antibodies .
we immunized rabbits against a recombinant segment of the extracellular domain of necl - 3 that is the least conserved region among the necl proteins .
antibody specificity was tested using drosophila s2 cells transfected with either green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) alone or necl - 1 , necl - 2 , necl - 3 , and necl - 4 fused to gfp at their carboxy - termini .
crude s2 lysates were separated by sds gel electrophoresis and probed with either the anti necl - 3 or an anti gfp antibody serving as a loading control ( fig. 2a ) .
the anti necl - 3 antibody reveals a single species of the expected size exclusively in cells transfected with necl - 3 - gfp .
we conclude that we have a highly specific anti necl - 3 antibody preparation that does not cross - react with necl - 3 's closest relatives , i.e. necl - 1 , necl - 2 , or necl - 4 .

figure 2 antibody specificity and necl - 3 expression .
( panel a ) crude lysates of s2 cells transfected with either gfp or one each of the necl - gfp fusion proteins were visualized by sds - page and coomassie blue staining ( left panel ) .
the gels were blotted on nitrocellulose membranes and revealed with either an anti gfp mab ( middle panel ) , or the affinity - purified anti necl - 3 antibody ( right panel ) .
the cells had been transfected with gfp ( ctrl ) , necl - 1 - gfp ( 1 ) , necl - 2 - gfp ( 2 ) , necl - 3 - gfp ( 3 ) or necl - 4 - gfp ( 4 ) .
the anti gfp mab reveals fusion proteins of the expected apparent molecular weights as well as faster migrating products , likely the result of degradation or internal translation initiation .
the anti necl - 3 antibody does not cross - react with the other members of the necl family .
( panel b ) 15 mug of homogenates from hippocampus ( hi ) , cortex ( c ) , lung ( lu ) , kidney ( k ) , testis ( t ) , spleen ( s ) , heart ( he ) , liver ( li ) and thymus ( t ) of a 2 - month - old rat were subjected to sds - page , followed by western blotting with the anti - necl - 3 antibody .
( panel c ) rat cortex homogenates from the indicated postnatal ages were subjected to sds - page ( 12 %) , followed by western blotting with the anti - necl - 3 antibody .
using the necl - 3 antibody , we ran western blots on extracts from a series of different organs .
the necl - 3 protein was detected in brain structures , but also in kidney , heart and liver ( fig. 2b ) .
necl - 3 migrates with an apparent mass of approximately 52 kda , which is slightly more than its calculated molecular weight of 48 kda .
this is due at least in part to n - linked glycosylation since treatment with the n - glycosidase pngasef converts necl - 3 to a faster migrating form , consistent with the presence of n - glycosylation consensus sites in the extracellular domain ( data not shown ) .
we also monitored the accumulation of necl - 3 in the postnatal brain and found that the protein is barely detectable at p1 or p12 and has reached a plateau by p60 ( fig. 2c ) .
necl - 3 is targeted to the plasma membrane and engages in homo - and heterophilic interactions necl - 1 and necl - 2 form homo - and heterophilic interactions [ 1,8 - 10,18 ] .
in order to investigate necl - 3 's potential to insert in the plasma membrane , we transfected hela cells with vectors expressing either gfp or a chimeric protein consisting of necl - 3 carboxy - terminally fused to gfp .
unlike gfp alone ( fig. 3a ) , necl - 3 - gfp accumulates at contact sites between transfected cells ( fig. 3b ) .
confocal analysis and tri - dimensional reconstitution confirm the cytoplasmic location of gfp and the plasma membrane location of necl - 3 - gfp ( fig. 3a , b ) .
to rule out a localization artifact due to the gfp moiety of the fusion protein , we transfected a myc - tagged version of necl - 3 , and identical results were observed ( fig. 4 ) .
these data imply that necl - 3 is targeted to the plasma membrane and possibly engages in homophilic trans - interactions .
similar results were obtained for necl - 1 and necl - 2 [ 5,10,19,20 ] .
to verify that necl - 3 is targeted to the plasma membrane , we took advantage of the fact that our anti necl - 3 antibody recognizes a domain predicted to be extracellular .
transfected hela cells were used in immunofluorescence experiments done on cells that were not permeabilized , i.e. in the absence of detergent .
in such conditions the antibody is indeed able to specifically bind to the putative extracellular domain of necl - 3 ( fig. 3c - e ) , confirming its predicted topology and location at the plasma membrane .
figure 3 gfp ( a , top panel : average projection of 30 z - stacks of 0.24 micron each ; bottom panel : a single x / y plane in the center , a x / z slice at bottom and a y / z slice on the right ) or necl - 3 - gfp ( b , top panel : average projection of 39 z - stacks of 0.12 micron each ; bottom panel : a single x / y plane in the center , a x / z slice at bottom and a y / z slice on the right ) was transfected in hela cells and visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy .
unlike gfp alone , necl - 3 accumulates in the plasma membrane and at cell - cell contacts between transfected cells ( arrow ) .
( c - e ) , hela cells transfected with necl - 3 - gfp were processed for immunofluorescence with the anti necl - 3 antibody in non - permeabilized conditions and visualized ( average projection of 83 z - stacks of 0.12 micron each ) in the gfp channel ( c ) and in the rhodamine channel ( d ) .
to reveal untransfected cells , the specimen was stained with dapi .
the ( e ) panel shows the merged dapi , gfp and rhodamine channels .
note that the necl - 3 antibody only stains the transfected cells .
figure 4 myc - tagged necl - 3 was transfected in hela cells .
anti myc mab was applied and revealed with a secondary antibody coupled to fitc .
necl - 3 - myc accumulates at cell contacts ( arrow ) as does a gfp - tagged necl - 3 .
in order to further characterize the homo - and heteromerizing activities of necl - 3 , we performed aggregation assays in s2 cells .
these do not aggregate spontaneously and necl - 2 / syncam is able to induce their aggregation through homophilic interaction [ 1 ] .
s2 cells were transfected separately with plasmids expressing gfp or necl - 3 - gfp under the control of an inducible metallothionein promoter .
after transfection , the cells were washed free from plasmid , induced with cuso4 , gently shaken to favor aggregation and visualized without further fixation .
unlike cells transfected with gfp ( fig. 5a , b ) , those transfected with necl - 3 - gfp form large aggregates ( fig. 5c - d ) .
since the transfection efficiency is not 100 % , the non - transfected cells in the necl - 3 - gfp plate serve as internal control , showing no aggregation ( fig. 5c , d ) .
we next tested necl - 3 's ability to form aggregates with its relatives necl - 1 , necl - 2 and necl - 4 .
s2 cells were separately transfected with plasmids coding for necl - 3 - gfp , necl - 1 - dsred , and necl - 4 - dsred .
after transfection , they were mixed in different combinations pairwise and induced to express their transfected necl .
after gentle shaking , aggregates formed between necl - 3 - gfp and necl - 1 - dsred ( fig. 5e , f ) or necl - 4 - dsred ( fig. 5g , h ) .
again , non - transfected cells serving as internal control did not aggregate .
to rule out an artifact due to the use of dsred , we performed a similar s2 cells aggregation assay using a myc - tagged version of necl - 3 along with necl - 2 - gfp .
using a rhodamine - conjugated anti myc secondary antibody , we again observed aggregates of red and green cells ( fig. 5i , j ) .
thus , necl - 3 unambiguously interacts with itself , necl - 1 , necl - 2 , and necl - 4 in these aggregation assays .
to test the promiscuity of necl - 3 's heterophilic interactions , we assayed its ability to aggregate with alcam / cd166 , an adhesion molecule bearing five ig - loops [ 21,22 ] .
necl - 3 - dsred and alcam - gfp were used for aggregation assays as described above .
large s2 cells aggregates were observed but these were always composed of green only or red only cells ( fig. 6 ) .
the fact that necl - 3 does not interact productively with alcam shows that , even though necl - 3 is capable of multiple heterophilic interactions with other necl proteins , it retains specificity for certain ig loop folds .
figure 5 s2 cells transfected with gfp ( a , b ) or necl - 3 - gfp ( c , d ) were gently shaken and visualized by phase contrast ( a , c ) and fluorescence microscopy ( b , d ) .
cell aggregates form with necl - 3 - gfp transfected cells ( c , d ) , whereas gfp transfected ( a , b ) and untransfected cells ( arrows in c ) do no aggregate .
s2 cells transfected with necl - 3 - gfp were mixed with necl - 1 - dsred cells ( e , f ) ; cells transfected with necl - 3 - gfp were mixed with necl - 4 - dsred ( g , h ) cells , and cells transfected with necl - 3 - myc were mixed with necl - 2 - gfp ( i , j ) .
the cell aggregates were visualized by fluorescence microscopy with green and red pass filters ( e , g , i ) , by phase contrast ( f , h ) , or by fluorescent staining of the nuclei with dapi ( j ) .
figure 6 s2 cells transfected with alcam - gfp or necl - 3 - dsred were mixed , then gently shaken and visualized by fluorescence microscopy .
cells aggregate only homotypically , the red aggregates being mediated by necl - 3 - ds - red and the green ones by alcam - gfp .
in order to obtain a biochemical confirmation that necl - 3 is able to make heterophilic interactions , a fusion protein between the fc domain of a human igg and the extra - cellular domain of necl - 3 was produced ( fc - necl - 3 ) .
this chimeric protein or a control full - length human igg were adsorbed on protein a resin and used in pull - down assays .
lysates of mock - transfected and necl - 2 - gfp transfected s2 cells were the inputs for the pull - down experiments .
after incubation and washings , the proteins retained on the beads were analyzed by western blot ( fig. 7 ) .
control igg beads are unable to bring down necl - 2 - gfp , whereas the fc - necl - 3 beads efficiently do so ( approximately 15 % of the input necl - 2 - gfp is recovered ) .
incidentally , the fact that human igg beads do not interact with necl - 2 confirms that even though the necl proteins are capable of multiple heterophilic interactions , they retain specificity .
we note that the heterophilic interaction described here is calcium independent since the pull - down experiments were done in presence of edta .
similar data have been reported for the homophilic interactions of necl - 2 [ 1 ] .
figure 7 the fc - necl - 3 fusion protein ( n3 ) or iggs ( igg ) were immobilized on protein a beads .
these were used for pull - downs in lysates of s2 cells transfected either with a control vector ( mock ) or with necl - 2 - gfp .
after the pull - downs , the proteins retained on the beads were subjected to sds - page ( 12 %) , followed by western blotting with an anti gfp mab .
15 % of the input lysate material was loaded on the same gel ( input ) .
the distribution of necl - 3 in the nervous system we have shown that necl - 3 transcript ( fig. 1 ) and protein ( fig. 2b , c ) are strongly expressed in the cns .
closely - related necl - 2 is also expressed there [ 2,3 ] , where it can induce presynaptic differentiation in co - cultured neurons [ 1,4 ] , while necl - 1 localizes at cell - cell contact sites between neurons and glial cells [ 5 ] .
we therefore investigated the brain distribution of necl - 3 by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy .
intense labeling was observed in structures resembling axon bundles in several brain areas including cerebellar white matter and ventral reticular nucleus ( fig. 8a , d ) .
the axonal localization of necl - 3 was confirmed by a near - perfect overlap with the axonal neurofilament marker ( fig. 8a - f ) .
careful examination however shows that although the necl - 3 and the neurofilament staining are largely overlapping , they are not identical ( inset fig. 8f ) .
this co - localization is unlikely to be an artifact since it was apparent for each z optical section examined ( not shown ) .
we investigated whether necl - 3 is expressed in other cell types in co - labeling experiments with non - neuronal markers .
antibodies against gfap ( glial fibrillary acid protein ) revealed very little or no accumulation in astrocytes and anti cd11b showed no detectable signal in microglial cells ( fig. 9a - f ) .
necl - 3 immunoreactivity was also detected in ependymal cells of the ventricle wall and choroid plexus ( fig. 10a - b ) .
close examination shows that in addition to its apparent membrane localization , necl - 3 also accumulates to the cytoplasm of ependymal cells , the significance of which is currently under investigation .
finally , labeling was observed inside capillaries , indicating that necl - 3 is also expressed on cells circulating in the blood ( data not shown ) .
figure 8 12 mum sagittal brain sections of a two - month - old rat were processed for immunohistochemistry .
the top sections ( a , b , c ) show white matter and granula within a cerebellar fold ( average projection of 15 z - stacks of 0.16 micron each ) .
the dapi stained nuclei appear in blue and reveal the nuclei - dense granula regions bracketing the white matter .
the bottom sections ( d , e , f ) show the ventral reticular nucleus ( average projection of 9 z - stacks of 0.16 micron each ) .
the sections were incubated with anti - necl - 3 and anti neurofilament antibodies , which were revealed with secondary antibodies coupled to alexa 488 and alexa 594 , respectively .
panels ( a ) and ( d ) show neurofilament immunoreactivity in the green - pass channel , and panels ( b ) and ( e ) necl - 3 immunoreactivity in the red - pass channel .
the green and red images are merged in ( c ) and ( f ) .
nuclei were visualized with dapi in ( a ) and ( b ) .
the inset of figure 5f shows that necl - 3 and neurofilament do not perfectly overlap .
figure 9 12 mum sagittal sections of the caudate putamen in a two - month - old rat were processed for immunohistochemistry .
the sections were incubated with anti necl - 3 and anti gfap antibodies ( a , b , c , 14 z - stacks of 0.12 micron each ) or with anti necl - 3 and anti cd11b antibodies ( d , e , f , 20 z - stacks of 0.36 micron each ) , which were revealed with secondary antibodies as in fig. 5. ( a ) , gfap immunoreactivity in the green - pass channel ; ( b ) , necl - 3 immunoreactivity in the red - pass channel ; ( d ) , cd11b immunoreactivity in the green - pass channel ; ( e ) , necl - 3 immunoreactivity in the red - pass channel .
the green and red images are merged in ( c ) and ( f ) .
nuclei were visualized with dapi in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) .
figure 10 12 mum sagittal brain sections of a two - month - old rat were processed for immunohistochemistry .
the sections were incubated with anti - necl - 3 antibody , which was revealed with a secondary antibody coupled to alexa 594 .
nuclei were visualized with dapi .
panel a ( average projection of 64 z - stacks of 0.12 micron each ) shows part of the third ventricle ( asterisk ) bordered by the ependymal cell layer .
panel b ( average projection of 57 z - stacks of 0.12 micron each ) shows ependymal cells of the choroid plexus in the third ventricle .
to further characterize necl - 3 's axonal location , co - labeling experiments were performed with the rip mab that specifically recognizes the oligodendrocytic myelin protein cnp ( 2 ' , 3 ' - cyclic nucleotide 3 ' - phosphodiesterase ) [ 23,24 ] .
in sharp contrast to the co - localization seen with neurofilament , necl - 3 positive fibers are always surrounded by rip / cnp immunoreactivity in a mutually exclusive pattern ( fig. 11a - c ) .
identical results were obtained using a mab directed against the myelin basic protein ( mbp ) in combination with anti necl - 3 antibody ( fig. 11d - f ) .
this confirms that necl - 3 is found in the axoplasm of myelinated axons .
we also investigated the relationship between necl - 3 and myelination by examining the caudate putamen stained with anti necl - 3 and anti rip / cnp antibodies .
there we found that necl - 3 immunoreactivity is stronger in the myelinated areas and , as seen previously , that it is wrapped in oligodendrocytic immunoreactivity ( fig. 12a - c ) .
we finally examined whether necl - 3 is also expressed in myelinated axon fibers of the pns .
co - labeling experiments with anti necl - 3 antibody plus anti neurofilament antibody ( fig. 13a - c ) or rip / cnp antibody ( fig. 13d - f ) show that in the trigeminal nerve , as in the cns , necl - 3 immunoreactivity overlaps perfectly with that of the neurofilaments and is surrounded by but excluded from the myelinated processes .
electron microscopy was used to confirm at a finer scale that necl - 3 is present at the axon - oligodendrocyte interface .
the pons of three - month - old rats was used for pre - embedding immuno - electron microscopy with affinity - purified anti necl - 3 antibody .
these experiments show that necl - 3 is absent from the axonal matrix and largely , but not exclusively , located at the innermost interface between oligodendrocytic layers and the axon shaft ( fig. 14a and 14b ) .
control experiments with an antibody directed against the extra - cellular domain of the related necl - 4 protein fail to show the same distribution ( data not shown ) .
figure 11 12 mum sagittal brain sections of a two - month - old rat were processed for immunohistochemistry .
the vestibular nucleus is visualized in the top sections ( a , b , c ) as the average projection of 20 z - stacks of 0.24 micron each , and in the bottom sections the pons ( d , e , f ) as the average projection of 26 z - stacks of 0.12 micron each .
the sections were incubated with anti - necl - 3 and anti rip antibodies ( a , b , c ) or with anti - necl - 3 and anti mbp antibodies ( d , e , f ) , which were revealed with secondary antibodies as in fig. 5. ( a ) , rip immunoreactivity in the green - pass channel ; ( b ) , necl - 3 immunoreactivity in the red - pass channel ; ( d ) , mbp immunoreactivity in the green - pass channel ; ( e ) , necl - 3 immunoreactivity in the red - pass channel .
the green and red images are merged in ( c ) and ( f ) .
nuclei were visualized with dapi in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) .
figure 12 12 mum sagittal sections of the caudate putamen in a two - month - old rat were processed for immunohistochemistry .
the sections were incubated with anti - necl - 3 and anti rip antibodies , which were revealed with secondary antibodies as in fig. 5. ( a ) , rip immunoreactivity in the green - pass channel ; ( b ) , necl - 3 immunoreactivity in the red - pass channel .
the green and red images are merged in ( c ) .
nuclei were visualized with dapi in ( a ) and ( b ) .
all images represent the average projection of 9 z - stacks of 0.12 micron each .
note that although present in the same areas , the necl - 3 and oligodendrocytic immunoreactivities are not overlapping .
figure 13 12 mum trigeminal nerve sections of a four - month - old rat were processed for immunohistochemistry .
the sections were incubated with anti - necl - 3 and anti neurofilament antibodies ( a , b , c , 10 z - stacks of 0.24 micron each ) or with anti - necl - 3 and anti mbp antibodies ( d , e , f , 10 z - stacks of 0.12 micron each ) , which were revealed with secondary antibodies as in fig. 5. ( a ) , neurofilament immunoreactivity in the green - pass channel ; ( b ) , necl - 3 immunoreactivity in the red - pass channel ; panel ( d ) , rip immunoreactivity in the green - pass channel ; ( e ) , necl - 3 immunoreactivity in the red - pass channel .
the green and red images are merged in ( c ) and ( f ) .
nuclei were visualized with dapi in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) .
figure 14 panels ( a and b ) show examples of immuno - electron microscopy with anti necl - 3 antibody in the pons of three - month old rats .
the signal was enhanced with nanogold particles .
note the immunoreactivity at the interface between the axon shaft ( star ) and the concentric myelin folds .
the myelin sheaths locally detach from the axon due to the fixation and embedding procedures .
panel ( c and d ) shows representative fields of types of cells attached to the control iggs ( c ) or to fc - necl - 3 treated plates ( d ) .
panel ( e and f ) , fc - necl - 3 bound to an oligodendrocyte .
the phase contrast picture shows a typical oligodendrocyte as well as another cell (*) , probably an astrocyte ( panel e ) .
the image in the red - pass channel shows that , unlike the astrocyte (*) , the oligodendrocyte binds to fc - necl - 3 , as revealed by a rhodamine - coupled secondary antibody ( panel f ) .
panel ( g ) the numbers of oligodendrocytes per field ( y - axis ) were scored in control dishes ( ctrl ig ) and fc - necl - 3 coated dishes ( error bars represent 1 standard deviation , p ( t <= t ) = 0.018 ) necl - 3 selectively binds to oligodendrocytes during cns development and plasticity , countless different interactions can form between various cell types and subtypes .
to explore whether necl - 3 would preferentially form contacts with specific cells we relied on an adhesion assay with mixed primary cultures [ 25 ] .
cerebellar cells were dissociated and plated on petri dishes that were either untreated , coated with control iggs , or coated with fc - necl - 3 .
after a short incubation time , the non - adhering cells were washed away , and the remaining cells were cultured for another day .
microglial cells attached non - specifically to all dishes , reflecting the ability of these cells for binding untreated surfaces .
only the fc - necl - 3 treated dishes attached cells other than microglia , and these were exclusively oligodendrocytes , as evident from their characteristic morphology ( fig. 14c and 14d ) and immunoreactivity for rip / cnp ( data not shown ) .
quantification indicates that this result is statistically highly significant ( fig. 14g ) .
thus in this system necl - 3 can functionally and selectively interact with oligodendrocytes and does not bind to other cns cell - types .
to confirm the observation that necl - 3 preferentially binds to oligodendrocytes , the fusion protein fc - necl - 3 or control iggs were directly added to a mixed primary culture prepared from neonatal cortex .
the fc moiety on control iggs and fc - necl - 3 was revealed with labeled anti human fc antibodies .
no signal was observed with the control iggs by fluorescent microscopy ( data not shown ) , in contrast oligodendrocytes were strongly and selectively labeled with fc - necl - 3 ( fig. 14e and 14f ) .
the binding of fc - necl - 3 on mixed primary cultures was repeated and the oligodendrocytes were revealed with the mab rip that specifically stains these cells .
again oligodendrocytes are preferably bound by necl - 3 , despite the presence of other cell types in the cultures ( fig. 15 ) , and incubating the cultures with the same amount of iggs does not to produce any detectable signal ( data not shown ) .
these experiments are in complete agreement with the plate adhesion assay and indicate that necl - 3 has a ligand on oligodendrocytes , to which it preferentially binds .
this is also in agreement with observation by others that in the cns , fc - necl - 3 binds to oligodendrocytes [ 26 ] .
figure 15 ( a ) the image in the red - pass channel shows fc - necl - 3 revealed by a rhodamine - coupled secondary antibody .
( b ) the green - pass channel shows that fc - necl - 3 binds to oligodendrocytes , which are identified by the specific mab rip revealed with an alexa 594 secondary antibody .
note that rip - negative cell - types are not bound by fc - necl - 3 ( arrows in a and b ) .
the green and red images are merged in ( c ) .
nuclei were visualized with dapi in ( a ) , ( b ) .
the field shown in the figure is representative of more than 100 rhodamine - positive cells , all of which were also rip - positive .
discussion several laboratories have predicted the existence of necl - 3 , based on bioinformatic considerations [ 1,12 - 15 ] .
biederer has done a particularly interesting analysis with respect to splice variants , gene size , and protein structure [ 15 ] .
here we describe several of necl - 3 's biological features .
we demonstrate that it is a bona fide adhesion molecule able to engage in homo - and heterophilic interactions .
the contacts necl - 3 makes with itself and with necl - 1 , - 2 and - 4 are strong enough to withstand co - precipitation and cause cell aggregation .
likewise , kakunaga et al. have shown that necl - 1 interacts with itself , necl - 2 , nectin - 1 and nectin - 3 [ 5 ] , whereas necl - 2 / syncam binds to itself and to necl - 1 , nectin - 3 and crtam [ 1,8 - 10,12,20,27,28 ] .
it was also recently reported that necl - 1 and necl - 4 binds homo - and heterophilically and that necl - 2 and necl - 3 bind to necl - 1 and necl - 4 [ 26 ] .
in this latter report , the authors use a different technology than ourselves and reach similar conclusions , i.e. that necl proteins engage in homo - and heterophilc interaction .
the degree of promiscuity of the necl proteins is an important biological question .
it is unlikely that they only interact with the partners so far documented , but do they interact with many other ig domain proteins and with proteins of other superfamilies ?
here we show that necl - 3 does not react in trans with the ig folds in igg 's and in alcam , but much more work will be needed to sort out the range of these interactions and clarify their biological relevance .
using highly specific antibodies , we show that necl - 3 is enriched in myelinated axons in rat cns and pns .
our immuno - electron microscopy data indicate that necl - 3 accumulates at contact sites between neurons and oligodendrocytes .
in addition , initial investigations suggest that necl - 3 , similarly to necl - 1 [ 5,26 ] , is located at internodes on myelinated axons ( data not shown ) .
a function of necl - 3 compatible with these data , as well as with the fact that its maximal expression coincides with mature myelination , would be that necl - 3 participates in the myelin ensheathment of the axon [ 29,30 ] .
it could do so by " gluing " the oligodendrocytic processes to the axon shaft , a proposition that should be investigated in the future .
our adhesion assays show that necl - 3 preferentially adheres to oligodendrocytes .
since it is mostly expressed in neurons , this suggests that although capable of forming homophilic trans - interactions , necl - 3 preferentially forms heterophilic interactions .
it raises the question of the identity of the necl - 3 interaction partner ( s ) in the oligodendrocyte .
a good candidate for such a partner is necl - 1 , as it is present in oligodendrocytes [ 5,31 ] and binds to necl - 3 ( this work ) .
a recent report showed very convincingly that in the pns necl - 1 is axonal and segregates preferentially to the internodal membrane whereas necl - 4 is expressed in schwann cells and heterodimerizes with necl - 1 , thereby forming a pair mediating axon - glia contact [ 26 ] .
necl - 4 is therefore a likely partner for necl - 3 in the cns , as these two necl proteins are able to make heterophilic interactions ( our work and [ 26 ]) .
indeed spiegel et al. also report , as data not shown , that in the cns fc - necl - 3 bind to oligodendrocytes [ 26 ] .
consequently , necl - 3 ( this report and [ 26 ]) and necl - 1 [ 5,26 ] are likely involved in the establishment axon - glia contacts .
however , numerous other oligodendrocytic proteins could also serve as plausible necl - 3 partners [ 31,32 ] .
conclusion the complex set of interactions engaged in by the necl proteins suggests that they fulfill important cell adhesion and recognition functions .
our results reinforce the notion that the necl family of proteins is involved in cell adhesion and recognition in the nervous system , as recently proposed [ 31 ] .
there , necl - 1 and necl - 3 would favor neuron - glia contact ( this work and [ 5 ]) through heterophilic binding to necl - 4 [ 26 ] ; and necl - 2 would enable neuron - neuron contact [ 1,15 ] .
intriguingly , necl - 2 also promotes interactions between the nervous and immune systems [ 20,27,28,33 ] .
it will be of interest to test whether other necl family members fulfill similar neuro - immune functions .
it also points to a possible mechanism for the interaction between lymphocytes and myelinated axons as it occurs in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis , leukodystrophy , central pontine myelinolysis and others .
here , necl - 2 on lymphocytes would interact with necl - 4 on oligodendrocytes or necl - 1 , necl - 2 , or necl - 3 on the axon shaft .
the necl proteins may also be involved in certain aspects of nervous system regeneration and repair .
in a pns remyelination model , necl - 4 appears to be important for this process [ 26 ] , and necl - 2 ( sgigsf ) mrna and protein are upregulated in a model of olfactory epithelium nerve transection [ 34 ] .
since necl - 3 is not present exclusively in the nervous system , it will be important to assess its cellular localization in the other tissues that express it. in conclusion , our data describe some of the properties of the novel adhesion molecule necl - 3 and highlight its implication in the nervous system .
this work also supports the notion that the necl family of proteins fulfills important adhesion and recognition functions in the nervous system .

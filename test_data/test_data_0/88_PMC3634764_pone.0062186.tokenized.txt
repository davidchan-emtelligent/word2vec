why evolvability appears to have increased over evolutionary time is an important unresolved biological question .
unlike most candidate explanations , this paper proposes that increasing evolvability can result without any pressure to adapt .
the insight is that if evolvability is heritable , then an unbiased drifting process across genotypes can still create a distribution of phenotypes biased towards evolvability , because evolvable organisms diffuse more quickly through the space of possible phenotypes .
furthermore , because phenotypic divergence often correlates with founding niches , niche founders may on average be more evolvable , which through population growth provides a genotypic bias towards evolvability .
interestingly , the combination of these two mechanisms can lead to increasing evolvability without any pressure to out - compete other organisms , as demonstrated through experiments with a series of simulated models .
thus rather than from pressure to adapt , evolvability may inevitably result from any drift through genotypic space combined with evolution 's passive tendency to accumulate niches .

introduction an unbroken hereditary chain links the simplest early replicators to the most complex modern macroscopic organisms .
observing this evolutionary trajectory raises the question of the cause for the appearance of increasing evolutionary potential , i.e. increasing evolvability [ 1 ] .
although the cause of such increase is still debated , most candidate explanations for evolvability rely on selection pressure [ 1 ] - [ 8 ] , reflecting natural selection 's significant explanatory power in other contexts .
for example , selection on mutation or recombination rates [ 2 ] , species - level selection to adapt [ 1 ] , [ 3 ] , selection for stability of evolved structures [ 3 ] , [ 8 ] , and persisting through fluctuating selective environments [ 5 ] have all been proposed as partial explanations for increasing evolvability .
however , adaptive explanations may be unnecessary or at least merit more scrutiny if increasing evolvability is demonstrated without any pressure to adapt , that is , if evolvability results from a more fundamental ( and potentially passive ) process .
this paper investigates two such alternative hypotheses for evolvability .
the first hypothesis is that if evolvability itself is heritable , then even a passive drifting process over genotypes will differentiate the evolvability of organisms , and the more evolvable of these organisms will be more likely to become phenotypically diverse and spread through niches. that is , a biased distribution of phenotypes can result from a passive drift over genotypes .
intuitively , in a passive drift some mutations may increase an organism 's evolutionary potential , while others may decrease it. importantly , note that such passive drifting does not cause an inherent drive towards increasing evolvability when averaged over all genotypes in the entire population .
however , it turns out that evolvability averaged over niches may still rise even in a purely drifting model ( i.e. a model with a fixed - size population that evolves solely through genetic drift ) .
this conclusion follows from one widely - held conception of evolvability as the capacity of an organism to " generate heritable phenotypic variation " [ 3 ] , which is also the definition adopted in this paper .
while evolvability is also sometimes discussed in relation to adaptation [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , the chosen definition reflects a growing consensus in biology that phenotypic variability in its own right deserves study in the context of evolvability [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 11 ] .
thus , following this definition , those organisms that are least evolvable will on average change less phenotypically from repeated mutation , while those that are more evolvable will change more , i.e. more evolvable organisms will have a higher average velocity of phenotypic change .
as a result , the phenotype space itself can act as a filter , whereby more evolvable organisms will be separated from the less evolvable over time as they radiate at different velocities throughout the phenotypic space .
this sorting mechanism is similar to how a centrifuge or a western blot separates particles of different densities or charges .
in other words , at any point in time the least evolvable organisms are most likely to be found clustered together within the phenotypic space , occupying niches near their evolutionary origins .
in contrast , the more evolvable organisms are more likely to diverge phenotypically over time to inhabit niches divergent from their ancestors .
thus , even if the genotypic space is evolving without direction , the resulting distribution in the phenotypic space can still become biased towards the more evolvable. that is , uniformly sampling the genotype space ( which is unbiased ) would on average choose less evolvable organisms than would uniformly sampling the phenotype space ( which is biased ) .
the bias in the distribution of phenotypes is that less evolvable organisms are likely to be found densely concentrated in only a few niches ( near their evolutionary origin ) , while the more evolvable organisms are more likely to spread throughout reachable niches .
thus if a population is drifting through a genotypic space , from surveying only the phenotypic space it might be mistakenly inferred that the average evolvability over all organisms had increased , i.e. that there is a genotypic bias towards evolvability .
furthermore , the cause of this apparent increase might be misattributed to selection pressure .
in reality , however , there is no selection pressure , and the average evolvability of genotypes will not have significantly changed : only the average evolvability per niche ( i.e. averaged over divergent phenotypes ) will have increased .
the interesting implication is that the deceptive appearance of increasing evolvability can result from a random walk over genotypes .
however , the main insight is that evolvability may be self - reinforcing : a drifting process in the genotypic space may warp the phenotypic distribution in proportion to evolvability , and given a sufficiently large population , the maximum evolvability may also increase over time , which further warps the phenotypic space .
supporting this hypothesis , experiments with both an abstract mathematical model and simulated evolved machines reveal the appearance of increasing evolvability through only a drifting process .
however , while genetic drift biases only the phenotypic distribution of organisms towards greater evolvability , an additional non - adaptive mechanism may also similarly bias the genotypic distribution .
this genotypic bias can result from the correlation between phenotypic divergence and establishing new niches .
in other words , evolvable organisms may be more likely to lead to new ways of life [ 3 ] .
thus more evolvable organisms may become over - represented as founders of new niches , causing the resulting population growth from niche foundation to bias the genetic space also towards increasing evolvability .
thus the second hypothesis for non - adaptive evolvability increase is that founder effects in new niches tend to amplify more evolvable organisms on average .
the end result is that overall evolvability , i.e. not just its appearance , may also increase over time in nature - but not due to adaptive pressure to out - compete other organisms , which is a foundational assumption that underlies many other theories for the rise of evolvability [ 1 ] - [ 8 ] .
supporting this second hypothesis , further experiments with growing populations in which evolution is initiated within a single niche , and where each niche has a limited capacity ( but where selection is random within a niche ) demonstrate a significant trend towards increasing genotypic evolvability over time .
importantly , the drive towards overall increasing genotypic evolvability in these experiments is qualitatively more substantial than in the drifting models alone ( where the appearance of increasing evolvability results only when averaged over niches ) .
another abstract model and two additional models with evolved machines exhibit the same trend towards increasing genotypic evolvability without selection pressure for adaptation .
the surprising conclusion is that increasing evolvability may not result from selective pressure to adapt , but may instead be an inevitable byproduct of how evolvability warps the distribution of phenotypes and the tendency for founding new niches to amplify evolvable organisms .
experiments the next sections describe experimental models that investigate the hypotheses in this paper .
appearance of increasing evolvability in passive drift models the first set of experiments illustrate that evolvability can appear to increase as a result of a passive drifting process over genotypes. that is , if evolvability is heritable then a drifting process in a genotype space can separate the more evolvable organisms from the less evolvable ones over time , inducing a distorted distribution in phenotype space that yields the deceptive impression of overall increasing evolvability .
this first hypothesis is explored in two models , a highly - abstract model and a model based on simulated evolved robots .
abstract passive drift model the highly - abstract model consists of a population of abstract organisms that evolve solely due to genetic drift ( i.e. there is no selection pressure nor population growth ) .
the idea is to investigate whether genetic drift can yield the appearance of increasing evolvability in a minimal model .
thus each organism in this model has only two hereditary properties : the niche that it occupies and its evolvability , both of which are subject to mutation .
an organism 's niche is represented as a two - dimensional point within a discrete grid , which mutation perturbs by shifting the point one unit in either dimension .
in other words , the genotype - to - phenotype map is trivial in this model : the niche specified in an organism 's genotype maps directly into its phenotypic niche ( which is the two - dimensional point in the discrete grid ) .
the evolvability of an organism is thus specified as the probability that an organism 's niche will be perturbed through mutation , which reflects the assumption that more evolvable organisms have greater phenotypic variability [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 11 ] .
in contrast to the initial probability for an organism 's niche to be perturbed ( i.e. the organism 's initial evolvability ) , evolvability itself mutates more infrequently through small perturbations ( exact parameter settings can be found in the methods section ) .
in other words , the assumption is that evolvability tends to evolve at slower rates than typical hereditary properties .
note that all organisms are initially identical , i.e. they begin in the same niche ( in the center of the grid ) with the same level of evolvability .
the idea is that as the population drifts in this model , the evolvability of each organism undergoes a random walk .
thus over time the evolvability of organisms will become differentiated as by chance mutation some become more evolvable and some become less so. however , across the entire population , evolvability will remain constant on average because increasing and decreasing are equiprobable .
concurrent with changes in evolvability , the niches of organisms are also evolving stochastically .
recall that in this model the probability of an organism 's niche mutating is linked to its evolvability .
the interesting effect of such linkage is that it causes the niche space to act as a filter that over time separates the less evolvable organisms from the more evolvable .
in other words , if all organisms are initialized to start from the same niche , on average the organisms that become most evolvable ( by chance mutation ) will also evolve to be farthest in the niche space from the starting location ( because evolvability here correlates with an increased future chance of changing niches ). that is , the most evolvable organisms have a higher phenotypic velocity of change .
as a result , the least evolvable organisms will on average cluster near the initial niche , and the most evolvable organisms are more likely to be found along the peripheral niches .
thus by observing the distribution of evolvability across the niche space ( which is equivalent to the phenotypic space in this simplified model ) one might falsely conclude that evolvability in general has increased .
in other words , the average evolvability per niche will have increased .
however , evolvability across the population remains unchanged on average ; it is only evolvability 's distribution over the space of niches that becomes biased during evolution .
this bias , and the unbiased population - wide average of evolvability are shown in figure 1 .
more clearly illustrating the bias over the niche space , figure 2 shows a heat - map of evolvability over the grid of niches at the end of a simulation and figure 3 shows how evolvability varies as a function of a niche 's distance from the starting niche .
note that there is a strong monotonic relationship between the distance of an organism from the starting niche at the end of a simulation and its evolvability ( ; pearson 's r ) .

how the evolvability of organisms changes over generations is shown averaged ( in different ways ) over 50 independent simulations that last 3,000 generations each .
if evolvability is averaged within each niche and then over all niches , then evolvability appears to increase .
however , if instead evolvability is simply averaged over all organisms in the population , there is no significant overall increase in evolvability over time .

the main result is that there is a significant correlation between increasing distance from the initial niche and increasing evolvability in this model .
the plotted line indicates the line of best fit by linear regression .
passive drift with evolved robots to augment the evidence provided by the purely - abstract model in the previous section , a more concrete genetic space is considered in this model , which has a richer genotype - to - phenotype map .
the idea is to begin exploring whether the results from the abstract passive drift model reflect a general tendency or if they are overly specific to parameters or assumptions in the simple model .
as an initial such exploration , a genotype - phenotype mapping and simulated environment are implemented in the spirit of digital evolution [ 12 ] and evolutionary robotics ( er ; [ 13 ]) .
in particular , a genotype - phenotype map for a simulated robot controlled by evolved artificial neural networks ( anns ) is adapted from prior er experiments [ 14 ] - [ 16 ] .
in this model , genotypes encode anns that control simple wheeled robots embedded in a simulated maze .
the motivation is to abstract at a high level how evolved neural structures influence an organism 's behavior in its environment .
in other words , a genotype in this model ultimately maps to the behavior of a robot in a simulated maze environment .
though other domains could be applied , this environment is well - studied [ 14 ] - [ 16 ] and offers a non - trivial genotype - phenotype mapping .
niches in this model are specified by creating a discrete grid over a space of possible robot behaviors , i.e. what the robot actually does in the simulation , as opposed to a characterization of its genotype or of the ann controller itself to which the genotype maps .
so in this model , as in nature , the niche space is a many - to - one mapping from the space of phenotypes , i.e. many similar phenotypic behaviors will map into the same niche .
the idea is that different classes of behaviors are what facilitate niches , not simple differentiation of genotypes or encoded neural structures .
thus a robot is mapped into a niche as a function of its behavior .
while there there is no overall consensus on how to quantify evolvability [ 5 ] , a growing body of work supports that evolvability is related to phenotypic variability [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 11 ] .
thus the evolvability of genotypes in this model ( also following precedent in er [ 17 ]) , is given by quantifying the amount of behavioral variety ( i.e. the number of different behavioral niches ) reachable on average by random mutations from a particular genotype .
in other words , an evolvable organism is more likely to lead to phenotypic divergence .
note that in this model evolvability is not directly encoded into the genotype as in the abstract model , but is a quantifiable emergent product of the genotype - phenotype map , more closely resembling the situation in biological evolution .
specific parameters and details about the evolvability measure are given in the methods section .
the general motivation for this model is that passively drifting with a relatively large population ( e.g. on the order of millions ) composed of this kind of more concrete genotype may exhibit the same appearance of increasing evolvability as observed in the abstract passive drift model .
a larger population is necessary in this experiment because most random genotypes in this more realistic genotypic space represent similarly trivial behaviors , i.e. most randomly - connected anns encode no meaningful information , and the appearance of increasing evolvability will only emerge when drifting over a sufficient quantity of differentiated non - trivial behaviors .
thus to facilitate these experiments in a computationally efficient way , a limited genetic space of anns that was tractable to exhaustively characterize and explore was enumerated ( i.e. a discrete subset was considered from a much larger space of anns with continuous weights and variable network topologies ) .
then each one of the enumerated genotypes in the space ( which consisted of 38.7 million different genotypes ) were evaluated in the maze environment to quantify its behavior and evolvability .
for each simulation the population was uniformly initialized to a randomly chosen genotype ( i.e. the population is always initially homogeneous ) and subject to differentiating genetic drift for 250 generations .
importantly , supporting the assumption that evolvability is heritable , despite overall wide variance in evolvability over the entire genetic space , the evolvability of a parent and its offspring are well correlated ( ; pearson 's r ) .
the details of the particular neural model applied can also be found in the methods section .
interestingly , a plot of evolvability over time from this model also demonstrates the appearance of increasing evolvability over time ( figure 4 ) , providing evidence that the hypothesis that genetic drift can lead to the appearance of increasing evolvability may hold true not only in abstract theoretical circumstances .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0062186.g004 figure 4 evolvability of evolved robots with the passive drift model .
the evolvability of evolved robots subject to passive drift is shown averaged ( in different ways ) over 50 independent runs that lasted 250 generations each .
if evolvability is averaged within each niche and then over all niches , it appears to increase .
if instead evolvability is averaged over all organisms , there is no significant increase .
population growth with limited capacity niches increases evolvability the previous models demonstrate how a purely random drifting process can create the deceptive appearance of increasing overall evolvability .
the next experiments explore the hypothesis that a qualitatively more pervasive increase in evolvability ( i.e. an overall bias towards genotypes with higher evolvability ) can result from population growth and niches with limited capacity .
first , an extension of the abstract passive drift model is considered .
abstract model with limited capacity niches this section considers a variation of the abstract model introduced earlier , but where the size of the population varies dynamically ( previously this size was fixed ) .
in particular , the population grows geometrically ( i.e. each organism is replaced by two offspring in the next generation ) , but the overall size of the population remains tractable because in this model niches are limited in capacity ( i.e. when a new generation is created , niches can grow only to a certain size , after which further individuals entering that niche are discarded ) .
the idea is to roughly model the concept of limited resources in natural evolution and explore its effect on evolvability .
importantly , this extended model still imposes no direct selection pressure for evolvability , and if the model started at equilibrium ( i.e. with all niches at full capacity ) , there would be no expectation of evolvability increasing over time .
in other words , what is important for evolvability in this model is spreading through the space of niches .
furthermore , selection within a niche is purely random - there is no selection for adaptation to the niche nor any way for one organism to reliably out - compete another .
thus this is a model without adaptive pressure .
however , despite this lack of adaptive pressure , as evolution progresses in this model the passive filtering effect of the phenotypic space demonstrated in the fixed - sized population model is amplified .
the explanation is that the resulting population growth from founding a new niche ( by mutating out of the zone of previously explored niches ) indirectly rewards increasing evolvability in this model : the more evolvable organisms ( which because of their higher velocity of phenotypic change are more likely to mutate into new niches ) are continually amplified from population growth as they diffuse through niches .
thus as more niches are discovered and filled , the population becomes increasingly biased towards evolvability ; in effect , the reward for discovering a new niche in this model accelerates the filtering process that is purely passive in the passive drifting model .
this acceleration is shown in figure 5 , which compares evolvability in this model to that of the passive drift model introduced earlier .
note that the figure shows growth in overall evolvability ( i.e. averaged over all organisms ) in the limited capacity niche model that greatly outpaces the growth in the passive drift model ( which is only significant when averaged over niches ) .
in other words , superficial niche - level evolvability in the passive drift model grows more slowly than evolvability over all genotypes in the limited capacity niche model .
this result is important because it demonstrates a true increase in average evolvability over a population without selection pressure to out - compete other organisms .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0062186.g005 figure 5 true increasing evolvability in the abstract model with limited capacity niches .
how the average evolvability of organisms in the population changes over time is shown ( averaged over 50 independent simulations that lasted 1000 generations each ) .
note that the line shown for the passive model ( reproduced from figure 0 ) represents only the appearance of increasing evolvability in that model when evolvability is averaged over niches .
similarly to the first model , figure 6 shows a heat - map of evolvability over the niche space averaged over all runs , and figure 7 shows how evolvability varies over the niche space as a function of a niche 's distance from the starting niche .
there is a strong significant monotonic relationship between the distance from starting niche and evolvability ( ; pearson 's r ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0062186.g006 figure 6 evolvability heat map for the abstract model with limited capacity niches .
the average evolvability of organisms in each niche at the end of a simulation is shown .
the lighter the color , the more evolvable individuals are within that niche .
the overall result is that , as in the first model , evolvability increases with increasing distance from the starting niche in the center .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0062186.g007 figure 7 evolvability vs. distance from the initial niche for the abstract model with limited - capacity niches .
the average evolvability of organisms in the final population is shown as a function of distance from the initial starting niche averaged over 50 independent simulations .
the main result is that there is a significant correlation between increasing distance from the initial niche and increasing evolvability .
the plotted line indicates the line of best fit by linear regression .
evolved robots model with limited capacity niches like the previous extension to the abstract model , this section extends the drifting model with simulated evolved robots to include population growth and limited capacity niches .
the idea is to explore whether this more realistic genotype - phenotype mapping will also exhibit the same accelerated increase of evolvability seen from extending the abstract model .
the results of this experiment are shown in figure 8 , and confirm that limiting niche capacity also biases population growth more strongly towards increasing evolvability in this more concrete genetic space .
in other words , the limited niche capacity models ( both the abstract model and the model with evolved robots ) demonstrate a bias towards true evolvability ( i.e. when averaged over the entire population ) while the passive drift models exhibit a weaker bias towards evolvability that is significant only when averaged over niches .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0062186.g008 figure 8 true increasing evolvability in the evolved robots model with limited capacity niches .
the evolvability of organisms is shown averaged over 50 independent simulations that lasted 250 generations each .
it is important to note that because the population size in the limited - niche model is much smaller , one generation of the passive model encompasses more individuals ( 2,000,000 ) than is considered over all generations in the niched model ( on average ) .
in other words , the limited - niche model is more directedly and more efficiently biased towards evolvability .
in particular , the difference in evolvability between the limited - niche model and the passive model is significant for all comparisons after the 50th generation ( ; student 's t - test ) .
practical er model with limited capacity niches finally , the last model explores evolvability in a less restricted space of anns .
the idea is to examine whether the hypotheses in this paper hold even in a commonly used practical er system .
in particular , this model explores a limited - capacity niched model ( as in the previous two experiments ) but with a well - established practical neuroevolution method called neat [ 18 ] .
instead of having only three discrete settings for ann connection weights ( i.e. inhibitory , excitatory , or neutral ) , the connection weights in neat can vary continuously in strength .
additionally , to facilitate increasingly complex evolved behaviors , the topology of the ann can itself become increasingly complex because of mutations that incrementally introduce new connections and nodes during evolution .
as a result of continuous weights and increasing complexity , the space of anns that neat explores is effectively infinite and cannot be fully enumerated as in the previous model .
however , the benefit is that this class of genetic space is more analogous to that provided by dna in nature , which is also open - ended in a similar way .
because the space cannot be fully enumerated due to computational limits , it is impossible to fully characterize the genotypic space and precisely calculate evolvability ( as was done in the fully passive model ) .
this full characterization of the space also facilitated efficient simulation of millions of evolved robots through a precomputed look - up table that mapped a genotype to its niche and evolvability .
such a table is impossible to construct for the practical er model , and thus only the limited niche capacity setup is implemented here ( because it exhibits a driven trend towards evolvability increase that is not dependent on a large population size ) .
as in the prior robot controller models , the niche space consists of a discretized grid of the possible locations to which a robot can navigate within the maze .
the evolvability of a genotype is estimated ( because the space cannot be exhaustively enumerated ) by counting how many phenotypic niches are reachable from many independent random mutations of the original genotype .
as a control to show that niching robots in a structured way is having a positive effect on evolvability , a comparison experiment is also run where niching is random ( i.e. an ann 's niche is specified by a random number generator instead of being derived from the robot 's behavior ) .
in other words , the random control does not consistently reward behaviors that are different from those already present in the system .
the results of these experiments are shown in figure 9 , which reinforce the hypotheses in this paper by similarly demonstrating the benefits for evolvability of population growth with limited niche capacity in a more realistic genetic setting .
note that as in the previous two experiments , limiting niche capacity encourages true evolvability growth .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0062186.g009 figure 9 evolvability in the practical er model with limited capacity niches .
the average evolvability of organisms in the population over evolutionary time is shown , which is itself averaged over 50 independent simulations that lasted 50,000 evaluations each .
note that evolvability of an organism is measured as the average number of different behaviors generated through 300 random mutations .
the main result is that niching based on behavior significantly increases evolvability over a control that randomly assigns niches independently of an organism 's behavior ( for all comparisons after 2,500 evaluations ; student 's t - test ) .
conclusions this paper presented evidence for two non - adaptive explanations for the appearance of increasing evolvability over the course of biological evolution .
the first is that an unbiased drifting process over genotypes can nonetheless produce a distribution of phenotypes ( where multiple individuals in the population may have the same phenotype ) biased towards increasing evolvability , and the second is that founder effects for discovering niches can provide a genotypic bias towards true evolvability increase .
while such non - adaptive explanations do not contradict more popular adaptive explanations , they call them into question because the mechanisms shown here require fewer assumptions , i.e. they result from the structure of the genotype - phenotype map and founder effects from uncovering new niches instead of particular transient selective pressures .
in fact , the results from the passive drift models suggest even caution in the assumption that evolvability in general has truly increased over evolutionary time ; the superficial appearance of overall increasing evolvability can result from evolvable organisms filling a larger volume of phenotypic space .
however , even assuming that evolvability has truly increased , these results still illustrate the danger in habitually viewing evolution through the lens of selection pressure .
an alternative perspective through which to interpret the results is to view evolution as a process driven to diversity as it expands through new niches .
such niche expansion is a ratcheting process , whereby niches rarely go unfilled after being discovered .
the founder effect and population growth from uncovering new niches serve to bias the genotypic space towards increasing evolvability because they amplify genomes that diverge phenotypically , which on average tend to be those that are more evolvable .
thus if the assumption of evolvability 's heritability holds , then such founder effects in establishing new niches may yield a persistent bias towards increasing evolvability - even in the absence of adaptive competition between organisms .
in this view increasing evolvability may simply be an inevitable result of open - ended exploration of a rich genetic space .
importantly , in nature this passive drive towards evolvability may have bootstrapped the evolution of the genotype - phenotype map itself. that is , the genotypic code and biological development themselves are encoded within organisms , and mutations that alter the structure of the genetic space or genotype - phenotype map may also lead to more or less phenotypic possibilities .
in this way , the emergence of a complex evolvable genotypic code and biological development may have been bootstrapped from far simpler reproductive processes by similar non - adaptive mechanisms .
in other words , there may be no selective benefit for development or a complex genetic system , which may do no more than potentiate greater phenotypic possibilities .
in this way the story of biological evolution may be more fundamentally about an accelerating drive towards diversity than competition over limited resources .
methods the following sections provide more details on the experimental models used in the experiments in this paper .
note that all error bars in figures indicate 95 % confidence intervals around the mean , and statistically significant differences are measured by student 's t - test with a p - value of 0.01 unless otherwise noted .
abstract model details for both abstract models , at the beginning of the simulation each individual 's evolvability was initialized to 0.05 .
at the beginning of each generation , an individual 's niche is perturbed with a probability equivalent to its evolvability , and its evolvability itself is perturbed with a fixed probability ( 0.01 ) .
changes in evolvability are drawn from a uniform distribution between - 0.005 and 0.005 .
in the abstract passive drift model , the population consisted of 40,000 individuals that evolved solely due to genetic drift for 3,000 generations .
in the model with limited capacity niches , niches were limited to 5 individuals each , and the population was initialized in the first generation with a single individual .
each individual has two offspring in the next generation , which results in geometric population growth except when the niche of an offspring is already filled .
evolution proceeds for 3,000 generations .
evolved robot model details in all experiments with evolved machines , a genome that maps to an ann controls a simulated wheeled robot ( figure 10 ) with rangefinder sensors in a maze environment ( figure 11 ) .
the experimental setup follows prior precedent [ 14 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0062186.g010 figure 10 wheeled robot .
the simulated mobile robot is shown that is used in the experiments with evolved machines .
rangefinder sensors allow the robot to perceive obstacles , and the motors controlling its wheels enable the robot to traverse its environment .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0062186.g011 figure 11 maze environment .
a top - down view of the maze is shown that robots navigate in the experiments with evolved machines .
the circle indicates where a robot begins its trial in the maze , which lasts for 400 simulated timesteps .
a uniform 20x20 grid is superimposed over the maze for calculating robots' niches .
a robot 's behavioral niche ( applied for measuring evolvability in both experiments , as well as to limit population growth in the limited niche capacity experiment ) is determined by the grid square within which the robot ends at the termination of an evaluation .
the fixed - topology ann providing the basis for the enumerated genotypic space of anns is shown in figure 12 .
in particular , the genetic space spans variants of a fully - connected recurrent ann with two input nodes , three hidden nodes , and two output nodes .
in total , this kind of ann has eighteen possible ann connections that can either be disabled , excitatory , or inhibatory .
thus the space investigated with this model consists of 318 , or 38.7 million possible genotypes .
the evolvability of each genome is calculated by first enumerating the genomes reachable from it by all possible single connection mutations , and then counting the unique number of behavioral niches that those genomes encode when evaluated in the maze navigation environment .

the figure illustrates the fully - connected recurrent ann with 18 possible connections that serves as a space of possible controllers for robots embedded in a maze navigation environment .
each connection can either be excitatory ( a weight of 1.0 ) , inhibitory () or neutral ( 0.0 ) .
the activation function in the ann is a steepened sigmoid function [ 18 ] .
the ann has three rangefinder sensor inputs , two hidden neurons , and two motor outputs .
the drifting model in the enumerated ann space starts with two million genotypes initialized in each run to the same random starting genotype .
the system then drifts for 250 generations .
practical er model details the practical er model experiment uses the neat algorithm [ 18 ] , which relaxes the constraints of fixed ann topology and discrete connection weights .
the ann also provides a greater resolution of sensors , i.e. six rangefinder sensors instead of three .
note that the resolution was reduced in the fixed topology ann models for combinatorial reasons .
the initial neat network topology is shown in figure 13 .
all neat parameters are the same as those in lehman and stanley [ 14 ] , which has the same experimental er maze setup .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0062186.g013 figure 13 neat ann .
the initial topology of the ann in the practical er model is shown .
topologies change during evolution from structural mutations that add new nodes and connections .
in addition , unlike in the restricted ann space , connection weights can vary continuously , i.e. weight mutations perturb connections with values drawn from the uniform distribution , and weights are capped between and 3.0 .
note that the evolvability of a genome is calculated similarly to how it is with the enumerated ann space , i.e. by counting the unique number of niches encoded by genomes in its mutational neighborhood .
however , because all reachable mutations cannot be feasibly enumerated in the practical model , instead 200 mutations of a given genome are randomly sampled to generate a reasonable estimate of its evolvability .

elucidating the cause of syncope is often a diagnostic challenge .
at present , there is a myriad of ambulatory cardiac monitoring modalities available for recording cardiac rhythm during spontaneous symptoms .
we provide a comprehensive review of these devices and discuss strategies on how to reach the elusive diagnosis based on current evidencebased recommendations .
keywords : syncope loop recorder holter monitor cardiac monitor .
introduction syncope is defined as a transient loss of consciousness secondary to transient global reduction in cerebral blood flow characterized by rapid onset , short duration and spontaneous complete recovery [ 1 ] .
syncope is a frequently encountered clinical conundrum with an estimated lifetime prevalence of up to 35 % [ 2 ] .
syncope accounts for up to 3 % of emergency department consultations and 6 % of hospital admissions [ 3 - 5 ] .
although the diagnosis may be evident in a minor number of classic presentations , delineating the underlying cause of unexplained syncope can pose a clinical challenge , which is difficult yet worthwhile , as identification of underlying cardiac disease in patients with syncope is associated with higher rates of mortality and morbidity [ 6 ] .
the most important aspect of the diagnostic challenge is to obtain a comprehensive history and physical examination [ 7 , 8 ] .
the ideal but often unattainable test for elucidating a cause is obtaining comprehensive physiologic data during spontaneous symptoms .
short of that goal , establishing an accurate symptom - rhythm correlation can often provide a diagnosis , making ambulatory outpatient monitoring a powerful diagnostic tool for the evaluation of cardiac arrhythmias .
evolving technologies have provided a wide array of monitoring options for patients suspected of having cardiac arrhythmias , with each modality differing in duration of monitoring , quality of recording , convenience , and invasiveness .
holter monitoring a standard ecg should be ordered for all patients with syncope [ 3 - 9 ] .
short term ecg monitoring via 3 or , in some cases , 12 surface electrodes is the most common initial investigation in patients who present with syncope or palpitations .
typically this occurs in the emergency room or primary care setting with telemetry and continuous monitoring .
more recently , however , wireless telemetry offers the possibility of reviewing continuous ecg recordings instantaneously at particular access points [ 10 ] .
the findings on ecg monitoring must be correlated with symptoms , as heart rate , and even cardiac rhythm , is often uninformative in the absence of clinical correlation .
presyncope is a more common event during ambulatory monitoring but is less likely to be associated with an arrhythmia [ 11 , 12 ] .
additionally , the ubiquitous nature of presyncope makes it a relatively poor surrogate for the assessment of syncope .
the holter monitor is a portable battery - operated device that connects to the patient using bipolar electrodes , providing recordings from up to 12 ecg leads .
data are stored in the device using analog or digital storage media .
the data are transformed into a digital format and analyzed using interpretive software .
additional markers for patient - activated events and time correlates are included , along with a patient event diary , to allow greater diagnostic accuracy .
continuous ecg monitoring is possible for a maximum of 72 hours ( see fig. 1 ) .
this allows the documentation of cardiac rhythm during symptomatic and / or asymptomatic events .
holter monitoring is useful if the clinical history is suggestive of an arrhythmic etiology and the symptoms are frequent enough to be detected within the period of monitoring .
there are , however , a number of disadvantages to holter monitoring .
the major limitation is that patients may not experience symptoms or cardiac arrhythmias during the recording period .
the physical size of the device may impair the ability of patients to sleep comfortably or engage in activities that precipitate or reproduce symptoms .
patients are further inconvenienced because the device has to be removed while bathing .
there is also considerable variability in patient documentation and recollection of activated events , thereby compromising accurate symptom - rhythm correlation .
it is therefore not surprising that holter monitoring has a low diagnostic yield .
in several large series of patients undergoing 12 or more hours of ambulatory monitoring for investigation of syncope , only 4 % had recurrence of symptoms during monitoring [ 9 , 13 , 14 ] .
the overall diagnostic yield of holter monitoring was 19 % .
uncommon asymptomatic arrhythmias such as prolonged sinus pauses , atrio - ventricular block ( such as mobitz type ii block ) , and non - sustained ventricular tachycardia can provide important clues to the diagnosis , often leading to further investigations to rule out structural heart disease and other precipitating factors .
while these observations require prompt attention , it is important to interpret the results in the clinical context of the syncopal presentation so that common causes of syncope , such as neurocardiogenic syncope , are not unduly excluded .
an example would be nocturnal pauses in a patient with sleep apnea , easily mistaken for intrinsic sinus node disease as a cause of syncope .
it is also important to recognize that normal ambulatory ecg monitoring does not exclude an arrhythmic cause for syncope .
risk stratification scores such as the egsys score can be used to estimate the pre - test probability for cardiac syncope [ 15 ] .
if the pre - test probability is high for an arrhythmic cause , then further investigations such as prolonged monitoring or cardiac electrophysiological studies are required .
in a study which evaluated extension of holter monitoring duration to 72 h [ 13 ] , there was an increase in the number of asymptomatic arrhythmias detected , but not the overall diagnostic yield .
external event recorders external event recorders are external devices attached to patients via one to three electrodes with the ability to provide a longer period of monitoring than the standard holter monitor .
they may be patient activated or triggered automatically .
the 3 main types of external event recorders are transtelephonic monitors , external cardiac loop recorders and mobile automated cardiac outpatient telemetry ( mcot ) monitors .
transtelephonic ecg monitors are recording devices that transmit data via an analog phone line to a base station ( fig. 2 ) .
the signal is then converted to an interpretable recording that is displayed or printed as a single lead rhythm strip .
the ecg signals are collected on a real - time 1 - 2 minute loop .
an external cardiac loop recorder continuously records and stores an external single modified limb lead electrogram with a 4 - 18 minute memory buffer ( fig. 3 , left ) .
after the onset of spontaneous symptoms the patient activates the device , which stores the previous 3 - 14 minutes , and the following 1 - 4 minutes , of recorded information .
the captured rhythm strip can subsequently be uploaded and analyzed ( fig. 4 ) and often provides critical information regarding the onset of the arrhythmia .
this system can be used for weeks to months provided weekly battery changes are performed .
the recording device is attached with two leads to the patient 's chest wall and needs to be removed for bathing , and can be uncomfortable during sleep .
to allow detection of asymptomatic arrhythmias , external loop recorders with an automatic trigger algorithm have been introduced .
mcot is the most recent advancement in external ambulatory arrhythmia monitoring [ 16 ] .
patients wear two to three chest leads attached to a portable sensor that continuously records rhythm strips and transmits the ecg data of pre - specified arrhythmias in real - time to a communication hub at the patient 's home .
if the algorithms in the hub detect a significant arrhythmia in keeping with previously designated physician thresholds or if the patient activates the sensor to report symptoms , the monitor automatically transmits the patient 's ecg data to the central station using wireless communications .
the data may be screened 24 hours a day by central monitoring station technicians , with potential immediate or deferred referral to the attending physician for evaluation of symptoms , rate and / or rhythm changes .
the major drawback of this modality is patient compliance to wearing the device .
linzer et al. reported the use of patient - activated loop recorders in 57 patients with syncope and non - diagnostic findings on history , physical examination and 24 hour holter monitoring [ 17 , 18 ] .
a diagnosis was obtained in 14 of 32 patients who had recurrence of symptoms .
in the remaining 18 patients , device malfunction , patient non - compliance or inability to activate the recorder was responsible for the lack of diagnosis .
other studies have also reported similar findings [ 18 , 19 ] and demonstrated that loop recorders are complementary to 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring .
the diagnostic yield for external loop recorders in these three studies [ 17 - 19 ] ranged from 24 % - 47 % , with highest yield in patients with palpitations .
a prospective randomized clinical trial compared the utility of external loop recorders to conventional holter monitoring in a community based referral population with syncope and presyncope [ 20 ] .
not surprisingly , the ability to obtain a symptom - rhythm correlation was 22 % for holter monitoring and 56 % for the external loop recorder ( p < 0.001 ) , with duration of monitoring of 48 hours and 4 weeks , respectively .
a higher diagnostic yield was also obtained among patients randomized to holter monitoring who remained undiagnosed and crossed - over to use of a loop recorder .
this trial suggests that loop recorders should be considered as first line monitoring when attempting to establish a symptom rhythm correlation in the initial workup of patients with syncope , unless symptoms are very frequent , or a rhythm sample of 24 - 48 hours is sought .
twenty - four percent of loop recorder patients failed to activate the device properly , suggesting limited usefulness in some patients [ 20 ] .
analysis of factors pertaining to use of external loop recorders has revealed a particularly low diagnostic yield among patients who are unfamiliar with technology , live alone , or have low motivation for achieving a diagnosis [ 21 ] .
reiffel et al .
[ 22 ] retrospectively compared the results obtained by holter monitoring , loop recording and auto - triggered loop recording in 600 patients from a database of approximately 100,000 patients .
the auto - triggered loop recording approach provided a higher yield of diagnostic events ( 36 %) compared to loop recording ( 17 %) and holter monitoring ( 6.2 %) .
external event recorders appear to have the greatest role in motivated patients with frequent spontaneous symptoms that are likely to recur within 4 - 6 weeks .
given that they are non - invasive and cost effective , they should be considered in all patients in whom an arrhythmic cause for syncope is suspected , keeping in mind that long - term compliance with these devices can be challenging because of electrode and skin - related problems and waning of patient motivation in the absence of recurrent symptoms .
implantable cardiac monitors the implantable cardiac monitor ( icm ) has become the investigative tool of choice in recurrent unexplained syncope following negative initial investigations .
the icm permits prolonged monitoring without external electrodes and is ideally suited to patients with infrequent recurrent syncope thought to be due to an arrhythmic cause .
similar to the external event recorders , it is designed to correlate physiology with recorded cardiac rhythms , but is implanted and therefore devoid of surface electrodes and accompanying compliance issues .
the icm also allows for monitoring over much longer time periods than an external event recorder .
commonly available icms include the medtronic reveal ( r ) and the st jude medical confirmtm series .
a typical icm ( medtronic reveal dx model 9528 ) has a pair of sensing electrodes with 4 - cm spacing on a small elongated recording device 6.2 cm long , 1.9 cm wide , and 0.8 cm thick , weighing 15 g ( fig. 3 , center ) .
the projected battery longevity is 36 months .
the device can be implanted subcutaneously in the left chest wall with local anesthesia and antibiotic prophylaxis .
prior to implantation , cutaneous mapping should be performed to optimize the sensed signal and avoid t - wave over - sensing , which can be falsely interpreted as a high rate episode .
an adequate signal can usually be obtained anywhere in the left hemithorax [ 23 ] .
grubb et al .
[ 24 ] described an anatomic - based approach to icm placement in 63 patients that did not require cutaneous mapping .
each underwent implantation of ilr in the left upper chest area midway between the supraclavicular notch and left breast area .
in all patients , adequate electrocardiographic tracings were obtained at implant without need for preoperative cutaneous mapping .
the mean p wave amplitude was 0.12 +/ - 0.20 mv at implant and at follow - up ( 6 - 14 months post - implant ) , the amplitude was 0.11 +/ - 0.19 mv. the peak - to - peak qrs amplitude was 0.48 +/ - 0.15 mv at implant and 0.44 +/ - 0.16 mv at a follow - up of 6 - 14 months .
this strategy has not been validated .
the recorded bipolar signal is stored in the device as 42 minutes of compressed signal .
a compressed signal maximizes memory capability with only marginal loss of quality .
the patient , along with a spouse , family member or friend is instructed in the use of the activator at the time of implant .
once an episode is recorded ( i.e. a presyncopal or syncopal event occurs ) the memory is " frozen " by the patient or a relative using a non - magnetic hand held activator ( fig. 3 , right ) .
the episode is then uploaded for interrogation to a pacemaker programmer .
although heart rate is usually easily ascertained , p waves can occasionally be challenging to interpret .
the most recent version of the icm has programmable automatic detection of tachycardia - bradycardia arrhythmias , pauses and allows for comprehensive remote monitoring without an office visit .
the medtronic carelink ( r ) home monitor allows patients to transmit data from their medtronic reveal ( r ) icms over a standard phone line for review by their physicians .
the st jude medical confirmtm icms also has transtelephonic monitoring capability , enabling transmission of timely and accurate data .
these features enhance the utility of icms , especially if patients have frequent saved events or live in remote areas where travel to a dedicated clinic is time consuming and costly .
a classification system for recorded events has been proposed by brignole et al .
[ 25 ] ( table 1 ) that categorizes the probable mechanism of syncope according to the pattern of bradycardia recorded during spontaneous syncope .
an example of the cardioinhibitory component of neurocardiogenic or vasovagal syncope is illustrated in ( fig. 5 ) .
this would be considered a 1a response .
figure 6 illustrates a primary bradycardia ( 1c response ) , highly suggestive of intrinsic av node disease .
this classification is useful for research purposes for event classification , and is useful in directing therapy once validated .
currently there are several studies establishing the utility of icm in the diagnosis of syncope [ 25 - 30 ] .
one of these studies is a multi - centre study of 206 patients [ 29 ] .
the majority of patients had undergone non - invasive and invasive testing including head - up tilt testing and electrophysiological studies .
the etiology of syncope was arrhythmic in 22 % of patients [ 29 ] .
bradycardia was the most commonly detected arrhythmia ( 17 % vs. 6 % tachycardia ) , usually leading to pacemaker implantation [ 29 ] .
in a group of patients with ongoing seizures despite anticonvulsant therapy , zaidi et al. performed cardiac assessment including head - up tilt testing and carotid sinus massage in all patients , and implantation of an icm in ten patients [ 31 , 32 ] .
two of the 10 patients with an icm had marked bradycardia preceding a seizure ; one due to sinus pauses and the other due to heart block .
importantly , this study suggested seizures that are atypical in presentation may have a cardiovascular cause in as many as 42 % of cases , and cardiovascular assessment including long term cardiac monitoring with an icm may play a role in select patients with atypical seizures .
in three studies [ 3 , 33 , 34 ] from the international study on syncope of uncertain etiology ( issue ) investigators , icms were implanted in different groups of patients with syncope to assess cardiac rhythm during episodes , after conventional testing .
the first study involved tilt tests in 111 patients with unexplained syncope , and icms implanted after the tilt test , regardless of result [ 33 ] .
syncope recurred in 34 % of patients in both the tilt positive and tilt negative group , with marked bradycardia or asystole being the most commonly recorded arrhythmia during follow - up ( 46 % and 62 % respectively ) .
the heart rate during tilt testing did not predict spontaneous heart rate response , with a much higher incidence of asystole than expected based on demographics or tilt .
this study suggests that observations during tilt testing correlate poorly with cardiac rhythm during spontaneous syncope , and that bradycardia is more common in this population than previously recognized .
an example of the cardioinhibitory component of vasodepressor syncope is illustrated in ( fig. 5 ) .
in the second study , 52 patients with syncope , bundle branch block and negative electrophysiologic testing underwent icm implantation [ 3 ] .
syncope recurred in 22 of the 52 patients with conduction system disease .
long term monitoring demonstrated marked bradycardia mainly attributed to complete av block in 17 , while it excluded av block in 2 .
this study confirmed that negative electrophysiologic testing does not exclude intermittent complete av block , and that prolonged monitoring or consideration of permanent pacing is reasonable in this population .
the third study examined the spontaneous rhythm in 35 patients with syncope , overt heart disease and negative electrophysiologic testing [ 34 ] .
the underlying heart disease was predominantly ischemic or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with moderate left ventricular dysfunction .
although previous studies have suggested that patients with negative electrophysiologic testing have a better prognosis , there remains concern regarding risk of ventricular tachycardia in this group .
symptoms recurred in 19 of the 35 patients ( 54 %) , with bradycardia in 4 , supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in 5 and ventricular tachycardia in only 1 patient .
there were no sudden deaths during 16 +/ - 11 months of follow - up. issue 2 was a prospective , multicenter observational study that investigated the efficacy of therapies based on icm diagnosis of recurrent suspected neurocardiogenic syncope [ 35 ] .
the 1 - year recurrence rate of syncope in 392 patients was 33 % .
among 103 patients with a documented episode , 53 patients were randomized to specific therapy ; 47 receiving a pacemaker due to asystole and 6 receiving anti - tachyarrhythmia therapy ( catheter ablation : 4 , implantable defibrillator : 1 , anti - arrhythmic drug : 1 ) .
the remaining 50 patients did not receive specific therapy .
the 1 - year recurrence rate among the 53 patients assigned to a specific therapy was 10 % compared with 41 % in the patients without specific therapy .
the 1 - year recurrence rate in patients with pacemakers was 5 % .
the authors concluded that a strategy based on diagnostic information from early icm implant , with therapy delayed until documentation of syncope , allows safe , specific , and effective therapy in patients with neurocardiogenic syncope .
picture ( place of reveal in the care pathway and treatment of patients with unexplained recurrent syncope ) is the largest prospective , multicenter , observational study to date to evaluate the usage and diagnostic effectiveness of icms in the everyday clinical diagnostic work - up of patients with unexplained syncope [ 36 ] .
patients were followed up until the first recurrence of syncope leading to a diagnosis or for >= 1 year .
in the course of the study , patients were evaluated by an average of 3 different specialists for syncope management and underwent a median of 13 tests ( range 9 - 20 ) .
follow - up visit data were available for 570 subjects .
the percentages of patients with recurrence of syncope were 19 , 26 , and 36 % after 3 , 6 , and 12 months , respectively. of 218 events within the study , icm - guided diagnosis was obtained in 170 cases ( 78 %) , of which 128 ( 75 %) were cardiac .
the results revealed that patients underwent a large number of diagnostic tests before an icm implant and the use of an icm was associated with a high diagnostic yield in the overall population with unexplained syncope .
together , these findings imply that if an icm is implanted early , a reduced number of tests might be needed .
there have been two randomized trials that compared the role of the icm with a conventional testing strategy for syncope .
the randomized assessment of syncope trial ( rast ) [ 27 , 37 ] was a prospective randomized trial that compared early use of the icm for prolonged monitoring to conventional testing in patients undergoing a cardiac workup for unexplained syncope .
a diagnosis was obtained in 14 of 27 patients randomized to one year icm monitoring , compared to 6 of 30 undergoing conventional testing with external loop recorder , tilt test and electrophysiology study ( 52 % vs. 20 % , p = 0.012 ) .
overall , prolonged monitoring was more likely to result in a diagnosis than conventional testing ( 55 % vs. 19 % , p = 0.0014 ) .
bradycardia was detected in 14 patients undergoing monitoring , compared to 3 patients with conventional testing ( 40 % vs. 8 % , p = 0.005 ) .
these data highlight the diverse etiology of syncope , and also illustrate the limitations of conventional diagnostic techniques .
although there is clear selection bias in enrollment of patients referred to an electrophysiologist for workup , this study suggests that tilt testing has a modest yield when applied to all patients undergoing investigation for unexplained syncope , and that electrophysiologic testing is of very limited utility in patients with preserved left ventricular function .
also , in patients with a negative electrophysiology study for suspected arrhythmia tilt testing has been shown to be of little value in predicting the mechanism of syncope [ 38 ] .
the other randomized study is the eastbourne syncope assessment study ( easyas ) [ 39 ] .
two hundred and one patients presenting to a single institution with recurrent syncope without a definite diagnosis following a basic clinical work - up were randomly assigned to icm implantation ( n = 103 ) or conventional investigation and management ( n = 98 ) .
over a mean follow - up period of 276 +/ - 134 days , there were further syncopal events in 43 % of the icm group compared with 33 % of the conventional strategy group .
thirty - three patients in the icm group and four in the conventional strategy group received an electrocardiographic diagnosis ( 33 % vs 4 % , hr 8.93 , 95 % ci 3.17 to 25.2 , p < 0.0001 ) .
seventeen - month follow - up data from the same group of patients were reported in 2006 [ 40 ] .
forty - three per cent of the icm group and 6 % of the conventional testing strategy group received an electrocardiographic diagnosis ( hr 6.53 , 95 % ci 3.73 to 11.4 , p < 0.0001 ) .
strategies for choosing prolonged monitoring table 2 summarizes the comparative advantages , limitations and indications for the various modes of ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring .
the literature , including recently updated guidelines and position papers from the european society of cardiology and european heart rhythm association [ 1,41 ] , supports the early use of the icm in an initial phase of the diagnostic work - up of patients with recurrent unexplained syncope .
the optimal patient for prolonged monitoring with an external event recorder or icm has symptoms suspicious for arrhythmia ; namely abrupt onset with minimal prodrome , typically brief loss of consciousness and complete resolution of symptoms within seconds to minutes .
issue 2 suggested that documentation of the cardioinhibitory component of vasovagal syncope might identify a group of patients that respond well to pacing .
brignole and colleagues addressed this hypothesis , by evaluating the effect of placebo pacing therapy [ 42 ] .
syncope recurred in 38 % of patients randomized to placebo vs. 34 % randomized to no treatment .
the recurrence rate with active cardiac pacing was 15 % .
the authors suggested that the use of specific selection criteria for pacing , such as characteristics of the observed cardioinhibitory reflex may identify those who will respond to cardiac pacing [ 42 ] .
after clinical assessment , including assessment of left ventricular function , a decision must be made if the patient 's underlying condition is potentially life threatening .
all reports using the icm have suggested a low incidence of life - threatening arrhythmia or significant morbidity with a prolonged monitoring strategy .
this suggests a good prognosis for patients with recurrent unexplained syncope in the absence of left ventricular dysfunction or with negative electrophysiologic testing .
this finding was particularly striking in the negative electrophysiologic testing arm of the issue study ( see discussion above ) .
lastly , syncope fails to recur during long term monitoring in almost one third of patients even in the presence of frequent episodes prior to icm implantation .
this suggests that the cause of syncope in some instances is self - limiting , reflecting a transient physiologic abnormality .
conclusions syncope , although relatively common , remains a significant diagnostic dilemma for clinicians , despite advances in knowledge pertaining to mechanism .
a careful history and physical examination are crucial in the course of differentiating syncope from other causes of loss of consciousness .
the ultimate diagnostic goal is to correlate symptoms to rhythm disturbances , and accurate attainment of this goal requires the judicious use of monitoring strategies .
ambulatory cardiac monitoring has provided a powerful means to elucidate etiology of presyncope or syncope .
the choice of ambulatory monitoring modality is influenced by index of suspicion of cardiac arrhythmias , frequency and nature of symptoms and diagnostic yield of the monitoring device .
the clinician should consider early use of icms and when an arrhythmia is suspected based on clinical presentation and initial non - invasive testing .

the recording device is worn by the patient using a shoulder strap or belt loop , attached to 3 - 5 skin electrodes for continuous monitoring .
an event button ( not shown ) at the top of the housing of the device is pressed in the event of symptoms to mark the recording .
see text for discussion. fig. ( 2 ) transtelephonic monitors .
the device is lightweight and portable .
four recording electrodes are present on the back of the device to permit single lead rhythm strip capture .
a record button ( top left ) is pressed at the onset of symptoms , and the recorded event is transmitted to a base station over an analog phone line. fig. ( 3 ) loop recorders .
an external loop recorder ( left ) with cables that attach to the patient .
the record button is pressed in the event of symptoms to store the previous 9 minutes , and the ensuing minute .
the phone receiver is also placed over this button to transmit data over an analog phone line .
an implantable cardiac monitor ( center ) and patient activator ( right ) .
the patient activator is used to " freeze " symptomatic events that are retrieved with a pacemaker programmer .
automatic events can also be captured ( see text for discussion ). fig. ( 4 ) external loop recorder tracing .
sinus rhythm during presyncope is recorded in a 43 - year - old female with recurrent unexplained syncope and presyncope .
the fluctuation in heart rate is suggestive of neurocardiogenic syncope. fig. ( 5 ) automatic event detection from an icm .
this is a typical tracing of an event captured by an icm during syncope in a patient .
the arrow and letter a denotes automatic activation when the device detects a 3 second pause .
each line constitutes 10 seconds of a single lead rhythm strip .
note the slowing of the sinus rate prior to onset of a prolonged pause , which resulted in syncope .
this is consistent with the diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope ( issue classification 1a ). fig. ( 6 ) manual event detection from an icm .
manual activation during presyncope in a 73 - year - old male with two previous episodes of unexplained syncope .
note that the sinus rate and pr interval are unchanged surrounding the period of 2:1 av conduction .
this is classified as a 1c response by the proposed issue classification , suggesting intrinsic av node disease .

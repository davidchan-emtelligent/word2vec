while many groups demonstrated new muscle tissue formation after muscle precursor cell ( mpc ) injection , the capacity of these cells to heal muscle damage , for example , sphincter in stress urinary incontinence , in long - term is still limited .
therefore , the first goal of our project was to optimize the functional regenerative potential of hmpc by genetic modification to overexpress human peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 - alpha ( hpgc - 1alpha ) , key regulator of exercise - mediated adaptation .
moreover , we aimed at establishing a feasible methodology for noninvasive pet visualization of implanted cells and their microenvironment in muscle crush injury model .
pgc - 1alpha - bioengineered muscles showed enhanced marker expression for myogenesis ( alpha - actinin , myhc , and desmin ) , vascularization ( vegf ) , neuronal ( ache ) , and mitochondrial ( coxiv ) activity .
consistently , use of hpgc - 1alpha _ hmpcs produced significantly increased contractile force one to three weeks postinjury .
pet imaging showed distinct differences in radiotracer signals ([ 18f ] fallypride and [ 11c ] raclopride ( both targeting dopamine 2 receptors ( d2r )) and [ 64cu ] nodaga - rgd ( targeting neovascularization )) between gfp _ hmpcs and hd2r _ hpgc - 1alpha _ hmpcs .
after muscle harvesting , inflammation levels were in parallel to radiotracer uptake amount , with significantly lower uptake in hpgc - 1alpha overexpressing samples .
in summary , we facilitated early functional muscle tissue regeneration , introducing a novel approach to improve skeletal muscle regeneration .
besides successful tracking of hmpcs in muscle crush injuries , we showed that in high - inflammation areas , the specificity of radioligands might be significantly reduced , addressing a possible bottleneck of neovascularization pet imaging .

introduction a promising treatment option for various muscle - related diseases , for example , stress urinary incontinence , is the use of autologous stem cells for restoration of damaged muscle fibers , for example , in the urinary sphincter .
muscle precursor cells ( mpcs ) represent the cell population that has been shown to be indispensable for skeletal muscle regeneration [ 1 ] .
due to their potential to differentiate into myoblasts and the ability to later form new contractile myofibers , mpcs are being investigated for muscle tissue engineering and reconstruction in the treatment of a variety of muscle diseases [ 2 - 4 ] .
still , two main concerns about their successful and safe clinical application are unsolved : the volumetric loss of the bioengineered tissues over time and the missing tools for noninvasive imaging of the fate of the implanted cells .
a major shortcoming of the implantation of hmpcs is their decreased growth capacity in the aged population [ 5 - 7 ] .
this challenge for autologous cell therapy may be addressed by exercise and / or therapeutic regulation of gene expression , which enhances the ability of mpcs to restore muscle fibers .
reduced physical activity is linked to many chronic diseases .
the understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the regeneration of impaired muscle tissue ( e.g. , damaged urinary sphincter ) is vital for the development of proper treatment strategies .
one key player in the regulation of exercise - mediated adaptations and of neuromuscular activity of skeletal muscles is the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( ppar ) gamma coactivator 1alpha ( pgc - 1alpha ) [ 8 , 9 ] .
its expression in muscle tissue is proportional to the amount of exercise and has been shown to counteract atrophy [ 10 ] .
atrophy is a major limitation hindering skeletal muscle tissue bioengineering .
pgc - 1alpha plays an essential role in the regulation of cellular differentiation , development , and metabolism ( carbohydrate , lipids , and protein ) of higher organisms [ 10 , 11 ] .
pgc - 1alpha is further regulating the mitochondrial biogenesis and is adapting the oxidative state in muscles .
in skeletal muscle , pgc - 1alpha is abundant and particularly enriched in slow - twitch , oxidative muscle fibers , containing a large number of mitochondria .
importantly , oxidative muscle fibers are the dominant type in the external urinary sphincter [ 12 ] .
it has been shown that increased levels of pgc - 1alpha can promote a shift in the fiber composition toward high - endurance muscle fibers [ 13 , 14 ] .
furthermore , this muscle phenotype is characterized by pronounced tissue vascularization [ 15 ] , increased myoglobin levels , and enhanced import of glucose , lipids , and lactate [ 16 ] .
in addition , pgc - 1alpha tightly links muscle and nerve by regulating neuromuscular junction genes and by promoting clustering of acetylcholine receptors ( achr ) at the motor endplate [ 17 ] .
it has been proposed that pgc - 1alpha controls muscle plasticity and suppresses a broad inflammatory response [ 18 ] .
there is further evidence suggesting that oxidative metabolism and inflammation counteract each other in muscle tissue , outlining the central function of pgc - 1 alpha in muscle recovery .
therefore , emphasizing the use of pgc - 1alpha alteration opens up for novel muscle tissue engineering approaches [ 19 ] and possible clinical applications [ 20 ] in urology and beyond .
besides the volumetric loss of bioengineered tissues , another shortcoming in the field is the missing tools for noninvasive imaging of this cell therapy .
research towards the noninvasive imaging of autologous stem cell therapies is of high importance as both repeated biopsy and access to many organs are often not clinically feasible .
several modalities are being investigated for their applicability in cell tracking and cell metabolism read - outs [ 21 ] .
while mri has lower sensitivity compared to radionuclide - based tools and bioluminescence has poor spatial resolution , pet / ct is a system with both high sensitivity and resolution [ 21 ] .
additionally , although imaging reporter genes are available for fluorescence , bioluminescence , and mri , only radionuclide - based reporter genes are currently investigated for use in patients [ 22 - 27 ] .
in our previous work , we developed a feasible method for in vivo tracking of subcutaneously injected hmpcs using [ 18f ] fallypride , a well - established dopamine 2 receptor ( hd2r ) pet ligand [ 28 ] .
after the successful generation of adenoviruses for the overexpression of a signalling - deficient hd2r in hmpcs , we were able to establish an ex situ model for imaging of bioengineered muscle tissue [ 28 ] .
this encouraged us to concentrate our further investigations towards the applicability of these methods in an in situ muscle crush model studying skeletal muscle regeneration , thereby coming closer to a model for studying urinary sphincter muscle restoration .
in this regard , we aimed at examining the influence of genetically modified hpgc - 1alpha overexpressing hmpcs , injected in a skeletal muscle after crush injury , specifically investigating the effect on tissue regeneration and muscle contractility .
we expected to improve the cellular therapy for clinical implementation in stress urinary incontinence patients in the future , restoring the functionality of the external urinary sphincter ( predominantly oxidative type fibers [ 12 ]) .
moreover , we used a method for noninvasive pet tracking by ectopic hd2r expression in the implanted cells [ 28 ] and visualization of the neovascularization in the regenerating muscle tissue .
we hypothesize that by enhancing the hpgc - 1alpha expression in hmpcs , we can improve the regeneration capacity and contractility of the injured muscles .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
isolation and expansion of hmpcs human muscle biopsies from the m. rectus abdominis were collected upon ethical approval and with informed consent of 6 hospitalized patients undergoing abdominal surgery under general anesthesia .
the patients were selected according to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria , assuring the optimal quality of the muscle biopsy ( e.g. , no muscular dystrophy , hormonal therapy , and chronic infectious diseases ) .
the samples were processed according to established protocols [ 29 ] .
briefly , each muscle biopsy was first minced and digested with collagenase type i 0.2 % ( w / v ) ( sigma ) and dispase 0.4 % ( w / v ) ( gibco ) .
the enzymatic reaction was terminated with medium containing 10 % fbs .
individual fibers were then liberated by rigorous pipetting and filtered through a strainer with a pore size of 100 mum .
after centrifugation , the pellet was resuspended in culture medium and the muscle fibers transferred into 35 mm dishes coated with collagen type i ( 1 mg / ml ) ( bd ) .
the culture medium consisted of dmem / f12 , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin , 18 % fbs , 10 ng / ml hegf ( sigma ) , 1 ng / ml hbfgf ( sigma ) , 10 mug / ml human insulin ( sigma ) , and 0.4 mug / ml dexamethasone ( sigma ) [ 29 ] .
after 24 h , a fibroblast reduction step was performed by replating the cells .
the cultured hmpcs were characterized as published before [ 14 , 29 ] .
2.2 .
adenoviral design and transduction the adeasy system was used as a tool for recombinant adenovirus generation .
for the first construct , n - terminal ha - tagged human pgc - 1alpha was cloned into an adenoviral vector that codes for cmv promoter - driven green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) .
the expression of hpgc - 1alpha was also under the control of a cmv promoter , thereby ensuring its robust , constitutive expression [ 14 ] .
for the second construct , phenylalanine 411 of the human d2r was mutated into alanine ( f411a ) to obtain a signalling - deficient human dopamine d2 receptor that still binds ligands in a normal manner but will not activate intracellular signalling upon ligand binding [ 28 , 30 ] .
as a control for viral infection , a gfp adenovirus was used .
the viral titer was increased through additional amplification steps and quantified by fluorescent microscopy .
the optimal multiplicity of infection ( moi ) was measured by serial titrations of the viral vectors on hmpcs and simultaneous determination of fluorescent cells , cell toxicity , and cell viability and proliferation .
detailed descriptions of the performed assays were published before [ 14 , 28 ] .
finally , the transduced hmpcs were expanded for 2 days after infection and were injected at the injured site in nude mice .
2.3 .
animal experimentation all animal experiments were approved by and performed according to the local commission for animal experiments .
a total of 49 female 8 - week - old , nude mice ( charles river , germany ) received hind limb lateral incisions on both sides ( from the inferior tibiofibular joint up to the knee joint ) under general anesthesia ( 3 % isoflurane ) and aseptic conditions , according to a modified published protocol [ 31 ] .
briefly , a coronal plane beneath the tibialis anterior ( ta ) was opened , separating the muscle from the tibia .
the lower jaw of nonserrated forceps was gently inserted below the ta. crush injury was performed by closing the forceps to its first stage for 3 seconds .
the forceps was gently removed , the hmpc collagen suspension was injected , and the wound was closed .
each injection contained 6 x 106 transduced hmpcs , which were gently mixed with 100 mul collagen type i carrier ( final concentration : 2 mg / ml ) ( bd ) prior to injection .
a volume of 30 mul of the collagen cell suspension could be injected without leakage .
the muscles were harvested 9 +/ - 1 days ( early ) , 18 +/ - 3 days ( midterm ) , or 31 +/ - 3 days ( late ) after injection .
the deviation in time periods was mandatory due to a complex regimen in repetitive pet imaging with different tracers in the same animal .
2.4 .
radiosynthesis of [ 11c ] raclopride the radiosynthesis of [ 11c ] raclopride was successfully accomplished using an established procedure in our lab .
briefly , cyclotron - produced [ 11c ] co2 gas was reacted with h2 using ni catalyst to afford [ 11c ] ch4 , which was passed through an i2 column to yield [ 11c ] ch3i .
[ 11c ] ch3i was then reacted with the desmethyl precursor for 5 min at 90degreesc .
after hplc purification and spe extraction , [ 11c ] raclopride was obtained in 99 % radiochemical purity with a maximal specific activity of 239 gbq / mumol .
a total of 1.09 - 1.72 gbq of [ 11c ] raclopride was obtained in an injectable solution of 5 % etoh in 0.15 m pbs .
pet scans with [ 11c ] raclopride were acquired from 0 to 60 min p.i. , and time frames were averaged for data analysis .
2.5 .
radiosynthesis of [ 64cu ] nodaga - rgd in order to image neovascularization , we used [ 64cu ] nodaga - rgd to target the growth factor integrin alphavbetaiii .
ammonium ascorbate ( 0.5 m , ph 5.5 ) was added to [ 64cu ] cucl2 ( 50 mul in 0.05 n hcl ) obtained commercially or produced at paul scherrer institute ( psi ) , followed by an addition of 40 mul of nodaga peptide ( nodagac ( rgdfk ) , 1 mm in h2o ) .
labeling was carried out at 95degreesc for 15 minutes .
according to analytical hplc , 90 % of 64cu activity was chelated and only 10 % [ 64cu ] cucl2 remained unreacted .
to bind this remaining fraction , 5 mul dtpa ( 1 g / 15 ml ) was added .
the resulting [ 64cu ] dtpa complex is known to be easily excreted through the renal pathway .
animals were injected with 5 - 10 mbq [ 64cu ] nodaga - rgd in the tail vein and were imaged 17 - 22 h p.i .
2.6 .
standardized uptake value ( suv ) suv is a semiquantitative parameter representing radioactivity concentration in tissue .
it is mathematically defined as the ratio of tissue radioactivity concentration to injected radioactivity per kilogram body weight at a certain point during the pet studies .
2.7 .
immunohistological assessment the harvested ta muscles were embedded in cryopreservative ( oct embedding medium , cell path ) immediately after isolation .
cryostat sections were prepared ( 10 mum ) and further processed .
for immunohistological analysis , the tissues were fixed ( 4 % pfa , 10 min ) , permeabilized ( 0.5 % tritonx - 100 , 20 min ) , blocked for 30 min ( 5 % bsa + 0.1 % tritonx - 100 in pbs ) , and finally stained with anti - sarcomeric alpha - actinin ( 1 : 200 , sigma ) and f4 / 80 ( 1 : 100 , abcam ) over night at 4degreesc .
after washing with pbs , the tissues were incubated with cy3 anti - mouse igg secondary antibody ( 1 : 1000 , sigma ) and dapi ( 1 : 100 , sigma ) for 1 h at room temperature , washed again , and finally mounted ( dako ) .
images were acquired with a leica - imager type dm6000b at exposures normalized to unstained controls ( secondary antibody and dapi only ) .
2.8 .
macrophage staining analysis a computer - assisted approach was used to quantify macrophage ( f4 / 80 ) immunolabelling .
longitudinal ta muscle sections were imaged using the leica - imager type dm6000b , and the images used for analysis were captured from the crushed ( central ) region of the harvested muscles .
for evaluation of the signal (% area ) , 5 - 20 high - power fields ( hpf , 20x ) were analyzed by imagej per time point and per group .
2.9 .
real - time pcr for the analysis of pgc - 1alpha downstream - regulated genes and skeletal contractile muscle genes in the regenerating tissue by rtpcr , the middle of the crushed region of each harvested ta muscle was excised , pulverized in liquid nitrogen , and suspended in rna lysis buffer .
total rna was isolated using the sv total rna isolation system kit ( promega ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol , including a dnase digestion .
rna was reverse transcribed with random primers ( high - capacity cdna reverse transcription , life technologies ) .
predesigned primers for human ppargc - 1 ( hs01016719 _ m1 ) , d2dr ( dopamine 2 receptor , hs00241436 _ m1 ) , vegf ( vascular endothelial growth factor , hs00900055 _ m1 ) , myh1 ( myosin heavy chain 1 , hs00428600 _ m1 ) , myh2 ( myosin heavy chain 2 , hs00430042 _ m1 ) , desmin ( hs00157258 _ m1 ) , alpha - actinin ( hs00998100 _ m1 ) , coxiv ( cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4,hs00971639 _ m1 ) , vwf ( mm00550375 _ m1 ) , tnf - alpha ( tumor necrosis factor alpha , mm00443258 _ m1 ) , and ache ( acetyl choline esterase , hs00241307 _ m1 ) were purchased from life technologies .
18s rrna ( 4319413e ) was used to normalize cdna concentrations .
for quantification , the expression of each gene was normalized to the 18s expression in the corresponding sample .
2.10 .
organ bath ( myography ) the muscles were isolated at different time points after the lesion , and the posttraumatic functional recovery was quantitatively assessed by organ bath .
after harvesting , the tissues were kept under tension with constant oxygenation ( 95 % o2 and 5 % co2 ) in krebs solution at 25degreesc .
ta muscles were fastened with vicryl into the myograph chambers ( dmt , denmark ) and allowed to equilibrate under 15 mn ( 1.5 g ) for 20 min , adjusting the tension periodically and replacing krebs solution every 5 min .
the samples were stimulated by electrical field stimulation ( efs ) ( 80 v , 80 hz ) , and 3 measurements per sample were considered for the analysis .
native ta muscle ( ta nat ) was used as control , and the contraction force was set to 100 % .
forces of injured muscles were calculated relatively as the percentage of maximum .
the maximum tension under tetanic contraction was registered and normalized to the sample weight ( mg / mg tissue ) .
all data were collected using a labchart v7.0 ( ad instruments , spechbach , germany ) and expressed as mean +/ - s.e.m .
2.11 .
statistics for statistical analysis , ibm spss v22.0 ( spss inc. ) was used and graphics were drawn with graphpad prism v5.04 ( graphpad software inc. ) .
all data were analyzed by student 's t - tests , mann whitney u test , or one - way anova with bonferroni or lsd post hoc analysis ( p < 0.05 was considered significant ) .
all presented data are expressed as means with a corresponding standard error of the mean (+/ - sem ) .
3. results 3.1 .
pgc - 1alpha overexpressing hmpcs enhance the levels of contractile muscle markers during tissue regeneration after successful isolation , expansion , and characterization of hmpc from six patient biopsies [ 14 ] [ 28 ] , we evaluated the effects of pgc - 1alpha overexpressing hmpcs in a ta crush injury model .
to directly assess the role of pgc - 1alpha in myofiber formation , immunofluorescent microscopy and rtpcr analysis of the regenerating crushed muscle tissue were performed ( figure 1 ) .
the participation of transduced gfp - positive cells in the myotube formation ( alpha - actinin , cy3 ) over time could be visualized by fluorescent microscopy in gfp - infected samples ( figure 1 ( a )) and in pgc - 1alpha - infected samples ( figure 1 ( b )) .
in line with our previous ex situ results [ 14 ] , pgc - 1alpha overexpressing - engineered muscle tissue showed increased relative expression also at gene level for sarcomeric alpha - actinin ( 3.47 +/ - 1.45 , n = 6 , p = 0.5476 ) , myhc1 ( 6440.64 +/ - 1370.88 , n = 6 , p = 0.0238 ) , myhc2 ( 7.51 +/ - 2.03 , n = 6 , p = 0.0238 ) , and desmin ( 4.78 +/ - 1.76 , n = 6 , p = 0.0476 ) at early time points in the regenerating tissue , relative to gfp samples ( figure 1 ( c )) .
while the desmin and myhc2 gene expression reached equivalent levels in pgc - 1alpha and gfp samples over time ( figure 1 ( e ) ; 1.28 +/ - 0.29 , n = 12 , p = 0.5425 ; 0.55 +/ - 0.18 , n = 18 , p = 0.0546 ) , the expression of alpha - actinin and myhc1 remained significantly higher in pgc - 1alpha samples at late time points ( figure 1 ( e ) ; 96.15 +/ - 24.43 , n = 15 , p = 0.0092 ; 312.22 +/ - 132.8 , n = 18 , p = 0.015 ) , suggesting a hpgc - 1alpha - induced shift towards slow - twitch type fibers .
3.2 .
increased muscle contraction through pgc - 1alpha overexpressing hmpc injection after crush injury encouraged by the enhanced gene expression of contractile markers in the regenerating muscles ( figure 1 ) with increased pgc - 1alpha levels , we decided to analyze the expression of further markers , known to be involved in muscle regeneration .
the crushed / regenerating tissue was investigated by rtpcr for the expression of factors connected to vascularization ( vegf - a ) , mitochondrial activity ( coxiv ) , and neuronal activity ( ache ) .
the overexpression of hd2r and hpgc - 1alpha was sustained over time ( figures 2 ( a ) - 2 ( c )) .
notably , the pgc - 1alpha " native " expression in gfp - infected samples increased at the latest time point ( figure 2 ( c )) .
increased levels of vegf - a in hpgc - 1alpha overexpressing samples , relative to gfp ( figures 2 ( a ) - 2 ( c )) , were detected at early ( 8 - 10 d ) ( a : 2.26 +/ - 0.49 , n = 6 , p = 0.0476 ) , midterm ( 14 - 21 d ) ( b : 7.18 +/ - 2.46 , n = 21 , p = 0.1475 ) , and late ( 28 - 35 d ) ( c : 204.65 +/ - 49.7 , n = 18 , p = 0.0124 ) time points .
similarly , the pgc - 1alpha downstream - regulated mitochondrial activity was enhanced ( coxiv ) ( a : 4.32 +/ - 1.02 , n = 6 , p = 0.0238 ; b : 88.87 +/ - 38.06 , n = 21 , p = 0.1475 ; and c : 1595.35 +/ - 547.55 , n = 18 , p = 0.003 ) .
finally , the gene expression levels of ache illustrated the expected increase in the pgc - 1alpha - modified regenerating tissues ( a : 3.96 +/ - 1.04 , n = 6 , p = 0.0238 ; b : 10.52 +/ - 3.51 , n = 18 , p = 0.0012 ; and c : 9.99 +/ - 2.89 , n = 12 , p = 0.0032 ) .
in line with the enhanced gene expression of markers for contractility , vascularization , and neurons , we observed an increased muscle contraction in hpgc - 1alpha overexpressing muscles .
organ bath measurement at 80 v and 80 hz revealed significantly elevated contraction force at early ( pgc - 1alpha : 43.75 +/ - 5.27 , n = 6 ; gfp : 28.36 +/ - 2.89 , n = 13 , p = 0.0337 ) and midterm ( pgc - 1alpha : 89.49 +/ - 6.14 , n = 33 ; gfp : 69.85 +/ - 7.12 , n = 18 , p = 0.0435 ) time points in hpgc - 1alpha - treated muscles ( figure 2 ( d )) .
at late time points , both hpgc - 1alpha and gfp overexpressing muscles contracted at similar levels ( pgc - 1alpha : 82.33 +/ - 3.73 , n = 21 ; gfp : 70.52 +/ - 5.17 , n = 9 , p = 0.0830 ) as ta native control .
all measurements are relative to contraction of ta native , which was set as 100 % .
3.3 .
tracking of hmpc in a ta muscle crush injury by pet / ct a crush injury was introduced to the ta muscle of nude mice ( figure 3 ( a )) .
the injected hd2r _ hmpcs were successfully tracked in the crush injury region using the specific d2r radiotracer [ 18f ] fallypride ( early time point ) , resulting in a virus dose - dependent signal ( figure 3 ( b )) .
the injection of 50 % hd2r - positive cells in the damaged tissue led to an increased radiotracer uptake , compared to the injection of 25 % positive cells .
no signal could be detected in the crush only controls .
to exclude signal contamination from 18f - fluoride in the tibial bone , [ 11c ] raclopride was used as an alternative high - affinity d2r ligand for further experiments .
for these experiments , a viral combination of hd2r and hpgc - 1alpha , compared to gfp control infected cells , was used ( figures 3 ( c ) and 3 ( d )) .
uptake of [ 11c ] raclopride could be detected in hd2r _ hpgc - 1alpha _ hmpcs at early time points only ( figure 3 ( c )) .
further analysis indicated an unspecific radiotracer uptake at the site of injury also when gfp _ hmpcs were used ( figure 3 ( d )) .
importantly , the accumulation of the radiotracer in the intestines , urinary bladder , and joints ( 18f - fluoride ) is a known pk ( pharmacokinetic ) property of the radiotracer and should be considered physiologic and nonspecific accumulation for the current application .
3.4 .
pgc - 1alpha overexpressing hmpcs reduce the proinflammatory response after muscle crush injury initially aiming at imaging of neoangiogenesis with the specific alphavbetaiii radiotracer [ 64cu ] nodaga - rgd , we observed a highly increased accumulation of the tracer in ta crush only in the early periods after injury , when compared to native ta and to the crushed muscles with injected hmpcs ( figure 4 ( a ) , early ) .
at later time points , no pet signal was detectable ( figure 4 ( a ) , midterm and late ) .
furthermore , immunohistological analysis of harvested muscles with a macrophage expression marker ( f4 / 80 , cy3 ) demonstrated ( 1 ) a highly increased macrophage accumulation in crushed ta compared to native ( figures 4 ( b ) and 4 ( c ) , early ) and ( 2 ) a decreased signal in the hd2r _ hpgc _ hmpcs compared to gfp _ hmpcs ( figures 4 ( b ) and 4 ( c ) , early ) .
the latter effect was observed also at later time points ( figures 4 ( b ) and 4 ( c ) , midterm and late ) .
rtpcr analysis of the proinflammatory cytokine tnf - alpha in the crushed / regenerating tissue confirmed the highly increased signal in ta crush versus ta native ( figure 4 ( d ) , early , 44.73 +/ - 4.52 , n = 3 , 0.57 +/ - 0.19 , n = 6 , p < 0.0001 ) and the decreased expression in pgc - 1alpha overexpressing tissues compared to gfp ( figure 4 ( d ) , early , 0.443 +/ - 0.11 , n = 3 , 0.98 +/ - 0.07 , n = 3 , p = 0.0177 ) .
the pgc - 1alpha - related reduction of inflammation was sustained also at midterm ( figure 4 ( d ) , 0.23 +/ - 0.03 , n = 15 , 1.35 +/ - 0.30 , n = 3 , p < 0.0001 ) and late time points ( figure 4 ( d ) , 0.15 +/ - 0.02 , n = 9 , 0.84 +/ - 0.24 , n = 3 , p = 0.0005 ) .
4. discussion autologous stem cell therapy is on the doorstep to successful clinical application and represents a novel treatment option for various muscle - related pathologies , including urinary and anal incontinence , vocal cord dysfunction , and reflux .
muscle precursor cells , or activated satellite cells , are responsible for the regeneration in postnatal skeletal muscles .
in the past decades , these cells have been investigated for muscle tissue bioengineering approaches , allowing the growth of new myofibers [ 2 , 3 , 32 , 33 ] .
however , there are certain limitations in the quality of the de novo engineered constructs .
the process of proliferation and differentiation of these cells is largely driven by growth factors and altered by tissue injury or exercise [ 34 , 35 ] .
to address this matter , we designed a model for facilitated muscle regeneration after injury , by inducing overexpression of hpgc - 1alpha in the injected hmpcs in the injured skeletal muscles .
intensive research has shown that the natural process after muscle injury follows a highly conserved sequence of steps , leading to the restoration of tissue architecture , and importantly also function [ 36 ] .
a crucial step in the process of forming new muscle tissue is the capacity of mpcs to differentiate into myotubes .
consistent with the previously reported facilitated in vitro and in vivo ex situ differentiation of hpgc - 1alpha _ hmpcs [ 14 ] , the regenerating ta muscles with hpgc - 1alpha overexpression demonstrated earlier myotube formation in situ .
this would facilitate the functional regeneration in patients with a damaged urinary sphincter .
the injection of hpgc - 1alpha _ hmpc in the crush injury also significantly increased the expression of contractile proteins at all time points after the injury , indicating facilitated restoration compared to gfp - infected controls .
importantly , the expression of myhc1 was significantly increased in the hpgc - 1alpha _ hmpc samples , correlating with our goal to bioengineer predominantly slow - twitch muscle fibres , such as in the external urinary sphincter [ 12 ] .
in line with our in vivo observations , others have shown that an increased vegf release in a hypoxic environment leads to enhanced differentiation of muscle cells [ 37 ] .
it has been demonstrated that secretion of various effectors by injected hmpcs contribute to optimization of the regenerative process ( e.g. , neovascularization ) [ 32 , 38 , 39 ] .
the hpgc - 1alpha - related regeneration enhancement was further promoted by an increase in factors for mitochondrial ( coxiv ) and neuromuscular ( ache ) activity , which are known to be vital for successful muscle tissue bioengineering .
further supporting evidence suggested an increased expression of mitochondrial and other metabolic genes as a plausible mechanism for rescuing a damaged muscle [ 18 ] .
all these factors support the observed facilitated contraction force production by the regenerating muscles injected with hpcg - 1alpha _ hmpc .
at the later time points , there was no significant difference between the contraction forces of the two groups .
this was expected , as the regeneration of the muscles at later stages was completed , and there was no difference to native ta contraction .
although the functional results ( organ bath ) suggest a diminished difference between the two groups in long - term , the data support our main aim for designing a model for significantly facilitated muscle regeneration .
one has to consider certain limitations of the approach ; for example , the use of young mice brings along fast self - regeneration that might not be the best comparison model to the real situation in elderly patients .
nevertheless , we could show significant improvement of the regeneration speed even in a highly self - regenerative environment .
we expect to observe an even more prominent effect on facilitated muscle regeneration in patients .
moreover , gfp _ hmpc - injected muscles showed increased pgc - 1alpha gene expression levels at the latest stages , comparable to these in hpgc - 1a _ hmpc samples .
while resistance training combined with adequate nutrition remains the most effective intervention to diminish the functional decline in muscles , there is a certain age - linked barrier to obtaining full benefits from this therapy [ 40 ] .
pgc - 1alpha would be a promising " exercise molecule ," which controls skeletal muscle metabolism and has potential therapeutic effects .
therefore , we believe that by inducing hpgc - 1alpha overexpression in the injected hmpcs , we are able to mediate muscle - healing effects for structural , metabolic , and functional restoration , irrespective of physical status and age of the patient .
this makes the current preclinical approach a good candidate for regenerating the urinary sphincter in patients suffering from stress urinary incontinence in near future .
besides improving the quality of the engineered skeletal tissues , we aimed at establishing a method to noninvasively image the cell fate after implantation , circumventing the need for a tissue biopsy .
molecular imaging with pet is gaining increasing importance in regenerative medicine due to the possibility for noninvasive metabolic read - outs .
a recent study described the feasibility of imaging human na / i symporter ( nis ) expression in two mouse models of muscular dystrophy and vascular disease by bioluminescence and pet imaging [ 41 ] .
this study demonstrated that luciferase - and nis - engineered skeletal muscle could successfully be imaged .
in our present study , we presented a method for noninvasive visualization of the implanted cells in the ta crush injury using pet / ct imaging of hd2r .
tracking of hmpcs via ectopic expression of a signalling - deficient hd2r was previously reported in an ex situ muscle tissue formation model [ 28 ] .
we were able to visualize the cells in a viral dose - dependent manner in the injured ta muscles of the animals using the highly - specific hd2r radiotracer [ 18f ] fallypride .
nevertheless , the proximity of the muscle injury to the tibial bone led to unspecific signal uptake due to possible defluorination of the radiotracer .
to circumvent this problem , we used [ 11c ] raclopride as an alternative hd2r pet imaging agent .
interestingly , animals injected with gfp - only hmpcs showed higher [ 11c ] raclopride uptake , compared to the regenerating muscles with injected hd2r _ hpgc - 1alpha _ hmpcs .
this was also true for other tracers investigated in the study ( e.g. , [ 18f ] fdg , data not shown ) .
additionally , while aiming at visualizing neovascularization using [ 64cu ] nodaga - rgd , a relatively high amount of radioactivity was detected in the ta crushed only , where no cells were injected .
these observations led to the assumption that the recorded signals were rather related to inflammation , than to vascularization or specific hd2r detection .
immunohistological analysis with the macrophage marker f4 / 80 and the tnf - alpha gene expression levels in the harvested samples correlated with [ 64cu ] nodaga - rgd tracer uptake in the injury region .
in line with our observations , another study revealed that in addition to neovessels and myofibroblasts , macrophages have also been shown to express alphavbetaiii integrin [ 42 ] .
however , the relative amounts of integrin in these cell types have not been followed over time .
importantly , we were able to show that hpgc - 1alpha overexpression in the hmpcs could significantly reduce proinflammatory cytokine expression ( tnf - alpha ) and enhance the healing process .
a relation between hpgc - 1alpha and suppression of the broad inflammatory response has previously been reported [ 18 ] .
5. conclusions based on the findings above , hpgc - 1alpha overexpressing hmpcs hold a promise for the enhanced repair of skeletal muscle tissue .
they demonstrated capacities to amplify the expression of contractile markers , to facilitate the contraction force generation in the regenerating muscles , and to decrease the inflammatory response after crush injury .
additionally , we were able to track the implanted cells in the crushed muscles using pet radioligands .
nonetheless , several challenges remain which need to be overcome in order to establish a feasible method for metabolic imaging of this cellular therapy .

cadmium is a major heavy metal found in polluted aquatic environments , mainly derived from industrial production processes .
we evaluated the biosorption of solubilized cd2 + using the extracellular polymeric substances ( eps ) produced by bacillus sp .
mc3b - 22 and microbacterium sp .
mc3b - 10 ( microbactan ) ; these bacteria were originally isolated from intertidal biofilms off the coast of campeche , mexico .
eps were incubated with different concentrations of cadmium in ultrapure water .
residual cd2 + concentrations were determined by inductive coupled plasma - optic emission spectrometry and the maximum sorption capacity ( qmax ) was calculated according to the langmuir model .
eps were characterized by x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) before and after sorption .
the qmax of cd2 + was 97 mg g - 1 for microbactan and 141 mg g - 1 for mc3b - 22 eps , these adsorption levels being significantly higher than previously reported for other microbial eps .
in addition , xps analysis revealed changes in structure of eps after biosorption and showed that amino functional groups contributed to the binding of cd2 + , unlike other studies that show the carbohydrate fraction is responsible for this activity .
this work expands the current view of bacterial species capable of synthesizing eps with biosorbent potential for cadmium and provides evidence that different chemical moieties , other than carbohydrates , participate in this process .
aquatic environments bioremediation biosorption cadmium extracellular polymeric substances 1 .
introduction cadmium ( cd2 +) is a transition metal present in the aquatic environment through geochemical processes and , increasingly , through anthropogenic industrial activity ; it can accumulate in aquatic life along the food chain .
the metal is found as a constitutive ingredient in pigments , plastics stabilizers , solar panels , batteries and corrosion - resistant steel plating [ 1 ] , and thus is an important industrial material , but also a toxic waste product .
cadmium is one of the heavy metals with major toxic effects on human health and the environment [ 2,3,4 ] and has been reported in many countries to be the cause of serious health risks in contaminated areas e.g. , in china [ 5 ] .
several methods have been employed for the removal and recovery of heavy metals , dyes and radionuclides from polluted environments , including electrolysis , flotation , ion - exchange , membrane process precipitation , reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration [ 6,7,8 ] .
these " traditional " methods are not cost effective , efficient , or ecofriendly .
recently , considerable attention has been paid to the possibility of using bioremediation for the removal of heavy metals , including cadmium , from contaminated soil and water [ 9,10 ] .
biosorption is an applied biotechnology for the removal or recovery of organic and inorganic pollutants in solution using biological material , which includes agricultural and industrial waste biomass , living or dead microorganisms ( and their extracellular products ) , seaweed , plant and animal material [ 8,11 ] .
there are many publications suggesting the use of living bacterial cells for the removal and recovery of heavy metals from solution [ 12,13,14 ] , but this procedure has the obvious drawbacks of requiring metal - resistant , non - pathogenic organisms and of providing suitable growth conditions .
because of their chemical and physical properties , bacterial extracellular polymeric substances ( eps ) have been effectively and successfully used in the removal and recovery of several heavy metals [ 15,16,17 ] .
eps are mainly dominated by biomolecules such as carbohydrates , proteins , nucleic acids and lipids , with a lower proportion of other monomeric constituents [ 18,19 ] and their biosorption capacity is attributed to ionizable functional groups such as amino , carboxyl , hydroxyl , phosphate and sulfate , present mainly in polysaccharides and proteins [ 16,20 ] .
microbial eps have been studied from both terrestrial and aquatic environments .
specific biotopes such as intertidal flats represent understudied habitats for bioprospection of eps - producing bacteria [ 21 ] .
in an earlier investigation , bacterial strains microbacterium sp .
mc3b - 10 and bacillus sp .
mc3b - 22 were isolated from intertidal biofilms and were selected for their eps production .
the eps were characterized and polysaccharides and proteins identified as major components .
their surfactant activity was also evaluated [ 22 ] .
in the case of eps synthesized by microbacterium sp .
mc3b10 , calcium was seen bound , suggesting a potential biosorption potential .
this eps was characterized as a non - toxic glycolipoprotein , which was named microbactan [ 23 ] .
on the other hand , eps produced by bacillus sp .
mc3b - 22 an anionic assay proved positive , also suggesting this potential .
this work aimed at determining the potential of eps produced by intertidal bacillus sp .
mc3b - 22 and microbacterium sp .
mc3b - 10 to adsorb solubilized cd2 + as a prior step to towards developing a biological strategy for bioremediation of cadmium - polluted waters .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
bacterial strains bacillus sp .
mc3b - 22 and microbacterium sp .
mc3b - 22 were originally isolated from pristine rocky intertidal shores in the state of campeche , southern gulf of mexico , mexico .
they are stored in the culture collection of the department of environmental microbiology and biotechnology , demab , universidad autonoma de campeche .
bacillus sp .
mc3b - 22 was identified to species level by dna sequencing , as described in section bacillus sp .
mc3b - 22 identification .
bacillus sp .
mc3b - 22 identification bacillus sp .
mc3b - 22 was identified by partial sequencing of 16s rrna gene fragments amplified using the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) .
total dna was obtained with a commercial kit ( ultraclean ( r ) microbial dna isolation kit mo bio , ( qiagen inc , illinois , il , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions modified according to [ 24,25 ] .
in brief , the pure strain was placed in eppendorf tubes with 500 mul of te buffer ph 8.0 , 30 mul of 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) and 5 ml of proteinase k ( 20 mg ml - 1 ) .
they were vortexed and incubated for one hour at 37 degreesc .
after this time , 100 mul of 5 m nacl and 80 mul of a solution of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide in sodium chloride ( ctab / nacl ) added , mixed by inversion and incubated for 10 min at 65 degreesc .
subsequently phenol : chloroform : isoamyl alcohol ( 25:24:1 ) was added , vortexed and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 24 degreesc ; the supernatant was recovered and transferred to 1.5 ml sterile tubes .
a second extraction with an equal volume of chloroform : isoamyl alcohol ( 24:1 ) was made by inversion mixing .
the tubes were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 degreesc .
the aqueous phase was recovered and dna precipitation was carried out by adding 0.6 volumes of precooled isopropanol at - 20 degreesc .
the tubes were incubated at - 20degreesc overnight .
after incubation , the tubes were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 degreesc .
the resulting dna was washed with 70 % ethanol precooled at - 20 degreesc and centrifuged again ; this process was repeated .
dna was allowed to air dry and resuspended in 100 mul of te ph 8.0 plus 1 mul of rnase ( 1 mug mul - 1 ) .
the tubes were incubated in a water bath at 37 degreesc for 1 h. a second extraction with phenol : chloroform : isoamyl alcohol ( 25:24:1 ) was performed to remove rnase following the above - mentioned procedure .
oligonucleotide primers ( forward primer 27f 5 ' - gagtttgatcctggctca - 3 ' and reverse primer 1385r 5 ' - cggtgtgtrcaaggccc - 3 ') were used to amplify the 16s rrna gene .
the amplification reaction contained 100 ng of dna , 0.25 mum of each oligonucleotide , 5 mul of 10x pcr buffer , 2 mul of mgso4 , 10 mm dntps , 1.5 u of taq polymerase and sterile distilled water to a final volume of 50 mul .
the reactions were amplified in a bio - rad mjmini ( r ) thermocycler ( version 1.1 ci , bio - rad laboratories , inc. , hercules , ca , usa ) .
a single pcr cycle consisted of initial denaturation at 95 degreesc for 2 min and 30 cycles of 95 degreesc for 60 s , annealing at 55 degreesc for 60 s , 72 degreesc for 70 s , and extension at 72 degreesc for 10 min .
the pcr amplicons were purified and dna was sequenced by macrogen , korea .
the sequence was analyzed and edited using the codoncode aligner program .
the genbank database was searched using the blast program ( version 2.2.25 , nih national institute of health , bethesda , md , usa ) at the national center for biotechnology information website ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) and sequencing data was analyzed comparing the sequence of nearest relatives found by blast searching .
2.2 .
eps production both eps were produced by overnight batch shake flask fermentation as previously reported ortega - morales et al .
[ 21 ] .
eps were extracted from the fermented broths as described by camacho - chab et al .
[ 22 ] .
the eps were lyophilized and kept in the dark before experiments .
both eps have been analyzed and polysaccharides predominate in their composition , with glucose as main neutral sugar ; uronic acids ( galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid ) and hexosamines ( n - acetyl glucosamine ) are also present and protein content is 38 % for microbactan and 9 % for mc3b - 22 eps [ 21 ] .
2.3 .
cadmium biosorption experiments 50 mg dry eps were placed in a flask with 50 ml cd2 + solution at initial concentrations in the range of 10 - 100 ( 10 - unit increments ) mg l - 1 .
a stock solution of cadmium ( 100 mg l - 1 ) was prepared by dissolving cd ( cooch3 ) 2 ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) in ultrapure water .
flasks were prepared in triplicate and gently shaken ( 50 rpm ) for 24 h at 28 degreesc and ph 7 [ 26,27 ] .
after 24 h , solutions were ultrafiltered using pellicon ( r ) tangential flow filtration cassettes ( merk millipore , darmstadt , german ) [ 26 ] .
permeates ( residual cadmium concentrations ) were acidified with hno3 ( 0.5 n ) and cadmium concentration was determined by inductive coupled plasma - optic emission spectrometry ( icp - oes , perkin elmer optima 8300 dv , wellesley , ma , usa ) at a wavelength of 226.502 nm. retentates were lyophilized prior to further analysis by xps .
suitable controls were included during biosorption experiments to rule out cadmium adsorption to glass flasks ; these were triplicate flasks containing eps ( at varying levels ) plus cadmium and flask containing only cadmium .
the amount of cadmium adsorbed , q per unit mass of eps ( mg g - 1 ) was determined using the following equation [ 28 ] : ( 1 ) q =( ci - ceq ) xvm where ci is the initial metal concentration and ceq the equilibrium metal concentration in solution ( mg l - 1 ) of volume v ( ml ) and m is the mass of eps ( mg ) .
2.3.1 .
equilibrium biosorption isotherm the langmuir adsorption isotherm model was employed to describe the cd2 + uptake by microbactan and mc3b - 22 eps [ 29 ] .
this adsorption isotherm is given by the following equation : ( 2 ) q = qmaxxk x [ me ] eq1 + k x [ me ] eq where qmax ( mg g - 1 ) represents the maximum sorption capacity , k is the langmuir equilibrium constant ( l mg - 1 ) , and [ me ] eq ( mg l - 1 ) is the equilibrium concentration of the metal in the solution .
2.3.2 .
x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) the composition and oxidation state of surface elements of both eps were determined by xps before and after sorption .
analyses were carried with an x - ray photoelectron spectrometer k - alpha ( thermo scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) with a hemispheric analyser at 5 x 10 - 9 mbar ; the sample was excited with monochromatic radiation of al kalpha ( 1486.68 ev ) at 12 kv and 40 w. the general xps spectra was taken with a pass energy of 100 ev and step size of 1 ev and the individual xps spectra were taken with a pass energy of 50 ev and step size of 0.1 ev .
2.4 .
toxicity test artemia sp .
( brine shrimp ) is an important food for aquaculture , since it can be produced in gnotobiotic conditions and can serve as a vector , transferring probiotics to larvae , thus being a suitable model in the study of how probiotics and pathogenic microorganisms affect [ 30,31 ] one of the most important live feeds for commercial production of fish and shellfish [ 30 ] .
artemia nauplii have also been used to evaluate the toxicity of contaminants in aquatic environments [ 31 ] .
the toxicity of the eps was evaluated by the brine shrimp assay .
brine shrimp eggs ( equinetos productos ( r ) , tam , ciudad de mexico , mexico ) were hatched in artificial seawater , prepared with 38 g / l of sea salt ( coralife ( r ) , franklin , wi , usa ) added with 6 mg / l of dry yeast , under light and continuous aeration at 27 degreesc .
mc3b - 22 eps and microbactan , together with standard commercial polymers alginate and xanthan gum ( for comparison ) , were all dissolved separately with seawater at different concentrations ( 1000 , 500 , 100 , 50 and 10 microg / ml ) .
copper sulfate pentahydrate was used as a positive control .
after incubation of the test for 24 h , dead and live nauplii were counted with the aid of a stereoscope and data were analyzed by the probit program to determine the lethal concentration of 50 % ( lc50 ) of each compound [ 22 ] .
3. results and discussion 3.1 .
molecular identification of bacillus sp .
mc3b - 22 the phylogenetic analysis based on the 16s rdna sequences indicated strain mc3b - 22 to be of the genus bacillus ( figure 1 ) .
the strain was closely related to bacillus firmus , with a similarity value of 99 % ( genebank accesion number hq116811.1 ) .
the eps produced by b. firmus has previously been reported to remove copper , lead , and zinc from aqueous solutions [ 32 ] , but this is the first time , to our knowledge , that it has been shown to be effective for cd sorption .
the evolutionary history of the current isolate was inferred using the neighbor - joining method [ 33 ] .
figure 1 shows the sum of the length of the branch that was 5.236499 , as well as the percentage of trees replicated with associated taxa grouped in the test ( 1000 replicates ) [ 34 ] .
evolutionary distances were used to infer the phylogenetic tree and were calculated using the maximum composite likelihood method [ 35 ] .
evolutionary analyses were performed on mega7 [ 36 ] , using mycobacterium bacteremicum as the outside group .
3.2 .
cadmium biosorption isotherms of microbactan and b. firmus eps the sorption isotherms of cadmium for both eps are shown in figure 2 .
the simulation of the langmuir isotherm model showed that both eps have the ability to sorb to cadmium and that this metal accumulation is a saturated physicochemical process .
table 1 gives the biosorption characteristics of the two types of eps .
the maximum amount of cadmium biosorption on b. firmus eps ( qmax = 141.1 mg g - 1 ) was greater than on microbactan ( qmax = 97.1 mg g - 1 ) .
both these figures are considerably greater than most of those reported in the literature for live or dead microbial biomass [ 12,37 ] .
ahmed et al .
[ 37 ] compared the qmax values for various bacteria , fungi and algae .
all were lower than our eps values , apart from those for the immobilized bacillus subtilis used by ahmed et al .
[ 37 ] , which was calculated from a model to be 251.91 mg g - 1 , and that for the dead biomass of the endophytic fungus microsphaeropsis ( 247.5 mg g - 1 ) [ 38 ] .
3.3 .
xps analysis before and after biosorption these analyses allowed us to determine the interactions occurring in eps on cd sorption .
3.3.1. b. firmus eps the xps c1s spectra for the b. firmus eps before and after biosorption of cadmium are shown in figure 3 .
before biosorption ( figure 3a ) , the c1s spectra displays four environments for c atoms , which could correspond to c - h , c - c or c = c , c - o and c = o. the 286.05 ev peak , pertaining to c - o or c - n , was attributed to alcohol , amine or amide .
the peak at 287.50 ev , pertaining to c = o or o - c - o , could be attributed to carboxylate or carbonyl , which confirms the presence of polysaccharides in b. firmus eps .
on the other hand , the c1s spectra after biosorption of cadmium ( figure 3b ) displayed only three environments for c atoms , which correspond to c - c or c = c , c - o and c = o. a change in the binding energy of these components is observed ( table 2 ) .
the contribution of c - o and c = o decreases after biosorption , while the c - c or c = c contribution remains almost the same .
thus , the change in the c atoms could indicate that the biosorption process is modifying the b. firmus eps , or that the carbonyl groups are taking part in the metal ion coordination [ 28,39,40 ] .
xps analysis has previously shown that the eps are subject to a change in their chemical structure or conformation during the biosorption process [ 16 ] .
figure 4 shows the n1s spectra .
the presence of a peak characteristic for nitrogen is seen at 399.78 ev before biosorption ( figure 4a ) and this was attributed to nh2 or nh of the proteins .
after biosorption , a new peak appeared in the n1s spectrum ( figure 4b ) at the higher binding energy of 400.11 ev ( table 2 ) and this could be assigned to the formation of an - n : - m2 + complex , a lone pair of electrons in the n atom being donated to cadmium [ 41 ] .
this complexation between metal ions and the nh2 or nh has been reported previously in chitosan [ 41,42,43 ] , but not for microbial eps .
the n1s spectra thus confirm the biosorption of cadmium by b. firmus eps .
3.3.2 .
microbactan the c1s xps spectra for microbactan before and after biosorption of cadmium are shown in figure 5 .
both c1s xps spectra ( figure 5a,b ) show three c atom environments which were assigned to c - c or c = c , c - o and c = o. however , for three c atoms a change of peak intensity ratios is seen .
a possible explanation for this is that cd2 + in nh2 - metal complexes may have a weak interaction with adjacent hydroxyl groups ( 286.22 ev ) ( table 3 ) because of its relatively larger radius [ 39 ] .
alternatively , the decrease in intensity of peak ratio 287.55 ev ( table 3 ) after the biosorption process could be caused by an ion exchange [ 42 ] .
the n1s xps spectrum before biosorption ( figure 6a ) shows the characteristic peak for nitrogen at 399.93 ev , attributed to nh2 or nh ( protein fraction ) .
after biosorption , a new peak appears , indicating that metal complexation has occurred with nh2 or nh. the n1s spectra after cadmium biosorption ( figure 6b ) , displays a shift in the binding energy ; since a higher band corresponds to a more oxidized state , the peak at 399.95 was assigned to the - nh2 metal complex ( table 3 ) .
the results show that nitrogen - containing groups in both types of eps play an important role in cadmium biosorption .
3.4 .
toxicity of microbactan and b. firmus eps the toxicity bioassay showed that neither biopolymer was toxic to a. salina nauplii at concentrations of 1000 microg ml - 1 ( table 4 ) .
there are no suggestions in the literature that bacterial eps can be toxic , although this property is rarely measured specifically .
these results confirm what is generally assumed by microbiologists and the many uses of eps in water treatment [ 20 ] suggest that this is , indeed , the case .
alginate and xanthan gum were used for comparison , as commercial biopolymers that have been reported to have biosorption abilities .
the results show that the new eps extracts are equally suitable for use in the environment .
4. conclusions this study determined the biosorption capacity of cadmium by the biopolymers microbactan and mc3b - 22 , both synthetized by marine bacteria microbacterium sp .
mc3b - 10 and bacillus sp .
mc3b - 22 ( identified by dna sequencing with 99 % similarity to b. firmus ) .
the maximum sorption capacity of cd2 + was 97 mg g - 1 for microbactan and 141 mg g - 1 for b. firmus eps , both at ph 7 and 28 degreesc .
xps analysis revealed changes in structure or conformation of both eps after biosorption and indicated that nh2 or nh functional groups contributed to binding cadmium .
in addition , microbactan and b. firmus eps were non - toxic to a. salina nauplii , which is an aquatic model organism widely used in aquaculture activities .
our results showed that b. firmus eps and microbactan are very promising for remediation of cadmium in aqueous solutions , with b. firmus perhaps being preferred because of its higher maximum sorption capacity .
eps does not depend for its metal - absorbing activity on microbial metabolic processes and is thus preferable to living biomass .
further studies of these eps in remediation of heavy metals in water for aqueous systems , including optimization of their production , will be performed in the future .

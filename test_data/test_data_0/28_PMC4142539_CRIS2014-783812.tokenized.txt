the reconstruction of lower third of the leg is one of the most challenging problems for plastic and reconstructive surgeons and current approaches are still disappointing .
we show an easy option to obtain a coverage of traumatic pretibial defects with good aesthetic and functional results : the association of negative pressure wound therapy , acellular dermal matrix , and skin graft .
the choice of this combined therapy avoids other surgical procedures such as local perforator flaps and free flaps that require more operating time , special equipment , and adequate training .
1. introduction the reconstruction of traumatic soft tissue defects in the distal third of the leg is one of the most challenging problems in lower limb surgery .
among the most widely used techniques direct closure , skin grafting , local flaps , and free flap are worthy of note .
usually , the low mobility of the surrounding skin does not make a direct closure possible .
however , wound edge approximation shows a high percentage of failure or requires long time to achieve complete healing [ 1 ] .
skin graft compared to wound edge juxtaposition shows an advantage in success rate and in healing time [ 1 ] .
however , for major defects skin graft does not provide optimal coverage of the underlying structures ( vessels , nerves , and tendons ) .
even the coverage with flaps shows some disadvantages .
a random flap has an indistinct perfusion pattern which requires a careful assessment of length - to - width ratio to ensure viability .
these features make random flaps difficult to perform in the lower leg and anyway associated with a high rate of necrosis [ 2 ] .
musculocutaneous flaps are widespread in leg reconstruction for their reliability .
however , these flaps have few indications in the distal third of leg due to the impossibility to reach the site of injury [ 3 ] .
local fasciocutaneous flaps can be harvested without a careful assessment of length - to - width ratio but still show a considerable necrosis rate in the lower third of the leg [ 4 ] .
local perforator flaps and free flaps are good options in reconstruction of traumatic defects of lower third of the leg .
local perforator flaps have a similar perfusion to musculocutaneous flaps but save the underlying fascia and muscles , resulting in less postoperative morbidity of donor site .
in this type of flaps , the main risk is related to vascular complications associated to pedicle torsion and deformation .
to reduce this risk , it is necessary to identify perforator with at least 1 mm in diameter [ 5 ] .
before or during surgery , the handheld doppler probe and the color doppler are reliable techniques to determine the size of the perforator [ 6 , 7 ] .
as free flaps , local perforator flaps require a microsurgical procedure but the microanastomoses are not needed .
therefore , these flaps have a shorter operating time compared to free flaps .
free flaps require more operating time , special equipment , and adequate training .
in addition , melissinos and parks [ 8 ] reported that success rate of free flap was only 95.6 % in reconstruction of defects of lower extremities ( versus 96.8 % , 100 % , and 98.8 % of head and neck , trunk , and upper extremities reconstruction , resp. ) .
keeping in mind all the previous limitations of each technique , we described a simple technique for lower third of the leg reconstruction .
we used the association of negative pressure wound therapy ( npwt ) , acellular dermal matrix ( adm ) , and skin graft in a patient with traumatic defect of the lower third of the leg .
2. presentation of case an 18 - year - old woman was involved in a high speed road traffic collision .
according to the emergency services , the patient was ejected from the vehicle and landed on the road .
after checking the stability of the vital parameters , the patient underwent orthopedic treatment for bilateral femur fracture .
therefore , she came to our attention with an extensive soft tissue necrosis on the lower third of the right leg ( 8 cm long , 15 cm wide ) .
a thorough surgical debridement was performed .
following debridement , the wound site showed exposure of the tendons of the extensor hallucis longus and digitorum longus muscles .
therefore , the wound was covered using npwt for four weeks , setting the system at an 80 mmhg alternating cycle .
every 5 days , wound dressings were replaced and the negative pressure was applied again .
sequential wound assessment demonstrated the growth of granulation tissue .
at the end of the 4th week of npwt , the wound was covered using adm in order to obtain an optimal coverage of tendons .
after surgical debridement of granulation tissue in excess , the adm was modeled according to the shape of defect and was fixed to the surrounding tissues .
following the adm placement , npwt was reapplied over the adm .
the npwt system was set at a lower pressure ( 50 mmhg alternating cycle ) for 14 days , changing the wound dressings every 5 days .
in this way , we anticipated to 14 days ( rather than 21 ) the removal of the silicone layer that covers the porous matrix of adm .
at the 14th day after the placement of adm the dermal tissue was completely regenerated and showed the typical golden - yellow color .
a split - thickness skin graft harvested from the anterior face of left thigh was used to cover the adm .
we reapplied the npwt on the graft at a 50 mmhg negative pressure , in order to keep it clean and accelerate the engraftment .
after a week of npwt , complete integration of the graft was achieved .
the coverage of the underlying tendons was optimal ( figure 1 ) and functional outcome was satisfying with a good tendons sliding in the flexion - extension movements of the toes .
3. discussion the reconstructive options for lower third of the leg are still few and disappointing .
we combined npwt , adm , and skin graft , leading to a good aesthetic result with an optimal tendons coverage and normal sliding in flexion and extension movements of the toes .
a similar treatment was documented by a retrospective review of the walter reed army medical center on 16 patients with blast wounds and exposure of tendons and bones [ 9 ] .
in 15 of 16 patients a definitive coverage was obtained , with the need to repeat the adm placement only in two cases .
we used the npwt three times : after the initial debridement to keep the wound clean , after placement of adm to prevent the adherences formation with the underlying tendons , and after grafting to speed the engraftment .
npwt improves the success rate of split - thickness skin grafts and reduces the rate of repeated grafting [ 10 ] .
this effect is linked to several factors [ 11 - 14 ] : the uniform contact between the graft and the wound bed , the removal of wound fluid with prevention of hematoma or seroma formation under the graft , the reduced risk of infection , and the moist environment due to the occlusive nature of wound dressing that prevents the drying of the graft .
npwt may exercise the same positive effects after placement of adm , with documented cellular microdeformations that would lead to an increased fibroblasts proliferation and dermal regeneration [ 15 , 16 ] .
as underlined by graham et al .
[ 17 ] in a recent retrospective study on ten patients with traumatic degloving injuries , the placement of adm and following split - thickness skin graft are a good therapeutic option when tendons and bones are exposed .
as is well known , the exposure of tendons and bones compromises the vascularity of the wound bed required for engraftment .
in soft tissue injuries with exposure of tendons and absence of paratenon , the main risk is tendons adherences formation that would result in decreased range of motion .
however , a recent prospective study [ 18 ] showed a normal range of motion after reconstruction with adm in 32 patients with soft tissue defects of the upper or lower extremity .
so adm provides an adequate safety profile for functional restoration in patients with soft tissue defects and exposure of tendons .
4. conclusion the association of npwt , adm , and skin graft provides an easy option to obtain a lasting coverage of traumatic defects on lower third of the leg , with good aesthetic and functional results .
the therapeutic process is not time consuming ; a portable device to perform the npwt at home is available .
the portable device is for single use with a lifespan of up to 7 days .
therefore , in outpatient settings we can remove the dressing every 5 days and replace the portable npwt device .
the choice of npwt - adm - skin graft combined therapy avoids other surgical procedures such as musculocutaneous flaps , local perforator flaps , and free flaps in patients who reject the associated scars and donor site morbidities .

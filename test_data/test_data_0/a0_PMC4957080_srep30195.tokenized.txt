we previously found that rs353292 in the flanking region of mir - 143 / 145 showed a high frequency in patients with colorectal cancer ( crc ) .
to identify whether the rs353292 polymorphism is a risk factor for crc , we conducted this study with larger samples .
a total of 809 patients with crc and 1005 gender matched controls were collected .
the rs353292 polymorphism was genotyped by using taqman allelic discrimination .
dual luciferase reporter assay was carried out to measure the transcriptional activity .
we found that the rs353292 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk for developing crc in heterozygous comparison ( adjusted or = 1.70 , 95 % ci , 1.32 - 2.20 , p < 0.001 ) , dominant genetic model ( adjusted or = 1.62 , 95 % ci , 1.26 - 2.09 , p < 0.001 ) , and allele comparison ( adjusted or = 1.46 , 95 % ci , 1.16 - 1.84 , p = 0.001 ) .
the rs353292 ct / tt carriers exhibited a lower expression of mir - 143 compared to the cc carriers ( p = 0.04 ) .
moreover , the pgl3 - rs353292t displayed a significantly lower luciferase activity than pgl3 - rs353292c ( p < 0.01 ) .
these findings indicate that the rs353292 polymorphism is functional and may be a risk factor for the development of crc .
colorectal cancer ( crc ) is the third most common cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death around the world , with an estimated 1.2 million new cases and 600000 deaths per year12 .
the highest incidence of crc is in developed countries of europe , north america , and oceania1 .
recent reports revealed that the incidence is rapidly increasing in many asian countries including china3 .
even with the improvements in diagnosis , surgery , chemotherapy , and targeted therapy , the 5 - year survival rate for crc patients is estimated to be 62 - 64 % 4 .
previous identified risk factors for crc included obesity , smoking , dietary patterns , physical inactivity , and genetic factors567 .
micrornas ( mirnas ) are a class of conservative endogenous non - coding rna molecules , with 18 - 25 nucleotides in length , and have been found in variety of eukaryotic organisms8 .
generally , mirnas play a crucial role in cellular development , differentiation , proliferation , and apoptosis by binding to 3 ' untranslated region ( utr ) of target mrna molecules , resulting in the degradation of mrna and inhibition of protein translation .
a series of studies have demonstrated that mirnas act as potential " tumor suppressors " or oncogenes29 .
mir - 143 and mir - 145 , closely located on 5q33 , are co - transcribed from a single promoter , resulting in a primary transcript containing both mirnas3 .
in 2003 , michael et al. initially reported that the expression of both mirnas were downregulated in colorectal neoplasia10 .
the two mirnas are always involved in various cancer - related events including proliferation , invasion and migration , suggesting a potential possess of anti - tumorigenic activity. with regard to the regulation of mir - 143 / 145 , previous reports have shown that kras , ras responsive element binding protein 1 , serum response factor , and myocardin can regulate the expression of mir - 143 / 145 by altering the transcription of target genes111213 .
single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) , the most common type of genetic variation in human genome , was estimated to disrupt the process of mirnas , and thus influence their expression .
recently , we discovered several snps in the flanking region of mir - 143 and mir - 145 cluster .
among them , rs353292 , located in 673 bp upstream from the start site , was related to an increased risk of crc14 .
since the sample sizes are limited in our previous study14 , in this study , we replicated the relationship between the rs353292 polymorphism and crc risk by enlarging sample size .
moreover , dual luciferase reporter assay was used to examine whether the rs353292 polymorphism can affect the transcriptional activity .
results association of the mir - 143 / 145 rs353292 with risk of crc demographic and clinical characteristics for all the subjects are listed in table 1 .
the mean age (+/ - sd ) of the cases was 61.0 +/ - ( 12.7 ) years , which was higher than the controls ( p < 0.001 ) .
there was no significant difference in gender distribution between cases and controls ( p = 0.10 ) .
the genotype distributions in the control group followed the hwe ( p = 0.09 ) .
as shown in table 2 , a significant difference in genotype and allele distributions of the rs353292 was found between cases and controls .
a significantly increased crc risk was found to be associated with ct genotype compared to cc genotype ( adjusted or = 1.70 , 95 % ci , 1.32 - 2.20 , p < 0.001 ) .
the ct / tt genotype carriers had a 1.62 - fold increased risk of crc compared to cc genotype carriers ( adjusted or = 1.62 , 95 % ci , 1.26 - 2.09 , p < 0.001 ) .
additionally , the rs353292t allele was associated with a significantly increased risk of crc compared to c allele ( adjusted or = 1.46 , 95 % ci , 1.16 - 1.84 , p = 0.001 ) .
stratification analyses were done according to different variables , including differentiated status , clinical stage , and lymph node metastasis .
nevertheless , no significant association was detected between the rs353292 polymorphism and clinical features ( table 3 ) .
association of the rs353292 with the expression of mir - 143 / 145 we detected the expression of mir - 143 and mir - 145 in both crc tumors and noncancerous tissues .
as shown in fig. 1a,b , levels of both mir - 143 and mir - 145 in crc tissues were dramatically lower than those in noncancerous tissues ( p < 0.001 ) .
furthermore , we analyzed the association between the rs353292 polymorphism and the expression of mir - 143 and mir - 145 in crc tissues .
we found that the expression of mir - 143 in rs353292 ct / tt carriers was significantly lower than that in cc carriers ( p = 0.04 ) ( fig. 1c ) .
however , no significant correlation between the rs353292 polymorphism and the expression of mir - 145 was found ( fig. 1d ) .
dual luciferase reporter assay of the mir - 143 / 145 rs353292 polymorphism after transient transfection of mir - 143 / 145 flanking region into hct116 , hela , and a549 cells , the transcriptional activity was a significantly higher compared to empty plasmid ( p < 0.01 ) ( fig. 2a ) .
to further investigate the effect of the rs353292 polymorphism on the transcriptional activity , we constructed two plasmids : pgl3 - rs353292t and pgl3 - rs353292c .
as shown in fig. 2b , the pgl3 - rs353292t showed a significantly lower luciferase activity than pgl3 - rs353292c ( p < 0.01 ) .
in hct116 cells , the rs353292t displayed a 0.45 - fold decreased activity compared to the rs353292c ( p = 0.009 ) .
similarly reduced luciferase activity was also observed in hela and a549 cells , with a fold change of 0.57 and 0.17 ( p = 0.004 and p < 0.001 , respectively ) .
discussion we performed a case - control study evaluating the relationship between the rs353292 polymorphism in the flanking region of mir - 143 / 145 and crc risk .
we found that the rs353292 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk for developing crc in heterozygous comparison , dominant genetic model , and allele comparison .
the rs353292 ct / tt carriers exhibited a lower expression of mir - 143 compared to the cc carriers ( p = 0.04 ) .
in vitro analysis showed that rs353292t exhibited a lower transcriptional activity compared to rs353292c .
these findings suggest that the rs353292 is functional and may be used as a biomarker for the risk of crc .
mir - 143 and mir - 145 are located on chromosome 5q33.1 in human genome and are speculated to be cotranscribed as the same bicistronic unit15 .
these two mirnas have been studied extensively and have been identified as " tumor suppressors " in varieties of cancer types , including crc816171819202122232425262728 .
downregulation of these mirnas has been reported in both crc tissues and crc cell lines16171820212223242528 .
such abnormal expression can regulate cell proliferation , cell growth , clone formation , apoptosis , cell cycle , invasion , and migration by targeting lots of genes such as metastasis - associated in colon cancer - 1 , insulin - like growth factor 1 receptor , dna methyltranferase 3a , paxillin , toll - like receptor 2 , fascin - 1 , and kras1617182021232425 .
furthermore , mir - 143 can reduce viability and increase the sensitivity of crc cells to 5 - fluorouracil via extracellular - regulated protein kinase 5 / nuclear factor - kappab signaling pathway26 .
these findings indicate that mir - 143 and mir - 145 may be used as not only anti - oncogenic genes but also therapeutic targets for crc .
recently , several snps in the flanking region of mirnas have been reported to alter individual 's susceptibility to cancer .
among them , an snp rs4938723 in the promoter of pri - mir - 34b / c was the mostly studied , which was reported to be related to the risk of a series of cancer types , such as colorectal cancer2930 , hepatocellular carcinoma31 , gastric cancer32 , renal cell cancer33 , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma34 , nasopharyngeal carcinoma35 , papillary thyroid carcinoma36 , and cervical cancer37 .
other snps included rs10877887 in the promoter of let - 7 , rs2296616 in the promoter of mir - 107 , rs999885 in the promoter of mir - 106b - 25 cluster , and rs4705342 and rs4705343 in the flanking region of mir - 143 / 145 , which were reported to be associated with the risk of papillary thyroid carcinoma38 , lung cancer39 , gastric adenocarcinoma40 , hepatocellular carcinoma41 , prostate cancer42 , and cervical squamous cell carcinoma43 .
in our previous study , we reported a new snp rs353292 in the flanking region of mir - 143 / 145 and the rs353292t allele was a risk factor for the development of crc14 .
in this replication study , the same positive effect was also observed .
in agreement with the association study , functional analysis revealed that the rs353292t allele had a reduced transcriptional activity in vitro .
these findings indicate that the rs353292t allele may result in lower transcriptional activity and reduced level of mir - 143 , and eventually increase the risk of crc .
since dna for the case group was extracted from paraffin - embedded specimens and dna for the control group was isolated from peripheral blood samples , we cannot exclude the possibility of heterozygote between cases and controls. and thus confirmation studies should be performed using peripheral blood samples from both case and controls .
moreover , the mean age in the controls was lower than that in cases , which may result in unreliable results due to selection bias .
after adjustment by age and gender , however , the positive results were still observed , suggesting the results may be reliable .
well - designed studies are of great importance to verify these findings , especially in other ethnic groups .
in conclusion , we provided the first evidence that the rs353292 in the flanking region of mir - 143 / 145 may modulate transcriptional activity , and finally affect individual 's susceptibility to crc .
this work may help us achieve a deeper insight into snps in the flanking region of mirnas relevant to the carcinogenesis of crc .
in the future , in vivo experiments using transgenic mice will be valuable to analyze the rs353492 polymorphism in the risk of crc .

figure 1 relative expression of mir - 143 / 145 in 71 crc tumor tissues and normal tissues determined by qrt - pcr .
both mir - 143 ( a ) and mir - 145 ( b ) were found dramatically lower in crc tissues ( p < 0.001 ) .
mir - 143 was found significantly down - regulated in rs353292 ct / tt carriers ( c ) .
no significant relationship of mir - 145 and the rs353292 polymorphism was found ( d ) .
figure 2 the relative luciferase activity in different cell lines .
( a ) after transfected with the plasmid containing the flanking region of mir - 143 / 145 , significantly higher luciferase activity was observed .
( b ) the pgl3 - rs353292t led to a decrease in luciferase expression compared to the pgl3 - rs353292c .
each experiment was done in triplicate and data are presented as mean +/ - sd .

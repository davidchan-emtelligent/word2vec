while the protein composition of various yeast 60s ribosomal subunit assembly intermediates has been studied in detail , little is known about ribosomal rna ( rrna ) structural rearrangements that take place during early 60s assembly steps .
using a high - throughput rna structure probing method , we provide nucleotide resolution insights into rrna structural rearrangements during nucleolar 60s assembly .
our results suggest that many rrna - folding steps , such as folding of 5.8s rrna , occur at a very specific stage of assembly , and propose that downstream nuclear assembly events can only continue once 5.8s folding has been completed .
our maps of nucleotide flexibility enable making predictions about the establishment of protein - rrna interactions , providing intriguing insights into the temporal order of protein - rrna as well as long - range inter - domain rrna interactions .
these data argue that many distant domains in the rrna can assemble simultaneously during early 60s assembly and underscore the enormous complexity of 60s synthesis .
ribosome biogenesis is a dynamic process that involves the ordered assembly of ribosomal proteins and numerous rna structural rearrangements .
here the authors apply chemmodseq , a high - throughput rna structure probing method , to quantitatively measure changes in rna flexibility during the nucleolar stages of 60s assembly in yeast .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction ribosome assembly in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is a complex and energy - consuming process .
it starts with the transcription of recombinant dna by rna polymerase i and the co - transcriptional packaging of nascent pre - ribosomal rna ( rrna ) into a 90s complex1 , 2 .
cleavage of the nascent transcript at site a2 ( fig. 1a ) separates the large particle into precursors of the 40s and 60s subunits. fig. 1 affinity purification of 27sa2 and 27sb pre - rrna .
a schematic representation of the assembly steps of the nucleolar pre - 60s particles .
the 35s pre - rrna is processed to 27sb pre - rrna in various stages , which involves binding of assembly factors required for 27sa3 processing ( a3 factors ) , assembly factors required for cleavage in its2 ( b factors ) and r - proteins .

the plot shows the distribution of a3 and b factors based on the escs from the rrp5 ( c ) or nsa2 ( d ) pre - 60s complexes .
the p - value was calculated using a t - test .
e ball plots showing the mass spectrometry results ( esc ) for the r - protein composition of the complexes purified by rrp5 - tap and nsa2 - tap .
the results were compared to the r - protein composition of the fun12 - tap purified 80s particles .
the larger the ball , the more enriched the protein was in the purification assembly of the 60s subunit involves processing of two rrnas ( 5.8s and 25s rrnas ) , and the incorporation of the third rrna ( 5s rrna ) as a separate ribonucleoprotein complex3 .
following cleavage of the nascent transcript at a2 , the 27sa2 is converted into 27sb pre - rrnas , either via cleavage at a3 followed by exonucleolytic trimming to b1s or by cleavage at b1l .
the 27sb pre - rrnas are cleaved at site c2 in the second internal transcribed spacer ( its2 ) region , generating 7s pre - rrna and a 5 ' extended 25s precursor ( 25.5s ) ( fig. 1a ) .
these are subsequently processed in the nucleus , and undergo final maturation steps after their export to the cytoplasm to form mature 5.8s and 25s rrnas , respectively4 - 6 .
pre - rrna processing and folding requires the incorporation of many ribosomal proteins ( r - proteins ) and the activity of hundreds of assembly factors .
many of the r - proteins initially bind with low affinity , and their association becomes increasingly more stable as the assembly process proceeds7 .
this gradual assembly of r - proteins is regulated by ribosome assembly factors that chaperone their timely incorporation7 , and make the assembly process more efficient by preventing misfolding or kinetic traps that could lead to the formation of defective ribosomes8 .
although the dynamics of the binding and dissociation of assembly factors has been studied in detail , still relatively little is known about the order of rrna - folding steps , how assembly factors influence rrna folding , and how this regulates the timely assembly of r - proteins .
recent biochemical and cryo electron microscopy ( cryo - em ) studies have provided important insights into restructuring events in late pre - 60s complexes9 - 14 , however , still little is known about rrna folding during the nucleolar stages .
to address this , we performed high - throughput rna structure probing analyses ( chemmodseq15 ) on purified nucleolar pre - 60s particles isolated from the yeast s. cerevisiae .
these data enabled us to generate a step - by - step model of the changes in rrna flexibility during the nucleolar stages of 60s assembly .
strikingly , our data indicate that the majority of the observed rrna restructuring events take place during the conversion of 27sa2 to 27sb .
during this stage , the 5.8s rrna undergoes major structural rearrangements .
these events coincide with the stable integration of r - proteins that are part of the polypeptide exit tunnel and the release of assembly factor rrp5 that plays an important role in chaperoning rrna folding16 .
furthermore , we provide the first comprehensive structural analysis of its2 secondary structure , which demonstrate that its2 forms a highly compact structure , consistent with recent phylogenetic analyses17 .
finally , comparing our nucleotide flexibility maps with the crystal structure of the 60s subunit enabled us to make predictions about the timing of the formation of r - protein - rrna interactions as well as the formation of many long - range inter - domain interactions within the 60s subunit rrnas .
collectively , the results provide insights into the temporal order of rrna restructuring events during 60s assembly and present a very useful resource for the design of more focussed functional analyses .
results purification of pre - 60s intermediates to measure rna structural differences between large subunit ( lsu ) pre - rrna species , we purified pre - 60s particles using tap - tagged bait proteins previously shown to be incorporated in complexes containing 35s ( mrd1 ) , 27sa2 ( rrp5 ) , and 27sb ( nsa2 ) rrnas ( fig. 1a , b ) 18 - 20 .
after igg affinity purification , co - precipitated pre - rrnas were resolved on an agarose gel and the rnas of interest were excised from the gel and purified .
to assess the homogeneity of the purified pre - rrna species , primer extension analysis was performed ( fig. 1b ) .
the data show that rrp5 - tap predominantly co - precipitated 27sa2 pre - rrna ( fig. 1b , lane 1 ) and nsa2 - tap almost exclusively co - precipitated 27sb pre - rrna ( fig. 1b , lane 2 ) .
as tap purifications with 90s - associated factors did not generate sufficient 35s pre - rrna for high - throughput pre - rrna structure probing analyses ( data not shown ) , we used a tap - tagged mrd1 mutant strain ( mrd1delta5 ) that is kinetically delayed in 35s pre - rrna processing but does not noticeably affect 27s pre - rrna levels ( supplementary fig. 1a , b ) 20 , 21 .
we also performed label - free quantitative mass spectrometry ( ms ) on the 60s pre - ribosomal particles purified using rrp5 and nsa2 as baits as well as 80s ribosomes , isolated using the translation initiation factor fun12 ( fig. 1c - e , supplementary fig. 1c - e ) .
we did not analyze the proteome of the mrd1delta5 particles as lsu assembly factors are likely highly under - represented in this complex , making the direct comparison with 60s particles complicated .
the pre - 60s ms data ( supplementary data 1 ) are in excellent agreement with previous proteomic analyses of rrp5 - and nsa2 - associated complexes14 , 22 - 24 .
early 90s - associated assembly factors only co - precipitated with rrp5 , consistent with rrp5 being part of both the 90s pre - ribosomes and early pre - 60s intermediates25 , while nsa2 associates with 27sb pre - rrna containing pre - 60s intermediates26 .
conversion of 27sa3 to 27sb requires 12 proteins that are interdependent for their assembly , and which are referred to as a3 factors ( fig. 1a ) 27 .
cleavage of 27sb at site c2 within its2 requires a set of assembly factors termed b - factors28 ( fig. 1a ) .
interestingly , most a3 factors ( nop7 , erb1 , ytm1 , rlp7 , cic1 , and nop15 ) were readily detectable in both rrp5 and nsa2 particles ( fig. 1c , d ) , suggesting that these proteins do not dissociate once 27sb has been generated .
notably , the a3 factors were significantly enriched over the b factors in the rrp5 pre - ribosomes ( fig. 1c ) , while in the nsa2 particle , a3 and b factors were present in comparable amounts ( fig. 1d ) .
assembly of the b factors takes place in two stages28 ; some b factors bind to the early 35s and 27sa2 pre - rrna containing pre - ribosomes ( nop2 , nip7 , rpf2 , rrs1 , rlp24 , nog1 , tif6 , mak11 , spb4 , and dpb10 ) , while others bind just prior to c2 cleavage ( nsa2 and nog2 ) .
consistent with this , the early b factors were detected in both the rrp5 and nsa2 pre - 60s intermediates , whereas the later b factors were predominantly present in the nsa2 particles ( fig. 1c , d ) .
further comparison between the r - protein content of the fun12 - , rrp5 - , and nsa2 - associated particles indicated that the purified pre - 60s intermediates contained a similar r - protein composition , although not all r - proteins could be detected with high confidence due to a dynamic range detection limit of the instruments .
note that in this manuscript , we combine both the old and new nomenclature for the yeast r - proteins29,30 .
the r - proteins that are readily detected in very early 60s pre - ribosomes , such as l3 / ul3 and l4 / ul4 were identified in equivalent amounts in rrp5 and nsa2 pre - 60s intermediates .
some r - proteins were slightly more abundant in the nsa2 particle compared to the rrp5 particle .
this modest imbalance could be explained by the fact that r - proteins become more stably incorporated into pre - ribosomes as the maturation progresses7 , 31 .
in conclusion , the purified pre - 60s complexes showed the expected protein composition , providing a good basis for our structure probing analyses .
chemmodseq analyses of purified pre - 60s ribosomes to obtain pre - rrna secondary structure information , the affinity purified pre - ribosomes were treated in vitro with the shape chemical 1 - methyl - 7 - nitroisatoic anhydride ( 1m7 ) .
subsequently , the pre - rrnas were resolved on agarose gels to remove contaminants and gel purified15 .
1m7 generically reacts with all four nucleotides in flexible ( mostly single - stranded ) regions and acylates the 2'oh of the ribose32 .
to be able to assess the effect of protein binding events on pre - rrna flexibility , we chemically probed pre - rrnas from proteinase k ( pk ) - treated particles ( fig. 2a , supplementary fig. 1f ) .
the rrna regions bound by proteins can become more reactive to 1m7 in the deproteinized particles , in particular , those regions where proteins contact areas of single - stranded rrna .
this provided us with a unique approach to monitor the proposed gradual stabilization of r - protein association with pre - ribosomes7 , 31. fig. 2 chemmodseq experimental workflow and data analysis .
a particles containing the 35s , 27sa2 , and 27sb pre - rrnas were purified using tap - tagged mrd1 , rrp5 , or nsa2 as baits , respectively .
chemical probing was performed on the purified particles as well as pk - treated particles .
as controls for natural primer extension stops , we also incubated purified particles and pk - treated particles with the 1m7 solvent ( dmso ) .
the rrnas were gel purified and their integrity was assessed on a bioanalyzer chip .
b - e many conformational changes take place between the 27a2 and 27sb particles .
shown are scatter plots that compare normalized shape reactivity values of the 35s data to 27sa2 and 27sb data ( b ) and ( c ) and 27sa2 compared to 27sb data ( d ) .
data generated from deproteinized particles is shown in e. the similarity between the data sets was determined by calculating pearson correlation coefficients the purity and integrity of the 27s pre - rrna samples were analyzed using a bioanalyzer ( 27s pre - rrnas ; fig. 2a ) or agarose gels ( 35s pre - rrna ; supplementary fig. 1b , lane 7 ) .
primer extension was performed to assess whether the samples were sufficiently modified ( data not shown ) .
subsequently , chemmodseq libraries were prepared from these samples and high - throughput sequenced .
chemmodseq data from two biological replicates were pooled to increase the total coverage , followed by calculation of normalized 1m7 reactivities33 .
the 1m7 reactivity data is provided in supplementary data 2 .
pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between 35s , 27sa2 , and 27sb data ( fig. 2b - d ) .
however , the 35s and 27sa2 data were considerably more highly correlated than either 35s or 27sa2 and 27sb .
these results suggest that the 27s pre - rrna undergoes major changes in rna flexibility during the conversion of the 27sa2 to 27sb particle and that the pre - rrna structure in the 35s and 27sa2 particles is quite similar .
the highest correlation between any two data sets in our analysis was found for deproteinized 27sa2 and 27sb pre - rrnas ( fig. 2e ) , indicating that many of the observed changes in reactivity between 27sa2 and 27sb may be due to rna - protein interactions .
to determine how the structural information provided by the 1m7 probing experiments compares to the crystal structure of the 25s rrna in the 60s subunit34 , for each domain in the 25s rrna , we calculated area under roc ( receiver operating characteristic ) curves using a binary classifier that only included nucleotides that were single stranded and not contacted by r - proteins in the crystal structure .
as expected , these data indicate that the very early pre - 60s intermediates analyzed in this study are structurally distinct from the mature 60s subunit ( supplementary fig. 2 ) .
these data further indicate that domains i , ii , and vi in the 35s and 27sa2 particles , and domains ii , iii , and v in the 27sb particle , are more similar to the crystal structure than other domains in these pre - 60s particles .
gradual assembly of r - proteins into 60s pre - ribosomes to identify statistically significant differences in pre - rrna nucleotide flexibility between the different particles , we employed the previously described deltashape algorithm35 .
shape reactivities from different particles were subtracted and reactivities were averaged over a three - nucleotide sliding window to reduce local signal fluctuation .
to be considered statistically significant , the difference in shape reactivity ( deltashape ) had to be at least 1 standard deviation higher than the mean deltashape values35 .
because the 35s and 27sa2 data showed very similar shape reactivity patterns , we focussed our analyses on the differences observed between 35s , 27sa2 , and the 27sb data ( fig. 3a , b ) .
the deltashape analyses confirmed that the 27sb particle showed a markedly different shape reactivity profile compared to the other samples analyzed ( fig. 3b ) .
almost all of the 25s rrna domains appeared to undergo conformational changes during the nucleolar stages of 60s assembly ( fig. 3a , b ) .
the most striking observations were the increase in nucleotide flexibility in the 3 ' end region of the 27sb pre - rrna ( domains iv - vi ) and the fact that the 5.8s showed significantly higher shape reactivity in the 35s and 27sa2 particles .
the latter suggests that the 5.8s region undergoes major conformational changes during the conversion of 27sa2 to 27sb ( also see below ) .
in contrast , relatively few changes in flexibility were observed in its2 ( fig. 3b ). fig. 3 folding of 25s rrna domains .

if a region is highlighted in purple , it is more reactive in the 27sb data .
deltashape reactivities were calculated as using code developed by the weeks lab36 .
c the heat map indicates the percentage of nucleotides in each 25s rrna domain ( indicated on the left side of each domain ) that showed a decreased or an increase reactivity when comparing the various particles ( 35s vs. 27sb and 27sa2 vs. 27sb ) as well as whether these changes were sensitive or insensitive to pk treatment .
shown are the results for all the nucleotides as well as the nucleotides that overlapped with r - protein - binding sites in the 60s crystal structure35 .
d overview of the pksrp sites in the three - dimensional structure of the 25s rrna35 .
most of the proposed protein - rrna interactions are concentrated on the solvent interface , with fewer pksrp sites identified on the subunit interface , central protuberance ( cp ) , and feet .
protein - binding sites were defined according to the crystal structure of the ribosome35 to be able to assess which changes in flexibility could be explained by protein - binding events , we next compared the pre - ribosome shape data to the data obtained from the pk - treated samples ( fig. 3c ) .
when we discuss pk - sensitive nucleotides , we refer to positions that showed significant deltashape values when comparing data from 35s or 27sa2 to 27sb particles , however , this change in flexibility was reversed in the pk - treated 27sb data .
when we discuss pk - insensitive sites , we refer to positions that showed significant deltashape values between 35s - 27a2 and 27sb particles , which were not reversed by pk treatment of the 27sb particles .
the majority of the nucleotides that showed a decrease in shape reactivity in 27sb particles were pk - insensitive .
these data suggest that these changes were unlikely the result of protein - binding events .
the majority of these sites was located in domains 0 - iii ( fig. 3c ) , indicating that these domains fold into a more compact structure in the nucleolus .
in contrast , most of the sites that showed increased flexibility in the 27sb particles were pk - sensitive and concentrated in domains iii - v. these data suggest that rna - binding proteins that interact with the 27sb particle ( such as assembly factors or r - proteins ) increase the flexibility of these domains .
interestingly , a fraction of these sites also overlapped with r - protein - binding sites ( fig. 3c ; r - protein - binding sites , increase in flexibility ) .
for a number of nucleotides , we observed a decrease in flexibility in 27sb particles , and these changes were pk - sensitive ( fig. 3c ; decrease in flexibility and pk - sensitive ) .
we speculate that gradual assembly of r - proteins that bind with low affinity to early 60s pre - ribosomes , but become more stably bound in later intermediates , could explain some of these changes3 , 7 , 24 , 36 , 37 , although alternative explanations are possible ( see discussion ) .
we refer to these sites as pksrp ( pk - sensitive shape reactive sites bound by r - proteins ) .
interestingly , most of the pksrp sites were mainly located / concentrated on the solvent - exposed interface ( in particular in domain i ) of the 60s subunit , but were under - represented on the subunit interface ( which includes domains iii and iv ) , the central protuberance , and the feet ( fig. 3d , supplementary data 3 , supplementary movie 1 ) .
formation of long - range inter - domain interactions several of the pksrp sites are contacted by the same ribosomal protein in the mature 60s subunit , but lie in different structural domains .
some of these nucleotides showed a decrease in reactivity during the conversion of 35s to 27sa2 and 27sa2 to 27sb .
we interpret these changes as gradual stabilization of r - protein binding and formation or stabilization of long - range and / or inter - domain interactions .
some examples are discussed below and a complete overview can be found in supplementary data 3 .
the locations of the pksrp sites suggest that interactions between domains i , ii , v , and vi are formed by l4 / ul4 , l17 / ul22 , and l42 / el43 during the conversion of 35s to 27sb pre - rrna ( fig. 4a ) .
similarly , we predict that several long - range interactions between domains iii and v are formed by l2 / ul2 , l34 / ul34 , and l43 / el43 in the nucleolus ( fig. 4b ) .
interestingly , in the latter cases , the r - proteins initially bind domain v during the conversion of 35s to 27sa2 and then bind domain iii in the 27sb particle. fig. 4 models of inter - domain interactions formed during nucleolar stages of 60s assembly .
the yellow spheres indicate r - proteins .
predicted protein - rrna interactions formed during the conversion of 35s of 27sa2 and the conversion of 27sa2 to 27sb are indicated with red and blue dots , respectively .
protein - binding sites were defined according to the crystal structure of the ribosome35 .
a binding of l17 / ul22 l4 / ul4 and l42 / el42 to domains i ( purple ) , v ( wheat ) , and vi ( green ) of the 25s during the conversion of 35s to 27sb pre - rrna .
b sequential binding of l43 / el43 , l2 / ul2 , and l34 / el34 brings domains iii ( pink ) and v ( wheat ) in close proximity collectively , the data shown here indicate that rrna - folding steps within many domains of the 25s rrna region take place in the nucleolus , suggesting that many distant domains in the pre - rrna could fold around the same time .
restructuring of 5.8s during the conversion of 27sa2 to 27sb the deltashape analyses as well as follow - up primer extension analyses indicated that the 5.8s region undergoes considerable structural rearrangements during the conversion of 35s to 27sb pre - rrna ( fig. 3b , supplementary fig. 3 ) .
closer inspection of modification patterns generated by both methods revealed that the major changes in rna flexibility in this region occur specifically during the conversion of 27sa2 to 27sb ( fig. 5a , compare lanes 2 and 3 , supplementary fig. 3a - c ) .
the observed restructuring likely coincides with binding of r - proteins to this region , which is indicated by the fact that some of their nucleotide - binding sites in the 5.8s became less flexible in the 27sb pre - rrna than in the earlier precursors ( fig. 5a ; supplementary fig. 3 ) , and that this reduction in flexibility was ( at least in part ) reversed in the deproteinized samples .
thus , our data suggest that the folding of some 5.8s regions may coincide with the binding of r - proteins l26 / ul24 , l35 / ul29 , and l37 / el37 to the 5.8s in the 27sb pre - rrna. fig. 5 the 5.8s region undergoes a major restructuring event during the conversion of 27sa2 to 27sb pre - rrna .

c overview of deltashape analysis in the 5.8s region .
yellow - colored nucleotides showed significantly higher shape values in 35s compared to the 27sb particle data nop12 has previously been reported to be important for the formation of h538 .
the nop12 - binding sites in 5.8s became less flexible in the 27sb particles ( fig. 5a ) , but this flexibility was restored upon deproteinization .
these data therefore suggest that nop12 - dependent formation of h5 may take place during the conversion of 27sa2 to 27sb .
helices h2 , h3 , parts of h4 and h10 , which are formed by base - paring interactions between 5.8s and the 25s ( fig. 5b ) , appeared to be mostly structured in all three precursors ( fig. 5a ; supplementary data 2 ) and did not show any statistically significant differences in reactivity between the 35s and 27sb data ( fig. 5c , black nucleotides ) .
these results indicate that many 5.8s - 25s base - pairing interactions form early , possibly co - transcriptionally .
consistent with this idea , the 25s nucleotides that base - pair with these 5.8s regions generally reacted poorly with 1m7 and did not show significant changes in flexibility in all the particles analyzed ( fig. 5c , supplementary data 2 ) .
thus , formation of 5.8s - 25s base - pairing interactions precedes folding of 5.8s .
other helices in 5.8s appeared to be unstructured in the 35s and 27sa2 particles but became significantly less flexible in the 27sb particle .
nucleotides in h5 - h8 were significantly more reactive to 1m7 in 35s and 27sa2 particles compared to 27sb ( fig. 5c ; supplementary data 2 ) .
as we were unable to probe later pre - 60s intermediates ( see discussion ) , we could not determine whether additional 5.8s restructuring occurs in later assembly intermediates .
however , a recent cryo - em study on a nuclear nog2 - associated pre - 60s particle , which has a similar protein composition as the nsa2 particle analyzed here , revealed that the structure of the 5.8s region is almost identical to that of 5.8s rrna in the mature ribosome12 , 34 ( supplementary fig. 4 ) .
therefore , it is reasonable to conclude that in the nsa2 particle , the 5.8s rrna is almost completely folded and that therefore the majority of restructuring events takes place during the conversion of 27sa2 to 27sb and involves formation of additional r - protein - rrna interactions .
its2 and flanking regions form compact structures our structure probing data show that in contrast to the 5.8s region , its2 is generally highly structured and does not appear to undergo any major changes in secondary structure during conversion of 35s to 27sb ( figs. 3b and 6b , c ) .
we compared our data to three previously proposed its2 secondary structure models ( fig. 6a ) : the " ring " model centered on phylogenetic analysis39 , the " hairpin " model , largely based on enzymatic and chemical rna structure probing40 , and a structure that we refer to as the " ring - pin model " 17 .
the latter is mostly based on phylogenetic data and is a hybrid of the ring and hairpin models ( fig. 6a ). fig. 6 its2 forms a very compact structure .

gray nucleotides are predicted to be single - stranded as they are not involved in watson - crick or hoogsteen base - pairing interactions and are not predicted to be bound by proteins in general , our chemmodseq data ( fig. 6b ) and follow - up primer - extension data ( fig. 6c , supplementary fig. 5 ) agree best with the ring - pin structure , which we also found to be consistent with previously published mutagenesis data41 - 43 ( supplementary fig. 6 ) .
the structure probing data support the proposed stem iii in the ring - pin model , involving many a - u base - pairs ( fig. 6a - c ) .
however , we note that although many nucleotides in region ii are drawn as single - stranded nucleotides ( fig. 6a ) , it appears that they are less flexible compared to other loop regions within its2 .
a recent pre - 60s cryo - em structure uncovered the structure of three a3 factors ( cic1 , rpl7 , and nop15 ) bound to fragments of its212 , essentially covering almost completely regions i and ii. this may explain why the probing data showed low flexibility in this region ( fig. 6d ) .
we did observe a strong reduction in reactivity in the flexibility of u6 near the 5 ' end of its2 in the deproteinized data , reminiscent of what was observed in cells depleted of a3 factors44 , 45 ( also see discussion ) .
in the cryo - em structure , this nucleotide appears to be contacted by cic1 and rlp712 , apparently stabilizing a conformation that favors 1m7 modification .
the observed reduction in 1m7 reactivity in deproteinized samples suggests that the high flexibility of this nucleotide is indeed associated with cic1 and rlp7 binding to the 5 ' end of its2 .
the 27sb particle reproducibly showed higher reactivities in its2 in the chemmodseq data , particularly in the 100 - 200 region ( fig. 6b ) .
although this may indicate that its2 undergoes structural rearrangements in the nsa2 particle , these sites were all located in bulge or loop regions ( fig. 6a ) , suggesting that these single - stranded regions are more effectively probed in the nsa2 particle .
this may be related to the differences in protein composition between the nsa2 and rrp5 particles .
discussion ribosome synthesis is a complex and dynamic process that involves the regulated folding of rrna and hierarchical assembly of r - proteins .
to obtain a step - by - step picture of the changes in rrna folding during 60s maturation , we isolated the 35s , 27sa2 , and 27sb pre - rrna intermediates from native pre - 60s particles and measured nucleotide flexibilities using a high - throughput rna structure probing method ( chemmodseq15 ) .
this allowed us to generate a global map of changes in rrna flexibility during the early nucleolar stages of pre - 60s maturation , providing novel insights into rrna restructuring events as well as the establishment and timing of long - range interactions that take place during nucleolar stages of assembly .
the work described here provides a solid basis for the future design of more focussed functional and structural studies .
we show that using specific tap - tagged baits and gel purification , we can effectively separate the 35s , 27sa2 , and 27sb pre - rrnas .
this was supported by primer extension , bioanalyzer , and agarose gel analyses ( figs. 1b and 2a and supplementary fig. 1b ) , thus arguing for the presence of a single rna species in each of the structural probing analyses .
however , specific affinity purified pre - rrna particles that contain a distinct pre - rrna species could naturally differ in protein content and structure as these particles go through various assembly states .
thus , our structure probing data likely show averaged 1m7 reactivity profiles of these pre - rrna particles .
nevertheless , our current data as well as our previously published work15 clearly demonstrate that conformational changes can effectively be detected in purified pre - ribosomes using chemical probing .
most of the restructuring we detected here are likely rate - limiting events that are triggered by the release of ribosome assembly factors , binding of r - proteins , or the activity of energy - dependent enzymes .
we also wished to compare the pre - rrna structures of nucleolar particles with later ( nuclear ) assembly intermediates .
however , because the pre - rrnas in these particles ( 5 ' - extended 25s species ) could not be separated from contaminating 25s rrna by gel electrophoresis , we were unable to perform these experiments .
generating sufficient quantities of highly pure 35s pre - rrna for high - throughput rna structure probing was very challenging .
in order to obtain sufficient 35s pre - rrna , we utilized a tap - tagged mrd1 mutant strain in which one of the rna - binding domains was deleted ( mrd1delta5 - tap ) .
although pre - 40s synthesis is impaired in the mrd1delta5 mutant , leading to the accumulation of 35s pre - rrna , it remains associated with 90s pre - ribosomes and the 25s rrna levels are similar to those of wild - type cells indicating that lsu processing is unaffected20 , 21 ( supplementary fig. 1a , b ) .
we therefore argue that the 35s pre - rrna purified from the mrd1delta5 mutant can be efficiently processed into mature 25s and 5.8s rrna .
as 35s pre - rrna accumulates in this strain , we cannot exclude that its folding kinetics differ from 35s pre - rrna purified from a wild - type strain .
however , we were able to purify several nanograms of 1m7 - probed 35s pre - rrna from the rrp5 - tap strain sufficient for primer extension analysis ( supplementary fig. 7 ) .
we did not observe any noticeable differences in reactivity pattern in the 5.8s region ( the region where many changes in rna flexibility were observed ) between the 35s pre - rrna purified from rrp5 - tap and mrd1delta5 - tap .
therefore , we argue that the mrd1delta5 mutation does not have a significant impact on the folding kinetics of the 27s region of 35s pre - rrna .
we also attempted in vivo structure probing experiments with the shape chemical 2 - methylnicotinic acid imidazolide ( nai ) 46 .
although this worked well for the stable cytoplasmic pre - 40s complexes15 , much to our surprise , incubating the cells with nai significantly reduced the recovery of the 35s and 27s pre - rrna species with tap - tagged baits .
as a result , we were unable to generate sufficient nai - probed pre - rrna for high - throughput structure probing analyses .
one potential reason is that these early assembly intermediates become unstable during the relatively long incubation times ( 5 - 10 min ) required for optimal nai modification .
one could argue that ex vivo analyses of the pre - ribosomes do not fully capture the state of the particle under physiological conditions .
however , it is important to note that we purified the particles under conditions that are frequently used for tandem - affinity purification ( tap ) of ribosome assembly intermediates as well as for cryo - em studies .
therefore , the advantage of the ex vivo analyses is that we can directly compare our data with previously published structural and biochemical studies .
we report a detailed secondary structure analysis of the its2 region using the shape reagent 1m7 .
in contrast to dms used in previous studies44 , 45 , 47 , 48 that probes a 's and c 's , 1m7 allows to assay the flexibility of all four nucleotides .
our data indicate that its2 forms a very compact and helical structure , since 1m7 reactivity was generally much lower in its2 than in other regions , for example , 5.8s ( fig. 6c ) .
our data provides experimental support for a recently proposed secondary structure that we refer to as the ring - pin model , that is largely based on phylogenetic analyses17 .
furthermore , our results are in good agreement with the recent cryo - em structure of a late pre - 60s intermediate in which two fragments of its2 ( fig. 6d ) were resolved12 .
on the basis of the combined results of rrna structure predictions , enzymatic and chemical probing experiments , and genetic analyses37 - 40 , it has been proposed that its2 may undergo a conformational switch that would allow 27sb pre - rrna to be cleaved at site c2 .
our data provides no support for such a dramatic conformational change during nucleolar ribosome assembly , as its2 as well as its flanking regions that base - pair with 25s adopt a similar conformation in all particles analyzed ( fig. 6 ) .
however , we cannot exclude that such a switch occurs co - transcriptionally .
chemical probing analyses have revealed that depletion of a3 factors influence the dms modification pattern of nucleotides near the 5 ' end of its244 , 47 .
these data suggest that a3 factors are involved in maintaining an open structure of its2 and that their release could re - structure its2 , such as into the proposed compact hairpin structure .
our chemical probing data did not reveal dramatic differences in nucleotide flexibility of its2 upon deproteinization of the native 27sa2 and 27sb particles ( fig. 6 ) .
we did observe a significant reduction in the flexibility of u6 in the 5 ' its2 in our deproteinized samples , which appears to be contacted by cic1 and rlp7 in the cryo - em structure .
we therefore consider it more likely that the a3 factors influence the its2 structure locally , rather than being involved in drastic structural rearrangements such as the proposed open ( ring ) to closed ( hairpin ) conformational switch .
in agreement with this , the nucleotides that showed differential reactivity to dms upon a3 factor depletion44 , 47 overlap with or are in close proximity to cic1 - and rlp7 - binding sites12 , 44 , 47 .
these nucleotides did not strongly react with 1m7 in our particles or the pk - treated samples .
a plausible explanation for these discrepancies is that 1m7 reacts with the 2'oh of the ribose , whereas dms probes the bases of unpaired c 's and a's. it is possible that , due to riboses being constrained by proteins binding at or near these nucleotides , they may not react with 1m7 , whereas corresponding bases still can be modified by dms .
our analyses enabled us to determine the exact timing of major restructuring events in the 5.8s rrna sequence .
formation of 5.8s - 25s base - pairing interactions very likely takes place during transcription as those regions that form these base - pairing interactions generally reacted poorly to 1m7 and showed no significant changes in reactivity in the particles analyzed ( fig. 7 ) .
moreover , while in the 35s and 27sa2 particles the 5.8s region appeared largely unfolded , it was highly structured in the 27sb - containing nsa2 particles , suggesting that 5.8s undergoes major structural rearrangements during the conversion of 27sa2 to 27sb ( fig. 7 ) .
one possibility is that these restructuring events coincide with the binding of r - proteins to 5.8s .
our chemmodseq data show that flexibility changes in some nucleotides are indeed pk - sensitive , hinting that this could be the case for some regions .
the data do not allow us to determine what comes first : rna folding followed by r - protein binding , or whether the r - proteins actually induce the folding of the rna .
however , the data do suggest that r - proteins are at least partially required to stabilize the more constrained structure of some nucleotides shortly after it has been formed .
consistent with this idea , deletion of l26 / ul24 also increases the flexibility around helices h6 and h7 in the 5.8s rrna49 .
stable incorporation of r - proteins that interact with the 5.8s region ( l26 / ul24 , l35 / ul29 , and l37 / el37 ) requires the a3 factors , and it was proposed that rrna remodeling by a3 factors might generate the binding sites for these r - proteins , allowing their stable incorporation into the pre - 60s27 .
a3 proteins were abundantly detected in our 27sa2 and 27sb particles ( fig. 1 ) .
yet depletion of cic1 and nop15 does not noticeably affect the in vivo structure of 5.8s44 , suggesting that a3 factors do not directly influence 5.8s folding. fig. 7 model of rrna structural changes and pre - 60s remodeling steps that take place during the nucleolar stages of 60s synthesis .
its2 forms a highly compact structure in the nascent transcript .
we predict that base - pairing interactions between 25s and 5.8s have already been formed co - transcriptionally .
major rrna restructuring events occur in pre - ribosomal complexes during the conversion of 27sa2 pre - rrna to 27sb pre - rrna .
these include the compaction of the 5.8s region and formation of long - range interactions in the 25s sequence .
all these changes occur after rrp5 dissociates and in the presence of a3 and early b factors .
after c2 cleavage , the 5s rrna rotates to adopt its final structure64 l17 / ul22 , l35 / ul29 , and l37 / el37 were recently shown to be essential for the association of the late b - factors48 .
thus , our current working hypothesis is that the stable incorporation of these 5.8s r - proteins into pre - 60s complexes signals that 5.8s rrna folding has been successfully completed , paving the way for the assembly of the late b - factors and cleavage at site c2 ( fig. 7 ) .
recent work has indicated that many r - proteins bind early pre - 60s complexes with low affinity and that their association gradually becomes more stable during later assembly steps .
interestingly , we frequently observed a decrease in flexibility of nucleotides that overlapped with r - protein - binding sites identified in the 60s crystal structure34 .
the change in flexibility of these nucleotides was ( largely ) restored when the particles were deproteinized ( pk - sensitive sites ; pksrp ) , indicating that the change in nucleotide flexibility was the result of protein - rna interactions .
these data therefore allowed us to speculate about the formation of r - protein - rrna interactions during pre - 60s assembly .
the chemical probing data do not provide direct evidence that the observed changes in rrna flexibility were indeed mediated by r - protein binding to the nucleotide .
indeed , there are a few alternative scenarios that could explain the appearance of pk - sensitive sites .
it is possible that r - proteins binding in the vicinity or transient binding of ribosome assembly factors could induce the observed change in flexibility .
for example , we observed changes in the binding sites for l42 / el42 , which we were unable to detect by ms and which were found to be mostly enriched in the late ( arx1 ) pre - 60s complexes and the mature 80s ribosomes36 .
therefore , it is plausible that , in some cases , the observed changes in flexibility could be the result of another protein ( such as an assembly factor ) occupying these sites .
it has been suggested that assembly of pre - 60s particles takes place in an hierarchical fashion and that the structural domains are formed in 5 ' - 3 ' directionality ( or at least some regions in the 5 ' domain need to be assembled before the formation of 3 ' domains can take place ) 50 .
this model proposed that the convex solvent side of the 60s starts to form first followed by the polypeptide exit tunnel and finishing with the central protuberance .
a large number of r - proteins interact with multiple domains of the 25s rrna34 and therefore , intuitively , it seems logical that binding of r - proteins must affect the folding of multiple domains .
it is conceivable that long - range interactions could already be established at a very early stage of assembly and that several ( parallel ) assembly pathways might exist .
our analysis provided an opportunity to address this from the rna perspective. by focussing on those changes in nucleotides that we predicted were the result of r - protein - rrna interactions ( pksrp sites ) , we asked which domains of the 25s rrna were most likely to undergo r - protein induced folding .
consistent with the proposed hierarchical assembly model50 , our results do indicate that most of the pksrp sites in nucleolar pre - 60s complexes concentrated on the solvent interface of the 60s subunit ( domains i and ii ) , whereas fewer predicted changes in protein - rrna interactions were detected on the subunit interface side ( domains iii and iv ) and the central protuberance , which were proposed to fold later ( fig. 3c ) .
however , our results also support the idea that r - proteins forge contacts between many distant domains ( such as interactions between domains i , ii , iii and v , vi ) at a very early stage .
the next challenges will be to determine what role assembly factors play in directing these folding steps , and to generate detailed maps of the 60s rrna - folding pathways .
we expect that ( near ) atomic resolution cryo - em , combined with rna structure probing and crystallographic data , will greatly accelerate our understanding of the dynamics of ribosome assembly .
methods yeast strains s. cerevisiae strain by4741 ( mata ; his3delta1 ; leu2delta0 ; met15delta0 ; ura3delta0 ) was used as the parental strain .
the tap - tagged rrp5 and nsa2 strains were taken from the yeast tap - fusion open reading frame ( orf ) collection ( ge healthcare ) and were grown in ypda media ( 2 % glucose , 1 % yeast extract , and 2 % peptone ) ( formedium ) .
the tap - tagged mrd1 mutant was previously described51 as asy055 .
asy055 cells were grown overnight in ypga media ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % peptone , 2 % galactose , and 2 % raffinose ) , shifted to ypda media , and grown for 8 h at 30 degreesc to an optical density ( od600 ) of 1 .
synthesis of 1m7 synthesis of 1m7 was performed as previously described32 , 52 .
briefly , sodium hydride ( 60 % dispersion in mineral oil , 1.4 equiv , 5.72 mmol , 229 mg ) was suspended in 13 ml of dimethylformamide ( dmf anhydrous grade from sigma - aldrich ) under a nitrogen atmosphere and stirred for 5 min .
4 - nitroisatoic anhydride ( 1 equiv , 4.08 mmol , 850 mg ) in dmf ( 9 ml ) and then methyl iodide ( 1.05 equiv , 4.29 mmol , 609 mg , 270 microl ) were added dropwise , and the reaction stirred for 24 h. the reaction mixture was added to partially frozen 1 m hcl ( 150 ml ) forming a yellow precipitate .
this was recovered by filtration , washed with water , then ether and dried under vacuum for 14 h to yield crude product .
this was then triturated from ether / pentane and dried under vacuum for a further 14 h to yield 1 - methyl - 7 - nitroistoic anhydride ( 585 mg , 64 % ; supplementary data 4 ) .
immunoprecipitation and chemical modification of rrna cells were collected at od600 ~ 1.0 and lysed in 4 v g - 1 ice cold tmn150 buffer ( 50 mm tris ph 8 , 150 mm nacl , 0.1 % np - 40 , 1.5 mm mgcl2 , and roche protease inhibitor cocktail ) by vortexing for 5 min with 3 v per g of 0.5 mm zirkonia beads ( thistle ) 53 .
the lysate was incubated with 400 mul igg sepharose beads ( amersham ) for 1 h at 4 degreesc .
the beads were then washed three times 5 min with 10 ml tmn150 buffer at 4 degreesc and finally resuspended in 200 mul tmn150 buffer .
subsequently , the beads were incubated with 1m7 ( dissolved in dmso , 12.5 mm final ) or dmso ( negative control ) for 3 min at room temperature .
the final concentration of dmso was 5 % .
to deproteinize the particles , complexes bound to igg beads were resuspended in 200 microl tmn150 buffer containing 1 % sds and incubated with 2 microg per microl pk for 3 h at 14 degreesc prior to 1m7 modification .
the rna was phenol - chloroform - extracted , ethanol - precipitated , and resolved on a 1 % low - melting agarose gel ( seaplaque gtg agarose , lonza ) .
the pre - rrna were subsequently excised from the gel and extracted by melting the agarose melted at 65 degreesc with five gel volumes of extraction buffer ( 10 mm tris - hcl , 1 mm edta , ph 7.5 ) .
rna was subsequently purified by phenol - chloroform extraction and ethanol - precipitated .
purified 27s pre - rrnas were quantified on a 2100 bioanalyzer ( agilent ) using an rna nano 6000 assay .
all experiments were performed at least twice , and for each particle , we included separate control experiments .
this was performed to minimize variability in coverage profiles between modified and control experiments .
primer extension analyses reverse transcription was performed using superscript iii ( invitrogen ) with 8 ng of purified rrna and 32p - radiolabeled oligonucleotides .
samples were incubated at 45 degreesc for 45 min , after which 1 microl of exonuclease i ( neb ) was added , followed by a 30 - min incubation at 37 degreesc .
reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 microl of rna loading dye ( neb ) .
sequencing ladders were prepared using a plasmid containing an rdna repeat ( pbs - rdna ) and sequenase v2.0 ( usb / affymetrix ) .
samples were resolved on a 6 % polyacrylamide / 8 m urea gels .
band intensities were quantified using the fla5100 phosphoimager system ( fuji ) .
signal decay correction was done using exponential function ( b = 0.999 for dmso and b = 0.995 for 1m7 treated samples ) .
structural reactivities were calculated by subtracting band intensity in the control lane from that of corresponding nucleotide in 1m7 lane .
all negative values were set to zero .
all values were 2 - 8 % normalized .
1m7 / dmso ratios were calculated and reactivities of nucleotides with 1m7 / dmso < 1.5 were also set to zero to avoid false - positives .
oligonucleotides used for primer extensions were : its2 _ 143 - 162 ( 5 ' - gattagccgcagttggtaaa - 3 ') , its2 _ 58 _ 77 ( 5 ' - catccaatgaaaaggccagc - 3 ') , its2nt162 ( 5 ' - gattagccgcagttggtaaa - 3 ') , and 25snt47 ( 5 ' - gatatgcttaagttcagc - 3 ') .
northern blot analysis northern blot analysis was performed essentially as described54 , using the following oligonucleotides : rdn1c ( 5 ' - atgaaaactccacagtg - 3 ') rdn1e ( 5 ' - ggccagcaatttcaagt - 3 ') chemmodseq library preparation and sequence data analysis chemmodseq libraries were prepared as described by hector et al.15 a detailed overview of all the adapter sequences and primers used is provided in supplementary table 1 .
individual libraries were pooled based on concentration and barcoding , and paired - end sequencing was performed on hiseq systems by edinburgh genomics ( edinburgh ) .
raw data processing was carried out using the pycrac software package55 and our chemmodseq pipeline ( see data and code availability section below ) .
data from replicate experiments were summed to increase the total coverage .
the chemmodseqpipeline python script runs the complete data processing pipeline .
we initially used the tcp _ em algorithm15 for identifying 1m7 - modified nucleotides .
however , our recent comparative analyses showed that , although this algorithm has a high specificity , it generally calls a much lower number of nucleotides modified compared to our shape reactivity script56 , which is why we decided not to use it for these analyses .
in this manuscript , we calculated shape reactivities according to the structurefold method33 using the calculateshape _ reactivities.py script .
the chemmodseq pipeline first trims the adapter sequences from the reads using flexbar57 followed by demultiplexing of the samples using pybarcodefilter from the pycrac package .
this removed the barcode information in the forward reads except for the last random nucleotide , which was removed using the trimnucs.py script .
the random barcode information ( seven random nucleotides ) was subsequently used to collapse the data ( pyfastqduplicateremover.py ) .
the resulting fasta output files were mapped to the yeast rdna sequence using novoalign 2.04 .
the pyreadcounter.py script was subsequently used to generate gene transfer format ( gtf ) interval files from the novo files that contained merged coordinates of read pairs that mapped to the 35s within 1000 nucleotides from each other .
only properly paired reads were considered for the analyses .
the resulting gtf files were then used to generate pileups containing drop - off counts and coverage information for the 35s and 27s sequences ( using pygtf2sgr.py ) .
these count data were subsequently used to calculate shape reactivities using the calculateshape _ reactivities.py script , which also applies 2 - 8 % normalization to scale the values between 0 and ~ 2 .
the deltashape reactivities were calculated using python code from the weeks lab35 .
the deltashape values for the 27sb region in each sample analyzed is provided in supplementary data 2 .
mass spectrometry rrp5p - prota , nsa2 - prota , fun12 - prota , and controls ( w303a , prota - tag expressed alone ) were grown in ypd , collected in logarithmic phase ( od600 0.6 - 0.85 ) , and cryo - lysed as previously described58 .
the affinity purifications were performed in technical triplicates for samples and singulate for controls .
the purification of rrp5 - prota , nsa2 - prota was performed in rnp150 ( 20 mm hepes - koh ph 7.4 , 110 mm koac , 0.5 % triton x - 100 , 0.1 % tween - 20 , 1 : 100 solution p , 1 : 5000 antifoam a , and 150 mm nacl ) and purification of fun12 - pra was performed in tbt150 ( same as rnp150 supplemented with 2 mm mgcl2 , 1 : 1000 dtt ) as described elsewhere58 .
briefly , 0.5 g of slightly thawed , cryo - lysed cell powder was vortex - resuspended in nine volumes of extraction buffer and further homogenized using a polytron ( 30 '' on ice ) .
the centrifuged - cleared sample ( 3200 x g , 10 ' , 4 degreesc ) was incubated ( 30 ' , slow rotation , 4 degreesc ) with 7.5 mg of dynabeads conjugated with rabbit igg ( 160 microg igg per mg bead ) pre - equilibrated in extraction buffer .
prior to on - bead digestion , the beads were washed 10 times with extraction buffer ; once with 100 mm nh4oac / 0.1 mm mgcl2 / 0.1 % tween - 20 ( room temperature , slow rotation , 5 ') ; four times with 100 mm nh4oac / 0.1 mm mgcl2 ( three times fast and once at room temperature , slow rotation , 5 min ) ; and once with 20 mm tris - hcl ( ph 8.0 ) .
subsequent to single - step affinity purification ( ssap ) purification , one - tenth of each affinity purification sample was eluted ( 0.5 m nh4oh ) and resolved on 4 - 12 % gradient bis - tris nupage gels for silver staining .
the remaining samples were on - bead trypsin digested in a volume of 50 microl ( 20 mug per ml trypsin ( sigma , proteomics grade ) in 20 mm tris - hcl ( ph 8.0 ) , 37 degreesc , 900 r.p.m. , 16 - 20 h , and stopped with 2 % formic acid59 ) and analyzed by tandem ms as described previously58 .
briefly , dried tryptic digests were zip tipped ( millipore , as per supplier recommendations ) and loaded onto a c - 18 reverse - phase capillary column ( 15 cm x 75 mum ( length ( l ) x internal diameter ( i.d. )) ; 5 mum particles , 300 a ) for electrospray ionization time - of - flight ms. ionization was performed by a proxeon nanoelectrospray flex ion source set to 1.3 - 1.7 kv. chromatographic separation of peptides was performed at 250 degreesc on an easy - nlc ii system ( proxeon biosystems ) at 300 nl per min , first over a gradient ( 20 min ) from 95 % solvent a ( water - - 0.1 % formic acid ) to 25 % b ( 100 % acetonitrile , 0.1 % formic acid ) ; then to 45 % b ( 40 min ) ; and finally to 80 % b ( 10 min ) .
parent ion scans were performed in the hcd cell of the q - exactive ( thermo fisher scientific ) over a mass range of 360 - 2000 m / z at a resolving power of 70 000 .
the automatic gain control ( agc ) target and maximum ion fill time ( it ) were set to 1 x 106 and 100 ms respectively .
fragments were obtained with a normalized collision energy of 27 , an intensity threshold of 1.2 x 104 , and underfill of 0.9 % .
data - dependent mode was used , in which 14 most intense precursor ions were isolated with a dynamic exclusion window of 15 s. ms / ms was acquired using a resolution of 17 500 , an agc target of 1 x 105 , and a maximum it of 50 ms. data were processed with thermo excalibur to generate a raw file .
mascot search server ( version 2.3.0260 ) was used with a parent tolerance of 10 p.p.m. for precursor ions , 0.52 da for fragments , and only considering one possible missed cleavage as well as a mass change of + 16 for methionine oxidations in the mass calculation .
data were searched against s. cerevisiae database of ncbi ( txid4932 , 20140813 release ) and analyzed in scaffold ( version 3.6.4 ) .
the threshold and false discovery rates were set to 80 % and 0.37 % , respectively , for peptides , and to 95 % ( 1 peptide minimum ) and 1.9 % , respectively , for proteins .
exclusive spectrum counts ( escs ) were used for analysis to discriminate against peptides shared between paralog proteins .
for each prey , the highest values obtained in the controls were removed from those of the samples during analysis .
preys were defined as legitimate if they had at least two significantly enriched spectrum counts in at least two of the three replicates and selected for semi - quantitative analysis .
the preys not selected for analysis are listed in supplementary data 1 .
for semi - quantitative analysis , exclusive spectral counts for l3 were used to normalize the data because it enters early during ribosome biogenesis and it was found in the three bait proteins in similar counts50 , 61 , 62 .
semi - quantitative results were color - coded into four categories , high confidence and quantifiable ( in red , > 10esc , 3 / 3 ) ; highly probable but not quantifiable ( in orange , 7.5 - 9.9esc , in 2 / 3 ) ; probable but not quantifiable ( in yellow , 5 - 7.49esc , in 2 / 3 ) ; and some evidence ( in gray , 2 - 4.9esc , 2 / 3 ) .
standard deviations were calculated for the triplicates .

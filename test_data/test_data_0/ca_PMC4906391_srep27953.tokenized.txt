however , catalytic efficiency and detergent tolerability need to be improved in order to be used for industrial application .
in this work , we obtained several keratinase variants with enhanced catalytic efficiency , thermophilicity , and anti - salt and detergent tolerability by partially truncating the ppc domain of kersmd .
the variants all showed improved catalytic efficiency to synthetic substrate aapf , with the v355 variant having the highest kcat / km value of 143.6 s - 1 mm - 1 .
the truncation of keratinase had little effect on alkaline stability but obviously decreased collagenase activity , developing its potential application in leather treatment .
the variants v380 , v370 , and v355 were thermophilic , with a 1.7 - fold enhancement of keratinlytic activity at 60 degreesc when compared to the wild type .
the entire truncation of ppc domain obtained the variant v355 with improved tolerance to alkalinity , salt , chaotropic agents , and detergents .
the v355 variant showed more than a 40 % improvement in activity under 15 % ( w / v ) nacl or 4 % ( w / v ) sds solution , showing excellent stability under harsh washing and unhairing conditions .
our work investigated how protein engineering affects the function of ppc domain of kersmd .
since biocatalysts are environmentally friendly and necessary for sustainable development , commercial enzymes are extensively used in the pharmaceutical , leather , and textile industry , as well as in the biotreatment for food123 .
enzymes abundant in nature have been isolated and used for these industrial applications , however , their poor tolerance toward ph , temperature , organic solvents , salt , and abstergent and oxidative reagents drastically restrict their catalytic performance and application4567 .
therefore , increasing attention is being paid to find high performance enzymes that can adapt to extreme environments as well as possessing a wide substrate specificity .
protein engineering strategies , such as site - directed mutagenesis and directed evolution , are always used to create excellent enzymes8910 .
those strategies are popular in the field of biotechnology , however , disadvantages still exist .
site - directed mutagenesis should be based on the crystal structure of the protein being engineered , while directed evolution needs a random mutant library for high - throughput screening101112 .
those two strategies can be time - consuming and ultimately fruitless .
therefore , it is necessary to establish a simple bio - technique for molecular modification .
it was found that some enzymes , such as amylases and dextranase , have unnecessary amino acids or domains at the c - terminus , and its truncation mutants have shown improved catalytic efficiency as well as other enzymatic properties1314 .
recently , we found that a few proteases have bacterial pre - peptidase c - terminal domains ( ppc domains ) 151617 .
the ppc domain always has a single alpha - helix packed against an antiparallel beta - sheet to form beta - strands .
for example , the deleted c - terminal mutants of the halophilic protease mcp - 03 showed that c - terminal domain was unnecessary for enzyme secretion but could improve catalytic efficiency18 .
another example of this is the c - terminal truncation of the alkaline protease hp70 enhancing the specific activity to suc - aapf - pna nearly 4 - fold19 .
therefore , c - terminal truncation to improve enzyme catalytic efficiency seems like a viable strategy .
keratinase is an excellent enzyme for feather degradation , textile treatment , leather depilation , and as well as several other industrial application20 .
in our previous work , we isolated a novel keratinase kersmd and conducted heterologous expression in escherichia coli successfully2122 .
kersmd shows great potential in hydrolyzing keratin material , but low catalytic activity , broad substrate selectivity , and bad tolerability to salt and detergent may prevent its industrial application .
fortunately , protein engineering may be a powerful method to turn the situation around4 .
our recent work showed that kersmd has an independent c - terminal domain and its truncation or replacement could affect enzymatic properties22 .
therefore , studies related to the function of the c - terminal domain should be investigated .
in this work , we constructed a library of keratinase kersmd mutants by partial truncation of c - terminal domain .
all variants were successfully expressed in e. coli , and their biochemical properties ( e.g. , expression quantity , substrate specificity , kinetic parameters , thermostability , alkaline stability , salt stability , and detergent tolerance ) were characterized .
these findings not only shine light on the function of the c - terminal domain of kersmd but also provided a useful strategy for protein engineering to improve enzyme specific activity and catalytic efficiency .
results and discussion construction and expression of kersmd and its truncated mutants there is a special c - terminal domain ( ppc domain ) with a size of about 100 amino acids found in keratinase kersmd. from our previous report , we have discussed its potential function to enhance substrate specificity of insoluble substrate22 .
in this work , the secondary structure of ppc domain was predicted ( fig. 1a ) .
we could see that the secondary structure of the c - terminal domain consisted mainly of six beta - folds ( beta - fold1 , beta - fold2 , beta - fold3 , beta - fold4 , beta - fold5 , and beta - fold6 ) which might be important to protein stability .
to further study the roles of that domain , sites among the beta - fold were chosen for truncation and mutants of kersmd were constructed as shown in fig. 1b .
deletions were from 7 to 112 residues at the c - terminus , 2.6 to 24 % of the total length of kersmd .
the c - terminal truncated derivatives were expressed in e. coli .
after three days of fermentation , keratinolytic supernatant was detected and collected for purification .
the sds - page showed that kersmd and variants were about 42 kda ( fig. 2a ) .
though the c - terminus was partially truncated , there was no obvious difference in molecular sizes of those variants .
however , the secretion levels of keratinases increased significantly from variant v456 to v355 .
deletion of the entire c - terminal domain contributed to the highest protein concentration in extracellular broth of v370 variant ( fig. 2a ) .
the purified keratinase derivatives were also analyzed by sds - page ( fig. 2b ) .
kersmd displayed a molecular size of 42 kda , a litter bigger than other variants which were ranged from 40 kda to 42 kda .
we have learned that partial truncation of the c - terminus could greatly increase keratinase secretion while minimally affecting molecule size .
we hypothesize that the c - terminal domain may inhibit the function of outer membrane proteins for secretion .
similar reports have also shown that c - terminal truncation could increase expression rate of proteases1719 .
since the ppc domain has many hydrophobic residues , such as phe and leu , the increased affinity to bind to hydrophobic membrane proteins or lipids may decline extracellular transport of keratinase22 .
besides , the unexpected migration of protein bands on the sds - page may be related to the covalently linked n - propeptide , which was not auto - processed during enzyme maturation and increased keratinase molecule sizes .
this deduction was according to our previous study that c - terminal truncation could inhibit n - terminal processing23 .
effects of truncation on substrate specificity and kinetic parameters the wild type kersmd and c - terminal deletion variants showed different enzyme activities on macromolecule and micromolecule substrates .
as shown in table 1 , all enzymes had proteolytic activities to both casein and feather , indicating that either partial or complete truncation of c - terminal domain had little influence on protein folding .
we infer that the c - terminus is an independent domain which is related to substrate specificity .
increasing the number of amino acid deletions led to enhancement of caseinolytic activity and catalytic efficiency ( kcat ) of variants v415 and v355 .
the truncation of beta - fold6 did not decrease caseinolytic and keratinolytic activities too much .
however , losing more than two beta - folds ( beta5 and beta6 ) resulted in a substantial decrease of keratinolytic activity of feather .
we deduce that beta5 probably is an important structure to the ppc domain in order to maintain spatial integrality or bind keratin substrate .
truncating half of the beta - folds resulted in low caseinolytic activities of variants v435 and v415 .
this may be related to protein conformational changes because the high substrate binding ability ( low value of turnover , km ) did not significantly enhance catalytic efficiency as shown in table 1 .
certainly , the exposure of hydrophobic amino acids can also block pocket to receive substrates .
in summary , c - terminal deletion was beneficial for enhancing catalytic efficiency to casein and aapf and the whole truncation of c - terminal domain contributed the highest caseinolytic activity and kcat / km value to v355 .
all the results indicate that c - terminal domain is important for substrate specificity .
since collagen - degrading ability of kersmd may prevent its application in leather industry , it is important to change substrate specificity by protein engineering. from our previous work , we have found that ppc domain of keratinase kersmd shared high identity to the vep c - ter 100 , which has the function of binding to collagen2224 .
so , we deduce that collagenase activity of kersmd may be related to ppc domain .
the sds - page analysis of collagen degradation was conducted to kersmd , c - terminal deletion mutant v355 , and alkaline serine protease ( fig. 3 ) .
it showed that alkaline serine protease from bacillus licheniformis had the highest ability to digest insoluble collagen , and kersmd came second .
the soluble protein in the supernatant mainly appeared in the reaction mixture of alkaline serine protease ( fig. 3 ) .
there was hardly any digestion of collagen by the c - terminal deletion variant v355 .
kersmd was similar to the major extracellular protease of the nosocomial pathogen stenotrophomonas maltophilia which showed obvious activity to degrade collagen and damage skin25 .
deleting the c - terminal domain might overcome the disadvantage of kersmd to broaden its application in the food and leather industry .
in addition , the ideal protease in leather treatment always needed keratinolytic activity but no collagenase activity for dehairing , and our mutants may be suitable for that application26 .
effects of truncation on thermostability the ppc domain of protease was always characterized as an important factor in improving enzyme thermostability .
in order to evaluate whether the ppc domain of kersmd has similar functions , we further studied the temperature stability and sensitivity of the wild type and its truncated variants .
as shown in fig. 4a , partial deletion of c - terminal domain decreased enzyme activity of keratinase at 50 degreesc but significantly increased its activity at 60 degreesc .
variant v370 , which had the entire truncation of beta - folds of the c - terminal domain , obtained the highest keratinolytic activity of 5760 u mg - 1 at 60 degreesc , about a 1.7 - fold improvement compared to the wild type ( 3280 u mg - 1 ) .
it seemed that the deletion of the c - terminal domain contributed to the keratinase thermophilic property .
however , increasing the temperature resulted in enormous decreases of all mutants except for v456 which showed the highest activity at 70 degreesc .
we deduce that beta - fold6 may be a potential repressor of enzyme catalysis .
the keratinase thermostability at 50 degreesc was also analyzed ( fig. 4b ) .
it seemed that truncation of the c - terminal domain always had a disadvantage on enzyme stability .
the variant v415 , a half truncation of the c - terminal domain , showed the worst stability , which was a 10 % decline of enzyme activity when compared with the wild type .
however , all variants still showed more than 40 % residual activity after a 90 - minute incubation .
the variant v456 improved enzyme stability by about 20 % at the end of heat inactivation process ( fig. 4b ) .
the c - terminal extension was common in amylase , and its truncation can enhance enzyme thermal stability27 .
however , the deletion of the c - terminal domains of halophilic protease mcp - 03 decreased thermal stability18 .
the hyperthermostable protease tk - sp also required a c - terminal domain for hyperstability17 .
though our results showed that the deletion of the ppc domain of keratinase kersmd increases its thermophilicity but may reduce thermal stability , a partial truncation was interesting to improve enzyme stability .
we could apply thermophilic but instable keratinase mutants for some special processes which need enzyme inactivation after food treatment .
effects of truncation on alkaline and salt tolerability the keratinase kersmd is an alkaline protease and we deduced that the ppc domain may be related to enzyme alkalophilicity .
it showed that partial truncation of the ppc domain resulted in activity decrease at ph 9.0 - 12.0 ( fig. 5a ) .
however , the complete deletion of the ppc domain enhanced the basophilicity of variant v355 , which showed more than a 40 % increase in relative activity at a ph of 12.0 .
compared to the wild type keratinase , the variant v355 also improved its activity by about 10 % in neutral solution ( ph 7.0 ) .
though the truncation of the ppc domain decreased alkaline tolerability , variants v355 and v456 had more than 50 % residual activity , approaching the value of wild type ( fig. 5b ) .
since the processes of feather degradation and leather dehairing were always in an alkaline environment , the high performance of alkaline keratinase could be more meaningful2628 .
anti - salt or halotolerance is an important characteristic to evaluate whether the enzyme can be used in industrial processes1829 .
we used different concentrations of nacl to monitor the halotolerance of kersmd and its different variants ( fig. 5c ) .
variants v395 , v380 , v370 , and v355 all tended to be halophilic keratinases whose activities were enhanced by 5 % ( w / v ) nacl .
those four mutants all showed higher residual activity than the wild type and other mutants in high concentration saline solution .
the variant v355 obtained the highest tolerability to salt , nearly 60 % activity in 15 % ( w / v ) nacl solution .
the halophilic phenomenon might relate to the asp and glu residues that could resist electrolytes30 .
comparison of the sequences of halophilic and non - halophilic variants showed that the ratio of asp and glu residues was larger in halophilic variants ( fig. s1 ) .
suitable control of the ratio of negatively charged residues by c - terminal truncation probably was useful to enhance salt tolerability .
the increase of negatively charged residues on protein surface may also be responsible for the formation of highly ordered shells of water molecules that prevent denaturation under high alkalinity30 .
effects of truncation on chaotropic agents and detergent tolerability keratinase is a potential protease used in laundry detergents that usually contain high concentrations of surfactants , such as sds , triton x - 100 , tween - 20 , and tween - 802028 .
those surfactants and chaotropic agents have great influence on protein structure .
so enzyme stability in different surfactants and chaotropic agents is an important parameter of commercial enzymes931 .
we investigated the effect of many agents ( urea , sds , triton x - 100 , tween 20 , and tween 80 ) on keratinases .
as shown in fig. 6a,b , enzyme activity was destroyed by increasing concentrations of chaotropic compounds , and the truncation of c - terminal domain further decreased enzyme stability in chaotropic solution .
the variant v415 showed the lowest stability to urea and sds , with a nearly 80 % decline of activity ( fig. 6 ) .
however , the variant v355 obtained significant tolerability to chaotropic compounds , and reserved more than 40 % activity in 4 % ( w / v ) urea or sds .
remarkably , the addition of 1 % ( w / v ) sds to variant v355 improved its enzymatic activity , similar to a surfactant - stable keratinase from streptomyces aureofaciens k1332 .
though site - saturation mutagenesis and recombination of subtilisin e obtained excellent mutants that had 40 - 60 % activity in 4 % ( w / v ) sds3133 , it might be more time - consuming than our c - terminal truncation strategy .
on the contrary , the other surfactants , triton x - 100 , tween - 20 , and tween - 80 , had positive effects on enzymatic activities. from fig. 6c we could learn that the wild type keratinase had the highest enzyme activity ( approximately 120 % activity ) in the presence of those surfactants .
it showed that surfactants had the ability to activate keratinase to catalyze substrate .
in addition , we could also see that c - terminal truncation weakened surfactant tolerability of keratinase ( fig. 6c ) .
the surfactant can break hydrogen bonds or salt bridges to unfold protein33 .
our results showed that the ppc domain probably could strengthen molecular interaction and enhance stability to the surfactant .
structure modeling and analysis of wild type keratinase and mutants from the ncbi blasting results of the protein data bank ( pdb ) database , we found that the kersmd sequence shared the highest identity ( 47 %) with the subtilisin - like proteases ( pdb no .
3lpa , 3lpc , 3lpd , 3ti9 , and 3ti7 ) , a 37 % identity with thermostable serine protease ( pdb no. 1dbi ) , and a 35 % identity with thermitase ( pdb no. 1thm ) .
though the above proteins showed high identity , their structures are all lack of the c - terminal domains except for thermococcus kodakaraensis protease ( pdb no. 3afg , about 25 % identity ) .
so we took them as the reference structures for the modeling work of kersmd .
modelling of the c - terminal domains of kersmd was based on the templates of vep c - ter 100 ( pdb no. 2luw , with 83 % query coverage and 30 % identity ) .
we also did sequence alignment of those reference structures to show their similarity in supplementary materials fig. s1 .
we can see that catalytic domains were highly conserved .
for example , the amino acid sequences from position 110 to 165 , 176 to 188 , and 210 to 240 all showed more than a 5 - point conservative factor .
the c - terminal domain of kersmd ( from position 370 to 480 ) was lower conserved .
so we did the modeling work of c - terminal domain according to 2luw independently .
the structure alignment was conducted by pymol software as shown in supplementary fig. s2 and fig. 7. we found that the kersmd model was highly similar to 3lpa , 3lpc , 3lpd , 3ti9 , 3ti7,1dbi , 1thm , and 3afg .
their carbon backbones showed high conservation because those proteins all have a subtilisin - like catalytic domain ( a catalytic peptidase s8 ) .
the major differences were the unordered loops and the independent ppc domain .
in our former reports23 , we have discussed that the ppc domain and loops may be related to the substrate specificity .
we also aligned the catalytic triangle residues asp , his , and ser ( fig. 7a ) .
the catalytic cleft of the modelled structure was larger than the original references , indicating that kersmd probably tended to hydrolyze macromolecule substrates , such as insoluble keratin .
variants v456 and v355 showed high thermostability and catalytic activity , respectively .
in order to compare the structure changes between the wild type keratinase and variants , we did structure modeling .
the differences in catalytic center were showed in fig. 7b .
since the keratinase kersmd is a serine subtilisin - like protease , its proteolysis also depends on three important amino acids ( asp42 , his105 , and ser289 ) in the catalytic center23 .
we found that the distances between ser289 and his105 in variants v456 and v355 were shorter than the wild type .
in addition , the angle from asp42 to his105 and ser289 was also decreased after the c - terminal truncation , forming a smaller volume for the catalytic center .
to some extent , the shorter distance between his105 and ser289 may accelerate the speed of electron transport in the hydrolysis reaction , which probably improves catalytic activity of v355 on synthetic substrate aapf .
though the c - terminal truncation could increase catalytic activity , it diminished protein stability to high temperatures .
we found that the triangle catalytic center of v355 had more hydrogen bonds than the wild type and v456 .
the v456 with improved thermostability showed the lowest amounts of hydrogen bonds .
the increased amounts of hydrogen bonds may reduce the flexibility of active residual which is important to bind to substrate and provide electron acceptors34 .
we also predicted the surface electrostatic potential around the catalytic center in fig. 7 by chimera 1.9 .
the red was the main color of protein surface , indicating that the catalytic domains of kersmd and its mutants had a negative potential. from the study of the electrostatic potential of the original reference structures ( fig. s3 ) , we also learned that kersmd surface had more negative potential .
it has been reported that negative potential is probably related to detergent tolerability of subtilisin e3133 .
since keratinase kersmd has a similar catalytic domain and center to subtilisin protease , the increase of negative potential can also improve enzyme tolerability to sds or other detergents .
in this work , our mutants v355 showed the significant enhancement of sds tolerability .
except for the negative potential , we inferred that the flexible loop above the catalytic center may also have an important effect on detergent tolerability .
comparing the mutant v355 with the wild type and v456 , we found that the weak negative loop was shifted from left to right ( fig. 7 ) , which possibly protected the catalytic sites against anion agents such as sds .
the active loop was also reported in another protease aprv2 ( protein data bank : 3lpa , 3lpc , and 3lpd ) which needs a special site to bind to the substrate35 .
though the mechanism of sds tolerability of proteases is still unclear , it has been reported that changing the substrate binding ability can improve enzyme adaptability in detergent solution31 .
however , more work should be conducted to prove that inference .
conclusion in summary , a simple technology of protein engineering was introduced to enhance catalytic efficiency , thermophilicity , anti - salt and detergent tolerance of keratinase kersmd .
in this work , we partially truncated the ppc domain of keratinase kersmd according to the distribution of six beta - folds , and several variants were obtained .
the variants v435 , v415 , v395 , v380 , v370 , and v355 showed improved catalytic efficiency to synthetic substrate aapf , and the v355 obtained the highest value ( 143.6 s - 1 mm - 1 ) .
though the truncation resulted in a small decline of keratinolytic activity , the variants v370 and v355 still had high protease activity to hydrolyze casein and feather substrate .
the variant v355 could be potentially used for laundry detergent and leather treatment because of its low collagenase activity , thermophilicity , and high tolerance to alkalinity , salt , chaotropic agents , and detergent .
our work not only provided a simple technology of protein engineering but also complemented the function of the ppc domain of kersmd .

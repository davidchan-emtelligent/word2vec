cognition flow dual process theories divergent thinking convergent thinking insight incubation intuition introduction the concept of flow , an experience of total engagement in an activity , was introduced into psychology by csikszentmihalyi ( 1975 ) based primarily on first - hand accounts in a variety of domains .
he found examples in physical activities such as rock climbing , sports ( where it is also known as being in the zone ) , games such as chess , religious rituals , occupational activities such as surgery , and creating in the arts ( creative flow ) .
csikszentmihalyi ( 1999 ) described the elements of the flow experience this way : the sense of having stepped out of the routines of everyday life into a different reality ( see also schutz , 1945 ) , clear goals every step of the way , immediate feedback , effortless attention , action and awareness merged , balance between skill and challenge , time distortion , and spontaneity .
these properties are cognitive ; they are relevant to the study of problem representation ( newell et al. , 1958 ; pretz et al. , 2003 ) , automatic vs. controlled cognitive processes ( schneider and shiffrin , 1977 ; meier et al. , 2003 ) , time perception ( zakay and block , 1996 ) , and modes of cognition ( evans , 2008 ) .
csikszentmihalyi ( 1999 ) also noted common cognitive contents no longer present ; no distractions such as what smallwood and schooler ( 2006 ) called mind - wandering , no fears of failure ( clark et al. , 1956 ) , none of the usual self - consciousness of everyday life ( schutz , 1945 ) .
csikszentmihalyi also recognized a paradox with respect to control : flow feels effortless with no conscious sense of controlling what emerges , but , given flow 's characteristics , he assumed that " one has to be in control of the activity in order to experience it " ( csikszentmihalyi , 1999 , p. 825 ) .
flow has been a robust subject for research and theorizing ( engeser , 2012 ; harmat et al. , 2016 ) .
the general assumption has been that the features of flow did not differ from one domain to another ( see cseh , 2016 , for an exception ) .
experimental research has been centered on activities that can be easily observed , controlled and varied in the laboratory such as computer gaming .
( see , for example , klasen et al. , 2012 ). that study confirmed the elements of flow as csikszentmihalyi ( 1975 ) first described them .
among the domains for which a flow experience has been described are those in the creative arts - - writing ( perry , 2009 ) , painting ( banfield and burgess , 2013 ) , and musical composition ( csikszentmihalyi , 1975 ) .
evidence is emerging that the flow experienced by those creating in domains of the arts ( creative flow ) , while sharing most of the properties csikszentmihalyi wrote about , also has a few properties that distinguish it from flow in other domains .
interviews with visual artists suggested that in this domain , goals , which are part of problem representations , are not clear ( mace , 1997 ) .
one artist told her , " you really do n't know where you are going " ( p. 274 ) .
in another interview study , cseh ( 2017 ) concluded that clear goals , sense of control , and unambiguous feedback were not typically part of fine artists' flow experiences .
doyle ( 1998 ) noted another feature of creative flow : that what emerges is often surprising to the maker .
one writer told about writing a story about a man who , in the scene being written , was lying in bed with his wife .
as he was speaking of his son , his wife interrupted and said , " is it happening again ... jimmy 's not real " ( doyle , 1998 , p. 33 ) .
the author , who had assumed the son was real , was startled out of flow with the unexpected realization that the son the husband had been speaking of was only his delusion .
furthermore , creative flow involves meaning - making , as csikszentmihalyi 's own interview with a writer suggested .
it 's just an extended present ... in which you are making meaning. and dismantling meaning and remaking it ( csikszentmihalyi , 1996 , p. 121 ) .
the meaning making happens in a rush as the term flow implies .
a composer gave this description when asked how it felt when his work was going well : "... my hand seems devoid of myself , and i have nothing to do with what is happening .
i just sit there watching in a state of awe and wonderment. and the music just flows out by itself . "
( csikszentmihalyi , 1975 , p. 44 ) .
thus , unclear goals , uncertain feedback , the possibility of surprise , and rapid meaning - making are cognitive properties of creative flow along with properties shared with other flow domains : taking place in a reality outside the everyday , effortless attention , action and awareness merged , balance between skill and challenge , time distortion , spontaneity , non - distractibility and no self - consciousness or personal fears .
descriptions of creative flow are based on interviews ; probably for this reason , its features have not been considered in laboratory - based accounts of cognition .
yet , as ward ( 2001 ) proposed , important advances can come from a convergence approach , drawing on both laboratory research and first - hand accounts .
this article looks at the features of creative flow in relation to other cognitive phenomena .
the article argues that this analysis will broaden and complicate understanding of the possibilities of cognition .
the complexities emerge as the properties of creative flow are considered in relation to those of type 1 vs. type 2 cognition ; convergent vs. divergent thinking , incubation and insight , all topics that have been the subject of extensive laboratory research and theorizing .
dual process theories dual process theories of cognition arose in conjunction with studies of reasoning , decision - making , and social cognition .
though different theorists ( smith and decoster , 2000 ; epstein , 2003 ; evans , 2008 ; stanovich , 2009 ; kahneman , 2011 ; strack and deutsch , 2012 ) put forward versions which vary in a few features , there are common threads .
all distinguished between intuitive thinking ( type 1 ) , characterized as fast , automatic , and high capacity , vs. deliberative or reflective thinking which is slow , controlled , and low capacity ( type 2 ) .
evans ( 2014 ) conceptualized the type 2 features as enabling two other properties , hypothetical thinking and cognitive decoupling - keeping representations decoupled from the actual world .
theorists have explored the relation between the thinking types and creative process phases other than flow .
allen and thomas ( 2011 ) investigated their role in problem - finding , conceptualization , incubation , illumination , verification , and dissemination .
they concluded that type 1 thinking is typical of incubation , but that the other phases involve both in some proportion .
similarly , sowden et al .
( 2015 ) , looking at the idea generating and evaluation phases of the creative process , suggested that shifts between type 1 and type 2 thinking are likely in both phases .
creative flow has properties different from the other phases .
rather than exhibiting shifts , it , as a single phenomenon , includes some characteristics from each of the two types .
it is intuitive and comes quickly ( type 1 ) .
it is not experienced as controlled ( type 1 ) though csikszentmihalyi proposed it has to be ( type 2 ) .
creative flow is obviously decoupled from the actual world ( type 2 ) , as it takes place in a sphere other than everyday reality ( sessions , 1952 ; doyle , 1998 ; csikszentmihalyi , 1999 ) .
convergent and divergent thinking convergent thinking is typically defined as cognition which moves toward a single correct answer whereas in divergent thinking cognition moves in multiple directions making new , original possibilities more likely - - the reason measures of it are often used to assess creativity .
research has shown that the more original associations happen late in the associative stream after the first more conventional associations come to mind ( mednick , 1962 ; milgram and rabkin , 1980 ) .
divergent thinking has been linked to defocusing ( gabora , 2010 ) , with associative rather than rule - governed processes ( gabora , 2010 ; goldschmidt , 2016 ) , and cortical hypofrontality ( yoruk and runco , 2014 ) .
like divergent thinking , creative flow results in something new and original and has been associated with hypofrontality ( dietrich , 2004 ; limb and braun , 2008 ) , yet unlike divergent thinking , the originality comes quickly , and a meaningful , rule - governed structure emerges .
like convergent thinking , creative flow is focused , with distractions inhibited , involves rule - governed processes , and moves toward fulfillment of creative intentions .
insight and incubation in the realm of problem solving , creative flow shares properties with both the insight and incubation phases .
insight has often been described as following a period of preparation and facilitated by a period of incubation ( sio and ormerod , 2009 ) including mind - wandering from an intentioned task ( baird et al. , 2012 ) .
topolinski and reber ( 2010 ) described insight 's features : ideas come suddenly - - " pop into the mind , abruptly and unexpectedly " ( p .
402 ) , and bring ease of processing after the solution is found .
creative flow shares the feature of coming to mind rather than found through effort , and may be surprising , but rather than a single idea which solves or restructures a prior problem , flow unfolds over time .
the ease of processing is part of the emerging creation , not a process subsequent to it. the content of insight is typically an idea ; creative flow typically comes embodied - - the composer is at the keyboard ; the painter , at the easel ; the writer , at the computer or with pen in hand ( see , for example , banfield and burgess , 2013 ) .
as csikszentmihalyi ( 1999 ) wrote , idea , and action are fused .
like incubation , flow often follows intentional preparation and is effortless - - allowing the mind to go where it will without the control of executive functions .
in incubation , the mind wanders away from the prior intentioned problem and is often referred to as task unrelated thought ( smallwood and schooler , 2006 ) ; creative flow is focused on the prior problem - - the unfulfilled creative intention .
yet flow results in something new , possibly unexpected , pointing to global access , a feature that has been suggested as one possible explanation for incubation ( sio and ormerod , 2009 ) .
flow may happen anywhere in the sequence of phases of the creative process ( doyle , 2016 ) .
it may follow seamlessly after a period of effort or follow incubation .
in other cases flow may be triggered by an insight - - such as the idea of a new character coming to the writer , but the insight does not solve a problem ; rather it gives a new direction to the subsequent flow rather than determining its course .
in other cases , the intuitive flow itself leads to insight , the artist realizing the structure underlying the flow only on reflection afterward .
for example , one writer told of writing a paragraph carried along by its rhythm and only in reflection realizing that it contained what was to be a major theme of the novel ( doyle , 1998 ) .
a similar phenomenon has been described in the classic problem solving literature ; anzai and simon ( 1979 ) reported that , given the tower of hanoi problem , some subjects realized the pattern needed for solution only after carrying it out .
individual flow and group improvisation the flow experienced by an individual artist shares properties with another creative activity - - group improvisation as in theater or in jazz ( sawyer , 2003 ) .
its properties include contingency - - each participant 's contribution triggering the next participant 's response - - and modifiability - - subsequent events may change the meaning of what came before ( sawyer and dezutter , 2009 ) .
here , rather than the contingent actions involving several people , a single artist 's brush strokes ( shahn , 1957 ) , sentences ( doyle , 1998 ) , or musical phrases ( csikszentmihalyi , 1975 ) are spontaneous responses to what came before .
ideally , what emerges in both creative flow and group improvisation has an underlying meaningful structure .
implications thinking in creative flow moves toward organization and meaning intuitively .
this provides another clear example of a growing body of research ( dorfman et al. , 1996 ; betsch and glockner , 2010 ; newman et al. , 2017 ) demonstrating fast , intuitive thinking may be complex and organized .
in creative flow , the pattern weaving , meaning - making , global reaching , integration seeking tendencies of the mind take place without conscious control , yet are in the service of an initial and yet unrealized creative intention .
creative flow shares some properties with both type 1 and type 2 cognition , both convergent and divergent thinking , with insight and incubation , but flow also has properties that distinguish it from each of these .
though flow is often only one phase of an extended creative process in which other phases have other properties , its unique features should be taken into account for a fuller understanding of the range of possibilities in the domain of cognition .

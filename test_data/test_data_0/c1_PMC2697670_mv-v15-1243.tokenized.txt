purpose cannabinoid receptors have been detected in neuron cells and proposed as potential therapeutic agents in neurodegenerative disorders because of their involvement in controlling neural cell survival and death .
however , their presence and role in human retinal pigment epithelial ( rpe ) cells , which play a key role in initiating and developing age related macular degeneration ( armd ) , have never been investigated .
here we analyzed the expression of and changes in cannabinoid receptors ( cb1 and cb2 ) and one enzyme responsible for endocannabinoid hydrolysis , fatty acid amide hydrolase ( faah ) , in rpe cell oxidative damage process , a cellular model of armd .
methods primary human rpe cells and cells from the arpe - 19 cell line were cultured and exposed to h2o2 for 24 h to induce oxidative damage .
real time rt - pcr , immunofluorescent staining , and western blot methods were performed to study the expression of and changes in cb1 and cb2 receptors , and faah .
cell viability and reactive oxygen species ( ros ) production were measured by using 3 - ( 4,5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2,5 - diphenyl tetrazolium bromide ( mtt ) and a dichlorofluorescein ( dcf ) assay , respectively .
pi3k / akt and erk1 / 2 protein expression and activation of signaling molecules were assessed by western blot analysis .
results by using real time rt - pcr , immunofluorescent staining and western blot methods , we showed that human rpe cells express cb1 , cb2 , and faah .
meanwhile , oxidative stress can upregulate cb1 and cb2 receptor expression , and downregulate faah expression .
the cb1 / cb2 receptor agonist , cp55,940 , and the cb2 receptor agonist , jwh015 significantly protected rpe cells from oxidative damage .
in addition , cp55,940 significantly reduced the levels of intracellular ros , strengthened oxidative stress - induced activation of pi3k / akt and reduced activation of the erk1 / 2 signal pathway .
conclusions the results demonstrate the expression and regulation of cb1 and cb2 receptors and faah in human rpe cells .
the modulation of cannabinoid receptor tone warrants consideration for future therapeutic strategies of armd .
galleystatusexport to xmlcorr - authorwang introduction the endocannabinoid system ( ecs ) , a new intercellular communication network , has been shown to play a crucial role in neurodegenerative disorders' pathogenesis [ 1,2 ] .
the ecs consists of the following : the cannabinoid receptors , which include cannabinoid receptor 1 ( cb1 )/ cb2 receptors and non - cb1 / cb2 receptors ; the endogenous ligands , primarily anandamide ( aea ) and 2 - arachidonylglycerol ( 2 - ag ) ; the enzymes responsible for the endogenous ligands' degradation , notably fatty acid amide hydrolase ( faah ) , and biosynthesis ; and the specific uptake mechanisms [ 3 ] .
both cannabinoid receptors subtypes , cb1 and cb2 , are abundantly expressed in neurons and can protect neurons from oxidative damage [ 4 ] .
cannabinoid receptor induction of neuroprotection has been observed in animal models of some neurodegenerative disorders , including alzheimer disease [ 5 ] , huntington 's disease [ 6 ] , multiple sclerosis [ 7 ] , and parkinson disease [ 8 ] .
however , the presence and regulation of cannabinoid receptors in retinal neurodegenerative disorders have been studied far less than those in brain and other organ systems .
age - related macular degeneration ( armd ) is a late - onset neurodegenerative retinal disease , which predominates in the elderly as a cause of irreversible and profound vision loss [ 9 ] .
armd shares many common clinical and pathogenetic properties with other neurodegenerative disorders .
currently , there is no ideal therapy to prevent or cure armd .
intake of antioxidants is the only established treatment for those with the atrophic or " dry " form of armd [ 10 ] .
although treatment options for those with the neovascular or " wet " form have increased recently , even these treatments are largely ineffective for reversing existing visual impairment [ 11 ] .
thus , the development of strategies for preventing armd assumes great importance ; and new treatment approaches should focus on the initial insults that lead to the disease 's progression .
armd initial pathogenesis includes degeneration , dysfunction , or loss of rpe cells caused by oxidative injury [ 12 ] .
previous studies have demonstrated the presence of endocannabinoids ( aea and 2 - ag ) in retinas by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry [ 13 - 15 ] .
cb1 receptor , a cannabinoid receptor enriched in neuronal tissue , was localized in the inner and outer plexiform layers of a human retina [ 16 ] .
unlike cb1 receptor , cb2 receptor and faah were undetectable in the human retina , but were found in rat retina , mostly in the ganglion cells and in the soma of dopamine amacrine cells and large cells [ 17,18 ] .
the function of ecs in the eye , in addition to regulating photoreception and neurotransmission in the retina , and the effects on intraocular pressure and ocular blood vessels [ 19 - 24 ] , also encompasses neuroprotective effects against retinal neurotoxicity [ 25,26 ] .
this background suggests a functional ecs in the retina .
eyes of patients with armd have been show increase levels of endocannabinoids ( aea ) in their retina [ 27 ] .
therefore , we hypothesized that ecs , acting as a novel signaling system in the retina , may play a substantive role in the armd pathophysiological process .
because most effects of endocannabinoids are mediated by binding to cannabinoid receptors and terminated by degradation enzyme faah [ 28 ] .
thus , the present study aims to examine the expression of cb1 and cb2 receptors , and faah in human rpe cells , and their changes in oxidative stress conditions , using a cellular model of armd [ 29 ] .
our findings may set the basis for the potential pharmacological modulation of cannabinoid receptor tone as a novel therapeutic target in armd .
methods primary human rpe cells and arpe - 19 cell line culture human rpe cells were obtained from eye bank donor eyes , which were cut across the posterior pole , and the vitreous and neural retina were removed .
eyes were obtained from three male human donors between 30 and 50 years of age .
none of the donors had a known history of eye disease .
the eyes at time of receipt were all integral .
rpe cells were isolated within 4 to 16 h after death.the remaining eyecup was washed with phosphate buffered saline ( pbs , 8.00 g nacl , 0.20 g kcl , 0.24 g kh2po4 and 1.44 g na2hpo4 in 1 l distilled water , ph 7.4 ) and incubated with 0.025 % trypsin - ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid ( edta ; invitrogen - gibco , carlsbad , ca ) in a humidified chamber at 37 degreesc .
the cells then were scraped gently and seeded in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ; invitrogen - gibco ) containing 15 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ; invitrogen - gibco ) .
a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ( arpe - 19 ) was purchased from american type culture collection ( atcc ; manassas , va ) .
the cells were maintained in dmem / f12 medium ( invitrogen - gibco ) supplemented with 10 % fbs ( invitrogen - gibco ) and 1 % penicillin and streptomycin , and were cultured at 37 degreesc in a humidified atmosphere of 95 % air and 5 % co2 .
the medium was changed every two days .
the arpe - 19 cells were used within 10 generations .
since cells of lower generations were quite sensitive to oxidative stress .
cell treatment the arpe - 19 cells were seeded in flat - bottomed microculture 96 well plate ( 15,000 cells / well ) and allowed to adhere for 24 h. dose - response assays were performed on the arpe - 19 cells to determine the 50 % inhibiting concentration ( ic50 ) of hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) .
the cells were treated with 0 to 500 mum h2o2 in serum - free and phenol - free dmem - f12 medium for 24 h. the 30 % h2o2 stock solution was used within its three - month expiration limit .
working solutions of h2o2 were made fresh and added to the medium .
cp55,940 ( sigma , st. louis , mo ) is a nonselective cb1 and cb2 cannabinoid receptor agonist .
acea ( tocris bioscience , ellisville , mo ) is a selective cb1 agonist .
jwh015 ( cayman , ann arbor , mi ) is a selective cb2 receptor agonist .
arpe - 19 cells were preincubated with various concentrations of cp55,940 , acea , and jwh015 for 15 min before exposure to 200 mum h2o2 for 24 h in serum - free , phenol - red - free dmem and f12 media at 37 degreesc .
for each concentration of h2o2 and the compounds , five wells were analyzed .
each experiment was performed at least three times .
rna extraction total rna was isolated from primary human rpe cells , arpe - 19 cells and , h2o2 ( 200 mum ) - treated arpe - 19 cells using the rneasy total rna system ( rneasy mini kit , qiagen , valencia , ca ) following the manufacturer 's recommendation , and then treated with rnase - free dnase i to remove any contaminating genomic dna .
the isolated rna had optic density ( od ) 260 / 280 ratios greater than or equal to 2.0 [ 30 ] .
to synthesize a cdna template for pcr , we reverse transcribed 1 mug of total rna with oligo - ( dt ) primer and reverse transcriptase ( revertra ace , toyobo co. , ltd. , osaka , japan ) .
the quality of first - strand cdna was confirmed by pcr with beta - actin primers .
real - time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( real - time rt - pcr ) real - time rt - pcr was performed for quantitative analysis according to the standard protocol using the sybr green pcr master mix ( toyobo co. , ltd. , osaka , japan ) .
pcr conditions for cb1 and cb2 were as follows : after initial denaturation at 95 degreesc for 5 min , 40 cycles were performed at 94 degreesc for 30 s , 58 degreesc for 30 s , and 72 degreesc for 1 min , followed by a 10 min extension at 72 degreesc .
for faah , the conditions were as follows : after initial denaturation at 95 degreesc for 5 min , 40 cycles were performed at 94 degreesc for 30 s , 62 degreesc for 30 s , and 72 degreesc for 1 min , followed by a 10 min extension at 72 degreesc .
primers used were shown in table 1 .
quantification analysis of cb1 , cb2 , and faah mrna was normalized with beta - actin as reference .
the specificity of pcr amplification products was checked by performing a dissociation melting curve analysis .
relative multiples of changes in mrna expression were determined with the relative comparative threshold ( ct ) method .

in brief , arpe - 19 cells were grown to confluence in chamber slides ( nalgene - nunc , lab - tek , naperville , il ) .
the growth medium was aspirated and the cells were washed three times with pbs , and then fixed with 4.0 % paraformaldehye for 20 min at 4 degreesc .
after the cells had been washed with pbs , they were permeabilized with 0.2 % triton x - 100 in pbs for 15 min at room temperature .
subsequently , cb1 and cb2 expression in the arpe - 19 cells was determined by immunofluorescent staining using a 1:100 dilution of anti - cb1 ( rabbit polyclonal , abcam , cambridge , uk ) or anti - cb2 ( rabbit polyclonal , abcam ) , respectively , for 6 h at 4 degreesc .
after the cells had been rinsed with pbs , they were probed with 1:250 goat anti - rabbit fitc ( pierce , rockford , il ) for 1 h at room temperature .
their nucleus was counterstained with 4 ' , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( molecular probes , invitrogen - gibco , carlsbad , ca ) .
images were obtained with a fluorescent microscope ( olympus ix 81 ) at 20x objective with 1.5x optical zoom ( olympus ix 81 , olympus optical , tokyo , japan ) .
mtt assay for cell viability an 3 - [ 4,5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ] - 2,5 - diphenyl tetrazolium bromide ( mtt ) assay is a qualitative index of cell viability .
mitochondrial and cytosolic dehydrogenases of living cells reduce the yellow tetrazolium salt ( mtt ) to produce a purple formazan dye that can be detected spectrophotometrically [ 31 ] .
after arpe - 19 cells were preincubated with various concentrations of cp55,940 , acea , and jwh015 for 15 min followed by exposure to 200 mum h2o2 for 24 h. then , mtt ( sigma , st. louis , mo ) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg / ml and incubated for 4 h at 37 degreesc .
the culture medium was then removed and the remaining blue precipitate was solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide , followed by reading absorbance at 570 nm in a plate reader using 630 nm as a reference ( spectra max 340 ; molecular devices , sunnyvale , ca ) .
this reading was divided by the adjusted absorbance reading of untreated cells in control wells to obtain the percentage of cellular survival .
reactive oxygen species determination the intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ros ) level is an important biomarker for oxidative stress .
an increased ros level generally indicates increased oxidative stress .
relative ros production was determined by the formation of a fluorescent dichlorofluorescein ( dcf ) compound on oxidation of the nonfluorescent , reduced dcf - da [ 32 ] .
cells were incubated with 10 mum dcf - da at 37 degreesc for 30 min , and then washed twice with pbs .
relative fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence plate reader at 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission wavelength ( wallace , perkin - elmer , warrington , uk ) .
western blot analysis we plated the arpe - 19 cells into six - well plates ( 150,000 cells / ml ) .
to evaluate the expression of cb1 and cb2 receptors and faah , we treated the cells with 200 mum h2o2 in serum - free and phenol - free dmem and f12 medium for 24 h. as for the expression of pi3k / akt and erk1 / 2 protein , the cells were pretreated with or without 1 mum cp55,940 for 15 min and then exposed to 200 mum h2o2 for 24 h. after the treatment , the cells were rinsed twice with ice - cold pbs , then scraped into cell lysis buffer and centrifuged at 13400x g for 10 min at 4 degreesc .
protein levels were determined using the bicinchoninic acid ( bca ) protein assay ( pierce ) .
next , 15 mug of total protein were solubilized in 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) sample buffer , separated on 10 % sds - polyacrylamide gel by electrophoresis ( sds - page ) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting .
the blots were washed in tris - buffered saline containing 0.1 % tween - 20 and 5 % nonfat dairy milk , and incubated in antibodies to 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal cb1 and cb2 receptors antibodies ( abcam ) , 1:1,000 dilution of mouse polyclonal faah antibody ( abcam ) , 1:3,000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal pi3k / akt and erk1 / 2 antibodies ( cell signaling technology , beverly , ma ) , and 1:10,000 dilution of mouse monoclonal gapdh antibody ( cell signaling technology ) at 4 degreesc overnight .
blots were washed three times , incubated with 1:3,000 horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) - conjugated goat anti - rabbit igg ( pierce ) or 1:20,000 hrp - conjugated goat anti - mouse igg ( pierce ) and developed using chemiluminescence ( supersignal west pico luminescent ; pierce ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
statistical analysis data were presented as the mean +/ - standard error of the mean ( sem ) of the results of two or three separate experiments , as specified in the figure legends .
data were analyzed using anova or a student 's t - test with the spss software .
a p - value < 0.05 was considered significant .
results effect of h2o2 on arpe - 19 cell viability the mtt assay for cell viability was used to quantify the arpe - 19 cell cytotoxic response to h2o2 .
h2o2 produced a progressive , cytotoxic effect in the arpe - 19 cells , beginning at a dose of 100 mum , with 5.7 % cytotoxicity and reaching a maximum toxicity at 77.5 % damaged cells measured at 500 mum after 24 h of incubation ( p < 0.05 ; figure 1 ) .
the results indicate that treating arpe - 19 cells with h2o2 for 24 h caused a dose - dependent decrease in their viability with the half maximal inhibitory concentration ( ic50 ) of 200 mum .

consistent with the results of rt - pcr , cb1 and cb2 protein expression increased and faah protein expression decreased in 200 mum h2o2 - treated arpe - 19 cells ( figure 2c ) .

cp55,940 enhanced h2o2 - induced activation of pi3k / akt and reduced activation of erk1 / 2 to address the potential role of pi3k / akt in mediating cp55,940 protection of arpe - 19 cells from oxidative injury , we assessed phosphorylation of pi3k / akt by western blot analysis .
the results showed that pi3k / akt is activated by h2o2 .

arpe - 19 cells were pretreated with the selective inhibitor for erk1 / 2 before exposure to h2o2 , and cell viability levels were determined .
viability levels increased significantly in the presence of 20 mum u0126 ( figure 4c ) .
because of that , their phosphorylated erk1 / 2 ( p - erk1 / 2 ) level was examined by western blot analysis , which showed that erk1 / 2 was activated by h2o2 ; pretreating arpe - 19 cells with cp55,940 reduced p - erk1 / 2 activity , compared to cells treated with h2o2 alone ( figure 4a ) .

discussion to the best of our knowledge , this is the first demonstration of the presence of cb1 , cb2 , and faah in human rpe cells , which play a key role in armd initiation and development .
plenty of evidence in the previous literature suggests that oxidative stress is a contributing factor to rpe dysfunction in armd [ 33 ] .
the results led us to further analyze the cannabinoid receptors and faah expression changes in rpe cells induced by oxidative stress .
most studies have used human rpe cells as the in vitro study model of armd , either primary or cell line .
one of the drawbacks of using primary rpe cells is that it provides a limited number of cells and may lack a consistent cellular background .
the arpe - 19 cell line overcomes this problem while maintaining the morphological and functional characteristics of primary cells .
in addition , arpe - 19 cells respond to oxidative stress ( h2o2 , media starvation , etc. ) in a fashion similar to that of primary cultured human rpe cells .
therefore , we have used the arpe - 19 cell line for most of our studies .
h2o2 added to the culture medium was used as a chemical oxidant .
this agent is convenient and biologically relevant , especially for the rpe cells .
h2o2 has been found in ocular tissues in vivo [ 34 ] and can be produced by the rpe cells as a reactive oxygen intermediate during photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis [ 35 ] .
for these reasons , we selected h2o2 for our studies and performed a series of dose response assays to determine the working concentration that led to a consistent and reliable cytotoxicity. by using real - time rt - pcr and the western blot method , we showed that oxidative stress can upregulate cb1 and cb2 receptor expression and downregulate faah expression in a cell model of armd .
these results agree with a previous comparative analytical study , which showed that endocannabinoids ( aea ) increased in the retina from human armd eyes [ 27 ] .
as a lipid soluble substance , aea cannot be stored in vesicles ; and therefore it is synthesized on demand and travels , in a retrograde direction , across the postsynaptic membrane to the presynaptic membrane , where it activates presynaptic cb1 and cb2 receptors [ 36 ] .
after cellular uptake , aea is degraded via the enzyme faah [ 14 ] .
variation of ecs also can be observed in other neurodegenerative disorders , such as parkinson disease , alzheimer disease , and multiple sclerosis [ 2,37,38 ] .
the variation of ecs may be an endogenous response to maintain endocannabinoid homeostasis and regulate the pathologic function of neuron cells [ 39,40 ] .
in line with the endocannabinoid homeostasis theory , there are now several examples of the successful use of ecs - directed drugs used to alleviate the clinical symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases in animal models [ 2,41,42 ] .
these results suggest that cannabinoid receptors may be potential targets for therapeutic interventions for armd .
we also introduced cp55,940 , which is a nonselective cb1 / cb2 receptor agonist in oxidative stress - induced rpe cellular damage .
we found that cp55,940 protected arpe - 19 cells from oxidative stress - induced cell damage and intracellular ros generation in a dose - dependent way with excellent efficacy .
we further explored whether cp55,940 induced cytoprotective signaling pathways while rescuing rpe cells from oxidative damage .
the pi3k / akt - and erk1 / 2 - mediated survival signal pathways had been suggested to protect rpe cells from oxidative stress [ 43,44 ] .
we therefore addressed whether cp55,940 could modulate pi3k / akt and erk1 / 2 pathways , and found that cp55,940 could enhance h2o2 - induced activation of pi3k / akt and reduce the activation of the erk1 / 2 pathway .
we further investigated whether the selective activation of cb1 or cb2 receptor could protect rpe cells from oxidative stress induced damage .
we used a cell viability assay to determine viability in cells treated with h2o2 .
we demonstrated that cb2 receptor agonist , but not cb1 receptor agonist , significantly protected human rpe cells from oxidative stress .
several studies have shown cb1 receptor activation to mediate neuroprotection , but this is not a universal finding [ 45,46 ] .
this neuroprotective effect could be related to different cell types and pathological conditions .
in conclusion , we demonstrated the expression of cb1 and cb2 receptors and faah in human rpe cells , and their changes in oxidative stress conditions .
the rpe cells perform vital functions for safeguarding photoreceptor cells against oxidative stress and are involved in the pathogenesis of armd [ 47 ] .
these findings open up the attractive possibility that a correlation exists between endocannabinoid homeostasis and the onset of armd .
however , as we observe inhibition , rather than the more usual stimulation , of erk signaling , the involvement of receptors other than cb1 as well as cb2 in the effects of cp55,940 or jwh015 cannot be excluded .
more studies using sirna or specific cb1 and cb2 receptor antagonists should be performed to examine whether manipulating the levels of cannabinoid receptors could be a novel pharmacological approach to treat armd in the future .

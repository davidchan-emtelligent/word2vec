background human cytomegalovirus ( hcmv ) is a betaherpesvirus that causes severe disease in situations where the immune system is immature or compromised .
hcmv immediate early ( ie ) gene expression is stimulated by the virion phosphoprotein pp71 , encoded by open reading frame ( orf ) ul82 , and this transactivation activity is important for the efficient initiation of viral replication .
it is currently recognized that pp71 acts to overcome cellular intrinsic defences that otherwise block viral ie gene expression , and that interactions of pp71 with the cell proteins daxx and atrx are important for this function .
a further property of pp71 is the ability to enable prolonged gene expression from quiescent herpes simplex virus type 1 ( hsv - 1 ) genomes .
non - human primate cytomegaloviruses encode homologs of pp71 , but there is currently no published information that addresses their effects on gene expression and modes of action .
results the ul82 homolog encoded by simian cytomegalovirus ( scmv ) , strain colburn , was identified and cloned .
this orf , named s82 , was cloned into an hsv - 1 vector , as were those from baboon , rhesus monkey and chimpanzee cytomegaloviruses .
the use of an hsv - 1 vector enabled expression of the ul82 homologs in a range of cell types , and permitted investigation of their abilities to direct prolonged gene expression from quiescent genomes .
the results show that all ul82 homologs activate gene expression , and that neither host cell type nor promoter target sequence has major effects on these activities .
surprisingly , the ul82 proteins specified by non - human primate cytomegaloviruses , unlike pp71 , did not direct long term expression from quiescent hsv - 1 genomes .
in addition , significant differences were observed in the intranuclear localization of the ul82 homologs , and in their effects on daxx .
strikingly , s82 mediated the release of daxx from nuclear domain 10 substructures much more rapidly than pp71 or the other proteins tested .
all ul82 homologs stimulated the early release of atrx from nuclear domain 10 .
conclusion all of the ul82 homolog proteins analysed activated gene expression , but surprising differences in other aspects of their properties were revealed .
the results provide new information on early events in infection with cytomegaloviruses .
background human cytomegalovirus ( hcmv ) is an important human pathogen that causes fetal damage and organ transplant rejection , and additionally represents a serious problem in immunocompromised individuals such as aids patients .
the predicted 165 hcmv - encoded genes are expressed in a regulated program in which immediate early ( ie ) proteins are produced prior to early and late gene products .
a complex promoter / enhancer element , the major immediate early promoter ( miep ) , controls transcription of the most abundantly expressed ie locus , while the two major proteins specified by this locus modulate all classes of viral gene expression through positive and negative mechanisms .
proteins that enter the cell as components of the infecting particle provide an additional level of transcriptional regulation , and one of the most extensively studied of these , the tegument phosphoprotein pp71 ( encoded by hcmv gene ul82 ) activates expression from the miep in a variety of assay systems [ 1 - 5 ] .
hcmv mutants lacking the ul82 coding region are impaired for viral gene expression , especially after infection at low multiplicity , demonstrating that pp71 is important for virus replication in permissive cells [ 6,7 ] .
it has recently become clear that pp71 exerts its positive effect on ie gene expression by counteracting an intrinsic antiviral defence that is dependent on the cell protein daxx .
this protein is found in the cytoplasm , where it regulates apoptosis [ 8,9 ] , and also in nuclear structures known as nuclear domain 10 ( nd10 ) [ 10 - 12 ] .
within the nucleus , daxx functions as a repressor of gene expression , primarily by localizing chromatin - associated inhibitory factors , such as histone deacetylases , to relevant promoter regions [ 13 - 15 ] .
upon hcmv infection , pp71 migrates to the nucleus where it localizes to nd10 by binding to daxx [ 4,16 ] .
the outcome of this interaction is the neutralization of repression by daxx and consequent efficient transcription of viral ie genes [ 15,17 - 20 ] .
recent studies indicate that pp71 stimulates the release of atrx , a cell protein with chromatin remodelling activity , from nd10 in a very early event after infection , suggesting that atrx is an important component of the cellular intrinsic defences to hcmv [ 21 ] .
many studies have determined the activity of pp71 by transfection of plasmids encoding the protein together with a reporter plasmid [ 1,2,22,23 ] .
as an alternative method , we have used herpes simplex virus type 1 ( hsv - 1 ) mutants as vectors to enable expression of pp71 .
the basic vector , in1312 , has mutations that inactivate the transcriptional functions of three crucial hsv - 1 proteins .
the changes are an insertion in the coding region of the virion component vp16 , deletion of the ring domain of the ie protein icp0 and introduction of a temperature sensitive mutation in the essential transactivator icp4 .
as a consequence of these mutations , in1312 is impaired for transcription of its own genome and can be used as a vector for the expression of transgenes in a range of cell types that are permissive for hsv - 1 .
infection with in1312 derivatives that express pp71 is an efficient means of introducing the protein into cells .
the activity of pp71 can be assayed by superinfection with a second in1312 derivative that contains a reporter gene , usually e. coli lacz , controlled by various promoters .
this system has been used to demonstrate that pp71 activates expression from a range of viral and cellular promoters in human , monkey and mouse cell lines , and also in mouse neurons in vivo [ 3,5 ] .
further experiments with in1312 derivatives that express both beta - galactosidase and pp71 revealed an additional property of pp71 , namely that it counteracts repression of the hsv - 1 genome .
after infection of human fibroblasts , in1312 is competent for transcription for only a few hours , after which it becomes repressed by cellular mechanisms .
once repressed , the genome remains in a stable ' quiescent ' state for more than 12 days in cell cultures .
if the infecting in1312 derivative expresses pp71 , however , a gradual reversal of the quiescent state is observed , signified by production of beta - galactosidase many days after initial infection in cultures maintained at 38.5degreesc , and by resumption of virus replication in cultures downshifted to 32degreesc to reverse the temperature sensitive defect of icp4 [ 24 ] .
although pp71 has been studied extensively , there have been few reports that address the functional activities of homologs encoded by other cytomegaloviruses , and none that describe the properties of ul82 homologs specified by non - human primate cytomegaloviruses .
in murine cytomegalovirus ( mcmv ) , three open reading frames ( orfs ) in the ' ul82 family ' ( m82 , m83 and m84 ) exist where there are only two in the case of hcmv ( ul82 and ul83 ) , and it has been suggested that gene duplication resulted in an mcmv ul82 - like ancestor that gave rise to both m82 and m83 [ 25 ] .
mcmv mutants lacking m83 replicated normally in tissue culture , suggesting that m83 is not an activator of ie gene expression [ 26 ] .
further studies concluded that neither m82 nor m83 interacts with daxx , and therefore it is unclear whether mcmv encodes a virion protein that is functionally analogous to pp71 [ 27 ] .
the ul82 homolog encoded by guinea pig cytomegalovirus ( gpcmv ) stimulated the transfection efficiency of gpcmv dna and complemented the replication of a hsv - 1 vp16 mutant .
furthermore , a gpcmv ul82 - null mutant was impaired for replication in culture .
taken together , these observations imply that the gpcmv ul82 gene product is , like pp71 , an activator of gene expression [ 28,29 ] .
in the studies presented here , we compared the properties of pp71 with homologs encoded by non - human primate cytomegaloviruses in three ways .
the ability to function as activators of gene expression was tested , the capacity to overcome repression of hsv - 1 genomes was investigated , and the intranuclear distributions of the proteins , were determined .
the results reveal that , despite the overall similarity of the ul82 homologs , there are surprising differences in their properties .
results experiments were initially carried out to identify and clone the simian cmv ( scmv ) homolog of pp71. through a process of ' chromosome walking ' , an orf at the appropriate genome location was identified and sequenced [ genbank : fj610688 ] .
the predicted amino acid sequence was closely similar to that of pp71 , and the gene was named s82 .
the sequence was confirmed in a project to determine the entire nucleotide sequence of scmv ( a. dolan , personal communication ) .
an evolutionary tree was constructed to include the primate ul82 homologs , together with the rat cmv ul82 homolog and mcmv m82 orf ( fig. 1 ) .
s82 was most closely related to the baboon cmv ( bcmv ) protein b82 , and these two sequences plus the rhesus cmv ( rhcmv ) protein rh82 formed a branch separate from that which included the chimpanzee cmv ( chcmv ) protein ul82 and hcmv pp71 .
the relationships between the proteins , apart from s82 , are as published previously [ 28 ] .
as expected , in view of its close similarity to other primate homologs , s82 contained sequence motifs thought to be functionally important , including two daxx - interaction domains [ 4,7 ] , a retinoblastoma protein binding motif [ 30,31 ] and , as reported previously , an internal region named the dutpase - related domain [ 32 ] .
figure 1 phylogenetic tree showing the relationships of ul82 homologs .
a neighbour - joining tree was derived from the aligned amino acid sequences , and midpoint rooted .
to investigate the functional activity of s82 , an n - terminal yfp tag was fused to the orf and the hybrid construct , controlled by the hcmv miep , cloned into the hsv - 1 mutant in1312 ( table 1 ) .
the resulting virus , in1305 , was compared with in1316 , an analogous recombinant that expresses yfppp71 instead of yfps82 [ 24 ] , using a functional assay described previously [ 3,5 ] .
cells were infected with in1305 or in1316 , and after incubation for 3 h , superinfected with a second in1312 derivative containing the e. coli lacz coding region controlled by various promoters , as a reporter virus .
cultures were harvested after a further 5 h and beta - galactosidase assays performed .
to investigate possible cell type or promoter specificity , the experiments were performed in human ( hfff2 ) , african green monkey ( vero ) or mouse ( 3t3 ) cells , with a range of promoters driving beta - galactosidase expression in the reporter virus ( table 2 ) .

monolayers were mock infected or infected with in1372 ( a control virus that expresses cre recombinase ) , in1316 ( expresses pp71 ) or in1305 ( expresses s82 ) at moi 2 , incubated at 38.5degreesc for 3 h , and infected with a second reporter virus ( moi 0.5 ) that contained the lacz coding region controled by the hcmv miep ( in1382 ) , the scmv miep ( in1357 ) or the hsv - 1 icp0 ie promoter ( in1383 ) .
after incubation for a further 5 h at 38.5degreesc , cell extracts were analysed for beta - galactosidase activity .
2. the stimulation of beta - galactosidase expression compared with the value for extracts of cells mock infected prior to infection with the reporter virus .
backgound activity from cells mock infected throughout was subtracted from all values .
the means from at least two independent determinations are presented .
in all cell types tested , preinfection with in1305 resulted in stimulation of beta - galactosidase production , demonstrating that s82 is an activator of gene expression .
the activity of s82 was comparable to that of pp71 in human , african green monkey and mouse cells , irrespective of the promoter in the reporter virus .
there was no preference for the homologous promoter , as preinfection with in1305 resulted in an equivalent stimulation of expression when either the hcmv or the scmv miep elements controlled lacz .
similarly , pp71 expressed by preinfection with in1316 stimulated expression from the hcmv and scmv mieps to similar extents .
in addition , the use of a homologous host cell did not influence the relative degree of stimulation , since in1305 and in1316 exhibited similar activities in hfff2 and vero cells , and indeed the greatest degree of stimulation occurred in 3t3 cells for both viruses .
the experimental approach described above , which relies on dual infection of cells , demonstrates that s82 activated transcription with an activity comparable to that of pp71 .
however , the use of sequential infections in the assay may compromise detection of small differences in activity .
to examine more stringently the activities pp71 and s82 , and to include comparisons with other ul82 - derived proteins , yfp - tagged orfs of pp71 , s82 , ch82 , b82 or rh82 were cloned into the tk region of the hsv - 1 mutant in1374 , to produce recombinant viruses that express both ul82 homolog and beta - galactosidase ( table 1 ) .
infection with these mutants was more appropriate for investigating relatively small differences in activity of the ul82 homologs , since the protein and reporter sequences were delivered to cells on the same genome .
the results reported here , using yfp - tagged proteins , have been reproduced with myc - tagged versions ( not shown ) , confirming , as shown previously , that the yfp moiety does not affect the functional properties of the proteins [ 21,24,33 ] .
the functional activities of the proteins were determined by infecting u373 monolayers at moi 1 or hfff2 at moi 5 and incubation at 38.5degreesc for 10 h , followed by assay of beta - galactosidase and analysis of the amounts of yfp - tagged ul82 homolog synthesized .
preliminary experiments demonstrated that beta - galactosidase production was proportional to input virus up to moi 5 ( results not shown ) .
expression of the ul82 homologs was approximately equivalent for the five recombinants in both cell types ( fig. 2 ) .
expression of beta - galactosidase , however , was 1.5 - 2.5 times greater in cultures expressing s82 , b82 and rh82 than in those expressing pp71 or ch82 ( table 3 ) .
therefore , all primate ul82 homologs activated gene expression , and those derived from scmv , bcmv and rhcmv were more active when introduced into cells by infection with an in1374 - derived recombinant .

monolayers of u373 cells were infected with 1 pfu / cell of in1374 - based recombinants that expressed yfp - tagged ul82 homologs and maintained at 38.5degreesc for 10 h. at this time , extracts were analysed for protein levels , using anti - gfp or anti - actin antibodies as probes .
monolayers were infected with in1374 ( lane 1 ) , in1310 ( lane 2 ) , in0150 ( lane 3 ) , in0145 ( lane 4 ) , in0144 ( lane 5 ) , in0146 ( lane 6 ) or mock infected ( lane 7 ) .
extracts were also analysed for beta - galactosidase activity , as described in table 1 .
we investigated whether the ul82 homologs shared with pp71 the property of directing gene expression for extended periods after infection of human fibroblasts .
cultures of hfff2 cells were infected with in1374 - based recombinants at moi 3 and maintained at 38.5degreesc for 10 days .
after this time , cultures were treated in three ways , following the protocol described previously [ 24 ] .
for one set of cultures , histochemical staining for beta - galactosidase was employed as a direct measure of continued gene expression mediated by the ul82 homolog .
a second set was superinfected overnight with hsv - 1 tsk .
this mutant expresses the ie protein icp0 and therefore reactivates beta - galactosidase expression from cells harboring a quiescent genome , thereby defining the proportion of cells containing one or more quiescent genomes .
the final set was transferred to 32degreesc for 4 days , with human serum in the culture medium , to provide a sensitive test for the presence of genomes that were capable of replication when the temperature sensitive defect of icp4 was reversed .
cultures infected with in1310 , encoding yfppp71 , contained beta - galactosidase expressing cells after incubation at 38.5degreesc for 10 days but positive cells were not detected in cultures infected with recombinants expressing s82 , b82 , ch82 or rh82 ( fig. 3 , top row ) , even though superinfection with tsk resulted in equivalent beta - galactosidase expression in all cultures ( fig. 3 , middle row ) .
upon downshift to 32degreesc , extensive replication , demonstrated by widespread plaque formation , was observed in in1310 - infected cultures , but those infected with viruses encoding the other primate ul82 homologs contained no more than 15 beta - galactosidase positive cells , or small clusters , per monolayer ( fig. 3 , bottom row ) .
these numbers were only marginally greater than those observed in cultures infected with the parental virus in1374 ( not shown ) .
therefore , of the ul82 homologs tested , none exhibited the property of preventing or reversing the repression of hsv - 1 genomes during long term incubation of hfff2 cultures in the manner observed for pp71 .
figure 3 long term expression of beta - galactosidase .
monolayers of hfff2 cells were infected with in1374 - based recombinants ( moi 3 ) and incubated at 38.5degreesc for 10 days in medium containing 2 % fetal calf serum .
monolayers were stained for beta - galactosidase activity on day 10 ( top row ) , after superinfection with tsk on day 10 for 16 h ( middle row ) , or after downshift to 32degreesc on day 10 and futher incubation for 4 days in medium containing 2 % human serum ( bottom row ) .
interaction with the cell protein daxx is important for the role of pp71 in activation of gene expression .
the intranuclear localization of the ul82 homologs was investigated by immunofluorescence after infection of hfff2 cells at moi 0.1 with the in1374 - based recombinants that expressed yfp - tagged ul82 homologs .
monolayers were fixed and co - stained for daxx at 3 h and 7 h post infection ( pi ) .
the patterns of yfp fluorescence were classed as punctate ( in which the signal was exclusively localized to nd10 ) , dispersed ( no distinct foci ) or mixed ( punctate superimposed on a background of dispersed signal ) .
examples of these patterns are shown in figure 4 , and it is noteworthy that the distribution of daxx coincided with that of the yfp signal whereas the major nd10 component , pml , retained a punctate distribution even when the yfp and daxx signals were dispersed .
the effect of the ul82 homologs was therefore to alter the intranuclear localisation of daxx rather than to disrupt nd10 structures totally .
the distributions were quantified by counting several fields from at least two coverslips ( table 4 ) .
as described previously [ 21 ] , at 3 h after infection with in1310 yfppp71 colocalized with daxx at nd10 in virtually all positive cells .
at 7 h pi , again most cells showed a punctate distribution of yfppp71 , although those with greater amounts of protein exhibited a mixed pattern and in a small number yfppp71 was dispersed ( table 4 ) .
the most obvious finding was that s82 exhibited a localization pattern very different from that of pp71 .
even by 3 h pi , s82 was predominantly in a dispersed or mixed distribution with virtually no nuclei containing punctate signal. by 7 h pi , 86 % of s82 - containing nuclei exhibited a dispersed distribution of the protein whereas , by contrast , only 1 % of pp71 - positive profiles were dispersed .
the localizations of the other three homologs , b82 , rh82 and ch82 , were intermediate between those of pp71 and s82 , with mainly punctate appearance at 3 h pi but increased dispersed or mixed distribution at 7 h pi. surprisingly , pp71 was more similar to rh82 than to ch82 in this respect .
figure 4 distribution patterns of ul82 homologs .
monolayers of hfff2 cells were infected with in1374 derivatives expressing yfp - tagged homologs and analysed by immunofluorescence at 3 h or 7 h post infection at 38.5degreesc .
representative images are presented to demonstrate the three distribution patterns that were scored and quantified to produce the data presented in table 4 .

at 3 h pi and 7 h pi , cells were fixed and prepared for immunofluorescence .
distributions of proteins , as shown in figure 4 , were scored for between 95 and 151 yfp - positive nuclei .
it was reported previously that infection with in1316 resulted in the dispersal of atrx at 3 h pi , a time at which yfppp71 and daxx remained at nd10 in a punctate distribution [ 21 ] .
to investigate whether the ul82 homologs also promoted the early dispersal of atrx , nuclei were examined at 3 h pi and 25 yfp positives scored for atrx distribution .
it was clear that expression of all ul82 homologs resulted in dispersal of atrx even though the yfp signal was punctate ( fig. 5 ) , and this was confirmed by quantification ( table 5 ) .
the homologs are therefore similar to pp71 in their abilities to promote the early dispersal of atrx from nd10 .

discussion the cytomegaloviruses are overtly similar in terms of biological properties and coding potential , but differences can be discerned when the viruses are considered in greater detail .
one obvious variation is in overall genome structures , since hcmv and chcmv have inverted repeat sequences that mediate inversion of the unique regions [ 34,35 ] , whereas rhcmv , like mcmv , lacks internal repeats and does not invert [ 36 - 38 ] .
in terms of gene regulation hcmv , scmv and mcmv each utilize a potent , complex enhancer region for transcriptional control of the major ie region , but there are few strong sequence similarities between these regulatory elements [ 39 - 41 ] .
previous studies demonstrated differences between hcmv and scmv ie transcription , with certain cell types that restricted hcmv ie transcription nonetheless permitting full expression of the scmv ie region [ 42,43 ] .
the findings described here suggest that these differences reflect the nature of the ie enhancer regions rather than a cell - type specific actvity of the relevant ul82 homolog .
the results presented here demonstrate that four non - human primate ul82 homologs stimulate transcription in a manner that is generally similar to that of pp71 .
the strong sequence homology suggested that this would be the case , but it should be noted that the predicted mcmv ul82 homolog does not appear to activate gene expression whereas gpcmv ul82 homolog , which lacks many features conserved in the primate proteins , has functional activity [ 25 - 28 ] .
insertion of orfs into the hsv - 1 recombinants in1312 and in1374 provided a useful system for investigating the activities of ul82 homologs , yielding comparative information that would be difficult to obtain by studying the parental cytomegaloviruses themselves .
at a practical level , infection with in1312 derivatives permits delivery of transgenes into cells at constant , relatively low copy numbers whereas transfection results in heterogeneity in the amount of dna delivered to individual cells and hence large variations in gene expression at the individual cell level .
it should be noted , however , that the basic properties of the ul82 homologs reported here were reproduced when plasmids expressing them were introduced into cells by transfection , and that pp71 mutants with known inactivating mutations , such as deletion of the daxx interacting domains [ 4,7 ] , were non - functional when expressed from in1374 - based recombinants ( results not shown ) .
an additional advantage of using in1374 - based recombinants is that the reporter sequences ( encoding beta - galactosidase ) are present in a herpesvirus genome and hence should , to some extent , represent the normal environment of ul82 target promoters .
it was surprising to find that only pp71 was able to direct long term gene expression , in view of the fact that all homologs were functional in the short term assay .
this result suggests that the ability to direct long term expression is a specific feature of pp71 that is distinct from its ability to activate ie transcription .
indeed , this conclusion is supported by our the observation that , to date , six pp71 / ch82 hybrid proteins that we have expressed from plasmid constructs actively stimulated ie gene expression but failed to direct long term expression ( results not shown ) .
the most likely explanation for these findings is that mediating long term expression requires interactions between different domains of the pp71 molecule , and that equivalent regions of ch82 are incompatible .
at present , there is no obvious biological consequence of this unique property of pp71 .
the most notable finding from an analysis of intranuclear distributions of the ul82 homologs was the distinct behaviour of s82 , which exhibited a dispersed distribution and mediated the dissociation of daxx from nd10 at earlier times than the other proteins .
the difference in intranuclear localisation between pp71 and s82 was also observed after infection of african green monkey fibroblasts with in1310 and in0150 , demonstrating that cell type is not a crucial variable ( results not shown ) .
surprisingly , the more rapid dispersal of daxx from nd10 was not reflected in greater functional activity of s82 ; although s82 was approximately twice as active as pp71 in the expression assay , it was similar to b82 and rh82 , which were predominantly nd10 - associated at 3 h and , for rh82 , 7 h pi. the s82 protein was not produced more rapidly than pp71 ( results not shown ) .
all homologs promoted the rapid dissociation of atrx from nd10 , irrespective of the effects on the distribution of daxx , supporting the recent report that the most important effect of pp71 at early times of infection may be dissociation of cellular repressor proteins , such as atrx , from nd10 rather than direct effects on daxx itself [ 21 ] .
conclusion the results presented here reveal surprising dissimilarities in the properties of primate cytomegalovirus ul82 homologs , despite the fact that each of the proteins is a potent transactivator of ie gene expression .
the close relatives , pp71 and ch82 , are slightly lower in transactivation activity than the other three , but ch82 lacks the ability to direct long term expression and is sequestered at nd10 less thoroughly than pp71 .
the functional heterogeneity extends through the ul82 proteins studied here , since s82 is similar in functional activity to b82 and rh82 but strikingly different in its intranuclear localization .
further studies to determine the significance of the differences between ul82 homologs may require investigation of the cytomegaloviruses themselves .
it may also be possible to construct recombinant cytomegaloviruses containing heterologous or hybrid ul82 - encoded proteins , provided there are no problems with incompatibilities for incorporation of the proteins into the virus particle .
materials and methods identification and cloning of s82 , the scmv ul82 homolog dna from scmv ( strain colburn ) was purified from virions released into culture medium and digested with hindiii and ecori .
the mixture was cloned into puc9 that had been digested with hindiii and ecori .
plasmids , from colonies picked at random , were sequenced from their ends , and an isolate containing a 1 kilobase pair ( kbp ) insert homologous to hcmv ul76 was selected .
the insert was used as a probe for colony hybridization to detect a plasmid containing a 7 kbp hindiii / nhei fragment of which one terminus was homologous to hcmv ul80 .
a fragment from this plasmid was used as probe to identify a 5 kbp ecor1 / agei fragment with one end homologous to the coding region of hcmv ul83 and the other homologous to the c - terminus and termination codon of hcmv ul82 , plus 150 bp of downstream sequence .
it was concluded that the ecori / agei fragment contained the entire coding region of the scmv ul82 homolog ( named s82 ) .
further analysis determined that the s82 orf was contained entirely within a 1.9 kbp region defined by noti and sacii sites .
this fragment was cloned between the noti and sacii sites of pbluescript skii and the nucleotide sequence determined .
the s82 orf was isolated by polymerase chain reaction using vent polymerase and primers 5 ' - ggacggctaagcttggatggatcgccctcccgagg and 5 ' - gggccgaattccaggattcgaggtctcgcagtgg , thereby introducing hindiii and ecori sites flanking the 5 ' and 3 ' termini of the orf , respectively .
the hindiii / ecori fragment was cloned between the hindiii and ecori sites of peyfp - c1 to produce plasmid pyfps82 , and the s82 termination codon was regenerated by site - directed mutagenesis to yield pyfps82t11 .
derivation of a phylogenetic tree amino acid sequences were aligned using clustal w [ 44 ] , and locations in the alignment with a gapping character in any sequence were removed .
a phylogenetic tree was constructed from the alignment by the neighbor - joining method , using programs in the phylip package [ 45 ] .
viruses the hsv - 1 mutant in1312 has been described previously [ 46 ] .
derivatives in1374 [ 24 ] and in1382 [ 3 ] , contain hcmv ie - lacz inserted at the ul43 and tk locus , respectively .
derivative in1357 has an insertion consisting of lacz controled by the scmv ie promoter at the tk locus [ 5 ] , and in1383 has the hsv - 1 icp0 promoter controling lacz , inserted at the tk locus of in1312 [ 46 ] .
mutant in1372 expresses cre recombinase in the in1312 background [ 47 ] .
construction of hsv - 1 - derived recombinants that express ul82 homologs to produce hsv - 1 recombinants , ul82 homologs were tagged at the n - terminus with yfp , and the resulting hybrid orfs were cloned into pcp1802 , a transfer vector in which sequences can be inserted , under the control of the hcmv miep and simian virus 40 termination signals , into the hsv - 1 thymidine kinase ( tk ) coding region [ 3 ] .
the resulting plasmids were linearized and cotransfected with dna from in1312 or in1374 .
selection of tk - deficient mutants and analysis by southern hybridization were carried out as described previously [ 48 ] .
the methods used for the individual ul82 orfs are as follows : 1 .
the construction of pyfppp71 , pmj129 ( yfppp71 cloned into the hpai site of pcp1802 ) and recombinant viruses that express yfppp71 ( in1316 , derived from in1312 , and in1310 , derived from in1374 ) have been described previously [ 5,24 ] .
2. the b82 orf was excised as a sali / noti fragment from a plasmid containing the entire orf , and cloned between sali and noti sites of pyfppp71 to replace the pp71 orf with that of b82 .
yfp - tagged b82 was excised as an agei / noti fragment , the ends filled in and cloned into the hpai site of pcp1802 to yield plasmid pmj187 .
3. to clone the rh82 orf , pyfppp71 was first modified by insertion of an oligonucleotide duplex ( top strand 5 ' - ccggaatggatcgccctcccgaggaagaagaagagcccaggccgtctacctctcgag ) between the bspei and ecori sites , thereby replacing the pp71 orf with the n - terminal 17 amino acids of rh82 .
the remainder of the rh82 orf was cloned as an xhoi / drai fragment from a plasmid containing genomic dna encompassing the rh82 orf , between xhoi and smai sites of the modified plasmid .
the yfprh82 coding region was excised as an agei / noti fragment , end - filled and cloned into the hpai site of pcp1802 to yield pmj185 .
4. the ch82 orf was amplified from chcmv dna ( kindly provided by a. davison , mrc virology unit ) , using primers 5 ' - gtctcgatctccttcgcc and 5 ' - ccatgatcacagcagtgg , cloned into pgemt - easy to yield pmj162 .
the insert of this plasmid was sequenced to confirm that there were no changes from the published data [ 35 ] .
plasmid pyfppp71 was modified by insertion of an oligonucleotide duplex ( top strand 5 ' - tcgagctatgtctcgatctccttcgcccggggaagggcccgaacaag ) between xhoi and bamhi sites , thereby replacing the pp71 orf with the n - terminal 11 amino acids of ch82 .
the remainder of the ch82 orf was excised from pmj162 as an apai / spei fragment and cloned between apai and spei sites of the modified plasmid , to yield ptc2 .
the yfpch82 orf was excised from ptc2 by cleavage with agei and spei , end - filled and cloned into the hpai site of pcp1802 to yield ptc9 .
5. to clone yfps82 , an agei / bamhi fragment from pyfps82t11 was filled in and cloned into the hpai site of pcp1802 to yield pjs998 .
to produce recombinant viruses , scai - linearized pmj135 , pmj137 , ptc9 or pjs998 were cotransfected with in1312 or in1374 dna .
acycloguanosine resistant viruses were plaque purified and analysed by southern hybridization for the presence of the transgene in the tk locus .
isolates lacking detectable parental sequences on long autoradiographic exposures were propagated in bhk cells and titrated at 32degreesc on u2os monolayers in the presence of 3 mm hexamethylene bisacetamide [ 49 ] .
the content of functional genomes was assessed by infection of u373 and hfff2 cells at low moi and coinfection overnight at 38.5degreesc with the hsv - 1 mutant tsk , which provides the ie protein icp0 and overcomes repression of genomes , and counting of beta - galactosidase positive cells .
the ' functional genome content ' determined by this method agreed closely with the titres obtained on u2os monolayers , confirming that the preparations contained comparable genome contents .
a summary of the mutants used in this study is presented in table 1 .

background a growing number of arenaviruses can cause a devastating viral hemorrhagic fever ( vhf ) syndrome .
they pose a public health threat as emerging viruses and because of their potential use as bioterror agents .
all of the highly pathogenic new world arenaviruses ( nwa ) phylogenetically segregate into clade b and require maximum biosafety containment facilities for their study .
tacaribe virus ( tcrv ) is a nonpathogenic member of clade b that is closely related to the vhf arenaviruses at the amino acid level .
despite this relatedness , tcrv lacks the ability to antagonize the host interferon ( ifn ) response , which likely contributes to its inability to cause disease in animals other than newborn mice .
methodology / principal findings here we describe a new mouse model based on tcrv challenge of ag129 ifn - alpha / beta and - gamma receptor - deficient mice .
titration of the virus by intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) challenge of ag129 mice resulted in an ld50 of ~ 100 fifty percent cell culture infectious doses .
virus replication was evident in the serum , liver , lung , spleen , and brain 4 - 8 days after inoculation .
my - 24 , an aristeromycin derivative active against tcrv in cell culture at 0.9 microm , administered i.p. once daily for 7 days , offered highly significant ( p < 0.001 ) protection against mortality in the ag129 mouse tcrv infection model , without appreciably reducing viral burden .
in contrast , in a hamster model of arenaviral hemorrhagic fever based on challenge with clade a pichinde arenavirus , my - 24 did not offer significant protection against mortality .
conclusions / significance my - 24 is believed to act as an inhibitor of s - adenosyl - l - homocysteine hydrolase , but our findings suggest that it may ameliorate disease by blunting the effects of the host response that play a role in disease pathogenesis .
the new ag129 mouse tcrv infection model provides a safe and cost - effective means to conduct early - stage pre - clinical evaluations of candidate antiviral therapies that target clade b arenaviruses .
introduction junin and other south american hemorrhagic fever - causing viruses pose a considerable public health threat as emerging infectious disease agents and because of their potential for intentional release [ 1 ] .
all of the highly pathogenic new world arenaviruses ( nwa ; junin , machupo , guanarito , sabia ) , including the recently identified chapare virus , phylogenetically segregate into clade b [ 2 ] , and require maximum biosafety level 4 ( bsl - 4 ) containment facilities for their study .
presently , there are no clade b arenavirus infection models outside of newborn mice suitable for early stage antiviral drug development and proof - of - concept studies .
there are several guinea pig and nonhuman primate models based on infection with authentic bsl - 4 arenaviral hemorrhagic fever agents , but they are not readily available to most researchers [ 3 ] .
moreover , studies in bsl - 4 containment and with larger animal species are cost - prohibitive for use in early pre - clinical drug development .
tacaribe virus ( tcrv ) is a nonpathogenic member of clade b that is ~ 70 % identical to junin virus ( junv ) at the amino acid level [ 4 ] .
however , despite its relatedness to the highly pathogenic nwa , tcrv lacks the ability to antagonize the host interferon ( ifn ) response [ 5 ] , which likely contributes greatly to its inability to cause disease in mature animals .
because of the apathogenicity of tcrv in mice and other rodents , a newborn mouse model was established to evaluate lead antiviral compounds in vivo , primarily with the intent to demonstrate proof - of - concept in a clade b nwa model [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] .
due to the many challenges of working with newborn mice and their underdeveloped cellular and immune response to infectious agents , an alternative model to study clade b arenavirus infection biology and evaluate candidate therapies is needed .
ag129 ifn - alpha / beta and - gamma receptor knockout ( ko ) mice were originally described to have increased susceptibility to severe infection with the prototypical arenavirus , lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ( lcmv ) , as well as vaccinia virus [ 7 ] .
recently , the ag129 mice were used to develop a dengue hemorrhagic fever disease model that manifests vascular leak , thus , more closely resembling the human condition [ 8 ] .
in a study investigating the contributions of type i and ii ifn antiviral responses to sindbis virus infection , wild - type and ifn - gamma receptor ko ( g129 ) mice were found to be resistant to challenge , whereas the ifn - alpha / beta receptor ko ( a129 ) and the double ko ag129 mice succumbed to infection [ 9 ] .
importantly , the ag129 mice produced a lethal viral hemorrhagic fever ( vhf ) - like disease not observed in the sindbis virus - infected a129 mice .
because tcrv does not disrupt ifn production [ 5 ] , the ag129 mice may provide fertile ground for viral replication that culminates in a lethal viscerotropic disease , thereby providing a model that can be used to evaluate antiviral drug candidates for the treatment of acute arenaviral infections .
to date , there are limited options for treating junv infection in cases of argentine hemorrhagic fever .
immune plasma has been reported to be effective at reducing case - fatality rates when administered within a week from the onset of illness [ 10 ] .
in a clinical trial with limited enrollment , ribavirin therapy had an antiviral effect on several measured disease parameters including viral load and delay in time of death in patients who succumbed [ 11 ] .
notably , however , both immune plasma and ribavirin treatments have been associated with neurologic sequelae following the resolution of the acute phase of the disease [ 12 ] .
the use of ribavirin has also been explored in several cases of bolivian hemorrhagic fever [ 13 ] , but larger numbers of patients are needed to convincingly demonstrate efficacy .
finally , in a landmark study wherein ribavirin was used to treat sever cases of lassa fever , significant efficacy was demonstrated [ 14 ] .
notably , however , ribavirin lacks specificity [ 15 ] , is associated with considerable toxicity [ 16 ] , and is not approved by the fda for the indication of treating any form of arenaviral hemorrhagic fever [ 1 ] .
there are several new antiviral drug candidates that have demonstrated efficacy in small animal models of acute nwa infection .
favipiravir ( t - 705 ) has been shown to be highly effective in the hamster pichinde virus ( picv ) model of arenaviral hemorrhagic fever [ 17 ] , and is capable of treating advanced disease [ 18 ] .
presumably , the mode of antiviral action in arenaviruses is through inhibition of the viral polymerase , as has been shown for influenza virus [ 19 ] .
st - 294 , a potent inhibitor of nwa membrane fusion has also demonstrated activity in a newborn mouse tcrv infection model [ 4 ] .
several biologics that enhance the host antiviral response are also being considered .
although lassa fever is thought to be resistant to the effects of type i ifn [ 20 ] , a recent study demonstrated sensitivity of several strains lassa virus to ifn - alpha and - gamma in cell culture [ 21 ] .
moreover , treatment with consensus ifn - alpha , alone or in combination with ribavirin has proven effective in the hamster picv infection model [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
a novel therapy based on the targeting of anionic phospholipids exposed on infected cells and virions has shown promise in studies employing a guinea pig model based on infection with an adapted picv [ 24 ] .
despite the present efforts to develop therapies for the treatment of arenaviral hemorrhagic fevers , most are in the early stages of development , and new classes of inhibitors will most certainly be needed .
carbocyclic nucleosides have provided a foundation for discovering new biological agents , including antivirals [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] .
among this class of compounds , aristeromycin ( figure 1 , 1 ) , which is the naturally occurring carbocylic nucleoside analog of adenosine ( figure 1 , 2 ) [ 27 ] , has been particularly valuable in the search for new antivirals because of its inhibition of host cell s - adenosylhomocysteine hydrolases [ 28 ] , an enzyme that plays a role in metabolic methylations requiring s - adenosylmethionine as enzymatic cofactor [ 29 ] .
however , the potential of aristeromycin is limited by its ready intracellular conversion to the 5 ' - nucleotides that renders it toxic [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] .
as part of a study to circumvent this toxicity , 5 ' - homoaristeromycin ( figure 1 , 3 ) was reported to have activity against vaccinia , cowpox , and monkeypox viruses [ 34 ] .
in the following , we report the details of our synthesis of 5 ' - homoaristeromycin , referred to herein as my - 24 , and its evaluation in a newly developed ag129 mouse tcrv infection model .

junv was amplified in vero cells and the virus stock was prepared from clarified cell culture lysates .
compounds the synthesis of my - 24 has previously been reported in communication form [ 34 ] .
however , the experimental details have not been described .
due to the biological potential of my - 24 , the detailed procedures are provided as supporting methodology ( figure s1 and text s1 ) .
ribavirin was supplied by icn pharmaceuticals , inc .
( costa mesa , ca ) .
for in vivo studies , both my - 24 and ribavirin were dissolved in sterile saline solution and administered by intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injection .
cell culture antiviral assays vero and vero 76 cells were obtained from atcc and maintained in minimal essential medium ( mem ) supplemented with 0.18 % nahco3 and 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ; hyclone thermo scientific , logan , ut ) .
cell cultures in 96 - well microtiter plates were ~ 80 % confluent at time of infection with 5 cell culture 50 % infectious doses ( ccid50 ) of junv , picv , or tcrv prepared in mem containing 2 % fbs .
varying concentrations of my - 24 and ribavirin ( positive control ) solubilized in mem were added to test wells at the time of infection .
to determine cell cytotoxicity , compounds were added to cultures devoid of virus infection .
plates were incubated at 37degreesc , 5 % co2 , until virus - infected mock - treated control wells were observed to have maximal viral cytopathic effect cpe (~ 7 to 8 days ) , at which time cell viability was determined by neutral red ( nr ) dye uptake as previously described [ 17 ] .
the mean effective concentration ( ec50 ) of each compound and the concentration that reduced cell viability by 50 % ( cc50 ) were determined by regression analysis .
virus yield reduction ( vyr ) experiments were conducted to determine the effect of my - 24 on infectious virus .
concentrations of compound that reduce virus yield by 1 log10 ( ec90 ) were determined by regression analysis .
selectivity index ( si ) values were calculated as the cc50 / ec50 for the cpe reduction ( cper ) nr - based assays , and as cc50 / ec90 for the vyr assays .
tcrv ag129 mouse model development and challenge efficacy studies for all studies mice were age and gender matched so that the group compositions would be similar within experiments .
in the initial experiments , weights were not measured to limit handling and exposure of the immunocompromised ag129 mice .
for the titration study , mice in each group were challenged by intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injection with varying ccid50 of tcrv spanning 6 orders of magnitude and observed for 21 days .
because several of the mice continued to appear ill on day 21 , we collected liver , spleen , brain , and serum for virus titer determination , as described below .
a longitudinal analysis of viral titers and alt levels was performed by sorting mice into groups of 3 to 6 animals and challenging them with ~ 200 ccid50 of tcrv .
the mice were observed for 1 to 12 days , and sacrificed on days 1 - 6 , 8 , 10 , and 12 .
the day - 12 group had 6 animals in anticipation of several animals succumbing prior to time of sacrifice .
serum was assayed for viral burden and alt levels .
tissues were collected for liver , lung , spleen , and brain virus titer determination , as described below .
histopathology was also determined at various times during the course of infection .
tissue sections were fixed in formalin and sent to the utah veterinary diagnostic laboratory ( logan , ut ) for histological examination .
in the tcrv challenge my - 24 efficacy experiments , mice were sorted into groups of 10 to 15 animals for drug treatment groups and 15 to 25 for the placebo groups .
my - 24 treatments were administered starting 4 h prior or 1 , 3 or 5 days after challenge with 200 ccid50 of tcrv .
animals were treated i.p. once daily for 7 days with 25 to 150 mg / kg / day of my - 24 , 50 mg / kg / day ribavirin , or saline placebo .
in one of the experiments , 5 mice from each group were sacrificed on day 8 of infection .
serum , liver , lung , spleen , and brain samples were collected for assaying virus titers as described below .
the mice were observed for 3 to 4 weeks for signs of morbidity and mortality .
three to six sham - infected mice were included as normal controls for the infections .
a subset of uninfected animals treated with 75 or 150 mg / kg / day of my - 24 was also included in the first experiment to assess possible toxicity .
hamster picv challenge my - 24 efficacy studies hamsters were weighed on the morning of treatment and grouped so that the average hamster weight per cage across the entire experiment varied by less than 5 grams .
animals were treated as indicated with 5 to 100 mg / kg / day doses of my - 24 or vehicle placebo 4 h prior to i.p. challenge with ~ 2 plaque - forming units ( pfu ) of picv .
ribavirin ( 40 mg / kg / day ) was included as a positive control and given by the same route and following the same schedule .
five hamsters from each group ( up to 10 for the placebo groups ) were sacrificed on day 7 of infection and sera were collected for assaying alanine aminotransferase activity and virus titers were determined for both liver and serum samples as described below .
the remaining 10 animals ( 20 for the placebo group ) were observed 21 days for mortality .
three to four sham - infected controls were included for comparison to establish baselines for all test parameters .
in separate studies conducted in uninfected hamsters , tolerability of doses up to 100 mg / kg / day of my - 24 was evaluated prior to challenge efficacy experiments .
tissue virus titer determinations virus titers were assayed using an infectious cell culture assay as previously described [ 17 ] .
briefly , a specific volume of tissue homogenate or serum was serially diluted and added to triplicate wells of vero 76 cell monolayers in 96 - well microplates .
the viral cpe was determined 7 - 8 days post - virus inoculation and the 50 % endpoints were calculated as described [ 35 ] .
the assay detection ranges were 2.8 - 9.5 log10 ccid50 / g of tissue or 1.8 - 8.5 log10 ccid50 / ml of serum .
in samples presenting with undetectable tissue or serum virus , a value of < 2.8 or 1.8 log10 was assigned , respectively .
conversely , in cases wherein virus exceeded the detection range , a value of > 9.5 or 8.5 log10 was assigned .
for graphic representation and statistical analysis , respective values of 1.8 , 2.8 , 8.5 , or 9.5 log10 were assigned as needed for samples with undetectable or saturated virus levels .
serum alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) determinations detection of alt in serum is an indirect method for evaluating liver damage .
per the manufacturer 's recommendations , serum alt levels were measured using the alt ( sgpt ) reagent set purchased from pointe scientific , inc .
( lincoln park , mi ) .
the reagent volumes were adjusted for analysis on 96 - well microplates .
statistical analysis kaplan - meier survival plots and all statistical evaluations were done using prism ( graphpad software , ca ) .
the log - rank test was employed for survival analysis .
for analyzing differences in viral titers and alt levels , a one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) with newman - keuls post test or the kruskal - wallis test with the dunn 's post test was performed based on gaussian distribution of the data .
the mann - whitney test ( two - tailed ) was used for comparing mean day of death .
results in vitro anti - arenavirus activity of my - 24 the activity of the aristeromycin derivative , my - 24 , was investigated in several cell culture - based arenavirus infection model systems .
as shown in table 1 , my - 24 demonstrated moderate activity against tcrv , junv , and picv by vyr with ec90 values ranging from 0.9 to 2.4 microm .
notably , by cper assay , the clade b arenaviruses ( tcrv and junv ) were found to be more sensitive to my - 24 .
ribavirin , included as a positive control , was active in the range of 8 - 16 microm versus the same panel of arenaviruses .
my - 24 had markedly lower cc50 values compared to ribavirin , resulting a 4 - fold difference in vyr si values ranging from 12 to 31 for my - 24 and 119 to 135 for ribavirin .

characterization of tcrv infection in ag129 mice because my - 24 demonstrated better antiviral activity against the more medically relevant clade b arenaviruses in cell culture ( table 1 ) , we pursued the development of a rodent model based on challenge with tcrv .
we initially challenged weanling hamsters i.p. with up to 106 ccid50 of tcrv and found them to be refractory to infection , with no apparent signs of illness or weight loss ( data not shown ) .
we next explored tcrv model development in ag129 ifn - alpha / beta and - gamma receptor - deficient mice .
we hypothesized that devoid of the critical ifn antiviral response , these mice would be susceptible to productive tcrv infection .
as shown in figure 2 , the ag129 mice were sensitive to the virus at varying degrees based on the viral inoculum , with disease progressing slowly and animals first succumbing on day 10 of infection .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0012760.g002 figure 2 survival of ag129 mice challenged with tcrv .
groups of 5 mice / group were inoculated with the indicated ccid50 dose of tcrv .
mortality was monitored over a 21 - day period .
percent survival for the 2,000 ccid50 group was based on 4 animals due to the loss of one animal on day 2 from causes not believed to be related to tcrv infection .
because some of the surviving mice continued to show varying degrees of mild to moderate disease signs ( lethargy , ruffled fur , and hunched posture ) towards the final days of the 3 week study , we sacrificed all surviving animals on day 21 to measure systemic viral burden and tissue titers .
in the 4 surviving animals that were challenged with 2x103 or greater ccid50 , all had 5 to 6 log10 of virus in the brain and spleen , 2 of 4 had 5 log10 of liver virus , and 3 of 4 had 3.5 to 5 log10 of serum virus ( data not shown ) .
only ~ 20 % of the samples collected from the surviving mice challenged with 20 or 2 ccid50 of tcrv had detectable levels of virus on day 21 .
a follow - up study was conducted to characterize the progression of tcrv infection during the acute phase of disease in ag129 mice .
as seen in figure 3a - e , all tissues examined harbored virus .
the first organ to have significant amounts of tcrv replication was the spleen , with ~ 6 log10 ccid50 / g on day 4 of the infection , and sustained virus burden out to day 12 ( figure 3d ) .
in several spleen samples collected on and after day 8 , white pustule - like spots and a pale light color were evident by gross visual examination .
virus first became apparent systemically on day 5 in 2 of the 3 mice , with sporadic titers through day 10 , and a spike up to ~ 7 log10 ccid50 / ml detected on day 12 ( figure 3a ) .
remarkably , liver virus titer went from undetectable on day 5 to ~ 6 - 7 log10 ccid50 / g on days 6 - 12 ( figure 3b ) .
a slight hint of lung virus could be detected as early as day 5 , with a substantial incremental increase thereafter of approximately 1 log10 / day as disease progressed ( figure 3c ) .
tcrv was found in the brain in 7 of 9 animals on day 8 and later ( figure 3e ) .
it is possible that virus was present as early as day 7 since we did not include that time point in the analysis .
overall , alt levels were fairly normal despite considerable viral burden ; however , a few animals did show some elevation on days 10 and 12 ( figure 3f ) .
considering that the mean day of death in animals that succumb from tcrv infection is ~ 12 days , with a range of 10 - 20 days , it is not surprising to see peak infectious tcrv loads at day 12 .
notably , the day - 12 analysis is likely an underestimate of the viral burden since the 3 sickest animals had succumbed prior to the time of sample collection .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0012760.g003 figure 3 time course analysis of tissue tcrv titers and alt levels in ag129 mice .
groups of 3 animals were sacrificed on the specified days during infection for analysis of a ) serum , b ) liver , c ) lung , d ) spleen , and e ) brain virus titers , and f ) serum alt concentration .
the day - 12 group started with 6 animals , with 3 succumbing prior to time of sacrifice .
obvious evidence of disease was not histologically observed until day 8 of infection .
typical liver lesions included moderate numbers of portal lymphocytes and histiocytes ( figure 4a ) and scattered degenerate / necrotic hepatocytes surrounded by small numbers of neutrophils or lymphocytes .
spleens of infected mice had hyperplastic follicles , follicular lympholysis and increased numbers of interstitial neutrophils ( figure 4b ) .
findings from day - 10 livers and spleens had similar pathology to that described for day - 8 tissue samples ( data not shown ) .
there was no kidney or brain pathology associated with advanced tcrv infection in the ag129 mice .
however , there was mild perivascular edema with small numbers of mixed inflammatory cells surrounding larger vessels in lungs of ~ 25 % of the animals on days 8 and 10 of infection ( data not shown ) .
taken together , the virus titer and histological findings indicate that tcrv - induced disease progresses slowly in the ag129 mice , providing an ample window of therapeutic opportunity to assess anti - arenaviral drug candidates in a murine system .

evaluation of my - 24 prophylaxis in ag129 mice challenged with tcrv having gained an understanding of the natural history of disease in the ag129 mouse tcrv mouse infection model , we sought to evaluate my - 24 in the newly established model .
my - 24 was dosed at 150 and 75 mg / kg / day i.p. for 7 days .
we treated the mice only once daily to limit handling of the type i and type ii ifn system - compromised ag129 mice .
as demonstrated in figure 5 , my - 24 treatment regimens resulted in 100 % protection against a lethal tcrv challenge dose .
ribavirin was also effective and protected 89 % of the mice from mortality .
six uninfected mice treated in parallel with 150 mg / kg / day ( n = 3 ) or 75 mg / kg / day ( n = 3 ) of my - 24 all survived the treatment regimen without any signs of adverse effects .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0012760.g005 figure 5 my - 24 protects ag129 mice challenged with tcrv from mortality .
mice were treated i.p. once daily for 7 days with the indicated mg / kg ( mpk ) doses of my - 24 or ribavirin .
treatment was initiated 4 hours prior to infection .
data shown for the high - dose my - 24 , low - dose my - 24 , ribavirin , and placebo groups are based on 9 , 8 , 9 , and 15 animals per group , respectively .
*** p < 0.001 compared to saline placebo - treated animals .
notably , we did observe that the infected animals treated with my - 24 had ruffled fur and were lethargic compared to the control animals towards the end of the study , which prompted us to weigh them on days 18 and 21 .
average group weight gain of 1.9 ( 150 mg / kg / day dose ) and 1.1 ( 75 mg / kg / day dose ) grams over that period suggested to us that they were on their way to recovery .
some of the ribavirin - treated animals also presented with ruffled fur and one had left hind leg paralysis .
these animals also gained weight ( 1 g ) from days 18 to 21 and appeared to be in a state of recovery .
for comparison , the sham - infected control mice ( n = 5 ) gained 0.9 g over that 3 - day period .
a follow - up evaluation of my - 24 in the ag129 mouse tcrv infection model was conducted to verify the results from the initial experiment ( figure 5 ) and to assess the impact of the compound on viral burden .
again , dramatic efficacy was observed in mice treated with my - 24 in the context of survival ( figure 6a ) .
complete protection was seen in the 25 and 50 mg / kg / day groups , with only a single mouse ( out of a total of 7 ) succumbing in the 100 - mg / kg / day group on day 22 of the infection , well after the mean day of death ( 13.7 days ) of animals receiving placebo .
ribavirin protected 90 % of challenged mice. by visual inspection of the animals during the study , several of the ribavirin treated animals presented with varying degrees of lethargy and ruffled fur starting on day 12 and thereafter .
this was also apparent in some of the mice in the 100 - and 50 - mg / kg / day my - 24 groups on day 17 and beyond , but to a lesser degree in the 50 - mg / kg / day group .
despite their ruffled appearance , most of these animals survived the 28 - day observation period .
more severe lethargy and ruffling of fur were observed in placebo - treated animals prior to succumbing from infection .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0012760.g006 figure 6 my - 24 protects ag129 mice against lethal tcrv infection despite lack of inhibition of viral replication .
mice were treated i.p. once daily for 7 days with the indicated doses of my - 24 or ribavirin , starting 4 h prior to tcrv challenge .
a ) survival data are based on 7 , 10 , 10 , 10 , and 20 animals per group for the high - dose my - 24 , intermediate dose my - 24 , low - dose my - 24 , ribavirin , and placebo groups , respectively .
an additional 4 to 5 mice per group were sacrificed on day 8 of infection for b ) serum , c ) liver , d ) lung , and e ) spleen virus titer determinations .
** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 compared to saline placebo - treated animals .
in addition to survival , day 8 viral loads from serum and liver , spleen , lung ( figure 6b - e ) , and brain tissues ( data not shown ) were also examined .
virus was present in all tissues except for brain .
lack of detectable virus may have been due to a slower development of brain virus titers in this particular experiment .
my - 24 did not have any impact on viral burden in the viscera , despite robust protection in the context of overall survival .
in contrast , ribavirin was able to partially knock down titers in serum , liver , and lung , but not spleen .
therapeutic efficacy of my - 24 in tcrv - challenged ag129 mice in the first two experiments , my - 24 treatment was initiated 4 h prior to tcrv challenge .
a third experiment was conducted to investigate the therapeutic capacity of my - 24 .
because tcrv infection can spread into the brain by day 8 ( and possibly day 7 ) and because we did not have any information as to the ability of my - 24 to cross the blood - brain barrier , therapeutic interventions were started prior to day 6 .
as seen in figure 7a , delayed treatment of tcrv infection in ag129 mice was highly effective with complete protection afforded when treatment was initiated on or after day 3 , and 90 % protection in the group where treatment started on day 1 .
based on individual animal weights tracked during the course of the experiment , mice receiving placebo generally began to markedly lose weight during the transition from day - 6 to day - 9 , and the surviving mice started their recovery after day 18 ( figure 7b - d ) .
in contrast , the my - 24 day - 1 and day - 3 treatment groups maintained weight through 12 days , lost considerable weight on days 15 and 18 , followed by recovery and weight gain by day 21 ( figure 7b , c ) .
interestingly , most of the mice in the day - 5 treatment initiation group were found to have a more gradual decrease in weight through day 18 , prior to the recovery phase ( figure 7d ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0012760.g007 figure 7 post - exposure my - 24 treatment prevents mortality in tcrv - challenged ag129 mice and delays clinical signs of illness .
mice ( n = 10 / group ) were treated i.p. once daily for 7 days with 75 mg / kg / day of my - 24 or placebo starting at the indicated days post infection .
a ) survival and a longitudinal analysis of b ) body weight were monitored during the course of the infection .
individual animal weights were recorded every 3 days for 24 days , with a final weight taken at the conclusion of the experiment .
** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 compared to the respective saline placebo - treated animals .
we also documented ruffling of fur during the course of the experiment .
for the placebo - treated animals , this process began on about day 7 or 8 and continued throughout the entire experiment for the surviving animals .
in the day - 1 my - 24 group , the ruffled appearance started on day 12 and persisted for most of the animals through the end of the study .
the day - 3 group began to show the ruffled appearance on day 14 , but it was noted that by day 22 the ruffling was less pronounced and improved gradually afterwards .
for the day - 5 my - 24 treatment group , mild ruffling was seen on day 16 of infection and persisted until day 21 with minimal ruffling noted by day 22 .
these observations are consistent with the individual weight change profiles shown in figure 7b - d. remarkably , both the weight change data and our observations of the mice show that the later the time of initiation , the more efficacious the my - 24 treatment was .
evaluation of my - 24 in hamsters challenged with picv we also investigated the activity of my - 24 in the well - established hamster model of acute arenaviral disease based on challenge with picv .
my - 24 was well - tolerated in preliminary toxicity studies with doses tested up to 100 mg / kg / day ( data not shown ) .
doses ranging from 5 to 75 mg / kg / day were evaluated in the in the first challenge efficacy experiment .
as seen in figure 8a , there was a slight protective effect evident by the survival curve comparison of the high - dose my - 24 treatment with the placebo .
this was emphasized by a significant increase in the mean day of death ( p < 0.05 ) of hamsters treated with 75 mg / kg / day ( 11.7 +/ - 4.1 days ) , compared to the placebo group ( 9.4 +/ - 3.1 ) .
the 25 - and 5 - mg / kg / day doses were ineffective .
a my - 24 dose - dependent decrease in alt was noted with the animals that received the 75 - mg / kg / day dose presenting with significantly reduced levels ( figure 8b ) .
consistent with the lack of a direct effect on viral titers seen in the tcrv ag129 mouse infection model ( figure 6b - d ) , neither liver nor serum picv burden was reduced in the my - 24 - treated hamsters compared to animals receiving saline placebo ( figure 8c , d ) .
the positive control drug , ribavirin , protected 100 % of challenged hamsters from death and reduced viral burden by an average of 4 - 5.5 log10 , and greatly minimized liver disease as reflected by baseline alt readings ( figure 8 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0012760.g008 figure 8 effect of my - 24 treatment on survival outcome , viral burden , and liver disease in picv - infected hamsters .
animals in each group ( n = 15 ) were treated i.p. twice daily for 6 days with my - 24 or ribavirin at the indicated mg / kg / day dose levels .
a placebo - treated control group ( n = 25 ) was included for comparison .
treatment was initiated 4 hours prior to infection and 5 animals per group were sacrificed on day 7 for evaluation of viral burden and alt levels .
a ) survival analysis , b ) serum alt , c ) liver virus titer , and d ) serum virus titer .
* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 compared to saline placebo - treated animals .
because we observed the most robust protection at the highest tested dose of 75 mg / kg / day , we also tested a higher dose of my - 24 .
notably , we used smaller hamsters in the subsequent studies to reduce the my - 24 quantities needed for higher and extended 7 - day duration dosing regimens .
as in the first efficacy study , 75 - mg / kg / day of my - 24 had only a subtle protective effect primarily manifested as a delay in mean day of death ( 10.6 +/ - 2.3 days compared to 8.9 +/ - 1.3 days for the placebo : p < 0.01 ) and significantly reduced liver disease as measured by systemic alt concentrations ( 333 +/ - 124 iu / ml compared to 1295 +/ - 483 iu / ml for the placebo : p < 0.001 ) .
moreover , no reduction in serum or liver viral load was observed following my - 24 treatment ( data not shown ) .
at a dose of 100 mg / kg / day , my - 24 again had no impact on the total number of surviving hamsters , but similarly delayed the time of death ( 13.4 +/ - 4.6 days compared to 9.7 +/ - 2.7 days for the placebo : p < 0.05 ) .
taken together , increasing of my - 24 dosage and extending treatment duration did not remarkably improve disease outcome .
discussion my - 24 is an analog of aristeromycin , which is a potent inhibitor of s - adenosyl - l - homocysteine ( adohcy , sah ) hydrolase .
sah hydrolase was first identified as an antiviral target in 1982 [ 36 ] .
since that time , a number of compounds , including aristeromycin , have been reported to have broad - spectrum activity versus a number of viruses , including arenaviruses [ 28 ] .
in the present study , we have evaluated my - 24 in two small animal models of acute arenaviral infection based on activity of the compound in cell culture .
despite only observing a slight protective effect in trials employing the hamster clade a picv infection model , my - 24 was highly efficacious in the newly developed ag129 mouse tcrv challenge model .
because of the better cell culture activity profile of my - 24 against the clade b arenavriuses , it was essential to test the compound against tcrv .
a recent study underscores the need to test promising compounds targeting the clade b arenaviral hemorrhagic viruses against tcrv in vivo .
bolken et al. used a model based on i.p. challenge of in newborn mice [ 6 ] to demonstrate the efficacy of a small molecule inhibitor ( st - 294 ) with known in vitro activity against clade b nwa , but not the more distantly related picv or lasv [ 4 ] .
because rodent model systems that employ newborn animals to produce lethal infection are generally considered to be farther removed from the human disease being modeled [ 3 ] , and because of the difficulty of working with newborn mice , we developed a new tcrv mouse infection model based on i.p. challenge of ag129 type i and type ii ifn receptor - deficient mice .
the use of the new tcrv mouse model over the existing hamster picv model was also advantageous because it greatly reduced the amount of compound required for our studies .
on a mg / kg basis , a tcrv mouse experiment would require ~ 5 - to 8 - fold less drug to complete compared to hamster models .
this can be an important issue in early stage drug development wherein costly , time - consuming synthesis of additional compound would be pursued only if dictated by basic proof - of - concept studies in mice , prior to advancing to picv , pirital virus [ 37 ] , or bsl - 4 arenaviral hemorrhagic fever guinea pig models [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .
one must consider however that the use of the new tcrv model is probably better suited for investigating the activity of candidate therapeutics that directly target the virus life - cycle and / or do not require complete host ifn pathways to impart their antiviral activity .
despite the inhibition of arenavirus replication in cell culture model systems , my - 24 did not reduce the viral burden systemically nor in the various hamster or mouse tissues examined .
this may suggest that the mode of action in vivo is not based on sah hydrolase or other virus - direct antiviral activity .
however , we cannot rule out the possibility that at earlier time points , we may have observed a significant reduction in serum and / or tissue viral burden .
it is conceivable that viral replication is abrogated at earlier stages of the infection , yet eventually the titers reach peak levels at the time of our analysis just prior to when the placebo - treated mice begin to succumb to the disease .
additional sampling times shortly after the onset of my - 24 treatment may uncover differences in viral replication kinetics early during the course of infection .
nevertheless , the present findings are consistent with the idea that my - 24 may ameliorate disease by blunting host response factors that play a role in disease pathogenesis occurring in response to the viral infection .
in picv - challenged hamsters , my - 24 significantly reduced liver disease as indicated by greatly reduced levels of alt .
in the ag129 mice treated therapeutically , the data are consistent with a delay in disease pathogenesis as weight loss and visual signs of disease were delayed in animals that received my - 24 .
this and the hamster alt findings support the theory that the compound is attenuating the development of disease .
a delay in the progression of disease may facilitate the eventual clearance of the virus from the system once the humoral immune response has more fully developed up in the tcrv - infected mice .
in hamsters , the delay in disease pathogenesis does not lead to improved survival , only a delay in time of death .
presumably , the hypercytokinemia that has developed in response to the picv infection in immune competent animals ultimately triggers excessive vascular leakage ( gowen et al. unpublished data ) , believed to be the fatal lesion in cases of vhf [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] .
because our present studies only examined viral titers on day 8 of infection , studies to evaluate viral titers on day 14 , 21 and 28 of infection in my - 24 - treated mice are necessary to determine when the virus is cleared from the blood and tissues , and to assess anti - tcrv neutralizing antibody levels .
moreover , future studies will examine the effect of my - 24 treatment on aspartate aminotransferase ( ast ) levels in tcrv - infected mice .
elevation of systemic concentration of ast is indicative of tissue damage and is a known prognosticator of disease outcome in severe cases of lassa fever [ 14 ] .
lastly , our findings showed that in mice wherein treatment was initiated on day 5 of infection , disease was less severe and the onset of clinical signs of illness was delayed .
this may be due to my - 24 possibly dampening the exaggerated cytokine response that may occur ; however , starting treatment too soon may prevent a robust early innate immune response .
thus , additional experiments to investigate the contribution of an overzealous proinflammatory response to mortality in the ag129 tcrv mouse infection model , and the impact of my - 24 treatment on this response , are warranted .
these studies will hopefully provide insights into the mechanism by which mice treated with my - 24 are able to survive tcrv challenge .

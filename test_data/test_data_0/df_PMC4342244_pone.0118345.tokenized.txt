ebola virus ( ebov ) causes a severe hemorrhagic disease with high fatality .
virus - like particles ( vlps ) are a promising vaccine candidate against ebov .
we recently showed that vlps protect mice from lethal ebov infection when given before or after viral infection .
to elucidate pathways through which vlps confer post - exposure protection , we investigated the role of type i interferon ( ifn ) signaling .
we found that vlps lead to accelerated induction of ifn stimulated genes ( isgs ) in liver and spleen of wild type mice , but not in ifnar - / - mice .
accordingly , ebov infected ifnar - / - mice , unlike wild type mice succumbed to death even after vlp treatment .
the isgs induced in wild type mice included anti - viral proteins and negative feedback factors known to restrict viral replication and excessive inflammatory responses .
importantly , proinflammatory cytokine / chemokine expression was much higher in wt mice without vlps than mice treated with vlps .
in ebov infected ifnar - / - mice , however , uninhibited viral replication and elevated proinflammatory factor expression ensued , irrespective of vlp treatment , supporting the view that type i ifn signaling helps to limit viral replication and attenuate inflammatory responses .
further analyses showed that vlp protection requires the transcription factor , irf8 known to amplify type i ifn signaling in dendritic cells and macrophages , the probable sites of initial ebov infection .
together , this study indicates that vlps afford post - exposure protection by promoting expeditious initiation of type i ifn signaling in the host .

mouse - adapted ebov causes similar acute disease in mice , offering a useful animal model to study ebov infection [ 3 , 4 ] .
ebov infection is characterized by rapid viral replication and dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses .
the disease follows profound suppression of type i ifn signaling and a contrasting excess inflammation that leads to mucosal hemorrhages and multi - organ failure resembling septic shock syndrome [ 5 , 6 ] .
virally encoded anti - ifn proteins , vp24 and vp35 play major roles in ebov virulence [ 7 , 8 ] .
vp35 blocks type i ifn induction in dendritic cells ( dcs ) and macrophages , and acts as a virulence factor necessary for a recombinant virus to attain infectivity in the host [ 9 - 12 ] .
vp24 , on the other hand , blocks ifn signaling by interfering with ifn activated jak / stat pathways [ 7 ] .
lines of evidence support the critical importance of type i ifn signaling in providing resistance against ebov infection ; mice deficient in stat1 , a transcription factor required for ifn induction , or ifnar1 , encoding the membrane receptor for type i ifns , are susceptible to wild type zaire ebov , against which wild type mice are resistant [ 13 - 15 ] .
a study of sudan ebov infection in humans showed that ifnalpha levels are significantly higher in surviving patients than those with fatal ebov infection , who had higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines / chemokines such as il - 6 , and mip - 1beta [ 16 , 17 ] .
high ifnalpha production is reported to correlate with increased resistance against ebov in mice as well [ 18 ] .
administration of recombinant ifnalpha or ifnbeta confers delayed time - to - death in nhps [ 19 , 20 ] .
furthermore , ifnalpha , used as an adjunct therapy for monoclonal antibody treatment , is shown to enhance protection in nhps [ 21 ] .
ebov infection remains a potential threat to public health , which is compounded with the lack of effective prevention or treatment .
to overcome this problem , various vaccine candidates have been developed , including various dna constructs , recombinant viruses , vlps , as well as treatment with anti - sense sirna [ 22 - 24 ] .
vlps are subunit - based vaccines , extensively studied for a variety of infectious pathogens [ 25 , 26 ] .
vlps prepared from ebov and other filoviruses are composed of the matrix protein ( vp40 ) , glycoprotein ( gp ) , and at times nucleoprotein ( np ) and represent a potentially promising candidate for ebov vaccine .
ebov vlps have been shown to confer protection upon rodents and nhps when given prior to infection [ 27 - 29 ] .
in the accompanying paper , we show that post - exposure administration of trivalent vlps protects mice from lethal ebov infection , further crediting the potential of vlps as a possible vaccine [ 30 ] .
in that study , we show that vlp protection requires macrophages , dendritic cells ( dcs ) as well as b and either cd4 or cd8 t lymphocytes , indicating that both innate and adaptive immunity are involved in conferring protection .
the aim of this study was to further investigate molecular bases of post - exposure protection by vlps .
based on our previous report that vlps stimulate type i ifn expression in dcs and macrophages , in vitro , we focused on the role of type i ifn signaling , and found that post - exposure vlp treatment leads to accelerated activation of ifn signaling , resulting in early induction of isgs .
significantly , vlp stimulated isg induction coincided with the attenuation of proinflammatory cytokine surge in ebov infected mice .
the reduced inflammatory responses was attributed to activation of type i ifn signaling , since vlp treated ifnar - / - mice were unable to inhibit not only viral replication but proinflammatory responses , and succumbed to death .
our results indicate that early type i ifn response is a major mechanism that contributes to vlp mediated protection against ebov infection .

vlps and ebov infection vlps were composed of ebov gp , np and vp40 and were generated in mammalian 293t cells as reported previously [ 31 ] .
vlp preparations used in this study contained < 0.03 endotoxin u / mg. mice were infected with ~ 1000 pfu (~ 3,000 ld50 ) of mouse - adapted ebov via intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) route [ 32 ] .

results lack of vlp mediated post - exposure protection in ifnar1 - / - mice against ebov infection to assess the role of type i ifn signaling in vlp - mediated protection against ebov infection , we tested ifnar1 - / - mice for protection by vlps .
in fig. 1a , wild type ( wt ) and ifnar1 - / - mice ( both balb / c background , n = 10 ) were injected with 50 mug of vlps 24h after infection by the mouse adapted ( ma ) ebov , and the morbidity and mortality were checked daily for the subsequent 14 days .
wt mice without vlp injection all died between day 5 and day 7 , whereas 80 % of mice that received vlps survived after ebov infection , confirming that vlps protect mice even when they were given post - infection .
in contrast , ifnar - / - mice that received vlps all died before or at day 5 as those without vlp injection ( fig. 1a ) .
these results are in agreement with previous report on early death of ma - ebov infected ifnar - / - mice [ 15 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0118345.g001 fig 1 ifnar is required for vlp post - exposure protection against ebov .
( a ) ifnar - / - and ifnar +/+ ( wt ) mice ( n = 10 mice / group ) were infected i.p. with ~ 1000 pfu ma ebov , followed 24 h later by injection i.p. with 50 mug of ebov vlps .
one group of ifnar +/+ ( wt ) mice infected with ebov without vlp served as control .
mortality is expressed as percent survival of each group on indicated days .
results are a representative of three independent experiments , which gave very similar outcomes .
qrt - pcr detection of ebov gp mrna level on day 2 post - ebov infection with or without vlps from liver ( b ) and spleen ( c ) of wt or ifnar - / - mice .
gp transcripts were normalized by hprt and values represent the mean +/ - sem of duplicate samples from three independent experiments .
asterisk denotes significant differences compared to wt controls (* p <= 0.05 , ** p <= 0.01 ) .
ebovs are thought to initially infect dcs and macrophages in liver and spleen , making these tissues the major sites of ebov replication in the mouse , although the virus infects many other organs later [ 3 , 34 ] .
to ascertain whether vlps inhibit viral replication , we measured ebov glycoprotein ( gp ) mrna expression in liver and spleen from wt and ifnar - / - mice with or without vlp administration .
qrt - pcr analysis in fig. 1b and 1c , found that levels of gp mrna rose sharply in ifnar - / - mice on day 2 of infection when gp mrna was still at background in wt mice .
ifnar - / - mice that received vlps also expressed considerable amounts of gp mrna , although levels varied between liver and spleen in the vlp treated group .
thus , ebov appeared to replicate faster and to a greater extent in ifnar - / - mice than wt mice .
it should be noted here that in wt mice , gp mrna levels began to increase rapidly after day 2 , peaking on day 3 to day 5 , and that vlp injection inhibited gp mrna expression by more than half ( s1 fig. ) .
these results are in line with the results that ifnar - / - and stat1 - / - mice are more susceptible to ebov infection , suggesting the possibility that vlp mediated protection is linked to the activation of type i ifn signaling [ 13 - 15 ] .
however , vlp injection may not have prevented ebov pathogenesis in ifnar - / - mice , possibly because the disease manifests more severely in these mice than in wt mice .
on the other hand , it has been recently shown that adenovirus based vaccine can protect ifnar - / - mice from lethal evob infection presumably through antibody responses , which indicates that ifnar - / - mice are not universally vulnerable , and anti - ebov resistance can be attained in some cases [ 35 ] .
vlp treatment accelerates induction of anti - viral and negative feedback isgs in ebov infected mice we recently reported that ebov vlps activate type i ifn transcription in dcs and macrophages in vitro , leading to induction of many isgs in these cells [ 33 ] .
here we asked whether vlps stimulate isg induction in vivo .
wt mice were infected with ma ebov and received vlps 24 h later , and induction of isg mrnas was tested on days 1.5 and 2 .
isgs encoding anti - viral proteins were first examined , as they may provide early protection against ebov infection .
upper panels in fig. 2a and 2b compare induction of anti - viral isgs , ifit1 , mx1 , oas1a and stat1 with or without vlp injection in liver and spleen .
in this early stage , levels of these isgs were consistently higher in the vlp - injected groups than those without vlps .
at later stages of infection , however , the situation reversed , in that mice without vlps had higher levels of isgs , as seen on day 3 ( s1 fig. for complete kinetics ) .
these results indicate that vlp administration accelerated type i ifn and isg induction , which presumably provide early anti - viral activity , not afforded without vlps .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0118345.g002 fig 2 accelerated isg induction in vlp treated mice .
wt mice were injected with vlps 24 h post - ebov challenge ( n = 5 / group ) and transcripts of indicated isgs in liver ( a ) and spleen ( b ) were measured on days 0 , 1.5 and 2 post - infection .
ifit1 , mx1 , oas1a and stat1 represent isgs with anti - viral activity , while irgm1 , usp18 , trim21 and trim30 are isgs with negative regulatory activities .
values represent the mean of duplicate samples from three to five independent experiments +/ - sem .
*** denotes p <= 0.001 , ** p <= 0.01 and * p <= 0.05 .
we next tested whether vlps induce other isgs , particularly those with negative regulatory activities .
this question was of interest to us , since mice that did not receive vlps expressed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines , which raised the possibility that ifn signaling exerts negative regulatory activity towards proinflammatory responses , perhaps by controlling nf - kappab activation [ 36 ] .
shown in the lower panels in fig. 2a and 2b is induction of irgm1 , usp18 , trim21 and trim30 .
irgm1 is an ifn inducible gtpase that inhibits lps induced endotoxin shock in mice [ 37 ] .
usp18 is an isg15 deconjugating factor that negatively regulates tlr signaling and resultant cytokine induction [ 38 ] .
trim21 and trim30 are members of the tripartite motif family that downregulate tlr induced inflammatory responses [ 39 - 42 ] .
expression of these isgs was also higher in the vlp injected group than that without vlps both in liver and spleen .
similar to anti - viral isgs , expression of these negative regulatory factors changed at the later stage ( s1 fig ) .
these data indicate that vlps accelerate induction of anti - viral and negative regulatory isgs , which may help suppress ebov 's anti - ifn antagonism ( see discussion ) .
to confirm that vlp induction of isg is dependent on type i ifn signaling , we next tested isg induction in ifnar - / - mice .
as expected , none of the isgs tested in fig. 2 were induced in ifnar - / - mice after vlp treatment or ebov infection ( s2 fig ) .
vlps lower expression of proinflammatory cytokines in ebov infected mice ebov pathophysiology such as severe hemorrhagic symptoms and tissue damage is thought to be associated with dysregulated inflammatory cytokine production [ 2 , 43 ] .
given that vlps accelerated induction of negative regulatory isgs , we next evaluated whether vlps modulate expression of proinflammatory genes .
in fig. 3 , expression of tnfalpha , il - 6 and il - 1beta , chemokines such as mcp - 1 ( ccl2 ) , mip - 1alpha ( ccl3 ) , mip - 1beta ( ccl4 ) , kc ( cxcl1 ) and inflammasome gene nlrp3 was measured in ebov infected mice with or without vlps .
these genes were all strongly induced upon ebov infection and peaked on day 3 with a gradual decline on days 5 and 7 .
in all cases , their expression was significantly attenuated in the vlp - treated group as compared to the group without vlps .
the difference was most dramatic in the early stage on day 3 , where the expression was reduced at least by 50 % .
in agreement with these results , we noted that serum levels of some of these proinflammatory cytokines were higher in ebov infected mice that were treated with vlps as compared those without vlps [ 30 ] .
these results support the view that limiting superfluous inflammatory responses contribute to vlp mediated protection .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0118345.g003 fig 3 vlps attenuate proinflammatory cytokine induction in ebov infected mice .
rna from liver of wt mice ( n = 5 / group ) infected with ebov with or without vlp treatment was tested for expression of proinflammatory cytokines ( tnfalpha , il - 6 and il - 1beta ) , chemokines ( mcp - 1 , mip - 1alpha , mip - 1beta and kc ( cxcl1 )) and inflammasome gene nlrp3 on indicated days post - infection .
values represent the average of duplicate samples from three independent experiments +/ - sem .
* p <= 0.05 , ** p <= 0.01 , *** p <= 0.001 indicates statistical significance .
exacerbated induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in ifnar - / - mice increasing evidence indicates that type i ifns antagonize inflammatory responses in a variety of settings [ 44 - 46 ] .
in light of the results that vlps stimulate those isgs known to suppress proinflammatory responses , it was of importance to determine whether type i ifn signaling by and of itself affects ebov induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines .
results in fig. 4 and s3 fig compare expression of the above proinflammatory factors in ifnar +/+ and ifnar - / - mice infected with ebov .
all cytokines and chemokines tested were induced after ebov infection in both strains .
importantly , their levels were much higher in ifnar - / - mice than ifnar +/+ mice .
these results indicate that type i ifn signaling downregulates ebov stimulated induction of proinflammatory factors , possibly through isgs with negative regulatory activities .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0118345.g004 fig 4 heightened induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in ebov infected ifnar - / - mice .
liver rna from ifnar +/+ and ifnar - / - mice ( n = 5 / group ) infected with ebov was tested for expression of indicated cytokines or chemokines on day 2 post - infection .
values represent the mean of duplicate samples from three individual experiments +/ - sem .
asterisks denote ** p <= 0.01 , * p <= 0.05 .
ifnar - / - macrophages elicit exaggerated proinflammatory cytokine responses following lps and ifnbeta signaling the above results indicated that type i ifns attenuate proinflammatory responses during ebov infection .
to explore whether type i ifns have a similar activity in settings other than ebov infection , we next tested lps and ifnbeta induced inflammatory responses in macrophages in vitro .
lps activates nf - kappab mediated proinflammatory cytokine induction , which can result in endotoxin shock [ 36 ] .
as shown in fig. 5 , combined treatment with lps and ifnbeta led to hyper induction of tnfalpha , il - 6 , il - 1beta and a chemokine kc in ifnar - / - macrophages as compared to wt cells .
lps and ifnbeta also induced negative feedback factors , trim21 and trim30 , with much lower expression in ifnar - / - cells than ifnar +/+ cells .
these results support a model in which type i ifns negatively regulate proinflammatory cytokine / chemokine responses at least in some situations .
we found that mip - 1alpha , mip - 1beta and mcp - 1 were not hyperinduced in ifnar - / - cells , suggesting that some proinflammatory genes are regulated not only by type i ifns but other factors ( data not shown ) .
alternatively , these differences may reflect variances between in vivo and in vitro conditions .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0118345.g005 fig 5 ifnar - / - macrophages elicit exaggerated proinflammatory cytokine responses following lps and ifnbeta stimulation .
bone marrow - derived macrophages from ifnar +/+ and ifnar - / - mice ( 1x106 cells / well ) were primed with ifngamma ( 100u / ml ) followed by co - stimulation with lps ( 200ng / ml ) and ifnbeta ( 100u / ml ) for 3 h. expression of indicated isgs , proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were assessed by qrt - pcr .
data represent the average of duplicate samples from three individual experiments +/ - sem .
asterisks denote * p <= 0.05 , ** p <= 0.01 .
vlp - mediated protection depends on the downstream transcription factor irf8 to further define pathways downstream of ifnar activity , important for vlp protection , we directed our attention on irf8 , a transcription factor expressed in macrophages and dcs [ 47 - 49 ] .
irf8 is induced by ifns and tlr ligands in a stat1 dependent manner , and plays a pivotal role in facilitating innate immune responses .
although irf8 is not involved in initial triggering of type i ifn induction , it amplifies ifn transcription in dcs and macrophages [ 50 ] .
irf8 promotes induction of multiple anti - microbial factors and is required for innate resistance against a variety of pathogens [ 50 - 52 ] .
irf8 stimulates expression of mhc and costimulatory molecules to boost antigen presentation [ 48 , 50 ] .
we thus tested whether irf8 disruption affects vlp - mediated protection against ebov .
survival data in fig. 6a show that approximately 80 % of irf8 - / - mice that received vlps died between day 6 and 8 , which is nearly identical to the mortality curve of wt mice without vlps .
as expected , the majority of wt mice that received vlps survived against ebov infection .
it is of note that ifnar - / - mice died 1 to 2 days earlier than irf8 - / - mice , which may be attributed to the difference in the mouse background .
correlating with the lack of protection , ebola gp mrna levels were much higher in ebov infected irf8 - / - mice than irf8 +/+ mice with or without vlps ( fig. 6b ) .
we next examined whether induction of anti - viral and negative feedback isgs is dependent on irf8 .
data in fig. 6c illustrate that induction of these isgs was very meager in irf8 - / - mice , in contrast to robust induction in irf8 +/+ mice .
importantly , vlps did not rescue isg induction in irf8 - / - mice .
results were similar in liver and spleens ( fig. 6c and s4 fig ) .
these results indicate that vlps , upon initial activation of type i ifn cascade , rely subsequently on the activation of downstream pathways represented by irf8 to confer protection against ebov .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0118345.g006 fig 6 vlp post - exposure protection requires the transcription factor irf8 .

mortality is expressed as the percentage survival .
( b ) ebov gp levels in liver were tested by qrt - pcr on day2 .
( c ) expression of indicated isgs in irf8 +/+ and irf8 - / - liver was tested by qrt - pcr on day 2 .
data represent the mean of duplicate samples +/ - sem and a representative of three independent experiments .
*** indicates p <= 0.001 , ** p <= 0.01 and * p <= 0.05 .
discussion to gain insight into the pathways through which vlps confer resistance against ebov infection , we investigated the role of type i ifn signaling in vivo and found that it significantly contributes to vlp - mediated protection .
this conclusion is supported by the observation that post - exposure vlp treatment accelerated isg induction in ebov infected mice , leading to reduced viral replication and inflammatory gene expression .
further supporting the critical role of type i ifn signaling in the protection , vlps did not induce isgs in ifnar - / - mice , and did not protect the mice from lethal ebov infection .
these results are consistent with the report that post - exposure ifnbeta or ifnalpha treatment increases protection against ebov infection in nhps [ 1 , 6 , 15 , 19 ] .
it is likely that vlps initially stimulated type i ifn genes , which in turn led to early induction of isgs .
in line with this notion , we recently showed that exogenous vlps stimulate transcription of ifnalpha and ifnbeta in dcs and macrophages in vitro , an event coupled with immediate and robust isg induction [ 33 ] .
it may be reasonable to assume that ifnar - / - mice were not protected by vlps primarily because isg induction was absent .
however , ifnar - / - mice may be susceptible to infection due to additional defects in innate immunity that are a secondary consequence of defective ifn signaling , which obliterates vlps protection .
contouring this notion however , it is of note that ifnar - / - mice can be protected against ebov by an adenovirus - based vaccine , indicating that ifnar - / - mice are not totally without defense [ 35 ] .
rather , it is possible that ifnar - / - mice are not protected by vlps that rely on isg induction for protection , whereas they are protected by the adenovirus vaccine that depends on antibody response .
vlp - induced isgs included anti - viral proteins known to inhibit replication of rna viruses such as ifit1 , mx1 and oas1a , as well as negative feedback factors that curb excess inflammatory responses , such as irgm1 , usp18 , trim21 and trim30 .
although the question of which anti - viral isgs are effective in inhibiting ebov replication awaits further research , it is anticipated that some of anti - viral isgs induced by vlps may interfere with ebov life cycle [ 53 ] .
what is the significance of accelerated ifn response in vlp mediated protection ?
available evidence suggests that vlps may overcome ebov 's anti - ifn antagonism .
the virally encoded vp24 and vp35 disable the entire ifn system in the host ; while vp24 blocks the jak / stat pathway of ifn signaling , vp35 , an ebov virulence factor , inhibits type i ifn induction in many cell types [ 6 , 7 , 9 , 11 ] .
we previously showed that vp35 inhibits type i ifn induction in murine dcs by premature sumoylation and inactivation of irf7 [ 10 ] .
it is thought that vp24 and vp35 have a decisive effect on the subsequent host resistance , since abated ifn signaling would impair proper innate immune responses , leading to deficiency in dc maturation , defective antigen presentation and aberrant inflammation .
compromised innate immunity would consequently undermine development of adaptive immunity [ 6 ] ( see a model in fig. 7 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0118345.g007 fig 7 a model for vlp mediated post - exposure protection against ebov infection .
top : ebov infection in macrophages and dcs inhibits induction of type i ifns and delays induction of isgs via the mechanism of anti - ifn antagonism .
impaired type i ifn signaling delays induction of antiviral isgs , and hinders maturation of macrophages and dcs and development of antigen presentation activity .
it also inhibits prompt induction of negative regulatory isgs that leads to exaggerated inflammatory responses .
as a result , adaptive immunity is not adequately induced .
bottom : vlps trigger timely induction of type i ifns and isgs by overcoming ebov 's anti - ifn antagonism .
this prompts rapid onset of anti - viral activity , simultaneously limiting exaggerated inflammatory responses and allowing maturation of antigen presentation function , which results in robust adaptive immune responses .
it is remarkable that in the vlp treated mice , isg induction began early within 1.5 to 2 days after ebov infection ( which was only 0.5 to 1 days after vlp treatment ) , when little to no isg induction was seen in mice without vlps .
the delayed isg induction in ebov infected mice is reminiscent of the reports showing that influenza virus delays isg induction in lung epithelial cells through ns1 , an influenza anti - ifn protein that is linked to disease pathology [ 54 , 55 ] .
an influenza virus strain deficient in ns1 is shown to induce isgs earlier than wild type virus , although the wild type strain does stimulate isgs later on [ 54 , 55 ] .
supporting the view that viral anti - ifn factors stall isg induction , rather than completely abrogate the induction , we also observed isg induction on day 3 and later in mice without vlps .
it may be envisaged that vlps trigger ifn activation early on , thereby eluding the activity of the ebov anti - ifn proteins ( a model in fig. 7 ) .
the most striking observation made in this study is the vlp - dependent suppression of proinflammatory responses .
this suppression was a result of type i ifn signaling , as ifnar - / - mice expressed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines , observed not only after ebov infection but also by ifnbeta and lps stimulation .
these results are in accordance with the growing recognition that type i ifns are linked to attenuation of inflammatory responses [ 6 , 44 ] .
for example , pinto et al. , reported , in the west nile virus infection model that ifnar - / - mice express excess proinflammatory cytokines , including those found in this study , as compared to wt mice , which correlated with increased disease pathology .
in this system , the overt inflammatory responses were attributed to ifn signaling in macrophages and dcs [ 46 ] .
induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines may be negatively regulated by ifn signaling through a series of negative feedback factors [ 37 , 39 - 42 , 56 - 58 ] .
irgm1 , induced by ifn signaling restricts lps induced endotoxin shock without limiting ifnbeta expression [ 37 ] .
trim21 and trim30 inhibit proinflammatory cytokine induction , at least in part by interfering with the nf - kappab dependent arm of transcription [ 39 - 41 ] .
in addition , these factors may act by post - transcriptional mechanisms , affecting inflammasome activation [ 42 ] .

[ 45 ] reported that type i ifns inhibit production of il - 1 by inhibiting activity of the nlrp1 and nlrp3 inflammasomes and by il - 10 induction .
thus , isgs with negative regulatory activity may preferentially attenuate proinflammatory pathways , while sparing ifn induction pathways .
given our earlier observations that vp35 does not grossly affect nf - kappab activation , while strongly inhibiting type i ifn activation , ebov may promote proinflammatory pathways at least in part through vp35 [ 10 ] .
lastly , we show that the transcription factor irf8 is required for vlp mediated post - exposure protection .
our results offer an added mechanistic insight into the pathways through which vlps provide protection .
irf8 is expressed predominantly in macrophages and dcs , and helps to amplify type i ifn gene induction and boosts ifns biological activities [ 51 ] .
given that macrophages and dcs are the putative early sites of ebov infection , vlps may exert a major impact on these cells to facilitate early innate immunity , in an irf8 dependent manner .
in conclusion , vlps confer post - exposure protection upon ebov infected mice by rapidly inducing isgs , thereby permitting timely establishment of anti - viral and anti - inflammatory states in the host .
vlps may act primarily by relieving ebov 's antagonism against type i ifns , resulting in reduced systemic inflammation and subsequent enhancement in acquired immune responses ( a model in fig. 7 ) .
supporting information s1 fig time course of isg induction in ebov infected mice with or without vlp treatment .
wt mice were injected with vlps 24 h post - ebov infection .
induction of ebov gp levels in liver ( a ) and spleen ( b ) were tested for wt mice infected with ebov with or without vlp treatment at indicated times ( n = 5 / group ) .
expression of indicated isgs was also assessed by qrt - pcr from day 0 to day 7 in liver ( c ) and spleen ( d ) .

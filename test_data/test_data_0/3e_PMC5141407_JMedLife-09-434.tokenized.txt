osteomas of the external ear are uncommon benign tumors that need to be differentiated from the external ear canal exostoses , bony proliferations that are linked mainly to cold - water exposure .
clinical manifestations vary from no symptoms to recurrent local infections and external ear cholesteatoma .
objective : presenting a rare case that we did not find described in the published literature .
a patient with multiple long - term asymptomatic osteomas of both external ear canals presented to our department .
material : data recorded from the patient 's medical record was reviewed and analyzed .
surgery was performed and histology confirmed the presumptive diagnosis .
results : there was a discrepancy between the local severity of the disease , with a complete obstruction of his ear canals , and the long - term disease - free status of the patient .
conclusion : we hypothesized about the etiology of these multiple bilateral osteomas of the eac , in light of the clinical and surgical findings .
osteoma external ear canal external ear cholesteatoma external ear canal obstruction is a relatively common condition due to various causes : cerumen impaction , poor epidermal clearance , local infection , local tumors , or foreign bodies .
bony growths in the external ear have been largely classified as exostoses ( most frequently encountered ) and osteomas , to differentiate their mechanisms of origin .
although the exact intrinsic mechanism that triggers their development is unknown , most of the authors agree that exostoses are a reaction to cold - water stimulation of the local periosteum [ 1 ] , while osteomas are benign osseous tumors [ 2 ] .
the treatment of both conditions is the surgical removal although the method is debatable [ 3 ] .
the development of these osseous tumors is a long - term process .
during this time , symptoms can develop and make the patient seek for medical care .
an uncommon case was referred to our service , with an almost complete osseous obstruction of both his ear canals and no significant hearing loss for a long time .
we presented this case herein and discussed its causes and the dilemmas that arose .
case presentation a 15 - year - old boy was admitted to our department for short time hearing loss , of approximately 1 - week duration .
the clinical examination noted a very important obstruction of both ear canals .
no ear specula could be used to examine the tympanic membrane .
practically , no lumen was visible / accessible by otoscopy ( fig. 1 ) .
no history of prolonged water sports was recorded and no otologic complaints were present before the actual episode .
no history of otitis could be elicited. fig. 1 multiple , irregular shaped osseous tumors in external ear canals : the left and the right side respectively ; no space left for the examination of the eardrums a ct - scan was performed andnormal middle ear spaces were identified , on both sides , with clear visible eardrums .
the external halves of the ear canals were obstructed by multiple osseous tumors , with relatively small insertion pedicles ( compared to the tumors ) and spiky , irregular surface .
the internal part of the ear canals were : free on the right side and full with a soft mass on the left side ( explaining the symptoms of our patient ) ( fig. 2 ). fig. 2 ct - scan revealing external ear osteomas on both sides , with insertion of the ear canal ( thin arrows ) on the anterior wall ; the space outside tm on the right side is clear ; the same space on the left ear is full ( thick arrows ) an audiogram revealed a pure conduction hearing loss on his left side ( fig. 3 ). fig. 3 patient 's audiogram surgery was advised and performed on the left , symptomatic ear .
the multiple osteomas found had large but steep pedicles with the origin into the middle third of the ear canal .
they were removed by using diamond burrs of appropriate dimensions with the aid of an operating microscope , through a canal approach .
macerated epidermal debris and cerumen were found on the left eardrum , after osteoma removal .
the tympanic membrane and the annulus were left intact .
some extracted bone fragments were sent for histological evaluation .
the paraffin - embedded sections confirmed the presence of osteoma .
discussion osteomas are benign tumors and their incidence is cited in 0,05 % of the otologic surgeries [ 4 ] .
they can sometimes generate external ear cholesteatoma [ 5 ] .
their etiology is still unknown , although different possible causes have been discussed in the literature [ 5 ] .
our case was very unusual due to the discrepancy between the patient 's symptoms and the clinical ct examinations .
the severe osseous obstruction of both his ear canals would have produced a bilateral conductive hearing loss , for a longer period than recorded .
the age of the patient ( 15years ) was suggestive of 2 possible explanations : either a very fast tumor growth or an extremely well tolerated congenital disorder .
the first hypothesis could be proposed due to the bilaterality of the lesions .
exostoses could have been considered as a first diagnosis but the amount of bone obstruction , the lack of local constant water irritation , and the unusual ct appearance of the tumors granted the condition rather unlikely .
the spiky and irregular shape of the tumors suggested a tumoral etiology .
still , bilaterality and a symptom free disease could give rise to suspicions as to a congenital unrecognized condition .
also , the multilocular origin of the osseous growths suggested un unusual pattern for a tumor , be it malignant or benign in nature .
the only acceptable explanation for our patient 's disease was a congenital malformation , existent from birth .
the lack of hearing loss for such a chronic disease is still debatable .
the epidermal clearance mechanism of the ear canal was apparently functional , a thing that was obvious from the analysis of the ct scans of the symptom - free ( right ) ear .
the left ear hearing thresholds were afflicted only when epidermal debris and cerumen accumulated behind the external osseous obstruction affected the tympanic membrane .
one could assume that the bony growths of the patient enlarged progressively , followed eventually by a disturbance of canal aeration and epidermal clearance .
the dilemmas that we found in this case were the real nature of the obstruction ( exostosis vs. osteoma ) and the mechanism of genesis ( malformation vs. postnatal ) .
we did a research of pubmed literature for similar reported cases , but we could not find any .
therefore , we considered the disease congenital bilateral osteomas of the ear canal .
it would have been interesting to monitor the development of the patient 's tumors over time .
a long - term follow - up is in progress with the purpose of surveying the possible recurrences in the operated ear .
another particular aspect of this case was its asymptomatic course until teenagehood .
the surgical treatment of the eac osteoma is mandatory in cases with significant morbidity : hearing loss , epidermal retention , or recurrent infections [ 4,6 ] .
we also decided to operate the symptomatic ear .
the technical approach varies according to the extent of the disease [ 5,7 ] .
our intra - auricular procedure seemed a good choice due to the lack of mastoid or middle ear involvement .
intraoperatively , we could confirm the macerated epidermal debris present outside the tympanic membrane .
no trauma to the eardrum occurred .
a prolonged healing after surgery is mentioned in the literature if no split thickness grafts are used [ 6,8 ] .
we did not consider their use , since much of the ear canal was carefully preserved during the procedure .
some authors stressed the risk of hearing loss due to trauma from surgical drilling [ 6 ] .
we used only diamond burrs in our surgery , for maximal hearing preservation .
the patient is still in follow - up for the monitoring of the local healing process and the eventual recurrences .
conclusion osseous malformations of the external ear can take various histological presentations .
the lack of epidermal clearance and aeration are always followed by complaints , going from hearing loss to local infection and otorrhea .
surgery is indicated if the disease becomes symptomatic .
local monitoring of the disease can appreciate the recurrence potential of the condition .
it is very unusual for such a disease to go undiagnosed until later in life .

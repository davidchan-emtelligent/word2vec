pinellia trypsin inhibitor human poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma introduction the traditional chinese herbal medicine rhizoma pinelliae ( rp ) is the tuber of pinellia ternata ( thunb. ) breit. , and is listed in the dictionary of traditional chinese medicine ( 1 ) as effective in removing dampness to reduce phlegm , reducing adverse qi for controlling nausea and vomiting , and relieving distension to eliminate stagnation , among other effects ( 2 - 4 ) .
rp is used alone or in combination with other chinese medicines to treat various neoplastic diseases .
this plant is also used as folk medicine for treating cancer in several regions of china ( 5 - 8 ) .
there have been a number of studies on the antitumour activity of pinellia , such as the inhibitory effects of ethanolic pinellia extract on liver cancer cells , of total organic acids of pinellia on gastric cancer cells and of pinellia protein on ovarian cancer cells ( 8 - 12 ) .
however , to the best of our knowledge , the antitumour activity of low molecular weight components of pinellia has not been reported .
trypsin inhibitors ( tis ) , low molecular weight proteins that inhibit various serine proteinases , are widely present in animals , plants and microorganisms .
tis inhibit the catalytic activity of enzymes or prevent zymogen activation through combination with the active and allosteric site of the proteinase .
tis are crucial in regulating physiological and pathological processes and are an important component of the immune system .
tis have extensive application prospects in the research and development of antitumour drugs ( 13 - 18 ) .
studies have demonstrated that ti receptors are present in numerous types of tumour cell , and tis exert their antitumour function by binding with the receptors and regulating the activity of related proteinases ( 19 - 26 ) .
in the present study , we isolated a small water - soluble protein from pinellia ternata , investigated its trypsin inhibitory activity and considered the association of antitrypsin activity with antitumour activity .
the present study aimed to isolate and purify short - chain peptides with serine proteinase inhibitory activity from the small water - soluble protein components of raw rp , and to study their physicochemical properties and their ability to inhibit the proliferation of poorly differentiated bgc - 823 human gastric adenocarcinoma cells in vivo and in vitro .

subsequently , 100 mul complete dmem and 10 mul mtt solution were added into each well and the plates were incubated for 4 h at 37degreesc under a saturated 5 % co2 atmosphere .
the culture was then terminated and the cultural supernatant was carefully discarded by aspiration from the wells .
dimethylsulphoxide ( 150 mul ) was added into each well and agitated for 10 min for full dissolution .
the absorbance at 490 nm was determined with an enzyme - labelled instrument ( 3550 microplate reader ; bio - rad , hercules , ca , usa ) to compute the cell growth inhibition rate according to the following formula : cell growth inhibition rate (%) = ( 1 - average a of the treatment group )/ average a of the control group x 100 ] .

results rpti extraction and separation fresh pinellia ternata tuber was ground , homogenised , aqueously extracted and lyophilised to obtain a water - soluble lyophilised protein powder .
( nh4 ) 2so4 precipitates of the total protein of pinellia ternata at all levels were obtained by further using the stepwise salting - out method .
the total recovery rate of the precipitate was 96.49 % .
analysis indicated that ti activity was mainly concentrated in the 40 % ( nh4 ) 2so4 precipitate and the specific trypsin inhibitory activity was 1.83 - fold that of the total protein ; the recovery of inhibitory activity was 62.38 % and the total protein content of the precipitate was 123.67 mg , accounting for 34.13 % of the total protein .
the majority of the protein precipitated with 60 % ( nh4 ) 2so4 , accounting for 56.62 % of the total protein , and it had partial ti activity ; its specific activity was only 0.50 - fold that of the total protein .
the 80 % ( nh4 ) 2so4 solution precipitated the least amount of protein , which exhibited no ti activity ( table i ) .
rpti purification the 40 % ( nh4 ) 2so4 precipitate was designated as the crude rpti product and subjected to trypsin - sepharose 4b affinity chromatography to form two protein peaks ( a280 nm ; fig. 1a ) .
p1 was a saliferous elution peak that exhibited no ti activity and p2 was an affinity adsorption activity peak , which was further separated using sephadex g - 50 to form four protein peaks ( fig. 1b ) .
the p1 and p2 formed by sephadex g - 50 separation were ti activity peaks , which were mainly concentrated in tubes 10 - 16 .
the 12 % sds - page purity detection indicated that only the components in tubes 10 - 12 ( the first half of p1 ) exhibited a single protein band and were estimated to have > 90 % purity .
the eluents of the samples in tubes 10 - 12 following repeated sample loading were collected and combined to obtain purified rpti. fig. 1c shows that the crude rpti protein had numerous bands and a complex composition .
further affinity chromatography removed the majority of the hybrid proteins and only left two clear main bands .
more uniform main bands of rpti were obtained following the gel filtration , with an apparent relative molecular weight of ~ 14 kda .
the activity recovery during each purification step is listed in table ii. following the affinity chromatography , the specific inhibitory activity increased by 3.45 - fold .
the sephadex g - 50 separation produced a homogenous component .
the activity recovery was 24.40 % and 6.02 - fold purified rpti was obtained .
n - terminal amino acid sequence and homology following sds - page and the transmembrane filtration , the n - terminal amino acid sequence of the pure rpti was determined .
the first six amino acid residues at the n - terminal of the rpti in the present study were 1 - dpvvdg - 6 .
the blast database of the ncbi indicated that the first six amino acids in the n - terminal sequence of rpti are the same as those of arrowhead proteinase inhibitors a and b , with serine replacing glycine at the sixth position being the only difference .
the rpti sequence was highly homologous to those of the arrowhead proteinase inhibitors (> 80 % ; table iii ) .
inhibitory effect of rpti on trypsin activity a 10 - mug / ml rpti solution was formulated with 0.05 mol / l tris hcl ( ph 8.0 ) buffer solution and successively diluted to 5.00 , 2.50 , 1.25 and 0.625 mug / ml. the inhibitory activity of rpti on trypsin was determined using the following method : 0.80 ml diluted sample solution under test is added to 0.20 ml bovine trypsin and incubated at 37degreesc for 5 min .
then 2.50 ml bapna solution was added and reacted at 37degreesc for 5 min , the reaction was immediately terminated and added to 0.5 ml 33 % acetic acid solution , the absorbance ( a ) was detected at 410 nm , with the test sample without inhibitor as the control sample .
table iv shows that at 0 - 2.5 mug / ml rpti , the trypsin inhibition activity had a good linear association with the concentration of rpti .
the linear regression equation was y = - 25.709x + 94.862 ( r2 = 0.9626 ) .
the rpti concentration required to completely inhibit 20 mug of trypsin was 3.69 mug / ml and the inhibition ratio ( mass ) of rpti to trypsin was 1:6.78 , with a molar inhibition ratio of 1:1.69 .
inhibitory effect of rpti on bgc - 823 cell proliferation in vitro table v shows that rpti significantly inhibited the proliferation of bgc - 823 cells and that the inhibition was concentration - dependent .
the ic50 of rpti calculated using logistic regression was 16.96 mug / ml within 48 h after treatment and 9.61 mug / ml within 72 h after treatment .
the bgc - 823 cells were treated with 10 mug / ml rpti ( fig. 2 ) .
after 72 h , the changes in cell shape were observed under an inverted microscope .
the bgc - 823 cells in the rpti group were less shrunken and were significantly reduced in number compared with those of the control group , with numerous suspended cells being dead .
the cells exhibited nuclear pyknosis and rough cytoplasms and underwent less fission .
the control cells had regular shapes and good adherent growth .
activity of rpti against bgc - 823 cells in vivo table vi shows that subcutaneous rpti administration around the tumour significantly inhibited the growth of the transplanted bgc - 823 cells and the inhibition was dose - dependent .
the tumour inhibition rates of the high - dose and medium - dose groups were significantly higher than that in the control group , but was lower than that of the ctx positive control group .
the tumour inhibition effect in the low - dose group was not significantly different from that in the control group .
rpti was not observed to have a significant effect on the spleen coefficient of the mice .
discussion pinellia ternata tuber is used for the clinical treatment of various neoplastic diseases alone or combined with other chinese medicines ( 5 - 8 ) .
studies have suggested that the pinellia protein significantly inhibits the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells ( 11 ) .
tis are widely present in plants and are widely accepted in the medical field as potential cancer preventive agents .
in the present study , a small protein from pinellia ternata tuber was isolated through separation methods , demonstrated that this component has certain trypsin inhibitory activity and inferred that rpti may be a component of pinellia ternata that has antitumour activity .
to the best of our knowledge , the present study is the first to isolate and purify rpti .
the purified rpti showed a single band under sds - page , with a molecular weight of 14 kda .
its n - terminal amino acid sequence was dpvvdg , which is highly homologous to that of arrowhead serine proteinase inhibitors .
the inhibition rate ( mass ) of rpti to the trypsin activity was 1:6.78 .
rpti markedly inhibited trypsin activity and its inhibition constant ki was significantly lower than the km of trypsin ( data not shown ) .
therefore , rpti was considered as a strong serine proteinase inhibitor .
the present study preliminarily demonstrates that rpti has a significant inhibitory effect on bgc - 823 cell proliferation in vitro and on the tumour growth of transplanted bgc - 823 cells .
the tumour inhibition was concentration - and dose - dependent .
consequently , rpti has significant antitumour activity .
a key step in tumour cell growth and infection is extracellular matrix ( ecm ) degradation .
rpti likely exerts its antitumour effects by combining with the serine proteinase or a specific receptor on the external surface of bgc - 823 cell membranes through different approaches .
thus , the proteinase loses its ability to hydrolyse the ecm , preventing bgc - 823 cell invasion and tumour growth .
during the separation and purification of rpti using affinity chromatography , the samples were maintained at 37degreesc for 1 h after loading .
the column was then washed with a highly concentrated salt solution ( 1 mol / l nacl ) to wash off the majority of nonspecific binding hybrid proteins .
the bonding rpti ingredients were eluted with aqueous acid so that the purity of the rpti , separated through affinity chromatography with trypsin as the ligand , was significantly improved .
the p1 and p2 activity peaks generated through sephadex g - 50 filtration were not completely separated and the ingredients in tubes 10 - 16 were detected to have clear ti activity .
only the first half of the p1 peak , i.e. , the proteins in tubes 10 - 12 , showed a uniform band in the sds - page .
following further electrophoresis and transmembrane separation , the main band of the purified rpti ingredient was cut off for sequencing to ensure the purity of the rpti .
the serine proteinase inhibitor separated from the tuber of pinellia ternata has promising potential for application in antitumour therapy .
the aim of further studies is to design degenerate primers according to the rpti n - terminal amino acid sequence , clone its cdna sequence , elucidate the complete gene expression of rpti and determine its mechanism of action .

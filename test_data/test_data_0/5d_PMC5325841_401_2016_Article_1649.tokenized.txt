chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( cte ) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with repetitive mild impact traumatic brain injury from contact sports .
recently , a consensus panel defined the pathognomonic lesion for cte as accumulations of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau ( p - tau ) in neurons ( neurofibrillary tangles ) , astrocytes and cell processes distributed around small blood vessels at sulcal depths in irregular patterns within the cortex .
the pathophysiological mechanism for this lesion is unknown .
moreover , a subset of cte cases harbors cortical beta - amyloid plaques .
in this study , we analyzed postmortem brain tissues from five institutionalized patients with schizophrenia and history of surgical leucotomy with subsequent survival of at least another 40 years .
because leucotomy involves severing axons bilaterally in prefrontal cortex , this surgical procedure represents a human model of single traumatic brain injury with severe axonal damage and no external impact .
we examined cortical tissues at the leucotomy site and at both prefrontal cortex rostral and frontal cortex caudal to the leucotomy site .
for comparison , we analyzed brain tissues at equivalent neuroanatomical sites from non - leucotomized patients with schizophrenia , matched in age and gender .
all five leucotomy cases revealed severe white matter damage with dense astrogliosis at the axotomy site and also neurofibrillary tangles and p - tau immunoreactive neurites in the overlying gray matter .
four cases displayed p - tau immunoreactivity in neurons , astrocytes and cell processes encompassing blood vessels at cortical sulcal depths in irregular patterns , similar to cte .
the three cases with apolipoprotein e epsilon4 haplotype showed scattered beta - amyloid plaques in the overlying gray matter , but not the two cases with apolipoprotein e epsilon3 / 3 genotype .
brain tissue samples from prefrontal cortex rostral and frontal cortex caudal to the leucotomy site , and all cortical samples from the non - leucotomized patients , showed minimal p - tau and beta - amyloid pathology .
these findings suggest that chronic axonal damage contributes to the unique pathology of cte over time .

for survivors , tbi is a known environmental risk factor for the development of dementia later in life .
multiple studies provide evidence that single moderate or severe tbi increases the likelihood of eventual presentation with clinical signs and symptoms of neurodegeneration , such as alzheimer disease ( ad ) [ 7 , 29 , 35 ] .
such studies typically did not include postmortem examinations of brain tissues .
rather , the medical literature scantily addressed chronic neuropathological sequelae after tbi .
one recent autopsy study of 39 patients with long - term survival ( 1 - 47 years ) after single moderate or severe tbi , however , showed widespread beta - amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles ( nfts ) in the brains of approximately one - third of patients [ 17 ]. whether single mild tbi ( concussion ) similarly confers increased risk of developing dementia with neuropathological abnormalities in susceptible individuals remains undetermined .
for contact sport athletes with repetitive mild tbis or subconcussive events , such as boxers and american football players , studies of postmortem brains from symptomatic patients revealed a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with distinctive neuropathological features , called chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( cte ) [ 4 , 27 ] .
often presenting with symptoms years after cessation of contact sport participation , cte patients tend to exhibit initially behavioral and mood abnormalities , cognitive impairments and chronic headache , whereas in advanced stages , these patients deteriorate to frank dementia [ 28 , 33 , 45 ] .
like other neurodegenerative tauopathies , disease progression relates to the burgeoning spread of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau protein ( p - tau ) [ 28 ] .
in the first consensus meeting to define neuropathological criteria for cte , the participants established the pathognomonic lesion as p - tau accumulation in neurons ( nfts ) , astrocytes and cell processes , with predilection around small blood vessels , at sulcal depths in irregular cortical spatial patterns [ 26 ] .
the biological mechanism underlying this observation is unknown .
in addition , a subset of reported cte cases demonstrated diffuse , or more rarely neuritic , beta - amyloid plaques [ 4 , 26 , 39 , 44 ] .
tbis commonly involve axonal injury , a prominent factor contributing to symptomatology and one of multiple possible lesions in the human brain consequent to head impact [ 15 , 34 , 46 ] .
therefore , we identified a human model that isolates the axonal damage component of tbi , that is , surgical leucotomy , and then tested the hypothesis that chronic axonal injury can result in neurodegenerative changes , such as nfts and beta - amyloid plaques .
we analyzed postmortem brain tissues from five institutionalized patients with schizophrenia , who had undergone bilateral prefrontal leucotomy as therapy prior to 1953 and then lived at least another 40 years ( table 1 ) .
since leucotomy involves severing axons in the prefrontal cortex , this surgical procedure represents a single iatrogenic tbi with severe axonal damage and no external cortical impact .
we examined cortical tissues at the leucotomy site , prefrontal cortex rostral and frontal cortex caudal to the leucotomy site , and hippocampus for evidence of p - tau and beta - amyloid accumulations .
we also examined postmortem cortical brain tissues of five patients with schizophrenia from the same institution , who had not undergone leucotomies in their lifetimes , matched in gender and approximate age (+/ - 4 years ) to the leucotomy patients ( table 1 ) .
moreover , we determined the apolipoprotein e ( apoe ) genotype for all ten patients .
we found p - tau accumulations in the gray matter at the axotomy site in all five leucotomy patients , with four cases showing the pathognomonic p - tau pattern of cte .
scattered beta - amyloid plaques also occupied the gray matter at the lesion site , but in the three leucotomy patients with apoe epsilon4 haplotype .
we observed minimal p - tau and beta - amyloid pathology in the cortical samples rostral and caudal to the leucotomy site and in all cortical samples from the non - leucotomized schizophrenia patients .

the patient population continually expanded such that the institution cared for almost 14 , 000 patients in 1954 .
many resident patients suffered from chronic schizophrenia .
in the late 1940s until 1953 , surgeons commonly performed bilateral prefrontal leucotomy as therapy for intractable symptoms .
currently available clinical records do not detail the surgical procedure , but based on autopsy findings and medical literature , the surgeons most likely used bilateral burr holes at the coronal suture between the frontal and parietal bones to access the brain [ 5 ] .
in recent years , many patients have been discharged to the care of local community mental health centers .
several hundred patients , however , were too impaired for community living and thus remained as inpatients. drs .
kenneth davis and vahram haroutunian established the brain bank for the pilgrim psychiatric center , with dr. daniel perl serving as neuropathologist .
we sampled brain specimens fixed in formalin , embedded these tissues in paraffin and then sectioned the tissue blocks at 5 mum thickness .
for the leucotomy postmortem brain tissues , the samples comprised cortical tissues cut in the coronal plane at the leucotomy site , prefrontal cortex rostral and frontal cortex caudal to the leucotomy site , and hippocampus ; for the non - leucotomized postmortem brain tissues , the samples included equivalent cortical neuroanatomical sites .
we conducted hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) stains on tissue sections for general morphology / structure and immunohistochemistry with antibodies detecting glial fibrillary acidic protein ( gfap , astrocyte marker , mouse anti - human monoclonal antibody ga5 , leica biosystems , pa0026 ) , abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau ( at8 , ps199 / s202 / t205 ; mouse anti - human monoclonal antibody , thermo scientific , mn1020 ) , beta - amyloid ( mouse anti - human monoclonal antibody , clone 6f / 3d , leica biosystems , ncl - b - amyloid ) and antigen cd68 ( marker of macrophages and activated microglia , mouse anti - human monoclonal antibody clone 514h12 , leica biosystems , pa0273 ) .
immunohistochemistry for these antibodies was performed on a leica bond iii automated immunostainer with a diaminobenzidine ( dab ) chromogen detection system ( leica biosystems , ds9800 , buffalo grove , il ) .
we also performed immunohistochemistry experiments with two other antibodies against abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau ( cp13 , ps202 ; phf1 , ps396 / s404 ) .
briefly , tissue sections were first deparaffinized and rehydrated .
for antigen retrieval , tissue sections were immersed in sodium citrate buffer ( ph 6 ) at boiling temperature for 6 min and then cooled to room temperature .
to quench endogenous peroxidase activity , tissue sections were placed in a solution of 0.5 % h2o2 in methanol for 1 h. tissue sections were incubated in blocking solution , comprised of 5 % bovine serum albumin in phosphate - buffered saline ( ph 7.4 ) , for 1 h at room temperature .
the primary antibodies were diluted in block solution ( cp13 , mouse anti - human monoclonal antibody , 1:1000 ; phf1 , mouse anti - human monoclonal antibody , 1:1000 ; gifts from dr. peter davies , feinstein institute for medical research , manhasset , ny ) .
the tissue sections were incubated with primary antibody solution in a humidified chamber at 4 degreesc overnight .
tissue sections were then incubated with secondary antibody , followed by avidin - biotin - complex incubation ( vectastain elite abc kit , mouse igg , vector laboratories , pk - 6102 ) and visualization with dab ( immpact dab , vector laboratories , sk - 4105 , burlingame , ca ) , according to manufacturer instructions .
the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin , dehydrated and cleared with xylene before application of mounting media and coverslip .
tissue samples also underwent modified bielschowsky silver staining for detection of nfts and neuritic plaques [ 8 ] .
we extracted dna from formalin - fixed brain tissues , according to manufacturer 's instructions ( dneasy blood & tissue kit , qiagen , 69504 , valencia , ca ) .
apoe genotyping was performed with real - time polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) [ 2 ] .
two neuropathologists ( di , dpp ) conducted blinded evaluations of the stained and immunostained brain tissue samples .
this protocol received institutional review board approval prior to initiation of study .
results schizophrenia patients with leucotomy the leucotomized schizophrenia cohort comprised five patients with advanced years at the time of death ( mean age 78 years , range 67 - 89 years , 3 females and 2 males , table 1 ) .
in the standard leucotomy operation , surgeons sectioned axons in white matter of both frontal lobes in the plane of the coronal suture ( fig. 1a ) [ 5 ] .
in all five cases , the leucotomy site in the prefrontal cortex displayed severe white matter damage on both gross examination and h & e staining ( fig. 1b , c ) .
gfap immunoreactivity indicated replacement of subcortical white matter with dense astrogliosis ( fig. 4a , c , e ) .
the prefrontal cortical sample rostral to the leucotomy site showed intact white matter in case 1 .
for case 2 , gfap immunohistochemistry showed scattered , sparse astrogliosis .
for case 3 , gfap immunoreactivity revealed minimal astrogliosis , and cases 4 and 5 showed moderate astrogliosis .
in the frontal cortical samples caudal to the leucotomy site , gfap immunoreactivity displayed nominal white matter astrogliosis ( table 2 ) .

all five leucotomy cases showed heightened p - tau immunoreactivity in the cortex at the coronal plane of the axotomy site , specifically nfts and p - tau immunoreactive neurites ( fig. 2b , e , h ) .
the white matter of cases 1 , 4 and 5 revealed rare , isolated p - tau immunoreactive threads .
unlike the cortex at the leucotomy site , the prefrontal rostral cortical tissues of cases 1 , 2 and 5 showed no immunoreactivity with at8 , cp13 or phf1 antibodies , and cases 3 and 4 displayed scant nfts and p - tau immunoreactive neurites ( fig. 2a , d , g ) .
frontal cortical tissues caudal to the leucotomy site similarly revealed minimal p - tau pathology .
for cases 1 , 2 , 4 and 5 , no p - tau immunoreactivity was detected with at8 , cp13 or phf1 immunohistochemistry at these sites ( fig. 2c , f , i ) .

case 5 , the oldest patient in the cohort at 87 years , displayed a small focus of cored and diffuse plaques with additional subpial immunoreactivity at one sulcal depth , which did not correspond to the p - tau immunoreactivity pattern and also differed from the beta - amyloid plaques distributed throughout gray matter at the leucotomy site in cases 1 , 3 and 4 .

in cte , nfts and other p - tau pathologies preferentially affect the ca2 and ca4 regions of the hippocampus , which differs from ca1 and subiculum involvement in normal aging or ad [ 26 ] .

we studied brain specimens from identical cortical sites as the leucotomy patients .
all tissue samples showed no significant pathology .
gfap and cd68 immunoreactivities were unremarkable .
the cortical tissues revealed rare , scattered nfts and beta - amyloid plaques , but no p - tau encompassing blood vessels or favoring sulcal depths .
case 10 showed nominal caa ( table 2 ) .
these five schizophrenia patients genotyped either as apoe epsilon3 / 3 or epsilon3 / 4 ( table 3 ) .
discussion in this study , we isolated the axonal injury component of human tbi by examining brain tissues from deceased patients with schizophrenia , who had undergone leucotomies at least 40 years before death .
we specifically analyzed these tissues for chronic neurodegenerative sequelae .
we provided evidence that massive chronic axonal damage in white matter of prefrontal cortex , as produced by leucotomy , results in accumulation of p - tau in neurons , astrocytes and cell processes , particularly around small blood vessels at depths of cortical sulci in irregular spatial patterns , in gray matter adjacent , but not rostral or caudal , to the axotomy site .
this specific cortical p - tau distribution matches the recently established pathognomonic lesion of cte , suggesting that axonal injury may serve as a pathophysiological substrate for this pathology over time , and possibly for both repetitive mild tbis of contact sports and single severe or even moderate impact head injuries .
last , the brains of schizophrenia patients with leucotomy formed beta - amyloid plaques in gray matter also adjacent to the axotomy site , but predominantly in those patients with the apoe epsilon4 haplotype .
we did not observe comparable p - tau or beta - amyloid accumulations in corresponding neuroanatomical prefrontal cortices as the axotomy sites in the non - leucotomized schizophrenia patients of matched age and gender , nor in corresponding rostral prefrontal or caudal frontal cortical sites .
cte is a distinct neurodegenerative disorder linked to previous repetitive mild impact tbi and subconcussive events , classically described in retired boxers [ 4 , 24 ] .
the recent publication establishing initial diagnostic criteria for cte points to p - tau accumulations in neurons , astrocytes and cell processes , favoring ensheathment of blood vessels at sulcal depths in irregular cortical patterns , as the pathognomonic lesion , thus distinguishing cte from other neurodegenerative tauopathies and also aging - related tau astrogliopathy ( artag ) [ 19 , 26 ] .
the underlying pathophysiology leading to this specific neuroanatomical distribution of p - tau aggregates , especially encompassing blood vessels , remains unanswered .
there are two main hypotheses : that underlying axonal damage may be related to these pathognomonic lesions or that mechanical stress at sulcal depths during the traumatic event may render them susceptible to eventual p - tau deposition .
due to lack of extensive clinical history , we cannot comment upon head injury for an individual patient in this study .
nevertheless , because we observed p - tau immunoreactivity patterns similar to cte only in the schizophrenia patients with leucotomy , which results in severe axonal injury without head impact , the data in this study support the hypothesis that selective p - tau accumulation at sulcal depths relates to underlying axonal damage .
evidence exists to support the connection between traumatic axonal damage , which can persist for years , and accumulation of protein aggregates typically associated with neurodegenerative disease , with particular research focus on beta - amyloid [ 14 , 16 , 43 ] .
pointedly , among those patients who had died or experienced temporal cortex surgical resection shortly after severe tbi , a subset showed beta - amyloid plaques , including young people [ 10 , 40 , 41 ] .
in diffuse axonal injury resultant of impact tbi , disruption of protein transport at sites of damage can lead to accumulation of proteins , including amyloid precursor protein ( app ) , in axonal varicosities and bulbs [ 16 ]. with axonal damage , proteins can abnormally congregate in the same space , either within the damaged axon or extracellular domain .
as such , noxious molecular interactions potentially can occur , for example , beta - secretase and presenilin - 1 cleaving app to generate beta - amyloid that can then aggregate to form plaques [ 3 , 16 , 43 , 49 ] .
likewise , indigenous tau proteins normally reside within axons , stabilizing neuronal microtubules to aid with axonal transport of essential components necessary for cell survival and function. with tauopathic neurodegenerative disease , tau proteins become hyperphosphorylated , disassociate from microtubules and aggregate in insoluble form .
one postmortem study of human brain tissues , from persons who had died between 4 h and 5 weeks after tbi , showed phf1 immunopositivity in axonal varicosities and bulbs , neuronal cell bodies and reactive astrocytes within the cerebral cortex in two of 18 cases [ 49 ] .
in the tbi study of surgically resected temporal cortices , tissue samples in 12 of 18 cases displayed dystrophic axons in white matter with positive phf1 immunoreactivity ; three cases showed phf1 immunopositive glia , and four cases revealed phf1 immunopositive neurons [ 10 ] .
for the schizophrenia patients who had survived at least 40 years after leucotomy in this study , we similarly noted nfts , astrocytic tangles and p - tau immunoreactive cell processes in neuroanatomical areas near the axotomy site , with three p - tau antibodies including phf1 .
in addition , we observed beta - amyloid plaques scattered in the gray matter within proximity of the massive axonal damage in a subset of the leucotomized cases ( apoe epsilon4 haplotype ) .
given these data and literature , we surmise that damaged axons may inadvertently release proteins at the lesion site into the extracellular brain parenchyma , perhaps over long periods of time , thereby promoting aberrant molecular reactions and deleterious aggregation of particular proteins .
one possible explanation for the p - tau accumulation pattern in cte , and the leucotomized patients in this study , lies in interstitial solute clearance in the human brain through local diffusion and fluid bulk flow , a process first proposed about 100 years ago with recent scientific breakthroughs [ 12 ] .
the human brain lacks characteristic lymphatic vessels , utilized by the rest of the body , to provide protein and fluid homeostasis .
in contemporary experiments involving rodents , data show that cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) in the subarachnoid space influxes through periarterial spaces and exits through the aquaporin 4 channels of astrocytic endfeet , mixes with interstitial fluid to flow by convection through the interstitial space clearing macromolecules and finally passes through aquaporin 4 channels of astrocytic endfeet into perivenous spaces - - termed the glymphatic pathway for the dependence upon glial cells to function as the surrogate lymphatic system in the brain [ 30 ] .
the perivenous fluid effluxes to contiguous csf that filtrates through arachnoid granulations to dural sinuses for venous drainage .
two recent papers provide evidence that csf , with its soluble and cellular contents , flows into newly discovered lymphatic vessels in meninges lining dural sinuses that drain into cervical lymph nodes [ 1 , 23 ] , in addition to lymphatic vessels of nasal mucosa , cranial nerve sheathes and particular arteries and veins exiting the cranium [ 1 ] .
in another paper employing mouse models , the authors showed impaired function of the glymphatic system after tbi , with prominent astrogliosis , loss of perivascular aquaporin 4 polarization and axonal damage and then specifically identified diminished interstitial tau clearance with accompanying hyperphosphorylated tau increase [ 11 ] .
one common observation reported in cte , and also in the leucotomy patients of this study , is p - tau accumulation encompassing blood vessels and in perivascular astrocytes , which is consistent with clearance data in rodents .
considered a biomarker for axonal injury , total tau levels increase in csf and blood serum after tbi in humans , including contact sports athletes shortly after mild head injuries [ 31 , 42 , 50 ] .
nevertheless , since most experiments involve rodents , with lissencephalic brain structures , the specific mechanisms of clearance within the human brain , particularly its relation to sulcal depths , remain poorly understood .
we suspect that the sulcal depth serves as an exodus for tau clearance after axonal damage in humans .
if true , then axonal injury , which occurs with tbi ranging from mild to severe , may account for the pathognomonic p - tau signature pattern of cte [ 26 ] .
finally , brain tissues from long - term survivors of single moderate to severe tbi , with presumable axonal injuries that can persist for years , also display nfts and p - tau immunoreactive astrocytes in cortical sulcal depths [ 14 , 17 ] .
taken together , these data and literature not only bolster the link between head trauma and cte , but also attenuate the notion of the pathognomonic cte lesion being limited to multiple mild tbis and / or subconcussive events .
cte is classified as a tauopathy , yet a subset of reported cases displays diffuse or neuritic beta - amyloid plaques in cortical gray matter , which instigated the debate decades ago concerning the pathophysiologic connections among head injury , neuropathological neurodegenerative indicators such as p - tau and beta - amyloid protein accumulations and augmented development of neurodegenerative diseases .
in 1973 , after extensive examination of brain tissues from 15 deceased boxers , corsellis , et al. reported only one case with neuritic beta - amyloid plaques , using classic silver staining techniques [ 4 ] .
interestingly , roberts , et al. analyzed brain tissues from 14 of these same cases plus six others , but additionally employed immunohistochemistry experiments for beta - amyloid detection , to discover numerous diffuse plaques in most cases [ 39 ] .
moreover , several papers provide data suggesting an association between the apoe epsilon4 genotype and predilection for beta - amyloid deposition in the brains of patients dying shortly after head injury [ 9 , 32 ] and also in cte patients especially with advancing years [ 44 ] .
in this present study , all three leucotomized patients with the apoe epsilon4 haplotype displayed diffuse and cored beta - amyloid plaques scattered throughout the gray matter adjacent to the lesion site , in contrast to the leucotomized patients with the apoe epsilon3 / 3 genotype .
the oldest leucotomized patient , who had died at 87 years with an apoe epsilon3 / 3 genotype , showed a focus of cored beta - amyloid plaques at one sulcal depth , which complements a recent study reporting predilection of beta - amyloid aggregates at cortical sulcal depths in cte patients [ 44 ] .
all five schizophrenia patients without leucotomies showed minimal or no beta - amyloid immunoreactivity in cortical gray matter , including three patients with apoe epsilon4 haplotype .
the molecular interaction between apoe protein and beta - amyloid warrants further clarification ; however , apoe can bind beta - amyloid to enhance its clearance through multiple mechanisms including proteolysis , with apoe e4 as the least effective isoform [ 22 ] .
in mouse models , experimental data demonstrated that murine brains clear soluble beta - amyloid along glymphatic paravenous drainage pathways as well and that deletion of the aqp4 gene attenuates this process [ 13 ] .
in addition to the glymphatic system for clearance of beta - amyloid , efflux transporters , such as the low - density lipoprotein receptor - related protein - 1 ( lrp1 ) , facilitate transendothelial transport across the blood - brain barrier [ 51 , 52 ] .
human brain studies revealed cerebrovascular beta - amyloid deposits in three former boxers and increased frequency of caa in apoe epsilon4 patients with severe acute tbi [ 21 , 48 ] .
in this study , we observed minimal caa or perivascular beta - amyloid aggregation in all ten schizophrenia patients .
rather , brain tissues of the apoe epsilon4 haplotype patients with leucotomy showed beta - amyloid plaques throughout gray matter overlying the axotomy site .
this study has several limitations in design and interpretation .
foremost , we lacked detailed antemortem clinical data , including head injury history , which curtailed the extent of neuropathological analysis .
additionally , we assessed brain tissues from two small cohorts : five schizophrenia patients with leucotomy and for comparison , five schizophrenia patients without leucotomy who had also lived at the pilgrim psychiatric center during approximately the same time period .
most likely aging in the schizophrenic brain diverges from persons without this condition , as evidenced by schizophrenia patients in advanced years more frequently suffering from severe cognitive impairments than the general population [ 37 , 38 ] .
a neuropathological study of 100 consecutive autopsy patients ( age range , 52 - 101 years ; mean , 77 years ) , however , shows equivalent amounts of beta - amyloid plaques and nfts in neocortex and hippocampus of patients with schizophrenia , as compared to 47 patients with other psychiatric disorders and 50 patients without psychiatric or dementing diagnoses , when matched by age [ 37 ] .
the study authors concluded that the percentage of elderly schizophrenia patients with ad , as determined by neuropathological criteria , basically equates to the general elderly population with corresponding ages .
since schizophrenia involves neurodevelopmental abnormalities , the possibility exists that clearance of p - tau , beta - amyloid and other neurodegenerative proteins may differ from persons without schizophrenia .
due to the small number of patients in each cohort , uncertainty of tissue integrity equivalence from archived brain specimens and tendency for focality and irregularity patterns of especially the p - tau immunoreactivity , we did not numerically quantify pathological results .
also , because we obtained specimens previously dissected for other studies , we were unable to analyze hemibrain sections similar to contemporary cte studies to attain more thorough neuroanatomical distribution assessment of p - tau aggregates in sulcal depths .
as such , we could not determine potential cortical spatial patterns for sulcal tauopathy , which currently are described as irregular in cte .
furthermore , given these limiting circumstances , we may have serendipitously missed sulcal tauopathy in the sampling of brain tissues from case 1 .
other possibilities for lack of sulcal p - tau pathology in case 1 include that this individual responded differently than the other four patients after the leucotomy procedure , or that since this patient died at the youngest age ( 67 years ) , with more prolonged life this patient may have accumulated p - tau in sulcal depths similar to the other older leucotomized patients in the cohort .
in summary , we studied a human model of severe axonal injury , analyzing brain tissues specifically for chronic neurodegenerative changes .
we found p - tau pathology in patterns resembling cte in gray matter adjacent to the leucotomy site .
we also observed a subset of cases with beta - amyloid plaques , similarly reported in cte , scattered in gray matter at the leucotomy site , but in patients with apoe epsilon4 haplotype , which is associated with worse clinical outcomes for tbi patients [ 6 , 25 , 47 ] , including boxers and american football players [ 18 , 20 ] .
these data suggest that axonal injury , common to all severities of tbi , contributes to the distinct pathology of cte over time. dr. s. b. shively and ms. s. l. edgerton contributed equally to this article .

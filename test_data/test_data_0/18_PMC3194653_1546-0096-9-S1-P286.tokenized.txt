cd226 or dnam - 1 is a type 1 membrane protein belonging to the ig - superfamily and is involved in the adhesion and co - stimulation of t cells and nk cells .
a trend towards association of this snp with juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( jia ) was recently reported , but was not statistically significant ( p = 0.13 ) ( genes immun. 2010 mar ; 11 ( 2 ) : 194 - 8 ) .
aim we performed a case - control genetic association study to investigate whether cd226 gly307ser is associated with susceptibility to jia .
methods cd226 gly307ser was genotyped in 667 jia cases and 1320 healthy controls , both of north - west - european white origin .
allele frequencies were compared .
patients with oligoarticular ( persistent and extended ) , polyarticular ( rheumatoid factor negative and positive ) and systemic jia have been included and were analyzed separately as well as grouped together .
a meta - analysis of our study combined with the previously published study was performed .
results cd226 gly307ser was significantly associated with susceptibility to jia ( p = 0.002 , or = 1.23 , 95 % ci : 1.08 - 1.41 ) , particularly in the persistent oligoarticular subtype ( p = 0.0008 , or = 1.38 , 95 % ci : 1.14 - 1.67 ) .
the meta - analysis ( of all subtypes grouped together ) confirmed the association with jia ( p = 0.003 , or = 1.14 , 95 % ci : 1.05 - 1.23 ) .
conclusion this study provides evidence for a novel jia susceptibility locus .
additionally , a subtype - specific association of cd226 with persistent oligoarticular jia has been identified .
this finding is in line with the hypothesis that this oligoarticular subtype is not only phenotypically , but also genetically different from the polyarticular subtypes , including extended oligoarthritis .

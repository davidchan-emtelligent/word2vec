background aspergillus tubingensis is a black aspergillus belonging to the aspergillus section nigri , which includes species that morphologically resemble aspergillus niger .
recent developments in species determination have resulted in clinical isolates presumed to be aspergillus niger being reclassified as aspergillus tubingensis by sequencing .
we present a report of a patient with an osteomyelitis of the maxillary bone with a probable invasive aspergillus tubingensis infection .
case presentation we describe an immune compromised patient suffering from osteomyelitis of the maxillary bone after tooth extraction .
the osteomyelitis probably resulted in dentogenic pansinusitis presenting as an acute ethmoiditis .
histologic examination of biopsy samples showed osteomyelitis , and inflammation of the surrounding connective tissue .
cultures of the alveolar wound grew aspergillus tubingensis .
the patient was treated with liposomal amphoterocin b , which was changed to oral treatment with voriconazole based on susceptibility testing ( mic for voriconazole was 1 mug / ml ) .
conclusion this case shows that aspergillus tubingensis may have the potential to cause severe invasive infections in immunocompromised hosts .
a larger proportion of aspergillus tubingensis isolates are less susceptible to azoles compared to aspergillus niger .
therefore , correct species identification and susceptibility testing is crucial for the choice of anti - fungal treatment , screening of azole resistance , and characterization of the pathogenic potential of the various species within aspergillus section nigri .
aspergillus tubingensis aspergillus section nigri invasive mould infection species identification background aspergillus tubingensis is a black aspergillus species described by raoul mosseray in 1934 [ 1 ] .
this species is found all over the world , grows predominantly on dead plant material , and is food associated [ 2 ]. a. tubingensis belongs to the aspergillus section nigri , which also includes a. niger , and a. awamori amongst a total of 25 species [ 2 - 4 ] .
the species belonging to the aspergillus section nigri are phylogenetically closely related .
this makes the taxonomy and species determination difficult .
in general , species can be distinguished via a polyphasic approach using morphology , biochemical properties , and molecular data [ 3,5 ] ; however , most of the species belonging to the aspergillus section nigri are morphologically indistinguishable .
several species do have some distinct biochemical properties : nutritional growth conditions and hydrolase differences between the species have been described [ 6 ] .
furthermore , production of secondary metabolites is often unique for a species within aspergillus section nigri , and could be used for identification [ 2 ] , but it is not yet possible to differentiate the species solely on metabolic properties .
due to the above mentioned difficulties in discrimination of species , the most commonly used method for species identification of aspergillus section nigri is sequencing .
using calmodulin or beta - tubulin data sequencing data , all aspergillus section nigri species can be clearly distinguished [ 3 ] .
the development of these molecular diagnostic tools has facilitated correct species determination of black aspergilli .
in this report , we describe a patient with a probable invasive infection with a. tubingensis , and discuss the clinical importance of a. tubingensis and its correct species determination .
case presentation a 19 - year - old male patient born in the netherlands ( moroccan parents ) presented with fever , rhinitis and progressive pain behind the left eye .
his recent medical record included a second non - myeloablative stem cell transplantation for graft failure resulting in relapse of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 3 weeks prior to presentation .
he had undergone a maxillary tooth extraction 47 days prior to presentation .
the alveolar wound did not heal due to osteomyelitis , for which he had a biopsy of the maxillary bone 23 days prior to presentation .
histological examination of the biopsy samples showed necrotic bone tissue .
the surrounding connective tissue was infiltrated by leukocytes .
yeast cells , and focal bacterial colonies were noted .
he was treated empirically with amoxicillin / clavulanic acid orally , which had been started 3 days prior to presentation , and the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporine , mycophenolic acid , and prednisone. with this treatment , the patient was clinically deteriorating .
physical examination revealed a body temperature of 37.9degreesc and normal vital signs .
a purulent wound in the mouth resulting from the biopsy , left pre - orbital swelling , and painful cervical lymphadenopathy were observed .
laboratory tests showed increased c - reactive protein at 346 mg / l , leucopenia ( leukocytes < 0.1 x 109 / l ) , thrombopenia ( thrombocytes 32 x 109 / l ) and normocytic anaemia ( haemoglobin 5.51 x 109 / l ) .
computed tomography of the head showed pre - orbital swelling with induration of the subcutis , swollen mucosa of the sphenoid , and maxillary sinus , and total opacification of the left ethmoid sinus ( figure 1 ) .
since a direct surgical approach was impossible due to extensive bleeding of the swollen mucosa , an antrostomy was performed and sinus secretions were thoroughly aspirated .
cultures of purulent fluid from the biopsy wound in the mouth on sabouraud dextrose agar at 37.0degreesc grew a black aspergillus , morphologically resembling a. niger .
cultures of the aspirated secretion from sinus cavities were negative for bacteria and fungi .
results of the histological examination of mucosal lining samples of the nasal sinus were consistent with chronic sinusitis .
the result of molecular identification of the black aspergillus by sequencing of the beta - tubilin gene was a. tubingensis mosseray ( cbs - knaw , fungal biodiversity centre , utrecht , the netherlands , strain cbs 133792 ; genbank accession number kc163802 ) .
figure 2 shows the phylogenetic relationships among aspergillus section nigri species , including our isolated strain ( table 1 ) .
antifungal susceptibility testing by microdilution showed that the strain had mic values to voriconazole of 1 mug / ml , to posaconazole of 0.25 mug / ml , to itraconazole of 0.25 mug / ml , to fluconazole of > 24 mug / ml , to anidulafungin of 0.125 mug / ml , to amphothericin b of 0.5 mug / ml , and to flucytosine of 2 mug / ml [ 7 ] .

the patient was treated with liposomal amphothericin b 5 mg / kg for 6 weeks and imipinem 500 mg / qid for 2 weeks intravenously , followed by prolonged treatment with voriconazole 300 mg / tid oral for 4 months. with this treatment the patient recovered from the sinusitis , but passed away later on that year due to bk virus encephalitis .
in summary , we describe an immunocompromised patient suffering from osteomyelitis of the maxillary bone with a probable invasive a. tubingensis infection of the surrounding connective tissue after tooth extraction .
this probably resulted in dentogenic pansinusitis presenting as an acute ethmoiditis .
conclusions species belonging to the aspergillus section nigri have been identified as opportunistic pathogens , particularly in cases of otitis and sinusitis. of the 25 species in section nigri , a. niger has most often been described as the cause of infection , however , in most cases species determination was based only on morphology [ 8 ] .
osteomyelitis caused by aspergillus section nigri is very rare [ 9 ] , and by a. tubingensis has to the best of our knowledge not been described .
we isolated a. tubingensis from a purulent wound localized on the surface of the infected maxillary bone .
the immunocompromised patient deteriorated while he was treated with antibiotics , and improved after antimycotics were added .
therefore we consider this case as a probable invasive aspergillosis .
alternatively , the infection may have been caused by yeasts , which were noted in the necrotic tissue sampled during the debridement 23 days prior to presentation .
we can not rule out involvement of yeasts as well , however , the cultures of the purulent fluid samples taken from the bone biopsy wound at presentation were negative for yeasts .
the subsequent pansinusitis of the patient and acute ethmoiditis were probably dentogenic , since the purulent mouth wound after biopsy was ipsilateral to the pre - orbital swelling .
problematic wound healing of the alveolus after tooth extraction often causes sinusitis due to fistula of the maxillary sinus and contamination with dental microbial flora [ 10 ] .
alternatively , a. tubingensis could have invaded the sinus and directly cause the sinusitis .
however , cultures of aspirated secretion from the sinus cavities were negative , and no fungal strains were found with histological examination of biopsies from the mucosa of the sinus cavities .
in recent studies , clinical isolates presumed as a. niger species have been re - classified by sequencing as a. awamori and a. tubingensis isolates [ 11 - 14 ] .
sequencing of aspergillus isolates from transplant patients with invasive aspergillosis showed that in 9 % of cases the causative agent belonged to aspergillus section nigri , and 32 % of these isolates were determined as a. tubingensis [ 15 ] .
these studies show the potential of a. tubingensis to cause invasive infections .
differentiating between a. tubingensis and a. niger also allows for screening for azole resistance .
thus far , studies on susceptibility patterns suggest that these may not be the same for both the species .
about 40 - 50 % of aspergillus section nigri strains have a mic > 1.0 mug / ml to voriconazol , and 70 - 80 % to itraconazol. a. tubingensis strains more often have higher mics to itraconazole and voriconazole [ 16,17 ] .
since there are no clinical breakpoints for aspergillus section nigri available , it is uncertain how we should interpret these mic values .
recently , clinical breakpoints have been presented for a. fumigatus , proposing mics <= 0.5 mug / ml for voriconazole and itraconazole as susceptible [ 18 ] .
therefore , in our hospital we start empirical treatment with liposomal amphothericin b in case of infection with a black aspergillus , and change to azole therapy based on the results of species determination by sequencing and antifungal susceptibility testing .
in conclusion , the presented case shows that a. tubingensis may cause severe invasive infections in immunocompromised hosts .
recent developments in species determination within the aspergillus section nigri have resulted in a trend in recognizing a. tubingensis as an important opportunistic pathogen .
species determination of clinical aspergillus section nigri isolates by sequencing and antifungal susceptibility testing are both crucial for determining appropriate antifungal therapy , epidemiological data on susceptibility patterns , and the pathogenic potential of the various species .

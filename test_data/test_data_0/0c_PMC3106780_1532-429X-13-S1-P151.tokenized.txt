additionally , the extent of the infarct gray zone is a strong independent predictor of post - ami mortality .
however , the evolution of gray zone after ami has not been investigated and its relationship with mvo in terms of risk stratification is unknown .
purpose to characterize the evolution of gray zone and determine its correlation with the presence of mvo during infarct healing in patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) .
methods patients were enrolled post - pci and underwent mri examination on a 1.5t scanner ( ge signa excite ) at day 2 , week 4 and month 6 following ami .
cardiac function [ ejection fraction ( ef ) , end - diastolic volume ( edv )] was evaluated using a steady - state - free - precession ( ssfp ) sequence in cine mode .
a t1 - weighted ir - gre sequence was used for delayed - hyperenhancement ( dhe ) of infarcted myocardium .
infarct core ( ic ) and gray zone ( gz ) volumes were quantified using the full - width - half - maximum technique as previously described ; both quantities were expressed as a percentage of myocardial volume .
mvo 's were manually traced and included in the infarct core calculation .
results ten patients who completed mri exams at all three time points were included in the study [ mean age : 59.7 +/ - 11 years ; 9 males , 1 female ; 4 right coronary artery and 2 left circumflex artery pci ; mvo was identified in 4 patients ] .
figure 1 shows dhe images from representative patients in the mvo and non - mvo groups while tables 1 , 2 , 3 summarize the corresponding quantities measured .
note that the following findings were significant : ( a ) infarct core was reduced in all patients by month 6 ; ( b ) mvo was resolved by week 4 ; ( b ) gray zone size relative to infarct size , gzr = 100 * gz /( gz + ic ) increased in the mvo group at month 6 while it remained stable in the non - mvo group ; ( d ) ef was reduced in the mvo group compared to the non - mvo at all time points ( p < 0.05 ) .
the percent change in gzr ( deltagzr ) at week 4 and month 6 , relative to day 2 is shown in figure 2 .

color coding identifies three regions : infarct core ( green ) , gray zone ( yellow ) and microvascular obstruction ( red ) .

conclusions the increase in infarct gray zone or arrhythmogenic substrate may be one of the possible mechanisms responsible for adverse remodeling and poor clinical prognosis in patients with mvo .
monitoring the early evolution of gray zone in the high - risk patients could also potentially help identify the optimal timing and candidates for placement of implantable cardioverter - defibrillator .

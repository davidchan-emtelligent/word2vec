angiomyolipoma ( aml ) is a rare benign renal tumor occurring in about 0.3 to 3 % of the general population .
most frequently it takes the form of small single tumors occurring sporadically or accompanying tuberous sclerosis ( bourneville - pringle disease ) .
in some cases the tumor may reach a very large size and be a cause of various serious complications .
this case description concerns a 26 - year - old female patient , suffering from hypopituitarism , hypothyroidism and binocular blindness during the course of septo - optic dysplasia , in whom a giant , left renal aml was diagnosed and treated surgically .
according to the authors' knowledge this was the first reported case of a huge size aml in a patient with de morsier syndrome .
keywords angiomyolipoma hypopituitarism septo - optic dysplasia issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 background angiomyolipoma ( aml ) is a rare benign renal tumor histologically containing elements of smooth muscle , adipose tissue and blood vessels in various proportions .
it occurs in 0.3 to 3 % of the general population , four - fold more frequently in women and the peak of incidence falls between the 30th and 50th years of life [ 1 ] .
most frequently ( 80 %) these are small , singular tumors which occur unilaterally and occasionally .
in the remaining cases they coexist with tuberous sclerosis ( bourneville - pringle disease ) and they may be bilateral and multiple and achieve significant sizes [ 2,3 ] .
a tumor which is bigger than 10 cm and affects a whole organ is considered a ' giant ' aml [ 4 ] .
septo - optic dysplasia ( de morsier syndrome ) is a very rare syndrome of congenital defects consisting of optic nerve hypoplasia , hypopituitarism , and agenesis of the septum pellucidum [ 5,6 ] .
case presentation the patient , a 26 - year - old woman with a diagnosis of hypopituitarism , hypothyroidism and binocular blindness in the course of septo - ocular dysplasia was admitted to the clinic of urology because of a large tumor of the left kidney .
the patient was 139 cm tall , weighed 52 kg and her bmi amounted to 27 kg / m2 .
her blood pressure was 120 / 70 mmhg , heart rate 70 / minute , creatinine levels 66 mumol / l , and her electrolytes , blood count and urinalysis were normal .
the lesion had been diagnosed incidentally in another medical centre during investigation of persistent stomach ache with a suspicion of pyelonephritis .
during case examination a perceptible mobile pathological resistance was reported on the left side of the stomach from the costal arch up to the iliac fossa .
on abdominal ultrasonography ( usg ) examination , a large , intra - abdominal and left flank heterogeneous tumor with dimensions 170 x 78 mm , mostly hyperechogenic ( consisting probably of adipose tissue with little vascularization observed in doppler color ) and probably coming out of the left kidney , was reported .
the right kidney was 108 mm long , with no urinary retention and no deposits .
the diagnostics were extended by computer tomography ( ct ) angiography of the abdomen with contrast , in which the following was stated : numerous amls in the left kidney , the biggest coming out from its lower part and affecting the whole paranephric space and going down to the level of iliac fossa with dimensions of about 226 x 95 x 104 mm. except for this the other intra - abdominal organs revealed no abnormalities ( figures 1 , 2 ) .
the patient qualified for surgical treatment .
the whole kidney with the entire tumor was removed ( figure 3 and figure 4 ) by performing a median transperitoneal incision .
due to the risk of serious bleeding , the priority was to reach the renal vessels .
the procedure was performed without any complications with the loss of 100 ml of blood .
further recovery proceeded without any complications .
histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of aml .

figure 4 a post - surgical specimen with a visible fragment of healthy renal parenchyma .
discussion aml is one of the rarely occurring solid tumors of the kidney ( 2 to 6 %) .
most frequently they are diagnosed by chance during imaging examinations and they do not reach large sizes .
they occur multifocally in about 1 / 3 and bilaterally in about 15 % of all cases .
they coexist with tuberous sclerosis ( bourneville - pringle disease ) with a frequency of about 20 % .
in such patients aml is diagnosed in 40 to 80 % with a 2 to 3 % risk of coexistence of renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) .
aml has a mild nature and it does not produce metastases .
most frequently it proceeds asymptomatically .
it may induce hematuria and uncharacteristic pain [ 1 - 3 ] .
the most serious and dangerous complication for health from aml is spontaneous bleeding into the retroperitoneal space from pathological vessels , referred to as wunderlich syndrome [ 7 ] .
diagnosis is based mainly on imaging examinations : usg and ct ( presence of adipose tissue within the tumor mass of density of 10 hounsfield units is a characteristic feature ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , angiography .
tumors larger than 4 cm are usually symptomatic and these are the tumors which require control every six months [ 8 ] .
the incidence of aml larger than 10 cm in individuals without a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis is extremely rare .
the commonly applied methods of treatment include : cryoablation , embolization , tumorectomy , partial resection of the kidney , or nephrectomy .
the choice and scope of treatment is determined by : tumor size , its vascularization , symptoms and comorbidities [ 9 ] .
septo - optic dysplasia ( de morsier syndrome ) is a syndrome of congenital defects which occurs at a frequency of 1:50,000 and which consists of : optic nerve hypoplasia , hypopituitarism , and agenesis of the septum pellucidum .
its etiology is multivariate and still not fully known .
recent reports claim a possible role of the hesx1 gene which is responsible for the development of the pituitary and central parts of the brain .
boys fall ill from this syndrome just as often as girls [ 10 ] .
so far , an increased frequency of coexistence of renal carcinomas , including aml , has not been described .
herein , we have presented the first case of a large aml in a patient with de morsier syndrome .
conclusions we have presented an extremely rare case of the coexistence of congenital defects in the form of septo - optic dysplasia associated with a giant renal aml .
the patient required a precise diagnostic work - up and radical surgical treatment .
consent written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images .

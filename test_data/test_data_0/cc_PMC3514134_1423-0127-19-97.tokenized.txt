background interleukin 12b ( il12b ) gene polymorphisms have been linked to several inflammatory diseases , but their role in the development of graves ophthalmopathy ( go ) in graves disease ( gd ) patients is unclear .
the purpose of this study was to investigate the disease association of il12b single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) .
methods a taiwan chinese population comprising 200 gd patients with go and 271 gd patients without go was genotyped using an allele - specific extension and ligation method .
hardy - weinberg equilibrium was estimated using the chi - square test .
allele and genotype frequencies were compared between gd patients with and without go using the chi - square test .
results the genotype and allele frequencies of examined snps did not differ between gd patients with and without go. although the genotype distribution remained nonsignificant in the sex - stratified analyses , the frequency of the t allele at snp rs1003199 was significantly higher in patients with go in the male cohort ( p = 6.00 x 10 - 3 ) .
in addition , haplotypes of il12b may be used to predict the risk of go ( p = 1.70 x 10 - 2 ) ; however , we could not prove the statistical significance of analysis after applying the bonferroni correction .
conclusions our results provide new information that the examined il12b gene polymorphisms may be associated with susceptibility to go in the taiwan chinese population in a sex - specific manner .
this conclusion requires further investigation .
background graves ophthalmopathy ( go ) is a type of fibroproliferative autoimmune disease , which is characterized by inflammation , remodeling , and expansion of the retroocular fibroblasts of the eye .
this disease commonly occurs in patients with graves disease ( gd ) and serves as a major characteristic that is observed in 25 - 50 % of patients with gd [ 1 - 5 ] .
although go may develop from the activity of thyroid - stimulating hormone ( tsh ) receptor - stimulating antibodies [ 6 - 9 ] , which are strongly associated with hyperthyroidism and go , the mechanisms linking gd and go remain largely elusive [ 10 - 12 ] .
recently , studies have suggested that cytokines may play a crucial role in regulating the development of gd and go [ 13 ] ; however , the detailed mechanisms thereof remain largely unclear .
interleukin 12b ( il12b ; omim 161561 ) , which is located on chromosomal region 5q33.3 , encodes the p40 subunit of the cytokines il12 and il23 , which play a pivotal role in both innate and adaptive immunity [ 14 ] .
although the role of interleukins in the development of go in gd patients is little known , thyroid hormones have been known to increase the secretion of il12 , which regulates dendritic cell maturation and function [ 15 ] .
il12 has been reported to be overexpressed during the active phase of gd and go [ 16,17 ] .
on the other hand , il23 expression could be induced in fibroblast - like synoviocytes through active il1b , a well - known go - related cytokine in rheumatoid arthritis , in ap - 1 - dependent and nuclear factor - kappa b - dependent pathways [ 18 - 21 ] .
these studies implied that p40 , which is encoded by il12b , might be involved in regulating inflammation .
to date , several single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) in il12b have been associated with various immune dysregulations such as systemic lupus erythematosus [ 22 ] , type 1 diabetes [ 23 ] , psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [ 24 ] , and gd [ 25 ] .
although the snps and expression of il12b may be associated with autoimmune thyroid diseases , especially gd and go in western male populations [ 26,27 ] , a genetic association between il12b and go in oriental populations has not been identified [ 28 ] .
the aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of il12b variants among gd patients and correlate it with the development of go in a taiwan chinese population .
methods patients a study population of 471 gd patients with or without go from china medical university hospital in taiwan were enrolled using the inclusion / exclusion criteria summarized in table 1 , which has been published elsewhere [ 18,29,30 ] .
all the methods followed the tenets of the declaration of helsinki .
all participants signed the consent form approved by the institutional review board of the china medical university hospital .
go was measured by the hertel exophthalmometer .
patients who satisfied the nospecs system recommended by the american thyroid association [ 31 ] were classified as the go group : ( 1 ) normal upper eyelid position 1.5 mm below the superior limbus and normal lower eyelid position at the level of the inferior limbus in primary gaze and ( 2 ) proptosis defined as the anteroposterior protrusion of the globe > 19 mm from the lateral orbital rim in either eye or any discrepancy in the degree of protrusion of both eyes by > 1 mm [ 32 ] .
those who did not satisfy both criteria were classified as the non - go group .
all individuals classified as affected were interviewed and examined by experienced clinicians .
table 1 inclusion / exclusion criteria criteria details inclusion patients must understand risks and benefits of the protocol and be able to give informed consent .
patient is a self - reported non - aboriginal taiwanese , and none of the parents and grand - parents has aboriginal background .
patients must satisfy the diagnostic criteria of graves disease at the time of examination .
exclusion patients typical clinical features of hyperthyroidism , diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland , increased free thyroxine or triiodothyronine levels , suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone levels , positive thyrotrophin - receptor autoantibodies , and with or without antimicrosomal or antithyroglobulin antibodies .
patient is unable to understand or give informed consent .
patients who had pregnancy or had delivered a baby / babies within one year .
snp selection il12b snp genotype information from the hapmap chb + jpt population was downloaded in december 2008 .
hapmap genotypes were analyzed within haploview , and tag snps were selected using the tagger function by applying ( i ) 0.1 as a threshold minor allele frequency ( maf ) for " tag snps " in the hapmap chb + jpt population and ( ii ) >= 0.6 as the illumina score as recommended by the manufacturer .
eight polymorphisms within the il12b gene were selected accordingly , including snps rs2195940 ( c / t at intron 5 ) , rs2853696 ( a / g at intron 5 ) , rs2421047 ( a / g at intron 4 ) , rs2853694 ( a / c at intron 3 ) , rs2569254 ( c / t at intron 1 ) , rs1003199 ( c / t at intron 1 ) , rs7709212 ( c / t at promoter ) , and rs6868898 ( c / t at promoter ) .
genomic dna extraction and genotyping blood samples were collected by venipuncture and were subsequently subjected to genomic dna isolation .
a genomic dna kit ( qiagen ) was used for genomic dna extraction .
the dna concentration of each sample was determined before genotyping .
all 8 snps in the il12b gene were analyzed using an allele - specific extension and ligation assay ( illumina ) following the manufacturer 's instructions .
statistical analysis sample size was determined according to the previous report [ 33 ] .
we set alpha as 0.05 , where 0 and 1 represent c and t respectively for alleles at rs1003199 , therefore the mean of all 198 male patients was 0.28 and the sd was 0.49 ) .
associations between each snp and go were assessed using the chi - square test .
an exact p value ( two - tailed ) < 0.05 with bonferroni adjustment ( threshold p value is 0.05 / n , where n is number of all independent tests at the same time ) [ 34 ] was considered statistically significant .
the allelic and genotypic frequencies were compared in gd patients with and without go , and the odds ratios ( ors ) per allele / genotype were estimated by applying unconditional logistic regression with a 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) .
all of the above statistical analyses were performed using pasw statistics 18.0 software .
ors per haplotype were calculated using haldane 's modification of woolf 's equation : or = [( a + 1 / 2 ) x ( d + 1 / 2 )]/[( b + 1 / 2 ) x ( c + 1 / 2 )] , where a , b , c , and d represent the affected number in the go group , the affected number in the non - go group , the non - affected number in the go group , and the non - affected number in the non - go group , respectively , to avoid problems when critical entries are zero [ 35 ] .
screening for linkage disequilibrium was performed using haploview ver .
4.1 [ 36 ] .
the best locus - locus interaction models were detected with an estimate testing accuracy of > 50 % consistency using the multifactor dimensionality reduction ( mdr ) 1.1.0 of the open - source mdr software package ( dartmouth medical school , hanover , nh ) .
the interaction dendrogram was established according to a hierarchical clustering algorithm [ 37 - 40 ] .
results genotypic frequencies of the il12b polymorphisms in gd patients all the samples from 471 gd patients were genotyped for the 8 snps in the il12b gene .
all of the tested snps in this study were found to be in hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( p > 0.05 , table 2 ) .
to identify the snps associated with clinical features of gd , including go , goiter , nodular hyperplasia , pretibial myxedema , and vitiligo , the 8 snps within the il12b gene were investigated .
none of these clinical features were associated with any of the tested il12b polymorphisms ( table 3 and data not shown ) .

ap values ( two - tailed ) were calculated using chi - square tests with 3x2 contingency tables ( genotypes ; 2 d.f. ) or 2x2 contingency tables ( alleles ; 1 d.f. ) .
the il12b polymorphism rs1003199 is significantly associated with the development of go in male gd patients in our study , there were many more female patients than male patients ( female : male , 3.8:1 ) .
because sex ratio is one variable that can affect the results of case - control association studies , a sex - stratification analysis was performed .
results showed that although no significant difference between il12b snps and go in the female patients was observed , snp rs1003199 was significantly associated with the development of go in the male gd patients : gd patients with the t allele at rs1003199 showed a 1.27 - fold increase in the risk of developing go compared with gd patients carrying the c allele ( p = 6.00 x 10 - 3 ; or = 2.27 , 95 % ci = 1.26 - 4.10 ; table 4 ) .
the sample size was large enough ( 198 individuals ) to detect the polymorphism ( alpha = 0.05 , power = 0.88 ) .
in addition , gd patients with a t / t genotype at rs1003199 showed a 7.85 - fold increase in the risk of developing go compared with gd patients carrying the c / c genotype ( p = 0.01 ; or = 8.85 , 95 % ci = 1.68 - 46.69 ; table 4 ) .
however , only the significance of the allele distribution at rs1003199 remained after applying the bonferroni correction .
these results indicate that male gd patients carrying the t allele might be at a higher risk for developing go than patients carrying other alleles , suggesting the possible role of il12b in the development of go in the male gd patients .

discussion several reports have documented that genetic factors may play a role in the development of go [ 12,13,41,42 ] : the susceptibility genes for go may include those encoding the major histocompatibility complex ( hla ) class i and class ii molecules [ 12 ] , cytotoxic t - lymphocyte - associated protein 4 ( ctla4 ) [ 12 ] , cell surface molecules intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( icam1 ) [ 43 ] , and integrin alpha e ( itgae ) [ 29 ] , as well as a variety of immunomodulatory genes , including those encoding the cytokines interferon gamma ( ifng ) [ 26,44 ] , tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) [ 26,45 ] , and interleukin 1 beta ( il1b ) [ 18 - 20 ] .
il12b has been identified to possibly influence the development of autoimmune thyroid diseases and the related ophthalmopathy in male patients in the western world [ 26,27 ] , but it has not yet been deeply examined in oriental patients [ 28 ] .
in this study , we investigated whether il12b snps contributed to the development of go in a taiwan chinese gd population .
the results show that none of the tested il12b snps were associated with any manifestations of gd. however , the t allele at snp rs1003199 was significantly associated with the occurrence of go in male patients .
our results , in part , support the hypothesis that snps of pro - inflammatory cytokines may be related to go development .
theoretical and practical studies suggested that mdr has reasonable power for detecting interactions .
compared to the conventional statistical approaches , mdr was a novel , nonparametric , and genetic model - free approach that was developed specifically to detect not only interactions within or among genes but also interactions between genes and the environment .
the mdr method has been used in several diseases such as cancers and inherited diseases [ 46,47 ] .
however , a disadvantage of this method is that it overemphasizes the large dissimilarities and does not appropriately represent the small dissimilarities .
here , we used the mdr method to identify the interaction between 3 snps , including rs1003199 in intron 1 and rs7709212 and rs6868898 in the promoter , and go. in addition , our preliminary results from a database search ( mirbase , http :// www.mirbase.org / search.shtml ) suggest that these snps may be mirna targets .
the c allele at rs6868898 showed higher similarity with mirna sequences than the t allele at rs6868898 .
moreover , only the t allele at rs1003199 and the t allele at rs7709212 , but not the c allele at rs1003199 and the c allele at rs7709212 , showed a similarity with mirna sequences ( additional file 1 ). whether these snps , as well as haplotypes , play a role in the development of go by regulating the expression of the il12b gene or the stability of the mrna by mirna needs further investigation .
the snp rs6887695 , which is located in the promoter region of the il12b gene , may be associated with go [ 26,27 ] .
although it was not selected under our snp criteria , we also tried to analyze its genotype distribution in our patients , but we failed to find a statistically significant association between snp rs6887695 and go. ethnic differences may be a reason for this discrepancy .
although the results presented here provide new information that may facilitate the understanding of the pathogenesis of go , additional studies are necessary to confirm this finding in a larger sample and ideally , in a second group of affected and unaffected individuals .
the results of this study also provide novel information for identifying the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of go. it has long been established that go is a complex disease with a variety of weak - effect genes that are influenced by a wide range of environmental factors such as sex , iodine status , smoking , infectious agents , and stress .
however , the reasons for the significant female preponderance of gd and go are not well understood , but they may include skewed x chromosome inactivation [ 48 ] , fetal microchimerism [ 49 ] , or sex hormone effects [ 50 ] .
in view of the significant sex - specific variation in go , genetic factors may influence the establishment of differential risk between affected women and men .
this study demonstrated that the polymorphisms of the il12b gene may influence the development of go. however , because of the lack of a larger sample size and published functional studies on these polymorphisms , the mechanisms of the associated polymorphisms need to be fully examined for their capacity to alter the go phenotype .
in addition , to confirm the disease - associated snps , further investigations on the role of the il12b gene in go development at the molecular level are warranted .
conclusion in summary , this study showed that the il12b polymorphisms may be associated with go in taiwan chinese gd patients in a sex - specific manner. whether these results can provide valuable insights requires further genetic and biological studies of the specific snps and haplotypes .

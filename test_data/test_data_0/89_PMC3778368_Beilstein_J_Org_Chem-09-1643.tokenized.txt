the structures of the compounds , isolated along with the known theonellapeptolide id , were determined by extensive 2d nmr and ms / ms analyses followed by application of marfey 's method .
the isolated peptides exhibited moderate antiproliferative activity against hepg2 cells , a hepatic carcinoma cell line .
antiproliferative activity cyclic peptides marine metabolites theonellapeptolides 2d nmr this article is part of the thematic series " natural products in synthesis and biosynthesis " .
introduction three decades of extensive chemical investigation [ 1 ] have clearly evidenced that marine sponges of the genus theonella ( lithistida , theonellidae ) are treasure troves of secondary metabolites .
the chemical diversity of the isolated compounds ranges from unusual steroids ( exemplified by the 4 - methylene sterol theonellasterol [ 2 - 3 ] and truncated side - chain sulfated steroids [ 4 ]) , to complex macrocyclic polyketides ( as the well - known swinholide a , now a reference compound in the class of actin interacting cell growth inhibitors [ 5 ]) , polyene derivatives ( as aurantosides [ 6 ]) , and polypeptides / depsipeptides .
the biosynthesis of several secondary metabolites of theonella has been ascribed to symbiotic microorganisms , as in the case of the polyketide onnamide [ 7 ] and the polypeptide polytheonamide [ 8 ] .
it is , however , not unreasonable to presume that a symbiotic role in the production of secondary metabolites could be crucial in many other cases .
probably the most distinctive class of secondary metabolites of theonella is given by complex polypeptides whose uncommon amino acids have been postulated to have either nonribosomal ( nr ) or post - translationally modified ribosomal ( pmr ) origin [ 8 ] .
several classes of theonella polypeptides have been isolated to date , and they often show peculiar features such as largely rearranged amino acidic units , either d - or l - configurations at the alpha - carbons , and the formation of macrocycles through amide or ester bonds .
to categorize the plethora of theonella polypeptides we could identify at least eight structural types : theonellamides ( glycosylated imidazole - containing macrocycles ) [ 9 ] , keramamides ( including oxazole or thiazole rings ) [ 10 ] , papuamides ( hiv inhibitory macrocyclic depsipeptides ) [ 11 ] , polytheonamides ( cytotoxic linear polypeptides ) [ 12 ] , cyclotheonamides ( thrombin and serine protease inhibitors ) [ 13 ] , perthamides ( anti - inflammatory cyclopeptides ) [ 14 - 15 ] , solomonamides [ 16 ] and theonellapeptolides ( cyclic tridecapeptides including several n - methylated and d - amino acids ) [ 17 ] .
in the context of our long - standing interest for bioactive secondary metabolites from marine invertebrates , we have recently investigated a specimen of t. swinhoei collected off the coasts of manado ( north sulawesi , indonesia ) , which proved to be rich in aurantosides [ 6 ] and 4 - methylene steroids [ 18 ] , while polyketide macrolides and peptide - based derivatives were extremely rare if not absent .
remarkably , the chemical analysis of a different specimen of t. swinhoei , collected in the same area as the previous one , exhibited an extremely different secondary metabolite composition .
in particular , this second specimen has been found to be rich in polypeptides and , from the chcl3 phase of the organic extract , we have identified the major member of this class as theonellapeptolide id ( 1 ) ( fig. 1 ) .
in this paper we report the results of the chemical analysis of the polypeptide - containing fraction , which resulted in the isolation of two new theonellapeptolides , namely sulfinyltheonellapeptolide ( 2 ) and theonellapeptolide if ( 3 ) ( fig. 2 ) .
we describe the structural elucidation of these new metabolites and the results of the preliminary pharmacological evaluation of the isolated compounds on hepg2 cells ( hepatocarcinoma cell line ) .

results and discussion theonella swinhoei was collected in the bunaken marine park of manado ( north sualwesi , indonesia ) in january 2010 and frozen immediately after collection .
the frozen material was repeatedly extracted with methanol , and the crude extract was subjected to a modified kupchan 's partitioning procedure [ 19 ] to obtain n - hexane , chcl3 and n - buoh extracts .
the chcl3 extract was chromatographed by silica gel mplc , and fractions eluted with ch2cl2 / meoh 97:3 were further purified by hplc on nucleodur or ascentis reversed - phase columns ( eluent meoh / h2o 87:13 ) to obtain the known theonellapeptolide id ( 1 , 68.5 mg ) , and the new analogues sulfinyltheonellapeptolide ( 2 , 4.6 mg ) and theonellapeptolide if ( 3 , 2.1 mg ) ( fig. 2 ) .
the known compound was identified on the basis of the comparison of its spectroscopic data with those published in the literature [ 17 ] .
theonellapeptolides are tridecapeptide lactones characterized by the presence of aliphatic and non - polar amino acids including high ratio of d - amino acids , n - methyl amino acids , and beta - amino acids .
in particular , the structure of theonellapeptolide id ( 1 ) includes three beta - ala , three d - leu ( one n - methylated ) , two l - val ( one n - methylated ) , one l - meala , one l - thr , one l - meile , and two d - alloile ( one n - methylated ) units .
sulfinyltheonellapeptolide ( 2 , [ alpha ] d - 38.1 , c 0.1 , meoh ) was isolated as a colorless amorphous solid with pseudomolecular ion peaks at m / z 1423 [ m + h ]+ and 1445 [ m + na ]+ in the esims , and high - resolution analysis established the molecular formula c69h123n13o16s .
inspection of its 1h nmr spectrum ( cd3od , table 1 ) clearly suggested the peptide nature of 2 and placed it into the theonellapeptolide class .
given this characterization of 2 the presence of the sulfur atom in the molecular formula appeared especially remarkable .
in particular , the 1h and 13c nmr data of 2 indicated the presence of six methyl singlets ( deltah 2.77 , 2.79 , 3.22 , 3.30 , 3.31 , and 3.35 ) and fourteen carbonyl groups ( resonating from deltac 166.5 to 177.0 ) .
extensive analysis of homonuclear and heteronuclear 2d nmr spectra including 1h / 1h cosy , 1h / 1h tocsy , 1h / 13c hsqc and 1h / 13c hmbc allowed us to overcome the difficulty posed by the severe signal overlap in the 1h nmr spectrum and to establish the presence of three beta - ala , three leu ( one n - methylated ) , two ile ( both n - methylated ) , three val ( one n - methylated ) , one thr , and one n - methylala , the same amino acid composition as in theonellapeptolide id ( 1 ) except for one residue .
the above analysis left unassigned a methyl singlet at deltah 2.79 ( deltac 39.2 ) and a pair of mutually coupled doublets at deltah 3.67 and 3.86 , with these latter signals showing hmbc correlations both with the methyl carbon at deltac 39.2 and an amide carbonyl resonating at deltac 166.5 .
the 1h and 13c nmr chemical shift values of both the methyl and the methylene groups strongly suggested their linkage to a sulfoxide group , and the presence of a methylsulfinylacetyl ( mes ( o ) ac ) subunit was also in full agreement with the molecular formula .
the amino acid sequence of 2 was then disclosed by careful analysis of the pattern of hmbc correlations , whose key cross - peaks are shown in fig. 3. the cross - peak of the thr low - field shifted beta - ch ( deltah 5.19 ) with the me - ile carbonyl group revealed the presence of an ester linkage .

figure 3 cosy and key hmbc correlations ( left ) and ms / ms fragmentations of 2 and its ring - opened methanolysis product , respectively .
hmbc analysis also revealed that the amide carbonyl at deltac 166.5 assigned to the methylsulfinylacetyl subunit was correlated to the halpha of val - 1 residue , thus establishing the acetylation of the n - terminus in 2 .
methanolysis of 2 , followed by esi ( positive ion mode ) ms / ms analysis of the obtained acyclic methyl ester derivative provided key fragment peaks , shown in fig. 3 , giving definitive confirmation of the sulfinyltheonellapeptolide gross structure .
in addition to the pseudomolecular ion at m / z 1454 [ m + h ]+ , corresponding to the introduction of 32 mass units ( meoh ) in the molecule , the esims / ms spectrum provided several fragment ion peaks corresponding to n - terminus fragments due to the cleavage of the amide bond , and referred to as the b series in roepstorff and fohlman nomenclature [ 20 ] .
in particular , the presence of the b2 fragmentation peak at m / z 331 supported , once again , the presence of the mes ( o ) ac unit .
complete acid hydrolysis of 2 and marfey 's analysis [ 21 ] on the hydrolysate ( derivatization with l - fdaa , 1 - fluoro - 2,4 - dinitrophenyl - 5 - l - alanine amide , followed by lc - ms comparison with the fdaa derivatives of appropriate standards ) enabled us to determine the configuration of the chiral amino acid residues as l - meala , d - leu ( x2 ) , d - meleu , l - thr , l - me - val , l - me - ile , d - me - allo - ile , d - val and l - val .
this result left the ambiguity on the localization of the two methylisoleucine residues and of the two enantiomeric valine residues .
since the 1h and 13c nmr resonances for the amino acids at positions 5 - 10 and 36 - 41 of 2 were almost superimposable with the corresponding values reported for theonellapeptolide id ( 1 ) [ 22 ] , we assumed that the two peptides share the configurations at those positions , thus inferring the configurations of the two isoleucine residues .
similarly , it appeared reasonable to assume that , as in the co - occurring theonellapeptolide id ( and in all the theonellapeptolide found to date ) , the l - val could be the n - terminal amino acid and thus , the d - val should be the amino acid at positions 28 - 32 .
a d - val residue at these positions has been found previously in the structure of theonellapeptolide ia [ 23 ] .
the configuration at the stereogenic sulfur atom of 2 has been left undetermined .
theonellapeptolide if ( 3 , [ alpha ] d - 26.7 , c 1.0 , meoh ) was isolated as a colorless amorphous solid and its molecular formula was established to be c68h121n13o16 by means of high resolution esims .
inspection of 1h and 13c nmr spectra of 3 ( cd3od , table 2 ) revealed extensive similarities with parallel data detected for 2 .
the most important differences could be recognized in the downfield shift of one methyl singlet ( from deltah 2.79 , deltac 39.2 in 2 to deltah 3.38 , deltac 59.1 in 3 ) and of a pair of mutually coupled doublets ( from deltah 3.67 and 3.86 , deltac 58.9 in 2 to deltah 3.88 and 3.97 , deltac 71.8 in 3 ) .
these data were easily rationalized with the replacement of the terminal methylsulfinylacetyl group with a methoxyacetyl group , a typical n - terminus acylating unit , already found in the theonellapeptolide family .

careful inspection of cosy and tocsy spectra revealed also that , in agreement with the molecular formula , one isoleucine residue of 2 is replaced by a valine residue in 3 .
a subsequent combined analysis of homonuclear and heteronuclear 2d nmr spectra disclosed the presence of the following residues : three beta - ala , three leu ( one n - methylated ) , one n - methyl - ile , four val ( two n - methylated ) , one thr , and one n - methylala .
as detailed for 2 , the amino acid sequence of 3 was deduced by careful analysis of hmbc correlations and supported by the ms / ms spectrum of the methanolysis product mixture ( see supporting information file 1 ) .
thus , theonellapeptolide if ( 3 ) has been identified as a new member of the theonellapeptolide family differing from theonellapeptolide id ( 1 ) by the replacement of two isoleucine residues ( positions 5 - 10 and 28 - 32 ) with valine residues .
complete acid hydrolysis of 3 and marfey 's analysis [ 21 ] on the hydrolysate mixture provided the configuration of the chiral amino acid residues as l - meala , d - leu ( x2 ) , d - meleu , l - thr , l - me - ile , d - me - val , d - val , l - me - val and l - val. with these data in hands , it was not possible to unambiguously define the exact localization of the valine residues .
however , if we assume that the l - val and l - me - val residues are localized at the same positions as in theonellapeptolide id , then the positions of their enantiomeric counterparts are consequently deduced .
in summary , compound 3 is a valine - rich theonellapeptolide , being the first member of this class to possess four valine residues .
theonellapeptolides are structurally similar to the widely used immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin a , sharing at least three important features : i ) the exclusive presence of hydrophobic aliphatic amino acids ; ii ) the abundance of n - methylated residues and iii ) the presence of a macrocycle made up by more than ten amino acids .
only a few theonellapeptolides have been tested for immunosuppressive activity and they revealed a moderate potency [ 25 ] .
in general , the potential bioactivity of this class of unique cyclopeptides has not been investigated in great detail , and an inhibition of the development of fertilized eggs of sea urchin [ 26 ] , an activity on the transport of na + and k + ions [ 23 ] , and a moderate cytotoxicity [ 23 ] have been reported .
the three theonellapeptolides isolated during the present investigation ( 1 - 3 ) have been evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against hepg2 cells , a hepatic carcinoma cell line .
as reported in fig. 4 , all tested compounds showed antiproliferative activity at low micromolar doses , with a similar pattern of potency .
at the dose 10 mum , the proliferation rate of hepg2 cells was significantly reduced by theonallapeptolide id ( 1 ) , sulfinyltheonellapeptolide ( 2 ) and theonellapeptolide if ( 3 ) to about 50 % , 30 % and 50 % , respectively ( fig. 4 , panels a , b and c ; * p < 0.05 compared to untreated cells ; n = 4 ) .
only theonellapeptolide id was able to significantly reduce the proliferation at 1 mum .
at this dose , the proliferation reduction was equal to 20 % ( fig. 4 , panel a ; * p < 0.05 compared to untreated cells ; n = 4 ) .
computation of 50 % inhibitory drug concentration ( ic50 ) revealed that compounds 1 , 2 and 3 were characterized by very similar ic50 values of about 1.5 mum for theonellapeptolide id and 3 mum for sulfinyltheonellapeptolide and theonellapeptolide if. figure 4 antiproliferative activity of theonellapeptolides 1 - 3 on hepatic carcinoma cell line .

conclusion in conclusion , the chemical analysis of the organic extract of an indonesian theonella swinhoei allowed the isolation of two new members of the theonellapeptolide family , namely sulfinyltheonellapeptolide , characterized by a methylsulfinylacetyl group at the n - terminus , and theonellapeptolide if , the first member of this class to show four valine residues .

evaluation of antiproliferative activity : hepg2 cells were plated in a 24 - wells plate at 3 x 104 cells / well , in minimum essential medium with earl 's salts containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) , 1 % l - glutamine and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin .
on day 2 , cells were treated with increasing doses of theonellapeptolide id ( 0.1 , 1 and 10 mum ) , sulfinyltheonellapeptolide ( 0.1 , 1 and 10 mum ) and theonellapeptolide if ( 0.1 , 1 and 10 mum ) for 48 hours .
on day 4 , a mtt assay was assessed : 100 mul of mtt solution ( 5mg / ml ) were added to each well and the cells were incubated at 37 degreesc for 4 hours .
after the incubation , the culture medium was removed and 1 ml of dmso was added to each well .
the absorbance was read by using a spectrophotometer at 590 nm. the proliferation rate was reported as the delta of absorbance compared to untreated cells , and values are expressed as mean +/ - standard error .
experiments were performed in quadruplicate .
for each compound the ic50 value was evaluated as follows : the inhibition of proliferation was expressed as percentage compared to the inhibition of proliferation observed at the highest dose of any experimental setting ( which was arbitrarily assigned a value of 100 %) .

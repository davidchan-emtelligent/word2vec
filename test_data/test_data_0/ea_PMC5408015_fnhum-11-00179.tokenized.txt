alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) , the most common cause of dementia in the elderly , results in the impairment of executive function , including that of performance monitoring .
feedback - related negativity ( frn ) is an electrophysiological measure reflecting the activity of this monitoring system via feedback signals , and is generated from the anterior cingulate cortex .
however , there have been no reports on frn in ad. based on prior aging studies , we hypothesized that frn would decrease in ad patients .
to assess this , frn was measured in healthy individuals and those with ad during a simple gambling task involving positive and negative feedback stimuli .
contrary to our hypothesis , frn amplitude increased in ad patients , compared with the healthy elderly .
we speculate that this may reflect the existence of a compensatory mechanism against the decline in executive function .
also , there was a significant association between frn amplitude and depression scores in ad , and the frn amplitude tended to increase insomuch as the self - rating depression scale ( sds ) was higher .
this result suggests the existence of a negative bias in the affective state in ad. thus , the impaired functioning monitoring system in ad is a more complex phenomenon than we thought .
alzheimer 's disease monitoring systems feedback - related negativity depression aging introduction executive function is a set of cognitive processes including attentional control , working memory and planning , and so on , and is necessary for selecting and successfully monitoring behavior ( alvarez and emory , 2006 ; chan et al. , 2008 ; diamond , 2013 ) .
executive function is impaired in individuals with dementia , including those suffering from alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) ( collette et al. , 1999 ; perry and hodges , 1999 ) .
monitoring is a part of the executive function , and is the ability to monitor one 's own actions and responses during task performance in order to detect and correct errors .
impairment of executive function in ad patients is involved in the failure of self - monitoring ( ott et al. , 1996 ) , which may underlie subtle difficulties in coping with daily activities ( perry and hodges , 1999 ) .
it has been suggested that deficits in self - monitoring occur after damage to the frontal lobes and other cerebral areas ( ott et al. , 1996 ) .
feedback - related negativity ( frn ) is a neurophysiological index that reflects the monitoring process associated with feedback inputs .
frn has been shown to be elicited by feedback stimuli ( particularly negative stimuli ) in a gambling task ( gehring , 2002 ; hajcak et al. , 2006 ; holroyd et al. , 2006 ) and a time production task ( miltner et al. , 1997 ; wild - wall et al. , 2009 ; becker et al. , 2014 ) .
this negative potential appears at a latency of 200 - 300 ms after feedback ( miltner et al. , 1997 ; falkenstein et al. , 2000 ; gehring , 2002 ; holroyd and coles , 2002 ; nieuwenhuis et al. , 2004 ) , and is primarily distributed over the frontal - central scalp area .
generally , frn means the negative peak obtained by subtracting the waveform for the positive feedback from that for the negative feedback , or the negative waveform obtained from the negative feedback .
a great amount of evidence indicates that frn is generated in the anterior cingulate cortex ( holroyd and coles , 2002 ; hajcak et al. , 2007 ; bellebaum and daum , 2008 ; holroyd et al. , 2009 ) .
frn codes negative prediction errors in the context of varying reword probabilities and magnitudes ( cohen et al. , 2007 ; bellebaum and daum , 2008 ; wu and zhou , 2009 ; bellebaum et al. , 2010 ) .
as with other components of event - related evoked potentials ( erps ) , many studies have revealed that frn amplitude is reduced and its latency prolonged in the elderly compared to that in young individuals ( eppinger et al. , 2008 ; mathewson et al. , 2008 ; wild - wall et al. , 2009 ; hammerer et al. , 2011 ; pietschmann et al. , 2011a ) , although some studies show no such age differences in frn ( bellebaum et al. , 2011 ) .
however , in line with the frn aging effects , ad patients might show alterations of frn .
however , no reports have investigated the changes in frn in ad patients .
error - related negativity ( ern ) is an erp component elicited by an individual 's own behavioral errors .
ern measures may also provide insights to the monitoring system .
some reports have demonstrated that ern amplitude decreases in older participants ( gehring and knight , 2000 ; falkenstein et al. , 2001 ; nieuwenhuis et al. , 2002 ; pietschmann et al. , 2011a,b ; schreiber et al. , 2011 ; endrass et al. , 2012 ) , and is further reduced in ad patients with prolonged latency ( mathalon et al. , 2003 ) .
considering its similarity to ern , this evidence suggests that frn should also demonstrate decreased amplitude and delayed latency in ad patients .
p300 is a positive component at the dominantly parietal area approximately 300 ms after stimulus onset ( sutton et al. , 1965 ) , and is elicited typically by an oddball task , i.e. , auditory , visual , olfactory or somatosensory stimuli ( yamaguchi and knight , 1991a,b ; frodl et al. , 2002 ; polich , 2004 ; bennys et al. , 2007 ; golob et al. , 2007 ) .
this component reflects various cognitive processes , including context updating ( donchin , 1981 ; polich , 2007 ) , resource allocation ( wickens et al. , 1983 ; kramer et al. , 1985 ; polich , 2007 ) , memory encoding ( karis et al. , 1984 ; fabiani et al. , 1990 ; johnson , 1995 ; polich , 2007 ) and attention , stimulus evaluation , judgment and decision - making ( becker and shapiro , 1980 ; duncan - johnson and donchin , 1982 ; kramer and strayer , 1988 ; katada et al. , 2004 ; gironell et al. , 2005 ) .
there are many regions in the brain , especially in the parietal , temporal , prefrontal cortex and hippocampus , that contribute to its generation ( yamaguchi and knight , 1991a ; halgren et al. , 1998 ; tarkka and stokic , 1998 ; kirino et al. , 2000 ; kiehl et al. , 2001 ) .
p300 amplitude and latency are modulated by a variety of factors , including subjective probability of stimuli , stimulus saliency , availability of attentional resources ( kutas et al. , 1977 ; polich , 1986 ; kramer and strayer , 1988 ; gonsalvez and polich , 2002 ) , and memory performance ( fabiani et al. , 1990 ; johnson , 1995 ) .
p300 has been proposed as one of the electrophysiological biomarkers of dementia ( olichney et al. , 2011 ; howe et al. , 2014 ) , and its usefulness has been well documented in the early diagnosis of dementia ( polich et al. , 1990 ; juckel et al. , 2008 ; ahiskali et al. , 2009 ; chapman et al. , 2011 ; vecchio and maatta , 2011 ) .
elderly people show a decreased amplitude and prolonged latency of p300 , and these changes are more pronounced in dementia ( polich and corey - bloom , 2005 ; bennys et al. , 2007 ; lai et al. , 2010 ; parra et al. , 2012 ) .
we speculate that these findings regarding p300 may also be applicable to feedback stimuli .
previous studies have also claimed that frn and p300 encode different aspects of outcome evaluations ( yeung and sanfey , 2004 ) .
these suggest that outcome evaluation can be roughly divided into two related processes : one is an early evaluation of the cognitive or motivational significance of feedback stimuli , which relates to frn ; and the other is a more elaborative evaluation of feedback stimuli , which is affected by the allocation of attentional resources such as intentionality or expectancy and is related to p300 .
furthermore , other research has reported that frn is sensitive not only to reward valence and magnitude , but also to expectancy towards reward magnitude .
while p300 is sensitive to both feedback valence and reward magnitude , this sensitivity can be modulated by expectancy towards reward magnitude ( wu and zhou , 2009 ) .
these findings suggest that frn may play a role as a general mechanism that evaluates whether an outcome is consistent or inconsistent with expectations ; whereas p300 is sensitive to the later , top - down controlled process of outcome evaluation , which links with the allocation of attentional resources , including reward valence , reward magnitude and magnitude expectancy .
in ad patients , these processes of outcome evaluation for feedback stimulus are considered to be impaired .
accordingly , we investigated the monitoring system of ad patients using a neurophysiological measure ( i.e. , frn ) , in a gambling task .
we hypothesized that , compared with healthy elderly people and healthy young people , the amplitude of frn would be reduced , and latency delayed in ad patients due to disruption of feedback processing .
materials and methods participants twenty - four patients with ( ad ; 15 males , 9 females , age range from 66 to 75 , mean age = 71.5 , sd = 2.8 ) , 20 healthy older subjects ( ho ; 13 males , 10 females , age range from 62 to 79 , mean age = 69.6 , sd = 6.0 ) , and 19 healthy young subjects ( hy ; 10 males , 9 females , age range from 19 to 28 , mean age = 22.2 , sd = 2.2 ) participated in this study .
the ad patients met the national institute of neurological and communicative disorders and stroke and the ad and related disorders association ( nincds / adrda ) criteria for individuals with ad. their scores on the mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) were 19.3 +/ - 3.9 , and on the clinical dementia rating ( cdr ) were 1.1 +/ - 0.4 , ( 21 patients for cdr 1 , and 3 patients for cdr 2 ) .
all participants had normal or corrected - to - normal vision .
virtually all participants were right - handed , with three exceptions ( one in each group ) .
participants in the ho and hy groups had no history of neurological or psychiatric diseases .
finally , this study was approved by the ethics committee of the shimane university .
all participants provided signed informed consent following our explanation of the study 's purpose and protocols .
neuropsychological assessment ad and ho participants were assessed using neuropsychological test batteries that included the mini mental state examination ( mmse ; folstein et al. , 1975 ) , the frontal assessment battery ( fab ; dubois et al. , 2000 ) , the word fluency test ( wft ; vegetable for the semantic category ) , the self - rating depression scale ( sds ; zung , 1965 ) , and the apathy scale ( as ; okada et al. , 1998 ) .
these assessments were conducted by a trained clinical researcher within the 2 - week period before the erp experiment .
task , stimuli and procedure in the experiment conducted for this study , each participant performed a simple gambling task ( figure 1 ) .
participants were comfortably seated approximately 1.5 m in front of a computer screen in an electrically shielded and sound - attenuated room .
at the start of each trial , a depiction of the choice display was presented on a screen , which lasted until a participant made a response .
the picture consisted of two colored squares with green and purple presented on the left and right screen sides respectively , and the relationship between the color and position was consistently maintained for all individuals .
we instructed participants that they could win money by correctly choosing one of the squares .
participants then chose one of the two squares by pressing one of two corresponding buttons ( i.e. , left or right ) .
a feedback stimulus appeared 1.5 s after the choice picture was turned off , and lasted for 1 s. the feedback stimulus consisted of a display of a win or loss .
if the selected box was a win , a 100 yen ( about 1 usd ) coin appeared in the center of the screen .
if the selected box was a loss , a 100 yen coin was presented with a superimposed red x. the next trial started following an inter - trial interval of 2 - 3 s. the experiment consisted of 120 trials ( two blocks of 60 trials each ) .
the probabilities of winning and losing for each option was equal ( 50 %) , and this was same in all three groups .
participants were told that they would be participating in a virtual game ; they were instructed to try to maximize their monetary rewards .
participants performed 10 practice trials before the experiment .
total task duration including 2 blocks and rest was about 15 - 20 min , and the whole experiment including the installation and removal of electrodes lasted about 1 h. figure 1 trial procedure for the gambling task .
electroencephalography ( eeg ) recording and data reduction the electroencephalogram ( eeg ) was obtained from 21 ag / agcl electrodes at the positions of the international 10 - 20 system : midline ( fpz , fz , cz , pz , oz ) ; frontal ( fp1 , fp2 , f3 , f4 , f7 , f8 ) ; central ( c3 , c4 ) ; temporal ( t3 , t4 , t5 , t6 ) ; parietal ( p3 , p4 ) ; occipital ( o1 , o2 ) ; and was referenced to the linked mastoids .
horizontal and vertical electrooculograms ( eog ) were recorded at sites lateral to the left and right outer canthi , and above and below each eye .
impedances were kept below 5 komega for each electrode .
the eeg signals were recorded using the brainamp amplifier ( brain products , munich , germany ) with appropriate software .
the eeg signals were recorded continuously with a band pass set at 0.01 - 250 hz , and a sampling frequency of 500 hz. in addition , each participant 's reaction time ( rt ) was measured simultaneously with the eeg recording .
event - related potentials ( erps ) eeg data were analyzed off - line using the brainvision analyzer 2 software ( brain products , munich , germany ) .
an independent component analysis ( ica ) was performed on single - subject eeg data in order to correct for blink artifacts .
all segments exceeding +/ - 100 muv were rejected as artifacts .
eeg epochs were extracted beginning 200 ms before and ending 800 ms after the presentation of feedback for win and loss conditions , separately .
a baseline was set at the duration of 200 ms prior to feedback stimulus onset .
erp peak amplitude and latency were derived from each individual 's average waveform .
the frn was semi - automatically measured as the most negative peak within the time window of 150 - 400 ms after feedback presentation , and was finally identified by visual inspection .
p300 was measured as the most positive peak within the time window of 300 - 600 ms in the same way .
the additional frn measures were computed for each participant by subtracting the waveform after positive feedback from that after negative feedback .
the peak amplitudes and latencies of the components were derived from the resulting difference wave within the time window of 150 - 450 ms. statistics we conducted t - tests on the demographic ( except for the chi2 test for sex ) and neuropsychological data to allow comparison of ad and ho. to check each participant 's understanding of the task , we calculated switching response ratios following negative and positive feedback , respectively .
a higher switching ratio for negative feedback than for positive feedback means that participants had a tendency to avoid the option with the last negative feedback , and were able to understand the gambling task .
therefore , we compared the switching ratios between preceding negative and positive feedback using paired t - tests in each group .
a one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) was used to analyze the rt data , and a two - way repeated measures anova ( group x channel , or group x feedback condition ) was performed ( separately ) for the amplitudes and latency of erp components .
the statistical criterion was set at a p value of less than 0.05 , and tukey method analysis was used for post hoc tests .
partial correlation analyses were also conducted to examine the relationships between the erp components and the neuropsychological data .
results neuropsychological and behavioral data the background , neuropsychological and behavior data are summarized in table 1 .
there were no significant differences in age and gender ratios between ad and ho. however , independent t tests revealed that there were significant differences between ad and ho on the cognitive function scores ( mmse , fab , wft ) , and that ad showed reduced cognitive function compared to ho ( ts ( 45 ) > 5.0 , ps < 0.001 ) .
however , affective function scores did not differ between those groups ( ts ( 45 ) < 1.9 , ps > 0.068 ) .
rt in the gambling task was delayed significantly in ad and ho compared to that in hy ( ps < 0.001 ) .
switching response ratio was higher for the following negative feedback than positive feedback in every three groups ( ps < 0.05 ) .

erp waveforms figure 2 presents the feedback - locked erp waveforms at the three midline sites , fz , cz and pz , for positive and negative conditions in each group .
in both conditions , frn appeared at a latency range of 200 - 400 ms , and p300 appeared at a latency of 300 - 500 ms. a difference in frn amplitude between the positive and negative conditions was observed clearly at fz , cz and pz in ad. the frn difference in hy was also as apparent as that in ad , but not in ho. on the other hand , p300 amplitude was reduced markedly in ad. the p300 amplitude in hy was the largest among the three groups , and p300 in ho was lower than that observed in the hy group .

frn in difference waves the upper row in figure 4 presents the frn peak amplitude ( left panel ) and peak latency ( right panel ) for the three groups ; table 2 gives the anova results .
the anova revealed that the main effect of group for amplitude was significant ( f ( 2,63 ) = 4.1 , epsilon = 0.69 , p = 0.021 ) .
post hoc tests indicated the amplitude in ad was significantly larger than that in ho ( p = 0.015 ) .
however , the main effect of channel did not reach significance ( f ( 2,63 ) = 3.0 , epsilon = 0.69 , p = 0.053 ) , nor was interaction of group by channel significant ( f ( 4,126 ) = 1.2 , epsilon = 0.69 , p = 0.296 ) .

there was a tendency for the amplitude to be larger for negative feedback than for positive feedback at cz and pz in hy ( ps < 0.087 ) , while there was no significant difference between the two types of feedback in ad and ho. with regard to latency , significant interactions of group by condition were observed at cz and pz ( fs ( 4,126 ) > 3.3 , ps < 0.043 ) .
post hoc tests indicated that latency was delayed in ad and ho compared with hy in both positive and negative conditions ( ps < 0.032 ) .
additionally , latency in ad was more prolonged than ho for negative feedback ( ps < 0.032 ) , but this was not the case for positive feedback .
correlation between neuropsychology and erp we also performed correlation analyses between the neuropsychological data and the erp measurements for groups ad and ho ( table 4 , figure 5 ) ; and found that there was a significant association between the frn amplitude in difference waves and sds at cz in ad ( r = - 0.495 , p = 0.023 ) , but not in ho ( r = 0.227 , p = 0.309 ) .
a direct comparison revealed that the correlation coefficients of the two groups differed significantly ( p < 0.05 ) .
there were significant correlations between frn amplitude and wft scores in ad for both conditions ( rs > 0.46 , ps < 0.05 ) .
p300 amplitudes were positively correlated with wft scores in both conditions in ad ( ps < 0.05 ) , and positive feedback in hc ( ps < 0.01 ) .

diamond and thick solid line : ad , circle and dashed line : ho. discussion the aim of this study was to examine the changes in the monitoring system of ad patients and healthy control participants ( ho ) during gambling tasks using frn .
results reveal that the ad group showed a larger amplitude and a delayed latency of frn compared to the ho group , and the frn amplitude correlated with cognitive function scores .
this study revealed electrophysiological abnormalities of the monitoring function in ad. however , the increased amplitude of frn in ad was unexpected .
it is the opposite of predictions made from the original hypothesis .
the original hypothesis relating to changes in frn for the ad group was based on prior evidence of aging effects on frn .
many researchers have reported decreases in frn amplitude associated with aging ( eppinger et al. , 2008 ; mathewson et al. , 2008 ; wild - wall et al. , 2009 ; hammerer et al. , 2011 ; pietschmann et al. , 2011a ) , and our results also replicated this aging effect .
ern is also known to be affected by aging , with elderly people typically showing smaller ern than young people ( gehring and knight , 2000 ; falkenstein et al. , 2001 ; nieuwenhuis et al. , 2002 ) .
several research groups have reported that the impairment of error processing and learning in older adults is the result of age - related changes in the mesencephalic dopamine system , such as the loss of dopamine receptors and the deterioration of dopaminergic receptor binding with aging ( volkow et al. , 1998 ; backman et al. , 2000 ; kaasinen et al. , 2000 ) .
based on findings that the efficiency of the dopamine system declines with age , nieuwenhuis et al .
( 2002 ) extended reinforcement learning theory to older adults .
they proposed that weakened phasic activity of the midbrain dopamine system leads to reduced negative reinforcement learning signals ; implying that elderly people are learning impaired compared to younger adults ( nieuwenhuis et al. , 2002 ) .
we had expected that this aging effect would be most pronounced in ad , which would mean that ad patients would exhibit smaller amplitudes in monitoring responses .
a previous ern study had indeed reported that amplitudes decreased for ad patients compared to healthy elderly people ( mathalon et al. , 2003 ) .
however , in contrast to the results of that previous study , we found a significant increase of frn amplitude in ad patients .
first of all though , whether ad patients in our study could understand the gambling task is a problem when we try to explain this result .
nevertheless , some behavioral studies have reported that ad patients have accomplished more complex tasks like the iowa gambling task ( sinz et al. , 2008 ) .
in our study , moreover , the switching ratio following the feedback was larger for the negative feedback than the positive feedback in all groups , suggesting that even ad patients could distinguish between positive and negative stimuli , and could avoid the options associated with recent negative results .
therefore , the negative component obtained from the differential waveform in ad could be considered as frn .
as a result , we demonstrated that ad patients show a higher frn .
it is already known that the source of frn is located in the acc ( holroyd and coles , 2002 ; hajcak et al. , 2007 ; bellebaum and daum , 2008 ; holroyd et al. , 2009 ) , and abnormalities of the acc in ad have been reported at histopathological and physiological levels .
in ad patients , accumulation of both beta amyloid and tau ( morishima - kawashima and ihara , 2002 ; leuba et al. , 2009 ; murphy and levine , 2010 ; bloom , 2014 ) , metabolic changes ( bracco et al. , 2007 ; lim et al. , 2012 ) , and decreased blood flows ( dukart et al. , 2013 ; long et al. , 2013 ; terada et al. , 2013 ; lin et al. , 2014 ; bailly et al. , 2015 ) are observed in the acc .
the acc is atrophied structurally ( buckner et al. , 2005 ; jones et al. , 2006 ; seeley et al. , 2009 ; krueger et al. , 2010 ) , and the anatomical connectivity with other areas is also impaired ( greicius et al. , 2004 ; rombouts et al. , 2005 ; wang et al. , 2007 ; boublay et al. , 2016 ; hafkemeijer et al. , 2016b ) .
on the other hand , higher functional connectivity of the acc for the salience network has been reported in some resting - state fmri studies for ad ( zhou et al. , 2010 ; hafkemeijer et al. , 2016a ) .
the salience network plays a crucial role in the detection of salient events from internal and external information ( seeley et al. , 2007 ) , therefore the network is inevitably involved in monitoring processing .
the enhanced functional connectivity of the acc in ad is dovetailed with the enhanced frn in our study in the context of intensified detection of salient feedback information .
thus , the influence of ad pathology on the acc function might be affected depending on the segregated functional network of the acc .
one of the possible mechanisms for explaining this discrepancy is the compensation - related utilization of neural circuits hypothesis ( crunch ; grady , 2012 ) .
the idea of crunch is that more neural resources are recruited by the elderly at low levels of cognitive load ( when tasks are easier ) than younger adults , who do not need them .
at higher load levels , this compensatory mechanism is not effective , leading to less activation in elderly compared with young adults .
this could apply to the relationship between ad and the healthy elderly ( grady , 2012 ) .
according to crunch , enhanced frn reflects a compensatory mechanism with larger recruitment of neural activity in ad patients compared to younger adults .
younger adults in our study might search a best strategy or hidden rule to get a better performance although the probabilities of positive and negative feedbacks were truly equal and the sequence was completely random .
another idea that might explain the discrepancy is obtained from erp studies of other diseases .
a similar discrepancy between frn and ern has been reported in several psychiatric diseases in young people ( van meel et al. , 2005 , 2011 ; groen et al. , 2008 ; holroyd et al. , 2008 ; vlamings et al. , 2008 ; south et al. , 2010 ; larson et al. , 2011 ; santesso et al. , 2011 ) .
studies investigating frn and ern in children with autism have demonstrated that a robust frn is equally elicited in children with autism and those with typical development ( larson and clayson , 2011 ; larson et al. , 2011 ; mcpartland et al. , 2012 ; stavropoulos and carver , 2014 ) , but ern amplitude is significantly attenuated in autistic children ( vlamings et al. , 2008 ; south et al. , 2010 ; santesso et al. , 2011 ; sokhadze et al. , 2011 , 2012 ; mcmahon and henderson , 2015 ) .
these results imply that individuals with autism may process external and concrete feedback normally , but have difficulty with the internal and more abstract regulation of performance .
similar neurophysiological mechanisms may be operative in ad patients .
as well as our frn research in ad , there are several reports that have demonstrated frn enlargement in other diseases .
in depressed patients , augmentation of frn amplitude has been reported ( tucker et al. , 2003 ; santesso et al. , 2008 ; cavanagh et al. , 2011 ; mueller et al. , 2015 ) .
according to beck 's cognitive theory of depression ( beck et al. , 1979 ) , depressed patients have a " negativity bias " , tending to focus more on negative information .
this leads to abnormal responses to negative feedback , and yields an increase of the frn amplitude .
although our study did not include ad patients with moderate or severe symptoms of depression , there was a significant relationship between frn amplitude and depression scores only in ad. in ad patients , the " negativity bias " might be aggravated , even in mild depression .
consistent with previous findings of p300 using an oddball task ( polich et al. , 1990 ; golob and starr , 2000 ; yamaguchi et al. , 2000 ; frodl et al. , 2002 ; bennys et al. , 2007 ; lee et al. , 2013 ) , the present study indicates that p300 exhibits decreased amplitudes and delayed latency in normal aging and ad. as expected , altered p300 was associated with cognitive function scores .
the p300 responses are considered to be related to attention and memory processes ( polich , 2007 ) ; therefore , lower amplitudes and delayed latency of p300 in ad patients exhibits electrophysiological reflection of attention and memory deficits ( phillips et al. , 2004 ; bennys et al. , 2007 ; lai et al. , 2010 ) .
it is considered that the causes of amplitude reduction in the ad group is atrophy of the hippocampus , decreases in blood flow , and decreases in functional binding .
because similar results were obtained in our gambling task , instead of an oddball task , the gambling task may be a more useful clinical tool in evaluating both frn and p300 at the same time .
our study has some limitations .
first , we investigated only the alteration of frn , but not of ern .
it has been speculated that generator sources of frn and ern components are located in the anterior cingulate cortex ( gehring et al. , 1993 ; dehaene et al. , 1994 ; gehring , 2002 ; holroyd and coles , 2002 ; holroyd et al. , 2002 ; luu et al. , 2003 ) , and both potentials are associated with the monitoring system .
frn and ern have been linked to the monitoring of externally provided and internally generated information , respectively ( muller et al. , 2005 ) .
therefore , in order to study abnormalities of the monitoring system in ad , it would be most interesting to examine the changes of both potentials simultaneously .
second , we have not explored any abnormalities of frn in other cognitive impairment and dementia conditions , i.e. , in mild cognitive impairment ( mci ) , frontotemporal dementia , or dementia with lewy bodies .
it is important to examine frn changes in mci , because mci is a prodromal stage of ad. several studies have reported that mci patients show a reduction in p300 amplitude compared to healthy elderly people ( papaliagkas et al. , 2008 , 2011 ) .
therefore , it is possible that similar erp changes may occur in mci , and thus whether frn amplitude increases in mci patients should be confirmed .
conclusions in sum , the present study demonstrated that the frn in ad patients showed larger amplitude and delayed latency compared to age - matched controls , and correlated with depressive tendency .
this indicates that enhanced monitoring response in ad patients might reflect a compensatory mechanism and / or negative bias in outcome evaluation .
psychophysiological measures in the feedback process could provide a clue to understand the neurobehavioral changes in ad patients .

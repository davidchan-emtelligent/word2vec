the c - jun n - terminal protein kinase ( jnk ) plays an important role in the regulation of cell apoptosis .
forkhead box o ( foxo ) transcription factors are involved in diverse biological processes , including cellular metabolism , cell apoptosis , and cell cycle .
however , the jnk / foxo1 pathway involved in the process of apoptosis induced by oxidative stress remains to be elucidated .
here , we demonstrated that the jnk activity significantly increased in response to oxidative stress in mouse follicular granulosa cells ( mgcs ) .
sp600125 , a selective jnk inhibitor , attenuated the oxidative stress - induced mgcs apoptosis .
oxidative stress enhanced the foxo1 nuclear translocation by activating the jnk activity .
moreover , jnk mediated the dissociation of foxo1 from 14 - 3 - 3 proteins in mgcs after the treatment with h2o2 .
finally , oxidative stress up - regulated the expression of foxo1 via jnk mediation of foxo1 self - regulation in mgcs .
taken together , our findings suggest that jnk / foxo1 is involved in the regulation of oxidative stress - induced cell apoptosis in mgcs .

introduction folliculogenesis is a complex process which consists of primordial , primary , secondary , antral follicles and ovulation .
most of the follicles undergo degenerative process during ovarian follicle development in mammalian , which is called follicular atresia [ 1 ] .
follicular compartments comprise oocyte , theca and granulosa cells .
research indicated that granulosa cells apoptosis can cause the follicular atresia [ 2 ] .
moreover , several studies showed that follicular granulosa cells have a crucial role in oocyte potency in sheep [ 3 ] , mouse [ 4 ] , porcine [ 5 ] , goat [ 6 ] and rat [ 7 ] .
therefore , follicular granulosa cells play an important function during female reproduction .
c - jun n - terminal protein kinases ( jnks ) belong to the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) family , which play a critical role in the regulation of stress , cell differentiation and cell apoptosis [ 8 ] .
to date , 10 different splice variants of jnks encoded by three genes , namely jnk1 , jnk2 , and jnk3 , have been cloned and identified [ 9 ] .
jnk1 and jnk2 are broadly expressed in all tissues , whereas jnk3 is mainly expressed in neuronal , testicular , and heart tissues [ 10 , 11 ] .
jnks activation is mediated by mkk4 and mkk7 through phosphorylation of thr183 and tyr185 [ 12 - 14 ] .
after jnks are activated , they phosphorylate the serine residues 63 and 73 at c - jun n - terminal , activating c - jun and enhancing its transcriptional activity [ 14 ] .
the activated jnks also phosphorylate and regulate the activity of other transcription factors including atf2 , elk - 1 , trp53 and c - myc [ 15 , 16 ] .
jnks play an important role in death receptor - mediated such as those of tnf - a , trail , and fasl , as well as mitochondria - mediated apoptotic events [ 9 ] .
the forkhead box o ( foxo ) transcription factor family plays an important role in the conserved pathway downstream , including the serine / threonine protein kinase b ( pkb )/ akt , insulin , and insulin - like growth factor receptors [ 17 , 18 ] .
the foxo family in mammals contains four members ( foxo1 , foxo3 , foxo4 , and foxo6 ) that share high protein homology [ 19 ] .
a previous study showed that foxo1 and foxo4 are highly expressed in adipose and skeletal muscle tissues , whereas foxo3 is abundant in the brain , heart , kidney , and spleen [ 20 ] .
in addition , foxo6 plays a crucial role in the nervous system , being mainly expressed in the development of adult brain [ 21 ] .
foxos participate in various cellular processes , including cell proliferation , cycle , and apoptosis , whose functions are regulated by akt and other signal pathways [ 22 ] .
foxo1 regulates bim gene expression by binding to its promoter in oxidative stress - induced apoptosis [ 23 ] .
moreover , foxo1 induces cell apoptosis via modulating puma expression in oxidative stress - induced mgcs [ 24 ] .
a previous study showed that 14 - 3 - 3 proteins are involved in cell cycle control , proliferation , apoptosis , disease and survival pathways [ 25 ] .
the 14 - 3 - 3 proteins can interact with target proteins and alter their activity and intracellular localization [ 26 ] .
furthermore , the 14 - 3 - 3 proteins regulate pro - and anti - apoptotic through bcl - 2 and p53 pathways [ 26 ] .
for example , in the presence of a survival factor , 14 - 3 - 3 proteins bind to bad , ultimately facilitating its inactivation [ 27 ] .
moreover , it has been described that the phosphorylation of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins dissociates bax , resulting in translocation of bax to the mitochondria and apoptosis [ 28 ] .
in the present study , in order to demonstrate that jnk is involved in the mgcs apoptosis induced by oxidative stress , we first investigated the jnk activity and the effects of sp600125 on cell apoptosis in oxidative stress - induced mgcs .
in addition , we analyzed the expression of cytoplasmic and nuclear foxo1 and its nuclear location in mgcs after jnk inhibition with sp600125 .
finally , we demonstrated that sp600125 affected the interaction between foxo1 and 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , as well as foxo1 self - regulation in hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) - treated mgcs .

jnk promotes foxo1 translocation to the nucleus in mgcs induced by oxidative stress to investigate the hypothesis that the activation of jnk affects the location of foxo1 in the mgcs , we first examined the expression of foxo1 protein in the nucleus and cytoplasm by western blot .
the nuclear and cytoplasmic foxo1 proteins were isolated from the mgcs after treatment with h2o2 .
the result showed that the expression of nuclear foxo1 protein was higher after treatment with h2o2 ( fig 2a and 2b ) .
however , the expression of nuclear foxo1 protein obviously decreased when jnk was inhibited in mgcs ( fig 2a and 2b ) .
moreover , we examined the distribution of foxo1 in the nucleus and cytoplasm by immunofluorescence .
we first overexpressed the foxo1 in mgcs and then used sp600125 and h2o2 to treat mgcs .
the result indicated that the overexpression vector of foxo1 significantly increased the expression of foxo1 compared with pcdna3.1 ( fig 2c ) .
in addition , the immunofluorescence assay showed that foxo1 was localized mostly in the cytoplasm after the treatment with sp600125 ( fig 2c and 2d ) .

jnk promotes the dissociation of foxo1 from 14 - 3 - 3 proteins under oxidative stress as shown in a previous study , the activation of jnk can participate in the phosphorylation of ser186 site 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , thereby interfering with the cytoplasmic localization of foxo1 in other cells [ 28 ] .
to confirm whether jnk affects the interaction between foxo1 and 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , we used the co - ip to detect this interaction in the mgcs .
results showed that oxidative stress induced the dissociation between foxo1 and 14 - 3 - 3 proteins ( fig 3 ) .
in contrast , when the jnk activity was inhibited by sp600125 , oxidative stress could not induce the dissociation between foxo1 and 14 - 3 - 3 proteins ( fig 3 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0167869.g003 fig 3 jnk affects the interaction between foxo1 and 14 - 3 - 3 proteins in response to oxidative stress .
mgcs are treated with 20 mum sp600125 for 12 h and then exposed to 100 mum h2o2 for 24 h , following precipitation with foxo1 antibody .
precipitates are loaded for sds / page analysis and transferred for western blotting with foxo1 and 14 - 3 - 3 proteins antibody .
oxidative stress regulates the expression of foxo1 via jnk / foxo1 axis and its self - regulation a previous study showed that the expression of foxo1 increased in the mgcs treated with h2o2 [ 29 ] , and so , we suspected that oxidative stress induced the foxo1 expression via jnk pathway in mgcs .
therefore , the foxo1 expression was analyzed in h2o2 - treated mgcs when the jnk activity was inhibited by sp600125 .
foxo1 mrna and protein levels in the h2o2 - treated group significantly increased compared with the control group ( fig 4a - 4c ) , which was consistent with the results of the aforementioned study .
furthermore , when the jnk activity was inhibited by sp600125 , foxo1 mrna and protein levels were significantly lower than those in the control group ( fig 4a - 4c ) .

* p < 0.05 .
in the present study , we found that jnk was involved not only in the process of foxo1 migrating to the nucleus but also in the expression of foxo1 .
a previous study suggested that foxo1 enhanced its expression by binding to fre site within its promoter [ 30 ] .
to investigate whether jnk could regulate the foxo1 self - regulation , we transfected the foxo1 promoter with a luciferase reporter construct containing fre site and used the sp600125 and h2o2 to treat mgcs .
results indicated that foxo1 significantly enhanced its promoter activity in the foxo1 wild - type ( w ) vector containing fre site compared with the foxo1 mutation - type ( m ) vector containing a mutation of fre site in response to oxidative stress ( fig 4d ) .
notably , we observed a significant decrease in luciferase activity in mgcs of the jnk inhibitor group compared with the control group ( fig 4d ) .
discussion previous studies showed that detrimental effects of oxidative stress can affect female reproduction and development [ 31 , 32 ] .
in this study , we found that oxidative stress can induce mgcs apoptosis in vitro .
the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) superfamily contains three members of classical mapk ( also named erk ) , jnk and p38 [ 33 ] .
erk and p38alpha mapk play an important role in oocyte meiotic maturation [ 33 , 34 ] and oocyte activation [ 35 ] .
a previous study showed that jnk is involved in the phosphorylation of t451 and t447 in foxo4 after the treatment with h2o2 [ 36 ] .
in raw cells , cypermethrin induced cell apoptosis via the activation of jnk and erk mapk signaling pathways [ 37 ] .
2 - methoxy - 6 - acetyl - 7 - methyl juglone ( mam ) also induced cell death mediated in part by jnk activation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) [ 38 ] .
cao et al .
[ 39 ] reported that sesamin inhibited the fluoride - induced apoptosis by reducing the level of p - jnk in carp kidney .
moreover , isoliensinine - induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells was mediated by p38 mapk and jnk pathways [ 40 ] .
the level of p - jnk increased in methotrexate ( mtx ) - treated platelet apoptosis , and it activated bad and bax and inhibited bcl - 2 , thus , contributing toward mitochondrial dysfunction [ 41 ] .
serum - free media could increase the h2o2 production and activate jnk in mlo - y4 osteocyte - like cells , resulting in cell apoptosis [ 42 ] .
in the present study , the jnk activity significantly increased in h2o2 - treated mgcs .
results showed that jnk is involved in the regulation of the oxidative stress - induced cell apoptosis in mgcs .
furthermore , sp600125 inhibited the h2o2 - induced mgcs apoptosis .
taken together , these results suggested that jnk plays an important role in the process of h2o2 - induced apoptosis in mgcs .
oxidative stress promotes foxo nuclear translocation and induces cell apoptosis through the activation of foxo transcription factors in neurons [ 43 ] .
in addition , foxo transcription factors induced cell apoptosis by targeting the pro - apoptotic genes , including puma , bim , trail , and fasl [ 20 , 44 ] .
we observed that oxidative stress enhanced the expression of foxo1 in the nucleus and promoted its translocation to the nucleus in mgcs .
these results suggested that oxidative stress induces foxo1 nuclear import , resulting in mgcs apoptosis .
jnk - dependent threonine 447 and threonine 451 phosphorylation promoted the nuclear translocation and increased the transcriptional activity of foxo4 [ 36 ] .
an excessive accumulation of cellular ros induced the expression of bim and puma via jnk / foxo signaling in mouse embryonic stem ( mes ) cells [ 45 ] .
in caenorhabditis elegans , jnk - 1 promoted the nuclear accumulation of daf - 16 in response to heat stress [ 28 ] .
in the present study , the nuclear translocation of foxo1 induced by oxidative - stress was inhibited by sp600125 , suggesting that jnk mediates oxidative stress - induced cell apoptosis via the nuclear translocation of foxo1 in mgcs .
mst1 phosphorylated foxo3 at serine 207 and disrupted the association of foxo3 with 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , promoting the translocation of foxo3 to the nucleus [ 43 ] .
moreover , yuan et al .
[ 46 ] found that mst1 - induced phosphorylation of foxo1 at serine 212 dissociated foxo1 from 14 - 3 - 3 proteins and mediated the nuclear translocation of foxo1 in primary rat cerebellar granule neurons .
the vasoactive peptide urotensin - ii ( u - ii ) decreased the interaction of foxo3 with 14 - 3 - 3 proteins in stimulated smooth muscle cells ( smcs ) of human [ 47 ] .
we also observed the dissociation of foxo1 from 14 - 3 - 3 proteins in mgcs under oxidative stress .
this showed that oxidative stress increases the nuclear translocation of foxo1 through the disruption of foxo1 from 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , leading to cell apoptosis .
the jnk - mediated phosphorylation of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins contributed to the disruption of foxo3a from 14 - 3 - 3 proteins [ 28 ] .
a previous study in smcs showed that u - ii activated the phosphorylation of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , while the jnk inhibitor sp600125 attenuated it [ 47 ] .
in the present study , sp600125 increased the interaction between foxo1 and 14 - 3 - 3 proteins in oxidative stress - induced mgcs , suggesting that jnk is required for the oxidative stress - mediated dissociation of foxo1 with 14 - 3 - 3 proteins .
taken together , oxidative stress reduces the association of foxo1 with 14 - 3 - 3 proteins and the inhibition of jnk restores this association .
a recent study showed that hypoxia significantly increased the expression of foxo3a in cmecs [ 48 ] .
in the present study , oxidative stress also enhanced the expression of foxo1 in mgcs , which is consistent with the results of the study by shen et al .
[ 1 ] .
notably , when jnk was inhibited in mgcs , foxo1 expression decreased in response to the oxidative stress .
this result showed that jnk affected the expression and nuclear translocation of foxo1 in oxidative stress - induced mgcs .
a previous study showed that foxo1 bound directly to the foxo1 promoter , inducing its own expression [ 30 ] .
moreover , foxo3 regulated the expression of foxo1 by binding to its promoter in hek293t cells [ 49 ] .
we observed that oxidative stress stimulated the transcriptional activity of foxo1 in mgcs .
in contrast , sp600125 decreased the transcriptional activity of foxo1 under oxidative stress .
these results indicated that jnk promotes the nuclear translocation of foxo1 inducing its transcriptional activity via self - regulation in oxidative stress - induced mgcs .

perceptual decisions requiring the comparison of spatially distributed stimuli that are fixated sequentially might be influenced by fluctuations in visual attention .
we used two psychophysical tasks with human subjects to investigate the extent to which visual attention influences simple perceptual choices , and to test the extent to which the attentional drift diffusion model ( addm ) provides a good computational description of how attention affects the underlying decision processes .
we find evidence for sizable attentional choice biases and that the addm provides a reasonable quantitative description of the relationship between fluctuations in visual attention , choices and reaction times .
we also find that exogenous manipulations of attention induce choice biases consistent with the predictions of the model .
attention drift - diffusion model perception decision - making eye - tracking introduction over the last two decades , neuroscientists and psychologists have devoted considerable effort to understanding the neurocomputational basis of decision - making .
the goal has been to understand which are the variables encoded at the time of decision , what are the algorithms used to combine them into a decision , and how are these processes implemented and constrained by the underlying neurobiology .
considerable progress has been made in understanding simple perceptual decisions ( e.g. , determine the net direction of motion in a field of noisy moving dots ) and simple value - based choices ( e.g. , choose between two food snacks ) .
interestingly , a qualitatively similar class of algorithms has been shown to provide a good description for the accuracy and reaction time patterns in both perceptual ( ratcliff and rouder , 1998 ; gold and shadlen , 2001 , 2007 ; smith and ratcliff , 2004 ; ditterich , 2006 ; brunton et al. , 2013 ) and value - based choices ( mormann et al. , 2010 ; tsetsos et al. , 2011 ; hunt et al. , 2012 ; philiastides and ratcliff , 2013 ; hutcherson et al. , 2015 ) , although many important details remain to be worked out ( bogacz , 2007 ; summerfield and tsetsos , 2012 ; tsetsos et al. , 2012b ; brunton et al. , 2013 ; orquin and loose , 2013 ; shadlen and kiani , 2013 ; teodorescu and usher , 2013 ) .
despite important differences among the various models that have been proposed , all of the algorithms are built around the idea that decisions are made by accumulating noisy evidence in favor of the different alternatives , and that choices are made when the weight of accumulated evidence in favor of one of the options becomes sufficiently strong .
for this reason , they are often described as sequential integration models .
there is also a growing understanding of how the brain implements these processes in both perceptual ( shadlen and newsome , 2001 ; roitman and shadlen , 2002 ; heekeren et al. , 2004 ; philiastides et al. , 2006 ; churchland et al. , 2008 ; kiani et al. , 2008 ; tosoni et al. , 2008 ; ho et al. , 2009 ; bennur and gold , 2011 ; o'connell et al. , 2012 ) and value - based choice ( basten et al. , 2010 ; philiastides et al. , 2010 ; hare et al. , 2011b ; hunt et al. , 2012 ; polania et al. , 2014 ; rustichini and padoa - schioppa , 2015 ) .
since many decision tasks require the comparison of spatially distributed stimuli , two important questions are whether decisions are affected by how visual attention is deployed during the process of choice , and if so , how do sequential integrator models need to be modified to incorporate the role of attention .
for example , in the context of perceptual choice , if a subject is shown two lines of different length on the left and right of the screen and has to decide which one is longer , how does the pattern of fixations to the two stimuli affect his decision , if at all ? or in the context of value - based choice , if a subject is shown two food stimuli , how does his pattern of fixations affect which of the two he chooses to eat ?
this problem has been studied in the realm of value - based choice .
krajbich et al .
( krajbich et al. , 2010 , 2012 ; krajbich and rangel , 2011 ; towal et al. , 2013 ) found that a modification of the popular drift diffusion model , which they call the attentional drift diffusion model ( addm ) , provides a quantitatively accurate description of the relationship between visual attention , choices and reaction times in several value - based tasks .
the addm builds on previous work by busemeyer and collaborators , who proposed an alternative class of sequential integrator models in which attention plays a role ( roe et al. , 2001 ) .
in the addm , attention influences choices by increasing the relative weight given to evidence related to the attended stimulus .
as a result , the model predicts that exogenous shifts of attention can cause systematic choice biases , which is consistent with the results of several studies ( shimojo et al. , 2003 ; armel et al. , 2008 ; hare et al. , 2011a ; parnamets et al. , 2015 ; kunar et al. , 2017 ) .
given that a remarkably similar set of algorithms have been shown to be at work in perceptual and value - based choice tasks in which attention plays no role , it is natural to hypothesize that the addm might also provide a reasonable computational description of the role of visual attention in simple perceptual decisions , and that exogenous shifts in attention ( i.e. , unrelated to the perceptual properties of the stimuli ) might causally bias choices as predicted by the addm .
here we present the results of two experiments designed to test these hypotheses .
testing the extent to which the addm is able to provide a satisfactory quantitative description of the role of visual attention in simple perceptual choices is interesting for several reasons .
first , previous experiments have shown that attention can affect perceptual choices using divided attention paradigms ( wyart et al. , 2015 ) , spatial pre - cuing paradigms ( posner et al. , 1980 ; smith et al. , 2004 ; carrasco , 2011 ) , and serial dependence paradigms ( fischer and whitney , 2014 ) .
however , the algorithmic or computational description of this effect remains an open question ( summerfield et al. , 2013 ) .
second , an important open question in cognitive neuroscience is whether the same algorithms are at work in different domains and systems whenever the problem they are trying to solve is sufficiently similar .
this view is consistent with the fact that sequential integrator models are able to accurately describe two - alternative forced choices in domains ranging from memory , to perception , to economic choice ( gold and shadlen , 2007 ; ratcliff and mckoon , 2008 ; starns et al. , 2012 ; shadlen and kiani , 2013 ) .
however , since perception and value - based choice are made on the basis of different evidence ( i.e. , perceptual inputs vs. reward predictions ) , attention might operate through very different channels in these two cases , and thus we cannot assume ex - ante that it might have a computationally similar effect in both types of decisions .
materials and methods subjects in experiment 1 we tested 25 subjects ( 10 female , mean age 23 ) , which included caltech students and staff as well as members of the surrounding community .
subjects were advised to use glasses for eyesight correction as needed .
each subject completed 1,344 decision trials , split into 4 identical experimental sessions , spread across 4 different days .
subjects received a $ 15 show - up fee in each day , a $ 40 bonus for completing all sessions , as well as additional earnings based on performance , as described below .
in experiment 2 we tested 20 subjects ( 9 female , mean age 25 ) .
each subject completed 336 trials in a single session , and received a $ 15 show - up fee , as well as additional earnings based on performance .
the experiments were approved by caltech 's irb and all subjects provided informed consent prior to participation .
experiment 1 experiment 1 consisted of four identical sessions , collected on four separate days , within a period of 2 weeks .
each experimental session was divided into 12 blocks of 28 decision trials .
at the beginning of each block , subjects were shown for 5 s a line depicting a target orientation chosen from the set { 20degrees , 35degrees , 55degrees , 70degrees } , as shown in figure 1a .
this excludes vertical and horizontal orientations , which would have made subsequent choices too easy .
each orientation was chosen as the target three times per session , in random order .
figure 1 summary of experiment 1 .
( a ) in the beginning of each block of trials a new target orientation was shown for 5 s. the target was shown again immediately after the training trials , and again after every 5 decision trials .
( b ) trial structure for our simple perceptual decision task .
in each trial subjects must choose the stimulus ( left or right ) with the orientation closest to the target .
( c ) diagram showing all seven possible item orientations , in increments of 5degrees , given a target oriented at 35degrees .
( d ) trial structure for training trials .
in each decision trial subjects were shown two oriented lines , on the left and right sides , with an eccentricity of 16 degrees from the center of the screen ( figure 1b ) .
the relative orientation between each of the two lines and the target , denoted by delta , was chosen from the set { - 15degrees , - 10degrees , - 5degrees , 0degrees , 5degrees , 10degrees , 15degrees } ( figure 1c ) .
the subjects' task was to decide which of the two lines had an orientation closest to the target .
they were allowed to take as long as needed to make a choice , and indicated their choice with a button press (" a " for left and " l " for right ) .
let deltaleft and deltaright denote the relative angular distance between the target and the left and right items , respectively .
the two choice stimuli shown in the trial were not allowed to have the same delta .
uniform sampling subject to these constraints led to 42 different trial conditions .
each was used eight times per session , in random order .
subjects saw a blue box around the chosen item in each trial , but they did not receive feedback about the correctness of their decisions during the task .
stimuli were presented on a 1,280 x 1,024 screen , placed ~ 50 cm from the subjects' eyes .
subjects were required to keep their hands on the response buttons for the entire task , so they could enter responses without looking at the keyboard .
subjects' fixation patterns were recorded at 500 hz using an eyelink 1000 plus desktop - mounted eye - tracker with head support .
fixations and saccades were determined using the eye - tracker 's accompanying software package .
the eye - tracking system was calibrated at the beginning of each session , and again whenever the eye - tracker lost the subject 's eye ( which only occurred 4 times during all sessions of both experiments ) .
before each decision trial , subjects were required to maintain a continuous fixation on a central cross for 500 ms before the items would appear , which ensured that every trial began with a fixation on the same central location .
in order to familiarize subjects with the targets , they also completed a training task at the beginning of each block ( figure 1d ) .
here , subjects were shown a single oriented line in the center of the screen , and had to decide whether or not the line shown had the same orientation as the target .
they were allowed to take as long as needed to make the decision , which they then indicated with a button press (" a " for no and " l " for yes ) .
subjects received immediate feedback for 1 s after every decision indicating its correctness .
the training task ended after six correct decisions in a row .
the target stimulus for each block was shown once at the beginning of the block ( before the training trials ) , once immediately after the training trials , and again after every 5 decision trials .
at the end of each experiment session , we selected 25 decision trials at random , and subjects received an additional payment of $ 1 for each correct response .
experiment 2 the structure of a typical trial in experiment 2 is depicted in figure 2 .
experiment 2 was similar to experiment 1 , except for the following differences .
first , each subject completed a single session with 12 blocks of 28 trials each .
second , in each trial we randomly selected one of the two items on the screen to be the bias - target item .
we used the following procedure to bias fixations toward that item .
unbeknownst to the subjects , we required a minimum amount of cumulative fixation time to each item : 800 ms for the bias - target item and 200 ms for the other one .
in every trial we kept track of the cumulative fixation durations to each stimulus and , as soon as the minimum requirement for both was met , the items disappeared and the subject was prompted to make a choice .
third , subjects were told ( without deception ) that both the duration of decision trials and the item that appeared first would be chosen at random every trial , but were not told that the procedure was designed to bias fixations .
to minimize awareness of the nature of the experimental manipulation , which relies on giving subjects control over the duration of trials through their fixations , we set the maximum duration for each evaluation period to 3 s. if the minimum fixation requirements for both items were not met within that period of time , the subject was prompted to make a decision .
trials in which the 3 - s boundary was binding were removed from additional analyses since they exhibited unusual fixation patterns ( 24.3 % over the entire group ; across subjects , min = 6.8 % and max = 55.6 %) .
this trial exclusion rule was chosen a priori to minimize the chance that subjects would become aware of the experimental manipulation .
furthermore , the exclusion of these trials did not qualitatively affect any of the reported results .
fourth , subjects were only allowed to enter their decisions after the decision prompt appeared , and could take as much time as needed to do so. fifth , we refer to trials in which the bias - target item was fixated longer ( and in which the stopping condition was reached before 3 s ) as effective manipulation trials .
note that not all trials were effective since the contingencies described above allow for the possibility that subjects fixate more on the non - bias - target item .
in order to increase the fraction of effective trials , which is the manipulation of interest , the bias - target item was always displayed on the screen first , and the other item was only added after a certain delay , which counted toward the total fixation time for the bias - target .
the duration of this lag was between 100 and 500 ms , and was calibrated separately for each subject at the beginning of the experiment using the following staircase procedure .
the lag started at a value of 300 ms , and was adjusted with a step of 30 ms. after every 3 consecutive effective trials ( i.e. , trials in which the bias - target item was fixated longer ) the lag was decreased by 30 ms , and after a single ineffective trial ( i.e. , one where the bias - target item was not fixated longer ) , the lag was increased by the same amount .
a total of 48 trials were used in the staircase procedure , and the value of the delay at the 48th trial was then used throughout the remainder of the task ( duration : mean = 450 ms , sd = 35 ms ) .
sixth , at the end of the experiment we randomly selected 20 decision trials , and subjects received an additional payment of $ 1 for each correct response in this set .
seventh , at the end of the task , subjects completed a questionnaire in which we asked if they found anything strange about the timing of the items being displayed and the decision prompt .
none of the subjects reported finding a connection between their fixations and the duration of the trials .
figure 2 summary of experiment 2 .
fixations all recorded fixations were classified as either item fixations ( to either the left or right stimuli on the screen ) or " blank " fixations .
trials in which " blank " fixations accounted for more than 50 % of the response time were discarded from further analysis ( mean percentage discarded trials across all subjects : 5.2 % , min = 0.15 % , max = 25.8 %) .
furthermore , if a " blank " fixation was recorded between two fixations to the same stimulus , the observation was converted into a fixation on that item .
this is justified by the fact that this type of " blank " fixations tend to be very short , and are likely to be the result of blinking or eye - tracker noise ( duration : mean = 41 ms , sd = 133 ms ) .
if a " blank " fixation was recorded between fixations on different items , then it was grouped into that trial 's inter - fixation transition time and used as such in the analyses below .
group model fitting we used maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) to fit the addm to the pooled group data .
the model has three free parameters ( d , theta , and sigma ) which we fitted using only the odd - numbered trials , so that the even - numbered trials could be used to test its out - of - sample predictions ( see the results section for a description of the addm ) .
the mle procedure was carried out in multiple steps .
in step 1 we defined a coarse grid of parameter combinations , denoted by omega1 , which was given by the cross product of the sets { 0.001 , 0.005 , 0.01 } for d , { 0.1 , 0.5 , 0.9 } for theta , and { 0.01 , 0.05 , 0.1 } for sigma .
although this set only has nine points , it was selected because it spans a wide range of potential parameter combinations .
we computed the likelihood of the choice and rts observed in the odd - numbered trials , conditional on the observed pattern of fixations in each trial , for each vector of parameters in omega1 .
this was done by simulating the admm using the algorithm described in the supplementary materials .
all time data ( including rts , latencies , fixation durations and inter - fixation transition times ) were binned into 10 ms steps .
we then selected the vector of parameters in omega1 with the highest log - likelihood as the first candidate solution , which for our data was given by d = 0.005 , theta = 0.1 and sigma = 0.05 .
let ( d1 , theta1 , sigma1 ) and ml1 denote , respectively , the best set of parameters and the likelihood that it explains the data that arises from the first step .
the algorithm then proceeded inductively until a stopping criterion was reached .
let omegat denote the search set used in step t , and ( dt , thetat , sigmat ) and mlt denote the best candidate solution at this step .
step t + 1 then proceeded as follows .
a new grid of 9 potential vector parameters , denoted by omegat + 1 , was constructed as the cross product of the sets { dt - deltadt2 , dt , dt + deltadt2 } , { thetat - deltathetat2 , thetat , thetat + deltathetat2 } , and { sigma t - deltasigma t2 , sigmat , sigma t + deltasigma t2 } , where deltadt , deltathetat and deltasigmat correspond to the parameter step sizes used in omegat .
note that omegat + 1 included ( dt , thetat , sigmat ) , as well as a finer grid around it. the mle step was then repeated again .
the algorithm continued until the improvement in the mle of the proposed parameter solution was < 1 % .
for our data , the convergence process was accomplished in 7 steps , and resulted in an estimate of d = 0.0041 , sigma = 0.063 , and theta = 0.36 .
out - of - sample group simulations in order to test the ability of the model to predict out of sample , we used the addm with the best fitting parameters for the odd - numbered trials to predict data group patterns in the even - numbered trials .
critically , the predictions were made conditional on the relative orientation of the stimuli , but not on the actual fixation patterns observed in the even trials .
to understand why , note that due to the randomness in the addm algorithm , two trials with identical stimuli and fixations might lead to different choices and rts .
as a result , two runs of the same trial can result in different outcomes even if they initially exhibit identical fixations .
in addition , if the addm is an approximately accurate description of the underlying processes , the pattern of fixations can vary widely over repeated decisions with an identical pair of stimuli , a fact that is observed in the data .
for these reasons , our out - of - sample predictions condition on the relative orientation of the stimuli , including the effect that this has on the fixation process , as described below , but not on the actual realized fixations .
this allows us to test the ability of the addm to account out - of - sample for key patterns in the data conditional only on independent variables like the relative orientation of the stimuli .
for each of the 42 trial conditions we simulated 400 trials of the model , while sampling fixations , latencies and inter - fixation transitions from the empirical distributions , pooling the even - numbered trials from all subjects .
initial latency ( i.e. , the delay between stimulus appearance and the first item fixation ) and subsequent inter - fixation transitions were sampled , each from its own distribution , without any further conditioning .
to maximize the extent to which the simulated fixations matched the observed fixations , item fixations were sampled as follows .
first , they were partitioned into 3 groups , corresponding to first , second and other middle fixations .
additionally , item fixations were conditioned on the relative proximity difference between the fixated and the unfixated items , rfixated - runfixated , since this matched the observed fixation patterns well .
note that the pool of fixations used to simulate the model excluded final fixations .
according to the addm , a maximal fixation duration is drawn at the fixation outset and runs its course unless a barrier is cross beforehand .
as a result , observed final fixations are truncated , and using them would bias the simulations ( under the maintained hypothesis that the addm is correct ) .
each trial was simulated by sampling latencies , fixations , and inter - fixation transitions as needed to carry out the simulation to its completion .
in particular , each simulation began with a sampled latency , during which only white gaussian noise was added to the rdv .
following this , fixations alternated between the left and right items such that , if the first fixated item was left , the second one would be right , and so on. the first fixation was chosen to be left with probability 0.65 , which equals its empirical frequency .
the maximum first fixation duration was sampled from the pool of first fixations , conditioned on rfixated - runfixated .
the simulation for a trial was terminated if the addm crossed a decision barrier during the course of a fixation .
after each item fixation , an inter - fixation transition duration was sampled , and if a simulation happened to terminate on a transition , it was discarded , since this was not commonly observed in the data ( mean percentage of trials across all subjects : 14.4 % , min = 8.2 % , max = 25.9 %) .
we also simulated the model without discarding simulations that ended on transitions , but did not find any significant differences from the results presented here .
model comparisons in order to explore the role of attention in explaining the data , we carried out an additional set of analyses designed to test the best fitting addm with the best fitting standard ddm , which equals the special case of theta = 1 where attention does not matter .
to do this , we first re - estimated the model in the odd - number trials under the restriction that theta = 1 to find the best fitting standard ddm .
we then carried out three different out - of - sample prediction exercises .
first , we predicted choices and rts in the even trials using the best fitting ddm .
this was done by simulating the model 100,000 times for each potential combination of rleft and rright , and then making predictions by sampling choices and rts from the resulting simulations conditional on the stimulus orientations on each trial .
second , we predicted choices and rts in the even trials using the best fitting addm , conditional on net fixation time ( i.e. , total fixation time on left minus total fixation time on right ) .
this was also done by simulating the model 100,000 times for each potential combination of rleft and rright , and then sampling choices and rts from the resulting simulations , but this time conditional on both the stimulus orientations and the overall net fixation time observed in the even trial .
third , we predicted choices and rts in the even trials using the best fitting addm , and conditional on the observed fixations .
to do this , we simulated the addm for each even trial assuming the same values of rleft and rright , and that the fixation process was identical to the one seen in the trial up to its rt. if the simulation did not lead to a choice by the observed rt , additional fixations were sampled using the fixation process described above .
the outcomes of the simulation were used as the choice and rt predicted for each even trial .
goodness - of - fit measures for binary variables , we report efron 's pseudo r - squared as a measure of goodness - of - fit , which corresponds to the squared correlation between the predicted values and the actual values .
for non - binary variables , we report a number of goodness - of - fit measures , which are designed to test the similarity between the predicted and the observed data patterns .
each pattern involves a relationship between an independent ( e.g. , differences in relative proximity ) and a dependent variable ( e.g. , rts ) .
similar to previous work ( krajbich et al. , 2010 ) , these measures were computed as the p - values on the coefficients of a weighted least squares regression , in which the dependent variables were given by the difference between each subject 's mean and the average value predicted by the model , and the weights were given by the inverse of the variance .
data and code the data and code used in the analyses are available at the rangel neuroeconomics lab website ( www.rnl.caltech.edu ) .
results in order to investigate the role of visual attention in perceptual decision - making , we carried out two different experiments .
experiment 1 was designed to test the extent to which the addm provides a reasonable quantitative description of the relationship between visual attention ( as measured by fixations ) , choices and reaction times ( rts ) in simple perceptual decisions .
experiment 2 was designed to test a key prediction of the addm ; namely , that exogenous shifts in attention can bias perceptual decisions in favor of the attended item .
the first experiment , depicted in figure 1 , required subjects to make simple perceptual decisions about line orientations ( see materials and methods for details ) .
at the beginning of each block of trials , subjects were shown an oriented bar for 5 s , which served as the target for the entire block ( figure 1a ) .
the orientation of the target was chosen from the set { 20degrees , 35degrees , 55degrees , 70degrees } .
in each decision trial subjects were shown two oriented bars , one on the left and one on the right , and had to decide which of them had an orientation closest to the target orientation by pressing a button ( figure 1b ) .
the angular distance between each of the lines and the target , denoted by delta , was chosen randomly from the set { - 15degrees , - 10degrees , - 5degrees , 0degrees , 5degrees , 10degrees , 15degrees } ( figure 1c ) , with the constraint that the two stimuli could not have an equal orientation .
note that the correct response depends only on the angular distance , which is a relative orientation measure .
for example , if deltaleft = - 10o and deltaright = 15o , the correct response is left , and if the two stimuli are equidistant to the target ( e.g. , if deltaleft = - 10degrees and deltaright = 10degrees , then either choice is considered correct .
in order to motivate subjects to perform the task , a subset of the trials was selected at random at the end of the experiment and subjects earned $ 1 for each correct choice .
in order to familiarize the subjects with the stimuli , they also participated in a training task at the beginning of each block in which they were shown one oriented bar at a time and had to judge if it had the same orientation as the target ( figure 1d ) .
training was administered until a pre - specified performance criterion was reached on each block .
see materials and methods for details .
perceptual addm the addm provides an algorithmic description of how information is integrated over time in order to make a binary perceptual choice , and of the role that fixations play in this process .
as illustrated in figure 3 , the model assumes that choices are made by dynamically computing a relative decision value ( rdv ) signal , which at any instant provides an estimate of the relative attractiveness of the two options .
the rdv begins at zero and a choice is made the first time it crosses one of two pre - established decision barriers : one at + 1 , indicating a choice for left , and one at - 1 , indicating a choice for right .
figure 3 two sample runs of the addm .
( a ) the two items have the same relative proximity , and the left item is chosen after 1,909 ms .
( b ) right item has greater relative proximity , and is chosen after 2,444 ms. the predictions of the model depend heavily on the dynamics of the rdv .
let rdvt denote its value at time t within the course of a single decision .
at every time step deltat , its change is given by mudeltat + epsilont , where epsilont is i.i.d. zero mean white gaussian noise with standard deviation sigma , and mu is the deterministic change in the rdv over the time step , often called the slope of the process .
a critical assumption of the addm is that the slope of the rdv signal depends on the location of the fixations at each time step .
in particular , mu = 0 until the first fixation to one of the two stimuli occurs , as well as during non - stimuli fixations and inter - fixation transitions , while mu = d ( rleft - thetarright ) during fixations to the left option , and mu = d ( thetarleft - rright ) during fixations to the right option .
here , d is a positive constant that controls the speed of integration , theta is a parameter between 0 and 1 that measures the size of the attentional bias , and rleft and rright are the relative proximities of the left and right items shown in the trial .
the relative proximity of an option is a measure of its attractiveness , which in this task is given by the negative of the absolute value of delta , and can only take four values : { - 15degrees , - 10degrees , - 5degrees , 0degrees } .
for ease of interpretation , and ease of comparison with related studies ( krajbich et al. , 2010 , 2012 ; krajbich and rangel , 2011 ) , we normalized the relative proximities to the scale { 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 } , with 3 denoting the best possible proximity ( i.e. , an orientation equal to the target ) , and 0 denoting the worst possible proximity ( i.e. , an angular distance of either - 15degrees or + 15degrees ) .
we chose the range to be from 0 to 3 because there were 4 possible values for the angular distance between an item and the target .
figure s3 illustrates the transformation from the angular distance scale to the relative proximity scale .
the addm also makes a critical assumption about the fixation process .
it allows fixations to depend on properties of the stimuli ( as described below ) , but it assumes that the fixation process is otherwise independent of the state of the rdv signal .
in other words , it assumes that there is no feedback from the path of the decision process to the propensity to fixate on stimuli .
we return to this important assumption in the discussion section .
no other major restrictions are placed on the fixation process , except for those that are reflected in the empirically observed properties of the fixations .
first , the model assumes that the location of the first fixation , and its latency , are independent of the relative proximity of the two stimuli .
to be precise , it assumes that the first fixation is to the left item with a constant probability p , and that the latency of this first fixation is drawn from a fixed distribution .
second , subsequent fixations alternate between the left and right items .
third , a maximal fixation duration is drawn from a distribution at the beginning of each fixation , and the fixations run their course unless a choice is made by crossing a barrier before the end of the fixation .
in this case , the process terminates and the duration of the last fixation is truncated .
the distribution of maximal fixation durations is allowed to depend on the fixation number , and on the difference in relative orientation between the fixated and the unfixated stimuli ( see materials and methods for details ) .
importantly , we only sample from non - last fixations , i.e. , fixations that were not terminated when the subject makes a choice .
fourth , fixations are separated by inter - fixation transitions that are drawn from another fixed distribution .
as with the fixations , a maximal inter - fixation transition duration is drawn from this distribution at the beginning of each transition , and runs its course unless a barrier is crossed before it terminates .
several aspects of the model are worth highlighting .
first , the model has three free parameters : d , theta , and sigma ( the time step used for binning the data was fixed at 10 ms ) .
this follows from the fact that , in this class of models , multiplying the size of the barriers , d and sigma by a common positive constant does not change the predictions of the model .
as a result , we can fix the size of the barriers to + 1 and - 1 without any loss of generality .
second , if theta = 1 , the model reduces to the standard drift - diffusion model ( ddm ) ( ratcliff , 1978 ; gold and shadlen , 2002 , 2007 ; ratcliff et al. , 2003 ; ratcliff and smith , 2004 ; smith and ratcliff , 2004 ; bogacz , 2007 ; ratcliff and mckoon , 2008 ) and therefore item fixations become irrelevant .
thus , the model includes as a special case the possibility that attention plays no role in choices .
third , if theta < 1 , the model predicts that changes in fixations can affect choices .
the intuition for why this is the case is illustrated in figure 3a , which depicts a sample run in which rleft = rright = 2 .
in the absence of an attentional bias ( i.e. , when theta = 1 ) , the mean slope of the rdv signal is zero and the choice and rt are determined solely by the noise in the process .
in contrast , when theta = 0.5 , as shown in the figure , the mean slope of the rdv signal is positive during left fixations and negative during right fixations ( i.e. , the integrator moves toward the fixated item on average ) .
fourth , when theta < 1 , exogenous shifts ( i.e. , unrelated to the perceptual properties of the stimuli ) in fixations toward an item can bias choices toward that item , and the magnitude of the bias increases as theta decreases .
for instance , as shown in figure 3b , when rleft < rright and theta = 0.5 , the attentional bias strengthens the negative slope toward the right item barrier during right fixations .
fifth , the assumption that the fixation process does not depend on the state of the rdv signal implies that one can think of the addm as a model of the decision process that takes as given the empirical relationship between fixations and various non - addm variables ( e.g. , fixation number or relative proximity ) , presumably because the choices and fixations are controlled by distinct systems .
basic psychometrics we began the analysis by characterizing the basic psychometrics of the task , which resembled the patterns commonly found in previous perceptual ( ratcliff et al. , 2003 , 2009 ; churchland et al. , 2008 ; deco et al. , 2010 ; bode et al. , 2012 ; bowman et al. , 2012 ; van vugt et al. , 2012 ; white et al. , 2012 ; brunton et al. , 2013 ; ossmy et al. , 2013 ) and value - based decision - making studies ( gold and shadlen , 2007 ; krajbich et al. , 2010 , 2012 ; mormann et al. , 2010 ; krajbich and rangel , 2011 ; hunt et al. , 2012 ; tsetsos et al. , 2012a ; philiastides and ratcliff , 2013 ) .
choices were well described by a logistic function of the relative attractiveness of the two items with a significant but negligible bias ( mixed effects logistic regression : constant = 0.08246 , p = 0.0115 , slope = 1.15047 , p < 10 - 16 ; figure 4a ) .
the mean frequency of correct trials across subjects was 86.3 % ( sd = 5.1 %) .
reaction times decreased as choice ease increased ( mixed effects linear regression : slope = - 277.77 ms , p = 10 - 11 ; figure 4b ) .
we measured choice ease using the relative proximity difference between the items with the closest and farthest orientations to the orientation of the target .
the mean reaction time was 1,849 ms ( sd = 613 ms ) .
also consistent with previous studies ( krajbich et al. , 2010 ; krajbich and rangel , 2011 ) , we found that the number of fixations per trial decreased as choice ease increased ( mixed effects linear regression : slope = - 0.28 fixations , p = 10 - 20 ; figure 4c ) .
the mean number of fixations was 2.83 ( sd = 0.39 ) .
together , these analyses showed that our perceptual task exhibits psychometric properties common in 2 - alternative forced choice tasks , which are predicted by a wide class of sequential integrator models , including the addm .

tests are based on a paired two - sided t - test .
properties of fixations we recorded fixations using an eye - tracker , which allowed us to characterize their properties during the choice process .
for this purpose , we classified each item fixation as " first ," " middle " or " last ," according to when it occurred within the trial .
" middle " fixations are those that are neither the first nor the last ones .
we found that the probability that the first fixation is to the item with closest orientation to the target was not significantly different from chance , and was independent of the relative proximity difference between the two stimuli ( mixed effects linear regression : slope = - 0.009 , p = 0.095 ) .
moreover , we found that the duration of first fixations increased with the relative proximity of the fixated item ( mixed effects linear regression : slope = 30.55 ms , p = 10 - 12 ; figure 5a ) , decreased with the relative proximity of the unfixated item ( mixed effects liner regression : slope = - 11.36 ms , p = 10 - 7 ) , and increased with the relative proximity difference between fixated and unfixated items ( mixed effects linear regression : slope = 17.67 ms , p = 10 - 14 ; figure 5b ) .
we did not find a significant correlation between first fixation durations and choice ease ( mixed effects linear regression : slope = - 1.36 ms , p = 0.55 ; figure 5c ) .

( e ) middle fixation duration as a function of the relative proximity difference between the fixated and the unfixated items .
( f ) middle fixation duration as a function of choice ease .
error bars show 95 % confidence intervals for the data pooled across all subjects .
when looking at middle fixations , we found that their duration increased with the relative proximity of the fixated item ( mixed effects linear regression : slope = 59.9 ms , p = 10 - 17 ; figure 5d ) , and decreased with the relative proximity of the unfixated item ( mixed effects linear regression : slope = - 40.187 ms , p = 10 - 5 ) .
middle fixation durations also increased with the relative proximity difference between the fixated and the unfixated items ( mixed effects linear regression : slope = 40.77 ms , p = 10 - 21 ; figure 5e ) .
finally , we found that middle fixation durations decreased as choices became easier ( mixed effects linear regression : slope = - 24.4 ms , p = 0.00075 ; figure 5f ) .
these findings show that the observed fixations patterns are consistent with the assumptions of the addm described above .
importantly , note that these analyses did not include last fixations because their duration is endogenous in the addm , even under the maintained hypothesis that fixation durations and locations are not affected by the state of the choice process .
the endogeneity of the last fixations follows from the simple fact that they are terminated whenever the choice is made upon crossing a barrier .
model fitting we divided the data into even - and odd - numbered trials , used the odd trials to fit the free parameters of the addm using maximum likelihood estimation ( see materials and methods for details ) , and then tested the predictions of the model out - of - sample using the even trials .
the best fitting parameters resulting from the group - level mle were d = 0.0041 , sigma = 0.063 and theta = 0.36 ( using a time step of size 10 ms ) .
since theta is much smaller than 1 , this suggests a sizable attentional bias .
we then used the best fitting parameters to simulate behavior in the even - trials , and compared it to the actual observed data ( see materials and methods for details ) .
the simulated data provided a reasonably good qualitative and quantitative match to the observed out - of - sample behavior .
the psychometric choice curve ( efron 's pseudo r2 = 0.086 ; figure 4a ) predicted that choices are a logistic function of relative orientation differences , and that reaction times ( goodness - of - fit : p = 0.10 , figure 4b ) and number of fixations ( goodness - of - fit : p = 0.22 , figure 4c ) decrease as choice ease increases .
in the supplementary materials we present three additional sets of results that might be of interest to the reader .
first , we provide individual subject fits .
second , we estimate a non - linear version of the addm and find that the best fitting model is approximately linear ( as in the basic addm ) .
third , we fit the addm separately for trials in the first half of each block , where the memory of the target orientation is fresh , and trials in the second half of the block , where the memory of the target orientation might have dissipated .
the best fitting parameters in both cases are very similar , which suggests that this was not an issue affecting performance in the task .
model predictions we next tested for several basic predictions of the addm .
first , the model predicts that final fixations should be shorter than middle fixations .
this prediction follows from the fact that , according to the model , last fixations are interrupted when the rdv reaches one of the barriers , cutting the last fixation short .
we found this to be the case in our data , as both second fixations as well as other middle fixations ( middle fixations excluding second fixations ) are significantly longer than last fixations ( p = 10 - 9 and p = 10 - 15 , respectively ; figure 6a ) .
figure 6 model predictions .
( a ) fixation duration by type .
as predicted by the model , last fixations are shorter than middle fixations .
note that , except for last fixations , the match between the data and the model is a direct consequence of our fixation sampling process .
( b ) probability that the last fixation is to the chosen item as a function of the relative proximity difference between the last fixated item and the other item .
in the absence of a bias effect , the probability at 0 should be around 0.5 ; due to the bias , the observed probability is significantly larger than 0.5 .
( c ) amount of time spent looking more at item a before the last fixation ( to item b ) , as a function of the duration of that last fixation .
subject data includes only even - numbered trials .
fitted model is the best fitting addm with free theta , and theta = 1 corresponds to the ddm .
error bars show 95 % confidence intervals for the data pooled across all subjects , and across all simulated trials in the case of the models .
second , the model predicts that subjects should exhibit a bias toward choosing the last fixated item , even in trials where they have fixated on both of them .
this prediction follows from the fact that when theta < 1 , the rdv moves toward the decision barrier of the fixated item unless it is significantly less desirable than the other item .
for example , when theta = 0.5 , the rdv moves toward the left barrier when fixating left as long as rleft > 0.5 rright .
this pattern was observed both in the data and the simulations ( efron 's pseudo r2 = 0.11 ; figure 6b ) .
third , the model predicts a very specific relationship between the duration of the last fixation and the pattern of previous fixations .
at any point in time within the trial , we can compute the relative fixation time of the fixated item , given by the total fixation time on that item thus far minus the total fixation time on the other item thus far .
the model predicts that in trials where the last fixated item is chosen , the duration of the last fixation decreases with its relative fixation time computed at the beginning of the last fixation .
this effect is due to the nature of the rdv signal : when theta < 1 , the longer an item is fixated in the trial , the more the signal will move toward its barrier , so the last fixation to the other item ( which will eventually be chosen ) will have to be longer so that the signal can move back toward its barrier .
as shown in figure 6c , this effect was present in the data ( mixed effects linear regression : slope = - 0.28 , p = 10 - 11 ) and the simulations ( goodness - of - fit : p = 0.48 ) .
choice biases the addm also predicts several choice biases when theta < 1 , which we tested next .
first , the model correctly predicts a last - fixation bias : subjects are more likely to choose the last item fixated in the trial ( efron 's pseudo r2 = 0.11 for left last fixated , and 0.084 for right last fixated ; figure 7a ) , due to the fact that the relative proximity of the unfixated item is underweighted in the rdv integration process .
note that a sizeable bias effect can be seen both in our data as well as in the simulations ( for instance , when rleft - rright = 0 , the difference in the probability of choosing left when left was last fixated vs. when right was last fixated is 0.51 for the data , and 0.26 for the simulations ) .
figure 7 choice biases .

( b ) probability that the left item is chosen as a function of the excess amount of time for which the left item was fixated during the trial .

( d ) probability that the first - seen item is chosen as a function of the duration of that first fixation .
( e ) analogous to ( d ) , except subtracting the average probability of choosing the first - seen item for each relative proximity difference .
subject data includes only even - numbered trials .
fitted model is the best fitting addm with free theta , and theta = 1 corresponds to the ddm .
error bars show 95 % confidence intervals for the data pooled across all subjects , and across all simulated trials in the case of the models .
tests are based on a paired two - sided t - test .
second , the model predicts that the probability of choosing an item increases with its overall relative fixation time .
this follows from the fact that , because the rdv moves toward the barrier of the fixated item ( unless it is significantly worse than the other one ) , the rdv is more likely to move in the direction of an item 's barrier when that item is being fixated than when it is not .
consistent with this , we found a strong association between overall relative fixation times and choices ( efron 's pseudo r2 = 0.14 ; figure 7b ) .
however , a concern with this test is that overall relative fixation times and relative proximity are correlated .
to correct for this , we computed a corrected choice probability curve by subtracting from each trial 's choice ( 1 for left and 0 for right ) the average probability of choosing left for that particular relative proximity difference .
this curve provides an uncontaminated measure of the effect of relative fixation at the time of choice , under the assumptions of the addm .
as shown in figure 7c , the observed choice bias was sizable , and matched well the simulated data ( goodness - of - fit : p = 0.038 ) .
finally , the model also predicts that the likelihood of choosing the first seen item increases with the duration of the first fixation .
this was observed in the data ( mixed effects linear regression : slope = 0.00075 , p = 10 - 35 ; figure 7d ) and in the simulations ( efron 's pseudo r2 = 0.088 ) .
the effect was still present after correcting for relative proximity differences , by subtracting from each trial 's choice the average probability of choosing the first - seen item for that particular relative proximity difference ( goodness - of - fit : p = 0.021 ; figure 7e ) .
model comparison as discussed above , the addm reduces to the standard ddm , in which fixations do not affect choices or rts , when theta = 1 .
this provides an additional way of exploring the role of visual attention , by comparing the ability of the best fitting addm and the best fitting ddm to explain the data out - of - sample .
this was done in several steps .
first , we re - estimated the model in the odd - numbered trials under the restriction that theta = 1 , which amounts to finding the best fitting ddm .
we found that the best fitting parameters in this case were d = 0.0024 and sigma = 0.062 .
in contrast , the best fitting parameters for the addm were d = 0.0041 , sigma = 0.063 , and theta = 0.36 .
second , we used these best fitting parameters to carry out the same out - of - sample predictions described above , but for the best fitting ddm .
as shown throughout the figures , the results show that when theta = 1 the model cannot account for key aspects of the data patterns and choice biases .
for example , consider figure 6b , which shows that there is a sizable choice bias in favor of the last fixation .
as the figure shows , the best fitting addm can account for this pattern , which follows from the overweighting of rfixated relative to runfixated .
in contrast , the best fitting standard ddm cannot explain this pattern since attention does not matter in that model .
third , we compared the ability of the two models to predict choices and rts out - of - sample , which provides a test of the value of fixation data in predicting choices and rts ( see materials and methods for details ) .
we compared the accuracy of three types of predictions .
for the standard ddm we predicted choices and rts in the even - numbered trials , conditional only on rleft and rright , since fixations do not matter in this case .
for the addm we carried out two different sets of predictions .
in one of them we predicted choices and rts , conditional on rleft , rright and on the net fixation time on the left item ( i.e. , total fixation time on left minus total fixation time on right ) in each even trial .
in the other , we made predictions based on rleft , rright and , as much as possible , on the actual path of fixations observed on each trial .
the most accurate predictions were made by the best fitting addm conditional on net fixation time ( choice prediction accuracy = 72.3 % , average rt absolute error = 1.92 s ) .
the second most accurate predictions were made by the other addm exercise ( choice prediction accuracy = 70.1 % , average rt absolute error = 2.49 s ) .
the least accurate predictions were made by the best fitting ddm ( choice prediction accuracy = 68.4 % , average rt absolute error = 2.69 s ) .
to put these numbers in perspective , note that the standard deviation of rts is 1.87s .
together , these results suggest that incorporating fixation information in the way specified by the addm improves the out - of - sample predictions made by this class of models .
it might seem counter intuitive that predictions that condition on the observed fixations as much as possible perform worse than those that condition only on observed net fixation time .
however , this makes sense once the randomness in the addm model is taken into account .
since the model entails significant randomness , repeated runs of the model with the same stimuli will result on different choices , rts , and net fixation times , even if they follow the same fixation pattern as much as possible .
as a result , repeated runs of the exact same trials can result in net fixations times that are significantly different from those observed in the trial that we are trying to predict , even if the repeated runs require that fixations follow the same process as long as possible ( see section materials and methods for details ) .
in contrast , the other set of addm predictions are made using runs of the addm that result in nearly identical net fixation times .
this leads to better predictions because net fixation time on the two items affects the average slope of integration in the diffusion model , and thus choices and rts .
consistent with this , the standard deviation in the simulated net fixation times was 276 ms in the first addm prediction model , 886 ms in the second addm prediction model , and 2,603 ms in the ddm prediction model .
experiment 2 : causal test of the attentional effect so far we have found that the addm provides a reasonable quantitative and qualitative account of the relationship between fixations , choices and rts in our perceptual task .
importantly , while the addm predicts a causal impact of attention on perceptual choice , the evidence presented so far is only correlational .
we addressed this issue using an experimental paradigm that manipulates item fixation times with the aid of an eye - tracker , and which has been previously shown to causally affect subjects' choices on a moral decision task ( parnamets et al. , 2015 ) .
the task , depicted in figure 2 , consisted of a modification of the previously described perceptual choice task .
the key difference is that in each trial we randomly selected one of the two items on the screen to be the bias - target for that trial , and implemented the following procedure to bias fixation toward that item ( see materials and methods for details ) .
unbeknownst to the subjects , we defined a minimum period of time required for them to fixate on each item before a decision could be made : 800 ms for the bias - target and 200 ms for the non - bias - target .
we then used the eye - tracker to record the duration of each fixation and , as soon as the minimum requirement for both items was met , the items disappeared from the screen , and the subject was asked to make a choice .
note that this requirement does not guarantee that the bias - target will be fixated longer , since it only establishes a minimum amount of time for each item to be fixated , but not a maximum amount .
to ensure that subjects would not become aware of our manipulation , we set the maximum duration for each decision trial at 3 s. if the minimum fixation requirements for both items were not met within that period , the subject was prompted to make a decision , and the trial would be discarded from all future analyses .
overall , 24.3 % of the trials ( 1,633 trials ) were discarded in this manner .
we refer to trials in which the manipulation was effective ( i.e. , in which the bias - target was fixated longer ) as effective trials .
in order to increase the number of effective trials , we also attempted to guide subjects' first item fixations toward the bias - target ( hikosaka et al. , 1993 ) , so that it would have a better chance of being fixated longer .
in particular , the bias - target stimulus was always displayed first , and the other stimulus appeared on the screen after a short delay ( duration : mean = 450 ms , sd = 35 ms ) .
using this manipulation , 74.3 % of the non - discarded trials were effective ( i.e. , a total of 3780 trials were effective ) .
to check the success of the experimental manipulation , we compared the overall relative fixation time advantage of the left item in all trials from experiment 1 vs. all effective trials in experiment 2 .
as shown in figure 8a , in experiment 1 the left time advantage increased with the difference in relative proximity , while in experiment 2 the bias - target was fixated longer regardless of the items' relative proximity .
in effective trials , the mean total fixation time on the bias - target was 814.2 +/ - 85.8 ms , while for the other item it was 509.2 +/ - 46.1 ms. figure 8 causal test of the attentional effect .

( c ) corrected probability that the left item is chosen as a function of the excess amount of time for which the left item was fixated during the trial , comparing all trials from experiment 1 to all trials from experiment 2 .
corrected probabilities are obtained by subtracting from each trial 's choice ( 1 for left and 0 for right ) the average probability of choosing left for the relative proximity difference from that trial .
as predicted by the addm , we found that the probability of choosing the left item was higher on trials where the left item was the bias - target than on those where the right item was the bias - target ( figure 8b ) .
to appreciate the magnitude of the bias , note that when rleft - rright = 0 , the probability of choosing left increases by 14 % across the two conditions ( chi2 statistic = 16.51 , p = 10 - 5 ) .
importantly , the magnitude of the bias is comparable in magnitude to what we found in experiment 1 .
in particular , the slope of the corrected choice curve in figure 7c is ~ 0.02 , which implies that a shift in relative fixation of 300 ms ( which is similar in size to the one induced by the experimental manipulation in experiment 2 ) should induce about a 6 % increase in the probability of choosing the item .
figure 8c shows a comparison of this effect between experiments 1 and 2 , illustrating that the quantitative effects of the causal manipulation in experiment 2 are consistent with the measurements from experiment 1 , providing additional support for the validity of the causal manipulation .
a natural concern with these results is that the observed effect might have been due , in part , to priming : since the first fixation was manipulated to be to the bias - target item , this could have primed the subjects to bias their choices in this direction ( meyer and schvaneveldt , 1971 ; nedungadi , 1990 ) .
another concern is that , by discarding trials in which the manipulation was not effective , we are biasing the results toward the hypothesis that longer fixations increase the probability of choosing the fixated option .
to address these issues , we split the trials into two sets based on whether or not the bias - target was the longest fixated item in the trial ( i.e. , effective vs. ineffective trials ) , regardless of which item was fixated first , and compared the size of the bias in these two types of trials ( figure 9 ) .
if the observed effect were exclusively due to priming , one would expect a similar choice bias in both groups of trials .
in contrast , the addm predicts a stronger choice bias in the trials in which the bias - target was fixated longer .
consistent with this , we found that the choice - bias was larger in trials where the bias - target was fixated longer than in those when it was fixated less ( comparison of the individual biases in logit regressions : mean constant difference 1.45 vs. 0.57 , paired t - test t = 7.13 and p = 10 - 8 vs. t = 0.27 and p = 0.79 ; when the bias - target was longest fixated , figure 9a , mean total fixation time was 814 ms for the bias - target and 509 ms for the non - bias - target , and when the bias - target was least fixated , figure 9b , mean total fixation time was 801 ms for the bias - target and 1,132 ms for the non - bias - target ) .

discussion the results described above provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the addm gives a plausible algorithmic description of the impact of attention in simple perceptual decision - making .
experiment 1 shows that the model is able to provide a reasonably good ( although not perfect ) quantitative description of the relationship between fluctuations in visual attention , choices and reaction times .
experiment 2 shows that the impact of attention in choice predicted by the addm is causal , and of a qualitatively similar size as that predicted by the best fitting model in experiment 1 .
the imperfect match between our data and the model simulations could be due to at least two important factors .
first , the model we used to simulate the fixation process is a simplistic approximation , which , under the assumptions of the addm , adds noise to the simulations .
second , the results presented for the model simulations are averaged across trials , so the fact that they are not conditioned on the same fixations present in the data also adds noise .
the version of the addm tested here is virtually identical to the one used in previous value - based choice studies ( krajbich et al. , 2010 , 2012 ; krajbich and rangel , 2011 ; towal et al. , 2013 ) .
the only difference is that in value - based choice the evidence that is integrated is composed of noisy measurements of preference for the stimuli , whereas here it is noisy perceptual signals about line orientation .
this suggests that a similar simple class of algorithms with only three free parameters is able to provide a quantitative characterization of several complex behavioral patterns in the data , such as the impact of relative fixation durations , or the impact of first fixations .
this provides further support for the view that the brain utilizes similar algorithms , and perhaps similar neural architectures , for sufficiently similar classes of problems , even if they operate in domains as different as perception and value - based choice .
suggestively , the attentional bias we found in this study ( theta = 0.36 ) is substantial and of similar size to the bias found in previous value - based studies ( theta = 0.3 ) ( krajbich et al. , 2010 ) .
this result leads us to speculate that attentional biases might be sizable in any simple decision task ( perceptual or value - based ) in which fixations facilitate the evidence gathering process .
an important feature of the addm is that it posits a causal impact of attention on choice .
in particular , it assumes that the evidence related to fixated items is weighted more heavily during the decision process , and as a result choices can be biased toward a stimulus by increasing its share of fixations .
furthermore , when the attentional bias parameter is much smaller than 1 , the predicted biases can be sizable .
previous studies of value - based choice with exogenously manipulated fixations have found causal effects in the predicted direction , but of smaller magnitude than predicted by the model ( shimojo et al. , 2003 ; armel et al. , 2008 ) .
one potential explanation for the small effect sizes is that the experimental manipulations had limited success in shifting attention .
experiment 2 provides evidence consistent with this interpretation .
here we utilized a different experimental manipulation of attention that was able to shift fixations and found a causal effect of a similar magnitude as the one predicted by the model .
in fact , our attentional manipulation was inspired by a recent study of attention and moral decisions , which also found sizable effects ( parnamets et al. , 2015 ) .
a critical assumption of the addm is that the fixation process is independent from the sequential integration process .
more precisely , random fluctuations in the rdv variable that guides the choices do not affect the fixation process .
we emphasize that this does not rule out the possibility that stimulus properties orthogonal to the decision process might affect fixations .
in fact , a recent study in the domain of value - based choice showed that the fixation process was affected by low level visual features ( towal et al. , 2013 ) , and several others have provided evidence that the value integration process is modulated by the saliency of the stimuli ( tsetsos et al. , 2012a , 2016 ) .
instead , the key assumption of the model is that the actual integration process does not affect the fixation process .
thus , the addm can be thought of as a model of the decision process , taking as given the exogenous and potentially stochastic fixation process .
in this study , as well as previous ones ( krajbich et al. , 2010 ; krajbich and rangel , 2011 ; towal et al. , 2013 ) , this is implemented by taking the fixation process to be the one that best describes the one observed in the data .
we do not view our results as providing evidence for the hypothesis that the attentional process is not influenced by the state of the decision process variables .
in fact , studies of value - based choice with large numbers of items have found that fixations are shifted toward the best items several seconds into the decision process ( reutskaja et al. , 2011 ) .
instead , our results suggest that these additional influences on attention have a limited impact on the choice process , since most of the effects are already accounted for by the simpler addm .
however , we also conjecture that " top - down " modulations of attention are more likely to occur in more complex decisions with longer reaction times .
a full characterization of how the decision process affects attention , and how this feeds back to the choices , is a critical open question for ongoing research .
for example , a recent study has shown that some of the choice bias toward the last fixated item shown here can arise in multiple types of integrator models , even when attention is entirely random and independent of the choice process ( reutskaja et al. , 2011 ; mullett and stewart , 2016 ) .
the addm provides a simple way of introducing attention in sequential integrator models of choice , by adding an extra parameter to the most basic version of the drift diffusion model .
however , similar modifications could be introduced to a number of other sequential integrator models of choice , including leaky - accumulator models ( usher and mcclelland , 2001 ) , neural network models of the choice process ( wong and wang , 2006 ; hunt et al. , 2012 ) , or more complex versions of the drift diffusion model ( churchland et al. , 2008 ; ratcliff and mckoon , 2008 ; mormann et al. , 2011 ; hawkins et al. , 2015 ) , among others .
such modifications would have qualitatively similar effects , provided that the assumption that fixations are orthogonal to the state of the decision process is maintained .
given the active debate in the literature about which sequential integrator model provides the best description of the underlying processes , an important direction for future research is to carry out a systematic comparison of the attentional versions of all of these models .
the addm models the effects of attention at a high level of abstraction .
another important question for future research is to characterize the neural mechanisms behind the attentional effects captured by the model .
for example , does attention operate at the perceptual stage , prior to the integration of the information by the decision process , or does it operate in the decision process itself ?
does attention operate through similar channels in perceptual and value - based choice , and if so , why does it have a similar effect on choice ?

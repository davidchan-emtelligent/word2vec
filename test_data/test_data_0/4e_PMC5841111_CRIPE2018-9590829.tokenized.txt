wheezing and cough are common case scenarios that pediatricians encountered in their office practices .
although a bronchogenic cyst is an uncommon condition , it is essential to be considered in the differential diagnosis of a chronic cough and wheezing among young children who fail to respond to appropriate medical treatment .
a 28 - month - old girl was referred to our pediatric pulmonology clinic with persistent symptoms of a cough and wheeze unresponsive to standard asthma therapy .
this presentation prompted us to undertake a detailed diagnostic evaluation .
the evaluation exposed a cystic mass in the middle mediastinum compressing the trachea and left main bronchus .
the cyst was excised and confirmed pathologically to be a benign bronchogenic cyst .
subsequently , the patient recovered well and had been free of respiratory symptoms during follow - up visits .
this report highlights one of the rare causes of wheezing and cough in young children and emphasizes the importance of considering it in the differential diagnosis of a child presenting with refractory asthma - like symptoms .
this is important for early diagnosis and management and to avoid unpredictable complications of this treatable condition .
1. introduction the common symptoms of asthma in children include a cough , wheeze , and breathing difficulties .
if these symptoms persist over a period of asthma therapy or the symptoms are not typical for asthma , additional evaluation is strongly recommended .
bronchogenic cysts ( bcs ) are a rare congenital malformation of the foregut that is typically found in the mediastinum [ 1 ] .
affected patients can present with symptoms that are related to their compressive effect and irritation of the surrounding structures [ 2 ] .
we report on a child who presented with persistent wheeze and cough , not responding to medical treatment .
further investigation revealed that the cause of this child 's symptoms and signs was a bronchogenic cyst .
2. case presentation a 28 - month - old girl was referred to our clinic because of a persistent cough , wheeze , and increased work of breathing for the preceding three months .
despite oral antibiotics and high doses of inhaled corticosteroids prescribed by her primary physician , cough and wheeze were persistent .
parents denied any history of witnessed foreign body aspiration , and there were no feeding - related symptoms .
the patient was born at term with an uneventful postnatal course .
her history was significant for episodes of cough and intermittent wheeze that begun at one year of age ; these episodes were usually treated with bronchodilators and inhaled steroids .
there was no history of atopy in the family .
initial physical examination revealed normal growth parameters , a respiratory rate of 40 breaths / minute , and no retractions .
oxygen saturation ranged from 94 to 95 % on room air , and she was afebrile .
lung auscultation revealed decreased air exchange in the left lung ; the rest of her physical examination was normal .
a chest x - ray was performed for abnormal breath sounds and showed hyperlucency of the left lung ( figure 1 ) .
a barium swallow study was normal with no apparent external indentation or displacement of the esophagus and no evidence for gerd .
blood work , including routine hematology and biochemistry tests , was within normal limits .
results of virology pcr for cmv , ebv , and adenovirus were negative .
acid - fast bacilli smear , culture , and tb pcr were negative .
on flexible bronchoscopy examination of her lower airways , no foreign body was seen , but significant external nonpulsatile compression over the left main bronchus was noticed ; the rest of the airway anatomy was normal .
this finding prompted us to undertake a detailed evaluation .
thoracic computed tomography ( ct ) scan and angiogram showed a soft tissue mass in the middle mediastinum , compressing the carina and proximal part of the right and left main bronchi , more pronounced on the left main bronchus ( figure 2 ) .
this mass was further delineated by magnetic resonance imaging of the thorax with contrast which revealed a lobulated cystic mass lesion ( figure 3 ) .
these findings were in favor of the diagnosis of a bronchogenic cyst in the middle mediastinum .
therefore , the patient underwent thoracotomy and surgical removal of a cystic mass which was found during surgery to be adjacent to the posterior trachea and left main bronchus .
pathological examination of the mass showed a cystic lesion lined by the ciliated columnar epithelium surrounded by a fibromuscular wall containing the cartilage and nests of bronchial submucosal glands , confirming the probable diagnosis of a bronchogenic cyst .
there was no evidence of malignancy .
the postoperative course was uneventful .
the patient had been free of any respiratory symptoms and signs , including a cough and wheezing in the subsequent follow - up visits .
3. discussion this child presented with a persistent cough and wheeze that were not responding to standard asthma treatment .
we considered the causes of wheezing and coughing in children .
therefore , she underwent flexible bronchoscopy , ct scan , and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the chest that revealed a bronchogenic cyst in the middle mediastinum .
surgical removal of the mass was successfully performed , and pathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of the bronchogenic cyst .
bronchogenic cyst ( bc ) is a rare congenital pulmonary malformation with a prevalence of 1 : 42,000 - 1 : 68,000 [ 3 ] .
bcs constitute 13 - 15 % of the congenital cystic lung diseases and 6 % of the mediastinum masses in children [ 4 , 5 ] .
abnormal budding of the ventral foregut leads to the formation of bc anywhere along the respiratory system or esophagus .
the location of bc formation can vary depending on the time of their origin [ 6 , 7 ] .
up to 85 % are in the mediastinum , and 12 % are parenchymal in origin involving primarily lower lobes .
however , unusual locations like the neck , pericardium , or abdomen have been reported [ 1 , 7 , 8 ] .
in our patient , bc originated from the trachea in the middle mediastinum .
ribet et al. reported that bcs were symptomatic in 70.8 % of affected children [ 6 ] .
the symptoms are usually secondary to either the compressive effect of the enlarged cyst on the adjacent structures or infection in the cyst .
the former is more common in infants and young children presenting as a retraction , cough , and wheeze , while the latter is more common in adults presenting as recurrent pneumonia [ 4 , 6 , 9 ] .
in rare conditions , mediastinal bc can present in the neonatal period with severe respiratory distress and stridor [ 10 ] .
however , about one - third of bcs are asymptomatic and are found incidentally in adults and some children [ 2 ] .
in our patient , obstructive symptoms were not present in the neonatal period , but ultimately , she became symptomatic .
diagnostic studies include chest x - ray , barium swallow , bronchoscopy , and ct scan / mri of the chest .
a chest radiograph is diagnosed in only 77 % of cases [ 11 ] .
usually , they reveal well - defined homogeneous density , tracheal deviation , and a compression effect - like atelectasis or emphysema .
flexible bronchoscopy may reveal airway compression , and barium swallow may show an indentation [ 6 ] .
ct scan / mri of the chest is extremely valuable for accurate diagnosis , defines the anatomy , and rules out a list of differentials that include cystic hygroma , lymphangioma , neuroenteric cyst , esophageal duplication cyst , and thymic cyst [ 1 , 4 , 9 ] .
ultrasonography makes the antenatal diagnosis with a reported accuracy in more than 70 % of cases [ 12 ] .
in our patient , the cyst was not visible on plain film ; it only showed hyperinflation of the left lung .
the bronchoscopy examination drove us toward the diagnosis .
the ct scan and the mri of the chest were highly suggestive of a bronchogenic cyst .
in almost all cases , pathological studies are required for a definitive diagnosis .
in our patient , the microscopic findings revealed a benign bronchogenic cyst .
in rare cases , reports of malignant transformation , including pulmonary blastoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , and bronchoalveolar carcinoma , have been found in the resected bronchogenic cyst in adults ( 0.7 %) and children [ 13 ] .
to prevent further complications and to avoid the possible risk of malignant changes , complete surgical removal of the bc is strongly recommended even in asymptomatic individuals [ 4 , 6 ] .
in conclusion , although a chronic cough and wheeze are common symptoms of asthma in children when these symptoms do not respond to conventional treatment strategies , this should prompt the clinician to seek further investigations looking for other causes of persistent " asthma - like symptoms. " bronchogenic cysts are an uncommon developmental anomaly of the tracheobronchial tree , which may cause airway compression and mimic asthma .
pediatricians should consider bronchogenic cyst as an important asthma masquerader , particularly in young children who have persistent symptoms and inadequate response to asthma therapy .
surgical resection remains the treatment of choice in all cases to confirm the diagnosis and to prevent unpredicted complications .

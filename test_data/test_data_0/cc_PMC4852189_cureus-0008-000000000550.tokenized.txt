while most cases of vulvar neoplasms are benign , two percent of patients present with malignant disease .
we present the case of a 37 - year - old premenopausal female who presented to an outside institution with a lump in her left vulva , which had progressively enlarged to the size of an egg .
a wide local excision of the left vulva was performed , and the pathology revealed a high - grade sarcoma , not otherwise specified ( nos ) , with negative margins .
imaging showed enlarged bilateral external iliac lymph nodes , likely metastatic .
after discussion at a multidisciplinary gynecology oncology tumor board , she was treated with gemcitabine / docetaxel chemotherapy , followed by a left inguinal lymph node dissection and a left radical vulvectomy after being referred to our centre .
the final pathology at that time showed a residual sarcoma of 3.5 mm in the left vulva with no lympho - vascular invasion ( lvi ) and negative margins , with the closest , laterally , at 2 mm. a total of three lymph nodes were negative .
she received additional chemotherapy postoperatively .
approximately one year later , she returned to her gynecologist with a 1 cm mass on the left vulva .
she underwent a left hemi - vulvectomy and lymph node dissection , and pathology confirmed the presence of a high - grade sarcoma with close margins .
she received adjuvant radiotherapy .
three months later , she presented with persistent cough and pneumonia .
imaging revealed a 10 cm lung mass , which was believed to be metastasis from the vulva .
this was confirmed with biopsy and was completely resected .
any mass in the bartholin gland area should be investigated carefully .
poorly differentiated vulvar leiomyosarcoma in the bartholin gland can recur locally but may also lead to distant metastasis .
despite surgical and systemic treatment , as well as adjuvant radiation , the tumor recurred .
due to the rarity of this condition , there are no clear recommendations for treatment of this disease .
to our knowledge , this is the first report of vulvar leiomyosarcoma of the bartholin gland with metastasis to the lung .

introduction sarcomas are uncommon malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin that comprise two percent of all cancers in humans [ 1 ] .
ninety percent of sarcomas of the female reproductive system are uterine sarcomas .
sarcomas represent approximately one to three percent of all tumors in the area of the vulva [ 1 ] .
the histological types of vulvar sarcomas are leiomyosarcomas , epithelioid sarcomas , rhabdomyosarcomas , angiosarcomas , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors , malignant fibrous histiocytomas , and sometimes aggressive angiomyxomas [ 1 ] .
leiomyosarcoma is the commonest among these histological types [ 1 - 2 ] .
it is believed that the labia majora are the most common site of vulvar leiomyosarcoma followed by the bartholin gland , clitoris , and labium minus [ 3 ] .
in general , vulvar sarcomas usually present as rapid - growing nodules with frequent recurrences , which are characterized by a high chance of metastasis , and an increased mortality rate .
these tumors may arise from smooth muscles , blood vessels , rough ligaments , and erector - pili muscles [ 1 - 2 , 4 ] .
there are very few cases of vulvar leiomyosarcomas reported as small case series or as case reports .
this case is unique in that there were no distant metastases in previously reported cases of leiomyosarcoma of the bartholin gland [ 2 ] .
informed consent was obtained from the patient for this study .
case presentation a 37 - year - old premenopausal female ( gravida 6 , para 3 , aborta 3 ) , ex - smoker whose past medical history was only significant for hyperlipidemia , presented to a community hospital in august of 2012 with a lump in her left vulva .
what began as a pea - sized mass had rapidly enlarged to the size of an egg .
she had a wide local excision of the left vulva with the pathology revealing a high - grade sarcoma , nos .
the tumor measured 5.0 x 3.9 x 2.9 cm , and it displayed ulceration of the surface epithelium , with no definite lymphovascular invasion ( lvi ) , strong expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors , and focal positivity for smooth muscle markers compatible with smooth muscle differentiation ( i.e. , leiomyosarcoma ) with negative margins .
endometrial biopsy and pap test were also performed at that time and showed no evidence of malignancy .
she was then referred to our institution where staging computed tomography ( ct ) scan of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis revealed enlarged bilateral external iliac lymph nodes that were likely metastatic .
a positron emission tomography ( pet )/ ct scan performed at that time only showed some nonspecific activity in the vaginal / vulvar region likely related to her recent surgery .
after further discussion at the tumor board , she received three cycles of gemcitabine / docetaxel chemotherapy prior to undergoing completion left radical vulvectomy and left inguinal lymph node dissection .
the pathology from this second surgery showed residual sarcoma measuring 3.5 mm in the left vulva , no lvi and negative margins , with the closest laterally at 2 mm. three lymph nodes were found to be negative .
she received three more cycles of gemcitabine / docetaxel postoperatively .
fifteen months later , a 1 cm mass on her left vulva was discovered in the same location as the original tumor at a follow - up visit .
a magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the pelvis showed an abnormal enhancement in the left vulvar area measuring 3.7 cm in greatest dimension ( as seen in figure 1 ) , consistent with recurrent vulvar disease .
the bilateral inguinal and bilateral pelvic lymph nodes were stable ; however there was a new 7 mm left inferior epigastric lymph node .
on pet / ct scan , a new distinct focal uptake was noted lateral to the vaginal wall on the left side with a standard uptake value ( suv ) of six for which neoplastic disease was in the differential .
no distant metastases were present .
figure 1 axial mri of the pelvis showing an abnormal enhancement in the left vulvar area measuring 3.7 cm in greatest dimension , representing tumor recurrence .
the patient then underwent a left hemivulvectomy , and a left external iliac , left inferior epigastric , and a left obturator lymph node excision .
in the vulva , there was a small focus of residual high - grade sarcoma measuring 1.5 mm , with tumor at 2.0 mm from lateral margin .
there was no lvi noted , and all 14 lymph nodes resected were negative .
two months after the surgery , the patient underwent high dose rate interstitial brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy to the vulva .
the dose of the interstitial brachytherapy was 15 gy in 5 fractions , delivered b.i.d. with atleast a 6 - hour interval for three consecutive days .
six metal needles were placed guided by a perineal template .
the volume to cover was delineated on ct with fusion of the diagnostic mri .
this was followed by 45 gy in 25 fractions ( five days per week , five consecutive weeks ) of external beam radiotherapy using intensity modulated radiation therapy .
the patient required a four - week treatment break between the brachytherapy and external beam treatment due to development of an ulcer on the left lateral vaginal wall .
the clinical target volume included the scar and entire tumor bed with a 1 cm margin and the remainder of the left hemivulva .
the planning target volume ( ptv ) included the clinical target volume ( ctv ) with a 1 cm margin .
on the first follow - up after treatment completion , the patient was very well , with no pain or local irritation .
upon examination , the 1 cm healing ulcer was still visible .
there was no evidence of disease .
three months later , the patient was asymptomatic in the vulva , with the ulcer on the left vulva still present and stable in size .
she did admit to having a cough and to have suffered from pneumonia several weeks prior , which was treated with antibiotics .
she also experienced pain in the lower thoracic spine region when lying on her right side , and in the upper abdomen or lower chest when coughing .
she was otherwise well , with no constitutional symptoms .
her appetite and energy were normal , and her weight was stable .
the patient 's general physical examination was normal .
on pelvic mri , only postoperative changes were visible at the level of the vulva .
however , on ct scan of the chest , a large , 10 cm paravertebral , subpleural mass ( as seen in figure 2 ) was found , occupying the posteromedial aspect of the right lower lobe .
figure 2 axial ct scan of the chest showing a 10 - cm paravertebral , subpleural thoracic mass .
a biopsy was done confirming metastatic leiomyosarcoma consistent with the vulvar primary .
restaging pet scan was done confirming the single lung metastasis .
as this was deemed the only site of disease , the patient underwent a right lower lobectomy .
on pathology , a tumor measuring 18.0 x 14.0 x 6.5 cm was identified in the posterolateral aspect of the right lower lobe .
it was well - circumscribed , multilobulated , and it appeared to have multiple areas of necrosis and hemorrhage .
examination of the adjacent lung parenchyma appeared unremarkable .
the vascular , bronchial , and parenchymal margins were uninvolved .
immunohistochemistry supported the diagnosis of metastatic leiomyosarcoma .
the patient went on to receive cisplatin / adriamycin chemotherapy .
a follow - up and repeat pet scan two months after her surgery showed no evidence of local or distant disease .
discussion we present a case of locally recurrent vulvar leiomyosarcoma of the bartholin gland with distant metastasis to the lung .
smooth muscle neoplasms of the vulva are rare .
the majority are seen in women of middle and older age ( age range , 20 to 68 years old ) , and the average age of clinical presentation is approximately 30 - 40 years old [ 1 ] .
the youngest age reported was 14 years of age [ 5 ] .
most of the cases reported in the literature are from western countries , which may point to lifestyle or genetic factors related to these tumors [ 1 ] .
the cause of these tumors is unclear .
it has been hypothesized that chronic inflammation is an important component of tumorigenesis [ 1 ] .
in fact , vulvar leiomyosarcoma in patients with longstanding lichen sclerosus has been reported [ 6 ] leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma of the bartholin gland are often clinically misdiagnosed as bartholin gland cysts or abscesses [ 4 ] .
leiomyosarcomas of the bartholin gland are rare , and because of the anatomic location of the tumor , it is usually unnoticeable to the patient until the mass is large or causes symptoms such as pain , pruritus , and erythema .
these factors lead to a delay in the diagnosis and impede early intervention , resulting in advanced presentations and a worse prognosis .
biopsy is highly recommended if a mass of the bartholin gland is firm or solid on palpation , and if it is ulcerated or found in a slightly different location than the usual bartholin gland cyst [ 4,7 ] .
early diagnosis and treatment are important because these smooth muscle neoplasms have high risk of recurrence , and patients may require adjuvant radiotherapy in addition to adequate surgical excision [ 4 ] .
in 1996 , nielsen et al. proposed criteria to differentiate between leiomyosarcoma and leiomyoma : 1 ) the mass should be more than 5 cm in diameter ; 2 ) there should be the presence of an infiltrative margin ; 3 ) there are more than five mitotic figures per 10 hpf ; and 4 ) there is moderate to severe cytologic atypia .
tumors with three or more of these features should be considered sarcomas and those that have only one can be diagnosed as leiomyoma , while two of these characteristics can be considered as atypical leiomyoma [ 8 ] .
in the presenting case , the pathology showed a high - grade sarcoma , nos .
the tumor measurements were of 5 cm in greatest dimension , and it displayed ulceration of the surface epithelium , and focal positivity for smooth muscle markers compatible with smooth muscle differentiation ( i.e. , leiomyosarcoma ) .
the tumor had characteristics of a high - grade sarcoma and exhibited small cell - like features. with this morphology , the possibilities of extraskeletal ewing 's sarcoma , alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma , and synovial sarcoma were considered in the differential diagnosis .
the three possibilities were excluded by molecular studies .
immunohistochemistry results showed the tumor was strongly and diffusely positive for vimentin , estrogen , and progesterone receptors ; cd99 and nse were positive in most of the tumor cells ; desmin and msa were focally positive ; and rare tumor cells were positive for s - 100 and hmb45 .
the tumor was completely negative for keratin ae1 / ae3 , ck8 - 18 , ema , melana , gfap , c - kit , cd31 , cd34 , chromogranin , synaptophysin , and mdm2 .
the tumor was classified as high - grade sarcoma , nos , the presence of strong estrogen receptor ( er ) and progesterone receptor ( pr ) expression and focal positivity for desmin and msa in this clinical context was felt to be compatible with an unusual variant of leiomyosarcoma .
immunohistochemical evaluation is important to confirm the diagnosis of vulvar leiomyosarcoma in order to dictate subsequent management [ 9 ] .
in 2003 , ulutin et al. reviewed 453 cases with vulvar malignancy from 1977 - 1997 [ 3 ] .
seven patients had vulvar sarcoma ( 1.54 %) .
three cases had leiomyosarcoma , two patients had fibrosarcoma , and one case had epithelioid sarcoma .
one patient was excluded from the study because the histology was confirmed to be alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma in a very young patient .
the three cases of vulvar leiomyosarcoma all were located in the labia majora .
one of the three patients presented with a mass measuring 7 cm , with more than 3 mm of invasion , treated with radical vulvectomy and groin lymph node dissection with adjuvant radiotherapy .
the size of the tumors in the other two patients was 3 cm and 3.5 cm , with less than 3 mm invasion , and treated with simple vulvectomy and radical vulvectomy respectively , without adjuvant radiotherapy [ 3 ] .
in their study , none of the leiomyosarcoma cases had metastasized .
aartsen and albus - lutter reviewed the history of 47 patients with vulvar sarcoma , which included 25 cases of leiomyosarcoma [ 10 ] .
seventeen of them had at least one local recurrence ( 68 %) , and 13 had more than one recurrence ( 52 %) .
eight patients developed disseminated disease , five to lung ( 20 %) , one to liver ( 4 %) , and three to other distant sites ( 12 %) [ 10 ] .
none of the eight cases had primaries in the anatomical location of the bartholin gland .
in 2009 , gonzalez - bugatto et al. published a review of seven cases of vulvar leiomyosarcoma of the bartholin gland [ 2 ] .
during the follow - up period ( 13 months to 24 years ) , none of the patients developed lymph node or distant metastases , and all of the patients were alive without evidence of disease .
four of the seven cases had local recurrence [ 2 ] , a common event in leiomyosarcoma .
these tumors have a very low incidence , and the literature shows a wide variety of treatment plans limited to a small number of patients [ 2 ] .
wide local excision with at least a 2 - cm clear margin confirmed by pathological evaluation is highly recommended [ 2,4 ] .
the risk of local recurrence is high in patients with inadequate resection margins [ 2,10 ] .
for small , well - circumscribed tumors with adequate clear margins , wide local excision is sufficient [ 2 ] .
for low - grade sarcomas with free surgical margins , the patients need close observation and adjuvant radiotherapy may not required .
in cases with residual sarcoma , close surgical margins , or with high - grade tumors , adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated [ 3 ] .
in the case of local recurrence , wide local excision with adjuvant radiotherapy is the treatment of choice .
the role of chemotherapy is not clearly defined [ 2,4 ] .
chemotherapy has been reported to produce regression of lung metastasis in vulvar sarcoma [ 2,10 ] .
in this particular case , the patient was treated first with wide local excision .
after the incidental finding of leiomyosarcoma , referral to our centre prompted staging studies which showed enlargement of the bilateral external iliac lymph nodes .
she had received preoperative chemotherapy before undergoing left radical vulvectomy and left inguinal lymph node dissection , followed by additional chemotherapy .
fifteen months later , the tumor recurred locally and the patient was treated with left hemivulvectomy and lymph node dissection followed by interstitial brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy .
three months later , the patient developed lung metastasis , treated by lobectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy .
the patient remains disease free two months from completion of therapy .
conclusions to our knowledge , this is the first case of vulvar leiomyosarcoma of the bartholin gland with lung metastasis to be reported .
a review of the literature shows few cases of leiomyosarcoma of the bartholin gland , and none of these cases have distant metastases .
cases with multiple local recurrences and high - grade tumors generally have a poor prognosis [ 2 ] .
early diagnosis and treatment are important because these sarcomas have a high risk of recurrence .
any vulvar lesion should be investigated carefully , and biopsy is recommended .
despite locoregional control achieved through surgical intervention and adjuvant radiotherapy , the tumor recurred distantly in our patient .
the most optimal treatment regimen remains unknown .
there are no standardized guidelines or clear recommendations in the management of this type of sarcoma .
further studies examining different systemic treatments are required to elucidate the best treatment strategy .
the authors have declared that no competing interests exist .

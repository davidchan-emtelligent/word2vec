hillslope instability has been thought to be one of the most important factors for landslide susceptibility .
in this study , we apply geomorphic analysis using multi - temporal dem data and shake intensity analysis to evaluate the topographic characteristics of the landslide areas .
there are many geomorphologic analysis methods such as roughness , slope aspect , which are also as useful as slope analysis .
the analyses indicate that most of the co - seismic landslides occurred in regions with roughness , hillslope and slope aspect of > 1.2 , > 30 , and between 90 and 270 , respectively .
however , the intersection regions from the above three methods are more accurate than that derived by applying single topographic analysis method .
the ground motion data indicates that the co - seismic landslides mainly occurred on the hanging wall side of longmen shan thrust belt within the up - down and horizontal peak ground acceleration ( pga ) contour of 150 pga and 200 gal , respectively .
the comparisons of pre - and post - earthquake dem data indicate that the medium roughness and slope increased , the roughest and steepest regions decreased after the wenchuan earthquake .
however , slope aspects did not even change .
our results indicate that co - seismic landslides mainly occurred at specific regions of high roughness , southward and steep sloping areas under strong ground motion .
co - seismic landslides significantly modified the local topography , especially the hillslope and roughness .
the roughest relief and steepest slope are significantly smoothed ; however , the medium relief and slope become rougher and steeper , respectively .

keywords co - seismic landslide topographic pga multi - temporal dem wenchuan earthquake issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2013 introduction it has been commonly accepted that steep topography are of high landslide frequency in active orogenic region .
the co - seismic landslides usually occurred in active orogenic regions , which are one of the major secondary nature hazards related to strong earthquakes ( harp and jibson 1996 ; gallousi and koukouvelas 2007 ; owen et al. 2008 ; ren and lin 2010 ; dai et al. 2011a ) .
in some cases , co - seismic landslides even produce more serious human loss and damages than the earthquake itself .
thus , the co - seismic landslides have fundamental influence on human life and seismic design of buildings etc .
it has been noticed that transportation and deposition of the landslide materials will also have fundamental impact on the topographic evolution ( meng et al. 2006 ; godard et al. 2010 ; ouimet , 2010 ; hovius et al. 2011 ; parker et al. 2011 ) .
contemporary , the topographic conditions will also affect the susceptibility of landslides ( jibson et al. 2000 ; dai and lee 2002 ; korup et al. 2007 ) .
a variety of approaches have been used in slope instability analysis , which has been one of the most important topographic features in detecting susceptible landslide areas ( dai and lee 2002 ; korup et al. 2007 ; ren and lin 2010 ; chuang and fabbri 2008 ). with the development of geographical information systems ( gis ) , numerous quantitative topographic analysis approaches have developed in recent years .
topographic roughness , slope aspect and hillslope are the most commonly used features in tectonic geomorphologic and landslide - related studies ( e.g. , dai and lee 2002 ; casson et al. 2005 ; zhang et al. 2011 ; ren and lin 2010 ) .
the lithologic units and concentrations of the co - seismic landslides induced by wenchuan earthquake have been analyzed in detail ( dai et al. 2011a ) .
in this paper , we will mainly focus on the topographic characteristics of the co - seismic landslides .
the shaking intensity is another important parameter that has been thought to be related to co - seismic landslides as well as sand liquefactions ( harp and wilson 1995 ; murphy et al. 2002 ; meunier et al. 2007 ; wang et al. 2011 ) .
in this study , we also use the open accessed strong motion records to analyze the relationship between wenchuan earthquake triggered co - seismic landslides and the peak ground acceleration ( pga ) distribution , which is distributed by csmnc ( china strong motion networks center ) , iemcea ( institute of engineering mechanics , china earthquake administration ) .
the occurrence of 2008 mw 7.9 wenchuan earthquake provides a valuable opportunity to verify the accuracy of multiple approach analyses involving variable topographic analyses and shaking intensity .
the landslide areas are validated using the pre - earthquake high - resolution digital elevation model ( dem ) data derived from 1:50,000 topographic maps .
the analyses indicate that the co - seismic landslides are closely correlated to the topographic conditions as well as the shaking intensity .
the topographic effects of the wenchuan earthquake are also analyzed based on post - earthquake dem data derived from stereo pair of irs - p5 ( indian remote sensing satellite ) remote sensing images by comparing with pre - earthquake dem .
study area the longmen shan region is one of the steepest margins of the tibetan plateau accompany with almost 5000 m altitude decrease across the margin within 50 km distance ( burchfiel et al. 1995 , 2008 ; chen and wilson 1996 , figure 1 ) .
it is also an active orogen whose activity has been largely underestimated due to the less crustal shortening and low slip rates of the major faults within it , as revealed by low geodetic slip rates , shortening rates ( king et al. 1997 ; chen et al. 2000 ; zhang et al. 2004 ; gan et al. 2007 ) and geological slip rates ( densmore et al. 2007 ; zhou et al. 2007 ) .
there are four major active fault systems within the longmen shan thrust belt : wenchuan - maowen , yingxiu - beichuan , guanxian - anxian and qingchuan fault systems ( burchfiel et al. 1995 , 2008 ; densmore et al. 2007 ; zhou et al. 2007 ) .
it has been reported that the wenchuan earthquake ruptured the yingxiu - beichuan and guanxian - anxiang faults ( lin et al. 2009 ; xu et al. 2009 ; liu - zeng et al. 2009 ; zhang et al .
2010 ) , although it is still ambiguous that whether the qingchuan fault is ruptured ( lin et al. 2012 ) .
a large amount of co - seismic landslides were triggered on the steep slope regions accompany with the co - seismic deformations ( e.g. ren and lin , 2010 ; yin et al. 2010 ; dai et al. 2011a,2011b ; parker et al. 2011 ; tang et al .
2011 ) , which significantly changed the local topography .
the co - seismic landslides mainly distributed in a corridor that bounds the co - seismic surface rupture , with major portion on the hanging wall side ( ren and lin 2010 ; yin et al. 2010 ; godard et al. 2010 ; ouimet 2010 ; dai et al. 2011a , 2011b ) .
thus , the earthquake triggered deformation and landslides can dominate local erosion and landscape evolution in longmen shan region ( meng et al .
2006 ) , as in other active orogen in the world ( hovius et al. 2011 ; mackey and roering 2011 ) .
therefore , the co - seismic landslides of the wenchuan earthquake should be controlled by the topographic conditions and will consequently affect the local topographic evolution in longmen shan region .

data and methods data acquirement with the development of gis techniques , recent quantitative topographic analyses are usually based on dem data .
previous studies suggest that the dem data derived from stereo pair of remote sensing imagery data is favorable in landslide detection ( casson et al. 2005 ) .
the indian remote sensing satellite p5 ( irs - p5 ) carries two panchromatic cameras ( pan fore and pan after ) , which is favorable for deriving post - earthquake dem .
in this study , we derived a 5 m resolution dem using the stereo pairs of 2.5 m resolution irs - p5 imagery data .
three representative sites ( site i - iii ) were selected for dem derivation , which have no cloud coverage at the time of imagery acquisition ( table 1 ) .
to improve the dem quality , we also applied field ground control points ( gcp ) survey using trimble r8 gps ( figure 1 ) .
finally , we derived the dem using the gcp points , rational polynomial coefficient ( rpc ) camera model ( tao and hu 2001 ) and tie points between the pan fore and pan after imagery .
the checkpoints indicate that the error of the post - earthquake dem is usually less than 1.5 m ( tables 2 and 3 ) , which is precise enough for landslide topography analysis .
because there are no pre - earthquake stereo pairs of remote sensing imagery data available , the pre - earthquake dem data are derived from the best data we can get - - the 1:50,000 topographic maps .
the topographic maps are surveyed using stereo pairs of aerial photograph with sufficient ground control points ( gcp ) by national administration of surveying , mapping and geoinformation of china ( nasmgc ) in 1970s .

roughness is defined by the ratio between the surface area and projected area .
it is usually obtained by averaging the roughness value over an area of 3 x 3 pixel size. by running a test to determine the best threshold on the balance of the percentage of landslides within the derived region and corresponding area , the threshold of 1.2 for roughness could be determined ( figures 2 , 3 and 4 ) .
it shows that most of the landslides occurred in regions with roughness larger than 1.2 , i.e. , the threshold of 1.2 is the most effective value in landslide detection .
we also compared the pre - and post - earthquake roughness within the landslide area .
it indicates that the medium topographic roughness significantly increased after earthquake .
the roughest relief is also smoothed by the wenchuan earthquake ( figure 5 ( b )) .

figure 5 co - seismic topographic changes .
distribution of pre - earthquake and post - earthquake hillslope ( a ) , roughness ( b ) and slope aspect ( c ) .
the medium topography are roughened and steepened , however the steepest and roughest topography are smoothed by the wenchuan earthquake .
the slope aspect is almost unchanged .
hillslope slope instability analysis has been one of the most important topographic analyses regarding landslide susceptibility .
it has been testified that steep slope areas are prone to landslides ( burbank et al. 1996 ; densmore et al. 1998 ; dai and lee 2002 ) .
the co - seismic landslides of the wenchuan earthquake mainly distribute in regions with slopes larger than 30degrees on pre - earthquake dem ( ren and lin 2010 ; figures 2 , 3 and 4 ) .
thus , we analysis the relationship between the co - seismic landslides and slope distribution by applying a threshold of 30degrees on the slope distribution map ( figures 2 , 3 and 4 , table 4 ) .
in order to detect the slope changes produced by the co - seismic landslides , we compared the slope distribution pre - and post - earthquake within the landslide area .
it indicates that the medium slope significantly increased after earthquake , which indicates that the topography is becoming steeper .
however , the steepest slopes decreased after earthquake , which indicates that the wenchuan earthquake also smoothed the pre - earthquake steepest slopes ( figure 5 ( a )) .

slope aspect the slope aspect is the expression of horizontal direction that a mountain slope faces .
due to the exposure to sunrays , the slope aspect has fundamental influence on the landslide possibility due to the differences of temperature , sediment condition , vegetation etc .
( e.g. rech et al. 2001 ; fekedulegn et al. 2003 ) .
mechanical , chemical and biological weathering are much stronger on the southward facing slopes than that on the northward facing slopes , where are more open to the sunlight and warm wind .
the slope aspect analysis on post - earthquake dem also shows high landslide density on the southward facing slopes ( figures 2 , 3 and 4 ) .
the southward slope aspect is generally between 90 and 270 degree .
therefore , applying threshold value of 90 - - 270 , we can derive the landslide potential area on the basis of the slope aspect analysis .
according to the slope aspect , post - earthquake slope aspect did not change much , comparing with pre - earthquake data within the landslide area .
it indicates that the co - seismic landslides did not affect the slope aspect , i.e. , it is not controlled by such tectonic events .
seismic information according to the co - seismic landslides , seismic information such as ground motion is one of the main trigger mechanisms .
we consequently analyzed the characteristics of landslide areas based on multiple approaches including ground motion information .
preliminary analyses of the strong motion records show that the peak ground acceleration ( pga ) contours distribute in the region peripheral to the co - seismic surface rupture with the maximum value of 957.7 gal ( li et al. 2008 ; figure 6 ) .
we collected the strong motion records of 267 stations in the regions affected by wenchuan earthquake .
the pga maps of the ud ( up - down ) and horizontal ( combination of north - south and east - west ) vectors , respectively , show close relation with the co - seismic surface rupture zone ( figure 6 ( a ) and ( b )) .
previous studies have demonstrated that pga also could be used as a threshold to evaluate landslide susceptibility ( harp and wilson 1995 ; murphy et al. 2002 ; meunier et al. 2007 ; wang et al. 2011 ) .
recent study suggests that the co - seismic landslide of the wenchuan earthquake is closely related to the pga value ( wang et al. 2011 ) .
the co - seismic landslides are also directly controlled by the geological structures such as the co - seismic surface ruptures .
previous study has demonstrate the significant hanging wall effect ( ren and lin 2010 ) , thus according to thrust fault , landslide occurrence will mainly occupy the hanging wall side .
the co - seismic landslides triggered by the wenchuan earthquake mainly occurred on the hanging wall side where confined by the up - down and horizontal pga contour of 150 gal and 200 gal , respectively ( figure 6 ( a ) and ( b )) .
figure 6 relationship between pga and distribution of co - seismic landslides .
up - down pga ( a ) and horizontal pga ( b ) contours with the distribution of co - seismic landslides produced by the wenchuan earthquake .
discussion co - seismic landslide is a kind of special landslide directly triggered by strong earthquake ( harp and jibson 1996 ; gallousi and koukouvelas 2007 ; owen et al. 2008 ; ren and lin 2010 ; dai et al. 2011a ) .
therefore , the co - seismic landslides are related to the topographic situation and seismic shaking .
in landslide - related studies , roughness , hillslope and slope aspect analyses are the most widely used methods in geomorphologic studies ( dai and lee 2002 ; casson et al. 2005 ; ren and lin 2010 ; korup et al. 2007 ; chuang and fabbri 2008 ) .
after the 2008 mw 7.9 wenchuan earthquake , there are numerous co - seismic landslides were triggered ( ren and lin 2010 ; yin et al. 2010 godard et al. 2010 ; ouimet 2010 ; dai et al .
2011a , 2011b ) , which provide an ideal opportunity to check the co - seismic landslides characters .
based on the pre - earthquake dem data , we can analysis the topographic character of the landslided area .
comparing pre - earthquake and post - earthquake dem data , we can consequently analysis the topographic effects of the wenchuan earthquake .
in order to derive the high landslide density region , the threshold values of roughness , hillslope and slope aspect are set to be > 1.2 , > 30 , and between 90 and 270 , respectively .
landslide occurrence shows clearly correlation with the topographic conditions .
at all the three sites , over 50 % landslides occurred in the derived roughness , aspect and hillslope areas over the threshold values , respectively ( table 4 ) .
in order to evaluate the actual correlation between the above topographic parameters and landslide occurrence , we apply equal landslide density as the main factor .
equal landslide density is the ratio between the landslide areas and the corresponding areas derived by applying the roughness , hillslope and slope aspect thresholds .
among the three parameters , roughness is closely correlated to landslide rather than hillslope , i.e. , the highest equal area landslide density .
the intersection regions are derived from the intersection regions of the roughness , hillslope and slope aspect areas by applying the above thresholds .
therefore , the areas decreased significantly and the landslides occurred in the intersection region is lower than 40 % .
however , the intersection region is only 20 - 69 % of the areas derived from roughness , hillslope , and slope aspect map .
consequently , the equal area density of the co - seismic landslide is still the highest .
the geological structure of longmen shan thrust belt and seismic shake information of pga data both suggest that the co - seismic landslides mainly occurred in regions within the up - down and horizontal pga contour of 150 and 200 gal on the hanging wall side ( figure 6 ) .
post - earthquake dem analysis indicates the medium roughness and hillslope regions are becoming rougher and steeper after the wenchuan earthquake .
the roughest relief and steepest slopes are smoothed by the wenchuan earthquake ( figure 5 ) .
this indicates that the medium topographic roughness and hillslope are modified by the wenchuan - like strong earthquakes or landslides .
however , slope aspect did not change much , which indicates the formation and modification of slope aspect is not directly related to single tectonic events such as strong earthquake or landslide .
the roughest and steepest regions are co - seismically smoothed by the wenchuan earthquake .
thus , rough and steep regions are difficult to stand for a long geological epoch with repeated strong earthquakes .
previous studies have demonstrated that landslides have played an important role in the surface processes in longmen shan region ( meng et al. 2006 ) .
consequently , our results indicate that the co - seismic landslides are controlled both by topographic conditions and ground motion .
the strong earthquakes play an important role in local topographic formation and modification by triggering co - seismic landslides .
conclusions based on the data and analyses of the present study , we arrived at the following conclusions .
collaborative topographic analyses are efficient in landslide susceptibility evaluation .
the co - seismic landslides are related to the topographic roughness , hillslope and slope aspect .
the topographic thresholds are > 1.2 , between 90 and 270 , and 30 , respectively .
the co - seismic landslides are also directly related to pga values , which is usually occurred on hanging wall within the up - down and horizontal pga contour of 150 and 200 gal , respectively .
topographic conditions such as roughness and hillslope are controlled by tectonic event like the wenchuan earthquake , however , slope aspect is not modified by such event .
the roughest relief and steepest slope regions were smoothed after the wenchuan earthquake , however the medium roughness and slope regions became rougher and steeper , respectively .

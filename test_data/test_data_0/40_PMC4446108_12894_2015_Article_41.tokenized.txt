keywords igg4 - related disease igg4 - related kidney disease renal pelvis urothelial carcinoma issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background igg4 - related disease ( igg4 - rd ) has recently been proposed and is considered to involve conditions of systemic inflammatory fibrosis , including autoimmune pancreatitis , retroperitoneal fibrosis , chronic sclerosing cholangitis , and inflammatory pseudotumor .
igg4 - rd has now been reported in nearly every organ , though it was first identified in the pancreas and salivary glands [ 1 - 6 ] .
this disease manifests as organ enlargement or nodular / hyperplastic lesions in various organs concurrently or metachronously as a result of marked infiltration of lymphocytes and igg4 - positive plasma cells as well as fibrosis .
igg4 - related kidney disease ( igg4 - rkd ) is a comprehensive term for renal lesions associated with igg4 - rd , which mainly manifests as plasma cell - rich tubulointerstitial nephritis ( tin ) with increased igg4 + plasma cells and fibrosis ( igg4 - related tin , igg4 - tin ) [ 6 , 7 ] .
few data exist on the epidemiological and clinical features of large series of patients .
the mean age at diagnosis of the reviewed cases is 65 years , and 73 - 87 % are men [ 8 ] .
igg4 - rkd is common and predominantly involves the cortex of the kidney ; however , we report a rare case of igg4 - rkd involving a renal pelvic lesion that mimicked urothelial carcinoma .
case presentation a 53 - year - old woman was referred to our hospital with a space - occupying renal lesion that was discovered incidentally by an ultrasound scan .
the patient 's past medical history was positive for a gastric ulcer .
a physical examination revealed no significant abnormalities .
laboratory evaluations , including urinalysis , were within normal limits , and urinary cytology was negative .
computed tomography ( ct ) scans showed a soft - tissue density mass with an irregular border and mild homogeneous enhancement in the right renal pelvis and calyces ( fig. 1 ) .
a positron emission tomography / ct scan revealed soft - tissue density shadows with increased radionuclide uptake , which suggested a malignant lesion. fig. 1 abdominal computed tomography scans .
these scans showed a soft - tissue density mass with an irregular border and mild homogeneous enhancement in the right renal pelvis and calyces because pelvic carcinoma was suspected , a right ureteronephrectomy was performed .
gross examination revealed only thickened mucosa of the renal pelvis but no obvious abnormalities in the renal cortex or medulla ( fig. 2 ) .
a pathologic examination of the renal sections showed numerous lymphoid follicles and prominent fibrosis beneath the urothelial epithelium of the thickened mucosa ( fig. 3a ) .
additionally , numerous plasma cells and scattered eosinophils were identified in the interfollicular area ( fig. 3b ) .
the infiltrating lymphocytes and plasma cells did not show significant cytological atypia .
immunohistochemistry demonstrated that more than 40 % of the plasma cells were igg4 + ( fig. 3c , 3d ) .
all of these histologic changes were confined to the renal pelvis and did not involve the renal parenchyma .
the postoperative serum igg4 level was 3250 mg / l ( 80 - 1400 mg / l ) .
the patient was diagnosed with igg4 - rkd and no specific therapy was administered .
the postoperative serum igg4 level decreased from 3250 mg / l to 2450 mg / l at 2 months. fig. 2 gross examination revealed thickened mucosa of the renal pelvis fig. 3 pathologic examination of the renal sections .
( a ) .
numerous lymphoid follicles and prominent fibrosis beneath the urothelial epithelium of the renal pelvis ; ( b ) .
numerous plasma cells and scattered eosinophils were identified in the interfollicular area .
immunohistochemistry showed numerous igg + ( c ) and igg4 + ( d ) plasma cells discussion igg4 - rkd is a comprehensive term for renal lesions , including renal parenchymal lesions and renal pelvic lesions , related to igg4 - rd , which is a recently recognized and proposed clinical entity characterized by a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in igg4 + plasma cells with fibrosis that affects several organs [ 6 , 9 ] .
tin involving tubules and / or the interstitium of the kidney is the most dominant feature of igg4 - rkd [ 9 ] ; however , igg4 - rkd in the renal pelvis is rare [ 7 - 10 ] .
here , we report a rare case of igg4 - rkd that mimicked renal pelvic carcinoma .
a comprehensive english and non - english search for all articles pertinent to igg4 - rd of the renal pelvis was conducted using pubmed .
since naoto kuroda [ 11 ] first reported a case of igg4 - rd arising in the renal pelvis in 2009 , six cases of igg4 - rd of the renal pelvis have been reported previously in the world literature ( table 1 ) [ 12 - 16 ] .
the mean age at diagnosis was 59.8 years ( range : 49 to 80 years ) , with a male : female ratio of 1:1 .
most patients presented with renal lesions in the left kidney , with a left - to - right presentation ratio of 2:1 .
patients visited the hospital with or without complaints of non - characteristic presentations ( i.e. , flank pain ) , and none of the patients had hematuria .
hypocomplementemia and elevated serum igg are characteristic features of igg4 - rd. elevated serum igg and igg4 were found in all patients , but no hypocomplementemia was found in these seven cases , including our case ( table 1 ) .
although hypocomplementemia is a distinct feature of igg4 - rd , a relatively low proportion of patients actually have it. table 1 previous reports of igg4 - related kidney disease arising in the renal pelvis ref .
age ( years ) sex manifestations hypocomplementemia extra - renal lesions location serum igg4 therapy findings at follow - up 12 58 m none na igg4 - related md left elevated surgery + corticosteroid dead 13 80 m na na none right na surgery na 14 69 m na na none right elevated surgery + corticosteroid regression of the manifestations 11 49 f none none igg4 - related md left elevated surgery na 15 49 f bilateral lumbago na none left elevated corticosteroid regression of the manifestations 16 54 f left flank discomfort and palpebral edema none none left elevated corticosteroid regression of the manifestations f , female ; m , male ; md , mikulicz 's disease ; na , unavailable patients with igg4 - rd often have lesions in several organs , either synchronously or metachronously , although others may show the involvement of only a single organ .
renal lesions are recognized as extra - pancreatic manifestations of igg4 - rd ; the condition can develop as igg4 - rkd singly or associated with the lesions of other organs .
in previous cases , renal and extra - renal ( salivary gland ) involvements in igg4 - rd have presented simultaneously in two patients [ 11 , 12 ] .
in the current case , a systemic examination showed no other abnormal findings , inclusive of the salivary glands , lacrimal glands , and pancreas .
thus , the condition was diagnosed as igg4 - rd isolated in the renal pelvis without the involvement of other organs .
on the basis of the results of a diagnostic algorithm procedure and with references to several diagnostic criteria for aip , mitsuhiro kawano [ 6 ] proposed diagnostic criteria for igg4 - rkd : ( 1 ) presence of some kidney damage , as manifested by laboratory examination ; ( 2 ) kidney imaging studies showing abnormal renal findings , i.e. , multiple low - density lesions on enhanced ct ; ( 3 ) elevated serum igg4 levels exceeding 135 mg / dl ; ( 4 ) renal histology showing dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with infiltrating igg4 + plasma cells and fibrosis ; and ( 5 ) extra - renal histology showing prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with infiltrating igg4 + plasma cells .
the diagnosis is classified into three stages - - definite , probable , and possible - - according to the combinations of the above conditions .
in their diagnostic criteria , abnormal renal imaging findings were essential for making a definitive diagnosis .
in the present case , all of these conditions , including imaging studies that identified low - density lesions , pathologic examinations that revealed characteristic changes , and elevated serum igg4 , prompted the definitive diagnosis of igg4 - rkd .
a rapid response to corticosteroid therapy is a characteristic feature of igg4 - rd , and corticosteroids are typically the first line of therapy , although no controlled trial has been performed .
moreover , the protocol used for corticosteroid therapy varies among countries and institutions [ 1 ] .
because of the decreased level of serum igg4 after ureteronephrectomy , our patient received a close follow - up without corticosteroid therapy .
in the reported cases , patients with igg4 - rkd arising from the renal pelvis were treated according to different strategies , including surgical treatment alone for two patients , corticosteroid therapy alone for two patients , and surgical and corticosteroid treatment for the remaining two patients .
the renal lesions improved or resolved after the corticosteroid treatment in three patients who received corticosteroid treatment ( table 1 ) .
takahashi and colleagues [ 17 ] also found that lesions progressed in three igg4 - tin patients receiving no corticosteroid treatment or surgical resection and that lesions regressed in all igg4 - tin patients who underwent corticosteroid treatment .
these observations indicate that effective interventions should begin as soon as possible for irreversible fibrosis in igg4 - rkd .
because corticosteroid treatment has a remarkable effect in this type of disease , at least in the short term , this treatment is vital to avoid unnecessary surgery .
ct - guided biopsy or laparoscopic biopsy of the original tumor might help to rule out malignancy .
recent studies have revealed several characteristic clinical features of igg4 - rkd , including predominance in middle - aged to older men , frequent association with igg4 - rd in other organs , high levels of serum igg and igg4 , and a good initial response to corticosteroids .
however , longer follow - up data for igg4 - rkd , including relapse information , are still sparse .
takako saeki and his colleagues [ 18 ] retrospectively analyzed the longer - term clinical course of 43 patients with igg4 - tin in detail in a larger cohort .
this analysis included the largest series on the long - term outcomes of corticosteroid treatment of igg4 - rkd .
saeki et al. showed that 1 month after the start of treatment , most of the abnormal serology and radiology parameters had improved , and relapse of igg4 - related lesions occurred in 8 of 40 treated patients .
these studies indicate that the response of igg4 - rkd to corticosteroids is rapid and partial , and that irreversible lesions may remain , especially in patients with advanced renal damage .
patients with renal dysfunction should receive corticosteroid therapy , although spontaneous improvement of lesions can also occur in igg4 - tin and the indications for corticosteroid therapy in igg4 - rkd have not been established .
careful attention should be paid to renal function during follow - up without therapy [ 18 , 19 ] .
a large - scale prospective study is necessary to determine a more useful treatment strategy for igg4 - rkd .
conclusions we present a case of igg4 - rkd that mimicked urothelial carcinoma in the renal pelvis .
when a deep and solitary hypovascular tumor is detected in the kidney , we must consider igg4 - rkd as a differential diagnosis .
accordingly , elevated serum igg4 , radiologic findings , and pathologic examination may be helpful for the diagnosis .

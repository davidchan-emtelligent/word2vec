percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( peg ) has been widely accepted for patients who have no swallowing ability but have an intact gut .
its clinical application is mainly for nutritional support and decompression of the intestine in patients with bowel obstruction .
in this paper , we report external pancreatic juice drainage through a percutaneous endoscopic drainage tube in a patient with postoperative pancreatic juice leakage .
soon after this procedure , pancreatic juice leakage subsided .
this procedure was minimally invasive for the patient and may be a new application of peg to maintain the good quality of life ( qol ) in a patient with pancreatic juice leakage .

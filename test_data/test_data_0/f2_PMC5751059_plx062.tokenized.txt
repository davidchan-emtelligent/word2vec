it has been hypothesized that flowering plants at high elevation could be pollinated by local passerine birds given that low temperature limits insect activity .
in particular , species with large flowers are likely to be pollinated by large - body animals because a morphological fit between floral morphology and pollinator body could facilitate pollen transfer .
huang et al. investigated pollinator species and their visitation frequency in 15 rhododendron species from east himalayas .
the pollinator experiments excluding all pollinators , or just birds in the 15 species demonstrated that birds acted as pollinators in 2 / 3 studied rhododendron species , in support of the hypotheses .
abstract when insect activity is limited at low temperature , birds may be comparatively more important pollinators than insects for flowering plants .
it has been thought that many large - flowered rhododendron species are pollinated by local birds in the himalayan regions because most of these species flower in spring at high elevation with cool atmospheric temperature .
however , experimental evidence for the role of bird pollination in this hyperdiverse genus remains scarce .
to examine the role of birds and insects in pollination , we observed floral visitors to 15 rhododendron species with different floral sizes and abundant flowering individuals in the eastern himalayas , southwest china .
to examine the role of birds and insects in female reproductive success in each species , cages were used to exclude birds but not insects from visiting flowers and net bags were used to exclude all floral visitors .
inflorescences where visitation was excluded did not produce fruits in any of the rhododendron species , indicating that sexual reproduction in these species depended on pollinator visitation .
bird visits were generally less frequent than bee visits in the studied species .
however , in the nine species on which bird visitors were observed , fruit and / or seed set were greatly reduced in inflorescences caged to exclude birds but not bees , compared to open - pollinated inflorescences .
in the other six species on which bird visitation was not observed , fruit and seed set did not differ significantly between caged and open inflorescences except in one species ( r. wardii ) .
manipulations to achieve selective exclusion of visitors demonstrated that birds could be effective pollinators for 10 out of 15 studied rhododendron species in the eastern himalayas .
floral characteristics of these rhododendron species and weather conditions might favour the evolution of bird pollination systems in the east himalayas .

- h.h introduction it has been estimated that 87.5 % of flowering plant species rely on animals for pollination ( ollerton et al. 2011 ) .
most pollinators are insects but birds are important pollinators for some species in about 65 plant families ( cronk and ojeda 2008 ) .
previous comparative studies have shown that shifts from bee pollination to bird pollination have occurred independently in numerous lineages of flowering plants ( kay et al .
2005 ; specht 2006 ; whittall and hodges 2007 ; wilson et al .
2007 ; sakai et al .
2013 ) , whereas reversal is much less common ( wolfe et al. 2006 ; wilson et al. 2007 ). of these two groups of pollinators , birds tend to be larger and can be more active in cool temperature than insects .
it has been proposed that bird pollination enhances plant reproductive success at low atmospheric temperature when weather conditions are unfavourable for bees ( cruden 1972 ) .
one hypothesis for the shift from bee to bird pollination is the high ratio of pollen receipt to pollen removal ( wilson et al. 2007 ) .
a successful pollination depends on a vector removing pollen from one flower and delivering pollen to another flower .
unlike bird foraging behaviour , which involves little grooming , bees ( e.g. bumblebees ) usually groom pollen from their body into corbiculae where it is unavailable for pollen transfer to the next flower visited .
empirical studies have shown that pollinators that rarely exhibit grooming behaviour are more efficient at delivering pollen ( muchhala and thomson 2010 ) .
in addition , birds are considered to become important supplemental pollinators in habitats where insect activity is limited .
for example , high mountains , where cold and / or rainy weather conditions are frequent , are less conducive to insect activity ( stiles 1971 , 1978 ; cruden 1972 ) .
furthermore , insects are generally short - lived and overwinter as immature stages or in hibernation ( i.e. many bees , see goulson 2003 ) , and are rarely available for plants that flower in winter or early spring when the temperature is low .
rhododendron ( ericaceae ) is one of the largest plant genera with around 1000 evergreen or deciduous species mainly in asia ( chamberlain et al .
1996 ) , including many endemic species in the himalayan region .
most species in this region have conspicuous flowers .
rhododendron species usually blossom from late winter to early summer when the temperature is low and the activity of insects is restricted .
rhododendron can be a model genus in which to examine the divergent evolution of floral traits related to pollinator shifts because the flower morphology varies widely in the same region .
in diverse plant groups , selection on floral morphology has been shown to be mediated in part by morphometric interactions with the mouth or body part length of pollinators across regional floras ( inouye 1980 ; inouye and pyke 1988 ; nilsson 1988 ; alexandersson and johnson 2002 ; more et al. 2012 ) .
based on morphological studies of nearly 300 tropical species from the malayan region ( southeast asia to northern australia ) , stevens ( 1976 ) estimated that one - third of rhododendron species may have evolved bird pollination , particularly large - flowered species at high elevations .
although insects have been observed to be effective pollinators in several rhododendron species ( stout et al. 2006 ; stout 2007 ; tagane et al. 2008 ; ma et al. 2010 , 2015 ; kudo et al. 2011 ; epps et al .
2015 ) , anecdotal observations showed that sunbirds and passeriforms feed on nectar in numerous species ( huang 2011 ; georgian et al. 2015 ) .
however , there has been no experimental examination of the effectiveness of bird pollination in this well - known genus .
to test the effectiveness of birds and insects as pollinators of 15 rhododendron species , we addressed the following specific questions : ( i ) given that low temperature limits insect activity , do warm - blooded birds act as floral visitors in some rhododendron species ?
( ii ) how do birds contribute to pollination in these species ?
( iii ) given that a morphological fit between floral morphology and pollinator body could facilitate pollen transfer ( see stevens 1976 ) , do birds tend to visit relatively large rhododendron flowers ?
we investigated pollinator species and their visitation frequency in 15 rhododendron species that had abundant flowering individuals with a wide variation in flower size .
we conducted two types of pollinator experiments by excluding all pollinators , or just birds , to compare the pollination role of birds and insects in these rhododendron species .
methods species and study area rhododendron ( ericaceae ) is a species - rich genus of perennial shrubs or trees .
because their flowers are usually large and brightly coloured and flower in spring , rhododendron species are important horticultural plants worldwide .
the diversity of rhododendron is especially high in east asia , with over 500 species endemic to southwest china .
floral and vegetative traits are highly variable , but rhododendron flowers are characterized by an open - shaped funnelform , campanulate or tubular corolla which is formed by petal fusion .
there are usually 5 - 10 stamens surrounding one exserted style with a capitate stigma .
pollen grains released from the poricidal anthers are connected together by sticky viscin threads .
the field survey was conducted in cangshan national nature reserve ( n 25degrees43 ' ; e 100degrees01 ') and laojunshan nature reserve ( n 26degrees39 ' ; e 99degrees44 ') , yunnan province , southwest china .
these areas are in the hengduan mountains , east himalayas , with elevations from 1800 to 4200 m ( see details in table 1 ) , usually comprising a mosaic of deciduous broad - leaved and coniferous forests , pastures and scrubby stream mountain vegetation .
we investigated floral traits of 15 rhododendron species in which abundant flowering individuals were available and conducted pollinator selective exclusion experiments on these species .

we observed pollinator visits in at least 10 half - hour censuses in each species with the aid of binoculars .
for each rhododendron species , between early morning ( 0800 h ) and late afternoon ( 1800 h ) , we haphazardly selected at least three flowering inflorescences on three different individuals within a distance of 5 - 10 m containing 60 - 400 flowers for pollinator observations .
only visitors that contacted anthers and stigmas were recorded .
visitation frequency was obtained as the mean number of visits per flower per hour for each visitor species .
pollinator exclusion experiment to evaluate the role in pollination of birds and insects , we conducted two types of pollinator exclusions , caged and bagged , during early april and late may 2013 .
on 6 - 12 flowering individuals of each species , flower buds on three inflorescences per plant were randomly selected for the following treatments : ( i ) exclusion of all potential visitors using small - mesh ( 0.33 x 0.33 mm ) nylon nets ; ( ii ) exclusion of bird visitors using large - mesh ( around 30 x 25 mm ) metal cages made with aluminium wire permitting insects to access floral rewards ( cages were placed around flower buds and fixed to the supporting stems ; fig. 1c ) ; and ( iii ) natural pollination in which unmanipulated inflorescences were open to all floral visitors .
to examine whether the cages interfered with the foraging behaviour of insects , we observed visitors to the caged and open ( unmanipulated ) inflorescences of four species at the beginning of the inflorescence manipulations .
the behaviour of bees on caged inflorescences was similar to that on the open inflorescences in r. beesianum , r. clementinae , r. cyanocarpum and r. lacteum .
these initial investigations indicated that our bird - cage treatments were effectively excluding bird visits but not insects ( see also kunitake et al. 2004 ; botes et al. 2009 ; fang et al. 2012 ) .
we labelled 6 - 12 flower buds in each inflorescence with plastic tags and cotton threads ( one inflorescence usually contained 10 - 20 flowers ) , so that each treatment involved more than 50 labelled flowers per species .
in september when fruits matured , we collected all fruits that were tagged from infructescences .
matured and aborted seeds ( which were basically undeveloped ovules with obviously smaller than the developed seeds ) per fruit were counted (> 25 fruits were obtained from each treatment per species ) .
seed set per fruit was number of matured seeds divided by total number of ovules ( i.e. matured + aborted seeds ) .

measurement of flower size to examine whether flower size relates to pollinator type , we measured the floral opening diameter and corolla - tube length of 15 rhododendron species from early april to middle june in 2012 and 2013 .
the maximum and minimum separation distance of two opposite petal tips were measured to calculate the mean floral opening diameter .
the corolla - tube length was measured from the base of the ovary to the top of the corolla gap .
thirty to 50 flowers per species ( 3 - 5 flowers from each of 10 randomly chosen plants ) were measured using an electronic digital caliper to an accuracy of 0.01 mm. data analysis the following generalized linear model ( glm ) analyses were conducted by the glm function in r version 3.1.0 ( http :// cran.r - project.org /) .
the difference in visitation frequency between birds and insects within each rhododendron species with bird pollination was compared with gaussian distribution and log - link function .
differences in fruit set ( the ratio of fruits / flowers ) and seed set ( seeds / ovules ) under the three pollination treatments per species were analysed with binomial and gaussian distribution and logit link function .
differences in flower size and elevation with pollinator types among 15 species were analysed to estimate whether bird - pollinated flowers are larger and appear at higher elevation than insect - pollinated flowers , with gaussian distribution and identity link function .
to examine whether shrub rhododendron species appear in higher elevation than the tree species , life forms of the 15 species were recorded and mean values of elevation were compared with gaussian distribution and identity link function .
results pollinator types and abundance bees ( including bumblebees and honeybees ) were observed visiting flowers in all 15 rhododendron species .
bombus avanus , b. festivus , b. friseanus and b. hypnorum were the four most frequent bumblebees ( fig. 1f - i ) , while apis cerana was the most frequent honeybee .
to access nectar at the base of flowers , bees usually landed towards the upper region of the corolla where there was a visible honey guide .
bee visitation frequency ranged from 0.04 ( in r. sinogrande ) to 1.12 visits flower - 1 h - 1 ( r. virgatum ) .
bird visitation was observed in nine rhododendron species which generally had large flowers ( tables 1 and 2 ) .
on the other six species , we observed no birds but only insect visitation .
interestingly , in the large - flowered r. wardii bird visitation was not observed but pollinator exclusion experiments suggested birds serving as pollinators ( see below ) .
butterfly and moth visitors to these rhododendron flowers were generally rare .
however , in r. simsii we observed 48 visits by a butterfly pachliopta aristolochiae in 24 observation censuses and 74 visits to r. virgatum by a hawkmoth macroglossum pyrrhosticta in 26 observation censuses .

two sunbird species aethopyga gouldiae and a. ignicauda ( nectariniidae ) , respectively , visited three and four rhododendron species .
the red - whiskered bulbul pycnonotus jocosus monticola ( pycnonotidae ) acted as floral visitors for four rhododendron species in cangshan mountain ( table 1 ) .
the two sunbirds were the most frequent passerine visitors to five of the nine species , and other passerine visitors from the four bird families were also observed sucking nectar in five species ( r. beesianum , r. cyanocarpum , r. delavayi , r. rex and r. sinogrande ) .
for example , the visitation of a. gouldiae accounted for 92.1 % of the total bird visits ( n = 214 ) in r. oreotrephes ( fig. 1c ) .
dark - backed sibia heterophasia melanoleuca ( leiothrichidae ) was mainly observed in r. delavayi , accounting for 82.2 % of bird visits ( 101 ) .
visitation by p. jocosus monticola accounted for 76.9 % of bird visits ( 168 ) to r. cyanocarpum ( fig. 1e ) .
visitation by yuhina occipitalis ( zosteropidae ) accounted for 83.2 % bird visits in r. sinogrande ( 465 ) .
overall , visitation frequency of birds ( 0.12 +/ - 0.01 visits flower - 1 h - 1 ) was generally lower ( estimate = 0.25 , se = 0.12 , t = 2.12 , p = 0.050 ) than that of bees ( 0.37 +/ - 0.12 visits flower - 1 h - 1 ) in the nine species with bird visitation ( table 2 ) .
pollination roles of the two pollinator groups birds were not observed to approach the caged inflorescences in any species but flowers in cages were accessible to diverse insects .
nylon - net - bagged inflorescences did not produce fruits in any rhododendron species , indicating that sexual reproduction in these species depended on pollinator visitation .
compared to open - pollinated inflorescences , the fruit set of caged flowers from which birds were excluded was significantly decreased in eight species but not in the five species with only bee visitation ( table 3 ) .
only in two species in which bird visitation was observed ( r. cyanocarpum and r. lacteum ) , fruit set was not significantly affected by the exclusion of birds .
in all of the nine species on which bird visitation was observed , and in r. wardii , the seed set of caged inflorescences was significantly decreased .
in the other five species , on which bird visitation was not observed , seed set did not differ significantly between caged and open - pollinated inflorescences ( table 4 ) .

in the 10 species with potential bird pollination the diameter of the floral opening was significantly larger ( 45.83 +/ - 2.50 mm ) than in the other five species ( 28.72 +/ - 4.74 ) ( estimate = - 17.12 , se = 4.83 , t = - 3.54 , p = 0.004 ) , while the corolla tube was significantly longer ( 31.18 +/ - 2.74 mm ) than in the five species without bird pollination ( 13.87 +/ - 2.99 ) ( estimate = - 17.31 , se = 4.44 , t = - 3.90 , p = 0.002 ) .
the 10 species in which seed set significantly decreased by exclusion of bird visits were distributed at relatively high elevation ( mean +/ - se , 3305 +/ - 172 m ) compared to the five species on which only insect visits were observed ( 2690 +/ - 198 m ) ( estimate = - 615.0 , se = - 281.7 , t = - 2.18 , p = 0.048 ) ( table 1 ) .
these results suggest that birds tended to visit relatively large rhododendron flowers ( table 4 ) and distributed at higher elevations .
discussion our field observations and flower manipulations in 15 rhododendron species indicated that passerine birds were likely to contribute to the pollination of 10 species , although bees were often the most frequent visitors .
our experimental exclusion of birds showed that fruit set and seed set were reduced by 46.9 % and 61.9 % , respectively , in the 10 rhododendron species with bird visitation , while fruit / seed set of caged inflorescences did not decrease in the five rhododendron species without bird visitation ( tables 3 and 4 ) .
while birds , butterflies and sphingid moths were considered as probable pollinators for rhododendron species ( ward 1937 ; stevens 1976 , 1985 ) , bees have been reported to be major pollinators for r. ponticum ( stout et al. 2006 ; stout 2007 ) , r. eriocapum and r. indicum ( tagane et al. 2008 ) , r. cyanocarpum and r. delavyi ( ma et al. 2010 ) , r. aureum ( kudo et al. 2011 ) and r. ferrugineum ( milne and abbott 2008 ) .
on the basis of floral traits it has been proposed that some rhododendron species in tropical malaysia were pollinated by bats ( stevens 1976 , 1985 ; danet 2012 ) , but experimental evidence is not yet available .
in the yellow - orange flowered rhododendron calendulaceum which was flowering in summer at an elevation of 1160 m in southwestern virginia , usa , epps et al .
( 2015 ) observed two butterfly species and numerous bee species visiting the flowers , but only butterfly wings were the primary vehicle of pollination .
in this species , bee visitors did not contact both anthers and stigmas ; they functioned as either pollen or nectar robbers .
caging inflorescences to exclude butterflies resulted in almost complete fruit failure , demonstrating that butterflies were effective pollinators in this rhododendron species .
anecdotal observations showed that three butterfly species , rather than bees , were major floral visitors in two populations of r. indicum ( tagane et al .
2008 ) , and two bumblebee species , rather than butterflies , were effective pollinators in r. cyanocarpum in yunnan province ( ma et al. 2015 ) .
in the latter species we observed two bird species ( p. affinis and p. jocosus monticola ) acting as pollinators .
we noted one butterfly species visiting r. simsii and it was a frequent visitor to r. rubiginosum in laojunshan mountains , yunnan province ( y .
- p. song et al. , central china normal university , unpubl .
data ) , but further studies are needed to see whether the butterfly serves as an effective pollinator .
an investigation of floral visitors to six wild rhododendron species in subtropical forest in hong kong , south china , showed that most insect visitors were large bees ( a. cerana , bombus eximius and xylocopa spp. ) , hawkmoths and butterflies ( ng and corlett 2000 ) .
the fork - tailed sunbird ( aethopyga christinae ) was observed occasionally visiting the four rhododendron species but bird contribution in pollination was neglected because of its low visitation rate ( ng and corlett 2000 ) .
the four species had relatively larger flowers than the other two species without bird visitation based on their measurements of floral opening diameter and tube depth , consistent with our observation that large flowers are likely to evolve bird pollination .
in a recent study of floral visitors with the aid of time - lapse camera trap observations in the red - flowered rhododendron floccigerum franchet in yunnan province , georgian et al .
( 2015 ) proposed that four bird species ( a. gouldiae , garrulax affinis , h. melanoleuca and yuhina diademata ) and bumblebees were potential pollinators , given that birds' heads and bees' bodies were fully immersed in the corolla , but the other four bird species were nectar robbers .
however , an exclusion experiment to eliminate large pollinators has not been used ( see epps et al. 2015 ) .
our direct pollinator observations and bird - exclusion experiments in the field demonstrated that birds played an important role in pollination in 10 out of 15 rhododendron species studied in southwest china .
we failed to see birds visiting r. wardii but further confirmation needs more efforts .
we observed that two or three bird species could act as potential pollinators in one rhododendron species as georgian et al .
( 2015 ) observed four bird species visiting r. floccigerum , in which gould 's sunbird ( a. gouldiae ) and dark - backed sibia ( h. melanoleuca ) were shared pollinators for different rhododendron species that were studied here .
the winter - flowering leucosceptrum canum with dark - purple nectar was visited by 11 bird species in western yunnan , china ( zhang et al. 2012 ) .
among these 11 birds , the blue - winged minla ( minla cyanouroptera ) and the oriental white - eye ( zosterops palpebrosa ) were the most common visitors and were considered to be potential pollinators .
these observations might suggest that bird pollinators were not specialists for certain plant species in east himalayas .
our investigation of 15 species with diverse floral morphology showed that species with bird pollination tended to occur at higher altitude than insect - pollinated species ( table 1 ; huang 2015 ) .
studies have shown that the low temperature is likely to restrict the activity of insects but not birds ( see fang et al. 2012 ; sun et al .
2017 ) which should be more reliable pollinators at high altitude where low temperature and rain are frequent ( stiles 1971 ) .
in rhododendron species with large flowers , successful pollen transfer requires a ' mechanical fit ' for large animals with the spatial separation of sexual organs from the nectar reward ( see armbruster et al. 2011 ) .
previous observations showed that bees were too small to contact the stigma in rhododendron species with relatively large flowers ( mismatches between flower and insect morphology ) while collecting nectar or pollen ( huang 2015 ) .
visitation by such bees is likely to result in high pollen removal but low pollen receipt as they rarely contact stigmas during pollen collection , an inefficient pollination mode ( wilson and thomson 1991 ) .
in contrast , the foraging behaviour of large animals such as birds , bats and lepidoptera ( butterflies and large moths ) could increase the chances of effective pollen transfer through efficient contact with pollen and stigmas when they probe flowers for nectar .
we observed that passerine birds perched on the stem below inflorescences of rhododendron species and leaned forward to suck nectar from the base of the corollas .
pollen grains with viscin threads were seen attached to the head or throat of the bird .
compared to most bees , which usually groom pollen , behaviour that contributes much pollen loss during pollen removal , pollen grains of rhododendron species attached to heads or throats of birds and bats or to the wings of lepidoptera are available for stigma contact , facilitating pollen transfer between flowers .
conclusion our field observation and pollinator exclusion experiments showed that bird pollination was likely to be involved in 10 of 15 studied rhododendron species in east himalayas .
in cold weather , birds are important pollinators because they forage earlier in the morning than bees ( see kunitake et al. 2004 ; sun et al. 2017 ) .
we noted that bird visitation declined after sunrise in our field observations in rhododendron species .
early birds drinking nectar could partly explain why previous observations in the middle of the day did not observe bird pollinators .
birds are likely to evolve higher pollen transfer efficiency than bees because of less grooming and reducing pollen loss during pollen removal , but an experimental test of this hypothesis is strongly needed .
the role of other potential pollinators including bats , butterflies and large moths remains to be explored in future studies of rhododendron flowers .

background four human coronaviruses are currently known to infect the respiratory tract : human coronaviruses oc43 ( hcov - oc43 ) and 229e ( hcov - 229e ) , sars associated coronavirus ( sars - cov ) and the recently identified human coronavirus nl63 ( hcov - nl63 ) .
in this study we explored the incidence of hcov - nl63 infection in children diagnosed with respiratory tract infections in belgium .
methods samples from children hospitalized with respiratory diseases during the winter seasons of 2003 and 2004 were evaluated for the presence of hcov - nl63 using a optimized pancoronavirus rt - pcr assay .
results seven hcov - nl63 positive samples were identified , six were collected during january / february 2003 and one at the end of february 2004 .
conclusions our results support the notation that hcov - nl63 can cause serious respiratory symptoms in children .
sequence analysis of the s gene showed that our isolates could be classified into two subtypes corresponding to the two prototype hcov - nl63 sequences isolated in the netherlands in 1988 and 2003 , indicating that these two subtypes may currently be cocirculating .
background coronaviruses are large , enveloped , positive stranded rna - viruses [ 1 ] .
the viral rna genome is 27 - 32 kb in size , capped , polyadenylated and encapsidated in a helical nucleocapsid .
the envelope is studded with long , petal - shaped spikes , giving the virus particle a characteristic crown - like appearance .
three distinct groups of coronaviruses have been described based on serological affinity and genome sequence .
coronaviruses can infect humans and a variety of domestic animals and can cause highly prevalent diseases such as respiratory , enteric , cardiovascular and neurologic disorders [ 2,3 ] .
until recently only three human coronaviruses were thoroughly studied .
human coronavirus oc43 ( hcov - oc43 ; group 2 ) and human coronavirus 229e ( hcov - 229e ; group 1 ) were identified in the 1960s .
they are responsible for 10 - 30 % of all common colds , and infections occur mainly during winter and early spring [ 4 - 7 ] .
a third novel human coronavirus , sars - cov , was identified as the causal agent during the 2002 - 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) [ 8 - 10 ] .
phylogenetic analysis showed that the sars - cov does not closely resemble any of the three previously known groups of coronaviruses , and therefore a tentative fourth group of coronaviruses was suggested [ 11,12 ] .
however , an early split - off of the sars - cov from the coronavirus group 2 lineage has also been suggested [ 13,14 ] .
a new human coronavirus associated with respiratory illness , hcov - nl63 , was recently identified by a research team in the netherlands [ 15 ] .
the virus was isolated in january 2003 from a nasopharyngeal aspirate of a 7 - month - old child suffering from bronchiolitis , conjunctivitis and fever .
screening of specimens from patients with respiratory symptoms identified seven additional hcov - nl63 infected individuals , both children and adults , between december 2002 and february 2003 .
the complete viral genome sequence was determined .
the characteristic genome organisation of coronaviruses can be observed : the 5 ' two - third of the genome contains two large open reading frames ( orf ) , orf1a and orf1b .
in the 3 ' part of the genome , genes encoding four structural proteins are found : spike ( s ) , envelope ( e ) , membrane ( m ) , and nucleocapsid ( n ) .
the hemagglutinin - esterase ( he ) gene , characteristic for group 2 coronaviruses , is not present in hcov - nl63 .
sequence analysis demonstrated that hcov - nl63 shares 65 % sequence identity with hcov - 229e .
phylogenetic analysis confirmed that hcov - nl63 is a new group 1 coronavirus , most closely related to hcov - 229e and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv ) [ 15 ] .
shortly after van der hoek and colleagues published their discovery of the new human coronavirus hcov - nl63 , a second research group described the characterization of essentially the same virus [ 16 ] .
the virus was isolated from a nose swab sample collected from an 8 - month - old child suffering from pneumonia in the netherlands in april 1988 .
real - time rt - pcr assays were designed for screening of respiratory tract samples .
four additional hcov - nl63 positive samples , from children aged 3 months to 10 years , were detected between november 2000 and january 2001 .
hcov - nl63 can be considered as a new important cause of respiratory illnesses and two different subtypes might be currently cocirculating in the human population [ 15 ] .
in this study we wanted to explore the incidence of hcov - nl63 infection in children diagnosed with respiratory tract infections in belgium .
methods isolates and patients we studied 309 isolates from 279 patients with severe respiratory symptoms collected from january 2003 until march 2004 at the university hospital in leuven , belgium .
these isolates originated from bronchoalveolar lavages , pharyngeal swabs , nasopharyngeal aspirates , and sputum samples .
routine diagnostic testing was performed for respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) , influenza virus , parainfluenza virus and adenovirus .
no prior amplification by cell culture was performed .
the results of diagnostic tests for rsv were negative for 244 isolates , while 65 isolates were positive for rsv .
patients ranged in age from 1 month to 16 years , with a mean age of 2 years .
the temporal distribution of the isolates corresponded to the yearly rsv epidemic period : 236 samples were collected from january to june 2003 and 73 samples were recovered during the first trimester of 2004 ( figure 1a ) .

( b ) patients infected with hcov - nl63 and hcov - oc43 .
a single hcov - 229e positive sample was isolated in april 2003 ( not shown ) .
pancoronavirus rt - pcr assay rna was extracted from the collected specimens by using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit ( qiagen , westburg , the netherlands ) according to instructions of the manufacturer .
screening of the samples was performed by amplifying a 251 bp fragment of the polymerase gene using the following primer set : cor - fw ( 5 ' - acwcarhtvaayytnaartaygc - 3 ') and cor - rv ( 5 ' - tcrcayttdggrtartccca - 3 ') ( figure 2 ) .
these one - step rt - pcr assays ( onestep rt - pcr kit ; qiagen ) were undertaken in a 50 mul reaction volume containing 10 mul rna - extract , 10 mul 5x qiagen onestep rt - pcr buffer , 2 mul dntp mix ( final concentration of 400 mum of each dntp ) , 1.8 mul qiagen onestep rt - pcr enzyme mix ( a combination of omniscript and sensiscript reverse transcriptase and hotstartaq dna polymerase ) , 4 mum of each primer , and rnase - free water to 50 mul .
the reaction was carried out with an initial reverse transcription step at 50degreesc for 30 min , followed by pcr activation at 95degreesc for 15 min , 50 cycles of amplification ( 30 sec at 94degreesc ; 30 sec at 48degreesc ; 1 min at 72degreesc ) , and a final extension step at 72degreesc for 10 min in a geneamp pcr system 9600 thermal cycler ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) .
pcr - products were run on a polyacrylamide gel , stained with ethidium bromide , and visualized under uv - light .

shown is the alignment of 14 coronaviral sequences of a conserved region of the polymerase gene .
the forward ( cor - fw ) and reverse ( cor - rv ) primer sequences are shown at the bottom ( y = c / t , w = a / t , v = a / c / g , r = a / g , h = a / t / c , n = a / c / t / g ) .
the coordinates of cor - fw and cor - rv are 14017 and 14248 , respectively , in the hcov - nl63 complete genome sequence .
the 14 coronavirus sequences used here are available from genbank under the following accession numbers : hcov - nl63 , ay567487 ; hcov - 229e , af304460 ; infectious bronchitis virus ( ibv ) , z30541 ; sars - cov , ay313906 ; hcov - oc43 , ay391777 ; pedv , af353511 ; bovine coronavirus ( bcov ) , af391541 ; transmissible gastroenteritis virus , af304460 ; mhv , x51939 ; phev , af124988 ; sialodacryoadenitis virus ( sdav ) , af124990 ; turkey coronavirus ( tcov ) , af124991 ; canine respiratory coronavirus ( crcv ) , ay150273 ; feline infectious peritonitis virus ( fipv ) , af124987 .
rt - pcr assays for hcov - nl63 samples that were found positive for hcov - nl63 were confirmed using one - step rt - pcr assays , which amplified four different regions of the hcov - nl63 genome .
amplification of a 314 - bp gene fragment in the nucleocapsid region was performed with two specific hcov - nl63 primers : n5 - pcr1 ( 5 ' - ctgttactttggctttaaagaacttagg - 3 ' , nt 26695 - nt 26721 ) and n3 - pcr1 ( 5 ' - ctcactatcaaagaataacgcagcctg - 3 ' , nt 26982 - nt 27008 ) .
secondly a 237 - bp fragment in orf1b was amplified using the primers repsz - 1 and repsz - 3 described by van der hoek and colleagues [ 15 ] .
a third rt - pcr assay was carried out on the hcov - nl63 positive samples amplifying a 839 - bp fragment with orf1a specific primers : ss5852 - 5p and p4g1m - 5 - 3p [ 15 ] .
these one - step rt - pcr assays were performed essentially as described above .
they were carried out using 5 mul rna - extract and 0.6 mum of each primer .
only 45 cycles of amplification were run and annealing temperature was set at 50degreesc .
furthermore a 663 bp fragment of the spike gene was amplified using a rt - nested pcr .
the outer primer set sinl5 ( 5 ' - gagtttgattaagagtggtaggttg - 3 ' , nt 20391 - nt 20415 ) and sinl3 ( 5 ' - aacagtgtagttaactacacgg - 3 ' , nt 21068 - nt 21089 ) were used in a one - step rt - pcr , performed as described above , using 10 mul of rna - extract and an annealing temperature of 48degreesc .
a nested pcr was carried out with the inner primer set sinl5n ( 5 ' - ggttgttgttacgcaataatggtcgt - 3 ' , nt 20411 - nt 20436 ) and sinl3n ( 5 ' - acacggccattatgtgtggtgac - 3 ' , nt 21051 - nt 21073 ) .
the nested reaction mix was composed of 1 unit taq polymerase , 1 mul of a 25 mm dntp - mix , 10 mul 5x buffer c ( pcr optimizer kit , invitrogen , the netherlands ) , and 30 pmol of forward and reverse primer in a 50 mul reaction volume .
as template 10 mul of the outer pcr product was added .
the cycling conditions were as follows : an initial denaturation at 94degreesc for 5 min , followed by 40 cycles of amplification ( 45 sec at 94degreesc , 45 sec at 54degreesc , 1 min at 72degreesc ) , and a final extension of 5 min at 72degreesc .
pcr - products were run on a polyacrylamide gel , stained with ethidium bromide , and visualized under uv - light .
the amplicons were purified using the qiaquick pcr purification kit ( qiagen ) and sequenced with the respective primer pairs using the abi prism bigdye terminator cycle sequencing reaction kit ( version 3.1 ) on an abi prism 3100 dna sequencer ( applied biosystems ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
positive and negative controls were included in each pcr experiment .
the hcov - nl63 positive control was rna isolated from a hcov - nl63 culture .
sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis of the amplicons chromatogram sequencing files were inspected with chromas 2.2 ( technelysium pty ltd , helensvale , australia ) , and contigs were prepared using seqman ii ( dnastar , madison , wi , usa ) .
the obtained consensus sequences were compared with the prototype hcov - nl63 sequences available in genbank database release 142.0 using blast analysis ( ncbi blast server ) .
multiple sequence alignments were prepared using clustal x version 1.82 [ 26 ] , and manually edited in the genedoc alignment editor [ 27 ] .
phylogenetic analysis was conducted using mega version 2.1 [ 28 ] .
nucleotide sequence accession numbers the sequences determined in this study have been deposited in the genbank sequence database under accession numbers ay758276 to ay758301 .
rt - pcr assays for hcov - oc43 and hcov - 229e our collection of samples was also screened using the pancoronavirus rt - pcr assay for the presence of hcov - oc43 and hcov - 229e .
positive results were confirmed by one - step rt - pcr using hcov - oc43 and hcov - 229e specific primer pairs located in the membrane glycoprotein region ( oc43 - fw : 5 ' - ggcttatgtggccccttact - 3 ' , nt 28580 - nt 28599 ; oc43 - rv : 5 ' - ggcaaatctgcccaagaata - 3 ' , nt 28894 - nt 28913 ; 229e - fw : 5 ' - tggccccattaaaaatgtgt - 3 ' , nt 24902 - nt 24921 ; 229e - rv : 5 ' - cctgaacacctgaagcaat - 3 ' , nt 25456 - nt 25475 ) [ 18 ] .
one - step rt - pcr and sequence analysis were performed essentially as described above .
annealing conditions during the rt - pcr assay were modified : the annealing temperature was set at 55degreesc .
results pancoronavirus rt - pcr assay a pancoronavirus rt - pcr assay is a usefull tool to test for all coronaviruses in a clinical sample .
besides quick screening for several pathogens in one assay , it supplies the possibility to identify previously unknown coronaviruses .
the consensus rt - pcr assay as described by stephensen et al. , designed to amplify all known coronaviruses , is not able to detect hcov - nl63 because of several mismatches with the primer sequences [ 15,17 ] .
we modified these consensus primers based on an alignment of the hcov - nl63 prototype sequence and 13 other coronavirus sequences ( figure 2 ) .
to determine whether the newly designed pancoronavirus rt - pcr assay efficiently amplifies a broad range of coronaviruses the rt - pcr assay was tested on cell culture supernatant of the four known human coronaviruses and three animal coronaviruses : hcov - nl63 , hcov - oc43 , hcov - 229e , sars - cov , feline infectious peritonitis virus ( fipv ) , porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus ( phev ) , and murine hepatitis virus ( mhv ) .
amplification of the expected 251 bp region was observed for all tested coronaviruses ( figure 3 ) .
the sensitivity of the pancoronavirus rt - pcr assay was assessed by testing tenfold dilutions of hcov - nl63 and hcov - oc43 rna .
while 50 copies of hcov - oc43 rna copies per mul nasopharyngeal aspirate could be detected , the sensitivity for hcov - nl63 was a bit lower i.e. 5 x 103 rna copies per mul nasopharyngeal aspirate .
figure 3 gel electrophoresis after pancoronavirus rt - pcr assay .
the indicated band of 251 bp corresponds with the expected amplicon size .
as a marker molecular weight marker vi was used ( boehringer mannheim , germany ) .
detection of hcov - nl63 in clinical specimens the pancoronavirus rt - pcr assay was used for screening of specimens from hospitalized patients with respiratory symptoms collected between january 2003 and march 2004 .
samples , from which a 251 bp fragment could be amplified , were further identified by sequencing using the pancoronavirus primers .
we studied 309 specimens with a temporal distribution that corresponded with the yearly rsv epidemic period ( figure 1a ) .
a total of 244 samples were found negative for rsv by diagnostic testing .
the 279 patients in this study comprised of 211 patients aged < 2 years ( 75.6 %) , 68 aged 2 - 16 years ( 24.4 %) .
we detected hcov - nl63 in 7 samples ( 2.3 %) .
one positive sample was collected at the end of january 2003 and coinfection with rsv type b was present .
five of the positive samples were collected within a ten - day period at the end of february 2003 , and one positive sample was collected at the end of february 2004 , which showed coinfection with adenovirus and parainfluenza virus ( figure 1b , table 1 ) .
the seven positive samples were obtained from one patient aged 1 month , four patients of 1 year , one patient of 2 years , and one patient of 16 years .
the patient files showed that all subjects suffered from respiratory tract illness and some had underlying disease ( table 1 ) .

amplification of a fragment of the nucleocapside gene and orf1b was carried out .
sequence analysis of the n gene fragments and the orf1b fragments showed 98 - 100 % similarity to the prototype hcov - nl63 sequences available in the genbank database ( ay567487 , ay518894 ) .
a third one - step rt - pcr was carried out for each positive sample to amplify part of the orf1a gene .
sequence analysis of the orf1a pcr - products revealed 99 % sequence identity with both hcov - nl63 prototype sequences available in genbank .
a neighbor - joining phylogenetic tree was constructed based on an alignment of the orf1a nucleotide sequences from the hcov - nl63 positive samples and the available hcov - nl63 sequences in genbank .
hcov - 229e was used as an outgroup .
the dendrogram shows that all hcov - nl63 sequences cluster together , but two subclusters can be observed ( figure 4 ) .

inspection of the two full genome hcov - nl63 sequences available in genbank demonstrates that especially the aminoterminal region of the spike protein can be very divergent .
therefore we decided to amplify this region to investigate the variability of these region in our patients .
an rt - nested pcr assay was used to amplify part of the s gene .
these partial spike sequences showed 98 % similarity with the hcov - nl63 prototype strains .
an alignment of the s gene sequences from the belgian samples , partial spike sequences from the positive samples identified in the netherlands ( data not shown ) , and the prototype hcov - nl63 sequences , was used to constitute a neighbor - joining phylogenetic tree .
the neighbor - joining tree was evaluated by 500 bootstrap pseudoreplicates .
two clusters can again be observed ( figure 5 ) .

accession numbers : hcov - nl63 , ay567487 ; hcov - nl , ay518894 .
pedv was used as an outgroup .
detection of hcov - oc43 and hcov - 229e screening of our sample collection for the presence of hcov - oc43 and hcov - 229e was also performed .
we detected hcov - oc43 in 7 of 309 samples ( 2.3 %) and hcov - 229e in one sample ( 0.3 %) .
the seven hcov - oc43 positive samples were collected during the winter and early spring of 2003 and 2004 .
the sample in which we detected hcov - 229e was collected in april 2003 .
the positive samples were confirmed by rt - pcr using specific hcov - oc43 and hcov - 229e primer pairs that amplify part of the m gene [ 18 ] .
the hcov - oc43 and hcov - 229e partial membrane sequences of the contemporary belgian strains showed 97 - 99 % similarity with the hcov - oc43 and hcov - 229e prototype sequences in genbank .
discussion rsv , influenza viruses , adenoviruses , and parainfluenzaviruses are probably the most important viral agents of severe respiratory diseases .
however , a substantial part of respiratory tract infections can not be attributed to any known pathogen .
underlying conditions and immunosuppression largely determine the impact of respiratory viruses on individuals [ 19 ] .
the common cold viruses hcov - oc43 and hcov - 229e have also been associated with more severe lower respiratory tract conditions in infants and immunocompromised patients [ 20 - 23 ] .
the clinical symptoms associated with hcov - nl63 infections still need to be determined , but there are some indications that hcov - nl63 can cause severe respiratory illnesses in children and immunocompromised adults [ 15,16 ] .
we detected hcov - nl63 , using a pancoronavirus rt - pcr , in patients suffering from relatively severe respiratory diseases necessitating hospitalization .
these positive samples were collected from children aged 1 month to 16 years .
two patients suffered from severe underlying disease : one patient suffered from smith - lemli - opitz syndrome , a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to a primary enzymatic defect in the cholesterol metabolism .
a second patient was diagnosed with vater , a syndrome characterized by the sporadic association of specific birth defects or abnormalities such as vertebrae and vascular anomalies , anal atresia , trachea and esophagus problems and renal anomalities .
all hcov - nl63 infected patients established a complete recovery from their respiratory symptoms .
one - step rt - pcr assays were used to detect and confirm these positive samples .
results from epidemiological surveys conducted in the 1970 's have led to the conclusion that human coronaviruses are distributed worldwide and circulate during seasonal outbreaks [ 22 ] .
our results indicate that hcov - nl63 is the causal agent in a significant portion of respiratory diseases of unknown etiology .
we detected hcov - nl63 in respiratory samples collected in february 2003 , with a frequency of 7.1 % , and during february 2004 , with a frequency of 2.5 % .
these results seem to support the tendency of human coronaviruses to circulate mainly during the winter season [ 7,24 ] .
however , in this study , sampling was only performed from january to may during the yearly rsv epidemic period , while no samples from the summer and autumn months were screened .
the first publication on hcov - nl63 showed that the virus circulated in amsterdam during the winter months of 2002 / 2003 [ 15 ] .
more recently another set of amsterdam samples was screened , obtained during the winter of 2001 / 2002 and 2003 / 2004 .
hcov - nl63 was found in one trachea sample obtained in february 2002 , and in two oropharyngeal aspirates from december 2003 and january 2004 , respectively ( data not shown ) .
combined with the data that we present here from belgium , these findings confirm that hcov - nl63 reappears each winter season similar to the previously known respiratory viruses .
recently , research teams from australia , japan and canada , have submitted partial hcov - nl63 sequences to the genbank database ( ay600442 - ay600446 , ay662694 - ay662698 , ay675541 - ay675553 ) .
this indicates that this newly discovered human coronavirus has a worldwide distribution .
sequence analysis of the highly conserved nucleocapsid region showed that the belgian isolates are similar to the two prototype hcov - nl63 complete genome sequences in genbank isolated in the netherlands in 1988 and 2003 .
furthermore , phylogenetic analysis of part of the orf 1a region of our patients showed the same subclusters of hcov - nl63 that were described previously [ 15 ] ( figure 4 ) .
this finding supports the suggestion that several hcov - nl63 subtypes with distinct molecular markers are cocirculating , also in belgium .
a large insert in the 5 ' part of the s gene of hcov - nl63 compared with hcov - 229e has been described [ 15,16 ] .
both hcov - nl63 complete genome sequences show only 89 % sequence identity in this spike insert region , which implies that there are at least two different hcov - nl63 subtypes .
sequence analysis of this spike insert region revealed that our samples show similarity to both prototype hcov - nl63 subtypes , which was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis .
the partial s gene sequences cluster together with the two prototype hcov - nl63 sequences in two different groups ( figure 5 ) .
this confirms that the hcov - nl63 subtypes first isolated in 1988 and 2003 are cocirculating .
when analysing the dendrograms based on orf1a and s gene sequences , a discordance in the clustering pattern of some hcov - nl63 isolates ( e.g. hcov - nl and nl - p223 ) can be observed , suggesting a possible recombination event .
further research of complete genome sequences of these isolates is required .
drawing conclusions based on phylogenetic analysis of one single gene therefore requires caution as the true phylogeny can only be demonstrated by analysing complete genome sequences .
screening of our sample collection for the presence of hcov - oc43 and hcov - 229e revealed seven hcov - oc43 positive samples and only one hcov - 229e positive sample .
all positive samples were isolated during winter and early spring , which is concordant with the results of previous epidemiological studies .
hcov - oc43 infected samples were mainly identified during february 2003 and february 2004 ( figure 1b ) .
these data show that the epidemic seasons of hcov - oc43 and hcov - nl63 coincide .
the positive samples were collected from children aged 1 to 12 years , whom all suffered from respiratory symptoms .
the very low detection rate of hcov - 229e compared with the frequent detection of hcov - nl63 , might imply that hcov - nl63 , closely related to hcov - 229e , is currently more important as a causal agent of respiratory diseases .
at the moment , there are no data concerning cross - neutralization between hcov - 229e and hcov - nl63 .
in theory , such cross - neutralization might be possible , since both viruses are relatively closely related species belonging to coronavirus group 1 .
antigenic cross - reactivity has already been demonstrated between sars - cov and group 1 coronaviruses tgev , fipv and ccov [ 25 ] .
the development of a pancoronavirus rt - pcr assay using a primer set that matches all known coronaviruses might be useful for the identification of new coronaviruses .
this pancoronavirus rt - pcr - assay can also be used as a diagnostic tool to detect any of the four currently known human coronaviruses in clinical samples .
conclusions human coronavirus nl63 is a new important respiratory pathogen that can cause severe respiratory infections in children .
sequence analysis of the hcov - nl63 isolates detected in our study demonstrates that our belgian isolates can be classified into two subtypes corresponding to the two prototype hcov - nl63 sequences isolated in the netherlands in 1988 and 2003 .
our findings indicate that these two subtypes may currently be cocirculating .

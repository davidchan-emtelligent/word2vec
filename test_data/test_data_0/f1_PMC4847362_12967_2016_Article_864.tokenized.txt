t cell homeostasis is critical to determine the potency of the gvt effect .
recent studies have shown the association of the ctla - 4 polymorphisms with the outcome after hla - identical sibling allogeneic hsct .
methods in this study , we focused on four ctla - 4 polymorphisms , and analyzed the impact of donor genotypes and haplotypes on the conditions of 152 acute leukemia patients ( all 83 ) after related hla - haplotype - mismatched transplantation .
the four snp genotypes ( - 1661 , - 318 , ct60 and + 49 ) were determined by taqman snp genotyping assays .
results all recipients of donors with + 49 gg showed significantly lower os ( 67.7 vs. 90.3 % , p = 0.015 ) than those with ga + aa. multivariate analyses showed that + 49 gg was an independent risk factor for os ( hr : 0.306 , 95 % ci 0.111 - 0.842 , p = 0.022 ) . 23 all patients receiving mdli showed significantly lower os with + 49 gg donor than those with ga + aa ( 30.0 vs. 83.1 % , p = 0.003 ) .
the haplotype analysis revealed only three haplotypes in the donor population - 1661 / - 318 / ct60 /+ 49 i.e. , acgg , acaa and gtga , the frequencies were 64.1 , 19.4 and 16.5 % , respectively .
donors with and without the acgg / acgg haplotype had the same effect on transplant outcomes as those with + 49 gg and + 49 ga + aa. conclusion in summary , the ctla - 4 + 49 gg and the haplotype acgg / acgg reduced the overall survival in all after allo - hsct from the related hla - haplotype - mismatched donor , knowledge of the ctla - 4 polymorphism and haplotype may provide useful information for donor selection and individual application of immunosuppressive agents and immunotherapy .

disease relapse remains a major cause of transplant failure .
although several clinical variables including disease status at transplant , stem cell source , graft - versus - host disease ( gvhd ) prophylaxis , and conditioning regimen contribute to the risk of relapse , the predictors of graft - versus - tumor ( gvt ) effect remain largely elusive .
t cell homeostasis is critical to determine the potency of the gvt effect [ 1 - 3 ] .
cytotoxic t lymphocyte antigen - 4 ( ctla - 4 or cd152 ) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is a t cell activation negative regulator .
after the initial recognition of the antigen by the t cell receptor complex , the primary positive co - stimulatory signal is the t cell cd28 , which binds with cd80 / cd86 on antigen - presenting cells .
ctla - 4 is expressed in t cells after activation and exerts its negative regulatory effects by competing with cd28 for cd80 / cd86 and consequently blocking downstream activation pathways through transendocytosis and degradation .
ctla - 4 is highly conserved among mammals , thereby indicating the importance of inhibiting proliferation and inducing peripheral tolerance in t cells [ 4 ] .
ctla - 4 is a receptor expressed on the activated t cell surface and is a homolog of cd28 that is responsible for t cell activation .
although both ctla - 4 and cd28 bind with the two ligands b7.1 ( cd80 ) and b7.2 ( cd86 ) expressed on apcs , ctla - 4 binds b7 molecules with higher affinity and avidity than cd28 .
ctla - 4 gene polymorphisms correlate with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus [ 5 , 6 ] , type 1 diabetes mellitus [ 7 , 8 ] and graves' disease [ 9 ] .
recent studies have shown the association of the ctla - 4 polymorphisms [ - 1661 ( rs4553808 ) , - 318 ( rs5742909 ) , + 49 ( rs231775 ) , and ct60 ( rs3087243 )] with the outcome after hla - identical sibling allogeneic hsct [ 10 - 12 ] .
we reported our approach to related hla - haplotype - mismatched t cell - replete transplants in > 1000 subjects in the last 10 years [ 13 , 14 ] .
in the present study , we focused on these four ctla - 4 polymorphisms and analyzed the impact of donor genotypes and haplotypes in 152 acute leukemia ( all 83 ) patients on the outcomes after related hla - haplotype - mismatched transplantation .
patients and methods patients between january 2010 and december 2012 , a total of 152 consecutive al patients who underwent allo - hsct at the peking university institute of hematology and the survivors until day 100 of post - allo - hsct were included in this study .
all patients received related hla - haplotype - mismatched t - cell - replete transplants .
each subject received a graft from a family member sharing one hla haplotype with the recipient but differed to a variable degree for the hla - a , b , and dr antigens of the unshared hla haplotype .
all patients provided informed consent for treatment under a protocol reviewed and approved by the peking university institute of hematology .
the characteristics of the patients and transplantations are summarized in table 1 .

busulfan / cyclophosphamide ( bu / cy ) - based conditioning therapy was administered ( 4 mg / kg / d bu orally for 3 days , and 1.8 g / m2 / day cy i.v. for 2 days ) .
a single dose of semustine ( 250 mg / m2 ) was orally administered to all human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) - mismatched and related patients .
they were also given cytarabine ( 4 g / m2 / day ) and anti - thymocyte globulin ( 2.5 mg / kg / day , sangstat , lyon , france ) i.v. for 2 and 4 consecutive days , respectively .
all subjects received granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( g - csf ) - mobilized bm and blood cells .
prophylaxis against gvhd involved the treatment with cyclosporine a ( csa ) and short - term methotrexate ( mtx ) with mycophenolate mofetil .
on day 9 pre - hsct , csa ( 2.5 mg / kg ) was treated i.v. , and mycophenolate mofetil was administered orally ( 0.5 g / 12 h ) from day 9 before the transplantation until day 30 after the transplantation .
at 30 day after the transplantation , 0.25 g of mycophenolate mofetil was administered every 12 h for 1 - 2 months .
on day 1 , mtx ( 15 mg / m2 ) was administered i.v. and 10 mg / m2 mtx was given on days 3 , 6 , and 11 after transplantation .
immunosuppression regimens were discontinued for all patients who showed al relapse or increased recipient chimerism while still taking immunosuppressive agents .
sample preparation and ctla - 4 genotyping donor bm or pb samples from 152 allo - hsct patients were obtained to investigate ctla4 polymorphisms after transplantation .
dna molecules from donor bm and pb samples were extracted using the qiagen midi kit and qiagen mini kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) .
the concentration and purity of each dna sample were evaluated by measuring the optical density at 260 and 280 nm in a uv spectrometer .
the four snp genotypes of ctla - 4 , namely , - 1661 ( rs4553808 ) , - 318 ( rs5742909 ) , ct60 ( rs3087243 ) , and + 49 ( rs231775 ) , were determined by taqman snp genotyping assays ( applied biosystems ) according to manufacturer instructions .
pcr was performed in a 10 mul reaction volume containing 5 mul taqman universal master mix ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) , 1 mmol of each primer , 1 mmol of each probe , and 1 mmol of genomic dna .
thermal cycle conditions were 95 degreesc for 10 min , 40 cycles of 95 degreesc for 15 s , and 60 degreesc for 1 min .
all pcr and endpoint fluorescent readings were analyzed using an abi 7300 real - time pcr system ( applied biosystems ) .
minimal residual disease ( mrd ) monitoring and definition the mrd level was determined via real - time quantitative pcr and four - color flow cytometry ( fcm ) on bone marrow aspirates after hsct [ 18 , 19 ] .
the mrd markers included leukemia - associated immune phenotypes ( laip ) and leukemia - associated genes ( wt1 , aml1 - eto , cbfb - myh11 , and bcr - abl ) assayed in diagnostic specimens .
more than 0.001 % of laip via four - color fcm or more than 10 - 4 of reciprocal fusion genes or 0.6 % of wt1 gene via real - time quantitative pcr in bm samples was considered as abnormal .
the definition of mrd was two consecutive abnormalities for fcm or leukemia - associated genes during a 15 - 30 days interval .
modified donor lymphocyte infusion ( mdli ) after diagnosing the mrd and the increasing recipient chimerism [ 20 ] , pre - emptive mdli was performed to prevent relapse after hsct .
post - transplantation immune suppression was immediately tapered and subsequently discontinued in patients who were in less than 100 days posttransplant .
patients who were in more than 100 days posttransplant had the immune suppression immediately discontinued .
in patients without active gvhd , mdli was given based on the dli donor availability .
anti - leukemia chemotherapy were administered to patients 48 - 72 h before mdli ; this therapy consisted of 20 mg aclacinomycin and 150 mg / m2 cytarabine ( both administered for 7 days ) in acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) patients and 1 g / m2 mtx ( for 1 day ) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( all ) patients .
for mdli , g - csf - mobilized peripheral blood stem cells were administered instead of the more common , unstimulated , donor blood lymphocytes .
after mdli , patients received immunosuppressive drugs such as csa or mtx to prevent gvhd .
patients who received mdli from an hla - haploidentical donor received gvhd prophylaxis for 4 - 6 weeks at the discretion of the attending physicians and depending on the gvhd status of the patient after mdli .
the starting dose of csa was 2.5 mg / kg / day and was adjusted to maintain a plasma concentration of > 100 ng / ml. moreover , 10 mg mtx was administered i.v. on days 1 , 4 , and 8 and weekly thereafter for 2 - 6 weeks [ 15 , 16 ] .
chimerism and mrd status were monitored at 1 , 2 , 3 , 4.5 , 6 , 9 and 12 months after the interventions , and at 6 - month intervals thereafter .
study definitions neutrophil engraftment had an absolute neutrophil count ( anc ) of > 0.5 x 109 / l for three consecutive days .
platelet engraftment without transfusion had platelet count of > 20 x 109 / l for seven consecutive days .
the diagnosis and grading of gvhd was established based on published criteria [ 15 - 17 ] .
patients with malignancies in first or second complete remission ( cr1 or cr2 , respectively ) of al were categorized as " standard risk. " patients in more than the second complete remission of al , not in remission , or had high - risk cytogenetics , such as t ( 9 ; 22 ) and t ( 4 ; 11 ) , were classified as " high risk. " moreover , complete remission ( cr ) was defined as bm blasts < 5 % , absence of blasts with auer rods , absence of extramedullary disease , anc of > 1.0 x 109 / l , platelet count of > 100 x 109 / l , and independence of red cell transfusions .
partial remission ( pr ) included all hematological criteria of cr , bm blast percentages from 5 to 20 % , and a decrease of pretreatment bm blast percentage by a minimum of 50 % .
patients who did not achieve either of the mentioned standards ( for cr or pr ) were classified as no remission ( nr ) .
relapse was defined as recurrence of bm blasts > 5 % , reappearance of blasts in the blood , or development of extramedullary disease infiltrates at any site whereas relapse rate was the probability of leukemia recurrence .
over survival ( os ) was calculated from the date of transplantation until death or last observation of patients' life .
disease - free survival ( dfs ) was described as the probability of being alive and free of disease at any point in time .
mrd targets were also regularly examined within 2 weeks before transplantation .
the mrd status before hsct was defined as abnormal if it contained more than 0 0.001 % of laip via four - color fcm , more than 10 - 4 of reciprocal fusion genes , or more than 0.6 % of wilms tumor gene 1 ( wt1 ) [ 18 , 19 , 21 ] .
refractory disease included nr and pr patients before hsct .
a diagnosis of proven or probable invasive fungal disease ( ifd ) was determined by the revised european organization for research and treatment of cancer and mycoses study group ( eortc / msg ) criteria [ 22 ] , only proven and probable cases were included in the determination of the cumulative incidence of ifd .
cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) infection was defined as isolation of cmv virus or detection of viral proteins or nucleic acid in any body fluid or tissue specimen .
statistical analysis the reference date of 1 october 2013 was used to define the end of the follow - up period .
the distribution of genotypes in the cases were calculated with hardy - weinberg equilibrium test .
the statuses of dfs and os were calculated according to the kaplan - meier statistics .
the differences in dfs and os between groups were calculated using the log - rank test .
a two - sided p value of 0.05 was regarded as significant .
the multivariate cox regression analysis was applied to examine the independence of predictive factors .
variables considered in the multivariate models were donor sex ( male vs. female ) , donor age ( continuous variable ) , hla mismatching locus , donor - recipient blood type , status of disease before hsct , mrd status before hsct , ifd and cmv infection .
cmv serological state before hsct was not considered as a covariate , because only 1 % of subjects were low risk ( recipient - , donor - ) for cmv reactivity .
the independence of categorical parameters was calculated using the chi2 - test or fisher 's exact test , whereas the distribution of continuous variables was determined using the mann - whitney u - test .
results general patient information all patients achieved neutrophil engraftment at a mean time of 12 day ( 10 - 25 day ) .
seven patients achieved platelet engraftment after 100 day , and one died at 5 months before the platelet engraftment .
the median time of platelet engraftment was 15 day ( 6 - 225 day ). by the 1 october 2013 end point , the median follow - up time was 633.5 day ( 112 - 1369 day ) .
a total of 48 patients ( 31.6 %) developed acute gvhd , and 8 ( 5.3 %) developed acute gvhd higher than the grade ii. chronic gvhd developed in 81 patients ( 53.3 %) , and extensive chronic gvhd developed in 27 patients ( 17.8 %) .
overall , 34 patients ( 22.4 %) relapsed after transplantation ( median 172 day , 32 - 1076 day ) .
a total of 31 patients ( 20.4 %) died because of relapse ( n = 19 ) or other causes of transplantation - related mortality ( n = 12 ; infection , n = 9 ; cerebral hemorrhage , n = 1 ; hemorrhage of digestive tract , n = 1 ; and post - transplantation lympho - proliferative disorders , n = 1 ) ( table 1 ) .
frequencies of ctla - 4 genotypes and haplotypes the frequencies at which the four ctla - 4 snps were expressed in the 154 donors are listed in table 2 .
the snp - 1661 allele a was blocked by the snp - 318 allele c. the snp - 1661 , snp - 318 , ct60 , and + 49 were included in one haplotype block that was constructed using the international hapmap database .
the haplotype analysis revealed only three haplotypes in the donor population : - 1661 * a / - 318 * c / ct60 * g /+ 49 * g ( acgg ) , - 1661 * a / - 318 * c / ct60 * a /+ 49 * a ( acaa ) , and - 1661 * g / - 318 * t / ct60 * g /+ 49 * a /( gtga ) .
in this cohort , the frequencies of the haplotype acgg , acaa and gtga were 64.1 , 19.4 and 16.5 % , respectively .
all of the donors were distributed among the six haplotype combinations ( table 3 ) .

however , no significant differences in agvhd ii - iv , cgvhd , and extensive cgvhd were observed between recipients of donors with the + 49gg and ga + aa ( p = 0.927 , p = 0.478 , p = 0.956 ) .
univariate analyses and multivariate analyses did not reveal that the + 49 gg was a risk factor for agvhd iii - iv ( hr : 0.204 , 95 % ci 0.041 - 1.010 , p = 0.051 ) .
recipients of donors with ct60 gg in all showed significantly lower incidence of extensive cgvhd ( 10.5 vs. 29.2 % , p = 0.034 ) than those with ga + aa ( fig. 3b ) , univariate analyses and multivariate analyses reveal that the ct60 gg was a risk factor for extensive cgvhd ( hr : 3.067 , 95 % ci 1.027 - 9.159 , p = 0.045 ) .
moreover , no significant difference in agvhd iii - iv , agvhd ii - iv , cgvhd , and extensive cgvhd in the snp - 1661 , snp - 318 was observed. fig. 3 the effect of + 49 and ct60 genotype and haplotype on gvhd in al and all patients .

no significant difference was observed in the cmv infection between the donors with + 49 gg and with ga + aa ( p = 0.870 ) .
effect of the ctla - 4 haplotype on transplant outcome snp - 1661 , snp - 318 , ct60 , and + 49 were included in one haplotype block that was constructed using the international hapmap database .
the haplotype analysis revealed only three haplotypes in the donor population , as follows : - 1661 * a / - 318 * c / ct60 * g /+ 49 * g ( acgg ) , - 1661 * a / - 318 * c / ct60 * a /+ 49 * a ( acaa ) and - 1661 * g / - 318 * t / ct60 * g /+ 49 * a ( gtga ) .
we therefore focused our analysis on the acgg and acaa haplotypes and examined their association with the outcome after allo - hsct .
donors with and without the acgg / acgg haplotype have the same effect on transplant outcome as that of donors with the + 49 gg and + 49 ga + aa. donors without and with the acaa haplotype have the same effect on transplant outcome as that of donors with the ct60 gg and ct60 ga + aa. discussion in this study , we focused on the four ctla - 4 snp polymorphisms and analyzed the impact of donor genotypes and haplotypes on the outcome in al patients after related hla - haplotype - mismatched transplantation .
although the association of ctla - 4 snp and the outcome after allo - hsct have been previously reported [ 10 - 12 ] , we are the first to report the relationship between ctla - 4 snp and the transplantation outcome in al patients from related hla - haplotype - mismatched donor .
the human ctla - 4 gene is located on 2q33 .
the ctla - 4 gene is composed of four exons and has two isoforms , a full - length isoform ( flctla - 4 ) and a soluble form ( sctla - 4 ) that lacks exon 3 that encodes the transmembrane domain .
flctla - 4 down - regulates t cell responses by inducing cell cycle arrest and blocking cytokine production [ 23 , 24 ] .
many studies have reported increased sctla - 4 protein levels in patients with autoimmune disease [ 25 - 28 ] .
serum sctla - 4 has the potential to bind to cd80 / cd86 [ 29 , 30 ] ; sctla - 4 blocks the interaction of flctla - 4 with cd80 / cd86 and thereby enhances t - cell activation .
ct60 maps at the 3 ' untranslated region of ctla - 4 could play a role in the alternative splicing by which sctla - 4 is generated .
the ct60 a allele has been reported to be associated with a higher level of the sctla - 4 mrna than the ct60 g allele [ 10 , 31 ] .
the snp - 318 is located at the ctla - 4 promoter region .
previous studies showed that the - 318 c allele is correlated with a lower promoter activity and a lower ctla - 4 expression than those observed with the - 318 t allele [ 32 , 33 ] .
the snp - 1661 is in the upstream promoter region of ctla - 4 .
although the - 1661 is less characterized than other snps in the ctla - 4 gene [ 34 ] , it has been associated with increased risk of multiple sclerosis [ 35 ] , type 1 diabetes mellitus [ 36 , 37 ] systemic sclerosis [ 38 ] , oral squamous cell carcinoma [ 39 ] , and lymph node involvement in breast cancer [ 40 ] .
testing the recombinant proteins of the various ctla - 4 variations , or isolating t cells from the patients with benign versus malignant ctla - 4 snps to test overall ctla - 4 - mediated immunosuppression , can provide further evidence to test the impact of this snp and haplotype .
further research should be carried out in this field in the future .
in our study , the ctla - 4 + 49 gg and the haplotype acgg / acgg reduced the overall survival in all after allo - hsct from the related hla - haplotype - mismatched donor ( 67.7 vs. 90.3 % , p = 0.015 ) .
the probable mechanisms that all patients'outcomes might be influenced by ctla - 4 polymorphisms were as followed : the ctla - 4 exon 1 , where the + 49 polymorphism is located , encodes the leader peptide of the protein , which is responsible for ctla - 4 trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum .
several previous studies reported that the ctla - 4 + 49 polymorphism alters the inhibitory effect of ctla - 4 on t - cell activation [ 31 , 41 - 43 ] .
ctla - 4 proteins contribute to the suppressor function of regulatory t cells ( tregs ) , a protein that is present in tregs and the expression of which in tregs is dependent on foxp3 is ctla - 4 [ 44 ] .
mice with tregs that lack ctla - 4 protein expression were shown recently to develop lethal autoimmunity , revealing that treg expression of ctla - 4 was necessary for immune suppression and prevention of in vivo autoimmunity [ 45 , 46 ] .
ipilimumab , a ctla - 4 antibody , has been studied in melanoma .
recently , hodi et al .
[ 47 ] have shown that ipilimumab improves os in patients with melanoma .
in patients with melanoma , the g allele of rs4553808 in ctla - 4 was associated with improved response to ipilimumab [ 48 ] .
in a phase i clinical trial of ipilimumab after allo - hsct , complete remission was achieved in two patients with hodgkin 's lymphoma and partial remission in one patient with refractory mantle cell lymphoma , suggesting that targeting ctla - 4 is feasible [ 49 ] .
the mechanism of why all patients' outcomes might be influenced by ctla - 4 polymorphisms and haplotype needs further investigated .
recently pd - l1 , pd - l2 , lag - 3 , ido1 etc .
have been reported to correlate to immune defects [ 50 ] , to study the relation of ctla4 , pd - l1 , pd - l2 , lag - 3 , ido1 , etc. with the evolution of immune response of hsct patients will be needed in the future .
recipients of donors with + 49 gg showed significantly higher incidence of agvhd iii - iv ( 10.2 vs. 2.2 % , p = 0.031 ) than those with ga + aa. recipients of donors with ct60 gg in all showed significantly lower incidence of extensive cgvhd ( 10.5 vs. 29.2 % , p = 0.034 ) than those with ga + aa. the effectiveness of the ctla - 4 polymorphisms and haplotype on gvhd after allo - hsct needs further investigated .
the rates of agvhd iii - iv appear lower than our previous report , which reported a rate of 13.4 % [ 14 ] .
the probable reasons were as followed : ( 1 ) the survivors until day 100 of post - allo - hsct were included in this study ; ( 2 ) the improvement in gvhd prevention and management over the years as well as the different proportions of donor gender and family relationships in the two reports , [ 13 , 14 ] with more male donors and more child - to - parent pairs in the current study population ( data not shown ) .
before that published report , since 2009 , we intentionally chose young ( especially offspring ) , male donors who were identified to be associated with a lower rate of agvhd under our protocol .
perez - garcia et al .
[ 10 ] reported that the g genotype of ct60 confers an inferior os and rfs in 536 hla - identical sibling donor , but lower incidence of agvhd .
they did not report the impact on cgvhd .
vannucchi et al .
[ 51 ] reported no impact of + 49 and ct60 on os and rfs in 147 hla - identical matched unrelated donor transplantation , but identified the worse outcome of ct60 with aa genotype on agvhd and cgvhd .
in an italian cohort , azarian et al .
[ 11 ] did not observe any influence of + 49 or ct60 on os , rfs , or agvhd in 225 hla - identical sibling donor , but reported a worse outcome on cgvhd with a g genotype of ct60 .
similar findings were reported in a tunisian cohort [ 52 ] .
in a recent study of t - depleted allogeneic transplant , the aa genotype of ct60 was associated with an inferior os and rfs [ 53 ] .
mossallam et al .
[ 54 ] reported that egyptian recipient with + 49 ga / gg allele and lower dfs and os compared with aa genotype ( hr : 2.17 , p = 0.03 , 95 % ci 1.05 - 4.48 , and hr : 2.54 , p = 0.01 , 95 % ci 1.16 - 5.54 ) .
the ctla - 4 polymorphism displays frequencies that are dependent on ethnicity .
according to the hapmap project , the frequencies of the ct60 a allele are 0.460 , 0.209 and 0.181 in european , asians , and sub - saharan africans , respectively .
moreover , the frequencies of the + 49 a allele are 0.611 , 0.637 and 0.314 in european , sub - saharan africans , and asians , respectively .
perez - garcia et al .
[ 10 ] reported ct60 genotypes in 536 european donors : gg ( 24.1 %) , ga ( 47.0 %) , and aa ( 24.1 %) .
metaxas et al .
[ 55 ] reported ct60 genotypes in 79 dli europeans donors : gg ( 45.5 %) , ga ( 32.9 %) , and aa ( 21.5 %) .
murase et al .
[ 56 ] reported 147 japanese donors with ct60 genotypes : gg ( 46.9 %) , ga ( 44.9 %) , and aa ( 8.2 %) .
in our result , 152 chinese donors had ct60 genotype : gg ( 63.2 %) , ga ( 34.9 %) , and aa ( 1.9 %) .
perez - garcia et al .
[ 10 ] reported 536 european donors with + 49 genotype , as follows : gg ( 11.0 %) , ga ( 42.4 %) , and aa ( 46.6 %) .
murase et al .
[ 56 ] reported 147 japanese donors with + 49 genotype : gg ( 37.4 %) , ga ( 49.7 %) , and aa ( 15.6 %) .
in our result , 152 chinese donors had + 49 genotype : gg ( 38.8 %) , ga ( 50.7 %) , and aa ( 10.5 %) .
some of the ctla - 4 polymorphisms display frequencies that are different from all the other ethnic groups .
the exact effect of the ctla - 4 polymorphism on transplant outcome should be determined in different cohorts with a substantially larger number of subjects .
the snps - 1661 , - 318 , ct60 , and + 49 were included in one haplotype block .
the snp - 1661 allele a was blocked by the snp - 318 allele c. the haplotype analysis revealed only three haplotypes in the donor population , in this cohort , the frequencies of the haplotype acgg , acaa , and gtga were 64.1 , 19.4 and 16.5 % , respectively .
all the donors were distributed among the six haplotype combinations .
in our study , recipients of donors with the acgg / acgg haplotype showed a significantly lower os in all than recipients of donors without the acgg / acgg haplotype .
murase et al .
[ 56 ] reported that the presence of the ctla - 4 caa ( - 318 , + 49 , ct60 ) haplotype reduced the risk of relapse and improved survival in 147 japanese hla - identical sibling donors .
they reported that three ctla - 4 haplotypes , ctla - 4 ( - 318 , + 49 , ct60 ) classified as cgg , caa and tag , are present in the japanese population .
therefore , further investigation is required to elucidate the effect of the ctla - 4 haplotype on the anti - tumor activity of donor - derived t cells .
our group [ 57 ] recently reported selection of the best donor among the related hla - haplotype - mismatched t - cell replete transplants .
our data suggest that choosing young , male , nima - mismatched donors is considerable .
moreover , some potentially important variables such as dsa , cmv serological state , kir disparity , and other causes may have effect on donor selection .
all recipients of donors with + 49 gg or with haplotype acgg / acgg showed significantly lower os than ga + aa or without acgg / acgg .
these results hinted that a donor with + 49 gg or with haplotype acgg / acgg might be inferior to that with ga + aa or without acgg / acgg .
ctla - 4 polymorphisms and haplotype might be as a potential marker of best donor selection .
the kaplan - meier analysis showed a significant lower os in all patients accepting mdli + 49 gg donor or with haplotype acgg / acgg than those with ag + aa or without acgg / acgg ( p = 0.003 ) .
metaxas et al .
[ 55 ] reported that the presence of a donor ct60 aa or ga genotype vs. a gg genotype was an independent factor for remaining in the complete chimerism / remission post - dli ( or = 2.61 vs. 0.42 , respectively , p = 0.05 ) .
these results provided evidence of an independent linkage of the ctla - 4 - snps and haplotype with an improved chance of sustained cr post - dli , ctla - 4 - snps and haplotype may act as a surrogate marker for donor lymphocyte infusion outcome after allo - hsct for acute leukemia .
this means ctla - 4 genotyping might be a substantial diagnostic test before dli administration .
conclusion in summary , some of the ctla - 4 polymorphisms display frequencies that are different among the different ethnic groups .
in our study the ctla - 4 + 49 gg and the haplotype ( acgg / acgg ) reduced the overall survival in all patients after allo - hsct from related hla - haplotype - mismatched donor .
furthermore , knowledge of the ctla - 4 polymorphism and haplotype may provide useful information for donor selection and indications for individual application of immunosuppressive agents and immunotherapy .
the exact effect of the ctla - 4 polymorphism and haplotype on transplant outcome should be determined in different cohorts with substantially larger number of subjects .

knee cartilage or osteochondral lesions are common and challenging injuries .
to date , most symptomatic lesions warrant surgical treatment .
we present two cases of patients with knee osteochondral defects treated with a one - step surgical procedure consisting of an autologous - based matrix composed of healthy hyaline cartilage chips , mixed plasma poor - rich in platelets clot , and plasma rich in growth factors ( prgf ) .
both patients returned to playing soccer at the preinjury activity level and demonstrated excellent defect filling in both magnetic resonance imaging and second - look arthroscopy ( in one of them ) .
the use of a clot of autologous plasma poor in platelets with healthy hyaline cartilage chips and intra - articular injection of plasma rich in platelets is an effective , easy , and cheap option to treat knee cartilage injuries in young and athletic patients .
1. introduction chondral or osteochondral lesions are common disorders of the knee and are on the rise due to the ageing of the population and the current active lifestyle .
due to their poor healing and regenerative potential , injuries involving the hyaline cartilage are challenging to treat , particularly in the young and athletic population .
cartilage defects may lead to early - onset osteoarthritic processes and a tremendous impairment in the function and quality of life in these patients .
symptomatic injuries usually require surgical treatment .
knee cartilage injuries may be treated by chondroplasty , microfractures , mosaicplasty ( osteochondral autograft transfer ) , osteochondral allograft transplantation , scaffold - based repair ( with or without cell therapy ) , autologous chondrocyte implantation ( aci ) , or matrix - induced aci ( maci ) [ 1 - 4 ] .
some pitfalls of these techniques include fibrocartilage formation without long - lasting improvement ( especially in high - level athletes ) , expensive treatments , long recovery time , or unpredictable results in the athletic population .
to understand prp - based therapies is fundamental to understanding the platelet biology .
the platelets have a major role in haemostasis , inflammation , and proliferation for remodeling and healing tissue and also have an angiogenic power to deliver molecules into the damaged tissue .
the purpose of this study was to report the outcomes of a one - step surgical procedure consisting in a clot of autologous mixed plasma poor - rich in platelets with healthy hyaline cartilage chips and intra - articular injection of plasma rich in platelets ( prp ) to treat knee osteochondral lesions ( kol ) .
2. case presentation 2.1 .
case 1 a 16 - year - old male soccer player was referred to our service complaining of left knee pain .
the pain was worse with running and both concentric and eccentric contractions .
on physical exam , he had pain to palpation in the inferior pole of the patella , no effusion , no meniscal lesions , good stability , and normal range of motion .
he was initially diagnosed of patellar apophysitis and a course of physical therapy started .
the patient did not improve and a magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) was requested at 3 months , demonstrating an osteochondritis dissecans of the lateral femoral condyle at the level of the trochlea of 20 x 18 mm diameter and 8 mm depth ( figure 1 ( a )) .
surgical treatment was recommended .
the basal functional scores of the patient were lequesne index 4 ( in a 0 to 24 scale where 0 is no functional limitation ) [ 5 ] , visual analogue scale for pain 6 ( in a 0 to 10 scale where 0 is no pain ) , womac 11 / 96 ( 11.5 %) , ikdc subjective knee evaluation form 75.9 , and tegner - lysholm 88 .
knee arthroscopy was performed five days later and a kol was confirmed ( figure 1 ( b )) .
samples of healthy - looking hyaline cartilage in the defect edges were obtained using a curette .
hyaline cartilage was cut up until several chips were obtained .
a vertical rim of cartilage wall was left in the defect edges .
a debridement of the lesion was carried out with a shaver down to the subchondral bone .
then , a 3 cm longitudinal arthrotomy was performed and the knee moved into a position that could completely expose the kol .
prgf preparation was conducted using the endoret ( c ) prgf ( c ) system ( bti biotechnology institute , alava , spain ) .
eighty ml of blood was extracted before surgery and placed in eight 9 ml tubes containing 3.8 % of a citrate solution .
a bti system iv ( c ) ( bti biotechnology institute , alava , spain ) centrifuge was used for 8 minutes at 580g obtaining the sedimentation of red and white cells at the bottom and platelets with plasma on the top part of the tubes .
after centrifugation , there were two differentiated fractions .
the first fraction , in the upper part of the supernatant , was plasma poor in platelets ( ppp ) , which was placed in bti 9 ml , sterile - fractionation tubes .
the second fraction ( just over the white cells layer ) was the plasma rich in platelets ( prp ) placed in other bti 9 ml , sterile - fractionation tubes .
extraction of the second fraction is a critical step and must be done carefully to avoid aspiration of white cells .
to prepare the clot , a 50 / 50 mixture of first fraction ( ppp ) along with second fraction ( prp ) is activated with cacl2 following the rate of 0.02 ml per milliliter of plasma , maintaining the tube at room temperature .
cartilage chips were combined with the mixed ppp - prp and left for at least 30 minutes until a semisolid matrix was formed ( figure 1 ( c )) .
time to form the matrix will depend on each patient blood .
then this matrix was placed in the kol , which has to be slightly below the healthy surrounding articular cartilage to avoid overgrowth ( figure 1 ( d )) .
great care was taken to ensure adequate and homogesneous sitting of the matrix in the defect , and after 5 minutes , gentle range of motion under direct visualization was performed to ensure adequate stability of the construct .
next , the arthrotomy and portals were closed and the second fraction was injected once intra - articularly after platelet activation with calcium chloride .
two cast splints were used to immobilize the lower extremity for two weeks .
after a week , the patient had no pain at all .
after the cast splints were removed , gentle range of motion was allowed from 0degrees to 90degrees , progressing at 15degrees per week afterwards .
non - weight - bearing was kept for 4 weeks and then partial weight - bearing was allowed from weeks 4 to 6 .
full weight - bearing started at 6 weeks after surgery .
strengthening exercises were resumed at 8 weeks .
an mri was requested at two months , which demonstrated adequate filling and incorporation of the matrix in the defect without overgrowth .
at 5 months , running and unrestricted weight training were allowed .
a follow - up mri was obtained at 6 months , which demonstrated complete filling of the defect by chondrocyte - like fibrous tissue without maturation .
at 8 months , he returned to play at the same preinjury level .
the patient was doing very well , but one year after surgery he had an anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) injury while playing with the national soccer team .
the mri demonstrated the acl tear but the kol appeared intact and , in fact , the defect was almost completely restored .
acl reconstruction was conducted using a bone - patellar tendon - bone autograft using the single - bundle anatomic technique .
this gave us the opportunity for a second - look arthroscopy of the kol .
the defect was completely filled with the new tissue , which had a similar color and consistency ( figure 2 ( a )) and was smooth compared to the surrounding healthy cartilage ( figure 2 ( b )) .
the patient is now at 6 months post - op from the acl reconstruction and is near completion of the readaptation phase to competition .
at a total of 20 months after the index procedure ( but only 6 months after the acl reconstruction ) the patient had the following scores : sf - 36 67 ( physical function 95 , physical role 25 , pain 77.5 , general health 95 , vitality 65 , social function 65 , emotional role 66.6 , mental health 64 , and health transition 50 ) , lequesne index 0 ( in a 0 to 24 scale where 0 is no functional limitation ) [ 5 ] , visual analogue scale for pain 0.5 ( in a 0 to 10 scale where 0 is no pain ) , womac 2 / 96 ( 2.1 %) , ikdc subjective knee evaluation form 90 , and tegner - lysholm 100 .
2.2 .
case 2 a 22 - year - old male soccer player came to our clinic complaining of knee pain , swelling , and inability to play soccer without pain .
physical exam revealed pain in the lateral femoral condyle , mild joint effusion , and full range of motion .
an mri demonstrated a grade iv osteochondral injury in the lateral femoral condyle .
the patient was initially treated nonoperatively and returned to playing soccer at his preinjury level .
however , at 1.5 years from the first visit the patient had a painful forced valgus maneuver , no joint effusion , a stable knee , and range of motion , but inability to play soccer pain - free .
the mri showed the same osteochondral injury and bone oedema in the lateral femoral condyle ( figure 3 ( a )) .
due to lack of improvement with 1.5 years of physical therapy and activity modification , an arthroscopy was recommended to evaluate and treat the kol .
the basal functional scores of the patient were lequesne index 3 ( in a 0 to 24 scale where 0 is no functional limitation ) [ 5 ] , visual analogue scale for pain 5 ( in a 0 to 10 scale where 0 is no pain ) , womac 8 / 96 ( 8.3 %) , ikdc subjective knee evaluation form 46 , and tegner - lysholm 60 .
knee arthroscopy demonstrated a rounded 1.7 cm diameter osteochondral injury in the lateral femoral condyle ( figure 3 ( b )) .
the surgical procedure and postoperative protocol detailed above were repeated for this patient ( figure 3 ( c )) .
as in case 1 , the patient had no pain after one week of the operation and this was maintained throughout the postoperative period .
at two months , the patient had full range of motion and a follow - up mri was requested , demonstrating good filling and incorporation of the matrix into the defect .
at three months after surgery , the patient had slight joint effusion and quadriceps atrophy .
at six months , he still had significant quadriceps tone asymmetry and a follow - up mri demonstrated an almost complete filling of the defect without still complete maturation but with no other significant associated lesions ( figure 3 ( d )) .
the patient slowly recovered quadriceps tone , and at eight months he was allowed to begin running .
one year after surgery , the mri showed adequate repair of the defect with correct thickness ( no overgrowth ) and similar signal intensity in the defect compared to surrounding healthy articular cartilage .
the patient returned to playing at the same preinjury level 10 months after the surgical procedure .
at 20 months after surgery , the patient had the following scores : sf - 36 96.4 ( physical function 100 , physical role 100 , pain 100 , general health 100 , vitality 80 , social function 100 , emotional role 100 , mental health 88 , and health transition 100 ) , lequesne index 0 ( in a 0 to 24 scale where 0 is no functional limitation ) [ 5 ] , visual analogue scale for pain 0 ( in a 0 to 10 scale where 0 is no pain ) , womac 0 / 96 ( 0 %) , ikdc subjective knee evaluation form 100 , and tegner - lysholm 100 .
3. discussion cartilage repair is very difficult to achieve due to the impossibility for the chondrocyte to migrate through the dense matrix , the absence of mesenchymal cells within the cartilage , and absence of blood vessels .
for these reasons , superficial lesions have limited - to - inexistent regeneration potential , while extensive full - thickness injuries that involve subchondral bone can theoretically initiate physiological repair and regeneration because of blood supply in the subchondral bone that triggers the regeneration .
however , regeneration is uncommon and the lesion undergoes a repair response where fibrocartilage with inferior biomechanical properties is formed within the defect .
the treatment of symptomatic kol includes chondroplasty , microfractures , mosaicplasty ( osteochondral autograft transfer ) , osteochondral allograft transplantation , scaffold - based repair ( with or without cell therapy ) , or autologous chondrocyte implantation ( aci ) [ 1 - 4 ] .
chondroplasty is a palliative procedure with suboptimal results and likely no potential to modify the progression to osteoarthritis .
therefore , despite this is a very easy , fast , and nonaggressive procedure , it should not be first option to treat athletes with full - thickness cartilage defects or osteochondral injuries .
microfracture is a very popular procedure to treat kol .
in fact , this is a simple , cheap , and usually fast - recovering operation with good results and return to sports rate [ 6 ] .
however , the procedure creates a fibrocartilage with inferior biologic and biomechanical properties , which likely explains the potential worse long - term outcomes compared to cartilage regenerative techniques [ 4 ] .
osteochondral transplantation procedures may provide good long - term outcomes and return to sports rate [ 6 , 7 ] .
however , autograft transplantation is limited to smaller defects , and allografts are limited to donor availability and both have higher costs compared to microfracture .
scaffold - based and aci procedures are good cartilage regenerative procedures but there is still lack of good quality studies with long - term follow - up , especially in the athletic population [ 4 ] .
in addition , these are very expensive procedures ( cultures also require two surgical procedures ) that may not be available for many people or medical centers .
sanchez et al. have reported successful outcomes in a patient with articular cartilage avulsion treated with plasma rich in growth factors and biodegradable pins [ 8 ] .
the use of a clot of autologous mixed ppp - prp with healthy hyaline cartilage chips and intra - articular injection of prp is a novel procedure for kol that may have several advantages over other procedures : ( 1 ) cheap procedure ( no use of graft transplantation instrumentation , scaffolds , or chondrocyte cultures ) ; ( 2 ) easy and fast procedure using a small arthrotomy ; and ( 3 ) no rejection possibility because the patients' own tissue , cells , and plasma are used ( safe procedure ) .
an important aspect is that this procedure has similar return to sports rate and time to return compared to the other procedures [ 6 ] .
interestingly , case one had a new injury with enough energy to tear the acl , but the regenerated cartilage previously repaired resisted the twisting movement and it actually had an excellent appearance and consistency , with a normal hyaline - like cartilage .
both patients did very well clinically and by imaging studies , with return to play at the preinjury activity level .
this study has some limitations .
first , this is a report of two cases with relatively limited follow - up length .
second , to avoid the invasive procedure , no biopsies have been taken from the formed tissue to obtain a histology evaluation of the defect - filling tissue .
third , no comparative group with other surgical options or rehabilitation is provided in this study .
4. conclusion the use of a one - step surgical procedure consisting of a clot of autologous mixed ppp - prp with healthy hyaline cartilage chips and intra - articular injection of prp is an easy , effective , safe ( patient 's own products ) , reproducible , and cheap alternative option to treat osteochondral injuries of the knee in young and athletic patients .
however , this is only a preliminary report involving two cases and , therefore , subsequent studies with larger sample size and even a comparative group should be conducted to confirm or refute these promising results .

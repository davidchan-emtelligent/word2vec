the protozoan parasite trypanosoma cruzi causes chagas disease , one of the major neglected infectious diseases .
it has the potential to infect any nucleated mammalian cell .
the secreted / excreted protein repertoire released by t. cruzi trypomastigotes is crucial in host - pathogen interactions .
in this study , mammalian tissue culture - derived trypomastigotes ( y strain ) were used to characterize the exoproteome of the infective bloodstream life form .
proteins released into the serum - free culture medium after 3 h of incubation were harvested and digested with trypsin .
nanolc - ms / ms analysis resulted in the identification of 540 proteins , the largest set of released proteins identified to date in trypanosoma spp. bioinformatic analysis predicted most identified proteins as secreted , predominantly by non - classical pathways , and involved in host - cell infection .
some proteins possess predicted gpi - anchor signals , these being mostly trans - sialidases , mucin associated surface proteins and surface glycoproteins .
moreover , we enriched phosphopeptides and glycopeptides from tryptic digests .
the majority of identified glycoproteins are trans - sialidases and surface glycoproteins involved in host - parasite interaction .
conversely , most identified phosphoproteins have no gene ontology classification .
the existence of various proteins related to similar functions in the exoproteome likely reflects this parasite 's enhanced mechanisms for adhesion , invasion , and internalization of different host - cell types , and escape from immune defenses .

the released molecules from infectious microorganisms may also play a crucial role in pathogen life cycle and establishment of infection , such as host - defense evasion , migration across host - tissues , cell adhesion , cell - cell communication , differentiation , proliferation , and morphogenesis ( ranganathan and garg , 2009 ; soblik et al. , 2011 ) .
besides the classical secretory pathway ( schatz and dobberstein , 1996 ) , several functional proteins are released into the extracellular medium despite lacking any predicted signal peptides , thereby proving the existence of unconventional mechanisms of protein secretion in eukaryotes ( nickel and rabouille , 2009 ) .
the term secretome was first introduced in a bioinformatic survey of proteins secreted by bacillus subtilis ( tjalsma et al. , 2000 ) .
the authors defined the secretome as the subset of the proteome , which is secreted , in addition to the components of cellular machinery used for protein secretion .
the characterization of the b. subtilis secretome using a proteomic approach showed that the genome - based prediction correctly identified ~ 50 % of the proteins ( antelmann et al. , 2001 ). by comparison , the secreted proteins encoded by the human genome represent approximately 30 % of proteins ( skach , 2007 ) .
nowadays the term secretome is used primarily to denote proteins secreted by cells into the extracellular region ( greenbaum et al. , 2001 ) .
however , these released proteins are not only secreted proteins but also proteins that arise from other export mechanisms .
moreover , only those proteins that are stable in the extracellular medium will remain in abundance .
consequently , the best term to describe the protein content found in the extracellular proximity of a given biological system is the " exoproteome " ( armengaud et al. , 2012 ) .
the protozoan trypanosoma cruzi is responsible for chagas disease , which represents a major health public burden mostly in latin america .
it is estimated that about 6 to 7 milion people are infected ( who , 2016 ) .
however , the epidemiological profile of the disease has changed in recent years due to migration , with thousands of patients in north america , europe , australia , and japan ( gascon et al. , 2010 ) .
the treatment of chagas disease is currently based on chemotherapy , and no effective vaccine is available .
the unique drugs used against chagas disease , benznidazole , and nifurtimox , have high toxicity and the efficacy of the treatment declines with time of infection ( who , 2016 ) .
although their indication was until recently limited to the acute phase , recent studies agree to treat patients in the chronic phase ( lescure et al. , 2010 ) .
in order to carry out its lifecycle , the non - replicative and most infective life form of t. cruzi , the metacyclic trypomastigote , must cross the mammalian host 's extracellular matrix , adhere to the cellular plasma membrane and can penetrate almost any nucleated vertebrate host - cell by a non - conventional endocytic mechanism involving host - cell lysosome recruitment and their fusion with the parasitophorous vacuole .
it results in an obligatory stay in an acidic vacuole where the differentiation into the replicative amastigote form ( first amastigogenesis ) is initiated , and completed in the cytoplasm after escaping the parasitophorous vacuole ( andrade and andrews , 2004 ) .
after replication , amastigotes can differentiate into tissue derived bloodstream trypomastigotes released into the bloodstream that can infect other vertebrate host - cell and the secondary amastigogenesis is observed or be ingested by the blood - sucking triatomine vectors ( vanhamme and pays , 1995 ) .
in some cases , amastigotes may be generated extracellularly , and they are also able to infect cells ( mortara et al. , 2008 ) .
recently , a quantitative high - throughput proteomic and phosphoproteomic survey of t. cruzi axenic acidic - ph induced differentiation from trypomastigotes into axenic amastigotes provided insights into the molecular mechanisms coordinating this process ( queiroz et al. , 2014 ) .
the infection involves a number of parasite secretion / excretion factors , as well the release of host - membrane binding proteins to allow infection and virulence .
some mechanisms of host - cell invasion by t. cruzi have been described at the ultrastructural level and the biochemical strategies involved in host - parasite interaction have also been investigated ( osuna et al. , 1990 ; tardieux et al. , 1994 ; di noia et al. , 1996 ; villalta et al. , 2001 ; ferreira et al. , 2006 ) .
these mechanisms involve an increase of host - cytosolic ca2 + concentration caused by the release of intracellular deposits of the ion during the parasite invasion ( osuna et al. , 1986 ; rodriguez et al. , 1996 ; pollevick et al. , 2000 ) .
after the depolymerization of actin filaments and recruitment of lysosomes toward the plasma membrane by a kinesin - dependent process , it occurs the remodeling of the host - cell cytoskeleton ( osuna et al. , 1986 ; yoshida et al. , 1989 ; tardieux et al. , 1994 ; rodriguez et al. , 1996 ; villalta et al. , 2001 ; tarleton et al. , 2007 ) .
in the past 20 years many groups have sought to identify the t. cruzi components involved in host - cell invasion .
the image emerging from these studies is that the parasite 's penetration into the mammalian cell is a multistep process involving several molecules from the parasite and host in a series of events leading to intracellular ca2 + mobilization in both organisms ( burleigh and andrews , 1998 ; yoshida and cortez , 2008 ) .
to invade mammalian cells , metacyclic trypomastigotes employ surface glycoproteins , such as gp82 , gp35 / 50 , or gp30 ( a variant from gp82 expressed in isolates deficient of gp82 ) , mucins and trans - sialidases ( ts ) ( buscaglia et al. , 2006 ; yoshida and cortez , 2008 ; de pablos et al. , 2011 ) .
these parasites can also use other components , such as secreted proteins from the sap family ( proteins rich in serine , alanine , and proline ) ( baida et al. , 2006 ) .
trypomastigotes also use a series of components to traverse the extracellular matrix and invade the host - cell , such as tc - 85 , gp83 , tc - 1 , cruzipain , oligopeptidase b ( opbtc ) , and prolyl oligopeptidase 80 kda ( pop tc80 ) ( burleigh and andrews , 1998 ; yoshida and cortez , 2008 ) .
for example , pop tc80 is able to degrade native collagen fibers in rat mesentery ( santana et al. , 1997 ) and it could be secreted despite having no secretion signal sequence ( grellier et al. , 2001 ; bastos et al. , 2013 ) .
opbtc is active as a dimer ( motta et al. , 2012 ) and assists in cell invasion by generating agonist modulators of ca2 + required for the recruitment and fusion of lysosomes to the parasite adhesion site ( tardieux et al. , 1992 ) .
in fact , the invasion of non - phagocytic cells is an active process and the cell contact generates ca2 + signaling modulating factors from the parasite and / or host - cell , however the host - cell signaling pathways activated by the protozoan have not yet been fully identified ( burleigh and andrews , 1998 ; yoshida and cortez , 2008 ; caradonna and burleigh , 2011 ) .
today , high - resolution mass spectrometry - based proteomic approaches have modified the view of exoproteomes .
for instance , recent secretome analyses regarding t. cruzi dm28c clone metacyclic trypomastigote and epimastigote ( bayer - santos et al. , 2013 ) and also other members of the kinetoplastida order ( leishmania ( leishmania ) donovani , trypanosoma congolense and t. evansi ) ( silverman et al. , 2008 ; cuervo et al. , 2009 ; geiger et al. , 2010 ) have begun to unveil the links between the high diversity of secreted molecular components and their functions .
although , metacyclic trypomastigotes and tissue derived bloodstream trypomastigotes share some morphological and biological properties , both forms display different modes of interaction with host - cells ( burleigh and andrews , 1995 ) .
since our interest is to better understand the infection of the vertebrate host - cell by t. cruzi , the present investigation is the first to perform such analysis of a t. cruzi y strain tissue derived trypomastigote ( bloodstream form ) exoproteome .
furthermore , we performed glycopeptide and phosphopeptide enrichment techniques to have a first glimpse of the post - translational modifications ( ptms ) present in secreted / excreted proteins ( bendtsen et al. , 2004 ; conesa et al. , 2005 ; poisson et al. , 2007 ; petersen et al. , 2011 ) .
materials and methods all reagents were from sigma / aldrich ( st. louis , usa ) unless stated otherwise .
trypomastigote cell culture trypomastigotes , y strain , were maintained in monolayers of hela cells grown in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) , ph 7.4 , supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum ( sorali biotecnologia , campo grande , brazil ) and 100 mug / ml gentamicin , at 37degreesc in an atmosphere with 5 % co2 ( andrews and colli , 1982 ) , with the medium changed daily within the initial 3 days after infection .
parasites emerged from the destroyed host - cells from the 4th day and were collected on the 5th day , and consisted of over 98 % trypomastigotes .
incubation and processing of the exoproteome trypomastigotes were washed 3 times by centrifugation at 2500 x g for 10 min with dmem , ph 7.4 , without serum .
then , 1.0 x 109 washed parasites were resuspended in 5 ml dmem without serum , ph 7.4 , ( 2.0 x 108 cells / ml ) as described in queiroz et al .
( 2013 ) and incubated in 25 cm2 culture flasks at 37degreesc for 3 h , with gentle shaking every 20 min .
after incubation , parasite motility was checked and the sample was collected only if the medium was not acidified and about 95 % of the cells remained mobile .
to remove cells after the incubation , the medium was centrifuged for 5 min at room temperature 3 times to ensure complete removal of cells and avoid mechanical cell lysis : firstly at 2000 x g , then at 4000 x g , and finally at 6000 x g , with the supernatants transferred to new tubes after each centrifugation .
after cell removal , proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid ( tca , 15 % v / v ) for 1 h at - 20degreesc and washed 3 times with ice - cold acetone , at 14,000 x g , 15 min , at 4degreesc .
sample preparation from one biological sample , tca - precipitated proteins were resuspended in 20 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate ( teab ) , reduced with 20 mm dithiothreitol at 56degreesc for 45 min , alkylated with 40 mm iodoacetamide at room temperature in the dark for 60 min and digested overnight at 37degreesc with 1 mug modified trypsin ( promega , madison , usa ) .
after digestion , the sample was acidified to a final concentration of 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid ( tfa ) and desalted with homemade microcolumns of poros oligo r3 resin ( perseptive biosystems , framingham , usa ) packed ( 1 cm long ) in p200 tips ( adapted from gobom et al. , 1999 ) .
prior to lyophilization , peptide concentration was determined by amino acid analysis using a biochrom 30 amino acid analyser ( biochrom , cambridge , u.k. ) following the manufacturer 's protocol .
tio2 affinity phosphopeptide enrichment phosphopeptides were enriched in batch by tio2 - affinity as described elsewhere ( jensen and larsen , 2007 ) with minor modifications .
briefly , the digested and desalted sample ( around 20 - 30 mug ) was resuspended in 1 m glycolic acid in 80 % ( v / v ) acetonitrile ( acn )/ 5 % tfa ( v / v ) followed by addition of 0.3 mg of tio2 beads ( titansphere beads , gl sciences , tokyo , japan ) before incubation under vigorous shaking for 10 - 15 min .
beads were spun down and supernatant transferred to new microtubes .
addition of tio2 beads to the supernatants ( using 0.2 mg and , later , 0.1 mg of tio2 ) was repeated another two times .
the tio2 beads from the 3 rounds of enrichment were combined and washed firstly with 80 % acn / 1 % tfa ( v / v ) and then with 10 % acn / 0.1 % tfa ( v / v ) to remove non - phosphorylated peptides bound to tio2 in a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography ( hilic ) way .
phosphopeptides were then eluted with ammonia solution ( 0.28 %) , ph 11 , and lyophilized .
zic - hilic glycopeptide enrichment the combined flow - through and wash without phosphopeptides were dried down , resuspended with 0.1 % tfa , desalted and lyophilized before submitted to glycopeptide enrichment and peptide - n - glycosidase f ( pngase f ) digestion as described in mysling et al .
( 2010 ) with minor modifications .
briefly homemade zwitterionic hilic ( sequant , umea , sweden , 10 mum ) microcolumns packed ( 1 cm long ) in p200 tips , in analogy from ( gobom et al. , 1999 ) , were manufactured prior to enrichment .
the packed microcolumn was first washed with 20 mul elution solution ( 5 % formic acid ) , then equilibrated with 40 mul load / wash solution ( 80 % acn , 1 % tfa ) .
the sample solubilized in 10 mul load / wash solution was applied into the column using a 1 ml syringe , washed with 40 mul load / wash solution and glycopeptides were eluted with 10 mul elution solution and dried .
the flow - through and wash were also collected and combined .
the n - linked glycan structures from the glycopeptides were removed using 0.2 units of pngase f in 50 mm teab .
hilic fractionation the flow through and wash from the glycopeptide enrichment step were combined and separated in seven fractions on a tskgel amide 80 ( tosoh bioscience , stuttgart , germany ) hilic hplc column ( length : 15 cm , diameter : 2 mm , particle size : 3 mum ) essentially as described elsewhere ( mcnulty and annan , 2008 ; queiroz et al. , 2014 ) .
lc - ms / ms and data analysis samples were analyzed by an easy - nano lc system ( proxeon biosystems , odense , denmark ) coupled online to an ltq - orbitrap velos mass spectrometer ( thermo scientific , waltham , usa ) .
peptides from each fraction were loaded onto a 18 cm fused silica emitter ( 75 mum inner diameter ) packed in - house with reverse phase capillary column reprosil - pur c18 - aq 3 mum resin ( dr. maisch gmbh , germany ) and eluted using a gradient from 100 % phase a ( 0.1 % formic acid ) to 35 % phase b ( 0.1 % formic acid , 95 % acetonitrile ) for 210 min for the phosphopeptide and glycopeptide enriched fractions and 77 min for each hilic fraction , 35 to 100 % phase b for 5 min and 100 % phase b for 8 min in ( a total of 223 min and 90 min at 250 nl / min ) .
after each run , the column was washed with 90 % phase b and re - equilibrated with phase a. mass spectra were acquired in positive ion mode applying data - dependent automatic survey ms scan and tandem mass spectra ( ms / ms ) acquisition .
each ms scan in the orbitrap ( mass range of m / z of 400 - 1800 and resolution 60,000 ) was followed by ms / ms of the seven most intense ions in the ltq .
fragmentation in the ltq was performed by higher energy collisional dissociation and selected sequenced ions were dynamically excluded for 30 s. raw data were viewed in xcalibur v.2.1 ( thermo scientific , waltham , usa ) .
data processing was performed using proteome discoverer v.1.3 ( thermo scientific , waltham , usa ) .
raw files were generated and these were submitted to searching using proteome discoverer with in house mascot v.2.3 algorithm against t. cruzi downloaded ( early 2012 ) using database on demand tool ( reisinger and martens , 2009 ) containing the proteins of the parasite found in uniprot / swiss - prot and uniprot / trembl .
contaminant proteins ( several types of human keratins , bsa and porcine trypsin ) were also added to the database and all contaminant proteins identified were manually removed from the result lists .
the searches were performed with the following parameters : ms accuracy 10 ppm , ms / ms accuracy 0.5 da , trypsin digestion with up to 2 missed cleavage allowed , fixed carbamidomethyl modification of cysteine and variable modification of oxidized methionine as well phosphorylation of serine , threonine and tyrosine residues or deamidation of asparagine for the phosphopeptide or glycopeptide enriched fractions , respectively .
number of proteins , protein groups and number of peptides were filtered for false discovery rate ( fdr ) less than 1 % , peptides with rank 1 and proteins with at least 2 peptides ( except for the phosphopeptide or glycopeptide enriched samples ) using proteome discoverer .
only n - glycopeptides with deamidation sites within the pngase consensus sequence ( n - x - s / t / c , x != p ) and phosphopeptides with prs probability greater than 50 % ( beausoleil et al. , 2006 ) were considered for further analysis .
proteincenter software ( thermo scientific , waltham , usa ) was used to generate fasta formatted files of groups of proteins of interest .
better annotation of the identified was acquired using blast2go software ( http :// www.blast2go.com / b2ghome ) using default parameters .
signalp v.4.0 ( http :// www.cbs.dtu.dk / services / signalp /) and secretomep v.2.0 ( http :// www.cbs.dtu.dk / services / secretomep /) softwares were used to predict proteins secreted by classical and non - classical pathways , respectively , and fraganchor ( poisson et al. , 2007 ) to assign predicted glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( gpi ) - anchored proteins .
transmembrane helices based on a hidden markov model ( tmhmm ) algorithm ( http :// www.cbs.dtu.dk / services / tmhmm /) was used to predict the number of transmembrane helixes in the protein sequences .
data availability mass spectrometer output files ( raw data ) , peptide and protein identification files ( mgf and msf files ) have been deposited in a public repository - - the peptideatlas database ( http :// www.peptideatlas.org / pass / pass00621 ) under the dataset tag tcruzi _ exoproteome _ and database identifier pass00621 .
results profiling the trypomastigote exoproteome in the experimental conditions , for 3 h , trypomastigotes exhibited normal motility and morphology .
the quantification of protein released by 1.0 x 109 parasites was estimated at around 60 mug .
taken together , the seven hilic fractions yielded 540 protein groups identified in the trypomastigote exoproteome ( supplemental table s1 ) .
the prediction algorithms for secretion through classical ( signalp ) and non - classical ( secretomep ) pathways demonstrate that almost 80 % of all identified proteins are indeed expected to be secreted , although most of them by non - classical pathways ( figure 1 and supplemental table s2 ) .
only 15.3 % of all identified proteins were predicted to have the signal peptide , demonstrating that just a small proportion of secreted proteins follow the classical endoplasmic reticulum / golgi - dependent pathway .
figure 1 relative abundance of proteins identified in the trypomastigote exoproteome predicted to be secreted through classical ( signalp algorithm ) and non - classical ( secretomep algorithm ) pathways .
ninety seven proteins had a predicted glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( gpi ) - anchor signal ( supplemental table s2 ) , being mostly tss , mucin associated surface proteins ( masps ) and surface glycoproteins .
the tmhmm server predicted 87 proteins to have transmembrane helices , with numbers of helices ranging from 1 to 5 .
most of these were members of the ts family or mucins ( supplemental table s2 ) .
the remaining are mostly proteins known to be involved in infection , such as gp63 acid protease ( mainly gpi - anchored or secreted isoforms of this protein family ) ( d'avila - levy et al. , 2014 ) and cruzipain , which is secreted through the flagellar pocket ( murta et al. , 1990 ) .
others are known to be immunogenic proteins and glycoproteins .
for example surface protein - 2 is a trypomastigote - specific protein localized on the flagellum near the cell body of the trypomastigote form , as well as the putative surface protein tolt , tolt3 ( quanquin et al. , 1999 ). and also were identified proteins with lectin domains , localized in the flagellar pocket membrane and the golgi complex of the parasite , such as antigenic lectin - 2 ( macedo et al. , 2006 ) .
go classification of the trypomastigote exoproteome from all identified proteins , 536 sequences were retrieved by blast2go software ( supplementary table s2 ) , with 48 not allocated in any go category , most of which are hypothetical or putative proteins .
generic go slim was used to summarize the sub - categories of the identified protein groups .
the most frequent cellular function terms identified by go slim were hydrolase activity ( go : 0016787 ) , mainly due to the large number of ts superfamily members presented in the exoproteome , " nucleotide binding " ( go : 0000166 ) and " catalytic activity " ( go : 0003824 ) ( figure 2 ) .

( a ) molecular function and ( b ) biological process .
" symbiosis , encompassing mutualism through parasitism " ( go : 0044403 ) was the most common go slim biological process term , which reflects the exoproteome 's trend toward infection and host - pathogen interaction related processes .
this subset of proteins , summarized in table 1 , has 229 and 4 members with predicted " hydrolase " ( go : 0016787 ) and " transferase activities " ( go : 0016740 ) respectively , and includes 185 members of the ts superfamily .
also along with the proteins predicted to be involved in this process , there are mucin - type glycoproteins , known to be implicated in parasite protection , attachment and the evasion of immune system ( campo et al. , 2004 ) .
other proteins found were members of fl - 160 surface antigen gene family and complement regulatory proteins that inhibit the formation of the alternative and classical c3 convertase , thus preventing activation and amplification of the host - complement cascade , contributing to make trypomastigotes highly resistant to the lytic effects of vertebrate complement ( norris et al. , 1997 ) .
among the tc13 antigen family members we identified in the trypomastigote exoproteome is the surface antigen phgst # 5 ( gi | 22209012 |) which is supposed to act as a ligand , interacting with a neurotransmitter receptor , the beta ( 1 ) - adrenergic receptor ( garcia et al. , 2003 ) .

this domain belongs to the concanavalin a - like lectin / glucanases superfamily and they are usually ca2 + - mediated receptors that can have binding sites for steroids , beta 1 integrins , heparin , sulfatides , fibulin - 1 , and alpha - dystroglycans .
proteins that contain laminin g domains serve a variety of purposes including signal transduction via cell - surface steroid receptors , adhesion , migration , and differentiation through mediation of cell adhesion molecules ( marchler - bauer et al. , 2009 ) .
ptms in secreted / excreted proteins the glycopeptide enriched fraction yielded 27 n - glycopeptides encompassing 24 different glycoproteins and the phosphopeptide enrichment yielded 48 phosphopeptides from 40 different phosphoproteins ( supplemental table s3 ) .
as a preliminary qualitative study with relatively small starting sample amount , the objective was to detect the existence of phosphorylation events on secreted / excreted proteins and , thereafter , propose which protein groups are likely to be regulated .
we could observe that the majority of the identified phosphoproteins are not annotated .
the majority of the glycoproteins we identified in the exoproteome are ts superfamily members or surface glycoproteins and , thus , the major go slim function and process categories are " hydrolase activity and symbiosis , encompassing mutualism through parasitism " ( figure 3 ) .

( a ) molecular function , ( b ) biological process .
discussion products secreted by cells play fundamental biological roles and represent the primary interface between parasite and host - cell .
the identification of proteins involved in host - parasite interactions is important not only to understand the biological aspects of these interactions , but also to find molecules capable of blocking parasite invasion and proliferation in the host .
bioinformatic approaches are fast and permit the prediction of secreted proteins by the presence of an n - terminal signal peptide sequence .
however , there is evidence that many secreted proteins lack this signal peptide .
moreover , t. cruzi has polycistronic transcription , following by a trans - splicing step , and the regulation of gene expression for protein - coding genes depends entirely on post - transcriptional processes ( michaeli , 2011 ) .
therefore , transcriptomics is limited in its ability to determine protein expression levels and post - transcriptional modifications .
the lifecycle of t. cruzi is complex , with several life forms and requires the expression of specialized proteins for the parasite 's development and in order to circumvent the host immune response .
for successful infection , t. cruzi needs to adapt to its new environment and choose the correct molecular tools to counteract host - defenses .
for example , in mammalian hosts , bloodstream trypomastigotes try to escape the host immune system by expressing glycoproteins on their surface , while in the triatomines , they face the invertebrate host 's immune system , intestinal proteases and antimicrobial compounds ( garcia et al. , 2010 ) .
previous investigations of the t. brucei gambiense secretome identified 444 secreted proteins , the largest set of secreted proteins presently characterized in trypanosoma ( geiger et al. , 2010 ). and 367 proteins were reported to be released by both metacyclic trypomastigote and epimastigote t. cruzi life forms ( bayer - santos et al. , 2013 ) .
in this study , we found a large number of proteins released into the medium by the tissue culture cell - derived trypomastigote form ( 540 proteins ) , using stringent mass spectrometry criteria to accept protein identification ( fdr < 1 % , only rank 1 peptide and at least 2 peptides per protein ) .
it is noteworthy that in our study the incubation time in the serum - free culture medium was 3 h , as used for the leishmania ( viannia ) braziliensis secretome by cuervo and collaborators ( cuervo et al. , 2009 ) to limit the parasite exposure to environmental stress upon incubation conditions .
this reinforces the effectiveness of this approach , which obtained a higher number of proteins in a considerably short incubation .
the signalp and secretomep algorithms were used to predict whether the identified proteins were secreted by a classical pathway ( with signal peptide ) or a non - classical pathway .
these analyses revealed that about 65 % of the proteins were not secreted by the classical pathway , a small portion ( 15 %) by the classical pathway , and the remaining with no predicted pathway , in agreement with other kinetoplastids organisms ( cuervo et al. , 2009 ; grebaut et al. , 2009 ; geiger et al. , 2010 ) .
the secreted protein profile of leishmania ( viannia ) braziliensis promastigotes revealed that over 60 % of identified proteins were predicted to be secreted , with the vast majority ( about 57 %) predicted as going through non - classical pathways ( cuervo et al. , 2009 ) .
in the t. cruzi metacyclic trypomastigote and epimastigote secretomes , the secretion was predicted to be mostly via non - classical pathways ( bayer - santos et al. , 2013 ) .
recently , a detailed proteome description of the bloodstream forms detected some proteins predicted to be secreted by non - classical secretion pathway ( brunoro et al. , 2015 ) .
all together , these data indicate that protein export in lower eukaryotes was primarily by unconventional pathways , which suggests that these pathways play an important role in the release of extracellular proteins by t. cruzi .
to better understand the possible role of the released proteins , we used proteincenter and blast2go softwares to assign go molecular function , biological process , and cellular compartment terms .
only 8 and 10 % of the identified proteins could not be assigned to any molecular function and biological process , respectively .
these proteins are good candidates for further characterization .
among the identified proteins , several have been experimentally observed as released , for example the already cited ts , mucins and masp .
glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( gpi ) - anchored proteins extensively coat the plasma membrane of t. cruzi and are involved in many aspects of host - parasite interactions , such as adhesion and invasion of host - cells , and pathogenesis ( nakayasu et al. , 2009 ) .
although they are attached to the plasma membrane by gpi anchors , enzymes such as phosphatidylinositol phospholipase c might release them from the anchors , as already reported for members of ts family ( buscaglia et al. , 2006 ) .
components of this secreted / excreted repertoire , which represent the most immunodominant antigens in t. cruzi , have also been employed in the development of diagnostic tests for chagas disease ( matsumoto et al. , 2002 ; berrizbeitia et al. , 2006 ) .
ts and mucin protein families are essential to the invasion process .
they are anchored to the parasite membrane and can be shed into the bloodstream .
ts bind host - cell receptors and can transfer sialic - acid residues from host glycoconjugates to the major surface glycoproteins of t. cruzi , mucin - like - proteins ( buscaglia et al. , 2006 ) .
also , some of masps have been found in the membrane of the trypomastigotes and / or secreted into the culture medium ( de pablos et al. , 2011 ) .
likewise , the calreticulin predicted as secreted through the classical pathway , has been previously reported as a calcium binding protein that controls calcium levels in er and has an important function in the parasite infectivity inactivating the complement component c1 ( ramirez et al. , 2011 , 2012 ) .
another protein secreted by a non - classical pathway , is superoxide dismutase .
this enzyme has been suggested to be involved in parasite defense mechanisms and the establishment of trypanosome - host interaction ( kabiri and steverding , 2001 ; villagran et al. , 2005 ) .
furthermore , t. cruzi parasites excrete molecules through small vesicles at the flagellar pocket ( e.g. , exosomes ) and larger vesicles ( ectosomes ) ( bayer - santos et al. , 2013 ) .
exosomes possess a characterized mainstream protein composition ( mathivanan et al. , 2010 ) , 15 members of which we identified in the exoproteome : ( i ) the cytoskeletal proteins actin , cofilin 1 and tubilins ; ( ii ) the enzymes enolase 1 , pgk1 , cnp , mdh 1 , cyclophilin a , and peroxiredosins ; ( iii ) the signal transduction proteins mucin 1 and 14 - 3 - 3 protein ; ( iv ) the atpase atp5b ; ( v ) ribosomal proteins and ( vi ) ubiquitin .
the release of such vesicles is a mode of unconventional protein secretion that has received growing attention lately .
this kind of protein secretion has been correlated to autophagy pathways that do not necessarily lead to complete degradation of macromolecules ( manjithaya and subramani , 2011 ) .
furthermore , protein released through vesicles offers advantages such as protection against extracellular agents like proteases and antibodies , avoiding modifications that would be acquired when secreted through classical pathway and block normal protein function ( wegehingel et al. , 2008 ). and also it has been demonstrated that these vesicles serve in cell - cell communication ( mathivanan et al. , 2010 ; manjithaya and subramani , 2011 ) , including in protozoan parasites ( regev - rudzki et al. , 2013 ) , and remain active during starvation , when the conventional secretion is blocked ( shorer et al. , 2005 ; geng et al. , 2010 ) .
for t. cruzi , extracellular vesicles promoted metacyclogenesis and also infection susceptibility of mammalian cells ( garcia - silva et al. , 2014 ) .
in addition , this study presents the first experimental evidence of ptms , such as n - glycosylation , and phosphorylation for the trypomastigote exoproteome .
ptms regulate the functional activity of proteins involved in different biological processes .
protein phosphorylation is well - recognized as a key ptm and recently , was demonstrated that phosphorylation / dephosphorylation events coordinate transformation of cell culture - derived trypomastigotes to axenic amastigotes in vitro ( queiroz et al. , 2014 ) .
the biological relevance of the phosphorylation of released proteins remains to be explored .
in 1991 , hall and joiner wrote : " investigation of the molecular basis for the complex interplay between intracellular parasites and host - cells is currently underway in a number of laboratories and promises to provide exciting new insights for parasitologists , immunologists , and cell biologists " ( hall and joiner , 1991 ) .
more than 30 years later , we could conclude that different intracellular parasites , exemplified here by t. cruzi , use several secretion strategies and the understanding of the recent exoproteome data on pathogenic microorganisms is a challenge , limited by experimental conditions and methods and the diversity of identified proteins .
in addition , a set of identified secreted proteins with unknown functions may play important roles in t. cruzi invasion and , thus , there is a need for future functional characterization studies .
exoproteome analysis is still a promising area of research providing insight into t. cruzi infection ; secreted proteins serve as a rich source of biomarkers and the development of new therapeutic strategies .

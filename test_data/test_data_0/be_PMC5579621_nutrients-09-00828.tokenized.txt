the psoralea corylifolia l. seed ( pcs ) is a widely used herbal medicine , but its possible effect against diabetic nephropathy has not been studied .
to investigate the anti - nephropathic effect of pcs extracts , we performed experiments using a diabetic mouse model and high glucose - treated mesangial cells .
streptozotocin ( stz ) - induced diabetic mice were orally administered pcs extract for 8 weeks ( 500 mg / kg / day ) .
increased creatinine clearance , urine volume , urine microalbumin , and mesangial expansion were observed in stz - induced diabetic mice ; these were significantly reduced by pcs extract administration .
pcs extract significantly reduced fibrosis in the kidney tissue of diabetic mice as evidenced by decreased mrna expression of collagen type iv - alpha2 , fibronectin , pai - 1 , and tgf - beta1 .
in addition , cleaved parp , an apoptotic gene , was upregulated in the diabetic nephropathy mice , and this was ameliorated after pcs extract treatment .
treatment of high glucose - treated mes - 13 cells with isopsoralen and psoralen , major components of pcs extract , also decreased the expression of fibrosis and apoptosis marker genes and increased cell viability .
pcs extract exerts protective effects against stz - induced diabetic nephropathy via anti - fibrotic and anti - apoptotic effects .
pcs extract might be a potential pharmacological agent to protect against high glucose - induced renal damage under diabetic conditions .
diabetic nephropathy psoralea corylifolia l. seed renal fibrosis renal apoptosis 1 .
introduction diabetic nephropathy is a common microvascular complication in diabetic patients , which leads to high morbidity and mortality throughout the world [ 1,2 ] .
diabetic nephropathy is characterized by structural as well as functional abnormalities .
urinary albumin excretion along with extracellular matrix accumulation , basement membrane thickening , mesangial hypertrophy , and glomerular epithelial cell ( podocyte ) loss within the glomeruli are characteristic pathological features of diabetic nephropathy [ 3,4 ] .
especially , changes in glomeruli such as fibrosis and apoptosis of mesangial cells play important roles in the progression of diabetic nephropathy .
the hyperglycemic condition induces expression of genes associated with fibrosis , such as transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta ) , fibronectin , collagen type iv , alpha2 ( col4a2 ) , and plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 ( pai - 1 ) [ 5,6 ] .
moreover , activation of apoptotic programs such as nuclear condensation , caspase activation , and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria are observed in high glucose - treated mesangial cells [ 7,8 ] .
intensive blood glucose control and anti - hypertensive agents such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor - 1 antagonists are currently the most effective treatments for progressive diabetic nephropathy [ 9 ] .
however , there are several limitations to these drugs , such as patient resistance and heart or kidney failure [ 10,11 ] .
therefore , the development of new drugs or adjuvants that act on various components of diabetic nephropathy is urgently required .
psoralea corylifolia l. seed ( pcs ) , commonly known as " boh - gol - zhee " in korea , has been used in herbal and traditional medicine for various diseases including diabetes , cancer , inflammatory disease , neurodegenerative disease , and kidney disease [ 12 ] .
six compounds , bakuchiol , psoralen , isopsoralen , corylifolin , corylin , and psoralidin , are the major components of pcs extract [ 13 ] .
among these , bakuchiol , which is a meroterpene , and psoralen and isopsoralen , which are coumarins , have been widely studied , and their health benefits regarding anti - oxidant , anti - tumor , and estrogenic activity have been identified [ 14,15,16,17 ] .
previously , we found that pcs extract shows protective effects on oxidative stress - induced pancreatic beta cell apoptosis [ 18 ] and hepatic damage [ 19 ] .
furthermore , pcs extract shows promise as an anti - obesity agent in a high fat diet - induced obesity model [ 20 ] , suggesting that pcs extracts might also have ameliorative effects on diabetic nephropathy .
therefore , we investigated whether pcs extracts have beneficial effects on diabetic nephropathy in a streptozotocin ( stz ) - induced type 1 diabetic mouse model and investigated the mechanisms involved in high glucose - treated glomerular cells .

3. results 3.1 .
pcs extract treatment improved renal function in stz - induced diabetic mice body weight was significantly reduced in stz - induced diabetic mice compared with control mice and pcs extract treatment did not recover the reduced body weight ( figure 1a ) .
water intake , food intake and urine volume were increased in stz - induced diabetic mice compared with control mice .
after pcs extract administration , water and food intake were significantly reduced ( figure 1b,c ) .
furthermore , the increased urine volume in stz - induced diabetic mice was significantly reduced in pcs extract - treated mice ( figure 1d ) .
treatment with losartan potassium , which was used as positive control , significantly reduced water intake , food intake , and urine volume compared with vehicle - treated diabetic mice ( figure 1 ) .
to investigate whether renal function was improved by pcs extract administration , biochemical parameters in serum / urine and pathological changes were analyzed .
kidney weight and urine ph were significantly increased in stz - induced diabetic mice compared to control mice , but pcs extract treatment in stz - diabetic mice did not change these parameters ( figure 2a,b ) , but the increased creatinine clearance , urine protein , and urine microalbumin seen in stz - induced diabetic mice were significantly reduced by pcs extract treatment ( figure 2c - f ) .
renal histological analysis showed that the increase of the mesangial matrix index in stz - injected mice was significantly ameliorated by pcs extract treatment , and the effect was similar to losartan treatment ( figure 2g,h ) .
3.2 .
pcs extract inhibited the expression of genes related to renal fibrosis and apoptosis in stz - induced diabetic mice as we found that pcs extract treatment reduced mesangial expansion in diabetic mice , we next measured the expression levels of fibrosis - related genes in the kidney tissue by q - rt - pcr analysis .
mrna expression levels of fibrosis - related genes such as col4a2 , fibronectin , pai - 1 , and tgf - beta1 were significantly increased in stz - induced diabetic mice , and these increases were inhibited by pcs extract treatment ( figure 3a - d ) .
as apoptotic cell death is correlated with diabetic nephropathy [ 21 ] , we examined expression level of an apoptotic marker in the kidney tissue of diabetic mice with or without pcs extract treatment .
as shown in figure 3e , cleaved parp expression was increased in vehicle - treated diabetic mice compared with nondiabetic mice , and pcs extract administration significantly reduced stz - induced parp expression ( figure 3e ) .
losartan treatment also reduced the expression level of fibrosis related genes and cleaved parp in diabetic mice ( figure 3a - e ) .
3.3 .
pcs extract or its components protected cells from high glucose - induced apoptosis in mesangial cells to investigate the mechanisms and specific components of pcs extract responsible for the protective effect in the kidney of diabetic mice , in vitro studies were performed using mouse mesangial mes - 13 cells .
bakuchiol , psoralen , and isopsoralen are known to be major components of pcs [ 13 ] , and these are detected in the serum of the pcs extract - treated mice [ 18 ] .
therefore , we investigated whether these compounds protect mes - 13 cells from high glucose - induced apoptosis using previously determined dose ranges that do not cause cell toxicity ( figure 4 and figure s2 ) .
high glucose treatment significantly reduced cell viability compared with the control , and cell viability was not changed by mannitol treatment ( figure 4a ) , indicating that the effect is not due to osmotic pressure .
ten or 50 mug / ml of pcs extract recovered cell viability ( figure 4b ) .
low concentrations ( 0.5 - 2 mug / ml ) of isopsoralen significantly enhanced cell viability in the presence of high glucose , whereas psoralen was only effective at a higher dose ( 4 mug / ml ) ( figure 4c,d ) .
bakuchiol treatment ( 100 or 200 ng / ml ) also significantly inhibited high glucose - induced cell death , but the effect was not observed at a higher concentration ( 500 ng / ml ) ( figure 4e ) , and cell death was observed at concentrations above 500 ng / ml ( figure 4e and figure s2 ) .
we also investigated the expression level of pro - apoptosis proteins after high glucose treatment with or without various compounds .
as shown in figure 4f , high glucose treatment increased the expression levels of cleaved parp and bad , and 50 mug / ml pcs extract , 4 mug / ml psoralen , 4 mug / ml isopsoralen , or 200 ng / ml bakuchiol reduced the expression of these proteins .
the expression levels of phospho - bad ( ser112 ) and bcl - 2 , pro - survival markers , were decreased by high glucose and increased by pcs extract or its components ( figure 4f ) .
3.4 .
pcs extract or its components reduced expression of fibrosis - related genes in mesangial cells to investigate whether pcs extract also reduced fibrosis in mes - 13 cells , we measured the expression level of fibrosis markers such as tgf - beta1 , fibronectin , and pai - 1 by qrt - pcr analysis .
treatment with mannitol did not change the expression of fibrosis - related genes compared with untreated cells ( figure 5a ) .
exposure to high glucose alone induced a significant increase in fibronectin , pai - 1 , and tgf - beta1 , and pcs extract significantly reduced the mrna expression of fibronectin and tgf - beta1 , but increased the mrna expression of pai - 1 .
treatment with isopsoralen ( 4 mug / ml ) inhibited high glucose - induced fibronectin and pai - 1 mrna levels , and psoralen treatment ( 4 mug / ml ) inhibited only pai - 1 mrna .
bakuchiol ( 200 ng / ml ) did not affect the expression of fibrosis - related genes ( figure 5b - d ) .
4. discussion diabetic nephropathy is the most serious complication in diabetes mellitus and causes glomerular fibrosis and impairment of renal function .
currently available drugs , which control blood glucose or blood pressure , have a number of limitations , such as patient resistance and high rates of secondary failure [ 10 ] .
these lead to the search for alternative therapies from natural products that have low or no side effects and multi - target actions .
pcs extract has generated much interest due to its various biological activities , including anti - inflammation , anti - apoptosis , and anti - hyperglycemic effects [ 20,22,23 ] , suggesting further study on its effect on diabetic complications such as nephropathy .
therefore , we investigated anti - diabetic nephropathy effects of pcs extract in stz - induced diabetic mice , which develop renal injury with similarities to human diabetic nephropathy [ 24 ] .
the increase in urinary albumin excretion , one of the marked renal pathological features in diabetic nephropathy , is caused by mesangial expansion due to accumulation of extracellular matrix components [ 25 ] .
our stz - induced diabetic mice showed an increase in urinary albumin concentration and a corresponding increase in the mesangial matrix index relative to non - diabetic control mice .
in addition , the level of creatinine clearance , the most widely used clinical marker of kidney function [ 26 ] , was higher in diabetic mice than control mice , indicating the presence of diabetic nephropathy with renal hyperfiltration in our stz - induced diabetic mice .
eight - weeks of pcs extract treatment attenuated the increased albuminuria , creatinine clearance , and mesangial expansion in the glomeruli of stz - induced diabetic mice .
these results demonstrated that pcs extract has potent effects by counteracting mesangial expansion and hyperfiltration in diabetic mice , possibly leading to the amelioration or delay in the development of advanced diabetic renal injury .
we observed that hyperfiltration induced by stz injection led to a decrease in serum urea nitrogen levels , but administration of pcs extract did not recover this to normal levels .
these results show lack of correlation with creatinine clearance and serum urea nitrogen , and this is consistent with another study in stz - induced diabetic rats fed a high fat diet [ 27 ] .
previously , we reported that pcs extract treatment showed anti - hyperglycemic effects via reduced lipid accumulation and reduced inflammation in the liver of mice fed a high fat diet [ 20 ] .
in the present study , treatment of diabetic mice with pcs extract ameliorated creatinine clearance and mesangial matrix accumulation , but had no impact on glucose homeostasis ( figure s1 ) .
these conflicting results might be the result of the different mechanisms used to induce different diabetic mouse models [ 28 ] : such as type 1 diabetes ( present study ) versus type 2 diabetes ( previous study ) .
moreover , effect of pcs extract regarding improvement of renal injury was similar to the losartan - treated group , suggesting that pcs extract might directly improve kidney function by glucose - independent mechanisms .
several studies have demonstrated that increased tgf - beta expression in mesangial cells promotes extracellular matrix accumulation and hypertrophy during progression of diabetic nephropathy [ 29,30 ] .
moreover , as increased tgf - beta is known to be a potent inducer of col4a2 , fibronectin , and pai - 1 expression [ 31 ] , we investigated whether pcs extract reduced the expression of these molecules .
treatment with pcs extract inhibited the expression level of fibrosis markers both in the kidney tissue of diabetic mice and in high glucose - treated mes - 13 mesangial cells , and also increased cell viability .
these results show that the anti - fibrotic effects of pcs extract provided effective protection from high glucose - mediated kidney damage .
apoptosis plays a pathological role leading to the death of mesangial cells , which is associated with progressive glomerulosclerosis [ 32,33 ] .
khera et al. reported that high glucose - mediated tgf - beta activation decreases nuclear factor - kb activation and in turn , alters the expression ratio of bcl - 2 : bcl - 2 - associated x protein favoring caspase - 3 activation and increased apoptosis [ 8 ] .
we also found that expression level of apoptotic makers was increased under diabetic nephropathy conditions , and pcs extract treatment attenuated cleaved parp and increased bcl - 2 expression and phosphorylation of bad ( ser - 112 ) .
although we did not evaluate the correlation between fibrosis and apoptosis pathways in glucose - treated mesangial cells , these results suggest that inhibition of apoptosis under conditions of high glucose toxicity is an important mechanism of pcs extract in reducing glomerulosclerosis in diabetic nephropathy .
we found that treatment with major compounds of pcs extract ( bakuchiol , psoralen , and isopsoralen ) inhibited mesangial cell death , but the anti - apoptotic and anti - fibrotic responses varied .
two coumarins , psoralen and isopsoralen , increased cell viability and decreased apoptotic protein expression , and bakuchiol showed anti - apoptotic effects at much lower concentration compared with psoralen or isopsoralen .
similarly , previous studies found that psoralen or isopsoralen inhibits apoptotic cell death in h2o2 - treated ins - 1 cells [ 18 ] or palmitate - treated pc12 cells [ 34 ] .
psoralen or isopsoralen decreased mrna expression level of fibronectin and pai - 1 , suggesting that the effects of pcs extract in diabetic nephropathy was mediated primarily by these compounds .
however , total pcs extract treatment significantly increased the expression of pai - 1 .
pcs extract contains other chemical compounds such as coryfolin , corylin , and 3 - hydroxybakuchiol [ 13 ] , which might have resulted in the increase of pai - 1 expression in apoptotic mesangial cells seen after pcs treatment .
it is known that the treatment of high glucose in mesangial cells increases the level of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) [ 35,36 ] .
previously , we reported that pcs extract has an anti - oxidative effect in hepatocytes [ 19 ] and pancreatic beta cells [ 18 ] , and this effect is mediated by improvement of mitochondrial function .
as oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy [ 37 ] , possible involvement of the anti - oxidative effect of pcs extract in the inhibition of diabetic nephropathy will be investigated .
5. conclusions pcs extract has beneficial effects against diabetic nephropathy via amelioration of high glucose - induced mesangial cell injury .
pcs extract treatment decreased glucotoxic effects via anti - apoptotic and anti - fibrotic functions .
in addition , isopsoralen and psoralen , components of pcs extract , were effective against high glucose - induced mesangial cell injury .
these results provide evidence that pcs extract and its active compounds ( isopsoralen and psoralen ) may be potential therapeutic agents for reducing glucose - induced mesangial cell death during diabetic nephropathy .

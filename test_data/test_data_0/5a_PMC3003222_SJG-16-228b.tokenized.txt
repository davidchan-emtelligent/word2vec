sir , we read with great interest the review of malik et al. [ 1 ] regarding the current understanding of meckel 's diverticulum .
the article gives an excellent overview of the field and the direction of current research .
because the scientific field is undergoing rapid development , making possible the use of tools and techniques that are new and entirely different , we would like to point out two additional techniques for diagnosing md , namely , video capsule endoscopy ( vce ) and double balloon enteroscopy ( dbe ) .
both of these are novel methods of enteroscopy with a high diagnostic value .
vce is a new method used for the diagnosis of diseases of the small intestine , with satisfying results .
when all invasive / noninvasive attempts fail to detect an intestinal pathology , vce could help to achieve a diagnosis .
it has been introduced to fill the gap between examinations of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract , mainly to examine the small bowel for sources of obscure bleeding in addition to various other indications , including md. [ 2 ] the procedure is thought to be harmless , minimally invasive , highly sensitive and specific for digestive tract disorders .
it requires no sedation or radiation , and can even be performed in outpatients .
although safety and tolerability is well known in adults , recent studies show successful results in pediatric patients. [ 3 ] the first report of detection of a md using a vce was reported by mylonaki et al. [ 4 ] since that publication , a large number of reports are available in the literature documenting a high success rate for diagnosis of md using vce .
dbe is an exciting new endoscopic technique that was developed to visualize the entire small intestine and has become available for clinical practice .
it was first described by yamamato and colleagues in 2001. [ 5 ] the system consists of an enteroscope , an overtube , and a balloon pump controller .
the enteroscope has a working length of 200 cm , an outer diameter of 8.5 mm with a 140 cm overtube .
dbe has two balloons , one connected to the tip of the endoscope and another at the distal end of the overtube that facilitates the progression of the endoscope through the small bowel .
loops can be easily reduced by gentle withdrawal of the endoscope while the balloons are inflated. with this technique , the endoscope can be advanced by pushing it through the overtube , allowing endoscopic visualization of the entire small bowel , as well as biopsies and therapeutic intervention. [ 6 ] despite the technical challenges of the procedure and the resources required , it is clearly the preferred technique for treating bleeding lesions in the intestine and obtaining tissue for definitive diagnosis .
compared with vce , it has numerous advantages .
it is much more easily adjusted since the movement of the scope can be handled according to the viewing angle .
it can afford high - quality pictures and allow biopsy if needed. [ 7 ] obscure bleeding due to md can be successfully diagnosed with this technique , which has also been reported in several papers. [ 8 ] in conclusion , both these techniques allowed physicians to evaluate intestinal areas that were until recently difficult with conventional methods .
although these two tests may be capable of complementing each other , what could be the thought that they are in direct competition .
the significance of these methods could further be improved by expanding the availability of adapted accessories .

renal fibrosis is the final common pathway of chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) , and no effective medication is available clinically for managing its progression .
metformin was initially developed as an anti - diabetic drug and recently gained attention for its potential in the treatment of other diseases .
in this study , we investigated its effects on renal fibrosis in a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction ( uuo ) in vivo and in angiotensin ii ( ang ii ) - treated renal fibroblast nrk - 49f cells in vitro .
our data showed that uuo induced renal fibrosis and combined with the activation of erk signaling , the upregulation of fibronectin , collagen i , and transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta ) .
the administration of metformin inhibited the activation of erk signaling and attenuated the production of extracellular matrix ( ecm ) proteins and collagen deposition in the obstructed kidneys .
in cultured renal fibroblasts , ang ii increased the expression of fibronectin and collagen i and also activated erk signaling and tgf - beta in a time - dependent manner .
pretreatment of the cells with metformin blocked ang ii - induced erk signaling activation and ecm overproduction .
our results show that metformin prevents renal fibrosis , possibly through the inhibition of erk signaling , and may be a novel strategy for the treatment of renal fibrosis .
metformin renal fibrosis erk angiotensin ii transforming growth factor - beta 1 .
introduction renal fibrosis is a common feature of all forms of chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) , regardless of the initial cause of the disease [ 1,2,3 ] .
it is characterized by an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix ( ecm ) proteins in the kidney [ 4 ] .
accelerated ecm production alters the kidney architecture and leads to subsequent renal dysfunction , ultimately resulting in renal failure .
eventually , patients require lifelong dialysis or kidney transplantation to sustain life .
there is no effective treatment for renal fibrosis , and its occurrence worldwide is gradually increasing .
thus , substantive therapeutic interventions are urgently needed to reverse renal fibrosis .
renal fibrosis can be initiated by many pathological factors , including toxicity , ischemia , pathogenic microorganism infections , an inherited defect , or endocrine and immunological diseases [ 5 ] .
when injured , interstitial fibroblasts transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts , which contribute to the accumulation of ecm proteins , such as fibronectin and collagen i [ 6,7 ] .
many studies have shown that overactivation of the intrarenal renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) is involved in renal fibrosis in various ckd conditions , while transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta ) is a key downstream mediator of the ras [ 8,9 ] .
angiotensin ii ( ang ii ) is the main effector of the ras .
ang ii stimulates the activation and transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into scar - forming myofibroblasts [ 10,11 ] .
metformin ( figure 1 ) is a biguanide compound used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , and it is one of the world 's most widely prescribed drugs [ 12 ] .
due to its superior safety and relatively low risk of side effects , metformin has also been tested for its effectiveness in the treatment of other diseases .
recent reports have demonstrated its role in the treatment of cancer and cardiovascular diseases [ 13,14,15 ] .
there is also evidence suggesting that metformin reduces fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [ 16,17 ] .
moreover , cavaglieri et al. have demonstrated that the anti - fibrotic effect of metformin in renal fibrosis in vivo [ 18 ] .
figure 1 chemical structure of metformin .
in this study , we investigated the effects of metformin on renal fibrosis both in vivo and in vitro .
unilateral ureteral obstruction ( uuo ) is a well - characterized animal model of renal fibrosis [ 19,20 ] .
our data showed that metformin was effective in reducing renal fibrosis in uuo mice .
moreover , metformin inhibited the ecm production induced by ang ii in renal fibroblast nrk - 49f cells .
thus , our data provide a rationale for the treatment of renal fibrosis using metformin .
2. results 2.1 .
metformin administration attenuated fibrosis in obstructed kidneys in uuo mice , dramatic increases in the levels of ecm proteins , including fibronectin and collagen i , were observed three days after surgery and these increased further at seven days ( figure 2a,b ) .
metformin was administered by gavage in one group of uuo mice to determine whether it could inhibit the progression of renal fibrosis in vivo .
the western blot results showed that the metformin inhibited uuo - induced upregulation of fibronectin and collagen i protein expression in the obstructed kidney ( figure 2c,d ) .
masson 's trichrome staining showed that collagen deposition increased significantly in the interstitial area , suggesting that the uuo induced renal interstitial fibrosis ( figure 3 ) .
metformin treatment significantly attenuated uuo - induced collagen deposition ( figure 3 ) .
taken together , these data suggest that metformin attenuated renal fibrosis in the uuo model .

3. discussion renal fibrosis underlies all forms of end - stage kidney disease , regardless of the primary insult .
it is characterized by the excessive accumulation of ecm components after renal injury , which eventually leads to renal failure [ 4 ] .
currently , treatment of renal fibrosis is severely limited and often ineffective [ 3,21 ] .
kidney transplantation is the only effective option for end - stage renal fibrosis .
however , limited organ availability and the high morbidity of transplantation highlight the urgent need for novel strategies to prevent renal fibrosis .
metformin is the most frequently prescribed antidiabetic drug worldwide .
for over half a century , it has been prescribed to patients with type 2 diabetes , yet its underlying mechanism remains largely elusive [ 12 ] .
metformin reduces glucose levels and improves insulin sensitivity .
recently , metformin has gained attention for its pleiotropic effects [ 18 ] .
in this study , we examined the effect of metformin on renal fibrosis .
the animal model used in our study was the uuo model , a well - established model of renal fibrosis .
our results showed that uuo induced significant renal fibrosis , as indicated by the upregulation of ecm proteins and collagen deposition in the kidney .
these results suggested that we had successfully built a renal fibrosis model .
activation of the renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) is associated with various deleterious effects , including vasoconstriction , inflammation , hypertrophy , and ecm protein synthesis [ 22,23,24,25,26 ] .
ang ii , the main effector of the ras , is a critical mediator of fibrogenesis .
the important role of ang ii has been well documented in both diabetic and nondiabetic progressive renal injury .
our elisa results showed that ang ii was upregulated in the kidney tissue of uuo mice , accompanied by the upregulation of at1r , suggesting that the ras had been activated .
tgf - beta is the key mediator of the profibrotic effects of ang ii [ 24 ] .
it is a cytokine that plays an essential role in the progression of renal fibrosis in various renal diseases through inducing the synthesis and accumulation of ecm proteins [ 8 ] .
ang ii induces the activation and transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into scar - forming myofibroblasts , which involves the activation of erk signaling and the subsequent upregulation of tgf - beta [ 10,23,27,28 ] .
we found that tgf - beta was upregulated in uuo mice , and that erk signaling was also activated , as indicated by the phosphorylation of erk .
to examine the effect of metformin in renal fibrosis , metformin was administered to uuo mice .
as shown by our results , metformin treatment in the uuo mice dramatically attenuated the expression of ecm proteins , including fibronectin and collagen i. the upregulation of tgf - beta induced by uuo was abolished by metformin administration .
moreover , erk phosphorylation was reduced by metformin , indicating that metformin attenuated the activation of erk signaling .
taken together , these results suggested that metformin attenuated renal fibrosis in uuo mice , accompanied by a decrease in tgf - beta and inhibition of the associated erk signaling pathway .
resident renal fibroblasts are the most important source of scar - producing myofibroblasts .
the activation and proliferation of resident fibroblasts in the kidney result in the enhanced production and excessive deposition of ecm proteins .
to confirm the effect of metformin in renal fibrosis , in vitro experiments were performed in renal fibroblast nrk - 49f cells .
the level of erk phosphorylation was elevated significantly after ang ii treatment , indicating that ang ii induced the activation of erk signaling .
furthermore , treatment with ang ii induced significant profibrotic effects including the upregulation of tgf - beta and excessive production of ecm proteins .
metformin treatment reversed the ang ii - induced ecm overproduction .
moreover , it also abolished the ang ii - induced upregulation of tgf - beta , and the activation of erk signaling .
taken together , these results suggest that metformin could be effective in reversing the profibrotic responses in renal fibroblasts .

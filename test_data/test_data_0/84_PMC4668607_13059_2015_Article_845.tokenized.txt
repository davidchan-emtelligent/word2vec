the original version of this article was corrected .
the corrected figure is given below : fig. 3 transcription pausing detected by rnet - seq in e. coli wt and deltagreab cells .
( a ) pause - inducing elements ( pies ) of the non - template dna strand .
information content is represented by sequence logos [ 51 ] .
positions - 1 and - 10 of dna ( gray ) correspond to the rna ( blue ) 3 ' and 5 ' ends of the rna - dna hybrid within rnap ( pink oval ) in pre - translocated ecs .
the active site is shown as an empty square .
p ( 0.9 , 100 ) and p ( 0.9 , 160 ) were used for wt ( n = 758 ) and deltagreab ( n = 419 ) , respectively ( see main text for the parameters ) .
a frequency matrix and map scores for the pies are shown in table s1 in additional file 2 .
( b ) categorization of all rnap pauses by rna type .
the non - coding rna ( ncrna ) and antisense rna were defined using the gene annotation file of e. coli ( see " materials and methods ") .
( c ) pausing frequently occurs in regions proximal to transcript start sites ( tss ) .
for panels b and c , p ( 0.7 , 100 ) is used in order to increase the number of samples .
note that even when using this reduced stringency the consensus sequence for pausing remains unaffected ( fig. s6b in additional file 1 ) the online version of the original article can be found under doi : 10.1186 / s13059 - 015 - 0666 - 5 .

the scn5a gene encodes the pore - forming alpha - subunit of the ion channel that carries the cardiac fast sodium current ( ina ) .
the 1795insd mutation in scn5a causes sinus bradycardia , with a mean heart rate of 70 beats / min in mutation carriers vs. 77 beats / min in non - carriers from the same family ( lowest heart rate 41 vs. 47 beats / min ) .
to unravel the underlying mechanism , we incorporated the mutation - induced changes in ina into a recently developed comprehensive computational model of a single human sinoatrial node cell ( fabbri - severi model ) .
the 1795insd mutation reduced the beating rate of the model cell from 74 to 69 beats / min ( from 49 to 43 beats / min in the simulated presence of 20 nmol / l acetylcholine ) .
the mutation - induced persistent ina per se resulted in a substantial increase in beating rate .
this gain - of - function effect was almost completely counteracted by the loss - of - function effect of the reduction in ina conductance .
the further loss - of - function effect of the shifts in steady - state activation and inactivation resulted in an overall loss - of - function effect of the 1795insd mutation .
we conclude that the experimentally identified mutation - induced changes in ina can explain the clinically observed sinus bradycardia .
furthermore , we conclude that the fabbri - severi model may prove a useful tool in understanding cardiac pacemaker activity in humans .
heart sinoatrial node electrophysiology long - qt syndrome sinus bradycardia sick sinus syndrome genetics sodium current ion channels computer simulations 1 .
introduction the ' fast sodium current ' ( ina ) , which flows through nav1.5 sodium channels , is a key player in the electrical activity of the human heart .
the cardiac - specific nav1.5 protein , encoded by the scn5a gene , is the pore - forming alpha - subunit of the channel .
the large and fast influx of sodium ions through the nav1.5 channels is not only responsible for the fast upstroke of individual atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes , but also for the fast impulse propagation in the atrial and ventricular tissue .
thus , ina is an important determinant of the pq interval , or pr interval , and the qrs duration on the body surface electrocardiogram ( ecg ) with the letters p , q , r , s , and t assigned to its deflections [ 1,2,3,4 ] .
mutations in genes encoding ion channel - related proteins may result in inherited arrhythmia disorders [ 5,6 ] , in particular the long qt syndrome ( lqts ) , which shows an estimated prevalence of 1:2000 [ 7 ] and is the most commonly encountered inherited arrhythmia disorder in clinical practice (=~ 35 % [ 8 ]) .
lqts type 3 ( lqt3 ) is caused by gain - of - function mutations in the scn5a gene .
slowed or incomplete inactivation of the nav1.5 channel results in an additional inward current , known as the late or persistent sodium current ( ipst ) , during the plateau phase of the ventricular action potential .
this additional inward current leads to an increase in the ventricular action potential duration and thereby to a prolongation of the qt interval on the ecg [ 9,10,11,12,13,14,15 ] .
the estimated prevalence of lqt3 among lqts patients is =~ 10 % [ 16,17 ] .
an intriguing and widely studied mutation among the mutations in scn5a associated with lqt3 is 1795insd , which is characterized by the insertion of 3 nucleotides ( tga ) at position 5537 in the dna sequence of the scn5a gene , causing an insertion of aspartic acid ( 1795insd ) in the c - terminal domain of the nav1.5 protein [ 18 ] .
carriers of this mutation may not only present with lqt3 , but also with ecg features of sinus bradycardia , progressive cardiac conduction disease , and brugada syndrome , thus creating the first described arrhythmic ' overlap syndrome ' [ 19,20 ] .
interestingly , 1795insd is supposed to be a gain - of - function mutation in light of the qt prolongation , but a loss - of - function mutation in light of the sinus bradycardia , progressive cardiac conduction disease , and brugada syndrome [ 18 ] .
acquisition of clinical data on carriers of the 1795insd mutation , which is a founder mutation in the netherlands [ 20 ] , started in 1958 with the presentation of abnormalities on a routine ecg [ 21 ] .
fifty years later , clinical data were available on 378 family members of whom 149 carried the 1795insd mutation in the scn5a gene [ 20 ] .
holter recording in 1795insd patients and non - affected family members (" non - carriers ") has revealed sinus bradycardia with an =~ 11 % decrease in minimum , average , and maximum heart rate [ 21 ] , as detailed in table 1 .
the bradycardic effect is not as large as for some other mutations in scn5a , e.g. , deltakpq [ 22 ] , or in hcn4 , another gene associated with " sick sinus syndrome " [ 23 ] .
yet , it may be severe .
this is because carriers of the 1795insd mutation , like carriers of other lqt3 mutations [ 24 ] , show an excessive pro - arrhythmic qt prolongation at low heart rates [ 25 ] , which may favour the development of early afterdepolarizations and torsades de pointes arrhythmias at rest or during sleep [ 24 ] .
accordingly , carriers of the mutation are prophylactically treated with an anti - bradycardia pacemaker as a preventive measure against the premature ( mostly nocturnal ) sudden cardiac deaths that are associated with the mutation [ 26 ] .
the 1795insd mutation was identified in 1998 [ 21 ] .
it was first described in 1999 by bezzina et al .
[ 18 ] , who also presented the first in vitro data on the functional effects of the mutation .
they had carried out voltage clamp experiments on wild - type and 1795insd mutant na + channels expressed in xenopus oocytes .
in line with the clinically observed conduction delays and brugada phenotype , mutational loss - of - function effects had been found .
the ina steady - state activation curve was shifted by + 8.1 mv , whereas the steady - state inactivation curve was shifted by - 7.3 mv. also , the maximal ina amplitude , as determined by voltage clamp steps from a holding potential of - 100 mv , was reduced by 78 % .
in subsequent studies by veldkamp et al .
[ 27,28 ] , who carried out patch clamp experiments on hek - 293 cells transfected with wild - type or 1795insd mutant cdna , a mutational gain - of - function effect was also observed : the mutant channels showed a persistent current of 1.4 +/ - 0.2 % ( mean +/ - standard error of the mean ( sem ) ; percent of ina peak current amplitude ) at - 20 mv [ 27 ] and this ipst ranged from 0.8 +/ - 0.2 % to 1.9 +/ - 0.8 % at voltages from - 50 to 0 mv ( with a value of 1.6 +/ - 0.5 % at - 20 mv ) [ 28 ] .
in the initial study [ 27 ] , the wild - type channels also showed a persistent current ( of 0.4 +/ - 0.1 % at - 20 mv ) , but in the subsequent study [ 28 ] this wild - type ipst was not only effectively zero at - 40 mv ( with a reported value of 0.04 +/ - 0.14 %) , but also at other membrane potential values , including - 20 mv. because human sinoatrial ( sa ) nodal tissue is not widely available for in vitro experiments , data on the functional role of nav1.5 channels in the pacemaker activity of the human sa node are scarce .
however , there is substantial evidence , albeit more or less indirect , for such a role .
first , several mutations in scn5a are associated with sinus bradycardia [ 29,30 ] .
second , human heart rate is affected by toxins and drugs that have an effect on the conductance or kinetics of nav1.5 channels [ 28 ] .
third , chandler et al .
[ 31 ] carried out an extensive study on the molecular architecture of the human sa node and demonstrated the expression of nav1.5 mrna and protein in the nodal tissue .
fourth , verkerk et al .
[ 32 ] observed large inward currents with characteristics of ina in two out of three cells in their unique patch clamp experiments on isolated human sa nodal pacemaker cells .
recently , fabbri et al .
[ 33 ] presented the first comprehensive mathematical model of the spontaneous electrical activity of a human sa nodal cell .
this fabbri - severi model is strictly based on and constrained by the available electrophysiological data .
thus , it also includes equations for ina .
the fabbri - severi model enabled us to carry out detailed computer simulations to assess each of the loss - of - function and gain - of - function effects of the 1795insd mutation ( i.e. , the reduction in ina conductance , the shifts in the steady - state activation and inactivation curves , and the persistent current ) .
our simulation results provide insight into the loss - of - function and gain - of - function effects of the 1795insd mutation as well as the complex interaction of these effects underlying the sinus bradycardia .
2. results 2.1 .
implementation of the 1795insd mutation before we could start to carry out the desired computer simulations , we had to determine the appropriate parameter settings of the sodium current of the fabbri - severi model cell .
first , we split the ina of the fabbri - severi model cell into a wild - type and a mutant component , thus representing the heterozygous nature of the mutation , as detailed in section 4.1 and section 4.2 .
for the wild - type component we used the regular ina equations of the model with the fully - activated conductance ( gna ) set to 50 % of the control value .
to implement the experimentally observed + 8.1 and - 7.3 mv shifts in the steady - state activation and inactivation curves of the 1795insd mutant ina [ 18 ] , we applied + 8.1 and - 7.3 mv shifts to the activation and inactivation equations of the mutant component .
the resulting steady - state activation and inactivation curves of the wild - type and mutant components are shown in figure 1a .
it is important to note that the shifts result in a large reduction in " window current " ( figure 1a , inset ) .
next , we simulated a voltage clamp step from a holding potential of - 100 mv to a test potential of - 25 mv. using this protocol , bezzina et al .
[ 18 ] had found that the peak mutant current amounted to 22 % of the peak wild - type current .
it turned out that we had to set the mutant gna to 50 % of the corresponding wild - type value to obtain the experimentally observed 78 % reduction in peak current .
the resulting current traces are shown in figure 1b .
the blue trace is obtained with the control sodium current of the fabbri - severi model cell ( 100 % wild - type ) , whereas the red trace is obtained with the mutant ina equations ( 100 % mutant ) , as in the experimental settings .
the 78 % reduction in peak current is not only due to the 50 % reduction in gna , but also to the + 8.1 and - 7.3 mv shifts in the steady - state activation and inactivation curves , which by themselves already create a reduction in peak current .
at the same time , 0.6 % of the mutant channels were made non - inactivating , as opposed to none of the wild - type channels , to incorporate a persistent current with an amplitude of 1.4 % of the peak current ( figure 1b , inset ) , in line with the experimentally observed persistent current at - 20 mv of 1.4 +/ - 0.2 % ( mean +/ - sem , n = 7 ) [ 27 ] and of 1.6 +/ - 0.5 % ( mean +/ - sem , n = 7 ) [ 28 ]. with the 0.6 % fraction of non - inactivating channels , ipst ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 % at voltages from - 50 to 0 mv , in line with the aforementioned experimentally observed range from 0.8 +/ - 0.2 % to 1.9 +/ - 0.8 % ( mean +/ - sem , n = 6 ) [ 28 ] .
altogether , the parameter settings of the mutant component of the model ina differed from those of the wild - type component in four respects , based on data from voltage clamp experiments [ 18,27,28 ] : a + 8.1 mv shift in activation , a - 7.3 mv shift in inactivation , a 50 % reduction in gna , and a 0.6 % fraction of non - inactivating channels ( underlying the experimentally observed persistent current ) .
computer simulations allowed us to determine how each of these parameters affected the pacemaker activity of the fabbri - severi model cell , thus gaining insight into the mechanisms underlying the clinically observed sinus bradycardia among carriers of the 1795insd mutation .
2.2 .
effects of the shifts in steady - state activation and inactivation we started our simulations with the default fabbri - severi model ( normal autonomic tone ) .
first , we assessed the effects of the shifts in activation and inactivation .
because the changes in membrane potential over the time course of a human sa nodal action potential , in particular during diastolic depolarization , are relatively slow , the amount of open , i.e. , conducting , na + channels is largely determined by the region of overlap of the steady - state activation and inactivation curves , which defines the " window current " .
as can be appreciated from figure 1a ( inset ) , either shift already results in a substantial decrease in window current .
the decrease is even larger in the presence of both shifts .
if the steady - state activation curve is shifted by + 8.1 mv , the model ina decreases by almost 50 % ( figure 2c , solid red trace versus dashed black trace ) , which implies that the remaining ina is almost completely carried by the wild - type component of the model ina .
a slightly smaller decrease is observed if the steady - state inactivation curve is shifted by - 7.3 mv ( figure 2c , blue trace ) .
in either case , the " mutant ina " is already largely inhibited , which explains why the further decrease in case of a combination of the two shifts is not very impressive ( figure 2c , green trace ) .
the decrease in ina results in a small decrease in the net inward current during diastolic depolarization ( figure 2b ) .
in the absence of a noticeable effect of ina on the action potential , the resulting decrease in diastolic depolarization rate leads to an increase in cycle length ( figure 2a ) , which is prolonged by 46 ms (+ 5.7 %) upon the + 8.1 mv shift in steady - state activation and by 44 ms (+ 5.4 %) upon the - 7.3 mv shift in steady - state inactivation ( table 2 ) .
the prolonging effects are far from additive : the prolongation amounts to 53 ms (+ 6.5 %) if the two shifts are combined .
2.3 .
effects of the reduction in fully - activated conductance and the incorporation of a persistent current next , we assessed the effects of the reduction in fully - activated conductance and , on the other hand , the incorporation of a persistent current , ipst .
like the mutation - induced shifts in activation and inactivation , the 50 % decrease in gna exhibits a loss - of - function effect on the model ina .
the remaining model ina , composed of wild - type and mutant ina , thus amounts to =~ 75 % of its control ( figure 3c , solid blue trace versus dashed black trace ) .
the resulting decrease in net inward current during diastolic depolarization ( figure 3b ) leads to a 26 - ms increase in cycle length (+ 3.2 % ; figure 3a , table 2 ) .
the persistent current , on the other hand , has a gain - of - function effect .
the sodium influx through the small amount of non - inactivating channels increases during diastole and reaches a peak of almost 4 pa during the upstroke of the action potential and its repolarization ( figure 3a,c , red traces ) , where the ina driving force is larger than near the top of the action potential .
during the systolic phase of the action potential , the non - persistent component of ina is effectively zero , which explains the similarity of the ina and ipst traces in figure 3c,d. the additional inward current during the systolic phase leads to a slight increase in action potential duration , amounting to 6.5 ms at 90 % repolarization ( figure 3a , table 2 ) .
this effect by itself would prolong the cycle length .
however , it is much smaller than the shortening effect of the additional inward current that now flows during diastolic depolarization ( figure 3a,c ) .
the net effect is a shortening of the cycle length by 66 ms ( - 8.1 % ; figure 3a , table 2 ) .
the gain - of - function effect of ipst is largely counteracted by the loss - of - function effect of the 50 % decrease in gna ( figure 3 , green traces ) .
the additional inward current is now limited to the second half of diastolic depolarization ( figure 3b,c ) and the cycle length is shortened by only 12 ms ( - 1.5 % ; figure 3a , table 2 ) .
2.4 .
net effect : loss of function versus gain of function the 1795insd mutation exhibits loss - of - function as well as gain - of - function effects .
in the next set of simulations , we quantified the loss - of - function effects per se , the gain - of - function effect per se , and the combined effect .
incorporation of the + 8.1 mv shift in activation , the - 7.3 mv shift in inactivation , and the 50 % decrease in gna , all loss - of - function effects , resulted in a dramatic decrease in model ina ( figure 4c , solid blue trace versus dashed black trace ) .
effectively , the remaining ina was carried by the wild - type channels .
the resulting decrease in net inward current ( figure 4b ) led to a 54 - ms increase in cycle length ( 6.6 % ; figure 4a , table 2 ) , which is only 0.8 ms more than the prolongation obtained with the shifts in activation and inactivation ( 6.5 % ; section 2.2 , table 2 ) .
we already noticed that ipst per se shortened the cycle length substantially , by 66 ms ( section 2.3 , table 2 ) , raising the question of whether the loss - of - function effects of the 1795insd mutation could cancel its gain - of - function effect and even prolong the cycle length to a clear extent .
the answer is shown in the dashed green traces of figure 4 , which are almost superimposed with the solid blue traces that show the loss - of - function effects per se. the net effect of the loss - of - function and gain - of - function effects appears to be a 53 - ms increase (+ 6.5 %) in cycle length ( figure 4a ) , which is almost identical to the 54 - ms increase in cycle length in case of the loss - of - function effects per se ( table 2 ) .
this is because ipst is so strongly reduced by the combined loss - of - function effects ( figure 4c ) that its shortening effect on the diastolic depolarization phase is almost cancelled .
on the other hand , there is sufficient ipst left to increase the action potential duration at 90 % repolarization by 2.0 ms ( figure 4a , table 2 ) , thus increasing the cycle length rather than decreasing it .
2.5 .
net effect at low heart rate the above simulations were all carried out with the default fabbri - severi model , i.e. , under normal autonomic tone .
in light of the 1795insd mutation , it is important to know whether the observed bradycardic effects of the mutation also occur at a low heart rate .
we therefore repeated the simulations of figure 4 during the simulated administration of 20 nmol / l acetylcholine ( ach ) , which reduces the beating rate of the model cell from 74 to 49 beats / min through its effect on several membrane ionic currents as well as the ca2 + uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum , as detailed in section 4.3 .
the simulation results under vagal tone , as shown in figure 5 , are qualitatively , i.e. , mechanistically , similar to those under normal autonomic tone .
there are , however , quantitative differences .
the loss - of - function effects of the mutation per se ( figure 5 , blue traces ) now result in a 188 - ms increase in cycle length , whereas the gain - of - function effect of the mutation per se ( figure 5 , red traces ) now results in a 209 - ms decrease in cycle length .
the net effect is again a clear prolongation of the cycle length , now by 168 ms (+ 14 %) , which is considerably larger than the 6.5 % prolongation under normal autonomic tone .
we also carried out simulations under beta - adrenergic tone .
the default beating rate of the model cell was increased from 74 to 140 beats / min through the simulated administration of isoprenaline , which , like ach , affects several membrane ionic currents as well as the ca2 + uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum , as detailed in section 4.3 .
the simulation results were qualitatively similar to those under normal autonomic tone and vagal tone .
the net effect of the 1795insd mutation was a prolongation of the cycle length by 21 ms (+ 4.9 %) .
2.6 .
sinus bradycardia the mutation effects on beating rate observed in our computer simulations are summarized in figure 6 , together with the clinical observations on the heart rate of heterozygous 1795insd mutation carriers by van den berg et al .
[ 21 ] .
figure 6a shows the clinical data of table 1 , which were obtained through 24 - h holter recordings from 54 mutation carriers and 40 non - affected family members .
bradycardic effects of the mutation were observed at all heart rates .
the decrease in heart rate amounted to =~ 11 % and the largest effect was observed at low heart rate .
the beating rate of the model cell showed a somewhat similar pattern ( figure 6b ) .
the 12 % decrease in beating rate at low heart rate closely matched the clinically observed decrease in heart rate .
however , with a decrease in beating rate of 6.1 % and 4.7 % , respectively , the bradycardic effect at average and high rate was clearly smaller than observed clinically .
3. discussion 3.1 .
applicability of the simulation results our simulation results demonstrate how the different loss - of - function and gain - of - function effects of the 1795insd mutation in scn5a compete and underlie the sinus bradycardia that is consistently observed in carriers of the mutation .
however , we have to keep in mind that our simulation data are at the single - cell level , whereas the clinical data are at the whole - heart level .
in our computer simulations , the complex structure of the sa node is not taken into account , neither is the electrotonic influence of the surrounding atrial tissue and the dependence thereof on the mutation of interest , which makes the atrial cells less excitable , nor are the potential pacemaker shifts upon vagal or beta - adrenergic stimulation [ 34,35 ] .
the complexity of the sa node has been acknowledged over the years [ 36,37,38,39 ] .
very recent studies have provided further insight into the highly specialized microanatomy of the human sa node [ 40,41 ] .
these important studies may provide a framework for future 3d simulation studies on the mechanisms underlying the robust human sa nodal pacemaker function and the effects of specific mutations like 1795insd .
in our model human sa nodal cell , the loss - of - function effects of the 1795insd mutation prevail .
this does not imply that the same holds for ventricular cardiomyocytes .
in these cells , the sodium current is much larger than in sa nodal cells , so that the associated persistent current that flows during the plateau phase of the action potential can cause a substantial increase in action potential duration , as observed in lqt3 patients in general and carriers of the 1795insd mutation in particular , despite the mutation - induced decrease in gna .
at the same time , this mutation - induced decrease in gna ensures that the sodium current during the upstroke of the action potential is substantially smaller than under control conditions , which can in turn explain the slowed conduction and brugada syndrome phenotype [ 18 ] .
our simulation results are not limited to the 1795insd mutation .
they are also applicable to phenotypically similar mutations in scn5a , like deltakpq , deltak1500 and e1784k , which show comparable loss - of - function and gain - of - function effects , i.e. , a decrease in peak inward current , a persistent current , a positive shift in steady - state activation , and a negative shift in steady - state inactivation [ 42 ] .
furthermore , they can help explain the sinus bradycardia that is observed in other mutations in scn5a that exhibit some of the effects of the 1795insd mutation , like the e161k mutation , which is associated with an almost threefold reduction in peak sodium current and a + 11.9 mv shift in steady - state activation , but does not show a persistent current or changes in inactivation properties [ 43 ] .
3.2 .
parameter settings we based the parameter settings of our mutant ina on the data from voltage clamp experiments by bezzina et al .
[ 18 ] and veldkamp et al .
[ 27,28 ] .
these experiments were carried out on wild - type and 1795insd mutant channels expressed in xenopus oocytes and hek - 293 cells , respectively .
in either case , the electrophysiological experiments were performed at room temperature ( 21 degreesc ) .
we cannot rule out that recordings at a more physiological temperature would have revealed additional effects of the 1795insd mutation , as has been the case for several other mutations in scn5a expressed in mammalian cell lines , like t1620m , y1795c , and y1795h [ 44,45 ] .
recordings from y1795c and y1795h channels at 32 degreesc by rivolta et al .
[ 44 ] revealed a prominent intermediate inactivated state that was almost absent at room temperature .
similarly , dumaine et al .
[ 45 ] had primarily observed several arrhythmogenic properties of the t1620m mutation at 32 degreesc , like a positive shift in the steady - state activation curve and a slower recovery from inactivation .
unfortunately , data on 1795insd channel kinetics at more physiological temperatures are not available .
hek - 293 cells are often considered more reliable because of their mammalian origin , but in a comparative study on nine different sick sinus syndrome - related mutations in scn5a , not including 1795insd , gui et al .
[ 46 ] found that most of the electrophysiological parameters obtained with oocytes were not different from those obtained with hek - 293 cells ( all recordings made at a room temperature of 20 - 22 degreesc ) .
however , apart from the difference in expression system ( mammalian versus non - mammalian ) , there was also a difference in the cotransfection with beta - subunits .
bezzina et al .
[ 18 ] only expressed the alpha - subunit of the channel , whereas veldkamp et al .
[ 27,28 ] coexpressed the human na + channel beta1 - subunit .
wei et al .
[ 47 ] showed that coexpression with the human na + channel beta1 - subunit may cause shifts in the voltage dependence of steady - state inactivation .
it is therefore conceivable that this coexpression , rather than the difference in expression system , may play a role in the three , or four , discrepancies in experimental observations that will now be discussed .
first , the data of bezzina et al .
[ 18 ] and veldkamp et al .
[ 27 ] regarding mutation - induced changes in the time course of inactivation and recovery from inactivation show differences in several respects .
however , the observed changes are relatively small [ 18 ] and reduce ina channel availability primarily at rapid heart rates [ 27 ] .
moderate changes in inactivation kinetics will not have a large impact on the outcome of our simulations because these kinetics are fast compared to the changes in membrane potential over the time course of a human sa nodal action potential .
therefore we refrained from incorporating any changes in inactivation kinetics into our model .
this may underlie the relatively small bradycardic effects at high rates ( figure 6b , rightmost bars , versus figure 6a , rightmost bars ) , where mutation - induced changes in inactivation kinetics may come into play [ 27 ] .
second , bezzina et al .
[ 18 ] found a shift in steady - state activation ( by + 8.1 mv ) as well as steady - state inactivation ( by - 7.3 mv ) , whereas veldkamp et al .
[ 27 ] only found a shift in steady - state inactivation ( by - 9.7 mv ) .
we adopted the data of bezzina et al .
[ 18 ] .
however , if we had adopted those of veldkamp et al .
[ 27 ] , our simulation results would not have been very different .
on the one hand , the absence of a positive shift in steady - state activation would result in a larger ipst , but on the other hand , it would also result in a smaller gna which is then required to match the voltage clamp data ( the smaller the shift in activation , the larger the peak current in voltage clamp ) , opposing the potential increase in ipst .
third , bezzina et al .
[ 18 ] observed a striking difference in peak amplitude between their wild - type and 1795insd mutant na + current , which we took into account in our voltage clamp simulations to determine gna , whereas veldkamp et al .
[ 28 ] observed wild - type and mutant peak currents of similar amplitude .
the latter data may , however , have been biased by limits put on the peak current to improve the voltage clamp conditions .
in their experiments on heterozygous scn5a1798insd /+ mice , i.e. , transgenic mice carrying the mouse equivalent ( 1798insd ) of the human scn5a - 1795insd mutation , remme et al .
[ 48,49 ] found a 39 % reduction in peak sodium current , which also points to a significant mutation - induced reduction in gna .
unfortunately , as noted by remme et al .
[ 48 ] , the heterozygous mice are not suitable to determine the characteristics of the mutant channels due to the prevailing wild - type channels .
in particular , relatively small changes in activation and inactivation kinetics of the mutant channels , as measured in transfection systems [ 18,28 ] , will be masked by these prevailing wild - type channels , explaining why remme et al .
[ 48 ] did not observe such changes .
the same holds for the heterozygous scn5a1798insd /+ mouse embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells of davis et al .
[ 50 ] , which also show a substantial reduction in peak sodium current .
homozygous mutant mice are not viable [ 48 ] .
otherwise , these could be used to directly assess the electrophysiological characteristics of the mutant channels in their native environment. of note , the nav1.5 alpha - subunit of the channel does not only interact with the beta1 - subunit , but also with other beta - subunits and various regulatory proteins [ 14,51,52,53 ] .
the observation of a persistent current by veldkamp et al .
[ 27,28 ] , but not by bezzina et al .
[ 18 ] , may be regarded as a fourth discrepancy .
however , bezzina et al .
[ 18 ] already " considered the possibility that a persistent inward current , usually < 2 % of the peak current , was too small to distinguish ," thus pointing to the technical limitations that hampered the discovery of a relatively small persistent current in their experiments .
3.3 .
previous simulation studies our simulations are certainly not the first to assess the effects of a specific mutation in scn5a on the electrical activity of cardiac myocytes .
however , in most studies conducted thus far , e.g. , [ 54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71 ] , the emphasis was on ventricular cells , some also considering atrial or purkinje cells .
fewer studies , e.g. , by butters et al .
[ 72 ] , wu et al .
[ 73 ] , and zhang et al .
[ 74 ] , focused on the effects on sa nodal cells , using the rabbit sa nodal cell models by zhang et al .
[ 75,76 ] .
in our original study of the effects of the 1795insd mutation on sa nodal cells [ 28 ] , we also used a rabbit sa nodal cell model [ 77 ] .
these rabbit models , in particular those of zhang et al .
[ 75,76 ] , do not only have a considerably shorter cycle length than the human model used in the present study , but also a different action potential configuration with a much shorter diastolic phase .
as a result , the role of gain - of - function effects of a mutation , which prolong the action potential duration , may have been exaggerated in previous simulation studies , whereas the role of loss - of - function effects , which act on the diastolic phase , may have been underestimated .
this also holds for our own study of the effects of the 1795insd mutation [ 28 ] and underscores the importance of the availability of a human sa nodal pacemaker cell model with an action potential configuration that closely resembles that of isolated human sa nodal pacemaker cells .
the recent development of a comprehensive model of a human sa nodal cell by fabbri et al .
[ 33 ] allowed us to assess the effects of the 1795insd mutation in a more realistic action potential configuration , with a much longer diastolic depolarization phase , than we could use before .
in our original study [ 28 ] , we did not take into account that the 1795insd mutation strongly reduces gna , as became irrefutable by the studies on transgenic mice by remme et al .
[ 48,49 ] .
furthermore , ipst was overestimated because it was modelled as a fraction of 1 - 3 % non - inactivating channels , whereas a fraction of 0.6 % can be sufficient to arrive at a persistent current with an amplitude of 1.4 % of the peak current , as shown in section 2.1 .
therefore , a direct comparison with our present study is not possible .
we can , however , conclude that the originally observed decrease in sinus rate through an increase in action potential duration [ 28 ] is much less important than anticipated , also because of the much longer diastolic phase of human sa nodal cells compared to rabbit sa nodal cells , which reduces the effect of an increase in action potential duration on rate .
the outcome of our simulations is , of course , dependent on the implementation of ina , as well as other individual ion currents , in the fabbri - severi model .
also , we have to keep in mind that there is no hyperpolarizing effect of the surrounding atrial tissue in our single cell simulations .
such hyperpolarizing effect may affect the interaction between the individual ion currents , e.g. , by increasing the availability of ( mutant ) sodium channels .
yet , the fabbri - severi model appears a useful tool to gain insight into the complex interaction between loss - of - function and gain - of - function effects of a specific mutation in scn5a .
3.4 .
future directions it seems challenging to repeat the experiments by bezzina et al .
[ 18 ] and veldkamp et al .
[ 27,28 ] under close - to - physiological conditions to unambiguously determine the effects of the 1795insd mutation .
also , action potential clamp experiments with the use of the action potentials recorded from isolated humans sa node cells by verkerk et al .
[ 78 ] may be helpful to further understand how wild - type and mutant sodium currents behave during a human sa nodal action potential .
another option is the use of dynamic clamp experiments in which the fabbri - severi model cell can interact in real time with cells expressing wild - type or 1795insd mutant nav1.5 channels .
4. materials and methods 4.1 .
computational model of a single human sa nodal pacemaker cell the spontaneous electrical activity of a single human sa nodal pacemaker cell was simulated using the comprehensive mathematical model of such cell that was recently developed by fabbri et al .
[ 33 ] .
this model contains hodgkin and huxley - type equations for the fast sodium current .
these read : ( 1 ) ina = m3.h.gna. ( vm - emh ) , ( 2 ) emh = r.tf . ln [ na +] e + 0.12. [ k +] e [ na +] i + 0.12. [ k +] i , ( 3 ) minfinity = 11 + e - ( vm + 42.0504 ) 8.3106 , ( 4 ) alpham = 200 .
vm + 411 - e - 0.1. ( vm + 41 ) , ( 5 ) betam = 8000.e - 0.056. ( vm + 66 ) , ( 6 ) taum = 1alpham + betam , ( 7 ) dmdt = minfinity - mtaum , ( 8 ) hinfinity = 11 + evm + 69.8044.4565 , ( 9 ) alphah = 20.e - 0.125. ( vm + 75 ) , ( 10 ) betah = 20001 + 320.e - 0.1. ( vm + 75 ) , ( 11 ) tauh = 1alphah + betah , ( 12 ) dhdt = hinfinity - htauh . in equation ( 1 ) , the membrane potential ( vm ) and reversal potential ( emh ) are in mv , whereas the sodium current ( ina ) and fully - activated conductance ( gna ) are in pa and ns , respectively ; m and h are the activation and inactivation gating variables , respectively .
the fully - activated conductance gna amounts to 22.3 ns. as can be inferred from equation ( 1 ) , ina does not have a persistent component under control conditions .
the reversal potential of ina ( i.e. , emh ) is computed with the universal gas constant r of 8.314 j.mol - 1.k - 1 , the faraday constant f of 96.485 c.mmol - 1 , the absolute temperature t of 310 k , the extracellular sodium concentration [ na +] e of 140 mmol.l - 1 , the extracellular potassium concentration [ k +] e of 5.4 mmol.l - 1 , the intracellular sodium concentration [ na +] i of 5.0 mmol.l - 1 , and the intracellular potassium concentration [ k +] i of 140 mmol.l - 1 , and amounts to 49.8 mv ( equation ( 2 )) .
equations ( 3 ) - ( 7 ) describe the time and voltage dependence of the activation gating variable m. its steady - state value minfinity is given by equation ( 3 ) , whereas equations ( 4 ) - ( 7 ) show the rate constants alpham and betam ( both expressed in s - 1 ) , the associated time constant taum ( in s ) , and the first - order differential equation for m. similarly , equations ( 8 ) - ( 12 ) describe the time and voltage dependence of the inactivation gating variable h .
4.2 .
implementation of the 1795insd mutation effects of the 1795insd mutation in scn5a were implemented in the cellml code [ 79 ] of the fabbri - severi model .
to this end , the model ina was split into a wild - type and a mutant component ( ina,wt and ina,mut , respectively ) , thus representing the heterozygous nature of the mutation .
accordingly , ina,wt was computed through equations ( 1 ) - ( 12 ) , but with gna reduced to 50 % of its control value , i.e. , with a gna value of 11.15 ns instead of 22.3 ns. the mutant component of ina ( i.e. , ina,mut ) differed from the wild - type component in several respects .
first , the voltage dependence of the equations governing the ina activation and inactivation kinetics was shifted by + 8.1 and - 7.3 mv , respectively , to implement the experimentally observed + 8.1 and - 7.3 mv shifts in the steady - state activation and inactivation curves [ 18 ] .
next , the fully - activated conductance ( gna,mut ) was scaled by 50 % , i.e. , to 25 % of the control value , to implement the experimentally observed reduction in peak current [ 18 ] , as set out in the results section .
furthermore , 0.6 % of the mutant ina channels were made non - inactivating to introduce a persistent component , i.e. , ipst , with an amplitude of 1.0 - 1.5 % of the peak current recorded in voltage clamp mode , in accordance with the experimentally observed ipst [ 27,28 ] .
the resulting equations for ina,mut , as far as they differ from equations ( 1 ) - ( 12 ) , read : ( 13 ) ina,mut = m3.h. ( 1 - f ). gna,mut. ( vm - emh )+ m3.f.gna,mut. ( vm - emh ) , ( 14 ) ipst = m3.f.gna,mut. ( vm - emh ) , ( 15 ) minfinity = 11 + e - (( vm - 8.1 )+ 42.0504 ) 8.3106 , ( 16 ) alpham = 200 .
( vm - 8.1 )+ 411 - e - 0.1. (( vm - 8.1 )+ 41 ) , ( 17 ) betam = 8000.e - 0.056. (( vm - 8.1 )+ 66 ) , ( 18 ) hinfinity = 11 + e ( vm + 7.3 )+ 69.8044.4565 , ( 19 ) alphah = 20.e - 0.125. (( vm + 7.3 )+ 75 ) , ( 20 ) betah = 20001 + 320.e - 0.1. (( vm + 7.3 )+ 75 ). with the fully - activated conductance gna,mut and the fraction of non - inactivating channels ( f ) of equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) set to 5.575 ns and 0.6 % , respectively .
a small fraction of the mutant channels is made non - inactivating by fixing their gating variable h to 1 , thus creating a non - zero persistent component of ina,mut , i.e. , ipst , whereas the remaining channels ( fraction 1 - f ) do inactivate ( equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 )) .
the voltage dependence of minfinity , alpham , and betam is shifted by + 8.1 mv ( equations ( 15 ) - ( 17 )) and that of hinfinity , alphah , and betah by - 7.3 mv ( equations ( 18 ) - ( 20 )) .
the resulting shift in voltage dependence of taum and tauh had a negligible effect on the outcome of the simulations ; the main effect of the mutation is through its effect on minfinity and hinfinity .
no attempts were made to implement the experimentally observed changes in inactivation kinetics [ 18,27,28 ] .
4.3 .
implementation of vagal and beta - adrenergic tone the default fabbri - severi model has a beating rate of 74 beats / min , which can be varied through the simulated administration of acetylcholine ( ach ) or isoprenaline ( iso ) , reflecting the autonomic modulation of pacemaking [ 33 ] .
the control beating rate of 74 beats / min was lowered to 49 beats / min ( vagal tone ) through the simulated administration of 20 nmol / l ach .
a beating rate of 140 beats / min ( beta - adrenergic tone ) was obtained through the simulated administration of iso , tuning the model parameters affected by iso to arrive at this beating rate .
in the fabbri - severi model , ach acts through activation of the ach - activated k + current ( ik,ach ) as well as inhibition of the hyperpolarization - activated ' funny current ' ( if ) , the l - type calcium current ( ica,l ) , and the sarco / endoplasmic reticulum ca2 + - atpase ( serca pump ) .
under control conditions , ik,ach is zero , but in the presence of ach it is computed through : ( 21 ) ik,ach = a.gk,ach. ( vm - ek ).( 1 + evm + 2020 ) , ( 22 ) ek = r.tf . ln [ k +] e [ k +] i , in which the maximal conductance gk,ach and reversal potential ek amount to 3.44 ns and - 87.0 mv , respectively .
the time and voltage dependence ( and ach dependence ) of the gating variable a is described by : ( 23 ) alphaa = 0.025641 + 3.5731591 + 18003.42 [ ach ] 1.6951 , ( 24 ) betaa = 10.e0.0133. ( vm + 40 ) , ( 25 ) ainfinity = alphaaalphaa + betaa , ( 26 ) taua = 1alphaa + betaa , ( 27 ) dadt = ainfinity - ataua , with the rate constants alphaa and betaa both expressed in s - 1 , the associated time constant taua in s , and the ach concentration [ ach ] in nmol / l. ach affects if by shifting the voltage dependence of its steady - state activation curve and its time constant in the negative direction along the voltage axis .
this shift ( achshift ) is computed through ( 28 ) achshift = - 1 - 9.898 . [ ach ] 0.618 [ ach ] 0.618 + 6.24976 , in which achshift is expressed in mv and [ ach ] in nmol / l. the shift amounts to - 6.0 mv at the simulated [ ach ] of 20 nmol / l , thus considerably inhibiting if. ica,l is also inhibited by ach .
the amount of block is expressed as a fraction achblock that is computed through : ( 29 ) achblock = 0.31 . [ ach ][ ach ]+ 90 , in which [ ach ] is again expressed in nmol / l. achblock amounts to 5.6 % at the simulated [ ach ] of 20 nmol / l. a similar equation holds for the amount of block of the serca pump , bup : ( 30 ) bup = 0.7 . [ ach ][ ach ]+ 90 , which amounts to 12.7 % at the simulated [ ach ] of 20 nmol / l. in the fabbri - severi model , iso acts through increasing effects on if , ica,l , and the serca pump , as opposed to ach .
furthermore , iso increases the sodium - potassium pump current ( inak ) and the slow delayed rectifier potassium current ( iks ) .
the associated parameters are tuned , all to the same extent , to arrive at a specific beating rate , as set out by fabbri et al .
[ 33 ] .
in our case , the parameters were tuned to obtain a rate of 140 beats / min .
the voltage dependence of the steady - state activation and time constant of if was shifted along the voltage axis by + 10 mv. the maximal conductance of ica,l was increased by 64 % .
furthermore , its steady - state activation curve was changed in two respects .
it was shifted along the voltage axis by - 10.67 mv and its slope factor was reduced by 29.244 % .
the maximal activity of the serca pump was increased by 25 % and that of inak by 60 % .
the fully - activated conductance of iks was also increased by 60 % .
furthermore , the steady - state activation and time constant curves of iks were shifted by - 18.7 mv along the voltage axis , thus further increasing iks .
altogether , these increasing effects on if , ica,l , iks , inak , and the serca pump resulted in an increase in beating rate to 140 beats / min .
4.4 .
computer simulations the cellml code of the fabbri - severi model , as available from the cellml model repository [ 80,81 ] , was edited and run in version 0.9.31.1409 of the windows based cellular open resource ( cor ) environment [ 82 ] .
all simulations were run for a period of 100 s , which appeared a sufficiently long time to reach steady - state behaviour .
the analyzed data are from the first complete action potentials after a simulated period of 90 s .
5. conclusions we conclude that the experimentally identified mutation - induced changes in ina can explain the clinically observed sinus bradycardia in carriers of the 1795insd mutation in the scn5a gene .
furthermore , we conclude that the fabbri - severi model may prove a useful tool in understanding cardiac pacemaker activity in humans .

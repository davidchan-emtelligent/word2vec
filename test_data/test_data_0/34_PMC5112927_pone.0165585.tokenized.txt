transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( tgev ) is a coronavirus that causes villus atrophy , followed by crypt hyperplasia , reduces the activities of intestinal digestive enzymes , and disrupts the absorption of intestinal nutrients .
in vivo , tgev primarily targets and infects intestinal epithelial cells , which play an important role in glucose absorption via the apical and basolateral transporters na + - dependent glucose transporter 1 ( sglt1 ) and facilitative glucose transporter 2 ( glut2 ) , respectively .
in this study , we therefore sought to evaluate the effects of tgev infection on glucose uptake and sglt1 and glut2 expression .
our data demonstrate that infection with tgev resulted in increased glucose uptake and augmented expression of egfr , sglt1 and glut2 .
moreover , inhibition studies showed that egfr modulated glucose uptake in control and tgev infected cells .
finally , high glucose absorption was subsequently found to promote tgev replication .

introduction transmissible gastroenteritis ( tge ) is a highly contagious infectious disease of pigs that is characterized by vomiting , diarrhea , and dehydration .
notably , the mortality rate of this disease in seronegative suckling piglets can reach up to 100 % [ 1 ] .
tge is caused by the tge virus ( tgev ) , which infects the gastrointestinal tract , causing villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia , and disrupting intestinal nutrition absorption [ 2 , 3 ] .
glucose is among the nutrients absorbed in the intestinal epithelium , and glucose uptake in epithelial cells depends on two types of glucose transporters , the apically expressed na + - dependent glucose transporter 1 ( sglt1 ) and basolaterally expressed facilitative glucose transporter 2 ( glut2 ) .
specifically , sglt1 mediates the na +/ glucose cotransport function of the kidney and intestine as a secondary active transporter , while glut2 serves as a facilitated diffusion system for transport through lipid bilayers [ 4 - 6 ] .
the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) was previously reported to transiently increase glucose transport [ 7 , 8 ] .
moreover , a recently study suggested that egfr may act as another receptor for tgev , in addition to porcine aminopeptidase ( papn ) [ 9 ] .
egfr - dependent regulation of glucose uptake has been observed in tumor cells , and egfr has been shown to prevent autophagic cell death by maintaining intracellular glucose levels through interaction with and stabilization of sglt1 [ 10 ] .
however , the involvement of egfr in virus - induced effects on glucose uptake has yet to be evaluated .
therefore , in the study , we aimed to examine the in vitro effects of tgev infection on glucose uptake and the expression of sglt1 and glut2 in porcine intestinal columnar epithelial ( ipec - j2 ) cells , which have been shown to offer a practical model for studying tgev infection [ 11 , 12 ] .
materials and methods cell lines ipec - j2 cells , which are porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells that were originally isolated from the middle jejunum of neonatal piglets , were purchased from dsmz ( braunschweig , germany ) , while hek293t cells were purchased from the american type culture collection ( atcc ; manassas , va , usa ) .
ipec - j2 and hek293t cells were maintained in roswell park memorial institute medium ( rpmi ) and dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) with high glucose , respectively , supplemented with hepes , 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ; gibco , grand island , ny , usa ) , and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) at 37degreesc in a 5 % co2 incubator ( thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) .
viral infection tgev strain shxb was isolated in shanghai , china .
the complete genome sequence for this virus is available at the genbank database ( id number : kp202848.1 ) [ 13 ] .
for experimental assays , cells were incubated with tgev at a multiplicity of infection ( moi ) of 2 for 1 h at 4degreesc in serum - free medium and washed with phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ; ph 7.2 ) at 4degreesc three times to remove unbound virus .
cells were then cultured in medium containing 2 % serum .
rna extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) total rna was extracted from ipec - j2 cells infected with tgev using trizol reagent ( invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
cdna was generated by reverse transcription using hiscript qrt supermix for qpcr ( vazyme biotech , nanjing , china ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
tgev release was assessed by measuring the levels of viral nucleoprotein ( n ) gene expression via quantitative rt - pcr using a takara sybr green qpcr kit ( takara , shiga , japan ) .
the primer sequences were as follows : n - f ( sense ) , 5 ' - caattcccgtggtc ggaaga - 3 ' , n - r ( antisense ) , 5 ' - tttacgttggcccttcacca - 3 ' .
pcr products were purified using a gel extraction kit ( omega bio - tek , inc. , norcross , ga , usa ) and cloned into the pjet1.2 vector ( thermo fisher ) .
plasmids were serially diluted and used as standards for quantitative analysis .
the initial copy number of the tgev n gene was calculated using the following formula : x0 = - k log ct + b , where x0 is the initial copy number and k , ct , and b refer to the slope rate , cycle threshold , and constant , respectively .
quantitative real - time pcr was performed with an abi prism 7500 detection system ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) .
western blotting at the indicated time points post - infection , cells were washed with pbs and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay ( ripa ) buffer ( thermo scientific ) containing a phosphatase inhibitor and protease inhibitor ( thermo scientific ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
the protein concentrations of the resulting lysates were determined using a pierce bca protein assay kit based on the bicinchoninic acid spectrophotometric method ( thermo scientific ) .
after centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 15 min , proteins in the supernatant ( 15 - 50 mug protein ) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) on 10 - 12 % gradient gels , and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride ( pvdf ) membranes ( merck millipore , darmstadt , germany ) .
membranes were blocked for 2 h in tris - buffered saline ( tbs ) containing 5 % nonfat dry milk , and probed with the indicated primary antibodies at 4degreesc overnight , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
the following antibodies were used in this study : anti - p - egfr antibody ( d7a5 ; cell signaling technology , danvers , ma , usa ) , anti - egfr ( c4267 ; cell signaling technology , danvers , ma , usa ) , anti - sglt1 ( ab14686 ; abcam , cambridge , uk ) , anti - glut2 ( sc - 7580 ; santa cruz biotechnology , dallas , tx , usa ) , anti - beta - tubulin ( e12 - 043 ; enogene biotech , new york , ny , usa ) .
membranes were then exposed to species - specific horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) - conjugated secondary antibodies ( dilution : 1:5,000 ) , and proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( ecl ; thermo scientific ) and autoradiography .
the resulting bands were quantified using quantity one 1 - d analysis software ( 170 - 9600 ; bio - rad , hercules , ca , usa ) .
the density of each band was measured and normalized to that of beta - tubulin expression .
all data were expressed as means +/ - standard deviations ( sd ) of the results of three independent experiments .
lentivirus - mediated rna interference ( rnai ) depletion experiments plvx - shrna is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( hiv - 1 ) - based lentiviral expression vector designed to express a small hairpin rna ( shrna ) for rnai studies ( clontech laboratories , inc. , mountain view , ca , usa ) .
the best silencing efficiencies were observed with clones nm _ 214007 ( porcine egfr ) and nm - 001012297.1 ( porcine sglt1 ) .
the shrna for egfr , three shrnas for sglt1 , and overexpression plasmid for egfr were designated as shegfr , shsglt1 - 1 , shsglt1 - 2 , shsglt1 - 3 , and plvx - egfr , respectively .
hek293t cells were transfected with 1 mug of specific expression plasmid per 106 cells using the x - tremegene hp dna transfection reagent ( roche , basel , switzerland ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions , diluted in opti - mem ( invitrogen ) in a t - 25 cell culture flasks .
lentiviral particles ( moi = 2 ) were subsequently added to the transfected ipec - j2 cells and gently mixed .
inhibitors after comparing amino acid sequences of egfr , sglt1 and glut2 from ncbi ( table 1 ) , we respectively selected ag1478 , phlorizin as the inhibitor of egfr and sglt1 .

briefly , the culture medium was removed by aspiration , and cells were gently washed twice with uptake buffer ( 140 mm nacl , 2 mm kcl , 1 mm kh2po4 , 10 mm mgcl2 , 1 mm cacl2 , 5 mm glucose , 5 mm l - alanine , 5 nm indomethacin , and 10 mm hepes - tris ; ph 7.4 ) .
after washing , cells were incubated in uptake buffer containing 2 - dg at 37degreesc for 30 min .
at the end of the incubation period , cells were washed three times with ice - cold uptake buffer and dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 % sds .
the level of intracellular 2 - dg uptake was determined by measuring the radioactivity of a 900 - mul aliquot of each sample using a liquid scintillation counter ( ls 6500 ; beckman instruments , fullerton , ca , usa ) .
the remainder of each sample was then used to determine protein expression levels of glucose transporters .
the radioactivity counts of each sample were normalized with respect to the protein and corrected for time uptake per milligram of protein .
all uptake measurements were carried out in triplicate .
glucose uptake was calculated as follows : glucose uptake ( nm / 106 cells ) = ( glucose concentration of the control group - glucose concentration of the experimental group )/ cell number .
carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester ( cfse ) labeling cfse stocks ( 10 mm in dmso ; invitrogen , merelbeke , belgium ) were stored at - 20degreesc prior to use , thawed , and diluted in phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) to the desired working concentrations .
ipec - j2 cells were resuspended in pbs ( 0.1 % bsa ) at 2 x 106 cells / ml and incubated with cfse ( final concentration : 1 mum ) for 7 min at 37degreesc .
cells were washed and resuspended in culture medium for 15 min to stabilize cfse staining , and cfse - labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry .
cell counting kit - 8 assays the viability of raw264.7 cells was determined using a cell counting kit - 8 assay kit ( beyotime biotechnology , beijing , china ) , as previously reported .
briefly , raw264.7 cells were plated at a density of 1 x 104 cells / well in 96 - well plates in 100 ml roswell park memorial institute 1640 medium and incubated for 24 h. twenty microliters of cell counting kit - 8 reagent was then added to each microwell , and plates were incubated for 2 h at 37degreesc .
the absorbance of the colored solution was measured using a microplate reader ( bio - rad laboratories ) at a test wavelength of 450 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm. statistical analysis all results are presented as means +/ - sd of the results of three independent experiments .
significant differences between control and experimental groups were analyzed using student 's t - test .
p - values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
results tgev infection results in increased glucose uptake as shown as in fig 1a , tgev infection triggered a significant increase in glucose uptake in ipec - j2 cells at 48 and 60 h post - infection ( hpi ) .
in addition , during late - stage infection , tgev - infected cells were able to continue transporting glucose , even when the concentration of glucose in the cell culture medium was low .
these data indicate that tgev infection promotes glucose uptake in ipec - j2 cells .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0165585.g001 fig 1 tgev infection promotes glucose uptake via increased protein expression of sglt1 and glut2 .
( a ) ipec - j2 cells were incubated with tgev ( moi = 2 ) at 4degreesc for 1 h and then at 37degreesc .
the culture medium was then collected at the indicated time points , and the glucose concentration in the medium was assayed .
total rna was isolated at 24 , 48 and 60 hours post - infection ( hpi ) .
( b ) sglt1 and ( c ) glut2 ( c ) mrna expression levels were measured by quantitative rt - pcr and normalized to that of the ppia gene .
( d - e ) whole - cell extracts were prepared from mock - infected ( control ) and tgev - infected ( tgev ) ipec - j2 cells at ( d ) 24 , ( e ) 48 , and ( f ) 60 hpi .
( j ) the protein expression levels of sglt1 , glut2 , beta - tubulin , and tgev n protein were determined by western blot analysis .
( g ) carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester ( cfse ) was used to label mock - infected ( control ) , tgev - infected ( tgev ) , and carbonyl cyanide m - chlorophenyl hydrazone ( cccp ) - treated ( cccp ; 10 mm ) cells , and flow cytometric analyses was performed at 24 , 48 , and 60 hpi .
( h ) data were quantified using spss software .
( i ) cck - 8 assays were performed to quantitatively assess the viability of cells incubated in dmem supplemented with 10 % fbs .
all cck - 8 assays were performed using six parallel samples .
statistical significance was assessed by student 's t - tests .
differences were considered significant at (*) 0.01 < p < 0.05 or (**) p < 0.01 .
all experiments were performed separately three times .
while fig 1b - 1f show the mrna and protein levels of sglt1 and glut2 at various time points .
notably , while there were no marked changes in the mrna expression of the sglt1 and glut2 genes after tgev infection , there were significant increases in the protein expression of both sglt1 and glut2 at 48 and 60 hpi .
to exclude the possibility that cell viability and proliferation may affect glucose uptake , cfse - labeled mock - infected ( control ) , tgev - infected ( tgev ) , and carbonyl cyanide m - chlorophenyl hydrazone ( cccp ) - treated ( cccp ) cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis .
cccp is known to reduce cell viability and proliferation , and was therefore utilized as a positive control [ 15 ] .
as shown in fig 1g - 1i , compared with cccp treatment , tgev infection had no significant effect on the proliferation and viability of ipec - j2 cells .
fig 1j shows tgev infection in ipec - j2 cells at 24hpi .
tgev infection increases egfr protein expression previous studies have shown that the expression of egfr is closely related to glucose transport , especially phosphorylation region of egfr .
egfr kinase activity regulates the peak glucose uptake and total egfr may likely be maintaining basal glucose uptake [ 7 , 8 ] .
therefore , we first examined whether egfr expression was stimulated by tgev infection .
western blot analysis showed that tgev infection not only increased total egfr expression ( fig 2a ) but also revealed that more phosphorylated egfr was present in tgev infected relative to control cells ( fig 2b ) .
taken together , these results indicated that tgev infection increased the total and phosphorylation protein expression of egfr at 48 hpi .
together , these results indicate that tgev infection promoted the total and phosphorylation protein expression of egfr at 48 hpi .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0165585.g002 fig 2 tgev infection increased egfr expression western blot analysis was performed to determine the levels of egfr ( a ) and p - egfr ( b ) in mock - infected ( control ) or tgev - infected ( tgev ) cell extracts harvested at 48 hpi .
beta - tubulin was also analyzed .
egfr regulates glucose uptake via interaction with sglt1 in mock - infected cells to explore whether egfr contributes to the observed tgev infection increase in glucose uptake , we explored changes in glucose uptake and the expression of glucose transport molecules by inhibiting or overexpressing egfr in mock - infected cells .
we choose ag1478 as egfr inhibition because it can inhibit the egfr tyrosine kinase activity and total egfr [ 16 , 17 ] .
as shown in fig 3a - 3c , treatment with the egfr inhibitor ag1478 suppressed glucose uptake and markedly decreased egfr and p - egfr protein expression , indicating that ag1478 regulated glucose uptake in mocked - infected cells .
furthermore , cells treated with ag1478 exhibited markedly lower levels of sglt1 protein expression than the control cells ; in contrast , there was no effect on glut2 protein expression .
thus , we concluded that ag1478 modulated glucose uptake in mock - infected cells via downregulation of egfr , which resulted in reduced sglt1 expression .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0165585.g003 fig 3 egfr influences glucose uptake levels in mock - infected ipec - j2 cells , and the expression of egfr and sglt1 protein was dynamic .
( a ) cells were treated with pbs , dmso ( 100 nm ) , or ag1478 ( 100 nm ) at 37degreesc for 48 h. the culture medium from each group was then assayed .
( b ) western blot analysis of the expression levels of p - egfr , egfr , sglt1 , glut2 , and beta - tubulin .
experiments were performed separately three times .
( c ) the intensities of protein bands were quantified using quantity one and spss software .
( d ) cells were transfected with shegfr , shegfr control , plvx - egfr , or plvx - egfr control .
after 48 h of incubation , culture medium from each group and from mock - infected cells was assayed .
( e ) the expression levels of p - egfr , egfr , sglt1 , glut2 , and beta - tubulin proteins were evaluated by western blot analysis .
experiments were performed separately three times .
( f ) the intensities of protein bands were quantified using quantity one and spss software .
( g ) ipec - j2 cells were treated with phlorizin ( 500 mum ) at 37degreesc for 48 h , and culture medium from each group was assayed .
( h ) the expression levels of sglt1 , egfr , and beta - tubulin were evaluated by western blot analysis .
( i ) the intensities of protein bands were quantified using quantity one and spss software .
( j ) ipec - j2 cells were treated with three sglt1 - specific sirna molecules for 48 h , and culture medium from each group was assayed .
( k ) western blot analysis of the expression levels of sglt1 , egfr , and beta - tubulin .
( l ) the intensities of protein bands were quantified using quantity one and spss software .
each experiment was performed separately three times .
as shown in fig 3d - 3f , we sought to then strengthen these findings via modulation of egfr expression .
transfection with shegfr resulted in significant downregulation of egfr and p - egfr protein expression and decreased glucose uptake compared with the cells transfected with the control shrna .
conversely , plvx - egfr transfection resulted in significantly increased egfr and p - egfr protein expression and glucose uptake .
these data demonstrate that modulation of egfr and p - egfr expression affects glucose uptake in the absence of tgev infection .
furthermore , transfection with shegfr and plvx - egfr resulted in decreased and increased sglt1 protein expression , respectively ; in contrast , glut2 protein expression was unaffected by either treatment .
together , these results indicate that egfr and p - egfr regulates glucose uptake in mock - infected ipec - j2 cells by modulation of sglt1 protein expression .
because sglt1 is involved in mediating the functions of egfr in hek - 293t cells [ 18 ] , we explored the relationship between egfr and sglt1 expression in ipec - j2 cells .
as shown in fig 3h and 3j - 3l , ipec - j2 cells transfected with three sglt1 - specific shrnas for 48 h exhibited reduced sglt1 expression and reduced egfr protein expression .
furthermore , we choose phlorizin as sglt1 inhibitor because phlorizin 's principal pharmacological action is to block intestinal glucose absorption through inhibition of the sodium - glucose symporters located inmucosa of the small intestine [ 19 , 20 ] .
ipec - j2 cells treated with phlorizin for 48 h showed downregulation of sglt1 expression without inducing cell death , as demonstrated by cck8 assay analyses ( data not shown ) .
similarly , western blot analysis showed that ipec - j2 cells treated with phlorizin exhibited lower egfr expression than dmso - treated cells .
in conclusion , inhibition of sglt1 by shrna or phlorizin treatment disrupted egfr expression .
notably , these treatments also resulted in decreased glucose uptake ( fig 3g and 3j ) .
consistent with these findings , ipec - j2 cells transfected with shegfr or treated with ag1478 also exhibited lower sglt1 expression ( fig 3b and 3e ) .
these data indicate that there is an association between egfr and sglt1 expression in ipec - j2 cells .
tgev infection - activated egfr results in increased glucose uptake to further investigate the role of tgev infection - enhanced egfr in the regulation of glucose uptake , we examined the effects of tgev infection after treatment or transfection with ag1478 , shegfr , or plvx - egfr on glucose uptake .
as shown in fig 4a and 4d , transfection with shegfr and treatment with ag1478 significantly inhibited glucose uptake , whereas transfection with plvx - egfr enhanced glucose uptake .
therefore , we concluded that egfr mediates glucose uptake in tgev - infected ipec - j2 cells .
moreover , as shown in fig 4b , 4c , 4e and 4f , after tgev infection , western blot analysis showed that transfection with shegfr and treatment with ag1478 resulted in lower protein expression of sglt1 and glut2 than that observed in the control group , whereas transfection with plvx - egfr resulted in increased sglt1 and glut2 protein expression .
together , these results indicate that egfr influences glucose uptake in tgev - infected cells by promoting both sglt1 and glut2 expression .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0165585.g004 fig 4 egfr influences glucose uptake in tgev - infected ipec - j2 cells .
( a ) cells were treated with pbs , dmso ( 100 nm ) , or ag1478 ( 100 nm ) at 37degreesc for 48 h. at 48 h after tgev infection , culture medium from each group was assayed .
( b ) western blot analysis of p - egfr , egfr , sglt1 , glut2 , and beta - tubulin protein expression .
( c ) the intensities of protein bands were quantified using quantity one and spss software .
( d ) cells were transfected with shegfr or plvx - egfr for 48 h. at 48 h after tgev infection , culture medium from each group and from mock - infected cells was assayed .
( e ) the protein expression of p - egfr , egfr , sglt1 , glut2 , and beta - tubulin was determined by western blot analysis .
experiments were performed separately three times .
( f ) the intensities of protein bands were quantified using quantity one and spss software .
each experiment was performed separately three times .
tgev replication are affected by intracellular glucose concentrations previous studies have suggested that the intracellular glucose concentration is closely linked with viral infections , particularly for double - stranded dna viruses [ 21 - 23 ] .
consistent with this conclusion , we found that tgev enhanced glucose uptake in ipec - j2 cells .
because glucose is the main energy source for cellular metabolism , tgev replication in ipec - j2 cells requires large amounts of glucose / energy .
thus , we explored whether high glucose uptake in tgev - infected cells affected tgev replication .
tgev contains a 27.6 - 31.3 - kb single - stranded , positive - sense rna genome ; the virion rna functions as an mrna and is infectious .
the n protein , in particular , is a critical component of the replication - transcription complex [ 24 - 26 ] .
thus , we treated tgev - infected cells with medium containing 0.1 , 1 , 10 , or 25 mm glucose and harvested the virus at 48 hpi .
as shown in fig 5a , glucose absorption concentrations were 0.1 , 1 , 1.8 , and 5.2 mm for medium containing 0.1 , 1 , 10 , and 25 mm glucose , respectively .
furthermore , western blot analysis showed that tgev n protein was more abundant when tgev - infected cells absorbed more glucose , particularly in medium containing 10 or 25 mm glucose ( fig 5b ) .
consistent with this finding , there was a concurrent increase in the copy number of the tgev n gene as glucose absorption levels increased ( fig 5c ) .
as described above , in tgev - infected ipec - j2 cells , higher glucose concentrations promoted tgev replication .
to exclude the possibility that cell viability and proliferation affect tgev replication , flow cytometric analysis of cfse - labeled cells was performed in the presence of 0.1 , 1 , 10 , and 25 mm glucose .
as shown in fig 5d - 5f , high glucose concentrations did not significantly affect proliferation and viability .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0165585.g005 fig 5 glucose promotes tgev replication .
( a ) ipec - j2 cells were cultured in medium containing 0.1 , 1 , 10 , or 25 mm glucose .
culture medium was then assayed .
( b ) whole - cell extracts were prepared after tgev infection for 48 h , and samples were analyzed for tgev n and beta - tubulin protein expression by western blotting .
( c ) total rna was extracted from culture medium supernatants , and tgev copy numbers were determined by rt - pcr analysis .
( d ) flow cytometric analysis of cells cultured in medium containing 0.1 , 1 , 10 , or 25 mm glucose and labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester ( cfse ) .
( e ) the resulting data were quantified using spss software .
( f ) cck - 8 assays were performed to quantitatively assess the viability of cells .
all cck - 8 assays were performed using six parallel samples .
discussion as recently reported , viral infection may result in increased or decreased glucose uptake .
for example , the hepatitis b virus x protein regulates hepatic glucose homeostasis via nitric oxide synthase [ 27 , 28 ] .
additionally , human cytomegalovirus ( hcmv ) enhances glucose uptake during the first 20 h after infection , even when a high level of glucose is constantly present in the medium [ 22 ] .
hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) replication suppresses cellular glucose uptake through downregulation of cell surface glucose transporters [ 29 ] , while rotavirus infection impairs rabbit intestinal brush - border membrane na + - solute cotransport activities [ 30 ] .
however , the effects of coronaviruses ( including tgev ) on glucose uptake have not been reported .
we found that tgev infection increased glucose uptake of ipec - j2 cells and the protein expression of sglt1 , glut2 after 48 hpi ( fig 1 ) , while tgev infection in ipec - j2 cells reached a peak at 48 hpi [ 31 ] , we just provided foresight to explore the interaction between tgev infection and glucose uptake , which is still worth exploring .
most of the glucose absorbed in the intestine is transformed to glutamine [ 32 ] , which was reported to promote the replication of many viruses , such as porcine circovirus ( pcv ) and hcmv , in vitro [ 33 , 34 ] .
because viral replication requires a lot of energy , we examined the effects of glucose absorption on tgev propagation .
our results demonstrate that increased glucose absorption enhanced tgev replication , suggesting that glucose may be transformed into glutamine in infected cells .
in this study , increases in sglt1 and glut2 protein expression directly stimulated glucose uptake in vitro .
although the role of other transporters cannot be ruled out , as sglt1 and glut2 dominate intestinal glucose transport , they may play important effect on glucose uptake in tgev infection .
however , no significant changes were observed in sglt1 or glut2 mrna expression levels , indicating that tgev infection primarily affects the protein expression of sglt1 and glut2 .
these findings were consistent with previous reports demonstrating that tgev infection influences protein translation .
additionally , sglt1 and glut2 have been shown to mediate intestinal glucose uptake through de novo synthesis of mrna and protein [ 35 ] .
within the last decade , the mechanisms of passive or diffusive components of intestinal glucose uptake have come under debate [ 36 ] .
the current paradigm describing intestinal uptake is that glucose enters the absorptive cell through sglt1 in the brush - border membrane and exits into the blood through glut2 , a member of the facilitative glucose transporter family , located in the basolateral membrane .
we have now provided evidence for an alternative mechanism for the passive component of absorption , i.e. , rapid trafficking of glut2 to the brush - border membrane was found to be controlled by the sglt1 - dependent activation of a protein kinase c ( pkc ) - dependent pathway and also by mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) intracellular signaling pathways [ 37 - 39 ] .
glut2 exhibits a > 10 - fold - higher glucose transport capacity than sglt1 and provides a major route of glucose absorption with rapid absorptive capacity [ 40 , 41 ] .
glut2 plays an important role in glucose absorption across the brush border membrane in normal jejunum [ 42 ] .
although our experiments did not directly demonstrate the rapid trafficking of glut2 , we found that tgev infection significantly increased glucose uptake at 48 h , indicating accelerated glucose absorption .
thus , tgev infection might promote glucose trafficking through glut2 .
moreover , because the tgev increased the protein expression of p - egfr ( fig 2b ) and tgev spike protein is capable of binding to egfr , thereby activating the downstream pkc - dependent and mapk intracellular signaling pathways [ 9 ] , the trafficking of glut2 to the brush - border membrane could be stimulated , allowing rapid transport of glucose .
previous studies have shown that glucose transport plays an important role in viral invasion .
glut1 - mediated glucose transport regulates hiv infection [ 43 ] and is a receptor for human t - cell leukemia virus ( htlv ) .
additionally , perturbations in glucose metabolism resulting from interactions between htlv envelope proteins and glut1 are likely to contribute to htlv - associated disorders [ 44 ] ; thus , analysis of the relationship between viral infection and glucose uptake is critical .
notably , in mock - infected cells , egfr mediate sglt1 protein expression .
indeed , previous literatures reported that egfr maintains intracellular glucose levels through interaction with and stabilization of sglt1 [ 10 ] [ 18 ] .
importantly , we found that egfr modulated sglt1 expression during infection , but it cannot be concluded unfortunately that the cellular effect of tgev infection on sglt1 is mediated via egfr .
because the drug treatment and knock down / overexpression against sglt1 had similar effects with egfr ( figs 3 and 4 ) .
in other words , it could also be direct effect on sglt1 , which in results in similar effect on egfr .
in fact , egfr and sglt1 are co - expressed in many other type cells [ 45 , 46 ] .
moreover , previous studies have shown that egfr is a target receptor for viruses and bacteria , including tgev and escherichia coli [ 9 , 47 ] .
thus , because egfr also interacts with sglt1 , this protein might comprise another ubiquitous target receptor .
egfr has been reported to increased glucose uptake which is critical for the cell [ 10 ] , we found the egfr and p - egfr both promote glucose uptake in ipec - j2 cells during tgev infection .
previous literatures reported that egfr kinase activity regulates the peak glucose uptake and total egfr may likely be maintaining basal glucose uptake [ 7 , 8 ] .
in our study , the ipec - j2 cells have been in a rich glucose medium during tgev infection , we also did not explore the respective role of egfr and p - egfr in glucose uptake .
the mechanism through which tgev causes diarrhea has not been elucidated .
on the other hand , glucose uptake has been shown to cause diarrhea [ 48 , 49 ] .
for example , enteropathogenic e. coli rapidly inactivates sglt1 through multiple mechanisms .
indeed , the finding that one mechanism occurs more rapidly than microvilli effacement provides a plausible explanation for the rapid onset of severe watery diarrhea , given the crucial role of sglt1 in the daily uptake of large amounts of fluids from the normal intestine .
in contrast , our data indicate that tgev infection resulted in increased sglt1 expression .
however , tgev infection did lead to rapid glucose uptake , which in turn supplied glucose to the virus and promoted long - term infection by tgev in the intestine .

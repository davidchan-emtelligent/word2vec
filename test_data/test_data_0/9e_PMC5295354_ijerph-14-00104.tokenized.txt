a suicide prevention strategy was launched in japan in 2006 to address the high suicide rate , which had increased considerably since 1998 .
the national strategy from 2007 involved the enhancement of psychiatric treatment services at emergency medical facilities and supportive observation by individuals close to patients .
the national suicide rate has decreased gradually since 2008 ; however , national information regarding the number of patients who had engaged in deliberate self - harm was absent .
therefore , the present study examined the longitudinal trend in hospital admissions due to deliberate self - harm in japan .
data from the national patient survey between 1996 and 2014 - - a nationally representative cross - sectional survey of inpatient care every 3 years - - were used .
data for 13,014 patients were included in the estimation of the number of hospital admissions due to deliberate self - harm .
the results show that the estimated number of admissions due to deliberate self - harm increased from 2078 in september 1996 to 3189 in september 2008 , when the national number of suicide cases peaked , and decreased to 1783 in 2014 .
approximately half of the patients were admitted to hospital because of self - harm via means other than drug poisoning , which had a high mortality rate ( 5.6 %) .
the proportion of patients receiving public assistance was higher in those who had engaged in deliberate self - harm ( 8.5 %) relative to that observed in the general population .
overall , the trend in deliberate self - harm was synchronous with the number of suicide cases over time .
as economic poverty has been associated with suicidal ideation and behavior and some recipients of public assistance tend to abuse psychotropic medication , the public assistance program should provide mental health support for recipients of social benefit schemes .
deliberate self - harm health policy suicide prevention 1 .
introduction suicide is a major global public health problem .
it has been estimated that over 800,000 people die by suicide annually , with numerous suicide attempts made prior to death [ 1 ] .
previous deliberate acts of self - harm is a key risk factor for suicide [ 2,3,4,5 ] .
although deliberate self - harm has been defined as intentional self - poisoning or self - injury regardless of the underlying motivation and of any intent to die [ 6 ] , there is overlap between deliberate self - harm and suicidal intentions [ 7 ] .
there is a distinction between medically serious self - harm that requires treatment in a hospital and other forms of self - harm , which do not require medical attention and might only be included in community samples .
admission to a hospital in the former population can be a cue as to the need for intervention .
interventions involving active contact and follow - up are effective in preventing further suicidal behavior in patients admitted to emergency departments following suicide attempts [ 8 ] .
however , no reports regarding the national prevalence of deliberate self - harm have been produced ; therefore , little attention has been paid to such care .
emergency treatment for patients who engage in deliberate self - harm sometimes lacks services such as mental health assessment [ 9 ] and positive encounters [ 10 ] .
japan 's suicide rate is higher relative to those of other organization for economic co - operation and development countries , and increased considerably following the 1998 economic recession [ 11 ] .
in 2006 , the basic act for suicide prevention allocated responsibility for suicide prevention to all stakeholders - - including municipal governments - - in japan [ 12 ] .
in 2007 , the japanese cabinet office released the general principles of suicide prevention policy ; this included an initiative concerning " efforts to prevent attempted suicide victims from reattempting suicide " , which involved the enhancement of psychiatric treatment services at emergency medical facilities and support for observation by individuals close to patients ( family members ) [ 13 ] .
economic recession has been found to exert a negative impact on self - harm and suicide [ 14 ] ; therefore , the longitudinal trend in deliberate self - harm requires examination .
however , information regarding the national number of hospital admissions due to deliberate self - harm is scarce in japan .
consequently , the effect of the national suicide prevention strategy on deliberate self - harm rates has not been examined .
therefore , the present study aimed to examine the prevalence of and time trend in hospital admissions due to deliberate self - harm in japan .
in relation to economic recession , we investigated the association between methods of self - harm behavior and the proportion of public assistance .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
design the study used a cross - sectional retrospective design that sampled data from the national patient survey - - a nationally representative cross - sectional survey of hospital services provided under the public healthcare insurance program , conducted in japan .
a detailed description of the national patient survey has been reported elsewhere [ 15 ] .
2.2 .
setting the national patient survey is conducted by the ministry of health , labour , and welfare in october every 3 years , and includes inpatient surveys .
the current study used discharge information from databases for 1996 - 2014 , as this included the economic recession ( 1997 ) and introduction of the basic act for suicide prevention ( 2006 ) .
permission to access the national patient survey data during the study period was obtained from the ministry of health , labour , and welfare .
the national patient survey used a two - stage stratified random sampling procedure .
in the first stage , 76 % of all hospitals were selected ; in the second stage , discharge samples were selected from the chosen hospitals .
the managing director of each hospital was asked to provide patient data on a designated date between 21 and 23 october every 3 years .
patient data were examined for 1 to 30 september every 3 years between 1996 and 2014 .
2.3 .
participants in total , 5,978,024 patient - level questionnaires were collected during the study period .
data were extracted for 13,014 patients who had engaged in deliberate self - harm , and whose primary disease code fell between s00 and t98 in the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems , 10th revision ( icd - 10 ) .
data for these patients were included in the estimation of the national number of hospital admissions due to deliberate self - harm .
2.4 .
measurements the national patient survey includes questions pertaining to discharged patients' primary diseases , deliberate self - harm , treatment outcomes , and characteristics .
a weighting coefficient was allocated to each patient based on the sampling rate .
regional residence and hospital characteristics were derived from the survey of medical institutions .
primary diseases were classified using icd - 10 codes a00 - t98 .
when the primary disease was coded as injury , poisoning , and certain other consequences of external causes ( s00 - t98 ) , external causes were classified into four categories : deliberate self - harm , harm caused by others , accident , and other / not specified .
the presence of deliberate self - harm was used to extract data for the patient sample .
based on previous studies that reported fatalities occurring due to different means of self - harm [ 2,3,5 ] , patients were classified into the following three categories : drug poisoning , substance poisoning , and other self - injury .
treatment outcomes were classified into six categories : cured , improved , unchanged , worsened , death , and other condition .
in the current study , the number of decedents was used as a measure of fatality .
information regarding the following patient characteristics was collected : age , sex , duration of hospitalization , and receipt of public assistance .
the japanese public assistance program provides social benefit to people who are classified as destitute according to their daily needs .
regional data were obtained by summing municipal data regarding the number of psychiatric hospital beds per 1000 population in the health region as of 1 october each year ( derived from the survey of medical institutions ) .
the total population as of 31 march each year was derived from the basic resident register and population ( ministry of internal affairs and communications ) .
the prefectural government plans the allocation of healthcare resources based on health regions (" the secondary tier of medical care ") , which usually include multiple municipalities .
during the study period , the number of included municipalities decreased from 3252 to 1741 because of a municipal merger , in which the boundaries of health regions were revised .
therefore , each variable was calculated based on the boundaries of municipalities and health regions as of 1 october 2014 .
the locations of patients' residences and hospitals were classified into four categories : same municipality , different municipality in same region , different region in same prefecture ( state ) , and different prefecture .
2.5 .
ethical considerations the completion and return of the survey implied consent ; therefore , the hospitals were not required to sign consent forms .
to preserve respondents' anonymity , identification numbers were assigned to hospitals and patients .
the study was approved by the ethics review board at the tokyo metropolitan institute of medical science ( project no .
15 - 4 , approval on 16 march 2015 ) , and the investigations were carried out following the rules of the declaration of helsinki of 1975 , revised in 2008 .
2.6 .
data analysis patients were divided into groups according to the means via which deliberate self - harm occurred , and age distribution was compared between these groups .
the patient sample was divided into three categories using the 25th and 75th percentiles for each regional characteristic .
the national number of patients admitted to hospital because of deliberate self - harm and subsequently discharged was estimated by summing the weighting coefficients for the patients with reference to the national number of suicide cases each september .
suicide statistics were derived from vital statistics provided by the ministry of health , labour , and welfare in japan .
all statistical analyses were conducted using stata se for windows , version 14.0 ( statacorp , college station , tx , usa ) .
the two - tailed significance level was set at 0.05 .
3. results 3.1 .
patient characteristics of the 13,014 patients admitted to hospital because of deliberate self - harm , 42.2 % were men .
the patients' mean age was 43.4 ( standard deviation : 21.5 ) years .
in addition , 40 % received follow - up outpatient care from the hospital to which they were admitted .
more than half of the patients were admitted to hospitals in the municipality in which they resided , and one third resided in a region with fewer psychiatric beds per population ( table 1 ) .
almost half of the patients ( n = 6015 , 46.2 %) were discharged within 2 days of admission. of the 13,014 patients , 6025 were admitted to hospital because of injury ( icd - 10 codes s00 - t34 ) .
in addition , 5674 were admitted to hospital because of drug poisoning ( t36 - t50 ) ; of these , 5212 had taken other unspecified drugs , medicaments , or biological substances ( t50.9 ) , while 358 had taken antiepileptic , sedative - hypnotic , or antiparkinsonism drugs ( t41 ) .
in addition , 1056 patients were admitted to hospital because of substance poisoning ( t51 - t65 ) ; of these , 592 , 217 , and 176 had experienced the toxic effects of unspecified substances ( t65.9 ) , pesticides ( t60 ) , and carbon monoxide ( t58 ) , respectively .
the remaining 259 patients included 183 , 12 , 10 , and 54 admitted because of other unspecified effects of external causes ( t66 - t78 ) ; certain early complications of trauma ( t79 ) ; complications of surgical and medical care , not elsewhere classified ( t80 - t88 ) ; and the sequelae of injuries , poisoning , and other consequences of external causes ( t90 - t98 ) , respectively .
therefore , patients were divided into following three categories : drug poisoning ( n = 5677 ; t36 - t50 and t96 ) , substance poisoning ( n = 1060 ; t51 - t65 and t97 ) , and other self - injury ( n = 6277 ; s00 - t34 , t66 - t96 , and t98 ) ; the proportions of decedents in these groups were 1 % ( n = 57 ) , 6.9 % ( n = 73 ) , and 5.4 % ( n = 341 ) , respectively .
patients admitted because of drug poisoning were younger relative to those admitted because of substance poisoning or other self - injury , f ( 2 ) = 536.34 , p < 0.001 .
most patients admitted because of drug poisoning were aged between 20 and 39 years .
approximately 800 cases involved other self - injury , across all age groups ( figure 1 ) .
the graph shows the observed number of patients admitted to hospital because of deliberate self - harm and subsequently discharged , according to age and type of self - harm , for every third september between 1996 and 2014 .
3.2 .
estimation of the number of patients who engaged in deliberate self - harm the estimated number of patients who had engaged in deliberate self - harm during the month of september increased from 2078 in 1996 to 3189 in 2008 , when the number of suicide cases reached a peak , and decreased to 1783 in 2014 ( figure 2 ) .
the estimated number of cases involving drug poisoning increased between 1996 and 2008 , and decreased between 2011 and 2014 .
the estimated number of cases involving other self - injury remained at approximately 1500 between 1996 and 2008 , and decreased in 2011 .
the estimated numbers of cases involving substance poisoning were higher in 2008 and 2011 relative to those observed in the other years included in the study .
the graph shows the estimated numbers of patients admitted to hospital because of deliberate self - harm and subsequently discharged , according to type of self - harm , for every third september between 1996 and 2014 .
quarry marks represent the national number of suicide cases for each september .
suicide statistics were derived from vital statistics provided by the ministry of health , labour , and welfare in japan .
4. discussion the estimated number of patients who engaged in deliberate self - harm increased between 1996 and 2008 , and decreased in 2011 , in parallel with the national number of suicide cases .
approximately half of the patients were admitted because of self - harm involving means other than drug poisoning , which had a relatively high mortality rate ( 5.6 %) .
this patient group included higher numbers of patients of the male sex and older age , which have been associated with fatal self - harm [ 2,3 ] .
this was the first study to demonstrate similar time trends for the numbers of suicides and hospital admissions due to deliberate self - harm , using national data .
the results provide evidence to support the theory that while there are many differences between suicide and self - harming behavior , some cases of suicide and deliberate self - harm have overlapping spectra [ 14,16,17 ] .
the results also indicated that the number of patients admitted to hospital because of deliberate self - harm was similar to the number of suicide decedents in japan .
further , these patients were younger relative to suicide decedents .
whereas younger populations usually have lower suicide rates compared to middle - aged and elderly individuals , suicide prevention should include the former in the target population as well as the older generations .
care for suicide prevention should be provided for those who commit deliberate self - harm , as suggested by previous swedish research [ 18 ] .
the proportion of public assistance recipients ( 8.5 %) in the patient sample was higher relative to that observed in the general population ( 1.67 % in 2012 ) [ 19 ] .
as economic poverty has been associated with suicidal ideation and behavior [ 20 ] , receipt of public assistance could be a risk factor for deliberate self - harm .
the rate of receipt of public assistance was particularly high in drug poisoning cases .
in addition , some recipients of public assistance tend to abuse psychotropic medication [ 21 ] .
furthermore , most drug poisoning cases in japan involved current or previous exposure to psychotropic medication [ 22 ] .
deliberate self - harm is also associated with a range of psychiatric difficulties [ 23,24 ] .
however , recipients of public assistance are excluded from coverage by the public healthcare insurance program , and hence excluded from the regular health - check system that health insurers are obliged to provide in japan .
therefore , receipt of public assistance could indicate a need for mental health care , and the public assistance program should provide mental health support for recipients of social benefit schemes .
the number of patients admitted because of drug poisoning increased in parallel with the national suicide rate from 1998 onward , when unemployment increased dramatically following the economic recession .
since then , drug poisoning has been one of the most prevalent means of deliberate self - harm .
unlike in the united states , firearms are unavailable to the public in japan [ 25 ] ; therefore , drug poisoning is a more accessible means of self - harm .
while the japanese healthcare scheme - - which consists of public insurance programs - - covers all residents , there is no registration system for general practitioners .
therefore , people can access multiple physicians without mandatory referral or information sharing .
patients who have engaged in deliberate self - harm could be discharged from hospital without referral to their general practitioner .
a system via which information regarding deliberate drug poisoning is shared between general practitioners and hospitals should be established .
the estimated number of substance poisoning cases increased in 2008 ( 318 ) and 2011 ( 316 ) .
according to vital statistics provided by the ministry of health , labour , and welfare [ 26 ] , the number of suicide cases involving substance poisoning ( icd - 10 codes : x65 - x69 ) were high in 2005 ( n = 5062 ) and 2008 ( n = 4814 ) .
the difference in time trends between cases involving deliberate self - harm and suicide could be attributed to the sampling process used for patients who had engaged in deliberate self - harm .
as our sample was limited to patients who had been discharged from hospital , those who had not received inpatient care were excluded .
future studies should use epidemiological designs to capture the national prevalence of deliberate self - harm in japan .
the present study was the first to estimate the national number of hospital admissions due to deliberate self - harm in japan .
the national patient survey did not include icd - 10 codes v01 - y98 ( external causes of morbidity and mortality ) ; therefore , information regarding certain means of self - injury , such as hanging , jumping , cutting , or piercing , was unavailable .
patients with self - injury would have included those who were treated for hanging , jumping , cutting , or piercing ; however , we could not identify these subgroups because of a lack of information .
in addition , the national patient survey did not collect detailed information regarding comorbid mental illness or other socio - demographic factors .
further , the cross - sectional design did not allow assessment of multiple admissions over time .
5. conclusions in conclusion , the trend in deliberate self - harm was synchronous with that in suicide cases over time .
suicide prevention strategies should include care for those who attempt suicide and target younger , as well as middle - aged and elderly , individuals .
in addition , the public assistance program should provide mental health support for recipients of social benefit schemes , and a system via which information regarding deliberate drug poisoning is shared between general practitioners and hospitals should be established .

adult - onset still 's disease ( aosd ) is an immune - mediated systemic disease with quotidian - spiking fever , rash , and inflammatory arthritis .
hyperferritinemia is a prominent feature , often used for screening. methods .
the key terms " ferritin " and " hyperferritinemia " were used to search pubmed and medline and were cross - referenced with " still 's disease. " results .
hyperferritinemia , although nonspecific , is particularly prevalent in aosd .
while most clinicians associate ferritin with iron metabolism , this is mostly true for the h isoform and not for the l isoform that tends to increase dramatically in hyperferritenemia .
in these situations , hyperferritinemia is not associated with iron metabolism and may even mask an underlying iron deficiency .
we review , in systematic fashion , the current basic science and clinical literature regarding the regulation of ferritin and its use in the diagnosis and management of aosd. conclusion .
serum hyperferritinemia in aosd has been described for 2 decades , although its mechanism has not yet been completely elucidated .
regulation by proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin ( il ) - 1b , il - 6 , il - 18 , mcsf , and inf - alpha provides a link to the disease pathogenesis and may explain rapid resolution of hyperferritinemia after targeted treatment and inhibition of key cytokines .
1. introduction adult - onset still 's disease ( aosd ) is a rare , immune - mediated , multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by quotidian spiking fevers , evanescent rash , and arthritis .
it is frequently underdiagnosed and one of the main reasons for hospital admissions due to pyrexia of unknown origin ( puo ) .
the disease characteristically affects young individuals , with three quarters of the patients reporting disease onset between 16 and 35 years of age [ 1 , 2 ] .
other symptoms include myalgia , inflammatory myopathy , liver abnormalities , pseudoangiocholitis , pleuritis , pericarditis , splenomegaly , pericardial tamponade and myocarditis , pulmonary fibrosis , pleural effusions , adult respiratory distress syndrome , interstitial nephritis , subacute glomerulitis , renal amyloidosis , collapsing glomerulopathy , thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura , pure red cell aplasia , cranial nerve palsies , seizures , aseptic meningoencephalitis , and miller - fisher syndrome .
this syndrome was formerly thought to occur solely in children as systemic - onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( sojia ) , previously known as juvenile still 's disease .
bywaters described in , 1971 , a new disease entity that he named adult still 's disease ; it involved adult patients who did not meet the criteria for classic rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) but displayed features similar to those described in pediatric still 's disease [ 3 ] .
its etiology remains unknown .
an infectious etiology has been postulated , although a definitive agent has never been identified and infectious agents are thought to be innate immunity triggers , leading to the clinical phenotype .
2. methods the key terms " ferritin " and " hyperferritinemia " were used to search medline and pubmed and cross - referenced with the key term " still 's disease " and " adult - onset still 's disease " for all available full - text articles .
studies identified by the search strategies were assessed for relevance prior to inclusion in the paper .
while the emphasis was on human studies , a few selected animal studies were included which provided important clues about the underlying pathophysiology .
3. results 3.1 .
regulation of ferritin a well - known feature of aosd has increased levels of serum ferritin , usually five times , or more , above the upper limits of normal that at times may be extreme (> 50,000 ug / dl ) .
while by no means specific for the disease , serum hyperferritinemia is often used to aid the diagnosis of aosd and serial serum levels are often used as a sort of biomarker to monitor response to treatment .
ferritin ( apoferritin / iron - free ferritin ) is a high - molecular - weight protein ( 450 to 600 kda ) composed of a nanocage of 24 assembled subunits .
it can sequester up to 4500 iron atoms [ 24 ] .
it is 8 - 12 nm in diameter which is as small as spherical viruses [ 25 , 26 ] .
it is found in many tissues and cell types .
it is a necessary molecule for the cell 's respiratory function where iron storage could cause free radical injury .
the best - known function of ferritin is storage of iron .
ferritin captures the intracellular labile iron pool and thus " buffers " its effect .
it is also an acute phase reactant , involved in inflammatory processes , which includes oxidative - stress - induced cell processes .
complementary dna ( antioxidant responsive element / maf recognition element ) along with mrna ( iron responsive element ) regulates rate of ferritin synthesis [ 5 , 27 ] .
the cytoplasmic ferritin content is regulated by the translation of ferritin mrnas in response to an intracellular pool of " chelatable " and " labile " iron .
inflammation is associated with increased production of ferritin by the histiocytomacrophage system and / or increased release from damaged hepatocytes .
however , the precise mechanism and the regulation of this phenomenon are poorly defined [ 28 ] .
ferritin levels are increased in a few autoimmune diseases like ra but they hardly ever go as high as in aosd [ 5 ] .
3.2 .
heme oxygenase - 1 enzyme and ferritin expression there has been a close association between the heme oxygenase - 1 ( ho - 1 ) enzyme and ferritin expression in aosd .
ho - 1 is an enzyme that degrades heme when induced to co , fe2 + , and biliverdin .
it is expressed by macrophages and endothelial cells in response to stress .
studies have shown that ho - 1 mrna increases in aosd and that it may correlate with aosd disease activity [ 15 , 33 ] , making it a potentially useful biomarker .
3.3 .
ferritin isoforms isoelectric - focusing studies have identified several isoforms of ferritin .
the acid form ( h , heavy ) is found chiefly in organs with low iron content , such as the heart and pancreas .
in contrast , the base form ( l , light ) is found in organs ( liver , spleen ) and the histiocyte - macrophage system that has a significant iron storage capacity ( figure 1 ) .
the l - ferritin isoform is the one which is released in the circulation .
the h - isoform has multiple catalytic sites and is faster than the l form .
h - ferritin plays a major role rapid detoxification of iron and intracellular iron transport , whereas l - ferritin is involved in iron nucleation , mineralization , and long - term storage .
the h : l ratio is normally constant in a cell , although it may change in hemochromatosis and other iron overload diseases [ 10 - 12 ] .
the h : l ferritin ratio has not yet been defined in aosd .
in situations of iron overload , it may be advantageous to the cell to synthesize l - ferritin , since these ferritins are not only able to store higher iron amounts but can also retain iron more firmly and turn over iron more slowly than their h - ferritin counterparts [ 11 ] .
in diseases like hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome , mutations in l ferritin have been documented [ 50 ] .
however , no such study in aosd has been contacted yet .
a new isoform of ferritin has recently been described in breast cancer patients , hiv patients , and in pregnancy [ 51 ] .
this finding suggests that there may be other isoforms that have not been identified yet and could explain the hyperferritinemia phenomenon in aosd .
3.4 .
ferritin and disease pathogenesis the pathogenesis behind increased ferritin levels is thought to be cytokine mediated .
cytokines regulate ferritin synthesis at transcriptional , posttranscriptional , and translational stages .
cytokines implicated are il1alpha , il1beta , il18 , tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) , interferon - gamma ( ifn - gamma ) , macrophage - colony stimulating factor ( m - csf ) , il6 , and il - 18 [ 28 , 52 - 55 ] .
il1alpha , ifn - gamma , and tnf - alpha have shown to induce the expression of h - ferritin [ 54 , 56 , 57 ] .
translation of ferritin is induced by il1beta , il - 6 , or tnf - alpha [ 58 ] .
il1beta also affects ferritin regulation at a posttranscriptional stage [ 59 ] .
the serum levels of th1 cytokines and soluble il - 2 receptors are higher in aosd than in other inflammatory joint diseases and have been correlated to the serum ferritin level [ 10 ] .
a study by choi et al. on cytokines in aosd showed significantly high il - 18 , ifn - gamma , and il - 8 levels in the sera of aosd patients than healthy controls .
also , soluble il - 2 receptors level was increased only in active stage of aosd which would indicate that soluble il - 2 receptor may be used as a potential marker for monitoring the disease activity in aosd [ 42 ] .
cytokines may also affect ferritin translation indirectly by their ability to induce nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) and hence increase no. no in turn induces ferritin expression [ 53 , 60 ] .
the cytokine - mediated regulation suggests that inflammation can affect ferritin regulation .
there is also data to suggest that thyroid hormones play a role in ferritin expression [ 53 , 61 ] .
lipopolysaccharide ( lps ; endotoxin ) , an outer membrane component of several gram - negative bacteria , elicits a variety of reactions that involve ferritin [ 53 ] .
in most studies , a threshold for serum ferritin levels of 1000 ng / ml , five times the upper limits of normal ( 40 - 200 ng / ml ) , has been used to suggest the presence of aosd [ 28 ] .
very high levels ranging from 4000 ng / ml to 30,000 ng / ml are not uncommon , and even extreme levels as high as 250,000 ng / ml have been reported [ 2 ] .
ferritin levels in aosd are usually higher than those found in patients with other autoimmune or inflammatory diseases [ 44 ] .
it is not clear yet whether ferritin plays a role in the disease pathogenesis or it is just an acute phase reactant / silent bystander .
in patients with chronic hepatitis c , ferritin and ast levels have been correlated , although increased ferritin does not seem to have a role in the extrahepatic manifestations of the disease .
also , in these patients , increased ferritin levels are not associated with the b - cell dysfunction represented by cryoglobulin and nonorgan - specific antibody production [ 18 ] .
additionally , there are several diseases associated with high ferritin levels that do not share any symptoms or signs of aosd .
the usefulness of serum ferritin is limited by the fact that elevated levels can also be seen in other diseases , such as infiltrative diseases ( hemochromatosis , gaucher 's disease ) , infections ( sepsis , hiv ) , malignancies ( leukemia , lymphomas ) , and in the macrophage activation syndrome [ 62 ] .
table 1 illustrates all the diseases where ferritin levels increase or decrease , whereas table 3 provides a summary of the studies of autoimmune diseases where ferritin is increased .
furthermore , there are several well - documented reports of aosd without increase in ferritin levels , hinting on possible different underlying mechanisms [ 37 ] .
interestingly , serum ferritin levels often correlate with disease activity and can normalize when the disease goes into remission [ 47 , 49 , 63 ] .
ferritin is known to release free fe2 + ions , which catalyze the reaction leading to the formation of free oh - 1 radicals , although it can also chelate these free fe2 + ions , thereby limiting the deleterious effects of oxidative stress [ 64 , 65 ] .
the unresolved question is whether ferritin acts as a buffer to minimize the pathogenic effects of free radicals or is it the one to cause the release of them .
3.5 .
ferritin glycosylation in aosd in healthy individuals , 50 - 80 % of ferritin is glycosylated and the attachment of glucose molecules at the surface of the ferritin molecule may provide protection against proteolytic enzymes .
there have been several studies which point to the fact that aosd patients have low glycosylation levels (< 20 %) [ 37 , 40 ] .
abnormally , low levels of ferritin glycosylation were shown to be a more specific , albeit less sensitive , diagnostic test for aosd .
unfortunately , this test is not readily available in clinical practice , hence limiting its usefulness .
moreover , ferritin glucosylation remains low both during active state and in remission , unlike serum ferritin levels [ 40 ] .
the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the decrease in glycosylation are poorly defined .
a probably theory could be that , due to excess of ferritin , the glycosylation process could be saturated .
in addition to saturation of glycosylation mechanisms , abnormalities that are more specific of aosd have been suggested , particularly decreased clearance of nonglycosylated proteins by the histiocyte - macrophage system .
the defect in ferritin glycosylation , although more specific for the diagnosis of aosd than serum ferritin , is by no means pathognomonic for the disease and has several limitations .
individual patients can have normal levels of glycosylation and low glycosylation levels can be seen in other inflammatory disorders and in a few patients with infectious diseases [ 37 ] .
glycosylated ferritin cannot be used to monitor disease activity or response to treatment , as it remains low for many months after the disease goes into remission [ 40 ] .
glycosylated ferritin (< 20 %) has a sensitivity of 78 % and specificity of 64 % .
when glycosylated ferritin levels are combined with a fivefold serum rise in ferritin , the sensitivity fell to 43 % and specificity rose to 93 % [ 37 ] .
therefore , the combined use of both parameters has been suggested and included in the fautrel et al. criteria .
3.6 .
ferritin association with atherosclerosis aosd is one of the diseases under the banner of autoinflammatory diseases , a new disease category where atherosclerosis has been suggested as a possible member .
ferritin has also been implicated in the pathogenesis a number of diseases ( table 2 ) .
it has been described more clearly and significantly in atherosclerosis [ 17 , 29 , 66 - 68 ] .
epidemiological studies have linked elevated serum ferritin levels with an increased risk for coronary artery disease ( cad ) and myocardial infarction ( mi ) [ 63 ] .
this finding led to the " iron hypothesis " which suggested a link between abnormal iron storage and atherosclerosis .
furthermore , the hemochromatosis gene ( hfe ) , c282y , has been associated with an increased risk of cad and cardiovascular mortality [ 69 , 70 ] .
there is an ongoing debate whether ferritin acts as a prooxidant , releasing free iron that was previously bound to it , or antioxidant , sequestering excess unbound iron .
excessive iron in tissues can catalyze the formation of oxygen - free radicals that can lead to low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) oxidation , a trigger for the development of atherosclerosis .
3.7 .
mutated ferritin theory during infection or inflammation , iron is sequestered in the ferritin contained inside macrophages , and , as a result , serum iron decreases .
this artificial " iron deficiency ," which in reality is scarcity in the midst of plenty , is thought to be protective for the host , depriving invading microorganisms from much needed iron [ 71 ] .
some research suggested that iron release is defective due to the hyperferritinemia in aosd [ 72 , 73 ] .
reports of iron supplementation successfully treating systemic - onset juvenile chronic arthritis [ 74 ] prompted the performance of iron studies on aosd patients , showing iron deficiency , and suggested that low - dose intravenous iron supplementation could be effective in aosd patients with anemia [ 48 , 74 , 75 ] .
the investigators suggested that intravenous iron could by - pass macrophage trapping and become directly available for erythropoiesis .
this strategy could prove to be effective in anemic aosd patients who often have normal or increased iron stores .
despite the massive amounts of circulating ferritin , its saturation with iron molecules since aosd is not associated with iron overload [ 40 , 76 , 77 ] .
this has also been proven with the use of automated analyzers that measure the transferring receptors in the serum [ 78 ] .
moreover , since the serum - transferring receptor concentration is not altered in inflammatory states , it may be a more useful test than serum ferritin in assessing the iron stores in aosd [ 79 ] .
the defective release of iron from ferritin could be secondary to the presence of a mutant form of ferritin , which could also explain the defect in ferritin glucosylation seen in aosd .
4. conclusion very high and often extreme serum ferritin levels have been described in aosd for more than 2 decades now .
while widely thought to be an acute phase reactant , ferritin could be intimately involved in the disease pathogenesis as an oxygen radical donor or scavenger or via a yet to be defined mechanism , possibly including mutated ferritin .
further research is warranted to bridge the knowledge gap and identify the missing links .
conflict of interests the authors have no conflict of interests .

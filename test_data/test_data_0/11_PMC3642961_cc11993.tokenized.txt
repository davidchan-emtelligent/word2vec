the surviving sepsis campaign recommends a first 6 hours resuscitative bundle to improve patient outcome .
despite this , the bundle is poorly performed because of several organizational and cultural barriers .
in recognition of this , we guess that an educational and organizational intervention out of the icus could impact on septic patient outcome .
in order to test our hypothesis we carried out , in 12 hospitals , a pre - intervention survey of the human and organizational resources ( hor ) available in the management of septic patients .
the aim is to seek any barrier potentially affecting correct guidelines implementation .
methods thirty - nine medical wards ( mw ) and 12 emergency departments ( ed ) were enrolled .
every unit was asked to fill in a pre - agreed hor checklist focused on the main requirements suggested by the guidelines .
results analysing the human resources available , we see that the bed - to - doctor ratio significantly ( p < 0.01 ) increases from the day to the night shift : from 6 to 43 beds per doctor on the mw ( median ) .
otherwise , the ed staff remains roughly the same : from 3.5 to 2.5 doctors on duty ( median ) .
the analysis of the organizational tools ( table 1 ) points out a low percentage of hospitals having : a diagnostic and therapeutic protocol for sepsis management ( 8.3 %) , some hospital empirical antibiotic therapy guidelines ( 0 %) and an infective source eradication protocol ( 8.3 %) .
moreover , just 25 % of hospitals involve an infectious diseases expert in every case of severe sepsis or septic shock .

only a comparison between these results and data collected from a clinical checklist , focused on sepsis bundle compliance , and from a patient 's outcome summary could confirm our hypothesis .
this is the aim for our next part of the study .

increasing crop yield and water use efficiency ( wue ) in dryland farming requires a quantitative understanding of relationships between crop yield and the water balance over many years .
here , we report on a long - term dryland monitoring site at the loess plateau , shanxi , china , where winter wheat was grown for 30 consecutive years and soil water content ( 0 - 200 cm ) was measured every 10 days .
the monitoring data were used to calibrate the aquacrop model and then to analyse the components of the water balance .
there was a strong positive relationship between total available water and mean cereal yield .
however , only one - third of the available water was actually used by the winter wheat for crop transpiration .
the remaining two - thirds were lost by soil evaporation , of which 40 and 60 % was lost during the growing and fallow seasons , respectively .
wheat yields ranged from 0.6 to 3.9 ton / ha and wue from 0.3 to 0.9 kg / m3 .
results of model experiments suggest that minimizing soil evaporation via straw mulch or plastic film covers could potentially double wheat yields and wue .
we conclude that the relatively low wheat yields and low wue were mainly related to ( i ) limited rainfall , ( ii ) low soil water storage during fallow season due to large soil evaporation , and ( iii ) poor synchronisation of the wheat growing season to the rain season .
the model experiments suggest significant potential for increased yields and wue .

introduction water scarcity is a growing global concern [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] .
for rainfed agriculture , this pressure may become more severe under climate change due to the expected more erratic rainfall and longer dry spells [ 5 ] - [ 8 ] .
currently , rainfed agriculture covers 80 % of the world 's cultivated land and accounts for 60 % of crop production [ 9 ] .
however , crop yield and water use efficiency ( wue ) are often low in rainfed agriculture , especially in arid and semi - arid areas due to , for example , degraded soils , erratic rainfall and poor water management [ 10 ] .
many of these areas in africa and asia face also rapid population growth .
hence , there is a pressing need to increase crop yields and wue in rainfed agriculture [ 11 ] - [ 15 ] .
water use efficiency is commonly defined as crop yield over evapotranspiration ( et ) , where et is the sum of soil evaporation ( e ) and crop transpiration ( t ) [ 16 ] - [ 19 ] .
the latter ( t ) is a direct consequence of crop production , while e is ' unproductive ' water loss .
the central question for rainfed agriculture in arid and semi - arid regions is ' how to transform unproductive water loss ( e ) into productive water use ( t )' .
unfortunately , the partitioning between e and t is often not well - known , due to difficulties and high cost in distinguishing e and t in the field .
as a result , water use of crops is commonly reported as evapotranspiration ( et ) [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 20 ] .
this lack of information makes it difficult to assess how much of the evaporative water loss can be used for increasing yields by appropriate measures .
crop growth simulation models have the potential of providing more comprehensive insights into the functioning of soil - crop systems , and can be helpful to explore options for increasing yield and wue [ 21 ] - [ 23 ] .
these models though are simplified representations of parts of reality and therefore require testing in the real world .
fortunately , numerous field studies have examined the effect of water availability , with or without irrigation treatments , on crop yield and wue [ 16 ] - [ 20 ] .
in principle , these results can be used to calibrate and test the crop growth simulation models .
however , most of these field studies are short - term ( 2 - 5 years ) and focus on the growing season only , largely ignoring the water balance during the fallow season .
furthermore , crop yields and wue show large variations due to differences in soils , climate conditions and crop husbandry practices .
for example , in the north china plain , annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 650 mm and wheat grain yields roughly range from 1 to 3 ton / ha / year under rainfed conditions. with 200 to 300 mm of irrigation , grain yield can be increased by 60 to 100 % and wue can be increased by 20 to 40 % [ 16 ] .
globally , wue of wheat shows even larger variation ranging from approximately 0.2 to 1.8 kg / m3 [ 24 ] .
evidently , this wide range suggests considerable scope for improvement , but the underlying causes of wue is not always well - known and irrigation water is not available on most places .
the study reported here has the objectives ( i ) to calibrate a water - driven crop growth model on the basis of monitoring data from a long - term field experiment with rainfed winter wheat , ( ii ) to analyse the components of the water balance of this field , and ( iii ) to explore the potential for increasing crop yield and wue through model experiments .
the field experiment was situated in the dryland of the loess plateau , shanxi , china .
winter wheat was grown for 30 consecutive years and soil water content ( 0 - 200 cm ) was measured every 10 days .
the fao aquacrop model was chosen as simulation model because it is a water - driven crop growth model that can separately calculate e and t , and simulates the final crop yield as function of water use [ 23 ] , [ 25 ] .
the aquacrop model uses canopy ground cover as the basis to calculate t and to separate e and t. crop yield is then calculated as the product of biomass and harvest index ( hi ) .
the principles and modules of the aquacrop model are well - documented in a series of aquacrop publications [ 23 ] , [ 25 ] - [ 28 ] .
compared to some other crop growth models , aquacrop requires relatively few input parameters [ 23 ] , [ 28 ] .
such a limited number of input parameters facilitates model calibration and utilization for different crops and under different management strategies [ 23 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 29 ] - [ 36 ] .
materials and methods site information the long - term monitoring site is located in beizhang , linyi county in shanxi province on the loess plateau ( 35degrees 9 ' 3.83 '' n , 110degrees 34 ' 25.40 '' e , altitude : 491 m ) in china .

we have the permission to conduct the study on this site .
we confirm that the field studies did not involve endangered or protected species .
the site has a semi - arid climate with extensive monsoonal influence , which is dry and cold in winter , rainy and hot in summer .
rainfall in june to september accounts for more than 70 % of annual rainfall .
average annual rainfall was 517 mm in the period of 1980 - 2010 with large annual variations , from a minimum of 331 mm to a maximum of 832 mm. mean annual sunshine duration is 2270 h , annual average temperature 13.5degreesc and mean annual potential evaporation is 1340 mm. the soil is a typical loessial soils ( calcic luvisols ) of the loess plateau [ 37 ] - [ 40 ] .
soil slope is < 1 % and soil texture is silt loam , with a small proportion of clay .
the soil was rather homogeneous in texture and key physical properties ( table 1 ) .
maximum soil water holding capacity was a significant fraction of the total annual rainfall ( table 2 ) .

experimental design and measurements the long - term crop yield and soil moisture monitoring experiment started in 1980 .
there were no experimental treatments .
the size of the field is 0.5 ha. winter wheat was planted each year between 25 september and 5 october , depending on the actual climate and soil water conditions .
sowing rate was 150 kg seed / ha. the growing period of the winter wheat is approximately 245 days ( from 1 october to 1 june of the next year ) .
the fallow season is about 120 days ( from 2nd june to 30th september ) ( figure 1 ) .
local bred cultivars ( jinmai ) were used for all years .
information about crop parameters is listed in table 3 .
fertilizers were applied at planting at a rate of 127.5 kg / ha of n as urea and 90 kg / ha of p2o5 as superphosphate , for all years .
at harvest , grain yields were measured in 5 random plots ( 2 m2 per plot ) selected from two diagonal lines of the field .
dry matter content of grain and straw was measured at the laboratory after drying at 70degreesc .
soil water contents were measured in 16 different layers up to 2 m depth every 10 days by using the gravity method .
the top 10 cm was sampled in 5 cm intervals. from 0.1 to 1 m , samples were taken at 10 cm intervals , and from 1 to 2 m at 20 cm intervals ( figure 2 ) .
each sample consisted of 5 subsamples , taken randomly on two diagonal lines across the field .

the water balance for both fallow and crop growing seasons reads as follows : ( 1 ) where r is rainfall , i is irrigation , deltas is the change of soil water content , e is soil evaporation , t is crop transpiration , rr is runoff and pe is percolation .
all units are presented in mm or in m3 / ha. irrigation was not applied in this study .
furthermore , runoff and percolation ( leaching ) were small and disregarded .
hence , the water balance of the fallow seasons was simplified to : ( 2 ) the water balance of the growing season was simplified to : ( 3 ) we used formula ( 2 ) and the recorded rainfall and soil water content data to calculate evaporation during the fallow season and formula ( 3 ) to calculate et during the growing season .
the partitioning of e and t was done by the aquacrop model .
water use efficiency ( wue , kg / m3 ) was calculated as : ( 4 ) where et is evapotranspiration ( mm ) , the sum of e and t during the growing season .
calibration and validation of the aquacrop model the fao aquacrop model is a water - driven crop growth model for the simulation of crop biomass and yield as function of water availability [ 23 ] , [ 25 ] .
aquacrop requires 4 main sets of input data , i.e. climate data ( rainfall , minimum and maximum temperature and reference evapotranspiration ( eto )) , crop parameters , soil data and field management data .
climate data were collected from a near - by meteorological station ( linyi station , 35degrees 10 ' 7.02 '' n , 110degrees 46 ' 44.59 '' e , altitude : 441 m ) , which is 25 km away from the experimental field .
eto was calculated by fao penman - monteith equation as described in allen et al .
[ 42 ] .
soil data ( tables 1 and 2 ) and field management data were derived from measurements and from recordings at the monitoring site .
crop data and parameters were derived from measurements , literature [ 23 ] , [ 25 ] - [ 27 ] and by calibration ( table 3 ) .
the objective of calibration and validation was to achieve the best match between simulated outputs and monitoring data ( soil moisture and crop yield ) for all 30 years , using a common procedure [ 27 ] , [ 29 ] - [ 36 ] .
we randomly selected 15 years' data from the monitoring field for calibration and used the other 15 years' data for validation of the calibrated model .
in the calibration step , we used the year - specific climate , soil and initial soil water data as fixed input data .
then we adjusted some of the crop parameters ( see table 3 ) , based on our understanding of crop growth , development and crop responses to water deficits , until the differences between simulated output and monitoring data were minimal .
we repeated this process for all selected 15 years and ultimately obtained a satisfactorily index of agreement ( d = 0.92 ) .
then , the calibrated model was validated with the other 15 years' data , and again obtained an acceptable index of agreement ( d = 0.93 ) .
data analysis the root mean square error ( rmse ) [ 43 ] has been widely used to evaluate the performance of a model [ 30 ] , [ 44 ] - [ 47 ] .
however , willmott and matsuura [ 44 ] pointed out that , compared to rmse , the mean absolute error ( mae ) is a better indicator and therefore the evaluation of model performance should be based on the mae .
in this study , we used the mae , the mean bias error ( mbe ) and the willmott index of agreement ( d ) to evaluate the model performance .
the mae measures the weighted average magnitude of the absolute errors and was calculated as follows : ( 5 ) where n is the number of observations , mi is the modelled yield or soil water content and oi is the observed yield or soil water content .
the mbe indicates whether the model is under or over predicting the observed values and also indicates the uniformity of error distribution .
positive mbe values indicate over prediction , negative values indicate under prediction and a value of zero indicates equal distribution between negative and positive values .
the mbe was calculated as follows : ( 6 ) the willmott index of agreement ( d ) [ 43 ] has values ranging from 0 to 1 .
a value close to 1 suggests a good model performance .
the agreement index d was calculated as follows : ( 7 ) where is the average value of the observed yield or soil water content .
model experiments to investigate the potentials of minimizing soil evaporation so as to increase crop yield and wue , we set up six model experiments as follows : experiment 1 ( e1 ) : reference a ; winter wheat was planted at 50 % of field capacity ( fc ) ( low soil water content ) experiment 2 ( e2 ) : e1 + organic mulch ( straw ) experiment 3 ( e3 ) : e1 + plastic film cover experiment 4 ( e4 ) : reference b ; winter wheat was planted at 70 % of fc ( high soil water content ) experiment 5 ( e5 ) : e4 + organic mulch ( straw ) experiment 6 ( e6 ) : e4 + plastic film cover in the model experiments , we used e1 and e4 as references to simulate crop growth under relatively low ( with 50 % fc ) and high ( with 70 % fc ) soil water content at winter wheat seeding ( table 2 ) .
the range from 50 to 70 % fc largely represented the initial soil water content for the planting period .
the low value is representative for no water harvesting , and the high values is representative for water harvesting during the fallow period via mulching and / or covers .
model experiments e2 and e5 aimed at testing the effects of organic mulch during the growing season , and experiments e3 and e6 aimed at testing the effects of plastic film during the growing season on crop yield and water balance .
the effectiveness of the soil evaporation reduction by organic mulch and plastic film cover during the growing season were estimated at 50 and 90 % , respectively , which are default values of the aquacrop model [ 25 ] .
however , since plastic film will cover only about 80 % of the wheat planted field , the overall soil evaporation reduction by plastic film was set at 72 % .
in practice , the plastic film covers are used for the growing season only and destroyed or removed after harvesting the crops .
we ran these six experiments for the period of 1980 - 2010 .
results patterns of monthly rainfall and soil water content most of the rainfall occurs in the summer from june to september , accounting for more than 70 % of the total annual rainfall while winter wheat was seeded in the end of september or beginning of october , and harvested in the end of may or beginning of june .
hence , most of the rain fell when wheat had matured already , i.e. , during the fallow period .
therefore , the growing season of winter wheat was poorly synchronized to the rain season .
on the other hand , due to concentrated rainfall in june to september , mean soil water content in the upper two metre was highest in october when winter wheat was seeded .
thereafter , the soil water content gradually decreased , due to soil evaporation and crop transpiration .
mean soil water content was lowest in june , at the beginning of the rain season when the winter wheat was harvested ( figure 1 ) .
the changes of the soil water content ( for 16 layers in the upper 2 meter of the soil ) during the fallow and growing seasons are shown in figure 2 .
the changes in water content in the fallow season mirror the changes during the growing season , i.e. water stored in the soil during the fallow season largely equalled to soil water depletion during the growing season .
the soil water changes for fallow season were calculated as the soil water content of october deducted by that of june .
similarly , the soil water changes for growing season were calculated as the soil water content of june deducted by that of october in the previous year .
soil water content mostly changed in the top 1 m , accounting for 70 % of total soil water change (+/ - 120 mm ) ( figure 2 ) .
we cannot exclude that some of the seasonal variations are caused by slight spatial variations in soil characteristics .
model calibration and performance the aquacrop model was calibrated using the climate data , soil data , field management data and monitoring data .
the full set of crop parameters is listed in table 3 .
the performance of the model on the simulated crop yield and soil water balance is shown in figure 3 .
the relationship between observed and modelled grain yield of the calibrated model for the second set of 15 - years data ( validation step ) was almost as good as for the whole set of data ( not shown ) .
for the 30 years' data , the relationship between observed and modelled grain yield had a correlation coefficient of ( r2 ) of 0.77 , and the index of agreement ( d ) was 0.93 ( figure 3a ) .
similarly , the relationship between observed and modelled soil water content showed a r2 of 0.78 and an index of agreement ( d ) of 0.93 ( figure 3b ) .
mean absolute errors ( mae ) were 311 kg / ha and 25 mm , respectively .
mean bias errors ( mbe ) were - 168 kg / ha and - 12 mm in simulating yields and soil water balance , respectively , suggesting that the model slightly underestimated grain yields and soil water contents by 8 and 9 % , respectively .
we conclude that the performance of the aquacrop model was acceptable for doing further simulations .

diagonal lines represent 1:1 lines .
water balance and partitioning of e and t aquacrop was used to estimate soil evaporation and crop transpiration , and the water balance for both fallow and growing seasons during the period 1980 - 2010 ( figure 4 ) .
there was only a very marginal change in soil water content when considering the water balance of the total season ( fallow + growing season ) over the 30 years' period ; total rainfall was nearly equal to the sum of soil evaporation and crop transpiration .
crop transpiration accounted for approximately one - third of total seasonal rainfall .
the remaining two - thirds were assumed to be lost by soil evaporation ( figure 4a ) , but we cannot exclude that a small fraction of this evaporative loss was actually lost by leaching and / or runoff .
mean rainfall in the fallow season was 323 mm , of which 207 mm ( 64 %) was lost by soil evaporation and 116 mm ( 36 %) was stored in the soil ( figure 4b ) .
during the growing season , mean crop transpiration was 185 mm ( 57 %) and soil evaporation was 137 mm ( 43 %) , of which rainfall and soil moisture contributed 194 ( 60 % ) and 128 mm ( 40 %) , respectively ( figure 4c ) .
mean rainfall of the growing season was slightly larger than mean crop transpiration .

total season means the sum of fallow season and growing season .
wheat yield and wue due to limited amounts of available water and the irregular rainfall pattern , wheat yield and wue were rather low , ranging from 0.6 to 3.9 ton / ha / year and from 0.3 to 0.9 kg / m3 , respectively .
relationships between yield and annual rainfall ( p = 0.028 ) , and between yield and growing season rainfall ( p = 0.027 ) were highly significant ( figures 5 ) .
the relationship between yield and rainfall during the fallow season was not significant ( p = 0.167 ) .
furthermore , there were significant linear relationships between wheat grain yield and et , t , and wue , with coefficients of determination ( r2 ) of 0.61 , 0.68 and 0.72 , respectively ( figure 5 ) .
given the slope ( 0.01 ) between yield and t , an increase of 1 mm available water can produce 10 kg grain per hectare .

the significant level is 0.028 for ( a ) , 0.167 for ( b ) , 0.027 for ( c ) .
for d , e and f , the significant level is all smaller than 0.01 .
model experiments in model experiment e1 ( winter wheat planted at 50 % of fc ) , mean wheat yield and wue were 2 ton / ha and 0.6 kg / m3 , respectively ( figure 6 ) .
in model experiment e2 , with organic mulch during the growing season , mean yield increased to 2.3 ton / ha and wue increased to 0.8 kg / m3 .
in model experiment e3 , with plastic film during the growing season , mean yield increased further to 2.5 ton / ha and wue to 1.0 kg / m3 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0078828.g006 figure 6 results of six model experiments ; effects of straw mulch and plastic film on wheat yield ( a ) and water use efficiency ( b ) .
experiment e1 : planting at 50 % of fc ; experiment e2 : e1 + organic mulch ; experiment e3 : e1 + plastic cover ; experiment e4 : planting at 70 % of fc ; experiment e5 : e4 + organic mulch ; experiment e6 : e4 + plastic cover .
similarly , in model experiment e4 ( winter wheat planted at 70 % of fc ) , mean yield and wue were 2.9 ton / ha and 0.8 kg / m3 , respectively. with organic mulch ( e5 ) , mean yield and wue increased to 3.2 ton / ha and 0.9 kg / m3 , and with plastic film cover ( e6 ) , mean yield and wue increased further to 3.5 ton / ha and 1.1 kg / m3 .
our model experiments show that both organic mulch and plastic film cover could significantly improve yield and wue , but the impact of plastic cover was bigger than the organic mulch mainly due to high effectiveness in reducing soil evaporation .
moreover , increasing water storage in the soil during the fallow season , so that available soil water content increases from 50 to 70 % of fc in autumn at the time of winter wheat seeding , is at least as effective as a plastic cover during the growing season .
discussion we successfully calibrated and validated the aquacrop model on the basis of the long - term monitoring data ( 30 years ) of rainfed winter wheat on the loess plateau of northern china .
the full set of crop parameters ( table 3 ) may provide also guidance to future studies and further model calibrations and validations .
we also quantified four key components of the water balance , i.e. , rainfall , changes in soil water , soil evaporation and crop transpiration , for both fallow and growing seasons by combining empirical data from a long - term wheat monitoring site with calculated results using the aquacrop model .
in the end , we also explored the potential for increasing wheat yield and wue through model experiments .
the relationship between observed and modelled wheat yield had a r2 of 0.77 , slope of 0.9 and an index of agreement ( d ) of 0.93 ( figure 3 ) .
mkhabela and bullock [ 47 ] reported a r2 of 0.66 , slope of 0.96 , index of agreement ( d ) of 0.99 between observed and modelled wheat yields .
araya et al .
[ 48 ] reported a r2 > 0.80 when simulating barley biomass and grain yield .
stricevic et al .
[ 49 ] reported a r2 > 0.84 when simulating yields of maize , sunflower and sugar beet .
similarly for simulating soil water content , we found a r2 of 0.78 , slope of 0.9 and an index of agreement ( d ) of 0.93 ( figure 3 ) .
mkhabela and bullock [ 47 ] reported a r2 of 0.9 and a slope of 0.9 for simulating soil water content .
hence , the performance of aquacrop for our dryland wheat field is largely comparable with that of other modelling studies .
water stress limited the crop yield at this site .
according to our model simulations , water stress has led to suboptimal yields in essentially all years , for both low and relatively high wheat yields .
for example , a very low grain yield ( 0.6 ton / ha ) was recorded in the year 2000 , when water stress for leaf expansion and stomatal closure started already at the 54th day after planting .
in contrast , water stress for leaf expansion and stomatal closure started to occur only from day 156 after planting in 2003 , when grain yield was 3.8 ton / ha. in both cases , water stress occurred before flowering stage (~ 200 days after planting ) .
water stress leads to low grain yield and low wue , but depending on the stage and duration of the water stress [ 17 ] , [ 50 ] .
we found significant linear relationships between wheat yield and et , and between wheat yield and t ( figure 5 ) , in line with some other studies [ 17 ] , [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] .
mean t / et ratio in our study was only 58 % during the growing season , which was 8 - 12 % lower than that reported by liu et al .
[ 53 ] and kang et al .
[ 54 ] but highly in line with that reported by wang et al .
[ 55 ] .
the higher t / et ratio in the studies of liu et al .
[ 53 ] and kang et al .
[ 54 ] was probably due to the irrigation treatments where the crop had more water for transpiration .
it is well - known that crop yield and wue are often lower in rainfed agriculture than in irrigated agriculture [ 17 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 50 ] , but depending also on possible nutrient , weed , and disease stresses and irrigation management .
advanced technologies , such as precision irrigation , are for a long time available but unfortunately not affordable and applicable to the farmers of the loess plateau , mainly because of the high cost relative to the low value of cereals [ 56 ] .
therefore , we focused on low - cost options , such as straw mulch and plastic film cover because those are the most accessible and low cost materials for farmers to implement in the field .
minimizing soil evaporation could save water for crop transpiration , and thereby increase wheat yield and wue .
our model experiments suggest that wheat yield can be improved significantly by minimizing soil evaporation via organic mulch and plastic film cover , especially also during the fallow period .
mulching with crop residues can decrease soil evaporation and increase soil water retention .
plastic film cover can significantly increase crop yield and wue , and promote crop growth during early growth when temperature is low .
our results show that crop yields can be increased by ~ 0.9 ton / ha through increasing soil water storage during the fallow period .
crop yields can be increased further by on average ~ 0.3 ton / ha through straw mulch and by ~ 0.5 ton / ha on through plastic film covers during the growing season .
at the same time , wue increases on average by 0.2 to 0.6 kg / m3 .
these results are in line with results reported by deng et al .
[ 57 ] and others [ 58 ] - [ 60 ] .
evidently , increased rainwater harvesting during the fallow season is an effective option .
straw mulch significantly reduces the evaporative water losses during the fallow season and is conducive to the infiltration of rain water in the soil .
plastic film covers are less applicable during the fallow season , because they may limit the infiltration of rain water and thereby increase runoff .
reduced tillage can also improve soil water storage .
according to a recent study of hou et al .
[ 61 ] , rotational tillage ( rotation of no - tillage and subsoiling ) could significantly increase soil water storage during the summer fallow and wheat growing season compared with conventional tillage .
they found that rotational tillage increased wheat yields by 10 % , and wue by 7.5 % , respectively .
conclusions low wheat yield at the monitoring site was largely due to ( i ) limited rainfall , ( ii ) low soil water storage during fallow season because of high water loss via soil evaporation , and ( iii ) the poor synchronisation of the wheat growing season to the rainfall distribution season .
although water was limited , on average only one - third of the total available water was actually used by the crop for transpiration .
the remaining two - thirds was lost by soil evaporation , 60 % during the fallow season and 40 % during the growing season .
our model experiments suggest that minimizing soil evaporation via organic mulch or plastic film covers can significantly increase wheat yield and wue .
more importantly , these increases can be realized by the application of relatively low cost measures .
further studies are needed to test the effectiveness of these measures in the field .

the androgen receptor ( ar ) is a nuclear receptor that is expressed in growing follicles and involved in folliculogenesis and follicle growth .
the orphan nuclear receptor , nur77 , also has an important role in steroid signaling and follicle maturation .
we hypothesized that ar levels and androgen signaling through ar are regulated by nur77 in the ovary .
in the ovaries of nur77 knockout mice ( n = 5 ) , real - time pcr results showed that the mrna levels of ar and an androgen signaling target gene , kitl , were decreased by 35 % and 24 % , respectively , relative to wild - type mice ( n = 5 ) , which suggested transcriptional regulation of ar by nur77 in vivo .
in cultured mouse granulosa cells and a steroidogenic human ovarian granulosa - like tumor cell line , kgn , mrna and protein expression levels of ar were increased by overexpressing nur77 but decreased by knocking down endogenous nur77 .
consistent with increased ar expression , chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that nur77 bound to the ngfi - b response element ( nbre ) in the ar promoter sequence .
ar promoter activity was stimulated by nur77 in hek293t cells and attenuated in nur77 knockout mouse granulosa cells ( luciferase assay ) .
overexpression of nur77 enhanced the androgenic induction of kitl ( 200 nm ; 48h ) , while knockout of nur77 attenuated this induction .
these results demonstrate that ar is regulated by nur77 in the ovaries , and they suggest that the participation of nur77 in androgen signaling may be essential for normal follicular development .
introduction recently , the study of female reproductive physiology has been focused on the genesis and development of ovarian follicles .
follicular development and function are controlled by a plethora of intrinsic and endocrine factors , and are affected by interactions between multiple cell types within the ovaries [ 1 ] .
the nur77 [ nerve growth factor induced - b ( ngfi - b ) , nuclear receptor 4a1 ( nr4a1 )] orphan nuclear receptor is a transcription factor that activates target genes [ 2 ] .
nur77 has been shown to recognize a specific binding site called the ngfi - b response element ( nbre ; aaaggtca ) , which is present in a subset of genes [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , and nur77 has been shown to have an effect on transcriptional activation .
nur77 is predominantly expressed in theca cells and granulosa cells of ovarian follicles [ 5 ] .
nur77 has a variety of functions , including promoting expression of genes involved in the endocrine , nerve , and immune systems [ 6 ] .
in the endocrine system , nur77 has been shown to participate in the regulation of the following genes related to the production of steroidogenic enzymes : pomc [ 7 ] and cyp17a1 [ 8 ] in rats ; star [ 9 ] and cyp21a1 [ 3 ] in mice ; and crh [ 10 ] and hsd3b2 [ 11 ] in humans .
the androgenic steroid hormones are mostly produced by the adrenal glands and gonads of both sexes .
although androgens are present at much lower concentrations in the circulation of females relative to males , they are essential in maintaining female physiological functions , especially intraovarian functions , such as stimulating follicular growth on early stages [ 12 ] , enhancing granulosa cell apoptosis [ 13 ] , and regulating the function and lifespan of the corpus luteum [ 14 ] .
androgen signal transduction requires the androgen receptor ( ar ) , which is a member of the nuclear receptor family that has been found to be expressed in growing follicles [ 15 ] .
in an ar - deficient mouse model , there is an age - dependent progression in ovarian abnormality with a premature ovary failure ( pof ) phenotype that includes lower follicle numbers , impaired mammary development , fewer pups per litter , and a marked increase of atretic follicles , which indicates that ar - mediated androgen signaling is indispensable for the maintenance of folliculogenesis , and that impaired androgen signaling is a potential cause of the pof syndrome [ 16 ] .
nevertheless , the direct involvement of androgen and ar in ovarian follicles is still not well - known .
nur77 and ar are both involved in follicle maturation .
nur77 is expressed in corpora lutea and cultured ovarian granulosa cells , and it activates steroidogenic gene expression during luteinization , thus , indicating a functional relevance to stage - specific expression during follicular maturation [ 6 ] .
ar is expressed in all cell types of an ovarian follicle , including oocytes , granulosa cells , and theca cells [ 17 ] .
androgen is capable of triggering oocyte maturation in xenopus laevis [ 18 ] , mouse [ 19 ] , and pig [ 20 ] most likely via the classical ar mechanism .
in cultured granulosa cells or follicles of various species in vitro , ar mediates the stimulatory effects of androgen on proliferation and follicular development [ 12 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] .
however , the mechanism of ar regulation is unknown .
therefore , this study aimed at investigating a novel role for nur77 in ar regulation by testing the hypothesis that ar expression and signaling are affected by nur77 .
the mrna expression patterns of ar and kitl in the ovaries were examined in nur77 knockout and wild - type mice to determine the regulation of ar by nur77 in vivo .
the mrna and protein levels of ar and kitl were analyzed in cultured mouse granulosa cells and a steroidogenic human ovarian granulosa - like tumor cell line , kgn , after overexpression and knockdown of nur77 in vitro .
the interactions between ar and nur77 were also studied using chromatin immunoprecipitation and ar promoter activity .
moreover , we showed that nur77 regulated kitl expression through stimulation or inhibition of ar signaling using androgen or antiandrogen flutamide , thus , demonstrating an important interaction between nur77 and androgen signaling in the ovaries .

results ar and kitl mrna levels decrease in nur77 - / - mice ovaries to determine if ar and kitl in the ovaries were regulated by nur77 in vivo , ar and kitl mrna expression levels were analyzed with real - time pcr in the ovaries from nur77 +/+ and nur77 - / - 20 - week - old female mice .
in comparison with nur77 +/+ ovaries , the expression levels of ar mrna ( figure 1a ) and kitl mrna ( figure 1b ) were decreased by 35 % and 24 % , respectively , in nur77 - / - ovaries ( figure 1c ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0039950.g001 figure 1 ar and kitl mrna levels decreased in nur77 - / - mouse ovaries .
rna was collected from 20 - week - old nur77 +/+ and nur77 - / - female mouse ovaries and reverse transcribed for real - time pcr .
ar ( a ) , kitl ( b ) and nur77 ( c ) mrna levels of nur77 - / - mouse ovaries ( n = 5 ) versus nur77 +/+ mouse ovaries ( n = 5 ) were measured and expressed as relative quantities (* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 ) .
nur77 increases ar and kitl expression in mouse primary granulosa cells to investigate the functional role of nur77 in the regulation of ar and kitl expression in mgcs , we used adenoviral technology to alter the endogenous nur77 protein expression in nur77 +/+ mgcs at an moi of 0 , 5 and 10 for 48 h , and we collected rna for real - time pcr analysis and protein for western blot analysis .
we found that adenovirus - mediated overexpression of nur77 in nur77 +/+ mgcs increased both ar mrna and protein expression levels ( figure 2a , b ) in a concentration - dependent manner .
moreover , as shown in figure 2a , kitl mrna expression was significantly increased by approximately 6.0 - fold when nur77 was overexpressed at an moi of 10 in nur77 +/+ mgcs .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0039950.g002 figure 2 effects of nur77 overexpression and knockout on mouse ar and kitl expression .
a : nur77 +/+ mgcs were infected with ad - lacz or ad - flag - nur77 at the indicated moi for 48 h. ar and kitl mrna levels were measured by real - time pcr and shown as a ratio over control ( ad - lacz ) .
b : ar protein levels were measured by western blot analysis .
c : real - time pcr analysis of ar and kitl mrna expression in nur77 +/+ and nur77 - / - mgcs from 3 - week - old mice .
d : western blot analysis of ar protein expression in nur77 +/+ and nur77 - / - mgcs from 3 - week - old mice .
the results are an average of three independent experiments performed in triplicate (* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 ) .
to further confirm the regulatory effect of nur77 on ar and kitl expression in vivo , we isolated mgcs from nur77 +/+ and nur77 - / - female mouse ovaries .
as expected , both ar and kitl mrna expression levels were significantly decreased in nur77 - / - mgcs as compared to wild - type mgcs ( figure 2c ) .
furthermore , ar protein expression decreased ( figure 2d ) in purified mgcs from nur77 - / - female mouse ovaries .
together , these findings strongly suggested that nur77 is involved in the regulation of ar and kitl expression in mouse ovary granulosa cells .
nur77 binds to the mouse ar promoter and stimulates its activity nur77 has been reported to regulate target gene expression through direct binding to the nbre sequence ( aaaggtca ) as monomers ( 4 ) and / or to the palindromic nurbe sequence as homodimers ( 7 ) .
based on the mouse ar promoter sequence deposited in the transcriptional regulatory element database ( accession no .
83828 ) , we found a potential nbre ( tcaggtca ) within mar promoter core regions .
to examine if nur77 can bind to the ar promoter in vivo , we performed a chip - pcr assay .
confluent mgcs were infected with ad - lacz and ad - flag - nur77 at an moi of 10 for 48 h. soluble chromatin from the mgcs was then immunoprecipitated with an anti - flag m2 affinity agarose gel , and the purified dna fragments from the flag - nur77 - chromatin complexes were analyzed by pcr with the specific primer pairs designed for the nbre region of the mar promoter .
figure 3a showed that the ar promoter was efficiently recovered from the flag - nur77 immunoprecipitates but not from the control immunoprecipitates ( ad - lacz ) , suggesting that nur77 directly binds to the chromatin - associated ar promoter in mouse granulosa cells .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0039950.g003 figure 3 nur77 binds to the mouse ar promoter and stimulates its activity .
a : the results of chip - pcr amplification are shown using primers against the mouse ar promoter region .
pcr products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis .
b : hek293t cells were transfected with pcmv - nur77 or pcmv - empty vector plasmid and cotransfected with the mar promoter - luciferase construct using the nanofectin transfection reagent .
after 48 h , luciferase assays were performed and normalized by constitutive renilla luciferase .
c : mgcs from nur77 +/+ , nur77 +/ - and nur77 - / - mice were transfected with mar promoter - luciferase construct using lipofectamine 2000 reagent .
after 48 h , luciferase assays were performed and normalized by constitutive renilla luciferase ( n = 3 ; * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 ) .
to test if nurr77 directly regulates mar promoter activity , we measured ar gene promoter activity in hek293t cells and mgcs by transient transfection and luciferase reporter assays .
as shown in figure 3b , overexpression of nur77 in hek293t cells enhanced mar promoter activity in a concentration - dependent manner .
in mgcs from nur77 - / - mice , however , the mar promoter activity was significantly lower than that in mgcs from nur77 +/+ mice ( figure 3c ) .
together , these data suggested that nur77 binds to the mar promoter and increases ar promoter activity .
nur77 up - regulates ar and kitlg expression levels in human granulosa cells to assess if nur77 also regulates the transcription of the human ar gene , we treated kgn cells , a human granulosa - like tumor cell line , with ad - flag - nur77 at the indicated moi for 48 h. using real - time pcr analysis , we found that mrna levels of har and hkitlg were dramatically elevated in a dose - dependent manner with increasing expression levels of nur77 ( figure 4a ) .
moreover , western blot analysis indicated an increase in ar protein levels an increase in figure 4b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0039950.g004 figure 4 effects of nur77 overexpression and silencing on human ar and kitlg expression in kgn cells .
a : kgn cells were infected with ad - lacz or ad - flag - nur77 at the indicated moi for 48 h , and ar and kitlg mrna levels were measured by real - time pcr and shown as a ratio over control ( ad - lacz ) .
( n = 3 ; * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 ) .
b : western blot analysis of ar protein expression in kgn cells treated with ad - lacz or ad - flag - nur77 at the indicted moi for 48 h. a : real - time pcr analysis of ar and kitlg mrna expression levels in kgn cells infected with ad - lacz or ad - sinur77 ( moi = 50 and 100 ) for 48 h ( n = 3 ; * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 ) .
b : western blot analysis of ar protein expression in kgn cells treated with ad - lacz or ad - sinur77 at the indicated moi for 48h .
to further support the role of nur77 in modulating har expression , we performed loss of function studies using an rna interference technique .
kgn cells were infected with ad - sinur77 at mois of 0 , 50 or 100 , and total rna and protein were measured by real - time pcr and western blot analysis , respectively .
as expected , ad - sinur77 - infected cells showed a substantial reduction in endogenous nur77 mrna expression .
the treatment subsequently inhibited ar and kitlg mrna expression levels .
ar mrna was down - regulated by the inhibition of endogenous nur77 to 54 % , and kitlg expression was repressed to 42 % ( figure 4c ) .
ar protein expression was also attenuated accompanied by repression of nur77 ( figure 4d ) .
thus , these results suggest that nur77 promotes har expression in kgn cells .
nur77 binds to the human ar promoter and enhances its activity in addition , as the har promoter sequence has consensus aaaggtca binding sites located at - 2429 to - 2422 relative to the start site of ar transcription ( transcriptional regulatory element database ; accession no .
43390 ) , we first conducted a chip - pcr assay as described in mgcs above , and similar results were obtained ( figure 5a ) .
we also used quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation to further determine if nur77 binds to the conservative nbre within the har promoter core region in vivo .
for these studies , cell lysates were sonicated to generate ~ 200bp chromatin fragments prior to immunoprecipitation with an antibody to nur77 or irrelevant control antibody .
co - precipitating chromatin was amplified by real - time pcr using primers spanning the putative nur77 - binding site ( - 2429 to - 2422bp ) .
primers used in these experiments were designed to generate a product of < 200bp .
it was found that chromatin fragments with potential nbre , instead of negative control region , specifically co - precipitated with nur77 from lysates of kgn cells ( figure 5b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0039950.g005 figure 5 nur77 binds to the human ar promoter and enhances its activity .
a : the results of chip - pcr amplification are shown using primers against the human ar promoter region .

results were normalized to total input ( not precipitated ) chromatin ( n = 3 ; * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 ) .
c : abcd assays were performed using biotinylated or unbiotinylated ( competitor ) double - stranded ar wild - type ( wt ) and ar mutant ( mut ) oligonucleotides in addition to kgn cell extracts after infection with ad - lacz or ad - flag - nur77 .
d : hek293t cells were transfected with pcmv - nur77 or pcmv - empty vector and cotransfected with the har promoter - luciferase construct using the nanofectin transfection reagent .
forty - eight hours after transfection , luciferase assays were performed and normalized by constitutive renilla luciferase ( n = 3 ; * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 ) .
we next investigated if nur77 interacts with the human ar promoter in vitro .
abcd assays were performed using biotin conjugate , double - stranded oligonucleotides containing the sequences shown in figure 5c .
the whole cell lysates extracted from intact kgn cells infected with ad - flag - nur77 or ad - lacz at an moi of 10 were mixed with oligonucleotides and immobilized on streptavidin agarose beads .
nur77 strongly bound to the ar wild - type oligonucleotides but not to the mutant sequence ( figure 5c ) , thus , suggesting that this nbre site interacts with nur77 in a sequence - specific manner .
to further verify the direct transcriptional effect of nur77 on ar in kgn cells , we generated a construct corresponding to approximately 1.2 kb of the human ar promoter sequence ( - 2837 / - 1638 ) in a luciferase reporter plasmid and transiently transfected hek293t cells to measure ar gene promoter activity .
overexpression of nur77 activated har promoter activity in a concentration - dependent manner ( figure 5d ) .
these data demonstrated that the conserved nbre ( - 2429 to - 2422 ) is required for nur77 specific binding and functional activation of human ar promoter activity .
nur77 affects the expression of the androgen signaling target gene , kitl , by regulating ar in granulosa cells to investigate the mechanism of kitl gene regulation by nur77 and ar , kgn cells infected with ad - lacz or ad - flag - nur77 at an moi of 10 and mgcs isolated from nur77 +/+ and nur77 - / - female mouse ovaries were treated with androstenedione ( ad ) or an androgen signaling antagonist , flutamide ( fl ) .
real - time pcr analysis showed that kitl expression was elevated by ad in kgn cells , which is consistent with a previous report [ 16 ] .
fl treatments , however , markly attenuated kitl expression in kgn and nur77 +/+ mgcs ( figure 6 ) .
the stimulatory effects of ad were intensified in kgn cells overexpressing nur77 ( figure 6a ) .
in nur77 - / - mgcs , the positive effect of ad was almost completely inhibited ( figure 6c ) while the inhibitory effect of fl was enhanced ( figure 6d ) .
taken together , these findings strongly suggest that nur77 generates its physiological function in granulosa cells partly through up - regulating of ar expression .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0039950.g006 figure 6 nur77 affected the expression of the androgen signaling target gene , kitl , by regulating ar. kgn cells were infected with ad - lacz or ad - flag - nur77 at 10 moi , and nur77 +/+ or nur77 - / - mgcs were treated with androstenedione ( a , c ) or the androgen signaling antagonist , flutamide ( b , d ) .
cellular rna was collected , and real - time pcr analysis showed kitl expression levels with different treatments .
the results are shown as a ratio over control ( n = 3 ) .
values with different superscripts ( a , b , c , d ) are significantly different ( p < 0.05 ) from each other .
discussion previous studies have shown that nur77 was originally identified by its rapid activation by nerve growth factor in pc12 cells [ 29 ] and by serum growth factors in fibroblasts [ 30 ] .
nur77 belongs to the nr4a family of orphan nuclear receptors along with two other members , nurr1 ( nr4a2 ) and nor1 ( nr4a3 ) [ 2 ] .
these family members possess similar structural features with a conserved dna binding domain and a ligand binding domain , but these members have a variable sequence in the n - terminal af - 1 domain [ 3 ] .
these receptors act as endpoint effectors in the protein kinase a ( pka ) signaling pathway .
the af - 1 domain of nur77 has a key role in transcriptional activation , intramolecular interactions , intermolecular interactions , and cofactor recruitment [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] .
nur77 is expressed in various systems , including ovary , testis , adrenal gland , muscle , thymus , pituitary , and central nervous system [ 6 ] .
nur77 is known to be regulated in the following ways : by luteinizing hormone in testicular leydig cells [ 33 ] ; by follicle - stimulating hormone in mouse testis tissue and human fetal sertoli cells [ 34 ] ; and by gonadotropin during follicle development in rat ovaries [ 8 ] .
nur77 regulates the expression of genes , such as cyp21 , cyp11b2 , hsd3b2 and star , encoding steroidogenic enzymes in the adrenal glands , testes and ovaries [ 35 ] - [ 37 ] , and all of these genes are involved in androgen biosynthesis , thus , suggesting that nur77 may be important in androgen production as well as its function through ar. furthermore , both nur77 and ar are particularly relevant to ovarian follicular maturation [ 6 ] , [ 18 ] - [ 20 ] .
in the present study , we found that nur77 positively regulates ar expression in components of the female ovaries .
different granulosa cells , such as mgcs and kgn cells , were used in this study to allow the evaluation and confirmation of the interactions between nur77 and ar. the luciferase assays suggested a direct role in transcriptional regulation of ar expression by nur77 .
because a conserved nbre element ( aaaggtca ) and a partial nbre sequence ( aggtca ) have been observed in human and mouse ar promoters respectively , further experiments , such as chip and abcd assays were conducted in the current study .
these assays suggested that nur77 was recruited to the ar promoter and that nur77 bound to the nbre to mediate ar promoter activation .
as the other two members of the nr4a family , nurr1 and nor1 , have similar expression patterns and transcriptional roles as nur77 [ 38 ] .
it was proposed that there might be potential functional redundancy between nr4a family members [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .
however in the thymuses of nur77 - / - mice , nurr1 expression was proved to be faint and not increased [ 41 ] .
in our study , nurr1 level in the ovary of nur77 - / - mice seemed to have a fluctuation along with the mouse age ( data not shown ) .
in addition , expression levels of nurr1 and nor1 in human ovarian follicles and corpora lutea are much lower than nur77 [ 11 ] .
thus they may not have a maximal role in regulating ar as nur77 in the ovaries .
kit ligand ( kitl ) is a growth factor that influences target cells through binding to its tyrosine kinase receptor , kit [ 42 ] .
the granulosa cell - derived kitl can bind to the kit receptor expressed in oocytes [ 43 ] , thus , having an important role in the following functions : primordial follicle activation [ 44 ] ; oocyte growth and survival [ 45 ] ; meiotic maturation of preovulatory follicles [ 46 ] ; granulosa cell proliferation [ 47 ] ; and regulation of ovarian steroidogenesis [ 48 ] .
antiandrogen flutamide attenuates kitl induction by 5alpha - dihydrotestosterone in mouse ovaries and kgn cells .
moreover , androgen - induced transactivation of mouse and human kitlg promoters has been observed using a luciferase reporter assay in kgn , 293t , and hela cells [ 16 ] .
these studied have established that kitl represents a direct downstream target of androgen signaling in a regulatory cascade controlling folliculogenesis .
in the current study , we found that the changes in kitl occurred along with changes in ar after the alterations in nur77 both in vivo and in vitro .
to ensure this effect was androgen - dependent , we performed the nur77 overexpression experiments in kgn cells and nur77 +/+ mgcs maintained in complete medium ( dmem / f12 medium plus 10 % fbs ) , phenol - free medium ( phenol - free medium plus 10 % fbs ) , or androgen - free medium ( phenol - free medium with charcoal / dextran - treated fbs ) .
the results provided evidence that kitl was regulated by nur77 in the presence of exogenous androgen , whereas its expression was not up - regulated in androgen - free circumstance ( figure s1 , s2 ) .
therefore we consider that nur77 , as an upstream regulator , may indirectly increase androgen - induced kitl expression through the stimulation of ar , thus , contributing to oocyte growth and maturation .
global ar knockout ( arko ) female mice are subfertile , and they have defective folliculogenesis .
moreover , arko female mice ultimately develop premature ovarian failure [ 16 ] , [ 49 ] .
ar signaling in granulosa cells regulates female fertility possibly by controlling preantral follicle growth and development to antral follicles and preventing follicular atresia [ 50 ] .
consistent with the function of ar stimulation mediated by nur77 , we postulate that nur77 represents one of the primary molecules participating in female fertility and folliculogenesis .
as there was only the capacity of reproduction which had been analyzed in nur77 - / - mice as a measure of reproductive function in previous studies [ 39 ] , [ 41 ] , additional detailed studies need to be performed in our future research .
in conclusion , ar protein expression is positively regulated by nur77 at least at the transcriptional level through the ar promoter in mouse and human granulosa cells .
ar signaling is also mediated by nur77 as shown by changes in kitl expression .
the transcriptional down - regulation is also confirmed in the ovaries from nur77 knockout mice in vivo .
our study provides new insights into nur77 functions in the female reproductive system .
understanding the crosstalk between nur77 and ar signaling helps us to understand the mechanisms of androgen signaling , follicle growth and oocyte maturation , which are the key pathological processes in diseases , such as premature ovarian failure ( pof ) and polycystic ovary syndrome ( pcos ; hyperandrogenic anovulation ) .

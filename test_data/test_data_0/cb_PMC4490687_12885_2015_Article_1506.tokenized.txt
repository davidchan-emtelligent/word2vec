background nasal nk / t - cell lymphoma is a rare type of lymphoma in caucasian individuals , but is relatively common in asian populations .
genetic variants in immune and inflammatory response genes may thus be associated with the risk of developing lymphoma .
here , we investigated the association between immuno - modulatory gene polymorphisms and risk for nasal nk / t - cell lymphoma in a chinese population .
methods analysis of 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) in il - 10 , tnf - alpha , lymphotoxin - alpha ( lta ) , and ctla - 4 genes was performed for 125 patients with nk / t - cell lymphoma and 300 healthy controls by pcr - ligase detection reactions .
results the lta + 252 ga + aa genotypes were associated with increased risk for nk / t - cell lymphoma ( or = 2.96 , 95 % ci = 1.42 - 6.19 , p = 0.004 for ga + aa genotype ) .
haplotype c - g - g - a ( tnf - alpha - 857 , - 308 , - 238 and lta + 252 ) also conferred an increased risk ( or = 1.52 , 95 % ci = 1.14 - 2.06 , p = 0.005 ) .
additionally , the lta + 252 ga + aa genotype was associated with an even higher risk in populations positive for epstein - barr virus ( or = 5.20 , 95 % ci = 1.22 - 23.41 , p = 0.03 for the ga + aa genotype ) .
conclusions our data suggest that the lta + 252 a > g polymorphism is associated with the risk of developing nk / t - cell lymphoma , especially for epstein - barr virus - positive nk / t - cell lymphoma in the chinese population .
keywords nk / t - cell lymphoma single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snp ) lymphotoxin - alpha issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background nk / t - cell lymphoma is an aggressive type of cancer that attacks natural killer ( nk ) and / or t - cells , which are key immune cells that fight viruses , bacteria , and tumor cells .
this disease is also known as nasal nk lymphoma , angiocentric lymphoma , or extranodal nk cell lymphoma .
histological features of this lymphoma are vessel - centered lesions , and extensive lymphoma infiltration of blood vessels , which results in notable ischemic necrosis of normal and neoplastic tissues [ 1 , 2 ] .
nk / t - cell lymphoma is relatively uncommon and accounts for less than 1 % of lymphomas in europe and north america .
however , it is relatively common in asia and latin america , and in china and japan it constitutes 6 - 10 % of all lymphomas [ 1 - 3 ] .
the etiology of nk / t - cell lymphoma is complicated and poorly understood , but studies suggest that epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) , ethnicity , and geographic factors contribute to the etiology of this disorder [ 2 - 4 ] , in addition to other factors that may be worthy of exploration .
there is strong evidence that altered immunological function entails an increased risk for lymphoma .
immune and inflammatory response genes are the fundamental messengers of adaptive immunity , which regulate the growth of lymphoid tissue and immune system function .
genetic polymorphisms of several immunity genes were reported to be associated with non - hodgkin lymphoma ( nhl ) and its major subtypes [ 5 - 12 ] .
for this reason , investigation of immune related genetic markers and nk / t - cell lymphoma is desirable .
interleukin - 10 ( il - 10 ) and tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) are key cytokines that have been intensively investigated in autoimmune diseases and malignancies .
both are important regulators for the th1 / th2 balance , apoptosis , and regulation of inflammation .
il - 10 knockout mouse models showed that this cytokine affects b - cell lymphomagenesis either indirectly or directly [ 13 ] .
the tnf family consists of 19 members that mediate diverse biological functions in a variety of cellular systems , and tnf - alpha and lymphotoxin - alpha ( lta , also named tnf - beta ) are two important members of the tnf family .
tnf - alpha is produced primarily by activation of monocyte / macrophages and lta by lymphocytes and nk cells .
even though they are produced by different cells , their biological effect is similar .
in vitro studies show that tnf - alpha or lta play an important role in killing infected or tumor cells by activated macrophages and cytotoxic t cells [ 14 ] .
however , the expression of endogenous tnf resists the cytotoxicity of exogenous tnf to kill tumor cells [ 14 ] .
notably , tnf may stimulate endogenous tumor promoters .
thus , it is thought to be associated with malignant tumors .
a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) have been identified in these gene regions .
among them , il - 10 - 3575 a > t and tnf - alpha - 308 g > a snps were reported to be associated with nhl , especially in diffuse large b - cell lymphoma ( dlbcl ) by several different groups [ 9 , 11 , 12 ] .
in addition to il - 10 and tnf , cytotoxic t lymphocyte antigen 4 ( ctla - 4 ) , a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is expressed mainly on activated t cells , plays a critical role in the suppression of t - cell proliferation and activation .
the inhibitory role of ctla - 4 in maintaining homeostasis of inflammatory and immune reactions makes it a potential candidate gene for determining the genetic predisposition of infectious and autoimmune diseases .
ctla - 4 - deficient mice develop lymphoproliferative disorders characterized by polyclonal t - cell proliferation and early lethality [ 15 ] .
furthermore , ctla - 4 polymorphisms - 318 c > t , + 49 a > g , and ct60 a > g are associated with susceptibility to autoimmune disorders [ 16 ] .
recent reports also revealed that ctla4 polymorphisms have a role in the occurrence of multiple myeloma [ 17 ] and nhl [ 18 ] .
because nk / t - cell lymphoma is a rare subtype of nhl worldwide , very little work has been done to understand its pathogenesis , and , to the best of our knowledge , no study has reported the genetic risk factors for this special type of nhl .
in this case - control study , we investigated the association between several genetic variants of immunoregulatory genes ( il - 10 , tnf / lta , and ctla - 4 ) and risk for nasal nk / t - cell lymphoma in a chinese population .
methods study subjects this study included 125 cases that were newly diagnosed as nasal type nk / t - cell lymphoma and recruited from the following institutions : shandong cancer hospital and institute , shandong university qilu hospital , shandong provincial hospital , jinan fourth people 's hospital , and the affiliated hospital of taishan medical university .
subjects were recruited between january 2006 and december 2011 .
all diagnosed patients met the world health organization ( who ) classification of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues ( 2008 ) diagnostic criteria .
the pathological classification was determined based on tissue sections with haematoxylin - eosin staining and immunohistochemistry as well as clinical characteristics .
the immune phenotype markers included cd2 , cd3 , cd56 , cd45r0 , tia - 1 , granzyme b , lca , and ebv status .
over the same period , 300 controls were accrued from healthy volunteers who visited the general health check - up division or patients with non - cancer diagnoses at shandong cancer hospital and institute , shandong university qilu hospital , and shandong provincial hospital .
controls did not have malignancy or any autoimmune or immune - mediated diseases .
randomly selected controls were matched to the cases by age (+/ - 5 years ) and gender .
all subjects were han chinese .
at recruitment , informed consent was obtained from each subject .
this study was approved by the institutional review board of the shandong cancer hospital and institute .
institutional review board approval has been obtained from all study sites .
all study participants provided 2 ml of peripheral blood .
additionally , immunoglobulin - g antibodies to ebv - vca ( r - biopharm ag , darmstadt , germany ) were confirmed by serology testing using a standard enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay for both case and control subjects .
genotyping gene names , chromosomal location , and the snp database ids used for genotyping are listed in table 1 .
genotyping was carried out , blinded to case - control status , by the shanghai biowing applied biotechnology co. , ltd .
( shanghai , china ) using ligase detection reactions ( ldr ) .
target dna sequences were amplified using a multiplex pcr method and ligation reactions for each subject were carried out in a final volume of 10 mul containing 1 mul of 10x buffer , 100 ng of multi - pcr product , 1 pmol of each discriminating oligo , 1 pmol of each common probe , and 2 u of taq dna ligase ( new england biolabs , beverly , ma , usa ) .
the ldr parameters were as follows : 94 degreesc for 2 min , 35 cycles at 94 degreesc for 30 s , and 50 degreesc for 2 min .
following the ldr reaction , 1 mul of reaction product was mixed with 1 - mul rox and 1 - mul loading buffer and the mixture analyzed with an abi prism 373 dna sequencer ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) .
to confirm genotyping results , 10 % of representative pcr products were examined by dna sequencing in an abi prism 310 sequence ( applied biosystems ) .
results between pcr - ldr and dna sequencing analysis were 100 % concordant .

deviation from hardy - weinberg equilibrium was tested using a chi2 test for goodness of fit .
the genotype and allele frequencies of the polymorphisms in the patient and control group were compared using a chi2 test and odds ratios ( or ) ; 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) calculated to assess the relative risk conferred by a particular allele and genotype , adjusted for age and sex .
the benjamini - hochberg method was used to determine the false positive discovery rate from multiple testing .
data were further stratified by ebv infection or genotypes to evaluate stratum variable related ors .
the linkage disequilibrium of the polymorphic loci and haplotypes were analyzed using shesis software , available from bio - x inc. , shanghai , china ) .
statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 .
results characteristics of nk / t lymphoma patients and controls the demographic characteristics of cases and controls are listed in table 2 .
there were no statistical differences in the age and sex distributions between cases and controls .
according to the ann arbor - cotswolds staging system , 63 nk / t - cell lymphoma patients were classified as stage ie , 38 as stage iie , 15 as stage iiie , and 9 as stage ive .
approximately 78.4 % ( 98 / 125 ) of all nk / t lymphoma cases were nasal cavity and nasopharynx , others ( 21.6 % , 27 / 125 ) were concentrated in the palate , oropharynx , tonsils , skin , and gastrointestinal tract .

all genotype frequencies were in hardy - weinberg equilibrium .
interestingly , the lta + 252 a > g polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of developing nk / t lymphoma .
compared to common genotypes , the lta + 252 ga + aa genotype and a allele were associated with increased risk for nk / t - cell lymphoma ( or = 2.96 , 95 % ci = 1.42 - 6.19 , p = 0.004 for the ga + aa genotype ; or = 1.40 , 95 % ci = 1.03 - 1.89 , p = 0.03 for the a allele ) .
after accounting for multiple comparisons , the lta + 252 ga + aa genotype remained significantly associated with nk / t - cell lymphoma .
however , no statistical significance was noted in the overall risk of developing nk / t lymphoma for il - 10 , tnf - alpha , and ctla4 genotypes .

thus , the relationship between gene polymorphisms and nk / t lymphoma risk was further analyzed with respect to ebv serology .
except for the lta + 252 genotype , no other genotypes were significantly associated with nk / t lymphoma risk .
however , the lta + 252 ga + aa genotype was associated with an increased risk of nk / t lymphoma among ebv - positive populations ( or = 5.20 , 95 % ci = 1.22 - 23.41 , p = 0.03 , table 5 ) .
nevertheless , we found no evidence of interaction between lta + 252 g > a polymorphism and ebv serology in relation to nk / t lymphoma risk ( p interaction = 0.397 ) .
these data indicate that the lta + 252 ga + aa genotype likely influences the inflammatory response to ebv infection , which may ultimately alter the risk for developing nk / t lymphoma .

in lymphoma , il - 10 - 3575a and tnf - 308g increase the risk of dlbcl [ 11 , 12 ] , and ctla - 4 + 49 a > g increases the risk of malt lymphoma [ 19 ] .
in this study , our results showed that lta + 252 a > g polymorphism is associated with a 2.9 - fold risk of nk / t - cell lymphoma , but other polymorphisms of the il - 10 , tnf - alpha , and ctla - 4 genes are not .
the most common haplotype , cgga ( tnf - alpha - 857 c > t , - 308 g > a , - 238 g > a , lta + 252 a > g ) conferred a 1.5 - fold risk of nk / t - cell lymphoma .
furthermore , the lta + 252 ga + aa genotype was associated with an increased nk / t lymphoma risk among ebv - positive populations .
thus , our results suggest that the lta + 252 polymorphism may play an important role in the nk / t - cell lymphoma development , particularly in those who are ebv infected .
previous studies have shown that lta is necessary for the presence of nk cells in the spleen and lta - / - mice have fewer splenic nk cells [ 20 ] .
lta signaling may be involved in the maturation and recruitment of nk cells and is required for nk cell activation [ 21 ] .
in contrast , in nk cell - mediated anti - tumor activity , lta contributes to tumor rejection by stimulating the host immune response [ 21 ] .
for nk / t lymphoma , no role for lta in nk / t - cell malignant transformation has been reported .
our study shows that individuals with the lta + 252 a allele have an increased tendency toward nk / t - cell lymphoma , suggesting that lta deregulation caused by genetic polymorphisms may be affected by nk / t lymphoma pathogenesis .
in our control group , we note that the lta + 252a and g allele frequencies were 0.56 and 0.44 , respectively , similar to the frequencies in healthy koreans ( 0.54 and 0.46 , respectively ) [ 22 ] , but different from caucasians of european descent ( 0.68 and 0.32 , respectively ) [ 9 , 12 ] .
this suggests that the lta + 252 a > g polymorphism varies among ethnic groups or geographical regions , and association of the lta + 252 a > g polymorphism with nk / t - cell lymphoma appears to vary by ethnicity .
the human lta gene is located on chromosome 6p23 - q12 and is closely linked to tnf - alpha , from which it is separated by about 1.2kb .
our study also shows that the tnf / lta haplotype cgga ( tnf - alpha - 857c / - 308g / - 238g / lta + 252a ) has a 1.5 - fold increased risk of nk / t - cell lymphoma compared with those of non - cgga types .
the tnf / lta haplotypes in most studies focused on the tnf - 308 and lta + 252 loci , with significant associations between high - producer tnf - alpha - 308a / lta + 252g haplotypes and increased risk of dlbcl [ 9 ] .
in contrast , our results suggest that tnf - alpha - 308 g and lta + 252 a haplotypes increase the risk of nk / t - cell lymphoma .
the tnf / lta locus is located within the major histocompatibility complex ( hla ) class iii region .
this region has many polymorphisms and regulates the immune response to infection and malignant transformation .
several studies have described substantial genetic variations in the hla - drb1 and lta - tnf regions in caucasians and asians [ 23 , 24 ] , which may lead to different levels of nhl susceptibility .
fine mapping and functional studies of snps across this region will be required to determine whether the tnf - alpha - 308 g > a and lta + 252 a > g snps constitute distinct susceptibility alleles or whether they are linked to other causal hla loci .
in this study , ebv infection is commonly observed in nasal nk / t lymphoma , but its oncogenic mechanism remains unclear .
some studies have shown that ebv can be integrated into the host cell genome , causing lymphocyte immortalization [ 25 , 26 ] .
in addition , it has been suggested that ebv stimulates t lymphocytes , releasing a variety of cytokines such as tnf , interferon ( ifn ) , and interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) , which may lead to immune dysfunction [ 27 ] .
chronic inflammation induced by viral infection may result in complex interrelated degenerative and regenerative processes , promoting the accumulation of critical mutations in the host genome .
this may be the reason why chronic inflammation is closely related to a number of cancers .
the present study describes , for the first time , the significantly higher presence of the lta + 252 g > a genotype in nk / t lymphoma patients ( or = 2.9 , 95 % ci = 1.42 - 6.19 ) and ebv - positive populations ( or = 5.2 , 95 % ci = 1.22 - 23.41 , p = 0.03 ) .
this leads us to infer that this allele combined with h. pylori infection may further increase the risk for developing nk / t - cell lymphoma .
lta and tnf - alpha are key members of the tnf family , and are similar in gene structure , protein molecular structure , and biological function .
however , they have many differences with respect to cellular origin and regulation of gene expression .
our results show that the lta , but not the tnf gene , polymorphism serves as a genetic marker for nk / t - cell lymphoma , which suggests that subtle genetic differences may be involved in regulating different signaling pathways and leading to different pathogenesis among lymphoma subtypes .
conclusions our data suggest that the lta + 252 a > g polymorphism is associated with the risk of developing nk / t - cell lymphoma in a chinese population , especially with ebv - positive nk / t - cell lymphoma .

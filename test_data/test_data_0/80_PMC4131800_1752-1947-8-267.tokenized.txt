introduction nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis is a very rare complication of malignancy and other hypercoagulable states .
it describes the deposition of small sterile smooth or verrucoid vegetations on the valve leaflets , causing a clinical picture similar to that of bacterial endocarditis .
the authors reported this case because this is a rare and unusual first manifestation of malignancy generally and of gastric cancer particularly , with only a few reports present in the literature .
case presentation the authors present a case of a 36 - year - old caucasian male with occult gastric cancer whose first and only manifestation was nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis causing extensive multi - organ infarctions .
conclusions an endocarditis not responsive to antibiotics should raise the suspicion of an occult malignancy .
differentiating between an infective endocarditis and a nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis will cause a radical change in the management which will eventually affect the patient 's prognosis .
embolism endocarditis nonbacterial noninfective stomach neoplasms thrombosis introduction nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis ( nbte ) is a rare entity that describes small sterile vegetations on normal heart valves in the absence of a bacterial infection in the blood [ 1 - 3 ] .
this condition most commonly affects the aortic valve and to a lesser extent the mitral valve or both and more rarely the right - sided valves [ 4 ] .
in this case report we present a 36 - year - old caucasian male , previously asymptomatic , who visited our hospital with a picture of endocarditis , which turned out to be nonbacterial and the first manifestation of occult gastric cancer .
the association between cancer and thrombophilia is well known and described in the medical literature .
as reviewed by el - shami et al. , it is estimated that thromboembolic events occur in about 15 % of patients with cancer , and evidence of venous thromboembolism will appear on postmortem examination in 50 % of patients with an underlying malignancy [ 1 ] .
cancer - associated thrombophilia most commonly presents as venous thromboembolism , but it can also take the form of migratory superficial thrombophlebitis ( described by trousseau in 1865 ) , arterial thrombosis , disseminated intravascular coagulation , and nbte which was originally described by ziegler in 1888 [ 1,2 ] .
case presentation a 36 - year - old caucasian male presented to our hospital after an episode of presyncope .
he felt dizzy while in the bathroom and stepped out and lay down for 15 minutes before the dizziness subsided .
he reported no previous similar episodes , as well as no prior history of any seizure - like activity , postictal state , or incontinence .
he denied weight loss , night sweats , and high grade fever but reported one episode of chills a few hours prior to presentation .
he directly presented to our emergency department ( ed ) to be worked up. one week prior to presentation he was admitted to an outside hospital for chest pain .
he reported that the workup , including cardiac catheterization , done there was negative for any cardiac cause , but an ultrasound of his abdomen showed ascites .
this latter finding prompted him to seek the advice of one of our gastroenterologists who saw him and ordered a computed tomography ( ct ) scan of his abdomen and pelvis .
in the ed , his physical examination was significant for mild tachycardia , soft grade ii / vi systolic ejection murmur on the left sternal border , and splinter hemorrhages in his nail beds .
the rest of his physical examination , including neurologic examination , was normal .
portable transthoracic echocardiography ( tte ) showed a mitral valve vegetation measuring 0.8cmx0.6cm ( figure 1 ) .
a ct scan of his abdomen and pelvis showed multiple lytic bone lesions , splenic and renal infarcts , evidence of malignant ascites , as well as omental caking .
he was started on intravenous penicillin g 2 million units every 4 hours and gentamicin 80mg every 8 hours for presumptive bacterial endocarditis , while workup for hypercoagulable state and malignancy was taken .
the hypercoagulability panel included d - dimer , international normalized ratio , lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) , anticardiolipin immunoglobulin ( ig ) g and igm , antithrombin iii , protein c , protein s , methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( mthfr ) mutation screening , and lupus anticoagulants .
the panel was significant for elevated d - dimer and ldh , heterozygosity for mthfr mutation , and positive lupus anticoagulant , whereas the rest of the panel was within normal limits .
in addition , antinuclear antibodies , and anti - b2 glycoprotein igg and igm were also negative .
as for the malignancy workup , tumor markers were taken and were significant for elevated carcinoembryonic antigen and ca 19 - 9 , whereas alpha - fetoprotein and prostate - specific antigen were both normal .

he was sent to undergo fine - needle aspirate ( fna ) of the omental cake a few days later , and the fna result showed adenocarcinoma .
colonoscopy was done and was normal , but esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a gastric ulcer at the greater curvature in the gastric body from which biopsies were taken .
the pathology results showed undifferentiated gastric adenocarcinoma .
a few days later he underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) based on the recommendations of the neurology team ; they were worried that because he had a picture of multiple sites of infarction due to emboli from the site of endocarditis , he might also have showering of emboli to his brain , thus explaining his initial presentation with dizziness .
his brain mri showed an acute right middle cerebral artery stroke. with the suspicion of bacterial endocarditis subsiding in light of his malignancy and hypercoagulability , and with his limited response to antibiotics , he was started on the low - molecular - weight heparin tinzaparin to treat his nbte and overall hypercoagulable state , and he was followed up by the oncology team for chemotherapy .
serial blood cultures remained negative , and he was thus shifted from penicillin g and gentamicin to ciprofloxacin , gentamicin , and vancomycin treating possible culture - negative bacterial endocarditis .
however , his serial blood cultures remained negative after 17 days of incubation , and all antibiotics were stopped and he remained on anticoagulation with the diagnosis of nbte .
discussion this is a case of nbte secondary to metastatic gastric cancer ( stage iv ) in a previously healthy young man .
he has previously had no symptoms like weight loss , fever , night sweats , or change in appetite or bowel movements .
an infectious cause for his endocarditis was ruled out after consistently negative serial cultures , limited response to antibiotics and in view of his underlying malignancy .
even though the workup for a hypercoagulable state was positive for lupus anticoagulant and heterozygosity for the mthfr mutation , these findings do not explain his presentation , especially since his family history is also negative for thrombotic events .
the pathogenesis of nbte is not fully understood .
one hypothesis incriminates interleukins and tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) , released secondary to the interaction between monocytes or macrophages and malignant cells [ 5,6 ] .
this release of interleukins and tnf will cause endothelial damage and sloughing , which may lead to thrombogenesis on valvular surfaces as well as other sites in the bloodstream [ 5,6 ] .
platelets and clotting factors may also be activated by this interaction which could further facilitate thrombosis [ 5 ] .
these sterile vegetations consisting of degenerating platelets and fibrin strands may have a wide range of sizes , and the absence of an inflammatory reaction at the site of attachment makes them very friable , with a tendency to detach more readily than those present in infective endocarditis [ 1 - 3,7 ] .
this may lead to infarcts in various organs , including the spleen , kidney , heart and brain [ 6,8 ] .
in fact , stroke is commonly the first clinical presentation of nbte [ 7 ] .
the true incidence of nbte is not known [ 1 ] .
it can occur in any type of cancer except brain tumors [ 9 ] .
cancers of the lung , pancreas , and stomach , in addition to adenocarcinomas of unknown primary sites , are the most common malignancies associated with nbte [ 10 ] .
infective endocarditis and nbte have many common risk factors .
hence it is often possible to clinically confuse these two entities [ 2 ] .
according to a review by el - shami et al. , no signs or symptoms are specific for nbte , but a murmur in a patient known to have a malignancy should warrant the clinician to consider nbte on the differential diagnosis .
in general , if endocarditis is suspected in a patient known to have a history of malignancy and he / she has had no significant response to antibiotics , the physician should consider nbte [ 1 ] .
similarly to infective endocarditis , transesophageal echocardiography has been shown to be more sensitive in detecting vegetations than tte [ 1,11 ] .
studies have shown that diffusion - weighted imaging ( dwi ) mri may help differentiate cardioembolic strokes secondary to infective endocarditis from those secondary to nbte .
in an imaging study done in 2002 , four patterns on dwi have been described in patients experiencing recurrent embolic strokes due to bacterial endocarditis or nbte [ 7 ] .
these patterns are the following : pattern 1 , a single lesion corresponding to a solitary embolus ; pattern 2 , multiple closely spaced lesions in a single arterial territory ; pattern 3 , multiple punctuate disseminated lesions ; and pattern 4 , multiple small and medium or large disseminated lesions [ 7 ] .
those secondary to nbte exhibit pattern 4 , described as multiple small and medium or large disseminated lesions , whereas strokes secondary to infective endocarditis manifest as a mix of all four patterns [ 7 ] .
once nbte is diagnosed , the two primary goals should be the treatment of the underlying malignancy and systemic anticoagulation [ 1 ] .
among all forms of anticoagulation , unfractionated heparin ( subcutaneous or intravenous ) has been shown to be the most effective in reducing the incidence of embolic events .
low - molecular - weight heparin has also been used and appears to be effective .
vitamin k antagonists such as warfarin should not be used as they seem to be ineffective in controlling the coagulopathy in nbte [ 1,5 ] .
the reason for that remains unknown .
patients with nbte should stay on anticoagulation indefinitely [ 1 ] .
in patients with potentially curable cancer and tumor - associated coagulopathy , tumor resection as a first therapeutic priority to eliminate the cause of the coagulopathy should be considered [ 12 ] .
in cases of persistent embolic events despite anticoagulation and a potentially curable cancer , valvular surgery can be considered prior to tumor resection to minimize the damage caused by the recurrent emboli [ 12 ] .
conclusions endocarditis in a patient of any age group , especially one who is nonresponsive to antibiotics , should raise concern for other etiologies such as occult malignancy .
it is possible that malignancy might first manifest with signs and symptoms of thromboembolism , or rarely in the form of endocarditis .
given that the management of nbte and bacterial endocarditis are different , this necessitates having the correct diagnosis .

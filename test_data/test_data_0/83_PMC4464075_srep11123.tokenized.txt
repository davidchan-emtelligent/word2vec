contrary to this hypothesis , c57bl / 6j mice fed a 45 % high fat diet exhibited weight gain that was inhibited by increased dietary sodium content .
this suppressive effect of dietary sodium upon weight gain was mediated specifically through a reduction in digestive efficiency , with no effects on food intake behavior , physical activity , or resting metabolism .
replacement of circulating angiotensin ii levels reversed the effects of high dietary sodium to suppress digestive efficiency .
while the at1 receptor antagonist losartan had no effect in mice fed low sodium , the at2 receptor antagonist pd - 123,319 suppressed digestive efficiency .
correspondingly , genetic deletion of the at2 receptor in fvb / ncrl mice resulted in suppressed digestive efficiency even on a standard chow diet .
together these data underscore the importance of digestive efficiency in the pathogenesis of obesity , and implicate dietary sodium , the renin - angiotensin system , and the at2 receptor in the control of digestive efficiency regardless of mouse strain or macronutrient composition of the diet .
these findings highlight the need for greater understanding of nutrient absorption control physiology , and prompt more uniform assessment of digestive efficiency in animal studies of energy balance .
it is generally held that excess consumption of sodium salts and fats lead to poor health outcomes .
excess sodium intake is associated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome1 , reduced insulin sensitivity2 , and cardiovascular disease and mortality3 .
excess fat intake is similarly associated with obesity4 , and is used to drive animal models of diet - induced obesity5 .
it is important to recognize , however , that considerable debate remains as to a causal role ( versus simply a correlation ) between these factors and human disease at the population level6 .
fast - and processed foods , characterized by high levels of fat and sodium , have been suggested to activate innate mechanisms of reward .
it has been posited that these types of food may thus elicit addictive behavior , which may contribute to obesity through excessive caloric intake7 .
sodium and fat are both palatable to humans and non - human animals , though preferences for one or both can be modulated by various interventions8 .
together , these findings led us to hypothesize a synergistic effect of dietary fat and sodium to increase food intake and thereby body mass .
the renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) is critically involved in cardiovascular physiology , and its role in metabolic physiology is only more recently appreciated9 .
briefly , obesity is positively correlated with circulating ras activity in humans and animal models10111213141516171819 .
genetic or pharmacological interference with the ras in rodents results in weight loss , reduced adiposity , and / or altered adipose development202122232425262728 .
there is also growing evidence for opposing , tissue / site - specific roles for the ras in the control of appetite / ingestive behavior2930 and in the control of resting metabolism931323334 .
as the ras is strongly suppressed by dietary sodium35 , this led us to the secondary hypothesis that any observed metabolic consequences of altered dietary sodium may be mediated through its modulation of the ras .
results dietary sodium suppresses hfd - weight gain placing adult wildtype c57bl / 6j mice on a high fat diet ( hfd ; table 1 ) resulted in an immediate and sustained increase in weight gain compared to mice that remained on standard chow .
surprisingly , and contrary to our original hypothesis , dietary sodium caused a dose - dependent reduction in weight gain during hfd - feeding ( fig. 1a ) .
this increase in weight gain was primarily due to a robust , early increase in adiposity and slower subsequent ( possibly reflexive ) increases in lean and fluid masses ( figure s1a ) .
animals maintained on hfd with lower sodium content exhibited specific expansions of traditional white adipose tissues , including subcutaneous inguinal and perigenital fat pads , while other tissues remained largely unchanged by diet ( interscapular " brown " adipose , heart , liver and kidney ) ( figure s1b ) .
dietary sodium content did not alter total food intake , despite effects on preference to assess whether differences in food ingestive behavior could explain the observed effects on weight gain , food intake was measured in mice fed chow , hfd + 0.25 % nacl , and hfd + 4 % nacl for five weeks .
caloric intake ( mass of food ingested multiplied by the caloric density ) was significantly increased with hfd , but sodium content had no effect upon caloric intake ( fig. 1b ) .
in contrast , the three diets had large , expected effects upon total daily sodium intake ( figure s1c ) .
when the net body mass change over five weeks was plotted against total caloric intake and total sodium intake , no relationship between body mass change and caloric intake was observed ( fig. 1c ) .
in contrast , a significant inverse correlation was observed between body mass gains and sodium ingestion using an inverse 1st order polynomial regression : with body mass in grams , and sodium intake in meq / d ; r2 = 0.71 ; y0 = 3.687 +/ - 0.379 , p < 0.0001 ; a = 0.739 +/ - 0.111 , p < 0.0001 ( fig. 1d ) .
when animals were allowed to choose between pairs of hfd with low ( 0.25 %) , medium ( 1 %) , or high ( 4 %) nacl content , it became readily apparent that mice prefer diets with lower sodium content ( figure s1d ) .
dietary sodium content did not change metabolic rate or physical activity metabolic effects of dietary fat and sodium were assessed over the light : dark cycle using an oxymax system ( columbus instruments ) .
aerobic metabolic rate , determined by respirometry , was indistinguishable across groups with two weeks of dietary intervention ( fig. 2a ) .
importantly , rer was suppressed in both hfd groups , as would be expected with increased metabolic utilization of fatty acids .
spontaneous physical activity was indistinguishable across groups .
a similar lack of effect of the dietary interventions was maintained through eight weeks of treatment ( fig. 2b ) , save a slight increase in metabolic rate in the hfd + 0.25 % nacl group .
this divergence is almost certainly due to the increased body mass of the animals after eight weeks on the diet .
resting metabolic rate ( rmr ) was specifically examined using a high - resolution combined direct calorimeter / respirometer after 2.5 weeks of dietary intervention .
aerobic rmr , estimated by respirometry , appeared to increase with hfd feeding ( figure s2a ) .
total rmr as measured by direct calorimetry , however , was unchanged by any dietary interventions ( figure s2b ) .
dietary sodium suppresses circulating ras activity blood pressure was assessed daily in one cohort of mice fed chow , hfd + 0.25 % nacl or hfd + 4 % nacl .
no effects of the various diets were observed by tail - cuff plethysmography ( figure s3a - b ) .
nonetheless , dietary sodium caused the expected reduction in renal renin expression .
compared to hfd + 0.25 % nacl ( n = 7 ; 1.000 - fold by livak 2 - deltadeltact method ; +/ - 1 sem range = 0.817 to 1.225 ) , renin mrna from whole - kidney extracts was significantly suppressed with hfd + 4 % nacl ( n = 8 ; 0.590 - fold ; 0.515 to 0.676 ; p < 0.05 ) .
plasma concentrations of ang ii exhibited expected trends , with hfd + 0.25 % nacl appearing to increase compared to both chow and hfd + 4 % nacl groups , though group differences did not reach statistical significance ( figure s3c ) .
treating mice with hfd + 0.25 % nacl also caused a significant reduction in mrna for renin in whole brain homogenate that was largely reversed in mice fed hfd + 4 % nacl ( figure s4a ) .
dietary sodium suppresses digestive efficiency through suppression of the ras digestive efficiency , as assessed by fecal acid steatocrit , was reduced by increased dietary sodium .
mice fed hfd + 4 % nacl lost roughly double the amount of fatty acid to the stool as mice fed hfd + 0.25 % nacl ( fig. 3a ) .
chronic infusion of a non - pressor dose of ang ii ( 100 ng / kg / min , s.c. ) into mice fed hfd + 4 % nacl increased digestive efficiency to the level of animals fed hfd + 0.25 % nacl .
interestingly , chronic infusion of the ang ii at1 receptor antagonist losartan ( 22 mug / hr , s.c. ) had no effect to reduce digestive efficiency in mice fed hfd + 0.25 % nacl .
examination of ras gene expression patterns throughout the intestinal tract confirmed expression of renin , angiotensinogen , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ace ) , and ( ace ) - 2 , at1a and at2 receptor expression throughout the duodenum , jejunum , ileum and cecum ( figure s4b ) .
hfd , regardless of sodium content , had a suppressive effect on ace2 in duodenum and jejunum ; and at1a and at2 appear to exhibit an moderate suppression in ileum with low sodium diet or angiotensin ii infusion .
the angiotensin at2 receptor reduces digestive efficiency in contrast to the lack of effect of chronic infusion of the at1 receptor antagonist , chronic infusion of the at2 receptor antagonist , pd - 123,319 ( 0.55 mug / hr , s.c. ) into wildtype c57bl / 6j mice fed hfd + 0.25 % nacl caused a significant suppression of digestive efficiency , compared to mice chronically infused with saline vehicle ( fig. 3b ) .
finally , to overcome the shortcomings of selectivity posed by studies utilizing pharmacological antagonists , digestive efficiency was also assessed in mice carrying a null allele for the at2 receptor ( at2 - ko ) , maintained on the fvb / ncrl background strain .
at2 - ko mice maintained on standard chow ( 13.7 +/ - 0.7 weeks of age , 26.91 +/ - 1.20 grams , n = 6 ) exhibited a significantly suppressed digestive efficiency compared to littermate controls ( 13.9 +/ - 0.5 weeks of age , 26.88 +/ - 0.82 grams , n = 6 ) , when assessed using fecal acid steatocrit ( fig. 3c ) .
discussion the current study demonstrates that dietary sodium content can suppress weight gain during hfd feeding .
this appears to be mediated exclusively through a suppression of digestive efficiency , which results from a sodium - induced suppression of the ras .
interestingly the at2 receptor , not at1 receptor , was implicated in the control of digestive efficiency. of note , the effect of at2 modulation on digestive efficiency was consistently observed in both c57bl / 6j and fvb / ncrl strains of mice , maintained on either a custom - formulated 45 % high fat diet or on a standard chow with vastly different compositions and obtained from different vendors .
collectively , these results implicate dietary sodium and the ras in the control of digestive efficiency , and underscore the physiological relevance of digestive efficiency in the pathogenesis of diet - induced obesity ( fig. 4 ) .
in 1960 , dahl demonstrated that dietary sodium intakes across populations positively correlated with the incidence of hypertension36 .
specifically , nacl consumption varied from roughly 5 g / d in alaskan eskimos where hypertension was extremely rare , to 25 g / d in northern japanese , where nearly one third of the population exhibited hypertension .
estimating an adult human 's daily food intake at 1.2 kg / d37 , this would support a range of 0.4 - 2.1 % nacl in typical human foods .
similarly , the intersalt study documented a range of 23 mg / d sodium intake in the yanomamo tribe of brazil , to 6 g / d in china3839 .
again using an average 1.2 kg / d food ingestion and assuming all of the sodium was consumed as nacl , this would equate to a range of 0.005 - 1.275 % nacl in food .
similarly , o'donnell recently reported on behalf of the pure study ( including 101,945 individual human subjects across 17 countries ) that the average sodium intake is 4.93 g / d , which would equate to 12.53 g / d of nacl ; using similar food intake estimates as above , this yields a 1.04 % nacl diet equivalent40 .
according to nutritional information provided by the mcdonald 's usa corporation , a quarter pounder with cheese and medium - sized french fries meal includes the rough equivalent of 1.1 % nacl41 .
thus , our examination of the effects of 0.25 - 4 % nacl in the context of a high fat diet is relevant and applicable to humans across a wide spectrum of cultures and populations .
digestive efficiency is a relatively safe and moderately efficacious target for the treatment of obesity .
orlistat , also known as xenical or tetrahydrolipstatin , is a pancreatic lipase inhibitor that was approved for human use by the united states food & drug administration in 1999 .
given its safe use and extremely low potential for addiction or abuse , it was approved for over - the - counter sale as " alli " in 2007 .
this compound effectively inhibits the enzymatic digestion of dietary fats and thereby prevents the absorption of a fraction of ingested lipids by the gastrointestinal tract .
orlistat appears to maximally inhibit the absorption of roughly one third of ingested lipids4243 .
it is unclear whether targeting the secretion of pancreatic enzymes may have a greater maximal efficacy than competitively inhibiting these enzymes .
a greater understanding of the mechanisms controlling digestive efficiency is needed before new therapeutic targets can be identified .
the renin - angiotensin system , or its downstream mediators , may represent novel targets for the modulation of digestive efficiency .
as recently reviewed by garg et al.44 , essentially all components of the ras are expressed throughout the digestive system .
renin is readily present in the circulation and its mrna has been detected in human small intestine45 and colon46 .
ace and ace2 are strongly expressed in the small intestine ( in fact , the highest human tissue concentrations of these enzymes are in intestine ) 47484950 and colon46 , and neutral endopeptidase ( neprilysin ) shows similar patterns of expression51 .
at1 receptors are localized to the epithelial brush border , circular and longitudinal muscle layers and myenteric plexus of the small intestine , but at2 receptors are restricted to the myenteric plexus525354 .
at1 and at2 are also expressed in various layers of the colon46 , stomach55 , and esophagus5657 .
angiotensinogen is expressed throughout the small intestine58 , colon59 , and stomach55 .
various ras peptides including angiotensin ( ang ) i , ang ii , and ang - ( 1 - 7 ) have been documented in various portions of the gi tract5260 .
thus , the ras is present in the viscera and it is therefore positioned to potentially play an important role in the control of digestive function .
ang ii action at at2 receptors has been documented to functionally influence digestive system function .
ang ii stimulates apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells via the at2 receptor61 .
activation of at2 by cgp - 42112a causes increased nitric oxide production in jejunal mucosa62 .
low - dose ang ii delivery stimulates jejunal water and electrolyte absorption , and this effect appears to be mediated through an at2 - cgmp signaling mechanism63 .
while at1 and at2 receptors are both present on pancreatic acinar cells and secretion of digestive enzymes by these cells is stimulated by ang ii , this effect is blocked by losartan but not pd - 123,319 , highlighting a role for at1 but not at264 .
the ras may therefore mediate its effects on caloric absorption through a complex modulation of digestive enzyme secretion and gastric motility , or other as - yet unidentified mechanisms .
takahashi previously demonstrated that genetic disruption of the renin gene in mice resulted in protection from hfd - induced weight gain , that this mechanism involved both an increase in thermogenesis and also a reduction in digestive efficiency , and that the metabolic consequences of renin deficiency could be rescued by ang ii replacement20 .
while various genetic and pharmacological manipulations to other components of the ras have anti - obesity effects in rodents , we have been unable to find any mention of effects of these manipulations upon digestive efficiency .
we hypothesize that this may simply be a consequence of many laboratories ignoring the physiological significance of digestive efficiency modulation , as food intake data are very rarely corrected for digestive efficiency in discussions of the relative effects of genetic , pharmacological , and dietary manipulations upon total energy balance .
unlike takahashi 's studies of global renin knockout mice20 , in the present study we did not observe changes in net thermogenesis / energy expenditure .
this may reflect the universal disruption of renin in genetic knockout mice , versus a modulation of predominantly the circulating ras with dietary sodium changes , as salt - sensitive models of hypertension exhibit suppressed circulating ras activity but elevated brain ras activity656667 .
it appears , however , that dietary fats and sodium content may shift the form of energy utilization toward aerobic processes and away from non - aerobic processes .
respirometric estimates of heat production ignore the contributions of anaerobic and nitrogen metabolisms , and are subject to a long list of required assumptions regarding the test subject 's physiology68 .
it has been demonstrated that respirometry grossly underestimates true total metabolic rate by up to 38 % in various endothermic species69 .
we previously demonstrated that resting metabolic rate ( rmr ) of laboratory mice is underestimated by respirometric methods , and that this rate of underestimation is highly variable31 .
the variability of underestimation is so great that qualitatively false negative and false positive conclusions regarding the effects of pharmacological and genetic manipulations in mice can result31 .
very recently we demonstrated that respirometry indicates a false positive effect of switching from standard chow to a 45 % hfd upon total rmr in wildtype c57bl / 6j mice70 .
specifically , we determined that with a shift from chow to hfd , respirometry detects a significant (~ 0.01 kcal / hr ) increase in aerobic rmr but fails to capture the simultaneous and equally large decrease in non - aerobic rmr. that observation is now replicated in the present study , where animals switched to hfd exhibited an apparent increase in aerobic rmr but no change in total rmr .
in other words , dietary shifts qualitatively change the contributions of various types of resting metabolic processes ( i.e. - aerobic vs non - aerobic ) , but have no observed quantitative effect on total resting energy expenditure .
in summary , dietary sodium causes a dose - dependent suppression of digestive efficiency through inhibition of the ras , and this effect is sufficient to completely prevent hfd - induced weight gain .
given the importance of digestive efficiency to health and disease , and the proven utility of targeting digestive efficiency to treat obesity ( e.g. - orlistat ) , we hypothesize that further investigations into mechanisms ( such as the ras and its at2 receptor ) that control digestive efficiency may lead to the development of more efficacious anti - obesity therapeutics .
methods animals wildtype male c57bl / 6j mice were obtained from the jackson laboratories at 5 - 6 weeks of age .
mice were acclimated to housing conditions ( 23 degreesc , 12:12 light : dark cycle ) for several weeks before studies were initiated at 9 weeks of age .
at2 receptor - deficient mice and littermate controls maintained on the fvb / ncrl background strain were obtained from an in - house breeding colony , originally obtained from drs .
victor j. dzau and richard e. pratt ( duke university ) .
animals were allowed ad libitum access to water and various diets throughout all studies except for acute measurements as described below .
selected mice underwent subcutaneous implantation of osmotic minipumps under isoflurane anesthesia to deliver a non - pressor dose of angiotensin ii ( ang ii ; 100 ng / kg / min ) , the ang ii type 1 receptor antagonist , losartan ( 22 ug / hr ) , or the ang ii type 2 receptor antagonist , pd - 123,319 ( 0.55 mug / hr ) .
all animal experiments were approved by the university of iowa institutional animal care and use committee , and all methods were in accordance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals71 .
diets mice were maintained on a standard rodent chow ( teklad 7013 ) unless otherwise stated .
custom high - fat diets ( bioserv ) were developed to provide a high fat content ( 45 % of kcal from fat ) with varied concentrations of nacl ( 0.25 % to 4 %) .
compositions of all diets are described in table 1 .
body composition body composition was assessed by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ; bruker lf90ii ) 970 .
briefly , awake / unanesthetized animals were placed into a polycarbonate restraint tube and placed inside the scanner for roughly 1 minute to perform the analyses .
animals were immediately returned to their home cage .
food intake and preference food intake was assessed in home cages under standard housing conditions .
food preference assessments were also performed in home cages , with two food options presented simultaneously in identical hoppers on opposite ends of the cage .
intake of each food was assessed daily for one week and averaged within animal before making group comparisons .
total calorimetry / resting metabolic rates aerobic and total ( i.e. - aerobic + anaerobic + nitrogenous ) resting metabolic rates ( rmr ) were assessed simultaneously using a combined or " total " calorimeter system , as recently described in detail3170 .
this system consists of a custom - fabricated gradient - layer direct calorimeter ( to directly measure total heat dissipation and retention by the mouse ) and a conventional push - pull respirometry system ( to estimate aerobic rmr using empirically derived equations , as below ) .
animals were individually tested by placing a single mouse in the chamber at 8 am ( 2 hours into the light phase ) and continuously monitoring total heat dissipation and gas exchange for roughly six hours .
total and aerobic rmr were calculated when the animal was stably asleep in the chamber .
rer was calculated as the ratio of co2 produced ( vco2 ) versus o2 consumed ( vo2 ) .
aerobic heat ( in kcal / hr ) was calculated using the equation derived from lusk72 , with stp - corrected gas consumption / production rates ( in ml / min ) 3170 .
oxymax / comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system ( clams ) respirometric heat production , respiratory exchange ratio ( rer ) , physical activity by photoelectric beam break , and food intake / patterning were assessed using a 16 - chamber oxymax clams system ( columbus instruments ) .
animals were housed individually in specialized oxymax home cages for four nights in total .
ambient temperature was maintained at 30 +/ - 1 degreesc throughout the testing period .
animals were acclimated to the system for 48 hours , and data were recorded and analyzed from the remaining 48 hours of the testing period .
data from 17 minute bins were averaged across days within animal before group comparisons were made .
aerobic heat was calculated by the system using the lusk equation , as above72 .
blood pressure blood pressure was assessed by tail - cuff plethysmography ( visitech ) .
testing was performed daily five days per week , and involved restraining the animals on a warmed heating surface .
animals were instrumented with a pneumatic occlusion cuff proximal to an infrared pulse oximeter .
flow was occluded by pressurizing the cuff , and the pressure at the loss of pulse detection was noted .
thirty occlusion cycles were performed over thirty minutes , once daily .
data from the first week of testing were discarded as training ; remaining data were averaged within animal , within day , and then within week before group comparisons were made .
ras component mrna animals were sacrificed by co2 asphyxiation .
kidneys , brain , and intestinal sections were removed by blunt dissection and frozen on dry ice .
tissue was later thawed and rna was isolated by trizol followed by use of purelink rna kits ( ambion ) .
rna was then examined for specific gene content by realtime rt - pcr ( sybr green method ) as previously3473 , using primer pairs previously reported74 .
importantly , as two distinct isoforms of renin are expressed in the brain75 , we used a primer set for renin ( forward 5 ' - tgaagaaggctgtgcggtagt - 3 ' , and reverse 5 ' - tcccaggtcaaaggaaatgtc - 3 ') which spans exons 7 and 8 of the renin locus , and thereby detects mrna for both intracellular and secreted isoforms of the enzyme .
fold changes in gene expression were calculated using the livak 2 - deltadeltact method76 , and analytical statistics were performed on deltact values .
circulating angiotensin ii ( and iii ) trunk blood was collected at sacrifice into tubes coated with edta , and plasma was isolated and frozen at - 80 degreesc after centrifugation for 5 minutes at 5,000 x g. plasma was subsequently thawed and then extracted using a commercially - available c18 sep - column kit per manufacturer 's instructions ( peninsula laboratories international , inc. ; catalog number s - 5000 ) .
100 ul of plasma was extracted , lyophilized , and stored at - 80 degreesc .
the dried extract was then reconstituted in 150 ul of eia buffer and analyzed using a commercially - available eia kit per manufacturer 's instructions ( peninsula laboratories international , inc. ; catalog number s - 1133 ) .
fecal acid steatocrit mice were individually placed into glass beakers at 10 am ( 4 hours into the light phase ) , and fresh fecal pellets were collected until eight pellets were collected per animal20 .
50 +/ - 1 mg of fresh fecal material was then isolated from each animal .
this 50 mg sample was then pulverized and dissolved in 200 mul of freshly prepared 1 n perchloric acid .
next , 100 mul of 0.5 % oil - red - o was added to the mixture .
the slurry was then loaded into non - heparinized micro - hematocrit tubes and spun for 10 minutes at 10,000 x g. tubes were then aligned and digitally photographed .
the proportion of red - stained oil layer to the total sample length was calculated using imagej software from the nih .
statistics throughout , anova - based analyses ( with repeated measures as appropriate ) and independent t - test were utilized .
tukey multiple - comparisons procedures were used for post - hoc analyses .
differences were considered significant at p < 0.05 .
data are reported as mean +/ - 1 sem , throughout .

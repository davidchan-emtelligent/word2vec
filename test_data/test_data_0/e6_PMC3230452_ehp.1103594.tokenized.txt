background : exposure to ambient air particulate matter ( pm ) has been shown to increase rates of cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality , but the underlying mechanisms are still not well understood .
objective : we examined signaling events involved in the expression of the inflammatory gene interleukin - 8 ( il - 8 ) in human airway epithelial cells ( haecs ) exposed to ambient pm collected in an urban area of mexicali , mexico .
methods : we studied il - 8 expression and regulatory signaling pathways in cultured haecs exposed to mexicali pm suspended in media for 0 - 4 hr. results : exposure resulted in a dose - dependent , 2 - to 8 - fold increase in il - 8 mrna expression relative to controls .
pm exposure induced il - 8 transcriptional activity in beas - 2b cells that was dependent on the nuclear factor - kappa b ( nf - kappab ) response element in the il - 8 promoter .
chromatin immunoprecipitation ( chip ) assays showed a 3 - fold increase in binding of the p65 ( rela ) nf - kappab isoform to the il - 8 promoter sequence in haecs exposed to pm. western blot analyses showed elevated levels of phosphorylation of p65 but no changes in ikappabalpha phosphorylation or degradation .
il - 8 expression was blunted in a dose - dependent manner in beas - 2b cells transduced with a lentivirus encoding a dominant negative p65 mutant in which phosphorylation sites were inactivated .
conclusion : taken together , these findings show that the increase in il - 8 mrna expression in haecs exposed to pm10 ( pm <= 10 mum in aerodynamic diameter ) is mediated through an nf - kappab - dependent signaling mechanism that occurs through a pathway involving direct phosphorylation of the transcription factor p65 in the absence of ikappabalpha degradation .
these data show that exposure to pm10 in ambient air can induce inflammatory responses by activating specific signaling mechanisms in haecs .
human airway epithelium interleukin - 8 nf - kappab particulate matter signal transduction epidemiological studies have demonstrated a positive association between levels of ambient particulate matter ( pm ) and mortality and morbidity ( dockery et al. 1993 ; samet et al. 2000 ) .
health effects associated with pm exposure include decreased pulmonary function , exacerbation of respiratory disease , and increased acute cardiovascular mortality ( pope 2000 ) .
in addition to pm concentration on a mass and number basis , physicochemical properties of the particles ( e.g. , chemical composition , surface area , size ) have been proposed as determinants of the adverse effects associated with pm inhalation ( schwarze et al. 2006 ) .
however , despite being the subject of more than a decade of study , the toxicological mechanisms underlying the health effects of pm inhalation are not well understood .
human airway epithelial cells ( haecs ) are a primary target for inhaled pm as well as a major source of inflammatory mediators in the lung , including the potent neutrophil chemoattractant interleukin - 8 ( il - 8 ) ( strieter 2002 ) , which plays an important role in pathogenic responses in the human lung .
elevated levels of il - 8 in the lung are a feature of a number of respiratory diseases , including cystic fibrosis , asthma , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( bonfield et al. 1995 ; gibson et al. 2001 ; yamamoto et al. 1997 ) .
increased expression of il - 8 , therefore , is a pivotal event in the pulmonary inflammatory response associated with disease states ( harada et al. 1994 ; zwahlen et al .
1993 ) and inhalation of ambient air contaminants ( ghio and devlin 2001 ; krishna et al. 1998 ; stenfors et al. 2004 ) .
il - 8 expression is regulated by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms under the control of multiple signaling pathways .
in addition to a ccaat box , regulatory elements have been identified in the 5 ' - flanking region of the il - 8 gene for multiple transcription factors , including glucocorticoid receptor , hepatocyte nuclear factor - 1 , interferon regulatory factor - 1 , activator protein - 1 ( ap - 1 ) , ccaat / enhancer binding protein beta ( c / ebpbeta ) , and nuclear factor - kappa b ( nf - kappab ) ( jung et al. 2002 ; mukaida et al. 1994 ) .
in addition , mrna stabilization can play a role in increased il - 8 expression ( silbajoris et al. 2009 ; sparkman and boggaram 2004 ) .
the transcription factor nf - kappab is the best - characterized regulator of il - 8 transcription in haecs .
nf - kappab functions as a heterogeneous collection of dimers composed of various combinations of five members of the nf - kappab family .
classical nf - kappab activation involves phosphorylation of the inhibitory subunit ikappabalpha on two n - terminal serine residues by ikappab kinases , rapidly followed by ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of ikappabalpha .
the p50 - p65 nf - kappab heterodimer is thereby released from the complex and translocates to the nucleus , where it binds to the nf - kappab response element , such as that found in the promoter region of the il - 8 gene ( karin and ben - neriah 2000 ) .
nf - kappab - dependent gene transcription is also regulated by serine or threonine phosphorylations or other modifications of the rel subunits that affect the transcription - activating function of nf - kappab ( neumann and naumann 2007 ) .
thus , nf - kappab - dependent gene transcription can be regulated by mechanisms that involve only nf - kappab transactivation in the absence of ikappab degradation and nf - kappab nuclear translocation ( bohuslav et al. 2004 ; neumann and naumann 2007 ; zhang et al. 2005 ) .
these ikappabalpha - independent pathways can involve posttranslational modifications of nf - kappab subunits , including site - specific phosphorylation of p65 ( neumann and naumann 2007 ) .
to characterize relevant mechanisms that lead to inflammatory responses to pm inhalation , we examined the activation of signaling events involved in il - 8 expression in a model of human airway epithelium exposed to pm obtained from mexicali , a city in mexico that experiences some of the highest pm levels in north america ( osornio - vargas et al. 2010 ) .
exposure of cultured haecs to pm <= 10 mum in aerodynamic diameter ( pm10 ) collected from mexicali ambient air induced nf - kappab - dependent transcriptional expression of il - 8 through an alternate signaling pathway involving direct phosphorylation of p65 .
materials and methods reagents and supplies .
we obtained tissue culture media and supplements from lonza ( walkersville , md , usa ) , costar tissue culture plates from corning ( corning , ny , usa ) , human recombinant tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnfalpha ) from peprotech ( rocky hill , nj , usa ) , and mg - 132 from calbiochem ( la jolla , ca , usa ) .
western blotting supplies were obtained from bio - rad laboratories ( hercules , ca , usa ) .
common laboratory reagents and supplies were obtained from sigma ( st. louis , mo , usa ) and fisher scientific ( raleigh , nc , usa ) .
cell culture .
after receiving informed consent from volunteers , we obtained haecs from normal adult human volunteers by brush biopsy of the mainstem bronchus during fiberoptic bronchoscopy ; this procedure was conducted under a protocol approved by the committee on the protection of the rights of human subjects at the university of north carolina at chapel hill .
haecs were cultured as previously described ( silbajoris et al. 2009 ) .
transformed human airway epithelial cells ( beas - 2b subclone s6 , passages 60 - 80 ) were grown on tissue culture plates in supplemented keratinocyte growth medium .
haecs and beas - 2b cells were growth factor - starved in unsupplemented media for 15 hr before pm exposure. pm .
pm2.5 ( pm <= 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter ) and pm10 size fractions were collected between october 2005 and march 2006 at urban and semiurban locations in mexicali , mexico ( osornio - vargas et al. 2010 ) .

pm suspensions were prepared by sonicating the recovered particles in supplement - free basal media in an ultrasonic water bath immediately before cell exposure .
plasmid construction and lentiviral vector production .
lentiviral transfer plasmids for human il - 8 wild - type ( il - 8wt ) and nf - kappab - site mutant ( il - 8m - nf - kappab ) luciferase reporters , as well as the nf - kappab tandem repeat ( nf - kappabtr ) luciferase reporter , have been previously described ( tal et al. 2010 ) .

3 - 4 and table 2 ( http :// dx.doi.org / 10.1289 / ehp.1103594 ) .
il - 8 promoter - reporter activity assay .
beas - 2b cells grown to 50 % confluency were transduced with lentiviral il - 8wt , il - 8m - nf - kappab , or nf - kappabtr for 72 hr with a multiplicity of infection ( moi ; number of viral particles per cell ) of 5 .
cells were cotransduced with ef1a _ egfp ( elongation factor 1 - alpha - enhanced green fluorescent protein ) to control for transduction efficiency .
transduced cells were changed to supplement - free media overnight and then exposed to mexicali urban pm10 at 40 mug / cm2 for 4 hr or to tnfalpha ( 20 ng / ml ) for 15 min .
because preliminary experiments showed that the presence of particles interfered with optical measurements of luminescence and fluorescence , promoter activity was assessed by measuring firefly luciferase ( fluc ) mrna levels in cdna generated from cell lysates .
chip ( chromatin immunoprecipitation ) assay .
haecs were changed to supplement - free media overnight and then exposed to mexicali urban pm10 at 40 mug / cm2 for 4 hr or to tnfalpha ( 20 ng / ml ) for 15 min .
we then performed a chip assay using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit ( upstate , charlottesville , va , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
briefly , protein - dna complexes were cross - linked with formaldehyde , cells were lysed and pelleted , and chromatin was sheared by sonication .
equal amounts of dna were precleared with salmon sperm dna / protein a agarose , and nf - kappab - bound dna fragments were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against nf - kappabp65 ( santa cruz biotechnology , santa cruz , ca , usa ) .
a sham immunoprecipitation using no antibody was used as a control .
the antibody - dna complex was captured with salmon sperm dna / protein a agarose , pelleted , and washed .
dna was eluted with te ( tris - edta ) buffer , and cross - linking was reversed with 5 m nacl at 65degreesc .
rt - pcr , employing primers and a fluorescent probe directed against the nf - kappab sequence in the il - 8 gene promoter region , was used to measure percentage of input , by comparing signals of chip samples and total input ( dna signal obtained by pcr amplification of samples taken before immunoprecipitation ) .
western blotting .
haecs were changed to supplement - free media overnight and then exposed to pm10 ( 40 mug / cm2 ) , tnfalpha ( 20 ng / ml ) , or media alone .
to measure expression levels of phosphorylated ikappabalpha ( p - ikappabalpha ) we pretreated haecs with the proteosomal inhibitor mg - 132 ( 20 mum ) .
protein extracts were subjected to sds - page .
each resulting blot was blocked with 5 % casein or bovine serum albumin and incubated with one of the following antibodies : anti - phosphorylated - nf - kappabp65 ( anti - p - nf - kappabp65 ; ser 536 ) , anti - nf - kappabp65 ( ser 536 ) , anti - p - ikappabalpha ( cell signaling , beverly , ma , usa ) , anti - ikappabalpha , or beta - actin ( santa cruz biotechnology ) .
after incubation with horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) conjugated goat anti - rabbit igg and hrp conjugated goat anti - mouse igg secondary antibodies ( santa cruz biotechnology ) , bands were detected using ecl chemiluminescence reagents ( amersham , piscataway , nj , usa ) and visualized using a fujifilm las - 3000 imaging system ( fujifilm , stamford , ct , usa ) .
inhibition of il - 8 transcription using ptred - cmv _ p65 triple mutant .
beas - 2b cells grown to 50 % confluency were transduced with the lentiviral ptred - cmv _ p65 triple mutant for 72 hr with an moi of 5 or 10 .
cells were changed to supplement - free media overnight and then exposed to mexicali urban pm10 at 40 mug / cm2 or media alone for 4 hr. levels of il - 8 mrna in cell lysates were measured using rt - pcr , normalized to levels of glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( gapdh ) mrna , and are expressed as fold increases over media control. statistics .
data are expressed as mean +/ - se from at least three independent experiments .
we performed data comparisons using one - way analysis of variance followed by dunnett 's post hoc test for multigroup comparisons .
two - tailed paired or unpaired student 's t - tests were used to evaluate differences between control and treated groups .
where results are presented as relative fold increases , statistics were performed using absolute data .
differences were assessed as significant when p <= 0.05 .
results exposure to pm induces il - 8 gene expression in haecs .
to determine the relative inflammatory potency of pm , we measured the expression of the proinflammatory gene il - 8 in haecs exposed to a range of concentrations of pm10 and pm2.5 collected from urban and semiurban locations in mexicali , mexico ( osornio - vargas et al. 2010 ) .
levels of il - 8 mrna increased in a dose - dependent manner after exposure to each particle type ( figure 1 ) .
exposure to 40 or 80 mug / cm2 of all pm types for 4 hr resulted in 3.9 - to 8 - fold increases in il - 8 mrna that were statistically significantly different from untreated controls .
incubation of pm10 with the lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) - binding polypeptide polymyxin b did not change its potency in inducing il - 8 expression .
moreover , addition of lps up to 1 mug / ml had no effect on il - 8 mrna levels in haecs ( data not shown ) .
we observed no statistically significant differences in potency between the various types / sources of pm ; thus , we selected pm10 from an urban location for further study .
a comparison of haecs and the beas - 2b human bronchial epithelial cell line showed similar responses to pm10 exposure and established the suitability of beas - 2b cells as a surrogate for haecs in this study ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 exposure to pm increases levels of il - 8 mrna .
haecs and beas - 2b cells were exposed to the indicated size fractions and concentrations of freshly suspended mexicali pm or to media alone for 4 hr. levels of il - 8 mrna in cell lysates were measured using rt - pcr ( taqman ; applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) , normalized to levels of gapdh mrna , and are expressed as fold increases over media control .
data are mean +/ - se ( n = > 3 ) .
* p < 0.05 .
pm10 - induced il - 8 expression involves nf - kappab - dependent transcriptional activity .
to identify the molecular mechanism responsible for pm - induced il - 8 expression , we measured the transcriptional activity of il - 8 wild - type ( il - 8wt - fluc ) and nf - kappab mutant ( il - 8m - nf - kappab - fluc ) reporter constructs expressed in beas - 2b cells exposed to pm10 using tnfalpha as a positive control for comparison .
preliminary experiments showed that the presence of particles interfered with optical measurements of luminescence and fluorescence .
therefore , we used fluc and egfp mrna levels measured by rt - pcr as readouts of the promoter activity .
exposures to 40 mug / cm2 pm10 for 4 hr resulted in statistically significant increases in promoter reporter activity in beas - 2b cells expressing the human wild - type il - 8 promoter .
in contrast , beas - 2b cells expressing an il - 8 promoter with a mutated nf - kappab response element showed no response to the same exposures ( figure 2 ) .
figure 2 pm - induced il - 8 transcription is nf - kappab dependent .
beas - 2b cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding il - 8wt - fluc , il - 8m - nf - kappab - fluc , or nf - kappabtr - fluc before exposure to urban ( u ) pm10 at 40 mug / cm2 for 4 hr , tnfalpha ( 20 ng / ml ) for 15 min , or media alone .
promoter activity was assessed by measuring levels of fluc mrna by rt - pcr .
fluc mrna levels were normalized to egfp mrna levels , and results are expressed as fold change over untreated controls .
data are mean +/ - se ( n = 3 ) .
* p < 0.05 .
as an independent measurement of nf - kappab - dependent transcriptional activity , we next used pm10 to stimulate beas - 2b cells transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding a luciferase reporter gene driven by a concatenated nf - kappab consensus sequence ( nf - kappabtr - fluc ) .
exposure to pm10 stimulated a statistically significant increase in nf - kappab - dependent transcriptional activity in beas - 2b cells ( figure 2 ) .
exposure to pm10 induces p65 binding to the nf - kappab response element in the il - 8 promoter .
next we investigated whether pm10 - induced il - 8 transcriptional activity is accompanied by a corresponding increase in transcription factor binding to nf - kappab response elements in the native il - 8 promoter in haecs exposed to pm10 .
chip analysis using an antibody directed to p65 followed by rt - pcr amplification of immunoprecipitated il - 8 promoter dna sequences containing the nf - kappab response elements showed that pm10 exposure resulted in a marked increase in p65 binding to the genomic il - 8 promoter in haec relative to media - exposed controls ( figure 3 ) .
as expected , treatment with tnfalpha induced a comparatively large increase in immunoprecipitated il - 8 promoter dna in haecs .
figure 3 pm10 induces nf - kappab binding to the il - 8 promoter in haecs .
haecs were exposed to pm10 ( 40 mug / cm2 ) for 4 hr , tnfalpha ( 20 ng / ml ) for 15 min , or media alone .
chip followed by rt - pcr was used to measure p65 binding to genomic il - 8 promoter sequences .
data are mean +/ - se ( n = 3 ) .
* p < 0.05 .
exposure to pm10 induces nf - kappab - dependent transcriptional activity that does not involve ikappabalpha phosphorylation and degradation .
phosphorylation and degradation of ikappabalpha are hallmark events in the activation of the canonical nf - kappab pathway .
therefore , we examined the effect of pm10 exposure on the phosphorylation and abundance of ikappabalpha in haecs .
western blotting analysis showed that acute challenge with tnfalpha induced a significant and rapid decrease in the intracellular concentration of ikappabalpha in haecs ( figure 4a ) .
in contrast , we observed no changes in levels of ikappabalpha in haecs exposed to 40 mug / cm2 pm10 for up to 1 hr. similarly , we detected an increase in the level of p - ikappabalpha in response to tnfalpha treatment , yet exposure to pm10 did not induce a change in p - ikappabalpha levels in haecs at any of the exposure time points examined ( figure 4b ) .
these results indicated that pm10 - induced nf - kappab transcriptional activity does not involve the canonical activation pathway .
figure 4 pm - induced nf - kappab activation does not involve the canonical pathway in haecs .
( a ) haecs were exposed to pm10 ( 40 mug / cm2 ) , tnfalpha ( 20 ng / ml ) , or media alone for 10 - 60 min , and lysates were subjected to western blotting using anti - ikappabalpha antibody .
( b ) haecs were pretreated for 30 min with 20 mum of proteosomal inhibitor mg - 132 and exposed to pm10 ( 40 mug / cm2 ) or media alone for 30 - 240 min or tnfalpha ( 20 ng / ml ) for 30 min ; cell lysates were immunoblotted using anti - p - ikappabalpha and anti - ikappabalpha antibodies .
data are representative of three or more experiments .
pm10 - induced transcriptional expression of il - 8 is dependent on phosphorylation of p65 .
phosphorylation of the nf - kappab subunit p65 at multiple serine sites has been reported to increase nf - kappab - dependent transcriptional activity in an ikappabalpha - independent manner in a number of cell types ( neumann and naumann 2007 ) .
therefore , we investigated whether nf - kappab activation in haecs exposed to pm10 occurs through phosphorylation of p65 .
densitometry of western blots showed a statistically significant 2 - fold increase in levels of phosphorylated p65 ( serine 536 ) after 30 min of exposure to 40 mug / ml pm10 that remained elevated for up to 4 hr of exposure ( figure 5 ) .
figure 5 exposure to pm10 induces nf - kappab activation through an alternate pathway in haecs .
( a ) cell lysates from haecs exposed to pm10 ( 40 mug / cm2 ) for 30 min to 4 hr or tnfalpha ( 20 ng / ml ) for 15 min were immunoblotted using antibodies to p - nf - kappabp65 ( ser 536 ) , nf - kappabp65 ( ser 536 ) , and beta - actin .
results are representative of three separate experiments .
( b ) densitometric quantitation of p - p65 band optical density .
data are mean +/ - se ( n = 3 ) .
* p < 0.05 .
we next investigated the functional link between p65 phosphorylation and the induction of il - 8 transcription in haecs exposed to pm10 .
beas - 2b cells were transduced with a retrovirus expressing a dominant negative p65 in which three major phosphorylation sites were eliminated by substituting alanines for serines 276 , 529 , and 536 .
rt - pcr analyses showed that , relative to control cells , pm10 - induced il - 8 expression was blunted in beas - 2b cells in which p65 serine phosphorylation was prevented ( figure 6 ) .
figure 6 il - 8 transcription induced by pm10 requires p65 phosphorylation .
beas - 2b cells transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding ptred - cmv _ p65 at an moi of 5 or 10 , in which serines 276 , 529 , and 536 were mutated to alanines , were exposed to pm10 ( 40 mug / cm2 ) or media alone for 4 hr. levels of il - 8 mrna in lysates were measured using rt - pcr , normalized to levels of gapdh mrna , and expressed as fold increases over media control .
data are mean +/ - se ( n = 3 ) .
* p < 0.05 , compared with the untransduced control .
discussion although the association of ambient air pm exposure with cardiopulmonary health effects is well established ( peters et al. 2001 ; wellenius et al .
2005 ) , the mechanisms by which inhaled pm exerts such deleterious effects remain unclear .
as a primary target of inhaled pollutants , the airway epithelium is capable of initiating or supplementing pulmonary inflammatory defenses by synthesizing a number of mediators that can recruit and activate inflammatory cells , thereby promoting inflammation that is thought to culminate in cardiovascular dysfunction ( bai et al. 2007 ) .
our group has reported inflammatory mediator expression by haecs exposed to a variety of pm components , including diesel exhaust ( tal et al. 2010 ) , zinc ions ( kim et al. 2006 ; wu et al. 2010 ) , and ultrafine elemental carbon ( kim et al. 2005 ) .
in the present study , we enhance the environmental relevance of these observations by showing that a " real - world " pm sample induces il - 8 expression through activation of a specific physiological pathway involving an alternate nf - kappab activation mechanism .
several studies have established phosphorylation of p65 as an alternate mechanism leading to the activation of nf - kappab - dependent transcriptional activity in response to physiological stimuli such as growth factors , gasotransmitters , and cytokines ( bijli et al. 2008 ; chantome et al. 2004 ; kai et al. 2009 ; reber et al. 2009 ; zhang et al. 2005 ) .
p65 phosphorylation is also involved in nf - kappab activation induced by lps , oncogenic viral infection , and cellular transformation ( chen and harrison 2005 ; doyle et al. 2005 ; hu et al. 2004 ) .
the mechanisms of action of silica ( kang et al. 2006 ) and the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma ligand ciglitazone ( chen and harrison 2005 ) , both xenobiotics that induce nf - kappab activation , have been shown to include p65 phosphorylation .
in addition , we previously reported that divalent zinc induces il - 8 expression through an nf - kappab - dependent mechanism that involves serine - specific phosphorylation of p65 in beas - 2b cells ( kim et al. 2007 ) .
however , in contrast to the data we show in the present study , zinc also induced ikappabalpha phosphorylation , albeit without inducing its degradation ( kim et al. 2007 ) .
we have also reported that ultrafine carbon particles induce il - 8 expression in haecs through a mechanism that involves p38 activation , without involvement of nf - kappab ( kim et al. 2005 ) .
it is possible that the signaling difference seen between ultrafine carbon particles and mexicali pm is evidence that multiple mechanisms exist in haecs for the induction of il - 8 expression in response to a broad range of inhaled xenobiotic materials .
it is noteworthy that oxidant stress is a critical event in the toxicity of each of these agents ( atarod and kehrer 2004 ; beck - speier et al. 2005 ; ghio et al. 1992 ) .
oxidant - induced loss of signaling quiescence , possibly involving inhibition of phosphatases that oppose the activating effect of kinases that phosphorylate p65 , is a common feature in the toxicity of diverse groups of chemical agents ( samet and tal 2010 ) .
therefore , although the upstream mechanisms that initiate p65 phosphorylation induced by pm10 have not been identified , it is possible to hypothesize that an oxidant - dependent event is involved .
moreover , although a ligand - mediated activation of a receptor - initiated signaling event cannot be ruled out as a contributing mechanism , the prolonged time course of mexicali - induced nf - kappab activation and il - 8 expression is consistent with a permissive process such as phosphatase inhibition as an initiating signaling event .
a diverse array of kinases has been implicated in the phosphorylation of p65 , including ikkbeta ( ikappab kinase beta ) ( kang et al. 2006 ) , pkczeta ( protein kinase czeta ) ( kai et al. 2009 ) , btk ( bruton 's tyrosine kinase ) ( doyle et al. 2005 ) , ckii ( casein kinase ii ) ( chantome et al. 2004 ) , rsk1 ( ribosomal s6 kinase 1 ) ( bohuslav et al. 2004 ) , syk ( spleen tyrosine kinase ) ( bijli et al .
2008 ) , msk1 ( mitogen - and stress - activated protein kinase 1 ) ( reber et al .
2009 ) , and pi3k ( phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ) ( liu et al. 2008 ) .
we have observed that pharmacological inhibition of pi3k failed to block pm10 - induced il - 8 expression , implying that the pi3k - phosphatase and tensin homolog ( pten ) pathway is not involved .
separately , we also determined that inhibition of mek ( map kinase - erk kinase ) , jnk ( jun - n - terminal kinase ) , p38 kinase , and the src tyrosine kinases p56lck , p59fynt , and hck failed to block pm10 - induced il - 8 expression ( silbajoris r , unpublished data ) .
given the number of pathways that are known to lead to p65 phosphorylation , our finding that pm10 - induced gene expression does not involve canonical activation of nf - kappab will require detailed follow - up study in order to identify the upstream kinase ( s ) involved , as well as the proximal event that leads to p65 phosphorylation in response to pm10 .
such studies will expand the results presented here and further elucidate the mechanisms through which inflammatory responses are regulated in the airway epithelium after inhalation of pm10 .
the pm10 sample we used in this study was obtained from mexicali , mexico , a semirural border city afflicted with high levels of inhalable pm derived from both combustion and geological sources .
previous studies on mexicali pm have associated particle size with specific chemical composition , source , and biological effects ( mendoza et al. 2010 ; osornio - vargas et al. 2010 ) .
however , in the present study , pm2.5 and pm10 collected in urban and semiurban locations in mexicali were of comparable potency in inducing il - 8 expression in haecs .
further , pharmacological inhibition of nf - kappab activation abrogated il - 8 expression induced by each of the mexicali particles used in this study ( silbajoris r , unpublished data ) .
these results suggest that a property these particles have in common is responsible for their inflammogenicity .
considering that these materials were collected from ambient air , it is not surprising that analyses showed significant endotoxin levels associated with each of the mexicali particles , raising the possibility that lps contributes to their bioactivity .
however , endotoxin activates the canonical nf - kappab pathway , and we did not observe such activation with the mexicali particles .
moreover , haecs are known to express very low levels of endotoxin receptors ( becker et al .
2000 ) , and we have previously reported that endotoxin levels far in excess of those presented to the cells in this study resulted in only minimal induction of il - 8 expression by haecs ( silbajoris et al. 2009 ) .
in the present study , we confirmed those findings and determined that an endotoxin - binding polypeptide ( polymyxin b ) does not affect the potency of pm10 in inducing haec il - 8 gene expression .
thus , the toxicity of mexicali pm is attributable to other chemical components associated with these particles. of the metals that are present in mexicali pm10 [ see supplemental material , table 1 ( http :// dx.doi.org / 10.1289 / ehp.1103594 )] , only zinc has been reported to induce nf - kappab activation that involves p65 phosphorylation ( kim et al .
2007 ) , albeit at concentrations considerably higher than the submicromolar concentrations used in the present study .
although the considerable chemical and physical complexity that characterizes ambient pm prevents a ready identification of bioactive components and sources in this mechanistic study , the results presented here nonetheless provide insight into the contribution of proinflammatory processes in the lung to the toxicity of pm inhalation .
further , these findings lend biological plausibility in support of epidemiological reports of the adverse public health impact of pm exposure .

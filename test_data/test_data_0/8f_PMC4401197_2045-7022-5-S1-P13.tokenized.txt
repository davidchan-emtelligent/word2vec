skin rashes are the most common adverse reaction to this drug that typically develop in the first 8 weeks of treatment .
case presentation a 27 - year - old caucasian woman treated with ltg 25 mg po for a depressive episode was hospitalized in our allergy clinic with highly pruritic maculopapular eruption ( mpe ) , affecting her abdomen , chest , back and forearms , which had started 2 days earlier along with fever of 37.5 ( o ) c. a well - defined red dermographism and tenderness of the skin was observed .
she had been prescribed ltg 8 days before the symptoms commenced .
a ltg - induced drug rash was suspected and the offending drug was therefore withdrawn .
the patient was prescribed methylprednisolone 60 mg / d iv , bilastine 2x20 mg / d po , and chloropyramine 25 mg im in the evening .
topical skin care with emollients was started , as well .
all blood and urine laboratory tests were within reference ranges except for the hscrp of 9.6 mg / l ( reference values up to 5 mg / l ) .
abdominal ultrasonography was performed and was unremarkable .
the lesions subsided 7 days after starting the treatment .
the patient was discharged with a prescription for methylprednisolone 20 mg / d po , bilastine 20 mg / d po and topical emollient skin care .
13 days later a new flare - up of mpe occurred .
again , laboratory tests were normal .
the patient was prescribed methylprednisolone 40 mg / d iv , bilastine 2x20 mg / d po and emollients .
the eruption sustained for 3 weeks with frequent flare - ups .
the corticosteroids' regimen was adapted promptly with step downs and ups in order to maintain the severity of the symptoms .
antihistamines and emollients helped releive the subjective symptoms .
conclusion mpe due to ltg is a common drug - induced hypersensitivity reaction .
this reaction is generally mild .
however , reactions should be monitored closely as they can be refractory and relapsing .
this case presentation provides evidence that challenge tests should be performed at least 2 months after the discontinuation of the suspected drug , for there is a risk of false - positive reactions due to subsiding flare - ups .
consent written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this abstract and any accompanying images .

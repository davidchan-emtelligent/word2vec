it has been suggested that actors co - represent a shared task context when they perform a task in a joint fashion .
the present study examined the possibility of co - representation in joint task switching , in which two actors shared two tasks that switched randomly across trials .
experiment 1 showed that when an actor performed the tasks individually , switch costs were obtained if the actors responded on the previous trial ( go trial ) , but not if they did not respond ( no - go trial ) .
when two actors performed the tasks jointly , switch costs were obtained if the actor responded on the previous trial ( actor - repeat trials ) but not if the co - actor responded ( actor - switch trials ) .
in experiment 2 , a single actor performed both tasks of the joint condition to test whether the findings of experiment 1 were due to the use of different response sets by the two actors .
switch costs were obtained for both repetitions and alternations of the response set , which rules out this possibility .
taken together , our findings provided little support for the idea that actors co - represent the task sets of their co - actors .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer - verlag gmbh germany 2017 introduction there are numerous occasions in everyday activities for which two or more individuals need to perform a task cooperatively to achieve a common goal .
in such situations , the labor required to perform the shared task must be divided between co - acting individuals .
for instance , a person may drive a car while another navigates the driver in an unfamiliar neighborhood .
the driver is concerned with the operations of the vehicle and the traffic condition , whereas the navigator is concerned with the current location of the vehicle and the selection of the correct route to the destination .
given that each actor possesses only an incomplete picture of the whole task context , how can they achieve a common goal that requires information from both actors ?
traditional approaches suggest that the actions of one actor can become stimuli to trigger the actions of the other , and vice versa , until the shared goal is achieved .
however , a recent approach has suggested a more far - reaching possibility that co - actors do not only represent the shared goal , but also co - represent the entire task that includes both the actor 's own context and the co - actor 's context ( sebanz , knoblich , & prinz , 2003 ; knoblich , butterfill , & sebanz , 2011 ). by doing so , each co - actor would represent a given task in the same fashion , which implies that each co - actor would represent the task - related stimulus - response mappings not only for his or her own part of the task , but also for the part of the co - acting other's. previous research has provided evidence for the assumption that jointly performing a task leads to the representation of at least some aspects of a co - actor 's contributions to the task .
the most systematic findings pertaining to this issue have been obtained by means of the joint simon task ( sebanz et al. , 2003 ) .
in a standard , individual simon task , participants press a left or right key in response to non - spatial features of a stimulus that is presented randomly to the left or right of some reference point ( e.g. , the fixation mark on the monitor ) .
even though stimulus location is irrelevant to selecting the correct responses , responses are faster and more accurate if the stimulus location coincides with the response location than if it does not , which is termed the simon effect ( lu & proctor , 1995 ; yamaguchi & proctor , 2012 ) .
in the joint version of the task , the two responses are divided among two co - acting participants , such that one actor responds to one of the relevant stimulus features ( e.g. , red stimuli ) and the other actor responds to the other stimulus features ( green stimuli ) .
note that this renders the task essentially a go / no - go task , which does not yield a simon effect in the absence of a co - actor ( hommel , 1996 ) .
in the presence of a co - actor who operates the other key , a reliable simon effect is observed ( sebanz et al. , 2003 ) , which is thus termed the joint simon effect .
given that the simon effect is attributed to response - selection processes ( lu & proctor , 1995 ; hommel , 2011 ) , the joint simon effect demonstrates that participants take into consideration the active contributions of their co - actor when selecting their responses .
research has begun to determine in more detail which aspects of the co - actor 's contributions to the task are considered in the process of response selection .
earlier approaches assumed that the impact of the co - actor 's contributions on response selection is automatic ( sebanz et al. , 2003 ; sebanz , knoblich , & prinz , 2005 ) and only occurs with human co - actors ( e.g. , tsai , kuo , hung & tzeng , 2008 ) , which has been taken to demonstrate the " social nature of perception and action " ( knoblich & sebanz , 2006 ) .
more recent studies have shown that the joint simon effect is sensitive to the relationship between the two co - actors , so that its presence or size depends on whether this relationship is positive or negative ( hommel , colzato & van den wildenberg , 2009 ) , competitive or cooperative ( ruys & aarts , 2010 ) , or more or less empathic ( ford & aberdein , 2015 ) , and whether the co - actors are perceived to belong to the same social group ( aquino et al. , 2015 ; constantini & ferri , 2013 ; iani , anelli , nicoletti , arcuri , & rubichi , 2011 ; mcclung , jentzsch & reicher , 2013 ) .
these observations suggest that the joint simon effect relies on particular social factors , although they do not necessarily support a strong claim that all perception - action processes are inevitably social in nature ( see dolk et al. , 2014 , for a review ) .
moreover , a reliable joint simon effect is obtained not only with human or anthropomorphized non - human co - actors ( muller et al. , 2011 ) , but also with a salient inanimate object such as a japanese waving cat or a ticking metronome that is presented in the place of a co - actor ( dolk , hommal , colzato , prinz & liepelt , 2011 ) .
although these findings do not warrant a strong claim that co - actors fully share their entire task experience , the findings would arguably allow for a more parsimonious interpretation of task sharing that an actor represents the actions of , or even the stimulus - response relationships followed by , a co - actor .
it is possible that participants represent not only the stimuli that they need to respond to ( which in some sense already implies some knowledge about the stimuli they need to ignore ) and the responses that they need to carry out , but also the activities that their co - actor carries out .
this might be because it allows the better monitoring of turn taking in a joint task ( liefooghe , 2016 ; wenke et al. , 2011 ) , or because the presence of another event , such as the co - actor 's activities , reintroduces an event representation against which the instructed event ( one 's own action ) needs to be selected ( dolk et al. , 2014 ) .
it is even possible that people represent the associations between stimuli and responses for both one 's own and the other 's actions , as this would allow one to predict actions from stimuli .
such associations are commonly assumed to constitute the basis of task sets , which would suggest that people do represent at least the basic ingredients of the task set of a co - actor ( knoblich et al. , 2011 ) .
the present study aimed to disentangle these two possibilities by means of a joint task - switching setting .
in regular , individual task - switching settings , participants alternate between two or more tasks that differ with respect to the assignment of responses to stimuli .
responses are commonly faster if the task on the current trial is the same as the preceding trial ( repeat trial ) than if it is different ( switch trial ) - - the so - called switch cost ( for reviews , see kiesel et al. , 2010 ; vandierendonck , liefooghe , & verbruggen , 2010 ) .
switch costs are likely to reflect a larger number of processes , including the extra time needed to reconfigure the task set on switch trials ( meiran , 1996 ) , interference from no longer relevant but still lingering previous task sets ( allport , styles , & hsieh , 1994 ) , priming in case of a repeated task cue ( logan & bundesen , 2003 ) , and the residual switch costs that remain even after a long preparation time ( rogers & monsell , 1995 ) .
consider how switch costs might be affected by having tasks being shared by two co - actors .
the most obvious prediction from a shared task set account ( knoblich et al. , 2011 ) would be that switch costs should be the same irrespective of whether the previous trial was carried out by the participant or a co - actor .
previous studies do not provide unequivocal evidence for this possibility .
to date , three studies have looked into joint task switching ( dudarev & hassin , 2016 ; liefooghe , 2016 ; wenke et al. , 2011 ) .
two of these studies had two actors perform two different tasks with the relevant actor being cued randomly from trial to trial ( dudarev & hassin , 2016 ; liefooghe , 2016 ) .
whereas this design implies confounding between task switching and turn taking ( i.e. , switching the actor implied switching the task , and vice versa ) , the idea was that switch trials should produce worse performance than repeat trials only if the participant actively represents the co - actor 's task .
thus , the presence of switch costs after co - actor 's trials would indicate shared task representations .
dudarev and hassin ( 2016 ) obtained significant switch costs in such a joint condition , but not in a control condition for which individual participants carried out the same go / no - go task without a co - actor .
the researchers also found no switch costs in another control condition for which both actors worked on the same task .
the results were taken to argue against the possibility that turn taking itself could have been responsible for the measured switch costs .
unfortunately , however , the same task versus different task manipulation was carried out between groups , which might have affected the representation of the other agent .
a co - actor who performs the same task as oneself may be perceived as more similar to oneself ( hommel et al. , 2009 ) than a co - actor who performs a different task .
perceived self - other similarity has been demonstrated to facilitate " feature migration " between self and other ( ma , sellaro , lippelt & hommel , 2016 ) , in the sense that features that actually relate to the other are perceived as part of oneself .
thus , it may be that switching is more demanding between actors that are perceived to be more different , producing switch costs in the different task conditions but not in the same task condition .
this explanation would not require the assumption of task sharing .
it may also be that participants monitor the stimulus - response contingencies of the co - actor 's trials ( liefooghe , 2016 ) , which would necessarily lead to more violations of the rules the participant is storing for his or her own performance if the co - actor 's task is different , especially when the same stimuli are mapped to different responses for two co - actors ( as was the case in dudarev and hassin 's study ) .
such violations might have increased the dissimilarities between the co - actors , making it more difficult to perform the task after the co - actor 's trial .
a very similar study was carried out by liefooghe ( 2016 ) , who also had co - actors carry out different tasks .
the study aimed to separate three different components of switch costs : ( a ) the efficiency of task preparation , as measured by the reduction of switch costs if more preparation time is available ; ( b ) the interference from the previous task set , as measured by the reduction of switch costs if the interval between the previous response and the next task cue increases ; and ( c ) the residual switch costs that remain after the longest preparation time .
interestingly , neither task preparation nor interference from the previous task was sensitive to task / actor switches , which according to the author rules out that participants truly represented the co - actor 's task set .
in contrast , residual switch costs were increased with task / actor switches , an effect that liefooghe attributed to the requirement to identify the relevant actor in this condition .
this interpretation would also account for the findings of dudarev and hassin ( 2016 ) , as would the aforementioned possibility that exposure to different stimulus - response contingencies increases cognitive conflict .
whereas the studies of dudarev and hassin ( 2016 ) and liefooghe ( 2016 ) can be taken to investigate the effects of actor switching , wenke et al .
( 2011 , experiment 2 ) discuss an unpublished study that assessed the impact of task switching more directly .
this study sought to separate the effects of actor switching in task switching by having two actors perform the same two tasks ( e.g. , color discrimination and shape discrimination ) .
a task and an actor were randomly cued on each trial , so that only one actor performed on a given trial , just as in the studies of dudarev and hassin ( 2016 ) and liefooghe ( 2016 ) .
this joint go / no - go ( i.e. , actor no switch and switch ) condition was compared to an individual go / no - go condition , in which a single actor performed the same task with the actor cue serving a go / no - go cue ( i.e. , ' respond ' vs. ' not respond ') .
there were switch costs after go trials and no switch costs after no - go trials in the individual condition , which replicated a standard observation ( e.g. , schuch & koch , 2003 ) .
the crucial question was whether the same pattern could be observed in the joint condition .
if the actor repeats ( i.e. , in go trials ) , one would expect standard switch costs , as the participant would need to reconfigure his or her own cognitive system .
more diagnostic data came from the actor - switch trials , as these followed no - go trials .
if participants represent the co - actor 's task set just like their own ( knoblich et al. , 2011 ) , one would expect switch costs of the same size as in trials following go trials , so that switching costs should be independent from actor switch .
if they do not represent the co - actor 's task set , however , one would expect no switch costs just as in the individual condition .
wenke et al .
( 2011 ) report that the same pattern was found in individual and joint conditions , with significant switch costs for actor repetitions but not for actor switches .
while this would arguably be rather strong evidence against the shared representation of task sets , the respective study has not yet been published and the brief description presented in wenke et al. ' s ( 2011 ) review article does not allow for strong and far - reaching claims .
to test whether the necessary evidence could be provided , experiment 1 of the present study conceptually replicated and extended the experiments discussed by wenke and colleagues , which allowed us to avoid the problems associated with the two actor - switching studies of dudarev and hassin ( 2016 ) and liefooghe ( 2016 ) .
note that in experiment 1 , actor switching was de - confounded from task switching , but was still confounded with switching of response set because two co - actors used different sets of response keys .
experiment 2 examined the effect of switching response sets on task switch costs by having a single participant perform both tasks of the joint condition using the two response sets that were assigned to two co - actors in experiment 1 .
if the same task set is used to perform the same task with different response sets , switch costs should be obtained regardless of whether the response set is switched .
such outcomes would reinforce the interpretation of experiment 1 , especially if switch costs are found to depend on actor switching .
experiment 1 in experiment 1 , pairs of individuals performed a cued task - switching paradigm , in which a task cue unpredictably signaled one of two tasks ( color or shape task ) on each trial .
the actors used two different sets of two response keys each to respond to the target stimuli .
in the joint condition , one of the actors was also cued at target onset , and only the cued actor responded while the other did not perform .
in the individual condition , the procedure was identical , except that one of the actors did not perform throughout an entire block , so no one responded on trials for which the active actor was not cued .
it was expected that in the individual condition , switch costs should be obtained on trials that followed go trials , but not on trials that followed no - go trials ( schuch & koch , 2003 ) .
if task sets are co - represented by the co - acting participants in the joint condition , there should be switch costs on trials that followed the co - actor 's trial as well as on trials that followed the actor 's own trial .
if not , the outcome should be comparable for joint and individual conditions , with switch costs being present in trials following go trials but not in trials following no - go trials .
note that wenke et al. ' s conclusion relied on the null effect including only 16 participants in each of the two versions of the experiment .
we used a larger sample size ( n = 56 ) to increase the statistical power1 so that small effects could be detected .
moreover , none of the previous studies included multiple task cues for each task , so the contribution of cue priming was not dissociated from that of task switching ( logan & bundesen , 2003 ). by including multiple task cues , we could examine whether the actors pay attention to some aspects of the co - actor 's task context if not to the entire context , as recently suggested in a different joint task setting ( janczyk , welsh , & dolk , 2016 ) .
thus , we included three types of transitions , cue - repeat trial ( both the task cue and the task repeated ) , cue - switch trial ( the task cue switched , but the task repeated ) , and task - switch trial ( both the task cue and the task switched ) .
each transition occurred in one - third of the trials .
the difference between cue - repeat and cue - switch trials reflected a cue - switch cost , and the difference between cue - switch and task - switch trials reflected a task - switch cost .
we expected no task - switch cost on trials following no - go trials in the individual and joint conditions , as in wenke et al. ' s report .
it was still possible to obtain cue - switch costs in the joint condition , because the task cue appeared before the actor cue , so both actors would have to encode the task cue on every trial .
if so , the encoded task cue would remain in short - term memory and facilitate cue encoding on the next trial ( logan & bundesen , 2003 ) , facilitating responding when the same task cue repeats .
method participants fifty - six undergraduate students at edge hill university participated in the present study ( 49 females , 7 males ; mean age 18.79 , sd 1.41 , range 18 - 24 ) .
they were recruited from an introductory psychology module and received experimental credits toward the module or paid pound3 for participation .
all reported having normal color vision and normal or corrected - to - normal visual acuity .
they were naive as to the purpose of the experiment .
apparatus and stimuli the apparatus consisted of a personal computer and a 23 - in widescreen monitor .
stimuli were green and red squares ( 4.8 cm in side ) and diamonds ( the squares tilted 45degrees ) , which appeared at the center of the screen .
the task cues were " colour " and " hue " for the color task , and " shape " and " form " for the shape task .
the task cues were presented in the courier new font at 36 - pt. they appeared 6.8 cm above the screen center .
the actor cue was the letter " a " ( to indicate the actor on the left ) and " b " ( to indicate the actor on the right ) .
the cue was superimposed on diamonds and squares , in the arial font at 40 - pt in white ; as the background was also white , it appears as if there was a letter - shaped hole in the stimulus .
responses were registered by pressing keys on a qwerty desktop keyboard .
procedure the experiment was conducted in two computer labs with 24 seats arranged in four rows of six computers each .
the distance between two adjacent computers was about 160 cm. there were at most three pairs in each row ; each pair of participants was seated in front of a computer monitor and at every other computer to avoid cluttering between pairs .
participants from different seminar groups were assigned to pairs randomly by the experimenter .
each pair of participant read on - screen instructions , which emphasized both the speed and accuracy of the response .
participants who sat on the left side placed their left and right index fingers on the ' z ' and ' c ' keys , respectively ; those who sat on the right side placed their left and right index fingers on the ' 1 ' and ' 3 ' keys on the numerical keypad on the right side of the keyboard .
for both participants , the ' z ' and ' 1 ' keys were called the left response , and the ' c ' and ' 3 ' keys were the right response .
each participant was instructed to press the left key for one color and the right key for the other color for the color task , and the left key or one shape and the right key or the other shape for the shape task ; the mappings between the keys and the colors and shapes were randomly determined for each pair .
each participant performed two joint blocks , for which one participant responded to a subset of stimuli and another to another subset of stimuli , and one individual block , for which one participant responded to stimuli and another participant remained silent .
thus , there were two joint blocks and two individual blocks for each pair .
each block consisted of 120 test trials , and there was a block of 16 practice trials before the first joint blocks and before each of the two individual blocks ( one for each actor ) .
for some pairs , two joint blocks were administered first and then two individual blocks ; for other pairs , two individual blocks were administered first and then two joint blocks .
the order of the joint and individual blocks was determined randomly for each pair .
within the individual blocks , the order of the actor performing the block was also determined randomly .
in the joint block , each trial started with a task cue that stayed on the screen for 450 ms , followed by a 50 - ms blank screen .
the imperative stimulus ( colored square or diamond ) appeared for 2000 ms or until a response was made , along with the actor cue that was superimposed on the imperative stimulus .
if the correct response was made , a blank display replaced the stimulus and lasted for 1000 ms ; otherwise , an error message was presented for 1000 ms. the message was " error !" for an incorrect response and " faster !" for no response .
if a wrong actor responded , the message was " not your turn !" the next trial started with another task cue .
response time ( rt ) was measured as the interval between the onset of the imperative stimulus and a depression of a response key .
the individual block was essentially the same , but participants were required to respond only when the actor cue indicated their trials ( go trials ) but withhold responding when the actor cue indicated their co - actor 's trials ( no - go trials ) .
if no response was made on a go trial , the error message was " respond !" if a response was made on a no - go trial , the error message was " do n't respond !" there was a 2000 - ms window to respond on each trial .
design the experiment involved two conditions , joint and individual conditions , which defined the factor task condition .
both conditions consisted of three types of task sequences ( cue repeat , cue switch , and task switch ) , which defined the factor task sequence .
cue repeat referred to the condition for which the same task cue occurred on two successive trials ( e.g. , " shape " on trial n , and " shape " again on trial n + 1 ) ; cue switch referred to the condition for which the two different task cues assigned to the same task occurred on two successive trials ( e.g. , " shape " on trial n , and " form " on trial n + 1 ) ; and task switch referred to the condition for which two different task cues assigned to different tasks occurred on two successive trials ( e.g. , " shape " on trial n , and " hue " on trial n + 1 ) .
trials were determined randomly on each trial , so that there was an equal probability of 33 % for each sequence type .
in the individual condition , previous trials could be go or no - go trials ; in the joint condition , previous trials could be performed by the same actor as the current trial ( actor repeat ) or by a different actor ( actor switch ) .
the factor previous trial was defined as to whether the same actor responded to stimuli on the previous trial ( go trials in the individual condition and actor - repeat trials in the joint condition ) or did not ( no - go trials in the individual condition and actor - switch trials in the joint condition ) .
previous trial and task sequence were manipulated orthogonally .
results trials were excluded from analyses if rt was less than 200 ms , if no response was made within the 2000 - ms window , or if a wrong actor responded ( 4.44 % of all trials ) .
among the remaining trials , the overall error rate was ( 25.31 %) , which is higher than typical task - switching experiments with single actors .
this is reasonable given the complexity of the task .
also , participants did not receive extensive practice with the task before the test trials , which might have contributed to increasing the overall error rates .
due to the high error rates , trials that followed an error trial were not excluded to retain as many trials as possible ( the data were also analyzed after excluding trials following an error trial , but the results are consistent with those reported below ) .
one female participant was excluded from the analysis due to an empty case in one of the conditions .
mean rts and percentages of error trials ( pe ) were computed for each participant and submitted to 2 ( task condition : joint vs. individual ) x 3 ( task sequence : task switch vs. cue switch vs. cue repeat ) x 2 ( previous trial ) anovas .
all factors were within - subject variables .
the anova results are summarized in table 1 .

a significant main effect of previous trial revealed that responses were also faster if the previous trial was a go trial ( m = 795 ms ) or the actor 's own trial ( m = 753 ms ) than if the previous trial was a no - go trial ( m = 872 ms ) or the co - actor 's trial ( m = 823 ms ) .
a main effect of task sequence was also significant , and the factor interacted with previous trial .
post hoc tests ( bonferroni adjusted2 ) compared rts for cue - repeat , cue - switch , and task - switch trials to clarify the interaction .
when the same actor responded on the previous trial , rt was shorter for cue - repeat trials ( m = 732 ms ) than for cue - switch trials ( m = 784 ms , p = 0.004 ) and for task - switch trials ( m = 806 ms , p < 0.001 ) , whereas the latter two did not differ ( p = 0.390 ) .
however , when the same actor did not respond on the previous trial ( i.e. , when the previous trial was no - go in the individual condition or when it was the co - actor 's trial in the joint condition ) , no switch costs emerged ( ms = 852 ms for cue repeat , 843 ms for cue switch , and 847 ms for task switch ; all ps = 1 ) .
although the three - way interaction among previous trial , task sequence , and task condition was far from significant , we also compared the three trial types in terms of previous trial separately for the individual and joint conditions for clarity .
in the individual condition , when the previous trial was a go trial , rt was shorter for cue - repeat trials ( m = 742 ms ) than for cue - switch trials ( m = 819 ms ; p = 0.038 ) and for task - switch trials ( m = 823 ms ; p = 0.002 ) , whereas the latter did not differ ( p = 1 ) .
when the previous trial was a no - go trial , there were no differences among the three task sequences ( ms = 883 ms , 857 , ms , 876 ms , for cue - repeat , cue - switch , and task - switch trials ; all ps = 1 ) .
in the joint condition , when the previous trial was the actor 's own trial , rt was shorter for cue - repeat trials ( m = 722 ms ) than task - switch trials ( m = 788 ms ; p < 0.001 ) and tended to be shorter for cue - repeat trials than for cue - switch trials ( m = 749 ms ; p = 0.073 ) and for cue - switch trials than for task - switch trials ( p = 0.071 ) .
most importantly , when the previous trial was the co - actor 's trial , rt did not differ for these trials ( ms = 821 , 830 , and 818 ms , for cue - repeat , cue - switch , and task - switch trials , respectively ; all ps = 1 ) .
percentages of error trials the pe results were consistent with the rt results , except that a main effect of task condition was not significant .
a significant main effect of previous trial revealed that pe was smaller when the same actor responded on the previous trial ( m = 23.73 %) than when the actor did not respond ( m = 27.60 %) .
task sequence produced a main effect , and it also interacted with previous trial .
when the same actor responded on the previous trial , task switch produced a larger pe ( m = 30.40 % , p < 0.001 ) than did cue repeat ( m = 20.16 % , p < 0.001 ) or cue switch ( m = 20.64 %) , whereas the latter two did not differ ( p = 1 ) .
when the actor did not respond on the previous trial , there were no differences among the three sequences ( ms = 26.72 % for cue repeat , 27.00 % for cue switch , and 29.08 % for task switch ; all ps > 0.4 ) .
as in rt , task condition did not modulate these outcomes .
discussion as expected , switch costs were obtained in the individual condition when the preceding trial was a go trial , but not when it was a no - go trial .
importantly , switch costs were also obtained in the joint condition when the preceding trial was the actor 's own trial ( actor repeat ) , but not when it was the co - actor 's trial ( actor switch ) .
note that go / no - go signals appeared with the target after the presentation of a task cue , so task preparation would have occurred on each trial , but response selection might have been restricted to go trials ( schuch & koch , 2003 ) .
this is consistent with the assumption that the actors in the present experiment did not select a response on their co - actors' trials as if these trials were their own ( wenke et al. , 2011 ) , which is not consistent with the idea that the task set of the co - actor was co - represented ( knoblich et al. , 2011 ) .
furthermore , the inclusion of multiple task cues for each task did not show any evidence that task cue priming facilitated responding after no - go or the co - actor 's trials .
this is an interesting outcome .
cue repetition is thought to allow the actors to retain the previous task cue in short - term memory and facilitate cue encoding on the current trial ( logan & bundesen , 2003 ) .
the task cue appeared before the actor cue in the present experiment , so the actors would need to encode the task cue on every trial .
the lack of cue switch costs after no - go trials indicates that the encoded task cue was discarded from short - term memory during the co - actor 's trial .
one possibility is that the representation of the given task cue was bound to either one 's own no - go reaction ( cf. , kuhn & brass , 2010 ) or to the other agent .
repeating a cue could then have retrieved this ( now misleading ) binding , which would be expected to create conflict ( hommel , 2004 ) and might have counteracted possible priming benefits .
in any case , this effect does not support co - representation of co - actor 's task sets either .
it is also interesting to note that participants made relatively fewer errors to interpret the actor cue (< 5 %) and the majority of errors was due to misapplications of wrong stimulus - response mappings (~ 25 %) .
these outcomes may reflect a hierarchical structure of cognitive processes , whereby participants first determined whose turn it was and subsequently selected an appropriate response to the target .
experiment 2 although the outcome of experiment 1 is consistent with those of the study discussed in wenke et al. ' s ( 2011 ) review , one may wonder how the obtained switch costs compare to standard switch costs obtained when a single actor performs the same task condition without a co - actor .
we call this a full - task condition , following liefooghe ( 2016 ) who also compared actor switching with standard individual task switching .
testing a full - task condition is important , because a lack of switch costs in the joint condition of experiment 1 can be taken as evidence against a strong shared task set , only if switch costs could be obtained in the full - task condition .
this is because of the possibility that assigning different tasks to different hands or response sets facilitates the cognitive separation and discrimination between the two tasks , which in turn might reduce or eliminate task switch costs ( jersild , 1927 ) .
only if this possibility can be excluded , can we confidently conclude that the outcome of experiment 1 provides unequivocal evidence against task set sharing in this task setting .
therefore , in experiment 2 , we went on to test whether switch costs are obtained in a full - task condition : a single actor used the two response sets that were distributed between two actors in the joint condition of experiment 1 , with one hand operating one response set and the other hand operating the other response set .
the actor cue used in experiment 1 was used to cue a response set ( i.e. , hand ) to be used on a given trial .
because a single actor represented both task contexts , we expected that switch costs should be obtained regardless of whether the response set was switched across successive trials .
method participants twenty - six participants were recruited from the edge hill university community ( 19 females , 7 males ; mean age 21.73 , sd 6.57 , range 18 - 50 ) .
they received experimental credits toward their psychology modules or paid pound3 for participation .
all reported having normal color vision and normal or corrected - to - normal visual acuity .
they were naive as to the purpose of the experiment .
apparatus , stimuli , and procedure the apparatus and stimuli were identical with those used in experiment 1 .
the only difference was that participants performed all trials alone without a co - actor .
the experiment was also conducted individually in a smaller experimental room .
participants placed their left middle and index fingers on the ' z ' and ' c ' keys and their right index and middle fingers on the ' 1 ' and ' 3 ' keys on the numeric keypad , respectively .
the letter that appeared within the target stimulus cued which hand to use , such that " a " indicated the left hand and " b " indicated the right hand .
each participant performed two blocks of the go / no - go condition and two blocks of the full - task blocks .
the go / no - go condition was exactly the same as the individual condition in experiment 1 , except that there was no co - actor sitting next to them ; participants always used the left hand on one block and the right hand on the other block .
the full - task condition was the same as the joint condition in experiment 1 , except that the actor cue now cued the hand to be used on each trial (" a " indicated the left hand , and " b " indicated the right hand ) .
two blocks were identical for the full - task condition .
the present experiment followed closely the procedure of experiment 1 in other respects .
design the experiment involved two conditions , full - task and go / no - go conditions , which were analogous to the joint and individual conditions in experiment 1 , respectively , and defined the factor task condition .
both conditions consisted of three types of task sequences ( cue repeat , cue switch , and task switch ) , which defined the factor task sequence .
in the go / no - go condition , previous trials could be a go or no - go trial ; in the full - task condition , previous trials could be performed with the same hand as the current trial ( hand repeat ) or by a different hand ( hand switch ) .
the factor previous trial was defined as to whether participants used the same hand to respond to stimuli on the previous trial ( go trials in the go / no - go condition and hand repeat trials in the full - task condition ) or they did not ( no - go trials in the go / no - go condition and hand switch trials in the full - task condition ) .
results trials were excluded in the same manner as in experiment 1 ( 4.18 % of all trials ) .
as in experiment 1 , the overall error rate was high ( 33.55 %) .
trials that followed an error trial were excluded in the analysis , but the results were consistent when those trials were included .
rt and pe were computed for each participant and submitted to 2 ( task condition : full - task vs. go / no - go ) x 3 ( task sequence : task switch vs. cue switch vs. cue repeat ) x 2 ( previous trial ) anovas .
the anova results are summarized in table 2 .

responses also depended on task sequence , but this effect was modulated by previous trial and task condition .
to clarify the three - way interaction , the effect of task sequence was analyzed separately for the full - task condition and the go / no - go condition .
multiple comparisons were bonferroni corrected .
for the full - task condition , rt was slower for task - switch trials ( m = 902 ms ) than for cue - switch trials ( m = 827 ms ; p = 0.001 ) or for cue - repeat trials ( m = 793 ms ; p < 0.001 ) when the previous trial was performed by the same hand , analogous to actor - repeat trials in the joint condition of experiment 1 ; there were no differences between cue - repeat and cue - switch trials ( p = 0.109 ) .
when the previous trial was performed by the different hand , rt was still longer for task - switch trials ( m = 964 ms ) than for cue - switch trials ( m = 901 ms ; p = 0.003 ) or cue - repeat trials ( m = 897 ms ; p = 0.004 ) ; there were no differences between cue - repeat and cue - switch trials ( p = 1 ) .
for the go / no - go condition , rt was longer for task - switch trials ( m = 909 ms ) than for cue - switch trials ( m = 832 ms ; p = 0.001 ) or cue - repeat trials ( m = 789 ms ; p < 0.001 ) when the previous trial was a go trial ; there was no difference between the latter two ( p = 0.225 ) .
when the previous trial was a no - go trial , no difference emerged among task switch ( m = 943 ms ) , cue switch ( m = 947 ms ) , and cue repeat ( m = 947 ms ; all ps = 1 ) .
these outcomes are consistent with the individual condition of experiment 1 .
percentages of error trials as in experiment 1 , the pe results were generally consistent with the rt data .
a significant main effect of previous trial revealed that pe was lower when the previous trial required the same hand response or when it was a go trial ( m = 22.76 %) than when the previous trial required a different hand or when it was a no - go trial ( m = 26.81 %) .
task sequence produced a main effect and interacted with previous trial .
more importantly , the significant three - way interaction among task sequence , previous trial , and task condition indicated that switch costs depended on the previous trial type , but differently for the full - task and go / no - go conditions .
to disentangle this interaction , post hoc tests ( bonferroni corrected ) were carried out to examine the effect of task sequence separately for the two task conditions .
in the full - task condition , task switch produced a larger pe ( m = 31.15 %) than did cue repeat ( m = 26.41 % , p = 0.039 ) and cue switch ( m = 25.23 % , p = 0.046 ) when the previous trial required a different hand , whereas the latter two did not differ ( p = 1 ) .
although the results were similar when the previous trial required the same hand , as task switch ( m = 28.80 %) produced larger pe than did cue repeat ( m = 22.86 %) or cue switch ( m = 23.60 %) , the differences were only marginal ( ps = 0.09 and 0.10 , respectively ) .
thus , switch costs were more pronounced when the hand switched across trials than when the same hand repeated .
in the go / no - go condition , task switch produced a larger pe ( m = 27.67 %) than did cue repeat ( m = 15.30 % , p = 0.016 ) and cue switch ( m = 15.30 % , p = 0.001 ) , whereas the latter two did not differ ( p = 0.802 ) when the previous trial was a go trial .
when the previous trial was a no - go trial , there were no significant differences ( ms = 23.45 % for cue repeat , 27.52 % for cue switch , and 27.09 % for task switch ; all ps > 0.5 ) .
discussion switch costs were obtained in the go / no - go condition when previous trials were go trials , but not when they were no - go trials , consistent with the individual condition of experiment 1 .
in the full - task condition , switch costs were obtained in rt on hand - repeat trials for which participants used the same response set ( analogous to actor - repeat trials ) as well as on hand - switch trials for which participants used different response sets ( analogous to actor - switch trials ) .
the outcomes imply that the same task representation was used to perform trials even when the response set differed between trials as long as the same actor performed both trials .
in this experiment , a single actor integrated the two task contexts ( i.e. , two response sets ) into a single task representation that should be equivalent to co - representation of the shared task contexts in the joint condition .
thus , the present results , and their difference with those in the joint condition of experiment 1 , suggest that the lack of switch costs in experiment 1 was not due to the nature of the task condition ( e.g. , task complexity , task discrimination , or response set discrimination ) .
instead , these findings reinforce the conclusion that the lack of switch costs in the joint condition of experiment 1 implies a lack of task set sharing .
interestingly , there were no cue switch costs on hand - switch trials , indicating that the lack of cue - switch costs in the joint condition of experiment 1 ( which may represent the binding of cues to either one 's own no - reaction or to the other agent and / or his or her response ) was not unique to joint performance .
it may be that cue - repeat trials still involved switches of the actor - or hand cue , so they were not purely cue - repeat trials as cue encoding continues until the actor - or hand - cue encoding is completed .
general discussion approaches to joint performance agree in assuming that people take the activities of co - actors into account , but there is also evidence that the resulting representations do not capture all aspects of the joint task .
the present study sought to test whether people may represent not only the stimuli that co - actors are facing ( so as to allow for turn taking ; e.g. , wenke et al. , 2011 ) and the actions that co - actors execute ( so as to allow for self - other action discrimination ; dolk et al. , 2014 ) , but also entire task sets that include stimulus - response relationships relevant only to the co - actor ( knoblich et al. , 2011 ) .
as we have argued , previous investigations of actor switching ( dudarev & hassin , 2016 ; liefooghe , 2016 ) are not sufficiently diagnostic because they are open to interpretations that do not require the assumption of task set sharing .
a more telling design was discussed by wenke et al .
( 2011 , experiment 2 ) , which was taken from an unpublished study .
we therefore adopted the basic design from this latter study , together with a manipulation of task cue repetition versus switch to determine whether the basic findings could be confirmed in a well - powered study .
experiment 1 shows that this was indeed the case : task switch costs were obtained after go trials , but not after no - go trials , irrespective of whether a co - actor performed during the actor 's no - go trials .
experiment 2 showed that reliable task switch costs were obtained if the same participant operated on the two response sets that were distributed across two participants in experiment 1 .
this ruled out the possibility that the lack of reliable switch costs in experiment 1 was due to the fact that the two actors used different response sets .
taken together , these findings question a strong claim of task set sharing that " humans represent not only their own tasks but also those of their partners and even those of people who they do not need to coordinate with " ( knoblich et al. , 2011 , p. 83 ) .
a possible counterargument could be derived from a recent discussion of the processes involved in no - go trials .
the lack of switch costs after no - go trials is commonly thought to reflect the fact that task switching is complete only after a response is selected and executed ( philipp , jolicoeur , falkenstein , & koch , 2007 ; schuch & koch , 2003 ; also see rogers & monsell , 1995 ) .
on go trials , response - related processes complete the activation of the relevant task set , and the activation survives until the next trial where it can impair the performance if a different task set is required to perform the trial .
on no - go trials , however , response - related processes are not executed , so the activation of the relevant task set is not sufficiently strong to carry over to the next trial .
this interpretation is consistent with the fact that the elimination of switch costs is associated with increases in rt on repeat trials rather than decreases on switch trials , indicating that repeat trials are performed as if they were switch trials .
however , there is an alternative interpretation : the task set may be activated on go and no - go trials alike , but is then suppressed to inhibit responses on no - go trials ( lenartowicz , yeung , & cohen , 2011 ; verbruggen , liefooghe , szmalec , & vandierendonck , 2005 ) .
consistent with this inhibition account , switch costs are still observed on trials for which only the task cue is presented but no target occurs ( cue - only trials ; lenartowicz et al. , 2011 ; swainson , martin , & prosser , 2016 ) .
thus , one could argue that our participants did represent their co - actor 's task , but suppressed the representation on no - go trials .
if so , switch costs could not be obtained on trials following no - go trials .
while this would be a valid possibility , the inhibition account faces numerous problems .
for one , switch costs are still eliminated when the previous trial presents a neutral stimulus that is not assigned to any response ( astle , jackson , & swainson , 2006 ) .
no response or task set should be activated under such conditions , so it would not be plausible to inhibit one or the other .
also , it has been shown that switch costs are obtained when one of the alternative responses is inhibited selectively ( verbruggen , leifooghe , & vandierendonck , 2006 ) , suggesting that inhibition of a given response is not sufficient to inhibit the entire task set .
most importantly , a task set inhibition account would have predicted negative switch costs in our study , because the account predicts that cuing a co - actor to perform task a in a given no - go trial would lead the actor to activate and then suppress task set a. this should make it particularly difficult for the actor to reactivate the just - suppressed task set a when the task is repeated ( mayr & keele , 2000 ; meuter , & allport , 1999 ) , which in turn should make repeat trials more demanding than switch trials .
our findings do not provide any support for this prediction .
thus , we conclude that participants did not represent anything more complex or comprehensive than the stimuli that a co - actor is facing and the actions that he or she performs in a joint condition .
finally , we should note that previous studies used different variations of joint task switching ( dudarev & hassin , 2016 ; liefooghe , 2016 ) and demonstrated switch costs after the co - actor 's trials .
these studies used a condition in which task switching always occurred with switching of the actors , whereas our method separated the two types of switching .
it would be important for future studies to examine how the co - occurrences of actor switching and task switching contribute to task - switching costs in joint settings .
1 we computed post hoc power for the experiments reported by wenke et al .
( 2011 ) , assuming a small effect size ( cohen 's f = 0.15 ) with a 2 ( task transition : repeat vs. switch ) x 2 ( condition : joint vs. individual ) x 2 ( previous trial : go vs. no - go ) repeated - measures design at the alpha level of 0.05 , which resulted in the power of 0.340. with the sample size of 56 , the estimated power increased to 0.925 , and with the 3 x 2 x 2 design that we actually used in experiment 1 , it went up to 0.979 .
2 to implement the bonferroni correction , p values were multiplied by the number of pairwise t tests , which is equivalent to dividing the criterion p value ( alpha ) by the number of pairwise t tests .

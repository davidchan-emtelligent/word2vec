background due to the restrictive nature of a gluten - free diet , celiac patients are looking for alternative therapies .
while drug - development programs include gluten challenges , knowledge regarding the duration of gluten challenge and gluten dosage is insufficient .
we challenged adult celiac patients with gluten with a view to assessing the amount needed to cause some small - bowel mucosal deterioration .
methods twenty - five celiac disease adults were challenged with low ( 1 - 3 g ) or moderate ( 3 - 5g ) doses of gluten daily for 12 weeks .
symptoms , small - bowel morphology , densities of cd3 + intraepithelial lymphocytes ( iels ) and celiac serology were determined .
results both moderate and low amounts of gluten induced small - bowel morphological damage in 67 % of celiac patients .
moderate gluten doses also triggered mucosal inflammation and more gastrointestinal symptoms leading to premature withdrawals in seven cases .
in 22 % of those who developed significant small - intestinal damage , symptoms remained absent .
celiac antibodies seroconverted in 43 % of the patients .
conclusions low amounts of gluten can also cause significant mucosal deterioration in the majority of the patients .
as there are always some celiac disease patients who will not respond within these conditions , sample sizes must be sufficiently large to attain to statistical power in analysis .
background celiac disease is an autoimmune - like systemic disorder in genetically susceptible individuals , perpetuated by daily ingested gluten cereals wheat , rye and barley and with manifestations in the small - intestinal mucosa and in organs outside the gut .
the gold standard for celiac disease diagnosis is the finding of gluten - induced small - intestinal mucosal injury [ 1,2 ] .
the mucosa will heal upon introduction of a gluten - free diet and the mucosal damage will reappear if gluten is reintroduced [ 2 ] .
extensive time - course studies have provided evidence that during gluten challenge an inflammatory process with a dose - dependent accumulation of intraepithelial lymphocytes ( iels ) is followed by mucosal villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia [ 3 ] .
in untreated celiac disease the degree of malabsorption is determined by the length of the functionally impaired bowel and the presence of symptoms is noway related to the histological features of a proximal biopsy [ 3 - 5 ] .
more recently , it was concluded that only patients with extensive and severe enteropathy will give evidence of steatorrhea and increased intestinal permeability [ 6 ] .
biopsy has thus remained the golden standard in measuring gluten - induced ill health .
previously a gluten challenge was part of the routine diagnostic procedure in children and a characteristic mucosal lesion reappeared in most patients within two years [ 2,7 ] .
in gluten challenge studies , the amount of gluten in normal food has been estimated to be as high as 10 - 20 g per day [ 8 - 10 ] .
a reduced daily gluten dose ( 2.5 - 5 g per day ) during a gluten - free diet has still enabled mucosal healing in half of the patients [ 11 ] .
also some adults challenged with 2.5 - 5 g of gluten daily for three to 14 months have shown no significant changes in mucosal morphology [ 12 ] .
these findings are in marked conflict with those from a recent challenge study where it was shown that even a minimal dose of 50 mg gluten daily induced a significant mucosal deterioration [ 13 ] .
altogether , the patient groups in these studies have been rather small and no unequivocal conclusions can be drawn .
a gluten - free diet is socially troublesome and expensive and research has shown compliance to the diet often to be poor [ 14 ] .
gluten contamination in a gluten - free diet is also difficult to avoid [ 15,16 ] .
for these reasons many celiac patients have expressed a desire for other alternative or complementary treatments , less burdensome than a strict life - long gluten - free diet [ 17,18 ] .
any drug under evaluation as clinically effective and trusted by celiac disease patients should significantly reduce or prevent gluten - induced mucosal injury .
however , data are insufficient as to the amount of gluten to be used in a challenge study and for how long .
in this pilot study we challenged adult celiac disease patients with gluten aiming to gain a clearer conception of the gluten amount needed to cause some mucosal deterioration but without inducing excessive ill health with a resultant dropout of trial subjects .
we challenged treated celiac disease patients with low to moderate amounts of gluten for up to 12 weeks to establish whether a morphometrically measurable mucosal deterioration could be detected .
we especially measured separately mucosal morphological change as villous height crypt depth ratio ( vh / crd ) and the inflammatory aspect in terms of density of mucosal iels , both known to be sensitive continuous functional parameters of gluten ingestion in celiac disease .
further , we sought to establish whether the gluten - dependent serum antibody markers show seroconversions .
methods patients and study design altogether 25 adult volunteers with previously diagnosed celiac disease were recruited for the gluten challenge study .
inclusion criteria comprised biopsy - proven celiac disease in patients aged 18 - 75 years adhering to a strict gluten - free diet for at least two years and being in clinical remission as judged by an interview , clinical examination and on - site rapid celiac autoantibody testing .
patients with a history of regular dietary transgressions , and those suffering from a condition carrying a risk at endoscopy , or using immunosuppressive medication were excluded .
at the outset the symptoms or signs leading to the diagnosis of celiac disease , the duration of the gluten - free diet , family history of celiac disease and associated conditions were recorded .
upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal biopsies , laboratory analysis and clinical evaluation including gastrointestinal symptoms , were carried out at baseline and after the challenge .
the complete challenge lasted 12 weeks ( 84 +/ - 14 days ) .
furthermore , at 4 weeks ( 28 +/ - 7 days ) and 8 weeks ( 56 +/ - 14 days ) the clinical and serological assessments were repeated .
the study patients were divided into two groups , those consuming a moderate ( 3 - 5 g ) amount of gluten and those consuming a low ( 1 - 3 g ) amount of gluten daily .
those who prematurely withdrew from the study were encouraged to undergo follow - up examinations immediately after the challenge was discontinued .
after the challenge all patients continued their normal gluten - free diet .
gluten product and dietary assessment each patient consumed 1.25 - 5 g of gluten ( as a biscuit ) daily during the challenge while otherwise continuing on a strict gluten - free diet .
a verified amount of industrial gluten ( meelunie , amsterdam , the netherlands ) was added to the baking mixture of the biscuits , and the mean daily gluten consumption of each patient was calculated .
consumption of the gluten product , changes in dietary habits and possible dietary transgressions were inquired at each visit and by regular telephone contacts .
at baseline and at the end of the study a dietitian made a detailed dietary analysis by means of interview and a 4 - day record of food intake .
small - bowel mucosal morphology and inflammation up to seven small - bowel biopsy specimens were taken from the distal part of the duodenum upon upper gastrointestinal endoscopy ; the specimens were evaluated by the same investigator without prior knowledge of the history or findings .
at least three biopsies were processed and stained with hematoxylin - eosin and studied under light microscopy .
poorly oriented sections were discarded ; when necessary , the samples were dissected repeatedly until they were of good quality .
morphometric analysis measuring vh / crd was made in well - oriented biopsy samples as previously described [ 19 ] , and a ratio < 2.0 was regarded as compatible with villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia and indicative of active celiac disease .
during the gluten - challenge , a decrease in vh / crd of 0.5 or more was considered significant and equivalent to clinical glutensensitivity [ 20 ] .
the remaining biopsies were snap - frozen for immunohistochemical stainings .
the specimens were freshly embedded in optimal temperature compound ( oct , tissue - tec , miles inc , elkhart , in , usa ) , snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 70degreesc .
immunohistochemical studies were carried out on 5 - mum - thick frozen sections .
cd3 + iels were stained with monoclonal antibody leu - 4 ( becton dickinson , san jose , ca , usa ) .
iels were counted with a x100 flat - field light microscope objective in randomly selected surface epithelium and the density of iels expressed as cells / millimetre of epithelium as previously described , the reference values being set at 37 cells / mm for cd3 + iels [ 21 ] .
after the gluten challenge an over 30 % increase in iel counts was considered significant and equivalent to clinical glutensensitivity [ 20 ] .
in our laboratory the correlation coefficients for intraobserver variation for cd3 + iels has been 0.95 and that for interobserver variation 0.92 .
celiac serology serum iga class transglutaminase 2 ( tg2 ) - antibodies were investigated by an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) according to manufacturer 's instructions ( quanta lite h - ttgiga , inova , diagnostics , inc , ca , usa ) .
the cut - off value for a positive antibody level was 20 iu. serum iga class endomysial antibodies ( ema ) were determined by an indirect immunofluorescence method using human umbilical cord as substrate ; a dilution of 1:5 or more was considered positive [ 22 ] .
positive sera were further diluted : 1:50 , 1:100 , 1:200 , 1:500 , 1:1000 , 1:2000 , 1:4000 .
we also determined a combination of serum iga and igg class deaminated gliadin peptide ( dgp ) antibodies ( quanta lite celiac dpg screen , inova diagnostics ) by elisa , and values >= 20 iu were considered positive .
none of the study subjects suffered from selective iga deficiency .
the change in antibody levels was considered clinically significant when antibodies seroconverted from negative to positive or when positive antibody levels increased and at least doubled during the gluten challenge .
small - bowel mucosal tg2 - targeted autoantibody deposits the small bowel mucosal tg2 - specific autoantibody deposits were studied by direct immunofluorescence methods in frozen biopsy sections [ 20,23 - 25 ]. from each patient altogether six unfixed , 5 - mum - thick sections from frozen small - bowel specimens were processed , three for investigation of iga deposits and three for double - color labelling for both iga and tg2 .
iga was detected by direct immunofluorescence using fluorescein isothiocyanate - labelled rabbit antibody against human iga ( dako as , glostrup , denmark ) as previously described [ 23 ] .
in celiac disease a clear subepithelial iga deposition was found below the basement membrane along the villous and crypt epithelium and around mucosal vessels , in contrast to that observed in non - celiac samples , where only endogenous iga is found inside plasma cells and epithelial cells .
sections were further double - stained for human iga ( green , as above ) and for tg2 ( red , monoclonal mouse antibody cub7402 , neomarers , fremont , ca , usa , followed by rhodamine - conjugated anti - mouse immunoglobulin antibodies , dako ) to confirm that celiac - type iga deposits co - localized with tg2 .
the occurrence of iga deposits was graded semi - quantitatively according to their intensity along the basement membrane in the villous - crypt area as follows : negative ( 0 ) , weak (+) , moderate (++) and strong positive (+++) .
in cases where the intensity of the staining was patchy , it was graded from different areas and the mean value was given .
all evaluations were carried out in blinded fashion without knowledge of disease history or laboratory findings .
the correlation coefficients for both intraobserver and interobserver variations for the detection of presence or absence of tg2 - specific iga deposits have been 0.98 in our laboratory .
an increase in the intensity of iga - deposit staining after gluten challenge was considered indicative of clinical gluten - sensitivity .
gastrointestinal symptoms clinical symptoms appearing during the gluten challenge were semiquantatively classified into four categories - no symptoms , slight , moderate or severe symptoms - by means of interview and recorded at each visit .
statistics quantitative data were expressed as medians and ranges or means and 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) .
statistical differences were evaluated using mann - whitney test and wilcoxon 's test or unpaired and paired t - test as appropriate , and all testing was two - sided .
fisher 's exact test was used in cross - tabulations .
the pearson coefficient was used for correlation studies .
p - values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
all statistical testing was performed using spss version 16.0 ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) ethical considerations the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of tampere university hospital .
all subjects gave written informed consent .
results altogether 25 adult celiac disease patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were enrolled for the study ( table 1 ) .
at the time of the diagnosis , the majority ( 88 %) had suffered from abdominal symptoms .
when volunteering for this study , the patients had been a median of 11 years on a strict gluten - free diet , and all were in clinical remission .

altogether six patients had borderline positive celiac disease antibody levels ( three had positive tg2 antibodies , two ema and one dgp antibodies ) ; in the rest all three antibodies were negative .
when tg2 - targeted autoantibodies were assessed at small - bowel mucosal level , moderate iga - deposits were seen in two and faint in four patients .
in the remaining 19 cases , mucosal tg2 - autoantibody depositions were negative at the beginning of the challenge study .

altogether four celiac disease patients belonging to the moderate gluten dose group discontinued the study due to abdominal symptoms shortly after the challenge was initiated ( after three , eight , ten and 23 days ) , and they were excluded from the final analyses .
celiac serology remained negative in all .
the first two drop - outs with extremely brief gluten challenges underwent the follow - up endoscopy , and no small - bowel mucosal deterioration was evident .
the remaining 21 patients comprised the final study population ( tables 2 and 3 ) , for whom the gluten challenge lasted a median of 84 days ( range 29 - 103 days ) with an average of 3.1 g daily gluten consumption ( range 1.3 - 5.0 g / day ) .
when the cohort was further divided according to the average daily gluten intake , ten patients belonged to the moderate - dose ( 3 - 5 g ) and 11 to the low - dose ( 1 - 3 g ) gluten challenge group ( tables 2 and 3 ) .
in the moderate - dose group , three patients withdrew prematurely ( after 29 , 38 and 61 days ) by reason of abdominal symptoms such as diarrhea , vomiting and abdominal pain ; one patient discontinued at day 45 for personal reasons .
intended end - point examinations were carried out in all four cases immediately after cessation of the challenge .
all celiac patients in the low - dose gluten challenge group completed the study as planned after 12 weeks' challenge .
patients with a moderate gluten dose were thus more prone than those with a low dose to withdraw prematurely from the study ( p = 0.035 ) .

during the gluten challenge , a clinically significant decrease in vh / crd was found in 14 ( 67 %) out of the 21 celiac patients ; seven were in the moderate and seven in the low gluten dose group ( table 2 , figures 1 and 2 ) .
the vh / crd in the moderate - dose group deteriorated from a mean 3.0 ( 95 % ci 2.8 - 3.2 ) to 1.7 ( 95 % ci 1.0 - 2.4 ) and in the low - dose group from 2.9 ( 95 % ci 2.5 - 3.4 ) to 1.9 ( 95 % ci 1.2 - 2.6 ) , both changes being statistically significant ( p = 0.002 and p = 0.016 , respectively ) .
the changes in vh / crd did not correlate with daily gluten intake ( r = - 0.138 , p = 0.552 ) .

in line with the morphological findings , a clinically significant change in the density of cd3 + iels was seen in altogether 14 ( 67 %) subjects ; eight in the moderate - dose and six in the low - dose of ( table 2 , figures 3 and 4 ) .
in the moderate gluten dose group the iel count increased significantly from a mean 49 cell / mm ( 95 % ci 38 - 60 ) to 88 cell / mm ( 95 % ci 70 - 106 , p = 0.001 ) .
in the low - dose group the increase did not reach statistical significance ( from a mean 78 cell / mm [ 95 % ci 56 - 100 ] to 98 cell / mm [ 95 % ci 61 - 135 ] , p = 0.188 ) .
all in all , daily gluten intake did not correlate with increased inflammation ( gluten intake vs. deltacd3 + iel count , r = 0.251 , p = 0.273 ) .

altogether nine ( 43 %) celiac disease patients , five in the moderate - and four in the low - dose gluten challenge group , showed significant increases in tg2 antibody titers ( table 3 ) .
the subjects consuming moderate doses of gluten evinced clearly higher tg2 antibody titer responses than those consuming low doses ; this was already seen after four weeks' challenge ( figure 5 ) .
interestingly , after the highest positive titer during the gluten challenge , the serum tg2 antibody levels tended to decrease even if gluten consumption continued ( figure 5 ) .
serum ema and dgp antibody titers were in line with tg2 antibody results ; furthermore , after the gluten challenge all these three antibodies appeared in the serum simultaneously ( data not shown ) .
small - bowel mucosal tg2 - targeted autoantibody deposits generally followed the gluten - induced serological response in sera and morphological changes seen in the biopsy specimens ( tables 2 and 3 ) .

closed squares indicate moderate daily gluten dose 3 - 5 g and open squares low gluten doses ( 1 - 3 g per day ) .
at the outset , all subjects were free of gastrointestinal symptoms .
altogether 15 ( 71 %) out of the 21 celiac disease patients experienced mild to moderate abdominal symptoms upon gluten challenge ; eight of them ( including the four withdrawing prematurely , see above ) were from the moderate - dose and seven from the low - dose group ( table 2 ) .
none developed severe symptoms .
thirteen ( 87 %) out of the 15 symptomatic patients also developed small - intestinal mucosal changes ( significant decrease in vh / crd and / or increase in the density of cd3 + iels ). of note , symptoms did not reveal four celiac disease patients having clinically significant gluten - induced small - bowel mucosal damage .
discussion twelve weeks' gluten challenge with both moderate and low amounts of gluten sufficed to induce small - bowel mucosal morphological damage in the majority of volunteer treated celiac disease adults not , however , in all .
an increase in the density of cd3 + iels paralleled this phenomenon especially in the moderate - dose gluten challenge group .
at the same time , moderate gluten doses triggered more gastrointestinal symptoms leading to premature withdrawals from the study .
this suggests that in the 12 - week time - frame smaller gluten doses of 1 - 3 g per day might be preferable to higher doses in order to obtain sufficient complete read - outs at the end of a challenge study .
in this study , small - bowel mucosal vh / crd measurement seemed to be the most sensitive parameter in both moderate and low gluten doses in assessing gluten - induced damage in celiac disease .
this conception is also in line with previous findings , where the vh / crd index has been used to show harmful effects of gluten in both short - term gluten challenges and long - term follow - up studies [ 8,13,26,27 ] .
it is not surprising that the iel count was a reliable marker for gluten toxicity only with moderate , but not with low gluten doses , as it has previously been shown that in celiac disease during a gluten - challenge , iels accumulate in the surface and crypt epithelium in a dose - dependent manner [ 3 ] .
it is also important to note that even if the majority of celiac disease patients after gluten challenge yielded positive read - outs both in the vh / crd index and in the iel count , there were some discrepant cases responding only with one or other parameter ( table 2 ) .
marsh classification entailing six diagnostic categories ( type 0 - type 3c ) has been widely used in the diagnostic work - up and follow - up of celiac disease [ 3 ] .
marsh grades type 1 - type 3c all indicate cursorily that small - bowel mucosal iel density is increased (> 40 iels / 100enterocytes ) , but different categories point more specifically to different morphological features ( such as normal villous morphology , crypt hyperplasia or villous atrophy ) .
nonetheless the marsh classification does not take into account minor gluten - induced mucosal changes ( e.g. a significant decrease in vh / crd or increase in density of iels within one marsh grade ) or discrepant results in vh / crd or iel counts during a gluten challenge .
it would thus be advisable in gluten challenge research projects , to use two separate continuous readout parameters in assessing gluten - dependent functional mucosal changes , i.e. the morphological vh / crd and the inflammatory iel changes , as opposed to applying a simplified grouped classification .
even if abdominal symptoms after the consumption of cereals do not generally constitute a specific marker of untreated celiac disease [ 28 ] , gluten - induced gastrointestinal symptoms in our challenge study showed high positive predictive value ( 87 %) for small - bowel mucosal injury in celiac disease patients .
however , in 22 % of the cases who developed significant small - intestinal damage , symptoms remained absent .
it is widely known that many untreated celiac disease patients do not suffer from symptoms even if they have a manifest gluten - induced small - bowel mucosal lesion [ 29 ] .
furthermore , in some treated celiac disease patients , symptoms may disappear on a strict gluten - free diet despite continued ongoing mucosal villous atrophy [ 30,31 ] .
such persistent small - intestinal villous atrophy in symptom - free patients clearly carries a risk of subsequent severe complications such as osteoporosis and malignancies [ 30 ] .
this warrants caution in relying solely on symptoms or other patient - related outcomes without small - bowel biopsies in gluten challenge research projects .
in studies where a gluten challenge has been applied for diagnostic purposes in children on a normal daily gluten - containing diet ( 10 - 20 g daily ) , a small - bowel mucosal histological relapse has usually developed within three to twelve months in the majority of patients [ 8,9 ] .
seroconversion of ema and tg2 antibodies is known to be a reliable predictor of histological relapse and antibody testing has helped in the timing of the biopsy [ 9 ] .
in this study with low to moderate gluten doses , only 43 % of the challenged adult celiac disease patients evinced a significant serological response .
in line with earlier challenge studies , here all those who had increased serum autoantibodies during the challenge also developed small - bowel villous atrophy .
however , at the same time serology missed nine cases with significant small - bowel mucosal changes ( tables 2 and 3 ) .
these cases might have called for a longer gluten challenge period or higher gluten amounts .
however , it is well - known that serology may fail to detect occasional slight dietary transgressions and incomplete mucosal healing [ 30,32,33 ] , and therefore celiac serology is not always a reliable means of assessing gluten - induced harm .
furthermore , it is important to note that after the gluten challenge all three antibody - ema , tg2 and dpg antibody - tests performed similar way , and recently introduced dpg antibody test was not superior to conventional serological assays .
as small - bowel mucosal tg2 - specific autoantibody deposits have also been found in seronegative celiac patients and patients with early - stage celiac disease [ 23,24,34 ] , it has been hypothesized that these mucosal autoantibodies might also appear early during a gluten challenge .
in our study , mucosal autoantibodies followed the morphological damage , and they added only little to the normal morphometrical measurements .
it might be that after a short - term acute gluten challenge the distribution of mucosal autoantibody depositions is patchy , and single mucosal biopsies may not reveal the positivity .
it remains to be seen whether they will be of use at earlier time - points in the gluten challenge , but due to the invasive nature of small - bowel biopsies we were not able to take specimens on several occasions during the challenge .
there were some celiac disease patients who did not respond in terms of any of the measured outcome variables during the 12 weeks' gluten challenge .
it is well - known that celiac patients show varying sensitivity to gluten and the process of mucosal deterioration may take years or even decades [ 35 - 37 ] .
furthermore , it should be remembered that the phenotype of the disease may vary in the same person over time ; celiac patients suffering originally from abdominal symptoms at diagnosis may later experience only extraintestinal symptoms such as dermatitis herpetiformis when gluten is re - introduced into the diet [ 37 ] .
these issues need to be taken into account when sample sizes in study cohorts are determined .
at the baseline of the study , the majority of the treated celiac disease patients evinced increased densities of iels and one patient even had villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia despite adherent to a strict long - term gluten - free diet .
according to the literature , such cases exist and it has been shown that even 80 % of treated patients may have ongoing villous atrophy during a strict diet [ 38 - 40 ] .
these persistent mucosal changes might be due to constant residual gluten contamination in the food , which again would indicate that alternative treatment options would be desirable .
conclusions all in all , further studies are still needed to establish the optimal gluten dose on the other hand causing some small - bowel mucosal deterioration but without inducing excessive ill health .
our results suggest that in drug trials , the duration of the gluten challenge might be shorter than 12 weeks and the gluten dose could be an average of those used in the current study ( approximately 3g ) .
as there are always some celiac disease patients who will not respond within these conditions , sample sizes must be sufficiently large to ensure adequate statistical power for the study .
the vh / crd index seemed to be the most reliable outcome measurement in both moderate and low gluten doses .
furthermore , it must be remembered that during a gluten challenge , some celiac patients may remain asymptomatic even if they develop manifest gluten - induced mucosal damage - this might in the long - run predispose these cases to celiac disease - related complications .

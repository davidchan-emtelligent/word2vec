background scaffold attachment factor b1 ( safb1 ) is a multifunctional protein which has been implicated in breast cancer previously .
we recently generated safb1 knockout mice ( safb1 - / - ) , but pleiotropic phenotypes including high lethality , dwarfism associated with low igf - i levels , and infertility and subfertility in male and female mice , respectively , do not allow for straightforward tumorigenesis studies in these mice .
therefore , we asked whether safb1 heterozygosity would influence tumor development and progression in mmtv - wnt - 1 oncomice or dmba induced tumorigenicity , in a manner consistent with haploinsufficiency of the remaining allele .
methods we crossed female safb1 +/ - ( c57b6 / 129 ) mice with male mmtv - wnt - 1 ( c57b6 / sjl ) mice to obtain safb1 +/+/ wnt - 1 , safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 , and safb1 +/ - mice .
for the chemical induced tumorigenesis study we treated 8 weeks old safb1 +/ - and safb +/+ balb / c mice with 1 mg dmba once per week for 6 weeks .
animals were monitored for tumor incidence and tumor growth .
tumors were characterized by performing h & e , and by staining for markers of proliferation and apoptosis .
results we did not detect significant differences in tumor incidence and growth between safb1 +/+/ wnt - 1 and safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 mice , and between dmba - treated safb1 +/+ and safb1 +/ - mice .
histological evaluation of tumors showed that safb1 heterozygosity did not lead to changes in proliferation or apoptosis .
there were , however , significant differences in the distribution of tumor histologies with an increase in papillary and cribriform tumors , and a decrease in squamous tumors in the safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 compared to the safb1 +/+/ wnt - 1 tumors. of note , dmba treatment resulted in shortened survival of safb1 +/ - mice compared to their wildtype littermates , however this trend did not reach statistical significance .
conclusion our data show that safb1 heterozygosity does not influence wnt - 1 or dmba - induced mammary tumorigenesis .
background scaffold attachment factor b1 ( safb1 ) is a multifunctional protein that is involved in rna processing , transcriptional regulation , and stress response [ 1 ] .
safb1 has previously been implicated in breast tumorigenesis .
safb1 functions as an estrogen receptor alpha ( eralpha ) corepressor [ 2 ] , and its overexpression in cultured cells leads to growth inhibition .
importantly , safb1 mutations have been identified in microdissected breast tumors but not in the normal adjacent tissue , and safb1 's chromosomal locus displays extremely high loss of heterozygocity loh ( 78 %) in invasive breast cancer [ 3 ] .
there is no significant different in loh frequencies between er - positive and er - negative tumors , and other in vitro observations [ 4 ] suggest that safb1 could exert its effect on tumorigenesis , at least in part , through er - independent mechanisms .
this is further supported by our recent observation that loss of safb1 / safb1 is associated with worse overall survival of breast cancer patients , but does affect tamoxifen response [ 5 ] .
collectively , these data suggest that safb1 loss affects breast tumorigenesis in er - dependent and independent manner .
we have generated safb1 knockout ( safb1 - / - ) mice [ 6 ] which are characterized by high prenatal and neonatal lethality , growth retardation associated with low serum insulin - like growth factor i ( igf - i ) levels , as well as female subfertility and male infertility .
the safb1 - / - mice that are born alive succumb to frailty , often associated with infections , and die of unknown reasons at an early age .
these pleiotropic phenotypes of safb1 - / - mice make tumorigenesis studies difficult to perform , and we therefore asked whether partial safb1 loss in safb1 +/ - mice would influence mammary tumor formation or progression .
therefore , we used two different tumor models ; transgenic mmtv - wnt - 1 oncomice , and a chemical carcinogen model , in which tumors were induced with 7 , 12 - dimethylbenz ( a ) anthracene ( dmba ) .
genes of the wnt family function in the regulation of growth and differentiation of the mammary gland [ 7 ] .
mutation or deregulation of several components and transcriptional targets of the wnt signaling have been observed in human cancers , including breast [ 8 - 12 ] .
mammary tumors induced by mouse mammary tumor virus ( mmtv ) infection have revealed oncogenes involved in murine mammary tumorigenesis [ 13 ] , and wnt - 1 was the first proto - oncogene discovered as a gene frequently activated in mammary tumors arising in mice infected with mmtv [ 14 ] .
about 50 % of mmtv - wnt - 1 transgenic female mice develop mammary tumors by 5 - 6 months of age [ 15 ] , and these mice have therefore frequently been used to study the effect of potential tumor suppressor or oncogenes on mammary gland tumorigenesis ( for review , see [ 16 ]) .
dmba is a prototypical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pahs ) with carcinogenic and immunosuppressive effects in various species [ 17 ] .
since it was first reported by huggins et al [ 18 ] , dmba - induced mammary tumors have been widely used as a spontaneous cancer model in laboratory animals including rats [ 19 ] and mice [ 20 ] .
in this study , we have analyzed the effect of partial safb1 loss on wnt - 1 and dmba - induced tumorigenesis .
here show that safb1 heterozygosity does not affect tumor incidence and tumor growth .
however , we observed changes in the wnt - 1 tumor histopathology , and a trend towards shorter survival in dmba - treated safb1 +/ - mice .
results safb1 protein expression is decreased in safb1 +/ - mice first , we set out to confirm decreased safb1 protein levels in safb1 +/ - mice using a number of different tissues , including testes , spleen , lung , and mammary gland ( figure 1a ) .
quantification revealed an average decrease of 42 % in the safb1 +/ - mice , compared to safb1 +/+ mice ( figure 1b ) .
a similar decrease was observed in the tumors , where we detected an average of 53 % decrease of safb1 protein expression in safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 tumors compared to safb1 +/+/ wnt - 1 tumors ( data not shown ) .

b ) percentage of safb1 protein levels in safb1 +/ - tissues , corrected for b - actin levels , relative to protein levels in safb1 +/+ mice .
tumor - free survival and tumor growth safb1 - wnt - 1 mice we crossed female safb1 +/ - mice with male mmtv - wnt - 1 transgenic mice to obtain experimental mice .
there was no significant difference in time to tumor formation between safb1 +/+/ wnt - 1 and safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 in both females ( figure 2a ) and males ( figure 2b ) .
the median time to tumor formation ( mttf ) was 31 weeks ( n = 31 ) for female safb1 +/+/ wnt - 1 , and 34 weeks for female safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 mice ( n = 29 ) .
similarly , we did not detect a significant difference in mttf between safb1 +/+/ wnt - 1 ( n = 23 ) and safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 ( n = 25 ) male mice .
thus , partial safb1 loss does not accelerate the formation , or alter the incidence of wnt - 1 induced mammary tumors .

ages in weeks were recorded at the time of first tumor observation .
c ) and d ) growth rates of tumors in female and male wnt - 1 transgenic mice , respectively , on a safb1 +/+ or safb1 +/ - background .
the graphs represent time in weeks for tumor growth from detection to 1000 mm3 , with error bars representing sem .
since tumor incidence was not significantly affected by partial safb1 loss , we asked whether loss of one safb1 allele would result in accelerated rates of tumor growth , as has been described for other models such as p21 +/ - / wnt - 1 [ 21 ] .
we therefore analyzed length of time necessary for tumors to grow from < 50 mm3 ( time of detection by palpation ) to 1000 mm3 .
tumors in female mice grew slightly faster ( figure 2c ) than in male mice ( figure 2d ) , however , there was no significant difference between safb1 +/+/ wnt - 1 and safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 animals in either group .
since wnt - 1 mice can develop lung metastases [ 22 ] , we also asked whether partial loss of safb1 would affect the metastatic potential in our animals .
we microscopically analyzed h & e - stained lung tissue , and detected metastases in 4 out of 13 safb1 +/+/ wnt - 1 , and in 3 out of 8 safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 mice which was not statistically different .
thus , safb1 heterozygosity did not affect the development of lung metastases in the wnt - 1 mice .
igf - i plays an important role in cell proliferation , differentiation , and apoptosis , and it has also been linked to malignant transformation and breast cancer pathogenesis [ 23 - 26 ] .
numerous studies have shown that a reduction of circulating igf - i is associated with a decrease in carcinogen and oncogenes induced cancer ( in particular , breast and colon cancer ) [ 27 ] .
interestingly , safb1 - / - mice are characterized by growth retardation , which was correlated with low serum igf - i levels [ 6 ] .
however , we did not detect a significant difference in igf - i levels between safb1 +/+/ wnt - 1 or safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 mice ( data not shown ) , and can thus exclude the possibility that decreased igf - i levels could mask an effect of safb1 heterozygosity on tumorigenesis .
dmba treatment we next analyzed the effect of safb1 heterozygosity on dmba induced tumorigenesis in balb / c mice .
this study comprised of 67 female mice ( 34 safb1 +/+ and 33 safb1 +/ - ) in the treatment group , and 15 mice ( 8 safb1 +/+ and 7 safb1 +/ - ) in the vehicle treated control group .
we first analysed the development of mammary tumors after dmba treatment .
seventeen mice ( 28.4 %) of the dmba treated animals developed mammary tumors , however there was no significant difference in tumor development between safb1 +/+ ( n = 9 ) and safb1 +/ - ( n = 10 ) mice ( figure 3a ) .

kaplan - meier survival curves of mammary gland tumor free ( a ) , all tumor free ( b ) , and overall survival ( c ) in dmba - treated safb1 +/+ and safb1 +/ - mice .
time in weeks were recorded from the first day of dmba treatment to the time of first tumor observation ( a , b ) , and death or sacrifice of animals due to comorbidity ( c ) .
in addition to the mammary gland tumors , animals also developed tumors in other organs including skin , blood , intestine , liver , and lung .
a total of 34 animals ( 50.7 %) developed at least one tumor during the study period ( 17 safb1 +/+ and 17 safb1 +/ - ) , but again there was no significant difference in tumor free survival ( from all tumors ) between safb1 +/+ and safb1 +/ - mice ( figure 3b ) .
next we analyzed the overall survival ( os ) of the dmba treated animals .
the data captured for os included death as a result of tumorigenesis , and sacrifice due to co - morbidity of unknown reasons .
interestingly , there was a trend for shorter os in the safb1 +/ - mice ; the median survival was 40 weeks for safb1 +/+ , and 35 weeks for safb1 +/ - mice ( figure 3c ) .
to investigate whether this could be due to differential effects of dmba on the hematopoietic system , we performed complete blood count ( cbc ) and blood smear test for 15 dmba treated mice ( 7 safb1 +/+ and 8 safb1 +/ - ) , and 2 control mice .
although one safb1 +/ - mice developed b - cell lymphoma , all other blood parameters including red blood cell count , white blood cell count , platelet count , amount of hemoglobin , mean corpuscular volume , mean corpuscular hemoglobin , and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration , were not significantly different between both genotypes ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the observed trend was unlikely due to a defect in hematopoietic system in the safb1 +/ - mice .
in summary , safb1 heterozygosity did not lead to statistically significant effects on dmba - induced tumorigenesis .
histological analysis of tumors safb1 - wnt - 1 tumor we next asked whether partial safb1 loss would lead to changes in the histopathology of the wnt - 1 tumors .
h & e staining revealed that tumors of both safb1 genotypes were well - differentiated , and mainly characterized by three tumor patterns : papillary , cribriform , and squamous ( figure 4a ) .
there was a small difference in the pattern distribution between the two genotypes : while the papillary , cribriform , and squamous pattern represented 45 - 50 % , 40 - 45 % , and < 5 % distribution respectively , in safb1 +/+/ wnt - 1 tumors , they represented 70 % , 25 % and < 5 % distribution , respectively , in safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 tumors ( p = 0.01 ) .

the graph shows quantification of caspase 3 - positive cells / field , with error bars representing sem ( p = 0.0742 ) .

next , we set out to determine whether there was a difference in proliferation and apoptosis between safb1 +/+/ wnt - 1 and safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 tumors .
therefore , we stained the tumors using brdu antibody to detect the percentage of cells in s phase , and using phosphorylated h3 ( phospho h3 ) antibody to detect mitotic cells .
we did not observe significant changes in the mitotic figures ( figure 4b ) , and in number of brdu - positive cells between safb1 +/+/ wnt - 1 and safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 mice ( data not shown ) .
similarly , we did not detect a significant difference in rates of apoptosis , as measured by ihc using antibodies for cleaved caspase 3 , although there was a trend towards decreased apoptosis in the safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 mice ( p = 0.0742 as calculated by unpaired t test , n = 10 per each genotype ) ( figure 4c ) .
together , these data show that partial safb1 loss does not affect proliferative and apoptotic rates in wnt - 1 tumors .
dmba induced tumors finally , we determined whether safb1 heterozygosity would lead to changes in the histopathology of the dmba - induced mammary tumors .
h & e staining revealed similar histopathology in both groups , in that the tumors mostly contained keratinized squamous epithelial cells ( figure 5a ) .
we also did not detect any significant difference in the percentage of brdu - positive cells ( data not shown ) , and cleaved caspase - 3 positive cells ( figure 5b ) between the two safb1 genotypes .
we thus conclude that safb1 heterozygosity did not affect proliferative and apoptotic rates in dmba - induced tumors .

bars represent 100 mum for a and 50 mum for b. discussion to better understand safb1 's role in tumorigenesis in vivo , we have analyzed the effect of partial safb1 loss on wnt - 1 and dmba induced tumorigenesis .
our results show that safb1 heterozygosity does not accelerate incidence or growth of either wnt - 1 or dmba - induced tumors .
the absence of an effect could suggest that safb1 heterozygosity is not sufficient to cause an increase in tumorigenesis .
indeed , the classical knudson 's two - hit hypothesis states that tumor suppressor genes are recessive , and that both alleles must be inactivated for tumorigenesis [ 28 ] .
this model was based on the repeated observation that familial cancers often result from the initial germline mutation of one allele of a tumor suppressor gene , followed by subsequent somatic mutation or loss of the second allele .
consistent with this , there are numerous studies showing that loss of a single allele of a tumor suppressor gene does not increase tumorigenesis .
for example , partial p53 loss did not accelerate wnt - 1 [ 29 ] or dmba - induced mammary tumorigenesis [ 30 ] .
similarly , brca1 and brca2 heterozygosity did not affect tumor formation induced by the wnt - 1 transgene [ 16 ] , and partial deletion of the ink4a locus that encodes both p16ink4a and p19arf did not result in increased dmba - induced tumor formation [ 31 ] .
however , there are also many reports where heterozygosity results in significantly increased tumorigenicity , thus demonstrating haploinsufficiency of the remaining allele .
for example , inactivation of a single allele of the gene encoding the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1 was sufficient to sensitize mice to radiation and carcinogen - induced tumorigenesis [ 32 ] .
dmp1 - heterozygote mice treated with dmba or ionizing radiation accelerated tumorigenesis compared to the wild type [ 33 ] .
similarly , mmtv - wnt - 1 transgenic mice which are heterozygous for pten developed mammary tumors earlier than the pten wild type mice [ 22 ] .
at this point of time , we cannot exclude the possibility that partial safb1 loss would influence the tumorigenicity in other tumor models .
for example , as discussed above , partial p53 loss did not cooperate with wnt - 1 [ 29 ] , however , it did accelerate tumor development in mmtv - ras [ 34 ] and mmtv - myc [ 35 ] mice models .
our study specifically addressed the question of the effect of safb1 heterozygosity in hormone - independent mammary gland tumors .
both , in vitro [ 4,36 ] and in vivo [ 5 ] data suggest that safb1 has er - independent activities .
unpublished studies from our group showed that safb1 heterozygosity results in increased er activity in mefs , both in the absence and presence of ligand , and thus future studies should address potential effects of safb1 heterozygosity in development of hormone - dependent tumors , such as the p53 - / - tumors [ 37 ] .
two interesting observations from this study warrant further discussion .
first , we observed a non - significant trend towards a shorter overall survival of safb1 +/ - mice compared to the safb1 +/+ mice after dmba treatment .
we did not find any obvious defects in the haematopoietic system but the increase in lethality could be due to increased tumor development in other organs , or defects in the immune system , resulting from the partial loss of safb1 .
second , we observed subtle differences in the histological distribution pattern of the papillary and cribriform tumor types between safb1 +/+/ wnt - 1 and safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 tumors .
the wnt pathway is known to influence cell fate determination , stem cells renewal , and expansion of progenitor cells in a number of tissues , including the mammary gland [ 38 - 40 ] .
wnt1 - ransformed progenitor cells might differentiate into multiple cells types , resulting in tumor heterogeneity .
a role of safb1 affects in this function of wnt - 1 could explain the altered histology of tumors in safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 tumors .
in summary , we have shown that partial safb1 loss does not cooperate with wnt - 1 or dmba induced tumorigenesis .
future studies using conditional deletion of both alleles will address the question of whether complete loss of safb1 expression results in increased mammary gland tumorigenesis .
methods animal models mmtv - wnt - 1 transgenic mice ( a kind gift from dr. larry donehower , baylor college of medicine ) and those that carry a mutant allele of safb1 have been described previously [ 6,15 ] .
male wnt - 1 mice ( on a mixed sjl and c57bl / 6 background ) were crossed with safb1 heterozygous females ( on a mixed c57bl / 6j and 129sv background ) to generate the three genotypes used in our study : safb1 +/+/ wnt - 1 , safb1 +/ - / wnt - 1 , and safb1 +/ - . for dmba analysis we used mice on a balb / c background .
all animals were maintained in a pathogen - free facility at baylor college of medicine , and fed a diet of standard food and water ad libitum .
all procedures were approved by the bcm institutional animal care and use committee .
genotyping and immunoblotting the genotypes were determined by isolating tail dna and performing pcr .
primers used to detect the intact safb1 gene ( 5 ' - tat tat cat ctg cat tca cca gtt g - 3 ' and 5 ' - tct gtg ctc cca tca tct gtc ttc ttg - 3 ') generate a 715 bp pcr product .
primers used to detect lacz ( 5 ' - ctg ctg atg aag cag aac aac ttt a - 3 ' and 5 ' - gac aga ttt gat cca gcg ata cag - 3 ') generate a pcr product of 306 bp. primers used to detect wnt - 1 transgene ( 5 ' - gaa ctt gct tct ctt ctc ata gcc - 3 ' and 5 ' - cca cac agg cat aga gtg tct gc - 3 ') generate a 350 bp pcr product .
to confirm decreased safb1 protein levels of heterozygous mice compared to wild type mice , snap - frozen testes , spleen , lung , kidney , uterus and mammary gland tissues from safb1 +/+ and safb1 +/ - mice were crushed , lysed in 5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) , and sonicated .
proteins were resolved by sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane .
after blocking ( pbs and 0.1 % tween 20 ( pbst ) + 5 % milk ) , membranes were probed with safb1 [ 6 ] and beta - actin ( sigma ) antibodies .
protein - antibody complexes were detected using horseradish peroxidase - linked secondary anti - mouse or anti - rabbit ( amersham biosciences ) , and the signal was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence ( pierce ) according to manufacturer 's instructions .
bands were quantitated using fluorchem 8000 ( alpha inotech corp. ) and averaged the percentages of safb1 expression in all analyzed tissues of safb1 +/ - mice with respect to the safb1 +/+ mice tumorigenesis study for dmba induced tumorigenesis , 8 week old virgin female balb / c mice were treated with 1 mg / week dmba ( sigma - aldrich inc , st. louis , mo ) , dissolved in cotton seed oil ( sigma - aldrich inc , st. louis , mo ) by gavage for 6 consecutive weeks .
control mice received cotton seed oil only .
after weaning ( wnt tumor ) , or one week after dmba treatment ( dmba tumor ) mice were monitored 3 times / week for tumor formation by visual inspection and palpation .
tumors were measured with a calliper and volume was calculated according to the formula ( w * w * l )/ 2 , where w is the width and l is the length .
mice where euthanized when tumor volume reached > 1000 mm3 or general health conditions deteriorated due to unknown reasons .
all animals that did not develop palpable tumors were harvested at the end of the study period ( 50 - 52 weeks after dmba treatment ) .
necropsies were performed to determine incidence of non - palpable tumors or blood disorders .
mice were injected with 100 mg / kg brdu 2 hr prior to sacrifice for subsequent measurements of proliferation .
at the time of sacrifice , tumors and lungs were removed .
part of the tumors was used for paraffin - embedding and the remaining part was frozen at - 80degreesc .
blood samples were obtained from some of the animals and analyzed for hematological parameters .
control mice without the wnt - 1 transgene of both groups safb1 +/ - female and male mice were monitored for up to 18 months .
in the wnt - 1 study , both breeding and non - breeding males and only virgin females were used for data collection .
histological analysis lung and tumor cross - sections were fixed in fresh 4 % paraformaldehyde overnight , and stored in 70 % ethanol until embedding .
samples were paraffin embedded , sectioned , and h & e stained using standard protocols , by the breast center pathology core at bcm .
for the immunohistochemical ( ihc ) staining , we have used rabbit anti - caspase 3 antibody ( cell signalling ) to measure apoptosis and brdu in situ detection kit ii ( bd pharmingen ) to analyze proliferation .
in the wnt study we have additionally stained with anti - phosphorylated h3 ( upstate ) to measure mitotic index of the tumors .
three photographs from different areas of the tumors were taken per each slide and the percentage of these apoptotic and proliferations marker - positive cells was calculated .
blood samples were taken from 17 dmba treated mice ( 7 safb1 +/+ , 8 safb1 +/ - and 2 control ) by cardiac puncture .
haematological analyses were carried out on the advia 120 ( bayer diagnostics ) automated hematology analyzer , and blood smears were evaluated for abnormalities .
statistical analysis for all statistical tests , p <= 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
the time from birth ( wnt - 1 tumors ) or from the first dmba treatment to the time of tumor appearance and death were subjected to kaplan - meier analysis .

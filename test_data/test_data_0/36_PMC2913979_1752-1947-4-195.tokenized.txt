introduction primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the uterus is extremely rare .
they occur as either pure primitive neuroectodermal tumors or admixed with neoplasms of mullerian origin .
case presentation a case of uterine primitive neuroectodermal tumor with adenosarcoma in a 50 - year - old asian indian woman is presented .
histologically , the neoplasm displayed perivascular pseudorosettes and occasional homer - wright rosettes .
a strong positivity for neuronspecific enolase and synaptophysin was noted , while chromogranin and cd99 were negative .
merging imperceptibly with the neuroectodermal components were the areas of adenosarcoma .
conclusion to the best of our knowledge , this report represents the second case of a uterine primitive neuroectodermal tumor with an admixed adenosarcoma .
introduction the term " primitive neuroectodermal tumor " ( pnet ) was first coined in 1973 by hart and earle to describe a group of tumors thought to be derived from fetal neuroectodermal cells .
these tumors were noted to have morphological features of small round cell tumors with variable degrees of neural , glial , and ependymal differentiation [ 1 ] .
there are two main categories of pnets according to the cell of origin and location : central and peripheral .
central pnets are derived from the neural tube and involve mainly the brain and the spinal cord .
on the other hand , peripheral pnets are derived from the neural crest and occur outside the central nervous system , often involving the sympathetic nervous system or soft tissues and bones [ 2 ] .
peripheral pnets show typical ewsr1 gene rearrangement , while central pnets lack the ewsr1 rearrangement [ 3 ] .
based on similar clinical , immunohistochemical and cytogenetic profile , ewing 's sarcoma and pnet are regarded as two extremes of a morphological spectrum of the same tumor entity [ 2 ] .
the occurrence of pnets in visceral sites such as lung , kidney and genital tract of a woman has been increasingly recognized [ 3 ] .
here we present a case of uterine pnet .
case presentation a 50 - year - old asian indian woman , who had been menopausal for two years , presented with complaints of post - menopausal bleeding for three to four months .
a per speculum examination of our patient showed a 10x8 cm vascular congested mass abutting the introitus .
a polypoidal mass with a thick pedicle was felt coming out of her endocervix on per vaginum examination .
cervical polypectomy was done on our patient and a histopathological diagnosis of small round cell tumor was arrived at. following polypectomy our patient continued to have vaginal bleeding .
ultrasonography ( usg ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the whole abdomen and pelvis of our patient revealed an irregular infiltrative mass lesion in her uterine corpus and cervix .
no parametrial invasion or significant lymphadenopathy , however , was noted .
subsequently , a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo - oophorectomy with pelvic omentectomy and pelvic lymph node sampling was done on our patient .
her uterus and the cervix grossly measured 8x4x3 cm. on cut surface a polypoidal , soft , tan tumor , was seen filling her entire endometrial cavity and extending to her endocervix .
histology revealed a tumor with majority of the areas displaying primitive neuroectodermal differentiation and a minor component of adenosarcoma constituting around 20 % of the tumor volume .
the former was composed of sheets of undifferentiated , small round to oval cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and numerous mitotic figures .
micronodular pale islands with fibrillary matrix , perivascular pseudorosettes and occasional homer - wright rosettes were seen ( figure 1 ) .
areas of adenosarcoma comprised of epithelial lined cleft - like spaces and glands showing mild atypia and occasional mitosis along with sarcomatous stroma and polypoidal stromal projections into the lumen ( figure 2 ) .
these glandular structures were present well away from the residual endometrium and were not accompanied by the normal endometrial stroma .
lymphovascular emboli were also seen .
the tumor showed full thickness myometrial invasion and extension into the cervix .
left parametrium also showed tumor infiltration and one left external iliac lymph node showed metastasis .

( c ) fibrillary nodules ( hematoxylin and eosin staining , at x40 magnification ). and ( d ) perivascular rosettes ( hematoxylin and eosin staining , x100 magnification ) are also shown .
figure 2 adenosarcoma composed of ( a ) glands with polypoidal stromal projections into the lumen ( hematoxylin and eosin staining , x40 ) , ( b ) cleft - like epithelial lined spaces with sarcomatous stroma ( hematoxylin and eosin staining , x40 ) , and ( c ) endometrial glands surrounded by sarcomatous stroma ( hematoxylin and eosin staining , x40 ) .
on immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) , both spindle cell component of the adenosarcoma and small cell component were positive for vimentin .
the small cell component also showed strong positivity for neuronspecific enolase ( nse ) , and synaptophysin ( figure 3 ) .
chromogranin and cytokeratin examination results were negative .
cd99 was also negative .
a final diagnosis of stage iiic pnet with adenosarcoma of the uterus was finally made .

two months post - operatively , our patient again presented with bleeding per vaginum and a nodule at the vaginal vault .
her whole abdomen computed tomography ( ct ) scan showed normal upper abdomen with a 2x2 - cm mass at the vaginal vault .
she was then started on radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
until her last follow - up examination at six months after her surgery , our patient has received a total of three cycles of radiotherapy and six cycles of chemotherapy .
her vault nodule has been completely regressed and she is now disease - free .
discussion pnets in the woman 's genital tract are extremely rare [ 2 ]. the most common site of pnet in the woman 's genital tract is the ovary .
the uterine corpus is the next common site , while the cervix and the vulva are rarely the primary site [ 4 ] .
there are 43 cases of uterine pnets reported in the literature to date [ 2 - 6 ] .
uterine pnets most commonly occur as pure pnets .
an admixture with neoplasms of unquestionable mullerian origin suggests a mullerian derivation for at least some of these tumors [ 1 ]. of the 43 cases of uterine pnets reported in the literature , 12 were associated with a mullerian neoplasm. of these , the most common occurrence was endometrial carcinoma at six cases , followed by malignant mixed mullerian tumor ( mmmt ) at three cases , and a case each of complex hyperplasia , endometrial stromal sarcoma and adenosarcoma [ 1,3 ] .
the case we present in this report is only the second reported case of uterine pnet associated with adenosarcoma .
the glands within an adenosarcoma appear to be an integral part of the neoplasm but dissimilar histological appearances can result if non - neoplastic endometrial glands become entrapped within a stromal sarcoma .
when entrapment of this type does occur , the glands are commonly hyperplastic .
it will usually also be apparent that some are set in a non - neoplastic stroma that is being encroached upon by a malignant stromal component .
also , the presence of glandular structure away from any residual endometrium and its absence from the pedicle of the neoplasm helps to differentiate it from benign entrapped glands [ 7 ] .
other characteristic morphological features of adenosarcoma that help in diagnosis include the presence of periglandular stromal cellularity and stromal polypoid projections [ 8 ] .
uterine pnets occur most commonly in patients older than 50 years , and vaginal bleeding is the most common presentation [ 3 ] .
histologically , pnets have areas displaying various types of neuroectodermal elements like fibrillary background , ganglion cells , astrocyte - like cells , rosettes , ependymal and medulloepithelial differentiation [ 1,3 ] .
fibrillary background and rosette - like structures are the most commonly observed patterns of neuroectodermal differentiation [ 3 ] .
on ihc most of the uterine pnets are variably positive for one or more neuroectodermal markers like nse , chromogranin , and synaptophysin , while cytokeratin ranges from negative to very focally positive [ 3 ] .
in the largest case series on uterine pnets by eusher et al. , cd99 was positive in seven out of nine cases tested for the marker .
also in their series none of the 12 cases tested for typical ewsr1 rearrangement were positive [ 3 ] .
however , five cases of typical gene rearrangement are described in the literature [ 3,4 ] .
the differential diagnosis of uterine pnets include other uterine tumors or tumor - like lesions containing neuroectodermal elements of the type found in the central nervous system .
these include mature glial tissue in the endocervix or endometrium , immature teratoma with glial tissue , pure uterine gliomas , mmmt with neuroectodermal differentiation , and retinal anlage tumor .
another group of differential diagnosis includes uterine tumors with small malignant cell population .
this group includes rare endometrial carcinomas resembling small cell carcinoma of the lung , endometrial stromal sarcoma , malignant lymphoma , and leukemia .
the diagnosis of uterine pnet is based on light microscopic and immunohistochemical evidence of neuroectodermal differentiation [ 2 ] .
uterine pnet , occurring as pure or in combination with other histological subtype , is associated with advanced - stage disease and follows a potentially aggressive clinical course [ 3 ] .
multimodal treatment including surgery , chemotherapy , and / or radiotherapy are required [ 3 ] .

we report a case study of a 55 - year - old white male with severe persistent refractory corticosteroid - dependent asthma receiving inhaled combination therapy with fluticasone propionate 500 mug and salmeterol 50 mug twice - daily in addition to 6 - week cycles of oral corticosteroid treatment for the previous 7 months .
the patient was switched to high - dose mometasone furoate delivered via a dry powder inhaler ( 660 mug twice - daily ) for 6 weeks .
considerable improvement from baseline in peak expiratory flow , use of rescue medication , and asthma symptoms of coughing and wheezing was observed .
the patient discontinued the oral corticosteroid after 1 week of high - dose mometasone furoate treatment .
plasma cortisol value at 8 a.m. was 8.4 mug / dl ( normal range , 4.3 - 22.6 mug / dl ) at week 6 .
introduction inhaled corticosteroids ( icss ) are the standard controller therapy for management of persistent asthma [ 1 ] .
the majority of patients with asthma have mild - to - moderate disease , which can be controlled with maintenance therapy using ics monotherapy .
however , approximately 10 % of patients are considered to have severe disease .
these patients are not well controlled despite high - dose ics and long - acting beta2 - agonist ( laba ) therapy ; some of these patients may even require treatment with oral corticosteroids ( ocs ) [ 2 ] .
occasionally , patients dependent on ocs become refractory to therapy , a condition commonly known as refractory corticosteroid - dependent asthma ( rcda ) .
rcda does not have a simple definition .
the condition is characterized by the medication requirement for good disease control or persistent symptoms , asthma exacerbations , or airway obstruction regardless of high use of medication .
clinically , such patients may present with large variations in peak flows , rapid and progressive loss of lung function , severe but chronic airflow limitation , wide - ranging amounts of mucus production , and varying responses to corticosteroids [ 3 ] .
severe refractory asthma , including corticosteroid - dependent asthma , likely occurs in less than 5 % of cases [ 3 ] .
however , severe asthma accounts for a substantial proportion of total costs associated with treatment [ 4 ] .
rcda is very difficult to control ; therefore , alternative approaches are necessary to improve management of patients who suffer from it. here , a novel approach of switching a patient with rcda on fluticasone propionate ( fp ) plus salmeterol ( sal ) therapy to high - dose mometasone furoate delivered via a dry powder inhaler ( mf - dpi ) therapy was tested .
case presentation a 55 - year - old white male presented with rcda .
the patient had uncontrolled , severe , ocs - dependent allergic asthma and had been receiving inhaled combination therapy with fp 500 mug and sal 50 mug twice - daily ( fps ) along with ocs treatment in 6 - week cycles for the previous 7 months , in addition to montelukast 10 mg daily .
the fps therapy was stopped , and the patient was switched to mf - dpi 660 mug twice - daily for 6 weeks .
the patient continued ocs , montelukast , and as - needed albuterol therapy .
peak expiratory flow ( pef ) , coughing and wheezing , albuterol use , and ocs use were recorded at initiation ( baseline ) and at week 6 of mf - dpi 660 mug twice - daily treatment ; plasma cortisol levels at 8 a.m. were measured at week 6 .
after 6 - weeks of treatment with mf - dpi 600 mug twice - daily , clinical improvement was observed when compared with baseline .
pef increased from 375 l / min to 600 l / min ( table 1 ) .
after 1 week of high - dose mf - dpi treatment , the patient discontinued use of ocs .
the frequency of albuterol use decreased from 8 puffs / d to 4 puffs / d ( table 1 ) .
cough frequency decreased , and wheezing improved from continuous to no wheezing .
after 6 weeks of high - dose mf - dpi treatment , the plasma cortisol level at 8 a.m. was still within normal limits ( 8.4 mug / dl , normal range 4.3 - 22.6 mug / dl ) .
table 1 effects of mf - dpi on lung function , albuterol use , and cortisol levels baseline ( with fps ) week 6 ( with mf - dpi 660 microg bid ) pef , l / min 375 600 use of albuterol , puffs / d 8 4 8 am plasma cortisol , microg / dl * nd 8.4 bid , twice - daily ; fps , fluticasone propionate and salmeterol ; mf - dpi , mometasone furoate delivered via a dry powder inhaler ; nd , not determined ; pef , peak expiratory flow ; puffs / d , puffs per day .
* normal range is 4.3 - 22.6 microg / dl. the allergy skin prick testing ( aspt ) was conducted on the volar aspect of the forearms , using disposable hypodermic needles ( 26 gauge ) and commercially available aeroallergen solutions : pollens ( trees , including elm , maple , oak , 1:20 w / v ; grasses , including timothy , sweet vernal , bermuda , 10,000 bau / ml ; weeds , including ragweed , cocklebur , sheep sorrel , 1:20 w / v ) ; pet dander ( cat 10,000 bau / ml , dog 1:10 w / v ) ; dust mites ( dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and d. farinae 30,000 au / ml ) ; and molds ( including alternaria and cladosporium , 1:10 w / v ) .
positive and negative control solutions were also applied ( histamine phosphate 10 mg / ml and phosphate - buffered saline with 0.4 % phenol , respectively ) .
the aspt was positive to pollen , dust mite , molds , and cat dander .
discussion other alternative therapies have also been prescribed for refractory asthma .
immunomodulating drugs such as inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( etanercept ) [ 5 ] and intravenous immunoglobulins [ 6 ] have been used in treating refractory asthma ; however , no consistent improvement in lung function has been demonstrated .
the use of other corticosteroid - sparing drugs , including oral gold and methotrexate , has also been proposed in patients who are resistant to corticosteroids , but little therapeutic effect has been demonstrated and substantial safety concerns exist with these medications [ 2 ] .
in this patient with uncontrolled severe asthma , switching therapy from fps to high - dose mf - dpi reduced symptoms , decreased use of rescue medication , and established adequate disease control allowing for discontinuation of ocs therapy .
in addition , high - dose mf - dpi did not suppress the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis and had a favorable safety profile .
conclusion in conclusion , high - dose mf - dpi was found to be an effective and safe treatment option for patients with rcda who are receiving high - dose fps and ocs therapy .
the approach of switching patients with rcda to an alternate high - dose ics needs to be investigated in large , randomized , placebo - controlled trials .

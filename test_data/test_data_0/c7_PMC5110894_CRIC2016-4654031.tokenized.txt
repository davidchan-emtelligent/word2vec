aneurysms of the sinus of valsalva are very uncommon , with an incidence ranging from 0.1 to 3.5 % of all congenital heart defects .
very few cases have been reported in the literature that presented with involvement of two or more sinuses .
we report a case of 27 - year - old male with a history of exertional breathlessness of one - month duration .
after complete evaluation using transesophageal echocardiography ( tee ) and multiple detector computed tomography ( mdct ) scanning , the patient was diagnosed to have large congenital unruptured sinus of valsalva aneurysms involving both left and right coronary sinuses with extension into the interventricular septum .
the patient also displayed second - degree heart block ( mobitz type 2 ) and biventricular dysfunction .
the patient was managed successfully .
we present the case with an aim to highlight the management challenges including intraoperative and postoperative complications that are associated with unruptured sinus of valsalva aneurysms of >= 2 sinuses .
1. introduction aneurysm of sinus of valsalva is a rare congenital anomaly [ 1 ] .
further , the aneurysms of the sinus of valsalva rarely present with symptoms unless rupture occurs [ 2 ] .
we describe a symptomatic case of multiple unruptured aneurysms of sinus of valsalva , involving right and left aortic sinuses , with extensive dissection into the interventricular septum .
2. case report a 27 - year - old male with moderate build ( body mass index : 20 kg / m2 ) presented to our outpatient department with a history of exertional dyspnea ( class i ) of one - month duration with no history of associated chest pain or orthopnea .
he was apparently normal otherwise .
elsewhere , he was evaluated by a cardiologist .
his echocardiogram had revealed dilated aorta , left ventricular dysfunction , and pulmonary hypertension .
the patient was referred to our hospital for complete evaluation and management .
at the time of presentation , the patient had a pulse rate of 80 bpm and the blood pressure of 110 / 80 mmhg .
clinical examination revealed left ventricular apex , physiological splitting of s2 , and ejection systolic murmur of grade 3 / 6 in the left upper sternal border .
a 12 - lead electrocardiogram was performed , which showed right bundle branch block with first - degree heart block .
chest x - ray revealed cardiomegaly .
subsequent examination with 2d transthoracic echocardiography ( tte ) revealed diverticular formation from both left and right aortic sinuses .
transesophageal echocardiography ( tee ) further confirmed the findings of diverticular formation from both left and right aortic sinuses ( figure 1 ) .
it also revealed that the diverticulum from the right sinus extended into the interventricular septum .
further , aortic regurgitation of mild - to - moderate severity was noted due to the prolapse of left cusp into the left aneurysm of sinus of valsalva ( figure 2 ) .
biventricular dysfunction was present and aneurysm arising from the left aortic sinus contained a large layered thrombus , causing right ventricular outflow tract ( rvot ) obstruction ( rvot gradient : 30 mmhg ) ( figure 3 ) .
for further confirmation , multiple detector computed tomography ( mdct ) scanning was performed ( figures 4 and 5 ) , which revealed a diverticulum on both right and left coronary sinuses : a bilobed diverticulum from the left sinus with a maximum diameter of 5.4 x 5.7 cm was directed inferiorly and to left side ( figure 6 ) , while a 4.6 x 2.7 cm right diverticulum from the right sinus was bulging into the interventricular septum and was directed anteroinferiorly ( figure 6 ) .
further , the right coronary artery was seen arising on the side of the right diverticulum , while left coronary artery was seen arising from the roof of left diverticulum ( figure 7 ) .
holter monitoring revealed an intermittent second - degree atrioventricular block ( mobitz type 2 ) .
subsequently , all the acquired causes of sinus of valsalva aneurysms were ruled out by necessary investigations .
patient was planned for bentall procedure and permanent pacemaker implantation .
intraoperative aortotomy was performed , following which there was dissection around root , leading to injury in the ostium segment of right coronary artery ( rca ) and narrowing of the ostium segment of left main coronary artery .
hence , cabg was decided .
the aortic root was replaced with a 23 mm st. jude medical mechanical valve conduit .
later , cabg was performed for left anterior descending ( lad ) artery , obtuse marginal artery , and distal rca from reversed saphenous vein grafts .
postoperatively , the patient developed congestive heart failure .
echocardiogram displayed a large pericardial effusion which was drained by left lateral thoracotomy .
after three days , a permanent pacemaker ( st. jude medical ) was implanted for second - degree atrioventricular block .
patient 's condition improved subsequently and he was discharged after 2 days after an uneventful hospital stay .
at follow - up after about 8 months , the patient remained asymptomatic and was leading a regular healthy life .
repeated tte revealed a significant improvement in the biventricular function and significant reduction in the rvot gradient .
3. discussion sinus of valsalva aneurysms is extremely rare , accounting for about 0.1 % to 3.5 % of all the congenital heart defects [ 1 ] .
among the sinuses usually involved , it has been estimated that involvement of right coronary sinus is the most frequent , followed by noncoronary sinus , while left coronary sinus involvement is the rarest of all [ 3 ] .
further , the cases of multiple aneurysms of sinus of valsalva are very rare .
here , we present a case of multiple aneurysms of sinus of valsalva with involvement of left coronary sinus along with right coronary sinus .
in general , patients with unruptured aneurysm of sinus of valsalva are usually asymptomatic until a rupture occurs into one of the heart chambers , leading to overt heart failure .
such patients with unruptured sinus of valsalva aneurysm are usually diagnosed incidentally during routine echocardiography .
however , there have been very few reports which describe a presentation of symptomatic patients with unruptured aneurysm of sinus of valsalva [ 2 ] .
conversely , the patient in the present case presented with class i exertional dyspnea with no history of associated chest pain .
he also exhibited pulmonary hypertension , biventricular dysfunction , second - degree heart block , mild - to - moderate aortic regurgitation , right bundle branch block , thrombus within an aneurysmal sac , and rvot obstruction .
in general , two - dimensional and doppler echocardiography is adequate to diagnose unruptured sinus of valsalva aneurysms [ 2 ] .
in addition to this , we used mdct scanning to further confirm the diagnosis and to characterize the precise size of the aneurysms in three dimensions .
we ruled out all the acquired causes of sinus of valsalva aneurysm ( i.e. , atherosclerotic , infective , medial cystic necrosis , connective tissue disorders , or trauma ) [ 4 ] by doing the necessary investigations in the present case .
the management of unruptured aneurysm of sinus of valsalva generally involves surgical repair [ 2 ] .
in the present case , the patient underwent bentall procedure .
however , coronary artery bypass grafting ( cabg ) was performed as a result of an intraoperative complication including injury in the ostium rca , narrowing of ostium left main coronary artery , and pericardial effusion , which were managed successfully .
subsequently , a permanent pacemaker was implanted .
after procedure , the condition of the patient improved significantly and he remained asymptomatic on 8 - month follow - up .
4. conclusion we suggest fellow interventional cardiologists that appropriate prophylactic surgical treatment of the aneurysm may help in preventing intraoperative or postoperative complications .

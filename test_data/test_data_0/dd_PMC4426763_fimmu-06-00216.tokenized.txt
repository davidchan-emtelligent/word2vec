progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( pml ) has been described in association with a variety of predisposing risk factors , including hiv / aids , lymphoproliferative disorders and , most recently , treatment with a range of biologics , most notably natalizumab in multiple sclerosis ( ms ) ( 1 ) .
however , while these underlying disorders appear to be ( usually ) necessary , they are not sufficient to predict the development of pml , since only a small fraction of such individuals will succumb , raising the question of whether host genetic factors must also play a role .
evidence is mounting that this is , indeed , the case but more work needs to be done to fully delineate these underlying genetic factors .
finally , while it is possible that an underlying genetic susceptibility for pml in general will be uncovered in the future , the current evidence argues for a collection of multiple , individually rare underlying susceptibilities ( with one predominant single genetic susceptibility in each individual ) , as described in this review .
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy host genetic factors primary immunodeficiencies pml predisposition natalizumab introduction progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( pml ) is a severe , potentially fatal , cns infection .
it is " caused " by reactivation of the jc virus ( jcv ) .
however , while jcv is present at very high rates in the general population , pml remains a rare disorder , albeit an important one because of the clinical sequelae , and the recently demonstrated association with a variety of useful therapies , in particular natalizumab in multiple sclerosis ( ms ) .
a number of risk factors for pml have been described but these are better viewed as necessary but not sufficient .
the majority of individuals with these risk factors do not develop pml and so the obvious question is " in addition to the well - known risk factors for pml , are there host genetic factors that also play a role ? ?
" traditional " risk factors for pml this is a topic that has been well reviewed in the literature [ for a recent comprehensive discussion , see ref. ( 1 )] .
in brief , while rare individuals have been reported , in whom no obvious risk factors are present ( 2 ) , the majority of individuals have a history of profound cellular immunosuppression , whether associated with systemic disorders , such as hiv , lymphoproliferative disease , rheumatological disorders ( sle , for example ) , or else treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies .
historically , pml ( first described in the 1950s ) was known mainly as a disease associated with lymphoproliferative disorders .
knowledge of pml increased with the advent of aids , as 4 - 5 % of patients developed pml .
in recent years , pml has come to prominence in the context of the drug natalizumab , an effective biologic used in the treatment of ms. pml has also been described in association with other biologics [ reviewed in ref .
( 1 )] and , most recently , with the use of drugs containing fumarates ( used in the treatment of psoriasis and also the ms drug tecfidera ) ( 3 ) .
the important point is that while these risk factors are highly relevant , they do not , on their own , predict who will develop pml , since the vast majority of individuals with these risk factors will not develop the disorder .
clearly , other factors need to be considered and there is growing evidence for the role of host genetic factors in susceptibility to pml .
finally , the rare description of individuals that have developed pml in the complete absence of any known " traditional " risk factor argues very strongly for the presence of host genetic factors that result in an inability to effectively deal with jcv .
precedents for genetic predisposition to specific infectious disease many factors / conditions are known to predispose to infectious disease in general .
however , what is of greater interest is the existence of genetic syndromes that appear to predispose to severe infection with very specific infectious agents .
a classical example is x - linked lymphoproliferative syndrome ( xlp ) , a primary immunodeficiency disorder ( pid ) characterized by severe immune dysregulation often after viral infection , typically with epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) .
xlp is present in two forms , each associated with mutations in a different gene : xlp1 is associated with sh2d1a mutations , while xlp2 is associated with xiap mutations .
both genes are located in xq25 ( 4 ) .
more recently , herpes simplex virus encephalitis ( hse ) , a rare complication of infection with hsv - 1 has been shown to be associated with deficiency of tlr3 at 4q35.1 ( 5 ) .
known / suspected genetic predispositions for pml the association of pml with rare immune deficiency syndromes is suggested by a number of case reports , some of which predated the ability to confirm the clinical diagnosis of the underlying disorder by specific gene testing .
table 1 summarizes specific pids in which pml has been reported , along with estimates for the numbers of distinct pml cases observed .

a similar disorder , was2 , is caused by recessive mutations in wipf11 , at 2q31.1 .
there are five reports of pml in association with clinically diagnosed was .
it is unclear why was is the most common pid described in association with pml .
this may simply be due to ascertainment bias , given that the small number of cases reported early on may have alerted clinicians to specifically test for this condition .
alternatively , this may simply be a sampling issue , given the rarity of pml .
severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome ( scid ) refers to a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of disorders with defective cellular and humoral immune function .
there have been at least two reports of pml in association with scid .
x - linked hyper - igm syndrome x - linked hyper - igm syndrome is caused by mutations in the cd40lg ( aka tnfsf5 ) gene at xq26.3 .
it is a rare immunodeficiency characterized by normal / elevated igm levels but markedly decreased igg , iga , and ige resulting in a profound susceptibility to bacterial infections and an increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections .
it has been described in four patients reported as having pml .
hyper - ige syndrome hyper - ige recurrent infection syndrome is a pid characterized by chronic eczema , recurrent staphylococcal infections , increased serum ige , and eosinophilia .
it may be associated with dominant mutations in stat3 at 17q21.2 , recessive mutations in dock8 at 9p24.3 , or recessive mutations in tyk2 at 19p13.2 ( only one case reported ) .
most recently , a patient with pml was reported with a > 500 kb homozygous deletion encompassing a number of genes in 9p24.3 , with dock8 the strongest candidate for pml susceptibility .
finally , there was also a report of a patient with pml associated with dock8 mutation in 2010 .
icf syndrome immunodeficiency , centromeric instability , and facial dysmorphism ( icf ) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome associated with mutations in dnmt3b at 20q11.21 .
one pml case has been reported in a patient with icf .
adenosine deaminase deficiency inherited adenosine deaminase ( ada ) deficiency causes a spectrum of disease , from scid , presenting in infancy and usually resulting in early death , to a later onset at age 6 - 24 months , and , finally , a small percentage of cases with a " later " onset , presenting from 4 years of age to adulthood .
the disorder is associated with mutations in ada at 20q13.12 .
there has been one case of pml reported in the context of ada deficiency .
idiopathic cd4 deficiency idiopathic cd4 lymphocytopenia ( icl ) is a syndrome described in patients with low counts of cd4 cells and no other causes for immunosuppression .
a few cases of pml have been described in association with this entity .
mutations in a number of genes have been reported in association with icl , including rag1 at 11p.12 , mst1 at 3p21.31 , lck at 1p35.1 , and itk at 5q33.3 .
one case of pml has been reported in association with icl .
x - linked agammaglobulinemia x - linked agammaglobulinemia ( xla ) is caused by mutations in the btk gene at xq22.1 .
it results in an immunodeficiency characterized by failure to produce mature b lymphocytes and is associated with a failure of ig heavy chain rearrangement .
one case of pml has been reported in association with xla .
purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( pnp ) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive immunodeficiency disorder characterized mainly by decreased t cell function .
it is caused by mutations in the pnp gene at 14q11.2 one case has been reported with pml .
stat1 gain of function mutations in stat1 ( 2q32.2 ) have been implicated in a number of disorders , including susceptibility to a variety of infectious agents , depending on which of four main subtypes of stat1 is present .
in one study describing the association between stat gain of function mutations and disseminated coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis , one of five patients was reported with pml .
challenges of genetic studies into pml while the reports of rare individuals with pml in association with a confirmed pid immediately suggest a set of candidate genes that should be routinely searched for in pml patients , even when no such obvious ( clinical ) diagnosis has been made , it is possible that a more subtle and specific immunodeficiency will explain the majority of cases of pml , namely an immunodeficiency that is not clinically recognizable except in the context of jcv ( i.e. , one that does not result in other opportunistic infections , as is the case for xlp and specific susceptibility to ebv , or has other obvious associated clinical features that would lead to a diagnosis of a known pid ) .
however , it is important to note that precedents do exist for the role of mendelian genes , initially identified in severe disorders , being relevant to general populations in whom the severe phenotype is not present .
an example of this has recently been demonstrated in late - onset alzheimer 's disease ( load ) , with the finding that rare variants in psen1 , psen2 , and app increase the risk of alzheimer 's in load families .
while a candidate gene list presents itself , there do remain significant challenges for the genetic dissection of pml predisposition , not only because the examples of pids described in association with pml are likely to account for only a small subset of the overall susceptibility to this disorder but because of more general considerations .
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy remains an uncommon disorder , whose geographical distribution is wide .
very few specialists / centers have seen more than a handful of cases and collecting samples from sufficient numbers of cases has been challenging .
furthermore , based on the number of distinct pids in which pml has been reported in at least some cases , it is likely that the number of genes that might predispose to pml is significant , so that the unbiased identification of rare , causal variants will prove very difficult using modern whole genome or exome sequencing methods , for example , since the degree of background variation is simply too great to achieve statistical significance .
the challenge of using next generation sequencing approaches is exacerbated by the possibility that some mutations may be dominantly acting ( i.e. , heterozygotes have the genetic susceptibility ) , a class of variants for which inferring causality is much more challenging than recessive disorders .
furthermore , the usual " tricks " employed to find significant causal variants in human genetic disorders either via traditional approaches or using ngs cannot be used because : there are no : families with mendelian inheritance of pml ( useful for traditional linkage analysis and / or segregation analysis of variants in suspected candidate genes ) , since , even were a dominant mutation to be segregating , it is highly unlikely that all carriers would also have the other , requisite , predispositions ( underlying cellular immune suppression of whatever cause , for example ) ; obvious examples of pml arising as a result of a de novo mutation [ in some childhood syndromes , such as severe intellectual disability ( where parents are phenotypically normal ) , searches for de novo mutations have been fruitful ] ; other clinical / phenotypic clues that may aid in delineation of more specific subsets , for which correlations with underlying genetics may be useful ( as occurs frequently in id , wherein many id syndromes are associated with specific physical manifestations that permit more specific disease delineation ) .
discovery of the set of variants that underlie predisposition to pml is likely to depend on a combination of consideration of strong candidate genes , in addition to those linked to already described pids .
however , this is still a large class , based on the high number of genetically distinct conditions that are associated with immune suppression ; unbiased , genome - wide searches for causal variants , coupled with intelligent filtering of variants , based on known pids along with gene function as related to the immune system .
however , such genome - wide searches for novel variants underlying pml development will not be straightforward ; the use of larger cohorts of pml subjects than has hitherto been possible .
potential benefits of uncovering genetic pml - susceptibility variants in the short term , the ability to more accurately predict who is at high risk of developing pml will be of enormous benefit in the context of drug treatment with compounds ( mostly biologics ) that are highly effective in their disease context ( natalizumab in ms , for example ) but carry a small risk of a devastating disorder .
the hope is that patients in whom a course of treatment is being planned with such a drug would undergo initial , companion diagnostic testing , in order to effectively exclude those that were at high risk of pml , in the process reassuring those with negative tests about their dramatically reduced risk of developing pml .
currently , the only approach in this direction is based on testing for the presence of jcv , since jcv is an absolute pre - requisite for pml development ( 24 ) .
however , because jcv is present in a large percentage of the normal population , this approach effectively excludes a significant proportion of patients from a treatment that is highly effective .
in fact , it is possible that testing for jcv virus will not achieve its stated aim and patients will elect to accept the risk of pml , in return for improved quality of life on drug treatment ( e.g. , natalizumab in ms ) .
conclusion there appear to be three major criteria that must be fulfilled before pml occurs : jcv is present ; some form of cellular immune suppression is present , whether due to underlying systemic disease ( such as hematological malignancy ) or treatment with immunosuppressives ( especially biologics , such as natalizumab ) ; host ( genetic ) susceptibility to develop pml ; for those rare individuals in whom no specific immune suppression is present in the medical history , there are two probably only essential factors : jcv is present ; host ( genetic ) susceptibility to develop pml .
while there has been good progress in unraveling the epidemiology of pml , there is now some urgency to uncover as many of the underlying genetic variants as possible , primarily to create an effective and specific screening test that will determine , as definitively as possible , which patients should not be treated with a given therapeutic ( ms , for example , when natalizumab is being considered ) and which patients can safely ( with dramatically reduced risk ) be treated .
finally , an improved understanding of the etiology of pml may , in the longer term , provide insights that will lead to therapies for individuals in whom pml has arisen as a result of their underlying disease , rather than a chosen treatment ( e.g. , hiv / aids and lymphoproliferative disorders ) .

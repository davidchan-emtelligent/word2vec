doi : 10.3897 / zookeys.587.7674 introduction panorpidae are the largest family in mecoptera , and currently consist of approximately 400 species in six genera worldwide ( hu et al. 2015 ) .
panorpids are commonly called scorpionflies , because the genitalia of their males are globular and recurved over the back , resembling the tail of a scorpion ( byers and thornhill 1983 ; bicha et al. 2015 ) .
scorpionflies mostly live in humid , high - elevated and vegetation - rich habitats ( byers and thornhill 1983 ; byers 2002a ) .
males of many scorpionflies offer nuptial gifts to the female during courtship and copulation , and use the clamp - like notal organ on the third tergum to seize the anterior edge of the wings of the female ( zhong and hua 2013a ) .
these insects are frequently considered to represent ideal models for the study of mating systems and behavior in insects ( ma and hua 2011a ; zhong et al. 2015a ) .
however , the males of furcatopanorpa longihypovalva ( hua & cai , 2009 ) lack a notal organ , and assume an unusual o - shaped position during copulation ( zhong et al. 2015b ) .
panorpa linnaeus , 1758 is the most speciose genus in panorpidae , consisting of approximately 252 species worldwide and 111 species in china to date ( esben - petersen 1921 ; carpenter 1945 ; byers 1970 ; 2002b ; chou et al .
1981 ; fu and hua 2009 ; zhang and hua 2012 ; zhong and hua 2013b ) .
panorpa differs from neopanorpa weele , 1909 and leptopanorpa maclachlan , 1875 by the vein 1a ending at or beyond the level of the origin of rs , in addition to genital features ( cheng 1957 ) .
based on morphological and molecular data ( misof et al. 2000 ; ma et al. 2011 , 2012 ; hu et al .
2015 ) , the genus panorpa has been confirmed to be a paraphyletic group .
recently , three genera have been established from panorpa linnaeus : sinopanorpa cai & hua in cai et al .
2008 ( 3 spp. ) , furcatopanorpa ma & hua , 2011 ( 1 sp. ) and dicerapanorpa zhong & hua , 2013 ( 8 spp. ) .
yunnan is a province in southwestern china and well - known for its richness in biodiversity ( yang et al. 2004 ) .
historically , five species of panorpa were recorded from yunnan .
recently , panorpa kimminsi carpenter , 1948 , panorpa triclada qian & zhou , 2001 , and panorpa tjederi carpenter , 1938 were transferred to dicerapanorpa zhong & hua , 2013 .
consequently , only two species , panorpa issikiana byers , 1970 and panorpa kunmingensis fu & hua , 2009 , remain in the genus panorpa from yunnan .
in our recent survey in the mount daxueshan , the southernmost prolongation of the hengduan mountains , numerous scorpionfly specimens were collected and determined to belong to two undescribed species of panorpa linnaeus , raising the number of panorpa species to four in yunnan province , and to 113 throughout china .
material and methods specimens examined in this study were captured with collecting nets and temporarily preserved in 75 % ethanol .
after observation and initial measurements , some type materials were pinned as permanent preservation and deposited in the entomological museum , northwest a & f university , china ( nwau ) .
measurements of the right wings of 20 males and 20 females of the two new species were made with a vernier calliper , calculated with microsoft excel 2010 and are presented as mean +/ - sd ( standard deviation ) .
some genitalia were macerated in 10 % naoh solution for 3 minutes and then rinsed with tap water .
photographs were taken with a nikon d7000 digital camera , and further treated with adobe photoshop cs4 .
dissections and observations were made under a nikon smz 1500 microscope .
the abdominal segments are described as abbreviates , e.g. , a1 is the first segment .

panorpa parallela sp. n. is similar to panorpa rufostigma westwood , 1842 from europe in the reddish pterostigma , but can be recognized by its greatly reduced wing markings ( cf. wing markings well - developed ) .
panorpa parallela resembles panorpa chengi chou , 1981 from shaanxi province , china in body coloration , especially the pale - brown thoracic terga , but can be differentiated from the latter by the reddish pterostigma and the wing pattern ( cf. pterostigma indistinct , wings devoid of markings ) .
the two new species , panorpa reflexa and panorpa parallela , resemble each other in general appearance at first glance .
in living animals , the wings are held in close contact along the mid - line over the abdomen , and in the same plane at repose ( fig. 4 ) .
this condition is different for most species of panorpa , the wings of which are mostly divergent and kept in a v - shape over the abdomen at repose. habitat .
in the type locality , mount daxueshan , these two species share the same habitat among several mountain valleys with streams around an elevation of 2000 m. suitable microhabitats lie mostly in a slope surrounded by evergreen broad - leaved forests and with dense herbaceous groundcover ( fig. 8 ) .
in the daytime of august , these valleys are mostly overspread with mist , receiving little direct sunlight , and the temperature ranges approximately from 16 to 22 degreesc .

however , the underlying mechanisms remain unclear .
here we show that bcl - 3 , a member of the ikappab family , serves as a critical regulator in tgfbeta signaling to modulate breast cancer pulmonary metastasis .
bcl - 3 expression was significantly associated with metastasis - free survival in breast cancer patients .
bcl - 3 deletion inhibited the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro , as well as breast cancer lung metastasis in vivo .
bcl - 3 was required for the expression of downstream tgfbeta signaling genes that are involved in breast cancer lung metastasis .
bcl - 3 knockdown enhanced the degradation of smad3 but not smad2 following tgfbeta treatment .
bcl - 3 could bind to smad3 and prevent the ubiquitination and degradation of smad3 protein .
these results indicate that bcl - 3 serves as a promising target to prevent breast tumor lung metastasis .
metastasis is the final and fatal stage of solid tumor progression and is responsible for most cancer - associated mortality .
transforming growth factor beta ( tgfbeta ) signaling has been implicated in many steps of metastasis and is positively associated with the distant metastasis of various types of cancers , including breast cancer.1 , 2 , 3 studies based on mouse models of breast cancer have shown that tgfbeta signaling suppresses tumorigenesis but enhances the induction of epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) and tumor invasion , consequently , promoting the seeding of lung metastases via genes like angiopoietin - like 4 ( angptl4 ). 3 , 4 , 5 the activation of tgfbeta signaling results in the phosphorylation of transcription factors smad2 and smad3 , which accumulate in the nucleus in association with smad4 and transactivate downstream target genes.6 , 7 recent reports have shown that smad2 and smad3 may have different roles in cancer metastasis .
in particular , smad3 enhances metastasis , whereas smad2 suppresses metastasis.8 , 9 importantly , the reversible phosphorylation and ubiquitination of smad2 and smad3 proteins are indispensable processes that regulate tgfbeta signaling.10 , 11 nedd4l has been reported to specifically recognize a tgfbeta - induced phospho - thr - protyr motif in the linker region of smad2 / 3 via the ww domain , which results in smad2 / 3 polyubiquitination and degradation.12 otub1 inhibits the ubiquitination of phospho - smad2 / 3 by binding to and inhibiting the e2 ubiquitin - conjugating enzymes , independent of its deubiquitinase activity.13 the rbx1 - scfbeta - trcp e3 ligase complex targets activated smad3 for nuclear export and ubiquitin - mediated degradation upon its association with the transcriptional co - activator p300.14 however , the proteins that participate in the regulation of smad3 degradation are largely unknown .
b - cell lymphoma 3 ( bcl - 3 ) is a proto - oncogene in the region adjacent to the t ( 14 ; 19 ) ( q32 ; q13 ) translocation that was first identified in a subset of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll ). 15 unlike other members of the ikappab family , bcl - 3 cannot inhibit nf - kappab nuclear translocation but binds to p50 and p52 dimers on dna and provides the complex with transactivation ability.16 , 17 , 18 bcl - 3 has important roles in innate and adaptive immunity.19 , 20 in addition , bcl - 3 expression has been shown to increase in a variety of hematopoietic and solid cancers , including breast cancer , to regulate tumor development and progression.21 , 22 , 23 the protein cylindromatosis ( cyld ) binds and deubiquitinates bcl - 3 , thereby prevents its nuclear accumulation.26 in cylindromas and many other cancers with reduced cyld expression,27 increased nuclear accumulation of bcl - 3 induces the transcription of target genes , such as cyclin d1 and n - cadherin , by interacting with nf - kappab p50 and p52 homodimers.24 , 25 , 26 , 27 these data suggest that bcl - 3 may serve as an oncogene by regulating the cell cycle or apoptosis at the gene and protein levels during cancer development .
we have showed that bcl - 3 stabilizes c - myc protein and promotes colorectal cancer development by regulating erk signaling.22 bcl - 3 was recently reported to promote colorectal tumorigenesis through activation of akt signaling.28 the above evidence reveals that bcl - 3 has many novel roles in tumor development and progression beyond being a trans - activator or trans - repressor .
recently , bcl - 3 has been demonstrated to regulate the metastasis of mouse breast cancer cells.21 bcl - 3 knockout mmtv - neu mice resulted in reduced tumor lung metastasis with no effect on primary tumor growth.21 however , the underlying mechanisms of this metastasis remain unknown .
here we report that bcl - 3 functions as a critical regulator of tgfbeta signaling by stabilizing smad3 to promote the pulmonary metastasis of breast cancer .
results bcl - 3 expression is associated with the metastasis of breast cancer we have previously reported that bcl - 3 was upregulated in human colorectal cancer compared with normal tissues.22 bcl - 3 expression has increased in breast cancers compared with normal mammary tissues.29 , 30 here we assessed bcl - 3 mrna expression levels based on the cancer genome atlas ( tcga ) breast cancer ( brca ) data31 and the expression of bcl - 3 mrna in tumors was much higher than tumor - matched normal tissues ( n = 99 ) ( figure 1a ) .
next , we detected the bcl - 3 expression of different breast cancer cell lines .
bcl - 3 was highly expressed in malignant breast cancer cell lines but undetectable in mcf - 10a , a normal mammary epithelial cell line ( figure 1b ) .
interestingly , the levels of bcl - 3 correlated with the pulmonary metastatic potential since highly metastatic cell lines lm2 expressed more bcl - 3 than cell lines with poor metastatic abilities like mcf - 10a and mcf - 7 ( figure 1b ). these results suggest that bcl - 3 expression correlate with the pulmonary metastasis of breast cancer .
we then evaluated the elevated expression of bcl - 3 with metastatic progression and metastasis - free survival in breast cancer patients .
patients with breast cancers ( n = 116 , p = 0.025 ) that expressed higher mrna levels of bcl - 3 had a significantly lower metastasis - free survival than patients whose tumors expressed lower levels of bcl - 3 ( figure 1c ) .
the same results were found in estrogen receptor negative ( er - ) ( n = 75 , p = 0.040 , figure 1d ) and er - pr - ( progesterone receptors negative ) ( n = 53 , p = 0.031 , figure 1e ) breast cancers .
these findings demonstrate a clinical significance of bcl - 3 in breast cancer and raise the need to further understand the function of bcl - 3 in breast tumor metastasis .
loss of bcl - 3 inhibits the pulmonary metastasis of breast cancer in vivo to investigate the effects of bcl - 3 on the pulmonary metastasis of breast cancer in vivo , we depleted bcl - 3 in different breast cancer cell lines using an inducible tet - on lentivirus system.22 after infection with lentivirus , the cells were exposed to doxycycline ( dox ) ( 1 mug / ml ) for more than 4 days , and the expression of bcl - 3 was downregulated ( supplementary figure 1c ) .
dox treatment did not affect the viability of cells ( data not shown ) .
we injected shrna1 - transduced lm2 cells , which were derived from parental mda - mb - 231 cells that exhibit highly pulmonary metastasis capability,22 , 32 into nude mice via the tail vein , resulting in a substantial number of metastatic pulmonary nodules .
the mice were fed with water containing dox ( 2 mug / ml ) to induce bcl - 3 silencing .
the pulmonary metastatic ability was assessed based on the luciferase activity on days 0 , 14 , 28 and 42 ( figure 2a ) .
dox - inducible bcl - 3 knockdown cells exhibited lower photon flux than the control group .
the mice were sacrificed after 7 weeks , and an analysis of the lung tissues indicated that bcl - 3 knockdown reduced the number of metastatic pulmonary nodules ( figure 2b ) .
to confirm our observation in lm2 cells , we generated bcl - 3 - sufficient and bcl - 3 - deficient mmtv - pymt mice , an aggressive transgenic mouse model of murine mammary adenocarcinoma development ( mmtv - polyoma middle t ( pymt ) mice ). 33 we found no gross histopathologic or quantitative differences between the groups based on primary tumor development or tumor burden ( supplementary figure 2a ) .
strikingly , loss of bcl - 3 resulted in the attenuated pulmonary metastasis of breast cancer , as measured by significantly reduced numbers of metastatic foci and decreased tumor burden ( figure 2c ) .
the pulmonary metastasis of mammary adenocarcinomas in mmtv - pymt mice depends on hematopoietic cells , including cd4 + t cells , macrophages and tgfbeta signaling.34 to verify the role of bcl - 3 in the pulmonary metastasis of cancer cells , we transferred wild - type ( wt ) bone marrow into lethally irradiated bcl - 3 - sufficient or bcl - 3 - deficient mmtv - pymt mice .
we observed increased primary tumor volumes but significantly reduced numbers of lung metastatic foci in bcl - 3 - deficient mmtv - pymt mice ( supplementary figure 2b and figure 2d ) .
in addition , we injected cells from primary tumors of bcl - 3 - sufficient and bcl - 3 - deficient mmtv - pymt mice into the mammary gland of fvb mice .
comparable volumes of primary tumors from both bcl - 3 - sufficient and bcl - 3 - deficient breast cancer cells were observed ( data not shown ) .
however , the number of metastatic pulmonary nodules was significantly reduced in mice injected with cancer cells from bcl - 3 - null mmtv - pymt mice compared with wt mmtv - pymt mice ( figure 2e ) .
importantly , the reduced lung tumor burden in bcl - 3 - ablated lungs translated into significantly prolonged survival after tumor initiation ( figure 2f ) .
these results demonstrate that bcl - 3 promotes pulmonary metastasis but not tumorigenesis in breast cancer .
to investigate the effects of bcl - 3 on pulmonary metastatic potential of breast cancer cells , we used in vitro systems to assess changes in cell motility and invasion .
knockdown of bcl - 3 with two shrna sequences in both mda - mb - 231 and lm2 cells led to significantly reduced migration ( figures 3a and c,supplementary figure 6c and d ) and matrigel invasion ( figures 3b and d , supplementary figure 6c and d ) ability .
wound - healing assay showed that bcl - 3 depletion significantly reduced cell migration compared with control cells in lm2 and 4t1 cells ( figures 3e and f and supplementary figure 6b ) .
together , these results suggest that bcl - 3 promotes the pulmonary metastasis of breast cancer cells by regulating the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells .
bcl - 3 regulates tgfbeta target gene expression to explore how bcl - 3 modulates the pulmonary metastasis of breast cancer , we detected a number of genes which are responsible for the enhanced pulmonary metastasis in lm2 cells , which has highly metastatic potential35 and autocrine production of tgfbeta ( supplementary figure 3b ) .
bcl - 3 deletion significantly reduced the expression of tgfbeta target genes id1 ( inhibitor of dna binding 1 ) , id3 ( inhibitor of dna binding 1 ) , mmp1 ( matrix metallopeptidase 1 ) , and cox2 ( cytochrome c oxidase subunit ii ) in lm2 cells ( figure 4a ) .
next , globally profiled gene expression were performed to analyze genes affected by bcl - 3 depletion in mda - mb - 231 cells .
bcl - 3 knockdown resulted in the differential expression of 1485 genes (> 2 - fold , p < 0.05 ) ; 552 different genes were significantly upregulated (> 2 - fold increase , p < 0.05 ) , while 933 were significantly downregulated (< 2 - fold decrease , p < 0.05 ) ( figure 4c ) .
gene ontology analysis showed that the most significantly reduced genes were associated with adherent junctions and the tgfbeta signaling pathway , suggesting that bcl - 3 might be involved in tgfbeta signaling ( figure 4b ) .
to confirm that bcl - 3 was essential for tgfbeta - related gene expression , we compared gene expression patterns in bcl - 3 - sufficient and bcl - 3 - deficient mda - mb - 231 cells after 24 h tgfbeta stimulation .
bcl - 3 knockdown caused a significant decrease in the expression of several tgfbeta - responsive genes and pulmonary metastasis - related genes ( figure 4c ) .
microarray analysis revealed that 1049 genes were affected by tgfbeta stimulation ( 428 induced and 621 repressed , > 2 - fold , figure 4d ) , and knockdown of bcl - 3 after tgfbeta stimulation affected 1458 genes ( 396 induced and 1062 repressed , > 2 - fold , figure 4d ) .
in addition , gene expression profiles revealed an overlap ( 355 genes ) between affected genes of tgfbeta stimulation and knockdown of bcl - 3 after tgfbeta stimulation ( figure 4d ) .
tgfbeta primes lm2 cancer cells for pulmonary metastasis seeding via angiopoietin - like potein 4 ( angptl4 ). 3 the basal and tgfbeta - induced angptl4 mrna levels were remarkably reduced in bcl - 3 depleted mda - mb - 231 and lm2 cells compared with control cells ( figure 4e ) .
the functions of id1 and id3 are similar and redundant in regulating pulmonary metastasis,36 and bcl - 3 deletion reduced protein levels of both id1 and id3 ( figure 4f ) .
similarly , the tgfbeta - induced levels of pai - 1 , pthrp , ctgf , and il - 11 ( supplementary figure 3a ) were dramatically decreased in bcl - 3 - silenced mda - mb - 231 cells .
id1 , id3 and snail , which are downstream targets of tgfbeta signaling,37 have been reported to enhance emt and tumor metastasis.36 we observed the protein levels of id3 and snail induced by tgfbeta in bcl - 3 - depleted mda - mb - 231 cells were profoundly reduced compared with the control cells .
tgfbeta did not induce id1 expression in mda - mb - 231 cells , tgfbeta instead reduced it when bcl - 3 was absent ( figure 4f ) .
consistently , bcl - 3 knockdown with shrna1 sequence led to a significant reduction in wound healing induced by tgfbeta in mda - mb - 231 cells ( figure 4g ) .
in lm2 cells not mda - mb - 231 cells , bcl - 3 knockdown led to the reduction in wound healing even without tgfbeta treatment ( figure 3e ) , the reason may be the higher autocrine production of tgfbeta in lm2 cells ( supplementary figure 3b ) .
taken together , these results indicate that bcl - 3 promotes breast cancer metastasis and invasion by regulating tgfbeta signaling .
bcl - 3 regulates tgfbeta signaling by stabilizing smad3 protein to characterize how bcl - 3 regulates tgfbeta signaling , we examined the phosphorylation of smad proteins in control and bcl - 3 - silenced mda - mb - 231 cells .
bcl - 3 knockdown did not influence the early phosphorylation and total levels of smad2 or smad4 induced by tgfbeta .
surprisingly , the phosphorylation and total protein levels of smad3 decreased after tgfbeta treatment in bcl - 3 knockdown cells , and these changes were similar with id1 protein expression ( figure 5a,supplementary figures 3c , d ) .
consistent results were obtained in bcl - 3 - depleted lm2 , mcf - 7 cells and the mouse breast cancer cell line 4t1 ( supplementary figures 3e - g ) .
the results above indicate the correlation between bcl - 3 and smad3 .
then we considered the protein level of bcl - 3 and smad3 in some breast cancer cells with different metastasis potential .
our results showed that these two proteins expressed consistently in these cells , as mcf - 10a exhibited lowest bcl - 3 and smad3 while lm2 cells showed the highest levels of bcl - 3 and smad3 ( figure 5b ) .
to explore whether bcl - 3 modulates smad3 - mediated gene transcription , we utilized a tgfbeta reporter plasmid38 to measure the tgfbeta - induced transcriptional activity .
knockdown of bcl - 3 with two shrna sequences significantly inhibited the tgfbeta reporter luciferase activity induced by tgfbeta in mda - mb - 231 ( figure 5c ) and mcf - 7 ( supplementary figure 3h ) cells .
these data indicate that bcl - 3 regulates tgfbeta signaling by affecting the protein levels of smad3 but not smad2 or smad4 .
the depletion of bcl - 3 in breast cancer cells reduced the steady - state levels of smad3 protein upon tgfbeta stimulation but no change in the smad3 mrna level ( figure 5d ) .
these data suggest that bcl - 3 regulates the smad3 levels via a posttranscriptional mechanism .
furthermore , the treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor mg132 restored the smad3 protein levels decreased by bcl - 3 knockdown after tgfbeta treatment , confirming that smad3 was degraded by the ubiquitin - proteasome system ( figure 5e ) .
these data indicate that bcl - 3 depletion increases the proteasome - dependent degradation of smad3 following tgfbeta stimulation .
indeed , smad3 was found to be ubiquitinated in a k48 - linked but not k63 - linked manner in bcl - 3 - depleted mda - mb - 231 cells after mg132 treatment and tgfbeta stimulation ( figure 5f and supplementary figure 3j ) .
an e3 ubiquitin ligase complex rbx1 - scfbeta - trcp is responsible for the ubiquitination of tgfbeta - activated smad3.14 this e3 ligase complex is composed of rbx1 ( ring box protein 1 ) , skp1 , cullin1 and beta - trcp.14 however , the depletion of rbx1 or beta - trcp could not lead to an accumulation of smad3 in bcl - 3 - sufficient or bcl - 3 - silenced mda - mb - 231 cells following tgfbeta stimulation ( figure 5g ) .
these results indicate that bcl - 3 stabilizes smad3 via the ubiquitination dependent degradation pathway , but not regulated by the e3 ligase complex rbx1 - scfbeta - trcp .
in addition , the significantly reduced invasion and wound - healing migration rates caused by the knockdown of bcl - 3 were partially rescued by smad3 overexpression in bcl - 3 - depleted lm2 cells ( figure 5h ) .
rescue experiments in vitro further confirm that bcl - 3 - depletion induced decreases of smad3 protein in breast cancer cells contribute to reduced migration and invasion ability in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo .
bcl - 3 stabilizes smad3 by forming a complex with smad3 phosphorylation at different sites of smad3 contributes to its stability.39 to determine if bcl - 3 stabilized the smad3 protein level via influencing smad3 phosphorylation , we measured the phosphorylation levels at several smad3 phosphorylation sites after tgfbeta stimulation in lm2 and mda - mb - 231 cells , including phosphor - smad2 / smad3 thr8 , phosphor - smad2 / smad3 thr179 , phosphor - smad3 ser204 , phosphor - smad3 ser208 , phosphor - smad3 ser213 and phosphor - smad3 ser423 / 425 .
the phosphorylation at ser204 , which is located in the linker region of smad3 , was significantly reduced in bcl - 3 - depleted lm2 cells ( supplementary figure 4a ) , but not in mda - mb - 231 ( supplementary figure 4b ) .
moreover , we transfected bcl - 3 - silenced mda - mb - 231 cells with wt smad3 , a smad3 mh2 domain phosphorylation mutant called dssvs , or a smad3 linker region phosphorylation mutant called smad3 epsm .
similar to wt smad3 , decreased levels of mutated smad3 proteins were detected in bcl - 3 - depleted cells upon tgfbeta treatment ( supplementary figure 4c ) .
taken together , these results indicate that the phosphorylation of smad3 is not required for its regulation by bcl - 3 in tgfbeta signaling , even though bcl - 3 affected the smad3 phosphorylation at ser204 in lm2 cells .
given that bcl - 3 was selectively needed to stabilize smad3 not smad2 , we hypothesized that bcl - 3 forms a complex with smad3 to prevent the degradation of smad3 .
first , we co - transfected expression vectors encoding bcl - 3 and smad3 into 293 t cells and immunoprecipitated the lysates with antibodies directed against either protein tag .
immunoblots revealed that bcl - 3 was present in smad3 immunoprecipitates and vice versa ( figures 6a and b ) .
further mapping revealed that an n - terminal deletion mutant of bcl - 3 ( den ) could not interact with smad3 ( figure 6d ) , while the c - terminal ( mh2 domain ) deletion ( dec ) mutant of smad3 could not bind with bcl - 3 ( figure 6e ) .
consistently , bcl - 3 did not interact with endogenous smad2 ( figure 6c ) .
these results demonstrate that bcl - 3 binds to the mh2 domain of smad3 to stabilize smad3 by disrupting the degradation of smad3 .
without tgfbeta treatment , smad3 was located in the cytoplasm , whereas bcl - 3 were predominantly detected in the nucleus .
under tgfbeta stimulation , smad3 trans - located into the nucleus where bcl - 3 co - localized with smad3 .
when bcl - 3 was knocked down , the levels of smad3 in the nucleus profoundly decreased after tgfbeta treatment .
an immunofluorescence analysis revealed that bcl - 3 interacted with smad3 in the nucleus , protecting smad3 from degradation ( supplementary figure 5 ) .
discussion tgfbeta signaling has a dual role in breast cancer tumorigenesis : 40 , 41 it inhibits tumor proliferation in the early stage , and promotes tumor metastasis via emt in the advanced stages of carcinogenesis .
our study showed that bcl - 3 regulated the process of breast cancer pulmonary metastasis without affecting tumor proliferation .
we found the elevated expression of bcl - 3 correlated with metastatic progression and metastasis - free survival in breast cancer patients .
moreover , bcl - 3 - deficient mmtv - pymt mice showed a significantly reduced number of pulmonary metastatic foci .
bcl - 3 knockdown dramatically reduced the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells .
bcl - 3 was recently shown to be able to promote the metastasis of erbb2 - positive mammary tumors,21 but little is known about the mechanism .
in our study , we found that bcl - 3 regulated breast cancer pulmonary metastasis in breast cancer cells by modulating tgfbeta signaling via the stabilization of smad3 and other metastasis - related proteins such as id1 ( see discussion below ) .
researchers have investigated the specific functions of smad2 and smad3 in tgfbeta - induced signaling in breast cancer cells in vitro and in a mouse model of breast cancer metastasis .
the knockdown of smad3 in mda - mb - 231 cells resulted in the prolonged latency and delayed growth of metastases , whereas smad2 knockdown resulted in a more aggressive phenotype compared with control cells.9 therefore , we demonstrated that bcl - 3 serves as a critical regulator in stabilizing smad3 , but not smad2 or smad4 , upon tgfbeta stimulation .
this function is crucial for the tgfbeta - dependent cell migration , invasion and pulmonary metastasis of breast cancer .
notably , smad3 overexpression only partially rescued the deficiency caused by bcl - 3 loss , suggesting that other mechanisms might be involved in the regulation of the pulmonary metastasis of breast cancer by bcl - 3 .
first , bcl - 3 might regulate emt independently of smad3 .
indeed , we found that bcl - 3 depletion in some breast cancer cell lines , such as mda - md - 231 and 4t1 cells , led to mesenchymal - to - epithelial transition ( met ) induction , there was as demonstrated by reduced f - actin polarity ( supplementary figure 4d ) and an obvious morph - change from fibroblast - like to round - like ( supplementary figure 4e ) .
second , bcl - 3 may regulate the stability of other metastasis - related proteins in addition to smad3 .
for example , we observed that the protein levels of id1 were regulated by bcl - 3 , especially upon tgfbeta treatment .
however , we did not detect the interaction of bcl - 3 with these proteins .
the mechanisms underlying the bcl - 3 regulation of metastasis need to be further investigated .
tgfbeta signaling is mainly determined by the expression level and activity of the effector proteins smad2 and smad3.39 after tgfbeta stimulation , smad3 can be recognized by the e3 ligase rbx1 at its mh2 domain and then degraded by the ubiquitin - proteasome pathway.14 smad3 is phosphorylated at ser208 by erk map kinase upon egf treatment , and erk phosphorylation inhibits smad3 activity because the mutation of the erk phosphorylation sites increases the ability of smad3 to stimulate a smad target gene.42 we found that the phosphorylation at ser204 , located in the link region of smad3 , was significantly reduced in bcl - 3 - depleted cells , which might be accounted for by our previous finding that bcl - 3 depletion reduced erk activation22 ( data not shown ) .
however , the smad3 linker region phosphorylation did not differ between mutant epsm and control cells after tgfbeta treatment .
these results indicate that the stabilization of smad3 by bcl - 3 does not depend on the phosphorylation of the smad3 linker domain .
importantly , bcl - 3 directly interacts with the mh2 domain of smad3 , which is consistent with reports that dear1 and akt bind to the mh2 domain of smad3 but do not interact with smad2.43 , 44 , 45 mh2 domain of smad3 is the binding site of e3 ligase or adapter such as dear1 that promote smad3 ubiquitination and degradation .
the binding of bcl - 3 with mh2 domain of smad3 but not smad2 , suggest that bcl - 3 stabilizes smad3 through competitively preventing the interaction of smad3 with its e3 ligase , probably other proteins such as dear1 .
therefore , we propose that bcl - 3 stabilizes smad3 , but not smad2 or smad4 , by disrupting the interaction of smad3 and its e3 ligase , preventing the degradation of smad3 by the ubiquitin - proteasome pathway .
however , the depletion of rbx1 or beta - trcp , the components of the e3 ubiquitin ligase complex which is responsible for the ubiquitination of tgfbeta - activated smad3 , could not lead to an accumulation of smad3 in mda - mb - 231 cells whether tgfbeta stimulation or not , maybe other e3 ubiquitin ligase participate in this process .
this process is not associated with the phosphorylation of smad3 , but depend on the binding affinity of bcl - 3 and smad3 .
in summary , our study uncovered a novel mechanism by which bcl - 3 stabilizes smad3 protein during tgfbeta signaling .
because tgfbeta signaling plays important roles in breast cancer pulmonary metastasis,46 our findings provide a promising new drug target for the prevention and therapy of breast cancer pulmonary metastases .

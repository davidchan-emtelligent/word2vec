background the green tea catechin epigallocatechin gallate ( egcg ) was shown to effectively inhibit tumor growth in various types of cancer including biliary tract cancer ( btc ) .
for most btc patients only palliative therapy is possible , leading to a median survival of about one year .
chemoresistance is a major problem that contributes to the high mortality rates of btc .
the aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic effect of egcg alone or in combination with cisplatin on eight btc cell lines and to investigate the cellular anti - cancer mechanisms of egcg .
methods the effect of egcg treatment alone or in combination with the standard chemotherapeutic cisplatin on cell viability was analyzed in eight btc cell lines .
additionally , we analyzed the effects of egcg on caspase activity , cell cycle distribution and gene expression in the btc cell line tfk - 1 .
results egcg significantly reduced cell viability in all eight btc cell lines ( p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 , respectively , for most cell lines and egcg concentrations > 5 mum ) .
combined egcg and cisplatin treatment showed a synergistic cytotoxic effect in five cell lines and an antagonistic effect in two cell lines .
furthermore , egcg reduced the mrna levels of various cell cycle - related genes , while increasing the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and the apoptosis - related death receptor 5 ( p < 0.05 ) .
this observation was accompanied by an increase in caspase activity and cells in the sub - g1 phase of the cell cycle , indicating induction of apoptosis .
egcg also induced a down - regulation of expression of stem cell - related genes and genes that are associated with an aggressive clinical character of the tumor , such as cd133 and abcg2 .
conclusions egcg shows various anti - cancer effects in btc cell lines and might therefore be a potential anticancer drug for future studies in btc .
additionally , egcg displays a synergistic cytotoxic effect with cisplatin in most tested btc cell lines .
graphical abstract summary illustration keywords egcg green tea biliary tract cancer drug synergism cisplatin cell cycle arrest issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background biliary tract cancer ( btc ) develops at different locations within the biliary tree system .
the prognosis for btc remains very poor with a five year survival rate of only 10 % [ 1 ] .
due to the silent clinical character of the malignancy , btc patients are often diagnosed at late stages and only few patients are candidates for surgical resection - the currently only curative treatment option .
palliative chemotherapeutic therapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine achieves an average survival of about one year [ 1 , 2 ] .
in general , high recurrence rates , the lack of suitable follow - up therapies and fast development of chemoresistance impede significant therapeutic success [ 3 ] .
therefore , new therapeutic approaches that inhibit btc tumorigenesis and that may also overcome or even reverse the chemoresistance of btc cells are needed .
green tea is a very popular beverage that had its origin in china several thousand years ago .
numerous studies prove that green tea consumption has cancer - preventive effects ( reviewed in [ 4 ]) .
green tea contains several catechins of which epigallocatechin gallate ( egcg ) is the most abundant that furthermore shows the strongest anti - cancer effects [ 5 , 6 ] .
previous studies demonstrated that egcg inhibited growth of cancer cells by causing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in various types of cancer , such as lung cancer [ 7 ] , prostate cancer [ 8 - 10 ] , head and neck squamous carcinoma [ 11 ] , hepatocellular carcinoma [ 12 ] as well as breast , colon , skin and bladder cancer [ 4 ] in vitro and in vivo .
there is also evidence that egcg has anti - cancer effects in btc : two studies demonstrated that egcg suppresses the growth and invasion potential of various human btc cell lines [ 13 , 14 ] .
lang et al. showed that treatment with egcg sensitized btc cells to apoptosis caused by chemotherapeutics gemcitabine , mitomycin c or 5 - fluorouracil .
additionally , egcg reduced btc tumor growth and increased sensitivity to gemcitabine in vivo .
they also demonstrated , that combined egcg and gemcitabine incubation was associated with a synergistic cytotoxic effect [ 15 ] .
this potential synergistic effect of egcg with other chemotherapeutic compounds was also seen for the combination with vorinostat , a histone deacatylase inhibitor , in human hucc - t1 cholangiocarcinoma cells [ 16 ] .
these studies make egcg not only an interesting substance for single , but also a potentially attractive adjuvant substance for combined therapy of btc in vitro and in vivo [ 5 ] .
based on these encouraging preliminary results and a paucity of data about a potential synergism of egcg and cisplatin in btc cells , we hypothesized that combined treatment of egcg with cisplatin shows a synergistic cytotoxic effect .
for this purpose , we used a comprehensive approach by testing combined egcg and cisplatin treatment in a panel of eight different btc cell lines .
since previous studies suggest that egcg exhibits diverse anti - cancer effects , we explored the egcg - caused changes in cell - cycle distribution , caspase activity and gene expression of selected cell cycle - and apoptosis - related genes as well as genes that are associated with an aggressive tumor character and potential cancer stem cell ( csc ) status .
methods substances and cell culture egcg was obtained from sigma aldrich ( vienna , austria ) and dissolved in h2o to a stock concentration of 10 mm and stored in aliquots at - 20 degreesc .
cisplatin was provided by the hospital 's pharmacy ( landesapotheke , salzburger landeskliniken ) as a stock solution of 3.33 mm and was stored at 4 degreesc .
resazurin was purchased from sigma aldrich and dissolved in dulbecco 's phosphate buffered saline ( dpbs , sigma aldrich ) .
overall five bile duct carcinoma cell lines ccsw - 1 ( g2 [ 17 ]) , bdc ( g4 [ 18 ]) , egi - 1 ( g3 , [ 19 ]) , skcha - 1 ( g3 , [ 20 ]) , tfk - 1 ( g2 , [ 21 ]) and three gallbladder cancer cell lines mzcha - 1 ( g1 [ 20 ]) , mzcha - 2 ( g2 [ 20 ]) and gbc ( g1 [ 22 ]) were cultured in high glucose dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ; gibco , life technologies ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) foetal bovine serum ( fbs ; gibco , life technologies ) as described before [ 23 , 24 ] and are together termed as btc cell lines [ 25 ] .
for seeding we used the following cell numbers per cm2 of the culture receptacle in 10 % fbs dmem : 3.95 * 104 ( bdc , mzcha - 2 ) , 4.74 * 104 ( ccsw - 1 , gbc ) , 5.53 * 104 ( skcha - 1 ) , 6.32 * 104 ( egi - 1 , tfk - 1 ) , and 7.11 * 104 ( mzcha - 1 ) .
for egcg , cisplatin and combined drug treatment we used serum - free dmem ( sfdmem ) to avoid possible interactions of the drugs with components of the serum .
drug cytotoxicity we investigated the cell line - and dose - dependent cytotoxic effect of egcg only and combined egcg cisplatin treatment on cells grown in 96 - well microplates .
quantification of cell viability was carried out using the resazurin assay and an infinite m200 microplate reader ( tecan , groedig , austria ) as described [ 24 , 26 ] .
cells were treated with a dilution series of egcg ( 0.2 - 400 mum ) in sfdmem for 72 h based on previously published concentration ranges [ 14 - 16 ] .
viability was related to untreated cells ( sfdmem only ) samples .
for combined egcg and cisplatin treatment , cells were incubated in sfdmem for 72 h with various concentrations of each drug alone ( egcg : 5 , 20 , 50 and 80 mum ; cisplatin : 10 , 20 , 40 and 80 mum ; data only shown for 20 mum egcg , 50 mum egcg and 40 mum cisplatin , respectively ) and two combinations ( 20 mum egcg + 40 mum cisplatin ; 50 mum egcg + 40 mum cisplatin ) .
for drug combination experiments , cells were simultaneously incubated with sfdmem containing either single or combined drugs .
viability was measured using the resazurin assay and an infinite m200 microplate reader ( tecan ) and viability was related to untreated cells ( sfdmem only ) samples .
to evaluate potential synergistic cytotoxic effects of combined egcg and cisplatin treatment , we calculated the combination index ( ci ) using the compusyn software ( www.combosyn.com ) .
as described by chou [ 27 ] , combinations that lead to a ci greater than 1.1 are termed as antagonistic , combinations that lead to a ci less than 0.9 are termed as synergistic and combinations that lead to a ci between 0.9 and 1.1 are termed as additive .
gene expression analysis tfk - 1 cells were treated with 50 mum egcg in sfdmem in 60 mm cell culture dishes for 24 h. total rna was isolated using the rneasy kit and qiashredder tubes ( qiagen ) .
cdna synthesis was done with the improm - ii ( tm ) reverse transcription system ( promega ) .
quantification of gene expression was performed by quantitative real time reverse transcription pcr ( qrt - pcr ) using the gotaq qpcr master mix ( promega ) and a viia7 real time pcr system ( applied biosystems , life technologies ) .
all samples were measured at least in biological triplicates .
melting curve analysis was performed for each sample and primer pair to verify specificity of pcr products .
samples were normalized to beta - actin and treated samples were normalized to untreated controls according to the deltadeltact method [ 28 ] .
down - regulated genes ( deltadeltact < 1 ) are represented as - ( 1 / fold change ) for a more clear visualization .
caspase tfk - 1 cells were seeded in 96 - well microplates and incubated with 50 mum egcg in sfdmem for 24 , 48 and 72 h , respectively .
apoptosis analysis was performed using the caspase - glo ( r ) 3 / 7 assay ( promega ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol with an infinite m200 microplate reader ( tecan ) .
for each time point , caspase activity was related to a corresponding untreated ( sfdmem only ) control .
microscopic pictures were taken with an inverted phase contrast microscope ( motic ae31 ) which was equipped with a ccd - 1300b digital camera ( allied vision technologies / vds vosskuhler , stadtroda , germany ) controlled by lucia imaging software ( laboratory imaging systems , prague , czech republic ) .
cell cycle analysis for cell cycle analysis , tfk - 1 cells were seeded in 30 mm cell culture dishes for 72 h in sfdmem medium containing 50 mum egcg .
after 72 h cells were harvested with 1x trypsin - edta ( 0.5 % ; gibco , life technologies ) and resuspended in 100 mul dbps .
cells were fixed by addition of 1 ml 75 % ice - cold etoh and incubated for 15 min on ice .
after centrifugation , cells were resuspended in 200 mul dbps containing 0.04 mg / ml propidium iodide ( sigma aldrich , fluka ) and 0.1 mg / ml rnase ( ribonuclease a from bovine pancreas , sigma aldrich ) and incubated for 30 min at 37 degreesc protected from light .
after addition of 500 mul dpbs , cell cycle analysis was carried out on a quanta sc flow cytometer ( beckman coulter , krefeld , germany ) .
for data analysis flowjo software was used ( ashland , oregon , usa ) [ 29 ] .
statistics all data points represent mean values of at least three biological replicates +/ - sem .
paired student 's t - test was used for calculation of significance between groups .
all calculations were performed using originpro 9.1 ( originlab , northampton , ma , usa ) .
statistical results were considered significant (*) or highly significant (**) at p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 , respectively .
results egcg reduces cell viability in eight btc cell lines treatment of eight btc cell lines with different concentrations of egcg ( range : 0.2 - 400 mum ) for 72 h significantly reduced the cell viability in all cell lines in a dose - and cell line - dependent manner ( fig. 1 ) .
interestingly , for all cell lines , except for gbc , cell viability noticeably declined for egcg concentrations between 12.5 and 25 mum ( for gbc between 50 and 100 mum ) .
treatment with the highest concentration of egcg ( 400 mum ) reduced the cell viability to almost 0 % for six cell lines ( ccsw - 1 , egi - 1 , gbc , mzcha - 1 , mzcha - 2 and tfk - 1 ) whereas for bdc and skcha - 1 , a certain percentage of cells ( approximately 30 % for bdc and 10 % for skcha - 1 , respectively ) survived ( fig. 1 ). fig. 1 cell line - and dose - dependent effect of egcg on cell viability of btc cell lines .

abbreviations : btc : biliary tract cancer , egcg : epigallocatechin gallate , h : hours synergistic effect of egcg and cisplatin treatment to assess a potential synergistic effect , we measured the cell viability for single and combined treatments and calculated the combination index ( ci ) .
combined egcg and cisplatin treatment caused an antagonistic effect in two cell lines ( ccsw - 1 and egi - 1 ) for both tested combinations .
for one cell line ( skcha - 1 ) the data points achieved by single treatments were not suitable for ci calculation .
the remaining five btc cell lines showed a clear synergistic effect ( bdc , gbc , mzcha - 2 , tfk - 1 ; ci range 0.38 to 0.66 ) or a moderate synergistic effect ( mzcha - 1 ; ci range 0.83 to 0.85 ) , respectively , for combined egcg and cisplatin treatment ( fig. 2 ) .
interestingly , the categorization ( synergistic versus antagonistic ) of the ci remained the same for both combinations ( 20 mum egcg and 40 mum cis ; 50 mum egcg and 40 mum cis ) for all cell lines with a synergistic and antagonistic ci , respectively. fig. 2 combined egcg and cisplatin treatment in btc cell lines .
potential synergistic cytotoxic effects of combined egcg and cisplatin treatment were evaluated in eight btc cell lines .
cell viability is represented relative to untreated control .
for skcha - 1 cells , values from single treatments were suitable for ci calculation .
single treatments , as well as drug combinations are indicated as "+" .
based on [ 27 ] , the ci was calculated : a ci less than 0.9 represents a synergistic , a ci greater than 1.1 an antagonistic and a ci between 0.9 and 1.1 an additive effect .
ci values are shown within the bars of the drug combinations .
abbreviations : btc : biliary tract cancer , ci : combination index , egcg : epigallocatechin gallate caspase activity previous studies showed that egcg causes apoptosis in cancer cells [ 30 ] .
treatment of tfk - 1 cells with 50 mum egcg caused a steady increase of caspase activity after 24 h and 48 h , respectively , whereas after 72 h caspase activity was reduced to its original value ( fig. 3a ) .
this suggests that egcg is able to slightly induce apoptosis in tfk - 1 cells. fig. 3 effect of egcg on caspase activity and cell cycle in tfk - 1 cells .

abbreviations : egcg : epigallocatechin gallate cell cycle distribution to confirm the increase in apoptosis we performed cell - cycle analysis of tfk - 1 cells .
egcg treatment increased the percentage of cells in sub - g1 ( from 8.4 % to 19.2 %) , again indicating apoptosis .
additionally , we observed a decrease of cells in g2 / m ( from 33.3 % to 19.4 %) .
the overall percentage of cells in g0 / g1 and s - phases remained unchanged ( fig. 3b ) .
gene expression in a last step we investigated the effect of egcg treatment on the expression of cell cycle - ( ccna2 , ccnb1 , ccnd1 , ccne1 , e2f1 ) and apoptosis - related genes ( dr5 , p21 ) , genes that play a role in a potential csc phenotype ( cd24 , cd133 ) and multidrug resistance ( abcg2 ) , as well as genes that are related to general enhanced aggressiveness of btc ( eed , ezh2 , suz12 ) : egcg reduced the expression of ccna2 , ccnb1 , ccnd1 and e2f1 , but not of ccne1 in tfk - 1 cells .
this was accompanied by an enhanced level of dr5 and p21 gene expressions .
in addition , we saw a reduction of mrna levels of cd24 and cd133 as well as of abcg2 and e2f .
interestingly , we also observed a decline of the expression of the three core components of the polycomb repressive complex 2 ( prc2 , a major epigenetic regulator ) eed , ezh2 and suz12 to different extent ( fig. 4 ). fig. 4 effect of egcg on gene expression in tfk - 1 cells .
tfk - 1 cells were treated with 50 mum egcg for 24 h. all samples were normalized to beta - actin and mrna levels are presented relative to untreated controls according to the deltadeltact method [ 28 ] .

furthermore we studied the effects of egcg on caspase activity , cell cycle and gene expression of genes related to different aspects of btc tumorigenesis in the established btc cell line tfk - 1 [ 21 ] .
incubation with egcg led to a significant reduction of cell viability in all eight btc cell lines .
the effect was concentration - dependent in most cell lines .
at the highest concentration of 400 mum , for six cell lines ( ccsw - 1 , egi - 1 , gbc , mzcha - 1 , mzcha - 2 and tfk - 1 ) almost no vital cells were measurable , whereas for bdc and skcha - 1 a certain amount of cells survived , indicating different responsiveness to egcg treatment .
these findings are in line with a study carried out by takada and colleagues , which showed that egcg inhibited cell growth in a dose - dependent manner in three btc cell lines ( tgbc - 2 , skcha - 1 and nozc - 1 ) [ 13 ] .
furthermore , lang et al. presented that egcg not only reduced in vivo growth of mzcha - 1 cells in a mouse model , but also that egcg had no cytotoxic effect on non - malignant human cholangiocytes [ 15 ] .
it is also known from previous studies that egcg exhibits synergistic effects with other anticancer compounds [ 8 , 31 - 34 ] .
as for btc , studies showed that egcg was able to increase toxicity of the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat [ 16 ] and the chemotherapeutics gemcitabine , mitomycin and 5 - fluorouracil [ 15 ] , respectively .
since , to our knowledge , no published data describe the combination of egcg and the standard chemotherapeutic cisplatin in btc cells , we asked the question if this combination acts synergistically .
to distinguish additive from real synergistic cytotoxic effects of combined egcg and cisplatin treatment we used the ci based on the study by chou [ 27 ] .
for five cell lines ( bdc , gbc , mzcha - 1 , mzcha - 2 and tfk - 1 ) we saw a synergistic effect , whereas for two cell lines ( ccsw - 1 and egi - 1 ) we obtained an antagonistic effect of combined egcg and cisplatin treatment ( for skcha - 1 the measured values for single treatments were not suitable for ci calculation ) .
these data indicate that the cytotoxic effect of egcg and cisplatin co - treatment is highly cell - line dependent and can lead to either synergistic or antagonistic effects .
similar results were also observed in non - small cell lung cancer cell lines where the efficacy of cisplatin was enhanced by egcg in one cell line , but antagonized in another cell line [ 31 ] .
one suggested mechanism that may lead to a synergistic effect of egcg and cisplatin co - treatment is that egcg sensitizes ( cisplatin - resistant ) cancer cells to cisplatin treatment [ 7 , 32 ] .
chemoresistant cells often over - express multidrug - resistance genes , such as abcg2 , an atp - binding cassette subfamily g2 member , that also might play a role in csc [ 35 ] .
lee et al. showed that in head and neck squamous carcinoma , egcg enhanced cisplatin efficacy by down - regulation of abcg2 [ 11 ] .
in line with these results , egcg reduced abcg2 mrna expression in tfk - 1 cells in the present study , which may explain the observed synergistic cytotoxic effect of combined egcg and cisplatin treatment .
the cytotoxic effect of egcg has in part been ascribed to cell cycle arrest [ 4 , 9 ] .
in our study , egcg caused down - regulation of cell cycle - promoting genes ccna2 , ccnb1 , ccnd1 and e2f1 , whereas the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and the apoptosis - related gene dr5 were up - regulated .
these effects on mrna expression were accompanied by a moderate increase of caspase activity , as well as an increase in sub - g1 population ( indicating apoptosis ) and a decrease in g2 / m ( indicating cell cycle arrest ) , respectively .
one potential underlying mechanism might be the down - regulation of ccnd1 in the early phases of the cell cycle , inhibiting e2f1 to attain its active form , which in turn prevents the activation of ccna2 , leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis .
another hypothesis could base on up - regulation of p21 which also inhibits ccna2 activation , again leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [ 36 ] .
interestingly , we did not recognize an increase of p53 mrna levels ( data not shown ) , which suggests that the potential p21 - mediated effect on the cell cycle may be independent of p53 or that the effect is executed by p21 rather than p53 as already shown in another study [ 9 ] .
egcg also slightly reduced mrna levels of the two stem cell - related genes cd24 and cd133 , known to be associated with enhanced aggressiveness , higher tumorigenic potential and stem cell status in btc [ 37 - 39 ] .
we also recognized that egcg down - regulated the three core components of the prc2 complex ( eed , ezh2 and suz12 ) , which is a major epigenetic regulator that performs trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 .
ezh2 is the enzymatically active molecule of this complex and was found to be over - expressed in btc specimen and connected to poor clinical features as recently reviewed [ 40 ] .
interestingly , egcg treatment had the strongest effect on ezh2 expression in the present study .
this goes in line with the results presented by choudhury and colleagues , who showed that egcg alone and in combination with the prc2 inhibitor 3 - deazaneplanocin a effectively reduced prc2 activity in skin cancer cells [ 41 ] .
conclusions egcg is a potent drug for treatment of btc in vitro .
egcg significantly reduced cell viability of all eight btc cell lines and for most cell lines a synergistic cytotoxic effect could be shown , when combined with the standard chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin .
additionally , egcg showed a profound effect on the cell cycle , which changes were confirmed indirectly by down - regulation of various cell cycle - dependent genes , enhanced caspase activity and cell cycle arrest .
furthermore , egcg might also have an effect on cancer stem cell properties .
all these results suggest that egcg may be a promising and versatile ( adjuvant ) drug for future in vivo experiments concerning btc .
several completed or currently active and recruiting clinical phase i or ii trials ( n > 20 ) include egcg as a chemopreventive or supportive drug in various tumor entities ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) .
therefore , future clinical studies need to fully evaluate the potential of the green tea constituent egcg as an adjuvant or chemopreventive drug for btc .

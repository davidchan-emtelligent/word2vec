background elevations in the biochemical markers of myocardial damage are frequently detected after percutaneous coronary revascularization , but their clinical significance is still uncertain .
methods ck , ck - mb , and ctn i were prospectively assessed in 100 patients who underwent elective pci during the period between jan 2012 and jan 2013 .
patients were subjected to history taking , routine laboratory investigations , electrocardiogram ( ecg ) , cardiac biomarkers assay , and echocardiography pre and post pci .
the primary end point was death , myocardial infarction or severe , recurrent ischemia at 90 days .
results overall , 30 patients ( 30 %) had elevated cardiac biomarkers after pci .
elevated cardiac biomarkers were associated with significantly higher risks of the primary end point ( mace ) in the early post intervention period ( 43.3 % vs. 12.9 % ; p < 0.001 ) and a significantly higher risk of 3 months follow up mace ( 66.7 % vs. 14.3 % ; p < 0.001 ) .
elevation of cardiac biomarkers is more likely in older patients ( p _ 0.034 ) , diabetics ( 96.7 % vs. 11.4 % ; p < 0.001 ) .
, those with history of old mi ( 76.7 % vs. 11.4 % ; p < 0.001 ) .
, and patients who had chf ( 30 % vs. 4.3 % ; p < 0.001 ) . while the gender , previous history of cvs , copd , and liver cirrhosis were non significant predictors of elevated cardiac biomarkers .
conclusions elevated cardiac biomarkers , often observed after elective pci in patients with ihd , is associated with worse early post intervention and 90 - day clinical outcomes .
this marker , therefore , is a useful prognostic indicator in such patients .

introduction the oriental river prawn , macrobrachium nipponense ( crustacea ; decapoda ; palaemonidae ) , is an important commercial prawn species , that is widely distributed in freshwater and low - salinity estuarine regions in china and other asian countries [ 1 ] - [ 7 ] with an aquaculture production of 205,010 tons annually for aquaculture only [ 8 ] .
as known , within many other macrobrachium species , the males grow faster and gain more weight at harvest time than females .
facing stiff market competition , macrobrachium producers require improvement in fish production and performance traits to obtain more profit .
thus , culture of all - male populations would be necessary for economic purpose .
therefore , the long - term goals of the m. nipponense aquaculture industry include making genetic improvements and gaining a better understanding of sex - differentiation in this species .
some cdna libraries and transcriptome - level datasets have been generated and serving as a basis for functional genomics approaches aimed at improving the aquaculture performance of this species [ 9 ] - [ 11 ] .
however , little information on sex - determination and sex - differentiation related genes in the androgenic gland of m. nipponense have been reported , therefore , the mechanism of sex - determination remains unclear .
the androgenic gland is found in most crustacean species , it produces hormones that play crucial roles in sexual differentiation to maleness , including the development of the testes and male sexual characteristics [ 12 ] .
androgenic gland hormone ( agh ) and its relative producers are recognized as important factors when the sex - differentiation and determination mechanisms are concerned , their functions have been widely studied in many crustaceans [ 13 ] - [ 15 ] .
in macrobrachium rosenbergii , the males undergoes sex reversal to the females after androgenic gland was ablated from males .
the all - male population was generated when the " reversal females " were mating with normal male m. rosenbergii [ 16 ] - [ 18 ] .
considering the fact that ablation or implantation of the androgenic gland at a certain stage of development can result in sex reversal to male or female [ 12 ] , [ 19 ] - [ 21 ] , the expression pattern of androgenic gland hormone genes in crustaceans have received much attention in recent years [ 22 ] - [ 27 ] .
previous studies have focused on morphology and anatomy on the m. nipponense androgenic gland [ 28 ] .
however , no information to date was reported on genetic underpinnings of the androgenic gland in m. nipponense .
more novel genes , potentially involved in the sex - determination mechanism , are necessary to be identified from the androgenic gland .
such basic information is essential to better understand the molecular mechanisms involving in sex - determination / differentiation , in turn , it will benefit monosex crustacean aquaculture production .
the transcriptome is the total set of transcripts , mrna , and non - coding rna , in one or a population of cells during a specific developmental stage or in response to a particular physiological condition using high - throughput technology [ 29 ] .
transcriptome analysis provides the foundation for gene structure and function research and determines when genes are expressed and how they are regulated .
the development of next - generation sequencing ( ngs ) technologies allows the acquisition of more sequence data per run at a substantially lower cost than in long - read technologies [ 30 ] .
compared with the microarray methods , ngs , developed by illumina / solexa , is able to generate over one billion bases of high - quality sequences per run at less than 1 % of the cost of capillary - based methods , and is expected to dominate future analysis of eukaryotic transcriptomes [ 31 ] - [ 34 ] .
transcriptome analysis is now being widely applied to elucidate genetic factors conferring economically significant traits and / or phenotypes and to manage genetic diversity in cultured crustacean species [ 9 ] - [ 11 ] , [ 35 ] - [ 38 ] .
to date , there are only 81,411 expressed sequence tags ( ests ) from m. nipponense in the public databases , but the classical androgenic gland genes are largely absent from these gene sets [ 11 ] .
in this study , we generate the first m. nipponense transcriptome using cdna prepared from mrna which was isolated from the androgenic gland .
the est sequences generated were assembled and annotated with putative functions where possible , and database mining was performed to identify sex - determination and differentiation related genes .
a variety of markers potentially useful for genomic population studies including simple sequence repeats ( ssrs ) located within coding regions and single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) detected amongst deep coverage sequence region reads are also reported .
results and discussion transcriptome analysis to the best of our knowledge , this is the first comprehensive study of the m. nipponense androgenic gland transcriptome sequenced by illumina / solexa .
in the present study , the transcriptome profile was used to study the sex - determination and differentiation genes in the androgenic gland using next - generation sequencing technologies .
interestingly , the results revealed that there were genes highly expressed in the androgenic gland , which may be potentially involved in the regulatory mechanism of sex - determination in the oriental river prawn .
the reads produced by the illumina hiseq2000 were used for clustering and de novo assembly .
the reads yielded a total of approximately 357.8 million 200 bp paired - end raw reads with a total size of 7,229,376,990 .
after eliminating adapter sequences and filtering out the low - quality reads ( the number of bases in each read was less than 25 bp ) before de novo assembly by the seqpreq program , illumina hiseq2000 sequencing yielded a total of 70,853,361 ( table s1 , table s2 ) high - quality transcriptome reads with a total size of 6,841,680,044 bp. m. nipponense is a non - model organism and has no reference genome sequence .
therefore , the raw data were assembled de novo using the trinity program resulting in 78,408 contigs , ranging from 351 to 23,217 bp ( table 1 ) .
most of the contigs ( 27.8 %) were 401 - 600 bp in length , followed by 601 - 800 bp ( 14.42 %) , and 1 - 400 bp in length ( 12.3 %) ( figure 1 ) .
these 78,408 isosequences yielded a total of 57,619 non - redundant transcripts with an average of 1,244.19 bp because of alternative splicing , thus , two or more isosequences may be matched to one transcript .
in prawn , the earliest cdna libraries were constructed in 2001 , based on hemocytes and hepatopancreas from litopenaeus vannamei and l. setiferus , in order to discovery immune genes and a total of approximately 2045 randomly selected clones were sequenced [ 39 ] .
three cdna libraries ( based on the material from the testes , ovaries , and milti - tissues ) were constructed in previous studies on m. nipponense by roche 454 gs flx sequencing [ 9 ] - [ 11 ] .
however , only limited numbers of genes were obtained from these three cdna libraries .
compared with those studies , a great number of genes were generated in the current study , taking advantage of illumina hiseq2000 ngs which can sequence in higher throughput and provide more candidate genes .
besides , the average length of each isosequence is much longer than the previous studies after clustering and de novo assembly in current study , which can promote further studies on these isosequences , including rt - pcr and western - blot .
the 57,619 non - redundant transcripts in this study provide a transcriptome database for future analyses of sex - determination and sex - differentiation related genes in androgenic gland tissue .
therefore , this transcriptome dataset accelerates the understanding toward the sex - determination mechanisms in m. nipponense , and other crustaceans .

number total genes 57619 total isogenes 78408 total residues 97554839 average length 1244.19 largest isogene 23217 smallest isogene 351 gene ontology assignments and cog analysis to identify their putative functions , all of the isosequences were compared with the non - redundant protein database and nucleotide sequences in ncbi using blastp and blastx at an e - value of < 10 - 5 in the priority order of the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) database and cluster of orthologous groups ( cog ) database .
a total of 70,702 non - redundant transcripts , which matched nr , were annotated , while the other unannotated transcripts represent novel genes whose functions have not yet been identified .
these unannotated transcripts may also play a vital role in the metabolism of m. nipponense ; however , further research is required .
a total of 5,365 out of 78,408 isosequences contain orfs , with an average protein length of 719.3 bp and a mean nucleotide length of 2,157.9 bp. this implies that these 5,465 isosequences , which might be translated into amino acids , play an essential role in m. nipponense metabolism .
additional function analysis of these isosequences conducted using the cog , go , and kegg pathway databases are necessary .
gene ontology ( go ) divides gene products into three categories ( molecular function , cellular component and biological process ) , aimed to provide a structured and controlled vocabulary for describing gene products .
go terms were assigned to 33,203 m. nipponense contigs based on blast matches to proteins with known functions , including 40,399 sequences assigned to the molecular function category , 102,835 to the cellular component category , and 133,527 to the biological process component ( table s3 ) .
the matched contigs were comprised of 62 functional groups ( figure 2 ) .
gene ontology ( go ) can provide a structured and controlled vocabulary for describing gene products in three categories : molecular function , cellular component , and biological process [ 40 ] .
analyses of the transcriptomes of other crustaceans have identified ests possessing similar arrays of potential metabolic functions [ 9 ] - [ 11 ] , [ 35 ] - [ 38 ] .
the total number of go terms in this study was much larger than that of unique sequences , because many contigs can be assigned to more than one go term .
in the molecular function category , the number of contigs in each go term ranged from 1 to 24,163 .
cell , cell part , and cellular process had most abundant contigs (> 20,000 ) .
however , there were also 9 functional groups in which the numbers of contigs were less than 10 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0076840.g002 figure 2 gene ontology classification of non - redundant transcripts. by alignment to go terms , 33203 isogenes were mainly divided into three categories with 62 functional groups : biological process ( 25 functional groups ) , cellular component ( 19 functional groups ) , and molecular function ( 18 functional groups ) .
the left y - axis indicates the percentage of a specific category of genes existed in the main category , whereas the right y - axis indicates the number of a specific category of genes existed in main category .
the additional analysis revealed that 13,817 isosequences matched known genes in the cog database .
based on their predicted functions , these unigenes were classified into 25 functional categories ( table s4 ) .
among these 25 functional categories , a cluster for general function prediction only represents the largest group with 4,162 unique sequences , followed by signal transduction mechanisms ( 2,258 ) , posttranslational modification , protein turnover , chaperones ( 1,947 ) , and transcription ( 1,785 ) .
clusters for cell motility , extracellular structures , and nuclear structure represent the smallest groups , in which the numbers of sequences were < 30 ( figure 3 ) .
similar to the data in the go category , the total number of cog sequences was > 13,817 because several sequences were involved in more than one functional category .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0076840.g003 figure 3 cluster of orthologous groups ( cog ) classification of putative proteins .
a total of 13817 putative proteins were classified functionally into 25 molecular families in the cog database .
the results obtained in this study showed that candidate novel genes with special functions can be easily identified according to the gene ontology assignment and cog analysis .
biological functions were mostly predicted to be involved in developmental process , growth and cell proliferation functional groups in " go assignments " and the general functional prediction only and signal transduction mechanisms functional categories in " cog analysis " , which are more likely to contain the sex - determination and differentiation related genes in m. nipponense .
the genes in these functional groups in current study were dramatically more abundant than those in previous studies in m. nipponense [ 9 ] - [ 11 ] , providing more candidate selections for further analysis of sex - determination and differentiation mechanism in m. nipponense .
kegg analysis kegg database can map the unique sequence into defined metabolic pathway .
kegg analysis was used to identify the potential candidate transcripts in biological pathways in the ladybird .
a total of 17,868 isosequences matched the metabolic pathways in the kegg pathway database , mapped onto 317 predicted metabolic pathways , and grouped into amino acid metabolism , genetic information processing , cellular processes , and environmental information processing ( table s5 ) .
the numbers of unique sequences mapped to various pathways ranged from 1 to 3,500 .
the main metabolic pathways of unique sequences in the m. nipponense transcriptome are metabolic pathways , biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , microbial metabolism in diverse environments , spliceosome , rna transport , protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum , and purine metabolism , in which the numbers of unique sequences were more than 400 .
identifying these pathways in the database was acceptable , considering the growth process habits of m. nipponense .
kegg analysis dramatically advances the researches on the relationship between different genes in the transcriptome of androgenic gland in depth .
some metabolic pathways , including spliceosome , and rna degradation may promote the analysis of sex - determination and differentiation mechanism , because many sex - determination and differentiation related genes were existed in these pathways , such as transformer - 2 , and the series of heat - shock protein family .
although not all of the major genes reported in the putative kegg pathways were found in the current study , this information provides insight into the specific responses and functions involved in the molecular processes of m. nipponense metabolism and sex - determination .
research on sex - related genes sex determination is a fundamental and very important biological process involved in the development of sexual characteristics in organisms , thereby leading to sex - specific traits manifested in behavior , physiology , and morphology .
male and female generally have different alleles or even different genes , responsible for the regulation of their sexual morphology [ 41 ] .
a total of 47 sex - related gene families were identified from the m nipponense androgenic gland transcriptome based on the functional annotation of non - redundant transcripts ( table 2 ) .
most of these functional genes were identified based on comparisons with published data for other species [ 9 ] - [ 11 ] , [ 42 ] - [ 44 ] , but some were identified according to their go classification .

recently , its homologs were found to be expressed in the ags of several decapod crustaceans .
the gene has been cloned and studied in several crustacean species , including callinectes sapidus , m. rosenbergii , macrobrachium nipponense , and penaeus monodon [ 22 ] - [ 27 ] .
iag was exclusively and abundantly expressed in the androgenic gland in m. nipponense based on rt - pcr analysis [ 24 ] .
further studies will focus on the precise function of this gene in m. nipponense and determine how this gene will affect male sex - determination in this species .
sxl and tra - 2 have been cloned from m. nipponense , based on the construction of a testis cdna library .
during embryogenesis , sxl and tra - 2 reached their highest levels at the nauplius stage .
during the larval stage , sxl and tra - 2 have similar expression patterns , in which the expression of both genes gradually increased from day 1 post hatching ( l1 ) to day 10 ( l10 ) and decreased to their lowest levels at the end of metamorphosis , suggesting that both sxl and tra - 2 are involved in m. nipponense sex - determination .
a reasonable explanation is that sxl may act with tra - 2 to play complex and important roles in embryogenesis , metamorphosis , somatic sexual development , and sex - differentiation [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] .
ftz - f1 is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] and it was originally considered to be involved in the regulation of the transcription of fushi tarazu ( ftz ) in drosophila [ 49 ] .
two isoforms , alpha - and beta - ftz - f1 , are transcribed from the same gene .
alpha - ftz - f1 expressed in the early - stage of embryo , containing ftz expression , whereas beta - ftz - f1 expressed in the late stage embryo when ftz is absent [ 50 ] - [ 51 ] .
its homologues , an essential factor in sex determination in mammals , have been identified in human , mouse and a number of teleost species [ 52 ] - [ 55 ] .
fem1 is a signal - transducing regulator in the c. elegans sex - determination pathway , played an essential role in sex determination in c. elegans [ 56 ] .
the homologues of fem1 , including fem1a , fem1b and fem1c , have been identified in human and house mouse .
the expression of a single fem1 transcript and protein showed no significant difference in both sexes , suggesting its activity was regulated by primarily posttranscriptional and posttranslational [ 56 ] .
the genes , introduced above , were also reported in previous study as important sex - determination genes [ 11 ] , indicating these genes are valuable sex - determination genes for further studies .
chromobox proteins , members of a conserved family , are thought to be located on the w chromosome in chicken [ 57 ] .
female heterogamy ( zw ) exists in both m. nipponense and p. monodon since this protein was also identified in the ovary cdna library of these species [ 9 ] - [ 10 ] , [ 58 ] ; it is involved in the packaging of chromosomal domains into representative heterochromatic states [ 59 ] .
it has been speculated that the sex of m. rosenbergii is determined by both heterogamous ( zw ) females and homogamous ( zz ) males [ 60 ] .
however , chromobox proteins existed in both the testis and the androgenic gland , implying female heterogamy is the main factor in m. nipponense sex - determination .
besides , several important sex - differentiation related genes were also identified in the current study .
many studies have shown that ubiquitin may be relevant to heat shock proteins [ 61 ] - [ 63 ] .
for instance , heat shock proteins ( hsp ) may help ubiquitin and target non - repairable proteins to the proteasome [ 64 ] .
in the present study , a total of 6 ubiquitin gene families and 8 hsp gene families were found in the transcriptome .
the ubiquitin - proteasome affects many biological processes , including cell degradation and protein homeostasis maintenance .
a series of ubiquitin - conjugating enzyme e2 ( e2 ) transcripts are essential for oogenesis and spermatogenesis , as its expression levels are significantly different at the various stages of testis and ovary development [ 65 ] .
ubc9 , which belongs to the family of ubiquitin - conjugating enzyme e2 , has been confirmed to have effects on m. nipponense embryogenesis and oogenesis [ 66 ] .
a series of e3 ubiquitin - protein ligase ( e3 ) transcripts are involved in the regulation of binding the target protein substrate and transferring ubiquitin from the e2 cysteine to a lysine residue on the target protein [ 67 ] .
ubiquitin carboxyl - terminal hydrolase l3 ( uch - l3 ) and ubiquitin carboxyl - terminal hydrolase l5 ( uch - l5 ) were also found in this transcriptome , functioning during the meiotic differentiation of spermatocytes into spermatids [ 68 ] .
uchl3 and uchl5 are widely expressed throughout the entire body , including the testis / ovary , neuronal cells , and in spermatocytes and spermatids .
hsps are a class of functionally related proteins found in all living organisms , including bacteria , plants , animals , and humans [ 69 ] .
their expression increases under stressful conditions , such as exposure to elevated temperature .
heat shock proteins have several different families classified according to their molecular weight [ 70 ] , [ 71 ] .
for example , hsp 90 prevents protein aggregation and increases hsp expression [ 72 ] .
hsp90 is involved in m. nipponense ovarian development , playing a regulatory role in ovary maturation [ 73 ] .
heat shock cognate 70 kda proteins are synthesized in haploid cells during spermatogenesis and are mainly activated at the spermatid stage [ 74 ] .
the ubiquitin and hsp genes in this study may work in combination , affecting the sex - determination process .
cathepsins , which are contained in many types of cells in all animals , tear apart other proteins .
in crustaceans , cathepsin a has functions in the innate immune system [ 75 ] .
cathepsin b was reported to control the developmental processes in insects and other arthropods .
cathepsin d is necessary for the formation of the yolk [ 76 ] .
cathepsin l regulates the development of the ovary in many species , including l. vannamei , m. nsis , and bombyx sp. cathepsin a , b , d , and l were found in this study , as the same as the m. nipponense testis cdna library , implying these four types of cathepsins may play an essential role in the male developmental process .
in particular , cathepsin a and d may be especially important because these two cathepsins were not found in the m. nipponense ovary cdna library .
cyclins are necessary for the progression of cells through the cell cycle by activating the cyclin - dependent kinase enzymes [ 77 ] .
in this study , a dozen transcripts , related to the cyclin family subtype were found .
these may play essential roles in the reproductive and developmental processes , they included cyclin a , b , d , and cyclin - dependent kinases ( cdks ) .
cyclin a and d are involved in many mechanisms , including egg maturation , meiosis , and the normal cell cycle [ 78 ] , [ 79 ] .
cyclin b is involved in mitosis ; it rises abruptly through the cell cycle until mitosis and then decreases significantly because of the degradation of cyclin b [ 80 ] .
cdks , present in all eukaryotes , are also involved in regulating transcription , mrna processing , and the differentiation of nerve cells and their regulatory function in the cell cycle and are considered to be evolutionarily conserved [ 81 ] .
novel genes from androgenic gland in this study , we compared the expression levels of genes in the m. nipponense androgenic gland with genes in the transcriptomes of other sex glands , including the vasa deferentia , ovaries and testes .
these transcriptomes were constructed by our lab and the literatures being written currently .
we divided the androgenic gland transcriptome genes into two main parts .
one comprises the genes specifically expressed in the androgenic gland ( 21,246 genes ) ( table s6 ) , and the other comprises the genes generally expressed in sex glands ( 35,400 genes ) ( table s7 ) .
a total of 40 candidate novel genes were found in the androgenic gland .
expression levels of these genes were significantly higher in the androgenic gland compared to the other sex glands , suggesting that they potentially play important roles in the sex - determination mechanism of m. nipponense .
in the group of genes specifically expressed in the androgenic gland , 24 were considered to be the candidate genes because their expression levels were > 1,000 ( table 3 ) .
in the generally expressed gene group , the iag expression pattern was used as reference because it plays an essential role in the androgenic gland .
a total of 16 genes were found to have similar expression patterns to iag ( table 4 ) .
interestingly , of the 40 candidate genes , 10 were uncharacterized proteins , the functions still remain unclear , but they may play essential roles in the androgenic gland because they are highly expressed there .
however , this has yet to be confirmed .

tropomyosin ( 4 genes ) and troponin ( 3 genes ) may have important effects on the androgenic gland ( table 3 , table 4 ) .
tropomyosin is highly expressed in the androgenic gland , implying it plays a vital role there .
tropomyosins control the function of actin filaments in both muscle and non - muscle cells .
they are often divided into muscle and non - muscle tropomyosin isoforms .
in the muscle sarcomere , muscle tropomyosin isoforms regulate interactions between actin and myosin , playing a pivotal role in regulated muscle contraction .
non - muscle tropomyosin isoforms function in all cells , controlling and regulating the cell 's cytoskeleton and other key cellular functions [ 82 ] .
troponin is a complex of three regulatory proteins ( troponin c , troponin i , and troponin t ) , which are integral to contraction in skeletal and cardiac muscles [ 83 ] .
troponin is attached to the protein tropomyosin and lies within the groove between actin filaments in the muscle tissue [ 83 ] .
the high expression levels of both tropomyosin and troponin families imply that genes from these families act together affecting the androgenic gland .
furthermore , many genes from these 40 candidate novel genes were involved in glucose metabolism , including beta - glucosidase 23 , glycogen debranching enzyme - like , and glutamine synthetase cytosolic isozyme 1 - 2 .
research on these potential candidate novel genes and analysis of the relationship between them and genes expressed in other tissues , including identifying the genes up - and downstream of sex - determination related genes , may significantly advance all - male aquaculture having positive economic effects .
identification of molecular markers in this study , a large number of ssr and snp markers were obtained ( table s8 , table s9 ) .
a total of 12,437 ssrs were obtained in the transcriptomic dataset , including 71.18 % tri - nucleotide , 25.96 % di - nucleotide , and 2.85 % tetra / penta / hexa - nucleotide repeats ( figure 4 ) .
among the tri - nucleotide repeat motifs , ( tct / ctt / ttc ) n with a total of 2,214 ssrs and a frequency of 17.80 % was the most common type , dramatically more than the other types of tri - nucleotide repeat motifs ( figure 4 ) .
there was a bias towards tri - nucleotide repeat motifs composed of c and t .
( ct / tc ) n , ( ga / ag ) n , and ( ta / at ) n were the three dominant di - nucleotide types .
compared with the three previously constructed m. nipponense cdna libraries , the volume in our study was a lot higher .
in addition , 968 out of 12,437 est - ssrs from the androgenic gland transcriptome were screened out .
the frequency of these est - ssrs was 11.4 % .
673 ssrs were dinucleotide repeats , accounting for 69.5 % of all ssr sequences , followed by 239 trinucleotide repeat ssrs and 26 tetranucleotide repeat ssrs .
the ssrs with 5 or more nucleotides accounted for 0.03 % .
one hundred thirty - five pairs of primers were synthesized randomly , and 72 pairs of these exhibited clear bands .
finally , 14 markers were polymorphic in the test population of 32 individuals .
the repeat motifs are listed in table 5 and the repetitions ranged from 5 to 26 .
the average allele number was 7 per locus , ranging from 4 to 13 .
the observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.4125 to 0.8938 and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.6786 to 0.9332 .
the pic value ranged from 0.613 to 0.899 .
four loci ( e - wxm9 , e - wxm10 , e - wxm11 , and e - wxm62 ) showed significant departure from hwe in the test population ( p < 0.05 ) ( table 5 ) .
these 14 est - ssr markers may to some extent improve further studies , including those on the construction of linkage groups .
we intend to isolate more ssr markers from this transcriptome in the future .

snps were identified from alignments of multiple sequences used for contig assembly. by excluding those that had a mutation frequency of bases less than 1 % , a total of 65,535 snps were obtained , of these 33,167 were putative transitions ( ts ) and 32,367 were putative transversions ( tv ) , giving a mean ts : tv ratio of 1.02:1 across the m. nipponense androgenic gland transcriptome ( figure 5 ) .
the ag / ga , ct / tc , and cg / gc snps were the most common .
in contrast , ca / ac , at / ta , and tg / gt types were the fewest snp types because of the differences in the base structure and the number of hydrogen bonds between different bases .
compared with the three existing m. nipponense cdna libraries , the volume of snps in our study was also a lot higher .
the transcriptomes , sequenced by roche 454 gs flx , generally have missing snps [ 11 ] , [ 37 ] , mainly because of the experimental methodology .
however , there are no missing snps in this study , suggesting illumina / solexa sequencing is an ideal method for future transcriptome construction .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0076840.g005 figure 5 distribution of putative single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snp ) in the transcriptome of m. nipponense .
ssrs , or microsatellites , are polymorphic loci present in genomic dna , consisting of repeated core sequences of 2 - 6 base pairs in length [ 84 ] .
snps ( single - nucleotide polymorphisms ) are the most common type of variation in the genome .
snps provide the best genome coverage for analyzing the performance and production of traits .
genome with high - density snp coverage is a powerful tool for whole genome association studies because it allows for the detection of linkage disequilibrium [ 85 ] .
thus , based on the advantages of ssrs and snps , the development of such markers for this species was desirable .
it is envisaged that the potential markers identified here within the ests will provide an invaluable resource for studying the evolution and molecular ecology of m. nipponense , for genome mapping , and quantitative trait loci ( qtl ) analysis .
however , many of the putative m. nipponense snps identified could simply represent allelic variants and future studies are planned to validate which ones are real .
conclusion this is the first report on the transcriptome of the m. nipponense androgenic gland by de novo assembly using the illumina hiseq2000 .
the 57,619 non - redundant transcripts identified and assembled will facilitate gene discovery in m. nipponense .
a total of 47 sex - determination and sex - differentiation process related gene families were identified .
many candidate novel genes , potentially involved in the sex - determination mechanism , were identified in the androgenic gland for the first time and are worthy of further investigation .
in addition , a large number of snps and ssrs were predicted and can be used for subsequent marker development , genetic linkage , and qtl analysis .
such findings generated by pyrosequencing in m. nipponense provide a new resource for future investigations in this economically important species , especially in understanding the sex - determination and differentiation mechanism of m. nipponense .
materials and methods ethics statement the prawns were obtained from the tai lake in wuxi , china .
we got the permission from the tai lake fishery management council. m. nipponense is not an endangered or protected species in china , which can be used for experimental materials .
all the experimental animal programs involved in this study were approved by committee of freshwater fisheries research institute , and followed the experimental basic principles .
androgenic gland from each prawn was sheared under ms222 anesthesia , and all efforts were made to minimize suffering .
prawn and tissue preparation a total of 100 healthy adult male m. nipponense with a wet weight ranging from 4.9 to 6.2 g ( average = 5.5 g ) , and a total length ranging from 6.1 cm to 7.2 cm ( average = 6.8 cm ) , were obtained from tai lake in wuxi , china ( 120degrees13'44 '' e , 31degrees28'22 '' n ) .
these specimens were transferred to a 500 l tank and maintained in aerated freshwater at room temperature ( 26degreesc ) for 72 h prior to tissue collection .
the androgenic gland from 100 individuals was collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until used for rna extraction for transcriptome sequencing , in order to prevent total rna degradation .
rna isolation for rna - seq the androgenic gland tissues from the 100 individuals were pooled to provide sufficient rna for transcriptome sequencing .
the androgenic glands were extracted under an olympus szx16 microscope .
total rna was extracted by using the unlq - 10 column trizol total rna isolation kit ( sangon ) following the manufacturer 's protocol .
the od260 / 280 and od260 / 230 should range from 1.8 to 2.0 and > 2.0 , respectively , to ensure the purity of the rna sample .
to guarantee the transcriptome quality , the total volume of the rna sample was > 5 microg .
rna integrity was confirmed using a 2100 bioanalyzer ( agilent technologies , inc. ) with a minimum rna integrity number ( rin ) value of 7.0 .
the samples for transcriptome analysis were prepared using a truseq ( tm ) rna sample prep kit ( illumina ) according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
briefly , mrna was isolated from > 5 microg of total rna using oligo ( dt ) magnetic beads .
mrna was cut into short fragments by adding fragmentation buffer .
first - strand cdna was synthesized using random hexamer - primers , taking these short fragments as templates .
rnaseh , buffer , dntps , and dna polymerase i was used to synthesize second - strand cdna .
short fragments were purified with takara 's pcr extraction kit ( takara bio , inc. ) .
sequencing adapters were ligated to short fragments and resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis .
proper fragments were selected and purified and subsequently pcr amplified to create the final cdna library template .
analysis of the transcriptome results the transcriptome was sequenced using the illumina hiseq ( tm ) 2000 .
four fluorescently labeled nucleotides and a specialized polymerase were used to determine the clusters base by base in parallel .
the size of the library was approximately 200 bp and both ends of the library were sequenced .
the 200 bp raw paired - end reads were generated on the illumina sequencing platform .
image deconvolution and quality value calculations were performed using illumina ga pipeline v1.6 .
the raw reads were cleaned by removing adaptor sequences , empty reads , and low quality sequences ( reads with unknown sequences ' n ' or less than 25 bp ) .
the clean reads were assembled into non - redundant transcripts using the trinity , which has been developed specifically for the de novo assembly of transcriptomes using short reads .
to obtain non - redundant transcripts , we removed short sequences ( 100 bp in length ) and partially overlapping sequences .
the resulting sequences were used for blast searches and annotation against the nr protein , the swissprot , the cog , and the kegg databases using an e - value cut - off of 10 - 5 .
functional annotation by go terms ( www.geneontology.org ) was analyzed by the blast2go software .
the cog and kegg pathway annotations were performed using blastall software against the cog and kegg databases .
expression analysis the abundance of each tag was normalized to one transcript per million , in order to allow comparison between various sex glands , including the androgenic gland , vasa deferentia , ovaries and testes .
the raw reads were cleaned by removing low quality sequences including ambiguous nucleotides and adaptor sequences .
the calculation of unigene expression was conducted by using rsem software [ 86 ] - [ 87 ]. rsem is an accurate and user - friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances from rna - seq data .
it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies because it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome [ 86 ] .
molecular marker detection all ests from the m. nipponense androgenic gland transcriptome with a total number of 17,060 were converted into fasta format , and screened for the presence of ssrs using ssrhunter software ( http :// www.bio - soft.net ) .
the primers were designed using primer 5.0 software ( http :// www.bbioo.com / download / 58 - 166 - 1.html ) .
thirty - two wild oriental river prawn individuals were collected as a test population from taihu lake in china .
genomic dna was extracted from the muscle of these individuals using traditional proteinase - k digestion and phenol - chloroform extraction protocols [ 88 ] .
pcr amplification was carried out in a 25 microl reaction volume , containing 1xpcr buffer ( tiangen , beijing , china ) , 30 - 50 ng genomic dna , 0.25 microm for each primer , 150 micromol / l dntps , 1.5 mm mgcl2 , and 0.5 u taq dna polymerase ( tiangen , beijing , china ) .
the pcr reaction conditions were as follows : the dna was first denatured at 94degreesc for 3 min ; followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94degreesc for 30 s , annealing at 50 - 58degreesc for 30 s , and elongation at 72degreesc for 40 s ; with a final elongation at 72degreesc for 10 min .
pcr products were size - fractionated on 6 % polyacrylamide gels by silver staining .
the pbr322 dna / bsuri ( hae iii ) marker ( fermentas , shenzhen , china ) was used to determine the allele sizes .
popgen32 software was used to analyze allele frequencies , ho , and he for each locus and statistical significance of hwe [ 89 ] .
pic was estimated using the formula of botstein et al .
[ 90 ] .

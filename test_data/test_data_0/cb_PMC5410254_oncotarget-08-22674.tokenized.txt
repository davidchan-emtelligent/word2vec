colorectal cancer ( crc ) is one of the most common cancers worldwide , and micrornas play important roles in crc progression .
this study aimed to investigate the roles of mir - 146a - 5p in human crc and their molecular mechanisms .
first , we found that mir - 146a - 5p was significantly upregulated in crc tissues and promoted the migration of crc cells .
then , we identified carboxypeptidase m ( cpm ) as a direct target of mir - 146a - 5p , and found that it inhibited the migration and invasion of crc cells .
our results also showed that cpm expression was positively correlated with overall survival and negatively correlated with recurrence , lymph node invasion , and n stage .
furthermore , we demonstrated that both mir - 146a - 5p and cpm regulated src and fak expression , while the src - fak signaling pathway is widely known to be associated with the migration and invasion of multiple tumor cells .
this study is the first to demonstrate the functional and mechanistic relationship of the mir - 146a - 5p / cpm / src - fak axis and its effect on the migration and invasion of crc cells .
thus , mir - 146a - 5p represents potential targets for crc diagnosis and therapy .
mir - 146a - 5p carboxypeptidase m colorectal cancer migration invasion introduction colorectal cancer ( crc ) is a major cause of cancer related deaths [ 1 ] , and the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide [ 2 ] .
despite recent advances in treatment , the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer ( crc ) remains substandard .
metastatic recurrence following curative surgery is the leading cause of mortality .
therefore , it is imperative to identify prognostic markers to predict the clinical outcome of crc patients [ 3 ] .
micrornas ( mirnas ) are a family of endogenous , small , noncoding rna molecules mediating a wide range of biological processes , including differentiation , proliferation , and apoptosis [ 4 ] .
mirnas can function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes , depending on the type of tumor or the cellular context [ 5 ] , and their deregulation is frequent in human colorectal cancers ( crcs ) and their deregulation is linked to cancer progression and clinical outcome [ 6 , 7 ] .
in this study , we found that mir - 146a - 5p was highly expressed in crc , promoted cell migration and invasion of crc cells .
then we further explored its molecular mechanisms and identified cpm ( carboxypeptidase m ) as a direct target of mir - 146a - 5p .
our results also showed that both mir - 146a - 5p and cpm could regulate the expression of src and fak .
thus , we hypothesize that mir - 146a - 5p downregulates the expression of cpm and activates the src - fak pathway to facilitate crc cell migration and invasion .
to our knowledge , this study is the first to demonstrate the functional and mechanistic relationship of the mir - 146a - 5p / cpm / src - fak axis and its effect on the migration and invasion of crc cells .
results mir - 146a - 5p was upregulated in crc and promoted crc migration to determine the candidate mirna biomarkers in crc , we performed an integrative analysis of mirna expression profiling comparing crc tissues with paired adjacent tissues using the tcga and ucsc cancer databases .
we found that mir - 146a - 5p expression was significantly upregulated in crc relative to that in adjacent tissues ( p = 0.035 ) ( figure 1a ) .
we tested mir - 146a - 5p expression in five crc cell lines ( ht29 , hct116 , rko , sw480 , and lono ) and one normal colon epithelial cell line ( fhc ) using rt - pcr .
mir - 146a - 5p was upregulated in all crc cell lines but not in fhc cells ( figure 1a ) .
mir - 146a - 5p expression was upregulated ( p = 0.001 ) in crc tissues relative to that in adjacent tissues in 55 % of the 20 patients ( figure 1a ) .
figure 1 mir - 146a - 5p was upregulated in crc and promoted crc migration ( a ) the relative expression of mir - 146a - 5p in adjacent tissues and tumor tissues in the tcga database .
mir - 146a - 5p expression was detected in five crc cell lines ( ht29 , sw480 , lovo , rko , and hct116 ) and an immobilized colonic epithelial cell line ( fhc ) ( rt - pcr ) .
the log2re ( relative expression ) of mir - 146a - 5p was detected in 20 pairs of specimens from crc patients ( rt - pcr ) .

the statistical results of the scratch wound cell migration assay and transwell migration assay .
we overexpressed mir - 146a - 5p in fhc cells ( oe ) given its low expression in fhc and knocked it out in ht29 ( kd ) and lovo cells ( kd ) given its relatively high expression in ht29 and lovo cells .
we found that the migration of mir - 146a - 5p - overexpressing fhc cells was enhanced compared with that in the control group ( nc ) ( figure 1b ) ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas the opposite phenomenon occurred in mir - 146a - 5p - knockdown ht29 and lovo cells ( figure 1b ) ( p < 0.05 ) moderate changes were noted in the colony forming abilities of fhc mir - 146a - 5p oe , ht29 mir - 146a - 5p kd and lovo mir - 146a - 5p kd cells relative to the colony - forming abilities observed in their respective control groups ( supplementary figure 1b ) .
cpm was the target gene of mir - 146a - 5p we selected cpm , cdc42bpa , klf6 , and chd9 as the candidate targets of mir - 146a - 5p .
qrt - pcr results in cell lines showed that cpm regulated by mir - 146a - 5p was the most significant in these four genes after the expression of mir - 146a - 5p was altered ( supplementary file ) .
therefore , our following experiments focus on cpm as a target for mir - 146a .
western blot results further indicated that the overexpression of mir - 146a - 5p reduced cpm , and the inhibition of mir - 146a - 5p promoted the expression of cpm in ht29 and lovo cells ( figure 2a ) .
according to the bioinformatics analyses , we revealed that in cpm 3 ' untranslated region ( utr ) there were two binding sites for mir - 146a - 5p ( cpm 3'utr 2458 and cpm 3'utr 769 ) .
the luciferase reporter assay results suggested that mir - 146a - 5p binds to cpm 3'utr 2458 in lovo cells ( figure 2b ) .
statistical results are presented in table 1 .

cpm was downregulated in crc and inhibited crc migration and invasion according to the data obtained from tcga , oncomine and ucsc database , we found that the expression of cpm was significantly reduced and decreased expression of cpm was associated with worse prognosis ( figure 3a , 3b ) .
meanwhile , we tested 20 pairs of crc patient specimens using qrt - pcr and found that the cpm expression was significantly lower in tumor tissues than in the adjacent tissues in 95 % of the specimens , in consistence to the results of bioinformatics analyses ( figure 3c ) .
the expression of cpm and mir - 146a - 5p was negatively correlated in most paired crc specimens ( figure 3d ) .

the ihc results from 70 crc patients also showed that cpm was obviously reduced in tumor tissues .
in contrast , cpm accumulated at the cell membrane of normal colonic gland tissues ( figure 4a , 4b ) .
decreased expression of cpm was also associated with lymphatic invasion ( p < 0.001 )( ( figure 4c ) and worse prognosis ( p = 0.004 , threshold = 33,946.58 ) ( figure 4d ) , while a relative increase in the expression of cpm was associated with a lower recurrence rate ( figure 4e ) .
moreover , the cpm expression level in the 70 crc patient samples correlated with n stage ( p < 0.001 ) , , number of positive lymph nodes ( p = 0.014 ) , pathological grade ( p = 0.033 ) , tumor differentiation ( p = 0.027 ) and ajcc stage ( p < 0.001 ) but was not related to age , gender , pathologic type , anatomic neoplasm subdivision , venous invasion , t stage , m stage , serum cea , ca19 - 9 , ca125 and tumor size ( supplementary table 1 ) .

we next overexpressed cpm in lovo and ht29 cells and found that the migration and invasion cells were significantly inhibited ( p < 0.05 ) .
then , we knocked down cpm in ht29 and lovo cells and found that the migration and invasion abilities were upregulated ( figure 5 ) .

mir - 146a - 5p modulated cpm - src - fak signaling as previously reported , cpm was likely responsible for the initial metabolism of egf , while fak and c - src ( also known as src ) have been shown to form a transient , active complex following integrin engagement by egf receptors [ 8 ] .
therefore , in this research , we hypothesized that the conversion of egf by cpm affected its combination with egfr and further affect the egfr / src / fak signaling pathway in crc .
in this study , we focus on the impact of mir - 146a and cpm on the src / fak axis .
effect of cpm on the egf / egfr axis will serve as the focus of our future research .
we overexpressed cpm in lovo and ht29 cells and found that the expressions of src and fak were significantly inhibited ( p < 0.050 ) .
then , we knocked out cpm in ht29 and lovo cells and found that src and fak expressions were enhanced compared with those in the controls ( p < 0.050 ) ( figure 6 ) .
furthermore , the expressions of src and fak ( ptk2 ) were positively correlated with the n and m stage of crc in the ucsc database ( p < 0.050 ) ( supplement figure 2a ) .
in addition , the expression of cpm in the ucsc database exhibited a negative correlation with src ( spearman correlation coefficient - 0.296 , p = 0.019 ) , while the negative correlation between the expression of cpm and fak was not significant ( spearman correlation coefficient - 0.235 , p = 0.066 ) ( supplementary figure 2b ) .
no significant correlation was noted between the expression of mir - 146a and src ( spearman correlation coefficient 0.497 , p = 0.050 )/ fak ( ptk2 ) ( spearman correlation coefficient 0.129 , p = 0.63 ) in the ucsc database .

discussion the results of our study showed that mir - 146a - 5p was upregulated and promoted cell migration , invasion in human crc .
hwang wl , jiang jk , yang sh et al. reported that mir - 146a knockdown in sphere - derived cancer stem cells ( sdcscs ) reduced their sphere - forming ability , clonogenicity and anchorage - independent growth without affecting cellular proliferation and viability .
kuipers et al. reported that mir - 146a repression attenuated tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo [ 9 ] , which was consistent with our findings .
we used bioinformatics and luciferase assays to demonstrate that cpm was the direct target gene of has - mir - 146a .
cpm is a membrane - bound , zinc - dependent protease that cleaves c - terminal basic residues , such as arginine or lysine , from peptides / proteins [ 10 ] .
anguraj sadanandam showed that cpm is highly expressed in colorectal enterocytes [ 11 ] .
given its wide distribution in human tissues , cpm is believed to play important roles in the control of peptide hormone and growth factor activity at the cell surface and in the membrane - localized degradation of extracellular proteins [ 12 ] .
in recent years , cpm has emerged as a potential cancer biomarker [ 16 ] .
in this study , we found that cpm expression was lower in crc tissues than that in adjacent tissues .
cpm expression in crc specimens was also positively correlated with overall survival and negatively correlated with recurrence , n stage and lymph node invasion .
cpm , both in its membrane - bound and soluble forms , was likely responsible for the initial metabolism of egf and the appearance of des - arg53 - egf in interstitial and biological fluids [ 13 ] .
the significance of the conversion of egf to des - arg53 - egf in biological fluids or on target cells was not clear and it could either exhibit additional activities or be further degraded [ 14 ] .
activation of erbb2 ( this gene encodes a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family ) and downstream signaling pathways can lead to increased src protein synthesis and decreased src protein degradation resulting in src up - regulation and activation , which play critical roles in erbb2 - mediated breast cancer invasion and metastasis [ 15 ] .
more commonly found in colon cancer is elevated expression of wild - type ( wt ) c - src ( also known as src ) .
indeed , elevated protein levels and / or catalytic activity of c - src have been detected in a number of human cancers , including lung , skin , colon , breast , ovarian , endometrial , and head and neck malignancies [ 16 ] .
c - src also interacts with focal adhesion kinase ( fak ) that is postulated to play a key role in cancer metastasis by modulating the formation and turnover of focal adhesions [ 17 ] .
exploitation of fak activity in human tumors occurs through elevated expression , a situation that correlates with increased cancer cell motility , invasiveness , and proliferation [ 18 ] .
fak and c - src have been shown to form a transient , active complex following integrin engagement by egf receptors [ 8 ] .
in our study , we found that inhibition of mir - 146a - 5p and the overexpression of cpm led to the downregulated src and fak expression , whereas the overexpression of mir - 146a - 5p and the inhibition of cpm upregulated src and fak .
ucsc data indicate that the expression of scr and fak ( ptk2 ) is positively correlated with n and m stage in crc , whereas the expression of cpm is negatively correlated with src .
we hypothesized that mir - 146a - 5p - cpm regulates the src - fak pathway and affects crc migration .
src is frequently deregulated in human colorectal cancer ( crc ) , and src increased activity has been associated with poor clinical outcomes [ 19 , 20 ] .
normal src overexpression can induce high invasiveness of advanced cancer cells in vitro , which is consistent with the proposed role for src in crc metastasis [ 21 ] .
hong ji and david w reported that src ( v - src ) was expressed in exosomes in crc .
in particular , the study demonstrated higher v - src levels in exosomes from a metastatic cell lines ( sw620 ) versus non - metastatic cell lines ( sw480 ) [ 22 , 23 ] .
src - fak is part of a complex network of intracellular signals that are important in regulating cancer cells [ 24 ] .
wu jc and chen yc reported that the src _ sh2 domain was regulated by fak , and the fak - dependent association of the src _ sh2 domain was necessary and sufficient for src fa targeting [ 25 , 26 ] , and inhibition of src targeting into fas significantly reduced cell migration [ 27 ] .
fak is a widely expressed cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase involved in integrin - mediated signal transduction .
fak plays an important role in the control of several biological processes , including cell spread , migration , and survival [ 28 ] .
in crc samples , fak was overexpressed , and positive fak expression correlated with lymph node metastasis and cellular differentiation [ 17 ] .
increased dosage of the fak gene was also observed in many cell lines derived from human tumors of the lung , breast and colon [ 18 ] .
in summary , our study showed that mir - 146a - 5p was upregulated in crc and promoted migration and invasion in vitro .
moreover , cpm was identified as a direct target of mir - 146a - 5p .
cpm , which was downregulated in crc , also exhibited the potential to inhibit the migration and invasion , and affected the prognosis of crc .
our results showed that cpm and mir - 146a could regulate the expression of src and fak .
thus , we hypothesize that mir - 146a promotes the migration and invasion of crc by inhibiting cpm , thereby inducing src and fak upregulation .

then , the target gene of mir - 146a - 5p was locked using a combination of targetscan and at least two of the other five algorithms ( miranda , mirdb , mirwalk , rna22 , and sum ) compiled with at least three of the six algorithms ( miranda , mirdb , mirwalk ) , the spearman correlation coefficient between the log2fc of these candidate targets and the log2fc of mir - 146a - 5p was calculated according to the data fromucsc cancer database .

cathelicidins encompass a family of cationic peptides characterized by antimicrobial activity and other functions , such as the ability to enhance the sensing of nucleic acids by the innate immune system .
the present study aimed to investigate the ability of the bovine cathelicidins indolicidin , bactenecin ( bac ) 1 , bac5 , bovine myeloid antimicrobial peptide ( bmap ) - 27 , bmap - 28 , and bmap - 34 to inhibit the growth of bacteria and to enhance the sensing of nucleic acid by the host 's immune system .
bmap - 27 was the most effective at killing staphylococcus aureus , streptococcus uberis , and escherichia coli , and this was dependent on its amphipathic structure and cationic charge .
although most cathelicidins possessed dna complexing activity , only the alpha - helical bmap cathelicidins and the cysteine - rich disulfide - bridged bac1 were able to enhance the sensing of nucleic acids by primary epithelial cells .
we also compared these responses with those mediated by neutrophils .
activation of neutrophils with phorbol myristate acetate resulted in degranulation and release of cathelicidins as well as bactericidal activity in the supernatants .
however , only supernatants from unstimulated neutrophils were able to promote nucleic acid sensing in epithelial cells .
collectively , the present data support a role for certain bovine cathelicidins in helping the innate immune system to sense nucleic acids .
the latter effect is observed at concentrations clearly below those required for direct antimicrobial functions .
these findings are relevant in development of future strategies to promote protection at mucosal surfaces against pathogen invasion .
cattle mx1 bacterial infection nucleic acid sensing type i ifn cathelicidin antimicrobial cationic peptides epithelial cells introduction antibiotics are widely used to treat infections in animals and to enhance growth and production .
however , the spread of antibiotic resistance and the generation of multiresistant bacterial strains has become a worldwide problem , associated with the release of antibiotics in the environment ( 1 ) .
for these reasons , alternatives to antibiotics in controlling infectious disease are urgently required .
one possible approach could be the stimulation of innate immune defense elements during critical phases of breeding .
cathelicidins comprise of a heterogeneous class of host defense peptides ( hdp ) also termed as antimicrobial peptides .
neutrophils and epithelial cells mostly express these peptides in inactive forms that share an n - terminal signal sequence , a cathelin - like domain , and a highly diverse structural c - terminal part ( 2 ) .
the inactive pro - peptides are temporally stored within the specific granules of neutrophils .
upon activation , the c - terminal part of the molecule is cleaved from the cathelin - like domain by proteinases or elastases ( 3 , 4 ) .
interestingly , cattle possess all classes of cathelicidins recognized in higher vertebrates , whereas in humans only ll - 37 was described .
a total of seven cathelicidin peptides were detected in granules of bovine granulocytes including the cysteine - rich bactenecin ( bac ) 1 , also known as dodecapeptide ( 5 ) , the proline - rich peptides bac5 and bac7 ( 6 ) , the tryptophan - rich indolicidin ( 7 ) , and the alpha - helical bovine myeloid antimicrobial peptides ( bmap ) - 27 , bmap - 28 ( 8 ) , and bmap - 34 ( 9 , 10 ) .
although four putative cathelicidin pseudogenes were observed , no cdna expression was detected ( 11 ) .
henceforth , the seven protein - coding cathelicidin genes were annotated as cathl1 ( bac1 ) , cathl2 ( bac5 ) , cathl3 ( bac7 ) , cathl4 ( indolicidin ) , cathl5 ( bmap - 28 ) , cathl6 ( bmap - 27 ) , and cathl7 ( bmap - 34 ) ( 12 ) .
in situ hybridization associated bac5 to neutrophil infiltration under inflammatory conditions in pulmonary tissues , whereas its expression was absent in healthy lungs ( 13 ) .
expression of cathls has been detected in a wide range of tissues including lungs , small and large intestines , mammary glands , and lymphoid tissues of cows ( 12 ) .
in addition , cathelicidins were found in milk from udders treated with lps ( 14 , 15 ) or following bacteria - induced mastitis ( 16 - 18 ) , suggesting important roles of cathelicidins in fighting against invading pathogens .
in addition to their antimicrobial functions , we have recently shown that a prominent feature of porcine cathelicidins is their strong ability to enhance the sensing of nucleic acids by the innate immune system ( 19 ) .
consequently , the potential protective role of bovine cathelicidins was investigated in this study .
the aim was to evaluate their antimicrobial activity in relation to their ability to enhance nucleic acid - induced innate immune responses .
considering the importance of mastitis in dairy farming , three major mastitis pathogens , staphylococcus aureus , streptococcus uberis , and escherichia coli were selected for our investigations .

results conformation - dependent activity of bmap - 27 on bacterial membrane integrity a combination of chemical factors including hydrophobicity , net charge , and the ability of hdp to form particular secondary structures functionally determines the antimicrobial activity of peptides .
leaving the net charge of + 10 intact , we designed a scrambled version of bmap - 27 ( sbmap - 27 ) to evaluate the impact of structure on biological activity .
the amphipathic conformation characteristic of alpha - helical cathelicidins was made visible in a helical wheel projection ( figure 1a ) , as well as in a three - dimensional model of the original bmap - 27 ( figure 1b ) .
this contrasted with sbmap - 27 , which was predicted to form a beta - sheet structure ( figure 1c ) .

arrows indicate a left side 90degrees rotation .
as expected , sbmap - 27 had reduced antimicrobial activity when compared to bmap - 27 .
this was found with s. aureus , s. uberis , and e. coli and was in the range of a 4 - to 10 - fold reduction ( figure 2 ) .
these data suggest that the structural conformation of bmap - 27 mostly confers bactericidal function , although the role of the cationic charge cannot be excluded .
due to their amphipathic characteristics , cationic hdp typically affect the potential of bacterial membranes , which can be evaluated by flow cytometry using carbocyanine dyes ( 29 ) .
this test demonstrated that compared to sbmap - 27 , bmap - 27 strongly affected membrane integrity of s. aureus ( figure 3a ) .
cathelicidin - induced changes of membrane potential were also observed with s. uberis and e. coli , but the impact of secondary structure was less evident ( figure 3b ) .
in order to evaluate if bmap - 27 kills bacterial cells through the formation of pores ( 30 ) , cell - impermeable nucleic acid stains were employed .
for both gram - positive bacteria , the frequency of pi - positive cells was always higher in the presence of bmap - 27 compared to its scrambled version ( figure 3c ; figure s1b in supplementary material ) .
similarly , e. coli treated with bmap - 27 showed a higher frequency of 7 - aad positive cells in comparison to sbmap - 27 - treated e. coli ( figure 3d ) .
altogether , these data indicate that the bactericidal property of bmap - 27 is at least in part dependent on the amphipathic conformation , presumably impacting membrane integrity by forming pores into both gram - negative and gram - positive bacteria .
figure 2 bactericidal properties of bovine myeloid antimicrobial peptide ( bmap ) - 27 and sbmap - 27 against mastitis isolates .
( a - c ) bmap - 27 was mixed with staphylococcus aureus m3842 ( a ) , streptococcus uberis m100 / 11 ( b ) , and escherichia coli 9217 / 10 ( c ) to reach a final bacterial concentration of 5 x 104 cfu / ml and incubated at 37degreesc for 1 h. as control , bacteria were incubated in the absence of cathelicidin .
each sample was then diluted 10 - fold in pbs and 50 microl of suspension plated on petri dishes .
colonies were counted and reported as cfu / ml .
( d - f ) similar to bmap - 27 , different dilutions of sbmap - 27 were mixed with s. aureus m3842 ( d ) , s. uberis m100 / 11 ( e ) , and e. coli 9217 / 10 ( f ) , incubated at 37degreesc for 1 h , plated and colonies enumerated .
significant differences compared to the controls were determined by dunnett 's multiple comparison test (* p < 0.05 ) .

plots of one representative experiment out of two are shown with frequency representing 7 - aad positive cells .
doublets and bacterial cell debris based on the different fsc and ssc parameters were excluded in all experiments .
comparative analysis of antimicrobial activity of bovine cathelicidins against mastitis pathogens to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of bovine cathelicidins ( 5 - 10 ) , six synthetic peptides including the alpha - helical bmap - 27 , - 28 , and - 34 , the scrambled sbmap - 27 , the tryptophan - rich indolicidin , the cysteine - rich disulfide - bridged peptide bac1 , and a proline - rich peptide bac5 , were employed to assess mic against seven mastitis isolates ( table 1 ) .
cathelicidins belonging to the alpha - helical peptide class were the most efficient in inhibiting bacterial growth .
surprisingly , indolicidin , bac1 ( dodecapeptide ) , and bac5 had a low capacity to prevent the growth of all strains of s. aureus and e. coli at relevant in vivo concentrations (< 20 microm ) .
as reported above , 2 - to 4 - fold higher concentration of sbmap - 27 was required to reach mic compared to bmap - 27 , confirming the importance of the alpha - helical conformation to sustain optimal antimicrobial function .

interaction of bovine cathelicidins with plasmid dna previous studies demonstrated that many cationic hdp including cathelicidins ( 19 , 31 - 33 ) and beta - defensins ( 34 ) could interact with negatively charged nucleic acids .
consequently , we determined the ability of bovine hdp to influence nucleic acid migration in agarose gels .
migration patterns were strongly altered at 10 microm of bmap - 27 , sbamp - 27 , bmap - 28 , bmap - 34 , and bac5 ( figure 4 ) .
these observations were confirmed by quantifying the signal of the lower band on the gels ( figure s2 in supplementary material ) .
figure 4 bovine cathelicidins interact with nucleic acids influencing plasmid migration .
different dilutions of cathelicidins were incubated with 100 ng of dna plasmid in nuclease - free water for 10 min , then loaded on a 0.8 % agarose gel .
nucleic acids were visualized with ethidium bromide .
ability of bovine cathelicidins to promote nucleic acid sensing by the innate immune system both human and porcine cathelicidins have been described as forming complexes with free nucleic acids , favoring uptake by plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pdc ) , and leading to potent type i interferon ( ifn ) responses ( 19 , 31 ) .
considering that bovine pdc are very rare in peripheral blood ( 35 ) , and that cathelicidins will also be secreted at mucosal surfaces , we employed a primary epithelial cell ( bt cells ) model and determined mx1 induction as a readout for type i interferon responses ( 26 ) .
first , the titration of poly ( i : c ) promoting mx1 expression was performed to evaluate the threshold at which these cells sensed poly ( i : c ) .
the induction of mx1 was not detectable below a concentration of 156 ng / ml of poly ( i : c ) ( figure s3 in supplementary material ) .
consequently , 0.1 microg / ml was used to evaluate the ability of cathelicidins to promote nucleic acid sensing .
our results demonstrate that the addition of bmap - 27 , sbamp - 27 , bmap - 28 , and bmap - 34 to poly ( i : c ) enabled the detection of mx1 , whereas this response was very weak or not observed with indolicidin , bac1 , or bac5 ( figure 5a ) .
furthermore , a cathelicidin dose - dependent induction of mx1 was shown with bmap - 27 , sbamp - 27 , bmap - 28 , bmap - 34 as well as with the disulfide - bridged peptide bac1 ( figure 5b ) .
these data demonstrate that bovine alpha - helical and cysteine - rich disulfide - bridged cathelicidins can promote nucleic acid sensing at low peptide concentrations .
figure 5 bovine myeloid antimicrobial peptide ( bmap ) - 27 , sbamp - 27 , bmap - 28 , bmap - 34 , and bac1 promote nucleic acid sensing in primary epithelial cells .
( a ) bovine cathelicidins ( 5 microm ) were complexed with 0.1 microg / ml poly ( i : c ) in medium at room temperature for 10 min before being added to bovine turbinate epithelial cells ( bt cells ) .
after 20 h incubation , mx1 and beta - actin were detected by western blot .
one experiment out of three representative experiments is shown .
( b ) cathelicidin dose - dependent induction of mx1 in presence of poly ( i : c ) .
increasing concentrations of bovine cathelicidins were mixed with 0.1 microg / ml of poly ( i : c ) in medium for 10 min and added to bt cells .
after 20 h of culture , mx1 and beta - actin were detected by western blot .
one representative experiment out of two is shown .
activated neutrophils release cathelicidins but cannot induce mx1 in response to poly ( i : c ) in order to clarify the importance and relevance of neutrophil - derived cathelicidins in mediating these responses , bovine blood neutrophils were used as a source of cathelicidins .
to induce neutrophil activation , we employed pma stimulation .
the observed reduction in side scatter determined by flow cytometry , as well as the morphological changes observed by bright field microscopy ( figure 6a ) indicated neutrophil degranulation following pma stimulation .
activation was also confirmed by the quantification of ros by flow cytometry ( figure 6b ) .
although some variations were noticed between animals , the fluorescence intensity of cm - h2dcfda ( ros indicator ) of pma - stimulated neutrophils was significantly higher compared to unstimulated neutrophils ( figure 6c ) .
as expected , the activation of pma - treated neutrophils was also characterized by the release of cathelicidins detected by western blot ( figures 6d,e ) .
to evaluate antimicrobial function , neutrophil supernatants were tested for their ability to reduce the growth of e. coli and s. aureus .
no significant effects were found with supernatants of unstimulated neutrophils when compared to medium with both e. coli and s. aureus .
however , 3.7 - fold e. coli and a 4 - fold s. aureus cfu reduction was observed with supernatants from pma - stimulated neutrophils compared to medium ( figures 7a,b ) .
finally , we investigated the ability of neutrophil supernatants to promote nucleic acid sensing .
surprisingly , supernatants from unstimulated neutrophils incubated with poly ( i : c ) promoted mx1 expression , whereas pma - activated neutrophil supernatants elicited poor mx1 expression in response to poly ( i : c ) .
in the absence of poly ( i : c ) , no induction could be reported ( figure 7c ) .
figure 6 cathelicidins can be detected in the supernatants of phorbol myristate acetate ( pma ) - activated neutrophils .
a total of 5 x 107 neutrophils were stimulated with 100 ng / ml of pma for 10 min , washed , and cultured for 1 h followed by analysis of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) and cathelicidins .

undiluted and twofold diluted neutrophil supernatants were employed for western blots using a rabbit anti - bovine cathelin antibody ( 10 microg / ml ) .
cow # 1 and cow # 3 are shown on the left and right side , respectively .

figure 7 antimicrobial and mx1 - inducing activity of neutrophil - derived supernatants .
( a,b ) antimicrobial activity against both gram - negative and gram - positive bacteria was observed with supernatants of phorbol myristate acetate - treated neutrophils .
supernatants were mixed with approximately 5 x 103 cfu of escherichia coli 9217 / 10 ( a ) and staphylococcus aureus m3842 ( b ) , and incubated at 37degreesc for 1 h. as control , bacteria were incubated in fbs - free medium .
each sample was then diluted 10 - fold in pbs , and 50 microl of suspensions were plated on petri dishes to determine the cfu / ml. each symbol represents at least a triplicate from one animal , and the line shows the average of all animals .
significant differences compared to the medium alone were calculated using dunnett 's multiple comparison test (* p < 0.05 ) .
( c ) enhancement of nucleic acid sensing in bovine turbinate epithelial cells ( bt cells ) by neutrophil supernatants .
supernatants were incubated with or without 0.1 microg / ml poly ( i : c ) for 10 min before being transferred to bt cells .
after 20 h , mx1 and beta - actin expression were determined by western blot .
one representative experiment out of four is shown .
discussion this study was initiated to characterize bovine cathelicidins with respect to their capacity to mediate antibacterial and immunostimulatory responses at mucosal surfaces .
stimulating such activity has the potential to enhance resistance of cattle to infection .
considering the importance of mastitis for dairy cow health and that bovine cathelicidin gene expression has been reported in mammary tissue ( 12 ) , we selected three major bacterial bovine mastitis pathogens for our investigations .
we found that bmap - 27 strongly affects bacterial membrane integrity and probably forms pores in both gram - positive and gram - negative mastitis pathogens .
it was previously shown that the 18 n - terminal residues of bmap - 27 were highly effective at inhibiting growth of many bacterial strains ( 36 ) .
similar to ll - 37 ( 37 ) , the pore - forming capacity and antimicrobial mechanism of bmap - 27 was related to the amphipathic alpha - helical structure leading to membrane disruption ( 37 ) .
like all cationic hdp , the mechanism is initiated by the electrostatic interactions of the hdp and negatively charged residues of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane .
in the case of alpha - helical cathelicidins , this step is followed by toroidal pore formation resulting in bacterial cell death ( 38 ) .
these findings contrast with the mode of action of other classes of cathelicidins such as tryptophan - rich peptide , indolicidin , or proline - rich peptide , bac7 , which inhibit bacterial dna synthesis ( 39 , 40 ) or rna translation in e. coli ( 41 ) , respectively .
surprisingly , sbmap - 27 still demonstrated antimicrobial function despite a complete loss of the amphipathic conformation , suggesting that the net charge of hdp contributes partly to the bactericidal effects .
recently , bmap - 27 , bmap - 28 , bac5 , and indolicidin were reported to share broad - spectrum antibacterial activity against several mastitis pathogens ( 42 ) .
the mic values obtained with the present study were slightly higher compared to previous reports with the same species ( 5 - 10 ) .
this might be attributed to differences in the protocol employed , such as the preparation of the bacterial inoculum or the presence of different salt concentration , which can strongly impact peptide function .
although many reports have aimed to define and characterize the antimicrobial activity of cathelicidins against various pathogens , very little is known regarding the immunomodulatory effects elicited by these peptides .
tomasinsig et al. demonstrated that both bmap - 27 and bmap - 28 promoted the release of tnf in a bovine mammary cell line ( 42 ) .
in the present study , it is shown that the sensing of double - stranded rna analog was improved when bovine cathelicidins were added to nucleic acids prior to exposure to epithelial cells .
as a readout , we employed the induction of mx1 , which is dependent on the induction of type i ifn ( 43 ) .
in both human and porcine models , it was proposed that pdc play a pivotal role in sensing of nucleic acids complexed to cathelicidin followed by the release of large quantities type i ifns ( 19 , 31 ) .
here , we demonstrate that type i ifn can also be induced in epithelial cells .
this could be immunologically relevant considering the role of these cells as a first defense against infection .
interestingly , the induction of mx1 was also observed with the cysteine - rich bac1 ( dodecapeptide ) .
similarly , type i ifn was detected when beta - defensins or protegrin were employed in the presence of nucleic acids in both human and porcine pdc ( 19 , 34 ) , respectively .
cysteine - rich cathelicidins , which structurally resemble defensins , may display conserved modulatory functions such as the ability to complex microbial dna or rna and promote the recognition by innate immunity .
cathelicidin - complexed nucleic acids could trigger cytoplasmic rna or dna receptors , or alternatively endosomal toll - like receptors .
further research is required to determine in which compartment the nucleic acid is delivered .
type i ifns not only mediate antiviral protection but also have a potent impact on adaptive immune responses by promoting both cellular immunity and antibody responses ( 44 ) .
nevertheless , it is still controversial if type i ifns have a beneficial or negative effect on bacterial disease outcome , and this appears to be pathogen dependent .
for example , in vivo studies in mice indicate that s. aureus - triggered type i ifns can be detrimental ( 45 ) .
on the other hand , type i ifn signaling is required to control disease and increase survival rate after other pathogenic bacterial infections , including group a streptococci ( 46 ) , group b streptococci , pneumococci , e. coli ( 47 ) , and streptococcus pyogenes ( 48 ) .
in cattle , a single study reported that s. uberis could upregulate the transcription of ifn - omega ( 49 ) .
however , the link between ifn induction and protective immunity during bovine mastitis and bacterial infections in general has never been evaluated .
the induction of mx1 was only detected with non - activated neutrophils , while the opposite was found with respect to the antimicrobial activity , requiring stimulation with pma .
a possible explanation is that the nucleic acid complexing activity requires lower doses , which are already released from neutrophils following their isolation and culture .
in contrast , pma induces a very strong neutrophil degranulation , releasing a multitude of components , some of which might have inhibitory activity on the process of mx1 induction .
we also know from our previous work that high concentrations of cathelicidins have inhibitory activity on ifn type i responses , presumably through cytotoxic effects ( 19 ) .
alternatively , hdp have been reported to possess regulatory activity .
brook et al. demonstrated that the alpha - defensins secreted by neutrophils can inhibit tnf - alpha mrna translation in macrophages ( 50 ) .
this observation is in accordance with the fact that many cathelicidins can neutralize endotoxins ( 51 , 52 ) , limiting an excessive inflammation .
it thus appears that the composition and concentration of hdp present in the microenvironment can determine the type of immune response .
in conclusion , the present data provide a comprehensive overview of the antimicrobial functions of some bovine cathelicidins against mastitis pathogens , demonstrating cathelicidin - and bacteria - specific differences .
we show that some of these peptides participate in the sensing of nucleic acids mediating ifn type i responses in epithelial cells .
this work will help to identify ways of exploiting the biological effects of cathelicidins , to identify alternatives for antibiotics as has been proposed by others ( 53 ) .
in the case of bovine mastitis , it would be interesting to evaluate the exact contribution of these peptides during the course of the disease .
the observations that hdp are a highly abundant in mastitis milk ( 16 , 18 ) and also that the process of netosis involving cathelicidins was found during mastitis ( 54 ) would support the maintenance of hdp 's biological activities in the udder .
furthermore , their exploitation for other mucosal surfaces such as the respiratory tract is attractive .

they also have high alcohol use , which is associated with sexual risk behaviors and detectable hiv - rna levels ; both of which increase the risk of hiv transmission .
objectives we hypothesized that minority msm would be associated with sexual risk behaviors , and , among hiv - infected men , detectable hivrna .
methods we used data from the veterans aging cohort study , an observational cohort study of hiv + and matched uninfected patients .
msm status and race / ethnicity were based on self - report .
we performed descriptive and multivariable logistic regression analyses to determine the association between msm / race ( minority msm , white msm , minority non - msm and white non - msm ) and sexual risk behaviors ( multiple sex partners , sex under the influence of drugs / alcohol and non - condom use ) .
all analyses were adjusted for demographics and medical characteristics .
results among the 6,175 male participants , 51 % were hiv + , 27 % were msm ( 18 % minorities ) , and 36 % were hazardous drinkers or diagnosed with alcohol abuse / dependence .
minority msm were more likely to have multiple sex partners , and be under the influence of alcohol / drugs during sex , compared to all other groups .
they were also more likely to have hazardous drinking and alcohol abuse / dependence .
moreover , hiv + minority msm were more likely to have higher median hiv rna .
in adjusted logistic regressions , minority msm , compared to white non - msm , were more likely to have multiple sex partners ( aor = 6.3 [ 4.4 , 9.0 ]) , be under the influence of alcohol / drugs during sex ( aor = 2.1 [ 1.4 , 3.0 ]) and report non - condom use ( aor = 1.1 [ 0.8 , 1.4 ]) .
among hiv + , minority msm were more likely to have a detectable viral load ( hivrna >= 500 copies / ml ) ( aor = 1.5 [ 1.0 , 2.3 ]) .
conclusion these analyses suggest that a minority msm with alcohol abuse / dependence would be 11.5 [ 6.4 , 20.4 ] more likely to have multiple sexual partners and 19.6 [ 10.4 , 37.0 ] more likely to have sex under the influence , making minority msm an extreme risk group .
our data support the need for tailored prevention efforts targeting these behaviors among minority msm .

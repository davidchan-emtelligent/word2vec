keywords 20 - hydroxyecdysone il - 1beta hypoxia normoxia cartilage destruction hif - 2alpha issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background osteoarthritis ( oa ) is a primarily degenerative disease of the joints ; it is an enormous and expensive public health problem .
the incidence of oa increases with age , but a variety of potential factors ( such as : hereditary , developmental , metabolic , and mechanical factors ) may initiate processes leading to loss of cartilage [ 1 ] .
the high prevalence , together with the high degree of disability , makes this disease a substantial burden for societies [ 2 ] .
there are no effective medical therapies to prevent cartilage destruction and the associated bony changes in the osteoarthritic joint .
chondrocytes hypertrophy does occur in osteoarthritic cartilage .
the articular chondrocytes hypertrophy partially reflexed that the degrading and remodeling of the extracellular matrix promote pathologic cartilage calcification .
an imbalance between anabolic and catabolic factors within chondrocytes may cause osteoarthritic cartilage destruction [ 3 - 5 ] .
the hypoxia - inducible factor - 2alpha ( hif - 2alpha , encoded by epas1 ) is a catabolic transcription factor in the osteoarthritic process .
hif - 2alpha directly induces chondrocytes expression of genes encoding catabolic factors , such as matrix metalloproteinases ( mmp1 , mmp3 , mmp9 , mmp12 and mmp13 ) , aggrecanase - 1 ( adamts4 ) , nitric oxide synthase - 2 ( nos - 2 ) and prostaglandin - endoperoxide synthase - 2 [ 3,4 ] .
according to this paradigm , a stress - induced increase in the activity of hif - 2alpha will overshadow the beneficial effects of the closely related hif - 1alpha , then push the chondrocytes in the joint toward a more differentiated state known as hypertrophy , which then drives osteoarthritis changes [ 6,7 ] .
ecdysteroids ( ecs ) are steroids found in invertebrates and plants [ 8,9 ] .
the possible active ingredient best known and investigated is 20 - hydroxy - ecdysone ( beta - ecdysone = ecd ) [ 10 ] .
in mammals , ecd has protein anabolic effects and increases muscle mass of unexercised and exercised muscle [ 11,12 ] .
in ovariectomized rats , pure ecd supplementation significantly increased in the thickness of joint cartilage and presented beneficial effects in bones .
this result provides evidence that pure ecd may be of value in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis [ 13 - 15 ] .
the ecd is frequently used by body builders and from these users it is known that ecd has no known adverse effects even when taken up in gram (~ 1 g ) quantities [ 16 ] .
the selective , rationally designed biologic drugs that slow joint destruction must be in clinical use earlier before that can happen .
such modality should be used to the onset of chondrocytes hypertrophy and catabolism and before loss of cartilage progresses to the point where it is clinically beyond a ' point of no return ' .
the purpose of this study is to validate the effects of ecd on il - 1beta - induced cartilage destruction and also the possible role of ecd in treatment or prevention of early oa. methods chemicals and reagents 20 - hydroxyecdysone ( edc ) was obtained from enzo life sciences ; new york , usa .

during the experiment , the treatment ( including medium and medication ) was changed every 3 days and fresh ecd was added at each media change .
the level of mitochondrial activity of the bone cells after ecd treatments were determined by colorimetric assay , which detects the conversion of mtt to insoluble formazan .

mmp3 and mmp13 are probably not key catabolic factors under hypoxic condition .
discussion osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative disorder that mostly affects the articular cartilage .
joint pain , stiffness , impaired mobility and reduced quality of life is the commonest presentation of this disease in elderly people [ 18 ] .
osteoarthritic cartilage destruction is initiated by the imbalance of anabolic and catabolic factors in cartilage [ 19 ] .
these factors include pro - inflammatory cytokines that have key roles in the catabolic reactions of arthritic cartilage [ 20 ] .
pro - inflammatory cytokines are capable of inducing hif - 2alpha ; hif - 2alpha then causes cartilage destruction by regulating crucial catabolic genes , such as matrix metalloproteinases ( mmp1 , mmp3 , mmp9 , mmp12 and mmp13 ) , aggrecanase - 1 ( adamts4 ) , nitric oxide synthase - 2 ( nos2 ) and prostaglandin - endoperoxide synthase - 2 ( ptgs - 2 ) through the expression and activity of epas1 in chondrocytes [ 4 ] .
pure ecdysteroids ( ecs ) supplementation significantly increased in the thickness of joint cartilage and also presented an overview of beneficial effects in bones and may be of value in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis [ 13 - 15 ] .
in this study , we validate that ecd inhibit il - 1beta - induced cartilage catabolism via hif - 2alpha pathway .
cartilage tissue is characterized by its high content of aggrecans , which exists in association with hyaluronic acid and links proteins to form proteoglycan aggregates .
in osteoarthritis ( oa ) , the loss of proteoglycans , the mineralization of the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) and the hypertrophic differentiation of the chondrocytes constitute hallmarks of this disease [ 21 ] .
the balance between ecm synthesis and degradation is often associated with a dedifferentiation of chondrocyte and / or an enhanced apoptosis [ 22 ] .
during oa , aggrecans are among the first matrix constituents to be affected , as they are progressively depleted from cartilage in parallel with the severity of the disease [ 23 ] .
chondrocytes try to compensate for the loss of proteoglycans by increasing their production .
at a certain stage in the development of oa , however , chondrocytes are unable to fully compensate for proteoglycan loss , resulting in a net loss of matrix .
the increased loss of aggrecans fragments is mostly due to the action of both mmps and aggrecanases [ 24 ] .
il - 1beta is a potent pro - inflammatory cytokine that is capable of inducing chondrocytes and synovial cells to synthesize mmps [ 14 ] .
in this study , we demonstrated that inflammatory cytokine ( interleukin - 1beta : il - 1beta ) does enhance the epas1 gene expression and down - regulated collagen type ii ( col2a1 ) gene expression in chondrocytes culture ( figure 1 ) ; while the pre - treatment of ecd can scavenge the catabolic effects of il - 1beta on chondrocytes ( figure 2 ) .
in the early phases of oa , mmp - 13 is predominantly expressed in the lower intermediate and deep layers of human and mouse cartilage , whereas aggrecanases are expressed in the superficial cartilage [ 25,26 ] .
the degradation of aggrecan by aggrecanases has gained special interest , because it constitutes an early event in osteoarthritic cartilage damage and is followed by the irreversible loss of collagens [ 27 ] .
aggrecanases belong to the adamts ( a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs ) family of metalloproteinases .
during oa , adamts - 4 ( aggrecanase 1 ) [ 28 ] and adamts - 5 ( aggrecanase 2 ) [ 29,30 ] have been implicated prominently in cartilage breakdown .
in spite of a large variability of expression levels among different patients , mmp - 3 appeared to be strongly expressed in normal and early degenerative cartilage and down - regulated in the late disease stages .
in the late stages of cartilage degeneration , mmp - 2 and mmp - 13 , which were up - regulated [ 31 ] .
on primary mouse articular cartilage explants cultures , interleukin - 1beta ( il - 1beta ) treatment enhanced their epas1 , mmp - 3 , mmp - 13 and adamts - 5 genes expression and down - regulated collagen type ii ( col2a1 ) gene expression. with the pre - treatment of 10 - 8m ecd , the catabolic effects of il - 1beta on articular cartilage were scavenged ( figure 3 ) .
hypoxic signaling plays an essential role in maintaining oxygen homeostasis and cell survival .
recent studies have identified an important role for hif - 1 and hif - 2 in the regulation of skeletal development , bone formation , and regeneration , as well as joint formation and homeostasis .
in addition , over - expression of hif - 1 and hif - 2 is clinically associated with osteosarcoma and osteoarthritis .
together , these findings implicate hypoxic signaling as a central regulator of skeletal biology and disease [ 32 ] .
it is reported that hif - 2alpha ( like il - 1beta ) does not induce transcription of adamts5 [ 3,4 ] .
instead , il - 1beta and certain other inflammatory mediators promote activation of latent adamts - 5 , as does hypertrophic differentiation in chondrocytes [ 3,4 ] .
in this study , we demonstrated that il - 1beta ( epas1 or hif - 2alpha ) induce articular cartilage inflammation and manifested as up - regulation of mmp - 3 , mmp - 13 and adamts - 5 under normoxic status ; ecd has protective effects on articular cartilage by inhibiting epas1 , mmp - 3 , mmp - 13 and adamts - 5 , but there is no ability to recover the cartilage phenotype as col2a1 gene was not affected ( figure 4 ) .
our study also demonstrated that adamts - 5 is the main mediators of the inflammatory cytokine involved under hypoxic status , ( figure 4 ) .
there is no cure for osteoarthritis. by piecing together the molecular events that drive the progression of this debilitating disease , recent studies put hypoxia - inducible factor - 2alpha ( hif - 2alpha ) in the driver 's seat , opening up new avenues for early detection and treatment [ 6 ] .
the findings of our study are consistent with the observations that inflammation of articular cartilage stimulates adamts5 activation .
the adamts5 activation directly and also indirectly by promoting expression of mmp - 3 , mmp13 which not only acts on adamts5 but also degrades certain cartilage extracellular matrix constituents under normoxic status .
under the hypoxic status , the inflammation of articular cartilage mainly stimulates adamts5 activation .
hence , synergy between different pathways , both stimulated by hif - 2alpha is a core feature of osteoarthritis chondrocyte biology ( figure 5 ) .
this aspect of the model is important , because some therapies in development have focused on adamts5 , but other pathways may offer new means to target adamts5 [ 33 ] .
in summary , il - 1beta enhanced epas1 mrna levels , with suppression of collagen type ii ( col2a1 ) expression .
figure 5 molecular mechanism of ecd chondroprotective effect .
both physical and chemical factors may induce cartilage degradation via il - 1beta / hif - 2alpha pathway ; 20 - hydroxyecdysone ( ecd ) does have chondroprotective effect and can inhibit il - 1beta - induced cartilage catabolism via hif - 2alpha pathway .
conclusion 20 - hydroxyecdysone ( ecd ) does have chondroprotective effect and ecd has protective effects on articular cartilage by inhibiting epas1 , mmp - 3 , mmp - 13 and adamts - 5 .
ecd can inhibit il - 1beta - induced cartilage destruction via hif - 2alpha pathway .
however , further researches by in - vivo hif - 1alpha gene knock - down and translational medicine are mandatory for the possible clinical application in the future .

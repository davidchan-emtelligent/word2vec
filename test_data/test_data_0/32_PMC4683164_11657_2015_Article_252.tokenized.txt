summary in this cross - sectional analysis of the uk biobank cohort , a history of fracture was associated with increased risk of current widespread chronic pain .
purpose / introduction we aimed to test the hypothesis that a history of fracture is associated with reporting chronic widespread bodily pain ( cwbp ) , using baseline data from the uk biobank cohort , comprising 502,656 people aged 40 - 69 years .
methods the case definition of current chronic widespread bodily pain was based on a response of ' yes' to the question ' do you have pain all over the body ?' and ' yes' to ' and have you experienced pain all over the body for more than 3 months ? ?
multivariable poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to test the relationship between fracture ( occurring within 5 years prior to the baseline interview , and recorded by self - report ) at the spine , hip , upper limb or lower limb and cwbp , adjusting for confounders .
results of 501,733 participants ( mean age 56.5 years ) , 7130 individuals reported cwbp and 23,177 had a history of fracture affecting the upper limb , lower limb , spine and / or hip .
individuals with prior fracture were significantly more likely to report cwbp than those without .
after adjustment for potential risk factors ( age , gender , demographic , lifestyle and socioeconomic , and psychological ) , risk ratios were attenuated but remained statistically significant with a more than doubling of risk for cwbp with spine fractures in men ( risk ratio ( rr ) 2.67 , 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 1.66 - 4.31 ; p < 0.001 ) and women ( rr 2.13 , 95 % ci 1.35 - 3.37 , p = 0.001 ) and with hip fractures in women ( rr 2.19 , 95 % ci 1.33 - 3.59 ; p = 0.002 ) .
conclusions in this cross - sectional analysis , previous fracture is associated with an increased likelihood of chronic widespread bodily pain , particularly with hip fractures in women , and spine fractures in both sexes .
if replicated , these findings may help inform the identification of those most at risk of chronic widespread pain post - fracture , allowing preventative measures to be targeted .
keywords epidemiology chronic widespread pain fracture uk biobank stressors issue - copyright - statement ( c ) international osteoporosis foundation and national osteoporosis foundation 2016 background chronic widespread pain is common and associated with distress , disability and substantial direct and indirect health care costs [ 1 , 2 ] .
estimates of prevalence rates vary from 4.7 % [ 3 ] to 24 % [ 4 ] depending on study design and case definition [ 2 ] .
chronic widespread pain became conceptualised in 1990 , for the first time within the case definition of a disease , by the american college of rheumatologists when they defined it as pain that is bilateral , above and below the waist and in the axial skeleton , for more than 3 months .
in the presence of an elevated number ( 11 of 18 ) of ' tender points ' , as evidence of allodynia , these became the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia syndrome [ 5 ] .
chronic widespread pain , using this and other definitions [ 3 ] , has been much studied , and the importance of chronic widespread pain to individuals , health care providers and society as a whole has become widely recognised .
it is associated not only with high levels of morbidity but also with increased rates of mortality , attributable mostly to excess cardiovascular disease and cancer [ 6 - 8 ] .
a wide variety of exposures have been identified as risk factors for chronic widespread pain , relating not only to social and psychological factors but also to physical insults such as acute ' whiplash ' injury in road traffic accidents [ 2 ] .
however , it is unclear whether the occurrence of a bony fracture , a common clinical event causing acute stress with tissue damage , predisposes to an increased risk of chronic widespread pain .
therefore , the aim of the current study was to determine whether fractures were associated with chronic widespread pain , using data from the uk biobank cohort .
methods study subjects we conducted a cross - sectional analysis using baseline data collected in the uk biobank study .
uk national health service ( nhs ) registers maintain records of almost everybody in the general population ( that is , excluding the small number of individuals not legally registered as resident ) .
the protocol is available publicly ( http :// www.ukbiobank.ac.uk / wp - content / uploads / 2011 / 11 / uk - biobank - protocol.pdf ? phpmyadmin = trmkqlydjjnqigj % 2cfazikmhenx6 ) .
using these records , around 9.2 million primary invitations were sent to individuals aged 40 - 69 years living within a reasonable travelling distance of a total of 22 assessment centres across great britain 2007 - 2010 [ 9 , 10 ] .
this age range was chosen to allow time for a wide range of incident disease events to accrue , permitting case - control studies to be undertaken in the investigation of the determinants of chronic non - communicable diseases of middle and later life .
data collection participants completed a series of touchscreen computer - based questionnaires followed by a face - to - face interview with trained research staff .
details of the assessments and variables are publicly available ( http :// biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk / crystal /) , and a transcript of the touchscreen questionnaire may be downloaded ( http :// www.ukbiobank.ac.uk / wp - content / uploads / 2011 / 06 / touch _ screen _ questionnaire.pdf ? phpmyadmin = trmkqlydjjnqigj % 2cfazikmhenx6 ) .
the information collected included socio - demographics ( age , gender , ethnicity , educational attainment , employment status , household income , and postcode of residence with corresponding deprivation index score ) , lifestyle factors ( including cigarette smoking , diet , physical activity , and alcohol use ) , and self - reported history of physician - diagnosed major depression .
participants also completed a series of questions , using a self - administered touchscreen questionnaire , which assessed current symptoms of psychological well - being , and included questions from which a neuroticism score could be calculated , together with indices of social support and social functioning .
there were a number of questions about pain in uk biobank , and for this study , the case definition of current chronic widespread bodily pain ( cwbp ) was based on a response of ' yes' to the question ' do you have pain all over the body ?' and yes to ' and have you experienced pain all over the body for more than 3 months ?' .
all participants were asked if they had broken / fractured any bone in the previous 5 years and , if they responded positively , they were asked to identify where they had fractured from the following list of sites : ankle , leg , hip , spine , wrist , arm , other or unknown .
for the purposes of the current analyses , fractures reported to have occurred in the arm / wrist were amalgamated as ' upper limb ' fractures and those in the leg / ankle were combined as ' lower limb ' fractures .
height and weight were measured in all participants by trained data collectors during the clinic attendance using standard operating procedures , and body mass index ( bmi ) subsequently calculated ( kg / m2 ) .
the townsend deprivation index was used as a measure of socio - economic status ( with a greater value corresponding to greater deprivation ) .
this integrates measures of unemployment , non - car ownership , non - home ownership and household overcrowding by neighbourhood across the uk [ 11 ] .
this study was conducted under generic approval from the nhs national research ethics service ( 17th june 2011 , ref 11 / nw / 0382 ) .
participants provided electronic consent for the baseline assessments .
statistical analyses data were analysed using stata v12.1 ( statacorp , college station , tx , usa ) .
we examined the associations between fracture at the four different sites and chronic widespread bodily pain ( cwbp ) , as the outcome , using multivariable poisson regression models with robust standard errors .
in order to explore the modifying effects of anthropometry , lifestyle and psychological measures , we used three incremental multivariate models .
the considered covariates are based on their associations ( either previously documented or hypothesised ) with fracture and chronic pain [ 2 , 12 ] .
in the absence of a specific marker of dietary quality , we used intake of fruit and vegetables , as this has been previously demonstrated to correlate well with quality of the overall diet [ 13 ] .
thus associations were first adjusted for age , sex , bmi , and ethnicity ( model 1 ) and were further adjusted for cigarette smoking , alcohol consumption , fruit and vegetable intake , deprivation index , household income and physical activity ( model 2 ) .
in model 3 , we additionally adjusted for neuroticism score , social support and history of major depression .
results characteristics of participants in total , uk biobank recruited 502,656 individuals .
complete data on cwbp and fracture were available for 501,733 participants , mean age 56.5 years , amongst whom there were 228,724 men and 273,009 women .
most ( 94.24 %) of the population were caucasian .
a total of 47,475 ( 9.46 %) participants reported a history of at least one fracture of the upper limb , lower limb , spine or hip over the preceding 5 years .
upper limb fractures were the most common , followed by lower limb , spine and then hip .
amongst those who had sustained fractures , 23,177 ( 48.8 %) reported fracture at one site , 1219 ( 2.57 %) reported fractures at two of the sites , 73 ( 0.15 %) at three sites and 3 ( 0.01 %) at all four sites .
women reported fractures more commonly than men ( 6.13 % women vs. 3.99 % men , p < 0.001 ) , and caucasians reported fractures more commonly than all other ethnic groups ( 4.95 % caucasians vs. 3.87 % asian vs. 3.10 % black , p < 0.001 ) .
participants with fractures had a higher median deprivation index than those without ( - 1.87 vs - 2.15 , p < 0.001 ) .
in total , cwbp was reported by 7130 participants ( 1.42 % overall ; prevalence 1.13 % in men and 1.66 % in women ). of the 7130 participants with widespread pain , 986 ( 13.8 %) had a previous fracture and 580 ( 8.1 %) had at least one of hip , spine , upper or lower limb fracture .
sixty - five ( 0.9 %) reported previous fractures at two or more of these sites .
the characteristics of those with and without cwbp are summarised in table 1 .
current cigarette smokers reported cwbp more than never smokers ( 2.48 vs. 1.23 % , p < 0.001 ) , and median deprivation index was higher among those with cwbp compared to those without ( - 0.31 vs. - 2.16 , p < 0.001 ) .

however , there was slight attenuation of the rrs ( lowest 1.35 for females with lower limb fractures through to 3.09 for males with spine fractures ) .
in model 3 , additional adjustment for psychological factors ( major depression , social support and neuroticism score ) further attenuated the rrs , but strongly statistically significant associations remained with greater than a doubling of risk of cwbp in women with spine ( rr 2.13 ; 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 1.35 to 3.37 ) and hip fractures ( rr 2.19 ; 95 % ci 1.33 to 3.59 ) and in men with spine fractures ( rr 2.67 ; 95 % ci 1.66 to 4.31 ; fig. 1 ) .

adjusted 1 : adjusted for sex , age , bmi , ethnicity ; adjusted 2 : as for adjusted 1 and further adjusted for smoking , alcohol , fruit consumption , vegetables consumption , physical activity , deprivation index and income ; adjusted 3 : as for adjusted 2 and further adjusted for neuroticism score and major depression discussion overall , individuals who had experienced a fracture were significantly more likely to also report cwbp than people who did not report a fracture .
these effects were observed for fractures at the spine , hip , upper and lower limbs , and other sites but were most pronounced for spine and hip fractures where a doubling of risk was observed , independent of potential confounding factors .
although a history of fracture has not previously been specifically associated with chronic widespread pain , the characteristics of other traumatic events , which have been linked to this outcome , may aid understanding of our current findings .
stressful events and trauma have been implicated in chronic widespread pain previously [ 12 , 14 - 17 ] .
for example , rates of chronic widespread pain have been shown to increase immediately after major disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes with peaks that are bimodal , one occurring immediately after the event ( presumably attributable to direct trauma ) but with a second peak of pain a few weeks later , less well explained by acute trauma [ 18 ] .
the relationship between motor vehicle collisions and chronic widespread pain and fibromyalgia has been widely investigated [ 12 , 19 - 21 ] .
interestingly , there is evidence that the risk of whiplash syndrome after a vehicle collision is more associated with the pre - morbid health of the individual than the nature of the collision itself [ 12 ] ; there is a weak relationship between the degree of damage or abnormality in the neck and the degree of pain or functional impairment that an individual experiences [ 20 , 21 ] .
it could be that it is the environment within which an event occurs that may be the most important determinant of the physiological consequences .
there is evidence from neuroendocrine studies that it is those stressors perceived by the individual as inescapable or unavoidable , or which are unpredictable or occur when an individual lacks social support , which evoke the strongest adverse biological consequences [ 22 ] .
within this construct of causation , it is possible to conjecture that fractures are acute , traumatic uncontrollable life events which could be important in determining risk of chronic widespread pain in a genetically , psychologically or biologically predisposed individual .
an alternative explanation would be that chronic widespread pain , possibly through reduced physical activity [ 3 , 23 ] , might predispose to fracture .
conversely , in this age group , where trauma is an important contributor to fracture pathogenesis [ 24 ] , lowered physical activity might also lead to a reduced exposure to situations in which physical trauma might be experienced .
unfortunately , it was not possible to explore this point further in the present study as information on the level of trauma involved in each fracture was not available .
the mechanisms underlying chronic widespread pain are likely to be complex and are currently poorly understood .
there is growing evidence for a role of genetic factors [ 25 ] , early life effects on neuronal plasticity , central sensitisation [ 19 ] and involvement of neuro - hormonal systems such as the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis [ 26 ] and sympathetic nervous system [ 19 ] .
undoubtedly , stress ( acute and chronic ) causes psychological manifestations that are associated with the experience and reporting of pain .
it is interesting therefore that , although attenuated , the association between cwbp and fracture remained even after adjustment for psychological factors , particularly for fractures at the hip and spine .
it could be that acute or chronic trauma or stress leads to important lifestyle changes which have an effect on tolerance of or perception of pain , for example alterations in physical activity , smoking or alcohol consumption .
however , our statistical analyses demonstrated persisting associations between prior fracture and cwbp after adjustment for such factors .
our data suggest that the mechanism cannot be purely psychological or lifestyle - mediated and , therefore , lend some epidemiological support to the hypothesis of lyon and colleagues who suggested that chronic widespread pain could be part of a whole - organism stress response which is evolutionarily conserved and follows a pattern found in the simplest living systems [ 27 ] .
interestingly , the associations appeared strongest for fractures at the hip and spine , compared with fractures in the upper or lower limbs .
these latter groupings clearly represent a more heterogeneous range of fractures , some major and some more minor ( e.g. wrist ) with less impact on quality of life and fewer specific effects likely to lead to chronic pain [ 24 ] .
in contrast , the high levels of morbidity and decreased survival following a hip and spine fractures is well documented , as are the potential changes in body shape , such as kyphosis , leading to pain and respiratory difficulties following vertebral fracture [ 24 ] .
the associations also appeared of greater magnitude in men than in women , and it is unclear what might explain this observation , but greater exposure to trauma as a cause of fractures amongst men might be one factor .
finally , although the maximum effect size that we observed represented more than a doubling of risk , given the low prevalence of cwbp in our cohort , the absolute risk difference for cwbp between those with no fracture ( prevalence 1.37 %) and hip or spine fractures ( prevalence 4.05 %) was 2.68 % .
however , given the vast number of fractures annually across the country [ 28 ] , these figures still represent a significant disease burden overall .
in considering these results , the following limitations are important .
the inclusion of large sample sizes can lead to small differences between groups reaching the threshold of statistical significance , which may not in fact reflect a clinically meaningful difference .
however , we observed risk ratios around 2 , which suggest biologically important relationships .
second , the cross - sectional nature of the data collection for the current study prevents the investigation of the temporal associations between fracture and cwbp .
people were reporting current cwbp and a history of fractures , but they may have sustained fractures very recently or many years previously and we are unable to explore this further within the current study .
the lack of temporal clarity is likely to have introduced noise into the analyses and therefore biased towards the null hypothesis , and clearly impairs any ability to make causal influences .
furthermore , onset of cwbp may have been prior to the fracture event .
additionally , the age range of participants was relatively narrow , with older patients , who will be at higher fracture risk , under - represented .
although this does affect the generalisability of our findings , there is no reason to suppose that it would have influenced the results within the cohort .
third , it was not possible to use the definition of chronic widespread pain proposed by the american college of rheumatologists , and thus we could not compare case definitions .
this is also likely to contribute to the low prevalence of our definition in the cohort .
furthermore , as with many such studies , it is possible that there was a healthy selection bias in those individuals willing to take part , which again reduces generalisability , but , if anything , would tend to bias towards the null hypothesis .
fourth , the fracture data analysed here are self - reported and there is no possibility of verifying the fractures from clinical databases or radiographic analyses .
it is possible that people with cwbp recall fractures more readily than people without cwbp [ 29 ] , but the pain and fracture questions were a small part of a large battery of questions , with pain / fracture not cited as one of the major outcomes of interest of the uk biobank study .
it is unlikely that recall bias could explain differential relationships by fracture site , but it remains possible that recall bias may have contributed to the associations observed overall .
finally , the specific diagnosis of osteoarthritis is not captured at individual joints in uk biobank and , thus , it was not possible to explore whether osteoarthritis might account for some of the reports of cwbp .
in summary , these results suggest that a history of fracture is associated with increased likelihood of the presence of cwbp with associations that are not fully explained by psychological factors .
these relationships were particularly apparent for hip fracture in women and spine fractures in both sexes .
however , as these findings are cross - sectional , and the dates of fracture and onset of chronic pain were not known , replication of these findings in further cohorts will be required , ideally in prospective studies. with such an approach , if the association appears to be causal , these findings may inform the identification of those most at risk of chronic widespread pain post fracture , allowing preventative measures to be targeted and the impact of these debilitating sequelae ameliorated .

prepulse inhibition ( ppi ) is the decrease of startle reflex amplitude when a slight stimulus is previously generated .
this paradigm may provide valuable information about sensorimotor gating functionality .
here we aimed at determining the inhibited and uninhibited startle response of capuchin monkeys ( sapajus spp. ) , and to evaluate the role of the superior colliculus in ppi .
capuchin monkeys were tested in a whole - body protocol , to determine the best startle amplitude and interstimuli interval .
additionally we tested two subjects with bilateral superior colliculus damage in this protocol .
results show that 115 db auditory pulse has induced the best startle response .
in contrast to reports in other species , no habituation to the auditory stimuli was observed here in capuchins .
also , startle reflex inhibition was optimal after 120 msec interstimuli interval .
finally , there was a downward tendency of percentage inhibition in superior colliculus - lesioned monkeys .
our data provides the possibility of further studies with whole - body protocol in capuchin monkeys and reinforces the importance of the superior colliculus in ppi .

introduction acoustic startle reflex ( asr ) is an innate response that causes a rapid contraction of facial and bodily muscles provoked by an intense and sharp noise [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
asr can be used as an experimental model for the study of sensitization , habituation , prepulse inhibition , fear potentiated startle , as well as to test the effects of drugs on behaviour [ 3 ] - [ 6 ] .
prepulse inhibition ( ppi ) paradigm is the decrease of asr when a slight acoustic stimulus is previously generated [ 2 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
ppi depends on some stimuli - related variables , chiefly : intensity , duration , and interstimuli interval .
this behavioural paradigm may provide valuable information about sensorimotor gating functionality .
understanding the neural circuitry underlying ppi may provide important insights into neurological disorders , such as schizophrenia [ 9 ] .
indeed , ppi test is generally used as a screening procedure for substances with potential antipsychotic effects [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
in this sense , tests in nonhuman primates are crucial since their results may be more readily extrapolated to humans due to brain and behavioural similarities between monkeys and human beings .
some ppi paradigm - studies have identified interstimuli intervals , as well as stimuli intensities and duration for some nonhuman primates [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 12 ] .
midbrain is essential for ppi [ 3 ] , [ 13 ] .
in an experiment with rats yeomans et al [ 13 ] suggested that the mesencephalic pathways are involved in acoustic ppi .
they found that a fast auditory pathway from cochlear nucleus starting from inferior colliculus to the intercollicular nucleus , then it reaches intermediate layers of the superior colliculus ( sc ) and proceeds to tegmental pedunculopontine nucleus , which in turn projects to the basal ganglia and into the spinal cord .
yeomans et al [ 13 ] also emphasized a slower multisensory pathway started in sc intermediate layers .
these results support previous studies that demonstrated the importance of such structures in ppi [ 3 ] , [ 14 ] .
although sc is involved in responses to visual stimuli , including detection of salient stimuli , head and eyes orientation , saccadic movements and shifts of attention [ 15 ] - [ 20 ] , this subcortical structure is strongly implicated in defensive behaviours [ 21 ] - [ 24 ] .
in addiction , sc receives auditory inputs from inferior colliculus [ 25 ] that must be related to ppi [ 13 ] .
therefore , sc is an important center of multisensory integration that receives visual , auditory , and somatosensory information from several cortical and subcortical areas [ 26 ] - [ 28 ] .
the present study aimed to determine the pattern of startle response of individuals of sapajus spp. using whole - body protocol , to determine the best intensity and ppi interstimuli interval as well as to evaluate the role of the sc in capuchin monkeys in ppi .
materials and methods ethics statement all procedures involving animals had been conducted according to guidelines of the brazilian society of animal experimentation ( cobea ) and followed the principles of laboratory animal care ( nih publication no. 85 - 23 , revised 1996 ) .
this study was approved by the animal ethics committee of the institute of biology , university of brasilia ( unbdoc no 128181 / 2011 ) .
all experiments were conducted at primate center at university of brasilia , brazil .
animals were pair - housed in cages with natural substrate , with rope swings and nest boxes , measuring 3x3x1.8 m , under natural conditions of lightness and temperature .
animals were given access to food and water ad libitum .
new supply of food was offered twice daily , early morning and late in the day , and water was offered by automatic drinking fountain .
animals were under constant environmental enriching tasks as usual in our primate center .
no animal was submitted to any kind of suffering .
in order to minimize stress during experiments , animals were submitted to acclimation sessions ( see below ) , in which they received fruits reward for quiet standing in test equipment .
since animals are still under behavioural studies , no individual has been euthanized after the present study .
subjects a total of 12 capuchin monkeys ( sapajus spp. ) , 8 females and 4 males , weighing between 2 and 5 kg were employed in this study .
animals were submitted to test sessions after feed time between 8 - 12 am , five days a week .
subjects were placed inside the experimental chamber ( see description below ) by an experimenter and were submitted to 5 - 8 sessions for acclimation .
animals remained for 60 min per day inside the chamber with 65 db white noise on. during this period the monkeys received fruits reward for quiet standing .
similar procedure was used for 10 min before every test session .
procedures three different tests were performed in the following sequence : startle response amplitude , prepulse inhibition and superior colliculus lesion .
in startle response amplitude test , 6 animals ( 4 females and 2 males ) were employed .
in prepulse inhibition test , all the same 6 subjects were employed and we added 2 females .
the 8 subjects used in prepulse inhibition test were also employed in the sc - lesion test as a control group .
beyond these 8 subjects , we employed 2 females as the sham - group and 2 males as the lesion - group .
all those tests are detailed below at next sections .
tests were conducted in a room next to the house cage inside an acoustically isolated compartment ( 140x100x170 cm ) , with a permanent white noise of approximately 65 db. a bottomless chamber measuring 60x30x30 cm was built in transparent acrylic material of 15 mm thick and placed above a wooden box measuring 45x40x40 cm ( fig. 1 ) .
this wooden box was built to keep the animal away from the ground improving the welfare of the subjects during tests .
subjects were placed inside the acrylic chamber with its head out .
the top of the chamber had an adjustable hole that held the subjects neck .
a device ( 30x30x25 cm ) equipped with two speakers ( foster model ft96h frequency band ; 4 khz ~ 30 khz ) was placed above subject 's head , whereas each speaker was 10 cm away from the head .
speakers were connected to a sound generator ( o'hara & co. , ltd. , tokyo ) and a video camera ( model clone # 1004124 ) , which allowed continuous monitoring of the subject by an external computer during the procedure .
subject 's whole - body movement were captured by an accelerometer ( inntechno japan co.ltd. , model : bdk3 ) located on the bottom of chamber and connected to an amplifier ( o'hara & co. , ltd. ) .
the whole system was connected to a recording software ( animal startle - pci 6024e , developed by o'hara & co. , ltd. ) , interfaced with windows xp operational system , which allowed adjustment of some recording features .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0105551.g001 figure 1 primate test chamber .
monkeys were positioned with the neck at the neck - hole in a standing position on the accelerometer platform .
startle response amplitude six animals ( two males and four females ) were employed in this experiment .
the startle amplitude was measured in a single session with 10 equal and consecutive blocks of 5 pseudorandom white noise stimuli each ( 90 , 95 , 100 , 115 , 120 db ) .
inter - stimulus interval was 60 sec and the duration of each stimulus was 40 msec .
startle response was defined as the maximum peak voltage amplitude of the accelerometer over 400 msec after stimulus presentation .
basal activity was defined as the maximum peak voltage over 400 msec before stimulus presentation .
prepulse inhibition eight animals ( two males and six females ) were employed on a single session of 7 equal and consecutive blocks of 7 pseudorandom trials each ( pulse - alone , prepulse - alone and 5 prepulse - pulse trials ranging inter - stimulus intervals : 45 , 70 , 120 , 520 , 1020 msec ) .
pulse and prepulse were 115 db and 80 db white noise stimuli respectively and inter - trial interval was 60 sec .
startle response was recorded over 1800 msec after each presentation .
superior colliculus lesion ppi was conducted in two males submitted to bilateral neurotoxic lesions of the sc and two females that were submitted to sc - sham surgery .
ibotenic acid ( ibo ) was infused in four injection sites , two in each sc ( 10 mg / kg in phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) ; sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) at a rate of 1 microl / 5 min not to cause mechanical damages on those structures .
in each site 0.4 - 0.8 microl ibo was delivered and the glass pipette was left inside the brain for 2 min to allow the dispersion and to avoid reflux during removal .
injection sites were determined by means of a stereotaxic atlas for sapajus [ 29 ] .
the sc - sham group was submitted to the same overall procedure , but instead ibo , the same volume of pbs vehicle was infused .
for more details about surgery and evaluation of extent of injury , see maior et al [ 23 ] .
we also submitted the same eight animals ( control group ) cited above to the ppi test described in this session .
animals were employed on a single session of 10 equal and consecutive blocks of 3 pseudorandom stimuli each ( pulse - alone , 115 db , 40 msec duration ; prepulse - alone , 80 db , 20 msec duration and pulse - prepulse , 120 msec interval ) .
startle response was recorded as maximum peak amplitude over 600 msec after each presentation .
statistical analysis startle response amplitude one - factor repeated - measures analysis of variance ( anova ) and post hoc bonferroni test were performed to examine the effects of stimulus intensity on startle amplitude relative to basal activity , the startle response to different stimulus intensities and the mean startle response for all intensities along trial blocks .
prepulse inhibition the percent inhibition of the startle response was calculated for each subject by the following formula : 100x ([ pulse - alone ] - [ prepulse - pulse ])/( pulse - alone ) as done in previous ppi studies [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
one - factor anova was performed using prepulse interval and trial block as within - subjects factors .
also a post hoc bonferroni test was performed to examine individual main and interaction effects .
superior colliculus lesion the details of the lesion were published elsewhere [ 23 ] .
ibo injections resulted in circumscribed bilateral lesions , characterized by cell loss filled with gliosis , identified as hypersignal in t - 2weighed and flair scans ( 2 - mm thick images ) .
the lesions encompassed all sc layers down to inferior colliculus and central gray and extended two - thirds of the rostrocaudal sc axis in all subjects .
no discernible damage was found in the tissues above sc due to ibo leaking during cannula retraction .
percent inhibition was calculated as explained in session 2.6.2 .
a kruskal - wallis analysis comparing the means for each group was performed to compare the percentage inhibition of the startle response among lesion , sham - lesion and control groups .
results raw data of the three tests ( startle response amplitude , prepulse inhibition and superior colliculus lesion ) are available in table s1 , table s2 and table s3 respectively .
startle response amplitude acoustic startle response amplitude showed a gradual increase with increasing of stimulus intensity in the control monkeys .
no difference was found in basal activity [ f ( 0.81 ) ; p = 0.51 ] .
there was no statistical difference over the course of 10 repeated trial blocks , showing that there was no habituation during the test trial [ f ( 0.862 ) ; p = 0.55 ] ( fig. 2 - a ) .
figure 2 - b shows the mean amplitude startle response relative to baseline activity .
all intensities caused greater startle responses than the basal activity ( p < 0.05 ) .
anova followed by post hoc bonferroni test indicated that only 90x95 db and 115x120 db intensities had no significant difference between themselves ( p > 0.05 ) .

prepulse inhibition there was no habituation over the course of 7 trial blocks in the control monkeys [ f ( 0.99 ) ; p = 0.43 ] ( fig. 3 - a ) .
anova followed by post hoc bonferroni test indicated that only in prepulse - pulse 120 msec - interval trial mean amplitude was different of pulse - alone trial amplitude ( p = 0.01 ) .
in all others cases , prepulse - pulse trials had the same response amplitude as pulse - alone trials ( p > 0.17 ) .
also , prepulse - alone was different of pulse - alone response ( p < 0.01 ) ( fig. 3 - b ) .

as seen in fig. 4 - b , kruskal - wallis analyses yielded no significant difference on percent inhibition between the three groups despite a tendency to deficit of prepulse inhibition in sc - lesion animals ( x2 = 2.965 ; p = 0.227 ) .

discussion in the present study , we demonstrated startle response in sapajus spp. in a whole - body paradigm .
our findings are consistent with the study accomplished by winslow et al .
[ 5 ] in rhesus monkeys , which revealed the possibility to evaluate macaca startle pattern with the measurement of whole - body activity .
now we demonstrated that with the same protocol , capuchin and rhesus monkeys exhibit the same pattern of startle and ppi responses .
to our knowledge there is only one previous report of ppi in capuchin monkeys .
linn and javitt [ 12 ] adapted an eyeblink protocol apparatus for testing in humans and found similar results as the present study .
the pattern of ppi response followed expectations .
we found that 115 db and 120 db were equally good to cause startle response .
considering that 115 db was capable of inducing the expected response in our subjects and that it is also the same intensity found in literature for other primates [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 30 ] , this intensity was selected as startle intensity for the subsequent tests .
as in other nonhuman primate species , a prepulse intensity of 80 db was ideal to inhibit the startle response generated by an 115 db pulse .
also , the interstimuli interval that best inhibited startle response was 120 msec , in keeping with previous reports in other nonhuman primates [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 30 ] .
in the sc - lesion test , we intended to evaluate our experimental protocol and test the role of sc on ppi response in primates .
thus , it was possible to show that there is a downward tendency of prepulse inhibition in animals with sc damage as well as demonstrated in rats [ 14 ] , [ 31 ] .
although caution should be taken when analysing this tentative study , the percentage inhibition found was not significant across the experimental groups .
sc is an important and well - known structure related to visual information ( for review [ 22 ]) , however sc also receives multisensory information , such as tactile and auditory [ 26 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] .
sc deep layers are also related to defensive behaviours such as freezing , darting and shift of attention in rodents [ 20 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] , as well as prey - predator behaviour in primates [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
therefore , further testing might lead to a better understanding of sc 's role in nonhuman primate ppi .
habituation is a learning process whereby behavioural responses decrease after repeated stimulations [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] .
as seen in figs. 2 - a and 3 - a , we observe a non - significant reduction of the startle amplitude during the session test , i.e. , no habituation was observed .
in humans , 13 trials are optimal to reduce behavioural responses with a 100 db startle stimulus [ 38 ] and in rhesus monkeys a small decrease in startle amplitude has been observed after 5 blocks of stimuli presentation within session [ 5 ] .
interestingly , deficits in startle habituation have been observed in schizophrenic patients [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .
habituation in subjects with damage to the superior colliculus was also not observed ( fig. 4 - a ) .
nevertheless , it is known that schizophrenia patients show deficits in habituation due to dysfunction on the hippocampus , which indicates that this reduction of behavioural response may be correlated with memory performance [ 41 ] and perhaps there is no relation with the superior colliculus .
regardless , the lack of habituation in observed here suggests that ppi testing on this species may help understand the habituation patterns seen in schizophrenic patients .
the validation of the ppi test with whole - body experimental protocol using capuchin monkeys enables new preclinical studies to test potential antipsychotic substances .
many studies have been conducted with rodents [ 42 ] - [ 44 ] , but due to sapajus phylogenetic proximity with humans , the use of these animals as experimental models for drug testing may yield more reliable results .
conclusions the present study validates the ppi paradigm for testing in capuchin monkeys .
habituation to auditory stimuli was not seen here in sapajus as reported in humans and rhesus .
this was the first study that shows ppi responses of sc - lesioned primates , thus the results might be relevant to understand the role of the sc in humans' neurological disorders with impairment in sensorimotor gating mechanisms , as schizophrenia .
further validation of our experimental protocol enables future studies in order to find new antipsychotic drugs .

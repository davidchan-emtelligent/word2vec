halothane was introduced as an anesthetic in the 1950s and was considered a revolutionary agent in the field of anesthesia .
soon after , halothane - induced hepatitis became a concern , leading to the development of less toxic gases that induced a lower incidence of side effects .
two types of halothane - related hepatotoxicity have been described : type 1 , or mild hepatitis , is associated with elevated transaminase levels and self - limiting symptoms , and type 2 , or severe hepatotoxicity , is associated with acute fatal liver failure and is fatal in most cases .
hepatotoxicity is most likely to be immune - related , based on much evidence .
free radicals that are produced by the metabolism of halothane in the liver can modify cellular proteins and introduce neo - antigens to the immune system .
sensitization to these neo - antigens induces a more severe response after multiple exposures ; most cases of type 2 hepatitis occur after repeated contact .
new halogenated anesthetics such as enflurane , sevoflurane , and desflurane , are not metabolized in the liver , causing few cases of sensitization .
compared with halothane , these anesthetics are expensive .
as a result , replacement of halothane with new halogenated anesthetics requires a precise cost - benefit analysis , especially in developing countries that have low health care budgets .
halothane hepatitis halogenated anesthetics background halothane was synthesized by the british chemist charles suckling over 2 years of research and testing .
its required concentration for anesthesia was predicted , and the drug was tested by a well - known anesthesiologist , michael johnston , who recognized its superior properties compared with other anesthetics that were available at that time [ 1 ] .
development of halothane was considered as a great progress in anesthesiology , and it was introduced globally in 1956 [ 2 ] .
subsequently , several reports of postsurgical lethal hepatotoxicity in patients who were anesthetized with halothane emerged [ 3 ][ 4 ][ 5 ][ 6 ] .
two types of halothane hepatotoxicity have been described .
type 1 , or mild hepatitis , is associated with elevated transaminase levels and self - limiting symptoms , and type 2 , or severe hepatotoxicity , is associated with acute fatal liver failure , resulting in death in most cases .
in addition , seeking an ideal drug that was associated with pleasant induction and rapid recovery , these reports led to the synthesis of new agents with greater efficacy and safety .
methoxyflurane was introduced in the 1960s and was popular for several years , but its dose - related nephrotoxicity prompted the development of newer agents [ 7 ][ 8 ][ 9 ] .
several members of this family , such as enflurane [ 10 ] , isoflurane [ 11 ] , desflurane [ 12 ] and sevoflurane [ 13 ] were introduced sequentially .
despite the synthesis of new agents with a lower incidence of hepatitis - related side effects and development of techniques for faster induction and rapid recovery [ 14 ] , their high cost has limited their use , especially in developing countries .
yet , the actual incidence of halothane - induced hepatitis in large - scale studies has not been significant [ 15 ] .
hepatitis has also been reported with newer agents , such as desflurane , sevoflurane , and isoflurane [ 16 ][ 17 ][ 18 ] .
thus , substitution of halothane with newer agents and its financial benefits must be examined , especially in developing countries [ 19 ] .
we performed a literature search in pubmed , medline , and scopus using the following keywords and their combinations : halothane , hepatitis , inhalational anesthetics , and halogenated anesthetics .
relevant data , focusing on halothane - induced hepatitis and comparing halothane with new halogenated anesthetics were extracted and reviewed .
mechanism the exact mechanism of halothane - induced hepatotoxicity is unknown , but there is strong evidence that the immune system mediates hepatitis - related mortality [ 20 ] .
increased levels of circulating immune complexes , rash , and arthralgia , which implicate involvement of the immune system , are associated with halothane - induced hepatitis [ 21 ][ 22 ] .
in the serum of affected patients , antibodies against hepatocytes exist [ 23 ][ 24 ] .
based on these observations , it has been hypothesized that the immune system mediates the development of hepatotoxicity .
on the other hand , greater severe liver dysfunction and necrosis is reported among patients with repeated exposure to halothane [ 25 ] , which has strengthened this hypothesis .
known human risk factors such as female gender , adulthood , and genetics have been used to develop an animal model of halothane hepatitis , in which severe hepatitis with lesions , similar to halothane hepatitis in humans , has been produced [ 26 ] .
although more severe form of hepatic damage is believed to be immune - mediated , mild forms of hepatic injury following halothane exposure are attributed to the intracellular metabolism of halothane and local alterations in hepatic blood flow and oxygen demand , resulting in hepatic hypoxia [ 27 ] .
halothane undergoes hepatic oxidative or reductive metabolism to a greater extent than other inhalational anesthetics [ 27 ][ 28 ] , which is primarily mediated through cytochrome p450 ( cyp450 ) [ 29 ][ 30 ][ 31 ] .
under normal conditions , up to one - third of halothane is metabolized through the oxidative pathway and catalyzed by cytochrome p450 2e1 and 2a6 while ; less than 1 % is metabolized through the reductive pathway [ 27 ][ 30 ][ 32 ]. trifluoroacetylchloride ( tfa ) , an extremely reactive molecule , is generated by the reaction between lysine and halothane metabolites [ 30 ][ 31 ][ 32 ] , which yields neo - antigens by binding to the hepatocyte macromolecules [ 33 ][ 34 ][ 35 ][ 36 ] .
these neo - antigens can provoke immune responses against hepatocytes and induce fulminant hepatitis [ 22 ][ 29 ][ 37 ] .
neo - antigens can also be expressed on kupffer cells , rendering the antigen - presenting cells [ 38 ][ 39 ] .
these results implicate the immune response in the development of fulminant halothane - related postsurgical hepatic dysfunction .
lethal hepatocyte necrosis rises in serum aminotransferase levels , lipid peroxidation , and inactivation of cyp450 can be induced by free radicals that are produced during nonoxidative halothane metabolization [ 40 ][ 41 ][ 42 ] .
this can be considered for milder forms of halothane - induced hepatitis , because only a small amount of halothane is degraded through non - oxidative pathway [ 43 ][ 44 ] .
although less frequent , hepatic failure has been reported following exposure to enflurane [ 45 ] , isoflurane [ 46 ] and desflurane [ 47 ] .
only 2.4 % of enflurane is degraded [ 48 ] , causing few cases of hepatotoxicity [ 49 ][ 50 ] .
less than 0.2 % of desflurane is metabolized [ 51 ] .
in contrast , desflurane is strongly stable , with just 0.01 % metabolism [ 52 ] .
consequently , based on the model of immune - mediated hepatotoxicity , desflurane should be the ideal inhaled anesthetic , because it causes the least free radical formation .
manifestation two types of halothane - induced hepatotoxicity have been described , based on the severity of symptoms : mild hepatitis with elevations in aminotransferase levels and self - limiting symptoms [ 53 ][ 54 ][ 55 ] , and severe hepatitis ( or acute liver failure ) .
halothane degradation products and local hypoxia , due to insufficient blood supply and altered oxygen consumption , are chief causes of mild form of hepatotoxicity [ 27 ] .
this condition usually presents as elevated liver transaminase levels following surgery .
some patients develop self - limited rash , arthralgia , lethargy , nausea and fever [ 15 ][ 56 ][ 57 ][ 58 ] .
common manifestations of sever halothane - induced hepatitis are fever , anorexia , nausea , myalgia , arthralgia and rash common manifestations of severe halothane - induced hepatitis [ 59 ] .
hepatomegaly and jaundice are also frequently observed , and eosinophilia has been reported in approximately 40 % of patients , highlighting the immunological basis of this condition [ 60 ] .
diagnosis halothane - induced hepatitis is a diagnosis of exclusion .
elevated serum aminotransferase levels , rash , arthralgia , jaundice and hepatomegaly are observed in various hepatic diseases and do not necessarily confirm a diagnosis .
in contrast , other possible diagnoses such as surgical complications , preoperative hypotension , sepsis , infection , hepatotoxicity due to other drugs and viral hepatitis , should be considered .
treatment most cases of halothane - induced hepatitis are managed by supportive care [ 54 ] .
most mild cases do not need intensive care and resolve spontaneously with little intervention , but more severe fulminant hepatitis requires intensive care .
several treatment modalities such as urgent liver transplantation are efficacious in these patients [ 54 ] .
resolution of jaundice has been reported following methionine therapy in several case reports whereas no well - designed studies on this technique have been performed [ 61 ] .
corticosteroids do not have proven efficacy , and they might exacerbate the course of hepatitis [ 61 ] .
patients are typically managed according to the complications of acute liver failure , such as hepatic encephalopathy , cerebral edema , renal failure and metabolic disturbances .
prevalence the estimated incidence of halothane - induced hepatitis varies between studies .
the largest study was conducted by the national institute of health , which reviewed approximately 250,000 cases of halothane exposure ; the incidence of severe life - threatening hepatic failure was 1 / 35,000 [ 25 ] .
the incidence rate has been reported to range between 1 / 6000 and 1 / 35,000 [ 62 ] .
one of the most significant risk factors of severe hepatitis is re - exposure to it. after several exposures , these rates can reach 1 / 1400 [ 25 ] .
a genetic predisposition has been demonstrated in patients with severe hepatitis .
thus , halothane is not recommended in patients who have a family history of halothane sensitization [ 63 ][ 64 ][ 65 ] .
in some studies , caucasian background , obesity , age above 40 - 50 years and female gender are considered risk factors for the severe form of hepatitis [ 15 ][ 66 ][ 67 ] .
enflurane , sevoflurane , and desflurane since the introduction of halothane , several halogenated anesthetics such as enflurane , desflurane , and sevoflurane have been developed .
post - exposure liver damage has been attributed to enflurane [ 50 ] .
based on the protein products of enflurane metabolism , it appears that cross - sensitization between halothane and enflurane is the likely cause of liver damage [ 45 ] .
nonetheless , the principal mechanism of liver damage following enflurane exposure is unknown [ 49 ][ 68 ] .
approximately 2 % of enflurane undergoes hepatic metabolism compared with 30 % of halothane [ 27 ] .
because hepatic metabolism , release of free radicals and the subsequent neo - antigen production constitute the likely mechanism of halogenated anesthetic - induced hepatotoxicity , enflurane appears to be less hepatotoxic compared with halothane .
sevoflurane , another member of the family , is rapidly metabolized , releasing fluoride into the serum [ 69 ] .
although sevoflurane is associated with liver metabolism ( 3 % to 5 %) , it does not affect tfa production , the likely cause of neo - antigen formation [ 27 ] .
sevoflurane is not associated with elevated transaminase levels [ 70 ] , but it decreases liver blood supply slightly in animals .
although this finding has not been demonstrated in humans , rendered it a safer compound compared with halothane [ 71 ] .
unlike sevoflurane , desflurane is metabolized in the liver to tfa .
this may induce protein modification [ 72 ] and immune responses , especially in patients who are sensitized to halothane , but the metabolism rate is low ( approximately 0.01 %) [ 27 ] .
hence , the risk of fatal post - desflurane hepatitis is low compared with other halogenated anesthetics .
however , few cases of hepatitis following desflurane might have been sensitized to halothane prior to desflurane exposure [ 47 ] .
the true expense of implementing new anesthetics and substituting halothane is not well documented .
these costs include the replacement of old anesthetic tools with newer methods of vaporizing agents and the higher price of new anesthetics .
the costs of training medical staff should also be included .
further , the number of patients who need to be managed with new agents to avoid one case of halothane - induced adverse effects must be determined , as should the cost of managing that adverse effect [ 14 ] .
such estimates should be assumed in developing countries that have low health care budgets and can hardly afford the high costs of substituting old technologies with newer and safer ones .
nevertheless , the rare incidence of halothane - induced hepatitis in patients without any risk factors complicates the decision .
a precise cost - benefit analysis must be performed in these countries before further action .
in the absence of large - scale national studies , expert panels might be invaluable in determining the incidence of side effects .
discussion halothane can cause lethal hepatitis in patients who undergo general anesthesia .
thus , the most effective means of protecting patients is to avoid exposure .
however , considering the high costs of implementing other drugs , especially in developing countries , and thfe rare occurrence of lethal diseases , halothane is the logical first option .
nonetheless , under special circumstances , as illustrated in table 1 [ 19 ] , when the probability of postexposure hepatitis is considerable , other anesthetics such as desflurane should be used .
table 1 contraindications for use of halothane , as defined by the iranian association of gastroenterology and hepatology contraindications ( halothane or other inhalational anesthetics are contraindicated ) halothane postexposure reaction history recurrent exposure history positive family history of postexposure reaction or halothane hepatitis high - risk patients ( halothane is not recommended in patients with 2 or more of these risk factors ) female gender age 40 years or more obesity ( bmi >= 28 ) positive history of liver enzymes , inducing drugs , such as phenobarbital none declared .
implication for health policy / practice / research / medical education : one of forgotten side effects of medications used for anesthesia is studied in the article .
the golden time of diagnosis and thinking the best way of prevention trigger each physician 's mind involved in the surgical method of treatment .
reading this article is recommended for all practitioners , anesthesiologists , and internists .
it also describes an important message from the view of health economic .

background the presence of functional 5 - ht4 receptors in human and its involvement in neonatal lupus erythematosus ( nle ) have prompted us to study the receptor expression and role during embryogenesis .
earlier we managed to demonstrate that female balb / c mice immunized against the second extracellular loop ( sel ) of the 5 - ht4 receptor gave birth to pups with heart block .
to explain this phenomenon we investigated the expression of 5 - ht4 receptors during mouse embryogenesis .
at the same time we looked whether the consequence of 5 - ht4 receptor immunomodulation observed earlier is in relation to receptor expression .
we studied the expression of 5 - ht4 receptor at the mrna level and its two isoforms 5 - ht4 ( a ) and 5 - ht4 ( d ) at the protein level in embryos from balb / c mice , at 8th , 12th , 18th gestation days ( gd ) and 1 day post natal ( dpn ) .
simultaneously the receptor activity was inhibited by rising antibodies , in female mice against sel of the receptor .
the mice were mated and embryos were collected at 8th , 12th , 18th gd and 1 dpn .
results 5 - ht4 receptor mrna increased in brain from 12th gd to 1 dpn .
its expression gradually decreased in heart and disappeared at birth .
this was consistent with expression of the receptor isoforms 5 - ht4 ( a ) and ( d ) .
abnormalities like decreased number of embryos , growth delay , spina bifida and sinus arrhythmia from 12th gd were documented in pups of mice showing anti - 5 - ht4 receptor antibodies .
conclusion serotoninergic 5 - ht4 receptor plays an important role in mouse foetal development .
in balb / c mice there is a direct relation between the expression of receptor and the deleterious effect of maternal anti - 5 - ht4 receptor autoantibodies in early embryogenesis .
background serotoninergic 5 - ht4 receptors belong to the family of 7 - membrane spanning receptors coupled to gs protein .
until now 10 different human isoforms have been cloned and sequenced ( h5 - ht4 ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) , ( f ) , ( g ) , ( hb ) , ( i ) and ( n )) [ 1 - 3 ] they are all coded by a complex gene ( 700 kb , 38 exons ) , which generates 9 carboxy - terminal variants issued from alternative splicing .
they have identical sequences up to leu358 , with the exception of h5 - ht4 ( hb ) , which is characterized by a 14 amino acid residues insertion within the receptor second extracellular loop ( sel ) of h5 - ht4 ( b ) [ 4 ] .
the presence of 5 - ht4 receptor has been reported in different tissues .
receptor mrna has been detected in brain , bladder , gastrointestinal tract , heart , kidney , pancreas and testis [ 3,5,6 ] .
in postmortem human brain studies the receptor , ignoring its different isoforms , was detected in the basal ganglion ( caudate nucleus , putamen , nucleus accumbens , globus pallidus and substantia nigra ) , in cortex and hippocampus ( ca1 and subiculum ) [ 7 ] .
in heart , mrna for different h5 - ht4 isoforms is mainly detected in atrium ( 5 - ht4 ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( g ) , ( i )) [ 3,5 ] .
the presence of four isoforms , mainly m5 - ht4 ( a ) , ( b ) , ( e ) , ( f ) has been described in mouse [ 8,9 ] .
although many studies have been performed to highlight the tissue distribution and functional activity of different isoforms of the receptor in adult human , rat and mouse , little is known about their expression and function during embryogenesis .
previously we have reported the involvement of 5 - ht4 receptor in congenital heart block ( chb ) associated to a systemic autoimmune response in the mother [ 10 ] .
in neonatal lupus erythematosus ( nle ) , autoantibodies against ribonucleoproteins 48 - kda ssb / la , 52 - kda ssa / ro ( ro52 ) and 60 - kda ssa / ro ( ro60 ) have received more attention , since they have been shown to be strongly associated with autoimmune responses involved in symptoms like chb [ 11 ] .
it has been postulated that the transfer of maternal anti - ro52 antibodies from mother to the fetus is responsible for the symptoms of nle .
in a previous study , we managed to induce nle symptoms in a mouse model [ 12 ] .
this has prompted us to further explore the expression of different 5 - ht4 receptor isoforms in balb / c mice during embryogenesis .
meanwhile , we searched for the period when anti - receptor antibodies could induce the observed abnormalities .
results and discussion 1 .
production of anti - peptide antibodies peptides derived from c - terminal ends of 5 - ht4 receptor isoforms ( y23f and carrier - c7f ) were highly immunogenic .
the anti - 5 - ht4 ( a ) and 5 - ht4 ( d ) antibodies were able to recognize both their homologue peptide in elisa .
the specificity of the recognition was tested by inhibition immunoassay ( figure 1 ) .
no cross - reactivity between the different anti - isoforms antibodies was detected in elisa ( data not shown ) .
the antibodies recognized their corresponding receptor isoforms in immunocytofluorescence performed on transfected cho cells ( figure 2 ) .
on transfected cho cells , anti - 5 - ht4 ( a ) antibodies were specific for their corresponding isoform while anti - 5 - ht4 ( d ) ones recognized 5 - ht4 ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) isoforms .

anti - 5 - ht4 ( a ) antibodies bind only their corresponding isoform , while anti - 5 - ht4 ( d ) binds all isoforms ( 5 - ht4 ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d )) .
no labelling was obtained with non - transfected cells .
2. expression of receptor isoforms embryos from 8 pregnant balb / c mice gestation days ( gd ) 8th , 12th , 16th , 18th , 20th and one day postnatal ( dpn ) were collected .
these were used to explore the expression of 5 - ht4 receptor isoforms both at the mrna ( rt - pcr ) and protein levels .
rt - pcr experiments revealed the increased expression of 5 - ht4 receptor isoforms from day 12 of gestation to day 1 postnatal in brain .
receptor mrna expression in the heart decreased gradually and disappeared at birth ( figure 3a ) .
the latter was confirmed at the protein level where the expression of both isoforms matched the expressed 5 - ht4 receptor mrna ( figure 3b and 3c ) .
in adult mouse brain we detected both anti - 5 - ht4 ( a ) and anti - 5 - ht4 ( d ) .
interestingly , the 5 - ht4 ( a ) receptor is absent in dentate gyrus of adult mouse hippocampus ( figure 3d ) .

immunolabelling is shown in the left panel and dapi nuclear coloration in the right one .
3. in vivo effect of anti - 5 - ht4 antibodies in order to highlight the role of 5 - ht4 receptor on normal development of the embryos , we sought to immunomodulate the activity of the receptor in balb / c mice embryos , through the passage of maternal anti - receptor antibodies induced with a peptide corresponding to the second extracellular loop of the 5 - ht4 receptor .
pregnant mice at 8th , 12th , 18th gd and one dpn were sacrificed and the embryos were counted and collected for morphological studies .
all female mice immunized with g21v developed high - titre anti - peptide antibodies .
serum from the mouse having a fetus with spina bifida , recognized the 5 - ht4 receptor by flow cytometry analyses performed on cho cells transfected with 5 - ht4 ( g ) receptor ( figure 4 ) .
the same antibodies did not recognize any expression protein on ch0 cells transfected with m2 muscarinic receptor .
although immunized mice were all pregnant between 4 to 8 days post - mating , no pups were delivered at 21st day post - fertility .
mice had to be mated more than three times over a period of 2 months for a successful pregnancy .
this was probably due to the presence of anti - 5 - ht4 receptor antibodies .
the fact that the female balb / c mice had circulating anti - peptide antibodies did not alter their fertility but jeopardized the normal development of embryos .
the latter was confirmed by the abnormal number of embryos collected at different periods of gestation .
in addition we have also observed and documented different symptoms such as growth delay , spina bifida , arrhythmia and ataxia , which all started from the 12th gestation day to 1 day pn ( table 1 and figure 5a , b ) .
control mice ( n = 5 ) gave birth to normal number of pups 21 days after the first mating ( 14 pups in total ) .
the number of fetus in different embryonic periods was also normal i.e. 7 embryo in average ( 20 fetus in total ) .
no abnormalities were observed neither in the embryos nor in the fetuses of the control did female mice , which were administer only cfa and mbsa .

the same antibodies showed no recognition of m2 muscarinic receptor expressed in cho cells ( lower figure ) .

morphological studies showed either growth delay or late development of foetal hindbrain at 12th gd ( figures 5a , 5b ) .
histological studies showed , besides the presence of spina bifida , delayed foetal neuronal differentiation in embryos from the mother with circulating anti - 5 - ht4 antibodies .
in the heart of the same embryo symmetric form of the heart was observed with pronounced hyperplasia and decreased fibroblast density ( figure 5b ) .
the latter was confirmed with decreased immunoreactivity for alpha - sma in the heart of the embryos from the mouse with circulating anti - 5 - ht4 antibodies ( figure 6a , 6b ) figure 6 ( a ) shows in heart decreased fibroblast immunoreactivity in fetus from a mouse with anti - 5 - ht4 antibodies .

represents the estimated immunoreactivity as measured by densitometry in heart tissues from control fetus and fetus from mouse with anti - 5 - ht4 antibodies ( expressed in absorbance unit / pixel area , au / px2 ) conclusion up to now there is no information on the distribution of the 5 - ht4 receptor isoforms at the protein level .
the fact that there are at least 10 different 5 - ht4 receptor isoforms and mrna expression in both central and peripheral organs , point to the importance of this family of receptors in the maintenance of normal cellular activity .
although 5 - ht4 receptor has been reported to be involved in memory and learning as well as gastrointestinal function , less or almost nothing is known about its role in embryogenesis .
the importance of the embryonic serotoninergic system in central nervous and cardiovascular functions has been largely described [ 15 - 20 ] .
in early mouse embryogenesis , maternal serotonin ( 5 - ht ) activates different 5 - ht receptors to control gene expression , migration and proliferation of neuronal crest and neuronal - crest derived cells [ 21 - 25 ] .
although there is enough evidence fortifying the 5 - ht hypothesis in embryogenesis , no major abnormalities were found in 5 - ht4 receptor knockout mice .
one has just observed an attenuated response to stress and novelty as well as hypersensitivity to seizures [ 31 ] .
there are many knockout and transgenic mouse models with such phenotypes .
for instance null mutation of alpha4 subunit nicotinic cholinergic receptor increases the susceptibility to proconvulsant - induced seizures [ 32 ] .
this is also the case for 5 - ht1a receptor , prion protein , superoxide dismutase , tumor necrosis factor - alpha [ 32 - 34 ] and many others .
blocking the expression of 5 - ht receptors using traditional knockout method gives rise to compensatory mechanism that occur during the constitutive deletion of the receptor throughout the lifespan of the animal .
furthermore , the inherent complexity in the pattern of expression and in the function of some genes and gene products contributes more to compensation and hidden developmental roles [ 35 ] .
on the contrary by using alternative methods like blocking the expression of the receptor in restricted periods of time one circumvents the compensations [ 32 ] .
the latter is also possible by modulating the protein activity at the cell membrane rather than blocking the function of the gene .
given the pathophysiological complexity of these conditions and involvement of many other factors one cannot explain these abnormal conditions with the lack of 5 - ht4 receptors .
one plausible explanation to the latter is the expanded variety of the 5 - ht receptor family .
loosing one receptor subtype or isoform probably leads to a compensation mechanism conducted by other members of the family here probably 5 - ht6 serotoninergic receptor .
the only 5 - ht receptor knockout with pathophysiological consequences is the 5 - ht2 ( b ) receptor .
5 - ht2 ( b ) receptor knockout mice embryos developed cardiac hypoplasia [ 24 ] .
the receptor 's importance in regulating cardiac activity was reported two years later [ 26 ] .
our group has shown in pups of balb / c mice that maternal anti - 5 - ht4 antibodies caused fetal cardiac hyperplasia and arrhythmia [ 12 ] .
in the central nervous system , 5 - ht4 receptor isoform mrnas were found in almost all brain structures .
however , up to now neither the receptor expression nor its function during the fetal period was studied .
in the first part of this study , we demonstrated the specificity of the anti - peptide antibodies for their corresponding peptide .
anti - 5ht4 ( a ) was specific for its isoform as it did not cross react with any of the other receptor isoforms tested , i.e. 5 - ht4 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) .
on the contrary , 5 - ht4 ( d ) antibodies , besides binding its corresponding peptide could also recognize all the other isoforms including 5 - ht4 ( a ) .
this was not due to a cross reactivity but to their specificity , since the c - terminal end of 5 - ht4 ( d ) is common between 5 - ht4 ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) .
we report here the presence of cardiac isoforms 5 - ht4 ( a ) in embryos from balb / c mice at gd 8th ( data not shown ) , 12th , 18th and one day postnatal .
since the anti - 5 - ht4 ( d ) antibodies are able to recognize other already mentioned isoforms , we can only be sure about the expression of 5 - ht4 ( a ) in the heart and brain. whether there are other isoforms expressed during embryogenesis remains elusive .
however 5 - ht4 ( a ) receptor was found both in fetal brain and heart .
both 5 - ht4 ( a ) and 5 - ht4 ( d ) receptor isoforms were expressed in brain , at 1 dp , but we could not detect any signal in the pups' heart for the two explored isoforms .
one remains , however , puzzled of the receptor 's disappearance at 1 dp. this could be explained by the progressive appearance of adrenergic receptors .
indeed , both alpha - and beta - adrenergic receptors are already detected at 12th gd , and , contrary to 5 - ht4 receptor , activity of beta - adrenergic receptor in mouse heart increases significantly until birth [ 27 ] .
in the second part of our study , we observed that all female balb / c mice immunized with peptide derived from the second extracellular loop of 5 - ht4 receptor developed anti - peptide antibodies that could recognize membranes from 5 - ht4 ( g ) transfected cho cells .
although the mice were all fertile , they had to be mated several times before developing a successful pregnancy .
all mice in the control group gave birth 21 days post mating .
in immunized mice , the number of pups for the first pregnancy was between 5 and 7 , which was similar to the control group .
however , the number of fetuses of immunized mice decreased from 12th to 18th gd ( 7 to 2 , respectively ) .
this was in accordance with the titer of circulating antibodies in the mothers .
the latter was also observed in two littermates , where one mouse gave birth to 2 and the other to 6 pups .
here we observed again that the titer of circulating antibodies for the mother with just two pups was 7 times higher than the mouse with 6 pups .
in this study , we demonstrated that 5 - ht4 receptors are expressed already at the 8th gd ( in ectoderm ) , at least for the 5 - ht4 ( a ) isoform .
we also provided evidence for the functionality of the anti - receptor antibodies , since 1 ) they decreased fertility as shown by the increased number of mating for a successful litter , 2 ) they decreased the number of fetuses and pups in relation with the titer of circulating antibodies , 3 ) they induced morphological and functional abnormalities both in peripheral and central organs .
in our earlier study [ 12 ] we demonstrated that anti - 5 - ht4 antibodies passively transferred from mother to the pups could induce atrioventricular block type i and ii ( avb ) , tremor and skin lesions .
here we confirmed the presence of malformation in some cases and could correlate its incidence with the expression of the receptor and titre of the anti - receptor antibodies .
this means that at high concentration of transferred anti - receptor antibodies the chance of malformation is considerably higher , since 21 - days post mating either the number of pups decreased or no labour was issued .
the effect of anti - 5 - ht4 antibodies could be through their binding to at least 5 - ht4 ( a ) receptor isoform , since it is already expressed from 8th gd. it has been shown that antibodies against the second extracellular loop of the receptor block the effect of serotonin in human cardiomyocytes [ 10,28 ] .
in embryonic heart muscle expression of vascular alpha - actin has been demonstrated .
alpha - actin acts as a precursor in immature contractile structures , when the embryonic heart just starts to beat , and might only gradually be replaced by the mature cardiac isoform [ 35 - 37 ] .
for this reason we used alpha - smooth muscle actin as a marker for heart development .
our observation that myocardium of mouse fetus with circulating maternal anti - 5 - ht4 antibodies has less or no immunoreactivity for alpha - actin smooth muscle could be due to delayed maturation of fetal myocardium in immunized animals .
however although the presences of anti - ro52 autoantibodies cross reacting with sel of 5 - ht4 receptors shows a good correlation with the prevalence for neonatal lupus their pathogenic role cannot be generalized .
we have shown this in our previous work [ 38 ] .
this could be due to at one hand that the tested sera were from pretreated pregnant women with lupus .
in no studies yet published the blood samples are collected following the same period of pregnancy .
beside the important fluctuation of circulating autoantibodies makes the exploration even harder .
on the other hand we do n't have any idea about the expression of the 5 - ht4 receptor during human embryogenesis .
therefore we cannot draw any general conclusion .
in mice ( balb / c ) with no known autoimmune genetic background , therefore requiring no treatment , only the presence of 5 - ht4 receptor antibodies induced anomalies in fetus , which coincide with the receptor expression .
here we could postulate that the sel of 5 - ht4 receptor could be a pathogenic target for autoantibodies although the effect of the antibodies seems to be through the inhibition of the serotonin signal we however have no evidence for its cellular mechanism .
finally , we also show that immunomodulation of 5 - ht4 receptor activity , during embryogenesis , is an honorable alternative to the gene knockout technique .
since the receptor is already expressed and functional , modulating or inhibiting its activity will not activate any genetically compensatory mechanism .
therefore , its activity and physiological role can be explored independently .
taken together , our results demonstrate that 5 - ht4 receptors are crucial for embryonic development of the cardiovascular and central nervous systems in balb / c mice .
coincidence of anti - receptor antibodies and expression of 5 - ht4 receptor results in anatomical abnormalities .
further studies are needed to highlight the function of different receptor isoforms during embryogenesis .
methods 1 .
animals female adult rabbits ( n = 4 ) , female ( n = 15 ) and male ( n = 16 ) balb / c mice were purchased from janvier ( tours , france ) .
the animals were kept on a 12:12 - h light - dark cycle ( lights on at 6:00 am ) at 21 +/ - 1degreesc ambient temperature .
water and food were available ad libitum throughout the experiments .
2. peptides a peptide corresponding to the second extracellular loop of h5 - ht4 receptor ( g21v ) [ 10,9 ] , two other peptides corresponding to c - terminal ends of the 5 - ht4 isoforms h5 - ht4 ( a ) ( y23f ) and h5 - ht4 ( d ) ( c7f ) were synthesized as previously described ( table 2 ) [ 10,29 ] .
their structure and purity were checked by mass - spectrometry and hplc .
3. induction of anti - peptide antibodies eight female adult rabbits ( 2.5 - 2.7 kg ) were immunized with either y23f or c7f peptides .
four female rabbits were immunized with 200 mug of peptide y23f with 1 mg of mbsa .
prime injections were given in cfa .
the peptide c7f was conjugated to bsa using sba prior to administration to other four rabbits .
the peptide was coupled according to the following procedure .
all sulphydryl groups on bsa ( 4 mg ) were blocked with 0.5 m iodoacetamide in a coupling buffer ( ph = 7 ) composed of k2hpo4 ( 100 mm ) , edta ( 1 mm ) and sodium azide ( 0.02 %) .
the mixture was dialyzed 3 times 1 liter , against the coupling buffer without sodium azide .
thereafter 30 mg ( 0.13 mmol ) of sba was added to 4 mg of saturated bsa in the presence of 0.25 ml of dimethylformamide and diluted with coupling buffer to the final volume of 3 ml. sba conjugated bsa was separated from the unconjugated ones on a g - 25 sephadex column ( 2.2 x 27 cm ) and dialyzed against coupling buffer ( 3 times 1 liter ) .
finally 3.4 mg / ml of activated bsa molecule was mixed with 1.6 mg of c7f peptide .
it was then dialyzed against the coupling buffer and stored at - 20degreesc .
rabbits were immunized with an equivalent of 200 mug of bsa conjugated c7f in presence of cfa .
thereafter rabbits received 3 booster injections with three weeks interval where cfa was replaced with incomplete freund adjuvant ( ifa ) .
they were bled and the presence of anti - peptide antibodies was checked .
female balb / c mice ( n = 5 ) were immunized with 15 mug / mouse of peptide g21v together with 100 mug / mouse mbsa supplemented with pbs / cfa ( 50 % v / v ) .
two booster injections were thereafter administered with 3 weeks intervals , where cfa was replaced with ifa .
control mice ( n = 5 ) received just cfa and ifa .
mice were bled one week after each booster injection and sera were tested for the presence of the anti - peptide antibodies .
4. affinity purification y23f was fixed on carboxyl activated ech sepharose beads ( amersham pharmacia , sweden ) , and c7f or g21v peptides were fixed on thiol activated sepharose beads ( amersham pharmacia , sweden ) according to the standard procedures .
immunoglobulins from the immunized rabbit sera as well as lupus patient plasmaphereses with positive activity on g21v peptide in elisa , were precipitated with 33 % saturated ammonium sulfate and extensively dialyzed over night against pbs .
immunoglobulins were thereafter diluted 10 - 15 times with filtered pbs , before passing through the affinity columns at 4degreesc for 3 h. after wash out , the anti - peptide polyclonal antibodies were eluted with 3 m kscn and dialyzed immediately against 6 liters pbs at 4degreesc overnight .
5. enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) microtitre plates ( falcon , canada ) were coated with 5 mug / ml of peptide ( 50mul / well ) in coating buffer ( carbonate buffer 0.1 m , ph = 9.6 ) for 1 h at 37degreesc .
after saturation with 1 % bsa in pbs supplemented with 0.1 % tween 20 ( blocking buffer ) , the plates were incubated with increasing dilutions ( 10 - 2 to 10 - 6 ) of sera from immunized and control rabbits for 1 h at 37degreesc .
after several washes with pbs - tween , the plates were allowed to react with affinity - purified goat anti - rabbit igg , fc fragment specific antibodies conjugated to horse - radish peroxidase for 1 h and revealed with 3,3 ' , 5,5 ' - tetramethyl benzidine in the presence of h2o2 .
reaction was stopped with 1 n hcl and absorbance was read at 450 nm in a microplate reader .
inhibition immunoassay was performed as previously described [ 9 ] .
before using affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti - 5 - ht4a and d antibodies in elisa as described above , the antibodies were diluted 1 / 12800 in blocking buffer and incubated with decreasing concentrations ( 10 - 0.04 mug / ml ) of either y23f or c7f respectively for 1 h at 37degreesc .
6. cell culture and transfection non - transfected cho cells were cultivated in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) ( sigma aldrich ) supplemented with 10 % bovine fetal serum ( bfs ) , 100 u / ml penicillin , 100 mug / ml streptomycin .
the cells were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37degreesc under an atmosphere of 5 % co2 .
semi - confluent cho cells were transfected as previously described by [ 30 ] .
briefly , transfection was performed using a mixture of the vector polyethyleneimine ( pei ) and plasmids corresponding to h5 - ht4 receptor isoforms ( a ) or ( d ) at a ratio of 20 nm pei / mg of dna .
the cells were incubated for 5 h at 37degreesc with serum free dmem supplemented with 100 u / ml penicillin , 100 mug / ml streptomycin .
this was followed by incubation in bfs supplemented medium for 24 h .

affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti - g21v ( 1 / 500 ) , mouse sera ( 1 / 100 ) and affinity purified anti - g21v ( 1 / 50 ) from a lupus patient were incubated with the cells for 1 h in normal culture condition .
cells were washed 3 times with dmem .
they were then incubated with either fitc - conjugated goat anti - rabbit or fitc - conjugated goat anti - mouse or biotinylated goat anti - human antibodies in dmem supplemented with 1 % goat sera for 1 h in normal culture conditions .
after 3 washes only tubes treated with anti - human antibodies were further incubated with fitc - conjugated streptavidin for 30 min in normal culture conditions .
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry with a facscalibur ( r ) . at least 10,000 events were acquired for each experiment using the cellquest 3.3 software ( becton dickinson , pont de claix , france ) .
the data were processed with the same program using analyses option .
9. reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) and southern blot balb / c mice ( n = 8 ) were mated and the fetuses were collected at 8th , 12th , 16th 18th , 20th gd and 1 dpn. from the same litter , half of fetus was used for rt - pcr and the other half was frozen down for immunohistochemistry ( see below ) .
total rna was prepared from mouse tissues using the trizol rna purification system ( life technologies inc. ) .
after purification , rna was treated with dnase i ( life technologies inc. ) and 5 mug of total rna was then hybridized with oligo ( dt ) primer and reverse transcribed using superscript reverse transcriptase ii ( life technologies inc. ) .
the resulting single strand cdnas were used as templates in pcr reactions using a specific primer pair for the m5 - ht4r ( 5 ' - cctgtgctgtatttccctgg - 3 ' ; 5 ' - gaatggggggtcttttgtag - 3 ') .
this primer couple selective of the common part of mouse 5 - ht4 receptor isoform allows the amplification of a single dna band migrating at 688 bp ( base pair ) .
the sequence of beta - actin primers has been previously described [ 5 ] .
pcr reactions were performed using the following cycle conditions : denaturation for 1 min at 94degreesc , annealing for 30 s at 55degreesc , and extension for 1 min 30 sec at 72degreesc with a final extension step for 8 min at 72degreesc .
the pcr products were electrophoresed on 1.5 % agarose gel containing 0.01 % ethidium bromide and photographed under u.v. irradiation .
for southern blot , pcr products were transferred to zetaprobe membrane ( biorad ) .
the following primer 5 ' - aggatgatgaggaaggcacg - 3 ' was labeled with 32p using the random primer dna labeling kit ( life technologies inc. ) , and used as an internal probe for hybridization .
hybridization was performed at 57degreesc for 12 h in a church buffer ( 0.5 m nahpo4 ph 7.2 , 1 mm edta , 7 % sds ) containing 100 mug / ml of denatured salmon sperm dna .
the membrane was revealed using a phosphoimager ( storm , molecular dynamics ) .
10. immunofluorescence and histochemistry frozen fetuses 12th 18th gd , pups and adult brains were subjected to serial cuts at 5 - mum thickness , using a leica cryostat .
after fixing the tissues with 1 % paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature , they were permeabilized in pbs at ph 7.4 , supplemented with 0.1 % triton - x for 3 min .
the tissue was saturated with blocking buffer ( pbs , 1 % bsa , 0.1 % tween ) for 1 h at room temperature .
affinity purified anti - peptide antibodies corresponding to each isoform were incubated for 2 h ( 1 / 200 ) .
after three washes in pbs , the tissues were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with alexa fluor 594 goat anti - rabbit igg ( h + l ) ( 1 / 500 ) and visualized under a leica epifluorescence microscope and photographed .
fetuses at 12th gd were collected and fixed overnight in 4 % formaldehyde / pbs solution .
they were then dehydrated according to the standard procedures .
paraffin embedded fetuses were cut on the sagital axis at 4 mum mounted on superfrost plus slides .
they were then dried over night at 57degreesc .
sections were rehydrated and saturated for 1 h in tbs - tween 0.1 % supplemented with 1 % goat sera .
slides were thereafter incubated with anti - actin , alpha smooth muscle ( alpha - asm ) mouse monoclonal ( sigma - aldrich st louis ) .
after three washes vectastain abc kit goat anti - mouse immunoglobulins ( vector laboratories , burlingame , ca ) was used according to the manufacturer recommendations .
finally after extensive washes ( 5 times in tbs tween ) the bound antibodies were revealed using dab chromogen kit ( dakocystomation , carpinteria , ca ) .
the slides were counter stained with hematoxylin for 20 sec and washed for 15 min under demineralized water .
they were then dehydrated and mounted according to the standard procedures .
the immunoreactivity in fetal heart was quantified in gray scale using macbas densitometry program on 5 serial slices and 10 different regions for each slide .

however , the comparative roles of each ckd - mbd biomarker remained undetermined on long - term peritoneal dialysis ( pd ) patients .
this retrospective study , employing a population - based database , aimed to evaluate the performance and provide the best evidence of each biomarker of ckd - mbd as predictor of all - cause mortality .
throughout the 8 - year study period , total 12,116 pd patients were included in this study .
cox proportional regression and kaplan - meier method were used for survival analysis .
for cox regression model , baseline measurements and time - varying covariates were used for analysis .
in cox regression model using time - dependent covariates , serum calcium level of >= 9.5 mg / dl was associated with increased mortality .
for phosphorus , serum levels of either >= 6.5 mg / dl or < 3.5 mg / dl were associated with increased mortality .
for parathyroid hormone ( pth ) , higher serum levels were not associated increased mortality .
for alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) , mortality increased at levels >= 100 iu / l. our findings suggested that the detrimental effect of alp on survival was more consistent , while serum calcium , phosphorus and pth may have a less prominent effect on mortality .
this study provided additional information for manipulating ckd - mbd biomarkers in pd patients .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction in the last two decades , numerous studies have provided evidence that biochemical changes in chronic kidney disease - mineral and bone disorder ( ckd - mbd ) are associated with survival outcomes in dialysis patients .
observational studies have demonstrated that adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in dialysis patients are associated with high levels of serum phosphorus1 - 8 and calcium1 - 5 , parathyroid hormone ( pth ) levels either higher3 - 7 or lower9 , 10 than the target range , and elevated alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) levels11 - 13 .
these findings have contributed significantly to the widely accepted kidney disease improving global outcomes ( kdigo ) clinical practice guidelines for ckd - mbd14 , 15 .
while the majority of studies focusing on ckd - mbd in dialysis patients involved haemodialysis ( hd ) patients , relatively few studies involving peritoneal dialysis ( pd ) patients have been published16 , 17 .
recently , several studies have revealed that an association between alp level and mortality also exists in pd patients18 - 20 .
these studies form the basis for the current management of ckd - mbd in pd patients .
nonetheless , the amount of evidence supporting the management of ckd - mbd in pd patients remains relatively small compared to that for hd patients .
thus , a comprehensive , large - scaled study focusing on ckd - mbd in pd patients would be help to improve our understanding in this field .
in practice , adherence to every recommendation for ckd - mbd in a single dialysis patient is not always feasible .
for example , the use of calcitriol to suppress the pth level may result in an adverse elevation of serum calcium and phosphorus levels .
in addition , use of a calcium - based phosphate binder may inappropriately increase calcium load and serum calcium level .
as such , providing optimal treatment for each dialysis patient is difficult , particularly as the relative role of each ckd - mbd biomarker has not yet been determined .
therefore , the aims of the present study were to evaluate the effect of each ckd - mbd biomarker , namely , serum calcium , phosphorus , pth and alp , on all - cause mortality , and to compare the performance of these biomarkers in predicting mortality in a taiwanese pd population .
to that end , we conducted a nationwide , population - based analysis using a database established by the taiwan renal registry data system ( twrds ) .
subjects and methods this study was approved by the ethics committee of taipei medical university - institutional review board ( number : 20141017 ) and was carried out in accordance with the declaration of helsinki of 1975 , as revised in 2000 .
the requirement for written informed consent was waived by the review board .
the twrds was established in 1987 for the purpose of the accreditation and quality - monitoring of dialysis units .
all dialysis units in taiwan are obligated to provide the twrds with appropriate information on a quarterly basis to obtain reimbursement from the national health insurance .
in 1996 , data collection was computerized , and in 1997 , additional information , including comorbidities , rehabilitation status , indices of dialysis adequacy and mineral and bone metabolism , and serologic markers of viral hepatitis were included .
the data maintained by the twrds provide not only a robust foundation for comprehensive monitoring of the dialysis quality at a national level , but are also an important resource for population - based epidemiologic research21 - 24 .
study population the investigated population consisted of 12,966 patients on pd from all 117 pd units across taiwan , who were registered in the twrds between 2005 and 2012 .
among the total 12,966 patients in the registry data , 8,514 patients remained on pd , while 3,577 patients shifted to hd and 875 patients received kidney transplantation by the end of 2012. of these three groups , patients who remained on pd were older ; patients who shifted to hd included more diabetics , and had longer pd vintage , higher serum alp concentration , and renal creatinine clearance ; and patients who received a kidney transplant included more men and had higher serum albumin , calcium , phosphorus , and pth concentrations ( table 1 ) .
among the entire pd population in the registry data , patients with missing pth values were excluded from analysis as logical imputation was not feasible ( n = 850 ) .
finally , 12,116 patients were included in the current statistical analysis .
patients who remained on pd were followed until mortality or the end of the study , while those who switched to hd or received kidney transplantation were censored .

study outcome and predictors the main outcome was all - cause mortality , which was defined as loss from registration in the twrds .
this definition was based on the complete , nationwide coverage of renal replacement treatment expenditure provided by the national health insurance policy .
serum concentrations for calcium , phosphorus , pth , and alp were analysed as potential predictors of mortality .
the measuring and monitoring of these laboratory data were specified strictly by the twrds .
serum calcium and phosphorus levels were measured monthly and reported to the twrds every 3 months .
serum total calcium was corrected using the following formula : corrected calcium = ( 0.8 x [ normal albumin level - exact albumin level ]) + measured serum calcium .
pth was measured and reported to the twrds every 3 months .
the majority of pth tests across hospitals in taiwan ( 97.9 %) were performed by the union clinical laboratory , where the second - generation pth chemiluminescence assay advia centaur ( siemens healthcare diagnostics , tarrytown , ny ) has been employed since 2007 ( reference range , 14 - 72 pg / ml ) .
compared with the second - generation intact pth allegro nichols irma suggested by the kdigo guidelines in 2009 , this commercial assay exhibited variation of 60 - 152 % 25 .
total alp was reported every 3 months as specified by the twrds , which was tested using the modified international federation of clinical chemistry advia 1800 ( siemens healthcare diagnostics , tarrytown , ny ) .
statistical analysis descriptive statistics are expressed as mean +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) or as frequencies ( percentages ) .
time - averaged values of biochemical and hematologic parameters were used for descriptive statistics .
the time - averaged values were defined as the average values across the entire registry .
significance was evaluated using one - way analyses of variance ( anova ) or chi - square tests , as appropriate .
a cox proportional regression model and kaplan - meier method were performed with mortality as the outcome , censoring patients who shifted to hd or received a kidney transplant .
for the kaplan - meier analyses , baseline data were used and the significance of survival differences was evaluated using the log - rank test .
multiple comparisons of kaplan - meier curves were conducted with sidak correction .
the baseline values were defined as the average value in the first year in the registry .
to build the multivariate cox regression model , all potential predictor variables were evaluated for association to mortality using the univariate cox regression method .
the serum concentrations of calcium , phosphorus , pth , and alp were considered as potential predictors .
the pre - defined criteria for inclusion in the multivariate cox regression model consisted of a univariate p - value < 0.2 .
in addition , all continuous variables were evaluated for collinearity by calculating the pearson correlation coefficient .
to reveal a potential non - linear association of predictors with mortality , a multivariate cox regression model with the potential predictors represented as categorical variables was performed .
considering the u - shape association between pth and mortality recently reported by rhee et al.20 and the reference range provided in the kdigo guidelines14 , pth values were categorized into 5 groups (< 50 , 50 - 150 , 150 - 300 , 300 - 600 , and >= 600 pg / ml ) .
similarly , calcium values were categorized into 4 groups (< 8.5 , 8.5 - 9.5 , 9.5 - 10.5 , and >= 10.5 mg / dl ) and phosphorus values were categorized into 6 groups (< 3.5 , 3.5 - 5.5 , 5.5 - 6.5 , 6.5 - 7.5 , 7.5 - 8.5 , and >= 8.5 mg / dl ) .
in a large - scale study conducted in patients on pd by rhee et al.20 , the risk of mortality increased at an alp level >= 150 iu / l. therefore , alp values were classified into 4 groups (< 50 , 50 - 100 , 100 - 150 , and >= 150 iu / l ) .
as described previously , patients with missing pth values were excluded from the study population .
for missing values in descriptive statistics , the available data were used .
for survival analysis , patients with missing values for variables used in the regression model were excluded from the respective analysis .
in addition to the cox regression model using baseline data , time - dependent analyses were performed .
in time - dependent analyses , calcium , phosphorus , pth , and alp were used as time - dependent covariates .
each time - dependent covariate was updated every 3 months .
missing values for time - dependent covariates were imputed by the last value carried forward method .
however , patients with missing baseline values were excluded from time - dependent analyses as logical imputation was not feasible .
all statistical analyses were performed using spss , version 17.0 .
( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) and sas , version 9.1 ( sas institute , cary , nc , usa ) .
results cohort description for the 12,116 included patients , the mean age was 52 +/ - 16 years and the mean pd vintage was 3.9 +/ - 2.5 years .
at the end of the 8 - year study period , 3,036 ( 25 %) patients were deceased .
among the included patients , higher pth concentration was associated with younger age , and fewer male and diabetic patients .
mortality and pd vintage were significantly different among pth groups .
the pth < 150 pg / ml group showed the highest mortality while the pth 300 - 600 pg / ml group showed the longest pd vintage .
the pth >= 600 pg / ml group was associated with lower haemoglobin , higher phosphorus , higher alp , and higher kt / v. according to the kdigo practice guidelines26 , the haemoglobin level of patients in the pth >= 600 pg / ml group was lower than normal , while the serum phosphorus level in all groups was higher than normal (> 5.0 mg / dl ) 14 .
all groups had weekly kt / v values that met the recommended dose (> 1.7 per week ) ( table 2 ) .

survival analysis univariate cox proportional regression analyses showed that age , sex , diabetic status , weekly kt / v , renal creatinine clearance , albumin , and haemoglobin , along with our presumed predictors ( calcium , phosphorus , pth , and alp ) , were significantly associated with mortality ( p < 0.2 , supplementary table 1 ) .
all continuous variables were found to be weakly correlated ( 0.2 < | r | <= 0.5 ) or uncorrelated (| r | <= 0.2 ) with each other and were included in the multivariate cox regression model ( supplementary table 2 ) .
in the multivariate cox regression model , increased age was associated with increased mortality while higher weekly kt / v and albumin level were associated reduced mortality .
diabetes status and haemoglobin concentration were not associated with the hazard ratio of mortality .
in contrast to the general expectation , higher renal creatinine clearance was associated with increased mortality. of note , renal creatinine clearance was not included in the time - dependent analysis due to a large number of missing baseline values ( n = 1,879 ) .
the majority of the findings were consistent whether using baseline data or time - dependent covariates ; however , male sex was associated with increased mortality only in the time - dependent analysis ( table 3 ) .
additionally , in the time - dependent analysis , serum calcium levels >= 9.5 mg / dl exhibited higher mortality .
in contrast , in the analysis using baseline data , calcium levels either higher or lower than the normal range ( 8.5 - 10.5 mg / dl ) were not consistently associated with increased mortality ( fig. 1a ) .
furthermore , in the time - dependent analysis , higher serum phosphorus was found to be positively associated with mortality at >= 7.5 mg / dl , while higher serum phosphorus levels were not associated with increased mortality in the analysis using baseline data .
in contrast , serum phosphorus levels < 3.5 mg / dl were consistently associated higher mortality in both baseline and time - dependent analyses ( fig. 1b ) .

discussion in the present study , the kaplan - meier curves and cox proportional models using baseline data and time - dependent covariates demonstrated inconsistent effects of serum calcium and phosphorus on mortality in pd patients .
however , since models using time - varying explanatory variables are in general more robust , several trends can be summarized from our findings as follows : 1 ) a higher serum calcium level was associated with increased mortality .
2 ) serum phosphorus level >= 6.5 mg / dl or < 3.5 mg / dl were associated with increased mortality .
3 ) a higher serum pth level was not associated with increased mortality .
4 ) a higher serum alp level was associated with increased mortality with a cut - off value of 100 - 150 iu / l. in the present study , the association between ckd - mbd biomarkers and all - cause mortality was inconsistent between statistical models using baseline measurements or time - varying covariates .
this suggests that in a cohort study with a long follow - up period , the use of baseline measurements as predictors in statistical models overlooks important fluctuations in the predictor variables across the study period .
accordingly , in a registration - based study with repeated measurements , time - dependent analyses theoretically provide a more appropriate evaluation of the association between the time - varying covariates and outcomes .
the majority of observational studies conducted in hd patients have shown that serum phosphorus and calcium levels either higher or lower than the normal limits are associated with a higher risk of mortality , depicting u - shaped relationships27 - 31 .
noordij et al.17 , in a prospective cohort study involving 586 pd patients , demonstrated that serum phosphorus levels higher than the normal upper limit , but not abnormal calcium or pth levels , were associated with increased mortality .
similarly , in another prospective cohort study involving 515 dialysis patients ( including 158 pd patients ) conducted by stevens et al.16 , only serum phosphorus ( not calcium or pth ) showed significant association with mortality .
in the present study , conducted exclusively in pd patients , time - dependent analyses showed that serum calcium levels >= 9.5 mg / dl , but not hypocalcemia , was significantly associated with increased mortality .
this suggests a deleterious effect of higher serum calcium levels on the survival of patients on pd. in addition , the results of the present study showed that the effect of serum phosphorus on mortality depicted a u - shaped relationship .
while the time - dependent analysis showed increased mortality with serum phosphorus levels >= 6.5 mg / dl , phosphorus levels < 3.5 mg / dl were consistently associated with increased mortality in statistical models using either baseline or time - varying variables .
this may suggest that malnutrition has a strong detrimental effect in patients on pd , regardless of its duration .
the relationship between pth and mortality in dialysis patients has also been inconsistent across multiple studies .
while some studies have shown that higher pth is associated with decreased risk of mortality3 - 7 , 9 , others have conversely suggested an increased risk of mortality10 , 32 .
in addition , several studies have shown a u - shaped relationship5 , 27 - 29 , 31 or no significant association1 , 2 , 8 , 33 between pth and mortality .
in a prospective study , which included 277 pd patients , avram et al.32 demonstrated that lower pth is associated with increased mortality .
however , they considered pth as a continuous variable ; thus , a non - linear association may have been overlooked .
more recently , rhee et al.20 conducted a retrospective cohort study enrolling 9,244 patients on pd which evaluated the impact of pth and alp on mortality .
in their study , pth had a u - shaped association with mortality , with a concentration of 200 - 700 pg / ml exhibiting the lowest mortality and a concentration < 100 pg / ml exhibiting the highest mortality .
partly in line with these results , the present study showed that a higher pth level was not associated with increased mortality in pd patients .
however , a u - shaped association of pth to mortality in patients on pd was not demonstrated in the present study .
recently , evidence that the serum alp levels are associated with adverse outcomes for dialysis patients , including cardiac failure11 , 12 , renal osteodystrophy34 - 36 , and mortality has been accumulating20 , 37 , 38 .
these findings suggest that alp might be a valuable parameter in the treatment of ckd - mbd in dialysis patients .
in rhee et al.20 , higher alp in patients on pd was associated with increased mortality in a binary fashion , with a cut - off value of >= 150 iu / l. the results of the present study showed a similar trend , supporting the role of alp as a predictor of mortality in patients on pd. considering the results for pth and alp , our study revealed similar findings to the work of rhee et al.20 , which was another large - scaled , retrospective cohort study in patients on pd. however , the race and ethnicity of the subjects in this previous study consisted mainly of white , black , and hispanic .
in contrast , the present study is comprised of exclusively asian people , and therefore , the present study extends the generalisation of these findings to a wider racial spectrum .
the multivariate cox regression model paradoxically demonstrated that renal creatinine clearance was associated with increased mortality .
one explanation to this phenomenon is that this study started with a cross - sectional cohort ; thus , the status and duration of dialysis before the onset of the registry was not available .
possibly , the patients with lower renal creatinine clearance represented those who had longer dialysis vintage and who were more stable patients .
this may have led to a bias .
another explanation is that , as reported recently , urinary creatinine clearance is prone to falsely overestimate glomerular filtration rate in patients with renal impairment and is less reliable in patients with end - stage kidney disease39 .
in addition , since renal creatinine clearance was calculated as the filtered creatinine per minute divided by serum creatinine concentration , patients with malnutrition and lower muscle mass may have exhibited lower serum creatinine levels and therefore , higher renal creatinine clearance .
this may also be an explanation for the unexpected finding in the present study .
there were a number of limitations in the present study .
one limitation is that the study started with a cross - sectional cohort ; therefore , patients who switched from hd to pd before the beginning of the registry were also included , which may have affected the results .
the outcome of the current study , all - cause mortality , was defined as loss from registration in twrds .
however , this definition was not cross - referenced with national vital statistics and might over - estimate the actual mortality .
other limitations include that only total alp , not bone - specific alp was available , and that the pth assay used was a second generation assay with high cross - reactivity to inactive pth fragments .
in addition , the actual medical records of each individual were not available ; therefore , information about cardiovascular diseases and other comorbidities , medication , dialysate calcium concentration , and the cause of mortality were absent from our data .
however , the main strengths of this study include the use of a large , population - based database with nationwide coverage of pd patients in taiwan with laboratory data that was strictly specified and measured , and the use of time - dependent variables in the statistical analyses .
it has been argued that features of ckd - mbd differ between patients undergoing pd and hd in that a dynamic bone disease was more frequent , and bone microarchitecture was less affected , in patients on pd40 , 41 ; nevertheless , studies comparing the effects of ckd - mbd biomarkers to mortality in patients on pd and hd remain limited .
currently , the kdigo does not recommend specific guidelines on the management of ckd - mbd for patients on pd or hd. a recent nationwide , registry - based study conducted with patients on hd in taiwan found the following : 1 ) higher alp level was associated with increased mortality in a binary fashion , with a cut - off value of >= 100 iu / l ; 2 ) a pth level < 100 pg / ml was associated increased mortality , while higher pth levels not being associated with increased mortality ; and 3 ) both serum calcium and phosphorus were associated with mortality in a u - shaped fashion , with the nadir located at 9.5 - 10.5 mg / dl and 5.5 - 6.5 mg / dl , respectively42 .
the u - shaped associations for serum calcium and phosphorus with regard to mortality reported in the work by lin et al. , are in line with most observational studies conducted with patients on hd27 - 31 .
while an association between serum phosphorus and mortality has been inconsistently reported across multiple studies conducted with patients on pd , several studies have reported no effects of serum calcium and pth on mortality16 , 17 .
in another large - scaled retrospective cohort study conducted with hd patients in the u.s.a. , higher alp level was associated with increased mortality in a binary fashion with a cut - off at >= 120 iu / l43 .
comparing these hd - related findings to the present study , it is possible that in the pd population , serum calcium and phosphorus may have a less prominent effect on mortality , while alp has a more consistent effect on mortality .
in addition , several recent studies have shown that in both patients on hd and pd , higher pth levels did not increase mortality .
however , the evidence to date remains insufficient to provide recommendations specifically for pd patients .
we expect that further research on ckd - mbd in pd patients could contribute to a practice guideline being developed specifically for this population in the future .

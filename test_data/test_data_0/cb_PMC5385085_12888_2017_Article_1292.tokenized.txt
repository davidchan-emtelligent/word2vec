background the rehabilitation of depressed stroke patients is more difficult because poststroke depression is associated with disruption of daily activities , functioning , and quality of life .
however , research on depression in stroke patients is limited .
the aim of our study was to evaluate the interaction of demographic characteristics including gender , age , education level , the presence of a spouse , and income status on depressive symptoms in stroke patients and to identify groups that may need more attention with respect to depressive symptoms .
methods we completed a secondary data analysis using data from a completed cross - sectional study of people with stroke .
depression was measured using the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale .
results in this study , depressive symptoms in women living with a spouse were less severe than among those without a spouse .
for those with insufficient income , depressive symptom scores were higher in the above high school group than in the below high school group , but were lower in patients who were living with a spouse than in those living without a spouse .
conclusion assessing depressive symptoms after stroke should consider the interaction of gender , economic status , education level , and the presence / absence of a spouse .
these results would help in comprehensive understanding of the importance of screening for and treating depressive symptoms during rehabilitation after stroke .
keywords depression demographic characteristic moderating effect stroke issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background depression is reportedly the most common mental disorder following stroke [ 1 - 4 ] , with an incidence ranging from 10 to 64 % [ 4 - 6 ] .
poststroke depression has an adverse effect on functional recovery and increases the mortality rate [ 7 ] .
furthermore , the rehabilitation of depressed stroke patients is more difficult because poststroke depression is associated with disruption of daily activities , function , and quality of life [ 8 , 9 ] .
depressive symptoms may be a psychological consequence of low levels of physical functioning and different life experiences after a stroke [ 10 ] .
indeed , one study found that there was no significant association between depression levels and the pathological development of stroke such as type of stroke , side of stroke , and comorbidity [ 10 ] .
furthermore , a study on comorbidity and primary care costs found that depression was a stroke comorbidity associated with increased costs [ 11 ] .
demographic characteristics are one of factors that affect depressive symptoms in stroke patients .
a meta - analysis in stroke patients reported that education level , income , and age showed significant effects on depressive symptoms [ 12 ] .
other studies have found that depressive symptoms are significantly related to presence of a spouse [ 13 ] and higher levels of education [ 14 ] , while low economic status has also been associated with a higher prevalence of depression at any level of morbidity [ 15 ] .
stroke patients were also shown to receive care and emotional and physical support from their family members [ 16 ] .
support from the family was a protective factor affecting poststroke depression [ 17 ] .
indeed , the severity of depressive symptoms has been found to be associated with lower levels of certain relational variables , such as social support and satisfaction thereof [ 18 ] .
the literature has shown that depressive symptoms can be reduced through interventions that aim to improve the self - concept and self - esteem , such as positive thinking , as well as social / family support [ 19 - 21 ] .
functional independence was also found to be a crucial factor contributing to the level of depressive symptoms [ 22 ] .
overall , the literature has found evidence for relationships between gender , age , education level , presence of a spouse , income status , and poststroke depressive symptoms .
demographic characteristics including gender roles , family role , caregiving support , and socioeconomic status make up a shared environment and are interdependent and interaction dynamics [ 23 - 25 ] .
there is , however , some controversy regarding the relationships between demographic characteristics and depressive symptoms : namely , one study found no significant differences or correlations between depression score and these demographic characteristics [ 17 ] .
given the chronic nature and long - term care after stroke , it seems necessary to precisely understand how depressive symptoms result from this pathology , which can be done through attending to the moderating effects of demographic variables on psychological status .
to our knowledge , little is known about the potential role of demographic factors in depression following a stroke .
the aim of our study was to evaluate the interaction of demographic characteristics including gender , age , education level , the presence of a spouse , and income status on depressive symptoms after stroke and to identify groups of patients that may be at risk of depressive symptoms after stroke .
methods participants we completed a secondary data analysis using data from a completed cross - sectional study in stroke patients .
the sample was a convenience sample derived from a study that aimed to create a model for participation restriction in chronic stroke survivors [ 26 ] .
written informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study was reviewed and approved by the ethic review board of y university in korea .
inclusion criteria for this study were ( 1 ) having a confirmed diagnosis of stroke based on hospital records , ( 2 ) experiencing their first stroke based on hospital records , ( 3 ) having a stroke diagnosis at least 12 months prior to data collection , ( 4 ) having sufficient communication and cognitive abilities to answer questions , and ( 5 ) living in the community .
cognitive function was assessed by using the validated korean version of the mini - mental state examination ( mmse - k ) [ 27 ] ; the scores can range from 0 to 30 , with higher scores indicating better cognition .
in this study , subjects whose mmse - k scores were 18 and below were excluded .
measures depressive symptoms depressive symptoms were measured using the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale ( ces - d ) .
the reliability and validity has been verified in stroke patients [ 28 , 29 ] and this scale is often used in studies of stroke outcomes [ 30 , 31 ] .
the ces - d scale consists of 20 items scored on a four - point likert scale ranging from 0 ( rarely or none of the time ) to 3 ( most or all the time ) ; four items are reverse scored .
the total score is calculated by summing the item scores .
the korean version of the ces - d scale has total scores ranging from 0 to 60 points .
higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms , with a score of 16 or greater suggesting the presence of clinical depressive symptoms [ 32 ] .
the cronbach 's alpha coefficient in stroke patients has been found to be 0.87 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0.84 - 0.89 [ 29 ] .
the presence of a spouse marital status was classified as the presence or absence of a spouse ( including not married , divorced , widowed , and separated ) .
the answers were then recoded into a dichotomous variable whether the spouse lived with the stroke patient or not .
income status income status was classified as sufficient and insufficient income categories .
this variable was measured subjectively by asking participants , " what was your economic status ?" participants answered on a five - point scale with answer options of " very sufficient ," " sufficient ," " average ," " somewhat insufficient ," and " very insufficient. " participants' answers were then recoded into a dichotomous variable indicating whether participants had experienced subjective income hardship or not .
average or above income was classified as " sufficient income " and " somewhat insufficient " and " very insufficient income " were classified as insufficient income .
statistical analysis the mean differences in the demographic characteristics were analyzed using independent t tests .
the general linear model ( glm ) is a generalization of multiple linear regression models that can flexibly measure the relationship between normally distributed dependent variables and some combination of categorical or continuous independent variables .
the glm can be used to analyze the mean differences when there is more than one independent variable .
the results of the glm can reveal the moderating effects among the independent variables .
in this study , we used the univariate glm ( which involves conducting an analysis of variance for variables with two or more factors ) because there was one dependent variable .
a full factorial design was selected and type iii sums of squares were used [ 33 ] .
the parametric tests were used from an ordinal scale of the ces - d in data because likert scales are often viewed as an interval scale [ 34 ] .
here , we determined whether there were significant main effects of gender , education level , age , income status , and the presence of a spouse on depressive symptoms .
we also examined the interactions between gender , education level , age , income status , and the presence of a spouse .
specifically , we measured the interactions of gender x education level , gender x age , gender x income status , education level x age , education level x the presence of a spouse , education level x the presence of a spouse , and education level x income status , age x the presence of a spouse , age x income status , and the presence of a spouse x income status on depressive symptoms .
the statistical analysis was performed using spss statistics 23.0 .
results characteristics of the participants data from 166 stroke patients ( 57 women and 109 men ) were analyzed .
their mean age was 53.40 years ( sd = 13.47 ) .
the general characteristics of the patients and the group differences are presented in table 1 .
there were no significant differences in the number of participants according to age or presence of spouse .
there were , however , significantly more male participants , participants with an education level of above high school , and participants with a sufficient income .
table 1 general characteristics of participants category n m sd t p gender male 109 19.38 10.86 - 2.12 . 036 female 57 23.28 12.05 age < 60 120 20.92 10.85 . 36 . 717 >= 60 46 20.20 12.84 the presence of spouse yes 108 20.22 11.35 - . 76 . 447 no 58 21.64 11.54 education below high school 47 21.26 12.64 2.56 . 012 above high school 119 19.32 10.61 household income sufficient income 120 18.43 11.40 - 4.39 . 000 insufficient income 46 26.67 9.11 moderating effects of demographic characteristics on depression patients' mean scores on the ces - d according to their demographic characteristics are presented in table 2 .
the depressive symptoms score was not associated with education or the presence of a spouse .
however , females , participants with less than a high school education , and participants with an insufficient income had significantly higher depressive symptom scores .
the main effects of gender , age , education level , presence of a spouse , and income status on depressive symptoms are presented in table 2 .
the main effects of gender and age were significant .

more specifically , the depressive symptom scores of women living with a spouse were significantly lower than were those of women without a spouse ( fig. 1 ) .
furthermore , among participants with an insufficient income , the depressive symptoms scores were higher among those in the above high school group than among those in the below high school group .
furthermore , among participants in the above high school group , depressive symptom scores were lower ( 16.48 ) in the sufficient income group than in the insufficient income group ( 27.73 ) .
there was a trivial difference in depressive symptoms by income status among participants in the below high school group ( insufficient income , 24.03 ; sufficient income , 24.69 ; fig. 2 ) .
finally , in the insufficient income group , the depressive symptoms of stroke patients living with a spouse were more severe than were those of patients living without a spouse .
conversely , economic status had a larger effect on stroke patients living with a spouse ( fig. 3 ). fig. 1 interaction effect of gender x the presence of spouse on depression fig. 2 interaction effect of education level x income status on depression fig. 3 interaction effect of the presence of spouse education level x income status on depression discussion and conclusion in this study , we investigated the relationships of various demographic characteristics - - including gender , age , education level , income status , and the presence of a spouse - - with depressive symptoms among stroke patients , as well as the interaction effects of these variables .
in this study , the depressive symptoms scores of women living with a spouse were lower than were those of women without a spouse. by contrast , the difference in depressive symptoms scores according to the presence of a spouse was trivial among male patients .
past studies have similarly shown gender - based differences in stroke outcomes , including daily activity independence and quality of life [ 35 ] .
female stroke patients appear to be less likely to achieve independence in daily activities and have poorer physical , cognitive , and emotional functioning ( manifesting as problems such as thinking difficulties , language difficulties , and less energy ) after discharge [ 36 ] .
considering that spouses are the primary caregivers for most patients are physically dependent on others [ 37 ] , it is possible that there are partner effects on emotional functioning , such as the development of depressive symptoms , among female stroke patients .
family support has been reported as a protective factor for major depression in chronic diseases such as cancer [ 38 ] .
research has similarly shown that depressive symptoms are negatively correlated with social support [ 17 ] ; thus , it is logical to suggest that stroke patients who do not have a spouse might be more depressed than those with a spouse .
in terms of the social contextual model , which accounts for the transactional and interdependent nature of social relationships , a diagnosis of chronic illness might lead to changes that influence one 's partner as well [ 23 - 25 ] .
however , this model cannot explain why depressive symptoms were found among male stroke patients who had a spouse in our study .
there are studies suggesting gender differences in partner effects [ 13 ] .
thus , our results are also supported by a study reporting that there are no partner effects in male patients .
in other words , husbands' depressive symptoms do not appear to be influenced by the wives' characteristics , whereas the husband 's characteristics can contribute to women 's somatic symptoms and depressive symptoms [ 13 ] .
in our results , the depressive symptoms of stroke patients with an education level above high school and insufficient income were higher than were those in the sufficient income group .
education has been found to be negatively associated with general depressive symptoms [ 13 , 14 , 39 , 40 ] , likely because of its relationship with future income , socioeconomic status , and life satisfaction [ 41 ] .
however , education did not have a protective role in the insufficient income group ; it was only protective in the sufficient group in our study .
this might be because material deprivation is an important variable in stroke patients .
patients with stroke are long - term users of health services and typically have high health care costs [ 42 ] .
low income has been found to be associated with less participation following stroke [ 43 ] .
additionally , around 20 % of stroke survivors are unemployed post - stroke and around half must change jobs [ 37 ] .
thus , under conditions of material deprivation , higher levels of education do not guarantee higher income .
because there was a strong association between low income and depression among patients [ 15 ] , further studies should be conducted to examine economic status changes after a stroke .
note that this study employed a subjective measure of income status .
subjective income status is an integral aspect of one 's economic well - being because it can improve one 's assessment of one 's capacity to meet financial needs , including maintaining independent community - based living [ 44 ] .
perceived income adequacy has been reported in the literature in various ways and has been verified as a predictor of other outcome measures such as self - rated health [ 45 ] , life satisfaction [ 46 ] , and depressive symptoms [ 47 ] .
in the same line of reasoning , with insufficient income , the presence and support of a spouse did not have positive effects on depressive symptoms in stroke patients .
in our study , the depressive symptoms scores of stroke patients living with a spouse in the insufficient income bracket were higher than were those living without a spouse .
overall decline in social function and burden for both the stroke survivors and their caregivers [ 37 ] would be much greater among those with a low income status .
stroke is a complex condition that can have multiple comorbidities [ 48 ] .
because managing complex patients requires greater clinical effort , a better understanding of this complex patient population is needed [ 49 ] .
the complexity of these patients increases the need for healthcare resources and substantial family and community support ; in particular , healthcare systems and services need to be redesigned to better meet the needs of these patients [ 49 ] .
personal characteristics , social determinant factors , and social / family support have been reported as some of the elements that contribute to the complexity of stroke patients [ 48 ] .
because depressive mood leads to a lowered likelihood of help - seeking intention [ 50 ] , identifying the risk factors of depressive symptoms after a stroke is necessary .
this study showed that assessment of risk factors should consider the interactions between gender , economic status , education level , and presence / absence of a spouse .
this would also be relevant for interventions aiming to reduce depressive symptoms during stroke rehabilitation .
the results of this study help in comprehensive understanding of the importance of screening for and treating depressive symptoms during rehabilitation after stroke .
in particular , our results showed that the researcher took into account the interaction between general characteristics such as gender , socioeconomic status , and the presence / absence of a spouse .
it might be noted , however , that researchers must be cautious in generalizing our findings , as the sample may not be fully representative of all stroke patients , especially those who are institutionalized or have cognitive deficits .
furthermore , our sample size was rather small , which increases the likelihood of spurious associations among a large number of interactions .
investigating such a large number of potential interactions indeed presents a statistical challenge for studies with relatively small sample sizes .
moreover , the probability of making a type ii error could increase due to lack of adjustment for multiple comparisons .
there was a need to be cautious when interpreting these results from the point of view that chance could increase with each subsequent test .
finally , the data were all collected through a self - report questionnaire , and some of the variables , in particular income status , were subjectively measured .
these facts suggest that the validity of our results might have been influenced by social desirability bias and intrinsic self - reporting bias .

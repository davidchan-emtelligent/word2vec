sodium glucose cotransporter 2 ( sglt2 ) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 ( dpp4 ) inhibitors have complementary mode of action .
for the meta - analysis comparing the efficacy and safety between sglt2 inhibitor plus dpp4 inhibitor ( sglt2i / dpp4i ) and placebo plus dpp4 inhibitor ( pcb / dpp4i ) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2dm ) , we selected randomized controlled trials from electronic databases by predefined criteria .
the primary outcome of interest was the change in glycated hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) from baseline. of 605 potentially relevant studies , 7 eligible rcts comprising 2,082 patients were included.sglt2i / dpp4i showed a greater reduction in hba1c ( weighted mean difference - 0.6 % , 95 % ci - 0.7 to - 0.5 %) , fasting plasma glucose , 2 h postprandial plasma glucose , and body weight compared to pcb / dpp4i .
the risk of hypoglycemia increased in sglt2i / dpp4i compared to that in pcb / dpp4i only when insulin or sulfonylureas were included as a background therapy .
the risk of urinary tract infection was not increased in sglt2i / dpp4i ; however , the risk of genital infection increased upon adding sglt2 inhibitors to pre - existing dpp4 inhibitors .
in conclusion , compared to pcb / dpp4i , sglt2i / dpp4i achieved better glycemic control and greater weight reduction without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia and urinary tract infection in patients with inadequately controlled t2dm .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 introduction the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is intertwined with multiple different mechanisms , which encompasses decreased insulin secretion , decreased insulin sensitivity , increased hepatic glucose production , decreased responses to incretin hormones , and increased renal reabsorption of glucose1 .
therefore , multiple strategies are often required to effectively control hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes .
the combinatory use of different anti - diabetic agents with complementary mechanisms of action may enhance the glucose - lowering effect without compromising drug safety .
newer anti - diabetic agents such as sodium glucose cotransporter 2 ( sglt2 ) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 ( dpp4 ) inhibitors are very useful in that they rarely cause common adverse effects of other oral hypoglycemic agents , such as weight gain and hypoglycemia .
sglt2 inhibitors reduce hyperglycemia by increasing urinary glucose excretion independent of insulin secretion or action2,3 .
dpp4 inhibitors , which inhibit the breakdown of active incretin hormones , improve glucose homeostasis by increasing insulin secretion and decreasing glucagon secretion in a glucose - dependent manner4,5 .
in this regard , the combination of these two drugs could be effective and safe for the treatment of hyperglycemia in patients with suboptimally controlled type 2 diabetes .
therefore , we performed a systematic review and meta - analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of a combination of an sglt2 inhibitor and a dpp4 inhibitor in patients with suboptimally controlled type 2 diabetes .
methods our systematic review and meta - analysis was performed using a pre - developed protocol that defined study selection criteria , search terms , resources to be searched , and data extraction and analysis strategy .
the study was conducted and reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta - analysis ( prisma ) statement6 .
eligibility criteria we included randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) that compared the sglt2 inhibitor plus the dpp4 inhibitor ( sglt2i / dpp4i ) with placebo plus the dpp4 inhibitor ( pcb / dpp4i ) in patients with type 2 diabetes concurrently treated with or without other anti - diabetic agents .
the eligible rcts were written in english , had at least 12 weeks of trial duration , and provided information of glycated hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) changes from baseline .
studies with a duplication of data or an extended phase of the original ones were excluded .
two authors ( s.h.m. and s.j.m. ) independently evaluated study titles , abstracts , and full texts , with disagreements resolved by discussion or by a third investigator ( y.m.c. ) .
data sources and search strategies we systematically searched to identify potentially eligible studies from inception to december 2016 from the following electronic databases : medline , embase , and cochrane central register of controlled trials ( central ) .
we also searched clinicaltrials.gov to find out unpublished studies .
the following search terms were used : " dpp - 4 inhibitor " , " vildagliptin " , " sitagliptin " , " linagliptin " , " alogliptin " , " saxagliptin " , " gemigliptin " , " dutogliptin " , " gosogliptin " , " anagliptin " , " tenegliptin " , " evogliptin " , " omarigliptin " , " trelagliptin " , " sglt2 inhibitor " , " dapagliflozin " , " canagliflozin " , " empagliflozin " , " ipragliflozin " , " luseogliflozin " , " tofogliflozin " , " ertugliflozin " , " sotagliflozin " .
both generic names and pre - marketed names of dpp - 4 inhibitors and sglt2 inhibitors were included .
the search results were limited to humans and clinical trials , which were adjusted to comply with the relevant rules in each database .
the detailed search strategies are provided in supplementary text 1 .
data extraction two authors ( s.h.m. and j. - h.y. ) independently extracted data from the selected studies using a standardized form .
any discrepancies were discussed by all authors and resolved by the consensus .
the primary efficacy outcome was the change in hba1c from the baseline to the end of the trial , and the secondary efficacy outcomes included the change in fasting plasma glucose ( fpg ) levels , 2 h postprandial glucose ( ppg ) , the proportion of patients achieving hba1c below 7 % , body weights , systolic blood pressure ( sbp ) , and lipid profiles from baseline .
the safety outcomes included the risk of hypoglycemia , urinary tract infection ( uti ) , and genital infection .
the additional extracted information was as follows : the name of first author , year of publication , drug name and doses of sglt2 inhibitors and dpp4 inhibitors , national clinical trial number , duration of treatment , concomitantly used anti - diabetic medications , number of randomized patients , age , percentage of men , body mass index ( bmi ) , baseline values of hba1c , and duration of diabetes .
for the dose - range studies , the results with the maximum approved doses were selected for comparability among different drugs in a class .
for the continuous outcome values , the intergroup mean difference between the treatment and the placebo group and its standard error were extracted as the summary measure .
we used the least squares ( ls ) mean differences from analysis of covariance ( ancova ) between groups with adjustment for covariates if available .
in some studies , we used the simple arithmetic mean difference for the outcomes , which were not adjusted .
for the dichotomous outcomes , the number of patients with or without the outcome was extracted .
assessment of the study quality and risk of bias quality assessments were carried out by two independent reviewers ( s.h.m. and j. - h.y. ) using the cochrane collaboration 's tool , and any controversies were resolved by mutual discussion .
we considered the following aspects for the risk of bias : including adequacy of random sequence generation , allocation concealment , blinding , completeness of outcome data , selective outcome reporting , and other biases that could introduce confounding effects .
for completeness of outcome data , analysis based on intention - to - treat analysis or full analysis set was considered as low risk .
selective reporting was assessed by comparing the reported outcomes with pre - specified study endpoints .
possibility for confounding biases was assessed by checking the comparability of participants' baseline characteristics including age , sex , bmi , baseline values of hba1c , and duration of diabetes between groups .
statistical analysis weighted mean difference ( wmd ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) between treatment groups were calculated for the change in hba1c , fpg , 2 h ppg , body weight , sbp , and serum lipids from baseline .
for dichotomous outcomes , including the proportion of patients achieving hba1c < 7 % and the risk of hypoglycemia , uti , and genital infection , we calculated the relative risks ( rrs ) and their 95 % cis .
additionally , a sensitivity analysis was done for the risk of hypoglycemia by excluding a trial which permitted the concomitant use of anti - diabetic agents associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia , such as insulin or insulin secretagogues .
a random effects model7 was used to account for heterogeneity across included studies for calculating pooled estimates and p - values , and an incorporated result was regarded as statistically significant if p - values < 0.05 .
the i2 statistic was calculated to evaluate the extent of heterogeneity across the studies .
the potential risk of publication bias was investigated graphically by constructing funnel plot for the primary outcome along with assessment of funnel plot asymmetry by performing egger 's test .
in addition , we performed subgroup analyses to assess a difference in the effect depending on two modes of combination based on whether the subjects ( i ) used the sglt2 inhibitor and dpp4 inhibitor simultaneously ; or ( ii ) used the sglt2 inhibitor sequentially after using the dpp4 inhibitor first .
we then integrated the results of subgroup analyses for deriving the overall outcome .
we used stata ( version 12 ; stata corp , college station , tx , usa ) for all the analyses .
data availability all data analysed during this study are included in this published article ( and its supplementary information files ) .
results search results and study characteristics a total of 533 potentially relevant studies were retrieved from initial database search form medline , embase , and central , of which 7 articles met all inclusion criteria8 - 14 .
among the 72 relevant search results from clinicaltrials.gov , there was no additional clinical trial to be included in the analysis .
therefore , 7 studies involving 2,082 study participants ( 1,051 randomized to sglt2i / dpp4i group and 1,031 randomized to pcb / dpp4i group ) with a mean trial duration of 23 weeks ( range 18 to 24 weeks ) were finally enrolled in this study .
the summary of study selection process is presented in fig. 1 and the characteristics of included studies are provided in table 1 .
three out of seven studies compared the simultaneous combination of an sglt2 inhibitor and a dpp4 inhibitor with the addition of a dpp4 inhibitor alone in drug - naive or metformin failure patients , whereas the other four studies compared the addition of an sglt2 inhibitor with a placebo as add - on therapy in patients inadequately controlled with a dpp4 inhibitor .
all included studies , except one trial ( initial combination of sglt2 inhibitor and dpp4 inhibitor ) 9 , permitted concurrent use of metformin. of note , one trial did not restrict any background anti - diabetic agents and permitted concurrent use of insulin or insulin secretagogues11 .

quality assessment of included studies all seven rcts were double - blinded and were therefore classified as low risk .
for assessing the bias of incomplete outcome data and selective reporting , all studies were classified to be low risk .
five out of the seven studies did not state the process of random sequence generation8,10,12 - 14 .
the allocation concealment was performed appropriately in all included studies , and demographics and baseline characteristics of all studies were generally well balanced and therefore judged that studies were not prone to confounding biases .
the summarized risk of bias is depicted in supplementary figure 1 .
efficacy outcomes meta - analysis of the seven studies showed that sglt2i / dpp4i led to greater improvement in hba1c than pcb / dpp4i ( wmd - 0.59 % , 95 % ci - 0.68 to - 0.49 %) ( fig. 2 ) .
both simultaneous combination and sequential addition of sglt2 inhibitors to dpp4 inhibitors showed a greater reduction in hba1c than the respective pcb / dpp4i group ( wmd - 0.49 % , 95 % ci - 0.61 to - 0.38 % and wmd - 0.65 , 95 % ci - 0.78 to - 0.52 % , respectively ) .
there was a trend toward greater hba1c reduction in sequential addition of sglt2 inhibitors to dpp4 inhibitors compared with the simultaneous combination , although the difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.153 ) .

all seven studies assessed the change in fpg from baseline ( fig. 3a ) .
the sglt2i / dpp4i group showed a greater reduction in fpg than the pcb / dpp4i group in the pooled analysis ( wmd - 26.9 mg / dl , 95 % ci - 30.4 to - 23.3 mg / dl ) , and in the subgroups with either simultaneous or sequential mode of combination ( wmd - 23.2 mg / dl , 95 % ci - 27.5 to - 18.9 mg / dl and wmd - 29.9 , 95 % ci - 34.5 to - 25.3 mg / dl , respectively ) .
there was also a trend toward a greater decrease in fpg in the sequential combination group compared with the simultaneous combination group ( p = 0.081 ) .
in addition , only three studies reported the changes in 2 h ppg from baseline10,12,13 ( supplementary figure 2 ) and the reduction of 2 h ppg was greater in the sglt2i / dpp4i group than in the pcb / dpp4i group ( wmd - 41.4 mg / dl , 95 % ci - 47.0 to - 35.7 mg / dl ) .

the diamonds indicate the pooled estimates .
pcb / dpp4i = placebo plus dpp4 inhibitor ; sglt2i / dpp4i = sglt2 inhibitor plus dpp4 inhibitor .
all seven studies assessed the proportion of patients attaining hba1c levels of < 7.0 % 8 - 14 ( fig. 3b ) .
the rr for achieving target hba1c was higher in the sglt2i / dpp4i group compared with the pcb / dpp4i group ( rr 1.9 , 95 % ci 1.7 - 2.3 ) and in the subgroups of the simultaneous combination group and the sequential combination group ( rr 1.9 , 95 % ci 1.5 - 2.4 and rr 2.0 , 95 % ci 1.6 - 2.7 , respectively ) .
for body weight change , all seven studies provided the results ( fig. 3c ) .
significantly greater body weight reduction was shown in the sglt2i / dpp4i group compared with the pcb / dpp4i group ( wmd - 2.0 kg , 95 % ci - 2.3 to - 1.7 kg ) and in the subgroups of the simultaneous and sequential combination ( wmd - 1.9 kg , 95 % ci - 2.5 to - 1.4 kg and wmd - 2.0 kg , 95 % ci - 2.5 to - 1.6 kg , respectively ) .
the difference between the two subgroups was not statistically significant ( p = 0.804 ) .
four studies reported a change in sbp10,11,13,14 ( supplementary figure 3 ) .
a pooled analysis of four studies showed a 3.2 mmhg ( 95 % ci - 4.5 to - 1.8 mmhg ) reduction in sbp in the sglt2i / dpp4i group compared with the pcb / dpp4i group .
serum lipids such as total cholesterol , triglycerides , ldl cholesterol ( ldl - c ) , and hdl cholesterol ( hdl - c ) were assessed by the percent change from baseline10 - 14 .
in the pooled analysis , ldl - c and hdl - c were significantly increased in the sglt2i / dpp4i group compared with the pcb / dpp4i group , whereas total cholesterol and triglycerides were not significantly different ( supplementary figures 4 - 7 ) .
subgroup analyses were not performed due to a paucity of data .
safety outcomes all seven studies were available for the analysis of hypoglycemia8,10 - 12,14 ( fig. 4a ) .
the definition of hypoglycemia was slightly different among studies ( supplementary table s1 ) .
in the pooled analysis , the risk of hypoglycemia was higher in the sglt2i / dpp4i group than in the pcb / dpp4i group ( rr 1.9 , 95 % ci 1.2 - 3.0 ) .
the subgroup analyses showed that the sequential addition of an sglt2 inhibitor to a dpp4 inhibitor increased the risk of hypoglycemia compared with the pcb / dpp4i group ( rr 2.2 , 95 % ci 1.3 - 3.7 ) , whereas the simultaneous combination of the sglt2i / dpp4i group did not increase the risk of hypoglycemia ( rr 1.0 , 95 % ci 0.4 - 2.8 ) .
however , in one trial that permitted the concomitant use of anti - diabetic agents associated with hypoglycemia , hypoglycemic episodes were reported much higher in the subgroup of patients who were taking background insulin or insulin secretagogues ( 29 / 87 vs. 12 / 74 in the treatment and control group , respectively ) than those among the patients not on insulin or insulin secretagogues ( 1 / 24 vs. 0 / 28 in the treatment and control group , respectively ) 11 .
a sensitivity analysis after excluding that study revealed no increased risk of hypoglycemia in the sglt2i / dpp4i group compared with the pcb / dpp4i group ( rr 1.4 , 95 % ci 0.7 - 2.9 ) ( supplementary figure 8 ) .

( b ) relative risks of urinary tract infection with sglt2 inhibitor plus dpp4 inhibitor compared with placebo plus dpp4 inhibitor .

the subgroup analyses were presented separately according to the simultaneous combination and sequential addition of two drugs .
the diamonds indicate the pooled estimates .
pcb / dpp4i = placebo plus dpp4 inhibitor ; sglt2i / dpp4i = sglt2 inhibitor plus dpp4 inhibitor .
all seven studies assessed the risk of uti and genital infection at the end of the treatment .
the definitions for uti and genital infection were based on the medical dictionary for regulatory activities ( meddra ) system for 4 out of 7 selected trials8,9,12,14 , while the rest of the studies did not mention the definition of such conditions .
the pooled analysis showed no significant increase in rr of uti in the sglt2i / dpp4i group compared with the pcb / dpp4i group , regardless of either a simultaneous or sequential combination ( fig. 4b ) .
however , the risk of genital infection was higher in the sglt2i / dpp4i group than in the pcb / dpp4i group ( rr 2.92 , 95 % ci 1.29 - 6.62 ) ( fig. 4c ) .
the risk of genital infection was increased in the sequential combination subgroup ( rr 5.57 , 95 % ci 2.33 - 13.333 ) but not in the simultaneous combination subgroup ( rr 1.35 , 95 % ci 0.55 - 3.34 ) .
exploration of heterogeneity and publication bias the results of all heterogeneity tests associated with the meta - analyses performed in this study were not statistically significant ( p > 0.05 ) .
the funnel plot and egger 's test found no evidence of a small study effect ( p = 0.229 ) ( supplementary figure 9 ) .
it was difficult to assess a risk of publication bias properly because of the small number of included studies .
discussion the present systematic review and meta - analysis revealed the superior glycemic control in sglt2i / dpp4i than pcb / dpp4i , with greater reduction in hba1c , fpg , and 2 h ppg , and a higher hba1c goal achieving rate .
the complementary mechanisms of action of sglt2 inhibitors and dpp4 inhibitors may explain these beneficial effects of the combination .
interestingly , the sequential combination of sglt2 inhibitors to pre - existing dpp4 inhibitors tended to be more effective than the simultaneous combination of the two drugs .
this result might be due to differences in patients' characteristics at baseline according to the mode of combination .
the hba1c reduction efficacy of an sglt2 inhibitor was reported to be greater in patients with a higher hba1c value at baseline10 .
however , as shown in table 1 , the baseline hba1c appeared to be comparable between the two modes of combination .
another possibility is that the patients in the sequential combination studies , who were inadequately controlled with dpp4 inhibitors , might be more sensitive to sglt2 inhibitors , which needs further investigation .
the sglt2i / dpp4i combination showed a significant reduction in body weight compared with pcb / dpp4i in either simultaneous or sequential combination studies .
the weight loss effect of sglt inhibitors is explained by calorie loss through urinary glucose excretion2,3 .
intriguingly , considering the continuous energy excretion through glycosuria , sglt2 inhibitors exhibit only a modest amount of weight loss , usually 2 - 3 kg from baseline15 .
this phenomenon is explained by recent studies showing that weight loss by sglt2 inhibitors may lead to adaptive increase in appetite and calorie intake16,17 .
the amount of weight loss by sglt2 inhibitors in combination with dpp4 inhibitors found in our meta - analysis was similar to the previously reported weight - loss effect of sglt2 inhibitors in general .
the risk of hypoglycemia is one of the major limiting factors when combining multiple agents to reach glycemic goals in patients with type 2 diabetes .
it is unlikely that dpp4 inhibitors cause hypoglycemia when used alone or in combination with metformin , due to the glucose - dependent effects on insulin and glucagon secretion18 .
furthermore , dpp4 inhibitors improve the ability of alpha cells to sense and respond to hypoglycemia19,20 .
sglt2 inhibitors , when used alone or in combination with metformin , are also associated with reduced risk of hypoglycemia by increasing plasma glucagon concentrations and decreasing plasma insulin concentrations21,22 .
however , in our study , the risk of hypoglycemia increased when sglt2 inhibitors were sequentially added to pre - existing dpp4 inhibitors , which was probably due to a study that permitted insulin and / or sulfonylureas as background anti - diabetes therapy11 .
indeed , in the sensitivity analysis excluding the study , the imbalance in the risk of hypoglycemia disappeared .
uti and genital infection are commonly reported as adverse effects of sglt2 inhibitors .
in a meta - analysis of 58 studies , sglt2 inhibitors increased the risk of uti and genital infection compared to placebo ( odds ratio [ or ] 1.34 , 95 % ci 1.03 - 1.74 , and or 3.50 , 95 % ci 2.46 - 4.99 , respectively ) 23 .
there was also some concern over increased susceptibility to infection with dpp4 inhibitors .
in an early meta - analysis , dpp4 inhibitors were reported to increase the risk of upper respiratory infection and uti24 .
however , subsequent analysis did not show any increased risk of infection related to the use of dpp4 inhibitors25 .
when we compared sglt2i / dpp4i and pcb / dpp4i , the risk of uti and genital infection was not increased regardless of the mode of combination .
however , the rr of genital infection increased in the sequential addition of sglt2 inhibitors to pre - existing dpp4 inhibitors .
it is noteworthy that jabbour et al.12 reported a very high incidence of genital infection .
although it was unclear why the incidences of genital infection varied widely , it is conceivable that different clinical characteristics of study participants or different reporting rates could be the source of the heterogeneity .
although the number of studies that reported data on lipid profiles was limited , when compared with the pcb / dpp4i group , the sglt2i / dpp4i group significantly increased serum hdl - c and ldl - c levels and showed a tendency to decrease serum triglyceride levels .
these results were consistent with previous data reported in patients treated with sglt2 inhibitors26 .
although the mechanisms by which the sglt2 inhibitor raises ldl - c levels are not clearly understood , emerging evidences suggest potential mechanisms , such as increased lipoprotein lipase activity , suppressed generation of cholesterol - poor ldl - c , and reduced ldl receptor - mediated ldl clearance by the liver27 .
however , the increased ldl - c does not seem to be connected to a high cardiovascular event risk , which was supported by the empa - reg outcome study , exhibiting a 38 % reduction in cardiovascular mortality28 .
there are some limitations in this study .
first , the current systematic review and meta - analysis included two different groups of studies in terms of mode of the combination of the two drugs ( i.e. a simultaneous and sequential combination ) .
however , the subgroup analyses yielded largely similar results and the i2 was not inappropriately high in the pooled analysis for hba1c ( 43.1 % , p = 0.103 ) .
rather , our analysis showed that sglt2 inhibitors are efficacious as a combinatorial drug of dpp4 inhibitors in various clinical settings .
second , even though the included studies were well - designed rcts with a sufficient sample size , the number of included studies was small .
third , the treatment duration was relatively short , which prevented us from concluding the long - term efficacy and safety of the sglt2i / dpp4i combination therapy .
however , to the best of our knowledge , the present meta - analysis is the first to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of an sglt2 inhibitor and a dpp4 inhibitor in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes .
in conclusion , the sglt2 inhibitor and dpp4 inhibitor combination therapy improves glycemic control and reduces body weight without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia and uti in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes .
because sglt2 inhibitors and dpp4 inhibitors are newer and more expensive drugs , the long - term efficacy and safety and the cost - effectiveness of the combination need to be examined .

background surveillance after orchiectomy has recently been a management option in patients with stage i seminoma , while it remains controversial in those with stage i nonseminoma , and the risk factor associated with relapse is still a matter of concern in both entities .
this study was performed to explore pathological risk factors for post - orchiectomy relapse in patients with stage i seminoma and nonseminoma , and to assess oncological outcomes in those managed with surveillance .
methods in this single institution study , 118 and 40 consecutive patients with stage i seminoma and nonseminoma were reviewed , respectively. of the 118 patients with stage i seminoma , 56 and one received adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy , respectively , and 61 were managed with surveillance. of the 40 men with stage i nonseminoma , 4 underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and 36 were managed with surveillance .
results no patient had cause - specific death during the mean observation period of 104 and 99 months in men with seminoma and nonseminoma , respectively .
in men with stage i seminoma , 1 ( 1.7 %) receiving radiotherapy and 4 ( 6.6 %) men managed with surveillance had disease relapse ; the 10 - year relapse - free survival ( rfs ) rate was 93.4 % in men managed with surveillance , and their rfs was not different from that in patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy ( logrank p = 0.15 ) .
patients with tunica albuginea involvement showed a poorer rfs than those without ( 10 - year rfs rate 80.0 % vs. 94.1 %) , although the difference was of borderline significance ( p = 0.09 ) .
in men with stage i nonseminoma , 9 ( 22.5 %) patients experienced relapse .
patients with lymphovascular invasion seemingly had a poorer rfs than those without ; 40.0 % and 18.7 % of the patients with and without lymphovascular invasion had disease relapse , respectively , although the difference was not significant ( logrank p = 0.17 ) .
conclusion in both men with stage i seminoma and nonseminoma , surveillance after orchiectomy is a feasible option .
however , disease extension through tunica albuginea might be a factor associated with disease relapse in patients with organ - confined seminoma , and those with stage i nonseminoma showing lymphovascular invasion may possibly be at high risk for disease relapse .
stage i seminoma stage i nonseminoma surveillance outcome background testicular germ cell tumor is histopathologically classified into seminoma and nonseminomas , and nonseminomas are subclassified into embryonal carcinoma , choriocarcinoma , yolk sac tumor , teratoma , and mixed germ cell tumors .
after an orchiectomy , the most feasible therapeutic option is determined with risk assessment based on the pathological diagnosis and clinical staging [ 1 ] .
nonseminoma is more potent to metastasize and lead to poorer prognosis compared with seminoma at same stage .
surveillance has recently been a management option in many patients with stage i seminoma , and treatment and follow - up strategy vary according to the clinicopathological characteristics in stage i nonseminoma [ 2,3 ] .
however , risk factors associated with relapse still remain controversial in both entities .
this study was performed to explore pathological risk factors associated with disease relapse in men with stage i seminoma and nonseminoma , and to evaluate oncological outcomes in those managed with surveillance after orchiectomy .
methods patients this retrospective research project was approved by the ethics committee of niigata cancer center hospital .
written informed consent was obtained from all the patients .
in total , 158 consecutive patients who were treated for stage i testicular germ cell tumors at the department of urology , niigata cancer center hospital between may 1980 and december 2008 were enrolled in the present study ; 118 and 40 men were pathologically diagnosed with seminoma and nonseminomas , respectively .
all of them received high orchiectomy .
disease stage was determined with abdominal - pelvic computerized tomography ( ct ) and thoracic ct or chest roentgenography .
patients' characteristics were presented in table 1 ; serum tumor markers such as lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) , alpha - fetoprotein ( afp ) , and human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit ( hcgbeta ) had been normalized after orchiectomy in all of them. of the 118 patients with stage i seminoma , 56 received adjuvant radiotherapy ( para - aortic with or without ipsilateral pelvic irradiation of 28.9 gy in 17 fractions ) , 61 were managed with surveillance without adjuvant therapy , and one underwent adjuvant chemotherapy .

histopathological subtypes in the nonseminoma group were shown in table 2 .
rare histotypes potentially coexistent with teratoma were not described [ 4 ]. of the 40 men with stage i nonseminomas , 4 underwent cisplatin - based systemic chemotherapy and 36 were managed surveillance without additional treatment .
follow - up protocol was principally as follows : monthly measurement of tumor markers and bimonthly or 3 monthly thoracic - abdominal - pelvic ct for the initial 6 months , 3 - month interval measurement of tumor markers and thoracic - abdominal - pelvic ct for the next 2 to 3 years , and 6 - to 12 - month interval examinations for the next 5 to 10 years .
the mean observation period was 104 ( range : 19 - 340 ) months in the seminoma group , and it was 99 ( range : 23 - 261 ) months in the nonseminoma group .

figure 3 impact of lymphovascular invasion on disease relapse - free survival in patients with stage i nonseminoma .
discussion stage i testicular seminoma has been reported to relapse between 10 % and 20 % in previous studies [ 5,6 ] , while adjuvant radiotherapy is frequently used with a relatively encouraging outcome as relapse rates of 3 - 4 % [ 7 ] .
in our institution , the overwhelming majority of men with stage i seminoma have recently been managed with surveillance ( table 3 ) .
in the current patient series managed with surveillance , the 10 - year relapse - free survival rate reached 93.4 % ; it is speculated that diagnostic / staging modalities such as high - performance ct might lead to an appropriate exclusion of metastases and favorable outcomes .
also , none of them died during the observation period ; the prognosis of men with stage i testicular seminoma is excellent when an appropriate surveillance protocol is applied .
however , their postorchiectomy management remains a matter of concern , although adverse events including treatment - associated morbidity is less in adjuvant setting radiotherapy than in radical chemotherapy for clinically recurrent disease .
a few previous studies tried to define risk - stratification of testis - confined seminoma .
aparicio and associates prospectively studied 314 men with stage i seminoma managed according to risk - adapted criteria .
in their trial , those with tumor diameter less than 4 cm and no rete testis involvement were managed with surveillance ; 6 % of these patients still experienced relapse [ 8 ] .
in our study , tumor burden , tumor markers , and pt were not associated with disease relapse .
concerning pathological characteristics , however , patients with disease extension through tunica albuginea showed a poorer relapse - free survival than those without .
although the difference was not significant ( p = 0.09 , figure 2 ) , 3.8 % of the patients without involvement of the tunica albuginea had relapse , whereas the relapse rate reached 20 % in those with tunica albuginea involvement ( table 4 ) .
a recent retrospective study reported that tunica albuginea penetration was predictive of the presence of metastasis ( n = 86 , p = 0.00001 ) , although the study recruited men with seminoma at all stages [ 9 ] .
to verify its significance in risk - stratification of stage i seminoma , a high - volume study based on cancer registry is currently underway .
it also remains controversial how patients with stage i nonseminoma should be managed .
although cause - specific death was absent in our patient series , it has been fatal in 1 % to 15 % in previous reports [ 10 - 12 ] .
twenty - five to 30 % of the patients with stage i nonseminoma managed by surveillance have been reported to experience disease relapse [ 7 ] , and adjuvant chemotherapy has been the therapeutic standard for those with elevated tumor markers at diagnosis and / or highly malignant histopathology [ 8,11 ] .
vascular invasion and predominant embryonal carcinoma are generally considered to be histopathologic risk factors [ 7 ] .
in our institution , men with stage i nonseminoma with normalized tumor markers or markers showing reductions assumed based on their half - life period are principally managed with surveillance regardless of the mentioned pathological characteristics , and the present study suggested that patients with lymphovascular invasion may have higher risk for relapse .
although the difference was not significant , 40.0 % of the patients showing lymphovascular invasion had disease relapse , while 18.8 % of those without it experienced relapse ( figure 3 , table 6 ) .
the present study had several limitations .
it was performed in a retrospective design , and the study volume was relatively small .
also , our database did not include information about the presence of some uncommon histological components such as sarcomatous differentiation coexistent with teratoma and potentially having an impact on oncological outcomes [ 4,13 ] .
conclusions in men with stage i seminoma , surveillance after orchiectomy is a feasible option .
although further studies are warranted , the present study suggested that tunica albuginea involvement may be a risk factor associated with disease relapse in them .
in men with stage i nonseminoma and normalized markers after orchiectomy , surveillance is also a feasible option , but those with lymphovascular invasion may possibly be at high risk for disease relapse .

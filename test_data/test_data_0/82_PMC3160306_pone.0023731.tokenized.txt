protein superfamilies can exhibit considerable diversification of function among their members in various organisms .
the dj - 1 superfamily is composed of proteins that are principally involved in stress response and are widely distributed in all kingdoms of life .
the model flowering plant arabidopsis thaliana contains three close homologs of animal dj - 1 , all of which are tandem duplications of the dj - 1 domain .
consequently , the plant dj - 1 homologs are likely pseudo - dimeric proteins composed of a single polypeptide chain .
we report that one a. thaliana dj - 1 homolog ( atdj1c ) is the first dj - 1 homolog in any organism that is required for viability .
homozygous disruption of the atdj1c gene results in non - viable , albino seedlings that can be complemented by expression of wild - type or epitope - tagged atdj1c .
the plastids from these dj1c plants lack thylakoid membranes and granal stacks , indicating that atdj1c is required for proper chloroplast development .
atdj1c is expressed early in leaf development when chloroplasts mature , but is downregulated in older tissue , consistent with a proposed role in plastid development .
in addition to its plant - specific function , atdj1c is an atypical member of the dj - 1 superfamily that lacks a conserved cysteine residue that is required for the functions of most other superfamily members .
the essential role for atdj1c in chloroplast maturation expands the known functional diversity of the dj - 1 superfamily and provides the first evidence of a role for specialized dj - 1 - like proteins in eukaryotic development .
introduction the dj - 1 superfamily comprises a diverse set of proteins that are present in most organisms .
despite this broad distribution , the overwhelming majority of studies on dj - 1 superfamily proteins have focused on the human protein and its closely related animal homologs due to the involvement of human dj - 1 in parkinsonism and various cancers [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
a variety of possible biochemical functions for human dj - 1 have been suggested , including rna binding , transcriptional regulation , involvement in the akt / pten / pi3k , nrf2 , and ask1 signaling pathways , inhibition of cytotoxic protein aggregation , and glutathione metabolism [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
dj - 1 has an established role in the cellular defense against oxidative stress , and the mitochondrion appears to be an important site of dj - 1 action [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
at the molecular level , the cytoprotective function of human dj - 1 has been shown to require both homodimerization and the presence of a conserved cysteine residue that is oxidized under stress conditions [ 14 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
other members of the dj - 1 superfamily have also been characterized , and although several appear to be involved in the cellular response to stress , none has been as thoroughly studied as the human protein .
in prokaryotes , there is strong evidence that more distant dj - 1 homologs have diverse functions , such as dj - 1 superfamily enzymes with isocyanide hydratase activity in the pseudomonads [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , protease activity in certain archaea [ 23 ] , or dna binding proteins containing a dj - 1 domain fused to a helix - turn - helix motif in many bacteria [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
however , in eukaryotes , it remains unclear if what has been learned about animal dj - 1 pertains more generally to other eukaryotic dj - 1 homologs , particularly in the plant kingdom .
plants contain several dj - 1 superfamily proteins , only two of which have been characterized to date .
these proteins , from arabidopsis thaliana and brassica rapa , are both implicated in oxidative stress response , suggesting that plant and animal dj - 1 proteins may have related cellular functions [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
plants offer unique advantages for comparative study of eukaryotic protein function , because they share many features in common with animal systems , while exhibiting major differences as a result of diverging from the animal lineage approximately 1.5 billion years ago .
like animals , plants contain mitochondria and are subject to oxidative stress , two important aspects of human dj - 1 function .
unlike animals , however , the primary source of reactive oxygen species in plants under normal conditions is photo - oxidative stress in the chloroplast [ 28 ] .
furthermore , gene duplication is common in plants , providing an opportunity to study protein functional divergence within a single organism .
arabidopsis thaliana is the model system of choice for in vivo characterization of protein function in flowering plants [ 29 ] and has a total of three close dj - 1 homologs , named atdj1a - c. while atdj1a has been previously characterized as an oxidative stress response protein , little is known about the possible functions of the other two atdj1 proteins .
in this study , we show that atdj1c is an atypical member of the dj - 1 superfamily that lacks the conserved cysteine residue that has been shown to be critical for the function of animal dj - 1 .
disruption of the dj1c gene ( at4g34020 ) by t - dna insertion in arabidopsis thaliana results in albino seedlings with malformed chloroplasts , and is the first known dj - 1 sueprfamily protein that is required for viability in any organism .
the essential role of dj1c in plastid development is distinct from any currently proposed model for dj - 1 protein function and suggests that eukaryotic dj - 1 homologs are more functionally diverse than currently appreciated .
the physiological importance of atdj1c also demonstrates that the conserved cysteine residue that is a hallmark of the dj - 1 superfamily is not essential for the functions of all superfamily members .
results plant dj - 1 superfamily genes encode tandem duplications of dj - 1 - like domains the large dj - 1 superfamily is represented in nearly all organisms [ 24 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
superfamily members are predominantly either single domain proteins or fusions of a dj - 1 - like domain with a helix - turn - helix motif , which is common in prokaryotes [ 24 ] , [ 30 ] .
in the a. thaliana genome , three genes encoding close homologs of human dj - 1 were identified ( at3g14990 , at1g53280 & at4g34020 ) .
other , more distant dj - 1 superfamily members are also present in arabidopsis , such as at3g02720 , at3g54600 , and at2g38860 , which belong to the yhbo / pfpi clade of the dj - 1 superfamily .
interestingly , all of these plant homologs encode two tandem dj - 1 - like domains , a gene architecture which appears to be unique to plant members of the superfamily [ 24 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
the highly conserved cysteine residue that contributes to the redox regulation of animal dj - 1 [ 8 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 32 ] is conserved in both tandem dj - 1 domain repeats of atdj1a and atdj1b , but absent in both dj - 1 domains of atdj1c ( fig. 1 ) .
therefore , atdj1c is an atypical member of the dj - 1 superfamily that lacks this highly conserved residue and functionally essential residue in the animal dj - 1s .
in addition , both atdj1b and atdj1c have n - terminal extensions that are predicted to target the proteins to mitochondria and / or chloroplasts ( fig. 1 ) , consistent with previous subcellular localization studies of these proteins [ 33 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0023731.g001 figure 1 dj - 1 homologs are widespread , and plant genes encode tandem duplications of dj - 1 domains .
( a ) proteins encoded by plant , animal and bacterial dj - 1 homologs , homo sapiens ( hs ) , escherichia coli ( ec ) and arabidopsis thaliana ( at ) , are represented schematically. h. sapiens ( hsdj1 ) , e. coli ( ecyajl ) and a. thaliana ( atdj1a , atdj1b and atdj1c ) , dj - 1 / thij domains ( blue ) and n - terminal extensions ( red or black ) are represented .
calculations using various web - based programs to predict subcellular localization indicate that hsdj - 1 , ecyajl and atdj1a have no detectable n - terminal targeting sequences , atdj1b targeting is ambiguous ( mitochondria and / or chloroplast , black ) , and atdj1c has a chloroplast transit peptide ( ctp , red ) .
the relative position of the highly conserved cysteine modified by oxidation in hsdj - 1 ( c106 ) is indicated with an asterisk (*) .
( b , c ) amino acid alignments ( clustal ) of plant , animal and bacterial dj - 1 homologs were performed with dnastar lasergene software .
n - terminal and c - terminal dj - 1 domains of the plant genes are designated a and b , respectively .
a region surrounding the highly conserved cysteine (*) is shown ( b ) , and the corresponding region in the full alignment is also indicated by a red bar ( c ) .
the n - terminal extensions found in the plant atdj1b and atdj1c proteins and predicted cleavage site for the atdj1c ctp ( arrowhead ) are also indicated ( c ) .
atdj1c is a chloroplast - targeted protein that is expressed in young expanding leaves with a gradient of expression chloroplast transit peptides ( ctps ) are sequence motifs in the n - terminal residues of proteins that direct proteins to this organelle [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] .
atdj1c encodes a 465 amino acid protein of 51 kda molecular weight and contains a predicted ctp at its n - terminus .
therefore , atdj1c is predicted to be targeted to the chloroplast ( fig. 1 ) .
to test this , transgenic plants harboring a construct producing gfp - tagged dj1c driven by its native promoter ( pdj1c : gdj1c : gfp ) were generated and analyzed by live cell imaging and confocal microscopy .
the use of the native promoter avoids potential artifacts resulting from non - physiological levels of protein expression and also permits the study of developmental regulation of atdj1c expression .
microscopy reveals that atdj1c - gfp is targeted to chloroplasts and that greater expression is observed in young , expanding leaves than mature , fully expanded leaves .
this observation is confirmed by relative quantitative rt - pcr of the atdj1c transcript ; older leaves have significantly lower (~ 60 % , p < 0.05 ) atdj1c transcript levels than young , expanding leaves ( fig. 2 ) .
moreover , a gradient of expression is observed in young expanding leaves , with strongest expression near the major vein at the basal portion and weakest expression at the apical tip ( fig. 2 ) .
this pattern of expression mirrors the leaf developmental gradient [ 37 ] and is correlated with the gradient of chloroplast maturation in a new leaf .
in particular , etioplasts are transitioning to chloroplasts at the base of the leaf , where atdj1c expression is greatest , while protein levels diminish in regions of the leaf where chloroplasts have fully matured .
in light of the localization of atdj1c to the chloroplast ( see above ) , this suggests that the protein plays a role in chloroplast development and maturation .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0023731.g002 figure 2 atdj1c encodes a chloroplast - targeted protein , expressed in young expanding leaves , with a gradient of expression .
( a ) atdj1c was cloned into the binary vector pegs to produce an in - frame fusion to green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) at the c - terminus of the protein driven by the native promoter ( pdj1c : gdj1c : gfp ) .
subcellular localization of dj1c : : gfp in arabidopsis thaliana transgenic plants , generated by agrobacterium tumefaciens - mediated transformation , was visualized by confocal microscopy .
controls included non - transgenic , wild - type col - 0 plants as negative and transgenic col - 0 plants harboring the pegs vector ( p35s : gfp ) as positive controls ( gfp expression is observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus ) .
transgenic plants harboring the pdj1c : gdj1c : gfp construct show atdj1c - gfp expression exclusively in chloroplasts .
images were taken at 60x magnification at negative control levels .
red channel , green channel and merged images from z - series of leaf epidermal and mesophyll cells are shown , and white bar represents 50 microm .

relative steady - state atdj1c gene expression was determined as the ratio of dj1c to actin2 ( inset ) .

knockout dj1c t - dna insertion mutants are seedling lethal with compromised chloroplast ultrastructure the native atdj1c gene was disrupted by t - dna insertion to determine the effect of its absence on arabidopsis .
two distinct dj1c t - dna insertion alleles indicate that atdj1c is essential for arabidopsis viability .
t - dna insertions responsible for two dj1c knockout alleles ( dj1c - 1 , salk _ 125439 ; dj1c - 2 , salk _ 022772 ) were validated by pcr - based genotyping ( fig. 3 and fig. s1 ) .
after crossing plants that were hemizygous for the two dj1c t - dna insertion alleles , a fraction of the progeny are small , albino seedlings that subsequently die , demonstrating that atdj1c is essential for viability .
the albino phenotype segregates in hemizygous crosses 3:1 for viable : albino ( dj1c - 1 , n = 587 , x 2 = 0.128 ; dj1c - 2 , n = 169 ; x 2 = 2.148 ) , as expected for a single , recessive mutation .
moderate growth of the dj1c knockout albino seedlings can be achieved by culturing on media containing varying concentrations of sucrose , which compensates for the loss of photosynthetic capacity in dj1c null mutants by providing an exogenous carbon source ( fig. 3b ) .
the improved viability of the albino homozygous dj1c knockout seedlings demonstrates that the lethality of the dj1c mutation is due to loss of photosynthetically - driven carbon fixation .

annealing sites for oligonucleotide primers used for pcr - based genotyping and rt - pcr are indicated ( see table s1 ) .
( b ) progeny from a plant hemizygous for the dj1c - 1 t - dna insertion allele , indicate that one quarter of the germinated seeds are small , albino seedlings that subsequently die , as expected for single , recessive mutations .
supplementation with sucrose results in moderate growth .
( c - d ) chloroplast ultrastructure is compromised , but mitochondrial ultrastructure is unaffected , in dj1c cotyledons .
for transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) , thin sections of cotyledon tissue were observed under a transmission electron microscope ( hitachi h7500 - i ) .
wild - type ( wt ) cotyledons show typical chloroplast structure with thylakoid membranes and granal stacks ( t ) and starch granules ( s ) , whereas dj1c mutant ( dj1c ) cotyledons lack organized thylakoid membranes and display enhanced accumulation of lipid - rich bodies ( l ) and internal vesicles .
differences in mitochondrial numbers and morphology were not observed .
black bars represent 2 microm ( c ) or 0.5 microm ( d ) .
the albino seedling - lethal phenotype of the dj1c mutants is consistent with the chloroplast localization of gfp - tagged atdj1c and the expression gradient of atdj1c in leaves ( fig. 2 ) , as all of these data suggest that atdj1c plays a critical role in chloroplast maturation .
to investigate the impact of dj1c null mutants on organellar ultrastructure , thin sections of wild - type col - 0 and dj1c mutant cotyledon tissue were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .
relative to wild - type chloroplasts , the dj1c plastids are smaller , deformed , and devoid of thylakoid membrane , granal stacks and starch granules .
large internal vesicles that resemble those found in proplastids and associated lipid - rich bodies ( plastoglobules ) are prevalent in dj1c mutant plastids ( fig. 3c ) .
these grossly malformed chloroplasts explain the albino phenotype of the dj1c mutant seedlings , as these plants cannot develop mature , thylakoid - containing chloroplasts that are capable of supporting photosynthesis .
in contrast , mitochondria from dj1c cotyledon tissue appear normal in these micrographs ( fig. 3d ) .
these plastid ultrastructure abnormalities observed in dj1c mutant tissue indicate that atdj1c functions in early stages of differentiation of proplastids to etioplasts and chloroplasts [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] .
the dj1c mutant seedling - lethal phenotype is rescued by an epitope - tagged version of atdj1c driven by its native promoter our results show that two distinct , recessive dj1c t - dna insertion alleles cause seedling lethality , supporting the conclusion that the phenotype is due to disruption of the dj1c gene .
to demonstrate that albino seedling lethality is due to deficiency of the atdj1c protein , a complementation experiment was performed whereby transgenic plants harboring the pdj1c : gdj1c : gfp expression construct were crossed to the hemizygous dj1c - 1 background .
the f2 progeny were all viable , and both the hemizygous and complemented dj1c mutants were not phenotypically distinguishable from wt ( fig. 4a ) .
pcr - based genotyping ( fig. s1 ) and relative quantitative rt - pcr for native dj1c and the dj1c transgene ( fig. 4 ) verify that the seedling - lethal phenotype can be effectively complemented by a functional , gfp - tagged dj1c .
this not only establishes that absence of the atdj1c protein is responsible for loss of chloroplast integrity but also shows that this gfp - tagged version of atdj1c is functional in vivo .

discussion animal dj - 1 plays an important role in response to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction , and has been independently connected to parkinsonism [ 1 ] and multiple cancers [ 3 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] .
however , despite the importance of dj - 1 for cytoprotection , the protein is not essential for viability in human , mouse , zebrafish or fly [ 18 ] , [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] , [ 47 ] .
in contrast , our results demonstrate that at least one of the three arabidopsis thaliana dj - 1 homologs ( atdj1c ) is required for proper chloroplast development and , therefore , for viability .
this is the first reported example of a lethal knockout of a member of the dj - 1 superfamily and thus provides a useful system in which to investigate the function of dj - 1 in flowering plants .
the requirement for atdj1c in chloroplast development also suggests an intriguing conserved connection between dj - 1 and energy - generating organelles in eukaryotes , as previous work has shown an important role for human dj - 1 in mitochondrial function .
previous studies of plant dj - 1 proteins have focused on atdj1a and brdj - 1 , both of which are upregulated by oxidative stress .
in a study of atdj1a , xu et al. found that the protein conferred protection against diverse stressors and implicated both cu - zn superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase 2 in the protective function of atdj1a [ 33 ] .
while the biochemical details of these two plant dj - 1 proteins' functions are not known , they are similar to the animal dj - 1 homologs in conferring protection against oxidative stress .
in contrast , atdj1c is functionally distinct from other characterized dj - 1 homologs , including its two other close paralogs in arabidopsis .
atdj1c is targeted to developing chloroplasts ( fig. 2 ) , consistent with another report that it is found in plastids [ 33 ] .
moreover , at the sequence level , atdj1c is unusual because it lacks the highly conserved , oxidation - sensitive cysteine residue that was previously identified as functionally essential in several other dj - 1 homologs [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 48 ] .
the absence of this otherwise conserved cysteine in atdj1c indicates that oxidative regulation of dj - 1 function is not a universally conserved feature of the dj - 1 family .
the absence of this cysteine residue may be related to the chloroplast localization of atdj1c , as cysteine content is low is chloroplast proteomes compared to the remainder of the plant cell proteome [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] .
the scarcity of cysteine in chloroplast - resident proteins ( other than those with known redox - sensitive regulatory cysteines ) may reflect an adaptation to the highly reductive redox environment of the chloroplast , which can generate large amounts of ros that would be damaging to sulfur - rich proteins [ 51 ] .
a key structural feature of all known members of the dj - 1 superfamily is that they form dimers ( and sometimes higher oligomers [ 52 ]) with differing interfaces and this oligomerization is important for function in the characterized members of the superfamily [ 31 ] , [ 53 ] .
the plant dj - 1 proteins have a unique gene structure consisting of two dj - 1 domains in a tandem array ( fig. 1 ) , distinguishing them from other members of the dj - 1 superfamily .
the unique gene structure of the plant dj - 1 - like proteins suggests that these plant proteins likely form a dj - 1 - like pseudo - dimer within a single polypeptide .
this interesting feature is also shared by plant genes encoding related pfpi domains as well as other plant proteins with reactive cysteines [ 54 ] .
therefore , domain duplication in plant genes encoding homologs of homodimeric proteins is common , although its evolutionary significance has not yet been fully explored .
we propose that tandem domain fusions in plants , which can be readily identified from genomic data , could be used to identify probable homodimeric protein homologs in other organisms .
the results presented here show that the chloroplast - resident atdj1c protein plays a critical role in plant development .
although there is substantial functional divergence between the plant and animal dj - 1 homologs , the clear homology between these proteins and the wide distribution of dj - 1 proteins in other organisms indicates that they likely share some functional similarities .
the transient expression of atdj1c in newly developing leaf tissue , its relatively low abundance , and the absence of the conserved cysteine residue do not support a likely role for atdj1c in ros scavenging , protein chaperoning , or an occult enzymatic activity , three possible functions that have been suggested for animal dj - 1 .
however , the proposed roles of dj - 1 in cellular regulation at the transcriptional , translational , and protein interaction levels are consistent with the profound consequences of atdj1c deletion in plants and merit further investigation .
materials and methods plant material and growth conditions dj1c t - dna insertion mutants ( salk _ 125439 and salk _ 022772 , ecotype col - 0 ) were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center ( ohio state university , columbus. oh ) .

for genotype determinations , various combinations of oligonucleotide primers ( lb6313r - salk , dj1cgeno - f and dj1geno - r2 ; table s1 ) were used to distinguish wild - type , hemizygous , and homozygous dj1c t - dna insertion mutants .
pcr was performed for 35 cycles ( 94degreesc 60 s , 56degreesc 60 s , 72degreesc 180 s ) in 25 microl reactions containing 200 microm dntps , 1.5 mm mgcl2 , 2 % dmso , 0.4 microm each oligonucleotide primer , taq polymerase , 1x pcr buffer , and 100 ng of template dna .

to produce dj1c with a c - terminal gfp tag driven by the native promoter , the pdj1c : gdj1c : gfp construct was generated by ligating the dj1c ecoicri / smai fragment into ecoicri / bamhi - digested pegs , a binary vector derived from pegfp - n3 ( clontech ) and pegad [ 57 ] .

total rna was isolated using trizol reagent according to manufacturer 's instructions ( invitrogen ) , and rna concentration was determined spectrophotometrically .
reverse transcription was performed for 1 h at 42degreesc in 20 microl reactions containing 1 microg total rna , 500 ng oligo - dt18 primers , 40 u rnasin ( promega ) , 500 microm dntps , and 40 u m - mulv reverse transcriptase ( fermentas ) .
pcr was performed in 25 microl reactions containing 1x econo taq pcr buffer , 1.25 u econo taq pcr enzyme ( lucigen ) , 50 microm dntps and oligonucleotide primers specific for dj1c or actin2 ( table s1 ) for 27 or 25 cycles ( 94degreesc 30 s , 55degreesc 30 s , 72degreesc 90 s ) , respectively .
transcripts corresponding to native dj1c genes were distinguished using a reverse primer that anneals to the 3'utr of the gene ( ojs642 , 3r , table s1 and fig. 3 ) .

background to date , the morbidity of urethral stricture disease among american men has not been analyzed using national datasets .
we sought to analyze the morbidity of urethral stricture disease by measuring the rates of urinary tract infections and urinary incontinence among men with a diagnosis of urethral stricture .
methods we analyzed medicare claims data for 1992 , 1995 , 1998 , and 2001 to estimate the rate of dual diagnoses of urethral stricture with urinary tract infection and with urinary incontinence occurring in the same year among a 5 % sample of beneficiaries .
male medicare beneficiaries receiving co - incident icd - 9 codes indicating diagnoses of urethral stricture and either urinary tract infection or urinary incontinence within the same year were counted .
results the percentage of male patients with a diagnosis of urethral stricture who also were diagnosed with a urinary tract infection was 42 % in 2001 , an increase from 35 % in 1992 .
eleven percent of male medicare beneficiaries with urethral stricture disease in 2001 were diagnosed with urinary incontinence in the same year .
this represents an increase from 8 % in 1992 .
conclusions among male medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with urethral stricture disease in 2001 , 42 % were also diagnosed with a urinary tract infection , and 11 % with incontinence .
although the overall incidence of stricture disease decreased over this time period , these rates of dual diagnoses increased from 1992 to 2001 .
our findings shed light into the health burden of stricture disease on american men .
in order to decrease the morbidity of stricture disease , early definitive management of strictures is warranted .
background although the true incidence of urethral stricture disease in men is unknown , medicare utilization rates for men age 65 and over were 0.9 % in 2001 , a decrease from 1.4 % in 1992 [ 1 ] .
utilization data from the veteran affairs ( va ) in 2003 revealed a prevalence rate of 193 per 100,000 diagnoses ( 0.2 %) [ 2 ] .
urethral stricture disease imposes a great burden on both health and quality of life in men .
previous studies of male urethral stricture disease have shown that nearly 90 % of men present with complications [ 2 ] .
the majority of men with a stricture suffer from obstructive and irritative voiding symptoms , and many experience hematuria , recurrent urinary tract infections , and the need for repeated procedures such as dilation or urethrotomy [ 2 - 5 ] .
more severe complications , including acute urinary retention , urethral carcinoma , renal failure , fournier 's gangrene , and bladder atonia have been reported in a small minority of men with stricture disease [ 2 ] .
the therapy for urethral strictures is also known to be associated with complications that further amplify the burden of disease .
investigations on complication rates following urethrotomy have reported bleeding in 4 - 6 % of cases , infection in 8 - 9 % , incontinence in 1 % , and impotence in 1 % [ 5 - 7 ] .
additionally , strictures tend to recur after urethrotomy or dilation , with success rates varying based on stricture length and location [ 8,9 ] .
long - term success of dilation and urethrotomy for longer strictures greater than two centimeters is less than 35 % [ 10 ] .
men whose strictures recur after a single urethrotomy or dilation are almost invariably likely to fail a second procedure [ 6,7 ] .
although definitive urethroplasty has a very high cure rate with acceptably low morbidity , unfortunately this treatment modality is performed infrequently [ 1 ] .
to better understand the morbidity of urethral stricture disease on american men , we used medicare claims data in order to measure the true association of male urethral stricture disease with both urinary tract infections and urinary incontinence .
methods and irb exemption from ucla was granted for this project , as all data was de - identified .
we analyzed medicare claims data for 1992 , 1995 , 1998 , and 2001 to estimate the rate of dual diagnoses of urethral stricture with urinary tract infection and with urinary incontinence occurring in the same year .
the datasets were derived from the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) administrative records as a 5 % random sample , as previously described .
data from three medicare files , including medicare provider analysis and review ( medpar ) , carrier , and outpatient , were linked to determine beneficiary use in the inpatient , ambulatory surgery center , hospital outpatient , physician office , and emergency room settings .
estimates for disease prevalence were derived from these data files .
for each condition , international classification of diseases , 9th edition ( icd - 9 ) codes for urethral stricture were applied to analytical files from each of the above datasets [ 2 ] .
male medicare beneficiaries receiving co - incident icd - 9 codes indicating diagnoses of urethral stricture and either urinary tract infection or urinary incontinence within the same year were counted .
denominators were derived using the cms enrollment file , which supplied data on all medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the years analyzed .
results were stratified by age , race / ethnicity , and geographic region .
because a 5 % sample of medicare records was used , estimates were obtained by multiplying counts by a constant weight of 20 .
the methodology and analytical methods used to generate these results have been described previously [ 11 ] .
results the percentage of men with a diagnosis of urethral stricture who were also diagnosed with urinary tract infection in the same year increased from 35 % in 1992 to 42 % in 2001 ( additional file 1 : table s1 ) .
this association was seen across all age groups .
additionally , this association was seen across all races analyzed , with the largest association noted in hispanic populations ( 52 - 56 %) .
data was also stratified by location , and all regions of the united states were noted to have comparable associations between urethral stricture disease and urinary tract infections .
there was also a significant association of urethral stricture disease with urinary incontinence .
eleven percent of male medicare beneficiaries with urethral stricture disease in 2001 were diagnosed with urinary incontinence in the same year ( additional file 2 : table s2 ) .
this represents an increase from 8 % in 1992 .
this association spanned all age ranges of male medicare beneficiaries , with increased associations seen with increasing age .
among all races analyzed , hispanics with stricture disease had the highest rate of associated urinary incontinence ( 18 %) .
there was no regional variation appreciated .
discussion although urethral stricture disease is known to be associated with other urologic conditions , the association of urinary tract infection and urinary incontinence with urethral strictures has been largely undefined in large series .
the data presented in this investigation provide evidence of a strong association between male urethral stricture disease and urinary tract infections , occurring as a co - diagnosis in 41 % of male medicare beneficiaries .
the association between male urethral stricture disease and urinary incontinence is also significant , as demonstrated by a co - diagnosis in 11 % of medicare beneficiaries with a diagnosis of urethral stricture disease .
an association of urinary tract infections with urethral strictures has been previously documented .
romero et al analyzed the presentation of 175 patients with urethral stricture disease , of which sixty - three ( 36 %) presented with urinary tract infection [ 12 ] .
urethral strictures incite a condition of urinary stasis , of which urinary tract infection is a known outcome secondary to an increased post - void residual volume [ 12 ] .
frequent instrumentation employed in the diagnosis and management of urethral stricture disease is another potential cause for infection , with introduction of organisms in a retrograde fashion through the urethra , which may then colonize the lower urinary tract .
the association between urethral strictures and urinary incontinence has been previously documented but not well quantified .
following procedures for proximal bulbar urethral stricture disease adjacent to the external sphincter , incontinence is a known potential adverse outcome in men who have undergone previous procedures involving the bladder neck , such as radical prostatectomy , transurethral resection of the prostate , or bladder neck incision .
the reason for increasing rates of both urinary tract infections and urinary incontinence over the 1992 - 2001 time period may be due to new treatments for bph and prostate cancer that have a more severe effect on the urethra .
overall rates of stricture prevalence decreased over the 1992 - 2001 time period , possibly due to lower rates of infectious urethritis , as well as better cure rates of long strictures with the use of urethroplasty with buccal graft augmentation [ 2,13,14 ] .
however , the rate of dual diagnoses of stricture with uti and incontinence increased over this time period .
this may possibly be due to a shift in stricture characteristics toward a more aggressive stricture caused by one of many available treatments for prostate cancer or bph .
urethral stricture disease occurs in up to 8.4 % of men after treatment for prostate cancer [ 15 ] .
this includes men who undergo radical prostatectomy , as well as men who undergo non - surgical therapy such as conformal beam radiation , seed implantation , and cryotherapy .
the tissue effects of such non - surgical treatments can often cause strictures involving the proximal bulbar and membranous urethra .
at the same time , the bladder neck becomes rigid and immobile .
hence , procedures performed to open a proximal bulbar urethral stricture may result in incontinence when the bladder neck is no longer competent .
medicare claims data are particularly useful in that they allow for the estimation of the rates of diagnoses across a large , heterogeneous , nationwide sample of the elderly population across various clinical settings .
however , the use of claims data has several limitations .
medicare claims provide limited clinical information , and we were therefore unable to demonstrate a causal relationship between urethral stricture disease and the other urologic conditions investigated .
additionally , we do not have data indicating whether patients had previously received radiation or other therapy for prostate cancer , which further complicates our ability ascertain whether incontinence occurred strictly as a result of stricture disease .
furthermore , examining claims diagnoses may be inherently inaccurate in some cases .
for example , bladder neck contractures ( icd - 9 code 596.0 ) may be mislabeled as urethral strictures in coding , which may affect our findings .
although not a true urethral stricture , a bladder neck contracture occurring after radical prostatectomy is highly associated with incontinence [ 16 ] .
opening a bladder neck contracture with a bladder neck incision often unmasks incompetence of the external urethral sphincter .
hence , coding a bladder neck contracture as a urethral stricture may have caused us to overestimate the true association of stricture disease with incontinence .
finally , medicare datasets reflect diagnoses among men age 65 and over .
our findings therefore may not be generalizable to younger men with strictures .
conclusions among male medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with urethral stricture disease in 2001 , 42 % were also diagnosed with a urinary tract infection , and 11 % with incontinence .
although the overall incidence of stricture disease decreased over this time period , these rates of dual diagnoses increased from 1992 to 2001 , possibly relating to newer and more aggressive treatments for prostate cancer and bph .
our findings shed light into the health burden of stricture disease on american men .
early urethroplasty has the potential to cure anterior urethral strictures early , significantly decreasing the morbidity of stricture disease described in this paper .

background mycobacterium tuberculosis has a global population structure consisting of six main phylogenetic lineages associated with specific geographic regions and human populations .
one particular m. tuberculosis genotype known as " beijing " has repeatedly been associated with drug resistance and has been emerging in some parts of the world .
" beijing " strains are traditionally defined based on a characteristic spoligotyping pattern .
we used three alternative genotyping techniques to revisit the phylogenetic classification of m. tuberculosis complex ( mtbc ) strains exhibiting the typical " beijing " spoligotyping pattern .
methods and findings mtbc strains were obtained from an ongoing molecular epidemiological study in switzerland and nepal .
mtbc genotyping was performed based on snps , genomic deletions , and 24 - loci miru - vntr .
we identified three mtbc strains from patients originating from tibet , portugal and nepal which exhibited a spoligotyping patterns identical to the classical beijing signature .
however , based on three alternative molecular markers , these strains were assigned to lineage 3 ( also known as delhi / cas ) rather than to lineage 2 ( also known as east - asian lineage ) .
sequencing of the rd207 in one of these strains showed that the deletion responsible for this " pseudo - beijing " spoligotype was about 1,000 base pairs smaller than the usual deletion of rd207 in classical " beijing " strains , which is consistent with an evolutionarily independent deletion event in the direct repeat ( dr ) region of mtbc .
conclusions we provide an example of convergent evolution in the dr locus of mtbc , and highlight the limitation of using spoligotypes for strain classification .
our results indicate that a proportion of " beijing " strains may have been misclassified in the past .
markers that are more phylogenetically robust should be used when exploring strain - specific differences in experimental or clinical phenotypes .
introduction mycobacterium tuberculosis complex ( mtbc ) adapted to humans consist of six main phylogeographical lineages [ 1 ] .
there is increasing evidence that strain diversity in mtbc plays a role in the outcome of infection and disease in tuberculosis ( tb ) [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
one particular mtbc genotype known as " beijing " has repeatedly been associated with drug resistance [ 4 ] and increased virulence in animal models [ 2 ] .
this genotype was first described in 1995 [ 5 ] , and has traditionally been defined based on a characteristic spoligotyping pattern [ 6 ] .
more recently , phylogenetic analyses showed that the beijing strain family belongs to lineage 2 ( known as east asian lineage ) , which is one of the six main human - adapted lineages of mtbc [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
beijing strains are most often isolated in east - and southeast asia , in countries of the former soviet union , and have recently been emerging in south africa [ 1 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
spoligotyping is based on the clustered regulatory short palindromic repeats ( crispr ) region known as the direct repeat ( dr ) locus in mtbc .
this region is characterized by series of direct repeats interspersed by short unique regions called " spacers " [ 11 ] .
the characteristic spoligotyping pattern of beijing strains reflects the loss of the first 34 spacers of a total of 43 used in standard spoligotyping [ 5 ] , [ 10 ] .
repetitive dna sequences like the dr locus exhibit a high rate of change , and convergent evolution can lead to identical genetic character states in phylogenetically unrelated strains ; a phenomenon referred to as homoplasy [ 8 ] .
we recently identified novel snp markers that define the main phylogenetic lineages [ 8 ] , [ 12 ] .
in contrast to spoligotyping , snps in mtbc exhibit almost no homoplasy [ 8 ] .
here we used these snps , combined with genomic deletion and miru - vntr analyses to revisit the phylogenetic classification of mtbc strains exhibiting the classical " beijing " spoligotyping pattern .
methods mtbc isolates were obtained during an ongoing population - based study on the molecular epidemiology of tb in switzerland , and from an ongoing hospital - based study in kathmandu , nepal .
mycobacterial isolates were cultured and dna extracted according to standard laboratory procedures .
spoligotyping was performed as previously described and compared to data published in spoldb4 [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
24 - loci miru - vntr was performed as previously described [ 11 ] , and the data analyzed using the miru - vntrplus online tool ( http :// www.miru - vntrplus.org ) .
determination of the main phylogenetic mtbc lineages was performed by taqman real - time pcr ( taqman , applied biosystems , usa ) using primers ( sigma - aldrich , buchs , switzerland ) , taqman universal mastermix ii and taqman minor groove binder probes ( table 1 ) targeting lineage - specific snps reported previously [ 8 ] , [ 12 ] .
region of difference ( rd ) deletion pcrs were performed for rd105 , rd207 and rd750 [ 15 ] .
pcr products of rd207 were directly sequenced .
all genotyping experiments of the three " pseudo - beijing " isolates described here were repeated at least twice by two independent investigators .

the swiss study was approved by the ethics committee of the canton of berne , switzerland .
written informed consent was obtained from the patient by the treating physicians .
in some cases informed consent could not be obtained because the patient could not be located or was known to have died .
for these cases we obtained permission from the federal expert commission on confidentiality in medical research ( based at the federal office of public health , bern , switzerland ) to use the data provided by the treating physician based on clinical notes .
the study in nepal was approved by the nepal health research council ( nhrc ) , kathmandu , nepal , and the ethics committee of the canton of basel , switzerland .
written informed consent was obtained for all nepalese patients .
results among the isolates recovered in switzerland , we identified a total of 52 that exhibited the characteristic " beijing " spoligotype .
snp - genotyping confirmed that 50 of these ( 96.2 %) belonged to lineage 2 .
two isolates ( 3.8 %) belonged to lineage 3 ( also known as delhi / cas ) .
similarly , among 55 nepalese isolates with a beijing spoligotype , 54 ( 98.2 %) were confirmed as belonging to lineage 2 , while one isolate ( 1.8 %) belonged to lineage 3 ( table 2 ) .
the three lineage 3 isolates were epidemiologically unrelated and were isolated from hiv - negative patients .
the two strains from switzerland were isolated in patients living in switzerland but originating from portugal and tibet , and the strain from nepal was isolated in a patient born and living in nepal .
all but one strains were pan - susceptible ( one isolate with a katg s315t mutation ) .
we found no evidence for a mixed - strain infection or clonal heterogeneity [ 16 ] based on the 24 - loci miru - vntr pattern .

to confirm our snp data , we subjected these three isolates to further molecular investigations .
lineage 2 strains , including all beijing strains , are deleted in rd105 [ 7 ] , [ 10 ] , whereas lineage 3 strains have a deletion in rd750 [ 7 ] .
we found that the three strains of interest had rd105 intact and a deletion in rd750 ( table 1 ) .
in addition , the miru - vntr profiles of these isolates clustered with the lineage 3 strains ( delhi / cas ) rather than with the beijing strains ( figure 1 ) .
the further investigations thus confirmed that these three strains belonged to lineage 3 rather than lineage 2 .

the mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates reported here are highlighted in boxes , reference strains are from the miru - vntrplus database .
the corresponding spoligotyping patterns are shown as a reference but were not included in the construction of the dendogram .
we explored the molecular mechanism by which these lineage 3 isolates acquired their " pseudo - beijing " spoligotyping patterns .
" true " beijing strains harbor a 7,399 base pair ( bp ) deletion in rd207 , which is responsible for the missing spacers 1 - 34 [ 10 ] .
we thus hypothesized that the strains of interest might have acquired a similar but distinct deletion linked to an independent mutational event .
we amplified rd207 [ 15 ] but failed to obtain a product in two of the three strains .
strain 1395 for which our pcr was successful yielded a pcr product that was about 1,000 bp larger than the corresponding product seen in true beijing strains ( figure 2 ) , indicating that the deletion responsible of the " pseudo - beijing " spoligotype in 1395 was about 1000 bp smaller than the classical deletion of rd207 .
direct sequencing of the pcr product showed that the 3 ' - deletion boundary was 1,093 bp upstream ( genbank accession no .
jf789456 ) of the deletion end point for rd207 published previously [ 15 ] .
these results again indicate that the deletion in strain 1395 is distinct from the standard rd207 deletion .
we were unable to determine the exact deletion starting point of this new deletion due to the repetitive nature of the dr region .

discussion in this report we present three cases with mtbc isolates harboring spoligotype patterns identical to the beijing signature , which were assigned to lineage 3 ( also known as delhi / cas ) rather than to lineage 2 ( also known as east - asian ) based on three alternative molecular markers .
we also provide evidence that these strains acquired independent deletion ( s ) in the dr locus of mtbc .
the fact that phylogenetically unrelated mtbc strains can harbor identical or very similar spoligotyping patterns has been observed before [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
the dr locus of mtbc is highly variable , and convergent evolution can lead to homoplasy in spoligotyping patterns [ 8 ] .
even though strain classification based on spoligotyping will assign mtbc strains to the correct phylogenetic lineages in about 90 % of the cases , some strains cannot be classified at all [ 19 ] , and others will be misclassified as shown here .
misclassification of " beijing " strains is particularly relevant given that this strain family has received increased attention over the last few years [ 6 ] .
in addition to their association with clinical drug resistance and hyper - virulence in animal models [ 2 ] , [ 4 ] , beijing strains have been emerging in cape town , south africa [ 9 ] , [ 20 ] , and the canary islands [ 21 ] .
the data presented here suggest that a small fraction of strains traditionally referred to as " beijing " strains might belong to another phylogenetic lineage .
we stress that the prevalence of this phenomenon observed in our study of isolates from switzerland and nepal will not reflect the global m. tuberculosis genetic diversity. of note , the three " pseudo - beijing " strains belonging to lineage 3 were isolated from patients originating from three different countries .
given the mutational dynamics within the dr locus , and the fact that strains harboring the classical beijing spoligotyping pattern are rarely verified using independent molecular markers , it is possible that other so - called " pseudo - beijing " strains might turn out to belong to yet a different mtbc lineage .
further studies are needed to better define the global molecular epidemiology of these strains , including clinical phenotypes .
in conclusion , our case report illustrates an example of convergent evolution in the dr locus of mtbc , and highlights the limitation of using spoligotypes for genotypic classification .
markers that are more phylogenetically robust should be used when looking for associations between particular mtbc genotypes and experimental or epidemiological variables [ 2 ] .
future work should define the global prevalence and phenotypic characteristics of the " pseudo - beijing " strains .

aims hyperlipidaemia model animals have been used to elucidate the role of chlamydia pneumoniae ( cpn ) infection in atherosclerosis .
the aims of this study were to investigate the proatherogenic effect of multiple cpn infections in apob100only / ldlr - / - mice which based on lipid profile can be regarded as the most suitable mouse model of human hypercholesterolemia and to compare the lesion development to that in a major atherosclerosis model apoe - / - mice .
methods and results aorta samples of apob100only / ldlr - / - mice infected three times with cpn were subjected to morphometric analyses .
morphometric evaluation disclosed that cpn infections exacerbated atherosclerosis development in the aortic root and descending aorta of the mice fed with normal diet .
viable cpn was detected in the ascending aorta by rt - pcr .
chlamydial 16srrna expression showed the presence of viable cpn in the aorta of infected animals .
a similar rate of acceleration of atherosclerosis was observed when the infection protocol was applied in apob100only / ldlr - / - and in apoe - / - mice .
conclusion similar to apoe - / - mice , apob100only / ldlr - / - mice with more human - relevant serum lipoprotein composition develop increased atherosclerosis after cpn infections ; thus this mouse strain can be used as a model of infection - related atherosclerosis enhancement and can provide further evidence for the proatherogenic influence of cpn in mice .

introduction atherosclerosis is one of the most frequent causes of death in the world [ 1 ] .
there are several well - known atherosclerosis risk factors , such as diabetes mellitus , smoking , hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , hypercholesterolemia , and abdominal obesity [ 2 , 3 ] .
the knowledge about the contributory mechanisms is incomplete [ 4 ] .
atherosclerosis begins in the early childhood [ 5 ] and has been characterized as a chronic inflammatory disease in which both innate and adaptive immune responses play a role [ 6 ] .
the damage to the endothelium of the arteries is the primary cause of initiation of the development of atherosclerosis .
high plasma low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol concentrations , especially oxidized ldl , contribute to the formation of the atherosclerotic lesions [ 7 , 8 ] .
several infectious agents have been associated with the risk of atherosclerosis [ 9 - 12 ] .
the infections and the accompanying inflammatory response damage the endothelial cells and also stimulate monocytes to secrete proinflammatory cytokines .
numerous studies have demonstrated an association between chlamydia pneumoniae ( cpn ) infection and atherosclerosis [ 12 - 14 ] .
cpn infection is ubiquitous , with 50 % of individuals being seropositive by 20 years of age and approximately 80 % in the elderly [ 13 , 15 ] .
chronic - persistent infections and reinfections are frequent which may contribute through the induced inflammation to atherosclerosis [ 16 ] .
the prevalence of antibodies ranges from 60 to 80 % among patients with cardiovascular diseases [ 17 , 18 ] .
animal models that help to clarify the pathogenic steps and causalities in atherosclerosis play an important role in the current search for new therapeutics beyond the lipid - lowering drugs .
normal mice do not develop atherosclerosis and it requires long - term feeding of a high - fat diet to induce atherogenesis .
however , there are well - established genetically modified inbred mouse lines that allow the investigation of atherosclerosis development in mouse models .
the most frequently used were apoe - deficient ( apoe - / - ) , ldl receptor - deficient ( ldlr - / - ) , and human apob100 transgenic mice which display marked atherogenesis throughout their arterial tree especially when fed with atherogenic diet [ 19 , 20 ] .
in apoe - / - mice , atherosclerosis develops spontaneously .
however , the lipid profile in these mice is distinct from that seen in most humans with atherosclerosis ; that is , apolipoprotein ( apo ) b48 - containing ldl plasma level is high instead of apob100 containing ldl level as in the case of humans with hypercholesterolemia [ 21 , 22 ] .
the mouse strain apob100only ( apob100 / 100 )/ ldlr - / - carries an apob gene with a mutation preventing the expression of apob48 , the truncated form of apob , similar to humans where no apob editing takes place in the liver [ 21 , 23 ] .
ldlr deficiency prevents the uptake of apob100 containing ldl in tissues resulting in high plasma levels of apob100 - containing cholesterol - rich ldl .
the creating authors of this mouse strain described these mice as an authentic model of human familial hypercholesterolemia [ 21 ] .
in mice , intranasal cpn infection causes lower respiratory tract disease similar to that seen in humans with cpn infection .
the infection is followed by dissemination of bacteria [ 24 ] and the chlamydial dna can be detected in the circulation of mice [ 25 ] .
most frequently , acceleration of atherosclerosis was studied after repeated cpn infections which simulated chronic cpn infection of humans in association with diet - induced hyperlipidaemia in c57bl / 6j [ 26 ] , ldlr - / - [ 27 ] , or apoe - / - [ 28 ] mice and mostly found accelerated lesion development .
apob100only / ldlr - / - mice have not been used as a model for the investigation of the effect of cpn infection on the atherosclerosis progression .
our aim was to examine how repeated cpn infection influences the atherosclerotic lesion development in this , based on lipid profile , most suitable mouse model of human hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis .
we compared the extent of atherosclerosis in this model with that seen in the most frequently utilized apoe - / - mouse strain .
2. methods 2.1 .
chlamydia pneumoniae chlamydia pneumoniae , cwl029 strain from american types culture collection ( atcc ) , was used .
cpn was propagated in hep - 2 cells ( atcc ) , as described earlier [ 29 ] .
the partially purified and concentrated elementary bodies ( ebs ) were aliquoted in sucrose - phosphate - glutamic acid buffer ( spg ) and stored at - 80degreesc until use .
chlamydia was quantitated by indirect immunofluorescent method applying anti - chlamydia lipopolysaccharide monoclonal antibody ( abd serotec , oxford , united kingdom ) and fluorescein isothiocyanate - ( fitc - ) labelled anti - mouse igg ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo ) as described earlier [ 30 ] .
the number of infectious bacteria in the cpn stock used for inoculation of mice was expressed as inclusion - forming units ( ifu )/ ml .
2.2 .
mouse strains apob100only / ldl - / - ( b6.129s - ldlrtm1herapobtm2sgy / j ) mice at 8 - 9 or 14 - 15 weeks of age and apoe - deficient ( apoe - / - , b6.129p2 - apoetm1unc / j ) mice at 14 - 15 weeks of age were involved in our studies .
b6.129s - ldlrtm1herapobtm2sgy / j breeding pairs purchased from the jackson laboratory ( bar harbor , me , usa ) and b6.129p2 - apoetm1unc / j breeding pairs purchased from charles river laboratories ( sulzfeld , germany ) were housed and bred under standard conditions .
considering that numerous atherosclerosis - related studies used female mice [ 31 - 34 ] , furthermore it was shown that female mice of both mouse strains develop atherosclerosis , with no gender - related difference in apoe - / - mice and with less extensive lesions in female than in male apob100only / ldlr - / - mice [ 21 , 23 ] ; we chose to work with female mice which were available in sufficient quantity in our breeding colony .
the mice were kept on normal rodent regular chow ( vrf1 , altromin gmbh & co. kg , lage , germany ) or high - fat / high - cholesterol diet containing 21 % milkfat and 1.25 % cholesterol manufactured by altromin gmbh & co. kg according to teklad custom diet formula td.19121 , [ composition , g / kg : casein high protein 195.0 , dl - methionine 3.0 , sucrose 341.46 , corn starch 150.0 , anhydrous milkfat 210.0 , cholesterol 12.5 , cellulose ( fiber ) 39.0 , mineral mix , ain - 76 ( 170915 ) 35.0 , calcium carbonate caco3 4.0 , vitamin mix , teklad ( 40060 ) 10.0 , ethoxyquin ( antioxidant ) 0.04 ] for 12 weeks after the first infection .
all experiments were approved by the animal welfare committee of the university of szeged and conform to the directive 2010 / 63 / eu of the european parliament ( permit number : iii. / 2187 / 2015. ) .
2.3 .
infection with cpn mice were intranasally infected with cpn ; 2 x 105 ifu of cpn in 20 mul pbs were administered intranasally three times with 2 - week intervals under mild anaesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg / kg sodium pentobarbital .
one week after each infection and at the end of the experiment at week 12 , plasma samples with heparinised capillaries ( natelson blood collecting tubes , fisher scientific , pittsburg , pa , usa ) were harvested from the retroorbital plexus under anaesthesia as described above .
for rna detection in the aorta tissue additional groups of mice were infected once and sacrificed 1 and 4 weeks after single infection and 5 weeks after the third infection .
the control animals were left uninfected .
2.4 .
mouse tissue preparation and quantification of atherosclerosis twelve weeks after the first infection with cpn the mice were sacrificed .
in deep pentobarbital sodium anaesthesia ( i.p. injection of 400 mg / kg pentobarbital sodium ) hearts and aortas were perfusion - fixed using 10 % buffered formalin administered through the left ventricle .
the adequacy of anaesthesia was assessed by pedal withdrawal reflex in hind limbs ; mice displaying no locomotor activity were processed .
after formalin - perfusion , the upper part of the heart and the descending aorta were dissected .
aortic sinus samples were also collected for rna extraction from mice anaesthetized as described above .
the basis of the heart was separated from the aorta which was dissected until the iliac bifurcation .
the upper part of the hearts was embedded in paraffin and sectioned for morphometric analyses according to the method described by paigen et al .
[ 35 ]. from the end of the aortic sinus 10 mum sections were prepared until the point where the valve cusps disappeared and stained with hematoxylin eosin .
images of aortic root sections ( 8 sections / mouse , every third sections ) were acquired with a light microscope ( leitz optical microscope ) and olympus c - 7070 digital compact camera .
percentage length of the plaque - covered perimeter of aorta lumen and percentage of aorta lumen area occupied by plaque were analysed with jmicrovision software .
the aortic arch and the adjoining descending aorta were cleared from adjacent tissue and were opened longitudinally .
the aortas were laid flat on black plastic surface and pictures of the longitudinally opened vessels were taken applying the same illumination , magnification , and focal distance using a cmos camera ( dcm 510 ; pixel size : 2.2 mum x 2.2 mum , 2592 x 1944 pixels ; 5 mpixel ; hangzhou scopetek opto - electric co. , ltd. , hangzhou , zheijang , china ) and the scopephoto software ( hangzhou scopetek opto - electric co. , ltd. ) attached to a stereomicroscope ( alpha sto 44 , elektro - optika kft. , erd , hungary ) .
the digital image of the luminal surface was evaluated for the extent of atherosclerosis by tracing and measuring the plaque area and the total luminal surface using jmicrovision software .
the percentage of the luminal area covered by plaque was calculated for each aorta sample .
2.5 .
rna extraction and quantitative real time - pcr aorta sinus with aortic arch for rna extraction was collected from mice ( in deep pentobarbital sodium anaesthesia as described in the previous paragraph ) at the indicated time points after cpn inoculation for one time or three times and pools of 3 samples at each time points were snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen .
aorta samples from noninfected mice were also dissected parallel with the samples collected one week after one infection .
total rna was isolated from the pooled aorta samples with rna extraction kit ( nucleospin rna xs kit , macherey - nagel gmbh , duren , germany ) .
concentration and purity ( od260 / 280 ) of rna was determined by spectrophotometry .
the extracted rna was treated with dnasei ( sigma , st. louis , mo , usa ) .
complementary dna ( cdna ) was synthetized from 1 mug dnase - treated rna with qscript cdna supermix synthesis kit ( quanta biosciences , gaithersburg , md , usa ) .
rna and cdna were stored at - 80degreesc until use. by using cdna as template qrt - pcr was performed with perfecta sybr green supermix ( quanta ) in cfx96 real time c1000 thermal cycler ( biorad , hercules , ca , usa ) .
all experiments involved control reactions containing distilled water as template .
chlamydia 16srrna and mouse beta - actin sequences were amplified .
the sequences of primers used for rt - pcr were the following : cpn 16s rrna : 5 ' - ggcgaaggcgcttttctaa - 3 ' , 5 ' - ccagggtatctaatcctgtttgct - 3 ' [ 36 ] ; mouse beta - actin : 5 ' - tggaatcctgtggcatccatgaaa - 3 ' , 5 ' - taaaacgcagctcagtaacagtccg - 3 ' [ 37 ] .
a blast search was performed to check the specificity of the product target sequence of the primer sets .
the primers were synthesized by integrated dna technologies inc .
( montreal , quebec , canada ) .
the pcr cycles consisted of a 3 min denaturation at 95degreesc followed by 55 cycles each of 10 s of denaturation at 94degreesc , 10 s of annealing at 60degreesc and 10 s of extension at 72degreesc .
the specificity of amplification was confirmed by carrying out a melting curve analysis .
the sensitivity of amplification was controlled using standard as described earlier [ 38 ] .
amplicon standard was generated by amplifying cpn cdna with 16s rrna primers ; amplicons were purified with the pcr clean - up kit ( geneelute pcr clean - up kit , sigma - aldrich ) ; the dna concentration was measured with nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer .
the copy number was calculated using the following formula : copy number / mul = [ 6.022 x 1023 ( molecules / mole ) x dna concentration ( g / mul )]/( number of bases pairs x 660 daltons ) ; and standard curve were generated from 10 - fold serial dilutions of the amplicon ( from 1000,000 to 1 copies ) .
qpcr analysis of the dilution series showed that the sensitivity threshold of our method was ten 16srrna copies .
2.6 .
elisa for detection of cpn - specific antibodies plasma samples of mice collected one week after each infection and at the end of the experiment were tested in duplicate for cpn - specific igg , igm , and iga by an in - house developed elisa test as described earlier [ 25 ] , where np - 40 treated partially purified cpn and similarly treated hep - 2 mock preparation were used as antigens .
briefly , nunc maxisorp elisa plates were coated with cpn and mock antigen ( 0.625 mug protein in 50 mul pbs / well ) , respectively , overnight at 4degreesc .
blocking was done with 1 % skim milk in pbs with 0.05 % tween 20 for 1 h. the serum samples were diluted in 0.4 % skim milk in pbs with 0.05 % tween 20 .
mouse igg , igm , and iga were detected with hrp - anti - mouse igg ( jackson immunoresearch laboratories west grove , pa , usa ) , alpha - mouse iga - hrp ( sigma ) , and anti - mouse igm mu - chain ( ab97260 , abcam , cambridge , uk ) secondary antibodies , respectively .
optical densities ( od - s ) detected on cpn antigen were corrected with od values measured on the control antigen .
cpn - specific igg antibody titres were determined by testing serial 2 - fold dilutions of the serum samples on cpn and control elisa antigen , and reciprocal of the dilution producing od >= 0.1 after correction with od values measured on control antigen was regarded as titre .
geometric mean of titres of individual serum samples was calculated .
for determination of cpn - specific igm and iga levels serum samples were tested at 1 : 50 dilution and determined as the measured and corrected od values .
2.7 .
serum lipoprotein analysis levels of total cholesterol , triglycerides , high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) , and ldl - cholesterol were determined in plasma samples of mice through a service from the department of laboratory medicine , university of szeged , hungary .
2.8 .
statistical analysis data are expressed as mean +/ - sd. independent - samples t - test was used with sigmaplot for windows version 11.0 software .
a p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant difference .
3. results 3.1 .
infection of apob100only / ldlr - / - mice with cpn mice infected 3 times with cpn showed mild symptoms of a disease as ruffled fur and moderate food consumption , especially during the first week after the first infection .
at the time of the first infection half of the mice were given a high - fat / high - cholesterol diet the other half were kept on normal rodent chow .
noninfected mice were kept under similar conditions .
all infected mice produced cpn - specific antibodies which were not seen in the noninfected mice .
normal and high - fat / high - cholesterol diet - fed mice produced similar level of cpn - specific igg antibodies ( od 0.36 - 0.4 at dilution 1 : 100 ) .
3.2 .
repeated cpn infection aggravates atherosclerosis development in the aorta sinus and in the descending aorta of apob100only / ldlr - / - mice kept on normal diet the mice received the first cpn infection at the age of 8 - 9 weeks ; uninfected mice with same age served as controls .
fed with an atherogenic diet very similar pathology was observed in the aorta sinus of the mice that received three chlamydia infections and in those remaining uninfected .
the quantitative evaluation did not disclose significant difference in the length of the plaque - covered perimeter of the lumen ( figure 1 ( a )) nor in the size of the plaque - occupied area in the aorta lumen ( figure 1 ( b )) .
the aorta sections of the normal diet - fed noninfected animals demonstrated very early - stage and small extent of atherosclerosis with a single layer of foam cells .
however , in the aorta sections of repeatedly cpn - infected mice , we observed a significant increase in the length of the plaque - covered perimeter of the lumen ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 1 ( a )) and in the size of the plaque - occupied area in the aorta lumen ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 1 ( b )) compared with that in the noninfected counterpart in normal diet - fed group .
on the luminal surface of the longitudinally opened descending aorta well discernible plaques could be observed .
small areas corresponding to atherosclerotic alteration were seen in the case of the aorta of the noninfected animals fed with normal diet .
the atherosclerosis - affected areas were measured significantly larger in the descending aorta of the infected animals .
in the high - fat / high - cholesterol diet - fed animals , significantly increased plaque - covered spots were visible compared to that in the normal diet - fed mice ; however , the infection did not enhance the lesion formation in this part of the aorta ( figure 1 ( c )) .
3.3 .
viable cpn was detectable in the aorta of apob100only / ldlr - / - mice figure 2 ( a ) shows that the persistence of the bacterium was tested early , that is , one week after the first infection and again four weeks after single infection and at 9 - week and 12 - week time points after three chlamydial infections by rt - pcr .
an equal amount of rna purified from pooled ascending aorta samples of mice was dnase - treated and then reverse - transcribed and mouse beta - actin as housekeeping gene was amplified from all samples .
one and four weeks after single inoculation the expression of chlamydial 16srrna was detectable ( figure 2 ( b )) with a ~ 1000 - fold lower relative expression level at four weeks than at 1 - week time point ( figure 2 ( c )) .
five weeks after the third infection one aorta sample of 2 showed metabolically active cpn in the aorta and the relative expression level was similar to that after single infection at 4 weeks ( figure 2 ( c )) .
at later time point , our test was not able to detect chlamydial gene expression .
3.4 .
infection of apob100only / ldlr - / - and apoe - / - mice with cpn induces similar kinetics of antibody production based on the above results , we aimed at performing a comparative experiment by applying our infection protocol both in apob100only / ldlr - / - and in apoe - / - mice ( 14 - 15 weeks of age ) while keeping them on a nonatherogenic diet .
the humoral immune response induced by the infections was compared by measuring the titre of cpn - specific igg antibodies ( figure 3 ( a )) and the level of igm ( figure 3 ( b )) and iga ( figure 3 ( c )) antibodies one week after all three infections and at the end of the experiment .
the level of antibody response did not differ significantly in the two mouse strains .
the iga level tended to be lower in apoe - / - mice ( figure 3 ( c )) ; however , the difference was not significant .
two independent experiments gave similar results .
3.5 .
the extent of atherosclerosis is similarly increased in the aorta of cpn - infected and normal diet - fed apob100only / ldlr - / - and apoe - / - mice in normal chow - fed apob100only / ldlr - / - mice at the age of 24 - 25 weeks the lesions consisted of mainly single or multiple layers of macrophage foam cells but some more advanced plaques with cholesterol crystals and necrotic core were also seen .
in apoe - / - mice at same age more numerous advanced lesions with necrotic core and cholesterol cleft were found .
in cpn - infected apob100only / ldlr - / - mice larger advanced plaques and in infected apoe - / - mice more plaques with necrotic core and accumulated cholesterol crystals appeared .
representative sections from the experimental groups are shown in figure 4 ( a ) .
the measurements proved that in apoe - / - mice the atherosclerosis was more pronounced than in apob100only / ldlr - / - mice .
the difference was seen in respect of the size of plaque - occupied lumen area in the aortic sinus ( figure 4 ( b )) and the length of the plaque - covered aorta surface in the lumen ( figure 4 ( c )) .
lesions in the descending aorta also were larger in apoe - / - mice than in apob100only / ldlr - / - mice ( figures 4 ( d ) and 4 ( e )) .
when the effect of cpn infection was analysed , significant enhancement in the measured values was found .
the plaque - covered perimeter of the lumen in the aorta sinus sections ( figure 4 ( b )) , the plaque - occupied lumen area ( figure 4 ( c )) , and the plaque size in the descending aorta ( figure 4 ( e )) increased 2.08 - fold ( p = 0.035 ) , 1.7 - fold ( p = 0.004 ) , and 2.5 - fold ( p = 0.001 ) , respectively , in apob100only / ldlr - / - and 2.04 - fold ( p = 0.019 ) , 1.32 - fold ( p = 0.026 ) , and 2.56 - fold ( p = 0.002 ) , respectively , in apoe - / - mice .
3.6 .
plasma lipid levels in apob100only / ldlr - / - and apoe - / - mice plasma samples of mice were tested for lipid levels .
at each tested time point irrespective of the infection status apoe - / - mice carried a higher level of total cholesterol than the apob100only / ldlr - / - mice ( figure 5 ( a )) .
in the plasma of uninfected apob100only / ldlr - / - mice the triglyceride concentration was elevated compared to that in apoe - / - mice ( figure 5 ( b )) .
infection one or two times did not cause increase in triglyceride level , but the third cpn inoculation resulted in a significant elevation ( p = 0.001 ) in apoe - / - mice .
in apob100only / ldlr - / - mice no infection - related change in triglyceride level was obvious ( figure 5 ( b )) .
plasma concentration of ldl was higher in apoe - / - mice than in apob100only / ldlr - / - mice ( figure 5 ( c )) .
infection - related significant increase in ldl level was associated with the first infection in apob100only / ldlr - / - mice only ( p = 0.04 ) .
hdl plasma concentration was generally higher in apob100only / ldlr - / - mice than in apoe - / - mice and in these mice the concentration decreased by the end of the observation period but remained high in apob100only / ldlr - / - mice ( figure 5 ( d )) .
no infection - associated change in hdl level was detected .
4. discussion apoe - / - mice are widely used as animal models of atherosclerosis ; however , the lipoprotein metabolism of this mouse strain is different from that in humans with hypercholesterolemia .
apoe - / - mice accumulate in their plasma large quantities of apob48 containing lipoprotein of the very low - density lipoprotein ( vldl ) class while humans with atherosclerosis almost always have high level of cholesterol - rich ldl containing apob100 [ 23 , 31 ] .
many publications investigating the relation of cpn with atherosclerosis have used this model to disclose the nature of the association between infection with this pathogen and initiation and / or acceleration of atherosclerosis [ 28 , 39 - 42 ] .
it has been suggested that cpn infection exacerbates atherosclerosis in conjunction with hyperlipidaemia ; however , apoe deficiency might influence the immune response to this pathogen and provides increased resistance to vascular infection [ 41 ] .
we aimed at examining the influence of repeated cpn infection on the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in apob100only / ldlr - / - mouse strain another model for lipoprotein abnormalities which can be regarded as the most faithful model of human familial hypercholesterolemia [ 21 ] .
apob100only / ldlr - / - mouse strain was created by genetic modification , so that majority of their plasma cholesterol is in the ldl class with apob100 and develops atherosclerosis on low - fat , chow diet .
first , we wanted to establish that apob100only / ldlr - / - mice can serve as a model for investigating the role of cpn in atherosclerosis .
therefore groups of mice were fed with a normal or high - fat / high - cholesterol diet and were repeatedly infected with cpn or left uninfected , and development of atherosclerosis was followed .
as our experiments showed , in apob100only / ldlr - / - mice which were fed with normal diet repeated three cpn infections resulted in an enhanced atherosclerosis development in the aortic sinus and the descending aorta .
high - fat / high - cholesterol diet - induced enhanced atherosclerosis was not exacerbated by cpn infections .
thus all further experiments were done with mice kept on normal diet .
as it is said that cpn acts in cooperation with hyperlipidaemia it seems that the effect of hyperlipidaemia in apob100only / ldlr - / - mice can be aggravated by cpn infection but cpn does not exacerbate atherosclerosis further in the presence of high - fat / high - cholesterol diet [ 43 - 45 ] .
nevertheless , the bacterium influenced the course of atherosclerosis development indicating that apob100only / ldlr - / - mice are suitable for further research .
our results are consistent with findings of moazed et al. who described atherosclerosis - accelerating effect of cpn infection in apoe - / - mice eating regular chow diet [ 44 ] .
however , atherosclerosis was also exacerbated in apoe - / - mice kept on high - fat diet by single or 3 repeated cpn infections [ 39 , 46 ] .
we hypothesized that , based on the genetic difference between apob100only / ldlr - / - and apoe - / - mice , features that characterize cpn infection or atherosclerosis may also differ , and therefore we compared the effects of the bacterium in these mouse strains .
in our infection model the successful infection was demonstrated by detecting cpn - specific igg , iga , and igm antibodies in the mice throughout the course of the experiment and at the time of sacrifice .
when igg antibody level was compared in apob100only / ldlr - / - and apoe - / - mice , no significant difference was observed .
nazzal et al .
[ 41 ] reported that apoe - / - mice produced more cpn - specific antibodies than wild - type mice which was attributed to apoe deficiency .
our results do not support this suggestion considering that in apob100only / ldlr - / - mice repeated cpn infection led to high level of antibody production without the contribution of apoe deficiency .
not only was antibody response the sign of infection , but we were able to detect metabolically active cpn in the aorta samples for nine weeks after the first infection .
previous studies demonstrated the presence of cpn in the aorta of repeatedly infected apoe - / - mice by isolating the bacterium early two weeks after infection .
furthermore , bacterial dna was amplified by pcr at later time points [ 47 ] .
as reviewed by campbell and rosenfeld [ 48 ] several lines of evidence point to the ability of cpn to establish persistent infection in vivo .
our results provide additional information about persisting chlamydia as 16srrna gene transcripts suggest metabolically active bacteria not only persisting dna or antigen late after repeated infections .
long - term presence of viable chlamydia in the aorta tissues of some infected mice might contribute to the atherogenic effect of the infection .
in female apoe - / - mice we have disclosed more advanced atherosclerosis than in apob100only / ldlr - / - mice at the same age at the end of the 12 - week observation period .
less pronounced difference was disclosed by powell - braxton et al .
[ 21 ] .
nevertheless , in apoe - / - mice , similar to apob100only / ldlr - / - mice , the infection resulted in an enhanced lesion formation without the need of feeding the mice with high - fat diet confirming the results with apoe - / - mice of moazed et al .
[ 44 ] .
it has been described that cpn can cause hepatic fatty acid imbalance [ 49 ] dysregulation of lipid metabolic genes in the liver [ 50 ] and altered macrophage cholesterol homeostasis [ 51 ] ; however , most of the studies in mice did not detect major changes in plasma lipid profile after cpn infection [ 34 , 39 ] .
increase in triglyceride concentration after repeated infection of apoe - / - mice similarly to our results has been noted by rothstein et al .
[ 33 ] .
the reason of increase in triglyceride level in chronic infection induced by multiple inoculations in apoe - / - mice may be the absence of apoe .
apoe is known to provide protection against the inflammation induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide [ 52 ] and the inflammation related change in lipid metabolism [ 53 ] .
early increase of ldl level in apob100only / ldlr - / - mice after primary infection may also be due to the primary infection caused inflammation [ 54 ] .
our findings are concordant with results of a study by kontula et al .
[ 55 ] suggesting a significant association between chronic infection with cpn and increased risk of coronary heart disease in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia .
5. conclusion in the field of infection - related exacerbation of atherosclerosis , the apob100only / ldlr - / - mouse strain has not been utilized .
according to our results the infection is followed by long - lasting vascular infection in this mouse strain contributing to the potential direct effect of the infection in the vessel wall .
as apoe deficiency may alter the immune response against cpn infection compared to wild - type mice , apob100only / ldlr - / - mice might provide additional information regarding the immune mechanisms participating in the cpn induced acceleration of atherosclerosis .
the results of our experiments further support the proatherogenic role of cpn infection in a model of human familial hypercholesterolemia .
as repeated cpn inoculation is able to aggravate lesion development in association with the lipoprotein abnormalities without feeding high - fat / high - cholesterol diet to these mice , we suggest using this mouse strain as an alternative model to investigate the role of infection in atherosclerosis development .

background depression is a common comorbidity among patients with type 2 diabetes .
there are several reports supporting a bidirectional association between depression and type 2 diabetes .
however , there is limited data from non - western countries .
therefore , the aim of this study was to assess the sociodemographic , clinical , and psychosocial factors associated with co - morbid depression among type 2 diabetic outpatients presenting to black lion general specialized hospital , addis ababa , ethiopia .
methods this institution based cross - sectional study design was conducted on a random sample of 276 type 2 diabetic outpatients .
type 2 diabetes patients were evaluated for depression by administering a validated nine - item patient health questionnaire ( phq - 9 ) .
risk factors for depression among type 2 diabetes patients were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis .
result in total , 264 study participants were interviewed with a response rate of 95.6 % .
the prevalence of depression was 44.7 % .
in the multivariate analysis , the statistically significant risk factors for depression were monthly family income <= 650 ( p - value = 0.056 ; or = 2.0 ; 95 % ci = 1.01 , 4.2 ) , presence of >= 3 diabetic complications ( p - value = 0.03 ; or = 3.3 ; 95 % ci = 1.1 , 10.0 ) , diabetic nephropathy ( p - value = 0.01 ; or = 2.9 ; 95 % ci = 1.2 , 6.7 ) , negative life events ( p - value = 0.01 ; or = 2.4 ; 95 % ci = 1.2 , 4.5 ) , and poor social support ( p - value = 0.001 ; or = 2.7 ; 95 % ci = 1.5 , 5.0 ) .
conclusion this study demonstrated that depression is a common co - morbid health problem with a prevalence rate of 44.7 % .
the presence of diabetic complications , low monthly family income , diabetic nephropathy , negative life event , and poor social support were the statistically significant risk factors associated with depression .
we presume that the burden of mental health especially depression is high in the population with type 2 diabetes mellitus co - morbidity .
therefore , specific attention is needed to diagnose early and treat promptly .

keywords diabetes depression sociodemographic factors clinical factors psychosocial factors outpatient ethiopia cross - sectional study issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background the mental health consequences of diabetes have been studied by a number of research teams and they have reported bidirectional associations between depression and type 2 diabetes [ 1 , 2 ] .
in this study , we focused on the influence of type 2 diabetic associated problems on the presence of depressive symptoms .
based on the literature we classify these potential risk factors as sociodemographic , clinical , and psychosocial factors .
several studies have shown that sociodemographic risk factors affect the development of co - morbid depression among diabetic patients .
the prevalence rates of depression were significantly higher in females with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with males with type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 3 - 6 ] , varying from a doubled percentage for women than for men [ 7 ] and more than three times higher in women compared with men [ 3 ] .
other sociodemographic risk factors that were significantly associated with depression in people with diabetes includes age at diabetes diagnosis [ 8 , 9 ] , low socioeconomic status [ 3 , 4 , 6 , 10 ] , low educational status [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] , being unmarried [ 1 , 4 , 9 ] , urban dwelling [ 3 ] , nature of relationship with sexual partners [ 11 ] , ethnicity / race [ 12 , 13 ] , smoking habits [ 14 - 16 ] , physical activity [ 14 ] , sedentary life [ 8 ] , and unemployment [ 17 ] .
some other studies , however , found that gender , age , residence , educational status , ethnicity , marital status , employment status , and socioeconomic status had no significant association with depression in diabetes patients [ 11 , 17 - 19 ] .
the effects of clinical and psychosocial factors on co - morbid depression have been supported by different studies as well .
these factors encompass financial stress [ 1 , 19 , 20 ] , poor social support [ 1 , 4 ] , negative life events [ 1 , 19 , 20 ] , poor quality of life [ 20 , 21 ] , and medication burden [ 19 , 22 ] .
depression was most strongly associated with functional impairment [ 1 ] , large waist circumference [ 19 ] , glycosylated hemoglobin level [ 1 , 3 ] , body mass index [ 7 , 12 ] , blood glucose level [ 3 ] , diabetic retinopathy [ 23 ] , diabetic neuropathy [ 1 , 12 , 19 , 23 ] , diabetic nephropathy [ 19 , 23 ] , peripheral vascular disease [ 19 , 23 ] , diabetic foot ulcer [ 19 ] , coronary vascular disease [ 23 ] , ischemic heart disease [ 16 , 23 ] , arteriosclerotic vascular disease [ 23 ] , heart disorder [ 3 ] , type of diabetic treatment [ 3 , 24 ] , and sexual dysfunction [ 23 ] .
on the contrary depression was not significantly associated with poor body weight control , insulin treatment users , duration of diabetes , glycosylated hemoglobin ( hba1c ) , obesity , hypertensive disorder , retinopathy [ 3 , 12 , 17 , 18 ] .
the major barriers in diagnosing depression among type 2 diabetic patients were the lack of screening tool , time constraints , and overlapping of physical and cognitive symptoms [ 3 , 25 ] .
thus , there are various sociodemographic , clinical , and psychosocial factors related to depression in type 2 diabetes mellitus .
identifying the significant predictors of depression is important to develop need - based clinical and community - based mental health interventions .
although these factors have been found to be associated with depression , most of these studies were based on western samples , with only some exceptions .
therefore , we do not know whether these findings can be generalized to a non - western setting .
thus in the present study , we aimed to identify factors influencing the risk of co - morbid depression among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients treated at the black lion general specialized hospital in ethiopia .
we hypothesized that the same identified factors were associated with depression in this non - western sample .
methods study site black lion general specialized hospital ( tikur anbessa in amharic ) , located in the nation 's capital addis ababa , is ethiopia 's largest general public hospital and one of university hospitals in the country .
the hospital provides a tertiary level referral treatment and is open for 24 h for emergency services .
black lion hospital offers diagnosis and treatment for approximately 370,000 - 400,000 patients a year [ 26 ] .
subjects and procedures we conducted an institution based cross - sectional study design among 276 type 2 diabetic outpatients selected using systematic random sampling techniques from april 23 , 2013 to may 13 , 2013 .
inclusion criteria were : ( i ) diagnosed as type 2 diabetic patients for at least one year , ( ii ) age >= 20 years old , and ( iii ) capable of independent communication and giving informed verbal consent .
individuals who were currently being treated for depression or other psychological problems ( e.g. anxiety or personality disorders ) as ascertained at recruitment were excluded .
patients with established type 2 diabetes mellitus were evaluated for depression by administering a validated nine - item questionnaire phq - 9 ( amharic version - local language ) [ 29 ] .
variables the outcome variable is depression .
the explanatory variables are sociodemographic , clinical , and psychosocial factors that were collected by patient interview and medical record review .
tool reliability assessment cronbach 's alpha for the phq - 9 scale was 0.72 indicating acceptable consistency of this psychometric scale for the study population .
the correlations between nine items of the phq - 9 and total phq - 9 scores ranged from 0.22 to 0.69 , and all correlations were significant at the 0.01 level .
data analysis after checking collected data visually for completeness , the response was coded and entered into the computer using epi info version 3.5.1 .
statistical packages , and then 10 % of the responses was randomly selected and checked for the consistency of data entry .
then printed frequencies were used for checking of outliers and to clean data .
data was cleaned accordingly and then exported to spss ( statistical package for social science ) version 20.0 ( ibm spss corp. ) .
cleaned raw data is available as an additional file in a comma delimited (*. csv ) format [ additional file 1 ] .
the frequency distribution of dependent and independent variables was worked out .
multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to identify statistically significant associated risk factors using significance level ( alpha ) 0.05 .
odds ratios were calculated to determine the strength of associations of selected variables .
the study was adherent to the strobe criteria as outlined in additional file 2 .
result sociodemographic characteristics in total , 264 study participants were interviewed with a response rate of 95.6 % .
non response was due to participant 's lack of interest to participate , shortage of time , and critical illness. of the interviewed participants 53.0 % ( n = 140 ) were female , 69.3 % ( n = 183 ) were married , 80.7 % ( n = 213 ) were orthodox christian , and 57.2 % ( n = 151 ) were amhara .
in addition , the mean +/ - sd age at diagnosis and current age of the subjects were 43.9 +/ - 10.9 and 55.9 +/ - 10.9 years , respectively .
besides , 86.4 % ( n = 228 ) lived in addis ababa , and 61.7 % ( n = 163 ) had a waist circumference of >= 95 cm ( mean +/ - sd , 98.9 + 11.1 ) .
the median monthly income of the family was 750 etb ( 651 - 1400 etb ) and 33.7 % ( n = 89 ) had attended college / university level education .
clinical characteristics one hundred forty five patients ( 43.2 %) were on oral hypoglycemic treatment , 78.3 % ( n = 141 ) had cardiovascular diseases ( hypertension and heart failure ) , and 69.7 % ( n = 140 ) had diabetic retinopathy .
more than half ( 58.7 % , n = 155 ) of study participants reported 1 to 2 co - morbid disease ( mean +/ - sd , 1.1 +/ - 0.9 ) .
similarly , half of the respondents ( n = 132 ) had a bmi <= 24.9 kg / m2 ( mean +/ - sd , 25.4 +/ - 3.7 ) .
regarding the laboratory reported fasting blood glucose level , 12.9 % ( n = 34 ) had <= 100 mg / dl , 19.7 % ( n = 52 ) 101 - 126 mg / dl , and 67.4 % ( n = 178 ) had >= 127 mg / dl. prevalence of depression the mean +/ - sd of phq 9 score was 5.2 +/ - 4.6 .
twenty - five ( 9.5 %) type 2 diabetic outpatients did not report any of depressive symptoms , but 28.4 % of type 2 diabetic outpatients , fulfilled the criteria for mild depression , 12.1 % for moderate depression , 2.7 % for moderately severe depression , and 1.5 % for severe depression .
thus , the overall prevalence rate of depression was 44.7 % .
statistical analysis as revealed in table 1 , the prevalence of depressive symptoms was two times higher in female type 2 diabetic patients compared with male .
this was found statistically significant .
other demographic variable that found risk for depression and statistically significant was monthly family income .

unfortunately , in spite of the high impact of depression and diabetes comorbidity on the individual and its importance as a public health problem , little is known about the existence of depression in people with diabetes in ethiopia .
to our knowledge , this is the first study to assess sociodemographic , clinical , and psychosocial factors related to type 2 diabetes mellitus causing depression in a large sample .
this study has tried to address this issue by identifying factors associated with depression in type 2 diabetic outpatients .
in this study low family monthly income was the significant independent predictor of depression .
this result was consistent with other studies report [ 3 , 4 , 6 , 10 ] .
we found that sex , residence , marital status , ethnicity , educational status , waist circumference , current age , and age at diagnosis were not associated factors for depression .
this study finding was also in line with several previous studies [ 11 , 14 , 17 , 27 ] .
however , many earlier published articles reported the prevalence rates of depression were significantly higher in females with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with males with type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 3 - 5 , 8 - 11 ] .
other demographic risk factors that were significantly associated in varying degree with depression in people with diabetes includes age at diabetes diagnosis [ 8 , 9 ] , low educational level [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] , being unmarried [ 1 , 4 , 7 ] , urban residence [ 3 ] , nature of relationship with sexual partners [ 11 ] , ethnicity / race [ 12 , 13 ] , smoking habits [ 14 - 16 ] , physical activity [ 14 ] , sedentary life [ 8 ] , and unemployment [ 17 ] .
this discrepancy was might be due to variation in study design , demographic characteristics of respondents , and selection method of respondents .
regarding the clinical characteristics of participants , earlier studies conducted in different setting revealed depression was most strongly associated with large waist circumference [ 19 ] , body mass index [ 7 , 12 ] , blood sugar level [ 3 ] , diabetic retinopathy [ 23 ] , diabetic neuropathy [ 1 , 12 , 19 , 23 ] , diabetic nephropathy [ 19 , 23 ] , peripherovascular disease [ 19 , 23 ] , diabetic foot ulcer [ 19 ] , coronary vascular disease [ 23 ] , ischemic heart disease [ 16 , 23 ] , arteriosclerotic vascular disease [ 23 ] , heart disorder [ 3 ] , type of diabetic treatment [ 3 , 24 ] , and sexual dysfunction [ 23 ] .
similarly , the result of this study demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of depression in type 2 diabetic outpatients with the presence of >= 3 diabetic complication and diabetic nephropathy .
on the contrary depression was not significantly associated with diabetes treatment regimen co - morbid disease ( cardiovascular , respiratory , renal , neurologic ) , complication of diabetes ( retinopathy , neuropathy , sexual dysfunction ) , duration of diabetes , duration of diabetes treatment , fasting blood sugar , body mass index , number of co - morbidity , number of prescribed medication administration per day , and physical disability .
this variation might be due to the level of country development , time frame , study setting , and lifestyle variation .
moreover , we found out negative life events and poor social support were a statistically significantly psychosocial risk factor for depression .
in line with this study the psychosocial factors that had a significant association with co - morbid depression comprises poor social support [ 2 , 4 ] and experience chronic stressors or negative life events [ 2 , 14 , 17 ] .
previous studies also support increased health care costs / financial stress [ 2 , 14 , 20 ] and pill burden [ 14 , 24 ] were associated factors for depression .
disparately , in this study high health care cost and medication burden were not associated with depression .
the outcomes of this study have implications for health care practice in black lion general specialized hospital and other health care organizations , where clinician 's diagnosis of psychiatric disorders rate is inadequate because of the high patient load , lack of screening tool , and poor undergraduate or in - service training in these skills .
principally this study has a presumption that the burden of mental health especially depression is high in the population with type 2 diabetes mellitus co - morbidity and requires attention to diagnose early and treat promptly .
laboratory test results and pharmacological treatment plan are not adequate to scaling up service delivery and bring about the expected change .
limitations and strengths the strengths of this study include a high response rate and the inclusive nature of this research as individuals could participate regardless of literacy level .
including patients from different ethnic backgrounds in addis ababa and outside addis ababa was a further strength .
additionally , rather than having to rely on self - report , health - related information was collected from patients' medical records .
even though the association was temporary , depression and type 2 diabetes mellitus were causally related and deserves attention from clinicians to ensure better management .
also , a reasonable sample size and ascertaining depression with culturally standardized questionnaires are strengths of this study .
since it was the first study in type , it will provide basic information for those who are interested .
however , an important limitation of this study was that a psychiatric diagnostic interview which is considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis of depression was not used .
additionally , there was an absence of similar study done in ethiopia health care setting to compare the finding .
moreover , due to cross - sectional nature of the study , causal relationships between depression and type 2 diabetes mellitus cannot be assumed .
conclusion in conclusion , this study demonstrated that depression is a common co - morbid health problem in type 2 diabetic out - patients in black lion general specialized hospital with a prevalence rate of 44.7 % .
within this sample of outpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , the study found that low monthly family income , presence of >= 3 diabetic complications , diabetic nephropathy , negative life event , and poor social support were highly statistically significant risk factors associated with depression .
all the result should be interpreted cautiously and further prospective longitudinal research focusses on these sociodemographic and clinical factors in the different clinical group should be conducted .
finally , we presumed the burden of mental health especially depression is high in the population with type 2 diabetes mellitus co - morbidity and requires attention to diagnose early and treat promptly .

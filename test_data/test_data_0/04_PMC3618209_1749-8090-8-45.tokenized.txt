background as high - risk cardiac patients frequently remain within hospital while waiting for surgery , the aim of the present study was to determine the role of preoperative length of hospital stay on mediastinitis , and also , to assess contemporary risk factors for this complication .
methods the source population consisted of 6653 consecutive patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery , valve surgery , or both between september 2000 and september 2009 at a single tertiary care hospital .
a retrospective cohort analysis was used to assess the effect of 18 preoperative variables , including length of stay , on mediastinitis .
results mediastinitis developed in 108 patients ( 1.6 %) resulting in an in - hospital mortality rate of 13.9 % .
independent predictors of mediastinitis included obesity ( 2.59 , ci 1.58 - 4.23 ) , copd ( 2.44 , ci 1.55 - 3.84 ) , diabetes ( 2.16 , ci 1.44 - 3.24 ) , and impaired estimated glomerular filtration rate .
preoperative hospital stay was also found to be an independent risk factor leading to a 15 % increased risk of mediastinitis per week of stay .
the primary wound pathogen was coagulase negative staphylococcus ( 82 %) followed by multi - flora isolates ( 49 %) , but was unrelated to hospital stay .
conclusions in addition to the traditional risk factors , prolonged preoperative hospital stay is also a significant and potentially modifiable predictor for the development of mediastinitis following cardiac surgery .
all efforts should be made to minimize the delay in operating on hospitalized patients awaiting heart surgery .
background despite improved surgical techniques and preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis , surgical site infections , more specifically mediastinitis , remains a potentially fatal complication after open - heart surgery with an incidence of 0.6 % - 2.65 % [ 1 - 5 ] .
in - hospital mortality ranges from 14 to 23 % , even when mediastinitis is correctly treated [ 6,7 ] , and it has been shown to have a significant impact on hospital costs [ 8 ] .
well - described risk factors for mediastinitis include diabetes mellitus , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) , obesity , as well as harvesting of bilateral internal mammary arteries [ 9 - 12 ] .
in many canadian provinces , patients too precarious to wait at home , often stay in hospital for an extended period before surgery can be performed .
there are many reasons for this situation , which may include restricted operating room access , lack of icu beds , or delays due to more urgent cases [ 13 ] .
knowing that hospital stay may predispose a patient to skin colonization with more virulent hospital - based pathogens , we hypothesized that a prolonged preoperative hospital stay would also result in an increased incidence of mediastinitis .
the consequences of prolonged preoperative hospital stay on cardiac surgical outcome have not been previously studied .
the aim of the present study , therefore , was to identify preoperative risk factors for mediastinitis in current practice , and to assess the role of preoperative length of stay on deep sternal wound infection in the context of increasing surgical delays .
methods study population and study design the study population comprised of 6653 consecutive adult patients undergoing median sternotomy during the period between september 2000 and september 2009 at a single tertiary care hospital in montreal , canada .
heart transplant patients , adult congenital and patients receiving ventricular assist devices were excluded from this cohort .
preoperative variables that were collected prospectively as part of a clinical registry maintained by the division of cardiac surgery included the following : age , sex , obesity , ejection fraction , type of operation ( coronary , valve , or combined procedures ) , smoking , diabetes mellitus , copd , chronic renal failure ( crf ) , preoperative creatinine , preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) , congestive heart failure ( chf ) , hypertension , redo surgery , left main coronary disease , preoperative hospital length of stay , operative status ( elective , urgent , or emergent ) , and parsonnet score .
any missing data was obtained by reviewing individual patient charts at the time of the study .
this study was approved by the mcgill university health center research ethics board .
definitions mediastinitis was defined according to the center for disease control and prevention criteria [ 14 ] ; however , all suspected cases were also confirmed by ct scan imaging of the chest .
superficial wound infections sparing the sternum were not classified as mediastinitis .
estimated glomerular filtration rate was derived using the ckd - epi study equation using the preoperative serum creatinine value closest to the date of surgery [ 15 ] .
preoperative hospital length of stay was calculated as the number of days from hospital admission ( under any service ) until the day of surgery .
the calculation of parsonnet score has been previously described [ 16 ] .
obesity was defined as bmi greater than 30 kg / m2 .
operative status was categorized as : emergent if the patient 's cardiac disease dictated that surgery be performed within hours outside of regular operating hours ; urgent if the patient 's cardiac disease required the patient to remain in the hospital until the operation was performed ; and elective if the patient 's clinical status allowed discharge from the hospital and readmission at a later date [ 17 ] .
infection prophylaxis and operative technique all patients receive a 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate shower and mupirocin 2 % ointment to both nostrils the night prior to surgery as well as the morning of. antibiotic prophylaxis is given as cefazolin 2 grams intravenously 30 minutes before skin incision and again after 4 hours .
additional doses are given every 4 hours , if required , until termination of the surgery .
patients undergoing valvular surgery , have a penicillin allergy , or who are methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) positive receive vancomycin 1 gram intravenously 30 minutes before skin incision .
removal of excess hair at the sternum , groin , and appropriate leg is performed with clippers in the operating suite .
all patients are disinfected with baxedine ( c ) ( chlorhexidine 2 % w / 70 % v / v alcohol solution ) in the operating room prior to incision .
cardiopulmonary bypass was performed using non - pulsatile flow .
cold blood cardioplegia was used to induce and maintain cardioplegic arrest .
patients are kept at mild hypothermia throughout cardiopulmonary bypass ( lowest nasopharyngeal temperature 32degreesc ) .
the left internal mammary artery , when required as per discretion of the surgeon , was harvested as a pedicle using electrocautery in all cases .
sternal closure was performed using seven or eight no.5 stainless steel wires .
in the immediate 24 hr postoperative period , an insulin infusion titrated to a blood glucose defined by the intensive care physician was administered if blood glucose levels exceed 10 mmol / l. the insulin infusion was discontinued once the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgical intermediate care unit .
statistical analysis patient characteristics are expressed as proportions , means and standard deviations , or medians and interquartile ranges , as appropriate .
a natural log transformation was made to parsonnet score , since its distribution was highly skewed .
logistic regression was used to examine the association of various demographic , comorbidity , and preoperative laboratory variables with mediastinitis .
models were adjusted for covariates that were significant at the univariate level .
the hosmer lameshow goodness - of - fit test was used to assess calibration of the logistic regression model , by assessing the observed and predicted event rates in subgroups ( deciles ) of the model population .
a p - value threshold of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance .
all analyses were carried out using sas version 9.1 ( sas institute inc. , cary , nc ) .
results patient characteristics and incidence of mediastinitis during the 9 - year period from september 2000 to september 2009 , 6653 patients underwent cardiac surgery resulting in 108 ( 1.6 %) cases of mediastinitis. of these , 87 included coronary artery bypass grafting surgery ( cabg ) with use of a single internal mammary artery , 16 included cabg without any mammary artery , while 5 were isolated valve cases .
the overall distribution of operations included isolated cabg at 64.9 % , isolated valve in 15.4 % of cases , and combined valve and cabg in 14.9 % of cases .
table 1 describes the baseline characteristics of the study population .
the mean age of the patients was 66.1 years with the majority having a systolic ejection fraction of more than 50 % .
the mean parsonnet score was 18.7 +/ - 13.3 leading to a mean predicted mortality risk of 7.6 % .

risk factors for mediastinitis preoperative predictors for mediastinitis are shown in table 2 .
univariate risk factors were advanced age , parsonnet score , chf , copd , diabetes , hypertension , left main disease , peripheral vascular disease , obesity , decreasing egfr , operative status , and prolonged preoperative length of stay .
after adjusting for all significant factors in univariate analyses only obesity , copd , diabetes , preoperative length of stay , and decreasing egfr were independent predictors of mediastinitis , with obesity being the most significant ( or 2.59 , 95 % ci 1.58 - 4.23 ) .
standard egfr cut - points of 30 and 60 ml / min / 1.73 m2 were used in table 2 ; however , there was no egfr cut - off value above which the risk of mediastinitis became significant , since the relationship between both elements remained linear across all egfr values ( data not shown ) .
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for our fully adjusted model was 0.734 .
this implies that our model , which uses easy to collect variables , is acceptable to accurately discriminate those at risk of mediastinitis after cardiac surgery .
the hosmer lameshow goodness - of - fit test also showed good calibration of our model ( chi - square 10.48 , degrees of freedom = 6 , p - value = 0.11 ) .

furthermore , a dose - response relationship was found with regards to preoperative hospital stay , whereby a stay beyond 7 days was associated with a 2.43 - fold increased risk of mediastinitis compared to a preoperative stay of 4 - 7 days which increased this risk by 1.39 times ( table 3 ) .

in - hospital mortality and management of mediastinitis there were 381 in - hospital deaths .
the in - hospital actuarial mortality rate for cardiac surgery cases complicated by mediastinitis was 13.9 % compared to 5.6 % in those patients without mediastinitis ( or 2.72 , 95 % ci 1.56 - 4.75 ) .
management of patients with mediastinitis was either by non - operative or operative means .
twenty - eight patients who had a stable clinical picture were treated by conservative management involving vacuum - assisted closure therapy with intravenous antibiotics .
when the overall clinical picture displayed evidence of deterioration due to unremitting infection or lack of improvement secondary to an unstable sternum , operative revision was performed .
sternal debridement and re - wiring was utilized in 16 patients , while sternal debridement with pectoralis muscle flap advancement was performed in 64 cases of mediastinitis .
bacteriology of the 108 cases of postoperative mediastinitis , no bacteriology could be found in 4 of the cases after chart review .
in the remaining 104 cases , the most common pathogen was coagulase negative staphylococcus ( 82 %) followed by enterococcus ( 22 %) .
mixed flora was found in 49 % of cases of mediastinitis ( table 4 ) .
there was no significant relationship between bacterial pathogen and preoperative hospital stay .

although the complication of mediastinitis is rare , it continues to be a significant source of morbidity , mortality , and cost .
the incidence of mediastinitis in this contemporary patient population was 1.6 % , which is consistent with the range of 0.6 % - 2.65 % reported in studies performed within the last decade [ 1 - 5 ] .
our in - hospital actuarial mortality rate of 13.9 % is on the lower range of the 15 - 20 % , which has been observed previously [ 3,4 ] .
in contrast to previous studies , we did not limit our analysis to cabg procedures only , but included combined cabg and valve , as well as valve only .
the procedure type was not associated with mediastinitis ( data not shown ) .
in accordance with other studies our analysis found that diabetes [ 6,10 ] , copd [ 2,19 ] , impaired preoperative kidney function [ 4,20 ] , and obesity [ 2,4,6,9,12 ] to be independent risk factors for mediastinitis .
the mechanism by which diabetes leads to mediastinitis is unclear .
there is evidence relating cardiac surgical wound infections with perioperative hyperglycemia [ 21,22 ] .
such elevated glucose levels have been found to be associated with a pro - inflammatory process leading to increased susceptibility to infection as well as organ dysfunction [ 22 ] .
in this study , copd increased the risk of mediastinitis by 2.4 folds .
the coughing induced by copd is hypothesized to lead to sternal instability , therefore , increasing the risk of bacterial translocation and hence , sternal infection [ 23 ] .
previous studies have related preoperative renal failure on dialysis with deep sternal wound infections following cardiac surgery [ 4,20 ] .
in this study , we used egfr as a determinant of renal function , as this measurement is more accurate than serum creatinine alone .
our results illustrate that even impaired preoperative kidney function is an independent predictor for the complication .
our cohort analysis , as in others , also found obesity to be the most significant risk factor for deep sternal wound infections .
according to milano et al. the fixed prophylactic antibiotic doses used in adult surgery may be inadequate given the large volumes of distribution in the obese [ 24 ] .
another plausible mechanism includes the large lateral forces on the sternum pulling the sternal halves apart and predisposing to sternal dehiscence .
this study demonstrates that extended preoperative hospital stay is a significant risk factor for mediastinitis by both univariate and adjusted models .
each week of hospital stay preoperatively was associated with a 15 % increased risk of mediastinitis .
this is a novel and also potentially modifiable risk factor .
to our knowledge only one previous study revealed that the interval between hospital admission and operation to be a risk factor for deep sternal wound infection [ 25 ] .
conklin et al. also observed that a preoperative hospital length of stay more than 7 days was associated with a 4.4 - fold increased risk of overall surgical site infections after cardiac surgery [ 26 ] .
although a prolonged preoperative stay could lead to colonization of antibiotic - resistant nosocomial pathogens , our analysis revealed no significant relationship in the distribution of bacteria found on culture with the operative status or preoperative length of stay .
perhaps , a more plausible explanation is that in - patients are often kept fasting while awaiting urgent surgery , and therefore , may be nutritionally deficient in the perioperative period .
it is well established that adequate caloric intake is necessary for proper wound healing .
hennessey et al. found that hypoalbuminemia was an independent risk factor for surgical site infections after gastrointestinal surgery , and that an albumin less than 30 mg / dl was associated with deeper infections [ 27 ] .
as a result , patients with critical coronary disease awaiting urgent surgery in the hospital could be predisposed to mediastinitis based on their nutritional status .
our results clearly indicate a need to reduce preoperative wait - times for cardiac surgery .
efforts such as delaying elective cases to prioritize in - hospital patients , as well as , discharging patients well enough to go home may help to minimize this risk factor .
as for the bacteriologic analysis , the most commonly isolated sternal pathogen comprised of coagulase - negative staphylococcus while staphylococcus aureus was present in only 9 % of wound cultures .
moreover , 49 % of mediastinitis cases grew multiple organisms .
these results differ from recent studies where s. aureus was the predominant bacteria present in 32 - 50 % of isolates with coagulase negative staphylococcus present in 19 - 24 % of cases [ 1,2,5 ] .
although it is possible that the unusually high frequency of coagulase negative staphylococcus is due to cutaneous contamination , this result helps to clarify our lower than expected hospital mortality rate of mediastinitis since surgical site infections from s. epidermidis present a more indolent course .
more importantly , this analysis brings into question the effectiveness of using 1st generation cephalosporins as antibiotic prophylaxis in cardiac surgery since they do not adequately guard against coagulase negative staphylococcus .
according to the society of thoracic surgeons practice guidelines [ 28 ] , class i recommendations support use of a beta - lactam antibiotic , more commonly cefazolin , as first - line for standard cardiac surgical prophylaxis where the incidence of mrsa is low .
this has been our routine practice .
given the high rate of s. epidermidis in sternal wound infections demonstrated in the current study , we therefore suggest the use of vancomycin as surgical prophylaxis in patients with a preoperative hospital stay beyond 3 days since they are at greater risk of deep sternal wound infections .
limitations there are several limitations to our study .
first , it is a retrospective study and as such , the results may be affected by confounding variables not controlled for in the study .
in addition , there was no pre - specified follow - up of patients to assess wound infection following surgery , which could allow for patients with delayed mediastinitis to be lost to follow - up. however , as a tertiary care center , the majority of patients presenting at a peripheral hospital with a potential surgical complication are referred back to our institution .
currently , our database does not contain cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross clamp times for all patients , thus we could not evaluate its impact on mediastinitis risk .
another limitation is the failure of our database to capture the cause for the prolonged preoperative hospital stay .
this is most often multifactorial .
as our institution is a referral center , patients often come from afar , and therefore , remain in hospital until they can be operated on. the limited number of icu beds in a public healthcare system also prevents prompt surgical intervention , thereby , further prolonging the hospital stay .
for example , performing an emergency cardiac operation overnight often results in cancellations in the operating schedule the following day .
moreover , it is possible that patients remaining in hospital awaiting surgery did so because of an impaired medical condition ( pneumonia , sepsis , chf , etc. ) that was not captured by our analysis .
however , our study found no relationship between higher preoperative mortality risk as indicated by the parsonnet score with the risk of mediastinitis .
lastly , this study was performed at a single institution , which may limit generalizability .
however , this same circumstance also ensures that all patients were subjected to the same pre - and postoperative variables that could affect infection .
conclusions the present data demonstrates that in addition to the traditional risk factors for mediastinitis , a prolonged preoperative hospital length of stay is also an important predictor of deep sternal wound infections .
minimizing the delay for hospitalized patients awaiting cardiac surgery , as well as optimizing the prophylactic antibiotic regimen in these patients should be further explored , as it likely represents a modifiable risk factor for mediastinitis .

using a minimal lock - and - key element the affinity between the intein fragments for n - terminal protein trans - splicing was significantly increased , allowing for site - specific , ' traceless' covalent protein labeling in living mammalian cells at nanomolar probe concentrations .
protein trans - splicing mediated by split inteins is a powerful technique for site - specific protein modification .
despite recent developments there is still an urgent need for ultra - small high - affinity intein tags for in vitro and in vivo approaches .
to date , only very few in - cell applications of protein trans - splicing have been reported , all limited to c - terminal protein modifications .
here , we developed a strategy for covalent n - terminal intein - mediated protein labeling at ( sub ) nanomolar probe concentrations .
combined with a minimal synthetic lock - and - key element , the affinity between the intein fragments was increased more than 50 - fold to 10 nm. site - specific and efficient ' traceless' protein modification by high - affinity trans - splicing is demonstrated at nanomolar concentrations in living mammalian cells .
introduction an eminent challenge in life sciences remains the site - specific protein modification with minimal perturbation for in vitro as well as in vivo analyses .
although the use of fluorescent proteins facilitated fundamental insight into protein function and cellular processes , their applicability is inherently limited due to their low photostability and quantum yield , slow maturation time , as well as large size.1 hence , alternative approaches have been developed to introduce synthetic fluorescent probes with improved photo - physical properties by self - labeling proteins , e.g. snap / clip / halo tags,2 - 4 or by enzymatic modifications via phosphopantetheinyl transferases , sortases , or lipoic acid ligases.5 - 7 yet , these enzymes need to be supplied at high concentrations ( 1 - 100 mum ) and the large fusion domains (> 20 kda ) have adverse effects on the function , interaction , and trafficking of the target protein .
besides these strategies , different chemoselective reactions and semi - synthetic techniques , such as native chemical ligation or intein - mediated protein splicing , have been established.8 - 10 inteins are internal protein domains , which facilitate their own excision and thereby covalently fuse the flanking n - and c - terminal exteins , en and ec , in a self - processive manner .
a very promising strategy for protein semi - synthesis is protein trans - splicing ( pts ) , which has been applied for segmental isotope labeling,11 protein backbone cyclization,12 cyclic peptide generation,13 - 15 protein immobilization,9,16,17 as well as for n - and c - terminal protein labeling.18 - 21 in pts , the autocatalytic domain is naturally or artificially split into two fragments , in and ic , reconstituting the active intein complex.22 the excision process is virtually traceless , apart from a few flanking extein residues , required for efficient splicing .
whereas semi - synthetic pts is widely applied in vitro , in - cell applications using split inteins are exclusively based on c - terminal protein modifications by trans - splicing.23 - 26 if the native c terminus is not accessible or essential for function , localization , or protein dynamics ( e.g. lipid - and tail - anchored proteins,27 ubiquitin,28 and lamin a29 ) , intracellular n - terminal protein modifications by pts are indispensable .
however , the large sizes of most split intein fragments with 100 - 130 amino acids ( aa ) for in and 35 - 50 aa for ic , also including high - affinity inteins , e.g. npu dnae30 or ssp dnae,23,24,31 compromise their accessibility by solid - phase peptide synthesis ( spps ). 32,33 several attempts were made to create short intein fragments for these semi - synthetic approaches.20,34 despite that , the affinities in the micromolar range of very small intein fragments18 impede in vivo applications .
here , we adopted the multivalent chelator tris - n - nitrilotriacetic acid ( trisnta ) , 35 - 37 which allows for site - specific and reversible recognition of his6 - 10 - tagged proteins in the nanomolar range ( k d < 10 nm ) , even inside living cells.38,39 the trisnta / his - tag system defines one of the smallest high - affinity recognition elements known to date .
we developed a split intein system guided by this minimalistic interaction pair to promote n - terminal protein labeling at nanomolar concentrations by trans - splicing ( scheme 1 ) .
a related approach was realized with e. coli dihydrofolate reductase and its ligand trimethoprim.40 nonetheless , this strategy suffers from a large fusion domain ( 25 kda ) and micromolar concentrations applied for labeling .
noteworthy , this affinity pair was utilized for extracellular labeling , whereas our high - affinity trisnta / his - tag pair already demonstrated accurate labeling of proteins in living cells.38,39,41 our approach combines this diminutive interaction pair with the smallest synthetically accessible in ( 11 aa ) and a recombinantly expressed ic ( 143 aa ) of the artificially split dnab m86 mini - intein from synechocystis sp .
pcc6803 ( ssp dnab m86 ). 42,43 scheme 1 protein trans - splicing guided by a minimalistic high - affinity interaction pair .
based on the high - affinity trisnta / his - tag interaction , the intein fragments in and ic react at nanomolar concentrations .
pts results in a ' traceless' n - terminal labeling of ec ( poi , protein of interest ) with e.g. a molecular probe .
ssp dnab : ; 1mi8.pdb .
results and discussion protein trans - splicing directed by a high - affinity interaction pair we generated a set of synthetic in and recombinant ic fragments ( fig. 1a and b ) .
in was prepared by fmoc - based spps with five native en residues , kkesg , and either 5 ( 6 ) - carboxyfluorescein or cy5 as n - terminal fluorescent reporter .
the multivalent chelator trisnta was c - terminally introduced via diaminopropionic acid during spps ( fig. 1a and s1 ++) .
thioredoxin was chosen as a model protein and n - terminally fused with the ic fragment of ssp dnab m86 .
in addition , the n terminus of ic was equipped with a his6 - tag and optionally a serine - glycine linker ( sggg , thereafter referred to as hict or hlict ; fig. 1b ) .
for comparison , ic - trx - his6 ( icth ) was used.42,43 fig. 1 semi - synthetic protein trans - splicing directed by a minimal high - affinity interaction pair .

trisnta was incorporated during fmoc - based spps .
5 ( 6 ) - carboxyfluorescein ( fam ) or cy5 were used as fluorescent reporter .
( b ) design of recombinant ic with thioredoxin ( trx ) .
n - terminal his6 - tagged hict and hlict were used for interaction analyses with in - trisnta and in - l - trisnta .
icth with a c - terminal his6 - tag served as control .
( c ) pts of icth / hict ( 10 mum ) and fam - labeled in ( 40 mum ) yielded fluorescently labeled trx ( 1 h , 20 degreesc ) .
sp , splice product ; * , impurity / premature cleaved intein.20,44 we first investigated the trans - splicing reaction at micromolar concentrations typically used for in vitro experiments ( fig. 1c ) .
after performing pts , fluorescently labeled trx and the excised ic fragment were detected by sds - page in - gel fluorescence and coomassie staining .
densitometric analysis of ic conversion with his6 - ic - trx ( hict ; 76 +/ - 8 %) and his6 - ic - linker - trx ( hlict ; 71 +/ - 10 % for in ; table s3 ++) showed similar yields .
these values are in accordance with data reported for icth and in.42 > 70 % splice product ( sp ) formation was achieved for all constructs , with negligible formation of c - terminal by - products by premature cleavage of the intein .
this phenomenon of self - induced c - terminal cleavage is known for the ssp dnab intein , but almost suppressed in the m86 mutant.42 sp formation was calculated as follows : [ sp ]/([ sp ] + [ residual ic fragment ] + [ cleaved ic ]). 18,43 the amount of premature cleaved intein20,44 was not included in sp determination .
our emphasis was not to prevent premature cleavage , but rather to increase the affinities of the intein fragments .
at 37 degreesc , pts showed a decreased efficiency with up to 5 - fold higher c - terminal cleavage.42 interestingly , the ser - gly linker between the his6 - tag and ic ( hlict ) caused ~ 10 % less ic conversion for in - trisnta and in - l - trisnta .
the pseudo first - order rate of trans - splicing was k pts = ( 2.0 +/ - 0.6 ) x 10 - 3 s - 1 corresponding to a tau 1 / 2 = 14 +/ - 3 min at 20 degreesc for hict and in. the rate is in perfect agreement with k pts = ( 2.5 +/ - 0.1 ) x 10 - 3 s - 1 for icth under comparable conditions.42 all other constructs reacted similarly ( table s3 ++) .
in conclusion , the presence of ni - trisnta and n - terminal his - tag had no effect on the trans - splicing efficiency and reaction kinetics .
high - affinity interaction determined by fluorescence anisotropy and microscale thermophoresis we determined the affinity of the intein fragments by fluorescence anisotropy ( fa ; fig. 2a and b ) and by microscale thermophoresis ( mst ) 45,46 using the splice - inactive ic ( n154a , s + 1a , h73a ) mutant42,43 and 150 pm of cy5 - labeled in ( fig. 2c - e and s6 ++) .
the mst experiments represent the first use of mst for affinity measurements performed on inteins. fig. 2 the trisnta / his - tag pair triggers high - affinity interaction of intein fragments .
( a ) interaction between fam - in or fam - in - trisnta ( 100 nm each ) with either hict or hlict ( b ) was analysed by fluorescence anisotropy .
a dramatic increase in affinity was observed for fam - in - ni - trisnta .
fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed with splice - inactive ic.42,43 ( c ) representative mst traces of cy5 - in ( 150 pm ) with different concentrations of hict as indicated .
( d ) variable mst power ( 20 - 80 %) was applied to optimize the trace resolution .
( e ) the interaction between hict and cy5 - in , cy5 - in - trisnta , or cy5 - in - ni - trisnta ( 150 pm each ) was determined by analysing changes in the mst signals .
interaction analysis was performed with splice - inactive ic.42,43 ( f ) trans - splicing of cy5 - in - trisnta and cy5 - in - ni - trisnta ( 1 nm ) with increasing concentrations of hict ( 1 h , 20 degreesc ) .
pts was followed by sds - page in - gel fluorescence analysis .
error bars : s.d. by fa , an equilibrium dissociation constant k d of 350 +/ - 60 nm was determined for the splice - inactive trans - splicing pair icth and in. a similar k d was observed for hict , whereas a negligible reduction of the affinity was detected for hlict .
in the case of in - trisnta and in - l - trisnta , we observed slight decreased affinities for hict and hlict ( table 1 ) .

in the case of in - ni - trisnta , an impressive increase in affinity between the intein fragments was observed ( k d ~ 10 nm ) .
to further investigate high - affinity pts , we employed mst .
150 pm of cy5 - in were titrated with increasing concentrations of hict ( fig. 2c ) .
to better resolve the cy5 - fluorescence traces , diverse mst power was used ( fig. 2d ) .
the fluorescence change deltaf norm was deviated from f hot / f cold , whereat f hot and f cold are the mean fluorescence at the end of the measurement ( fig. 2c , light - grey dashed line ) and 1 s after turning on the ir - laser ( fig. 2c , dark - grey dashed line ). 47 deltaf norm of each mst trace is plotted against the respective ic concentration to preserve a dose - response curve ( fig. 2e ) , from which the affinity can be derived .
notably , the k d values , measured by two independent approaches , are very similar ( table 1 ) .
importantly , the affinities between in and ic were superimposed and promoted by the trisnta / his - tag interaction .
we noted that the affinities of the trisnta / his - tag modified intein pairs are in the same range as the naturally occurring npu dnae inteins for c - terminal modification,30 the rapamycin - triggered fkbp12 - frb,48,49 or the e. coli dihydrofolate reductase - trimethoprim interaction.40 however , in comparison , the ultra - small size of our interaction pair combined with the minimal synthetic in fragment ( 11 aa ) makes this system the smallest nanomolar affinity intein described until now .
next , we compared the trans - splicing reaction in the micromolar and nanomolar range ( fig. 2f ) .
in line with the drastic increased affinity promoted by the trisnta / his - tag interaction , trans - splicing was observed down to the sub - nanomolar range ( 0.6 nm ) .
in the absence of the small lock - and - key pair , e.g. nickel - deficient trisnta , pts was not observed at low probe concentrations ( fig. 2f ) .
the trans - splicing efficiencies and kinetics are summarized in the esi ( table s3 , fig. s7 - s9 ++) .
protein trans - splicing in the crowded cytosol of human cells encouraged by these results , we aimed at pts in a crowded cellular environment .
we analysed the high - affinity trans - splicing reaction in the cytosol of human cells ( cell lysate ) .
using 10 mum of hict or hiclt and 40 mum of the respective in , a specific trans - splicing reaction and n - terminal modification of the target protein in cell lysate were detected ( fig. 3a ) .
the trans - splicing efficiency was comparable to the in vitro results .
a slightly lower sp efficiency was determined for in - l - trisnta , indicating that the ser - gly linker may affect the trans - splicing reaction .
at nanomolar concentrations ( 1 nm ) , high - affinity pts was exclusively observed with in - ni - trisnta ( fig. 3b ) , whereas with in or in - trisnta no sp formation was detectable. fig. 3 protein trans - splicing in the cytosol of human cells promoted by the trisnta / his - tag interaction .
high - affinity protein labeling was performed with 10 mum of ic and 40 mum of in fragments ( a ) as well as with 1 nm of ic and 4 nm of in fragments ( b ) in hela cell lysate ( 20 mg ml - 1 ) .
sp formation was analysed by sds - page in - gel fluorescence .
negative controls can be inferred from fig. s10. ++ protein trans - splicing inside mammalian cells the successful pts reaction in cell lysate incited us to perform trans - splicing in living mammalian cells .
to date , only four in - cell approaches of pts have been reported , all limited to c - terminal modifications.23 - 26 to establish the first in - cell application of semi - synthetic pts at the n terminus , we used hic - megfp as a model protein .
to achieve a distinct cellular distribution for visual readout , megfp was additionally equipped with nuclear localization sequences ( nls , hic - megfpnls ) .
for rapid intracellular delivery of cy5 - labeled in fragments , two cell transduction methodologies were tested .
the cell squeezing technique50 was applied for high - throughput delivery and subsequent ensemble measurements , whereas semi - permeabilization with streptolysin o ( slo ) was additionally adapted to provide instantaneous excess to the cytosol for direct observation of intracellular processes by confocal laser - scanning microscopy ( clsm ) .
human cervical cancer ( hela kyoto ) cells expressing hic - megfpnls were transduced in the presence of various concentrations of cy5 - labeled in fragments by cell squeezing as well as slo semi - permeabilization .
in both cases , we first investigated the formation of covalently modified trans - splicing product ( cy5 - megfpnls ) by sds - page in - gel - fluorescence analysis ( fig. 4a ) .
at micromolar concentrations of cy5 - in , we observed sp formation in squeezed as well as semi - permeabilized cells whereas nanomolar concentrations of cy5 - in failed to yield the trans - splicing product cy5 - megfpnls .
in contrast , 100 nm of cy5 - in - ni - trisnta still resulted in sp formation , demonstrating that the trans - splicing reaction is boosted by the minimal lock - and - key recognition element even in living cells ( fig. 4a and b and s13 and s14 ++) .
notably , no sp was detected in cells expressing megfpnls lacking the hic part .
interestingly , comparable sp yields were obtained for cy5 - in and cy5 - in - trisnta at micromolar concentrations as well as for 100 nm of cy5 - in - ni - trisnta , indicating that the chemical composition of the in fragments does not bias the trans - splicing reaction .
moreover , the guidance by the minimal trisnta / his - tag interaction is essential for sp formation at nanomolar concentrations , since no sp formation was observed for cy5 - in - trisnta lacking ni ( ii ) .
it is worth mentioning that no sp was detected in the external medium ( ext , fig. 4a ) , confirming that high - affinity pts occurred inside cells ( cell ; fig. 4a ) .
cytotoxic effects of ni ( ii ) ions can be excluded due to the high complex formation constant of 10 - 13 m of ni - nta .
as a result , free nickel ions only exist in the femtomolar range .
these results demonstrate that the high - affinity interaction pair does not only boost pts in vitro and in cell lysates , but even inside living cells. fig. 4 pts in living mammalian cells .
( a ) cy5 - labeled in fragments were delivered into the cytosol of hela kyoto cells transfected with hic - megfpnls or megfpnls via cell squeezing or slo semi - permeabilization .
at nanomolar concentrations , in - cell pts was only observed with cy5 - in - ni - trisnta ( 100 nm ) , whereas similar concentrations of cy5 - in or cy5 - in - trisnta showed no pts reaction .
in the absence of the high - affinity pair or without coordinated ni ( ii ) , 3 mum of cy5 - in or cy5 - in - trisnta was needed .
for both permeabilization approaches , sp formation was detected only in cells ( cell ) but not in the external medium ( ext ) .
as a negative control for cell squeezing , 3 mum of cy5 - in in megfpnls transfected cells was used .
negative controls for slo semi - permeabilization were performed with 3 mum of cy5 - in and cy5 - in - trisnta , as well as 100 nm of cy5 - in - ni - trisnta in megfpnls transfected cells .
( b ) cy5 - labeled in probes were delivered into the cytosol of slo semi - permeabilized hela kyoto cells and imaged using clsm .
at 100 nm of cy5 - in - ni - trisnta , co - localization with megfpnls was observed .
in contrast , 100 nm of cy5 - in did not lead to specific labeling .
using 3 mum of cy5 - in , low signal - to - background labeling was detected at the nucleus ( see also fig. s16 ++) .
scale bar : 5 mum .
the efficiency of trans - splicing in living cells was determined by immunoblotting analysis against gfp .
the trans - splicing yield was determined to 2 - 8 % for 3 mum of cy5 - in and 2 % for 100 nm of cy5 - in - ni - trisnta ( fig. s15 ++) .
in contrast to in vitro analyses and trans - splicing in cell lysates , the efficiency in living mammalian cells dropped 10 - to 40 - fold .
although the in vivo pts efficiency decreased , the high - affinity trisnta / his - tag interaction still enables sp formation in the nanomolar range , as demonstrated by sds - page in - gel fluorescence analysis of transduced cells .
these observations again highlight the benefit of the minimal lock - and - key recognition element for pts .
next , we aimed at visualization of sp formation in mammalian cells expressing hic - megfpnls .
it is noteworthy that the fusion of the ic sequence (~ 150 aa ) did not affect the nuclear localization of hic - megfpnls ( fig. s12 ++) .
since cell squeezing dislocates megfpnls and squeezed cells need time for reattachment to the surface , this technique is not appropriate in this case .
therefore , we delivered the in fragments by slo semi - permeabilization to provide instantaneous excess to the cytosol for direct observation of intracellular processes using confocal laser - scanning microscopy ( clsm ) without a major time delay .
nuclear co - localization of the fluorescence signal for hic - megfpnls and cy5 - in - ni - trisnta provided evidence of site - specific and high - affinity pts at nanomolar probe concentration in living cells ( fig. 4a and b and s15 ++) .
as demonstrated by sds - page in - gel fluorescence , this is indicative of pts at nanomolar concentrations ( fig. 4a ) .
here , only 100 nm of cy5 - in - ni - trisnta was offered to the cells , since this concentration proved to be sufficient for pts ( fig. 4a ) .
in contrast , applying the same concentrations of unmodified cy5 - in , no specific cy5 - labeling of nuclear - targeted megfpnls was detected .
although micromolar concentrations of cy5 - in led to trans - splicing and nuclear cy5 - staining ( fig. 4a and b ) , this signal was outshone by the extensive background fluorescence ( fig. 4b and s16 ++) .
here , the laser intensities were adjusted to the high concentrations of unmodified cy5 - in required for trans - splicing and hence suppress fluorescence signals emanating from nuclear localized cy5 - in. in summary , we demonstrated in - cell trans - splicing by using two different transduction techniques as well as two different readout methods .
in all scenarios , the minimalistic lock - and - key element efficiently guided pts in the nanomolar range , fully in line with the results achieved in vitro and in cell lysates .
conclusions we have developed a high - affinity split intein system for ' traceless' tracing of proteins .
in our study , the affinity of the artificial split ssp dnab m86 intein was synergistically interconnected with the ultra - small trisnta / his - tag recognition element .
as a result , covalent n - terminal protein labeling in vitro and subsequently , for the first time , in living mammalian cells is demonstrated .
comprehensive in vitro characterization by sds - page in - gel fluorescence analysis , fluorescence anisotropy as well as microscale thermophoresis measurements demonstrated a more than 50 - fold increase in affinity for the cognate intein fragments by the trisnta / his - tag interaction pair .
despite this , the intrinsic intein properties were not affected in regard to yields and kinetics of the sp formation .
moreover , the minimalistic lock - and - key element even allowed performing pts at ( sub ) nanomolar concentrations in vitro as well as ex vivo ( human cell lysates ) with comparable results .
hence , the trans - splicing reaction with minimal probe concentration is pivotal for advanced imaging techniques .
as a first in vivo proof - of - concept , the developed high - affinity in - trisnta fragments were delivered into mammalian cells via microfluidic cell squeezing as well as semi - permeabilization .
at nanomolar concentrations , sp formation in living cells was only detected in the presence of the high - affinity interaction pair and corroborated by sds - page in - gel fluorescence analysis .
thus , we established the first in - cell application of semi - synthetic protein trans - splicing at the n terminus .
although the trans - splicing efficiency was largely affected inside cells , the trans - splicing reaction is still guided by our minimal interaction pair and thereby promoted in vivo .
to highlight opportunities for further development , particularly with respect to in - cell applications , fret / quencher pairs to follow the trans - splicing reaction in real - time are currently under investigation .
taking advantage of the precision in labeling , we are exploring this high - affinity ' traceless' labeling approach for single - molecule tracking and localization analysis in live cells .
this high - affinity n - terminal protein modification should advance our understanding of cellular networks .

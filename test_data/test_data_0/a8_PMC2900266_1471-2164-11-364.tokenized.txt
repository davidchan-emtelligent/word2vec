background cell functions depend on molecules organized in the cellular society .
two basic components are mrna molecules and proteins .
the interactions within and between those two components are crucial for carrying out sophisticated cell functions .
the interplay can be analyzed by comparing expression levels of mrna and proteins .
this is critical for understanding the molecular interactions , ( post - ) transcriptional regulations and conservation of co - expression between mrnas and proteins. by using high - throughput transcriptome and proteome data , this study aims to systematically investigate the general picture of such expression correlations .
we analyze four groups of correlations : ( i ) transcript levels of different genes , ( ii ) protein levels of different genes , ( iii ) mrna levels with protein levels of different genes and ( iv ) mrna levels with protein levels of same genes .
this helps to obtain global insights into the stability and variability of co - expression and correlation of mrna and protein levels .
results analysis of the simultaneous co - expression of mrnas and proteins yields mainly weak correlations .
therefore we introduce the concept of time - delayed co - expression patterns .
based on a time - course dataset , we obtain a high fraction of time - delayed correlations .
in group ( i ) , 67 % of different transcripts are significantly correlated .
at the protein level ( ii ) , 68 % of different proteins are significantly correlated .
comparison of the different molecular levels results in a 74 % fraction of correlated transcript and protein levels of different genes ( iii ) and 56 % for the same genes ( iv ) .
furthermore , a higher fraction of protein levels ( simultaneously 20 % and short time - delayed 29 %) is correlated than at the transcript level ( 10 % and 18 % respectively ) .
analysis of the dynamics of the correlation shows that correlation at the transcript level is largely passed to the protein level .
in contrast , specific co - expression patterns are changed in multiple ways .
conclusions our analysis reveals that the regulation of transcription and translation contains a time - delayed component .
the correlation at the protein level is more synchronous or delayed by shorter time than those at the transcript level .
this supports the hypothesis that a higher degree of direct physical interactions require a higher synchronicity between the interacting partners .
the conservation of correlation between the transcript level ( i ) and the protein level ( ii ) sheds light on the processes underlying transcription , translation and regulation .
a future investigation of the conditions of conservation will give comprehensive insights in the complexity of the regulatory mechanisms .
background expression of genes can be divided into the two fundamental stages of mrna and protein expression , both stages are regulated by complex mechanisms .
both mrnas and proteins as dynamic and active macromolecules fulfil specific functions just like citizens in a society .
they interact with each other to maintain the order , activity and stability of the cellular society .
currently , most genome - wide expression studies focus on identifying coordinated genes at the mrna level , extracting gene clusters and inferring gene regulatory networks [ 1 - 5 ] .
furthermore , similarity between mrna profiles has been widely used to infer the cellular phenotype state for identification and detection of cancer subtypes [ 1,6 - 8 ] .
in another study , mrna co - expression has been systematically investigated in several eukaryotic species to detect hierarchical patterns represented as trees .
these patterns recur in different pathways and exhibit linear , nonlinear , local , global , time - delayed , monotonic and non - monotonic characteristics .
they reflect cellular inner regulation of mrna levels and enhance our understanding of gene expression activity in the cellular society [ 9 ] .
for the analysis at the protein level , two - dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry ( 2de - ms ) has been widely used to generate protein expression profiles [ 10,11 ] .
based on such data , many researchers have analyzed the correlation between mrna and protein expression of the same gene [ 12 - 16 ] .
however , no comprehensive study has been performed to decipher global interaction and mutual regulation among mrnas and proteins .
this is surprising since mrna expression depends on protein expression while protein expression is based on mrna expression .
most mrna expression is directly regulated by proteins bound to dna or indirectly controlled by complex protein - protein interactions ( ppi ) , for example as co - factors .
the reverse link from mrna to proteins is manifested in the translation process .
as a result , mrna and protein levels in a cell should be correlated to a certain degree .
correlation between mrna levels will not necessarily be conserved in the corresponding protein levels because of differences in post - transcriptional modifications and regulations .
the impact of these mechanisms on the propagation of co - expression from mrna to protein levels has not yet been systematically investigated .
to prevent an overestimation of disrupted propagation , the dynamics of regulatory processes need to be incorporated .
the dynamics introduce a time delay since the corresponding molecular processes are not instantaneous .
in this article , we perform a large - scale analysis of mrna - mrna , protein - protein and mrna - protein co - expression .
based on two eukaryotic species , plasmodium falciparum and human , we calculate correlation patterns between different genes and for mrna - protein co - expression also for the same genes .
we employ the high - throughput mrna and protein expression profiles to obtain significance values for the correlation .
this allows a statistically solid analysis of the correlation patterns and their propagation from mrna to protein levels .
this is an advance to the systematic understanding of the regulation of gene transcription and translation in a cellular society .
results the data comprise mrna transcript and protein sets of two different eukaryotic species : plasmodium falciparum ( pfa ) [ 13 ] and human [ 17,18 ] ( for details see table 1 ) .
table 1 data summary .
species data type mrnas proteins samples pfa life cycle 2502 2502 6 human nci60 86 86 59 the transcriptome and proteome data of the plasmodium falciparum dataset are taken from a pioneering study from le roch kg et al [ 13 ] .
in this study , the abundance of mrna transcripts is calculated by applying the moid algorithm for high - density oligonucleotide array analysis .
the moid algorithm provides a p - value for each measurement and thus a metric to evaluate the confidence of each data point .
transcripts are considered to be present if their expression levels are greater than 10 and the log of the p - value ( logp ) is less than - 0.5 .
applying this methodology , 4292 transcripts are detected in at least one of the six stages examined .
on the protein level , point were measured using the redi micro bca protein assay system ( pierce ) , 2904 proteins are detected in at least one of the seven stages .
there are 2584 genes , which have a transcript and a protein in at least one stage .
we discard 82 genes , which have a single transcript in the additional stage at the transcript level , arriving at 2502 genes for our analysis .
these genes have a transcript and a protein in at least one of the six common stages ( mero , ring , troph , schiz , gameto and sporo ) .
in the human dataset , the abundance of mrna transcripts of 60 human cancer / tumor tissues are tested with the affymatrix u95 chip .
the intensities of the probes in each probe - set are combined and normalized using gcrma [ 17 ] .
proteomic profiling of the nci - 60 cancer cell lines is performed by new high - density reverse - phase lysate microarrays ( rpla ) .
for 176 antibodies , signal intensities are measured and processed by the di25 algorithm ( log2 ) [ 18 ] .
we compare transcript and protein expression profiles across the nci60 cancer cell panel , which is based on nine tissues of origin .
this results in 86 genes , which have both mrna and protein expression levels available .
we analyze four different groups of correlation : ( i ) transcript levels of different genes , ( ii ) protein levels of different genes , ( iii ) mrna levels with protein levels of different ( iv ) and same genes .
for the first three groups ( i ) to ( iii ) , we randomly sample gene pairs to investigate the co - expression .
for the fourth group ( iv ) , we use the same gene for transcript and protein levels .
discovering simultaneous co - expression across different molecular levels we select gene pairs with statistically significant gamma values under hypothesis testing procedure t ( see methods ) .
the complete comparison of the correlations within each molecular level is shown in table 2 .
only a small proportion of gene pairs is correlated if one neglects a time delay .
we call this simultaneous co - expression .
in general , there are more gene pairs with significant correlation at the protein level than at the transcript level .
as direct physical interaction is more important for proteins than for mrnas , the results confirm the expectation that proteins accordingly require expression in a more coordinated fashion .
table 2 simultaneous co - expression within different molecular levels .
species pairs correlated no relationship pfa mrna - mrna 2623 ( 10.48 %) 22397 ( 89.52 %) protein - protein 5016 ( 20.05 %) 20004 ( 79.95 %) human mrna - mrna 499 ( 13.65 %) 3156 ( 86.35 %) protein - protein 534 ( 14.61 %) 3121 ( 85.39 %) proteins bound to dna regulate either directly and / or indirectly with mrnas .
since these proteins interact with other proteins , mrnas are also affected by protein - protein interactions ( ppi ) .
reversely , translation connects mrna levels with protein levels .
assuming only a weak impact of post - transcriptional regulation and time delays , this would increase the correlation between the transcript and the protein levels .
here , we investigate the correlations between the transcript and protein level based on different and identical genes .
afterwards we relax our assumption about the weak impact of time delays .
table 3 shows the results for simultaneous co - expression for mrna - protein pairs .
there is a considerable proportion of correlated mrna - protein pairs in each comparison .
for both organisms , the correlation between the transcript and the protein expression of the same gene ( iv ) is higher than for different genes ( iii ) .
for plasmodium falciparum , the difference is only about 17 % while for human almost 41 % of group ( iv ) is correlated in contrast to 6 % of group ( iii ) .
the simultaneous co - expression is mainly driven by the translation of mrna to proteins .
since the mrna is taken as input while the protein is the product of the translation , correlation between these two levels for group ( iv ) is not surprising .
table 3 simultaneous co - expression between mrna and protein level .
species pairs correlated no relationship pfa mrna - protein ( different genes ) 7708 ( 15.40 %) 42332 ( 84.60 %) mrna - protein ( same gene ) 432 ( 17.27 %) 2070 ( 82.73 %) human mrna - protein ( different genes ) 10 ( 5.81 %) 162 ( 94.19 %) mrna - protein ( same gene ) 35 ( 40.70 %) 51 ( 59.30 %) discovering time - delayed gene co - expression across different molecular levels according to the above analysis , only small proportions of gene pairs exhibit significant co - expression except for the human group ( iv ) .
this might be due to the assumption that time delay effects do not play an important role .
in the cell , mrnas and proteins interact in a complex molecular network , as time - dependent dynamics are intrinsic to such interactions , time delayed patterns between molecules should widely occur in the cellular context .
we incorporate the time delay effect by calculating correlation between different time points .
for the plasmodium falciparum dataset , the mrna and protein levels are detected in six life cycle stages .
ensuring sufficient data points to calculate the correlation , we use a maximal time delay of three time points .
for larger delays , the expression vectors are too small such that the correlation becomes erratic .
hence , we investigate co - expression for simultaneous , delay of one , delay of two and delay of three time points .
table 4 shows there are 66.64 % ( 17.63 + 17.99 + 31.02 ) mrna - mrna pairs , 68.11 % ( 29.35 + 22.41 + 16.35 ) protein - protein pairs , 73.57 % ( 28.28 + 24.78 + 20.51 ) mrna - protein pairs for different genes and 56.29 % ( 17.31 + 17.19 + 21.79 ) mrna - protein pairs for the same genes , which have time - delayed co - expression patterns .
comparing with the simultaneous co - expression proportion , it is clear that the time delay effect dominates the plasmodium falciparum dataset .
confirming our previous results , the co - expression between different genes at the protein level is stronger than at the transcript level .
there are only 12 % of the gene pairs , which do not exhibit any correlation at the protein level in plasmodium falciparum dataset .
moreover , co - expression at the same time point and , delayed by one or two time points among different genes at the protein level are persistently larger than those at the transcript level .
this further indicates that genes at the protein level are more synchronized than at the mrna level .
only the number of three time - point delayed co - expression at the transcript level is exceptionally high .
since co - expression is transferred between the protein and the transcript level , this high fraction of co - expressed genes might be due to an accumulation of synchronizing mechanisms at different levels .
the mrna - protein pairs among different genes as well as among same genes represent indirect interactions between molecules .
the large number of time - delayed correlation between these pairs provides evidence that indirect molecular interaction in cellular process mainly behave by time - delayed coordination .
table 4 time - delayed co - expression .
species pairs simultaneous one time - point delayed two time - point delayed three time - point delayed no relationship p value pfa mrna - mrna 2623 ( 10.48 %) 4410 ( 17.63 %) 4501 ( 17.99 %) 7762 ( 31.02 %) 5724 ( 22.88 %) chi2 = 3617.32p < 0.05 protein - protein 5016 ( 20.05 %) 7344 ( 29.35 %) 5606 ( 22.41 %) 4092 ( 16.35 %) 2962 ( 11.84 %) mrna - protein ( different genes ) 7708 ( 15.40 %) 14150 ( 28.28 %) 12399 ( 24.78 %) 10265 ( 20.51 %) 5518 ( 11.03 %) chi2 = 639.42p < 0.05 mrna - protein ( same genes ) 432 ( 17.27 %) 433 ( 17.31 %) 430 ( 17.19 %) 545 ( 21.79 %) 662 ( 26.46 %) discovering positive regulation mechanisms across different molecular levels figure 1 , figure 2 and figure 3 respectively show the distributions of simultaneous and time - delayed spearman rank correlation values in plasmodium falciparum and human .
the correlation values for simultaneous co - expression ( figure 1 ) are prone to a positive correlation .
this supports the hypothesis that genes are inclined to positive regulatory mechanisms .
the similar phenomenon also appears in human ( figure 2 ) .
interestingly , the time - delayed correlation values ( figure 3 ) follow a bimodal distribution with symmetry at zero .
despite the symmetry , the correlation values are also prone to positive correlation .

gene correlation transfer from transcript level to protein level figure 4 shows how the co - expression is transferred from transcript level to protein level in plasmodium falciparum .
each gene pair is assigned to one of the three groups : simultaneous co - expression , time - delayed co - expression and no relationship .
based on this assignment , we track each gene pair from the transcript level to the protein level .
the solid lines in figure 4 denote gene pairs , which are assigned to the same groups at transcript level and protein level .
these pairs have conserved co - expression across the molecular levels .
dashed lines indicate a change of the group .
for example , the majority of simultaneous co - expressed gene pairs at transcript level are assigned to time - delayed co - expression at protein levels .
this supports the hypothesis of an accumulation of time - delayed co - expression also at the transcript level .
figure 4 co - expression transfer of gene pairs from mrna level to protein level in plasmodium falciparum .
in more detail , 2623 gene pairs belong to the group of simultaneous co - expression at transcript level , 22.61 % of these pairs stay in this group at protein level .
another 66.76 % of the gene pairs change to time - delayed co - expression while the remaining gene pairs ( 10.64 %) do n't exhibit any correlation at the protein level .
this means that simultaneous co - expression at transcript level is mostly transferred to the protein level but is subject to a time delay .
the majority of all gene pairs ( 16673 ) have significant time - delayed co - expression at the transcript level .
most of these pairs ( 68.16 %) also exhibit a time - delayed co - expression at the protein level .
some of these gene pairs have changed in the extent of the delay , which is not shown in the figure .
a fraction of 20.29 % of time - delayed gene pairs at transcript level turns into simultaneous co - expression at protein level .
only a small proportion of pairs ( 11.55 %) do n't show any co - expression at protein level .
in summary , this indicates that time - delayed co - expression at transcript level is mainly transferred to the protein level with a smaller fraction inclining towards simultaneous co - expression .
in comparison to simultaneous co - expression at transcript level , time - delayed co - expression is more stable underlying the importance of the temporal component of interactions .
in addition , 5724 gene pairs do n't have any measurable co - expression at transcript level .
for the huge minority of those ( 69.90 %) , we detect time - delayed correlation at the protein level .
only 18.61 % turn into simultaneous co - expression and 11.46 % still have no relationship .
the human nci60 dataset contains a series of cancer tissues including leukemia , melanoma , and cancer of ovarian , renal , breast , colon , lung , and central nervous system origin .
therefore , we cannot measure time - delayed co - expression .
hence , we restrict the analysis to the two groups of simultaneous co - expression and gene pairs without co - expression .
the results are shown in figure 5 .
only 22.45 % of simultaneous co - expressed gene pairs at transcript level are also co - expressed at the protein level .
this is not surprising since as indicated by the plasmodium falciparum dataset , most co - expressions are time delayed .
since the time - delayed co - expressed gene pairs are among the non co - expressed gene pairs , one would expect this result .
figure 5 co - expression transfer of gene pairs from mrna level to protein level in human .
significant function categories of co - expression transfer patterns we further investigate the biological context for gene pairs with different co - expression transfer patterns .
we employ the subtree ' molecular function ' of the gene ontology ( go ) .
the go term enrichment analysis is performed with the tool goeast [ 19 ] .
we select function categories with a p - value less than 0.01 .
there are 83 terms enriched in human and three terms in plasmodium falciparum for gene pairs with simultaneous co - expression both at transcript level and at protein level .
these go terms have as a distinct characteristic that most of them are involved in molecular binding and binding - related activity .
the top four categories in human are dna insertion or deletion binding , protein binding , mutlablpha complex binding , mis - match repair complex binding .
in plasmodium falciparum , the three enriched terms include nucleic acid binding , damaged dna binding and translation elongation factor activity .
different binding actions can be further generalized in go as a selective , non - covalent , often stoichiometric , interaction of a molecule with one or more specific sites on another molecule , reflecting direct physical interplay between molecules .
thus , the found binding categories actually provide us the supporting evidence that simultaneous co - expression at protein level explicitly represent the inner act conducted by directly physical binding between molecules in cellular society .
for genes pairs with time - delayed co - expression in plasmodium falciparum , there are 76 significant terms both at transcript level and protein level .
most of those represent biological activity mainly involving transcription regulator , transporter and catalysis of a biochemical reaction .
proteins for transporter activity enable the directed movement of substances ( such as macromolecules , small molecules , ions ) into , out of , within or between cells .
proteins for enzymes are indirectly associated with each other by a series of catalyzed reactions .
thus , a distinct time delay caused by molecular movement or reaction process actually exists among these proteins .
this is reflected by the time - delayed co - expression at protein level .
discussion our results show a high fraction of gene pairs , which are co - expressed either simultaneously or with a time delay within and between transcript and protein levels .
this indicates that co - expression is a universal phenomenon for mrna and proteins in a cellular society .
the majority of co - expressed gene pairs are not simultaneously co - expressed but are shifted in time .
this holds for gene pairs at transcript level and protein level .
le roch , et. al .
[ 13 ] illuminate time - delayed regulatory mechanisms by a global analysis of transcript and protein levels across the plasmodium falciparum life cycle .
according to their research , the gametocyte transcriptome correlates best with the proteome of the following gamete stage .
this time shift is also observed for other stages , the merozoite stage transcriptome is correlated best with the ring - stage proteome , whereas the ring - stage transcriptome correlates best with the trophozoite proteome .
lee , et. al .
[ 20 ] use genome - wide location data to identify six regulatory network motifs : autoregulation , multicomponent loops , feedforward loops , single - input , multi - input , and regulator chain .
they reveal the time order of different molecules in the motifs and indicate time - shifted co - expression within the same network motifs .
our results further suggest the gene regulatory conducts the time - delayed regulatory mechanism , and the regulatory effect at the level of mrna stability and / or translation is time shifted .
in plasmodium falciparum , the correlation analysis of different genes and same genes across different molecular levels show that 88.97 %( 100 - 11.03 ) and 73.54 %( 100 - 26.46 ) gene pairs are co - expressed ( table 4 ) .
this suggests a universal correlation between the transcriptome and proteome in plasmodium falciparum .
the correlation is also conserved from the transcript level to the protein level .
these results seem to contradict most previous analyses on correlation between the transcriptome and the proteome which only report minor correlation [ 12,21 - 23 ] .
these analyses focus on simultaneous correlation by neglecting time - delayed correlation .
in fact , our results partially confirm this claim .
based on our analysis of simultaneous co - expression in two species , only a few gene pairs in plasmodium falciparum are co - expressed ( see table 3 ) .
this holds for the transcript level , the protein level and between both levels .
only the incorporation of a time delay in the correlation analysis leads to the detection of considerable co - expression .
hence , the time delay introduced by molecular processes needs to be acknowledged in co - expression analysis at the transcript and protein level .
the analysis of co - expression of mrna - mrna pairs , mrna - protein pairs and protein - protein pairs shows that the distribution of simultaneous co - expression values is prone to positive values .
two distinct peaks characterize the distributions of the time - delayed co - expression values .
the high peak is centered around + 0.9 and the low peak is located around - 0.7 ( see figure 3 ) .
this indicates genes prefer to regulate positively rather than negatively during the process of transcript regulation and post - transcriptional regulation .
both species have more co - expressed gene pairs at the protein level than at the transcript level ( see table 2 ) .
incorporating time delays shows that simultaneous and short time delayed co - expression is more abundant at protein levels than at the transcript levels ( see table 4 ) .
this suggests that post - transcriptional regulation tends to be synchronous due to more direct physical interactions leading to synchronized protein expression .
co - expression between gene pairs is partially conserved between the transcript and the protein level .
especially co - expression at the protein level strongly depends on co - expression at transcript level ( see figure 4 ) .
50.41 % (( 593 + 11364 + 656 )/ 25020 ) of the gene pairs keep the same co - expression patterns across the different molecular levels .
a high number of gene pairs with any type of co - expression at the transcript level ( 68.31 % ( 593 + 1751 + 11364 + 3383 )/ 25020 ) are also co - expressed at the protein level .
still , the transfer of gene pair co - expression across the molecular levels shows flexibility .
more than a third of the gene pairs ( 49.59 %) change their type of co - expression across transcript and protein levels .
for example , simultaneous co - expression is often changed to time - delayed co - expression while time - delayed co - expression sometimes turns into simultaneous co - expression .
in addition , non co - expressed gene pairs can become co - expressed .
thus , the transfer of co - expression from transcript level to protein level in plasmodium falciparum is characterized by both conservation and flexibility .
in summary , co - expression at the transcript level partially reflects co - expression at the protein level as well as co - expression at the protein level is partially driven by co - expression at the transcript level .
hence , the analysis of gene pair co - expression transfer between different molecular levels gives comprehensive insights and enhances understanding of the complexity of gene regulatory mechanisms .
conclusions our analysis shows that simultaneous co - expression only resembles a part of the types of co - expression in a cellular society .
it is important to include time delays in the analysis .
at least for plasmodium falciparum , this is the dominant type of co - expression among different gene pairs at the same molecular level , different gene pairs at different molecular levels and same gene pairs at different molecular levels .
furthermore , different gene pairs at the same molecular level are more frequently co - expressed simultaneously or with a short time delay at the protein level than at the transcript level .
this is due to more direct physical interactions between proteins , which require concerted expression .
we analyzed the effect of transcriptional and translational processes by investigating the co - expression of mrna - protein gene pairs at the different molecular levels .
different genes at transcript and protein level exhibit more time - delayed regulatory mechanisms while considering the same gene at both levels shows more simultaneous co - expression .
mainly , co - expression of gene pairs at the transcript level is passed to the protein level .
though , specific types of co - expression are changed in multiple ways .
therefore , the transfer of co - expression across molecular levels can be described as a harmonious process of both conservation and flexibility .
methods we applied spearman rank correlation gamma to unravel co - expression between different genes and proteins .
the spearman rank correlation coefficient has been proposed for the comparison of transcriptome and proteome [ 16 ] .
furthermore , it is capable of capturing monotonic trends instead of only linear trends as pearson correlation coefficient .
as described below in more detail , we apply a hypothesis test t to determine the significance of a correlation based on a permutation approach .
this method is more robust since it automatically takes into account tied data points .
figure 6 displays the comparison strategy between different molecules .

gx and gy denote different genes , axm and axp denote the mrna and protein expression intensities of gene gx. the connection between different molecules shows their correlations will be calculated .

yn ) , with xi being the expression value of the ith experimental condition of gx , and correspondingly yi for the expression value of the ith experimental condition of gy. the basic definition of the co - expression score gamma for gene gx and gy follows from the spearman rank correlation coefficient with l denoting the dimension of x and y. here , we rank both x and y from the highest to the lowest values .
then , we subtract the two sets of ranks to obtain the difference d. if data are given as a time course experiment , time - delayed co - expression needs to be considered .
suppose gene gx is co - expressed with a time delay of t time points with respect to gy , we use truncated expression vectors x = ( xt + 1 ...

correspondingly , if gy is shifted by t time points , we employ the expression vectors x = ( x1 , x2 ...
xi ...

yi ...

after calculating the score gamma for each possible time shift , we predict a time delay of t time points by setting t to the time shift of the highest retrieved score gamma , and the p - value is calculated and adjusted by multiple hypothesis testing to estimate the significance of score .
multiple hypothesis testing procedure t we apply a hypothesis test for the co - expression score based on a permutation approach using monte carlo techniques .
based on this procedure , we can test whether a calculated score gamma for two genes is a random sample from the background distribution of scores .
the background distribution of scores is obtained by perturbing experimental conditions .
for control of the overall false discovery rate , the p - value was further adjusted by the bonferroni correction approach .
the test procedure is as follows : ( 1 ) create reference expression vectors of gx and gy under h0 by permuting experimental conditions of x and y .
( 2 ) calculate co - expression score gamma0 of permuted x and y .
( 3 ) repeat step the two previous steps 500 times .
( 4 ) create cumulative distribution of gamma0 ( null distribution ) .
( 5 ) calculate p ( gamma | h0 ) after the bonferroni correstion , if p < 0.05 , reject h0 .
only gene pairs with significant co - expression scores are selected .

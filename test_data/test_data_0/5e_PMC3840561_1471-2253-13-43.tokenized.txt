background etiologies of pediatric intensive care unit ( picu ) mortality are diverse .
this study aimed to investigate the pattern of picu mortality in a regional trauma center , and explore factors associated with prolonged non - survival .
methods demographic data of all picu deaths in a regional trauma center were analyzed .
factors associated with prolonged nonsurvival ( length of stay ) were investigated with univariate log rank and multivariate cox - regression forward stepwise tests .
results there were 88 deaths ( males 61 % ; infants 23 %) over 10 years ( median picu stay = 3.5 days , interquartile range : 1 and 11 days ) .
the mean annual mortality rate of picu admissions was 5.8 % .
septicemia with gram positive , gram negative and fungal pathogens were present in 13 ( 16 %) , 13 ( 16 %) and 4 ( 5 %) of these patients , respectively .
viruses were isolated in 25 patients ( 28 %) .
ninety percent of these 88 patients were ventilated , 75 % required inotropes , 92 % received broad spectrum antibiotic coverage , 32 % received systemic corticosteroids , 56 % required blood transfusion and 39 % received anticonvulsants .
thirty nine patients ( 44 %) had a dnar ( do - not - attempt - resuscitation ) order with their deaths at the picu .
comparing with non - trauma category , trauma patients had higher mortality score , no premorbid disease , suffered asystole preceding picu admission and subsequent brain death .
oncologic conditions were the most prevalent diagnosis in the non - trauma category .
there was no gunshot or asthma death in this series .
prolonged non - survival was significantly associated with dnar , fungal infections , and mechanical ventilation but negatively associated with bacteremia .
conclusions death in the picu is a heterogeneous event that involves infants and children .
resuscitation was not attempted at the time of their deaths in nearly half of the patients in honor of parents' wishes .
parents often make dnar decision when medical futility becomes evident .
they could be reassured that dnar did not mean " abandoning " care .
instead , dnar patients had prolonged picu stay and received the same level of picu supports as patients who did not respond to cardiopulmonary resuscitation .
bacteria fungus picu pediatric intensive care malignancy mortality oncology pim2 sepsis trauma virus do - not - attempt - resuscitation ( dnar ) not - responding - to - cardiopulmonary - resuscitation ( nrcpr ) brain death organ donation background improvements in resuscitation , access to advanced technologies and access to newer medications have led to improved survival of critically ill patients in intensive care units [ 1 - 4 ] .
nevertheless , children are occasionally inflicted with severe and life threatening diseases , necessitating supports and treatment at a pediatric intensive care unit ( picu ) [ 5 - 7 ] .
unfortunately , a small percentage would not survive despite optimal picu care and support [ 4,8 ] .
hong kong , with a population of over 7 million people , has a dual public and private system for both primary and secondary health care .
although there are 10 government ( hospital authority [ ha ]) and 10 private hospitals providing general pediatric inpatient service , the ha system provides the majority of inpatient pediatric care .
the prince of wales hospital ( pwh ) is a university teaching / government hospital and a tertiary trauma center situated in the new territories in hong kong .
pwh provides tertiary pediatric intensive care unit ( picu ) service for children < 12 years of age to this region with a catchment population of over 1.1 million ( approximately 25 % were children < 12 years of age ) .
the incidence and pattern of mortality in young children reflects the social and demographic characteristics of that city [ 2,8 - 10 ] .
it is generally observed that severe infections significantly contribute to childhood mortality in developing nations , whereas malignancy may be a key cause of mortality in industrialized or commercialized nations [ 8 ] .
picu mortality is diverse and broadly divided into two mutually exclusive categories : trauma and non - trauma etiologies [ 11,12 ] .
this study aimed to investigate the pattern of mortality in young children admitted to a picu in a regional trauma center , and explore factors associated with prolonged non - survival .
methods the criteria for picu admissions include cardiopulmonary insufficiency / failure , neurological deterioration , and concerns of emergency care and / or general pediatric staff .
cases were identified from the hospital 's computerized auditing system and from the picu database of every admission to the unit .
the picu database was audited monthly .
every child who died in picu from october 2002 ( picu opening ) to december 2012 was recruited .
data were collected from patient records , hospital clinical management system ( cms ) and autopsy reports , which included age , gender , duration in picu stay , primary diagnosis , cause of death , mode of death , underlying conditions ; use of inotropes , systemic antibiotics , anticonvulsants and systemic corticosteroids ; ventilatory support ; and blood product transfusions .
the data also included patients' clinical conditions such as asystole preceding picu admission , diagnosis of encephalitis or raised intracranial pressure ( icp ) , disseminated intravascular coagulopathy ( dic ) and multi - organ system failure ( mosf ) .
the paediatric index of mortality ( pim2 ) score was calculated for each patient ( http :// www.sfar.org / scores2 / pim22.html )[ 13 ] .
according to pim2 , high risk diagnoses include cardiac arrest preceding icu admission , severe combined immune deficiency , leukemia or lymphoma after first induction , spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage , cardiomyopathy or myocarditis , hypoplastic left heart syndrome , hiv infection , liver failure , and neuro - degenerative disorder .
low risk diagnoses include asthma , bronchiolitis , croup , obstructive sleep apnea and diabetic ketoacidosis .
primary diagnoses were divided into 3 categories : oncologic , injury and miscellaneous .
the respiratory viruses were identified using conventional diagnostic methods , including direct immunofluorescence testing ( dift ) on respiratory samples ( e.g. nasopharyngeal aspirates [ npas ] ; broncho - alveolar lavages [ bals ] , tracheal aspirates [ tas ] , and oral swabs ) , with confirmation and typing by type - specific dift and viral culture .
the results of all other bacterial and fungal cultures on respiratory specimens ( including tracheal aspirate , pleural and sputum specimens ) , blood , cerebrospinal and deep wound cultures were recorded .
mode of death was classified into two categories : " do not attempt resuscitation ( dnar )" and " not responding to cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( nrcpr )" .
there were 5 data abstractors and inter - rater variability was controlled by standard procedures .
the ethics committee of the chinese university of hong kong approved this anonymous review with no patient identity in the manuscript , and that patient consent was not necessary for this retrospective survey .
numerical data were compared with mann - whitney test and categorical data with fisher exact test .
all comparisons were made two - tailed , and p - values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant .
results from october 2002 to december 2012 , 88 deaths occurred in 1505 admissions to the picu ( table 1 : males 61 % ; infants 23 % ; median picu stay = 3.5 days , iqr : 1 and 11 days ) .
the mean annual mortality rate of picu admissions was 5.8 % ( table 2 ) .
there was no significant change in annual mortality over the past 10 years .
the median pim2 score was 20 % .
ninety percent of these patients were ventilated , 75 % required inotropes , 92 % received broad spectrum antibiotic coverage , 32 % received systemic corticosteroids , 56 % blood transfusion and 39 % anticonvulsants .
thirty nine patients ( 44 %) had a dnar ( do - not - attempt - resuscitation order ) prior to their death at the picu , but few were actively withdrawn .

there was no pim2 low - risk - diagnosis in this series ( http :// www.sfar.org / scores2 / pim22.html )[ 13 ] .
infections eighty one ( 92 %) of patients had been treated with antibiotics for clinical infection .
septicemia with gram positive , gram negative and fungal pathogens were present in 13 ( 16 %) , 13 ( 16 %) and 4 ( 5 %) of these patients , respectively .
the most common gram negative pathogens isolated in the blood cultures were pseudomonas aeruginosa ( n = 5 ) , e. coli ( n = 3 ) , enterobacter ( n = 2 ) , stenotrophomonas ( n = 2 ) and chryseobacterium ( n = 2 ) .
the most common gram positive pathogens isolated in blood was coagulase - negative staphylococcus species ( cnss ) ( n = 5 ) .
there were two case of pneumococcal deaths associated with multi - organ system failure and hemolytic uremic syndrome .
among the fungal blood cultures were candida parasilosis , candida albicans , candida tropicalis , penicillium marneffei ; 2 also had concurrent bacterial septicemia .
viruses were isolated in 25 patients ( 28 %) ; 7 of these patients also had concurrent bacterial septicemia and 10 patients with underlying hematologic / oncologic diagnoses .
the viruses included cytomegalovirus ( n = 8 ) , ebstein - barr virus ( n = 4 ) , herpes simplex type 1 ( n = 3 ) , human herpesvirus type 6 ( n = 1 ) , human herpesvirus type 7 ( n = 1 ) , respiratory syncytial virus ( n = 3 ) , influenza a ( n = 1 ) , parainfluenza type 3 ( n = 1 ) , adenovirus ( n = 3 ) , norovirus ( n = 1 ) , coxsackie virus ( n = 1 ) and human metapneumovirus ( n = 1 ) .
there were no deaths associated with meningitis .
oncology hematological and miscellaneous malignancies were a prevalent category associated with picu deaths ( including acute lymphoblastic leukemia , acute myeloblastic leukemia , chronic myeloblastic , lymphoma , hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis , langerhans cell histiocytosis , medulloblastoma , glioblastoma , hepatoblastoma , neuroblastoma and mixed germ cell tumor .
septicemia was associated with hematological / malignant conditions .
the majority of these patients did not present immediately post - bone marrow transplantation .
trauma nine deaths ( 10 %) were due to trauma / injuries .
causes include traumatic head injury from fall ( n = 4 ) , strangulation ( n = 1 ) , suspected non accidental injury and cerebral hemorrhage ( n = 1 ) , submersion injury ( n = 2 ) and suffocation ( n = 1 ) .
there was no gunshot death or road traffic injury .
comparing with non - trauma diagnoses , trauma patients had higher pim2 scores ( p = 0.002 ) , were more likely to present with cardiac arrest preceding icu admission , and to have brain death subsequently ( table 1 ) .
trauma deaths typically involved healthy boys and not involving any pathogens .
there were only 2 cases of organ donation following brain deaths and both were from non - chinese families ( us and japanese ) .
factors associated with length of picu stay univariate analysis by log rank test and kaplan - meier plot and multivariate cox - regression forward stepwise test showed prolonged non - survival ( length of picu stay ) was significantly associated with dnar [ 18.6 versus 7.5 days , p < 0.001 ] , fungal infections [ 29.6 versus 8.3 days , p = 0.002 ] , and mechanical ventilation [ 13.7 versus 1 day , p < 0.001 ] , but negatively associated with bacteremia [ 4.6 versus 15.5 days , p = 0.031 ] ( tables 3 , 4 and 5 ) .

discussion picu admissions are generally associated with a low but definite risk of mortality [ 2,14 - 16 ] .
there has been no significant change in trend and the low mortality rates are similar to those reported from the united kingdom ( 5.1 %) and europe ( 5.8 %) [ 2,4,14,16 ] .
infants account for one - fourth and males account for 61 % of picu deaths .
the median picu stay between admission and death was generally brief ( median stay 3.5 days ) and compatible with durations reported in other series [ 2,4,17 ] .
gender disparity in childhood morbidity has been demonstrated in a large study involving 92,332 pediatric admissions [ 18 ] .
there is no relevant demographic difference between the two genders in terms of mortality in this series .
patients who die in the picu generally have multi - organ system involvement as evinced by the high rates of mechanical ventilation , inotrope and broad antibiotic usage .
septicemia is associated with a number of picu deaths and may involve bacterial , fungal and viral pathogens [ 19 ] .
nevertheless , some patients have received antibiotics prior to picu admissions , rendering the blood cultures negative despite the clinical presentation being consistent with sepsis .
importantly , adequate coverage for gram negative bacteria , staphylococci , streptococci , fungi and cytomegalovirus should be considered especially in immuno - compromised patients and patients with hematologic / oncologic disorders [ 20,21 ] .
sensible initial antimicrobial coverage targeting potential pathogens must be promptly instituted. with or without infections , hematologic / oncologic diagnoses were the leading category among the non - trauma picu deaths , and majority had hematological malignancies [ 20 ] .
our findings were consistent with data described at other picus [ 9,10,22 - 24 ] .
trauma is a common and important cause of pediatric mortality [ 2,7,11,12,25 ] .
the mechanisms of injury vary widely [ 8 ] .
falls account for nearly half of the deaths .
drowning or submersion injury represents another small but potentially preventable cause of mortality [ 6,7,11 ] .
in this series , no infants died from trauma or non - accidental injury .
interestingly , there has been no pediatric gunshot death in hong kong due to strict local gun - control regulations .
this is very different from countries where gunshots contribute to a significant part of pediatric death [ 7,8,11,26 ] picu deaths associated with trauma showed a high percentage of male due possibly to curiosity and accident - prone behavior in boys [ 27 ] .
more than half of the trauma deaths in our study were due to head injuries and subsequent brain - death .
in addition , pim2 score of the trauma associated deaths was significantly higher than that of the non - trauma related deaths .
this might be due to the fact that significantly more patients in the trauma group presented in asystole before picu admission , which contributes to " high risk diagnosis " in calculation of the pim 2 score [ 13 ] .
deaths in picu patients with metabolic diseases were relatively rare and often difficult to confirm .
a similar study in the uk showed that 4.4 % of the picu non - survivors were diagnosed of metabolic diseases [ 2 ] .
chromosomal abnormalities and neurodegenerative diseases are also uncommon in our group of patients .
the decision and implementation of an end - of - life plan is a multi - faceted process that takes time and patience to eventuate [ 14,16,28 ] .
resuscitation was not attempted at the time of their deaths in nearly half of the patients in honor of caregivers' wishes .
parents often make timely dnar decision when futility of treatment becomes evident .
as a result , dnar patients may paradoxically appear to take a lot longer to inevitably die .
despite prolonged non - survival , caregivers can be assured that dnar patients generally received the same level of picu supports including hemodynamic monitoring , mechanical ventilation , inotrope and antimicrobial usage as nrcpr patients during their picu course .
there were only two picu cases of organ donation following brain deaths , and both patients were from non - chinese families ( us and japanese ) .
organ donations are rare in chinese families possibly related to ethnic beliefs [ 29 ] .
these patients typically did not have active infection .
limitation of this study was the relative small sample size and heterogeneity despite the long study period of over 10 years .
this may be due to the advanced medical care and relative small pediatric population in the aging hong kong demographics .
in addition , difficulties were encountered in retrieving some of the patients' records due to the retrospective nature of the study .
nevertheless , data from cms and autopsy reports are highly reliable .
lastly , our study only investigates picu deaths and excludes children who die prior to hospitalization or picu admission .
conclusion in conclusion , picu admissions were associated with a 5.8 % mortality rate .
death in the picu is a heterogeneous event that involves infants and children .
resuscitation was not attempted at the time of their deaths in nearly half of the patients in honor of parents' wishes .
parents often make dnar decision when medical futility becomes evident .
despite prolonged non - survival , dnar patients generally received the same level of picu supports as nrcpr patients during their picu course .

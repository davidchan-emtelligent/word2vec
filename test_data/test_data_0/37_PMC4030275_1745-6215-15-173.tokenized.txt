background preoperative airway assessment in denmark is based on a non - specific clinical assessment left to the discretion of the responsible anesthesiologist .
the difficair trial compares the effect of using a systematic and consistent airway assessment versus a non - specific clinical assessment on the frequency of unanticipated difficult airway management .
to prevent outcome bias and selective reporting , we hereby present a detailed statistical analysis plan as an amendment ( update ) to the previously published protocol for the difficair trial .
method / design the difficair trial is a stratified , parallel group , cluster ( cluster = department ) randomized multicenter trial involving 28 departments of anesthesia in denmark randomized to airway assessment either by the simplified airway risk index ( sari ) or by a usual non - specific assessment .
data from patients' preoperative airway assessment are registered in the danish anesthesia database .
an objective score for intubation grading the severity , that is the severity of the intubations , as well as the frequency of unanticipated difficult intubation , is measured for each group .
primary outcome measures are the fraction of unanticipated difficult and easy intubations .
the database is programmed so that the registration of the sari is mandatory for the intervention group but invisible to controls .
data recruitment was commenced in october 2012 and ended in ultimo december 2013 .
conclusion we intend to increase the transparency of the data analyses regarding the difficair trial by an a priori publication of a statistical analysis plan .
trial registration clinicaltrials.gov : nct01718561 .
statistical analysis plan cluster randomized trial airway management cluster analysis difficult intubation introduction the difficult airway management trial ( difficair ) is a stratified , parallel group , cluster ( cluster = department ) randomized and multicenter trial involving 28 departments of anesthesia in denmark .
the difficair trial compares the effect of two regimens of preoperative airway assessment on the frequency of unanticipated difficult airway management .
prediction of difficult airway management remains a pivotal challenge in anesthesia .
difficult tracheal intubation and difficult mask ventilation may cause serious patient complications [ 1 - 6 ]. by allocating experienced personnel and relevant equipment , better prediction of difficult airway management may reduce complications and , thereby , associated morbidity and mortality .
there is no single predictor that is sufficiently valid in predicting difficult tracheal intubation [ 7 - 12 ] .
however , several studies show that by combining multiple predictors of difficult tracheal intubation , the positive and the negative predictive value of the assessment increases [ 12 ] .
in denmark as well as internationally , there is no clear recommendation on how to perform airway assessment .
consequently , airway assessment in denmark is based exclusively on the individual anesthesiologist 's preoperative clinical assessment .
however , it is poorly documented how accurately this clinical assessment predicts actual airway management conditions .
the ' simplified airway risk index ' ( sari ) [ 13 ] is based on a multivariable model for airway assessment described by el - ganzouri and colleagues enabling an estimation of the likelihood of a difficult direct laryngoscopy .
the sari contains seven individual predictors for a difficult direct laryngoscopy , each given a weighted score of 0 to 1 or 0 to 2 .
a summarized value of the sari score > 3 indicates that a future direct laryngoscopy will be difficult .
it is unknown , whether the sari score predicts difficult intubation better or worse than a clinical assessment .
the rationale for this trial was to prospectively compare the effect of the sari with an non - specified clinical airway assessment on the frequency of unanticipated difficult airway management .
the target population was adult patients undergoing anesthesia .
twenty - eight departments of anesthesia were randomized to one of two groups .
intervention departments used the sari score for preoperative airway assessment .
the intervention group additionally did an assessment of risk factors for difficult mask ventilation as described by kheterpal and colleagues [ 14 - 16 ] .
departments in the control group continued normal practice of preoperative airway assessment .
all data were registered in the danish anesthesia database ( dad ) .
a more detailed trial protocol describing background , design and rationale has been published in trials [ 17 ] .
in order to prevent outcome reporting bias and results based on data - driven analysis , it is encouraged to prospectively publish a trial protocol [ 18,19 ] .
the same argument applies for a prospective publication of a statistical analysis plan .
concordantly , the international conference on harmonization ( ich ) of good clinical practice ( gcp ) recommends that clinical trials are analyzed according to a pre - specified plan [ 19 ] .
objective the primary aim of the difficair trial is to compare the effect of using a systematic airway assessment with a standard clinical airway assessment on the frequency of unanticipated difficult airway management .
the null hypothesis is : * there is no difference in the proportion of unanticipated difficult intubations when the preoperative airway assessment is based on the sari score compared with a preoperative airway assessment based on the individual anesthesiologist 's assessment .
the alternative hypothesis is : * the use of a systematic sari airway assessment , registration of the sari and risk factors for difficult mask ventilation , and continuous education in airway assessment will reduce the relative risk of a difficult intubation with 30 % , corresponding to a number needed to treat ( nnt ) of 180 patients .
methods this analysis plan has been written while the data collection from the difficair trial was on - going and trial data non - accessible .
the data analysis of the main publication will follow this plan .
the statistical analysis was approved by the difficair steering committee on 29 december 2013 .
the last day of data collection was 31 december 2013 .
the involved departments were given one additional month to ensure registration of all patients in the danish anesthesia database .
on 31 january 2014 , the database was locked and data extracted .
the statistical analysis plan was published on ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) before the last data entry and before data was extracted and data management commenced .
the difficair trial protocol has been written according to the standard protocol items : recommendations for interventional trials ( spirit ) guidelines and has been public on ( http :// www.difficair.com ) since the beginning of the trial and is registered at ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) ( nct01718561 ) .
the danish anesthesia database and the danish society of anaesthesiology and intensive care medicine ( dasaim ) endorsed the trial .
the trial is carried out in accordance with the helsinki declaration .
the scientific ethics committee of copenhagen county has declared that it is regarded as a quality assurance project and thus should not be reported to the committee system ( journal number : h - 3 - 2012 - fsp2 ) .
further , the need for individual patient consent was waived .
the trial is approved by the danish data protection agency ( journal number : 2007 - 58 - 0015 / hih - 2011 - 10 , i - suite number : 02079 ) .
the reporting of the trial will be in accordance with the consort 2010 statement : extension to cluster randomised trials [ 20 ] .
randomization and sample size our sample size calculation was based on an adjustment for the stratification and the cluster randomized design [ 21,22 ] .
since there are no previous records of the trial 's primary outcome measure , ' unanticipated difficult intubation ' a baseline study was conducted based on data from the dad .
in order to reject or detect a 30 % relative risk reduction in the proportions of unanticipated difficult intubation between the intervention group and the control group approximately 30 departments were required in a 15 months period .
calculations were based on a maximum risk of type 1 error of 5 % and risk of type 2 error of maximum 20 % ( 80 % power ) .
a total of 28 departments were included and randomized 1:1 using a computer generated list .
the sample size calculation was based on an average cluster size of 1,611 patients .
we estimated the average cluster size in the difficair trial to approximately 2,500 patients , giving a total of 70,000 included patients during the trial period .
the enhanced sample size allows for a potentially slight loss of clusters according to the power calculation , from 30 to potentially 26 .
our sample size estimation may be of a conservative nature , calling for more clusters than necessary [ 23 ] .
populations the difficair trial focuses on two essential elements of airway management which are tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy and mask ventilation .
this statistical analysis plan will address analysis of the data regarding tracheal intubation .
data analysis regarding prediction of difficult mask ventilation will be handled in an analogous way , but will not be further elaborated in the present paper .
the part of the difficair trial regarding prediction of difficult intubation comprises two populations ; 1 ) patients that were primarily attempted intubated by direct laryngoscopy ; 2 ) patients that were primarily attempted intubated by direct laryngoscopy ( population 1 ) plus patients anticipated to be difficult to intubate and therefore scheduled for and intubated with an advanced method ( for example , video laryngoscopic or fiber optic intubation ) .
the results of population 1 and 2 will be presented in one publication .
due to the extent of data , further publications presenting data from the difficair trial will follow , but further elaboration on data analysis exceeds the content frame of this paper .
adjusting and stratification variables each cluster ( department ) was randomized to a control or intervention group , making this the intervention group indicator .
the trial site may account for further intervention heterogeneity and will be used for adjustment in the analysis of the intervention effect .
further , a stratification variable that grouped the departments according to whether the proportion of unanticipated difficult intubation at baseline was >= or < 2 % will be used for adjustment according to recent evidence of increased power in the analysis of stratified trials [ 22 ] .
assumed confounding covariates we define age ; gender ; asa classification ; emergency / elective procedure ; body mass index ( bmi ) ; and use of neuromuscular blocking agents as covariates that are possible confounders , necessitating adjusted analyses of the primary outcome and pre - defined subgroup analyses .
primary outcomes the primary outcome measures are : 1 .
the fraction of unanticipated difficult intubations = all intubations with unanticipated difficulties ( false negative )/ all patients primarily ( attempted ) intubated by direct laryngoscopy .
2. the fraction of unanticipated easy intubations = all intubations with anticipated difficulties that were easy ( false positive )/ all patients primarily ( attempted ) intubated by direct laryngoscopy .
the two primary outcomes are linked and simultaneous low fractions are desirable for the optimal prediction of a difficult intubation .
secondary outcomes 1 .
48 - hour mortality .
2. 30 - day mortality .
3. the fraction of anticipated difficult intubations planned for , and intubated by an advanced method / all patients ( attempted ) intubated .
4. the fraction of unanticipated difficult intubations ( false negative )/ all difficult intubations (( false negative ) + ( true positive )) .
5. sensitivity of the prediction of a difficult / easy intubation .
6. specificity of the prediction a difficult / easy intubation .
7. predictive value of a positive prediction of difficult / easy intubation .
8. predictive value of a negative prediction of difficult / easy intubation .
9. positive likelihood ratio = ( sensitivity /( 1 - specificity )) .
10. negative likelihood ratio = (( 1 - sensitivity )/ specificity ) .
11. the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve .

definition of difficult intubation in the dad , an intubation score is programmed based on numbers of intubation attempts and use of equipment .
1. a maximum of two intubation attempts - only by direct laryngoscopy .
2. a maximum of two intubation attempts in which other intubation equipment or assistive devices for direct laryngoscopy is used ( for example , video laryngoscope ) .
3. three intubation attempts or more - regardless of intubation method .
4. intubation failed despite attempting .
tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy is pre - defined in the dad as easy by a score = 1 and difficult by a score >= 2 .
in our primary analyses and sample size calculation we employ the same definition .
general analysis principles 1 .
unless otherwise stated , all main analyses will compare the two intervention groups using intention - to - treat ( itt ) [ 24 ] .
2. in order to ensure a correct type 1 error risk , all main analyses will account for the clustered design of the trial and the stratification variable [ 25 - 27 ] .
analyses will be based on individual patient level data but clustering of patients and the stratification variable will be accounted for in a generalized estimating equation .
3. in all analyses , a maximum level of 5 % ( two - sided ) type 1 error will be regarded as statistically significant unless otherwise stated .
4. main analyses will be according to itt adjusted for cluster and stratification variables .
sensitivity analyses will be performed adjusted and unadjusted for the prior listed potential confounding covariates .
we will discuss if results differ from the main analyses .
the conclusion of the trial will be based on the primary analyses .
5. test of interaction will be applied for subgroup analyses .
6. risks are reported as relative risks and odds ratios .
when relative risks are calculated from odds ratios with 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) it will be done according to zhang and yu [ 28 ] .
7. for missing data exceeding a rate of 5 % , and with a statistical significant little 's test , indicating that the missing data is not a completely random sample of the total data , point estimates with 95 % ci will be calculated using a worst / best case scenario imputation on the missing values .
if the imputation of a worst / best case scenario implies different conclusions , multiple imputations will be performed on the missing values assuming missingness at random [ 29 ] .
unadjusted and complete case analyses will also be presented .
8. in order to avoid rejecting a true null hypothesis we will address the problem of multiplicity by bonferroni adjustments on the secondary outcome measures .
if unadjusted analyses are insignificant ( p > 0.05 ) , bonferroni adjustments will not be applied .
in case the adjustment changes an unadjusted significant p - value to a non - significant p - value , this will be discussed .
9. to ensure complete objectivity , the author ( an ) will be blinded for the intervention group in the primary outcome analysis and , as far as this is possible , for analyses of secondary outcomes .
however , analyses of the predictive properties of the sari will require un - blinding of an. after data collection , a third party data manager will generate a complete dataset with blinded coding of the intervention groups and other variables possibly revealing the intervention .
the statistician performs the primary outcome analysis on this data set .
if the primary outcome differs between groups , we will construct different conclusions reflecting the results , considering that significant differences of the intervention could both be of benefit or harm .
after writing the conclusions , we will uncover the code of the blinding , and subsequently the correct conclusion will be employed [ 30 ] .
statistical analyses trial profile the flow of study participants will be displayed in a consolidated standards of reporting trials ( consort ) diagram at a cluster level and at individual level .
the number of clusters fulfilling the inclusion criteria , and the number of clusters included in primary and secondary analyses , will be presented .
the number of patients who fulfilled study inclusion criteria as well as the number included in the primary and secondary analyses will be reported .
reasons for exclusions of clusters and patients in the primary and secondary analyses will be reported .
primary outcome frequencies and percentages per group will be reported with a 95 % ci. the primary outcome is presented as odds ratios and relative risk ratios .
the primary analysis of the primary outcome will be adjusted for the stratification - and the cluster - variable performed according to the itt principle including patients that met the inclusion - and not the exclusion - criteria .
a generalized estimating equation will be used .
intervention group and stratification variable are regarded as fixed effects and trial site is regarded as random effects in the model .
we will test the robustness of the results by repeating the analyses with a mixed effects model and finally with a standard t - test comparing the means of the outcome at department level in each intervention group .
the first sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome will be adjusted for the stratification - and cluster - variables as well as baseline covariates assumed as confounders incorporated in a generalized estimating equation .
in the second sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome , we will employ a different cut - off value for difficult intubation using >= 3 instead of >= 2 as the definition of difficult intubation .
further sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome will compare the patients in the control group that met the inclusion - and not the exclusion - criteria with patients in the intervention group who received the protocoled intervention. that is , a per protocol analysis of control group versus the subgroup in the intervention group that had a sufficiently registered sari .
interaction test will be performed in the intervention group between patients receiving sufficient / insufficient sari registration .
secondary outcomes frequencies , proportions , percentages , odds and risk ratios are presented with a 95 % ci for each group .
a chi - squared test is used to assess the effect of the intervention on binary outcomes .
for categorical outcomes and the adjusted analyses , logistic regression analysis or generalized estimating equations will be performed .
baseline comparisons of patient characteristics baseline characteristics are presented for each intervention group .
frequencies , proportions and percentages will be used to summarize discrete variables .
in case of missing values , percentages are presented with the actual denominator and otherwise calculated according to the number of participating patients .
continuous variables are summarized using standard measures of central tendency and dispersion using either mean +/ - sd for data with normal distribution or median and interquartile range for non - normally distributed data .
baseline comparisons of cluster characteristics cluster characteristics are presented for each group , control and intervention .
unless otherwise stated , data will be presented as means with sd for data with normal distribution or median and interquartile range for non - normally distributed data .
outline of figures and tables the first figure will be a consort flow chart on individual patient level and cluster level .
a second figure will illustrate the sari score and tutorial instruments .
a third figure will demonstrate the registration in the dad , including the intubation score .
a fourth figure will present baseline data from each intervention group on individual and cluster level and a fifth figure will be outlining the main outcome results for each intervention group .
discussion in order to avoid outcome reporting bias and data - driven results this paper presents the detailed statistical analysis plan for the main publication of the difficair trial .
the difficair trial raises two important questions , which are : is it possible via the intervention to reduce the frequencies of difficult intubation and / or difficult mask ventilation ?
this plan only addresses the statistical analyses of the population of intubated patients because our sample size calculations were based on this population .
secondly , the sari was developed as a prediction tool for difficult intubation .
finally , the extent of data necessitates several publications. by adjusting our primary outcome analysis for different design variables , such as clustering and stratification , we strive to eliminate inflated type 1 error rates as a consequence of the trial design .
a generalized estimating equation is applied based on an evaluation of each variable as having random or fixed effects [ 31,32 ] .
when multiple comparisons are performed between two groups , you may risk accepting an intervention effect erroneously ( type 1 error ) .
there are several approaches that deal with multiple testing .
we will employ bonferroni adjustments on the secondary outcome measures in order to evaluate , identify and discuss dubious significant outcomes that may be due to statistical multiplicity .
the value of a diagnostic test is usually presented as sensitivity and specificity .
we have chosen ( 1 - total accuracy ) , that is the proportion of unanticipated difficult intubations ( false negative , fn ) and the proportion of unanticipated easy intubations ( false positive , fp ) .
both scenarios are of clinical relevance since the fns are at risk of hypoxia , increased morbidity and even death , while the fps are at risk of being imposed unnecessary discomfort by , for example , awake intubation .
at the same time , both the fns and fps can take up unnecessary resources .
sensitivity and specificity are more difficult to interpret intuitively .
consequently , we chose to present more transparent primary outcomes .
using proportions of unanticipated difficult intubation allowed us to perform a baseline cohort study , on which we based our sample size and power calculations. by publishing this paper , where we pre - specify our methods and analyses , it is our hope that the results from the difficair trial will be as transparent and robust as possible .
conclusion this paper presents the principles of analyses of the main outcomes in the difficair trial for the first publication based on patients who underwent intubation .
our approach aims to minimize the risk of data - driven results and outcome reporting bias .

however this only incorporates patient - related variables .
objectives we developed a new method , the " infection risk scan " , which includes outcome variables , patient - related variables as well as ward - related variables .
this should provide a holistic view on the infection risk profile of a ward or a hospital .
methods two outcome variables were investigated , prevalence of healthcare associated infections ( hai ) and rectal carriage of extended spectrum b - lactamase ( esbl ) producing bacteria .
two patient - related risk variables , use of indwelling medical devices and antimicrobial therapy , and two ward - related variables , environmental contamination and hand hygiene non - compliance ( according to the who guideline ) .
results of all investigated variables were categorised as low risk , medium risk and high risk , based on the literature or expert opinion , and presented in a spider - plot .
the infection risk scan was performed in 4 different general nursing wards .
results large differences were found in outcome variables and risk factors , with a distribution across all 3 risk categories ( low , medium and high ) .
this resulted in different risk - plots for the different wards .
handhygiene non - compliance and the environmental contamination were a cause of concern in all wards .
prevalence of esbl carriage was low in all wards , and the esbl isolates were genotypically not related .
conclusion in conclusion , the infection risk plot demonstrated substantial differentiation .
the plot gives an overview that can easily be understood by the healthcare workers and managers .
the problem areas are shown at a glance .
based on the findings a tailor made , targeted quality improvement project can be executed and the results can be measured in a repeated measurement .
this makes the infection risk scan a management tool that can be used to determine the scope and focus of an infection control program .

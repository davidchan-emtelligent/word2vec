apelin - 13 causes vasoconstriction by acting directly on apj receptors in vascular smooth muscle ( vsm ) cells ; however , the ionic mechanisms underlying this action at the cellular level remain unclear .
large - conductance ca2 + - activated k + ( bkca ) channels in vsm cells are critical regulators of membrane potential and vascular tone .
in the present study , we examined the effect of apelin - 13 on bkca channel activity in vsm cells , freshly isolated from rat middle cerebral arteries .
in whole - cell patch clamp mode , apelin - 13 ( 0.001 - 1 mum ) caused concentration - dependent inhibition of bkca in vsm cells .
apelin - 13 ( 0.1 microm ) significantly decreased bkca current density from 71.25 +/ - 8.14 pa / pf to 44.52 +/ - 7.10 pa / pf ( n = 14 cells , p < 0.05 ) .
this inhibitory effect of apelin - 13 was confirmed by single channel recording in cell - attached patches , in which extracellular application of apelin - 13 ( 0.1 microm ) decreased the open - state probability ( npo ) of bkca channels in freshly isolated vsm cells .
however , in inside - out patches , extracellular application of apelin - 13 ( 0.1microm ) did not alter the npo of bkca channels , suggesting that the inhibitory effect of apelin - 13 on bkca is not mediated by a direct action on bkca .
in whole cell patches , pretreatment of vsm cells with ly - 294002 , a pi3 - kinase inhibitor , markedly attenuated the apelin - 13 - induced decrease in bkca current density .
in addition , treatment of arteries with apelin - 13 ( 0.1 microm ) significantly increased the ratio of phosphorylated - akt / total akt , indicating that apelin - 13 significantly increases pi3 - kinase activity .
taken together , the data suggest that apelin - 13 inhibits bkca channel via a pi3 - kinase - dependent signaling pathway in cerebral artery vsm cells , which may contribute to its regulatory action in the control of vascular tone .

introduction apelin is a peptide isolated from bovine stomach extracts and identified as an endogenous ligand for the orphan g - protein coupled receptor , apj , which has seven transmembrane - spanning domains [ 1,2 ] .
despite sharing 31 % of amino acid sequence homology with angiotensin ii type 1 receptors ( at1 - r ) , angiotensin ii does not bind to these receptors [ 3 ] and apelin is the only known ligand for apj receptors .
the apelin gene , located on the long arm of the human x chromosome , codes for a preproprotein of 77 - amino acid residues that is further cleaved to shorter active peptide fragments including apelin - 36 ( 42 - 77 ) , apelin - 17 ( 61 - 77 ) and apelin - 13 ( 65 - 77 ) [ 1,4,5 ] .
apelin - 13 exhibits the greatest binding affinity and biological potency as compared to other fragments [ 4,6,7 ] .
apelin is expressed in the brain cardiovascular regulatory areas as well as in peripheral tissues including the heart and vasculature of major organs , such as lung , kidney and adrenal gland [ 4,8 - 11 ] .
moreover , apj receptors are expressed in vsm cells and cardiomyocytes [ 12 ] .
the wide expression pattern of apelin / apj receptors throughout the cardiovascular system strongly suggests an important role for the apelin / apj system in cardiovascular homeostasis .
in the cardiovascular system , apelin and apj are expressed in endothelium , vsm and cardiomyocytes [ 12,13 ] .
the vascular actions of apelin in regulating blood pressure and vascular tone are controversial .
bolus intravenous injection of apelin in rats causes a rapid and transient fall in mean atrial pressure [ 2,7,14 ] ; in contrast , apelin induces contraction of isolated human saphenous veins and mammary arteries denuded of endothelium [ 12,13 ] .
the latter studies are consistent with apj expression on vsm cells [ 12 ] .
collectively , these data suggest that apelin peptides may have a biphasic hemodynamic response via endothelium - dependent vasorelaxation and a direct contractile effect on vsm .
apelin - induced endothelium - dependent vasorelaxation is attenuated by coadministration of l - name , a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor , suggesting an no - dependent mechanism [ 7 ] .
however , the intracellular transduction pathways and the molecular mechanisms underlying apelin - induced contractile response by direct action on vsm cells remain to be clarified .
cerebral arteries express several types of k + channels [ 17 ] .
these include large conductance calcium activated k + ( bkca ) channels , which are highly expressed in vsm cells and play an essential role in regulating resting membrane potential and , hence , vascular tone [ 17,18 ] .
activation of bkca channels in smooth muscle leads to efflux of k + from the cell and causes hyperpolarization , which decreases the activity of voltage - gated l - type ca2 + channels and subsequently leads to vasorelaxation .
bkca channel inhibition causes depolarization , increasing the activity of voltage gated l - type ca2 + channels and subsequently leads to vasoconstriction [ 19 ] .
bkca channel activity is controlled by multiple factors , including intracellular calcium levels , phosphorylation status , and oxidation state [ 18 ] .
at present , the interaction between apelin and bkca channels in vsm cells is not fully understood .
the purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of apelin - 13 on bkca channel activity and to investigate the intracellular signaling mechanisms by which apelin regulates bkca channels in vsm cells freshly isolated from rat middle cerebral arteries .
our results indicate that apelin - 13 inhibits bkca channel activity in cerebral arterial vsm cells and that the inhibitory action of apelin - 13 is mediated by a g - protein and pi3 - kinase - dependent signaling pathway .

results effect of apelin - 13 on bkca channel currents in vsm cells the effect of apelin - 13 on bkca channel activity was determined in vsm cells freshly isolated from rat middle cerebral artery .
whole - cell bkca currents were recorded at room temperature and in response to successive voltage pulses of 800 ms duration , increasing in 10 - mv increments from - 70 mv to + 50 mv in the absence or presence of apelin - 13 ( 0.1 microm ) .
superfusion with apelin - 13 ( 0.1 microm , 5 min ) significantly reduced bkca current density from 71.25 +/ - 8.14 pa / pf to 44.52 +/ - 7.10 pa / pf ( n = 14 cells , p < 0.05 ) , as depicted in figure 1 .
in addition , the selective bkca channel blocker , iberiotoxin , markedly attenuated most of the whole - cell current in cerebral artery vsm cells under these conditions ( figure 1c and d ) .
the results demonstrate that apelin - 13 inhibits bkca current density in cerebral artery vsm cells in a concentration - dependent manner , beginning at 0.01 microm and reaching a maximum effect at 0.1microm ( figure 1f ) .
in this study , we also determined the time - course of apelin - 13 action on bkca current density in vsm cells .
the response to apelin - 13 was rapid , reaching a peak in 5 min , and lasting at least 30 min .

effect of pertussis toxin on the inhibitory action of apelin - 13 on bkca channel activity it was previously reported that apj receptors expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells are coupled to pertussis toxin - sensitive g proteins ( gi / go protein ) ( 22 , 23 ) .
to further investigate the signaling mechanisms that lead to inhibition of bkca channel activity , the effect of pertussis toxin on apelin - 13 - induced inhibition of bkca in cerebral vsm cells was determined .
the results presented in figure 2 demonstrate that pre - treatment of vsm cells with pertussis toxin ( 100 nm ) completely abolished the inhibitory effect of apelin - 13 , suggesting that the inhibitory effect of apelin - 13 on bkca channels is mediated by apj receptors that are functionally coupled to gi / go proteins .

effects of apelin - 13 on bkca channel activity in cell - attached patches of vsm cells the inhibitory effect of apelin - 13 on bkca channels was confirmed using single channel recording in cell - attached patches from vsm cells .
single channel recording was performed on cells bathed in a high k + solution to control the membrane potential .
treatment of vsm cells with apelin - 13 significantly inhibited the activity of a large conductance channel that carries an outward current .
as shown in figure 3 , apelin - 13 ( 0.1 microm ) significantly reduced bkca channel activity by 38 % .
the probability of channel opening ( npo ) was decreased from 0.0239 +/ - . 00408 to 0.0148 +/ - 0.00267 ( n = 9 , p < 0.05 ) ; however , apelin - 13 did not alter unitary conducance of this channel .

effects of apelin - 13 on bkca channel activity in inside - out patches of vsm cells to investigate whether apelin directly inhibits the bkca channel , bkca channel activity was recorded in inside - out patches of vsm cells before and after application to the recording pipettes .
bkca channel activity was measured in excised inside - out membrane patches of vsm cells .
the results are presented in figure 4 , demonstrating that extracellular application of apelin - 13 did not alter bkca open state probability .
this observation suggests that the inhibitory action of apelin - 13 is mediated by an intracellular signaling pathway rather than acting directly on the channel .
therefore , we performed the following experiments to identify the intracellular signaling pathway underlying the apelin - 13 - induced inhibitory action on bkca channels in vsm cells .

effect of blockade of pi3 - kinase on the action of apelin - 13 on bkca channel activity it has been previously demonstrated that apelin - 13 stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( pi3 - kinase ) in vsm cells [ 23 ] .
thus , we examined the effect of apelin - 13 on bkca channels with and without pretreatment with ly - 294002 , a selective pi3 - kinase inhibitor , in cerebral vsm cells .
the whole - cell bkca current was recorded under control conditions , and in the presence of apelin - 13 ( 0.1 microm , 5 min ) alone , ly - 294002 ( 10 microm , 5 min ) alone , or ly - 294002 plus apelin - 13 .
treatment of vsm cell with ly - 294002 alone did not alter bkca channel activity ; however , pretreatment of vsm cells with ly - 294002 significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of apelin - 13 by 96 % ( figure 5 ) .
these results demonstrate that pi3 - kinase may play a role in the apelin - 13 - induced reduction of bkca channel activity in vsm cells .

effects of apelin - 13 and ly - 294002 on pi3 - kinase activity in cerebral arteries pi3 - kinase activity was detected by the ratio of phosphorylated akt and total akt using western blots in cerebral arteries treated under control conditions and in the presence of apelin - 13 ( 0.1 microm ) alone or apelin - 13 plus ly - 294002 ( 10 microm ) .
apelin - 13 elicited a time - dependent increase in phosphorylation of akt , which peaked at 15 minutes ( figure 6 ) .
treatment with apelin - 13 ( 0.1 microm , 15 min ) induced a two - fold increase in pi3 - kinase activity .
the inhibitory effect of apelin - 13 was completely blocked by coincubation with ly - 294002 .
these results demonstrate that apelin - 13 stimulates pi3 - kinase activity in cerebral arteries , suggesting that pi3 - kinase may be involved in the action of apelin - 13 in vsm cells .

discussion the present study was undertaken to examine the effect of apelin - 13 on bkca channel activity in vsm cells freshly isolated from rat middle cerebral arteries .
the results demonstrate that apelin - 13 inhibits bkca channel activity in a concentration - dependent manner through g - protein and pi3 - kinase dependent signaling pathways , which may contribute to its regulatory action in controlling vascular tone .
this conclusion is supported by the following pieces of evidence : ( 1 ) apelin - 13 inhibits bkca current density in whole cell patches and bkca channel activity in cell - attached patches in vsm cells freshly isolated from rat middle cerebral arteries ; ( 2 ) apelin - 13 did not significantly alter the open state probability of bkca channels in excised inside - out membrane patches ; ( 3 ) the inhibitory effect of apelin - 13 was abolished in the presence of a g - protein inhibitor or pi3 - kinase inhibitor ; and ( 4 ) apelin - 13 significantly increased pi3 - kinase activity in cerebral arteries .
apelin induces vasodilation in isolated human mesenteric and mammary arteries with intact endothelium , an effect that is abolished by nitric oxide synthase inhibitors [ 7,25 ] .
these studies suggest that apelin may act on endothelial apj receptors to generate nitric oxide , which diffuses to underlying vsm cells and produces vasodilation .
in contrast , apelin causes contraction in endothelium - denuded human saphenous veins and mammary arteries [ 15,16 ] .
these studies indicate that apelin elicits both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator responses , either by a direct action on vsm cells or by an indirect effect mediated via endothelial cells , respectively .
although the mechanism of the endothelium - dependent vasodilator effect of apelin is well studied , the cellular mechanism of the direct action of apelin on vsm cells is not fully understood .
the present study provides important new evidence that apelin acts directly on vsm cells to inhibit bkca channels , which could contribute to the vasoconstrictor action of apelin in arteries .
although multiple classes of potassium channels are expressed at varying densities in different vascular beds , the large conductance , calcium - and voltage - activated potassium ( bkca ) channel is the predominant k + channel present in most arteries and plays an essential role in the regulation of vascular tone [ 17,18 ] .
in the current study , apelin - 13 inhibited the whole cell bkca channel current density in a concentration - dependent manner .
this action of apelin - 13 was confirmed in cell - attached patches in cerebral vsm cells isolated from rat middle cerebral artery .
considering previous observations showing that apelin - 13 induces vasoconstriction in endothelium - denuded arteries and veins , we anticipate that the direct inhibitory effect of apelin - 13 on bkca channel activity in vsm cells may contribute to the vasoconstrictor effect of this regulatory peptide .
however , this interpretation still needs further investigation .
the inhibitory effect of apelin on bkca channels was absent in patches excised from the cellular membrane , suggesting that this action of apelin is mediated by intracellular signaling molecules .
thus , we performed several experiments to identify the signaling pathways mediating this effect of apelin .
previous studies demonstrated that apj receptor immunoreactivity was observed in human and rat vsm cells [ 12,13 ] , and that apj is a g protein coupled receptor .
g proteins also are involved in several actions of apelin , such as a positive inotropic effect in the heart [ 14,22,23,26 ] .
consistent with these studies , we demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of apelin - 13 on bkca channels was blocked by pertussis toxin , indicating that gi protein is also involved in the action of apelin in vsm cells .
we also observed that basal levels of akt phosphorylation were increased after preincubation of arteries with apelin - 13 and that this effect was inhibited in the presence of ly - 294002 , a pi3 - kinase inhibitor , suggesting the involvement of pi3 - kinase / akt as a downstream signaling pathway in the signal transduction cascades of apelin - 13 .
this stimulatory effect of apelin on pi3 kinase was reported by another research group in vsm cells [ 24 ] and was also observed in other tissues [ 14,23 ] .
since pi3 - kinase may be involved in the regulation of bkca channel activity [ 27 ] , we studied the role of pi3 - kinase in the action of apelin on bkca channels in vsm cell .
in whole cell recording studies , the inhibitory effect of apelin - 13 on the bkca current was significantly blocked by ly - 294002 , a selective inhibitor for pi3 - kinase , thus providing further evidence for a role for pi3 - kinase in the response to apelin .
however , the downstream signaling pathway involved in pi3 - kinase mediated inhibition of bkca channels is not yet clear .
one possibility is that this action of pi3 - kinase is mediated by a membrane lipid , phosphatidylinositol 4,5 - bisphosphate ( pip2 ) , that is produced by pi3 - kinase .
this hypothesis is supported by an observation in inside - out patches of vsm cells from cerebral arteries , showing that direct addition of pip2 onto the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane significantly increase open probability of bkca channels in vsm cells [ 28 ] .
on the other hand , a recent study from gebremedhin and his colleagues demonstrates that the regulation of bkca channels by pi3 - k could be mediated by akt - dependent phosphorylation of bkca channels in cerebral vsm cells [ 29 ] .
thus , the exact signaling mechanisms underlying pi3 - kinase - induced inhibition of bkca channels in the action of apelin - 13 still need further investigation .
in conclusion , we have demonstrated that apelin - 13 directly acts on vsm cells and inhibits bkca channel activity .
the inhibitory effect of apelin on bkca channels is mediated by a g - protein and pi3 - kinase dependent signaling pathway .
this action of apelin in vsm cells could contribute to its regulatory action in control of vascular tone .

in this study , the flanking sequence of an inserted fragment conferring glyphosate tolerance on transgenic cotton line bg2 - 7 was analyzed by thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction ( tail - pcr ) and standard pcr .
the results showed apparent insertion of the exogenous gene into chromosome d10 of the gossypium hirsutum l. genome , as the left and right borders of the inserted fragment are nucleotides 61,962,952 and 61,962,921 of chromosome d10 , respectively .
in addition , a 31 - bp cotton microsatellite sequence was noted between the genome sequence and the 5 ' end of the exogenous gene .
in total , 84 and 298 bp were deleted from the left and right borders of the exogenous gene , respectively , with 30 bp deleted from the cotton chromosome at the insertion site .
according to the flanking sequence obtained , several pairs of event - specific detection primers were designed to amplify sequence between the 5 ' end of the exogenous gene and the cotton genome junction region as well as between the 3 ' end and the cotton genome junction region .
based on screening tests , the 5 ' - end primers gtcataacgtgactcccttaattctcc / cctattacacggctatgc and 3 ' - end primers tcctttcgctttcttccctt / acacttacatggcgtcttct were used to detect the respective bg2 - 7 event - specific primers .
the limit of detection of the former primers reached 44 copies , and that of the latter primers reached 88 copies .
the results of this study provide useful data for assessment of bg2 - 7 safety and for accelerating its industrialization .

introduction in agricultural production , genetically modified technology can save in labor costs , improve crop quality , increase production , and reduce pesticide applications .
genetic modifications in agriculture have made important contributions to mitigating the global energy crisis and have helped to address the growing demand for food [ 1 ] .
however , despite the lack of evidence that genetically modified organisms ( gmos ) cause harm to human health or the environment , a variety of controversies have arisen regarding the safety of gmos [ 2 - 4 ] , including biosafety , environmental , and ethical concerns [ 5 - 9 ] .
nonetheless , the global area cultivated with transgenic crops has increased from 1.7 million hectares in 1996 to 200 million hectares in 2015 [ 10 ] .
cotton ( gossypium hirsutum ) , an important economic crop for the textile industry , is also grown for food and , in particular , as a source of animal feed in many areas of the world [ 11 ] .
currently , cotton is commercially cultivated in more than 70 countries , including the usa , china , and many developing countries .
one of the most important goals is to improve the agronomic performance of cotton , especially with respect to resistance to insects and tolerance to herbicides , using transgenic technology .
notably , transgenic herbicide - tolerant cotton provides an excellent approach to weed control for cotton farmers , providing considerable economic and societal benefits [ 12 ]. through transformation of cp4 - epsps , the monsanto company has developed and commercialized a number of transgenic glyphosate - tolerant crop varieties , including genetically modified cotton .
due to patent laws , monsanto holds a monopoly in relation to global competition , and because chinese research began after that of monsanto , no marketable proprietary transgenic glyphosate - resistant cotton varieties have been developed to date in china .
to ensure biosafety and to protect the interests of the import and export trade of agricultural products , countries have established a system of safety assessment , supervision and management of genetically modified crops .
thus , gmo detection technologies have become an important research topic [ 13 - 16 ] .
the detection of exogenous components in transgenic crops and their products is mainly concentrated in two areas : exogenous dna molecules and novel expression of exogenous proteins ; typical detection methods for these two types of targets include polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and immunoassay , respectively .
pcr is a very effective and reliable method for nucleic acid detection and has the advantages of being rapid and convenient , with high specificity and high sensitivity [ 17 ] .
indeed , pcr is the most established and widely used method for detecting genetically modified products [ 18 , 19 ] .
according to the targets to be detected , pcr assays are mainly divided into four types : 1 ) screening tests , the targets of which are the specific promoter and terminator ; 2 ) gene - specific detection , the targets of which are specific exogenous genes ; 3 ) structure - specific detection , the targets of which are the specific structures of transgenic elements ; and 4 ) event - specific detection , the targets of which are a flanking junction sequence between the exogenous dna and the plant genome .
the flanking junction sequence is particularly important for the identification of different transgenic crop lines .
therefore , event - specific detection is able to quickly and accurately identify different lines of transgenic crops [ 20 ] .
many studies have investigated the flanking sequences of insect - resistant transgenic crops [ 16 , 21 , 22 ] .
however , there are no reports to date on the flanking sequences of glyphosate - tolerant transgenic cotton from china .
the g2 - aroa gene ( genbank accession no : ef155478 ) was identified from the g2 strain of pseudomonas fluorescens isolated from a glyphosate - polluted area .
this gene encodes the 445 aa epsps protein , which confers glyphosate resistance [ 23 ] .
the transgenic cotton line bg2 - 7 containing the glyphosate - tolerance gene g2 - aroa was generated in our laboratory via agrobacterium - mediated transformation using the upland cotton cultivar coker 312 as the receptor .
southern blotting showed a single - copy insertion of g2 - aroa in bg2 - 7 , and an experiment testing glyphosate tolerance indicated that bg2 - 7 can survive 8000 ppm of the herbicide roundup ( isopropylamine salt of glyphosate as the active ingredient , 41.0 %( w / v )) [ 24 ] .
in the present study , we analyzed the molecular characteristics of bg2 - 7 and established an event - specific pcr detection system for this line .
the results of this study provide useful data for bg2 - 7 safety assessment and acceleration of the industrialization process of this line .

standard pcr [ 21 , 26 ] was conducted using transgenic cotton bg2 - 7 genomic dna as the template .
the predicted electrophoretic bands were recovered and the gene sequenced , and the flanking sequence of the right boundary of the t - dna was verified .
establishment of the event - specific pcr detection method primer screening upstream and downstream screening primers were designed according to the flanking sequences of the left and right boundaries of the t - dna ; these primers were matched in pairs .
genomic dna from the wild - type line and transgenic line bg2 - 7 was used as templates .
pcr was conducted with an initial step of 95degreesc for 5 min , followed by 34 cycles of 95degreesc for 30 s , 50 - 65degreesc for 45 s , and 72degreesc for 1 min , with a final extension at 72degreesc for 10 min .
specificity verification the specificity of selected primers was verified by pcr , which was conducted using genomic dna isolated from cotton ( island cotton 7412 , upland cotton k312 and transgenic cotton bg2 - 7 ) , rice ( zhonghua 11 and tp 309 ) , maize ( zhengdan 958 and heinuo maize ) , wheat ( beijing 14 and salgem ) , soybean ( r2 and lingbei 8 ) , and tobacco ( nc 89 ) as templates .
the pcr amplification products were detected by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis .
the endogenous sad l gene was used to detect the genomic dna quantity of different cotton varieties .
sensitivity testing according to mass percentage concentration , 10.00 % , 1.00 % , 0.50 % , 0.10 % , 0.05 % and 0 % solutions of transgenic cotton genomic dna were prepared with 100 ng / mul genomic dna from wild - type k312 and 100 ng / mul genomic dna from transgenic cotton bg2 - 7 .
all of the genomic dna solutions were used as templates .
the sensitivity of selected primers was assessed using pcr .
the detection method [ 13 ] for pcr amplification products was the same as above .
results and discussion determination and analysis of the flanking sequences of transgenic cotton bg2 - 7 determination of the flanking sequence of the 5 ' - terminus of the exogenous gene the flanking sequences of the 5 ' - terminus of the inserted gene were obtained by tail - pcr amplification and verified by pcr .
the flanking sequences were aligned with the known vector sequence , showing overlapping sequences of 431 bp with a similarity of 100 % .
the remaining sequence is an unknown sequence of approximately 734 bp. according to a blastn search , 626 bp of the sequence exhibits 94.2 % similarity to the sequence of gossypium raimondii chromosome 11 , with 97.0 % similarity to gossypium hirsutum l. chromosome d10 .
determination of the flanking sequence of the 3 ' - terminus of the exogenous gene we also attempted to amplify the flanking sequence of the 3 ' - terminal end of the inserted gene using tail - pcr and primers including the 3 ' - terminal special primer designed according to the right boundary of the t - dna and arbitrary primers from the genome walking kit .
however , specific bands were not identified .
the reason for this may be related to the specificity of the designed primers and the particular complexity of the allotetraploid genome of upland cotton ( gossypium hirsutum l . )
[ 27 ] .
the following method was adopted to analyze the flanking sequence of the 3 ' - terminus of the inserted dna .
based on the known sequence of the 5 ' - terminus of the inserted sequence , the partial dna sequence of the gossypium raimondii genome from 61,252,000 to 61,253,972 of chromosome 11 were downloaded from phytozome .
upstream primers were designed for the 3 ' - terminal boundary of the exogenous dna , and downstream primers were designed for the downloaded cotton genome sequence .
standard pcr was then performed using bg2 - 7 genomic dna as the template .
according to gel electrophoresis , there were anticipated objective strips in size among the obtained electrophoresis strips .
the corresponding bands were recovered , ligated to the t - vector , transformed into e. coli , sequenced , and aligned .
ultimately , the 3 ' - terminal flanking sequence was identified .
analysis of insertion structure characteristics the cotton genome sequence on both sides of the exogenous inserted dna were obtained via amplification of the 5 ' - terminal flanking sequence of the inserted gene according to the genome walking method and amplification of the 3 ' - terminal flanking sequence using standard pcr .
the results of a bioinformatic - based comparison indicate that the exogenous dna is inserted into chromosome d10 ( fig 1 ) .
specifically , the 5 ' - terminus of the t - dna is inserted at position 61,962,952 of cotton chromosome d10 .
further analysis reveals that 81 bp are deleted from the left boundary of the 5 ' - terminal end of the exogenous sequence ; 31 bp ( ctgcttttcaagaggtcggtgcattaaaagg ) form a microsatellite dna sequence between the left boundary of the 5 ' - terminal end of the exogenous sequence and the cotton genome .
the 3 ' - terminal end of the exogenous dna is inserted at position 61,962,921 of cotton chromosome d10 , with deletion of 298 bp from the right boundary of the t - dna and 30 bp of cotton chromosome d10 .

note : the underline represents the missing bases .
it is generally accepted that the process of agrobacterium t - dna integration into the cotton genome is similar to gene recombination [ 28 ] .
part of the sequence of the t - dna left border was deleted via the integration of the exogenous gene .
in addition , a microsatellite dna sequence ( filler dna ) , which was produced due to the low accuracy of dna repair , was inserted between the 5 ' - terminal sequence of the exogenous gene and the cotton chromosome , similar to the reported structure of the left border junction region of an arabidopsis thaliana transformant [ 28,29 ] .
the sequence of the t - dna right border was completely deleted , similar to the structure of the right border junction region of co - transformed rice [ 30 ] .
the reason for the above results may be associated with dna repair factors or replication enzymes in cotton that are not exactly identical to those in rice or arabidopsis thaliana .
establishment of an event - specific pcr detection method to ensure the repeatability and credibility of developed pcr systems , positive controls for the endogenous reference gene and exogenous gene are necessary [ 13 ] .
the sad l gene is specific in different species but exhibits low heterogeneity among cotton cultivars .
two copies of the sad l gene are present in the haploid cotton genome [ 25 ] .
a primer pair of sad l - f / sad l - r for the endogenous sad l gene was selected and successfully used to amplify a 107 - bp fragment using dna from island cotton 7124 , upland cotton k312 , and transgenic cotton bg2 - 7 as well as plasmid dna .
however , no fragment was amplified from the negative control , i.e. , double - distilled water ( fig 2 ( a )) , suggesting that the various genomic dna extracted was completely suitable for pcr .
the primer pair of g2 - f - 1 / g2 - r - 2 for the exogenous gene g2 - aroa was used to amplify an 896 - bp fragment from the t - dna of transgenic cotton bg2 - 7 and plasmid dna , whereas no fragment was amplified from the other samples ( fig 2 ( b )) .
according to the tests for the cotton endogenous reference gene sad l and the exogenous gene g2 - aroa , factors , including dna quality and experimental operation , that might affect the reliability of the results or false - negative results were excluded .

to establish an event - specific pcr detection system , primer pairs should be designed based upon the specific sequences of the integrated dna fragment of the flanking region .
for each pair of primers , one primer was located in the cotton genome and the other on the t - dna .
both upstream and downstream primers were designed , and through one - to - one combinatorial screening , primer pair 5 ' - f3 / 5 ' - r1 was selected as the 5 ' - terminal flanking sequence - specific detection primers and primer pair 3 ' - f6 / 3 ' - r12 as the 3 ' - terminal flanking sequence - specific detection primer .
these primer pairs were chosen because their amplification efficiency and specificity were better than other combinations .
the size of the 5 ' - terminus amplified target fragment was 645 bp , and the size of other product was 642 bp. simplex pcr for the 5 ' - terminus and other terminus - specific detection was conducted at annealing temperatures of 55degreesc and 58degreesc , respectively .
the intraspecific specificity of primers 5 ' - f3 / 5 ' - r1 and 3 ' - f6 / 3 ' - r12 was verified using genomic dna from different cotton varieties , and the expected 645 - bp and 642 - bp fragments , respectively , were amplified only using dna from transgenic cotton line bg2 - 7 ( fig 3 ) .
the interspecific specificity of primers 5 ' - f3 / 5 ' - r1 and 3 ' - f6 / 3 ' - r12 was verified using genomic dna from different crops including rice , maize , wheat , soybean and tobacco ; except for transgenic cotton , no band was amplified from these samples ( fig 4 ) .
therefore , these two primer pairs can be successfully used to discriminate a single transgenic cotton variety from other samples .
this result was mainly attributed to the specificity of the primer pairs designed to amplify specific fragments of the flanking region of the insertion site .

because degraded or a low amount of dna derived from transgenic feed or food is often the only material available for practical detection applications , a pcr detection system must have high sensitivity [ 13 ] .
to test the limits of the established qualitative pcr detection systems , mixed dna solutions were used as templates .
in these samples , the concentrations of transgenic cotton bg2 - 7 genomic dna were 10 % , 1 % , 0.50 % , 0.10 % , 0.05 % and 0 % .
the results indicate that the 645 - bp dna target fragments of the 5 ' - terminal event - specific primers were detected at all five levels , except for the negative control , with approximately 44 haploid genome copies ( fig 5 ( a )) .
in addition , the 642 - bp dna target fragment of the 3 ' - terminal event - specific primers were detected at the levels tested , with the exception of the 0.05 % level and the negative control , with approximately 88 haploid genome copies ( fig 5 ( b )) .
the above findings indicate that the established qualitative pcr detection systems are suitable for the practical detection of transgenic cotton bg2 - 7 samples .
the detection limits were acceptable and met the labeling requirements of regulations in china , the eu ( 0.9 %) , korea ( 5.0 %) , and japan ( 3.0 %) [ 13 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0158384.g005 fig 5 sensitivity tests for the event - specific primer pairs 5 ' - f3 / 5 ' - r1 ( a ) and 3 ' - f6 / 3 ' - r12 ( b ) .
m : trans2ktm dna marker ; 1 - 6 : the contents of the transgenic cotton bg2 - 7 genome dna were 10.00 % , 1.00 % , 0.50 % , 0.10 % , 0.05 % and 0 % , respectively .
quantitative detection of genetically modified samples is also very important , and event - specific pcr primer pairs that are not only suitable for qualitative detection but can also be applied for quantitative determination are optimal for genetically modified samples .
unfortunately , the most ideal primers were not obtained by screening .
fortunately , the primer pair that was used to determine the copy number of the g2 - aroa gene in transgenic cotton using quantitative real - time pcr ( data not shown ) can also be applied for the quantitative detection of transgenic cotton bg2 - 7 .
conclusions in conclusion , the flanking sequence of an inserted exogenous fragment in bg2 - 7 was analyzed by tail - pcr and standard pcr .
according to the flanking sequence obtained , event - specific conventional pcr systems were established that could be successfully used for detecting transgenic cotton bg2 - 7 , providing useful data for bg2 - 7 safety assessment .

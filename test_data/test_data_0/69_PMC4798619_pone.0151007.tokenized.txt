serum phosphorus ( p ) concentration is associated with coronary artery calcification ( cac ) as well as cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease .
it has been suggested that this relationship is extended to subjects without renal dysfunction , but further explorations in diverse races and regions are still needed .
we performed a cross - sectional study of 2,509 korean subjects ( far eastern asian ) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of >= 60 ml / min / 1.73m2 and who underwent coronary computerized tomography .
serum p concentration was divided into pre - determined 4 categories : <= 3.2 , 3.2 < to <= 3.6 , 3.6 < to <= 4.0 and > 4.0 mg / dl. agatston score ( as ) , an index of cac , was divided into 3 categories : 0 , 0 < to <= 100 , and > 100 .
a multinomial logit model ( baseline outcome : as = 0 ) was applied to estimate the odds ratio ( or ) for each serum p category ( reference : <= 3.2mg / dl ) .
mean age of subjects was 53.5 +/ - 9.1 years and 36.9 % were female .
in the adjusted model , serum p concentration of 3.6 < to <= 4.0 mg / dl and > 4.0 mg / dl showed high ors for as of > 100 [ or : 1.58 , 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) : 1.04 - 2.40 and or : 2.11 , 95 % ci : 1.34 - 3.32 , respectively ] .
a unit ( mg / dl ) increase in serum p concentration was associated with 50 % increase in risk of as > 100 ( or : 1.50 , 95 % ci : 1.16 - 1.94 ) .
a higher serum p concentration , even within a normal range , may be associated with a higher cac in subjects with normal renal function .

introduction phosphorus ( p ) plays an essential role in various biological processes including energy metabolism , cellular signaling , nucleic acid synthesis and the stabilization of cell membranes .
the serum p concentration is influenced by both uptake and excretion with homeostasis tightly regulated within a narrow range by the fibroblast growth factor - 23 ( fgf - 23 ) , 1,25 - dihydroxy - cholecalciferol [ 1,25 ( oh ) 2d3 ] , and parathyroid hormone ( pth ) .
elevated serum p concentration may link with vascular calcification pathophysiologically [ 1 - 5 ] , and it has been accepted as an important risk factor for vascular calcification [ 6 , 7 ] as well as cardiovascular ( cv ) outcomes [ 8 - 12 ] in patients with chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) .
an association between serum p concentration and vascular calcification has been extended in subjects with preserved renal function by previous studies [ 13 - 15 ] , but more evidence from diverse population , especially beyond racial or regional difference , is needed to validate it. in our previous study of 402 healthy korean ( far eastern asian ) subjects , we observed that coronary artery calcification ( cac ) on coronary computerized tomography ( ct ) was positively correlated to serum p concentration measured 10 years earlier [ 16 ] .
although the study somewhat supported a temporality , the association needs to be further validated in a larger and different cohort .
in this study , we conducted a cross - sectional study examining the association between serum p concentration and cac using agatston score ( as ) , as a predictor of future coronary events [ 17 , 18 ] , in a total of 2,509 healthy subjects without renal dysfunction .
methods subjects we retrospectively reviewed all subjects who underwent coronary ct for screening purpose at the general health promotion center in ulsan university hospital , ulsan , south korea between january , 2009 and december , 2013 .
included were subjects aged >= 18 years , those with an available serum p concentration at the time of ct , an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) was >= 60 ml / min / 1.73 m2 and a negative dipstick test for albuminuria .
egfr was calculated with the modification of diet in renal disease equation : egfr = 186 x ( serum creatinine ) - 1.154 x age - 0.203 x [ 0.742 if female ] [ 19 , 20 ] .
excluded were those with a previous history of overt vascular events which were defined as : 1 ) coronary artery disease requiring intervention or medical treatment , 2 ) cerebral infarction or hemorrhage , and 3 ) atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease .
this study was approved by the institutional review board ( irb ) of ethics committees at ulsan university hospital ( irb no. 2015 - 05 - 015 ) .
subjects' information was anonymized and de - identified prior to analysis .
given anonymity of the subjects studied , and the nonintrusive nature of the research , requirement for written informed consent was exempted by the irb .
data collection data was obtained using the electronic medical recording system of ulsan university hospital .
serum p concentration was the main exposure .
covariates included age , sex , diabetes mellitus ( dm ) , hypertension ( htn ) , body mass index ( bmi ) , systolic blood pressure ( sbp ) , corrected serum calcium , hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) , albumin , high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol , and low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol .
each participant completed a self - administered questionnaire which assessed medical history of htn , dm , cv diseases , or current medications .
dm was defined as fasting serum glucose >= 126 mg / dl , hba1c >= 6.5 % or the use of blood glucose lowering agents [ 21 ] .
htn was defined as a sbp >= 140 mmhg , diastolic bp >= 90 mmhg or current use of antihypertensive medication [ 22 ] .
blood sampling was done at morning after at least 8 - hour fasting duration .
serum p concentration was measured using an automated clinical chemistry analyzer ( modular p analyzers ; roche diagnostics , tokyo , japan ) .
all reagent , calibrator , and control were used according to the manufacturer 's recommendation .
the coefficient of variation for serum p determination was < 1.8 % and < 1.9 % for low and high level quality control specimens , respectively .
corrected serum calcium concentration was calculated as : corrected serum calcium ( mg / dl ) = total serum calcium ( mg / dl ) + 0.8 x [ 4.0 - - serum albumin ( g / dl )] .
cac , the main outcome , was quantified as the as on coronary ct [ 23 - 25 ] .
all ct imaging were performed using a 3 - mm thickness 256 - slice ct scanner ( brilliance ict , philips medical systems , the netherlands ) with prospective ecg triggering .
scan parameters were as follows : tube voltage , 120 kvp ; tube current , 100 mas ; 220 mm field of view ; rotation time , 0.27 s / rotation ; reconstructed slice thickness , 0.8 - mm ; signal acquisition at 80 % of the r - r interval .
there were no gaps between the slices .
cac was measured using the extended brilliance workspace workstation ( philips medical systems , the netherlands ) after reconstruction .
cac was automatically displayed in color by calcium scoring software .
attenuation above the threshold of 130 hu was automatically marked as potential calcifications , and an experienced radiologist identified cac by noise detection with manual placement at regions of interest showing cac .
total as was calculated by adding all values of the left main , left anterior descending , left circumflex and right coronary artery .
statistical analysis data were expressed as mean +/ - standard deviation for continuous variables and as percentage (%) for discrete variables .
serum p concentration was divided into pre - defined 4 categories : <= 3.2 , 3.2 < to <= 3.6 , 3.6 < to <= 4.0 and > 4.0 mg / dl. we set 3.6 mg / dl as midpoint based on the mean concentration found from our previous research but the range of each group , 0.4 mg / dl was chosen arbitrarily [ 16 ] .
as was divided into 3 categories : 0 , 0 < to <= 100 , and > 100 .
multinomial logit model ( baseline outcome : as = 0 ) was applied to estimate the odds ratio ( or ) for each serum p category ( reference : <= 3.2mg / dl ) .
three levels of stepwise adjustments were done : 1 ) unadjusted model , 2 ) case - mix adjusted model including age , sex , dm and htn , 3 ) fully adjusted model including all of covariates in the model 2 plus bmi , sbp , corrected serum calcium , albumin , hba1c , ldl and hdl cholesterol .
in data for covariates , there were no missing values for age , sex , dm , htn and bmi .
percentages of missing in sbp , corrected serum calcium , albumin , hba1c , ldl and hdl cholesterol were 1.2 % , 0.2 % , 0.2 % , 12.4 % , 5.9 % and 5.8 % , respectively .
missing values were imputed using the mean of the existing values according to serum p categories .
we undertook sensitivity analyses separately without imputing missing data , and compared with main results .
statistical analyses were done using stata mp version 12 .
all statistical tests were two - sided and p < 0.05 was considered significant .
results baseline characteristics a total of 3,523 subjects underwent coronary ct during the screening period .
60 subjects had two coronary cts performed with a 2 - year interval between each scan , but only the first ct data was included in the analysis .
954 subjects were excluded for the following reasons : 468 subjects had missing serum p concentration ; 34 subjects had previous history of overt vascular events ; and 452 subjects had an egfr below 60 ml / min / 1.73m2 and / or albuminuria on urine dipstick .
thus , remaining were 2,509 subjects were included for analysis .
the mean age of the subjects was 53.5 +/ - 9.1 years and 36.9 % were female .
all subjects were far eastern asian by racial origin .
9.7 % of subjects had dm and 21.4 % had hypertension .
the prevalence of dm was similar to that observed in the general population in south korea ( male 12.8 % , female 9.1 %) , but prevalence of htn was lower than the reported national figures ( male 32.4 % , female 22.2 %) [ 26 ] .
mean serum creatinine concentration was 0.9 +/ - 0.2 mg / dl and mean egfr was 79 +/ - 12 ml / min / 1.73 m2 .
mean serum p concentration was 3.7 +/ - 0.6 mg / dl ( normal range in adults : 2.5 - 4.5 mg / dl ) .
baseline characteristics according to serum p categories are summarized in table 1 .
patients' age was slightly older and the proportion of women gradually increased in higher serum p categories .
mean serum p concentration was higher in women than in men ( 3.8 +/ - 0.5 mg / dl vs. 3.6 +/ - 0.5 mg / dl , p < 0.001 ) .
the prevalence of dm was similar among the categories , but htn was observed less frequently in serum p concentration of 3.2 < to <= 3.6 mg / dl. bmi significantly decreased along with increase in serum p concentration .
the difference , however , was not large and correlation coefficient was small ( r = - 0.06 , p = 0.003 ) .
systolic bp was slightly lower in high serum p categories .
corrected serum calcium concentration increased along with serum p concentration , and showed a weak correlation ( r = 0.10 , p < 0.001 ) .
serum albumin concentration did not differ in clinical aspect among serum p categories although mean values were different statistically ( p = 0.02 ) .
ldl cholesterol concentration was lower in serum p concentration of <= 3.2 mg / dl , whereas hdl cholesterol was higher in that of > 4.0 mg / dl .

serum phosphorus concentration and coronary artery calcification among the 2,509 subjects , 1,587 subjects ( 63.2 %) had an as of 0 , 615 ( 24.5 %) had as of 0 < to <= 100 , and 307 ( 12.2 %) had as of > 100 .
as shown in table 1 , the proportion of 3 as levels did not differ significantly among the serum p categories , but the prevalence of as of > 100 tended to be slightly higher in the serum p concentrations of 3.6 < to <= 4.0 and > 4.0 mg / dl. in the unadjusted model , when modeling both as of 0 vs. 0 < to <= 100 and 0 vs. > 100 , the ors for high as were not significantly increased in serum p concentrations of 3.2 < to <= 3.6 mg / dl , 3.6 < to <= 4.0 mg / dl and > 4.0 mg / dl compared with that of <= 3.2 mg / dl ( table 2 ) .
however , in the case - mix adjusted model , the ors for subjects to have as of > 100 was significantly higher in serum p concentration of 3.6 < to <= 4.0 mg and > 4.0 mg / dl [ or : 1.52 , 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) : 1.01 - 2.30 ) and or : 2.01 , 95 % ci : 1.28 - 3.13 ] .
similar result was observed in the fully adjusted model .
serum p concentration was not significantly related with risk for as of 0 < to <= 100 .
however , serum p concentrations of 3.6 < to <= 4.0 mg / dl and > 4.0 mg / dl was associated with 58 % and 111 % higher risks of as over 100 [ or : 1.58 , 95 % ci : 1.04 - 2.40 and or : 2.11 , 95 % : 1.34 - 3.32 ] .

discussion this study showed that a higher serum p concentration was significantly associated with cac in far eastern asian subjects with preserved renal function .
the association was observed even when serum p was within the normal range .
in ckd , body p is retained and serum p concentration increases because of decrease in overall functioning nephrons [ 27 ] .
hyperphosphatemia has emerged as an important non - traditional risk factor for cv disease and mortality in ckd patients [ 8 - 12 ] .
these findings have been extended to subjects with preserved renal function [ 28 , 29 ] .
foley et al. observed that a higher serum p concentration was associated with greater likelihood of higher cac score categories in 3,015 young adults with normal renal function [ 13 ] .
cancela et al. found that , in 209 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography ( creatinine clearance > 60 ml / min / 1.73m2 ) , each 0.1 - mg / dl rise in serum p concentration was associated with a 9.2 % higher odds of having as of > 10 [ 14 ] .
these two studies , however , observed limited populations : young white and african - american adults , and brazilian ( white and non - white ) patients undergoing elective coronary angiography .
it is worthy to explore the association in racially and regionally different populations .
in our previous study of 402 korean subjects with egfr > 60 ml / min / 1.73m2 , we estimated an or of 3.89 ( 95 % ci : 1.43 - 10.63 ) for an as of > 100 in those with serum p of 3.6 < to <= 3.9 mg / dl and an or of 3.17 ( 95 % ci : 1.19 - 8.41 ) in those with serum p concentration of > 3.9 mg / dl compared to those with serum p concentration of < 3.3 mg / dl [ 16 ] .
in this study with different and larger number of subjects , we validated a serum p - - cac association in asian peoples again .
subjects with serum p concentration of 3.6 < to <= 4.0 mg / dl and > 4.0 mg / dl showed 58 % and 111 % higher risks for having as of > 100 compared to serum p concentration of <= 3.2 mg / dl ( or : 1.58 , 95 % ci : 1.04 - 2.40 and or : 2.11 , 95 % ci : 1.34 - 3.32 , respectively ) .
the ors were smaller than those of our previous report , and 95 % ci were narrower .
it might be due to large sample size in part .
a recent report from other large korean cohort without ckd ( n = 23,652 ) was comparable with our observation , although the subjects tended to be younger ( mean age : 40.8 +/ - 7.3 years ) and male dominantly ( 83.5 %) .
kwak et al. found that the prevalence ratio ( 95 % ci ) comparing the highest quartile of serum p concentration (>= 3.9 mg / dl ) to the lowest quartile (< 3.4 mg / dl ) were 1.70 ( 1.50 - 1.93 ) for as of 1 - 100 and 1.93 ( 1.43 - 2.61 ) for as of > 100 [ 15 ] .
although a full biological understanding of these findings has not been reached yet , the relation of serum p concentration with cac may be important concern in the view of public health .
in above - mentioned studies , even a high normal serum p concentration was associated with risk of cac .
potential interventions that can decrease p burden or serum p concentration already exist [ 30 , 31 ] .
our findings suggests that clinical trials to high - risk individuals in general population has the potential to improve public health [ 32 ] .
we used as for scoring the amount of cac .
the as is the product of the within - slice cac plaque area and a plaque - specific density factor which reflects increasing categories of hounsfield unit , summed for all cardiac ct slices .
thus , the as is weighted upward for greater cac density .
criqui et al. reported that cac volume was positively associated with coronary heart disease and cv disease risk , but at any level of cac volume , cac density was inversely associated with the risks [ 33 ] .
in these lines , serum p concentration needs to be examined against cac density , which may allow us to better assess the risk .
this study has several limitations .
firstly , there was no data collected on serum fgf - 23 , intact pth , and calcitriol concentrations , which are key regulatory hormones for serum p concentration .
however , subjects with egfr > 60 ml / min / 1.73m2 are unlikely to have abnormal intact pth and calcitriol levels .
the potential confounding from the absence of this intact pth and calcitriol data is minimal but cannot be completely excluded .
the possible association between serum fgf - 23 concentration and cac has been suggested [ 34 , 35 ] but a recent report showed that baseline plasma fgf - 23 was not associated with the prevalence or severity of cac. and a higher serum p level was associated with cac , even after adjustment for fgf - 23 level [ 36 ] .
in subject without renal insufficiency , serum fgf - 23 was not related with cac and did not affect serum p - - cac association [ 14 ] .
second , dietary intake of calcium and p was not quantified and incorporated .
the reason for a higher serum p concentration could not be elucidated from this study .
third , it was possible that co - morbid conditions such as mild pre - existing cv disease or other chronic illness were not identified because we included asymptomatic individuals who underwent a general health examination .
smoking status and use of anti - platelet agents or statins were not considered .
these could act as residual confoundings .
fourth , serum p concentrations vary by as much as 50 % on a normal day , which reflects the effect of food intake but also an underlying circadian rhythm [ 37 ] .
however , blood samples were drawn at morning after at least 8 - hour fasting in this study , so a potential bias from wide physiologic variation could be minimized .
fifth , chronic inflammation , one of the important factors related with vascular calcification , was not considered .
we did not have data for inflammatory markers such as c - reactive protein .
although our models included serum albumin level which can reflect inflammatory state in part , it might be insufficient .
last , a cross - sectional design precludes the evaluation of temporality and causality .
in addition , cac is an intermediate outcome .
although cac is a good marker of future coronary events , the association found here should be carefully interpreted .
further studies using crucial clinical outcomes such as incident coronary artery disease or cv mortality are warranted .
in conclusion , a high serum p concentration , even within normal range , may be significantly associated with cac in subjects without renal dysfunction .
this association can be generalized beyond racial and regional difference .
it may be important concern in the view of public health , and further studies are warranted indeed .

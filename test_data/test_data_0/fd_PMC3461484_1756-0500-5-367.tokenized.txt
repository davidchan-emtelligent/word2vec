background acpype ( or antechamber python parser interface ) is a wrapper script around the antechamber software that simplifies the generation of small molecule topologies and parameters for a variety of molecular dynamics programmes like gromacs , charmm and cns .
it is written in the python programming language and was developed as a tool for interfacing with other python based applications such as the ccpn software suite ( for nmr data analysis ) and aria ( for structure calculations from nmr data ) .
acpype is open source code , under gnu gpl v3 , and is available as a stand - alone application at http :// www.ccpn.ac.uk / acpype and as a web portal application at http :// webapps.ccpn.ac.uk / acpype .
findings we verified the topologies generated by acpype in three ways : by comparing with default amber topologies for standard amino acids ; by generating and verifying topologies for a large set of ligands from the pdb ; and by recalculating the structures for 5 protein - ligand complexes from the pdb .
conclusions acpype is a tool that simplifies the automatic generation of topology and parameters in different formats for different molecular mechanics programmes , including calculation of partial charges , while being object oriented for integration with other applications .
md gromacs amber cns antechamber nmr ligand topology findings here we introduce acpype , a tool based on antechamber [ 1 ] for generating automatic topologies and parameters in different formats for different molecular mechanics programmes , including calculation of partial charges .
in other to validate acpype , we verified its topologies generated in three detailed ways : 1 ) by comparing with default amber [ 2 ] topologies for standard amino acids ; 2 ) by generating and verifying topologies for a large set of ligands from the protein data bank ( pdb ) [ 3 ]) ; and 3 ) by recalculating the structures for 5 protein - ligand complexes from the pdb .
the figure 1 summarises its resources and features , giving a general overview of how acpype works .

background molecular mechanics ( mm ) has evolved substantially over the last decades , not only because of major advances in computational power , but also due to more accurate and diverse force field descriptions .
molecular dynamics ( md ) and nmr structure calculation software ( nmr - sc ) have matured in line with these advances in mm to become more complex , faster and precise ; md and nmr - sc software packages can now perform calculations that were previously thought to be very difficult to handle [ 4 ] .
such calculations , however , always depend on a precise and complete description of the topology and physical parameters of the molecules they tackle .
the methods to obtain these descriptions are well developed for common bio - molecular components like amino acids and nucleic acids , but reliable and automatic procedures to obtain this information for heterogeneous chemical compounds are scarce .
researchers trying to address , for example , protein - ligand complexes often have to manually create the topologies for their ligands , a procedure which creates additional overhead and which often results in errors in the final coordinate files ( as evidenced by many ligand errors in entries in the pdb ) .
acpype resulted from our need to find a solution to this problem for nmr - sc using the cns software [ 5 ] : the simulated annealing ( sa ) and water refinement ( wr ) procedures for protein - ligand complexes require a full topological description of the ligand , including hydrogens to handle interatomic distance restraints from nmr .
we first explored a host of existing solutions ; unfortunately none of them generated the required topologies .
cns and xplor ( including its variant xplor - nih [ 6,7 ]) have a function called learn that only generates parameter information , no topology nor charges .
xplo2d [ 8 ] , one of the first tools to address the problem of generating topological parameters for small molecules , also does not calculate charges .
both approaches are not amenable for the now almost mandatory final water refinement step in an nmr structure calculation protocol .
a more recent and well - known application is prodrg [ 9 ] .
however , in order to speed up calculations prodrg uses the concept of " united - atoms " where no explicit hydrogen atoms are present , and its topologies are unsuitable for all - atom force fields and water refinement .
the glycans [ 10 ] tool generates the required topological parameters in cns format but has limited scope as it only works for polysaccharides .
the mktop program [ 11 ] can define atom types and hence topological parameters , but it cannot derive partial charges and only recently became able to generate topologies for amber03 [ 12 ] force field ( besides the opls / aa [ 13 ]) .
finally , the recently developed automated topology builder ( atb ) [ 14 ] is limited in scope because it only generates topologies compatible with the gromos 53a6 [ 15 ] force field .
the tool we identified as having the most relevant functionality was antechamber [ 1 ] .
it is the main tool for creating variants in amber force fields [ 16 ] , has foundations in quantum mechanics rather than empirical data , and is iteratively improved based on experience from previous force fields implementations .
it is already used to automatically generate topologies with the general amber force field ( gaff [ 17 ]) , and although amber force fields are ported to cns / xplor [ 5,7 ] , the antechamber output has to be interpreted and converted before it becomes useful .
a similar tool called cgenff [ 18 ] generates charmm general force field topology for small molecules , but is more recent and does not have as wide a user base .
we therefore chose antechamber as the starting point for acpype , with the aim to facilitate and automate its operation for non - amber users , as well as extending its use to other python based applications .
acpype is already successfully used in the scientific community ; it is released under the open source gnu gpl version 3 license , is freely available , and offers a reliable solution for generating topologies and parameters for small chemical compounds in all - atom force fields in the following platforms : cns / xplor , gromacs and charmm [ 19 ] .
it also automates several steps necessary to create a library for a small molecule for the amber package .
the topologies generated by acpype can be further used in amber force fields as ported to gromacs ( viz .
ffamber [ 20 ]) , cns / xplor , namd [ 21 ] and charmm ) without breaking the compatibility of the force field .
acpype is object oriented and uses an api library that can be easily extended , so new routines for as yet unsupported md packages are easily added .
methods implementation acpype collects information about the molecular system from the input molecular coordinate file and from the topology and parameters as generated by antechamber and the tleap , sleap or xleap amber tools .
it then creates a python object where all this information is combined ( see figure 1 for a general overview ) .
acpype requires python 2.6 ( or higher ) and antechamber ( version from ambertools12 is recommended , although it should work with older versions ) .
openbabel [ 22,23 ] installation is optional but required for reading molecule information from pdb - style files .
python , antechamber / ambertools and openbabel are freely available .
acpype is executed by the command ' acpype [ options ]' , where the main options are : . - i < filename > : an input coordinate file is required in one of the following formats : mol2 , pdb or mdl .
.
- n [ int ] : this option defines the net charge of the molecule .
if not given , acpype will use the gasteiger method [ 24 ] to guess the charge .
this is not a dependable procedure , however , and might result in an incorrect overabundancell charge .
.
- a [ gaff | amber ] : gaff is used by default .
option ' amber ' will use a set of parameters merged from the highly developed force fields amber99sb [ 2 ] for proteins and amber99bsc0 [ 25 ] for nucleic acids .
in case a parameter is not found for amber99sb , acpype will fall back to gaff definitions .
.
- c [ bcc | gas | user ] : the semi - empirical quantum chemistry programme sqm [ 26 ] is used by default ( via antechamber ) to determine the atomic partial charges .
option ' gas' will use the faster but less precise gasteiger method , option ' user ' will take partial charges as defined in a mol2 file , which can be calculated using more sophisticated methods like r.e.d .
[ 27,28 ] or the yasara autosmiles server [ 29 ] ( see additional file 1 ) .
after successful execution , acpype creates a folder that contains several files in different formats for the chosen md programmes ( see figure 1 ) .
it can also fully replace the topology file converter from amber to gromacs ( amb2gmx [ 30,31 ]) with some notable differences : . in gromacs , torsionals ( proper and improper ) are treated as ryckaert - bellemans potentials [ 32 ] and amb2gmx combines multiple amber torsions per quartet of atoms .
acpype in contrast separates improper from proper dihedrals , and , similarly to the ffamber project approach , uses the correct amber analytical function to treat proper dihedrals in gromacs ; . acpype does not depend on the ambpdb tool , which requires the amber proprietary package ; . acpype reads and converts octahedron ( inpcrd box ) parameters to the gromacs file .
if not available , new box parameters will be calculated .
it also recognises tip3p or spc / e water types and applies the correct parameters .
this feature requires only the python interpreter ( see figure 1 ) through the command : ' acpype - p _ prmtop _ - x _ inpcrd _' .
testing - acpype topologies versus amber force field since acpype relies on antechamber for generating topological parameters , it was possible to use a previously published validation procedure [ 17 ] .
we generated 22 pdb files with pymol [ 33 ] , each containing a tripeptide consisting of the same single natural amino , including protonation variants for his ( for more details , see additional file 2 ) .
gromacs 4.5 , which includes now ffamber , was then used to generate topology files for these tripeptides with the amber99sb force field as reference .
in all cases a single point gromacs energy minimisation step was performed .
testing - small molecules from the pdb acpype ( revision 275 with ambertools 1.3 ) was executed on 8950 chemical components ( ligands , small molecules and monomers ) available from the pdb [ 34 ] .
two sets of files , one with the coordinates from the original pdb deposition and one with the ' ideal ' corina coordinates [ 35,36 ] were written out in the mol2 format via the ccpnmr formatconverter [ 37 ] from the pdbe database [ 38,39 ] , totalling 17900 input files .
charges were calculated using sqm with am1 - bc. the 17900 acpype jobs , required a total execution time of just over 16 days on a computer using 20 amd opteron 2.3 ghz cores .
the cut off time of execution per job was 10 hours , any job taking longer than that was killed .
testing - nmr structure calculation we recalculated 5 protein - ligand nmr structures using the recoord protocol [ 40 ] .
a purpose - written python script that integrates the acpype api with the ccpn api was developed to run acpype on the ligand only to generate its gaff force field parameters .
these were incorporated into the standard protein topology files to calculate 200 initial structures by simulated annealing ( sa ) with cns ( topology and parameters from engh & huber [ 41 ] ) .
the 50 best of these structures were water refined ( wr ) using the oplsx force field , with acpype again providing the gaff parameters for the ligand only ( see discussion ) .
the 50 final structures were sorted by overall energy and the best 25 structures were validated through the icing [ 42 ] server , and then compared against the validation of the original nmr structures as provided by nrg - cing [ 43 ] .
double the number of default recoord timesteps were used during the sa and wr because of the size of the proteins and presence of ligand .
results we employed three tests to verify the correctness and applicability of the topologies generated by acpype ; to test its accuracy in transferring core data acpype was compared to ffamber , to test its robustness acpype was executed on a large set of small molecules from the pdb , and to test its usability acpype - generated ligand topologies were employed to recalculate protein - ligand structures from nmr data .
acpype topologies versus ffamber all atom types and parameters from gromacs' amber99sb output were identical to acpype with the amber99sb option , with the following minor differences : . for histidine ( all variants ) , arginine and tryptophan , acpype generated some inverted improper dihedrals ; . for tryptophan acpype incorporated 3 additional unnecessary ( but harmless ) improper dihedrals in the aromatic rings due to atom sharing ; . for the tyrosine cz atom acpype obtained atom type ca instead of c in gromacs .
this also results in parameter differences for 6 bonds and 9 dihedrals .
.
the partial atom charges parameters differ .
despite these changes , the difference in total bonded potential energy ( i.e. without the long distance terms that depends on charges ) for the 22 systems is very small between the ffamber and acpype sets ; the highest difference occurs for the tyrosine tripeptide and is 1.9 % ( 6.7 kj / mol ) .
this is because of the the aforementioned atom type change and its consequent parameter modifications for bonds and dihedrals .
for all other tripeptides , the difference is never higher than 0.002 % .
to further confirm that acpype gives consistent results , we used the validation methodology by eric sorin and collaborators for ffamber [ 44 ] and compared the results from the amber11 md engine ( programme sander ) to the results from gromacs with acpype topologies .
for all systems except tyrosine , using the same set of charges as defined in the amber99sb force field , the total potential energy differences were always inferior to 0.007 % .
tyrosine again was the outlier , but with a total potential energy difference < 3 % .
small molecules from the pdb this test on 8950 small molecules served to evaluate the robustness of acpype and debug the code .
the first step was to curate the initial set of 8950 small molecule entries ; since the information from the pdb is not always correct and the data went through a conversion process to generate the input files , entries with issues varying from total absence of input files to wrong atom coordinates were removed .
entries were also removed from further analysis if they did not adhere to a set of simple atom distance criteria ( a 0.5 a cut - off for minimum and a 3.0 a cut - off for maximum distance between covalently bound atoms ). from 17900 possible jobs ( 2 jobs for each pdb , one with original pdb coordinates and other with corina recalculated coordinates ) , 318 ( 1.78 %) did not have mol2 input files and could not be calculated , while 557 ( 3.11 %) had erroneous atom coordinates .
in total 13045 jobs ( 72.88 %) concluded without any remarkable problems with an average execution time of 14m35s .
excluding the jobs with incorrect data the acpype efficiency was 76.62 % ( 13045 of 17025 valid jobs ) .
for a detailed report , please see additional file 3 .
to further explore whether the generated coordinates were correct or acceptable , we selected only entries with results from acpype for both the pdb and corina coordinates .
the resulting 5772 entries ( 11544 jobs ) were subjected to 250 steps of energy minimisation via the conjugate gradient method using cns ( version 1.2 ) .
in total 1292 jobs failed the optimisation procedure because of mixed upper and lower case atom names , which cns does not support .
this occurred because antechamber converts upper - case names to capitalised names ( e.g. , bromine code ' br ' to ' br ') ; the issue was reported to antechamber developers and is remedied in acpype revision 285 .
for the remaining 10252 structures the all - atom rmsd between the initial and final structures was calculated ( figure 2 ) to illustrate the accuracy of the acpype results .

the average rmsd is shown by the bold vertical line .
nmr structure calculation to test how acpype works in a real nmr structure calculation setting , we used the data for 5 protein - ligand complexes from the pdb ( see table 1 ) that have nmr constraint data in ccpn format from the nmr restraints grid [ 43 ] .
the results of the structure calculation are similar ; overall the rmsd tends to increase for the recalculated structures , but the noe completeness and overall quality tends to increase ( table 1 ) .
these changes are expected due to differences in the structure calculation protocol , and are also observed in the recoord project [ 40 ] .
more importantly , this test shows that acpype allows the structure determination of protein - ligand complexes with autogenerated parameters and topologies ( for illustrative purposes , the structures for [ pdb : 1bve ] are shown in figure 3 , the other structures are available in additional file 4 ) .

discussion the idea of adapting antechamber or its routines to derive topologies and parameters for small molecules is not new .
we know of at least two cases : yasara autosmiles [ 29 ] is implemented for yasara [ 46 ] , but is restricted to this commercial software package ; the programme topolbuild is developed by bruce d. ray ( personal communication ) , and generates topologies and parameters from a mol2 file ( with known charges ) by using amber , gromos [ 47 ] or opls / aa [ 13 ] force fields in gromacs format .
it is limited to gromacs and not able to generate charges .
acpype has the advantage that it avoids these limitations .
moreover , acpype is written in python and makes the ( converted ) information from antechamber easily accessible for integration in other projects .
in the nmr community , it is already availabel via ccpn [ 48 ] , and it will be used in the upcoming rehash of the recoord structure recalculation project [ 40 ] , where complexes will be included in addition to monomers .
pilot integration with aria2 [ 49 ] , in order to make it work seamlessly via the ccpnmr grid portal [ 50 ] , was also tested .
in the md community , acpype is used in the drugdiscovery @ home project [ 51 ] , and it is employed by others ( for example , see [ 52 ]) .
we also intend to further verify acpype based on virtualchemistry.org [ 53 ] , a recent database of 145 organic molecules with some physical properties calculated and topologies for gaff [ 17 ] and opls / aa validated by using the gromacs software [ 54 ] .
since acpype is based on antechamber , it also inherits some of its core limitations : it is not possible to work with organic molecules with open valences ; it cannot handle atoms besides c , n , o , s , p , h , f , cl , br and i ; and there cannot be any covalent bonds to another ( non - defined ) molecule .
some of these restrictions can be circumvented : for example if one wants parameters for a modified amino acid residue , it is possible to neutralise the n - and c - termini and then fit the additional parameters manually to the modified residue .
the topological parameters generated by acpype are based on gaff or amber99sb and should be used only with compatible force fields such as amber and its variants ; when employing acpype to generate the ligand for a protein - ligand complex , the force field parameters for the protein should be from the amber family .
however , it is possible to use cns with topologies generated by acpype , even if this means mixing two different force fields ( engh & huber [ 41 ] and amber99sb / gaff ) .
this can be justified because during the sa steps of a structure calculation the values of all parameters are increased to much higher and fixed thresholds , and are so equalised for both protein and ligands .
essentially the topology information remains the same and all parameters are flattened ( the gaff or amber99sb parameters are overwritten by those from engh & huber ) , so the sa in cns can be performed without problems , as illustrated by the protein - ligand case studies presented here .
likewise , during wr steps , the protein is described by oplsx parameters ( which are close to the original opls parameters and do not introduce new atom types ) , with identical topology description and very similar parameters to those used in the amber force field family .
another point for consideration is the way improper dihedrals are defined in amber force fields .
they are a set of " proper " dihedrals that act only in planes , which may result in chirality inversions or peptide bond flips during the high - temperature portions of sa runs .
this problem is treated in amber md applications by adding chirality constraints and trans - peptide omegaconstraints ( where appropriate ) , but this solution is not easily extended to other md programmes .
however , since we use amber force fields only for small molecules , this is only a problem if the molecule has defined chiral centres .
where necessary it is possible to implement a routine to check the chiral centres every few steps using the cns macro language , or to implement an extra step where the improper dihedrals are introduced in the acpype generated topologies before the calculation .
although acpype will work automatically in many cases , it is not recommended to use it as a " black box " , and one should always explore the molecule under investigation as well as the force field ( s ) used for parameterisation .
during the development of acpype , some issues in ambertools ( with antechamber in particular ) were spotted , identified and reported back to their developers , sometimes with a proposed solution .
this procedure only enriched the quality of both programmes , and emphasises the strength of working with open - source projects .
moreover , in relation to gromacs , an open - source md application , acpype has great potential for usability and further development .
acpype is in constant development and has already a measurable community of users and contributors with ideas of extending it for other md and nmr - sc programmes .
conclusions acpype is an antechamber - based tool that fills the current gap in software to automatically incorporate small molecules in md and nmr - sc. it calculates partial charges and generates topology and parameters in different formats for different mm programmes , while being object oriented for integration with other applications .
it is a robust and flexible application , completely open source and freely available online for use by the scientific community .

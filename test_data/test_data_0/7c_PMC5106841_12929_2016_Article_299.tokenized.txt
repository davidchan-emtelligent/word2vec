the goal of precision medicine is to separate patient populations into groups to ultimately provide customized care tailored to patients .
in terms of precision medicine , ~ 540 million people in the world have a genetic variant of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ( aldh2 ) enzyme causing a flushing response and tachycardia after alcohol consumption .
the genetic variant is identified as aldh2 * 2 and originates from east asian descendants of the han chinese .
the variant is particularly important to consider when discussing lifestyle choices with patients in terms of risk for developing specific diseases , preventative screening , and selection of medications for treatment .
here we provide examples why patients with an aldh2 * 2 variant need more individualized medical management which is becoming a more standard practice in the precision medicine era .

this initiative describes precision medicine as " an emerging approach for disease prevention and treatment taking into account people 's individual variations in genes , environment , and lifestyle " with the ultimate goal of implementing these concepts into clinical practice [ 1 ] .
some examples of precision medicine already exist in medical practice .
for example in pediatrics , a genetic panel is typically used when a child is born , known as a newborn screen , which in california tests for 57 different conditions .
if one of these genetic conditions is identified from the screen , individualized and rather specific care is provided which can prevent serious health problems .
another example is recommendations for disease surveillance based upon single gene variants which increase the risk for colon cancer as seen in individuals with lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis .
these patients have established personalized guidelines relevant to the frequency of medical surveillance for colon cancer by colonoscopy which differs from colon cancer screening measures recommended to the general population [ 2 ] .
physicians are now also considering the influence of genetic variants on drugs they prescribe when treating specific conditions .
for example , a variant in p450 cyp2c19 reduces the amount of the active form of clopidogrel ( a drug given when treating atrial fibrillation ) .
this is concerning since a subset of people with atrial fibrillation and the cyp2c19 variant may not achieve a therapeutic level of clopidogrel if prescribed the medication .
recently , physicians have started implementing screening for the cyp2c19 variant as part of the medical decision making process when determining which drug to prescribe for atrial fibrillation [ 3 ] .
similar to the examples above , here we describe a genetic variant which when factored in with environment and lifestyle choices will influence medical management , preventative medicine , and drug treatment choices .
this genetic variant of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ( aldh2 ) enzyme is present in ~ 8 % of the world 's population .
here , we also briefly outline the initial steps for implementing precision medicine in the clinic for patients with this variant .
main text approximately 540 million people have a genetic variant of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ( aldh2 ) enzyme which causes a flushing response and tachycardia after alcohol consumption ( fig. 1 ) .
the genetic variant , identified as aldh2 * 2 , is almost exclusively present in east asian descendants of han chinese and is particularly important when considering risk factors for disease , decisions in medical treatment , and drug selection .
recently , extensive reviews have covered the molecular biology and importance of the aldh2 * 2 variant in human health [ 4 , 5 ] .
here , we concisely discuss 2 examples of how the aldh2 * 2 variant factors into decisions regarding medical management and drug selection .
we believe these two examples should be used as a foundation for developing a more defined precision medicine platform for those with an aldh2 * 2 variant. fig. 1 the genetic variant aldh2 * 2 .
the aldh2 * 2 variant is present in 540 million people in the world mainly of han chinese descent .
the variant is identifiable by the phenotypic response of facial flushing after alcohol consumption .
people heterozygotic for the genetic variant ( aldh2 * 1 * 2 ) have at least a 60 % decrease in enzymatic activity while those homozygotic ( aldh2 * 2 * 2 ) have greater than a 95 % decrease in enzymatic activity developing precision medicine for aldh2 * 2 in relation to cancer risk undoubtedly , lifestyle choices contribute to the risk of developing cancer .
in particular , alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking are two lifestyle choices which increase the risk for esophageal cancer .
cigarettes contain several reactive aldehydes ( such as acrolein , formaldehyde and acetaldehyde ) which are known carcinogens [ 6 ] .
the acetaldehyde produced from breaking down alcohol also is metabolized to acetaldehyde by the aldh2 enzyme .
in comparison to the united states , countries in asia have a higher incidence of esophageal cancer [ 7 ] .
reactive aldehyde carcinogens are less efficiently metabolized by those with an aldh2 * 2 variant. with this in mind , people with an aldh2 * 2 variant are at a much greater risk for esophageal cancer .
a strong association between alcohol consumption and increased esophageal cancer risk in the aldh2 * 2 population has been established [ 8 , 9 ] .
alarmingly , people with an aldh2 * 2 variant and also an alcohol dehydrogenase variant ( adh1b , that causes a rapid conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde ) with a history of drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes , have an odds ratio of 189 for developing esophageal cancer ( fig. 2 ) [ 10 ]. fig. 2 the influence of genetics and lifestyle choices on esophageal cancer risk .
people with the aldh2 * 2 variant who consume alcohol and are also fast metabolizers of alcohol by having the adh1b variant have an increased risk for developing esophageal cancer .
if the person also smokes cigarettes , the risk of developing esophageal cancer is potentially 189 times higher taking this risk into consideration , similar to published outlined measures for gastrointestinal cancers with reference to specific genetic variants [ 2 ] , increased consideration should be given to developing screening measures for esophageal cancer in the aldh2 * 2 population .
this could potentially reduce the incidence of esophageal cancer within the east asian population .
further , screening for the aldh2 * 2 gene could be used as topic of conversation with patients as a preventative measure to reduce esophageal cancer risk .
these discussions could include how the aldh2 * 2 variant in combination with lifestyle choices such as drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes increases the relative risk of developing esophageal cancer .
together , effectively communicating these lifestyle risks can be a powerful means to reduce esophageal cancer incidence .
integrating the aldh2 * 2 variant into medical decisions when prescribing drugs besides the importance for aldh2 in metabolizing acetaldehyde ( the breakdown product of alcohol ) , aldh2 is also an important enzyme in drug metabolism .
the efficacy of several drugs are impacted by the aldh2 * 2 variant [ 4 ] .
specifically , aldh2 metabolizes nitroglycerin to nitric oxide in order to cause blood vessel dilation .
importantly , those with an aldh2 * 2 variant are less efficient at breaking down nitroglycerin to nitric oxide , effectively limiting the vasodilatory effect of nitroglycerin .
the catalytic activity to metabolize nitroglycerin is 10 - fold less for the aldh2 * 2 enzyme compared to the aldh2 * 1 enzyme [ 11 ] .
studies in east asians , measuring forearm blood flow response to nitroglycerin show that aldh2 * 2 variants have a 40 % reduced response compared to those without a * 2 variant as measured by vasodilation ( fig. 3 ) [ 12 ]. fig. 3 reduced metabolism of nitroglycerin to nitric oxide .
the esterase activity for the aldh2 enzyme is required to convert nitroglycerin to nitric oxide .
those with the aldh2 * 2 variant also have a reduction in esterase activity , which in turn causes nitroglycerin to be less efficiently metabolized to nitric oxide .
approximately 40 % more nitroglycerin may need to be given to people with the aldh2 * 2 variant to achieve the same effect as those with the aldh2 * 1 enzyme importantly , the influence of aldh2 * 2 on nitroglycerin metabolism may impact medical decision making in several medical disciplines including anesthesiology , obstetrics , cardiology , internal medicine , and emergency medicine .
nitroglycerin is commonly given after cardiac bypass for a heart valve replacement or coronary artery bypass grafting .
nitroglycerin is also used in obstetrics to relax the uterus .
in cardiology and emergency medicine , nitroglycerin is frequently given to relieve chest pain associated with myocardial ischemia .
many of these nitroglycerin applications in medical practice may need to consider potential aldh2 * 2 variant effects on nitroglycerin efficacy. with knowledge of this genetic information , clinicians can consider either increasing the nitroglycerin dose given or choosing another vasodilator which is not metabolized by the aldh2 enzyme , such as nitroprusside .
conclusions with a focus on precision medicine and the high prevalence of the aldh2 * 2 variant within the east asian population , clinicians should consider whether a patient has this variant which increases the risk for specific diseases such as esophageal cancer and limits the metabolism of specific drugs such as nitroglycerin .
one option to consider is more frequent screening for esophageal cancer for those with both the aldh2 * 2 variant and a history of smoking cigarettes and / or consuming alcohol .
when the potential influence of the aldh2 * 2 variant is taken into consideration , relative to disease risk and drug metabolism , patients with the aldh2 * 2 variant can begin receiving personalized medical management which will become standard practice in the precision medicine era .

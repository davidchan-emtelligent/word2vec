congenital tufting enteropathy ( cte ) is a life - threatening hereditary disease that is characterized by enteric mucosa tufting degeneration and early onset , severe diarrhea .
loss - of - function mutations of the human epcam gene ( trop1 , tacstd1 ) have been indicated as the cause of cte .
however , loss of mtrop1 / epcam in mice appeared to lead to death in utero , due to placental malformation .
this and indications of residual trop - 1 / epcam expression in cases of cte cast doubt on the role of mtrop1 / epcam in this disease .
the aim of this study was to determine the role of trop1 / epcam in cte and to generate an animal model of this disease for molecular investigation and therapy development .
using a rigorous gene - trapping approach , we obtained mtrop1 / epcam - null ( knockout ) mice .
these were born alive , but failed to thrive , and died soon after birth because of hemorrhagic diarrhea .
the intestine from the mtrop1 / epcam knockout mice showed intestinal tufts , villous atrophy and colon crypt hyperplasia , as in human cte .
no structural defects were detected in other organs .
these results are consistent with trop1 / epcam loss being the cause of cte , thus providing a viable animal model for this disease , and a benchmark for its pathogenetic course .
in the affected enteric mucosa , e - cadherin and beta - catenin were shown to be dysregulated , leading to disorganized transition from crypts to villi , with progressive loss of membrane localization and increasing intracellular accumulation , thus unraveling an essential role for trop - 1 / epcam in the maintenance of intestinal architecture and functionality .

introduction epcam , also known as trop - 1 , from the trophoblast cells in which it was originally defined [ 1 ] , is a transmembrane glycoprotein [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] that shares unique structural features with its paralog trop - 2 [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
both trop - 1 and trop - 2 regulate cell - cell adhesion [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] and cell growth [ 4 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
trop - 1 is expressed by embryonic stem ( es ) cells , where it contributes to the maintenance of pluripotency [ 11 ] .
in the developing embryo , trop - 1 expression is detected in oral and nasal cavities , ear , eye , respiratory tract , gut mucosa , kidney , liver , pancreas , skin , gonads , and placental trophoblast [ 1 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
trop - 1 expression in tissue primordia is developmentally regulated and it was proposed to have a morphoregulatory role [ 14 ] .
in the adult organism , trop - 1 is a marker of adult epithelial and hematopoietic progenitors , and of proliferating epithelia [ 4 ] , [ 12 ] .
inactivating germ - line mutations of the human epcam / trop1 / tacstd1 gene [ 15 ] have been associated with congenital tufting enteropathy ( cte ) [ 16 ] , a life - threatening intestinal dysplasia that manifests from birth .
cte is characterized by gross lesions in the intestinal epithelium , with villous atrophy , crypt hyperplasia and focal crowding of enterocytes ( tufts ) [ 17 ] .
affected individuals show abnormal expression of alpha2beta1 integrin , desmoglein , laminin and heparan sulfate proteoglycan , and ultrastructural changes to cell desmosomes in the intestinal epithelium [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , which indicate the loss of epithelial barrier function .
several trop1 homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations have been described in cte to date , i.e. , base substitutions in the donor or acceptor splice sites of exon 4 , with in - frame exon skipping , and nonsense mutations or base insertions in exons 3 , 5 and 6 , which lead to premature truncation of the protein in the extracellular domain [ 16 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
cte - associated mutations have been linked to either decreased or absent trop - 1 expression [ 16 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
loss - of - function animal models have been used to tackle the in - vivo role of trop - 1 .
in zebrafish embryos , trop1 inactivation via retroviral insertion or somatic knockdown by antisense oligonucleotides showed that trop - 1 is required for epithelial morphogenesis and integrity , for otolith formation in the inner ear [ 24 ] , and for lateral line formation by specialized cells that differentiate from migrating primordia [ 25 ] .
it should be noted that in zebrafish there is only one tacstd - like gene [ 25 ] , thus preventing compensatory effects / functional substitution by the trop2 paralog .
recently , a role for the murine epcam / mtrop - 1 protein in intercellular adhesion and cell motility and migration was shown in a mouse conditional knockout ( ko ) with epcam / mtrop1 - specific inactivation in epithelial langerhans cells [ 26 ] .
on the other hand , constitutive mtrop1 ablation [ 13 ] has been suggested to lead to embryonic lethality by day of gestation ( e ) 12.5 , due to placental defects .
this cast doubt on trop1 mutations as a single - gene - inactivation cause of cte , potentially implicating other , nearby gene defects as obligate and / or modulatory determinants for disease appearance .
however , mtrop1 ko validation in this murine model was performed through surrogate markers ( beta - galactosidase - neomycin phosphotransferase fusion ( betageo ) genotyping and beta - galactosidase ( beta - gal ) expression / activity ) [ 13 ] , thus preventing the identification of possible off - target effects by the gene - trapping procedure .
hence , we used rigorous gene - replacement and gene - trapping approaches , and obtained a gene - trapped ko mouse that was devoid of a functional mtrop - 1 protein .
the mtrop1 - null embryos showed no in - utero morphological defects , and were born alive .
on the other hand , mtrop1 - null pups showed rapidly progressing intestinal epithelium dysplasia , with focal cell crowding and tufting , which closely paralleled that seen in cte .
this led to severe hemorragic enteropathy , which caused impaired development and death within a few days from birth .
no structural defects were seen in other organs .
taken together , our findings are consistent with trop - 1 loss being a single - gene cause of cte .
molecular analysis of the affected epithelia showed disruption of cryptae - to - villi transition and progressive intracellular accumulation of the adherens - junction organizer e - cadherin and its interactor beta - catenin , revealing a direct role of trop - 1 in the maintenance of intestinal architecture and functionality , through regulation of e - cadherin / beta - catenin expression and cellular localization .

the exon numbering in mouse and man differs , as an additional 5 ' - untranslated exon has been described in the mouse ( nm _ 008532.2 ) , for a total of 10 exons , versus 9 in man , e.g. , human exon 4 corresponds to murine exon 5 .
plasmids the pgt1tmpfs vector was used to generate gene - trapped clones from es cells [ 39 ] .
it contains 1721 bp of the mouse engrailed 2 ( en2 ) intronic sequence that ends with a splice - acceptor ag dinucleotide upstream of a promoterless beta - geo open reading frame ( orf ) in each of the three reading frames .
upon insertion of this cassette within an intron the beta - geo orf is spliced to the preceding exon , leading to a chimeric translated product .

results and discussion mtrop1 ko mice are born alive and develop cte we used both gene - replacement and gene - trapping approaches , and corresponding validation procedures , to obtain a ko mouse devoid of functional mtrop1 .
for inactivation of mtrop1 through gene replacement , we used homology - guided recombination in mouse es cells ( text s1 ; figs. s1 , s2 ) .
we succeeded in obtaining es cells with one inactivated mtrop1 allele .
however , these failed to colonize blastocysts efficiently , and no chimeric mice were obtained ( text s1 ) .
hence , we resorted to a gene - trapping approach .
two gene - trapped es clones were identified , i.e. , rst412 and rst413 , where mtrop1 was demonstrated to be inactivated by insertion of a promoterless betageo cassette ( fig. 1a , c ; text s1 ) , with 5 ' rapid amplification of cdna ends ( race ) used for sequence validation .
both clones were used for blastocyst injection .
three and seven chimeric mice were obtained from clones rst412 and rst413 , respectively ( fig. s3 ) .
all male chimeras ( 3 and 6 individuals , respectively ) were bred to a c57bl / 6 ( b6 ) genetic background , to obtain first filial ( f1 ) generation heterozygous ( het ) mice bearing one null mtrop1 allele ( fig. s3 ) .
gene - specific genotyping was used throughout breeding to assess the mtrop1 status of all of the littermates .
genomic and transcriptomic characterization of rst412 f1 mice showed mtrop1 - specific insertion of the gene - trapping betageo cassette and intestinal expression of the mtrop1 - betageo fusion transcript ( fig. 1b , c ; fig. s3b ; text s1 ) .
these het mice were viable and fertile .
rst413 f1 mice showed the betageo marker , but no retention of the trapped mtrop1 ( fig. s3b , c ) , possibly because of in - vivo genomic recombination [ 27 ] , and these were not studied any further .

( a ) mtrop1 gene inactivation scheme for the rst412 and rst413 es clones .
the inactivating exonic cassette within the pgt1tmpf gene - trap vector ( top ) contains an atg - less orf of beta - galactosidase fused to neomycin phosphotransferase ( beta - geo , cyan ) , followed by an internal ribosome entry site ( black ) for placental alkaline phosphatase ( plap ) orf ( red ) ; simian virus 40 transcription termination / polyadenylation signal ( svpa , gray ) ; an intronic sequence from engrailed2 ( en2 ) ( red line ) provides a strong splicing acceptor site ( red arrowhead ) .
the insertion brings the promoterless bicistronic beta - geo - plap - svpa cassette in the third intron of wt mtrop1 ( middle ) .
cassette insertion leads to a null ( ko ) mtrop1 , by leading to the splicing of the mtrop1 exon 3 to the beta - geo cassette ( bottom ) .

( c ) the fusion transcript from the ko allele ( top ) is expressed in the intestine of het mice , as revealed by rna reverse transcription ( rt ) - pcr ( bottom , left ) and sequencing ( bottom , right ) , with in - frame fusion between mtrop1 and beta - geo .
to investigate embryonic development defects brought about by mtrop1 ablation , we set up timed matings between het mice from the rst412 colony , and we analyzed the litters in utero at embryonic day ( e ) 9.5 - 10.5 .
homozygous gene - trapped ko embryos were indistinguishable from their wild - type ( wt ) and het siblings in size , developmental stage , body symmetry and somite architecture .
the embryo resorption rate was within the physiological range of healthy mouse colonies [ 28 ] .
immunofluorescence analyses with the anti - mtrop - 1 g8.8 monoclonal antibody ( mab ) demonstrated that mtrop - 1 was absent in ko embryos ( fig. 2 ) , thus confirming ablation of the protein in our mouse model .
in wt and het embryos , mtrop - 1 expression was detected in the intestine , pharingeal cleft , nose placode , limb buds and other body - lining epithelia ( figs. s4 , s5 ) .
strong mtrop - 1 staining in the nearby maternal uterine tissue ( fig. 2 ; fig. s4d ) provided a stringent internal control for all of the staining procedures .

target tissue architecture and morphology in the het embryos were normal .
no gross differences were detected between het and ko embryos .
scale bars : 100 microm .
these findings indicated a different pathogenetic course from that described by nagao et al .
[ 13 ] .
therefore , we analyzed litters from het crossings at birth by mtrop1 - specific genotyping .
mtrop1 - null newborn pups were found in essentially every litter analyzed ( fig. 1b ; table s2 ) , at a frequency which was close to the 1:2:1 ratio expected for monogenic mendelian inheritance ( 0.265 versus the expected 0.250 ; chi2 = 1.59 ; rejection threshold > 5.99 ) .
these results demonstrated absence of negative selection in utero against the ko embryos .
consistently , ko pups at birth ( day 0 ) appeared indistinguishable from their wt and het littermates in size , morphology and behavior ( fig. 3a ) .
however ko pups were no longer in the litter at weaning ( 4 weeks after birth ) ( table s2 ) , which suggested a negative effect of mtrop1 inactivation early after birth .
hence , we went back to analysis of litters from birth .
ko newborns were unable to gain weight ( fig. 3c ) and appeared smaller than their siblings already at day 2 ( fig. 3a ) .
this difference became even more apparent over the following 2 days ( fig. 3a ) , until death occurred , with 100 % penetrance , by day 4 ( fig. 3b ) .
no growth defects were observed in het newborns , and their size , growth rate and post - natal survival were undistinguishable from wt pups ( fig. 3 ) .

inset : a ko mouse at day 3 versus a het littermate .
serial analysis of gene expression ( sage ) analyses and microarray hybridization profiles of embryonic tissues showed that mtrop1 expression is highest in the intestinal epithelium ( fig. s6 ) .
consistent with this , we found that mtrop - 1 expression in the newborn intestine is high throughout the intestinal mucosa epithelial layer ( see below ) .
taken together , these findings indicated that the intestine would be a primary target for defects linked to mtrop1 ablation .
indeed , systematic macroscopic analyses showed that the intestine of 3 - day old ko pups was smaller than the wt ( fig. s7 ) , while other organs did not show macroscopic morphological defects .
histopathology analyses of the intestine showed villous atrophy of increasing severity , from minimal abnormalies at birth to essential loss of normal mucosal architecture by day 4 ( fig. 4 ; fig. s7 ) .
signs of hemorrhagic enteritis were evident from day 0 ( fig. 4 ) .
surface enterocyte disorganization and crowding were focally distributed along the small intestine .
epithelial tufts increased over time , with the largest numbers in ko mice at day 4 .
these tufts were also observed in the colon , consistent with the histopathology of human cte .
colon crypts showed aberrant pseudo - cyst aspects and highly proliferative enterocytes ( fig. 4 ; fig. s7 ) .
no microscopic abnormalities were apparent in other organs ( fig. s8 ) .
in particular , no abnormalities were detected in the esophagous and stomach , which express little if any trop - 1 under normal conditions ([ 4 ] ; fig. s6 ) .
immunofluorescence analysis showed no mtrop - 1 in the intestine of newborn ko mice , confirming full inactivation of the gene ( fig. 5 ) .
on the other hand , the gene - trapping beta - gal marker was only detected in ko ( fig. 5 ) and het mice , as from the gene inactivation strategy .

expression of the beta - gal marker from the mtrop1 gene - trapped allele was analyzed by immunohistochemistry with anti - beta - gal antibodies in sections of formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded intestine .
in wt tissues , a strong expression of mtrop - 1 was observed , largely in the basolateral compartment of intestinal epithelial cells lining the villi .
no beta - gal staining was observed , as expected .
in ko mice , mtrop - 1 was completely absent ( lack of green signal ) , while the positive staining for beta - gal ( brown deposits ) confirmed the presence and specific expression of the gene - trapping cassette .
the villi of the ko intestine showed tufting and crowding of epithelial cells ( arrowheads ) .
scale bars : 40 microm .
taken together , these findings show that mtrop1 loss is a single - gene cause of cte , which leads to severe structural alterations in the intestinal mucosa , with loss of epithelial architecture and barrier function [ 18 ] , [ 19 ]. of relevance , decreased expression of trop - 1 was first suggested to lead to cte in human subjects [ 16 ] , [ 22 ] , while complete absence of expression of trop - 1 was revealed in additional cases [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
however , a less severe form of cte associates with specific mutations of the trop1 gene , e.g. , c.498insc [ 20 ] , which possibly reflects a residual activity / expression of trop - 1 , as for cases with trop1 exon 4 skipping [ 16 ] .
mtrop1 loss disrupts intestinal e - cadherin / beta - catenin expression and localization trop - 1 ablation in zebrafish embryos was shown to cause a decrease in membrane - bound e - cadherin [ 24 ] .
e - cadherin and its interactor beta - catenin are essential components for adherens junction assembly .
adherens junctions mediate cell - cell contact in epithelia and modulate the actin cytoskeleton , to preserve cell structure and polarity , and ultimately epithelium integrity .
e - cadherin ablation from adult mouse intestine has indeed been shown to destroy epithelial architecture , causing hemorrhagic diarrhea [ 29 ] .
consistent with this , intestine - specific e - cadherin ablation in the mouse embryo caused perinatal death with severe disruption of intestinal morphogenesis [ 30 ] .
therefore we investigated whether intestinal epithelium disruption in cte mice was linked to alterations of e - cadherin / beta - catenin .
immunohistochemistry analyses of intestine from day 0 to day 4 after birth showed that e - cadherin localized in the basolateral membrane compartment of wt epithelial cells ( fig. 6a , c , e ) .
here e - cadherin showed the highest expression levels in the intervillar epithelium and developing crypts , which are the sites of the most active cell proliferation .
e - cadherin expression along the villi was weak at birth , and markedly increased at cell - cell junctions in the following days ( fig. 6a , c , e ) .
e - cadherin / beta - catenin complexes continuously recyle between the plasma membrane and perinuclear endocytic internal compartments [ 31 ] .
this dynamic process is essential for preserving the integrity of epithelia during morphogenetic movements [ 31 ] .
in the ko mice , epithelial e - cadherin expression was altered from birth , with marked expression in villar epithelium ( fig. 6b , d , f ) .
this was accompanied by cytoplasmic localization , probably because of retention in the endoplasmic reticulum or in other membranous re - cycling compartments [ 31 ] .
e - cadherin polarization was then progressively lost , with a disorganized transition between intervillar regions and villar epithelium .
intracellular e - cadherin accumulation was then shown to rapidly increase from day 0 until the time of death ( fig. 6b , d , f ) .

e - cadherin immunostaining pattern in small bowel of wt ( wt ) and ko mice at birth ( day 0 ) , and at day 1 and day 4 after birth .
e - cadherin shows a typical membrane immunoreactivity in wt mice ( a , c , e ) , whereas in ko mice ( b , d , f ) it is localized increasingly in the cytoplasm , with a prevalent cytoplasmic accumulation and membrane - disrupted pattern at day 4 after birth .
( scale bar : 20 mm ) .
parallel immunohistochemistry analyses were performed for beta - catenin ( fig. 7 ) .
in wt intestinal epithelial cells , beta - catenin expression was also localized to the basolateral membrane compartment and showed marked polarization ( fig. 7a , c , e ) .
this showed a shift from birth , where it was strongest in the intervillar region , to day 4 , where it reached the highest levels in the villous epithelium .
in the ko epithelium , both intervillar and villous epithelia showed strong beta - catenin membrane staining at day 0 , together with anomalous perinuclear intracellular deposits ( fig. 7b , d , f ) , which are associated with disruption of signaling along the canonical wnt / beta - catenin pathway [ 32 ] .
beta - catenin intracellular accumulation might also associate with trop - 1 - dependent aberrant nuclear translocation [ 33 ] .
consistent with this , intracellular deposits were predominant from day 1 to day 4 after birth , leading to almost complete loss of membrane staining at the time of death ( fig. 7f ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0049302.g007 figure 7 beta - catenin expression in the intestine .
beta - catenin immunostaining pattern in small bowel of wt and ko mice at birth ( day 0 ) , and at day 1 and day 4 after birth .
membrane pattern is typically seen in wt mice ( a , c , e ) .
a progressive cytoplasmic immunoreactivity , with concomitant diffuse and " dot - like " perinuclear patterns , and disruption of the membrane immunoreactivity for beta - catenin is seen in ko mice ( b , d , f ) starting from day 1 after birth. ( scale bar : 20 mm ) .
in vitro studies have shown that trop - 1 can abrogate e - cadherin - mediated cell - cell interactions by disrupting the link between alpha - catenin and f - actin [ 34 ] .
ectopic expression of trop - 1 in cadherin - positive cells leads to the abrogation of adherens junctions and to an increase of trop - 1 - mediated intercellular junctions [ 7 ] .
in the trop1 - ko zebrafish embryo , e - cadherin restoration does not alleviate the epithelial defects , which indicates that trop - 1 regulation of e - cadherin trafficking is likely to act through additional trop - 1 target ( s ) rather than a direct interaction with e - cadherin [ 24 ] .
in human multipotential hematopoietic cells , trop - 1 is associated with a cytoplasmic complex that is enriched in actin - binding proteins such as afadin , alpha - actinin , ezrin and vinculin .
among these , ezrin can interact directly with e - cadherin / beta - catenin [ 35 ] and regulate e - cadherin membrane trafficking and adherens junction formation [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] , which suggests that ezrin has a role in mediating trop - 1 regulation of e - cadherin / beta - catenin dynamics .
conclusions our results are consistent with trop - 1 loss being a single - gene cause of cte .
the mtrop1 ko mouse thus provides a much needed animal model for understanding the pathogenesis of intestinal alterations in cte and as a benchmark for developing novel therapeutic approaches .
our findings also unravel an essential role for trop - 1 in the maintenance of intestinal architecture and functionality , through regulation of e - cadherin / beta - catenin expression and cellular localization .

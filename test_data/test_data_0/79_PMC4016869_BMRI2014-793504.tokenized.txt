tw01003 , a piperazinedione derivative designed as an antimitotic agent , exhibited potent anticancer and antiangiogenesis activities in mice .
however , oral administration of this compound in rats led to poor systemic bioavailability which suggested that in vivo efficacy might come from its metabolites .
this report describes the identification of tw01003 metabolites in pig and wistar rats .
following intravenous administration of tw01003 , pig urine samples were subjected to sulfatase and glucuronidase treatment to monitor the biotransformation products .
rats were given tw01003 both intravenously and orally , and blood samples were collected and then analyzed by hplc to quantitatively determine the metabolic transformation of tw01003 to its metabolite .
a sulfate conjugate , tw01003 sulfate , was identified as the major metabolite for tw01003 after intravenous injection in both pig and rats .
however , in rats , the glucuronide conjugate became major metabolite 30 min after tw01003 oral dosing .
pharmacokinetic analysis after intravenous administration of tw01003 indicated that tw01003 sulfate had a systemic bioavailability 2.5 times higher , volume of distribution three times higher , residence time seven times longer , and clearance rate 2.3 times lower compared to tw01003 .
our results indicate that the potent anticancer and antiangiogenesis activities of tw01003 might not come from tw01003 per se but from its metabolites tw01003 sulfate .

introduction tubulin binding agents , which result in mitotic arrest of tumor cell and then apoptosis , are now standard treatment in cancer chemotherapy [ 1 - 4 ] .
( 3e,6e ) - 3 - benzylidene - 6 - [( 5 - hydroxypyridin - 2 - yl ) methylene ] piperazine - 2,5 - dione ( tw01003 ) ( figure 1 ) , a piperazinedione derivative synthesized in this laboratory as an antimitotic agent , exhibited a broad spectrum of antitumor activities in 60 human disease - oriented cancer cell panel screenings [ 5 - 7 ] .
a profound antiangiogenesis effect of this compound was demonstrated in mice ; after oral treatment of tw01003 ( 3 mg / kg ) , the hemoglobin count of the matrigel with vascular endothelial growth factor - ( vegf - ) induced angiogenesis was reduced to < 1 % ( unpublished data ) .
however , a preliminary pharmacokinetic study indicated poor bioavailability upon oral administration of this compound to rats , with only 1.72 % of the oral fraction absorbed ( unpublished data ) .
this led to a suspicion that the potent antiangiogenesis effect of tw01003 might come from its metabolites .
in this report , we describe the identification of the metabolites of tw01003 in pig following intravenous ( i.v. ) administration .
we also investigated the metabolic profiles of tw01003 in rats following i.v. and oral administration .
the transformation of tw01003 to its major metabolite was determined by pharmacokinetic studies in rats .

the phase ii conjugate tw01003 sulfate was first isolated from pig urine as an authentic sample for analysis .
male wistar rats ( 200 - 250 g ) for pharmacokinetic studies were purchased from the laboratory animal center of national taiwan university ( taipei , taiwan ) .
the animals were pathogen free and allowed to acclimate to the environmentally controlled quarters ( 24 +/ - 1degreesc and 12 : 12 h light - dark cycle ) for at least 5 days before the experiments .
animal studies were conducted in accordance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals [ 8 ] .
2.2 .
analytical sample preparation d (+) - glucose - monohydrate ( d5w ) solution ( 5 %) was prepared by mixing 25 g of d5w with double deionized water , filtered through a 0.22 mum millipore filter , and adjusted to 500 ml. vehicle v was prepared by mixing 5 % d5w , cremophor el , and ethyl alcohol in the ratio of 90 : 5 : 5 ( v / v / v ) .

2.3 .
chromatography and validation of assay methods tw01003 test solutions were analyzed by hplc .
the hplc system consisted of an autosampler ( as950 , jasco , tokyo , japan ) , a waters model 600e solvent delivery pump ( millipore , milford , ma , usa ) coupled with an ultraviolet detector monitored at wavelength 350 nm ( bioanalytical systems , inc. , west lafayette , in , usa ) , and an integrator ( macintosh lc ii computer with macintegrator i , rainin ; apple , new york , ny , usa ) .
the samples were eluted in a c18 reversed - phase microbore column ( particle size 5 mum , 150 x 1 mm ; bioanalytical systems ) at a flow rate of 1 ml / min .
the eluent was filtered through a millipore filter ( 0.22 mum ) and degassed prior to analysis .

assay methods were validated by determining the precision and accuracy of intra - and interday analyses of serum standards over a period of 6 days .
the lower limit of quantification ( loq ) between intraday assays of tw01003 was 7.46 +/ - 0.67 ng / ml ( n = 3 , r 2 = 0.9995 ) , with coefficients of variation less than 9 % .
the lower loq between interday assays was 7.17 +/ - 0.54 ng / ml ( n = 3 , r 2 = 0.9999 ) with coefficients of variation less than 15 % .
2.4 .
animal experiments single - dose tw01003 in a solution ( 1 ml ) containing a 9 : 1 ( v / v ) ratio of vehicle v : 10 % na2co3 ( aq ) was used for animal studies in pig or in male wistar rats [ 9 ] .
for metabolic studies , the tw01003 test solution was administered intravenously ( 7 mg / kg , n = 1 ) to the tail vein or orally ( 36 mg / kg , n = 1 ) by a feeding tube .
for pharmacokinetic studies , the test solution was administered intravenously to the tail vein of wistar rats ( 2.0 mg / kg , 1 ml , n = 6 ) .
the rats were put under a heating lamp to maintain body temperatures at 37degreesc throughout the experiment .
all procedures involving the use of animals were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of taipei medical university .
blood samples ( 0.5 ml ) were withdrawn from the carotid artery of rats at time intervals of 5 , 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , and 240 min .
heparin sodium ( 25 iu / ml in 0.3 ml of saline ) was added , and the blood samples were centrifuged ( 5,585 g ) at 4degreesc for 8 min .
the plasma was frozen immediately and kept at - 78degreesc until analysis .

3. results 3.1 .
chromatographic identification of tw01003 and tw01003 sulfate in order to establish a feasible analytical method for the identification of tw01003 metabolites in a biological system , a test solution containing 200 mg of tw01003 was first injected into a 40 - 50 kg pig .
fresh urine ( 1 ml ) was collected 60 min after dosing , filtered through a 0.22 mum millipore filter , and subjected to hplc analysis .
typical hplc chromatograms of urine sample of untreated pig ( figure 2 ( a )) , urine samples upon i.v. dosing of tw01003 ( figure 2 ( b )) , and urine samples after sulfatase treatment ( figure 2 ( c )) are depicted .
3.2 .
metabolic study of tw01003 in rats metabolic studies of tw01003 were conducted using male wistar rats .
the preliminary data were studies in one rat .
in this experiment , we had established plasma concentration - time curves of parent tw01003 and its major metabolites after i.v. ( 6.7 mg / kg , n = 1 , figure 3 ) or oral administration ( 36.0 mg / kg , n = 1 , figure 4 ) of tw01003 .
plasma samples were collected and subjected to enzymatic treatment by sulfatase or glucuronidase for the identification of tw01003 sulfate and glucuronide as phase ii metabolic conjugates .
the results indicated that tw01003 was cleared fairly rapidly , regardless of administration method .
as sulfonation and glucuronidation are the most common phase ii metabolic pathways for compounds containing an aromatic hydroxyl group , we first identified the metabolites in rat urine .
urine samples were subjected to sulfatase or glucuronidase treatment prior to hplc analysis .
the method used for analyze tw01003 was also used to identify tw01003 sulfate or glucuronidase conjugate .
3.3 .
pharmacokinetics upon i.v. administration of tw01003 in rats plasma samples were subjected to sulfatase treatment for the identification of tw01003 sulfate conjugate as a metabolite .
the plasma concentration - time profile of tw01003 and tw01003 sulfate after i.v. administration of tw01003 is depicted in figure 5 ( n = 6 ) .
pharmacokinetic ( pk ) parameters of tw01003 and tw01003 sulfate are summarized in table 1 .
4. discussion this study investigated the biotransformation of tw01003 in rats and in pig .
as depicted in figure 2 ( b ) , we observed a fast clearance upon administration of tw01003 in pig .
after 60 min of tw01003 dosing , tw01003 sulfate ( retention time 16.59 min ) was identified as the major metabolite .
upon sulfatase treatment , this phase ii conjugate was hydrolyzed to tw01003 ( figure 2 ( c )) , confirming that the peak of retention time 16.59 min is tw01003 sulfate conjugate .
we had also purified the tw01003 sulfate from pig urine , which showed the same retention time in hplc ( data not shown ) .
this enzymatic method was used to quantify the biotransformation process of tw01003 biotransformation to tw01003 sulfate .
we conducted pharmacokinetic studies to monitor the blood level of tw01003 and tw01003 sulfate .
in wistar rats ( figure 5 , n = 6 ) , the pharmacokinetic parameters of tw01003 and tw01003 sulfate after i.v. administration of tw01003 were derived from noncompartmental model , based on plasma concentration - time profile .
the systemic exposure of tw01003 sulfate was 2.5 times higher than that of tw01003 ( auc from time 0 to infinite , aucinf 0.71 +/ - 0.25 versus 0.29 +/ - 0.04 h.mug / ml ) .
interestingly , tw01003 sulfate demonstrated a three times higher volume of distribution ( v d 4.43 +/ - 1.52 versus 1.41 +/ - 0.41 l / kg ) , seven times longer residence time ( mrtinf 1.44 +/ - 0.33 versus 0.20 +/ - 0.06 h ) , and 2.3 times lower clearance rate ( cl 3.08 +/ - 0.90 versus 7.05 +/ - 1.12 l / h / kg ) than those of tw01003 .
sulfonation and glucuronidation are the most common metabolic pathways of compounds with aromatic hydroxyl groups [ 12 - 14 ] .
this kind of phase ii metabolism is also demonstrated in tw01003 .
the plasma concentration - time profile after i.v. administration of tw01003 to wistar rats demonstrated a fast metabolism of this compound to its sulfate conjugate as the major metabolite ( figure 3 ) .
however , the glucuronide conjugate became the major metabolite 30 min after tw01003 oral dosing ( figure 4 ) .
enterohepatic circulation might explain the increased bioavailability of this metabolite in the systemic circulation .
the difference in the sulfonation product level after i.v. or oral dosing of tw01003 may have resulted from tissue distribution of the sulfonation enzyme sulfotransferase [ 15 , 16 ] .
sulfotransferase , a family of enzymes encoded by sulfotransferase ( sult ) genes , possesses important physiological functions in the regulation of bile acid enterohepatic circulation [ 17 ] .
it also transfers a sulfate group from 3 ' - phosphoadenosine 5 ' - phosphosulfate to xenobiotics , primarily to aromatic alcohol , to enhance the hydrophilicity of its substrate and thus improve the clearance of the foreign molecules through bile or renal secretion. from the chemical structure of tw01003 shown in figure 6 , the only viable aromatic hydroxyl group is on the pyridine ring , which is not commonly seen in biotransformation reactions [ 18 ] .
there were various mutations identified in the sult enzyme family and they were reported to exhibit different catalytic specificity and capacity in each polymorph form [ 15 ] .
for new drug development , identification of the metabolic pathway is essential .
more studies are needed to explore the enzyme system involved in the sulfonation process .
tw01003 is an antiangiogenesis agent that exhibits strong potency in an in vivo model .
however , the limited half - life failed to explain its in vivo efficacy .
sulfonation in metabolism is mainly regarded as a detoxification mechanism .
it may also serve as a bioactivation process [ 18 , 19 ] that can activate tw01003 with improved exposure , longer half - life , and longer mean residence time .
further investigations are needed to confirm the antiangiogenesis activity of tw01003 sulfate metabolites .
5. conclusion administration of tw01003 exhibited extensive metabolism in both pig and rats .
extensive metabolism leading to the high clearance rate of tw01003 in this study explains the unsatisfactory pharmacokinetics of tw01003 .
as tw01003 exhibited potent anticancer and antiangiogenesis activities , the low systemic bioavailability of tw01003 failed to explain the fact that the activity came from tw01003 per se. from the chemical structure of tw01003 , we suggested an unusual pyridine - oh sulfonation metabolite , and this may serve as an active metabolite for its antiangiogenesis potency .
further studies are needed to identify if the metabolites that demonstrated the anticancer and antiangiogenesis activities are active species .

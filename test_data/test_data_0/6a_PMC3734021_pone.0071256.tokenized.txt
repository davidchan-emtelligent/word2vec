species of conservation concern are increasingly threatened by multiple , anthropogenic stressors which are outside their evolutionary experience .
greater sage - grouse are highly susceptible to the impacts of two such stressors : oil and gas ( energy ) development and west nile virus ( wnv ) .
however , the combined effects of these stressors and their potential interactions have not been quantified .
we used lek ( breeding ground ) counts across a landscape encompassing extensive local and regional variation in the intensity of energy development to quantify the effects of energy development on lek counts , in years with widespread wnv outbreaks and in years without widespread outbreaks .
we then predicted the effects of well density and wnv outbreak years on sage - grouse in northeast wyoming .
absent an outbreak year , drilling an undeveloped landscape to a high permitting level ( 3.1 wells / km2 ) resulted in a 61 % reduction in the total number of males counted in northeast wyoming ( total count ) .
this was similar in magnitude to the 55 % total count reduction that resulted from an outbreak year alone .
however , energy - associated reductions in the total count resulted from a decrease in the mean count at active leks , whereas outbreak - associated reductions resulted from a near doubling of the lek inactivity rate ( proportion of leks with a last count = 0 ) .
lek inactivity quadrupled when 3.1 wells / km2 was combined with an outbreak year , compared to no energy development and no outbreak .
conservation measures should maintain sagebrush landscapes large and intact enough so that leks are not chronically reduced in size due to energy development , and therefore vulnerable to becoming inactive due to additional stressors .

introduction population response to multiple stressors is among the top ten priorities for science to inform conservation and management policy in the united states [ 1 ] .
multiple stressors precipitate the extinction of species [ 2 ] , and limited understanding of cumulative and interactive effects hamper assessments required by the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act [ 3 ] , [ 1 ] .
oil and gas ( energy ) development is an ongoing stressor to wildlife populations on lands throughout the western united states [ 4 ] , and in 2002 , west nile virus ( wnv ) emerged as an additional stressor to these populations [ 5 ] .
the greater sage - grouse ( centrocercus urophasianus ; sage - grouse ) in northeast wyoming provides a case study demonstrating the potential consequences of multiple stressors , such as energy development and disease , on a species of conservation interest .
the sage - grouse is a sagebrush ( artemisia spp. ) obligate species [ 6 ] , and habitat loss and degradation has resulted in a >= 4 decade long population decline [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
the species currently occurs in 11 western states and occupies <= 54 % of its pre - european settlement range [ 9 ] .
wyoming provides habitat for nearly 40 % of the range - wide population [ 10 ] , and landscapes being developed for energy extraction in wyoming contain some of the highest sage - grouse abundances in north america [ 11 ] .
breeding sage - grouse populations are severely impacted at commonly permitted oil and gas well densities [ 12 ] .
impacts have been low or indiscernible at the lowest level ( 0.4 wells / km2 ) , but at medium and high levels ( 1.5 and 3.1 wells / km2 ) , losses on breeding grounds ( leks ) have been 2 - 5 times greater inside than outside of development , and number of males counted at remaining leks declined by 32 to 77 % [ 13 ] .
west nile virus is a known stressor which may compound the impacts from oil and gas development [ 14 ] .
severe wnv outbreaks have been observed in wyoming 's sage - grouse populations since 2003 [ 15 ] , and mortality from the disease could reduce population growth by an average of 6 - 9 % per year [ 14 ] .
in response to sage - grouse population declines in wyoming , conservation areas ( termed ' core areas ') in which new energy development is restricted were delineated in 2008 [ 16 ] .
while negative impacts of energy development on sage - grouse populations have been demonstrated in multiple study areas via demographic studies and counts of males on leks [ 12 ] , research in areas of concentrated development [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] has detected impacts at smaller spatial extents than have regional studies [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
in addition , anthropogenic stressors such as energy development have been hypothesized to interact with wnv to exacerbate sage - grouse population declines [ 14 ] ; however , this hypothesis has yet to be tested .
reasons for differing estimates of the scale at which energy development impacts sage - grouse , and the untested interaction between energy and disease impacts likely stem from similar challenges in estimating stressor effects .
stressor studies are usually first conducted on a relatively small scale , at sites close to development .
a small scale study near development provides a natural starting point , as the study is focused on the source of the impact , and the small spatial scale affords researchers some control over confounding factors , such as vegetation and landscape , that may mask a response to development .
however , if the entire study area is close to development , effects at impacted sites may appear artificially small because the nominal control areas may also be affected by development [ 22 ] .
a small scale study close to development becomes particularly problematic when multiple stressors and their potential interactions are considered .
correctly quantifying multiple main effects and interactions requires more than data with a wide range of intensities for each stressor .
it also requires that the different intensities for any one stressor be observed in combination with the different intensities of each of the other stressors [ 23 ] .
the goals of our research were threefold .
first , we aimed to identify the scale of energy impacts to leks , using data that encompassed both local and regional variation in levels of energy development .
second , we developed a model and tested for interactions between energy development and wnv outbreak years , again accounting for both local and regional variation in levels of energy development .
third , we used our model to predict the effects of energy development on sage - grouse in the presence and absence of a wnv outbreak year in a heavily developed area of wyoming , where energy development is an ongoing threat to sage - grouse populations .
methods study region while our primary interest was in northeast wyoming , this area contains such extensive energy development that we widened our study region to encompass less developed and undeveloped areas as well .
our study region covered 20 million ha of eastern montana , northeast wyoming and the western dakotas , encompassing most of the western association of fish and wildlife agencies ( wafwa ) sage - grouse management zone i ( fig. 1 ) .
the region is generally dominated by large stands of sagebrush , with an understory of native and nonnative grasses and forbs .
dominant land uses are a mixture of cattle grazing and tillage agriculture , interspersed with concentrated areas of energy development [ 18 ] .
west nile virus is omnipresent throughout the region [ 24 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0071256.g001 figure 1 study region and the sub - areas it contains .
a ) north - central montana , b ) central montana , c ) eastern montana , d ) western dakotas , and e ) northeast wyoming .
the tradeoff for having a large - scale study capturing large regional variation in energy development was that detailed , accurate vegetation data were unavailable for such a vast expanse of land .
thus , to capture variation in lek size due to natural landscape attributes within the region , we divided the study region into five sub - areas ( fig. 1 ) , based on the wafwa sage - grouse subpopulation designations [ 7 ] .
sub - areas included our focal area , northeast wyoming , and the four sub - areas that added varied stressor intensities to our analyses : north - central montana , central montana , eastern montana and western dakotas .
data sources we defined a sage - grouse lek as a site where multiple males have been recorded displaying on multiple visits [ 18 ] .
we obtained lek count and location data from the government agencies responsible for maintaining these data .
we censored any leks with errors detected , in conjunction with agency personnel , as well as leks known to be destroyed by housing subdivisions or mining .
if a lek was counted multiple times within a year , we used the maximum count for that year [ 18 ] , [ 25 ] .
because leks often occur in a complex , with males moving among leks within 2.5 km of each other , we defined the largest and most regularly attended lek in the group as the complex center [ 7 ] .
we used the count from each complex center to represent the entire complex , eliminating from the database counts from the smaller and less attended satellite leks .
hereafter , the term ' lek ' refers to the sample unit of our analyses , which includes complex centers and single leks that were not part of a complex .
for each lek , we used the value of the most recent count that was collected between 2003 and 2009 ( last count ) , excluding from the analyses any leks that became inactive ( count = 0 ) before 2003 and remained inactive on all subsequent counts .
we used a single , post - 2002 count instead of a time series analysis for two reasons .
first , only a small , non - random group of leks have sufficient data to support a time series analysis .
second , we restricted our study to the years after which wnv was first detected in the study region .
west nile virus was first detected in the study region in 2002 [ 5 ] , but leks are counted in early spring , before the majority of wnv transmission occurs in late summer , thus the effects of the disease could not have been apparent in lek counts until spring , 2003 .
energy development was quantified by the density of producing oil and gas wells near the lek on april 1 in the sample year .
we defined the sample year as the year of the last count , both for active leks ( last count > 0 ) and for the inactive leks ( last count = 0 ) that had a positive penultimate count .
for inactive leks with an unbroken string of zero counts , the sample year was the year of the first zero count .
we calculated well density within the following radii of leks to capture a range of potential ecological and management processes relevant to sage - grouse : 1.0 km , 3.2 km , 5 km , 10 km , and 15 km and 20 km. processes that impact breeding birds at leks should be captured by the 1 km radius [ 18 ] .
the 3.2 km radius was previously found to be a best - fit scale for detecting energy impacts [ 18 ] , and it has been used to implement some drilling restrictions [ 16 ] and to predict lek losses due to energy development [ 13 ] .
telemetry studies in the eastern portion of the sage grouse range ( management zone 1 , fig. 1 ) have found that over 95 % of nests are within 15 km of the lek at which the female was captured [ 26 ] , [ 20 ] .
finally , effects in our study region have previously been discerned as far as 20 km from development [ 21 ] .
because lag times have previously been used in analyses that correlated well density with lek inactivity [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , we initially explored the effect of incorporating a 1 - 10 year lag time between the sample year and the measured well density .
real time measurements consistently outperformed lagged measurements in the initial analyses , thus we dropped lag times from subsequent analyses .
west nile virus outbreaks were documented in multiple species in the summers of 2003 and 2007 [ 5 ] , and outbreaks in sage - grouse populations in montana , wyoming , and south dakota severely impacted survival and nearly extirpated at least one population [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 27 ] .
because these outbreaks had the potential to affect spring 2004 and 2008 lek counts , respectively , we assigned positive outbreak year status to each lek whose sample year was 2004 or 2008 .
although we refer simply to ' wnv outbreak years ' , we note that other environmental variables may have been associated with those years and may partly explain the population - level effects that occurred during wnv outbreak years .
statistical analyses model structure our analyses were based on lek count regressions .
using lek counts allowed us to estimate the immediate relationship between stressors and the total number of males in a sub - area by simultaneously estimating lek activity and the number of males at active leks .
most lek count analyses have been based on activity - inactivity data , and have thus needed to incorporate lag times to account for the time energy development takes to deplete leks to the point of inactivity ( e.g. [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ]) .
we used a zero - inflated negative binomial ( zinb ) likelihood function , which is ideally suited to overdispersed count data , where the variance is a strongly increasing function of the mean , and there are an unusually large number of zero counts [ 28 ] .
the zinb is a mixture of a negative binomial distribution and a point mass at zero , meaning that some zero counts are generated by the negative binomial distribution , and some are generated by the point mass of zeros , but all positive counts come from the negative binomial distribution .
we parameterized the zinb so the negative binomial distribution was described by a mean and overdispersion parameter , and the mixing parameter ( which governs the amount of zero - inflation ) was the probability that a count belonged to the negative binomial distribution .
we used a log link for the negative binomial mean and a logit link for the mixing parameter .
we used randomized quantile residuals [ 29 ] to validate the fit of the zinb likelihood function to the data .
unlike most generalized linear model residuals that exhibit only asymptotic normality , randomized quantile residuals are normally distributed , provided the data are distributed according to the specified likelihood function .
thus we used these residuals to verify that the zinb was an appropriate likelihood function .
we used profile likelihood confidence intervals for parameters and 10,000 case - based , nonparametric bootstrap samples to estimate 95 % confidence bands for predicted lines .
all analyses were conducted in the r programming environment , version 2.10.0 [ 30 ] .
identifying spatial extent of energy impacts to identify the spatial scale at which energy impacts to sage - grouse leks are best detected , we repeated , for each radius , a regression of lek count against well density .
each regression used the same well density to predict the negative binomial mean ( nb component ) and the mixing parameter ( zi component ) .
we compared the resulting six non - nested models with aic [ 31 ] .
because the six models all had the same number of parameters , this procedure was equivalent to comparing the models' maximum likelihood values .
testing for interactions and reducing the model to test for interactions between energy development and wnv outbreak years , we first fit a saturated model that contained each of the following effects for both the nb and zi components : well density ( measured at the best - fit radius obtained above ) , a factor for wnv outbreak year , a well density by outbreak year interaction , and a factor for sub - area .
the factor for sub - area adjusted for differences in lek size due to natural variation across the study region , allowing for the possibility that leks might be naturally larger or smaller in northeast wyoming ( where most of the high well densities exist ) than in other parts of the study region .
we tested each interaction term separately using a likelihood ratio test to determine if it was significant ( p <= 0.05 ) .
to obtain a reduced model with which to make predictions , we first removed any non - significant interactions .
we then tested the significance of main effects on which significant interactions did not depend , and removed any with p > 0.05 .
predictions we used our reduced model to predict the effects of different well densities on lek counts in the northeast wyoming sub - area , subsequent to a wnv outbreak year , and absent an outbreak year .
we make predictions for well densities up to the highest federal permitting level of 3.1 wells / km2 , which is similar to the maximum well density observed at the 20 km radius ( 2.9 wells / km2 ) , and below the maximum well density at all other radii ( 3.6 - 7.9 wells / km2 ) .
in particular , we used the estimated parameters to calculate the probability a lek was active , the mean count at active leks , and the total northeast wyoming lek count ( total count ) .
we obtained the total count as the product of the mean count at all leks ( whether or not they were active ) and the number of leks from northeast wyoming .
we also calculated the number of leks that would be inactive ( 0 males ) , as well as the number in small (< 11 males ) , medium ( 11 - 25 males ) and large (> 25 males ) size categories [ 20 ] , by calculating the probability a lek would fall into a category and multiplying it by the number of leks from northeast wyoming .
results identifying spatial extent of energy impacts when lek count was regressed on well density alone , the 20 km radius explained the variation in the data better than did 4 of the 5 other radii ( deltaaic > 2 , table 1 ) .
while the 20 km radius provided a nominally better fit than did the 5 km radius , it was statistically indistinguishable ( deltaaic < 2 ) .
to confirm whether or not the 20 km radius better explained the variation in the data than did the 5 km radius , we compared aic values for these two radii using the saturated model .
the 5 km radius had a deltaaic value > 4 points higher than the 20 km radius , confirming the best fit was achieved using the 20 km radius .

twenty percent of leks were assigned a positive outbreak year status , and 80 % were not : this did not depend on the presence or absence of oil and gas wells within 20 km. leks in different sub - areas were subject to different levels of stressors , underscoring the need for our study region to include sub - areas beyond the northeast wyoming focal area .
the percent of leks within 20 km of oil or gas wells varied from 29 % in north - central montana to 100 % in northeast wyoming , and the percent of leks with positive outbreak year status varied from 11 % in the western dakotas to 27 % in eastern montana .

testing for interactions and reducing the model interactions between well density and outbreak year were significant in the zi ( p = 0.0051 ) and nb ( p = 0.0058 ) components .
the coefficient for the zi interaction was negative , meaning there was more zero - inflation at high well densities in an outbreak year compared to a non - outbreak year .
the coefficient for the nb interaction was positive , meaning the negative binomial mean was higher at high well densities in an outbreak year compared to a non - outbreak year .
the final model contained all effects from the saturated model ( table 3 ) , including the factors for sub - area ( nb component , p = 2x10 - 12 ; zi component , p = 2x10 - 22 ) .
because the interactions between well density and outbreak year were significant , we did not test the underlying main effects for removal .
nevertheless , the main effect of well density was seen primarily in the nb component where the distribution 's mean decreased with increasing well density .
the main effect of outbreak year was seen primarily in the zi component , where zero - inflation was higher in outbreak years .
both of these main effects are reflected by parameter confidence intervals that do not overlap zero .

predictions effect of well density in the absence of an outbreak year absent an outbreak - year , drilling an undeveloped landscape to the permitting level of 3.1 wells / km2 reduced the predicted total northeast wyoming count ( total count ) by 61 % ( fig. 2a , table 4 ) , from an estimated 4537 males to 1768 males .
underscoring the strength of this reduction are the non - overlapping 95 % confidence intervals [ ci : 3668 , 5507 ] and [ ci : 1162 , 2554 ] .
the decrease in the total count was caused by the decrease in the mean count at active leks , which declined from 18 [ ci : 15 , 22 ] to 6 [ ci : 5 , 9 ] ( fig. 2b ) .
furthermore , the decreasing mean count at active leks resulted from fewer large and medium - sized leks and more small leks ( table 4 ) .
for example , the 60 [ ci : 42 , 80 ] large leks predicted to exist if northeast wyoming had no oil and gas development decreased to 2 [ ci : 0,10 ] with development to 3.1 wells / km2 .
conversely , the 91 [ ci : 73 , 111 ] small leks predicted to exist without development increased to 232 [ ci : 180 , 266 ] at 3.1 wells / km2 .
lek inactivity rates , however , remained relatively constant between and 24 % [ ci : 15 % , 38 %] and 33 % [ ci : 26 % , 41 %] , regardless of well density ( fig. 2c ) .

effect of outbreak year in the absence of oil and gas development in the absence of energy development , we predicted a wnv outbreak year would cause the total count to decline by 55 % ( 4537 [ ci : 3668 , 5507 ] to 2037 [ ci : 1318 , 3062 ]) , which is similar to the 61 % reduction achieved by drilling to 3.1 wells / km2 .
the outbreak year reduction in the total count was driven by a near doubling of lek inactivity , from 33 % ( 26 % , 41 %) to 65 % ( 51 % , 75 %) .
the mean count at active leks remained relatively constant between 16 [ ci : 12 , 20 ] and 18 [ ci : 15 , 22 ] males .
combined effects of well density and outbreak year the mean inactivity rate associated with outbreak years increased with increasing energy development , but with high variation around predictions .
the 65 % [ ci : 51 % , 75 %] inactivity rate predicted without development rose to 98 % [ ci : 74 % , 100 %] with development to 3.1 wells / km2 .
while the mean count at active leks subsequent to an outbreak year increased with increasing energy development , this result was unreliable .
unrealistically large confidence intervals for active leks with high well densities and positive outbreak year status precluded meaningful predictions for their mean count ( fig. 2d ). with an outbreak year and no oil and gas development , the mean count at active leks was 18 [ ci : 15 , 22 ]. with an outbreak year and 3.1 wells / km2 , the confidence interval had a lower limit of 1 and an upper limit of 594 males , compared to a maximum lek count of 115 males in the raw data .
this uncertainty is a direct result of how few active leks in areas of high oil and gas development were last counted after an outbreak year .
in particular , of the 1139 leks in our analysis , only 2 that were last counted subsequent to a wnv outbreak year were also active and had well densities > 1.5 wells / km2 in the 20 km radius .
the uncertainty in the mean count at active leks with high well densities and an outbreak year is also reflected in the expected total count under these conditions .
however , at lower well densities , the relationship between well density , outbreak year and total count is less variable .
for example , at 0.75 wells / km2 , we predicted an outbreak year would produce a total count of 1473 [ ci : 65 , 2616 ] males , 40 % of the 3648 [ ci : 3147 , 4204 ] males predicted at the same well density subsequent to non - outbreak year .
discussion energy development and wnv are both outside the sage - grouse evolutionary experience , and our work is the first to quantify their combined effects , across a 20 million ha region encompassing a wide range of stressor intensities .
combinations of stressors are important drivers of extinction , particularly when they are outside the evolutionary experience of a species [ 2 ] .
the doubling of lek inactivity rates as a result of outbreak years is consistent with the extreme susceptibility of sage - grouse to this novel disease [ 32 ] and near population extirpation observed in the field [ 15 ] .
furthermore , our work shows the progression of effects on lek counts previously documented as a 2 - 10 year time lag between the onset of development and lek inactivity [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
we demonstrate an immediate decrease in lek size due to increasing well density , increased inactivity subsequent to outbreak years , and an inactivity rate subsequent to outbreak years that is worsened by high levels of oil and gas development .
multiple mechanisms may underlie the synergistic effects of energy development and outbreak years on lek inactivity .
first , the prevalence of wnv may be higher within coal bed natural gas fields [ 14 ] , [ 18 ] because ponds created from ground water brought to the surface during gas extraction provide additional habitat for the mosquito , culex tarsalis , a known wnv vector [ 15 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] .
on the other hand , increasing inactivity of small leks after outbreak years could have resulted from other unfavorable environmental conditions associated with the outbreak years in our analyses .
for example , higher summer temperatures can increase wnv transmission [ 14 ] , but high temperatures can also be associated with drought , which can affect range conditions , and as a result , chick production [ 36 ] .
we suggest that reductions in the size of active leks as a result of energy development may set the stage for other stressors to cause lek inactivity , because sage - grouse populations in developed areas are already small , and vulnerable to stochastic events [ 37 ] .
while wnv is a major threat to sage - grouse in the eastern portion of their range , and one whose outbreaks correlate well with lek inactivity , it is but one threat to populations already reduced by energy development .
in other areas , events such as wildfire are as much or more of a threat to sage - grouse than wnv [ 38 ] , and they , too , might become the final straw for populations reduced by energy development .
moreover , species like sage - grouse , whose productivity and population growth rate vary markedly from year to year [ 39 ] , may be particularly vulnerable to extirpation from even a single stressor .
the high variation in population growth guarantees episodic years in which the species fares poorly , thus reduced population size due to one stressor may be exacerbated to the point of extirpation as a result of natural fluctuations in population growth .
the scale at which sage - grouse are impacted by energy development now appears to be larger than initially thought .
we suggest that sage - grouse may respond to energy development primarily at a large scale , and secondarily in close proximity to the lek .
the primary , large - scale response of sage - grouse to energy development is supported both by our work and by previous studies that have found similarly large scales of impact in mostly undeveloped regions [ 20 ] or in regions that contained a mixture of highly developed and undeveloped areas [ 21 ] .
the secondary , local response is supported by the comparatively small scales of impact in localities already developed for oil and gas extraction [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 40 ] , most of which were highly developed by the time of study [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
if much of an area is already developed , effects at impacted sites may appear artificially small because the nominal control areas may also be affected by development [ 22 ] .
future research should further evaluate the possibility of oil and gas development having both large and small scale effects on sage - grouse populations .
a persistent problem in the conservation of declining populations is a disparity between the spatial scale of management actions and the scale at which populations respond [ 3 ] .
when we account for the large - scale response of sage - grouse to energy development , the effective size of core conservation areas designed to protect sage - grouse populations in northeast wyoming becomes negligible .
in fact , as of 2009 , all active leks in northeast wyoming had at least one producing oil and gas well within 20 km. this results from widespread oil and gas development in northeast wyoming , its core areas having been selected after substantial energy development had already occurred , and boundaries having been delineated to include leks , but not necessarily a buffer between the lek and the development boundary ( fig. 3 ) .
while a lek provides an important center of breeding activity , and a conspicuous location at which to count birds , its size is merely an index to the population dynamics in the surrounding habitat .
for example , in the eastern portion of their range ( management zone 1 ) , female sage - grouse captured on a lek use an approximately 15 - km radius around the lek for nesting ; by contrast , a 3.2 - km radius ( which is used for some drilling restrictions near leks ) encompasses only 35 - 50 % of nests associated with the lek [ 26 ] , [ 20 ] .
thus attempting to protect a lek , without protecting the surrounding habitat , provides little protection at all .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0071256.g003 figure 3 northeast wyoming leks , oil and gas wells and core sage - grouse management areas .
as of 2009 , the pictured leks were active and the pictured wells were producing .
coupling our findings with those of others [ 6 ] further characterizes sage - grouse as a wildland species that requires large , intact sagebrush landscapes , and is largely intolerant of human disturbance .
our work compliments new science from the western portion of the species' range where active leks have only 0.3 % developed land within a 5 km radius compared to 8.7 % at inactive leks [ 41 ] .
to deliver conservation more effectively , each of 11 western sage - grouse states recently delineated core areas for conservation [ 42 ] , and most policies restrict or eliminate new developments inside these areas of high bird abundance .
core area policy in wyoming , for example , restricts new development to an average of one oil or gas well pad per 2.6 km2 , places a 5 % cap on total disturbance , and steers new drilling to less impactful places [ 16 ] .
while abatement measures for wnv are sensible [ 14 ] , placing new developments outside of core areas has the greatest likelihood of sustaining populations .
the 2012 near - term greater sage - grouse conservation action plan lays out a spatially explicit approach by identifying the threats for each core area , the appropriate conservation action to abate those threats , and the probability of success if those actions are fully implemented [ 43 ] .
our findings corroborate this spatial approach for reducing all stressors in core areas so that beneficial conservation measures are not negated by detrimental actions .

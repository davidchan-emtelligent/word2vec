laterally transferred genes are shown to be less involved in protein - protein interactions , and essential genes that exhibit low duplicability and high connectivity do exhibit mostly vertical descent .
background lateral gene transfer is a major force in microbial evolution and a great source of genetic innovation in prokaryotes .
protein complexity has been claimed to be a barrier for gene transfer , due to either the inability of a new gene 's encoded protein to become a subunit of an existing complex ( lack of positive selection ) , or from a harmful effect exerted by the newcomer on native protein assemblages ( negative selection ) .
results we tested these scenarios using data from the model prokaryote escherichia coli .
surprisingly , the data did not support an inverse link between membership in protein complexes and gene transfer .
as the complexity hypothesis , in its strictest sense , seemed valid only to essential complexes , we broadened its scope to include connectivity in general .
transferred genes are found to be less involved in protein - protein interactions , outside stable complexes , and this is especially true for genes recently transferred to the e. coli genome .
thus , subsequent to transfer , new genes probably integrate slowly into existing protein - interaction networks .
we show that a low duplicability of a gene is linked to a lower chance of being horizontally transferred .
notably , many essential genes in e. coli are conserved as singletons across multiple related genomes , have high connectivity and a highly vertical phylogenetic signal .
conclusion high complexity and connectivity generally do not impede gene transfer .
however , essential genes that exhibit low duplicability and high connectivity do exhibit mostly vertical descent .
background lateral gene transfer ( lgt ) is a major force in microbial evolution , driving bacterial genetic innovation and speciation [ 1,2 ] .
the common intuitive notion of a lateral transfer event is an acquisition of a locus or allele with a new and potentially useful function .
indeed , it has been claimed that laterally acquired genes may only be fixed in a population if they are under strong positive selection [ 3 ] .
the scarcity of transfer of genes involved in informational processes (' informational genes ') such as transcription and translation was , therefore , attributed to lack of positive selection due to the inability of newly acquired proteins to interact with their pre - existing native counterparts [ 4 ] .
according to this concept , designated ' the complexity hypothesis' [ 4 ] , the chances of a gene to be beneficial to a new host are greatly influenced by the number of its interactions with its new neighbors - implying a direct link between complexity and lgt ( figure 1a , solid arrow ) .
figure 1 alternative scenarios for the effect of complexity and duplicability on lateral gene transfer .
( a ) complexity could be operating directly ( solid line ) on lgt or indirectly ( dotted line ) through its effect on duplicability ; ( b ) complexity and duplicability are correlated ( dotted line ) , and each is effecting lgt independently .
an alternative explanation for the paucity of transfer of informational genes may be negative ( purifying ) selection operating against gene acquisition .
for many major cellular functions , in particular essential ones , there is likely to be a homologous ancestral gene already present when a foreign ortholog is acquired .
in these cases , the laterally acquired gene will have to coexist alongside its native homolog before orthologous replacement ( also called xenologous gene displacement ) can occur .
if the foreign gene is expressed , the chances that this coexistence will be deleterious to the host is especially high when the gene 's encoded protein is involved in protein - protein interactions , and even more so when it is a subunit of a protein complex .
this is because the increase in concentration of one component ( that is , the effect of gene dosage resulting from a single gene duplication ) can either inhibit complex assembly , or form undesirable toxic interactions , as described in ' the balance hypothesis' [ 5 ] .
the authors showed that genes encoding protein complex subunits have lower duplicability , that is , are less likely to have multiple paralogs in a genome .
we propose that a horizontally acquired homolog can exert an even more profound negative influence , compared with a duplication product , even at low expression levels .
this is because it could be similar enough to interact with a native protein and yet sufficiently different so that an aberrant interaction is formed , destabilizing a native complex in what is often called a ' dominant negative ' effect .
this situation will result in an indirect effect of complexity on lgt mediated through gene duplicability ( figure 1a , dotted arrows ) .
here we perform several analyses aimed at testing the compatibility of the complexity hypothesis and the balance hypothesis with existing protein interaction data , using escherichia coli as a model for prokaryotic evolution .
results and discussion protein complexity and duplicability in e. coli previous work in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated that protein complexity ( number of subunits in a protein ) and gene duplicability are inversely correlated , which was attributed to the effects of gene dosage [ 5 ] .
accordingly , members of large gene families ( having at least three paralogs ) were shown to be significantly under - represented in yeast protein complexes when compared to singletons [ 5 ] .
we tested whether a similar trend exists in the model prokaryote e. coli , which is somewhat less complex than yeast on the organismal level .
all available subunit data for e. coli were retrieved from swissprot [ 6 ] , and family membership for each gene was obtained from the emu server ( see materials and methods ) .
the comparison showed that , in e. coli , gene families with three or more paralogs are in fact under - represented in monomers ( 20.44 %) and not , as expected , in hetero - oligomeric protein complexes , where their fraction ( 29.98 %) is very similar to that of the whole genome ( 31.24 %) .
furthermore , the data indicated that unlike yeast [ 7 ] , a group composed of characterized monomers and homo - oligomers had a similar fraction of singletons ( q ) to that of the whole e. coli proteome , and monomers of e. coli even have a higher q value than the genomic fraction ( table 1 ) .
notably , whereas in saccharomyces the q value for hetero - oligomeric proteins of medium size and above ( having at least three subunits of more than one type of polypeptide ) was very high , the corresponding q value in e. coli was not higher than that observed for monomers in the latter organism .
thus , current e. coli protein data do not support a link between gene duplicability and membership in protein complexes .

this finding is in agreement with recent findings by ochman and colleagues [ 8 ] , demonstrating differences in protein interaction network evolution between eukaryotes and prokaryotes .
protein - protein interactions outside multimeric proteins also contribute greatly to the complexity of an organism .
however , unlike subunits in a protein complex , external interactions usually do not require precise stoichiometry and may , consequently , be less sensitive to dosage effects .
therefore , one would expect these interactions not to be linked to duplicability .
indeed , there was no significant difference in q for proteins having a single interaction versus those with multiple interactions in e. coli ( p = 0.21 ) .
recently , a high - throughput analysis of protein - protein interactions in e. coli has been carried out using a his - tagged clone library pull - down [ 9 ] that is more sensitive than the tap - or spa - tagged bait protein approach used previously [ 10 ] and thus provides interaction data for most e. coli proteins .
high - throughput methods cannot distinguish between interactions of subunits within a stable protein complex and those that are external to the complex .
therefore , the data include the cumulative contribution of both types of interaction to complexity .
this category of combined interactions will henceforth be referred to as connectivity .
in agreement with the swissprot data , the q value of proteins with more than one interaction in the pull - down study ( table 1 ) was not significantly higher than that of proteins with a single interaction ( p = 0.71 ) .
nevertheless , an analysis of the number of interacting partners of these proteins showed that , in e. coli , singletons have significantly more partners ( a higher connectivity ) than do proteins with paralogs ( 4.474 versus 4.095 , p = 0.01 ) , so some correlation between connectivity and duplicability does exist .
characterized protein complexes are not resistant to transfer correlating complexity or duplicability with lgt on a genomic scale is complicated by the fact that different lgt detection methods often identify different subsets of genes [ 11,12 ] .
therefore , for our analysis we relied on two different datasets : genes identified as being acquired by lgt by bayesian phylogenetic analysis [ 12,13 ] and genes identified as transferred due to atypical nucleotide composition [ 11,14 ] .
this last group of genes is thought to represent relatively recent transfer events [ 11,12 ] .
in order to address general ' transferability ' of genes in microbial evolution , rather than just specific origin of genes in e. coli , we used an established global estimator , the ' phylogenetically discordant sequence ' ( pds ) metric .
this parameter measures the extent to which a protein 's phylogenetic signal matches most other proteins' phylogenetic signals in a genome by examining its similarity to its reciprocal best matches in other genomes [ 15,16 ] .
values range from 0 to 1 , where a totally concordant sequence has a score of 1 , and a highly discordant protein has a score of 0 .
it is important to note that a gene that is vertically derived in e. coli but has been involved in many lgt events in other taxa could have a low pds score , due to its irregular pattern , which is appropriate for global assessment of a gene 's propensity for lgt .
also , transfers within closely related organisms will generally affect pds to a lesser extent than transfers between remote taxa [ 15 ] .
having a foreign variant of a protein could have a destabilizing effect on a complex , even a homo - oligomeric one , resulting in a dominant negative phenotype .
if selection against lgt is mediated by such a dominant negative mechanism , one would expect to observe a difference between the lgt propensity of monomers , which should be free of such selection , and oligomeric complexes , such as homodimers or homotetramers .
when comparing e. coli proteins ( table 2 ) with swissprot subunit data ( see materials and methods ) we observed no significant difference in pds between monomers and other homo - oligomers ( p = 0.056 ) , indicating no support for such a role in bacterial protein evolution .
when a protein complex involves more than one type of polypeptide , the chance for a negative influence of a foreign homolog may increase due to the effect of gene dosage - the requirement of a precise molar ratio between subunits in order to guarantee a functional complex [ 5 ] .
however , comparing pds values between hetero - oligomeric complexes and the group containing monomers / homo - oligomers showed only an insignificant increase in the average pds value ( p = 0.16 ) .
it appears , therefore , that protein complexes are seldom a major barrier to transfer , unless essential complexes are involved ( see below ) .
a possible explanation for this observation is that genes encoding complex components tend to be located adjacent to each other in prokaryotes .
thus , a lateral transfer event can , in principle , transfer the whole complex as a unit [ 17 ] , be it on a plasmid or genomic island .
a good example of an extremely large and complex structure that has been frequently transferred is the virulence - associated bacterial type iii secretion systems [ 18 ] .
similarly , a global survey of lgt across microbial genomes has shown microbial surface structures such as pili , which are often multimeric , to be frequent products of transfer [ 19 ] .
pili - encoding genes are nearly always found in operons , so the combination of a function that improves fitness in a niche and location appears to be more potent than the negative effects of complexity , if any , in determining transferability .

sem , standard error of the mean .
frequently transferred genes have fewer external interaction partners although the original complexity hypothesis was mostly focused on protein complexes , the authors nevertheless left room for other interactions .
indeed , jain and colleagues [ 4 ] stated that ".. .
the probability of a successful horizontal transfer will be strongly affected by the number of interactions that a protein must make with its neighbors. " thus , we suggest that the scope of the complexity hypothesis should be expanded to include all connectivity , rather than complexity .
characterized e. coli proteins that were found to be involved in a single interaction were , therefore , compared to proteins with multiple interactions ( table 2 ) .
notably , proteins with multiple interactions have a higher average pds value ( 0.845 ) than proteins with a single interaction ( 0.766 ) , and the difference is significant ( p = 0.00005 ) .
a similar trend was observed for the pull - down data , but was not significant ( pds scores of 0.732 and 0.711 , respectively , p = 0.086 ) .
thus , genes that are more frequently transferred in evolution tend to have lower connectivity , in agreement with our broader definition of the complexity hypothesis .
the fractions of laterally transferred interacting genes ( one interaction or more ) in e. coli , identified by either composition or bayesian phylogeny , were not significantly different from the average for e. coli .
however , high - throughput interaction data ( that includes interactions within a protein complex , see above ) indicate that although transferred genes identified by bayesian phylogeny have a higher connectivity average that is not significant ( 4.495 versus the e. coli average of 4.305 , p = 0.311 ) , the acquired genes with atypical composition , assumed to be more recent arrivals in the genome , have a significantly lower number of interactions ( 3.9922 , p = 0.049 ) .
it therefore appears that genes that are more recent arrivals in a genome have lower connectivity than the rest of the genes and probably have not integrated fully into the genome 's interaction network .
thus , the broader sense of the complexity hypothesis is again in agreement with the data .
the evolutionary mechanism behind our observation remains unclear - is it that genes that have to interact with multiple partners are seldom retained or do transferred genes just gradually adapt to the new network ?
we feel our findings regarding recently transferred genes support the latter explanation , but the former alternative cannot altogether be rejected .
duplication resistant genes are also resistant to lgt we compared the pds values in the e. coli genome of single copy genes ( singletons ) to those of genes that are part of gene families or have at least one paralog ( table 2 ) .
singletons have a significantly higher average pds value than genes with paralogs ( p < 0.00001 ) , indicating that genes that are seldom duplicated are also rarely transferred , correlating duplicability with transferability .
conversely , putative transferred genes of atypical composition in e. coli have a high singleton fraction , exceeding the average singleton content of e. coli , though this was not statistically significant ( 0.597 versus 0.553 , p = 0.053 ) .
while this finding may seem contradictory , it is not surprising , given that many genes with atypical composition are either orfans [ 20 ] or very poorly conserved singletons .
the other dataset of putative transfers could not be used for comparison since it is methodically enriched for singletons [ 13 ] .
a possible explanation is that xenologous gene displacement is more likely to occur when the replaced allele already has paralogs in the genome .
indeed , genes that have three paralogs or more in e. coli had significantly lower pds values than those where only a pair of paralogs exists ( 0.66 versus 0.722 , p = 0.00004 ) .
surprisingly , low duplicability by itself ( that is , not reflecting the effect of complexity ; figure 1 ) seems to operate as a barrier to transfer , even though complexity does not ( see above ) .
this finding indicates that other forces may be at play , such as the ability of the cell to maintain optimal metabolic fitness in the presence of an extra homolog that may disrupt its regulatory homeostasis .
paradoxically , a gene acquired from a genetically remote organism may be less harmful to the organism , since it is less likely to be expressed at a significant level , owing to poor promoter recognition by the resident rna polymerase sigma factors and alien codon usage .
indeed , artificially implanting the genome of synechocystis pcc6803 into the genetically distant bacterium bacillus subtilis was successful once the former 's rrna operons were removed , thus probably reducing the expression levels of alien proteins [ 21 ] .
furthermore , a closely related allele may be homogenized by gene conversion through homologous recombination , while a distant one cannot undergo this process [ 22 ] .
thus , duplicability barriers can on the one hand prevent lgt and on the other promote fixation of genes from remote sources .
essential genes and conserved singletons to further establish a link between duplicability and lgt , we examined a collection of genes that were ' conserved singletons ' , meaning they were both ubiquitous and had no paralogs , in several gamma - proteobacteria [ 23 ] , and observed that 200 out of 205 genes had pds values greater than 0.99 , reflecting probable vertical descent in most known genomes .
this is in agreement with lerat and colleagues' [ 23 ] finding , based on phylogenetic inference , establishing that 203 out of 205 singleton genes had compatible phylogenies within the gamma - proteobacteria .
thus , it is reasonable to conclude that genes that are conserved singletons will tend to be rarely transferred .
an unusually large fraction ( 74.25 %) of essential protein - coding genes in e. coli are singletons .
the trivial explanation is that for these genes no paralog can compensate for a mutation , making them indispensable .
however , one can also argue that the importance of these genes and precise regulation of their expression hinders their duplication .
indeed , of the 233 essential protein coding genes in e. coli , nearly half ( 115 ) are found in lerat and colleagues' conserved singleton dataset , supporting the possibility of duplication resistance [ 23 ] .
the average pds value for those essential genes was high ( 0.97 ) as was their connectivity ( 5.765 interactions in the pull - down study ) .
unlike the majority of e. coli genes , both the complexity hypothesis and the balance hypothesis are supported for this unique assemblage .
relative resistance to transfer can be expected for those genes that are both highly ubiquitous and duplication - resistant because the transition state in which both foreign and native alleles coexist could be deleterious , if not fatal .
we also hypothesize that genes that are conserved singletons in the vast majority of available prokaryotic genomes , in which they occur , will have a high impact on the fitness of these organisms .
conclusion our findings shed new light on current paradigms on transferability and duplicability of genes in prokaryotes .
we propose that duplicability and , to a lesser degree , connectivity , can directly affect the fixation of laterally transferred genes in prokaryotic genomes ( figure 1b ) .
we expand the complexity hypothesis to include general connectivity and show that , in its strictest sense , it applies mostly to essential complexes .
many phylogenetic studies base their analysis on single copy genes to avoid problems in discerning orthology .
based on the findings presented here it is likely that this practice in fact filters out many laterally transferred genes .
while this may be desirable when reconstructing organismal phylogenies (' trees of life ') based on a non - transferred core [ 23 ] , it is highly inappropriate when assessing the impact of lgt on different genomes .

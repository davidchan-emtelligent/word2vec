background to investigate the magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) characteristics of ovarian sertoli - leydig cell tumors ( slct ) .
methods the clinical , mri and pathological findings of five cases of slct were reviewed retrospectively .
mri appearances of tumors including laterality , shape and size , architecture , wall , septa and vegetation , signal intensity and contrast - enhancement pattern were evaluated and correlated with pathological findings .
results two tumors were solid which appeared as low signal intensity on t1 - weighted imaging ( t1wi ) and moderate on t2 - weighted imaging ( t2wi ) with multiple small cysts in one of them .
the remaining three slct were multilocular cystic with the irregularly thickened wall and septa , and with solid area and mural nodules in one of them .
the cystic components had the same signal intensity as urine .
all the solid components were intensely enhanced after administration of contrast medium .
all five tumors were pathologically intermediate differentiation and at figo stage i. conclusions slct demonstrate variable mri morphological appearances .
however , the irregularly thickened wall and septa , the moderate t2wi signal intensity and obvious enhancement in the solid components are three mri features .
ovary sertoli - leydig cell tumors magnetic resonance imaging pathology background sertoli - leydig cell tumors ( slct ) of ovary are a rare type but well defined clinicopathologic entity of sex cord - stromal tumors , accounting for less than 0.5 % of ovarian neoplasms [ 1 ] .
these tumors are histopathologically characterized by the presence of variable proportions of sertoli and leydig cells .
most slct occur in young women and are at stage i ( international federation of gynecology and obstetrics , figo ) [ 2 ] .
conservative surgery is acceptable for young patients who wish to preserve fertility without compromising 5 - year disease - specific survival [ 3 ] .
some clinicopathological studies of slct have been reported .
to our knowledge , however , only three imaging case reports have been published [ 4 - 6 ] .
the present study described the magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) appearances of five patients with slct by correlated with pathological findings , with the aim to be familiar with the imaging appearances of this entity and improve the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis .
methods patients this retrospective study was approved by the institutional review boards of our hospitals and informed consent was waived .
patients with suspected ovarian tumor were enrolled in an ovarian tumor mri study project from february 2008 to november 2012 at jinshan hospital and obstetrics & gynecology hospital of fudan university .
among 530 cases proven by surgery and histopathology , a total of five patients with slct were found .
mri scan and analysis all patients were performed with 1.5 - t mri scanners ( avanto or symphony , siemens , erlangen , germany ) using a torso phased - array coil with patient supine and free breathing .
the following sequences were obtained : spin echo ( se ) axial t1 - weighted imaging ( t1wi ) [ time of repetition ( tr )/ time of echo ( te ) , 340 ms / 10 ms ] ; fast low - angle shot ( flash ) 2d t1wi with fat saturation ( tr / te , 196 ms / 2.9 ms ) ; turbo spin echo ( tse ) t2 - weighted imaging ( t2wi ) with and without fat saturation ( tr / te , 8000 ms / 83 ms and 4000 ms / 98 ms ) respectively .
sagittal and coronal tse t2wi ( tr / te , 8000 ms / 98 ms ) were also obtained .
the contrast - enhanced flash 2d t1wi with fat saturation ( tr / te , 196 ms / 2.9 ms ) was performed in the axial , sagittal and coronal planes right after intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine ( gd - dtpa , magnevist ; bayer schering , guangzhou , china ) at a dose of 0.1 mmol / kg of body weight and a rate of 2 ml / s. the scanning parameters were as follows : 5 - mm slice thickness , 1.5 - mm gap , 256 x 256 matrix , 20 - 25 cm x 34 cm field of view and four excitations .
the scanning range was from the inferior pubic symphysis to the renal hilum and was extended beyond the dome of tumor in the cases with huge masses .
the mr images were reviewed independently by two radiologists who specialized in gynecological imaging .
their interpretations were arrived at by consensus .
the following features were evaluated : ( a ) laterality , shape and size ; ( b ) cystic or solid components ; ( c ) thickness of wall and septa ( considered thin when <= 3 mm and thick when > 3mm ) ; ( d ) vegetations ; ( e ) signal intensity ( the signal similar to inner , outer myometrium and fat was considered low , moderate and high , respectively ) ; ( f ) contrast - enhancement ( the enhancement of solid component less than or equal to that of innermyometrium , between inner and outer myometrium , and equal to or greater than outer myometrium was considered mild , moderate or obvious , respectively ) .
the predominant signal was taken to represent the tumor 's signal , where the tumor was heterogeneous .
pathological analysis histopathological examination was performed by a radiologist and a pathologist , both were familiar with or specialized in gynecological pathology .
after determining the shape and size of the tumors , the gross specimens were dissected into 1 to 5 cm sections .
the tumors were analyzed including : shape , size , architecture , the presence of loculus and the nature of the intracystic content ; thickness of wall and septa .
the specimens were fixed in 10 % formalin solution , embedded in paraffin , sectioned , stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) , immunohistochemical inhinbin - alpha , ema and cytokeratin 7 .
a correlation between imaging and histopathological findings was performed together by a pathologist and a radiologist .
results and discussion only one of five patients presented with deepening of the voice and increasing of facial hair .
three cases presented with abdominal swelling .
the remaining case was asymptomatic and found during the routine physical examination .
serum testosterone level ( normal , 0.15 - 0.5 ng / ml ) elevated in two cases , and ca125 level ( normal , < 35 u / ml ) elevated in one .
radical surgery was performed in two cases , unilateral salpingo - oophorectomy in one case , and cystectomy in the other two .
the clinical manifestations of five cases of slct are listed in table 1 .

mri findings of five cases of slct are summarized in table 2 .
four tumors occurred in left ovary and the remaining one in right ovary ; two tumors were solid with the round shape and demarcatedmargin ( figure 1 ) .
multiple small cysts were found in one of the solid tumors .
the signal intensities of solid masses were low on t1wi and moderate on t2wi .
three tumors were multilocular cystic ( 2 , 10 and 12 loculi respectively ) with irregularly thickened wall and septa , and one of them had solid area and mural nodules with a broad base .
the signal intensities of the solid area ( figure 2a ) and nodules were the same as those of the solid tumors .
the signal intensities of the cystic components were the same as those of the urine .
after administration of contrast medium , the cystic wall and septa ( figure 3b ) , solid area and nodules , and solid masses were enhanced intensely which was iso - to hyperintense to that of outer myometrium .
small amount of ascites were found in three cases .
however , no extension to the pelvic organs , peritoneal inplants and enlarged lymph nodes was observed .

( c ) grossly , the tumor shows an encapsulated cystic mass ( fluid has been removed ) with reddish solid area and yellowish nodules ( black arrow ) .
( d ) microscopically , leydig cells ( arrowhead ) are sparse in the background of sertoli cells , which arrange in closed tubules ( black arrow ) .
the sertoli cells have abundant vacuolated cytoplasm filled with lipid ( h & ex400 ) .
( e ) the sex cord areas stain strongly for alpha - inhibin ( alpha - inhibin stain x200 ) .

axial t2 - weighted image with fat saturation ( a ) shows a bilocular cystic mass with thickened septa and wall ( arrow ) , which are intensely enhanced ( b ) .
the macroscopic appearances confirmed the mri morphological findings ( figure 2c ) .
histopathologically , leydig cells had the eosinophilic cytoplasm , scattering in the background of numerous sertoli cells , some of which have abundant vacuolated cytoplasm filled with lipid ( figure 2d ) .
a few cords and poorly developed tubules of sertoli cells were found , with some atypia .
the immunohistochemical analysis showed that sex cord - stromal cells stained intensely positive for inhinbin - alpha and negative for the cytokeratin 7 receptors .
the mucinous components expressed strong cytoplasmic positivity for cytokeratin 7 .
slct are the most common virilizing ovarian tumors and originally named as arrhenoblastomas or androblastomas .
however , some tumors are nonfunctioning , and even estrogenic .
therefore , world health organization renamed them as " sertoli - leydig cell tumors " according to their histopathological features [ 7 ] .
young et al .
[ 2 ] reviewed the clinicopathological data of 207 patients with slct .
their ages ranged from 2 to 75 years ( average 25 years ) , with about 75 % of the patients being 30 years or younger and less than 10 % over 50 years ; about one - third of the patients presented an elevation of androgen or related symptoms and signs and most of the patients without hormonal effects complained abdominal swelling or pain .
similar findings had also been reported [ 8 - 11 ] .
the largest tumor in young et al . '
series was 51 cm in diameter ( average 13.5 cm ) and 97.5 % of patients were at figo stagei , 1.5 % at stage ii , and 1 % at stage iii .
tumors usually occured unilaterally , only 1.5 % involved both ovaries .
thirty - eight percent of the tumors were solid , 58 % solid and cystic , and 4 % cystic .
most of slct behave in a benign fashion with biologic behavior correlating with degree of differentiation and stage [ 2,12 ] .
in our series , mean age was 38.5 years .
the tumors were intermediately - differentiated and at stage i in all five cases .
pathologically , slct are divided into four subtypes : well - ( 11 %) , intermediately - ( 54 %) , and poorly - differentiated ( 13 %) and contained heterologous elements ( 22 %) .
heterologous elements are various , such as carcinoid , mesenchymal , and mucinous epithelial tissues with the commonest being gastrointestinal - types [ 13,14 ] .
retiform pattern presents in 15 % of slct , and is found only in intermediately and poorly differentiated slct , and often occurs in younger women [ 2,15,16 ] .
slct contain sertoli cells , leydig cells , gonadal stromal cells and heterologous cells in tumors with heterologous elements .
leydig cells scatter among numerous sertoli cells , which may arrange into open or closed tubules .
the sertoli cells may have intracytoplasmic lipids , which may explain the yellowish nodules inside encapsulated mass [ 6,8,17 ]. and the intracelluar lipid can not be detected by fat saturation .
immunohistochemical staining is positive for alpha - inhibin ( sex cord - stromal marker ) and positive for cytokeratin 7 for the mucinous elements [ 1 ] .
in our study , there were two solid and three cystic masses .
slct showed some mri features : the irregularly thickened wall and septa , the moderate signal intensity in the solid components on t2wi , which is accordance with previous literatures [ 6,17 ] , and the obvious enhancement of the solid components after administration of gd - dtpa .
azuma et al .
[ 5 ] reported one case of multilocular cystic slct , which demonstrated hyperintensity on t1wi and hypointensity on t2wi considering the hemorrhagic nature of the fluid .
in our series , however , the signal intensities of the cystic components were the same as those of the urine .
all five slct were misdiagnosed in preoperative mri in our series .
two solid slct were misdiagnosed as fibrothecoma .
the mild to moderate enhancement in the latter would be helpful in differentiating from slct .
in addition , solid slct should be distinguished from granulosa cell tumors and ovarian carcinomas which often have appearances of estrogen - producing or irregular necrosis .
three cystic tumors were misdiagnosed as cystadenoma .
the cystic slct shares the similar gross appearances with ovarian cystadenoma due in part to the mucinous heterologous elements [ 18 ] .
however , the signal intensity in different loculi of cystadenoma is frequently heterogeneous [ 19 ] .
the presence of intracystic nodules calls for the need of the differentiation of cystic slct from borderline / malignant serous or mucinous tumors .
in our case , the nodules are of broad base which is different from the narrow base of papillary projections in epithelial tumors [ 17 ] .
conclusions slct are rare and demonstrate variable mri morphological appearances , they should be considered in young female with virilization , especially in solid or multilocular cystic masses , with an irregularly thickened wall and septa , a moderate signal intensity on t2wi and an obvious enhancement in solid components .

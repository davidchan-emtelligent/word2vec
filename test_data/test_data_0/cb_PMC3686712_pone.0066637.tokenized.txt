allopurinol is a purine analogue that inhibits xanthine oxidase .
it is mainly used for the treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with gout or tumor lysis syndrome .
experience with allopurinol in pregnancy is scarce .
in 2011 , kozenko et al. reported on a child with multiple malformations after maternal treatment with allopurinol throughout pregnancy .
possible teratogenicity of allopurinol was proposed due to the similarity of the pattern of malformations in children with mycophenolate embryopathy .
a possible common mechanism of both drugs , i.e. disruption of purine synthesis , was discussed .
we report on the outcome of 31 prospectively ascertained pregnancies with allopurinol exposure at least during first trimester .
pregnancy outcomes were 2 spontaneous abortions , 2 elective terminations of pregnancy and 27 live born children .
the overall rate of major malformations ( 3.7 %) and of spontaneous abortions ( cumulative incidence 11 % , 95 % - ci 3 - 40 ) were both within the normal range .
however , there was one child with severe malformations including microphthalmia , cleft lip and palate , renal hypoplasia , low - set ears , hearing deficit , bilateral cryptorchidism , and micropenis .
the striking similarity of the anomalies in this child and the case described by kozenko et al. might be considered as a signal for teratogenicity .
thus , we would recommend caution with allopurinol treatment in the first trimester , until further data are available .
the study has been performed with financial support from the german federal institute for drugs and medical devices .
the funders had no role in study design , data collection and analysis , decision to publish , or preparation of the manuscript .
introduction allopurinol is a purin analogue that inhibits xanthine oxidase .
it is mainly used for the treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with gout or tumor lysis syndrome .
as these conditions are infrequent in women of childbearing age allopurinol use in pregnancy has rarely been observed .
the possible antioxidant function of allopurinol has recently led to an increasing discussion on extending treatment indications to cardiovascular disease [ 1 ] and pre - eclampsia [ 2 ] .
in addition , allopurinol is used as adjunct therapy in order to increase efficacy of thiopurines in inflammatory bowel disease , a condition frequently affecting women of childbearing age [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
a recent publication reported on normal pregnancy outcome after allopurinol treatment throughout pregnancy [ 5 ] .
on the other hand , possible teratogenicity of allopurinol had been proposed after observation of a child with multiple malformations after maternal treatment throughout pregnancy [ 6 ] .
so far , there are no prospective data on allopurinol use in pregnancy .
therefore , counseling of allopurinol is difficult .
we report the first case series of prospectively followed pregnancies exposed to allopurinol .
materials and methods ascertainment of cases and follow - up procedure the berlin institute for clinical teratology and drug risk assessment in pregnancy offers risk assessment to physicians , other health care providers ( hcp ) and pregnant women .
patient data are documented through the risk consultation .
usually , data are ascertained prospectively , i.e. neither the outcome of pregnancy nor the results of prenatal diagnostics are primarily known , but are ascertained at a later stage .
in retrospectively reported cases , the outcome of pregnancy is already known and has usually prompted the initial contact to our institute .
using structured questionnaires , all relevant data with respect to medications , exposures to other agents and / or diseases and course and outcome of pregnancy are documented with informed consent of the patient .
the following information is obtained : obstetric and medical history , family history , patient 's profession and education , treatment indications and details of exposures ( timing in pregnancy , duration , dose and concomitant medication , vitamins , in particular folic acid ) , assisted conception , inadvertent use of hormonal contraceptives during pregnancy , social or illicit drugs and smoking .
about 8 weeks after the expected date of delivery , information about complications during pregnancy ( i.e. infections , gestational diabetes , preeclampsia , etc. ) , details in case of pregnancy loss , gestational age at birth , sex , birth weight , length , head circumference , ph , and apgar scores and if applicable details of congenital anomalies and postnatal disorders during neonatal period are obtained .
for further details on the methodology see [ 7 ] .
ethics the study is based on observational data and was approved by the ethics committee of the charite - universitatsmedizin berlin , germany .
all patients were informed that their medical information will be stored and used for future scientific research .
in case they have contacted us directly they have provided us with a written consent .
in case their hcp have contacted us , the hcp confirm that their patients have agreed .
all our correspondences to patients and hcp contain information about our data handling and the patient 's rights .
study design prospectively ascertained pregnancies with maternal allopurinol exposure were identified from 1991 until june 2012 .
since the vulnerable phase for birth defects induced by teratogens is limited to the 1st trimester , only pregnancies with exposure to allopurinol at least between last menstrual period ( lmp ) and gestational week 12 were included in the study .
cases were included independent of treatment indication and exposure interval within the 1st trimester .
exposure to allopurinol may have lasted longer than week 12 .
the primary goal of the study was to determine the rate of major birth defects , defined as structural abnormalities of medical , surgical or cosmetic relevance induced during embryogenesis .
special emphasis was to further evaluate the teratogenic potential of allopurinol as proposed by kozenko et al .
[ 6 ] .
all birth defects were classified according to merks [ 8 ] and rasmussen [ 9 ] .
secondary endpoints of our study were the rates of miscarriage , stillbirth and preterm delivery (< 37 weeks ) .
weeks of pregnancy were defined by lmp .
birth weight was adjusted to gestational age at birth and sex .
percentile categories were calculated according to voigt et al .
[ 10 ] .
statistical analysis the birth defect rate was calculated using live births plus pregnancy losses with pathology .
for calculating rates of major birth defects , genetic or chromosomal disorders were excluded .
because of the limited number of exposed cases we did not use a control group .
since crude rates of pregnancy outcome based on observational data are biased we calculated cumulative incidences of spontaneous abortions , elective terminations of pregnancy ( etop ) and live births .
for further details of this method see meister et al .
[ 11 ] .
results maternal characteristics from january 1991 until june 2012 a total of 38 pregnancies with maternal allopurinol exposure and complete follow - up were identified ( fig. 1 ) .
thirty - one pregnancies with first trimester exposure fulfilled the criteria of being prospectively ascertained and were included in this study for evaluation of pregnancy outcome .
one pregnancy with uneventful outcome after long term allopurinol exposure was reported retrospectively and was therefore not considered for relative risk calculation .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0066637.g001 figure 1 flow chart on cases of allopurinol exposure and pregnancy ( fup = follow - up ) .
treatment indications were hyperuricemia ( n = 18 ) , gout ( n = 4 ) , renal diseases ( n = 4 ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( n = 2 ) , and systemic lupus erythematosus , chronic myeloic leucemia , hyperoxaluria ( each n = 1 ) .
median dosage of allopurinol was 100 mg ( range 50 - 600 mg / d , interquartile range ( iqr ) 100 - 300 mg / d ) .
treatment with allopurinol was initiated before pregnancy in 27 women .
four patients started allopurinol during 1st trimester .
15 / 31 patients stopped therapy before week 8 after lmp , only 2 women continued treatment with allopurinol throughout pregnancy ( pregnancies # 30 and # 31 ) ( see fig. 2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0066637.g002 figure 2 diagram summarizing pregnancy interval of allopurinol exposure , week at first contact and outcome of 31 prospectively ascertained pregnancies .
except for one mother treated with mycophenolate until week 6 + 6 after kidney transplantation ( pregnancy # 12 ) and one mother with cyclophosphamide ( single dose at week 7 + 3 , pregnancy # 26 ) there were no patients with teratogenic co - medication .
on the other hand only two women were exclusively exposed to allopurinol ( pregnancies # 3 and # 24 ) , indicating the high co - morbidity of our patients .
twelve women were treated for hypertension , nine of whom needed two or more antihypertensives , including methyldopa ( n = 5 ) , ace - inhibitors or at ii receptor inhibitors ( n = 7 ) , beta - blockers ( n = 7 ) , diuretics ( n = 8 ) , monoxidine ( n = 2 ) , dihydralazine ( n = 1 ) , and clonidine ( n = 1 ) .
in addition , three women used diuretics for treatment of edema .
there were three women with type 2 diabetes , two women developed gestational diabetes .
interestingly , three women were on tuberculostatic therapy including pyrazinamide , well known to reduce excretion of uric acid .
further details of maternal characteristics are summarized in table 1 .
information on bmi was available from 2005 onwards .
in seven of 14 patients the bmi was > 35 ( see also table 1 ) .

first contacts to our institute were initiated via gynaecologists ( n = 17 ) , clinical geneticists ( n = 6 ) , other physicians ( n = 4 ) and patients ( n = 4 ) .
pregnancy outcome of the 31 pregnancies exposed to allopurinol , there were 2 spontaneous abortions , 2 elective terminations of pregnancy and 27 live births ( see fig. 2 ) .
one spontaneous abortion ( pregnancy # 12 ) occurred in a patient after renal transplantation receiving several co - medications including mycophenolate , ciclosporine and various antihypertensives .
another spontaneous abortion occurred at week 20 in a patient with hypertension ( pregnancy # 6 ) treated with valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide .
chorioamnionitis was diagnosed .
no malformations were found in the fetus .
two pregnancies were terminated , both for personal reasons ( pregnancy # 9 and # 28 , see fig. 2 ) .
cumulative incidences were 11 % ( 95 % - ci 3 - 40 ) for spontaneous abortions and 9 % ( 95 % - ci 2 - 32 ) for etops ( fig. 3 ) .

the cumulative incidence for live births was 80 % ( 95 % - ci 60 - 94 ) ( fig. 3 ) .
there were 16 males and 11 females born alive .
five children ( 19 %) were born premature ( gestational age at birth < 37 weeks ) .
caesarean section was performed in nearly half of the live births ( 13 / 27 ) .
birth weights were within normal range after correction for sex and gestational age ( see table 2 and fig. 4 ) .
pre - eclampsia had been diagnosed in five pregnancies all exposed during 1st trimester until latest week 14 and a hellp - syndrome in one exposed throughout pregnancy (# 30 ) .

the rate of major malformations in our cohort was 3.7 % ( 1 / 27 ) .
discussion gout , hyperuricemia and other treatment indications for allopurinol are rare in women of reproductive age .
gout usually improves in pregnancy and attacks recommence after birth , due to the decreased estrogen levels [ 12 ] .
during 2nd and 3rd trimester allopurinol has been described for tumor lysis syndrome [ 13 ] .
gulmezoglu et al .
[ 14 ] reported its safe use in a trial including 27 women in the 3rd trimester to evaluate the antioxidant potency of allopurinol for the prevention of pre - eclampsia .
to our knowledge , first trimester exposure of allopurinol has only been reported in a few case reports including 4 normal outcomes [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] and a recent report [ 6 ] on a child with multiple malformations including microphthalmia , cleft lip and palate , microtia and diaphragmatic hernia after maternal allopurinol exposure throughout pregnancy ( summary of features in table 4 ) .
the authors proposed a possible teratogenic effect and noted the similarities to the mycophenolate embryopathy based on similar pathways , i.e. the interruption of purine biosynthesis .
data from animal studies indicate teratogenic effects ( facial clefts and minor skeletal defects ) of allopurinol at high doses in mice [ 17 ] , but not in rats and other rodents [ 18 ] .
we present the first prospective case series covering 31 pregnancies with 1st trimester allopurinol exposure .
the rate of spontaneous abortions in our case series was in the expected range of 13 - 21 % [ 19 ] as was the rate of major malformations ( 3.7 %) based on one infant with multiple malformations .
the infant 's phenotype resembles the case report of kozenko et al .
[ 6 ] .
in our infant a fraser syndrome had been suspected initially but was not confirmed .
the karyotype was normal , but further genetic analysis like array - cgh was declined by the parents .
therefore , we cannot exclude a genetic origin of this rare malformation syndrome .
the mother of our patient had hyperoxaluria , a severe renal disease .
in addition to allopurinol , she was treated with hydrochlorothiazide and pyridoxine , both drugs not considered as teratogens based on animal studies and human data [ 20 ] .
pyridoxine is widely used for the treatment of hyperemesis in early pregnancy [ 21 ] .
the mother of the patient reported by kozenko et al .
[ 6 ] received multivitamins and methyldopa , the latter being the first line therapy for hypertension in pregnancy and not suspected as a teratogen .
thus , our patient and the patient reported by kozenko were not exposed to any teratogenic co - medication in pregnancy that might explain the observed malformations .
furthermore , both co - medications are not directly involved in purine metabolism .
our case series represents women with either multiple risk factors or severe illness , known to be associated with an increased risk of poor pregnancy outcomes .
the high rate of nearly 20 % prematurity in our case series may be explained by maternal co - morbidity .
to our surprise we did not observe lower birth weights after adjustment for sex and gestational age , which might have been expected in cases of hypertension or autoimmune diseases in pregnancy .
the high number of obese women might have compensated this effect , as new - borns of obese mothers tend to be heavier than new - borns of normal weight women [ 22 ] .
obesity and hypertension were present in the majority of our women .
these conditions are risk factors for hyperuricemia or gout in premenopausal women [ 23 ] .
so far , no substantial malformation risk has been ascribed to the underlying maternal diseases in our cohort such as hypertension , systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases [ 24 ] [ 25 ] .
in contrast to other metabolic diseases , such as phenylketonuria , hyperoxaluria has not been suspected to cause teratogenic effects .
there are several reports on normal pregnancy outcomes in women with hyperoxaluria [ 26 ] .
however , a high bmi is associated with an increased malformation risk [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] .
although being the largest case series so far , our study is still limited by the small sample size. with only 2 women exposed in the 2nd and 3rd trimester , we are not able to examine any effect on pregnancy outcome of allopurinol exposure after the first trimester .
the surprisingly high rate of 6 / 31 patients with pre - eclampsia or hellp syndrome in our cohort may be explained by the underlying conditions of the women , a protective effect of allopurinol on pre - eclampsia as postulated by gulmezoglu et al .
[ 14 ] cannot be confirmed by our data .
the important strength and advantage of our study is the prospective character of data ascertainment , allowing relative risk calculations for adverse pregnancy outcomces .
the similarity of rare malformations in the infants reported by kozenko [ 6 ] and our study ( case # 31 ) requires further exploration by case - control studies to confirm or reject the hypothesis of allopurinol teratogenicity [ 29 ] [ 30 ] .
conclusion allopurinol has been used for over 40 years without being suspected for teratogenicity in humans .
this is corroborated by the overall malformation rate in our case series lying in the expected range .
however , the presence of two infants with a similar rare combination of malformations including microphthalmia , cleft lip and palate , and microtia after first trimester exposure to allopurinol is striking and might be considered as a signal for teratogenicity [ 29 ] .
thus , we would recommend caution with allopurinol in the first trimester , unless further data are available .
in case of inadvertent exposure during 1st trimester high resolution ultrasound is recommended to confirm normal fetal development .
we would like to thank all contributing physicians , their patients and families as well as our colleagues in the berlin tis .

background we aimed to evaluate the risk factors of recurrence after stent ( s ) - assisted coiling ( sac ) of intracranial vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms ( vbdas ) based on 168 consecutive patients .
methods between january 2011 and december 2015 , 168 consecutive patients with 170 intracranial vbdas , which were treated by sac , were recruited from four high - volume centers .
we used multivariate logistic regression to examine factors that affected recurrence of vbdas .
results the mean duration of clinical follow - up of the 168 patients was 7.81 months ( range , 3 - 24 months ). of the 168 patients , 4 ( 2.38 %) suffered from intraoperative complications and 16 ( 9.52 %) had postoperative complications .
two ( 1.19 %) had severe disability .
imaging follow - up was available for 168 patients ( 170 vbdas ) , with a mean duration 7.81 months , and 24 ( 14.12 %) cases of recurrence of aneurysms were noted .
aneurysm size and metal coverage of stent ( s ) at the neck were independent predictors of recurrence after sac by logistic regression analysis .
conclusion this multicenter cohort study shows that aneurysm size and the metal coverage of stent ( s ) at aneurysmal neck are independent factors associated with recurrence of vbdas after sac .
intracranial aneurysms dissection vertebrobasilar artery endovascular treatment recurrence national natural science foundation of china10.13039 / 50110000180981301003 , 81301193 , 81371315 , 81471167 , 81671139 , 81220108007 introduction vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms ( vbdas ) are uncommon lesions of which treatment is challenging and represent 3.3 % of all intracranial aneurysms ( 1 ) .
vbdas can cause subarachnoid hemorrhage ( sah ) and posterior circulation ischemia with high morbidity and mortality ( 2 - 5 ) .
endovascular treatment , including deconstructive and reconstructive treatment ( stent - assisted coiling [ sac ] or stent only ) , has emerged as a major therapeutic option for vbdas ( 6 ) .
however , with the increasing number of cases being treated , recurrence of vbdas after sac is gradually being found ( 2 , 7 - 9 ) .
identifying risk factors of vbda recurrence after sac is an important issue and would be helpful for endovascular treatment .
the raymond scale , the vbda size , and the branch artery involved are risk factors of vbda recurrence after sac ( 10 - 14 ) .
however , most authors of previous studies on vbdas have made their conclusion based on single - center data and limited cases .
this study aimed to identify risk factors of recurrence after sac in a large multicenter sample of patients with vbdas .
in this retrospective study , we examined baseline information , the details of endovascular treatment , and the clinical outcomes in 168 consecutive patients with vbdas at four high - volume medical centers .
materials and methods the retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and carried out in four research units .
all included patients or their relatives provided written informed consents during hospitalization and the privacy of the patients were strictly protected .
selection of patients and the population between january 2011 and december 2015 , endovascularly treated dissecting aneurysms at four high - volume centers were included in an online retrospective multicenter database .
the medical records and image data of each patient were reviewed .
the vbdas were diagnosed by digital subtraction angiography ( dsa ) , computed tomographic angiography , magnetic resonance angiography , and magnetic resonance imaging were used to diagnose the vbdas .
ultimately , 168 consecutive patients with 170 intracranial vbdas , which were treated by sac , were included in this study .
the exclusion criteria included the following : ( 1 ) a history of traumatic and iatrogenic injury ; ( 2 ) a history of deconstructive treatment ; ( 3 ) a history of reconstructive treatment with sole stent ( s ) ; ( 4 ) untreated vbdas ; and ( 5 ) loss to any clinical follow - up. the following factors were analyzed : age , sex , cigarette smoking , alcohol intake , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , aneurysm size , complications , immediate angiography results , follow - up interval , and angiographic and clinical follow - up results ( table 1 ) .

endovascular procedures endovascular procedures were performed under general anesthesia .
for patients with acutely ruptured vbdas , antiplatelet medication ( 300 mg aspirin and 300 mg clopidogrel ) was preloaded orally or through a stomach tube 2 h before the procedure .
for patients with unruptured vbdas , dual antiplatelet ( 75 mg of clopidogrel and 100 mg of aspirin ) therapy was administered each day for 3 days .
all of the patients received systemic intravenous heparin after the guiding catheter was placed .
self - expanding neurovascular stents were used for reconstruction of the entire dissected segment and coils were used to embolize the aneurysm .
dual antiplatelet agents ( 75 mg clopidogrel and 100 mg aspirin ) were provided orally once daily for 6 weeks after the endovascular procedure .
following this therapy , 100 mg aspirin was continued for the next 6 months .
materials various types of detachable coils , such as the matrix coil ( cordis , new brunswick , nj , usa ) and microplex coil ( microvention , aliso viejo , ca , usa ) , were used in endovascular treatment .
self - expanding neurovascular stents , such as enterprise ( cordis neurovascular , miami , fl , usa ) , solitaire ab ( ev3 , irvine , ca , usa ) , and low - profile visualized intraluminal support ( microvention terumo , tustin , ca , usa ) stents , were used to reconstruct the dissected artery .
metal coverage of the stents was estimated by stent type and diameter of the parent artery ( 15 , 16 ) .
for multiple stents , the metal coverage was acquired by adding the metal coverage of deployed stents together .
angiography assessment digital subtraction angiography findings were reviewed by two experienced interventional neuroradiologists .
endovascular treatment details , including immediate obliteration grade , type of stents used , and important branches involved , were recorded , as were angiographic follow - up outcomes .
angiographic results were evaluated with the raymond grading system as follows : grade 1 , complete occlusion ; grade 2 , residual neck ; and grade 3 , residual aneurysm ( 17 ) .
the important vessel branches were the posterior inferior cerebellar artery , anterior inferior cerebellar artery , superior cerebellar artery , posterior cerebral artery , anterior spinal artery , or other large perforating arteries .
follow - up angiographic follow - up was performed with dsa at approximately 6 months .
the patient was then with an mra or cta followed up annually .
angiographic recurrence means a substantial increase in the contrast medium - filled portion of the dissecting aneurysm compared with the control angiogram just after the initial treatment .
the patient clinical outcome was measured by the modified rankin scale ( mrs ) score at follow - up visits or by a telephone interview .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics version 22.0 .
the one - sample kolmogorov - smirnov test was used to test the normality of the data distribution for quantitative data .
data are expressed as the mean +/ - sd or median ( quartile ) .
the groups were compared using the independent sample t - test , mann - whitney u test , or the chi2 test appropriately .
univariate analysis was performed to determine the association of angiographic or clinical results with other factors .
then , variables with p < 0.20 in univariate analyses ( initial raymond grade , aneurysm size , and the metal coverage of stent ( s ) at aneurysm neck ) were candidates for inclusion in multivariate logistic regression analysis .
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results a total of 168 patients ( 52 women and 176 men ) with 170 vbdas were enrolled in this study .
two patients had two aneurysms .
the mean age of the patients was 51.92 +/ - 11.01 years .
endovascular treatment complications of the 168 patients ( 170 aneurysms ) , 4 ( 2.38 %) suffered from intraoperative complications , and 16 ( 9.52 %) had postoperative complications ( table 2 ) .
the four intraoperative complications included stent thrombosis in one , aneurysm rupture in one , serious vertebral artery vasospasm in one , and iatrogenic dissection of the vertebral artery in one patient .
the 16 postoperative complications included symptomatic cerebral infarction in seven , pneumonia in three , rupture of the vbdas after endovascular treatment in two , asymptomatic stent thrombosis in two , and hydrocephalus in two patients .

at the last follow - up , 157 patients had an mrs of 0 or 1 , nine patients had an mrs of 2 to 4 , and two patients had an mrs of 5 or 6 .
two ( 1.19 %) patients had severe disability .
results of radiographic follow - up and risk factors for aneurysm recurrence angiographic follow - up was available for all 168 patients ( 170 vbdas ) , with a mean duration of 7.81 months ( range , 3 - 24 months ) , and 24 ( 14.12 %) aneurysm recurrences were observed .
there were 146 vbdas with residual neck or residual aneurysm ( raymond scale grade 2 or 3 ) after sac treatment .
according to the follow - up dsa images , the residual neck or residual aneurysm improved or kept stable in 124 vbdas and worsen in 22 vbdas .
the recurrence rate and the risk factors based on the 170 aneurysms are shown in table 3 .
univariate analysis showed that initial raymond grade , aneurysm size , and metal coverage of the stent ( s ) at the aneurysm neck were related to the recurrence rate .
larger aneurysm size [ odds ratio ( or ) = 1.098 ; 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) , 1.034 - 1.166 ; p = 0.002 ] and the lower metal coverage of stent ( s ) at neck ( or = 0.914 ; 95 % ci , 0.850 - 0.982 ; p = 0.014 ) were independent predictors of recurrence in the logistic regression analysis ( figures 1 and 2 ) .

discussion the endovascular method has become the primary treatment for intracranial vbdas ( 1 , 18 ) .
however , the relatively high recurrence rate of vbdas is a major problem after reconstructive treatment ( 19 ) .
in previous studies , posterior circulation dissecting aneurysms have a higher recanalization rate than anterior circulation dissecting aneurysms ( 33 versus 6 %) and intracranial dissecting aneurysms recur at a higher rate ( 18 %) than saccular aneurysms ( 8.3 - 14 %) ( 19 - 23 ) .
this may be because dissection in posterior was prone to form aneurysm and dissecting aneurysm have more complicated anatomic configurations , such as pearl - and - string configurations , intramural hematomas , and intimal flap which increase the difficulty of treatment ( 22 - 24 ) .
there have been many small case series of treating vbdas with endovascular methods , but few series have mainly focused on recurrence of vbdas after reconstructive treatment ( 25 , 26 ) .
this is because the morbidity of dissecting aneurysms is lower than that of saccular aneurysms ( 1 ) .
additionally , the internal structure of dissecting aneurysms is more complicated than that of a saccular aneurysm , making computer modeling and computer fluid hemodynamic analysis more difficult .
in this study , we examined 168 patients with 170 vbdas who were treated by sac at four high - volume medical centers , with the aim of identifying risk factors of recurrence of vbdas after sac .
we found that larger aneurysm size and the lower metal coverage of stent ( s ) were associated with recurrence of vbdas after sac .
to our knowledge , the present case series is the largest series of vbdas with angiographic follow - up treated by sac .
aneurysm size was an independent predictor of progression of aneurysms in our study , with larger aneurysms associated with a higher progression rate .
this finding has been reported by many authors ( 11 - 13 ) .
large vbdas , which are thought to develop from small , unstable vbdas , might be even less stable than small vbdas .
additionally , large vbdas generally have a longer dissecting segment and aneurysm neck , making them difficult to completely occlude .
these findings might explain the association between larger aneurysms and higher progression rates after reconstructive endovascular treatment .
the obliteration grade of the aneurysm is thought to be an important factor for a low rate of occurrence of aneurysms after reconstructive endovascular treatment ( 13 ) .
we always strive to achieve high coil packing density of the aneurysm in our clinical practice .
the limited number of cases from a single institute might explain why this factor was excluded from the risk factors for progression of aneurysms in multivariate logistic analysis .
metal coverage of the stent ( s ) at the neck was also an important predictor of vbda recurrence in our study , with a higher metal coverage rate associated with a lower recurrence rate .
this finding is consistent with many studies , which showed that an increase in the stent metal coverage rate or stent quantity can reduce the aneurysm recurrence rate .
in zhao et al. study , overlapping stents which has a higher metal coverage of stents was associated with lower recurrent rate than single stent ( 19 ) .
an increase in metal coverage of stent ( s ) at the neck can reduce the recurrence rate because of the following reasons .
an increase in metal coverage of stent ( s ) at the neck can reduce the blood impact , which can prevent coil mass compaction .
additionally , an increase in metal coverage of stent ( s ) at the neck can decrease intra - aneurismal wall shear stress , which prevents aneurismal growth ( 27 , 28 ) .
inspiration can be acquired from that higher metal coverage of stent ( s ) at neck could reduce the vbdas recurrence rate .
for a lesion that is difficult to completely occlude , an increase in metal coverage of the stent ( s ) at the neck ( overlapping stents or a stent with lower porosity ) may be an alternative for preventing recurrence of vbdas .
this viewpoint has been well documented in flow diverter devices ( 29 ) .
however , a flow diverter stent was not used in this study because the china food and drug administration have not yet approved its application in the posterior cerebral circulation .
additionally , we have only had initial experience of application of this stent in the anterior circulation .
there are some limitations to this series , such as limited number of cases , the retrospective design , different interventional materials used , and patient selection bias .
moreover , it is very difficult to get exact values of metal coverage in clinical practice .
conclusion this multicenter cohort study indicated that aneurysm size and the metal coverage of stent ( s ) at aneurysmal neck were independent factors associated with recurrence of vbdas after sac .

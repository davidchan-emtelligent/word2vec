analyzing the connectivity of neuronal networks , based on functional brain imaging data , has yielded new insight into brain circuitry , bringing functional and effective networks into the focus of interest for understanding complex neurological and psychiatric disorders .
however , the analysis of network changes , based on the activity of individual neurons , is hindered by the lack of suitable meaningful and reproducible methodologies .
here , we used calcium imaging , statistical spike time analysis and a powerful classification model to reconstruct effective networks of primary rat hippocampal neurons in vitro .
this method enables the calculation of network parameters , such as propagation probability , path length , and clustering behavior through the measurement of synaptic activity at the single - cell level , thus providing a fuller understanding of how changes at single synapses translate to an entire population of neurons .
we demonstrate that our methodology can detect the known effects of drug - induced neuronal inactivity and can be used to investigate the extensive rewiring processes affecting population - wide connectivity patterns after periods of induced neuronal inactivity .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction the effects of drug - induced silencing of neuronal activity on the morphology and activity of single synapses have been studied for decades using the voltage - gated sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin ( ttx ) 1 - 4 .
one of the most prominent findings : a strong increase in synaptic excitability1 - 4 .
understanding the consequences of neuronal inactivity has furthered our understanding of synaptic architecture and function over the years and permitted the discovery of activity - independent synaptic processes .
despite hebbian rules for the use - dependent maintenance of synapses , prolonged inactivity during ttx - treatment induces the expression of additional postsynaptic glutamate receptors5,6 and the enlargement postsynaptic densities7 .
presynaptically , ttx - induced synaptic inactivity induces growth of so - called active zones , characterized by larger numbers of docked vesicles , increased spontaneous release rates , and increases in the number of vesicles released upon a stimulus7 .
such alterations have been observed in the pathogenesis of tardive dyskinesia8 , glaucoma9 , neuropathic pain10,11 , and drug addiction12 - 14 and withdrawal15,16 .
however , it remains unclear whether and how modifications at individual synapses influence the interplay of multiple neurons across a signaling network .
networks of neurons are studied across many different scales and are generally classified as anatomical , functional , or effective networks depending on the kind of relationship between network nodes that is described by the network edges17 .
anatomical networks describe the physical connections between brain regions or single cells , as shown for example by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) 18 - 20 , or manual tracings of electron microscopy images21 - 24 .
functional networks describe brain regions or cells that are simultaneously active during resting states25,26 or a specific task27,28 as for example shown by functional mri , electroencephalography29,30 , or magnetoencephalography31,32 .
correlation between time series of the network nodes are used to derive functional networks .
effective networks describe the transmission of information among brain regions or cells as shown for example by multi - electrode array recordings33 - 35 , multi - electrode patch clamping36 , and in vitro 37 and in vivo 38 calcium imaging .
causal relations between time series of the network nodes are used to derive effective networks .
on the level of single cells , effective networks represent the actual propagation of action potentials .
they are the resulting information processing landscape based on synaptic ( e.g. post - synaptic excitability ) and cellular ( e.g. dendritic spine density ) characteristics .
while the existence of an effective connection between neurons requires at least one synaptic connection between then , the modification of effective connection strength or the loss of a connection may occur independent of synapse formation and loss : synaptic excitability , size of the active zone , number of synaptic vesicles and post - synaptic receptor density are only some of the many factors that add up to the effective strength of a connection .
how the network interplay of neurons and brain regions is affected in pathological states has become a focus of basic research .
for example , altered functional connectivity of brain regions has been reported in the context of alzheimer 's disease and other types of dementia39 , and cognitive improvement in alzheimer 's disease is correlated with a recovery of functional connectivity between the hippocampus and other brain regions40 .
a recent study also shows that amyloid beta peptides , the main components of plaques found in the brains of patients with alzheimer 's disease , directly modulate neuronal network activity41 .
furthermore , functional connectivity throughout the brain is impaired in parkinson 's disease42 , schizophrenia43 and major depressive disorder44 - 46 .
effective connectivity has been investigated in the context of epilepsy35,47 and sanfilippo syndrome48 .
although previous studies on neuronal silencing have described anatomical changes at the level of single synapses , research on population - wide changes in functional or effective connectivity among neurons has been hindered by the lack of a suitable method of network reconstruction .
in the past decade , however , several powerful algorithms , such as mutual information49 , joint entropy50 , transfer entropy51 , and generalized transfer entropy37 , have been proposed , which can be used to investigate neuronal spike time series and to detect correlations between pairs of them .
here , to assess the effects of neuronal silencing on the connectivity of a neuronal network , we developed a method of reconstructing effective connectivity in vitro based on statistical spike time analysis of calcium imaging data using a combination of several powerful algorithms and a machine learning approach for the prediction of interconnected neurons .
results neuronal cultures are silenced with tetrodotoxin we first tested whether the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin ( ttx ) can silence synaptic activity and thus artificially induce effects of neuronal silencing .
we measured the intensity of the fluorescence response upon electrical stimulation of fluo - 4 loaded neurons perfused with imaging buffer supplemented with 500 nm or 1 microm ttx ( fig. 1a,b ) .
the average neuronal response amplitude upon 5 instances of electrical stimulation was reduced to 0.6 % of controls +/ - 0.4 % of controls ( sd ) during perfusion with 500 nm ttx and to 0.1 % of controls +/ - 0.5 % of controls ( sd ) during perfusion with 1 microm ttx ( fig. 1 ) .
these results demonstrate that ttx causes synaptic silencing .

similar to those in the connectivity experiments , the cultures were recorded at age div 14 .
to analyze effective connectivity , the culture medium of primary rat hippocampal neurons was supplemented with 500 nm ttx or 1 microm ttx for 2 days or 1 microm ttx for 6 days7 , and in control cultures the medium was supplemented with respective volumes of the solvent sterile water for the same durations .
after incubation , neuronal activity was recorded via calcium imaging ( fig. 2a ) and subjected to data processing ( fig. 2b ) .
we performed 60 simulations for training and 840 simulations for testing of the classification model , and we recorded and analyzed a total of 75 experiments across the five treatment groups ( table 1 ) .

the panels show network plots with color - coded number of incoming connections ( in degree ) and connection strength ( weight ) .
connection strength is represented by thin , light arrows if low and thick , dark arrows if high .
the treatment of neuronal cultures with 500 nm ttx or 1 microm ttx for two or six days yielded effective networks with more connections and higher connection strengths .
scale bars = 100 microm .
tetrodotoxin treatment has no effect on the physical distribution of neurons in culture or their viability imaged cells were on average 522 microm apart from each another , with no difference in distance between connected and unconnected cell pairs .
also , the strength of formed connections was independent of the connection distance ( supplementary figure s1 ) .
as expected52 , dissociated hippocampal neurons connected with negative assortativity in all treatment groups ( supplementary figure s2 ) .
the viability of the neuronal cultures did not suffer from the ttx treatment compared to controls ( supplementary figure s3 ) .
after neuronal silencing the effective connection strength between neurons is increased we set out to test , if - additional to the molecular and cellular mechanisms of increased synapse size , vesicular release probability , and neuronal excitability after neuronal inactivity7 - there is also an increase in effective connection strength in the neuronal cultures .
using statistical spike time analysis to reconstruct effective connectivity , we examined the probability of propagation of action potentials from one cell to another across the culture ( fig. 4a,b ) .
we found that ttx - induced silencing of neuronal activity for 2 or 6 days increased the propagation probability by approximately 2 - fold ( fig. 4c ) , suggesting that synaptic modifications , such as increased vesicular release probability translate into stronger connections between cells on a population level .

neuronal cultures undergo rewiring during activity silencing when analyzing the structure of the neuronal networks , it appeared not only that the strength of connections between cells was increased but also that the network contained more connections .
an additional connection can be established by a synapse formation between two neurons that were not previously synaptically connected .
the strengthening of a connection however can be established also by the formation of additional synapses between already connected neurons or by a strengthening of already existing synapses between the two cells .
more connections in a network can be quantified in different ways : one parameter is the connectivity degree , which is the number of effective connections normalized to the number of cells in the network .
another parameter , the clustering coefficient , provides information about the distribution of connections .
high clustering coefficients appear in networks , in which a cell 's connection partners are also tightly connected with each other ( fig. 5a,b ) .
we found that ttx - induced silencing of neuronal activity for 2 or 6 days approximately doubled both the connectivity degree and the clustering coefficient ( fig. 5c,d ) .

the in - degree - the number of incoming connections - of each node is color - coded .
( c ) after ttx treatment the connectivity degree was significantly increased ( control ( 2 days ) vs. 500 nm ttx ( 2 days ) : p = 0.021 , control ( 2 days ) vs. 1 microm ttx ( 2 days ) : p < 0.001 , control ( 6 days ) vs. 1 microm ttx ( 6 days ) : p = 0.010 , two - sided t - tests ) .
( d ) the clustering coefficient was significantly increased after ttx - induced silencing ( control ( 2 days ) vs. 500 nm ttx ( 2 days ) : p = 0.003 , control ( 2 days ) vs. 1 microm ttx ( 2 days ) : p = 0.008 , control ( 6 days ) vs. 1 microm ttx ( 6 days ) : p < 0.001 , two - sided t - tests ) .
( e ) the already low characteristic path length was not significantly lowered after 500 nm or 1 microm ttx treatment for 2 days but after six days of 1 microm ttx treatment ( control ( 2 days ) vs. 500 nm ttx ( 2 days ) : p = 0.232 , control ( 2 days ) vs. 1 microm ttx ( 2 days ) : p = 0.364 , control ( 6 days ) vs. 1 microm ttx ( 6 days ) : p = 0.027 , two - sided t - tests ) .
( f ) after ttx - induced silencing the characteristic path length of the weighted network , which is a combined measure of connection number and connection strength was significantly reduced ( control ( 2 days ) vs. 500 nm ttx ( 2 days ) : p = 0.032 , control ( 2 days ) vs. 1 microm ttx ( 2 days ) : p = 0.044 , control ( 6 days ) vs. 1 microm ttx ( 6 days ) : p < 0.001 , two - sided t - tests ) .
numbers of experiments : control ( 2 days ) : 11 , control ( 6 days ) : 18 , 500 nm ttx ( 2 days ) : 16 , 1 microm ttx ( 2 days ) : 13 , 1 microm ttx ( 6 days ) : 17 .
the boxes extend from the 25th to the 75th percentiles .
the median and mean are shown as horizontal lines and crosses , respectively .
the whiskers show the range of values .
a third way to characterize the number of connections of a network is the characteristic path length , which describes the average distance between two cells in a network ( with " distance " being defined as the sum of intermediate steps in the shortest path between cells ) .
in a network with many connections , paths between two cells tend to be relatively direct , resulting in a short characteristic path length .
in a more sparsely connected network , however , the most direct path between two cells requires a number of intermediate steps , resulting in a longer characteristic path length .
details and formulas to calculate the topology measures can be found in the supplementary methods .
this characteristic path length of the control networks were 2.02 ( mean of 2 day controls +/ - 0.28 standard deviation ) and 2.19 ( mean of 6 day controls +/ - 0.50 standard deviation ) , which indicates a network in which almost every cell is directly connected to every other cell ( characteristic path length of 1 ) .
the additional connections in ttx treated cultures as seen in the connectivity degree did form at sites in the network that only slightly decreased the characteristic path length ( fig. 5e ) .
when investigating effective ( or functional ) networks one can also calculate the weighted characteristic path length53 .
this measure represents also the sum of intermediate steps of the shortest paths in the network but each intermediate connection is weighted by the respective connections strength .
the weighted characteristic path length represents a combined measure of connection number and connection strengths .
we found that ttx - induced silencing of neuronal activity for 2 or 6 days reduced the weighted characteristic path length by approximately half ( fig. 5f ) , demonstrating the extent of rewiring and connection strengthening during neuronal silencing .
transmission efficiency is enhanced in tetrodotoxin treated neuronal cultures using the method of reconstructing the effective network of an entire population of neurons , we observed stronger connections and an increased number of connections after the silencing , resulting in a network twice as dense with effective connections as its original state .
the outcome of these two processes can be quantified as the signal transmission efficiency across the network53 ( fig. 6a,b ) .
this measure describes how the combination of number of connections and their individual strengths combine to form the actual information processing landscape of the network .
we found that the combination of both silencing effects boosted the global transmission efficiency by nearly 4 - fold ( fig. 6c ) .
such a potentiation of synaptic communication in previously silenced neuronal cultures may most likely be an effect of increased action potential propagation probability and possibly the growth of new connections .

the in - degree - the number of incoming connections - of each node is color - coded .
( c ) after ttx treatment ge was significantly enhanced ( control ( 2 days ) vs. 500 nm ttx ( 2 days ) : p = 0.007 , control ( 2 days ) vs. 1 microm ttx ( 2 days ) : p = 0.027 , control ( 6 days ) vs. 1 microm ttx ( 6 days ) : p < 0.001 , two - sided t - tests ) .
numbers of experiments : control ( 2 days ) : 11 , control ( 6 days ) : 18 , 500 nm ttx ( 2 days ) : 16 , 1 microm ttx ( 2 days ) : 13 , 1 microm ttx ( 6 days ) : 17 .
the boxes extend from the 25th to the 75th percentiles .
the median and mean are shown as horizontal lines and crosses , respectively .
the whiskers show the range of values .
taken together , these results show that the silencing of neuronal activity not only increases action potential propagation across connections but also leads to the formation of many additional effective connections .
discussion our observations confirm previous reports that the silencing of neuronal activity over a short time span potentiates the strength of synaptic connections .
however , whereas earlier studies only show that neuronal inactivity induces changes at the level of individual synapses , including increased synapse size and postsynaptic receptor concentration5 - 7 , our study demonstrates that neuronal silencing increases action potential propagation probability across an entire neuronal network .
in addition , we discovered reduced neuronal activity not only increased synaptic sensitivity7 but also a largely increased number of connections throughout the network .
the ability to detect differences in connectivity patterns is an important first step towards understanding how unused neurons become reconnected , such as during the recovery of stroke patients .
research in this area has generated an extensive body of evidence supporting the hypothesis that recovery from stroke reflects the recovery of connectivity of " silenced " brain regions54 - 59 .
a deeper understanding of this process could help to accelerate the recovery of functional connections not only in stroke patients but also in those with spatial neglect60,61 , traumatic brain injury62,63 , or glioma64 .
a deeper knowledge of this rewiring process also provides new insight into the sprouting of new dendritic spines during neuronal silencing65 , which has long been observed but not explained .
neuronal cultures , silenced for 6 days , exhibited reduced strengthening and formation of synaptic connections and less potentiation of synaptic transmission compared with those silenced for 2 days with the same ttx concentration of 1 microm .
this suggests that the potentiating effects of neuronal silencing compete against the opposing loss of connections , leading to the weakening and ultimately to the loss of effective connections with more prolonged inactivity .
these effects occurred without an impairment of cell viability after the pharmacological treatment ( supplementary figure s3 ) .
also the overall synchrony of the neuronal activity in the culture was unaffected by the treatment ( supplementary figure s4 ) .
the causal relation between different cells' time series that we measured as effective connection strengths , however , showed the reported increase after ttx treatment . additional evidence supporting the hypothesis of competing connection strengthening and connection loss comes from a more detailed analysis of neuronal network structure. with the disappearance of alternative routes of communication among cells after 6 days of ttx - induced silencing , the betweenness centrality of cells with remaining connections increased ( supplementary figure s5 ) .
the number of incoming and outgoing connections , which is increased after two days of silencing normalized back to the original values after six days of treatment with the same ttx concentration ( supplementary figure s6 ) .
this is in line with the previously described reduction of dendritic arborization and length after longer - term synaptic inactivity66 .
understanding how to shift this counterbalance toward the densification of neuronal networks and the strengthening of connections might facilitate the development of treatment options for a wide range of diseases such as multiple sclerosis67,68 , alzheimer 's disease39,41,69 , mood disorders70 - 72 , and addiction73 .
although neurons may have appeared to make indiscriminant connections to retain synaptic transmission during network silencing , the connections were not formed at random .
rather , the maintenance of a constant out - per - in - degree and modularity during neuronal inactivity ( supplementary figure s7 ) point toward an action potential - independent regulatory mechanism .
a previous study shows that neurons maintain their distribution of different synapse types under ttx treatment66 .
such basic network properties could be maintained in the absence of neuronal firing through signaling between axons and synaptic terminals or communication via spontaneous synaptic vesicle release74,75 , although further research on this topic is needed .
in summary , using a novel methodological approach , we uncovered the formation of new effective connections during short - term ( 2 days ) but not long - term ( 6 days ) silencing of neuronal activity .
this approach opens the field for further research on population - wide effects of different pharmacological substances and implicates neuronal connectivity as a possible drug target in neurological and psychiatric diseases .

during the first phase of the experiment ( i.e. , the first five stimulations , 445 s ) , cells were perfused with plain imaging buffer .
during the second phase of the experiment ( i.e. , the second five stimulations , 325 s ) , cells were perfused with imaging buffer supplemented with 500 nm ttx , 1 mum ttx , or equivalent volumes of sterile water .
we recorded the fluorescence increase of the cells in response to the electrical stimulations .
each cell 's ten response amplitudes were normalized to the average response amplitudes in the control condition .
image processing and network reconstruction a detailed description of the image processing and network reconstruction steps is provided in the supplementary methods .
briefly , images were filtered according to the fluorescence increase upon electrical stimulation , ensuring the detection of only viable neuronal cells , and regions of interest ( i.e. , neuronal cell bodies ) were detected using a feature point detection algorithm80 .
the fluorescence signal was extracted from the image stacks and the relative fluorescence deltaf / f was derived as previously described81 .
underlying action potentials were inferred from the relative fluorescence traces using an extended template fitting spike estimation algorithm82 .
the gained spike trains for each cell were analyzed to determine similarity and causal relations between all possible pairs of cells with eight different methods : simple cross - correlation83 , mutual information49 , joint entropy50 , transfer entropy51 , generalized transfer entropy37 , spike count , propagation probability and generalized propagation probability .
a detailed description of the used algorithms can be found in the supplementary methods .
the resulting eight values for each pair of cells were then used as predictors in a random undersampled adaptive boosted random forest classification model84 to determine which cell pair 's causal links were strong enough to be classified as connected .
this classification may err so the sensitivity , specificity and accuracy of the classification were validated on simulations with a wide range of initial parameters and the same time resolution as the in vitro imaging data ( supplementary table st1 ) .
on simulated test data with parameters similar to those of the classification training data the model classified with an accuracy of 91.1 % , sensitivity of 77.8 % and specificity of 93.3 % ( supplementary figure 8c ) .
network analysis reconstructed effective networks were analyzed using the predicted connection strength as the connection weight. from a multitude of possible network topology properties53 , we chose to analyze 12 different features that can be transferred to an underlying biological rationale .
detailed mathematical descriptions of the network topology parameters are found in the brain connectivity toolbox documentation by rubinov et al .
( rrid : scr _ 004841 ) 53 and in the supplementary methods .
detailed descriptive and inferential statistics for each network parameter are provided as the tables in the supplementary excel - item .

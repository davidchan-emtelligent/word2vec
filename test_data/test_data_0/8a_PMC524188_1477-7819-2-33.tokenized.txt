background fibromatosis or desmoid tumor covers a broad spectrum of benign fibrous tissue proliferations .
it is characterized by infiltrative growth and a tendency towards recurrence ; however , unlike sarcoma , it never metastasizes .
case presentation we report on a case of extraabdominal fibromatosis originating from the retroperitoneal space in a 43 - year - old woman .
seven years earlier she had undergone ureterolysis and ureteroureterostomy for ureteral obstruction .
computed tomography revealed a tumor between the iliocostalis and the psoas muscle .
histopathological evaluation revealed uniform proliferation of spindle cells , with a moderate amount of collagen fibers , suggesting extraabdominal fibromatosis ( desmoid tumor ) .
the tumor was surgically resected , and since then , the patient has remained asymptomatic without any restrictions of daily living activities and without any signs of tumor recurrence during the two - year follow - up. conclusions complete resection is the treatment of choice .
adjuvant therapy using non steroidal anti - inflammatory agents , tamoxifen , interferon , anti - neoplastic agents , and radiotherapy , either alone or in combination finds application for unresectable or recurrent cases .
background the term " fibromatosis " covers a broad spectrum of benign fibrous tissue proliferations , the biological behavior of which is similar to both benign fibrous lesions and fibrosarcoma .
like fibrosarcoma , fibromatosis is characterized by infiltrative growth and a tendency towards recurrence ; however , unlike sarcoma , it never develops metastasis [ 1 ] .
therefore , the most important strategy is to prevent direct invasion into adjacent tissues .
extraabdominal fibromatosis principally originates from the connective tissue of muscles and the overlying fascia or aponeurosis .
it may occur in a variety of anatomical locations , including the muscles of the shoulder , the chest wall and back , thigh , and head and neck .
however , solitary occurrence is rare in retroperitoneal space [ 1,2 ] .
here , we report on a case of extraabdominal fibromatosis in the retroperitoneum .
resection was successfully performed , and the patient has been tumor - free for two years after surgery .
case presentation a 43 - year - old woman with a history of schizophrenia since 1982 , and a history of hospitalization to help the patient to acquire social communication abilities , at the age of 23 presented with slight pain on her left flank and back .
in 1995 , she was treated with ureterolysis and ureteroureterostomy because of left - sided ureteral obstruction .
histological evaluation of the biopsy revealed benign fibrous tissue proliferations ; however , no further evaluation and surgical excision was planned as her mental state was deteriorating .
she was put on regular follow - up with computed tomography ( ct ) scans .
in may 2002 , she was referred from the psychiatric hospital to our department of urology , as the tumor tended to grow .
ct scan with contrast enhancement revealed a tumor located between iliocostalis and psoas muscles in retroperitoneal space .
the peripheral part of the tumor was enhanced , while the central part did not .
the left paravertebral muscles around the tumor showed atrophy .
the medial margin of the tumor was deformed by a left transverse process of the second lumber spine , suggesting invasive behavior ( figure 1 ) .
coronal magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) demonstrated the tumor to be located beneath the left kidney .
the central part of the tumor was found to be of iso / low intensity in the t1 - weighted phase and of heterogeneously high intensity in the t2 - weighted phase .
the marginal part showed very low intensity in both phases ( figure 2 ) .
in may 2002 , needle biopsy was performed and revealed that the tumor consisted of well - proliferated spindle cells rich in collagen fibers , an observation that was inconsistent with the histological pictures made in 1995 .
in june 2002 , resection was performed using a paraspinal approach .
although the tumor strongly adhered to adjacent tissues , including the urinary tract and peritoneum , it was marginally resected , including paravertebral muscles and part of the spine .
as the kidney was less affected by the tumor , ablation posed no problem .
on gross examination , the cut surface appeared homogeneously gray and glossy ( figure 3 ) .
histologically , a uniform proliferation of spindle cells with a moderate amount of collagen fibers led to a diagnosis of extraabdominal fibromatosis in the retroperitoneal space ( figure 4 ) .
no adjuvant treatment was given and during the two years of follow - up , the patient has remained asymptomatic , with no restrictions of daily living .
there were no clues as to recurrence of the tumor in computed tomography .

discussion extraabdominal fibromatosis may occur in a variety of anatomic locations ; the principle sites of the involvement are the shoulder , chest wall and back , thigh and head and neck .
origin of extraabdominal fibromatosis from any mesenchymal tissue is now well recognized [ 1,2 ] .
several authors have reported retroperitoneal fibromatosis in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis ( gardner syndrome ) [ 2,4 - 6 ] , however , solitary occurrence of fibromatosis is very rarely reported [ 1,2,7 - 9 ] .
our patient did not have a family history and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy , colonoscopy , or opthalmoscopy were normal suggesting that our patient may be negative for the syndrome .
the exact histological origin of the tumor remains to be verified .
the findings of ct suggested an origin from paravertebral muscles .
interestingly , this assumption was corroborated by a computed tomography performed in april 2000 , which revealed that the previous tumor was located intramuscularly principally , complete resection is the therapy of choice for this type of tumors [ 10 ] .
adjuvant therapy using non steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) , tamoxifen , interferon , anti - neoplastic agents , radiation , and a combinations of these , have been reported for cases that are difficult to resect [ 1 ] , the exact benefit offered by them is not known due to thin literature .
radiation therapy is accepted as an effective treatment after incomplete resection [ 11,12 ] .
recently , preoperative radiotherapy was reported to be useful for the local control [ 13 ] .
in our case the tumor detection was delayed because the psychiatric status of our patient which has been unstable for several years .
as wide resection of the tumor reduces the risk of recurrence , an early diagnosis is required for this type of tumor , which is difficult as most of these patients are asymptomatic .
while the silent area contains several vital organs , extraabdominal fibromatosis should be considered for the differential diagnosis for such a lesion .

abstract tettigettalna mariae quartau & boulard 1995 is recorded for the first time in spain .
thought to be endemic to portugal ( occurring in the southern province of algarve ) , the present paper adds its distribution to southern spain , being an iberian endemism .
the acoustic signals of the new specimens collected were recorded in different localities of huelva province , in andalusia during august 2012 .
according to their present known distribution , specimens of tettigettalna mariae tend to be sparsely distributed in small range populations in southern iberian peninsula , favouring wooded areas with pinus pinea .
keywords cicada first record tettigettalna mariae spain project ptdc / bia - bic / 115511 / 2009 of the portuguese foundation for science and technology ( fct ) introduction cicadas ( hemiptera : cicadoidea ) constitute a successful group of insects where males typically communicate during pair formation and courtship through acoustic distinctive signals ( claridge 1985 , boulard and mondon 1995 , simoes et al. 2000 , quartau et al. 1999 ) .
despite being common and with several thousands of species described worldwide , cicada 's biodiversity is still poorly known .
recent work has drawn some concern to the diversity of species in the iberian peninsula ( boulard 1982 , boulard 2000 , puissant and sueur 2010 , sueur et al .
2004 , quartau and fonseca 1988 ) , showing that this region is an important hotspot for mediterranean cicada diversity .
particular attention was given recently to smaller species in southern iberia with nine species assigned to the genus tettigettalna , seven of which are believed to be endemic to southern iberia ( puissant and sueur 2010 ) .
three species ( tettigettalna mariae , tettigettalna josei and tettigettalna estrellae ) have been described and recorded so far in portugal only ( sueur et al .
2004 ) but their distribution range in other parts of the iberia peninsula has never been investigated before .
the current knowledge on the distribution boundaries of tettigettalna species is far from being properly known and extensive field surveys for these cicadas are still missing .
moreover , some of these species are believed to have very restricted distribution ranges as is the case of tettigettalna mariae , a new species that was recently described ( quartau and boulard 1995 ) and was thought to be endemic to the algarve , the southern province of portugal .
materials and methods as an outcome of intensive fieldwork in portugal and spain for species of the genus tettigettalna during the summer of 2012 , we report here the discovery of a new populations of tettigettalna mariae in andalusia ( southern spain ) .
identification was based on the collection of specimens and the recording of male acoustic signals typical of the species .
the field survey was conducted daily from 10:00 h to 19:00 h during sunny weather with temperatures ranging from 29degrees to 32degrees c. searches were conducted by car while driving at a reduced speed , allowing the detection of the songs of calling males .
their acoustic signals were recorded at the collecting site using a marantz pmd 661 portable sd recorder ( 20 hz - 24 khz ) connected to a telinga pro 7 dat - mic microphone ( twin science ) following the procedures given in simoes et al .
2000. specimens were then captured by hand or by means of a sweeping net .
geographical coordinates were determined with a gps ( garmin , oregon series 550t ) for each site where male songs were heard and where specimens were collected .
species confirmation was accomplished with time and frequency analysis of sound recordings using the software avisoft sas - lab pro ( specht 2012 ) as in previous analyses ( e.g. quartau et al. 1999 , simoes et al. 2000 ) .
acoustic recordings were analyzed with a sampling rate of 44.1 khz and a resolution of 16 bits .
spectra were computed using fft with a resolution of 512 points and a hamming window .
for each male , recordings of about one minute were analysed .
song terminology follows that of gogala and trilar ( 1999 ) and gogala and trilar ( 2000 ) .
the examined material and acoustic recordings are deposited in the general data bank on insect data at the department of animal biology in the faculty of sciences , university of lisbon ( fcul ) .
collected specimens were stored dry and a front leg was preserved in 100 % ethanol for dna isolation .

specimens were collected and recorded in different locations from huelva province in andalusia around the following localities : cartaya , aljaraque , moguer , mazagon , almonte and hinojos ( table 1 ) .
records were sparse , even within large patches of suitable habitat , and match its current habitat preference , with tettigettalna mariae tending to favour wooded areas of pinus pinea near the sea in the southern iberian peninsula ( figs 1 , 2 ) .
acoustic analysis ( table 2 , fig. 3 ) showed the profile of the calling song in agreement with previous studies ( quartau and boulard 1995 , fonseca 1991 , unpublished data ) .
tettigettalna mariae specimens have a broad spectrum near 6 - 16.5 khz with maximum energy around 12 khz .
for time domain variables , our results indicated an echeme duration ranging from 0.02 to 0.10s , with an average value of 0.06s .
for the echeme period we found a range of 0.16 to 0.54s and average of 0.32s .
discussion previous studies suggested that tettigettalna mariae was a portuguese endemic cicada , seeming to be confined to central algarve , close to the sea ( sueur et al .
2004 ) which is an area under increasing human pressure .
the coastline of algarve is heavily urbanized , with many touristic villages and golf courses covering most of vilamoura , vale do lobo and quinta do lago .
this raises concerns about the conservation of tettigettalna mariae given the restricted habitat range of the known populations .
the discovery of tettigettalna mariae populations in spain means that the species is not confined to the central wooded area of algarve , close to the sea , having instead a wider distribution extending to andalusia .
the new populations of tettigettalna mariae reported here constitute an important addition to the scarce knowledge of this rare species .
however , tettigettalna mariae distribution remains heavily fragmented and discontinuous .
consequently the species is still vulnerable to habitat loss caused by changes in land use or forest fires that often jeopardize pinus pinea woods during the summer , when cicada adult males are active .
these threats may cause the decline and eventual extinction of local populations of cicadas and are especially worrying for small range species such as tettigettalna mariae ( quartau and mathias 2010 ). with the present data , obtained through our 2012 fieldwork , a new cicada species is listed for spain and a new endemism for iberia .
moreover , the current species list available for the cicadas from iberian peninsula are likely to still be incomplete .
as the male acoustic signals in cicadas are highly diagnostic for the separation of closely related species ( claridge 1985 , boulard and mondon 1995 , gogala et al. 2008 , gogala et al .
2011 ) , it is quite possible that to the same specific name may correspond in fact two or more independent sibling species as has happened in other genera , such as cicadetta ( e.g.gogala et al. 2008 , gogala et al. 2011 ) .
all this suggests the presence of a larger number of species in the iberian peninsula than those already recorded and calls for further cicada surveys in the area , as well as a better knowledge of cicada biology and ecology , which is the key to the conservation of these interesting insects in the mediterranean area .

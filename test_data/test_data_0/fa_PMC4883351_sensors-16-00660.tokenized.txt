introduction in the field of nanobiotechnology , the electrochemical study of biomolecules plays an important role in understanding the electron transfer mechanism of living organisms [ 1,2 ] .
recently , the electrochemical study of biomolecules has made advances in the form of nano - biotechnologies , such as the fabrication of biochips , biosensors , and bioelectronic applications [ 3,4 ] .
the electrochemical analysis of biomolecules not only provides an understanding of their electrochemical behavior , but also furthers applications to biomedical and environmental biosensors .
in particular , an electrochemical - based biosensor composed of protein can be a very effective tool to characterize a target analyte [ 5 ] .
various types of electrochemical - based biosensor composed of protein such as antibody and enzyme have been reported for environmental , biomedical , and food industry applications [ 6,7,8,9 ] .
in particular , the detection of hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) is a quite significant chemical compound in the clinical , environmental , pharmaceutical , and cosmetic industries [ 10,11 ] .
within a living organism h2o2 is a reactive oxygen by - product which related with key elements as a regulating diverse biological stress .
the oxidative stress related with h2o2 has been linked to cytotoxic effects and immune cell activation , as well as intracellular thermogenesis [ 12 ] .
for these reasons the detection of h2o2 at low concentration is considered to be an important analyte .
usually , various enzymes such as peroxidases , lipoxygenase , and catalases are used to detect h2o2 for biosensor applications [ 13,14,15 ] .
however , these enzymes are too sensitive , unstable , and expensive .
recently , metalloproteins have been introduced to detect h2o2 because they can provide a direct transfer of electrons and improved sensitivity [ 16 ] .
hemoglobin ( hb ) is a well - investigated metalloprotein with a molecular weight of ~ 64.5 kda , and has four electroactive ferrous ions ( fe2 +) in a heme group that are oxidized to ferric ions ( fe3 +) .
it has been studied in the context of the life sciences , pharmaceutical sciences , and medicine [ 17,18 ] .
in living organisms , hemoglobin transports oxygen in red blood cells [ 12 ] .
recently , hemoglobin has been used to develop an enzymeless h2o2 biosensor for peroxidase activity .
because the hemoglobin provides the direct electron transfer ( det ) to achieve the fast electron transfer with high sensitivity [ 19,20 ] .
several groups have studied the hemoglobin - based biosensor on a conventional electrode surface [ 12,21,22,23,24,25 ] , while others introduced nanoparticles [ 21 ] , graphene [ 22 ] and other heavy metal materials [ 23 ] on an electrode to facilitate the electron transfer between h2o2 and hemoglobin .
however , such heavy metal - based nanomaterials are toxic and possess low biocompatibility .
a gold nanoparticle was introduced to facilitate the electron transfer between hemoglobin and au electrode .
the gold nanoparticle is toxic at low levels and widely used to fabricate the electrochemical biosensor [ 26,27 ] .
furthermore , the electrochemical - based biosensor has been studied on a bulk scale electrode .
some groups proposed miniaturized biosensor to detect the erbb2 protein [ 28 ] , psa [ 29 ] and dna hybridization [ 30 ] .
those miniaturized biosensors provide ( 1 ) defined distance between working and counter electrodes ; ( 2 ) detect the low concentration of sample .
to develop the advanced electrochemical biosensor based on direct electron transfer , the miniaturized biosensor with high sensitivity will be needed .
in the present study , the hemoglobin / gold nanoparticle heterolayer was fabricated on the micro - gap for signal - enhanced electrochemical h2o2 biosensor applications .
to determine the h2o2 detection property , the hemoglobin / gold nanoparticle ( hb / gnp ) was immobilized onto the au electrode and au micro - gap electrode through self - assembly method .
the immobilization of the hemoglobin / gold nanoparticle heterolayer was confirmed by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) and surface - enhanced raman spectroscopy ( sers ) .
the performance of the hemoglobin / gold nanoparticle heterolayer biosensor was investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( cv ) .

the tapping - mode afm was operated with a nanoscope iv / multimode from digital instruments .
the tips used for the afm measurement were phosphorous ( n - type doped si ) , and the resonance peaks in the frequency response of the cantilever were selected at around of 230 - 305 khz .
spring constants of 20 - 80 n / m were used .
before scanning the sample , the set point was adjusted to optimize the force between the tip and the biomolecule .

then , the hemoglobin was immobilized via 6 - mha linker , and the gold nanoparticle was dropped onto the hemoglobin - modified substrate for sers measurement [ 34 ] .
2.5 .
electrochemical analysis of hemoglobin - gold nanoparticle heterolayer an electrochemical h2o2 detection test of the hb / gnp heterolayer was performed using a chi660a electrochemical workstation ( ch instruments , austin , tx , usa ) and a three - electrode system .
the hb / gnp immobilized on the working electrode in the micro - gap. and the counter electrode part in micro - gap was used as a counter electrode and an ag / agcl ( saturated kcl ) electrode was used for a reference electrode .
the electrochemical analysis for the h2o2 sensitivity was performed in 10 mm pbs buffer solution ( ph = 7.4 ) at room temperature [ 16 ] .
the electrochemical experiment was repeated with five samples .
3. results and discussion 3.1 .
the surface investigation of hemoglobin / gold nanoparticle hybrid by afm and sers afm measurement was conducted to investigate the surface morphology of fabricated hb / gnp heterolayer .
the hb self - assembled on 6 - mha layer and hb / gnp hybrid layer were investigated .
in the case of the hemoglobin surface , small lumps of protein clusters were oriented onto the au substrate via 6 - mha linker .
the average lump sizes were around 20 - 30 nm and the vertical distance of each lump was 4 - 7 nm ( figure 3a ) .
however , the surface of the hb / gnp heterolayer , the lump size , and vertical distance showed a different size and shape compared to hemoglobin 's lump .
the size of the hemoglobin lumps were around 40 - 55 nm and vertical size around 15 - 20 nm ( figure 3b ) .
the hemoglobin / gold nanoparticle clusters were larger than the lumps of hb. presumably , the result showed the gold nanoparticle was adsorbed on the hemolgobin molecule because the hemoglobin molecule was self - assembled onto the 6 - mha - modified au substrate .
as a result , the hemoglobin / gold nanoparticle was well oriented onto the au substrate .
moreover , the surface roughness of the hb / gnp and hb were analyzed using afm nanoscope software .
the surface roughness values of the the hb self - assembled on 6 - mha layer and the hb / gnp self - assembled on 6 - mha layer are shown in figure 3c , respectively .
in the case of the hb , the ra value is 0.298 +/ - 0.174 nm , rms roughness ( rq ) shows 1.094 +/ - 0.275 nm , and rmax is 1.315 +/ - 0.333 nm. also , the average vertical distance of hemoglobin is 4.685 +/ - 1.221 nm. in the case of the hemoglobin / gold nanoparticle , the average ra , rq , rmax and vertical distance values are 1.253 +/ - 0.418 nm , 5.747 +/ - 1.199 nm , 4.865 +/ - 0.795 nm , and 17.206 +/ - 3.337 nm , respectively .
based on these results , the hb / gnp heterolayer was well immobilized to the au surface for further experiment .
figure 3d displays the sers spectra of the hemoglobin layer ( brown line ) and the hb / gnp heterolayer ( blue line ) , respectively .
the raman peaks of the hb were monitored near the region of 1126 cm - 1 , 1214 cm - 1 ; the 1126 cm - 1 peak is assigned to the pyrrole half - ring stretching mode [ 35 ] .
the intense peak at 1216 cm - 1 was attributed to the cmh out - of - plane deformation stretching mode. and the raman spectra of hb was recorded near 651 cm - 1 , which had peaks assigned to the c - s ( cys ) stretching .
the intense peak monitored near 1347 and 1356 cm - 1 correspond to the anti - symmetric upsilon ( pyr half - ring ) sym. and the intense band near the region of 924 cm - 1 was previously assigned to modes involving c - coo - stretching [ 36 ] .
those peaks are monitored to both of sers spectra .
compared to hb , the hb / gnp heterolayer possesses a greater sers intensity .
based on this result , the hb / gnp heterolayer was well - oriented onto the gold nanoparticle - coated ito surface .
3.2 .
cyclic voltammetric behavior of hemoglobin / gold nanoparticle a cyclic voltammetry was conducted to compare the redox properties of the hb and hb / gnp heterolayer - immobilized on a conventional au electrode ( 1 x 2 cm ) and au micro - gap electrode .
as shown in figure 4a , the redox property of the hb showed a quasi - reversible redox peaks ( brown line ) because of the fe3 +/ 2 + redox center that provides the electron exchange .
the anodic peak potential ( epa ) and cathodic peak potential ( epc ) were showed at 103 mv and 67 mv ( vs. ag / agcl ) , respectively , with a peak - to - peak separation ( deltaep ) of 36 mv. the redox property of the hb / gnp showed a signal - enhanced redox peak ( purple line ) because the gnp facilitates electron transfer between hb and h2o2 .
the anodic peak potential ( epa ) and cathodic peak potential ( epc ) were 233 and 181 mv ( vs. ag / agcl ) , respectively , with a peak - to - peak separation ( deltaep ) of 52 mv. this result shows that the gold nanoparticles provide the higher surface roughness and active area which yields to a higher coverage [ 37 ] .
moreover , a cv test of hb and hb / gnp was carried out on the micro - gap electrode .
the figure 4b shows the cyclic voltamogram of hb and hb / gnp .
in the case of hb on the micro - gap electrode displayed a couple of well - defined quasi - reversible redox peaks ( blue line ) because of the fe3 +/ 2 + redox center .
the redox current signal was shown to be less than 10 times the bulk au electrode , the anodic peak potential ( epa ) and cathodic peak potential of hb were determined to be 0.213 and 0.196 v ( vs. ag / agcl ) ( blue line ) with a peak - to - peak separation ( deltaep ) of 17 mv , which was narrow compared to the bulk au electrode .
the redox peaks of hb / gnp showed a signal - enhanced redox peak ( red line ) because the gnp facilitate electron transfer between hb and h2o2 similar to the bulk au electrode .
the anodic peak potential ( epa ) and cathodic peak potential ( epc ) were 224 mv and 187 mv ( vs. ag / agcl ) , respectively , with a peak - to - peak separation ( deltaep ) of 37 mv , which was narrow compared to the bulk au electrode .
this result shows that the hb / gnp heterolayer maintained the facilitation of the electron transfer on the micro - gap electrode .
3.3 .
electrocatalytic properties of hemoglobin / gold nanoparticle on the micro - gap electrode cyclic voltammograms of the hb / gnp - modified micro - gap electrode were obtained with different scan rates from 0.01 to 0.05 v / s ( figure 5a ) .
the result displays well - defined and slightly shifted cathodic and anodic peaks at each scan rate .
also , the cv result shows a linear plot for cathodic and anodic peak currents against the scan rate ( figure 5b ) , respectively .
the linear regression equations were ip / 10 x e - 8 a = 0.0067 v ( mv / s ) - 0.0229 for cathodic currents and ip / 10 x e - 8 a = - 0.0728 v ( mv / s ) - 0.0266 for anodic currents .
the linearity of the cv results corresponded to the scan rate ( v ) show an increment of scan rate yields a slight shift of the cathodic peak to a more negative potential , while the anodic peak was moved to a more positive potential .
plotting epa and epc vs. log ( scan rate ) yielded two straight lines with a slope equal to - 2.3 rt / alphanf for the cathodic peak , and a slope of 2.3 rt /( 1 - alpha ) nf for the anodic peak .
the charge transfer coefficient was calculated ( 0.27 ) from the slopes of the straight lines based on the following equation [ 38 ] : ( 1 ) logkakc = log [ alpha ( 1 - alpha )] or kakc = alpha1 - alpha where ka is the slope of the line derived from epa = f ( log scan rate ) ; kc is the slope of the line derived from ; epc = f ( log alpha ) .
the electron - transfer rate constant ( ks ) for electron transfer between the micro - gap electrode and the surface hb layers was also 0.35 s - 1 based on the following equation [ 16,38 ] ; ( 2 ) logks = alphalog ( 1 - alpha )+( 1 - alpha ) logalpha - log ( rtnfnu ) - alpha ( 1 - alpha ) nfdeltaep2.3rt also , the hb shows electrocatalytic activity because of its similarity with peroxidase for catalysis of h2o2 [ 9,20 ] .
the electrocatalytic activity of the hb / gnp to h2o2 on the micro - gap electrode was investigated by cv. the principle of catalyzing h2o2 of hb was explained using the following equations : hb [ fe ( iii )] + e - - - > hb [ fe ( ii )] ( 3 ) 2 [ hb - fe ( ii )] + 2h + + h2o2 - - > 2 [ hb - fe ( iii )] + 2h2o ( 4 ) the overall reaction would be : h2o2 + 2h + + 2e - - - > 2 h2o ( 5 ) figure 5c shows the electrochemical signal - enhancement effect of anodic and cathodic currents corresponding to the successive addition of h2o2 .
the redox currents of hb / gnp were gradually increased according to the addition of 10 nmol h2o2 , 30 nmol h2o2 , 50 nmol h2o2 , 100 nmol h2o2 .
this result shows the electrocatalytic reduction process of the hb / gnp heterolayer on the micro - gap .
the anodic peak potential ( epa ) and cathodic peak potential ( epc ) were 0.207 and 0.205 v ( vs. ag / agcl ) , respectively .
as shown in figure 5d,e , cathodic and anodic current peaks were obtained for the hb / gnp heteroalyer on micro - gap electrode after the addition of 20 microl aliquots of 10 mm h2o2 in 1 ml of 10 mm hepes at ph 7.0 .
the result shows a linear plot for anodic and cathodic peak currents against the addition of h2o2 , and the sensor calibration plot was linear with r2 = 0.97 ( anodic peak ) and 0.98 ( cathodic peak ) , respectively .
the slope values of anodic and cathodic peak currents against the addition of h2o2 , ipa = 0.1862x + 4.3234 ( 10 x e - 8 a ) and ipc = - 0.2152x - 3.8476 ( 10 x e - 8 a ). and the 17.6 % of cathodic peak current and 20.8 % of anodic peak current were increased corresponding to the addition of h2o2 .
based on this analysis , an increase of h2o2 concentration shifts the oxidation peaks to a more positive potential , while the reduction peaks shifted to a more negative potential on the micro - gap .
4. conclusions in summary , the hb / gnp heterolayer on the micro - gap was fabricated to detect the h2o2 with electrochemical - signal enhanced effect .
the fabricated hb / gnp hybrid layer was investigated by afm and sers .
additionally , the redox properties of hb / gnp hybrid layer on bulk electrode and micro - gap were confirmed using cv. also , the h2o2 detection test of hb / gnp heterolayer on the micro - gap was conducted .
as a result , the fabricated hb / gnp heterolayer on the au micro - gap was detected the low concentration ( 10 nmol ) of h2o2 with high fidelity .
these results show the electrochemical signal - enhancement effect of hb / gnp heterolayer can be directly applied to a protein - based biosensor system at the micro - scale .
this metalloprotein - nanoparticle hybrid layer can be used for miniaturized h2o2 biosensor applications .

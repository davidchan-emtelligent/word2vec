http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 abstract background : the high incidence of cognition disorders in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) patients represents a main focus in public health field recently .
thus , we tried to explore relationship between cognitive function and arterial partial pressure o2 ( pao2 ) in patients with copd as assessed by mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) and / or montreal cognitive assessment ( moca ) .
materials and methods : medical and scientific literature databases , such as web of science , pubmed , cochrane library , china national knowledge infrastructure , and wanfang database , were searched independently by 2 reviewers until february 2016 .
correlation coefficient ( r or rs ) values were obtained from each study , and 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) were calculated using stata12.0 software .
results : a total of 2049 studies were produced , and 9 of which were analyzed ( 714 participants ) in the meta - analysis .
the pooled r observed medium relationship for all selected studies ( r = 0.405 , 95 % ci 0.31 - 0.55 ) , and notable heterogeneity was also tested between studies ( chi2 = 17.72 , p = . 023 ; i2 = 54.9 %) .
after the sensitivity and subgroup analysis , the heterogeneity significantly decreased .
subgroup analysis showed that mmse score was stronger correlation between pao2 and cognitive function than moca score in the copd patients .
begg test did not indicate potential risk of publication bias .
conclusions : there was a negative correlation between cognitive function and anoxia in patients with copd , so it may be extremely essential to predict and improve the status of hypoxia in copd patients .
keywords anoxia chronic obstructive cognition disorders meta - analysis pulmonary disease open - accesstrue 1 introduction chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) is now the preferred term for a condition that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and irreversible , progressive airflow limitation .
it is now well recognized that the pathophysiology of copd is frequently associated with a wide range of comorbidities , which defined as copd associated multiple systemic lesions. [ 1,2 ] the damage of nervous system , mediated by hypoxia mainly due to the pulmonary disease or the comorbidities that adversely affect the brain ( such as smoking ) , is one of the most important nonrespiratory manifestation. [ 1,3,4 ] the impairment of cognition could aggravate mortality and disability in copd patients. [ 5,6 ] the prevalence of copd associated cognitive impairment is accounted for a sizeable proportion of its comorbidities .
a study acknowledges that there were 10.4 % of copd patients suffering from cognitive problem. [ 5 ] dodd et al [ 7 ] have even claimed that only 3 % of copd patients possess perfectly cognitive capacity .
cognitive dysfunction , defined as the decrease of cognitive ability weaker than expected for a certain age and educational level of the individual , includes mild cognitive impairment ( mci ) and dementia .
mci is an intermediate stage between normal cognitive aging and dementia. [ 8 ] but the mechanisms involved in copd patients with cognitive impairment are not fully understood because of their complexity .
arterial partial pressure o2 ( pao2 ) , by contrast , is cost most study efforts .
some studies have claimed that pao2 is significantly correlated with cognition disorders in copd patients. [ 7,9 ] however , other studies hold that there is no correlation between cognitive function and pao2 in copd group. [ 10,11 ] the primary goal of the meta - analysis was to explain the inconsistencies of all eligible studies and to explore possible relationship between cognitive impairment and pao2 in patients with copd as assessed by mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) and / or montreal cognitive assessment ( moca ) .
2 materials and methods 2.1 literature - retrieval strategy a comprehensive electronic data retrieval was performed in web of science , pubmed , cochrane library , china national knowledge infrastructure , and wanfang database until february 2016 .
copd was searched in all databases using as syntax : " pulmonary disease , chronic obstructive " [ mesh ] or " pulmonary disease , chronic obstructive " [ title / abstract ] or " chronic obstructive pulmonary disease " [ title / abstract ] or " copd " [ title / abstract ] , and cognitive impairment were described as the following syntax : " mild cognitive impairment " [ mesh ] or " cognition disorders " [ mesh ] or " dementia " [ mesh ] or " mild cognitive impairment " [ title / abstract ] or " cognition disorders " [ title / abstract ] or " cognitive impairment " [ title / abstract ] or " cognitive deficit " [ title / abstract ] or " cognitive defect " [ title / abstract ] or " cognitive decline " [ title / abstract ] or " dementia " [ title / abstract ] .
2.2 inclusion and exclusion criteria all the following criteria had to be met in the process .
the inclusion criteria were as follows : the outcome was the association between pao2 and cognition in patients with copd ; subjects were impaired cognition from copd patients not with alzheimer disease , vascular dementia , or other diseases that known to affect cognitive status , in order to ensure that cognition disorder was caused only by copd ; the effect indicator was the pearson correlation coefficient , which also could be transformed from spearman rho ; the assessment tools for cognition were limited to mmse and / or moca ; and the report was only published in english or chinese .
the following studies were excluded : the repeated report and the most informative version report were introduced into our study , with regard to multiple reports including the same study population .
the inclusion and exclusion processes were shown in fig. 1. figure 1 flow diagram of studies selection process .
2.3 data selection and quality assessment this study did not involve human or animal experiments , and thus ethical approval was not necessary .
the data selection and quality assessment were operated by 2 independent authors ( x - hw and yl ) in a standardized manner .
we would discuss with a 3rd reviewer ( ls ) to resolve any disagreements which were arose until it reached a consensus in the process .
the statistics of studies from the above - mentioned databases on the links between cognition disorders and pao2 in copd patients were extracted using endnote x7 software .
we appraise the quality of 9 cross - sectional studies with the agency for healthcare research and quality consisted of 11 rating items .
articles scoring criteria as follows : " 4 - 7 " regarding moderate quality , and it was low quality when < 4 points , exceeding 7 points was considered as high quality .
2.4 statistical synthesis and analysis in this meta - analysis , we used stata12.0 software ( stata corporation , college station , tx ) to conduct the statistical analysis .
there was an interchange between pearson correlation coefficients and fisher z - value with the following formula. [ 12 ] eventually , the summary r value was obtained with the summary fisher z - value in the review .
correlation coefficient values were extracted from all computations , which were also transformed from spearman rho. [ 13 ] we regarded correlation effect sizes of 0.10 , 0.30 , and 0.50 as small , medium , and large correlation , respectively. [ 14 ] regarding the assessment of heterogeneity , the article was carried out using chi2 - based q testing and i2 statistics among studies , and statistical significance was set at p < . 05. [ 15 ] for significance of i2 values , we considered that the value of 25 % to 50 % , 50 % to 75 % , and 75 % to 100 % represented low , medium , and high heterogeneity , respectively. [ 16 ] the random - effect model was adopted and subgroup analyses or meta - regression also was applied to analysis its source when heterogeneity existed obviously ( i2 value > 50 %) .
otherwise , the fixed - effect model was used .
potential publication bias were checked by funnel plots [ 12 ] and begg test [ 17 ] in this study , considered as statistically significant when p value < . 05 .
3 results 3.1 characteristics of included trials a total of 2049 potential references were yielded with the original search of databases .
after screening , 9 studies enrolling 714 participants met the inclusion criteria .
the flow chart of selection of studies and reasons for exclusion were presented in fig. 1. as shown in table 1 , there was a detailed description among 9 trials , 7 of them used pearson r values and 2 other papers utilized spearman rho r values .
the qualities of the included studies were all medium quality , also presented in table 1 .
table 1 baseline characteristics of trials included in meta - analysis .
3.2 the correlation between cognition and pao2 the study with copd patients has claimed that pao2 had a medium negative association with cognitive dysfunction ( r = 0.405 , 95 % ci 0.31 - 0.55 ) .
however , the data indicated that there was high heterogeneity by random - effect model ( chi2 = 17.72 , p = . 023 ; i2 = 54.9 %) in fig. 2. figure 2 the association between cognition and pao2 .
pao2 = arterial partial pressure o2 .
3.3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted in comparison with significant heterogeneity across studies by deleting 1 single study each time from the pooled analysis .
the result of analysis found that li 's [ 19 ] and tomruk 's [ 9 ] studies had a greater effect in the overall studies ( chi2 = 12.46 , p = . 086 , i2 = 43.8 % ; chi2 = 10.86 , p = . 145 , i2 = 35.5 % , respectively ) , indicating that they could affect the pooled fisher z - value significantly .
3.4 subgroup analysis with regard to the links between cognition and pao2 in copd patients , we adopted subgroup analysis .
according to the cognition assessment tool , there was 5 papers were assessed with an moca , revealing a small positive correlation ( r = 0.291 , 95 % ci 0.21 - 0.40 ) and more closely when assessed by mmse ( r = 0.537 , 95 % ci 0.47 - 0.74 ) in fig. 3. regarding copd states ( stable disease and / or exacerbations ) , fig. 4 indicated that there was a large correlation with copd patients ( r = 0.508 , 95 % ci 0.36 - 0.77 ) , and medium for either groups of the stable copd and acute exacerbation of copd ( r = 0.310 , 95 % ci 0.23 - 0.42 ; r = 0.397 , 95 % ci 0.12 - 0.71 , respectively ) .
after sensitivity analysis , there also was a medium positive correlation between cognitive function and pao2 ( r = 0.327 , 95 % ci : 0.26 - 0.43 ) when excluded 2 studies ( li 's [ 19 ] and tomruk 's [ 9 ]) in selected trials ( fig. 5 ) .

pao2 = arterial partial pressure o2 .
figure 5 the association between cognition and pao2 excluded tomruk 's and li 's studies .
pao2 = arterial partial pressure o2 .
3.5 publication bias as shown in fig. 6 , the funnel plot seemed to slightly asymmetrical based on visual inspection .
the result of begg test did not indicate potential risk of publication bias ( z = 1.56 , p = . 118 ) , which may result from the inclusion of the fewer relative studies .

4 discussion in the present meta - analysis , there are too few reviews to evaluate hypoxia copd and associated cognition disorders in recent several years .
it was evidence from our result that there was medium effect on cognitive decline in hypoxia copd patients , which conformed with the results of other studies. [ 10,18 ] namely , the level of hypoxemia was positive correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment .
until recently , intermittent and continuous hypoxia caused by copd is recognized as a key mechanism that can adversely affect metabolism of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. [ 25,26 ] among copd patients especially in severe forms , the ischemia and subcortical atrophy are deteriorated mainly due to the decreased of cerebral blood perfusion .
eventually , cognition is impaired in copd patients .
furthermore , antonelli - incalzi et al confirmed that the decline of drawing ability , one of the mainly detailed assessment regions , was highly beneficial to assessing the presence of cognitive impairment in hypoxemic copd patients. [ 5 ] the research found that low baseline oxygen saturation (< 88 %) was related to increased risk of cognitive impairment ( or 5.45 ; 95 % ci 1.014 - 29.2 ; p = . 048 ) .
conversely , regular use of supplemental oxygen therapy decreased the risk for cognitive impairment ( or 0.14 ; 95 % ci 0.07 - 0.27 ; p < . 0001 ).[ 25 ] karamanli et al also thought the patients who got the long - term oxygen therapy might help a significant increase in cognitive status. [ 27 ] to sum up , long - term oxygen therapy may be more beneficial in copd patients .
however , a few studies found no statistically significant differences between hypoxemia and cognition disorder in copd patients. [ 10,11,28 ] hung et al [ 29 ] hold the patients with nonsevere copd was not associated with worse cognition ability when compared with those without copd , but severe copd was associated with lower cognitive performance , which means that nonsevere copd with or without hypoxemia could not arise directly the occurrence of cognitive impairment. and liesker et al [ 28 ] concluded that even nonhypoxemic patients with copd showed significant impairments in cognitive performance .
the reason for the inconsistency might be poor understood about hypoxemia and associated cognitive performance .
based on prior research , it is still lacking a wide range of data with representation and universality from all over the word. of course , studies differed in their composition of subjects should not be ignored , for example , assessment scale of cognitive capacity , demographic variables including age , education level , and the severity and staging of copd and so on. typically , the different scales with their characters were researched showing lots of controversies .
our meta - analysis revealed that mmse score was more sensitive assessment scale than moca score ( r = 0.537 , 95 % ci 0.47 - 0.74 ) .
however , another study implied that the moca score was superior to the mmse score for the assessment of cognitive impairment. [ 30 ] dal negro et al claimed cognition assessment , evaluated by 4 validated psychometric questionnaires including mmse , the clock drawing test , trail making test a and b ( tmt a and tmt b ) , would generate homologous but various correlation coefficients in patients with hypoxia copd. [ 11 ] and there were no statistically significant differences assessed by mmse ; on the contrary , the other 3 scales were more sensitive cognitive assessment tools with hypoxemic copd patients. [ 11 ] besides , pulmonary function is indistinct for the link , some studies proved that cognitive impairment was related to the severity of copd. [ 30,31 ] however , other studies refuted that pulmonary function was not considered to be a reliable predictor for mci in copd populations. [ 28,32 ] a study confirmed that the impairment of cognition was more severe in the late - stage copd than mild - to - moderate disease , and there was irrelevant between cognition and the forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( fev1 ) in mild - to - moderate copd patients , but both pao2 and fev1 could affect cognitive in severe patients. [ 18,19 ] furthermore , after the diagnosis of severe disease is established , higher partial carbon dioxide pressure , longer course , frequent exacerbation phenotype , or systemic inflammation , more number of exacerbation events in a year and so on will be taken in consideration to influence cognition. [ 33 ] the evidence showed that patients with more frequent acute exacerbation events of copd suffered worse cognitive function. [ 34 ] this study has some limitations .
first , data from the literature are still scarce , especially foreign research , and most studies are mainly clinical examinations with snail numbers of samples lacking of representation and universality about the link between hypoxemia and cognition in copd group .
second , there is few data from the same study population utilize various questionnaires characterized by different sensitivities to measure their cognitive status , which could verify which one is best scale to assess the cognition .
third , publication bias might have existed even if it was not detected by begg test , the reason is that our research with insufficient data only consisted of published studies , excluded unpublished studies .
5 conclusion in conclusion , the meta - analysis permitted that there was negative correlation between hypoxemia and cognitive function .
thus , it may be beneficial and imperative to predict and improve the status of hypoxia which could enhance the living quality of copd patients .

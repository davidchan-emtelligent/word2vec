introduction streptococcus pneumoniae is a worldwide occurring pathogen nasopharyngeal carriage of streptococcus pneumoniae precedes pneumonia and other pneumococcal diseases in the community .
little is known about s. pneumoniae carriage in indonesia , complicating strategies to control pneumococcal diseases .
we investigated nasopharyngeal carriage of s. pneumoniae in semarang , indonesia .
methods a population - based survey was performed in semarang , indonesia .
nasopharyngeal swabs and questionnaires were taken from 496 healthy young ( 6 - 60 month - old ) children and 45 - 70 year - old adults .
results forty - three percent of children aged 6 - 60 months and 11 % of adults aged 45 - 75 years carried s. pneumoniae .
determinants of carriage were being a child ( or 7.7 ; 95 % ci = 4.5 - 13.0 ) , passive smoking ( or 2.1 ; 95 % ci = 1.3 - 3.4 ) , and contact with toddler ( s ) at home ( or 3.0 ; 95 % ci = 1.9 - 4.7 ) .
the most frequent serotypes found were 6a / b and 15b / c. the current commercially available vaccines cover < 50 % serotypes found in children .
twenty - four percent of s. pneumoniae strains were penicillin non - susceptible , and 45 % were resistant to cotrimoxazol .
conclusions the limited coverage of commercially available vaccines against the serotypes found in this population , and the high proportion of non - susceptibility to penicillin and cotrimoxazol suggest the need for region - specific information and strategies to control s. pneumoniae .
the authors have no support or funding to report .
introduction streptococcus pneumoniae is a worldwide occurring pathogen [ 1 ] .
data on this species are abundantly available in developed countries , but still scarce in low - to - middle - income countries , leading to difficulties in designing national strategies to control pneumococcal diseases .
since pneumococcal pneumonia is preceeded by nasopharyngeal colonization with s. pneumoniae [ 2 ] , it is relevant to study the nasopharyngeal carriage pattern in humans , particularly in those at higher risk of pneumonia .
pneumococcal carriage has already been extensively studied in many parts of the world , but only few data are available from indonesia [ 3 ] , the fourth most populated country in the world .
we investigated the nasopharyngeal carriage of s. pneumonia in an urban area of indonesia , to study the prevalence , risk factors , serotypes , and antimicrobial susceptibility .
methods ethics statement the study was approved by the ethical committee of the faculty of medicine , diponegoro university , semarang .
written informed consent was given by the subjects or their caregivers .
subjects a population - based survey was performed in semarang , a city with 1.5 million residents in central java , among healthy children aged 6 - 60 months and healthy adults aged 45 - 70 years as described before [ 4 ] .
exclusion criteria were the presence of respiratory symptoms and antibiotic consumption within the last three days .
cluster random sampling was done from february to april 2010 to recruit subjects from all 16 districts of semarang .
specimen collection and laboratory testing nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained using rayon - tipped swabs and transported in amies - charcoal media ( copan , italy ) .
swabs were inoculated on 5 % sheep blood agar with gentamicin ( 5 mg / liter ) and incubated at 35degreesc in 5 % co2 for 48 hours .
identification of s. pneumoniae was performed using the optochin test ( oxoid , basingstoke , uk ) and , in case of doubt , a dna hybridization test ( accuprobe , gen - probe inc. , san diego , ca , usa ) .
antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed using disk diffusion method ( oxoid , uk ) and e - test ( biomerieux , france ) and interpreted according to eucast 2012 .
serotyping of s.pneumoniawas done with a multiplex - pcr which covers 36 serotypes [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
control strains were included in all analyses .
data on demography , house sanitation ( crowding , smoke exposure from cigarette and mosquito coils ) , and water and food hygiene , were recorded using a questionnaire that was developed to identify determinants of carriage .
crowding was defined to be present when the ratio of total bedroom space to the number of family members was less than 4 m2 [ 7 ] .
water hygiene was defined as poor when water other than tap or bottled water was used by the family .
food hygiene was considered poor if the family consumed street food .
statistical analysis univariate analysis was done with chi - square or fisher 's exact tests when appropriate , followed by backward stepwise logistic regression for variables with p value < 0.2 using spss 17 ( spss inc , chicago , usa ) .
p value of < 0.05 was considered significant .
results subjects two hundred and fifty - three adults aged 45 - 70 years and 243 children aged 6 - 60 months participated in the study .
the characteristics of the participants have been presented previously [ 4 ] .
crowding was common , as was exposure to smoke .
carriage prevalence and determinants overall carriage of s. pneumoniae was 27 % ( 95 % ci : 20 - 32 ) , 43 % in children ( 95 % ci : 32 - 50 ) and 11 % in adults ( 95 % ci : 5 - 15 ) .
the proportion carrying s.pneumoniae varied significantly across the districts of semarang ( p < 0.05 ) , and tended to be higher in the suburban and eastern parts of the city ( figure 1 ) .
multivariate analysis showed that being a child ( or 7.7 , 95 % ci,4.5 - 13.0 ) , passive smoking ( or 2.1 , 95 % ci,1.4 - 3.4 ) , and contact with toddler ( s ) at home ( or 3.0 , 95 % ci , 1.9 - 4.7 ) were independent determinants of carriage .

antimicrobial susceptibility and serotypes one hundred and forty - two strains were isolated from 133 subjects .
in total , 34 ( 24 %) strains were penicillin non - susceptible ( mic ranged 0.047 - 1.5 ) , including 25 ( 23 %) from children and 9 ( 29 %) from adults ( p = 0.25 ) .
forty - five percent of the strains were resistant to cotrimoxazol , 1 % to erythromycin , and 5 % to tetracycline .
there was no significant difference in the susceptibility pattern between isolates from children and those from adults ( p > 0.1 ) .
no strain was resistant to neither penicillin nor vancomycin .
capsular type 6a / b was the most prevalent serotype in all age groups ( 19 % in children and 39 % in adults ) .
the most common capsular serotypes in children , comprising 61 % of strains , were 6a / b , 15b / c , 11a , 23f , 19f , 23a .
those in adults , were 6a / b , 15b / c , and 15a .
these two serotype patterns differed significantly ( p = 0.029 ) .
other serotypes were less frequently found ( table 1 ) .
twenty percent were un - typeable with the multiplex - pcr employed .

however , it was lower than those in gambia [ 9 ] , poland [ 10 ] , australia [ 11 ] , thailand [ 12 ] , and higher than those reported from iran [ 13 ] and korea [ 14 ] .
the carriage prevalence among adults in our study was 11 % , wich is higher than that found in alaska [ 15 ] , but lower than that among australian aboriginals of the same age [ 11 ] .
the prevalence differences among populations may be related to sampling or laboratory methods ( i.e. nasopharyngeal swab versus throat swab , the use of selective media ) , to certain characteristics of the population studied ( i.e. the age of the subjects , household characteristics - especially the presence of toddlers , presence of upper respiratory tract infection , vaccination status ) , or to seasonal variation .
our samples were taken in the rainy season , during which the incidence of respiratory tract infection , transmission of pathogens , and thus , carriage is likely to be somewhat increased .
the prevalence of s. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin and cotrimoxazole was high .
the national and local guidelines for empirical antibiotics for community - acquired pneumonia in children still recommend these two antibiotics as the first choices [ 16 ] , and those for meningitis recommend ampicillin for the second line [ 17 ] .
the commercially available 13 - valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ( pcv13 ) [ 18 ] , which was introduced only in 2011 in indonesia , provides approximately 45 % strain coverage for the infant population in this study , varying from 13 - 100 % across the city districts .
pcv10 , introduced in 2010 , provides a little bit lower coverage .
however , the coverage of the pcv13 over the serotype repertoir on lombok island in indonesia in the past [ 3 ] was 60 % and in other southeast asian countries , the coverage ranged from 63 % - 97 % [ 19 ] .
our results may , thus , not be taken to reflect the serotype distribution throughout indonesia , since the study was performed in a specific geographic location .
the pcvs have not been included in the national vaccination programs since information regarding the burden of pneumococala diseases in indonesia is still lacking .
rather , pneumococcal vaccines have been introduced in private clinics .
this vaccine is rather expensive for regular indonesian households that it is unlikely to even now have had any significant impact on the carriage of pneumococci observed in indonesia .
so far , studies in indonesia failed to reveal the burden of pneumococcal diseases in indonesia probably due to technical problems [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , thus , limiting the availability of data needed to develop appropriate policies and strategies to control pneumococcal disease , which is considered as one of the most important infectious diseases , in particular for toddlers and elderly worldwide .
this underscores the need for surveillance of pneumococcal disease in indonesia using locally implementable laboratory methods .
this study provides further evidence that passive smoking is an independent determinant of s. pneumoniae carriage among children [ 10 ] , [ 13 ] .
the mechanism by which passive smoking influences the microbial ecology of the upper respiratory tract remains to be elucidated , however .
in conclusion , nasopharyngeal carriage of s. pneumonia was common among healthy children and adults in this urban area of indonesia , and was determined , at least in part , by the presence of toddlers in the household and smoking habit of the adults .
the low coverage of commercially available vaccine against the serotypes found among children in this urban population , and the high proportion of non - susceptibility to penicillin and co - trimoxazol suggest the need for region - specific information and strategies to control s. pneumoniae .
a nation wide epidemiological study on pneumococcal carriage and disease throughout indonesia would provide such data and inform public health policies .

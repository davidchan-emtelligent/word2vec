triple negative breast cancer ( tnbc ) , which comprises approximately 15 % of all primary breast cancer diagnoses , lacks estrogen receptor alpha , progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression .
however , we , and others , have demonstrated that approximately 30 % of tnbcs express estrogen receptor beta ( erbeta ) , a nuclear hormone receptor and potential drug target .
treatment of erbeta expressing mda - mb - 231 cells with estrogen or the erbeta selective agonist , ly500307 , was shown to result in suppression of cell proliferation .
this inhibitory effect was due to blockade of cell cycle progression .
in vivo , estrogen treatment significantly repressed the growth of erbeta expressing mda - mb - 231 cell line xenografts .
gene expression studies and ingenuity pathway analysis identified a network of erbeta down - regulated genes involved in cell cycle progression including cdk1 , cyclin b and cyclin h. sirna mediated knockdown or drug inhibition of cdk1 and cdk7 in tnbc cells resulted in substantial decreases in proliferation regardless of erbeta expression .
these data suggest that the tumor suppressive effects of erbeta in tnbc result from inhibition of cell cycle progression , effects that are in part mediated by suppression of cdk1 / 7 .
furthermore , these data indicate that blockade of cdk1 / 7 activity in tnbc may be of therapeutic benefit , an area of study that has yet to be explored .
tnbc erbeta cell cycle cdk estrogen introduction triple negative breast cancer ( tnbc ) accounts for approximately 15 % of all breast cancers diagnosed [ 1 , 2 ] and is defined by the absence of estrogen receptor alpha ( eralpha ) , progesterone receptor ( pr ) , and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( her2 ) amplification [ 1 , 2 ] .
tnbc typically occurs in young , pre - menopausal women and is more prevalent in women of african - american decent [ 3 ] .
women diagnosed with tnbc usually present with larger tumors of higher grade that have spread to the lymph nodes [ 4 ] .
despite current treatment strategies which include surgery , chemotherapy , and radiation therapy , patients with tn disease are faced with a poor prognosis [ 5 ] .
in fact , 34 % of patients with newly diagnosed tnbc will develop recurrent disease within five years of diagnosis following aggressive chemotherapy treatment [ 5 ] .
therefore , a better understanding of the molecular pathways responsible for driving tnbc development and progression , and the concurrent identification of novel therapeutic drug targets , are vital steps to combatting this breast cancer subtype .
we have previously demonstrated that a second form of the estrogen receptor , erbeta , is expressed in approximately 30 % of tnbcs [ 6 ] and have shown that proliferation of erbeta + tnbc cell lines is significantly inhibited following estrogen treatment [ 6 - 8 ] .
a recent meta - analysis of erbeta expression in breast cancer showed significant associations with increased disease - free survival ( dfs ) and overall survival ( os ) in eralpha - negative patients [ 9 ] .
these data support the notion that drugs designed to specifically activate erbeta may elicit therapeutic benefit in the portion of tnbc patients with erbeta + disease .
past studies have suggested that one of the mechanisms by which erbeta functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer is through alterations in cell cycle progression [ 8 , 10 , 11 ] .
cell division is a well - orchestrated process that requires coordinated expression of key factors during specific points in the cell cycle in order to be successful .
these factors include cyclin - dependent kinases ( cdks ) which are heterodimeric serine / threonine kinases that depend on cyclins , their binding partners , for catalytic activity [ 12 , 13 ] .
in humans , there are 21 cdk genes [ 14 ] which are known to be positive regulators of cell proliferation , gene transcription and mrna processing [ 15 , 16 ] .
abnormal activation of cdks results in increased proliferation of cancer cells and genomic instability [ 17 ] .
for these reasons , inhibition of cdk activity has received significant attention as a therapeutic approach to treat multiple forms of cancer .
in breast cancer , cdk4 and cdk6 are among the most well studied cdks .
cdk4 and 6 interact with cyclin d to drive cell cycle progression from g0 to early g1 phase [ 18 ] .
palbociclib , an inhibitor of cdk4 and cdk6 , in combination with endocrine therapy resulted in improved progression - free survival ( pfs ) in eralpha +/ her2 negative advanced breast cancer [ 19 - 21 ] .
unfortunately , palbociclib does not inhibit proliferation in tnbc cell lines [ 19 , 22 ] although a recent study has demonstrated that blockade of cdk4 / 6 suppresses tnbc metastases [ 23 ] .
in the current study , we demonstrate that treatment of erbeta expressing tnbc cells with estrogen , or the erbeta selective agonist , ly500307 , results in suppression of proliferation through blockade of cell cycle progression .
furthermore , activation of erbeta was shown to significantly inhibit the growth of mda - mb - 231 cell line xenografts in vivo. from a mechanistic standpoint , ligand - mediated activation of erbeta results in the suppression of a network of genes involved in cell cycle progression including cdk1 , cdk7 , cyclin b and cyclin h. sirna - mediated depletion , or drug inhibition of cdk1 and cdk7 resulted in substantial decreases in tnbc cell proliferation , effects that were independent of erbeta expression .
taken together , these data suggest that the tumor suppressive effects of erbeta in tnbc are in part mediated by inhibition of genes involved in cell cycle progression and provide further support for the development of cdk1 and cdk7 specific inhibitors for the treatment of tnbc .
results the selective erbeta agonist , ly500307 , inhibits tnbc cellular proliferation we , and others , have shown that approximately 30 % of all tnbcs express erbeta [ 6 , 24 ] and that estrogen treatment of erbeta expressing tnbc cell lines results in decreased proliferation rates [ 6 , 7 ] .
using a doxycycline ( dox ) - inducible erbeta expressing mda - mb - 231 cell line generated in our laboratory , we have confirmed that ligand mediated transcriptional activation of erbeta with either estrogen or multiple doses of the highly selective erbeta agonist , ly500307 , ( figure 1a ) results in significant inhibition of tnbc cell proliferation following five days of treatment ( figure 1b ) .
all concentrations of ly500307 used in this study resulted in significant repression of cell proliferation relative to vehicle control treated cells , effects that were nearly identical to that of 1 nm estrogen treatment .
figure 1 estrogen , and the erbeta - agonist , ly500307 , activate erbeta transcriptional activity and decrease cell proliferation in tnbc cells a. a luciferase reporter construct containing an estrogen response element was transiently transfected into erbeta expressing mda - mb - 231 cells and subsequently treated as indicated for 24 hours prior to assessing luciferase activity. b. crystal violet assays indicating the effects of increasing concentrations of ly500307 , an erbeta - selective agonist , on mda - mb - 231 - erbeta cell proliferation rates relative to vehicle control or e2 treatment .
treatments were performed in the presence of doxycycline for five days .
* denotes significance at the p <= 0.05 level compared with vehicle control .
erbeta activation does not induce apoptosis given the observed decreases in tnbc cell proliferation following estrogen and erbeta selective agonist treatment , we next sought to determine if these compounds induced programmed cell death .
using an antibody based array , we analyzed the impact of 24 hours of estrogen treatment on the expression levels of 35 different apoptosis - related proteins in mda - mb - 231 - erbeta cells .
the expression levels of classic pro - apoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c , pro - caspase 3 , and fadd did not significantly change with treatment , nor did a number of anti - apoptotic proteins such as xiap , hif - 1alpha and ciap ( figure 2a and 2b ) .
furthermore , annexin v staining followed by flow cytometry did not indicate any induction of apoptosis following estrogen or ly500307 treatment for 24 hours or 5 days ( figure 2c and 2d ) .
instead , a decrease in the percentage of apoptotic cells ( as indicated by the number of cells in the upper - right quadrant of the scatterplot ) was observed following induction of erbeta expression , an effect that was further magnified in the setting of ligand treatment ( figure 2c and 2d ) .
these data indicate that erbeta - mediated decreases in tnbc cell proliferation are not due to the induction of programed cell death .
figure 2 effects of erbeta on apoptosis of tnbc cells a. and b. a protein - based apoptosis array was used to assess the effects of 1 nm e2 treatment ( 24 hours ) of erbeta expressing mda - mb - 231 cells on the expression levels of multiple pro - and anti - apoptotic proteins. c. and d. annexin v staining of mda - mb - 231 - erbeta cells following 24 hours and 5 days of treatment with vehicle , 1 nm estrogen or 10 nm ly500307 as determined by flow cytometry .
ligand mediated activation of erbeta induces cell cycle arrest based on the above findings , we next assessed the impact of estrogen and ly500307 on cell cycle progression .
following 24 hours or 5 days of treatment with estrogen or ly500307 , propidium iodide ( pi ) staining followed by flow cytometry analysis revealed a statistically significant accumulation of cells in the g1 phase of the cell cycle compared to vehicle - treated controls ( figure 3a and 3b ) .
these data indicate that the tumor suppressive effects of erbeta in tnbc cells primarily result from the induction of cell cycle arrest .

estrogen suppresses erbeta positive tnbc tumor growth in vivo given these in vitro findings , we next examined the effect of erbeta activation on mda - mb - 231 tumor growth in vivo .
one million mda - mb - 231 - erbeta - luc cells were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank of 6 - 8 week old ovariectomized female nude mice and tumors were allowed to form and progress to a tumor volume of approximately 100 mm3 .
following tumor establishment , animals were placed on doxycycline - containing chow and randomized to placebo or estrogen pellets .
tumor volume was determined weekly using calipers and luciferase readouts were captured using the ivis2000 xenogen machine after 8 weeks of treatment ( figure 4a and 4b ) .
animal weights were also measured weekly as a means of monitoring toxicities and no changes were observed during the course of the study .
estrogen treatment resulted in suppression of tumor progression as indicated by a significantly increased time to tumor doubling compared to placebo treated control animals ( figure 4c ) .
time to tumor tripling was also significantly increased in estrogen treated mice ( data not shown ) .
to confirm that erbeta expression was maintained throughout the course of the experiment , both mrna and protein levels were determined in residual tumors at the time of sacrifice by rt - pcr and western blotting ( figure 4d and 4e ) .
erbeta protein expression was also monitored by immunohistochemistry in tumor sections ( figure 4f ) .
all of these analyses demonstrated that erbeta expression was maintained and indicated that estrogen treatment may stabilize erbeta protein levels in vivo .
figure 4 estrogen inhibits mda - mb - 231 - erbeta cell line xenograft growth ovariectomized athymic nude mice harboring mda - mb - 231 - erbeta - luc cell line xenografts were randomized to placebo control or e2 treatment groups ( n = 8 animals per group ). a. tumor progression was monitored at 8 weeks via ivis2000 xenogen imaging and b. average total flux was quantified. c. time to tumor doubling was calculated following weakly tumor measurements and a log - rank test was used to assess difference between treatment groups. d. the level of erbeta mrna expression was determined in residual tumors isolated from placebo and e2 treated mice at the time of sacrifice by rt - pcr and was normalized to no dox / veh control treated cells. e. western blotting and f. immunohistochemistry of tumor lysates and ffpe tumor sections respectively indicating erbeta protein expression levels in residual tumors isolated from placebo and e2 treated mice .
* denotes significance at the p <= 0.05 level compared with vehicle control .
erbeta suppresses a network of genes pertaining to cdk1 and cdk7 function to determine the mechanisms by which activation of erbeta may elicit its tumor suppressive effects , we interrogated transcriptomic data collected from vehicle and estrogen treated mda - mb - 231 - erbeta cells that were generated in our laboratory ( data not shown ) .
ingenuity pathway analysis of estrogen regulated genes identified cell cycle regulation as one of the most significantly regulated networks ( figure 5a ) .
a heat map depicting the estrogen - regulated genes identified within this network is shown in figure 5b and indicates that the majority of these genes are suppressed in response to estrogen .
a number of cyclin - dependent kinases ( cdks ) and their respective binding partners were down - regulated including cdk1 ( cdc2 ) , cyclin b and cyclin h , while a number of keratins were upregulated .
the down - regulation of these targets was confirmed with qpcr analysis ( figure 5c ) .
decreased protein levels of cdk1 , the active form of cdk1 ( phospho - cdk1 ) and cyclin b1 were also observed in response to both estrogen and ly500307 treatment in erbeta expressing mda - mb - 231 cells ( figure 5d ) .
furthermore , we confirmed that the expression of cdk1 , cyclin b , and cyclin h were decreased in the mda - mb - 231 - erbeta xenograft tumors isolated from estrogen treated animals relative to placebo treated controls ( figure 5e ) .
these data demonstrate that a number of important cell cycle - related genes are repressed by estrogen and ly500307 treatment in erbeta expressing tnbc cells .

inhibition of cdk1 and cdk7 suppresses tnbc cell proliferation since estrogen and ly500307 resulted in decreased expression of cdk1 and cdk7 , we sought to further analyze the roles of these two proteins in regulating cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in tnbc cells .
as a first step , we performed sirna - mediated knockdown of cdk1 and cdk7 in mda - mb - 231 cells .
a pool of cdk1 or cdk7 sirnas was shown to substantially decrease the mrna ( figure 6a and 6c ) and protein levels ( figure 6b and 6d ) for each of these genes .
interestingly , knockdown of cdk7 also resulted in decreased expression of its binding partner , cyclin h , as well as the phosphorylation of serine 5 at the c - terminal domain of rna polymerase ii ( figure 6d ) .
sirna - mediated suppression of cdk1 and cdk7 also resulted in significant decreases in the proliferation rates of mda - mb - 231 cells , effects that were independent of the presence or absence of erbeta expression ( figure 6e ) .
to confirm these effects , dose - response curves were generated using the cdk1 inhibitor , dinaciclib ( figure 6f ) , and the cdk7 inhibitor , bs - 181 ( figure 6g ) .
proliferation assays revealed potent inhibition of mda - mb - 231 proliferation rates by both drugs in erbeta + ( dox ) and erbeta - ( no dox ) cell lines after six days .
as seen with sirna knockdown , drug inhibition of cdk7 with bs - 181 at or above the ic50 , also showed altered protein levels of total rna polymerase ii and rna polymerase ii phospho - serine 5 ( figure 6h ) .
these data demonstrate that knockdown , or drug - mediated inhibition , of cdk1 and cdk7 results in decreased proliferation in tnbc cells regardless of erbeta expression .
in addition , cdk7 inhibition also has an effect on the phosphorylation of rna polymerase ii and therefore might play a dual role in cell cycle progression and transcription .
figure 6 inhibition of cdk1 and cdk7 decreases proliferation of tnbc cells sirna - mediated knockdown of cdk1 a. and b. and cdk7 c. and d. in mda - mb - 231 - erbeta cells were verified at both the mrna and protein level .
the impact of cdk1 ( b ) and cdk7 ( d ) knockdown on the protein expression levels of their respective binding partners , cyclin b and cyclin h , as well as rna polymerase ii phospho - serine 5 for sicdk7 treated cells , are shown .

the effects of four hours of drug mediated inhibition of cdk7 on the protein levels of total rna polymerase ii and rna polymerase ii phospho - serine 5 were also examined h. vinculin is shown as a loading control .
* denotes significance at the p <= 0.05 level compared to controls .
impact of cdk1 and cdk7 inhibition on tnbc cell cycle progression to further elucidate the roles of cdk1 and cdk7 in modulating tnbc cell proliferation , we next analyzed the effects of sirna - mediated knockdown of these two genes on cell cycle progression .
as shown in figure 7 , knockdown of cdk1 resulted in a dramatic accumulation of mda - mb - 231 cells in the g2 - phase ( 45 %) of the cell cycle relative to scrambled sirna controls ( figure 7a and 7b ) .
interestingly , knockdown of cdk7 did not have a significant effect on cell cycle progression ( figure 7a and 7b ) in spite of the fact that cell proliferation rates were decreased under these same conditions ( figure 6e ) .
this effect could in part be due to cdk7 's role in transcription where it is known to phosphorylate the c - terminal domain of rna polymerase ii at serine 5 [ 25 ] .
drug mediated inhibition of cdk1 with dinaciclib also resulted in a g2 arrest ( figure 7c and 7d ) similar to that of the sirna .
blockade of cdk7 with bs - 181 had no significant effect on cell cycle progression ( figure 7c and 7d ) as was also shown to be the case in cdk7 sirna transfected cells .
overall these data demonstrate that suppression of cdk1 results in a g2 phase cell cycle arrest while blockade of cdk7 function has no impact on cell cycle progression of tnbc cells .

transfections were performed with a pool of the two cdk1 or cdk7 sirnas , or the control sirna , at a final concentration of 25 nm .

discussion erbeta is a tumor suppressor whose expression is associated with a better prognosis in breast cancer [ 6 , 26 - 35 ] .
as erbeta is expressed in approximately 30 % of tnbcs we sought to determine the therapeutic potential of targeting erbeta in tnbc .
in this manuscript , we demonstrate that ligand - mediated activation of erbeta with estrogen , or the erbeta selective agonist ly500307 , resulted in anti - proliferative effects in vitro and suppression of tumor progression in vivo .
activation of erbeta was shown to induce cell cycle arrest , but not apoptosis .
erbeta was also shown to inhibit the expression of a number of cell cycle - related genes both in vitro and in vivo including cdk1 , cyclin b , and cyclin h. sirna and drug mediated inhibition of cdk1 resulted in decreased proliferation of mda - mb - 231 cells due to a g2 / m phase cell cycle arrest , effects that were independent of erbeta expression .
inhibition of cdk7 using sirna and bs - 181 resulted in decreased proliferation of tnbc cells , but had no effect on cell cycle progression .
in this manuscript , we report for the first time that low concentrations of ly500307 , a potent erbeta selective agonist , can not only activate erbeta but also suppress proliferation of erbeta expressing tnbc cells .
these anti - proliferative effects are an extension of previous studies by our laboratory and others demonstrating that ligand - mediated activation of erbeta results in anti - proliferative effects in multiple cancer cell lines [ 6 - 8 , 36 ] .
in addition , we showed that estrogen treatment of mice harboring erbeta + mda - mb - 231 xenografts results in significant inhibition of tumor growth , and in some animals induced complete tumor regression .
these findings are in agreement with a previous collaborative study with dr. wei xu 's group in which estrogen treatment induced anti - tumor effects in erbeta expressing mda - mb - 468 xenografts [ 8 ] .
previous findings from our laboratory have demonstrated that estrogen treatment of erbeta expressing hs578t tnbc cells inhibits proliferation primarily by inducing a g1 cell cycle arrest [ 7 ] .
we have confirmed these observations in the present study using mda - mb - 231 - erbeta cells .
in the mda - mb - 231 - erbeta model , we also observed a slight , but insignificant , increase in g2 arrest .
these findings agree with previous studies that have linked ligand - mediated activation of erbeta to both g1 and g2 cell cycle arrest in multiple types of cancer cell lines [ 10 , 11 , 37 - 40 ] .
in addition to cell cycle analysis , we performed an annexin v / pi assay to determine if programmed - cell death contributed to the observed decreased rates of proliferation .
interestingly , when erbeta is expressed , the basal number of cells undergoing apoptosis decreased compared to when erbeta is absent .
these effects of erbeta on decreased rates of apoptosis have been observed previously and may be related to the decreased rates of cell growth [ 41 ] .
these data indicated that alterations in apoptosis do not contribute to the tumor suppressive effects of erbeta in this model system and instead that the majority of this phenotype is driven by increases in cell cycle arrest .
to understand the potential mechanisms of action by which erbeta suppresses cell cycle progression , we performed ingenuity pathway analysis on existing gene expression studies conducted by our laboratory .
in this analysis , one of the most significantly altered biological pathways following estrogen treatment of mda - mb - 231 - erbeta cells was a network of genes involved in cell cycle regulation .
among these genes were cdk1 , cyclin b and cyclin h which were all significantly suppressed by estrogen treatment .
unliganded erbeta has previously been shown to repress the expression of cyclin b1 , which in turn decreases the activity of cdk1 and results in a g2 cell cycle arrest in mcf7 cells [ 10 ] .
another interesting observation was that a number of keratins were also upregulated .
keratins are known markers of differentiation that can be associated with histological grade , however , no observations of differential tumor histology were observed in the animal xenografts [ 42 , 43 ] .
to the best of our knowledge , our findings are the first to report that erbeta suppresses the functions of cdk1 and cdk7 ( through suppression of cyclin h ) in tnbc .
since cdk1 is required for mitosis , approaches to target the cdk1 - cyclin b complex are appealing for cancer therapy .
in fact , agents targeting cdk1 or cyclin b have been shown to effectively block tumor growth and progression of multiple forms of cancer [ 44 - 48 ] .
while a pure cdk1 inhibitor does not yet exist , a number of pan - cdk inhibitors , including dinaciclib , have been developed [ 49 , 50 ] .
dinacilib targets cdk1 , cdk2 , cdk5 and cdk9 with in vitro ic50 values of 3 nm 1 nm , 1 nm and 4 nm , respectively .
at the concentrations utilized in this study , dinaciclib would have an effect on all four of these cdks .
our results demonstrated a potent g2 / m cell cycle arrest indicative of cdk1 inhibition in tnbc cells and significantly decreased proliferation rate .
these findings correlate well with other pre - clinical studies demonstrating inhibition of cell proliferation by sirna mediated suppression or dinaciclib treatment in other types of cancer cell lines [ 22 , 50 - 53 ] .
furthermore , clinical studies of dinaciclib have demonstrated efficacy in both solid tumors and relapsed multiple myeloma with a manageable safety profile [ 54 , 55 ] .
in addition to cdk1 , we also demonstrated that cdk7 function is likely to be repressed given the decreased expression of cyclin h following estrogen treatment of erbeta expressing mda - mb - 231 cells and xenograft tumors .
cdk7 knockdown was shown to decrease cyclin h protein levels , an effect that has also been observed in a previous report [ 56 ] .
cdk7 , unlike other cdks , plays a dual role in regulating both cell cycle progression and transcription [ 57 , 58 ] .
in regard to cell cycle progression , inhibition of cdk7 , specifically during the g2 - phase of the cell cycle , prevents entry into mitosis by disrupting the assembly and phosphorylation of the cdk1 - cyclin b complex [ 59 ] .
on the other hand , cdk7 plays an important role in transcription where it phosphorylates serine 5 at the c - terminal domain of rna polymerase ii [ 58 ] .
here we demonstrate that knockdown or drug inhibition of cdk7 did indeed have an effect on the phosphorylation of rna polymerase ii at serine 5 .
in the present report , inhibition of cdk7 resulted in decreased proliferation of tnbc cells , which could be due to the transcriptional activity of cdk7 rather than its influence on cell cycle progression as no effect was observed .
these findings are in agreement with a previous study demonstrating that some tnbc cells are " addicted " to cdk7 mediated transcription , and that suppression of cdk7 function elicits tumor suppressive effects [ 59 ] .
in conclusion , these data indicate that ligand - mediated activation of erbeta in tnbc cells results in decreased proliferation rates , cell cycle arrest and suppression of tumor growth .
these effects are likely mediated in part by suppression of cdk1 and cdk7 function .
we provide further evidence that inhibition of cdk1 and cdk7 expression / function also results in decreased proliferation of tnbc cells , effects that are independent of erbeta expression or estrogen treatment .
these findings support the notion that cdk1 and cdk7 serve as clinically relevant therapeutic targets in tnbc , an area of study that has yet to be fully explored .

background twelve years ago , a randomized trial demonstrated that a radiosurgery boost added to whole - brain radiotherapy ( wbrt ) improved intracerebral control ( ic ) in patients with one to three cerebral metastases .
overall survival ( os ) was improved only in the subgroup of patients with a single metastasis but not in the entire cohort .
the present study compared both regimens in a different scenario outside a randomized trial .
methods a total of 252 patients with one to three cerebral metastases were included .
eighty - four patients receiving wbrt plus a planned stereotactic boost and 168 patients receiving wbrt alone were individually matched 1:2 for nine factors including fractionation of wbrt , age , gender , performance score , primary tumor , number of cerebral metastases , extracerebral metastases , recursive partitioning analysis class , and time between cancer diagnosis and wbrt .
each group of three patients was required to match for all nine factors .
both groups were compared for ic and os. results ic rates at 6 , 12 , 18 and 24 months were 88 , 71 , 45 and 22 % after wbrt plus stereotactic boost vs. 75 , 48 , 38 and 22 % after wbrt alone ( p = 0.005 ) .
os rates at 6 , 12 , 18 and 24 months were 76 , 53 , 32 and 25 % after wbrt plus stereotactic boost and 67 , 45 , 29 and 20 % after wbrt alone ( p = 0.10 ) .
in patients with a single lesion , os rates were also not significantly different ( p = 0.12 ) .
conclusions similar to the previous randomized trial from 2004 , this matched - pair study showed that a stereotactic boost in addition to wbrt significantly improved ic but not os. keywords cerebral metastases whole - brain radiotherapy stereotactic boost intracerebral control overall survival issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction about 40 % of all cancer patients who developed cerebral metastases present with up to three lesions [ 1 , 2 ] .
these patients have a more favorable survival than those patients with more metastases .
it has been suggested that patients with up to three lesions may benefit from local therapies such as neurosurgical resection , stereotactic radiosurgery ( srs ) and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy ( fsrt ) [ 2 ] .
the optimal treatment approach is yet to be defined .
several randomized trials demonstrated that wbrt plus a stereotactic boost resulted in better intracerebral control ( ic ) than srs alone without improving overall survival ( os ) [ 3 - 6 ] .
since both intracerebral recurrence and wbrt can decrease neurocognitive function , it is not absolutely clear , whether srs alone is appropriate for one to three cerebral metastases or whether wbrt plus srs is best [ 7 - 9 ] .
only two randomized trials compared srs plus wbrt to wbrt alone [ 10 , 11 ] .
both were published more than 12 years ago .
one trial was stopped early after inclusion of 27 patients [ 10 ] , and the other ( rtog 9508 ) was completed after inclusion of 333 patients [ 11 ] .
thus , there is only one trial with adequate statistical power that compared srs plus wbrt and wbrt [ 11 ] .
according to its results , an srs boost significantly improved intracerebral control ( ic ) .
os was not improved for the entire cohort but in the subgroup of patients with a single metastasis .
the present study compared wbrt plus a planned stereotactic boost to wbrt alone in a different scenario outside a randomized trial with respect to os and ic , which was defined as freedom from a recurrence anywhere in the brain .
the study was performed as a matched - pair - analysis , where patients of the two treatment groups were required to individually match for nine factors .
since another randomized trial would be difficult to perform , a matched - pair study is the best alternative design to reduce the risk of selection biases .
patients and methods a total of 252 patients with a karnofsky performance score ( kps ) of >= 70 were irradiated for one to three newly diagnosed cerebral metastases ( size <= 4 cm ) from 1998 to 2014 and included in this matched - pair study .
the diagnosis of cerebral metastases was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .
eighty - four patients received wbrt followed by a planned stereotactic boost to the metastatic lesions and 168 patients received wbrt alone .
these patients were part of an anonymized database of 2160 patients irradiated for brain metastases .
treatment did depend on institutional preferences and physicians' choices at certain periods of time .
patients of both treatment groups were individually matched 1:2 with respect to nine characteristics / potential prognostic factors , which was done to decrease biases due to imbalances of these potential prognostic factors .
these characteristics included fractionation of wbrt ( 5x4 gy in 1 week vs. longer - course wbrt , i.e. 10x3 gy in 2 weeks or 20x2 gy in 4 weeks ) , age at the time of wbrt (<= 58 years vs. >= 59 years , median age = 58 years ) , gender , kps ( 70 vs. >= 80 ) , type of primary tumor ( breast cancer vs. lung cancer vs. other cancers ) , number of cerebral metastases ( single vs. multiple , i.e. 2 - 3 ) , extracerebral metastases ( no vs. yes ) , recursive partitioning analysis ( rpa ) class ( 1 vs. 2 ) , and time interval between cancer diagnosis and start of wbrt (<= 15 months vs. >= 16 months , median 16 months ) .
patients treated in the netherlands received 5x4 gy , and those patients treated in germany longer - course wbrt .
thus , 5x4 gy was not given preferentially to patients with a poor prognosis .
median size of the treated lesions was 11 mm ( range : 5 - 32 mm ) in the wbrt plus srs group and 14.5 mm ( range : 4 - 40 mm ) in the wbrt alone group , respectively .
distributions of these characteristics are summarized in table 1 .

the stereotactic boost was administered with a linear accelerator in 76 patients ( dose prescribed to the margin of the metastatic lesions , representing the 80 - 90 % isodose line ) and with a gammaknife in eight patients ( dose prescribed to the margin of the metastatic lesions , representing the 50 - 60 % isodose line ) .
the gamma knife treatment was performed as single - fraction radiosurgery in all eight patients .
in those 76 patients receiving their stereotactic boost from a linear accelerator , 59 received single - fraction radiosurgery , and 17 patients fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy ( fsrt ) with two to five fractions of 4 - 8 gy. fsrt was generally administered in patients with at least one metastatic lesion located in or close to the brainstem or other critical structures .
the median dose of radiosurgery was 20 gy ( range : 15 - 25 gy ) , and the median total dose of fsrt 18 gy ( range : 12 - 40 gy ) .
the two treatment groups were compared for ic and os. ic was defined as freedom from development of new cerebral metastases and progression of the treated cerebral lesions .
new and progressive cerebral metastases were identified by magnetic resonance imaging performed at regular intervals ( 3 to 4 months ) and for progressive clinical symptoms .
both ic and os were referenced from the start of radiotherapy .
univariate analyses for both endpoints were performed with the kaplan - meier method supplemented by the wilcoxon test to determine the differences between the corresponding curves [ 12 ] .
p - values of < 0.05 were considered significant .
additional multivariate analyses were not required , since the patients of both treatment groups were individually matched 1:2 taking into account nine factors .
each group of three patients matched for all factors .
thus , the risk of a selection bias was lower with this method of than with the method of propensity score matching .
results patients were followed until death or for a median of 11 months ( range : 4 - 54 months ) .
in the entire cohort , the ic rates at 6 , 12 , 18 and 24 months were 80 , 56 , 40 and 22 % , respectively .
ic rates after wbrt plus a stereotactic boost were 88 , 71 , 45 and 22 % , respectively , versus 75 , 48 , 38 and 22 % , respectively , after wbrt alone ( p = 0.005 , fig. 1 ). fig. 1 comparison of the two treatment groups wbrt plus stereotactic boost and wbrt alone with respect to intracerebral control median survival times in the entire cohort , the wbrt plus stereotactic boost group and the wbrt alone group were 11 , 14 and 11 months , respectively .
in the entire cohort , os rates at 6 , 12 , 18 and 24 months were 70 , 48 , 30 and 22 % , respectively .
os rates after wbrt plus a stereotactic boost were 76 , 53 , 32 and 25 % , respectively , vs. 67 , 45 , 29 and 20 % , respectively , after wbrt alone ( p = 0.10 , fig. 2 ). fig. 2 comparison of the two treatment groups wbrt plus stereotactic boost and wbrt alone with respect to overall survival in accordance with a previous randomized trial [ 11 ] , a subgroup analysis for os was performed in the 120 patients with a single cerebral lesion .
in this subgroup , the os rates at 6 , 12 , 18 and 24 months were 72 , 54 , 30 and 23 % , respectively .
os rates after wbrt plus a stereotactic boost were 83 , 64 , 34 and 30 % , respectively , vs. 67 , 49 , 29 and 18 % , respectively , after wbrt alone ( p = 0.12 ) .
discussion most cancer patients with one to three cerebral metastases are treated with radiotherapy alone .
several radiotherapy approaches exist including wbrt alone , srs or fsrt alone , and wbrt plus a stereotactic boost ( srs or fsrt ) .
several randomized trials compared srs alone to srs plus wbrt [ 3 - 6 ] .
aoyama et al. presented a trial of 132 patients with one to four cerebral metastases , 67 treated with srs and 65 with srs plus wbrt [ 3 ] .
wbrt significantly improved ic at 12 months ( 53 % vs. 24 % , p < 0.001 ) but not os ( 39 % vs. 28 % , p = 0.42 ) .
in 2009 , chang et al. reported a randomized trial of 58 patients with one to three cerebral metastases that was stopped after an interim analysis , since the decline in neurocognitive function at 4 months was significantly worse in the srs plus wbrt group than in the srs alone group ( mean posterior probability of decline 52 % vs. 24 %) [ 4 ] .
ic rates at 12 months were 73 % after srs plus wbrt and 27 % after srs alone ( p < 0.001 ) .
unfortunately , neurocognitive function was not assessed at 12 months .
os rates were not significantly different .
in the third randomized trial comparing srs plus wbrt to srs alone , both srs and neurosurgical resection were allowed and compared to the same procedures plus wbrt .
in the subgroup of 199 patients treated with srs , 100 patients received srs alone and 99 patients srs plus wbrt .
wbrt significantly improved local control of the treated lesions ( p = 0.040 ) and freedom from new cerebral metastases ( p = 0.008 ) at 2 years .
similar to the previous two trials , os was not significantly improved with wbrt .
in the most recent trial of 213 patients with one to three cerebral metastases , cognitive progression at 3 months was significantly more severe in the srs plus wbrt group .
time to intracranial failure was significantly shorter after srs alone than after srs plus wbrt ( p < 0.001 ) .
median os times were 10.4 months vs. 7.4 months ( p = 0.92 ) .
when summarizing these trials , it appears that wbrt in addition to srs significantly improves ic but not os [ 3 - 6 ] .
unfortunately , wbrt also leads to more pronounced neurocognitive dysfunction .
however , an intracerebral recurrence can be associated with impairment of neurocognitive function .
thus , the omission of wbrt may not be best in all situations .
a recent meta - analysis of three trials [ 3 - 5 ] suggested omitting wbrt in patients aged <= 50 years [ 13 ] .
the risk of developing neurocognitive decline can be reduced by using doses per fraction considerably lower than 3 gy and avoiding concomitant chemotherapy [ 14 , 15 ] .
furthermore , hippocampus sparing wbrt offers an additional approach to reduce the risk of neurocognitive decline .
in the study of gondi et al. , who used the hopkins verbal learning test - revised for delayed recall ( hvlt - r dr ) , the rates of decline at 4 months vs. baseline were 7 % with hippocampal sparing and 30 % in a historic control group ( p < 0.001 ) [ 16 ] .
in a randomized trial of 508 eligible patients , memantine in addition to wbrt ( 20 mg / d , starting 3 days prior to wbrt for 24 weeks ) showed a strong trend towards less decline in delayed recall at 24 weeks when compared to wbrt without memantine ( p = 0.059 ) .
significantly better results were found for several endpoints including executive function at 16 weeks ( p = 0.008 ) , processing speed at 24 weeks ( p = 0.014 ) and delayed recognition at 24 weeks ( p = 0.015 ) .
when using these new options to lower the risk of wbrt - induced neurocognitive decline , wbrt should still be considered an option for patients with one to three cerebral metastases .
in this light , one important question is whether results of wbrt can be improved with a stereotactic boost ?
two randomized trials were reported so far that compared wbrt with and without a stereotactic boost [ 10 , 11 ] .
one small trial of patients with two to four lesions was stopped after inclusion of 27 patients [ 10 ] .
one - year local failure rates were 8 % after wbrt plus srs and 100 % after wbrt alone ( p = 0.002 ) .
median os times were not significantly different ( 11 vs. 7.5 months , p = 0.22 ) .
the other randomized trial included 331 eligible patients with one to three cerebral metastases and a kps of >= 70 ( rpa class 1 or 2 ) [ 11 ] .
in this trial , srs in addition to wbrt significantly improved local control of the treated lesions at 1 year ( 82 % vs 71 % , p = 0.01 ) .
ic , which was defined as increase in size of any lesion , new cerebral lesions or neurological deterioration despite stable disease on mri , was also significantly improved ( p = 0.013 ) .
however , ic rates were not explicitly stated .
an os benefit was limited to patients with a single cerebral metastasis .
median survival times were 6.5 and 4.9 months , respectively ( p = 0.039 ) , whereas in the entire cohort os was not significantly different ( 6.5 vs 5.7 months , p = 0.14 ) .
similar to the previous trial ( p = 0.013 ) , the addition of a stereotactic boost significantly improved ic in the present study ( p = 0.005 ) [ 11 ] .
os was not significantly affected in the entire series , which agreed well with the results of the two previous randomized studies [ 10 , 11 ] .
in the rtog 9508 trial , an os benefit was found in patients with a single cerebral metastasis .
this result was not confirmed in the present study , although a certain trend was observed ( p = 0.12 ) .
one may speculate whether the number of 120 patients with a single lesion in the present study was too small to provide adequate statistical power to detect a significant difference .
the number of patients with a single lesion in the rtog 9508 trial was greater ( n = 186 ) .
furthermore , although this matched - pair study followed very strict matching criteria ( individual matching for nine factors ) the source of data still is retrospective in nature .
in case of retrospective data , the risk of a hidden selection bias always remains .
one potential selection bias may have been introduced due to the difference regarding the size of the treated lesions that were slightly smaller in the wbrt plus srs group .
when reflecting the results of the two randomized trials [ 10 , 11 ] and the present study , it appears that a stereotactic boost in addition to wbrt significantly improves local and intracerebral control .
since an intracerebral recurrence may lead to severe symptoms and even death , a stereotactic boost can be recommended for patients with one to three cerebral metastases selected for wbrt .
this recommendation is supported by other results of the rtog 9508 trial [ 11 ] .
the stereotactic boost led to improved functional autonomy in all patients and improved os in patients with a single lesion .
the recommendation applies to the majority of patients with few cerebral metastases .
in a study that developed a score to predict the probability of developing new metastases after srs alone , only 22 % ( 47 / 214 ) of patients were considered good candidates srs alone [ 17 ] .
when adding a stereotactic boost to wbrt two additional aspects need to be considered .
a stereotactic boost will likely be associated with an increased risk of radionecrosis , particularly when combined with modern targeted therapies such as ipilimumab that are increasingly used in cancer patients [ 18 , 19 ] .
another aspect , which needs to be considered , is cost - effectiveness [ 18 ] .
in a cost - effectiveness analysis published in 2015 that compared neuro - cognitive sparing radiotherapy programs to wbrt alone in patients with one to three brain metastases , hippocampal sparing wbrt plus a stereotactic boost proved to be cost - effective when compared to wbrt alone in patient groups with a median survival pf 12 months or longer following radiotherapy [ 20 ] .
moreover , wbrt plus a boost to the metatatic sites can be safely perfomed with volumetric modulated arc therapy ( vmat ) in one course as wbrt plus a simultaneous integrated boost ( sib ) [ 21 ] .
conclusion a stereotactic boost in addition to wbrt resulted in significantly better ic than wbrt alone without significantly improving os. since an intracerebral recurrence can cause major symptoms and even death , ic must be considered an important goal .
therefore , the addition of a stereotactic boost to wbrt should be considered for patients with very few cerebral metastases , who were identified as candidates for wbrt and not for srs alone .

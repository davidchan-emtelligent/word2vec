background sodium lactate seemed to improve fluid balance and avoid fluid overload .
the objective of this study was to determine if these beneficial effects can be at least partly explained by an improvement in disseminated intravascular coagulation ( dic ) - associated renal microvascular thrombosis .
methods ancillary work of an interventional randomized open label controlled experimental study .
fifteen female " large white " pigs ( 2 months old ) were challenged with intravenous infusion of e. coli endotoxin .
three groups of five animals were randomly assigned to receive different fluids : a treatment group received sodium lactate 11.2 % ( sl group ) ; an isotonic control group received 0.9 % nacl ( nc group ) ; a hypertonic control group , with the same amount of osmoles and sodium than sl group , received sodium bicarbonate 8.4 % ( sb group ) .
glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) markers , coagulation and inflammation parameters were measured over a 5 - h period .
immediately after euthanasia , kidneys were withdrawn for histological study .
statistical analysis was performed with nonparametric tests and the dunn correction for multiple comparisons .
a p < 0.05 was considered significant .
results the direct immunofluorescence study revealed that the percentage of capillary sections thrombosed in glomerulus were significantly lesser in sl group [ 5 ( 0 - 28 ) %] compared to nc [ 64 ( 43 - 79 ) % , p = 0.01 ] and sb [ 64 ( 43 - 79 ) , p = 0.03 ] groups .
alterations in platelet count and fibrinogen level occurred earlier and were significantly more pronounced in both control groups compared to sl group ( p < 0.05 at 210 and 300 min ) .
the increase in thrombin - antithrombin complexes was significantly higher in nc [ 754 ( 367 - 945 ) mug / ml ; p = 0.03 ] and sb [ 463 ( 249 - 592 ) mug / ml ; p = 0.03 ] groups than in sl group [ 176 ( 37 - 265 ) mug / ml ] .
at the end of the experiment , creatinine clearance was significantly higher in sl group [ 55.46 ( 30.07 - 67.85 ) ml / min ] compared to nc group [ 1.52 ( 0.17 - 27.67 ) ml / min , p = 0.03 ] .
conclusions in this study , we report that sodium lactate improves dic - associated renal microvascular thrombosis and preserves gfr .
these findings could at least partly explain the better fluid balance observed with sodium lactate infusion .
keywords septic shock fluid resuscitation lactate infusion glomerular filtration rate disseminated intravascular coagulation renal histology issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 background sepsis , considered today as a syndrome of physiologic , pathologic and biochemical abnormalities induced by infection [ 1 ] , is a major public health concern responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality [ 2 ] .
sepsis is frequently complicated by acute kidney injury , which is associated with higher risk of in - hospital mortality [ 3 , 4 ] , and by disseminated intravascular coagulation ( dic ) due to a massive activation of the coagulation system [ 5 , 6 ] .
many studies imply that dic is an important mediator in both microvascular thrombosis , multiple organ failure syndrome development [ 7 ] and mortality in patients with serious infections [ 8 ] .
sepsis is also associated with deficit in effective blood volume .
large amounts of intravenous fluids are commonly used to increase cardiac output and improve peripheral blood flow [ 9 ] .
first , mounting evidence suggests that resuscitation fluids contribute , in varying degrees , to clinically relevant renal [ 10 , 11 ] and haemostatic disturbances , particularly if artificial colloids such as hydroxyethyl starch ( hes ) and gelatine or saline preparations are used .
the undesirable consequences of using hes resulted in a strong recommendation [ 9 ] against the use of hes in resuscitation of patients with sepsis [ 12 , 13 ] .
moreover , saline with the presence of supraphysiological concentrations of chloride may increase the incidence of acute kidney injury and the use of renal replacement therapy [ 14 - 16 ] .
secondly , aggressive use of large - volume intravenous fluids induces fluid overload which is associated with renal failure [ 17 , 18 ] and leads to hemodilution , which in turn may exacerbate coagulopathy [ 19 ] .
in order to reduce the volume of intravenous solutions , the concept of small volume resuscitation with hypertonic saline and / or hypertonic saline - hes or dextran has been widely studied during trauma resuscitation [ 20 , 21 ] .
the potential of these hypertonic fluids to modulate the coagulation cascade is less well known , as data are limited and contradictory [ 22 ] .
anyway , hypertonic solutions containing hes and / or saline could increase acute kidney injury in sepsis as far as isotonic fluids .
hence , in an attempt to avoid the detrimental effects of chloride anion and / or hes , the use of metabolized anions such as lactate could be more suitable .
the use of lactate , as a resuscitation fluid - based energetic substrate , is an interesting alternative because this anion is well metabolized [ 23 ] even in poor hemodynamic conditions [ 24 ] .
we previously observed that sodium lactate infusion enhanced fluid balance in pig endotoxic shock [ 25 , 26 ] .
this beneficial effect of sodium lactate could not be totally explained neither by its hyperosmolar or alkalizing effects [ 25 ] nor by its energy load or its effect on the chloride balance [ 26 ] .
finally , two additional mechanisms have been hypothesized : first , lactate infusion is better metabolized in poor hemodynamic conditions than glucose , and second , lactate could decrease proinflammatory response and / or improve endothelial barrier function .
interestingly , it is well known that proinflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction exacerbate the endotoxin - induced dic [ 27 , 28 ] .
so , in order to better understand the beneficial effect of sodium lactate on fluid balance , we conducted an ancillary work focused on dic and renal histology .
the main objective of the present study was to determine if sodium lactate improve dic - associated renal microvascular thrombosis .
the secondary objective was to explore the glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) .
methods this is an ancillary work of a recent experimental study on the beneficial hemodynamic and metabolic effects of sodium lactate infusion in endotoxic shock [ 26 ] .
the experimental protocol ( ceea no. 132012 ) received the approval of the nord - pas - de - calais animal ethics committee ( comite d'ethique en experimentation animale nord - pas - de - calais ; c2ea - 75 ) and the french ministry of education and research .
care and handling of the animals were in accordance with the experimental animal use guidelines of the french ministry of agriculture and food .
animal preparation for the experiment , animals were premedicated with intramuscular injection of ketamine ( ketalar ( r ) , virbac , france , 2.5 mg / kg of body weight ) and xylazine ( sedaxylan ( r ) , ceva sante animale , france , 2.5 mg / kg of body weight ) .
then , we used isoflurane ( aerrane ( r ) , baxter , france ) for the intubation process , and maintenance of anaesthesia was performed with a continuous infusion of midazolam ( hypnovel ( r ) , roche , france , 1 mg / kg body weight / h ) for the whole experiment .
all animals were mechanically ventilated ( osiris 2 ( r ) , taema , france ) with a tidal volume of 8 ml / kg , a positive end - expiratory pressure set at 4 cm h2o to limit cardiovascular effects , fio2 0.6 to prevent fatal hypoxaemia during the study , and respiratory rate 20 - 24 breaths / min only adjusted to maintain normocapnia ( 40 - 45 mmhg ) at baseline .
we chose to maintain ventilation similar in all animals during the experiment .
no recruitment manoeuvres were done .
muscle relaxation was obtained by a continuous intravenous infusion of cisatracurium besylate ( nimbex ( r ) , hospira , france , 2 mg / kg body weight / h ) .
analgesia was achieved by a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine ( vetergesic ( r ) , sogeval , france , 0.1 mg / kg body weight ) .
after dissection of neck vessels , catheters were inserted in the right carotid artery for continuous blood pressure monitoring and blood sampling .
to monitor urine output , a suprapubic urinary catheter was inserted .
study design fifteen female " large white " pigs ( 2 months old ) were used in this study .
the study was carried out as depicted in fig. 1. during preparation period , animals received 25 ml / kg 0.9 % nacl to prevent hypovolemia .
measurements were taken over a 5 - h period : at baseline after the stabilization period ( t0 ) and at 60 ( t60 ) , 120 ( t120 ) , 210 ( t210 ) and 300 ( t300 ) minutes .
all animals were administered 5 mug / kg / min escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) ( serotype 055 : b5 ; sigma chemical co. , st. louis , mo , usa ) .
the endotoxin was diluted in 50 ml of 0.9 % nacl and infused over a 30 - min period intravenously .
we studied three groups receiving 450 ml ( from t30 to t300 ) of different fluids as follows : a treatment group ( n = 5 ) receiving 11.2 % hypertonic sodium lactate ap - hp ( r ) ( ageps , paris , france ) ( sl group ) containing 90 g ( 1000 mmol ) of lactate and 23 g ( 1000 mmol ) of sodium per litre and two control groups ; one isotonic control group ( n = 5 ) receiving 0.9 % nacl ( nc group ) , and one hypertonic control group ( n = 5 ) receiving 8.4 % hypertonic sodium bicarbonate ( sb group ) containing 61 g ( 1000 mmol ) of bicarbonate and 23 g ( 1000 mmol ) of sodium per litre .
sodium bicarbonate provided the same amount of sodium ( 450 mmol ) and osmoles ( 900 mosm ) , and the same alkalizing effect than sodium lactate [ 25 ] .
the sl group received 40.5 g lactate ( 3.61 kcal / g ) .
nc and sb groups received an equivalent energy supply : 39 g glucose ( 3.75 kcal / g ) as 780 ml 5 % glucose solution ( baxter sas , guyancourt , france ) from t30 to t300 .
finally , the sl group received 780 ml sterile water for injection ( baxter sas , guyancourt , france ) in place of the 5 % glucose solution to ensure the same fluid intake in the three groups .
the only resuscitation endpoint was mean arterial pressure ( map ) .
if map felt below 65 mmhg , 2.5 ml / kg infusion of nacl 0.9 % was given as rescue therapy every 15 min .
bolus infusions were performed to maintain map above 65 mmhg as recommended by sepsis surviving campaign [ 9 ] .
at the end of the study period , all animals were sacrificed with t61 administration ( t61 , 0.3 ml / kg of body weight , intervet international gmbh , koln , germany ). fig. 1 study design .
during preparation period , all animals received 25 ml / kg 0.9 % nacl to prevent hypovolemia .
measurements were taken over a 5 - h period : at baseline ( t0 ) and at 60 ( t60 ) , 120 ( t120 ) , 210 ( t210 ) and 300 ( t300 ) minutes .
all animals were administered 5 mug / kg / min escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) .
the endotoxin was infused over a 30 - min period intravenously .
the sl group received 40.5 g lactate ( 3.61 kcal / g ) .
nc and sb groups received an equivalent energy supply : 39 g glucose ( 3.75 kcal / g ) as 780 ml 5 % glucose solution from t30 to t300 .
to ensure the same fluid intake , the sl group received 780 ml sterile water for injection .
if mean arterial pressure ( map ) felt below 65 mmhg , 2.5 ml / kg infusion of nacl 0.9 % was given as rescue therapy every 15 min .
at the end of the study period , all animals were sacrificed with t61 administration .
immediately after euthanasia , renal biopsies were performed histological analysis at the end of the experiment and immediately after euthanasia , kidneys were withdrawn for histological study .
after macroscopic examination , a part of the samples from each kidney were fixed with acidified formal alcohol ( afa ) and another part of the sample was frozen by liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 degreesc .
the samples fixed in afa were embedded in paraffin and sectioned ( 3 - 4 mum width ) .
after deparaffinization and rehydration , sections were stained with masson 's trichrome , periodic acid - schiff ( pas ) and hematoxylin eosin safran ( hes ) and evaluated in light microscopy .
on frozen tissue , cryosections of 5 mum were cut on a cryostat and incubated 30 min with an antifibrinogen antibody directly conjugated with fluorescein for a direct immunofluorescence .
the antibody was a polyclonal rabbit antibody , which recognized fibrinogen ( ref. f0111 , dako sa , trappes , france ) .
we established two semiquantitative scores for histological abnormalities defined as : score (%) = ( number of glomeruli damaged )/( number of glomeruli examined ) and ( number of capillary sections thrombosed )/( number of capillary sections examined ) per damaged glomeruli .
at least 50 glomeruli were observed in each sample .
the pathologist was blinded to the groups examined .
biological methods leucocyte , haemoglobin and platelet counts were obtained on edta anticoagulated blood .
for coagulation assays , blood ( four parts ) was collected in tubes containing 3.8 % sodium citrate ( one part ) .
fibrinogen levels were rapidly measured by standard procedures .
immunoassay methods were used to determine quantitative thrombin - antithrombin complexes ( tat ) ( enzygnost ( r ) tat micro , siemens , munich , germany ) .
fibrin monomer ( liatest fm ( r ) stago , asnieres , france ) was performed by immunoturbidimetric assay .
the quantitative determination of vwf antigen ( ag ) was measured by turbidimetric assay ( vwf ag ( r ) reagent , siemens , nederland ) ( n = 70 - 100 %) .
tnfalpha and interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) were measured in serum .
plasma levels were detected by elisa method with porcine anti - tnfalpha antibodies ( quantikine ( r ) porcine tnfalpha , r & d systems , usa ) and anti - il - 6 antibodies ( quantikine ( r ) porcine il - 6 , r & d systems , usa ) .
blood and urinary creatinine levels ( cobas ( r ) 8000 modular analyser , roche diagnostics , switzerland ) were measured at each time except t30 .
we computed creatinine clearance , a surrogate marker of gfr , with standard formula [ creatinine clearance ( crcl ) = ( creatinine urinary concentration x rate of urine formation )/ creatinine plasma concentration ] .
diuresis , a marker of both gfr and tubular function , was measured at each time except t30 .
data analysis we considered that the sample size of five animals per group would be sufficient to show a statistical difference if any based on a previous work on the same model [ 27 ] .
statistical analysis was performed with graphpad prism 6 software ( san diego , california ) .
as the distribution was not normal ( shapiro - wilk test ) , quantitative data were expressed using median and interquartile range .
considering the differences between groups for some parameters at baseline , values are expressed as a percentage of the first value .
for multiple intergroup testing , we used kruskal - wallis test with dunn 's multiple comparisons test and mann - whitney u test .
intragroup comparisons were realized by friedman test with dunn 's multiple comparisons test and wilcoxon matched - pairs signed rank test .
the two - tailed significance level was set at p < 0.05 .
results median weight was similar in the three groups of animals : 22.5 ( 18.25 - 23.75 ) kg in nc group , 23 ( 21.75 - 23.5 ) kg in sb group and 23 ( 20.5 - 24 ) kg in sl group .
the endotoxin challenge resulted in hypodynamic shock with a decreased of cardiac index in all animals .
as already described , the infusion of sodium lactate infusion enhanced hemodynamics with a limitation of fluid overload [ 26 ] .
histological results kidneys appeared macroscopically enlarged and swollen in the three groups .
glomeruli showed signs of oedema uniformly , and fibrin thrombi were mainly observed in glomerular capillaries ( fig. 2 ) .
percentage of thrombosed glomeruli and percentage of thrombosed capillary in glomerulus were significantly higher in control groups compared to sl group ( table 1 ) and consistent with an increased amount of microthrombosis. fig. 2 histological comparison of nc and sl groups samples .

results are expressed as median with interquartile ranges .
kruskal - wallis test with dunn 's multiple comparisons test and mann - whitney u test were used for intergroup comparisons .
coagulation and endothelial parameters changes in leucocyte , platelet count , fibrinogen , haemoglobin , tat and vwf in the three groups are illustrated in fig. 3. as expected , we observed a dramatic procoagulant response .
alterations in platelet count and fibrinogen level occurred earlier and were significantly more pronounced in both control groups compared to sl group .
circulating platelets significantly declined at t300 in nc [ 28 ( 24 - 45 ) % ; p = 0.03 compared to baseline ] and sb [ 38 ( 24 - 50 ) % ; p = 0.03 compared to baseline ] groups , while in sl group , the decrease in the platelet count was less important [ 67 ( 48 - 74 ) % ; p = 0.06 compared to baseline ] .
in the same way , the activation of the coagulation cascade was illustrated by a decrease in circulating fibrinogen .
fibrinogen level significantly declined at t300 in nc [ 45 ( 39 - 63 ) % ; p = 0.03 compared to baseline ] and sb [ 53 ( 26 - 69 ) % ; p = 0.03 compared to baseline ] groups , while it remained stable in sl group [ 85 ( 73 - 92 ) % ; p = 0.06 compared to baseline ] .
the increase in fibrin monomer started earlier and was significantly higher at t120 in nc [ 104 ( 82 - 175 ) mug / ml ; p = 0.01 ] and sb groups [ 161 ( 69 - 200 ) mug / ml ; p = 0.03 ] compared to sl group [ 28 ( 19 - 74 ) mug / ml ] .
unfortunately , we could not interpret the results at 210 and 300 min in the three groups because some values were over 200 mug / ml , the upper limit of measurement , despite dilutions ( data not shown ) .
thrombin - antithrombin complex ( tat ) concentrations started to increase at t60 to achieve a maximum level at t210 .
the increase in tat complexes was earlier and significantly higher in nc [ 754 ( 367 - 945 ) mug / ml ; p = 0.03 ] and sb [ 463 ( 249 - 592 ) mug / ml ; p = 0.03 ] groups than in sl group [ 176 ( 37 - 265 ) mug / ml ] .
von willebrand factor ( vwf ) increased in all animals without any significant difference between groups. fig. 3 changes in leucocyte , platelet count , fibrinogen , haemoglobin , tat and vwf in the three groups .

tnfalpha increased rapidly , peaked at t120 in both hypertonic groups and at t210 in nc group , and subsequently decreased until the end of the experiment without returning to baseline levels .
il - 6 was significantly higher in nc group [ 22,938 ( 16,619 - 29,613 ) pg / ml at t210 and 25,687 ( 18,617 - 42,792 ) pg / ml at t300 ] compared to sl group [ 7904 ( 4838 - 9310 ) pg / ml at t210 , p = 0.02 and 6148 ( 4216 - 13,445 ) at t300 , p = 0.03 ] and sb group [ 9234 ( 8108 - 10,869 ) pg / ml at t210 , p = 0.02 and 8433 ( 5174 - 11,961 ) at t300 , p = 0.02 ] .

& p < 0.05 , nc versus sb discussion in the present study , we compare hypertonic sodium lactate with two different therapeutic regimens ; ( 1 ) a standard fluid therapy with isotonic crystalloids ( 0.9 % nacl , the most commonly used crystalloid ) .
although comparing hypertonic with isotonic formulations could appear misleading , it seemed necessary to have a control group corresponding to the usual clinical practice .
( 2 ) a non - conventional hypertonic fluid therapy .
due to an acidifying effect on ph and an elevated chloride concentration , hypertonic saline was not close enough to hypertonic sodium lactate .
conversely , sodium bicarbonate provided the same alkalizing effect and the same amount of sodium and osmoles than sodium lactate .
thereby , this comparison allows extracting clear conclusions and physiological assumptions .
we report here that sodium lactate infusion improves dic - associated renal microvascular thrombosis .
the decrease in renal microvascular thrombosis in sl group could be at least partly explained by the delayed and attenuated procoagulant response ( sodium lactate infusion resulted in a significant smaller decrease in platelets and fibrinogen concentrations and a significant smaller increase in plasma levels of tat ) .
it is known that glomerular thrombosis and vascular thrombosis due to the activation of inflammation and coagulation pathway contribute to the occurrence of acute renal failure in sepsis [ 5 , 29 ] .
indeed , glomerular thrombosis and microvascular fibrin thrombosis compromise glomerular capillary flow , leading to focal ischaemia and necrosis , which is considered to be the main pathogenesis of lps - induced acute renal failure [ 29 , 30 ] .
we first hypothesized that sodium lactate infusion may reduce the endothelial dysfunction and therefore restrict the coagulation cascade .
in fact , it is known that endothelial dysfunction precedes derangement of platelet function or coagulation parameters and drives a pre - dic - associated microvascular thrombosis in endotoxemia [ 28 ] .
in paediatric severe dengue infection , hypertonic sodium lactate induced a partial recovery from endothelial dysfunction , as indicated by a significant decrease in svcam - 1 [ 31 ] .
moreover , lactate as a metabolizable anion may lead to chloride egress from endothelial cells , causing reduction in swelling and improvement in barrier function [ 32 ] .
in our model , we already observed that sodium lactate infusion seemed to reduce capillary leakage [ 26 ] .
in the same way , we observed a non - significant lesser haemoconcentration with lactate infusion in the present study .
however , the evolution of von willebrand factor , a marker of endothelial dysfunction , was not different between groups .
finally , further investigations focused on endothelial function are warranted to explore the sodium lactate impact on capillary leak .
an other explanation of the beneficial effect of sodium lactate on dic could be an anti - inflammatory effect .
it is known that excessive inflammatory mediators play a central role in the development of endotoxin - induced dic .
tnfalpha plays an important part in the early activation of the haemostatic mechanism and in the pathogenesis of dic [ 33 ] .
indeed , a tnfalpha inhibitor can act as a protective drug in lipopolysaccharide - induced dic in a dose - dependent manner [ 34 ] .
then , it is known that plasma il - 6 is higher in patients with dic than in those without dic .
some data suggest that increases in il - 6 might give rise to hypercoagulable and hypofibrinolytic states .
il - 6 could be a cause of dic and be related to prognosis and organ failure [ 35 ] .
at last , immunoglobulin , in lps - induced dic model , could significantly decreased plasma levels of tnfalpha and il - 6 and improved haemostatic abnormality [ 36 ] .
experimental studies of sepsis showed beneficial effects of hyperosmolar solutions modulating inflammatory response , as for instance the expression and release of cytokines tnfalpha and il - 6 [ 37 - 39 ] .
the use of hypertonic saline solution has also demonstrated potential anti - inflammatory effects related to neutrophil activation [ 40 ] .
hypertonic solution acts on polymorphonuclear a2 adenosine receptors and causes a feedback mechanism that stimulates camp and pka release , thus blocking neutrophil activation [ 41 , 42 ] .
nevertheless , the therapeutic window for a beneficial effect of fluid resuscitation with hypertonic fluid seemed to be very narrow [ 43 ] and may be related to leukocyte activation at the time of fluid use [ 44 ] .
our study confirms the beneficial impact of hypertonic solutions on the il - 6 release but not on tnfalpha .
these results could explain part of the beneficial impact of sodium lactate infusion compared to saline .
however , it does not elucidate the difference on coagulation status between sl and sb groups .
in this way , another explanation could be that lactate by itself has important other anti - inflammatory properties .
binding of lactate on a specific membrane receptor ( the plasma membrane gpr81 ) recruits the intracellular adaptor molecule arrb2 to the receptor with subsequent inhibition of the nlrp3 inflammasome leading to a reduction in the il - 1beta - mediated proinflammatory response [ 45 ] .
systemic lps administration induced high levels of proinflammatory cytokines il - 1beta , which contribute to the increased leukocyte - endothelium interaction and promote coagulation cascade [ 46 ] .
pigs were chosen as a clinically relevant species , resembling to humans in coagulation reactions [ 47 ] .
nevertheless , our model presents some limits .
the length of evaluation is short , only 5 h. bolus injection of endotoxin induces initial characteristics of human sepsis such as activation of innate immune system and rises in tnfalpha .
its short - term effects on the inflammatory cascade and the lack of an active nidus do not allow to study the compensatory anti - inflammatory phase often leading to immunosuppression .
nevertheless , endotoxin challenge is still a way to explore the very beginning of sepsis and the better resuscitation fluid strategy in this initial phase .
endotoxic model is not a model of hyperdynamic septic shock .
our model was a hypodynamic shock with a pronounced pulmonary vascular response .
however , it reproduces some main alterations of inflammatory states , e.g. macrocirculatory and microcirculatory dysfunctions , coagulopathy , organs failure .
we used the intravenous route for sepsis induction while patients are often infected by natural route .
the temporal evolution of the aggression was imposed when the pathological process of patients following an individual natural progression .
the endotoxin challenge is responsible for a more explosive proinflammatory response than in a septic shock .
these limits , without questioning the validity of our pathophysiological model , could impair the comparability with dic observed in human septic shock .
in this study , we also reported that sodium lactate preserves gfr .
this finding could be at least partly explained by the slightest renal microvascular thrombosis but also by the hemodynamics and microcirculation improvements previously described [ 25 , 26 ] .
two limits must be reported ; ( 1 ) gfr do not accurately assess kidney function .
moreover , there is a dependence between diuresis and crcl calculation which might have participated to the improvement in crcl .
( 2 ) the mean arterial target threshold of 65 mmhg was not reached for two animals in isotonic saline group and one animal in sodium bicarbonate group .
this may have impacted negatively the renal perfusion pressure during the resuscitation phase independently from the type of fluid resuscitation .
nevertheless , low blood pressure (< 65 mmhg ) occurred only at the end of the experiment , and we already found severe oligo - anuria in these animals before mean arterial pressure falls below 65 mmhg .
conclusions in conclusion , sodium lactate improves dic - associated renal microvascular thrombosis and preserves gfr in our model of endotoxic shock .
in the same way as hemodynamics improvement previously observed , these findings could at least partly explain the preservation of fluid balance with sodium lactate .
in our model , the beneficial effect of sodium lactate on dic - associated renal microvascular thrombosis could be related to an anti - inflammatory effect ( e.g. blockage of the nlrp3 inflammasome ) .
further investigations are warranted to explain the underlying mechanisms and to assess the potential clinical benefits of sodium lactate resuscitation in human sepsis .

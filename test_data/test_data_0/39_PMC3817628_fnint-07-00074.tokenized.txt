making optimal choices in changing environments implies the ability to balance routine , exploitative patterns of behavior with novel , exploratory ones .
we investigated whether galvanic vestibular stimulation ( gvs ) interferes with the balance between exploratory and exploitative behaviors in a free action selection task .
brief right - anodal and left - cathodal gvs or left - anodal and right - cathodal gvs were delivered at random to activate sensorimotor circuits in the left and right hemisphere , respectively .
a sham stimulation condition was included .
participants endogenously generated sequences of possible actions , by freely choosing successive movements of the index or middle finger of the left or right hand .
left - anodal and right - cathodal gvs , which preferentially activates the vestibular projections in the right cerebral hemisphere , increased the novelty in action sequences , as measured by the number of runs in the sequences .
in contrast , right - anodal and left - cathodal gvs decreased the number of runs .
there was no evidence of gvs - induced spatial bias in action choices .
our results confirm previous reports showing a polarity - dependent effect of gvs on the balance between novel and routine responses , and thus between exploratory and exploitative behaviors .
galvanic vestibular stimulation exploration exploitation novelty hemispheric specialization action selection introduction the exploration and exploitation trade - off is a control dilemma that involves most adaptive behaviors , and is fundamental to the relation between organism and environment ( cohen et al. , 2007 ) .
this dilemma is between choosing well - known options close to the expectations ( exploitation ) and choosing new options and possibly learning more ( exploration ) ( goschke , 2000 ) .
for example , in a restaurant you can exploit - choose your usual meal - or you can explore - try whatever dish you have not had before .
thus , exploitation involves perseveration and stereotyped behavior , while exploration involves discovering new possibilities and varying choices , and potentially larger rewards ( cohen et al. , 2007 ) .
making optimal choices in an ever - changing world includes the ability to orient in the surrounding environment ( peacocke , 1983 ) .
therefore , we suspected that vestibular inputs could contribute to the balance between exploration and exploitation .
vestibular information is crucial to determine the relation between the body and surrounding space , and therefore forms the starting point of almost all orienting behaviors .
the semicircular canals detect rotational movements of the head , while the otolith organs detect gravitational and translational acceleration .
these signals contribute to orienting by modulate somatosensory inputs ( vallar et al. , 1990 ; ferre et al. , 2011 ) , controlling postural and balance stability ( day and fitzpatrick , 2005 ) , defining spatial parameters of movement ( karnath and dieterich , 2006 ) and planning motor actions ( rode et al. , 1998 ) .
primate studies revealed that vestibular input does not project to a primary vestibular cortex , but to a network of multimodal areas , notably the parieto - insular vestibular cortex ( pivc ; guldin and grusser , 1998 ) .
the pivc consists of the posterior insula / retroinsular cortex in the upper or lower banks of the lateral sulcus ( guldin and grusser , 1998 ) .
recent functional neuroimaging studies in humans have shown that artificial vestibular stimulation , whether galvanic , caloric , or sound - induced , activates a wide range of multimodal areas , involving the parietal and insular cortices and also the temporal cortex , putamen , and thalamus ( lopez et al. , 2012 ) .
this conjunction of anatomical projections and physiological activations are broadly consistent with the view that the vestibular system acts as a basic reference system for other sensorimotor representations .
we recently found that vestibular inputs contribute to the balance between exploration and exploitation in a random number generation task ( ferre et al. , 2013 ) .
this effect was hemisphere - specific .
left - anodal and right - cathodal galvanic vestibular stimulation ( gvs ) , which primarily activates the right hemisphere , increased randomness of sequences compared to right - anodal and left - cathodal gvs .
however , vestibular stimulation also produces spatial , attentional , and arousing effects .
therefore , to investigate whether vestibular stimulation truly involves modulation of behavior selection , rather than these other independent but frequently - associated functions , we have investigated whether gvs interferes with the generation of novel vs. routinized behaviors in an endogenous action selection task .
in this task , participants endogenously generated a sequence of movements , by freely choosing between four possible actions , involving the index or middle finger of the left or right hand .
in discussing endogenous action selection , it is important to distinguish between " free selection " of single action , and generation of " action patterns " which exist only in the context of a sequence of actions .
the trade - off between exploration and exploitation refers to sequences , or runs , of behavior in which the endogenous choice of any individual action is determined partly by what the participant has done before .
extreme exploitation might involve constantly repeating one action or action sequence , while extreme exploration might involve complete randomness .
a pattern of action selection can therefore be analyzed quantitatively , and placed on a continuum between stereotypy and novelty .
based on our previous findings with random number generation ( ferre et al. , 2013 ) , we hypothesized that gvs might have a polarity - dependent effect on action selection , with left - anodal and right - cathodal gvs promoting randomness / exploration rather than stereotypy / exploitation ( ferre et al. , 2013 ) .
however , it was unclear whether similar organization of vestibular influences on behavior would occur for bimanual movements as for generation of symbolic items such as numbers .
we delivered binaural gvs between the mastoids , to activate peripheral vestibular organs , i.e. , both otoliths and semicircular canal afferents ( stephan et al. , 2005 ) .
this induces a polarity - dependent " virtual rotation vector " ( day and fitzpatrick , 2005 ) which can influence orientation perception and posture .
more surprisingly , gvs also influences sensory and cognitive functions ( utz et al. , 2010 ) .
the effects are polarity dependent .
left - anodal and right - cathodal gvs mimics an inhibition of the left and an activation of the right ear vestibular peripheral organs , decreasing the firing rate of the vestibular nerve on the left side and increasing it on the right side ( goldberg et al. , 1984 ; fitzpatrick and day , 2004 ) .
in contrast , right - anodal and left - cathodal gvs induces the opposite effect .
neuroimaging studies have revealed asymmetrical cortical vestibular projections , suggesting that the core region of the vestibular network is primarily located in the non - dominant hemisphere in right - handed subjects ( dieterich et al. , 2003 ) .
clinical observations have reported strong effects induced by vestibular stimulation on spatial attention in brain - damaged patients ( rubens , 1985 ; utz et al. , 2011 ) .
recently , a contribution of vestibular information to the allocation of attention has also beensuggested in healthy volunteers ( figliozzi et al. , 2005 ) .
we therefore hypothesized that gvs could have spatial effects on the generation of free actions .
in particular , given the specialization of the right hemisphere for spatial responding , gvs - induced activation of vestibular projections in the right hemisphere might cause an attentional shift toward the left side of the space or body ( rubens , 1985 ) , and thus a preference for the left hand , or the leftmost digit , in action selection .
materials and methods participants sixteen naive right - handed paid participants volunteered ( 10 male , mean age 24.7 years +/ - 5.08 sd ) .
subjects with a history of visual , vestibular , or auditory disorders were excluded .
informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the experiment .
the experimental protocol was approved by university college london research ethics committee .
the study was designed according to ethical standards of the declaration of helsinki .
galvanic vestibular stimulation bipolar gvs was used to deliver a boxcar pulse of 1 ma via a commercial stimulator ( good vibrations engineering ltd. , nobleton , on , canada ) .
carbon rubber electrodes ( area 10 cm2 ) were placed binaurally over the mastoid processes and fixed in place with adhesive tape .
the areas of application were first cleaned with cotton wool soaked in surgical spirit , and electrode gel was applied to reduce the impedance .
left - anodal and right - cathodal (" l - gvs ") was used to predominantly stimulates the right hemisphere , while the inverse polarity , left - cathodal and right - anodal configuration , " r - gvs ," was used to predominantly stimulate the left hemisphere ( figure 1b ) .
a " pseudo - gvs " sham stimulation , based on that used by lopez et al .
( 2010 ) , was applied using left - anodal and right - cathodal stimulation of the neck , 5 cm below the mastoids ( figure 1b ) .
this causes a similar tingling skin sensation to real gvs , and therefore functions as a control for non - specific alerting effects .

( c ) number of runs in sequences of three successive free - choices in each experimental condition .
( d ) number of runs in sequences of five successive free - choices in each experimental condition .
( e ) preference for right hand as a function of gvs condition .
stimuli and procedure data from each participant was gathered in a single session .
verbal and written instructions about the task were given to participants at the beginning of the session .
participants sat 50 cm from a screen and made sequences of fingers movements initiated by auditory and visual cues during gvs or pseudo - gvs stimulation .
electrodes for gvs and pseudo - gvs were placed at the beginning of the session and remained in place for the entire duration of the experiment .
the electrodes and the polarity of stimulation were selected under randomized , double - blind , computer control at the start of each block .
a total of 15 blocks were administered , five for each type of stimulation ( l - gvs , r - gvs , and pseudo - gvs ) .
the order was randomized across participants .
before the beginning of the task , participants received a number of short training blocks .
these blocks introduced and familiarized participants with the visual and auditory cues .
no vestibular or sham stimulation was delivered during the training .
each block comprised 21 trials in random order .
each trial began with a symbol " l ," " r ," or "=," on the center of the screen .
the symbol instructed participants which hand to respond with ("=" meaning that the participant could press a button with a hand of her choice ) .
the auditory signals referred to the finger for responding .
a high frequency beep instructed participants to use the index finger , a low frequency beep signaled the middle finger , and a mid frequency beep signaled a free choice .
the visual stimulus appeared before the auditory cue ( table 1 and figure 1a ) .
the participant was asked to monitor the visual and auditory cues and make an appropriate keypress .
for example , if the auditory tone for the index finger was heard and the "=" stimulus displayed , the participant should press a button with the index finger of whichever hand she chose .
if the " free " tone was heard and a " l " was displayed on the screen , she should move either the middle or index finger of her left hand .
if the " free " tone was heard and the "=" was displayed , the choice of both finger and hand was entirely free .
thus each trial was composed of a visual cue and the corresponding sequence of auditory cues .
three different trial lengths were presented , at random : single choice trial , sequences of three consecutive choices and sequences of five consecutive choices ( table 1 ) .
table 1 experimental conditions in the free action generation task .
visual cue = hand auditory cue = finger single choice left index middle free right index middle free free index middle free sequences of 3 left index middle free [ - 1pc ] consecutive choices right index middle free free index middle free sequences of 5 left index middle free [ - 1pc ] consecutive choices right index middle free free index middle free possible combinations of movements during the free action generation task .
galvanic vestibular stimulation or pesudo - gvs began 2,000 ms before each sequence , and ended 200 ms after the last beep .
the inter - tone interval ranged between 1,000 and 1,400 ms randomly and uniformly .
this cadence was adopted to discourage purely rhythmic responses and to maintain response times .
the average inter - tone interval was decided after a pilot study , suggesting that 1,200 ms was sufficiently long to allow quick decisions after each imperative stimulus , whilst preventing pre - decision of which response to make .
responses were collected via a custom keypad .
the keypad was held vertically facing away from the participant ( figure 1a ) to exclude the possibility that the lateral spatial position of the response key could influence finger choice .
the index and middle fingers of left and right hands remained on the keypad throughout .
participants were instructed to maintain contact , and depress an appropriate key , within 800 ms of the visual and auditory stimuli .
ill - timed or multiple responses were also recorded .
participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible .
participants were also encouraged to respond spontaneously and without pre - decision when a free choice of finger and / or hand was indicated .
data analysis because our interest focussed on vestibular modulation of action selection , we analyzed only responses obtained in the free choice conditions .
based on the distinction made above , we had different hypotheses about selection of a single action , versus sequential patterns of several actions .
in particular , the trade - off between exploration and exploitation reflects the relation between each action in a sequence and the previous actions .
this determines whether the sequence reflects a routinized or innovative action patterns .
this relation is absent in a single instance of free action selection , and becomes progressively more important as the run of successive free actions lengthens .
therefore , we analyzed the sequences of three and five " free " consecutive choices , and we predicted that any effects of vestibular input on novelty of action choices would be stronger for longer sequences .
novelty was defined by the number of adjacent identical elements .
for example , the sequence " aaaaa " comprises one run , while the " aaaab " comprises two runs .
thus , the maximum and minimum number of runs , given five successive choices between four possible actions , are five and one , respectively .
trials involving just one " free " choice were analyzed separately , to identify whether vestibular input generated a preference for one particular response .
the percentage of right hand choices in response to free stimuli ("=" visual cues and the " free " tone ) was calculated .
we hypothesized that right - anodal and left - cathodal stimulation ( r - gvs ) would induce a right hand preference compared to left - anodal and right - cathodal stimulation ( l - gvs ). that is , this analysis focussed on spatial biases in individual action selection , rather than on sequential action patterns .
the number of runs in three and five - choices trials and percentage of right hand preferences were estimated for each sequence , and averaged for the three experimental conditions : l - gvs , r - gvs , and pseudo - gvs .
we hypothesized that vestibular stimulation might influence our variables in two distinct ways ( ferre et al. , 2013 ) , and we tested these hypotheses as planned contrasts .
first , any activation of the vestibular system might influence free action selection independent of polarity and hemispheric effects .
to test this generic hypothesis , we compared the average of the l - gvs and r - gvs conditions to the pseudo - gvs condition , for each dependent variable .
second , we hypothesized that the effects of vestibular stimulation could be specific to the hemisphere activated , and would therefore differ between l - gvs and r - gvs conditions .
results the mean data in each condition are shown in table 2 .
table 2 mean scores in each stimulation condition .
stimulation condition l - gvs r - gvs pseudo - gvs measures of spatial bias right hand preference (%) 47.25 47.06 45.28 ( 13.38 ) ( 11.61 ) ( 9.80 ) measures of novelty number of runs : 2.06 2.04 1.99 sequences of 3 consecutive choices ( 0.49 ) ( 0.44 ) ( 0.44 ) number of runs : 3.09 2.83 2.99 sequences of 5 consecutive choices ( 0.85 ) ( 0.78 ) ( 0.77 ) measures of spatial bias and novelty ( mean scores , sd ) in l - gvs , r - gvs , and pseudo - gvs .
generic vestibular effects on novel action selection the generic vestibular effect , defined as ( l - gvs + r - gvs )/ 2 , was compared to the pseudo - gvs condition .
a 2 x 2 anova with stimulation (( l - gvs + r - gvs )/ 2 vs. pseudo - gvs ) and sequence length ( sequences of three consecutive choices vs. sequences of five consecutive choices ) was performed .
this analysis revealed a predictable main effect of sequence length ( f ( 1,15 ) = 92.171 , p < 0.001 ) , indicating more runs of a single action choice in sequences of five consecutive choices compared to sequences of three consecutive choices , as one might expect ( figures 1c,d ) .
no significant main effect of stimulation ( f ( 1,15 ) = 0.086 , p = 0.773 ) or interactions between the factors ( f ( 1,15 ) = 1.337 , p = 0.266 ) was found ( figures 1c,d ) .
hemisphere - specific vestibular effects on novelty generation we next compared l - gvs and r - gvs conditions .
a 2 x 2 anova with stimulation ( l - gvs vs. r - gvs ) and sequence length ( sequences of three consecutive choices vs. sequences of five consecutive choices ) was performed .
this analysis revealed a main effect of sequence length ( f ( 1,15 ) = 62.672 , p < 0.001 ) .
the effect of stimulation showed a trend toward conventional statistical significance ( f ( 1,15 ) = 3.142 , p = 0.097 ) .
a significant interaction between stimulation and sequence length has been found ( f ( 1,15 ) = 9.800 , p = 0.007 ) .
to further investigate this interaction , we directly compared l - gvs and r - gvs sequences of three and five consecutive choices .
no significant difference was found in sequences of three consecutive choices ( t ( 15 ) = 0.251 , p = 0.806 ; figure 1c ) , but a significant effect emerged for sequences of five choices ( t ( 15 ) = 2.86 , p = 0.012 ; figure 1d ) .
to investigate whether this effect reflected a benefit of l - gvs or a cost of r - gvs , we additionally compared each individual stimulation condition to pseudo - gvs .
neither gvs condition was significantly different from the pseudo - gvs ( p > 0.05 ) , suggesting that the effect lay in an approximately equal balance between the two hemispheric stimulations .
generic and specific effects on hand preference investigation of spatial effects of gvs , measured as preference for right hand actions on free - choice trials , did not reveal generic ( t ( 15 ) = 0.756 , p = 0.461 ) or specific vestibular effects ( t ( 15 ) = 0.054 , p = 0.958 ; figure 1e ) .
stimulation effects on task errors to investigate whether gvs has a specific effect on motor responses , we analyzed errors made by participants during the endogenous actions generation task .
ill - timed and multiple responses were counted across the three experimental conditions ( l - gvs , r - gvs , pseudo - gvs ) .
since this analysis aimed to investigate differences between l - gvs , r - gvs , and pseudo - gvs on error rate , all free choice trials ( one choice , sequences of three consecutive choices and of five consecutive choices ) were considered .
the percentage of errors was : l - gvs 4.03 % ; r - gvs 4.23 % , pseudo - gvs 6.78 %) .
a 3 x 3 anova on error rate with stimulation ( l - gvs , r - gvs , pseudo - gvs ) and sequence length ( one choice , three consecutive choices and five consecutive choices ) was performed .
this analysis revealed a main effect of sequence length ( f ( 2,30 ) = 6.396 , p = 0.005 ) .
participants showed the tendency to commit more errors during single choices trials compared to trials of three consecutive choices ( t ( 15 ) = 2.374 , p = 0.031 ) and five consecutive choices ( t ( 15 ) = 3.354 , p = 0.004 ) .
importantly , no significant effect of stimulation ( f ( 2,30 ) = 1.785 , p = 0.185 ) or interaction between stimulation and sequence length ( f ( 4,60 ) = 0.743 , p = 0.567 ) was found .
discussion here we demonstrated that vestibular input in general did not influence the generation of novelty in a free selection of manual responses .
in contrast , specific polarities of vestibular input , associated with hemisphere - specific activations , had significantly different effects on free selection .
left - anodal and right - cathodal gvs increased novelty of action selection , relative to right - anodal and left - cathodal gvs , which decreased novelty .
in other words , left - anodal and right - cathodal boosted the selection of different actions , shifting more often between fingers and hands movements , while right - cathodal and left - anodal promoted the repetition of the same finger movement .
gvs polarity - dependent differences in postural , sensorimotor , and cognitive functions have been demonstrated both in healthy volunteers and in brain damaged patients ( utz et al. , 2010 ) .
fink et al .
( 2003 ) used fmri to study the effects of bipolar gvs .
they found that left - anodal and right - cathodal gvs produced unilateral activation of the right hemisphere vestibular projections , while the opposite polarity , i.e. , left - cathodal and right - anodal gvs , activated both left and right hemispheres ( fink et al. , 2003 ) .
these results are coherent with the asymmetrical cortical vestibular representation in the right hemisphere in right - handed subjects ( bense et al. , 2001 ; suzuki et al. , 2001 ; dieterich et al. , 2003 ; janzen et al. , 2008 ) .
importantly , the observed hemispheric - specific effects might arise because of this cortical asymmetry , or because one polarity of gvs has stronger effects in the brain .
we suggest that the difference between l - gvs and r - gvs in action selection reflects the activation by vestibular input of a large - scale hemispheric network for behavioral control .
left and right cerebral hemispheres play different roles in novelty and cognitive routine .
goldberg and costa ( 1981 ) formulated a novelty - routinization model , suggesting a strong hemispheric specialization in behavioral control .
the right cerebral hemisphere is responsible for exploratory processing of new cognitive situations , particularly in the absence of any pre - existing cognitive strategy ( goldberg and costa , 1981 ; goldberg et al. , 1994 ; goldberg and podell , 1995 ) .
in contrast , the left hemisphere is specialized for processing of pre - existing representation and routine cognitive strategies .
thus , right brain - damaged patients showed more repetitive behavior than patients with comparable lesions in the left hemisphere ( sandson and albert , 1987 ; goldberg et al. , 1994 ) .
we suggest that the hemispheric - specific activations induced by gvs similarly influence the balance between generative and repetitive behaviors .
left - anodal and right - cathodal ( l - gvs ) would boost the selection of movements based on exploration , by activating the right hemisphere , while r - gvs would reduce novelty by promoting stereotyped behaviors controlled by the left hemisphere .
given the multimodal nature of vestibular cortical projections , we cannot exclude the possibility that vestibular signals reach specific frontal or parietal areas involved in the generation of motor planning .
thus , it remains unclear if our results reflect activations which produce a diffuse imbalance between hemispheres , or whether specific activations within each hemisphere are responsible .
our results confirmed recent findings of gvs effects on random number generation ( ferre et al. , 2013 ) .
to that extent , they suggest a general , task - independent vestibular contribution to novel behavior .
left - anodal and right - cathodal gvs increased randomness compared to right - anodal and left - cathodal gvs , which decreased it ( ferre et al. , 2013 ) .
the polarity - specific effects of gvs were therefore consistent for the random number generation studied previously , and the free selection of manual responses studied here .
this is particularly significant , given that the cortical areas involved in number generation and action selection are at least partly different .
the generation of random numbers activated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , the lateral premotor cortex , the anterior cingulated , and the inferior and superior parietal cortex ( jahanshahi et al. , 1998 , 2000 ; daniels et al. , 2003 ) .
in contrast , endogenous action selection involves more medial areas , as the premotor cortex , the supplementary motor area , the intraparietal sulcus , the cingulated gyrus ( grezes and decety , 2001 ) .
given this similarity of gvs effects across output modalities , we suggest that vestibular stimulation may influence high - level features of action control , that go beyond a specific output system or a single cortical programming center .
the balance between innovation / exploration and perseveration / exploitation might be one such high - level parameter .
fink et al .
( 2009a,b ) studied changes in brain activity during novel , or creative , processing such as the generation of alternative behaviors .
individuals who scored higher on indices of originality had a stronger eeg alpha rhythm in the right than in the left hemisphere , while less original individuals showed no hemispheric asymmetry ( fink et al. , 2009a ) .
these results have been replicated using a range of different testing paradigms ( fink et al. , 2009a,b ) suggesting a modality independent effect of novelty on neural processing .
thus , the content of representations and behavior generated may not be crucial : almost any behavior or choice can be performed in a novel way , or repeated in a routine , preservative or stereotyped way .
our data also support this hypothesis and provide additional evidence that left and right cerebral hemispheres are differentially involved in novelty and cognitive routine generation .
further , effects of gvs interacted with sequence length .
this is also consistent with an account based on generation of novel behavior .
sequence length influences randomness for simple reasons of sampling , since the probability of generating novel choices inevitably increases with the length of the sequence ( schulz et al. , 2012 ) .
nevertheless , sequence length also affects randomness judgements , but in the opposite direction .
participants judge short sequences as more random than long sequences .
tversky and kahneman ( 1971 , 1974 ) suggested that participants try to produce a sequence of choices that is representative of a random process over a short section of behaviors .
thus , the desire to produce this representative sequence influences short sequences rather than long sequences .
in line with this notion , short sequences are barely influenced by other factors .
this would account for the interaction with sequence length in our data .
although several clinical observations reported strong effects induced by vestibular stimulation in visuo - spatial attention ( utz et al. , 2011 ) , our data did not show any evidence of spatial bias .
galvanic vestibular stimulation was previously shown to interfere with spatial processing in healthy participants during spatial tasks ( dilda et al. , 2012 ) .
similarly , figliozzi et al .
( 2005 ) demonstrated that vestibular inputs could produce spatiotopic shifts of attention .
we thus hypothesized that vestibular input might shift spatial attention toward one side of the body , as a result of activating the contralateral hemisphere .
in particular , attentional accounts would predict that left - anodal and right - cathodal should cause a preference for selecting the left hand .
however , our data did not support this prediction .
further studies are needed to clarify the role of vestibular inputs in higher order spatial and attentional processing , in particular related to body representation .
in the meantime , two possibilities exist .
first , gvs may be too weak to cause spatial effects in healthy participants .
second , previous effects of vestibular stimulation in patients ( rubens , 1985 ) may have overestimated the vestibular role in spatial attention .
in conclusion , our results confirm previous reports showing polarity - dependent effects of gvs on the balance between novel and routine responses , and thus between exploratory and exploitative behaviors .
we suggest that the vestibular - mediated balancing between exploitation and exploration may be a crucial , but neglected , element of the brain 's capacity to interact with the environment .
